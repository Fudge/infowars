[00:00.000 --> 00:25.760]  The generals are gathered in their black masses
[00:31.600 --> 00:32.720]  The armies are masked
[00:36.080 --> 00:38.720]  Generals gathered in their masses
[00:41.520 --> 00:44.480]  Just like witches at black masses
[00:47.040 --> 00:49.680]  Evil minds that plot destruction
[00:52.480 --> 00:55.280]  Sorcerer of death's construction
[00:55.280 --> 00:59.440]  In the fields the body's burning
[01:03.440 --> 01:06.160]  As the war machine keeps turning
[01:08.880 --> 01:11.440]  Death and hatred to mankind
[01:14.080 --> 01:17.440]  Poisoning their rain wash my hands
[01:17.440 --> 01:23.440]  And that is exactly what is going on ladies and gentlemen
[01:26.160 --> 01:31.840]  Started the broadcast for the first time in many years with a different intro song
[01:32.640 --> 01:36.960]  Because I wanted to note to everyone that we are entering into the darkest waters
[01:37.600 --> 01:39.920]  The world has ever seen
[01:41.760 --> 01:44.000]  And the politicians are hiding themselves away
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.520]  The democrats are, they only started the wars
[01:50.480 --> 01:54.400]  Politicians hide themselves away
[01:55.680 --> 01:58.480]  They only start in the war
[02:00.880 --> 02:04.960]  Why do they go out to fight?
[02:06.080 --> 02:09.120]  They leave their home to the poor
[02:09.120 --> 02:17.200]  We are live, it is Friday, we are locked and loaded in the info-war
[02:21.680 --> 02:25.840]  Time will tell on their power lines
[02:26.960 --> 02:29.920]  Making war just for fun
[02:32.160 --> 02:36.160]  Treating people just like mortages
[02:36.160 --> 02:40.160]  Wait till their judgement day comes
[02:44.160 --> 02:46.160]  Treating people just like ponds and chests
[02:46.160 --> 02:50.160]  Wait till their judgement day comes
[02:50.160 --> 02:54.160]  They're poisoned with rain wash minds
[02:54.160 --> 03:06.160]  Sorcerers of death construction
[03:06.160 --> 03:12.160]  Everybody listening, this is a very important broadcast today
[03:16.160 --> 03:20.160]  Stand by for vital information
[03:20.160 --> 03:24.160]  After we go to this break
[03:24.160 --> 03:30.160]  This information is so important I just can't come right into the start of the show
[03:34.160 --> 03:36.160]  And calmly report on it
[03:36.160 --> 03:40.160]  I need to point out this is important
[03:40.160 --> 03:42.160]  This is special
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.160]  And this needs to explode across the internet and out of cyberspace
[03:46.160 --> 03:50.160]  And into the third dimension, into the plane of existence
[03:50.160 --> 03:54.160]  We all live in, it needs to manifest around the water cooler
[03:54.160 --> 03:56.160]  In your churches
[03:56.160 --> 03:58.160]  In your homes
[03:58.160 --> 04:00.160]  In the streets
[04:00.160 --> 04:04.160]  From the hills, the mountains, in the valleys
[04:06.160 --> 04:08.160]  And we will cover it
[04:08.160 --> 04:10.160]  After this break
[04:10.160 --> 04:18.160]  Now in darkness, well stops turning
[04:18.160 --> 04:22.160]  As she's where the body's burning
[04:24.160 --> 04:28.160]  No more war pigs of the power
[04:30.160 --> 04:34.160]  And thus God has struck the hour
[04:34.160 --> 04:40.160]  Day of judgement, God is calling
[04:40.160 --> 04:44.160]  Underneath the war pigs crawling
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.160]  Bagging masses for the sins
[04:50.160 --> 04:54.160]  Satan laughing spreads his wings
[04:54.160 --> 04:56.160]  Oh Lord Jesus
[04:56.160 --> 05:04.160]  It is a big idea a new world order
[05:04.160 --> 05:06.160]  In the near future
[05:06.160 --> 05:10.160]  Earth is dominated by powerful world government
[05:10.160 --> 05:12.160]  It's known as the Builder Bird
[05:12.160 --> 05:16.160]  Could their objective be world domination?
[05:16.160 --> 05:18.160]  For thousands of years their dark order grew
[05:18.160 --> 05:22.160]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[05:22.160 --> 05:26.160]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[05:26.160 --> 05:28.160]  Is at hand
[05:30.160 --> 05:32.160]  For the first time in history
[05:32.160 --> 05:34.160]  The elites plan for world government
[05:34.160 --> 05:36.160]  Is blown wide open
[05:36.160 --> 05:40.160]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda
[05:40.160 --> 05:42.160]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government
[05:42.160 --> 05:44.160]  Most people have no idea they're not after money
[05:44.160 --> 05:46.160]  They have all the money they need, they're after power
[05:46.160 --> 05:48.160]  That's their after easy

[05:56.160 --> 06:00.160]  In game blueprint for global and sleep, you have been warned
[06:00.160 --> 06:04.160]  Hi this is Alex Jones and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline
[06:04.160 --> 06:06.160]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor
[06:06.160 --> 06:08.160]  Even though we're paying record prices at the pump
[06:08.160 --> 06:10.160]  I have run across a company called SFR
[06:10.160 --> 06:14.160]  Who has developed two products that improve gas mileage
[06:14.160 --> 06:16.160]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300
[06:16.160 --> 06:18.160]  To clean your injection system
[06:18.160 --> 06:20.160]  Protect a complete fuel system treatment
[06:20.160 --> 06:23.160]  Cleans to 95% of new engine condition
[06:23.160 --> 06:25.160]  Improving mileage and only one tank full
[06:25.160 --> 06:28.160]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction
[06:28.160 --> 06:30.160]  But it extends the life of your engine
[06:30.160 --> 06:32.160]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline
[06:32.160 --> 06:34.160]  It's time to take action
[06:34.160 --> 06:36.160]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment
[06:36.160 --> 06:38.160]  For only $9.95
[06:38.160 --> 06:40.160]  And receive a free engine treatment
[06:40.160 --> 06:42.160]  Which is a $12.95 value free
[06:42.160 --> 06:44.160]  Call triple eight, use SFR1
[06:44.160 --> 06:46.160]  That number again is triple eight
[06:46.160 --> 06:48.160]  Use SFR1
[06:48.160 --> 06:51.160]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com

[07:02.160 --> 07:05.160]  Of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[07:05.160 --> 07:08.160]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients
[07:08.160 --> 07:10.160]  Most of which are synthetic
[07:10.160 --> 07:12.160]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here
[07:12.160 --> 07:14.160]  Let's go back to basics

[08:20.160 --> 08:22.160]  Alex Jones
[08:28.160 --> 08:30.160]  The news I'm about to cover
[08:30.160 --> 08:32.160]  Broke on the internet yesterday
[08:32.160 --> 08:34.160]  As we were ending the broadcast
[08:34.160 --> 08:37.160]  And we did briefly cover it then
[08:37.160 --> 08:41.160]  I will now, for the next hour, cover it in great detail
[08:41.160 --> 08:44.160]  Then, veteran prosecutor of the Manson family
[08:44.160 --> 08:46.160]  And many others
[08:46.160 --> 08:48.160]  Vincent Bugliozzi will join us
[08:48.160 --> 08:49.160]  For a full hour
[08:49.160 --> 08:51.160]  In the second hour, Dr. Nick Begitz
[08:51.160 --> 08:53.160]  Talking about his brother running for Senate
[08:53.160 --> 08:57.160]  Against indicted Senator Stevens
[08:57.160 --> 08:59.160]  And then for a full hour to take your phone calls
[08:59.160 --> 09:01.160]  On the economy and the future of it
[09:01.160 --> 09:04.160]  Bob Chapman on this Friday edition
[09:04.160 --> 09:06.160]  We'll have open phones
[09:06.160 --> 09:10.160]  With all three of our guests today
[09:10.160 --> 09:12.160]  All right, let me go ahead and get into
[09:12.160 --> 09:13.160]  The most important news
[09:13.160 --> 09:15.160]  We've seen a very long time
[09:15.160 --> 09:19.160]  A key break in the 9-11 investigation
[09:19.160 --> 09:21.160]  But not just the 9-11 investigation
[09:21.160 --> 09:23.160]  In the history of false flag
[09:23.160 --> 09:29.160]  State-sponsored self-inflicted wounds
[09:29.160 --> 09:31.160]  This is vital information
[09:31.160 --> 09:34.160]  I need everyone to go to infowars.com
[09:34.160 --> 09:37.160]  And get the report done by Kurt Nemo
[09:37.160 --> 09:41.160]  The original report broke on the web yesterday
[09:41.160 --> 09:44.160]  Via Think Progress
[09:44.160 --> 09:46.160]  Excellent news source
[09:46.160 --> 09:48.160]  But Kurt Nemo went through
[09:48.160 --> 09:50.160]  And gave some of the background history
[09:50.160 --> 09:56.160]  To show just how important this information is
[09:56.160 --> 09:59.160]  Now, let me, before I cover
[09:59.160 --> 10:02.160]  The latest information concerning this
[10:02.160 --> 10:07.160]  Story from one of the best sources out there
[10:07.160 --> 10:10.160]  In mainstream news
[10:10.160 --> 10:13.160]  The greatest living investigative journalist
[10:13.160 --> 10:15.160]  He is heralded universally
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.160]  As the greatest living investigative journalist
[10:19.160 --> 10:22.160]  Sy Hirsch
[10:22.160 --> 10:24.160]  And John, cue that audio up from yesterday
[10:24.160 --> 10:27.160]  I want to play the full clip
[10:27.160 --> 10:29.160]  But before I do that
[10:29.160 --> 10:33.160]  This is an incontrovertible fact
[10:33.160 --> 10:36.160]  That there are more than 200
[10:36.160 --> 10:42.160]  Declassified publicly available examples
[10:42.160 --> 10:44.160]  Of criminal elements
[10:44.160 --> 10:46.160]  I want to be clear, not the entire government
[10:46.160 --> 10:49.160]  But a tiny faction at the top
[10:49.160 --> 10:53.160]  Staging more than 200 terror attacks
[10:53.160 --> 10:56.160]  And provocateur actions
[10:56.160 --> 10:59.160]  Some of the oldest declassified examples
[10:59.160 --> 11:01.160]  On CIA.gov
[11:01.160 --> 11:04.160]  Are Operation Ajax in 1953
[11:04.160 --> 11:06.160]  Where the CIA led by
[11:06.160 --> 11:09.160]  Black Ops Commander Kermit Roosevelt
[11:09.160 --> 11:12.160]  And Norman Schwartzkopf's father
[11:12.160 --> 11:14.160]  General Schwartzkopf's father
[11:14.160 --> 11:17.160]  And British intelligence, MI6
[11:17.160 --> 11:19.160]  Led a team in a one-year program
[11:19.160 --> 11:22.160]  To overthrow the elected
[11:22.160 --> 11:26.160]  West anti-communist government of Muhammad Mosaic
[11:26.160 --> 11:29.160]  Who was secular, they couldn't allow that
[11:29.160 --> 11:31.160]  Very advanced civilization, they don't want that
[11:31.160 --> 11:35.160]  They came in with radical Muslims
[11:35.160 --> 11:38.160]  As their shock troops
[11:38.160 --> 11:43.160]  To then back putting in to power
[11:43.160 --> 11:45.160]  The princeling, the Shah of Iran
[11:45.160 --> 11:47.160]  Then they turned around and stabbed the Muslims
[11:47.160 --> 11:50.160]  They used to come to power in the back
[11:50.160 --> 11:53.160]  They staged terror attacks all over the country
[11:53.160 --> 11:55.160]  Blowing up mosques, bombing schools
[11:55.160 --> 11:57.160]  Shooting police and military
[11:57.160 --> 12:00.160]  And handing out hundreds of thousands of handbills
[12:00.160 --> 12:04.160]  Saying that Muhammad Mosaic
[12:04.160 --> 12:06.160]  Had done it, in fact, it was
[12:06.160 --> 12:11.160]  Muhammad Mosaic claiming responsibility for it
[12:11.160 --> 12:13.160]  There, of course, is the Gulf of Tonkin
[12:13.160 --> 12:16.160]  A staged event, claiming the ships were shot at
[12:16.160 --> 12:18.160]  To get us into Vietnam, now totally declassified
[12:18.160 --> 12:20.160]  USS Liberty, now declassified
[12:20.160 --> 12:22.160]  As we had always told you with all the eyewitnesses
[12:22.160 --> 12:24.160]  And the admirals and the judge-advocate generals
[12:24.160 --> 12:26.160]  And the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[12:26.160 --> 12:28.160]  I had them all on over the years
[12:28.160 --> 12:30.160]  Most of them are dead, but the audio of them is posted
[12:30.160 --> 12:33.160]  On infowars.com and prismplanet.com
[12:33.160 --> 12:35.160]  Admiral Moore died in 2004
[12:35.160 --> 12:39.160]  We interviewed him for the fifth time weeks before he died
[12:39.160 --> 12:41.160]  Ward Boston still alive
[12:41.160 --> 12:43.160]  He was the judge-advocate captain
[12:43.160 --> 12:45.160]  Who then became judge-advocate general
[12:45.160 --> 12:46.160]  Head of the Navy later
[12:46.160 --> 12:48.160]  Who was charged with the whitewash and cover-up
[12:48.160 --> 12:49.160]  Of what happened
[12:49.160 --> 12:51.160]  Total eyewitness telling you on air
[12:51.160 --> 12:52.160]  The captain before he died
[12:52.160 --> 12:54.160]  We interviewed many years ago
[12:54.160 --> 12:57.160]  The doctor, the first mates
[12:57.160 --> 12:59.160]  Many of them still alive
[12:59.160 --> 13:03.160]  I've interviewed more than 50 people involved
[13:03.160 --> 13:06.160]  In and around the USS Liberty
[13:06.160 --> 13:09.160]  Now declassified, Chicago Tribune
[13:09.160 --> 13:11.160]  On a premeditated attack by Israel
[13:11.160 --> 13:13.160]  Working with LBJ to try to sink the ship
[13:13.160 --> 13:14.160]  Who blocked aid to the ship
[13:14.160 --> 13:16.160]  As it was under attack for two-and-a-half hours
[13:16.160 --> 13:18.160]  By Descent Misery bombers
[13:18.160 --> 13:20.160]  Mirage fighter bombers
[13:20.160 --> 13:22.160]  Tartepido boats
[13:22.160 --> 13:25.160]  Helicopters
[13:25.160 --> 13:27.160]  The most highly decorated ship in
[13:27.160 --> 13:32.160]  United States naval history
[13:32.160 --> 13:34.160]  They were told they would be killed
[13:34.160 --> 13:37.160]  If they told any of the public
[13:37.160 --> 13:39.160]  About what really happened with the attack
[13:39.160 --> 13:42.160]  And I've had multiple eyewitnesses on this show
[13:42.160 --> 13:44.160]  The Admiral who was told by LBJ
[13:44.160 --> 13:46.160]  To turn the jets back and not aid them
[13:46.160 --> 13:47.160]  When they kept the ship afloat
[13:47.160 --> 13:49.160]  And then when Russian intelligence
[13:49.160 --> 13:51.160]  Ship pulled up and began photographing
[13:51.160 --> 13:53.160]  And filming it, the Israeli commando
[13:53.160 --> 13:55.160]  Helicopters were forced to break off
[13:55.160 --> 13:58.160]  Going on board the ship in hand-to-hand combat
[13:58.160 --> 13:59.160]  And killing everyone aboard
[13:59.160 --> 14:01.160]  And then blowing the bottom of the ship out
[14:01.160 --> 14:03.160]  And sending it to the bottom
[14:03.160 --> 14:04.160]  Because they followed procedures
[14:04.160 --> 14:06.160]  And locked down all the bulkheads
[14:06.160 --> 14:08.160]  Some men went into rooms on fire
[14:08.160 --> 14:09.160]  To close bulkheads of the ship
[14:09.160 --> 14:10.160]  Would have gone to the bottom
[14:10.160 --> 14:13.160]  A 30-plus-foot hole was blown on the side
[14:13.160 --> 14:15.160]  By one of the torpedoes
[14:19.160 --> 14:21.160]  But again, I already digress
[14:21.160 --> 14:24.160]  I'm just giving you documented examples
[14:24.160 --> 14:26.160]  Of what we're dealing with here
[14:31.160 --> 14:33.160]  There are hundreds of other
[14:33.160 --> 14:36.160]  Declassified examples
[14:36.160 --> 14:38.160]  Of provocateured
[14:38.160 --> 14:42.160]  False-flag staged events
[14:42.160 --> 14:44.160]  Hundreds, more than 200
[14:44.160 --> 14:47.160]  Declassified
[14:47.160 --> 14:49.160]  Then we had Oklahoma City
[14:49.160 --> 14:50.160]  And you go over the evidence of that
[14:50.160 --> 14:51.160]  And I've made a film
[14:51.160 --> 14:53.160]  America's Road by Design covering it
[14:53.160 --> 14:56.160]  It's now come out in mainstream newspapers
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.160]  That who we fingered a decade ago
[15:00.160 --> 15:02.160]  The Southern Poverty Law Center
[15:02.160 --> 15:05.160]  The so-called anti-hate group
[15:05.160 --> 15:07.160]  Was running the white supremacist
[15:07.160 --> 15:10.160]  Compound where the media told us
[15:10.160 --> 15:13.160]  The attacks supposedly emanated from
[15:13.160 --> 15:18.160]  Not infiltrating, founding, running
[15:18.160 --> 15:22.160]  With the CIA and FBI
[15:22.160 --> 15:23.160]  And then you go through the bombs
[15:23.160 --> 15:24.160]  In the building and the eyewitnesses
[15:24.160 --> 15:26.160]  In the cop of the year being murdered
[15:26.160 --> 15:27.160]  After he went public saying
[15:27.160 --> 15:29.160]  It was the government in Oklahoma City
[15:29.160 --> 15:33.160]  On and on and on Terrence Yeke
[15:33.160 --> 15:35.160]  We have all the Republican memos
[15:35.160 --> 15:37.160]  Saying we need terror attacks
[15:37.160 --> 15:41.160]  To be able to attack Iraq and Afghanistan
[15:41.160 --> 15:42.160]  And Iran
[15:42.160 --> 15:44.160]  And we have the PNAC document
[15:44.160 --> 15:45.160]  September 2000
[15:45.160 --> 15:46.160]  Rebuilding America's defenses
[15:46.160 --> 15:48.160]  Written by Cheney saying the same thing
[15:48.160 --> 15:49.160]  And we have the grand chess board
[15:49.160 --> 15:51.160]  Written by Zabigniew Brzezinski
[15:51.160 --> 15:52.160]  Stating the same thing
[15:52.160 --> 15:55.160]  And we have all the modern Republican memos
[15:55.160 --> 15:56.160]  And op-ed editorial pieces
[15:56.160 --> 16:00.160]  And major newspapers
[16:00.160 --> 16:02.160]  Like the Philadelphia Daily News
[16:02.160 --> 16:04.160]  Where they said 9-11 was great for America
[16:04.160 --> 16:05.160]  We need another one
[16:05.160 --> 16:07.160]  And then we have Gary Hart
[16:07.160 --> 16:09.160]  Head of the Homeland Security Board
[16:09.160 --> 16:11.160]  With the CFR that wrote the plan
[16:11.160 --> 16:13.160]  For Homeland Security before 9-11
[16:13.160 --> 16:15.160]  And said we'd be hit by terrorists
[16:15.160 --> 16:16.160]  And give up all your rights when we do
[16:16.160 --> 16:18.160]  Writing letters to Iran saying
[16:18.160 --> 16:20.160]  Don't think because 80% of the American people
[16:20.160 --> 16:21.160]  Are against attacking you
[16:21.160 --> 16:22.160]  That you won't be attacked
[16:22.160 --> 16:24.160]  The U.S. government will stage attacks
[16:24.160 --> 16:25.160]  And we went and interviewed him
[16:25.160 --> 16:26.160]  It's in truth rising
[16:26.160 --> 16:27.160]  And he said yes
[16:27.160 --> 16:28.160]  Our government will stage attacks
[16:28.160 --> 16:30.160]  It's all on record
[16:30.160 --> 16:33.160]  Thousands of pieces of other evidence
[16:33.160 --> 16:36.160]  Then all of the anomalies
[16:36.160 --> 16:38.160]  And hijackers train at U.S. military bases
[16:38.160 --> 16:40.160]  And heads of embassies reporting on this show
[16:40.160 --> 16:42.160]  That they wouldn't let Mohammed Atta
[16:42.160 --> 16:44.160]  And other supposed hijackers back in the country
[16:44.160 --> 16:47.160]  From Al-Qaeda summits in Malaysia
[16:47.160 --> 16:49.160]  And Afghanistan and they'd be ordered
[16:49.160 --> 16:52.160]  To let them in
[16:52.160 --> 16:55.160]  Their terrorist files are only CIA covers
[16:55.160 --> 16:56.160]  And then we have them trained
[16:56.160 --> 16:58.160]  At Pensacola Naval Air Station
[16:58.160 --> 16:59.160]  And the Defense Language School
[16:59.160 --> 17:00.160]  Monterey, California
[17:00.160 --> 17:02.160]  And the heads of the schools go public
[17:02.160 --> 17:05.160]  In horror and start reporting on it
[17:05.160 --> 17:07.160]  Then we have the anthrax attack
[17:07.160 --> 17:08.160]  That turned out to be a U.S. weaponized
[17:08.160 --> 17:10.160]  Super weaponized version
[17:10.160 --> 17:13.160]  Coated and bentonite
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.160]  A hundred million dollar process
[17:17.160 --> 17:19.160]  They try to frame innocent people
[17:19.160 --> 17:21.160]  And then it links directly back to
[17:21.160 --> 17:22.160]  Who they admit was a known
[17:22.160 --> 17:25.160]  Massad agent working in Fort Dietrich
[17:25.160 --> 17:26.160]  Who even after he was fired
[17:26.160 --> 17:29.160]  Right before 9-11 broke back into Dietrich
[17:29.160 --> 17:31.160]  And reportedly stole anthrax
[17:31.160 --> 17:33.160]  Mainstream news and the White House
[17:33.160 --> 17:39.160]  On Cypro, the anthrax fighting antibiotic
[17:39.160 --> 17:42.160]  On September 10th, close to a month
[17:42.160 --> 17:47.160]  Before the first anthrax letters were mailed
[17:47.160 --> 17:50.160]  Five weeks before the deaths began
[17:50.160 --> 17:54.160]  The illnesses and deaths
[17:54.160 --> 17:55.160]  You know, to see Bermas' new film
[17:55.160 --> 17:56.160]  He's putting together, it's got the press
[17:56.160 --> 17:57.160]  Conversions with Ari Fleischer
[17:57.160 --> 17:58.160]  Press Secretary admitting it all
[17:58.160 --> 18:00.160]  And just saying it's no big deal
[18:00.160 --> 18:02.160]  All of this and thousands of other pieces
[18:02.160 --> 18:04.160]  We don't have time to cover here today
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.160]  And go over with you
[18:08.160 --> 18:13.160]  But here is the new information
[18:13.160 --> 18:15.160]  And there's a bunch of other information
[18:15.160 --> 18:17.160]  I'm going to cover after we get into this
[18:17.160 --> 18:19.160]  Like the White House memo
[18:19.160 --> 18:21.160]  Which the White House admits is accurate
[18:21.160 --> 18:23.160]  And is still seeking to prosecute
[18:23.160 --> 18:24.160]  Along with British intelligence
[18:24.160 --> 18:25.160]  Whoever released it
[18:25.160 --> 18:27.160]  The White House memo
[18:27.160 --> 18:28.160]  Where the British were taking down
[18:28.160 --> 18:29.160]  Notes of Bush telling Blair
[18:29.160 --> 18:31.160]  We've got to stage some event
[18:31.160 --> 18:33.160]  To go into Iraq on the eve of that war
[18:33.160 --> 18:35.160]  Let's paint U.S. aircraft like U.N. planes
[18:35.160 --> 18:37.160]  Fly them low and hope some of us
[18:37.160 --> 18:38.160]  Shoot at them
[18:38.160 --> 18:40.160]  And then claim they fired at them
[18:40.160 --> 18:41.160]  As a pretext
[18:41.160 --> 18:43.160]  Well, this is far worse
[18:43.160 --> 18:45.160]  Headline, infowars.com
[18:45.160 --> 18:47.160]  Get it out to everybody now
[18:47.160 --> 18:51.160]  Shaney Neocons considered killing Americans
[18:51.160 --> 18:54.160]  In pretext to attack Iran
[18:54.160 --> 18:56.160]  And this dovetails with the tapes
[18:56.160 --> 18:58.160]  Released four months ago
[18:58.160 --> 19:00.160]  We're going to play today
[19:00.160 --> 19:02.160]  Of Donald Rumsfeld
[19:02.160 --> 19:05.160]  Talking to top generals
[19:05.160 --> 19:08.160]  In a meeting with former top generals
[19:08.160 --> 19:10.160]  The Gang of Six
[19:10.160 --> 19:12.160]  Who were the major, quote, military analysts
[19:12.160 --> 19:15.160]  For the news
[19:15.160 --> 19:17.160]  Saying we need another 9-11
[19:17.160 --> 19:18.160]  A bigger one
[19:18.160 --> 19:20.160]  Or the people aren't going to support
[19:20.160 --> 19:23.160]  The wars and what we're doing
[19:23.160 --> 19:25.160]  But the new information
[19:25.160 --> 19:27.160]  Shaney Neocons considered killing Americans
[19:27.160 --> 19:31.160]  In pretext to attack Iran
[19:31.160 --> 19:33.160]  And it stated
[19:33.160 --> 19:37.160]  Sy Hirsch, White House sources confirmed
[19:37.160 --> 19:39.160]  They planned to dress up Navy SEALs
[19:39.160 --> 19:41.160]  Like Iranians, build boats
[19:41.160 --> 19:44.160]  Identical to the blue Iranian patrol boats
[19:44.160 --> 19:46.160]  And have the Navy SEALs
[19:46.160 --> 19:50.160]  Attack U.S. ships
[19:50.160 --> 19:53.160]  In the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz
[19:53.160 --> 19:55.160]  We'll be right back with all the details

[21:03.160 --> 21:06.160]  I've come with a message of information
[21:06.160 --> 21:08.160]  9-11 was an inside job
[21:08.160 --> 21:10.160]  You like being a puppet, sir
[21:10.160 --> 21:12.160]  You like being a puppet from the New World Order
[21:12.160 --> 21:13.160]  How do the American people know
[21:13.160 --> 21:15.160]  That 9-11 was a stage
[21:15.160 --> 21:17.160]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller
[21:17.160 --> 21:19.160]  The Thrallateral Commission, the CAF
[21:19.160 --> 21:21.160]  We sit down and shout out
[21:21.160 --> 21:23.160]  The day that we stop asking questions
[21:23.160 --> 21:25.160]  Is the day that we have allowed the seeds
[21:25.160 --> 21:27.160]  Of despotism to grow at our own door
[21:27.160 --> 21:29.160]  Seven years after the attacks
[21:29.160 --> 21:31.160]  Of September 11
[21:31.160 --> 21:33.160]  A global awakening has taken place
[21:33.160 --> 21:35.160]  An inside job
[21:35.160 --> 21:37.160]  How dare you
[21:40.160 --> 21:42.160]  If you know that there's treason going on
[21:42.160 --> 21:44.160]  You can be held accountable for treason yourself
[21:44.160 --> 21:47.160]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[21:47.160 --> 21:49.160]  The government has not told the truth
[21:49.160 --> 21:51.160]  In five years we will be here
[21:51.160 --> 21:53.160]  On the tenth anniversary of 9-11
[22:01.160 --> 22:03.160]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest
[22:03.160 --> 22:06.160]  Due to inflammation of the arterial walls

[23:37.160 --> 23:40.160]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[23:40.160 --> 23:42.160]  No way, most people don't realize
[23:42.160 --> 23:44.160]  They even have chips in their credit cards and passports
[23:44.160 --> 23:47.160]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves

[24:08.160 --> 24:10.160]  The information war continues
[24:10.160 --> 24:14.160]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[24:20.160 --> 24:22.160]  Dick Cheney in a White House
[24:22.160 --> 24:25.160]  Meeting in a war conference
[24:25.160 --> 24:27.160]  Now while
[24:27.160 --> 24:29.160]  Called for among many other things
[24:29.160 --> 24:32.160]  That Cy Hersh has decided to not tell the public
[24:32.160 --> 24:34.160]  And I demand
[24:34.160 --> 24:37.160]  That Cy Hersh, who has an impeccable record
[24:37.160 --> 24:39.160]  But I'm outraged by the fact that he isn't
[24:39.160 --> 24:42.160]  Releasing the other things they said they were planning
[24:42.160 --> 24:45.160]  Cheney proposed
[24:45.160 --> 24:47.160]  Killing other Americans
[24:47.160 --> 24:49.160]  Attacking U.S. naval ships
[24:49.160 --> 24:51.160]  Now remember, this was proposed
[24:51.160 --> 24:55.160]  He says we're going to play the tape in the next segment
[24:55.160 --> 24:57.160]  And remember, right around this time
[24:57.160 --> 24:59.160]  He did release a new story that they were planning
[24:59.160 --> 25:01.160]  Some type of stage gulf of Tonkin
[25:01.160 --> 25:03.160]  In the Strait of Hormuz with our ships
[25:03.160 --> 25:05.160]  But didn't say what
[25:05.160 --> 25:07.160]  He has an absolute obligation
[25:07.160 --> 25:09.160]  With his White House sources
[25:09.160 --> 25:11.160]  Which he has, going back to Vietnam
[25:11.160 --> 25:13.160]  Because we have people on the inside
[25:13.160 --> 25:15.160]  People say, well something this big and this evil
[25:15.160 --> 25:17.160]  Would leak out, it would come out
[25:17.160 --> 25:19.160]  It has. Why do you think the NSA
[25:19.160 --> 25:21.160]  Really quote accidentally declassified
[25:21.160 --> 25:23.160]  Northwoods in April of
[25:23.160 --> 25:25.160]  2001
[25:25.160 --> 25:27.160]  Months before
[25:27.160 --> 25:29.160]  9-11
[25:29.160 --> 25:31.160]  So ABC News
[25:31.160 --> 25:33.160]  And the Baltimore Sun could report
[25:33.160 --> 25:35.160]  Headline U.S.
[25:35.160 --> 25:37.160]  Government planned to terrorize and attack
[25:37.160 --> 25:39.160]  U.S. cities as pretext for war
[25:41.160 --> 25:43.160]  That was the Baltimore Sun headline
[25:43.160 --> 25:45.160]  The ABC was similar
[25:45.160 --> 25:47.160]  Why do you think the Navy
[25:47.160 --> 25:49.160]  Had the intelligence the day before 9-11
[25:51.160 --> 25:53.160]  In the Washington Post
[25:53.160 --> 25:55.160]  Of all places
[25:55.160 --> 25:57.160]  Basically a government organ said
[25:57.160 --> 25:59.160]  Israel may stage terror attacks
[25:59.160 --> 26:01.160]  In the United States
[26:01.160 --> 26:03.160]  Or against U.S. interest as a pretext
[26:03.160 --> 26:05.160]  To launch a larger war in the Middle East
[26:05.160 --> 26:07.160]  Against Iraq, Iran and Syria
[26:09.160 --> 26:11.160]  They are warning you
[26:11.160 --> 26:13.160]  There are good people in government
[26:13.160 --> 26:15.160]  It is coming out
[26:15.160 --> 26:17.160]  It is being reported on
[26:21.160 --> 26:23.160]  It's not being kept secret
[26:25.160 --> 26:27.160]  And Sy Hirsch says because
[26:27.160 --> 26:29.160]  The White House decided to not go
[26:29.160 --> 26:31.160]  And because the Pentagon
[26:31.160 --> 26:33.160]  Did not like the plan of killing their own soldiers
[26:35.160 --> 26:37.160]  That the plan was not carried out
[26:37.160 --> 26:39.160]  And so Sy Hirsch
[26:39.160 --> 26:41.160]  Didn't write a story
[26:41.160 --> 26:43.160]  About it for New Yorker magazine
[26:43.160 --> 26:45.160]  That in and of itself is outrageous
[26:45.160 --> 26:47.160]  But that's a secondary issue
[26:47.160 --> 26:49.160]  All of the targets
[26:49.160 --> 26:51.160]  And all of the terrorist plans
[26:51.160 --> 26:53.160]  Need to be released now
[26:53.160 --> 26:55.160]  Doesn't Sy Hirsch know
[26:55.160 --> 26:57.160]  That if they carry out any of the plans
[26:57.160 --> 26:59.160]  Cheney has laid
[26:59.160 --> 27:01.160]  That they will go after Sy Hirsch
[27:01.160 --> 27:03.160]  And will obviously know which source
[27:03.160 --> 27:05.160]  And the White House told him this
[27:05.160 --> 27:07.160]  And will kill them both
[27:07.160 --> 27:09.160]  They'll both have automobile accidents
[27:09.160 --> 27:11.160]  Do they have any idea
[27:13.160 --> 27:15.160]  How much danger they're in
[27:17.160 --> 27:19.160]  Well I think that's why
[27:19.160 --> 27:21.160]  Sy Hirsch at a major media conference
[27:21.160 --> 27:23.160]  Days ago
[27:23.160 --> 27:25.160]  Said this in front of news cameras
[27:25.160 --> 27:27.160]  And then it hit YouTube
[27:27.160 --> 27:29.160]  And then Think Progress did a story on it
[27:31.160 --> 27:33.160]  This is massive
[27:33.160 --> 27:35.160]  They plan to have Navy SEALs
[27:35.160 --> 27:37.160]  Cheney wanted to
[27:37.160 --> 27:39.160]  Hurdly build identical boats
[27:39.160 --> 27:41.160]  Blue
[27:43.160 --> 27:45.160]  PT jet boats
[27:47.160 --> 27:49.160]  Commando boats
[27:51.160 --> 27:53.160]  Which look like the Iranian boats
[27:53.160 --> 27:55.160]  Launch a Navy SEAL operation
[27:57.160 --> 27:59.160]  To have them come up and engage
[27:59.160 --> 28:01.160]  In a firefight and engage
[28:01.160 --> 28:03.160]  U.S. naval
[28:03.160 --> 28:05.160]  Craft
[28:09.160 --> 28:11.160]  And we're in such a culture
[28:11.160 --> 28:13.160]  Of evil and decadence
[28:13.160 --> 28:15.160]  That Sy Hirsch can just calmly report
[28:15.160 --> 28:17.160]  Foregone conclusion
[28:17.160 --> 28:19.160]  That oh yeah
[28:19.160 --> 28:21.160]  This was being planned in a meeting
[28:21.160 --> 28:23.160]  In the White House
[28:23.160 --> 28:25.160]  And we decided
[28:25.160 --> 28:27.160]  Not to report on it
[28:27.160 --> 28:29.160]  But we did decide to put a report out
[28:29.160 --> 28:31.160]  Saying they were planning some type of Gulf of Tonkin
[28:31.160 --> 28:33.160]  We needed the details then
[28:33.160 --> 28:35.160]  Buddy, we could have already been into World War 3
[28:35.160 --> 28:37.160]  They could launch it any day
[28:37.160 --> 28:39.160]  Sy Hirsch
[28:41.160 --> 28:43.160]  And
[28:43.160 --> 28:45.160]  The New Yorker magazine needs to be called
[28:45.160 --> 28:47.160]  Sy Hirsch needs to have pressure put on him
[28:47.160 --> 28:49.160]  I'm going to call people I know that know Sy Hirsch
[28:49.160 --> 28:51.160]  And I'm going to try to have them put pressure on him
[28:51.160 --> 28:53.160]  And call him in his home
[28:57.160 --> 28:59.160]  People like Gore Vidal
[28:59.160 --> 29:01.160]  We need to have somebody who's a former Navy SEAL
[29:01.160 --> 29:03.160]  Jesse Ventura
[29:03.160 --> 29:05.160]  I'm going to call him today
[29:05.160 --> 29:07.160]  I don't think he's back in town yet
[29:07.160 --> 29:09.160]  But I'm going to call him
[29:09.160 --> 29:11.160]  I don't have a cell phone, I don't have his home number
[29:11.160 --> 29:13.160]  And say hey this affects you
[29:13.160 --> 29:15.160]  Try to get him on as soon as possible
[29:15.160 --> 29:17.160]  I wanted to have him on as he's probably going to be coming to town for this event
[29:17.160 --> 29:19.160]  We're setting up the next three months
[29:19.160 --> 29:21.160]  I wanted to have him on right before that
[29:21.160 --> 29:23.160]  But this is a good reason to have Ventura on
[29:23.160 --> 29:25.160]  Maybe that can get attention
[29:25.160 --> 29:27.160]  If Ventura comes out and talks about this
[29:27.160 --> 29:29.160]  Because of this show
[29:29.160 --> 29:31.160]  The AM and FM affiliates
[29:31.160 --> 29:33.160]  We're on need to be doing news reports on this themselves
[29:33.160 --> 29:35.160]  This is a big deal
[29:35.160 --> 29:37.160]  This is a smoking gun
[29:37.160 --> 29:39.160]  This isn't Northwoods that's decades old
[29:39.160 --> 29:41.160]  This is now
[29:41.160 --> 29:43.160]  This is happening now
[29:43.160 --> 29:45.160]  They could pull this any day
[29:45.160 --> 29:47.160]  This is life and death
[29:47.160 --> 29:49.160]  We'll come back and break this down and we'll get back

[32:01.160 --> 32:03.160]  See website for details
[32:03.160 --> 32:05.160]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste
[32:05.160 --> 32:07.160]  Was the likely cause of my painful joints
[32:07.160 --> 32:09.160]  Lack of energy and weight gain
[32:09.160 --> 32:11.160]  I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet
[32:11.160 --> 32:13.160]  But it just seems so difficult
[32:13.160 --> 32:15.160]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer
[32:15.160 --> 32:17.160]  From SnyderHealth.com
[32:17.160 --> 32:19.160]  I changed my body even before I changed my diet
[32:19.160 --> 32:21.160]  By drinking alkaline ionized water
[32:21.160 --> 32:23.160]  Drinking water?
[32:23.160 --> 32:25.160]  Now that's something I can handle
[32:25.160 --> 32:27.160]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain
[32:27.160 --> 32:29.160]  All of the different options and helped me choose
[32:29.160 --> 32:31.160]  The ionizer that was right for me
[32:31.160 --> 32:33.160]  I used my new Jupiter ionizer for everything
[32:33.160 --> 32:35.160]  For drinking, for cooking
[32:35.160 --> 32:37.160]  And since I've been drinking the water
[32:37.160 --> 32:39.160]  I have more energy, my joint pains are gone
[32:39.160 --> 32:41.160]  And I already lost 7 pounds
[32:41.160 --> 32:43.160]  And my skin looks great
[32:43.160 --> 32:45.160]  Give them a call today
[32:45.160 --> 32:47.160]  To find out which ionizer is right for you

[32:57.160 --> 33:15.160]  That's SnyderHealth.com
[33:43.160 --> 33:45.160]  Think of the magnitude
[33:45.160 --> 33:47.160]  They really staged 9-11
[33:47.160 --> 33:49.160]  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
[33:49.160 --> 33:51.160]  They really did it
[33:51.160 --> 33:55.160]  Everybody knows the captain lies
[33:55.160 --> 33:57.160]  Do you realize in your psyche
[34:01.160 --> 34:03.160]  How serious it is to have a world government
[34:03.160 --> 34:05.160]  Elite who are totally ruthless
[34:05.160 --> 34:07.160]  And will kill their own slaves
[34:07.160 --> 34:09.160]  Their own minions just like that
[34:11.160 --> 34:13.160]  Like they'd
[34:15.160 --> 34:17.160]  Like they'd take their dog for a walk
[34:17.160 --> 34:21.160]  It just means nothing to them
[34:23.160 --> 34:25.160]  infowars.com
[34:25.160 --> 34:27.160]  I need Steve Watson to write another big detailed article
[34:27.160 --> 34:29.160]  A call to action breaking down the points
[34:29.160 --> 34:31.160]  I've made and the other points he has
[34:31.160 --> 34:33.160]  I need Paul Watson to do stories
[34:33.160 --> 34:35.160]  I need all of you, I don't need other radio host
[34:35.160 --> 34:37.160]  To even post
[34:37.160 --> 34:39.160]  Or cover infowars.com
[34:39.160 --> 34:41.160]  Story
[34:41.160 --> 34:43.160]  I know a lot of people out there
[34:43.160 --> 34:45.160]  It's about who the big dog is on the block
[34:45.160 --> 34:47.160]  Who won't cover anything I cover
[34:47.160 --> 34:49.160]  On their radio shows, their websites
[34:49.160 --> 34:51.160]  Hey, then you get up off your butts right now
[34:51.160 --> 34:53.160]  You go write a story off of our story
[34:53.160 --> 34:55.160]  Or off of Think Progress' story
[34:55.160 --> 34:57.160]  And you do your own
[34:57.160 --> 34:59.160]  You don't sit around twiddling your thumbs
[34:59.160 --> 35:01.160]  You write one now or you post
[35:01.160 --> 35:03.160]  And you link to infowars.com
[35:03.160 --> 35:05.160]  Because we don't have a future
[35:05.160 --> 35:07.160]  Or you link to Think Progress
[35:07.160 --> 35:09.160]  I don't care
[35:09.160 --> 35:11.160]  You get it up now
[35:11.160 --> 35:13.160]  And you talk about it
[35:13.160 --> 35:15.160]  To everyone
[35:15.160 --> 35:17.160]  How far have we come
[35:17.160 --> 35:19.160]  That it's just calmly announced
[35:19.160 --> 35:21.160]  Oh yeah, they were planning
[35:21.160 --> 35:23.160]  These terror attacks, that's who they are
[35:23.160 --> 35:25.160]  I mean of Al-CIA
[35:25.160 --> 35:27.160]  Al-Qaeda or the real Iranian navy
[35:27.160 --> 35:29.160]  Pulled up an open fire
[35:29.160 --> 35:31.160]  With rocket launchers and heavy machine guns
[35:31.160 --> 35:33.160]  On missile cruisers and frigates
[35:33.160 --> 35:35.160]  That would be terrorism
[35:35.160 --> 35:37.160]  But the war that came from that
[35:37.160 --> 35:39.160]  Would be true terrorism
[35:39.160 --> 35:41.160]  Hundreds of sites in Iran being blown to bits
[35:41.160 --> 35:43.160]  Oil exploding
[35:43.160 --> 35:45.160]  You think it was bad at
[35:45.160 --> 35:47.160]  $150 a barrel
[35:47.160 --> 35:49.160]  $125 a barrel right now
[35:49.160 --> 35:51.160]  You think the dollar plunging by 60%
[35:51.160 --> 35:53.160]  So far is bad
[35:53.160 --> 35:55.160]  Every analyst says
[35:55.160 --> 35:57.160]  Oil would at least double
[35:57.160 --> 35:59.160]  For six months, maybe even
[35:59.160 --> 36:01.160]  Go up more, OPEC said it could be
[36:01.160 --> 36:03.160]  Unlimited
[36:03.160 --> 36:05.160]  Shutting down the whole Middle East
[36:05.160 --> 36:07.160]  Sucking us into what could
[36:07.160 --> 36:09.160]  Very easily turn into
[36:09.160 --> 36:11.160]  World War III
[36:11.160 --> 36:13.160]  In fact, to my producers
[36:13.160 --> 36:15.160]  Let's try to get Ray McGovern on today
[36:15.160 --> 36:17.160]  Even when Boogliosi's on
[36:17.160 --> 36:19.160]  Or when Chapman's on
[36:19.160 --> 36:21.160]  I need to get his analysis right now
[36:21.160 --> 36:23.160]  I need to get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts's analysis
[36:23.160 --> 36:25.160]  Because I need to hear
[36:25.160 --> 36:27.160]  What these men, we need to have a council
[36:27.160 --> 36:29.160]  On this because I don't claim
[36:29.160 --> 36:31.160]  To have all the answers and I love
[36:31.160 --> 36:33.160]  To hear the other ideas or the ideas
[36:33.160 --> 36:35.160]  That you listeners have
[36:35.160 --> 36:37.160]  Let's open a thread up on theprisonplanet.com forum
[36:37.160 --> 36:39.160]  About how we get the word out about this
[36:39.160 --> 36:41.160]  What we do about this
[36:41.160 --> 36:43.160]  Imagine if they caught someone else in power
[36:43.160 --> 36:45.160]  Or a corporate chieftain
[36:45.160 --> 36:47.160]  Or the head of the FBI or a governor
[36:47.160 --> 36:49.160]  Openly entertaining
[36:49.160 --> 36:51.160]  Staging attacks on US shipping
[36:51.160 --> 36:53.160]  I mean the FBI
[36:53.160 --> 36:55.160]  Ran a year long program
[36:55.160 --> 36:57.160]  In 19
[36:57.160 --> 36:59.160]  In 2005, 2006
[36:59.160 --> 37:01.160]  From the middle of 2005
[37:01.160 --> 37:03.160]  In the early 2006
[37:03.160 --> 37:05.160]  Setting up street kids
[37:05.160 --> 37:07.160]  Who they profiled off their
[37:07.160 --> 37:09.160]  Welfare checks in Miami
[37:09.160 --> 37:11.160]  Who were homeless and they gave them
[37:11.160 --> 37:13.160]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars
[37:13.160 --> 37:15.160]  They weren't even Muslim to dress in military uniforms
[37:15.160 --> 37:17.160]  And to go videotape FBI buildings
[37:17.160 --> 37:19.160]  The FBI led them
[37:19.160 --> 37:21.160]  And it was a big international scare
[37:21.160 --> 37:23.160]  An army was going to destroy everything
[37:23.160 --> 37:25.160]  They caught the FBI in 1998
[37:25.160 --> 37:27.160]  Mom's Steer Award in Texas
[37:27.160 --> 37:29.160]  Monthly, they got the award
[37:29.160 --> 37:31.160]  For being bad guys for the year
[37:31.160 --> 37:33.160]  For creating a clan group
[37:33.160 --> 37:35.160]  Out of nothing and trying to get them
[37:35.160 --> 37:37.160]  To blow up chemical plants
[37:37.160 --> 37:39.160]  The FBI led the clan group
[37:39.160 --> 37:41.160]  You see, they're all
[37:41.160 --> 37:43.160]  Involved in this
[37:43.160 --> 37:45.160]  Is the average FBI agent who's investigating bank robbery
[37:45.160 --> 37:47.160]  And money laundering a terrorist?
[37:47.160 --> 37:49.160]  No, but their anti-terror units
[37:49.160 --> 37:51.160]  And their intelligence units are
[37:51.160 --> 37:53.160]  Terrorists and are involved
[37:53.160 --> 37:55.160]  In terror attacks and provocateur
[37:55.160 --> 37:57.160]  Actions and you think I like
[37:57.160 --> 37:59.160]  Having to come on air and go toe to toe
[37:59.160 --> 38:01.160]  Up against hardcore mafia killers
[38:01.160 --> 38:03.160]  You think it's fun?
[38:03.160 --> 38:05.160]  This is life and death, ladies and gentlemen
[38:05.160 --> 38:07.160]  And frankly, for my own safety
[38:07.160 --> 38:09.160]  I don't need to be the only
[38:09.160 --> 38:11.160]  Website and the only person saying
[38:11.160 --> 38:13.160]  What is
[38:13.160 --> 38:15.160]  Common sense to do
[38:15.160 --> 38:17.160]  And that is demand
[38:17.160 --> 38:19.160]  I mean, all
[38:19.160 --> 38:21.160]  Sighersh into court if we need to
[38:21.160 --> 38:23.160]  And have it brought out right now
[38:23.160 --> 38:25.160]  What the other targets are
[38:25.160 --> 38:27.160]  And what the other terrorist plans are
[38:27.160 --> 38:29.160]  Because let me tell you something
[38:29.160 --> 38:31.160]  Some 14 to 18 year old
[38:31.160 --> 38:33.160]  Street kids in Miami
[38:33.160 --> 38:35.160]  Aren't a threat
[38:35.160 --> 38:37.160]  Some clan group
[38:37.160 --> 38:39.160]  Who over a two year period
[38:39.160 --> 38:41.160]  The FBI couldn't even get to buy guns
[38:41.160 --> 38:43.160]  They were so ridiculous
[38:43.160 --> 38:45.160]  And so alcoholic
[38:45.160 --> 38:47.160]  That's not a threat, but let me tell you
[38:47.160 --> 38:49.160]  The Vice President of the United States
[38:49.160 --> 38:51.160]  Backed up by British intelligence
[38:51.160 --> 38:53.160]  And Mossad and criminal elements of defense
[38:53.160 --> 38:55.160]  Intelligence and private corporations
[38:55.160 --> 38:57.160]  And private defense contractors
[38:57.160 --> 38:59.160]  They are dangerous
[38:59.160 --> 39:01.160]  They're real dangerous
[39:01.160 --> 39:03.160]  And they are planning to stage
[39:03.160 --> 39:05.160]  Some type of terror attack in the Middle East
[39:05.160 --> 39:07.160]  Or in the United States
[39:07.160 --> 39:09.160]  But all the intelligence sources
[39:09.160 --> 39:11.160]  The former White House historians and analysts
[39:11.160 --> 39:13.160]  We've had on, like Richard C. Cook
[39:13.160 --> 39:15.160]  And the former CIA top analyst
[39:15.160 --> 39:17.160]  And briefed Ronald Reagan and George Bush
[39:17.160 --> 39:19.160]  Senior fighting for his life right now
[39:19.160 --> 39:21.160]  Against cancer, who still comes on this show
[39:21.160 --> 39:23.160]  Ray McGovern and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[39:23.160 --> 39:25.160]  Former head of the Treasury
[39:25.160 --> 39:27.160]  All of these experts
[39:27.160 --> 39:29.160]  And there's many others we've had on
[39:29.160 --> 39:31.160]  Vincent Bugliosi
[39:31.160 --> 39:33.160]  And many others have all
[39:33.160 --> 39:35.160]  Ron Paul, the congressman
[39:35.160 --> 39:37.160]  They have all said, and Congressman Dan Hamburg
[39:37.160 --> 39:39.160]  We had on a few days ago
[39:39.160 --> 39:41.160]  Have all said, attacking our ships
[39:41.160 --> 39:43.160]  Is the number one thing
[39:43.160 --> 39:45.160]  They're planning to do
[39:45.160 --> 39:47.160]  From sources they've got on Capitol Hill
[39:49.160 --> 39:51.160]  And they've already tried it once
[39:51.160 --> 39:53.160]  With that fake radio transmission
[39:53.160 --> 39:55.160]  And zooming in with their cameras
[39:55.160 --> 39:57.160]  A mile and a half away to Iranian boats
[39:57.160 --> 39:59.160]  Claiming they were threatening to blow the ships up
[40:03.160 --> 40:05.160]  How on earth can Sy Hirsch
[40:05.160 --> 40:07.160]  Just calmly sit around
[40:07.160 --> 40:09.160]  Talking about how, yeah, they were planning
[40:09.160 --> 40:11.160]  This attack and other attacks
[40:11.160 --> 40:13.160]  But we decided to not report on it
[40:13.160 --> 40:15.160]  Because they decided to not carry out the attacks
[40:15.160 --> 40:17.160]  That was just Dick Cheney in front of
[40:17.160 --> 40:19.160]  Larger groups of his staff
[40:19.160 --> 40:21.160]  And the Pentagon generals in a meeting
[40:21.160 --> 40:23.160]  Throwing it out there
[40:23.160 --> 40:25.160]  Seeing who would bite
[40:25.160 --> 40:27.160]  Who would like it to recruit more people into it
[40:27.160 --> 40:29.160]  Just like they went into JFK
[40:29.160 --> 40:31.160]  In 1962
[40:31.160 --> 40:33.160]  An L.L. Lemonser
[40:33.160 --> 40:35.160]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[40:35.160 --> 40:37.160]  JFK had doubled the size of the military
[40:37.160 --> 40:39.160]  In just a few years
[40:39.160 --> 40:41.160]  He had, that has doubled their funding
[40:41.160 --> 40:43.160]  He was a hawk, he believed in a strong military
[40:43.160 --> 40:45.160]  He was a veteran, highly decorated on a
[40:45.160 --> 40:47.160]  Little attack boat
[40:47.160 --> 40:49.160]  In the South Pacific almost died
[40:49.160 --> 40:51.160]  He wanted to go into Vietnam
[40:51.160 --> 40:53.160]  He was there in covert operations
[40:53.160 --> 40:55.160]  And they came to him and said, we want to hijack jets
[40:55.160 --> 40:57.160]  By remote control, fly them into things
[40:57.160 --> 40:59.160]  Bomb DC, bomb Miami, shoot US citizens
[40:59.160 --> 41:01.160]  Grab Patsy's Claim Communist
[41:01.160 --> 41:03.160]  You're doing it, and basically have World War 3
[41:03.160 --> 41:05.160]  And he said, and we're not going to do it
[41:05.160 --> 41:07.160]  And they started threatening him
[41:07.160 --> 41:09.160]  This has all come out
[41:09.160 --> 41:11.160]  Mainstream news, front line, you name it
[41:11.160 --> 41:13.160]  And he said, that's it
[41:13.160 --> 41:15.160]  The head of the CIA, you're fired
[41:15.160 --> 41:17.160]  L.L. Lemonser, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff
[41:17.160 --> 41:19.160]  You're fired
[41:19.160 --> 41:21.160]  We are not going to blow up our own ships
[41:21.160 --> 41:23.160]  Like the main again, that's in there
[41:23.160 --> 41:25.160]  We are not going to bomb DC
[41:25.160 --> 41:27.160]  We are not going to attack Marine Corps bases
[41:27.160 --> 41:29.160]  With Army troops dressed up like foreigners
[41:29.160 --> 41:31.160]  And kill US soldiers
[41:31.160 --> 41:33.160]  We are not going to
[41:33.160 --> 41:35.160]  Blow astronauts up
[41:35.160 --> 41:37.160]  And blame it on the Soviets
[41:37.160 --> 41:39.160]  We are not going to do any of these horrible things
[41:39.160 --> 41:41.160]  You are fired, fired, fired, fired
[41:41.160 --> 41:43.160]  And he fired scores of people
[41:43.160 --> 41:45.160]  He called them into his office
[41:45.160 --> 41:47.160]  And he said, you are fired
[41:47.160 --> 41:49.160]  And they said, no, you're fired
[41:49.160 --> 41:51.160]  And blew his head off in Dallas, Texas
[41:53.160 --> 41:55.160]  And took his body with his brains
[41:55.160 --> 41:57.160]  All blown out to Parkland and sewed him up
[41:57.160 --> 41:59.160]  And put him on a coffin and flew him back to DC
[42:07.160 --> 42:09.160]  And they put every one of those people
[42:09.160 --> 42:11.160]  Including the CIA Director's brother
[42:11.160 --> 42:15.160]  Who was the police chief in power
[42:19.160 --> 42:21.160]  And it makes me so angry
[42:21.160 --> 42:23.160]  To know there's so many cowardly people
[42:23.160 --> 42:25.160]  On the comments section
[42:25.160 --> 42:27.160]  Of the infowars.com story
[42:27.160 --> 42:29.160]  Cheney neocons considered killing Americans
[42:29.160 --> 42:31.160]  And pretext to attack Iran
[42:31.160 --> 42:33.160]  These neocons are in there laughing and cackling
[42:33.160 --> 42:35.160]  And in other sections
[42:35.160 --> 42:37.160]  I've seen them commenting, this is a great thing
[42:37.160 --> 42:39.160]  Big deal, we need to attack Iran
[42:39.160 --> 42:41.160]  That's how the military gets things done
[42:41.160 --> 42:43.160]  And you follow back their handles
[42:43.160 --> 42:45.160]  And you see their MySpace accounts
[42:45.160 --> 42:47.160]  And they're in the military
[42:47.160 --> 42:49.160]  That sick 25% that thinks this is cute
[42:49.160 --> 42:51.160]  Don't you understand your pawns too
[42:51.160 --> 42:53.160]  But that's a military idea
[42:55.160 --> 42:57.160]  You ever seen Braveheart where they got the battle going
[42:57.160 --> 42:59.160]  And that section of it is accurate to history
[42:59.160 --> 43:01.160]  Where the king sends in his own troops
[43:01.160 --> 43:03.160]  And there's a battle going on
[43:03.160 --> 43:05.160]  And he says, just aim
[43:05.160 --> 43:07.160]  Aim down at that area
[43:07.160 --> 43:09.160]  Right there, aim at the main battlefield
[43:09.160 --> 43:11.160]  And they said, but Sire, we'll hit our
[43:11.160 --> 43:13.160]  We'll hit our own troops
[43:13.160 --> 43:15.160]  And he said, but we'll hit some of theirs as well
[43:15.160 --> 43:17.160]  You see, it's that military brass idea
[43:17.160 --> 43:19.160]  Which they're taught at West Point
[43:21.160 --> 43:23.160]  Where if you need to sacrifice 100
[43:23.160 --> 43:25.160]  500, 1,000, 10,000 of your troops
[43:25.160 --> 43:27.160]  To draw an enemy in
[43:27.160 --> 43:29.160]  To make them think they've got overwhelming odds
[43:29.160 --> 43:31.160]  To draw your enemy onto a field
[43:31.160 --> 43:33.160]  So you can have two armies behind the hill
[43:33.160 --> 43:35.160]  That they're going to roll over and crush them
[43:35.160 --> 43:37.160]  But you know it's going to sacrifice
[43:37.160 --> 43:39.160]  Thousands of your own troops
[43:39.160 --> 43:41.160]  It's called a pawn sacrifice
[43:41.160 --> 43:43.160]  I play chess, do you play chess?
[43:43.160 --> 43:45.160]  It's a sacrifice of a pawn
[43:45.160 --> 43:47.160]  To get
[43:47.160 --> 43:49.160]  Check and then checkmate
[43:49.160 --> 43:51.160]  And they have us in check right now
[43:51.160 --> 43:53.160]  But
[43:55.160 --> 43:57.160]  Unlike the game chess
[43:57.160 --> 43:59.160]  The real world lets you move into checkmate
[43:59.160 --> 44:01.160]  And American people don't move into checkmate
[44:01.160 --> 44:03.160]  And American people don't move into checkmate
[44:03.160 --> 44:05.160]  Don't destroy yourselves
[44:05.160 --> 44:07.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, in fact
[44:07.160 --> 44:09.160]  Move out of check
[44:09.160 --> 44:11.160]  In fact, we've got to move right now
[44:11.160 --> 44:13.160]  That can take down the new world order
[44:13.160 --> 44:15.160]  And we'll just start playing chess
[44:15.160 --> 44:17.160]  The American people can't even play
[44:17.160 --> 44:19.160]  Checkers
[44:23.160 --> 44:25.160]  And folks
[44:25.160 --> 44:27.160]  People always ask all day if this is all true
[44:27.160 --> 44:29.160]  Why are you still alive?
[44:29.160 --> 44:31.160]  I mean, they don't want to take a big yellow highlighter
[44:31.160 --> 44:33.160]  And take every word I've ever said
[44:33.160 --> 44:35.160]  And highlight it
[44:35.160 --> 44:37.160]  And have it emblazoned
[44:37.160 --> 44:39.160]  That Alex Jones was right
[44:39.160 --> 44:41.160]  They don't want to stick a big fat
[44:41.160 --> 44:43.160]  Exclamation point at the end of my name
[44:43.160 --> 44:45.160]  But that doesn't mean they don't kill people, folks
[44:45.160 --> 44:47.160]  And that's why I get so angry too
[44:47.160 --> 44:49.160]  Because I've risked my life for this
[44:49.160 --> 44:51.160]  And I know a lot of you have as well
[44:51.160 --> 44:53.160]  And I expect people to take these type of major issues
[44:53.160 --> 44:55.160]  Seriously
[44:55.160 --> 44:57.160]  I mean, when we've got Gary Hart coming out
[44:57.160 --> 44:59.160]  And saying the U.S. government stages attacks
[44:59.160 --> 45:01.160]  And May stage one and I ran
[45:01.160 --> 45:03.160]  And official public letters in newspapers
[45:03.160 --> 45:05.160]  Published
[45:05.160 --> 45:07.160]  If we've got neocons running around
[45:07.160 --> 45:09.160]  Publishing stuff saying we want more attacks
[45:09.160 --> 45:11.160]  And boy, they're great
[45:11.160 --> 45:13.160]  And we've got all these tapes of Rumsfeld with the generals
[45:13.160 --> 45:15.160]  Saying we need another attack
[45:15.160 --> 45:17.160]  And then we've got Cheney planning it
[45:17.160 --> 45:19.160]  And then Sy Hersh can say, oh
[45:19.160 --> 45:21.160]  That was four months ago, I decided not to write a report on that
[45:21.160 --> 45:23.160]  As much as I like Sy Hersh
[45:23.160 --> 45:25.160]  Who told us five years ago that
[45:25.160 --> 45:27.160]  U.S. Special Forces were in Iran
[45:27.160 --> 45:29.160]  Now the White House admits it, staging terror attacks
[45:29.160 --> 45:31.160]  Everything he said back to Nom has been accurate
[45:33.160 --> 45:35.160]  And I want to know on what planet
[45:35.160 --> 45:37.160]  Sy Hersh is living
[45:37.160 --> 45:39.160]  And on what planet the New York
[45:39.160 --> 45:41.160]  Magazine is living
[45:41.160 --> 45:43.160]  Where they can decide
[45:43.160 --> 45:45.160]  To not print a story like this
[45:45.160 --> 45:47.160]  When they have the White House sources
[45:47.160 --> 45:49.160]  Let's go ahead and play this incredible audio
[45:49.160 --> 45:51.160]  This audio
[45:51.160 --> 45:53.160]  In the video here
[45:53.160 --> 45:55.160]  Tape of the Campus of Progress Journalism Conference
[45:55.160 --> 45:57.160]  Earlier this month
[45:57.160 --> 45:59.160]  The Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, Symore Hersh
[45:59.160 --> 46:01.160]  Reveals how the neocons
[46:01.160 --> 46:03.160]  Convened around Dick Cheney
[46:03.160 --> 46:05.160]  And brainstorm ways to kick off World War
[46:05.160 --> 46:07.160]  4
[46:07.160 --> 46:09.160]  See the neocons say the Cold War was World War 3
[46:09.160 --> 46:11.160]  So we properly call it what they call it
[46:11.160 --> 46:13.160]  As they finally call their pet project
[46:13.160 --> 46:15.160]  To take out the Muslims in foment
[46:15.160 --> 46:17.160]  They contrived a clash of civilizations
[46:17.160 --> 46:19.160]  That's getting us into a fight folks
[46:19.160 --> 46:21.160]  We can't get out of
[46:21.160 --> 46:23.160]  According to Hersh, this meeting occurred
[46:23.160 --> 46:25.160]  After the neocons failed miserably to stage a
[46:25.160 --> 46:27.160]  Rehashed version of the Gulf of Tonkin
[46:27.160 --> 46:29.160]  And sent the Strait of Hormuz, mostly because
[46:29.160 --> 46:31.160]  It is no longer 1964
[46:31.160 --> 46:33.160]  And such big lies, thanks to the internet and bloggers
[46:33.160 --> 46:35.160]  Are far more difficult to float
[46:39.160 --> 46:41.160]  Okay, let's go ahead and play
[46:41.160 --> 46:43.160]  This is him on the stage with a huge conference hall
[46:43.160 --> 46:45.160]  Full of journalists
[46:45.160 --> 46:47.160]  And none of them thought they might want to write
[46:47.160 --> 46:49.160]  An article about this
[46:49.160 --> 46:51.160]  I was wrong, this went on YouTube 3 days ago
[46:51.160 --> 46:53.160]  But this actually was being
[46:53.160 --> 46:55.160]  Leaked out around a couple weeks ago
[46:55.160 --> 46:57.160]  And no mainstream media that was there
[46:57.160 --> 46:59.160]  Thought that this would be newsworthy
[46:59.160 --> 47:01.160]  What you're about to hear, here it is
[47:01.160 --> 47:03.160]  There was a bit at the end of this
[47:03.160 --> 47:05.160]  Latest article that you wrote
[47:05.160 --> 47:07.160]  That I found actually most interesting
[47:07.160 --> 47:09.160]  In the article, hasn't got that much attention
[47:09.160 --> 47:11.160]  But I want to get your take on this
[47:11.160 --> 47:13.160]  And this relates to
[47:13.160 --> 47:15.160]  An incident that happened a couple of months ago
[47:15.160 --> 47:17.160]  Many of you remember it, it was in the Strait of Hormuz
[47:17.160 --> 47:19.160]  There was an incident where
[47:19.160 --> 47:21.160]  An American carrier almost blew
[47:21.160 --> 47:23.160]  A couple of Iranian speed boats out of the water
[47:23.160 --> 47:25.160]  And perhaps would have started
[47:25.160 --> 47:27.160]  The next war
[47:27.160 --> 47:29.160]  A war against Iran, or potentially a World War III
[47:29.160 --> 47:31.160]  And it was averted, thankfully
[47:31.160 --> 47:33.160]  At the last second
[47:33.160 --> 47:35.160]  We later learned that there was really nothing
[47:35.160 --> 47:37.160]  To be terribly concerned about
[47:37.160 --> 47:39.160]  The incident was overblown
[47:39.160 --> 47:41.160]  And that there was a vice admiral
[47:41.160 --> 47:43.160]  Large of the fleet
[47:43.160 --> 47:45.160]  In the Strait of Hormuz who said
[47:45.160 --> 47:47.160]  Basically, there was no concern there
[47:47.160 --> 47:49.160]  That it was overblown
[47:49.160 --> 47:51.160]  The second part, basically
[47:51.160 --> 47:53.160]  Never threatened
[47:53.160 --> 47:55.160]  Never threatened, and you talk about
[47:55.160 --> 47:57.160]  This vice admiral's name
[47:57.160 --> 47:59.160]  Is Kevin Cosgriff
[47:59.160 --> 48:01.160]  In your article you write
[48:01.160 --> 48:03.160]  Nonetheless, Cosgriff's demeanor angered Cheney
[48:03.160 --> 48:05.160]  According to
[48:05.160 --> 48:07.160]  The former senior intelligence official
[48:07.160 --> 48:09.160]  That a lesson was learned in the incident
[48:09.160 --> 48:11.160]  The public had supported the idea
[48:11.160 --> 48:13.160]  Of retaliation and was even asking
[48:13.160 --> 48:15.160]  Why the U.S. didn't do more
[48:15.160 --> 48:17.160]  The former official said
[48:17.160 --> 48:19.160]  That a few weeks later a meeting took place
[48:19.160 --> 48:21.160]  In the vice president's office
[48:21.160 --> 48:23.160]  Quote, the subject was
[48:23.160 --> 48:25.160]  Had to create a cossus berai
[48:25.160 --> 48:27.160]  Between Tehran and Washington
[48:27.160 --> 48:29.160]  He said, what you're writing there
[48:29.160 --> 48:31.160]  Is that Cheney
[48:31.160 --> 48:33.160]  There was a meeting in the White House
[48:33.160 --> 48:35.160]  Where Cheney presided over
[48:35.160 --> 48:37.160]  Looking to cook up the next war
[48:37.160 --> 48:39.160]  A false war
[48:39.160 --> 48:41.160]  Based on false intelligence
[48:41.160 --> 48:43.160]  My oldest son is a lawyer
[48:43.160 --> 48:45.160]  And when I
[48:45.160 --> 48:47.160]  Sent him the story
[48:47.160 --> 48:49.160]  Before it was published
[48:49.160 --> 48:51.160]  Basically in a final form
[48:51.160 --> 48:53.160]  Just a day, and he wrote back
[48:53.160 --> 48:55.160]  And he said, you really buried the lead
[48:55.160 --> 48:57.160]  In this one, but cossus berai
[48:59.160 --> 49:01.160]  How many press are here?
[49:01.160 --> 49:03.160]  Anyway, there was a meeting
[49:03.160 --> 49:05.160]  Among the items
[49:05.160 --> 49:07.160]  Among the items considered
[49:07.160 --> 49:09.160]  And rejected, which is why
[49:09.160 --> 49:11.160]  The New Yorker did not publish it
[49:11.160 --> 49:13.160]  On grounds that it wasn't accepted
[49:13.160 --> 49:15.160]  One of the items was
[49:15.160 --> 49:17.160]  There was a dozen ideas
[49:17.160 --> 49:19.160]  How to trigger a war
[49:19.160 --> 49:21.160]  The one that interested me the most
[49:21.160 --> 49:23.160]  Was, why don't we build
[49:23.160 --> 49:25.160]  We in our shipyard build four or five
[49:25.160 --> 49:27.160]  Our rainboats that look like Iranian PT boats
[49:27.160 --> 49:29.160]  Put Navy SEALs on them
[49:29.160 --> 49:31.160]  With a lot of arms, and the next time
[49:31.160 --> 49:33.160]  One of our boats goes through
[49:33.160 --> 49:35.160]  Start a shoot-up
[49:35.160 --> 49:37.160]  Might call some lives
[49:37.160 --> 49:39.160]  And it was rejected because you can't have Americans
[49:39.160 --> 49:41.160]  Killing Americans, but that's the level of
[49:41.160 --> 49:43.160]  Stuff we were talking about
[49:43.160 --> 49:45.160]  Provocation, but that was rejected
[49:45.160 --> 49:47.160]  So
[49:47.160 --> 49:49.160]  I could understand the argument
[49:49.160 --> 49:51.160]  Of not writing something that was rejected
[49:51.160 --> 49:53.160]  Maybe
[49:53.160 --> 49:55.160]  I basically, my attitude always
[49:55.160 --> 49:57.160]  Towards editors is they're mice trained to be rats
[49:57.160 --> 49:59.160]  So, but
[49:59.160 --> 50:01.160]  But you have to, you have to
[50:01.160 --> 50:03.160]  But the point is
[50:03.160 --> 50:05.160]  J.June, if you know what that means
[50:05.160 --> 50:07.160]  Silly
[50:07.160 --> 50:09.160]  Maybe
[50:09.160 --> 50:11.160]  But potentially very lethal
[50:11.160 --> 50:13.160]  Because one of the things they learned in the incident
[50:13.160 --> 50:15.160]  Was the American public
[50:15.160 --> 50:17.160]  If you get the right
[50:17.160 --> 50:19.160]  Incident, the American public will support
[50:19.160 --> 50:21.160]  Bang bang, kiss kiss
[50:21.160 --> 50:23.160]  We're into it
[50:23.160 --> 50:25.160]  And the public, although that was
[50:25.160 --> 50:27.160]  The other side that had issued that was important
[50:27.160 --> 50:29.160]  What happened in the Gulf
[50:29.160 --> 50:31.160]  In January, the president was just about to go
[50:31.160 --> 50:33.160]  To the Middle East for a visit
[50:33.160 --> 50:35.160]  So it was all, that was one reason
[50:35.160 --> 50:37.160]  They wanted to gin it up
[50:37.160 --> 50:39.160]  Get it going, look
[50:39.160 --> 50:41.160]  Is it high school? Yeah
[50:41.160 --> 50:43.160]  Are we playing high school?
[50:43.160 --> 50:45.160]  Listen to this, you have the vice president
[50:45.160 --> 50:47.160]  And the neocons in there with the military
[50:47.160 --> 50:49.160]  Planning this, and it's all high school
[50:49.160 --> 50:51.160]  It's funny, ha ha
[50:51.160 --> 50:53.160]  We already have the White House memo where they plant it with aircraft
[50:53.160 --> 50:59.160]  Incredible will be right back
[51:23.160 --> 51:25.160]  We have it all
[52:01.160 --> 52:03.160]  On September 11th, 2001
[52:03.160 --> 52:05.160]  Along with hundreds of my fellow troops
[52:05.160 --> 52:07.160]  I went to grounds here on
[52:07.160 --> 52:09.160]  And we knew what to do
[52:09.160 --> 52:11.160]  Or at least we thought we did
[52:17.160 --> 52:19.160]  Whitman
[52:19.160 --> 52:21.160]  EPA director
[52:21.160 --> 52:23.160]  On the 18th made a statement
[52:23.160 --> 52:25.160]  That the air was safe to breathe
[52:25.160 --> 52:27.160]  This film follows the growing
[52:27.160 --> 52:29.160]  Momentum of 9-Eleven Truth

[52:33.160 --> 52:35.160]  He had his hand over the radio
[52:35.160 --> 52:37.160]  While he was getting a countdown
[52:37.160 --> 52:39.160]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one
[52:39.160 --> 52:41.160]  And it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
[52:41.160 --> 52:43.160]  This is an emergency

[52:53.160 --> 52:55.160]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror
[52:55.160 --> 52:57.160]  They're going to commit more acts
[52:57.160 --> 52:59.160]  And bring in martial law
[52:59.160 --> 53:01.160]  Why should we fire Congress?
[53:01.160 --> 53:03.160]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States
[53:03.160 --> 53:05.160]  As a scrap of paper
[53:05.160 --> 53:07.160]  They swear an oath to follow it
[53:07.160 --> 53:09.160]  And then they reject it
[53:09.160 --> 53:11.160]  That was their employment document
[53:11.160 --> 53:13.160]  They haven't followed it
[53:13.160 --> 53:15.160]  Congressman, Senators, you're fired

[54:34.600 --> 54:44.280]  this. I know he's talked about before Congress last Friday how they plan to stage terror attacks,
[54:44.280 --> 54:52.120]  provocateur actions with the White House memo. But we'll bring this up to him and get his take
[54:52.120 --> 54:56.520]  on that. I'm also trying to get Ray McGovern to pop in today or on the Sunday show from four to six
[54:56.520 --> 55:03.080]  p.m. I need your help listeners to go to infowars.com right now. And it's one of the top stories
[55:03.080 --> 55:10.520]  that's been up there since yesterday afternoon. It is so important. Cheney Neocons considered
[55:10.520 --> 55:15.560]  killing Americans in pretext to attack Iran. Some of the other news I have Alex Jones fan
[55:15.560 --> 55:21.560]  charge for placing 9-11 stickers on a plane. Jason Robo, this is in scores of newspapers
[55:21.560 --> 55:29.560]  trying to act like he was a terrorist. He's being, I guess, a rain today for sticking a infowars.com
[55:30.440 --> 55:37.960]  bumper sticker in the bathroom. Folks, don't do things like that. Don't do stupid things like
[55:37.960 --> 55:43.240]  that. I mean, I'm on this young man's side. I'm sorry. He's in a bunch of trouble. But this is a
[55:43.240 --> 55:47.400]  serious world. These people don't play games. Okay. And something that 10 years ago would have
[55:47.400 --> 55:52.600]  got you just a fine. I mean, they could put him on the show trial on TV and say he worked for Ben
[55:52.600 --> 55:57.240]  Lawton. You know, saying 9-11 is an inside job. They're now saying that myself and others were
[55:57.240 --> 56:01.240]  secretly trained as children in Afghanistan. All this ridiculous, just it's so ridiculous.
[56:01.240 --> 56:06.920]  It's just so amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:10.200 --> 56:15.480]  They are just completely out of control, these terrorists. And we've got one of the people
[56:15.480 --> 56:19.480]  that were getting ready to supposedly charge for the anthrax attacks, who was not the main suspect,
[56:19.480 --> 56:24.920]  another Patsy like Hatfield, quote, committed suicide last night at his home. That's in the
[56:24.920 --> 56:30.280]  Associated Press, completely asinine. We're going to be covering that. Bush calls for basically
[56:30.280 --> 56:34.600]  turning all the major highways, as we told you in the toll roads, because the states are being
[56:34.600 --> 56:39.000]  battled by the people, turning them over to foreign companies, which we've already paid for.
[56:40.200 --> 56:43.960]  And Wall Street Journal, Bush plans through some type of executive fiat controlling the federal
[56:43.960 --> 56:52.360]  funds, that it's our money to give it to foreigners. Because they're having setbacks in Indiana and
[56:52.360 --> 56:57.960]  Texas and other places. So they're just moving ahead with this tyranny. Another way to fight
[56:57.960 --> 57:01.880]  these people is expose 9-11 as an inside job. That is so important that they're going to stage
[57:01.880 --> 57:05.880]  more terror. And the best film out there for just waking the public up about the first responders,
[57:05.880 --> 57:10.200]  the deadly dust, the terror attacks, the bombs in the buildings, how they're trying to set 9-11
[57:10.200 --> 57:15.080]  truth up as terrorists, is in truth rising. And we need everybody to make copies of this film.
[57:15.080 --> 57:22.040]  We need you to make it a household word on the streets. I need you to get the DVDs at infowars.com,
[57:22.040 --> 57:27.480]  as cheap as $9.95, and to get a DVD burner and make copies of them, or go download them in high
[57:27.480 --> 57:34.520]  quality at prisonplanet.tv, and get them out to people, and in game. It doesn't happen without
[57:34.520 --> 57:39.480]  you. Look in the mirror. It's you. Don't wait. Go buy a DVD burner today if you've got truth rising,
[57:39.480 --> 57:44.360]  and start buying a bunch of blank copies, and start making copies, and start handing them out
[57:44.360 --> 57:49.400]  tomorrow. Tomorrow afternoon. Those of you that have already made hundreds of copies of other
[57:49.400 --> 57:52.520]  films, and some of these are thousands. Hey, you've done a great job. We need more from you.
[57:52.520 --> 58:00.680]  Don't count on others to do it. Again, infowars.com, the secure online video on bookstore infowars.com.
[58:00.680 --> 58:04.520]  I want people to order a bunch of the books and videos, but the videos are key because you can
[58:04.520 --> 58:09.160]  make copies of all the films I've made. I've made four films on 9-11, and government sponsored terror.
[58:09.160 --> 58:14.120]  Get them out to people. People now are waking up. And hey, some of you are smart and got time.
[58:14.120 --> 58:18.040]  Make a little CD wrong, but 10 or 15 mainstream stories about the government staging other
[58:18.040 --> 58:21.800]  terror attacks, and say, by the way, when you watch these films, then look at the news articles
[58:21.800 --> 58:28.760]  right here. I mean, just get it out to people. There's a bibliograph, a bibliograph, a bibliography
[58:28.760 --> 58:39.320]  for Marshall Law 9-11. I mean, that film, Marshall Law 9-11.info. I mean, it's all documented.

[59:50.120 --> 59:59.320]  to Big Brother. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:59.320 --> 1:00:13.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.640 --> 1:00:21.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:28.120]  Well, he testified before the House Judiciary Committee on a preliminary hearing on whether
[1:00:28.120 --> 1:00:38.200]  they should hear full hearings, evidence on moves to impeach George W. Bush, the President.
[1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:44.600]  And I wanted to have him on today to talk about that and go over his evidence. He is, of course,
[1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:49.800]  needs no introduction, best-selling author, the prosecutor that successfully nailed the
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:55.880]  Manson family to the wall, and a bunch of other famous cases, a great legal mind. And the juries
[1:00:55.880 --> 1:01:00.440]  in, people believe even they had Bob Barr and others up there that he was the most effective
[1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:05.960]  and most powerful in the hearing last week. We're going to get into that, but he just now
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:11.160]  heard about this. He's so focused on trying to prosecute Bush and trying to get impeachment or
[1:01:11.160 --> 1:01:14.920]  some type of grand jury to move for indictment that he wasn't aware of this. And I don't
[1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:21.960]  blame him. This broke yesterday on Think Progress. There's no doubt I made phone calls last night
[1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:28.680]  this morning. Sy Hirsch, Seymour Hirsch of the New Yorker magazine, highly respected White House
[1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:33.480]  sources, congressional sources, probably the greatest living investigative journalist who broke
[1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:38.440]  five years ago that U.S. Special Forces were in Iran with Wahhabist al-Qaeda-type groups attacking
[1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:44.840]  the Iranian Shi'ite government as a pretext to overthrow it or start a war. He broke, along with
[1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:49.960]  the Times of London, the same day, the story about the White House memo. He broke this two years ago,
[1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:54.920]  or a year and a half ago, the plan to fly U.S. airplanes, hang it up like U.N. low to try to
[1:01:54.920 --> 1:02:03.240]  get Saddam's forces to shoot at him or shoot him down. But now, major breaking news, major
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:07.640]  breaking news, and so I want to read a little bit of report after the break to him and play a few
[1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:13.960]  minutes of Sy Hirsch talking, but then poo-pooing, saying, well, they just planned. He just proposed,
[1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:19.880]  Cheney in a meeting, getting seals to have a bunch of arms and have a clash with destroyers
[1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:23.080]  and have them shoot at each other, and some people could die. But you know, that's the high
[1:02:23.080 --> 1:02:28.280]  school annex. So we kind of poo-pooed it, and I find this to be really disgusting in a way.
[1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:33.880]  Vincent Boogliosi, I hate to, you know, bushwhack you here with new info, but I'm going to cover
[1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:38.440]  the sources for you after the break, but what do you think about this? Well, I'd have to hear it.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:43.720]  I'm so focused on getting George Bush in an American courtroom being prosecuted for murder and
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:48.760]  taking the nation to war in Iraq on a lie that I literally, other than reading headlines, do not
[1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:52.680]  have time to read the daily newspapers. So I'm being exposed to this for the first time, but I'd
[1:02:52.680 --> 1:02:58.200]  like to hear it. Okay. I'd like to hear the tape of it. Absolutely. We're going to do that. I'll
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:05.400]  tell you what, John, move that to two minutes, 20 seconds in when her starts talking on the stage.
[1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:12.360]  That is the best place to start this, and we're going to go to break, and some stations join us
[1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:17.000]  after the break. So that's good. We'll have all our full audience then. But just now, let me give
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.320]  you the background. Cheney Neocons considered killing Americans in pretext of attack. I ran
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:27.480]  Think Progress and other publications in the video here, taped to the campus of progress journalism
[1:03:27.480 --> 1:03:31.720]  conference earlier this month, the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour Hirsch reveals
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:38.440]  how the Neocons convened around Dick Cheney and brainstormed ways to kick off World War Four,
[1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:43.160]  as they finally call their pet project to take out the Muslims and foment they contrived
[1:03:43.160 --> 1:03:48.680]  class of civilizations. Now, I went and checked the conference website at the university. He was
[1:03:48.680 --> 1:03:54.760]  there. It is him. It's a video of him on the stage. We have called the New Yorker. We've called his
[1:03:54.760 --> 1:04:01.320]  office. We're trying to get a response because he has a responsibility to tell us the other 11
[1:04:01.320 --> 1:04:07.800]  provocations they were planning. Okay. And it's also come out that right after this meeting was
[1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:13.560]  right after they had the event where they claimed that the PT Iranian boats in the Strait of Hormuz
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:17.000]  came out and wanted to attack the ship. Turned out they were over a mile away. And there was a
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:22.280]  fake radio transmission. The media had to admit it was fake. It was obviously an Anglo with a
[1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:27.480]  ridiculous fake Muslim voice going Eastern voice Persian voice going, we are going to blow you
[1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:32.360]  up in one minute. And then it turned out quote, Oh, somebody was joking around on the Navy radios.
[1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:38.280]  Okay. Yeah, that's a cover story. Vincent Boogliosi. We're very honored to have you. I didn't mean
[1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:43.560]  to spend four minutes doing that before we have you speak. I just want to give you as much info.
[1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:49.480]  We'll go to a three minute break and come directly back with the full clip for Vincent
[1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:54.440]  Boogliosi so he can give us his take on it. Just unbelievable. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:56.760]  Vincent Boogliosi is our guest. Stay with us.
[1:04:56.760 --> 1:05:06.280]  Hey, everybody, if you're anything like me, I'll bet you like to eat. I like egg scrambles for
[1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:13.400]  breakfast, fresh homemade bread, delicious pastas like lasagna. I love beef stroganoff.
[1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:19.400]  I love chicken noodle soup. I love desserts. All kinds of entrees and soups and desserts and
[1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:24.920]  breakfast. I love that stuff. Now food prices are skyrocketing just like gasoline prices.
[1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:28.520]  I mean, the gasoline prices have gone insanely high, probably going to go higher.
[1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:32.440]  Grocery prices are right on their heels. How are people going to be able to afford to eat?
[1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:38.040]  Well, I found a way to buy really incredible foods like I just described at half the price of last
[1:05:38.040 --> 1:05:42.680]  year's grocery bill. For less than half of what you spent for the same amount of food last year,
[1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:48.920]  I can have it delivered to your door. Let me tell you how. Go to efoodsdirect.com right now.

[1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:10.520]  9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet
[1:06:10.520 --> 1:06:15.080]  from the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered
[1:06:15.080 --> 1:06:21.720]  by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR? The day that we stop
[1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:27.640]  asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of just criticism to grow at our own door.
[1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:32.600]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:42.920]  An inside job? How dare you? If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable
[1:06:42.920 --> 1:06:47.480]  for treason yourself. Well, hell, it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government
[1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:52.200]  has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the tenth anniversary of 9-11.
[1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:58.280]  Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.

[1:07:51.240 --> 1:08:04.280]  our website at leysmedinc.com. That's L-A-S-E-M-E-D-I-N-C dot com today. From his Central Texas Command
[1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:11.720]  Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the G-C-N radio
[1:08:11.720 --> 1:08:22.680]  network. During the break, because we already played it last hour, I played the audio, part
[1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:29.160]  of the audio, of the full video that's up on infoawards.com right now. And again, here's what I
[1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:33.000]  heard, talk about, he's written a little article that mentioned they wanted provocations, but
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:38.280]  not what they were. And then the New Yorker editor said, oh, well, that's not newsworthy,
[1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:42.040]  they were discussing this. I mean, that's like saying, President Bush and Dick Cheney were
[1:08:42.040 --> 1:08:49.000]  discussing kidnapping children or cutting babies out of women's wombs, like Charlie Manson. But
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:54.360]  they didn't do it, so we're not going to talk about it when they clearly have staged other
[1:08:54.360 --> 1:09:01.080]  provocations. This is just incredible. And I know Vincent Booglioz, the famous prosecutor who did
[1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:05.560]  prosecute the Manson family, hence the mention of Charlie Manson, doesn't like to get into things.
[1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:09.800]  He hasn't fully vetted or looked at yet, but I'm playing the audio during the break. Give us your
[1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:16.280]  preliminary take on that. Yeah, Alex, I didn't hear everything that wasn't that clear. I can tell
[1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:20.760]  you this, that it didn't surprise me at all. These people are capable of anything, right? People,
[1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:27.160]  I mean, the Bush administration. But I would like to have either a transcript of this meeting
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:34.120]  that took place between Cheney and who else, or someone having written the minutes or a memo
[1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:40.120]  on the meeting. It would be a little stronger if we had that, but it's totally consistent with the
[1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:44.840]  Manning memo that I talk about in my book, The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder, where
[1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:50.280]  Bush himself, not just Cheney, but Bush himself is talking about how to provoke a war with Saddam
[1:09:50.280 --> 1:09:57.000]  Hussein. I agree with you 100% that this is relevant, even though they didn't go ahead and do it,
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:02.920]  because it's reflective of their state of mind. And that's very important in a criminal trial.
[1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:08.040]  Their state of mind that they are willing to deliberately deceive the American public and
[1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:13.880]  taking this nation to war. And it also shows premeditation for dastardly deeds. Absolutely,
[1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:18.600]  absolutely. So whether they go ahead on it or not is not relevant. The relevant thing is what's
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:23.480]  their state of mind that they're very willing to take this nation to war under false pretenses.
[1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:26.360]  Well, Vincent Bootley, we're going to get into your book. We're going to get into the Manning
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:30.520]  memo. I want you to spend some time on that first, since it does dovetail. But as a famous,
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:36.760]  highly respected prosecutor and legal scholar, if I met with 10 guys and discussed 12 different
[1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:42.280]  crimes and were seriously thinking about implementing them, isn't that a crime in and of itself?
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:49.480]  Not really. It comes pretty close to it. Well, you could say yes, a conspiracy to commit the
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:55.640]  crime, except at common law. That was enough. But today, in addition to the agreement, there has
[1:10:55.640 --> 1:11:00.680]  to be what they call an overt act, a step taken. It does not have to be a big step, but a step
[1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:05.400]  taken to carry out the object of the conspiracy. So there is the agreement, which is one element
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:10.760]  of the crime of conspiracy. But here, if that's all there was, there was no overt act to further
[1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:17.320]  what they were agreeing to do. But it's a major investigation, is it not?
[1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:22.120]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. Of course, it shows that they wanted to take the
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:28.120]  nation to war on a lie. But there has to be some step that they take in furtherance of the object
[1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:32.680]  of that agreement. And I don't hear that here. Even in the Manning Memo, we don't have that.
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:37.800]  But we do have Bush showing that he wanted to take the nation to war on a lie. And it goes
[1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:40.600]  beyond that. Tell us about the Manning Memo. I mean, not everybody is aware of it like you are
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:45.480]  written a book about it. Tell us about it. Well, the Manning Memo is just one piece of evidence
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:52.040]  that I present in my book to show that George Bush is guilty of murder. And it shows
[1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:57.640]  the state of mind that he wanted to go to war on a lie. The date was January the 31st, 2003.
[1:11:57.640 --> 1:12:00.520]  And by the way, we're not talking about the Downing Street Memo. No, that's a totally
[1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:04.760]  different memo. And it's kind of ambiguous. And if I prosecuted Bush, that would be offered. But
[1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:09.160]  it's not strong enough to go to war. I mean, to go to a trial. Yeah, that's telling the British
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:15.080]  fixed intelligence. We're going to lie. But yeah, but that there was no source for that.
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:19.960]  And it's a little ambiguous what fixing the evidence means. It could mean creating evidence,
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:24.440]  which would be very, very serious. Or it could mean cherry picking, which is a lot weaker.
[1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:31.080]  But the Manning Memo, this is January 31, 2003. Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:37.400]  in the Oval Office for two hours with six of his top aides, including his chief,
[1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:43.320]  Blair's chief foreign policy advisor, David Manning. After the meeting, Manning prepared a
[1:12:43.320 --> 1:12:48.920]  five-page memo stamped, quote, extremely sensitive, unquote, in which he summarized, Alex, what was
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:54.600]  said at the meeting. And among other things, he said that George Bush, not Blair, but Bush,
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:13:01.400]  was so worried about the failure of UN inspectors to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that
[1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:07.240]  he talked about three possible ways to, quote, provoke a confrontation, unquote, with Hussein,
[1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:13.960]  one of which, Bush said, was to, quote, fly U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Iraq, falsely
[1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:19.880]  painted in United Nations colors. And Bush said that if Hussein fired upon them, he'd be in violation
[1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:28.440]  of UN resolutions, and that would justify our going to war. Now, here we have Alex George Bush
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:33.960]  telling the American people, telling the world that Hussein was an imminent threat to the
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:39.880]  security of this country, but behind closed doors, this small man was talking about how to provoke
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:47.000]  Hussein into a war. Now, if Bush honestly, and let's italicize the word honestly, if he honestly
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.760]  believed that Hussein was an imminent threat to security of this country, which is the main reason
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:56.360]  he gave the American people going to war, by definition, the thought of provoking Hussein
[1:13:56.360 --> 1:14:02.040]  into a war would never, ever have entered his mind. I was on the Dennis Moore show a couple
[1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:06.840]  weeks ago. Dennis fell hopelessly in love with the Republican Party at the time of 9-11, and I
[1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:13.080]  poked fun of him in my book. And I said, Dennis, you're defending George Bush at his trial for
[1:14:13.080 --> 1:14:17.400]  murder, and the prosecutor calls David Manning to the witness stand to testify to what your guy
[1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:23.320]  said on January 31, 2003. Other than trying to hide beneath the console table, Dennis, what would
[1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:28.840]  your response be to David Manning's testimony? And Dennis is as bright and quick. He said,
[1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:35.400]  I'd ask for a recess. Well, no matter how long that recess went on, for 10 minutes an hour,
[1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:41.720]  a week, or a year, there's no answer to the Manning memo other than guilt. It clearly shows George
[1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:48.360]  Bush wanted to take the nation to war on a lie. The fact that they didn't implement that is not
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:54.600]  relevant. It's relevant in that we couldn't prosecute it on that alone. But it shows that he
[1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:58.680]  lied when he told the nation that he believed that Hussein was an imminent threat to security
[1:14:58.680 --> 1:15:02.600]  of this country. Because if you believe that, he never, by definition, would have been talking
[1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:08.280]  about how to provoke Hussein into a war. And he then had his surrogates go out and produce excised,
[1:15:08.280 --> 1:15:15.080]  as you covered in the hearings last week, before the judiciary, false, dumbied up reports that had
[1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:19.800]  then been brought to Congress and before the United Nations. So he had his surrogates all over,
[1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:26.920]  pushing a lie, and then took us to the war. Yeah. In fact, on June 16th, I got a call here in L.A.
[1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:34.120]  from a very conservative Republican congressman from the South who voted for the war, was one
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:39.240]  of its most vocal supporters. I'm not giving his name right now because he's running for a re-election,
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:43.960]  but he told me that come November, he wants to be on my side, hopefully when George Bush is
[1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:50.120]  indicted for murder, in any event. He heard the tape on the book, The Prosecution of George
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:53.320]  George Bush for Murder, and he called me and he said, Mr. Bush, I want to tell you
[1:15:53.320 --> 1:15:58.840]  that I'm convinced now that George Bush misled Congress, he didn't mention American people,
[1:15:58.840 --> 1:16:04.760]  to mislead Congress into war. I've given several copies of the book to colleagues,
[1:16:04.760 --> 1:16:10.440]  including John Conyers, who called me, by the way, about a month ago, or three weeks ago,
[1:16:10.440 --> 1:16:14.200]  or I forget how long ago, but anyway, he said he was reading the book and he'd gotten a copy
[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:25.000]  of the book, and he said that, where am I here on this story here? I'm talking about this Republican
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:30.200]  congressman. He said he's given them a copy of the book, asked them to read it, and told them,
[1:16:30.200 --> 1:16:38.360]  read the book, we were lied to. He felt very bad himself that he was susceptible to that lie,
[1:16:38.360 --> 1:16:43.320]  and I told him, Congressman, do not feel that way. You were not, as he learned in the book,
[1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:47.160]  you were not given the information that you were supposed to be given. Now, what is that information?
[1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:55.720]  Well, Bush, on the evening of October the 7th, 2002, from Cincinnati, Ohio, this was his first
[1:16:55.720 --> 1:17:03.080]  reference to Hussein in Iraq, being the threat to the country. He told the nation that Hussein
[1:17:03.080 --> 1:17:08.440]  was an imminent threat to the security of this country, either by his attacking us with weapons
[1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:13.800]  or mass destruction, or giving those weapons to a terrorist group to attack us. He said this
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:19.320]  attack can happen, quote, on any given day, unquote, meaning the threat was imminent.
[1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:25.240]  The big problem for George Bush is that the evidence shows that what he told the American
[1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:32.920]  people was the exact opposite of what his own CIA had told him just six days earlier in a classified
[1:17:32.920 --> 1:17:41.000]  October 1 report that Hussein was not an imminent threat. Now we get into the issue of deletions,
[1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:47.560]  and it gets worse. October the 4th, and I told Congress this, and they were taking notes that
[1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:52.360]  looked like, to me, if they weren't taking notes, they were certainly listening very intently. In
[1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:56.840]  fact, Conyers, the fellow to his left, Republican Congressman, literally tried to shut me down,
[1:17:56.840 --> 1:18:04.520]  and he made this remark. Lamar Smith. He said, he said, I, not referring to me, but he said,
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:11.560]  I'm about to have an aneurysm. Now I don't know if that was a Freudian slip, or what have you,
[1:18:11.560 --> 1:18:23.400]  but I told Congress that in this October 4th unclassified version of the classified report,
[1:18:23.400 --> 1:18:28.520]  it was called the White Paper. This is what the Bush administration did. They had an unclassified
[1:18:28.520 --> 1:18:33.800]  summary version of October 1st report to give to Congress and the American people. And in this
[1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:40.520]  unclassified version, the conclusion of US intelligence, we're talking about 16 US intelligence
[1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:47.320]  agencies led by the CIA. The conclusion of US intelligence that Hussein was not an imminent
[1:18:47.320 --> 1:18:52.600]  threat to the security of this country was completely deleted. Every single one of those
[1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:57.960]  all important words was taken out. So Congress never saw that. And I was telling this Congressman,
[1:18:57.960 --> 1:19:04.760]  as he learned from the book, you never saw that. I can't tell you how serious this is.
[1:19:05.720 --> 1:19:13.160]  For those that understand, they premeditatedly edited the 16 agencies reports, created a fraud,
[1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:19.320]  and then put it forward as 16 unanimous agencies saying he is a threat when they said he isn't
[1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:26.440]  an imminent threat. Yeah, that's exactly right. The consensus of 16 US intelligence
[1:19:26.440 --> 1:19:31.480]  agencies was that Hussein was not an imminent threat to this country, but the White Paper that
[1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:36.120]  was given to Congress just seven days, just seven days before Congress voted on whether
[1:19:36.120 --> 1:19:42.520]  to authorize George Bush to go to war, October 11th, did not contain that statement. It did not
[1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:46.920]  contain several other things. And when we get back, I'd like to talk to you about several other
[1:19:46.920 --> 1:19:52.360]  things that were not. Absolutely. Vincent Boogliosi is our guest, the famed prosecutor. He says he's
[1:19:52.360 --> 1:19:56.600]  got the goods. George Bush is a mass murderer. That's the facts. We'll be right back.
[1:20:01.320 --> 1:20:06.200]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty
[1:20:06.200 --> 1:20:11.240]  worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern history, the people
[1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:15.640]  are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow
[1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:20.200]  man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time frame to fully awaken
[1:20:20.200 --> 1:20:25.400]  and energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful

[1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:28.440]  I also want to ask him later, is he fearing for his safety going up against this mafia and
[1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:35.960]  as he got any threats, but continuing with the absolute evidence that, I mean, you use the
[1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:43.640]  number of 100,000 dead in Iraq, but most of the big, the Lancet study and other international
[1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:48.200]  respected groups were nonpartisan and said that it's closer to a million now. I mean,
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:55.320]  two and a half years ago was 600 plus thousand dead, but being conservative, 100,000 dead in
[1:24:55.320 --> 1:25:01.320]  Iraq, I mean, this is murder. This is premeditated. Please continue. Of course, by the way, Alex,
[1:25:01.320 --> 1:25:05.960]  in my end note, a lot of times people don't read end notes, but my end notes are a little
[1:25:05.960 --> 1:25:10.200]  different than a lot of people. Some of my end notes go on for 20, 30 pages in my book on the
[1:25:10.200 --> 1:25:14.600]  Kennedy assassination. I have an end note that goes on for 60 pages, I think, with about 30 foot
[1:25:14.600 --> 1:25:19.560]  notes. I'm not dropping names here, but Johnny Carson said, Vince, I read all your end notes,
[1:25:19.560 --> 1:25:24.360]  but the only reason I mention that now is I do mention what you say about the estimates being
[1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:29.320]  as high as 1 million, and that was about a year ago. So I'm using a very conservative number
[1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:37.640]  in the main text of a 100,000. Summarizing what I'm saying up to where we left off,
[1:25:37.640 --> 1:25:42.200]  we have Bush then telling the nation on October the 7th that who's saying was an imminent threat
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:48.840]  to security of this country, and he was telling millions of unsuspecting Americans the exact
[1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:53.800]  opposite of what his own CIA had told them just six days earlier, that who's saying was not an
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:59.240]  imminent threat. And then I was pointing out to you that on October the 4th, the Bush administration
[1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:03.720]  put out an unclassified summary version of this classified report so they could give it to Congress
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:09.640]  and American people, and this report was called a white paper. And in that white paper, the main
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:15.080]  conclusion of the October 1st classified report that who's saying was not an imminent threat was
[1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:20.120]  completely deleted, so Congress and the American people did not see that. There were two other
[1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:26.280]  things in that classified report that Congress and the American people never saw, and the Republican
[1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:33.720]  congressman saw it for the first time in the book. One, the conclusion, it was an erroneous
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:38.120]  conclusion that who's saying it weapons of mass destruction, we subsequently learned that they
[1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:44.120]  were all destroyed in 1991 at the end of the Persian Gulf War. That conclusion was stated
[1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:50.360]  in the classified report as an opinion with the words, we assess that or we judge that
[1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:56.280]  who's saying it as weapons of mass destruction. The white report, the white paper, the words we
[1:26:56.280 --> 1:27:01.720]  judge that we assess that were deleted, and that opinion was stated as a fact. The words were who's
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:08.760]  saying has weapons of mass destruction. Also, there were several very important defense in the
[1:27:08.760 --> 1:27:15.560]  area of nuclear weapons in the classified report. All of those defense were deleted from the white
[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:21.480]  paper. This is extremely powerful evidence that Bush took this nation to war knowingly and deliberately
[1:27:21.480 --> 1:27:28.040]  on a lie under false pretenses, and therefore under the law, under the law, he's guilty of murder
[1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:32.440]  for the death of over 4,000 young American soldiers who have died so far fighting his war,
[1:27:32.440 --> 1:27:38.680]  not your war, Alex, or my war, or America's war, but his war. One of the key issues that I knew
[1:27:38.680 --> 1:27:43.160]  would come up, if there's going to be a prosecution, and there very well or could be after he leaves
[1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:48.920]  office right now he has temporary immunity, is whether there's jurisdiction to prosecute George
[1:27:48.920 --> 1:27:53.560]  Bush. I spent a great number of hours at the LA County Law Library, the Ninth Circuit Library,
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:27:59.240]  trying to establish jurisdiction. I was unable to establish jurisdiction for the well over 100,000
[1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:03.480]  innocent Iraqi men, women, children, and babies who have died in his war. Bush is guilty of those
[1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:08.840]  murders, but I couldn't establish jurisdiction for them. But I was able to establish jurisdiction
[1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:14.120]  to prosecute Bush for the murder of the over 4,000 young American soldiers, and I established
[1:28:14.120 --> 1:28:19.480]  jurisdiction for the Attorney General in Washington, D.C., acting through his Department of Justice.
[1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:23.880]  We're only talking really about one prosecutor there. There's 93 U.S. attorneys around the
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:27.160]  country, but they're not going to bring an action against Bush without the consent of their boss.
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:33.320]  But on a state level, I established jurisdiction for the Attorney General, Alex, in each of the
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:39.960]  50 states, plus the approximately 950 district attorneys in counties within those states,
[1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:46.920]  to prosecute Bush for the murder of any soldier or soldiers from their state or county who died
[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:52.920]  fighting Bush's war in Iraq. So with over or approximately 1,000 prosecutors out there in
[1:28:52.920 --> 1:28:57.640]  this land of ours, and with all the evidence of guilt that I present in my book, The Prosecution
[1:28:57.640 --> 1:29:02.520]  of George Bush for Murder, I don't think it's unreasonable to believe, Alex, that there's at
[1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:07.640]  least one prosecutor out there that's courageous enough to step forward. Maybe there's many more.
[1:29:08.200 --> 1:29:13.080]  Step forward and say, this is the United States of America. In America, no man is above the law.
[1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:18.840]  The evidence of Bush's guilt is clear, so I'm going to go after him. And when we talk about
[1:29:19.400 --> 1:29:24.760]  1,000 prosecutors, before Bush passes away, that number may go up to seven or eight thousand
[1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:28.120]  prosecutors because there's no statute of limitations for the crime of murder. You know,
[1:29:28.120 --> 1:29:32.360]  Penal Shade on a chili, 33 years later, they brought murder charges against him.
[1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:38.200]  Stay there, Vincent Boogliozzi. I want to talk about what's happening now.
[1:29:38.200 --> 1:29:46.120]  They're cornered rats. They need a new war. If getting in the mind of the criminals, what do
[1:29:46.120 --> 1:29:51.080]  you think they're planning to do to stop your investigation and others investigations?
[1:29:51.640 --> 1:29:58.280]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[1:31:11.240 --> 1:31:16.680]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:31:16.680 --> 1:31:27.160]  to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:31:27.160 --> 1:31:32.360]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take
[1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:37.400]  action against their global masters. He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:31:37.400 --> 1:31:43.160]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[1:32:01.880 --> 1:32:06.600]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you have
[1:32:06.600 --> 1:32:11.080]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's
[1:32:11.080 --> 1:32:15.960]  because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[1:32:15.960 --> 1:32:21.800]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine,

[1:33:28.440 --> 1:33:34.920]  121 consecutive murder trials. He's Vincent Bugliozzi, best-selling author of books. He's
[1:33:34.920 --> 1:33:40.040]  written them and made into films, TV shows, you name it. Mr. Bugliozzi, getting into the mind,
[1:33:40.040 --> 1:33:45.000]  you've studied criminology, you've been death-threaded before, you've dealt with these type
[1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:51.400]  individuals. We know that psychopaths, the controlled psychopaths go for positions of power
[1:33:51.400 --> 1:33:57.400]  throughout history, comparing the mind of Charlie Manson and other psychos you put away
[1:33:57.400 --> 1:34:05.880]  with George Bush, with Cheney, with the neocons, with their nasty mindset. Give us your analysis
[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:11.480]  on their mindset. Well, I don't know if I have an authority on the mindset. I had to
[1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:18.040]  prove that the defendant committed the crime and that there was no legal justification for him
[1:34:18.040 --> 1:34:25.320]  to do so. We certainly got into the mind in the resolution of that issue, but motive is not an
[1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:30.200]  element of the corpus delicti of any crime, so I've actually put people on death roll without
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:34.280]  knowing for sure why they committed the crime. All I knew is that they had done it, put someone in
[1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:38.360]  their grave six feet under and they had no legal justification for doing so, but you're asking me
[1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:46.680]  kind of to compare Manson with Bush. Manson obviously was a very evil person. Let me get
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:53.880]  that off the hook here so we're not interrupted. Manson was a very evil person who wanted to
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:59.800]  kill as many people as he could, and I knew that if he was not stopped, he would have killed as
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:04.440]  many people as he could have. Someone who knew Manson a lot better than I did because he lived
[1:35:04.440 --> 1:35:12.440]  with him, Louis Paul Watkins. He's dead now. He said, Ben's death is Charlie's trip, so I would
[1:35:12.440 --> 1:35:19.560]  classify Manson as being a very evil human being who placed no value on human life,
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:27.640]  and he had a passion for death, blood, and murder. Bush, I would not say is evil. He certainly
[1:35:27.640 --> 1:35:36.840]  doesn't want to kill anyone, but he's a despicable human being who couldn't care less when people
[1:35:36.840 --> 1:35:46.600]  do die. He's extremely arrogant, extremely self-centered, and one of the emotional underpinnings
[1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:52.200]  for this book, basically, is the fact that, and we're getting into this issue now, that he couldn't
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:57.400]  possibly care less about the fact that his own people were being killed or the death of innocent
[1:35:57.400 --> 1:36:03.960]  Iraqi civilians, one of the emotional underpinnings for my book is the fact that the evidence is
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:10.120]  overwhelming that throughout the hell on earth that Bush created in Iraq with over 100,000 people
[1:36:10.120 --> 1:36:14.680]  dying horrible violent deaths and hundreds of thousands of their survivors crying out hysterically
[1:36:14.680 --> 1:36:19.080]  and having terrible nightmares over what happened to their loved ones. This guy, George Bush,
[1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:23.960]  has smiled through it all. In fact, you see a photo of Bush and six or seven other people
[1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:28.760]  smiling, Alex, who has the biggest smile on his face right in the middle of the war, George Bush.
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:34.280]  The evidence is very clear, and anyone that tries to dispute it is just going to be looking like a
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:41.400]  fool, that while young American soldiers, 18, 19-year-old kids, Alex, who never had a chance
[1:36:41.400 --> 1:36:47.160]  to live out their dreams, were being blown to pieces by roadside bombs in Iraq, Bush was having
[1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:53.640]  a lot of fun and enjoying life to the very fullest. I'm talking about running, bicycling, joking with
[1:36:53.640 --> 1:36:59.240]  friends, slapping backs, dancing and swiveling as hips like Elvis to blaring music, almost always
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:04.040]  appearing to be in the very best of good spirits. Exactly. Let me just stop you,
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:10.120]  Vincent Boogliosi. I mean, just covering serious issues on the show, I've become more of a serious
[1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:16.120]  person and very serious in life, and you see a judge, they try to be solemn. You see police,
[1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:20.680]  they try to be professional and solemn. With Bush, he's always clowning around, and then he lied and
[1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:25.320]  said, oh, I haven't been playing golf since the war started, and it turns out he's playing every week,
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:30.040]  so it's also the endless lying and just the arrogance thinking we're all idiots.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:37.400]  Yeah, you look at a photograph of people like or presidents like Roosevelt, Truman, LBJ,
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:44.600]  and Nixon, a photograph of their faces during the time of war, their respective wars, and the
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:51.240]  photos reflect the grimness of the war. There's a very serious time. Unlike any other president
[1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:57.000]  in American history, during a time of war, Bush has regularly and routinely had a lot of fun
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:00.920]  and been in high spirits. Well, you can say what you want. You can say what you want about Nixon
[1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:07.160]  or LBJ, but they obsessed in the war room and tried to figure things out and got ulcers and
[1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:11.720]  lost sleep, and these weren't even very moral people in many respects, but they took it serious.
[1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:17.320]  Oh, absolutely. LBJ told one of his aides, Jack Valenti, that every time in the morning,
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:21.240]  when he'd read the casually reports, it was like drinking our carbolic acid,
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:25.480]  and for your audience out there, I would tell them that they don't have to take my word for this
[1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:29.320]  or the photographs in the book, and they're not gotcha photos. They're photos showing Bush having
[1:38:29.320 --> 1:38:35.800]  an absolute ball. Bush himself has had no hesitancy at all in saying things like this,
[1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:41.080]  Alex, over and over again, and while I'm quoting Bush, these are just some quotes that are in
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:45.960]  the book. While I'm quoting him, try to think, I'm asking your audience, you try to think of,
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:51.160]  at the very same time he's uttering these words, all of the death and the horror and the suffering
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:56.440]  and the screaming and the mutilations and beheadings that are taking place in Iraq
[1:38:56.440 --> 1:39:02.920]  while he's uttering these words. This is George Bush. Laura and I are having the time of our lives.
[1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:10.280]  I'm in a great mood. It's a perfect day. I'm feeling pretty good about life.
[1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:14.440]  Alex, if I killed one person, even accidentally, like in a car accident,
[1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:18.280]  I'd never have another perfect day for the rest of my life, and I'm telling you,
[1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:22.600]  this guy has been having a ball and joined himself to the utmost throughout this entire war,
[1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:29.720]  and I say this, that even if George Bush was only guilty of making an innocent mistake
[1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:33.320]  and taking this nation to war in Iraq, not murder, as I firmly believe,
[1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:39.880]  with all of the death, horror, and suffering he has caused, what type of a monstrous individual is it
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:45.320]  who could be happy with his life? It is no question that he's happy. I mean, as recently as March of
[1:39:45.320 --> 1:39:51.080]  this year, he shows up at a press conference to endorse McCain's candidacy. McCain shows up late.
[1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:57.480]  What does Bush do? Spontaneously, a big smile on his face. He starts doing a soft shoe tap dancing
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:03.960]  routine to entertain the assembled media. You've probably heard of Mark McKinnon.
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:04.440]  Yes.
[1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:11.240]  Alex, well, he's a bicycling friend of Bush, and I think he was ahead of Bush's media campaign,
[1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:17.320]  or one of his strategists, I think he was ahead of it, in the 2004 Relection Campaign. He told
[1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:22.520]  The New York Times in 2005, right in the midst of all the horror and atrocities going on in Iraq,
[1:40:22.520 --> 1:40:28.440]  he says he's never seen the president more calm, relaxed, and happy. And to me,
[1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:32.120]  this is almost unprecedented. I kind of went off on a little riff. You're asking me to compare
[1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:38.840]  Manson with Bush. Bush is a despicable human being. I don't believe he's lost one wink of sleep
[1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:42.840]  over all the deaths that he's caused in Iraq.
[1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:46.920]  Well, what about the working out three hours a day and taking two-hour naps and then says,
[1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:49.480]  of course, he doesn't even read the newspaper?
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:55.800]  Oh, yeah. Probably even more telling than all of this. My wife and I, during a seven-year period,
[1:40:55.800 --> 1:40:59.480]  I work seven days a week. I get to bed around two in the morning, wake up at 10. She says,
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:04.520]  you work from morning to morning. We had our 50th anniversary, and we took three days off
[1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:09.640]  in the desert during a seven-year period that Bush was president. If it hadn't been for the
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:13.720]  anniversary, probably wouldn't even have taken those three days off. Now, the only reason I
[1:41:13.720 --> 1:41:20.680]  mentioned that is that I'm a cipher, a complete nobody. I'm just an author. During that same period,
[1:41:21.560 --> 1:41:26.840]  you know how many days George Bush took off for a vacation or at places like
[1:41:27.640 --> 1:41:28.520]  kind of Bunkport or Camp David?
[1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:31.240]  Well, I know it's around a third of the year he's on vacation.
[1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:36.120]  Yeah, that's right. Nine hundred and eight days. So I take three days off, and I'm nothing. He's
[1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:41.240]  the president of the United States, and I was told by the CBS radio guy who follows the White
[1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:48.280]  House that up until January 1st, 2008, he had taken off nine hundred and eight days on vacation.
[1:41:48.840 --> 1:41:53.400]  Here's someone that's not particularly bright at all. Everyone agrees, even his supporters,
[1:41:53.400 --> 1:41:58.680]  that he has an extremely low amount of knowledge. If you were to take the average person and put
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:03.320]  them in the presidency with Bush's lack of knowledge, what would that person do if he
[1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:07.960]  loved America? He'd work around the clock trying to get as knowledgeable as he could
[1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:12.600]  so he could represent this country in the best possible way to bring it to a better
[1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:19.160]  condition than it presently is in. George Bush did the exact opposite, took off nine
[1:42:19.160 --> 1:42:23.720]  hundred and eight days. Why? Well, like I say in the book, it doesn't just show he's
[1:42:23.720 --> 1:42:29.240]  lazy. Everyone knows that, it shows that. It shows, in my opinion, I'm not positive
[1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:33.880]  of this, that this man does not love the United States of America. He doesn't hate it, doesn't
[1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:40.680]  hate it, but he has no particular love for it. And one way you show your love for your country,
[1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:45.960]  obviously, is to fight for it. And this is what I have against, among many other things,
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:51.320]  against Bush and his fellow Neil Combs and the right wing of the party, the tremendous hypocrisy
[1:42:51.320 --> 1:42:56.280]  of these people. They're the most repugnant, hypocritical, un-American people in our society.
[1:42:56.280 --> 1:43:00.040]  When it was their time, just one example, I'm sure you have many more, Alex,
[1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:04.840]  when it was their time to fight for America in the Vietnam War, show their love for this country.
[1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:09.640]  What did they do? I'm talking about the Bushes, the Cheneys, the Roves, the indescribably
[1:43:09.640 --> 1:43:14.440]  reprehensible Rush Limbaugh. What did they do? They ran like hell in the opposite direction.
[1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:20.280]  But now they have no hesitancy in waving the flag and shedding the blood of other people's
[1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:26.840]  children in far off Iraq. These are not good people. With respect to Bush's monumental crime,
[1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:31.800]  in this case, here's my view, and I view it more as a fact than as an opinion.
[1:43:32.760 --> 1:43:37.800]  Because George Bush is a conservative Republican and so are they, anything he does,
[1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:42.120]  anything at all, including murder, is just fine with them.
[1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:46.760]  Listen, I have people in my message board on infowars.com and they come in and go,
[1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:51.560]  yeah, the government stages events to get us into war. It's good. Yeah, cops are tasing people to
[1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:56.360]  death. It's good. I mean, it seems like it's not just Bush and his psychopathic or sociopathic
[1:43:56.360 --> 1:44:02.120]  activities. The whole society, and I've always seen myself as a mainline conservative slash
[1:44:02.120 --> 1:44:06.920]  libertarian, but it's not just George Bush. It's a lot of these Republican followers.
[1:44:06.920 --> 1:44:11.640]  They think it's cute and funny to be evil. They think it's cute and funny Iraqis are dying. They
[1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:17.080]  post on their blogs pictures of Iraqi children with their feet blown off and talk about nuking
[1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:23.720]  them and turning it into a glass parking lot. They really are demonic, psychopathic camp followers.
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:27.320]  Now they wouldn't actually want to go below the kids feet off. They'd throw up at the side of real
[1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:35.240]  blood, but it's like some kind of, some type of stunted bloodlust. It's like a little piggish
[1:44:35.240 --> 1:44:41.080]  demon and there's hordes of them. And I really think it's a society that's become very decadent.
[1:44:41.080 --> 1:44:45.720]  I think George Bush is an expression of the rotten sectors, not saying the whole country,
[1:44:45.720 --> 1:44:50.920]  it's a great country that are out there. And it makes me ashamed because we can say they did it
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:54.520]  and they lied to us and Congress didn't know, but now the Democrats aren't going after him. The
[1:44:54.520 --> 1:44:59.080]  Democrats have still got us in the war. And it just makes me really ashamed to be an American.
[1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:04.520]  Well, I agree with everything you say. If we look at the genesis of this, I would add this
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:10.600]  of addendum. These people that couldn't care less about all the killings of not only Iraqi
[1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:14.440]  citizens, but American soldiers, they couldn't care less. They say, well, this is war.
[1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:20.520]  My analysis is that the reason they're that way is that they are much more Republican than they
[1:45:20.520 --> 1:45:27.720]  are American. Let me ask you this. What do you think their state of mind would be if Bill Clinton
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:32.680]  were doing the same identical thing as George Bush? They'd be freaking out. They'd be running around,
[1:45:32.680 --> 1:45:37.560]  freaking out, pulling their hair out. Well, more than that, they'd want to skin him alive,
[1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:42.520]  hang him in the town square at noontime. I mean, here's a guy that had consensual sex outside
[1:45:42.520 --> 1:45:47.320]  of marriage, try to cover it up. Just sublime silliness, nothing at all. And what happened to
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:53.480]  him with these right-wingers, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after
[1:45:53.480 --> 1:45:59.240]  year, he was savaged by the right-wing media, including the liberal New York Times and Washington
[1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:08.840]  Post, the monstrous Ken Starr, with federal funding conducted a seven-year, 70 million-dollar
[1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:14.600]  effort to destroy the Clinton presidency. He was impeached. They tried to drive him
[1:46:14.600 --> 1:46:20.360]  from office for doing nothing. And here's George Bush responsible for, like you say,
[1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:24.920]  probably over one million murders, and they don't want to do anything at all. And I say this,
[1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:30.680]  Bush and his people have gotten away with thousands upon thousands of murders, and we,
[1:46:31.480 --> 1:46:36.440]  America, the American people, cannot let him do this. And this is why I'm not going to be satisfied.
[1:46:36.440 --> 1:46:40.920]  I may not succeed, but I'm not going to be satisfied until I see this guy in an American
[1:46:40.920 --> 1:46:45.160]  court will be prosecuted for first-degree murder. And if the jury convicts them, Alex, as you know,
[1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:49.080]  it'll be up to them to decide the appropriate punishment, one of their options being the
[1:46:49.080 --> 1:46:53.000]  imposition of the death penalty, the other options being life imprisonment and life imprisonment
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:59.960]  without the possibility of parole. Are you there, Alex? Yes, I'm just stunned by the magnitude
[1:46:59.960 --> 1:47:03.640]  of what you're talking about. And again, I cut my teeth on talk radio, attacking Bill Clinton
[1:47:03.640 --> 1:47:10.280]  for the Chinese generals and the missile secrets and the Arkansas. But compared to George Bush,
[1:47:10.280 --> 1:47:13.880]  I mean, I'm no fan of Bill Clinton. I know people that worked with him were around him.
[1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:18.040]  The guy slept four hours a night. He constantly read all the government agency reports.
[1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:22.200]  He had at least pride in himself that he wanted to be sharp and know what was going on.
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:27.000]  And I mean, just a side issue, I've been reading the military reports themselves.
[1:47:27.800 --> 1:47:34.760]  Many of the VAs, roaches, flies, rats, no good healthcare, people that aren't even real doctors
[1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:39.720]  have been hired, overflowing toilets at bases everywhere, the C-130s falling apart,
[1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:44.280]  toilets overflowing, the men crapping in the aisles on the way over to Iraq,
[1:47:44.280 --> 1:47:50.680]  and then they've built all these pleasure planes for the brass. And it seems like we are Rome in
[1:47:50.680 --> 1:47:56.920]  409, right before 410. I mean, it just seems like sectors of the government
[1:47:56.920 --> 1:47:59.480]  are just completely let them eat cake, Marie Antoinette.
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:06.600]  Yeah, I can't disagree with anything that you say, Alex. As they say, I guess it's a new term.
[1:48:06.600 --> 1:48:11.800]  I'm still the 19th century with a yellow pad and pencil. You're spot on. Is that a new term?
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:14.280]  Spot on. No, no, that's a good term. I just don't know.
[1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:17.320]  I mean, I'm not that familiar with it. I just heard it recently.
[1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:21.880]  Well, take the handling of the economy. The dollars plunging, all these prices are up,
[1:48:21.880 --> 1:48:25.080]  and Bush is prancing around what two weeks ago saying the economy is just fine.
[1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:33.000]  Yeah. Talking about Clinton's alleged crimes, vis-a-vis Bush's, as you know,
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:38.920]  at the hearings Friday in Congress, there was a professor from Northwestern, Mr. Presser.
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:42.760]  I don't know his first name, but anyway, he was denouncing all the horrible things that George
[1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:49.240]  Bush did, but had no trouble with what, no, all the horrible things he said that Clinton did,
[1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:53.160]  but had no trouble with what George Bush did. And I just said, Mr. Presser,
[1:48:54.200 --> 1:48:59.160]  you apparently have no, apparently you think it's worse, which what Clinton did,
[1:48:59.160 --> 1:49:06.200]  lying to the American public about consensual sex, and you feel that's worse than George Bush lying
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:11.800]  to the American public about going to war and all the death, horror, and suffering that has
[1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:16.680]  resulted from it. And I said, I would ask you this question, Mr. Presser. What previously
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:21.320]  recognized form of logic would allow you to reach a conclusion like that? And he was silent.
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:26.680]  Well, that's it. There's a craziness spreading across the country, but I don't give the
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:31.080]  Democrats cover. They should have already pulled out of Iraq. They should already be in full-blown
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:35.800]  impeachment hearings a year and a half ago, but we don't see that. Instead, we see Nancy Pelosi
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:40.840]  prancing around with Bush everywhere. So I think it's going to get, I think it's just going to
[1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:48.760]  continue under the Democrats. I want to take some phone calls for our guest, and I don't want to
[1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:52.200]  keep you too much longer the next hour, but can you do five minutes to the next hour?
[1:49:52.200 --> 1:49:56.360]  Yes, absolutely. Listen, I'm honored to be on this show. You're a standup guy, and I can't
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:59.400]  thank you enough. You know, I've been blacked out by the major media in this country.
[1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:01.800]  Yeah, talk about the blackout in the minute we've got left before bright.
[1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:04.040]  Oh, okay, good. Go ahead.
[1:50:04.600 --> 1:50:10.680]  Oh, right now. Well, my publisher said she had never seen another book in her over 30 years
[1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:15.800]  had been totally blacked out by the mainstream national media. Up until a New York Times article
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:21.240]  about two weeks ago pointing out the blackout, there was a total complete blackout, no network,
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:29.720]  no table, total blackout. It got so bad that ABC radio refused to take money from my publisher
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:35.960]  to take out a radio spot on the news on their network for the book, prosecution of George W.
[1:50:35.960 --> 1:50:42.840]  Bush for murder. But despite that, the book, Because of People Like You, an incredible word of
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:47.800]  mouth, is a New York Times bestseller, number nine this week. But it's because of people like you
[1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:52.520]  that it's giving me a voice. But the mainstream national media has not wanted to talk to me
[1:50:52.520 --> 1:50:56.280]  about this book. They don't even want to talk about Bush being prosecuted for murder. And that's
[1:50:56.280 --> 1:50:59.560]  because they know they're complicit going along with it. We'll be right back with your phone
[1:50:59.560 --> 1:51:08.600]  calls and Vincent Boogliosi. It is a big idea, a new world order. In the near future, Earth is
[1:51:08.600 --> 1:51:14.920]  dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the builder bird. Could their objective
[1:51:14.920 --> 1:51:21.640]  be world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth

[1:51:39.560 --> 1:51:43.080]  The builder bird is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no
[1:51:43.080 --> 1:51:46.360]  idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:52.600]  I'm going to tell you too. So how are you doing by then?
[1:55:55.400 --> 1:56:00.200]  I don't want to drop another name. Warren Beatty asked me the same thing on Sunday,
[1:56:00.200 --> 1:56:08.840]  and I said, I'm angry. I'm very, very angry. Mr. Bugliozzi, has there ever been a successful
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:14.600]  prosecution of somebody of Bush's status? And if this trial ever does come to court,
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:21.560]  will those that choose to prosecute him, will they live to see the verdict?
[1:56:23.720 --> 1:56:27.400]  Will those that choose to prosecute him live to see the verdict that, well,
[1:56:27.400 --> 1:56:32.760]  you're saying there'd be a whole trial. And then before the verdict, after the trial,
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:35.800]  but just before the verdict, someone's going to step forward and kill them? Is that what
[1:56:35.800 --> 1:56:41.320]  you're suggesting? Well, I would think that there's somebody that does take on this
[1:56:41.320 --> 1:56:48.360]  type of job, would have great concern. Well, I'm looking for a courageous prosecutor out there.
[1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:53.400]  About two weeks ago, not even that long, maybe a week and a half ago, the publisher sent out
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:57:00.120]  a copy of my book, Prosecution of George Bush for Murder, to each of the 50 state
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:05.400]  attorney generals in this country with a cover letter from me asking the prosecutor to read
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:10.040]  the book. And if they agree that the evidence of Bush's guilt is clear, and that there's
[1:57:10.040 --> 1:57:13.480]  jurisdiction that they proceed against him, they can't prosecute him right now, but they can
[1:57:13.480 --> 1:57:18.440]  commence the criminal investigation of him. And I offered my services to the prosecutor,
[1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:24.440]  in whichever way he or she sees fit, which would range from being a consultant all the way up to
[1:57:24.440 --> 1:57:31.320]  and including being appointed a special prosecutor. I certainly would not be averse to prosecuting
[1:57:31.320 --> 1:57:36.040]  George Doug Bush for murder. And I can tell you right now that unquestionably, I would seek
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:41.560]  the death penalty against him. I mean, here's a guy, by the way, who was very much in favor of
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:46.760]  the death penalty, probably had the highest execution rate in the history of any governor.
[1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:50.520]  152 cases came across his desk when he was governor of Texas. And by the way, he would
[1:57:50.520 --> 1:57:54.600]  give press conferences and then giggle and laugh about it and talk about how they begged him.
[1:57:54.600 --> 1:57:57.640]  I mean, if you're going to execute somebody, you don't make jokes about it.
[1:57:57.640 --> 1:58:03.880]  No, of course. But he signed off on 152 off 152, even signed off on a death warrant for a young
[1:58:03.880 --> 1:58:10.120]  man who was mentally retarded. So I would seek the death penalty against him. I got to think
[1:58:10.120 --> 1:58:13.640]  there's at least one courageous prosecutor out there, and I'm going to be looking for him.
[1:58:14.600 --> 1:58:18.680]  Hey, Frankie, we got to go to break. We got to go to break. Thank you for the call, Frankie.
[1:58:18.680 --> 1:58:23.240]  More calls straight ahead. David, Walt, Stephen, others. There is no doubt that Vincent Boogliosi
[1:58:23.240 --> 1:58:32.040]  is treading where angels fear to tread. I mean, there is no doubt that this guy has really got
[1:58:32.040 --> 1:58:37.960]  a lot of will and nerve because we're dealing with global mafia here. George Bush is just their
[1:58:37.960 --> 1:58:48.920]  front man. We'll be right back. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.880 --> 1:58:56.840]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[1:58:56.840 --> 1:59:01.240]  9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from
[1:59:01.240 --> 1:59:05.880]  the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by
[1:59:05.880 --> 1:59:13.560]  you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF? The day that we stop asking questions
[1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:19.240]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years
[1:59:19.240 --> 1:59:25.480]  after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place. An inside job.
[1:59:25.480 --> 1:59:34.040]  How dare you? If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason
[1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:38.920]  yourself. Oh, hell, it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the
[1:59:38.920 --> 1:59:42.760]  truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:59:42.760 --> 1:59:48.840]  Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:59:48.840 --> 1:59:51.400]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:59:51.400 --> 1:59:59.560]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:06.120 --> 2:00:13.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.400 --> 2:00:22.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.680 --> 2:00:28.040]  We're going to take you inside the Senator Ted Stevens indictment for about 20, 30 minutes
[2:00:28.040 --> 2:00:33.160]  with Dr. Nick Baggots coming up in 20 minutes. Then Bob Chapman coming on to break down some
[2:00:33.160 --> 2:00:37.080]  of the financial developments that have been happening in the fourth hour. Open phones then
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:42.040]  for Bob Chapman. For the next 19 minutes, we are joined by Vincent Bugliozzi, best-selling
[2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:47.000]  author, many times over, one of the most successful prosecutors in U.S. history, also the Manson family.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.520]  His book, Despite a Media Blackout, a dominant corporate media blackout, is number nine on the
[2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:55.080]  Newark Times best-seller list. The prosecution of George W. Bush for murder. It's very important
[2:00:55.080 --> 2:00:59.720]  that this book go to number one, so it cannot be ignored. It's not being ignored now. He's already
[2:00:59.720 --> 2:01:06.200]  been before Congress boldly saying, prosecute Bush for murder. You can hear gasp and freakouts by the
[2:01:06.200 --> 2:01:11.080]  little neocon fake conservatives up there who destroyed the name of conservatism in this country.
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:16.920]  Absolute trash. And the cowardly Democrats were basically, had their arms twisted into even
[2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:21.240]  allowing the hearings, trying to shut them down, but they couldn't shut down Vincent Bugliozzi.
[2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:24.360]  Let's go to your phone calls. David in Montreal, Canada, you're on the air.
[2:01:26.280 --> 2:01:27.640]  Go ahead, David, you're on the air.
[2:01:30.200 --> 2:01:35.800]  Okay, he's listening to his radio. Let's move on. Walt, in Michigan, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:01:35.800 --> 2:01:42.600]  I'd like to have a couple questions from Mr. Bugliozzi. Are you willing to also recommend
[2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:47.960]  the prosecution of Knight of Malta, George Tenet, and all of the other members of the Knights of
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:53.320]  Malta that are running this country for Rome, and are you willing to prosecute those high-level
[2:01:53.320 --> 2:02:00.680]  Roman Catholics for their complicit involvement in this false war in Iraq, as well as 9-11?
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:07.800]  Well, this commaulter, whatever you said, I'm not familiar with that term, Walt, but at the grand
[2:02:07.800 --> 2:02:15.240]  jury hearings, not hearings, but the testimony before the grand jury, and documents would be
[2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:20.760]  subpoenaed, of course, and there'd be investigators interviewing people. All types of information
[2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:24.840]  and evidence would come out at this state right now. You're saying you'd be looking,
[2:02:24.840 --> 2:02:28.840]  you'd be looking at Tenet, though. Well, yeah, but at this particular point,
[2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:34.840]  certainly Bush did not conspire with himself. He didn't do it himself. He conspired with others,
[2:02:34.840 --> 2:02:39.960]  and the two that would almost undoubtedly be prosecuted along with him, and I talk about it
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:47.560]  in the book, are Condoleezza Rice and Dick Cheney. I have a sense that Roe is up over his head in
[2:02:47.560 --> 2:02:53.640]  this, but the grand jury testimony would probably answer that question. Rumsfeld, I'm not sure about.
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:03:01.000]  I have a sense about Powell that his only sin is weakness, but in answer to your question,
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:06.280]  the grand jury proceedings would be determined with the accompanying investigation
[2:03:07.240 --> 2:03:12.520]  who joined with Bush and taken this nation to war on a lie, but right now off the top of my head,
[2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:17.720]  I would say certainly there's Bush, Cheney, and Rice. Whether there are more than that,
[2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:23.720]  I don't know. Possibly Tenet also. Mr. Bugliozzi. Yes, sir. And one more thing.
[2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:28.840]  You need to read a book called Vatican Assassins Wounded in the House of Life Friends,
[2:03:28.840 --> 2:03:33.240]  which talks about 9-11 and all the people behind it. Listen, I appreciate your call. Hey,
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:37.720]  Walt, we don't screen your calls. We let you on there. And by the way, the Vatican has been
[2:03:37.720 --> 2:03:41.560]  against the war over there. I'm not Catholic. I'm not getting in the middle of this, and I'll let
[2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:46.600]  you come on and ask your question, but the person you talk about is told nothing but lies and BS
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:52.520]  about me. So I know the stuff he's saying, that is, his view is a bunch of lunacy. Okay. And
[2:03:53.400 --> 2:04:00.680]  Mr. Bugliozzi, it's just craziness. And so we're here trying to talk about serious issues. You
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:06.120]  say, yes, I'd look at trying to go after Tenet, and that isn't enough. And then people that have
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:10.280]  slandered me and my family said horrible things about me have to then make the show about selling
[2:04:10.280 --> 2:04:15.080]  their dirty book. Okay. And I don't mean that the Vatican isn't involved in evil or the Nazis in
[2:04:15.080 --> 2:04:21.480]  World War Two. I've guessed on about that, like Jim Mars, but serious historical people who don't
[2:04:21.480 --> 2:04:28.120]  run around saying lies about me. So just this isn't the place for you to do that. Go hawk your bull
[2:04:28.120 --> 2:04:34.440]  somewhere else, pal. That same guy says they drop bombs out of flying saucers and it's in the nuclear
[2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:39.560]  bombs are magical and black people need to be put in another country and everything else. Okay.
[2:04:39.560 --> 2:04:45.160]  But then since I don't hail your God, I'm bad. This is the mental illness of the American people.
[2:04:45.160 --> 2:04:51.240]  They have a very serious person on the air talking about serious issues, not quack garbage. I'm
[2:04:51.240 --> 2:04:55.240]  sorry, Mr. Bugliozzi. I tried to let him run with this question. If it was serious and it just
[2:04:55.240 --> 2:04:59.880]  turned into a pure bull, we'll be right back with more of your phone calls for Vincent Bugliozzi.

[2:08:01.960 --> 2:08:07.640]  Ease the T-rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:11.400 --> 2:08:15.240]  Final segment with Vincent Bigliozzi. Then we'll talk to Dr. Nick Baggich,
[2:08:15.240 --> 2:08:20.200]  who's also running with Brother probably from Monday. The mayor of Anchorage, he is running
[2:08:20.200 --> 2:08:24.520]  against Senator Ted Stevens and this guy that wants to shut the internet down,
[2:08:25.800 --> 2:08:28.920]  just completely out of his mind. He says the internet is a bunch of tubes and
[2:08:29.720 --> 2:08:35.160]  it's just unbelievable that you quote dump stuff on like a truck. I mean, just out of his mind,
[2:08:35.160 --> 2:08:40.040]  like McCain, who has said that he doesn't use a computer, doesn't know how to use a computer,
[2:08:40.040 --> 2:08:45.960]  just that they are not connected to reality. And that's what scares me. We want to think the
[2:08:45.960 --> 2:08:49.800]  government's in control, even if it's evil, but that they know what they're doing and they certainly
[2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:53.640]  have their systems and their corrupt bureaucracies and the corporate interest. But more and more,
[2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:59.080]  it's not an act. A lot of people in the power structure, and this happens throughout history,
[2:08:59.080 --> 2:09:04.120]  have now gotten so decadent, so imbred, so spoiled that I think they think they're in control,
[2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:07.240]  but I think they're losing control. Like the Neocons wanted to attack on Iran,
[2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:12.760]  when every analyst we've had on hundreds of them says doubling in oil prices, depression,
[2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:16.520]  could start World War III, but they still want it. Your comments on that,
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:18.280]  Vincent Boogliosi, then we're going to go back to Coles.
[2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:23.800]  Well, you're asking me to comment on something that though, one of my strengths,
[2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:26.760]  if I have any strengths, is that I know my limitations. And I think you're asking me
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:29.880]  to comment on something that's outside my area of expertise.
[2:09:29.880 --> 2:09:32.360]  But obviously, starting a new war is not a good idea.
[2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:39.080]  Oh, the Iran thing, you know, I'm telling you, I'm so immersed in this Bush thing.
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:44.280]  I know about the Bush administration, given an indication that they may go to war in Iran.
[2:09:44.280 --> 2:09:47.880]  I know about that. I'm not reading any of the articles. I got a stack of papers up to the
[2:09:47.880 --> 2:09:52.680]  ceiling and magazines. I just haven't read. We've got tunnel vision on the issue at hand,
[2:09:52.680 --> 2:09:56.520]  as well. You're such a good prosecutor. I want to see Bush in court being prosecuted for murder.
[2:09:56.520 --> 2:10:00.040]  But I've heard about the Iranian thing, but I haven't studied it at all.
[2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:02.280]  And therefore, I should not be founding off on it.
[2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:07.880]  I understand, sir. Specializing is what you're doing. Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[2:10:07.880 --> 2:10:10.760]  Let's talk to Stephen Alabama. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:10:11.560 --> 2:10:16.360]  Hey, Alex, I have a quick question for Mr. Boogliosi. And then I'd like to comment on
[2:10:16.360 --> 2:10:19.160]  Cy Hirsch if you'll allow it. Yeah, go ahead.
[2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:25.160]  Mr. Boogliosi, is it legal to set up a private fund or a bounty, if you will,
[2:10:25.160 --> 2:10:28.360]  to be awarded to the first prosecutor who will take it?
[2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:31.160]  That's a bribe. That's illegal. It's illegal.
[2:10:31.160 --> 2:10:35.960]  Well, let's get the prosecutors. Hold on. Hold on. Let's get his take. I just boarded that out.
[2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:45.240]  I don't know if I know the answer to that. If you offer money to influence a public act
[2:10:45.880 --> 2:10:52.840]  that is bribery, whether this particular thing would fall within the realm of bribery,
[2:10:52.840 --> 2:10:57.240]  I don't know. On the top of my head, it sounds like bribery.
[2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:01.000]  Although bribery always, as you know, is behind the scenes that's covert.
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:06.760]  But that sounds like something Carl Rove would do to then discredit the whole process
[2:11:06.760 --> 2:11:11.880]  of going after them for crimes. That's a dirty trick. That's called Black Propaganda,
[2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:16.520]  and that is a horrible idea. I'm not mad. Here's the other thing that I'm concerned about.
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:21.480]  If this were to go to trial, it would be the biggest murder trial in American history,
[2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:25.480]  and I hope if there's a prosecutor out there that steps forward, that he's not doing so just
[2:11:25.480 --> 2:11:30.440]  for the enormous publicity. Wherever he is in Fargo, North Dakota, Lexington, Kentucky,
[2:11:30.440 --> 2:11:34.680]  the whole world press would be at his door. He'd be in the cover of every magazine,
[2:11:34.680 --> 2:11:39.480]  so let's hope if a prosecutor steps forward, it's not for publicity, but to bring about justice
[2:11:39.480 --> 2:11:43.160]  for the American people. Now, here's an example. Let's say a real prosecutor steps forward is
[2:11:43.160 --> 2:11:46.600]  willing to risk their life and their name and everything else with this clear-cut case,
[2:11:46.600 --> 2:11:51.320]  Vincent Boogliosi and others have put together. I guarantee the White House would have some clown
[2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:56.680]  pop-up who would act crazy and ridiculous and probably talk about flying saucers at the meetings
[2:11:57.240 --> 2:12:00.280]  and at the press conferences to discredit the whole thing. I mean, they got a lot of dirty
[2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:04.280]  tricks, folks. I mean, Carl Rove got caught bugging his own office. Don't forget that.
[2:12:05.320 --> 2:12:10.120]  Back when he was at the state here in Texas. So, I mean, they play all sorts of games,
[2:12:10.120 --> 2:12:12.760]  but I'm not mad at you for asking the question, Steve. It's a good question
[2:12:13.400 --> 2:12:15.800]  because we could then answer it, but anything else?
[2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:22.040]  My point about the Psyhurst story actually plays into dirty tricks,
[2:12:22.040 --> 2:12:25.800]  which is basically, you know, in listening to the story, and again, I probably know about
[2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:29.320]  as much as Mr. Boogliosi. I've just kind of heard what you've been saying about it and
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:33.560]  read a little bit about it. But, you know, the story, that story just doesn't add up for me
[2:12:33.560 --> 2:12:38.440]  right now. Like, number one, I just find it kind of odd that it would be leaked at all. And number
[2:12:38.440 --> 2:12:46.040]  two, the fact that they were, you know, purportedly talking about using Navy SEALs as the decoys,
[2:12:46.040 --> 2:12:51.480]  just seems a little strange to me when, you know, why wouldn't they just, you know,
[2:12:51.480 --> 2:12:55.400]  grab one of these goat herders out of the torture prison and put them on a remote
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:13:00.040]  controlled boat and, you know, and sail them out there, blow it up. It just, you know...
[2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:04.520]  Please don't give them ideas. Please. And I appreciate your call. Goodness gracious.
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:11.240]  Don't give them ideas here. Listen, you judge a tree by its fruits. You will know them by the
[2:13:11.240 --> 2:13:18.440]  fruits. Sy Hirsch broke the torture information on Operation Phoenix in Vietnam. He broke a bunch
[2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:23.080]  of other things. There are people in CIA, NFBI, and defense intelligence in the White House
[2:13:23.640 --> 2:13:30.600]  that do not like what's going on. And so he has been leaked info over and over and over and over
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:35.240]  and over again that has proven to be accurate. And so no, this is somebody in a big White House
[2:13:35.240 --> 2:13:40.440]  boardroom meeting, strategy session, who is upset and doesn't like what's happening. And we know
[2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:45.480]  Sy Hirsch has incredible sources. And I, I mean, this, I mean, look, we have, I'm going to play it
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:51.080]  later, we have the tapes of Rumsfeld with the war correspondents who are all former generals
[2:13:51.080 --> 2:13:54.920]  and colonels saying, man, we shooting another 9-11 that would sure help us or some incident.
[2:13:55.480 --> 2:13:59.080]  Okay. And, and, you know, that got released. So, so the government is not invincible. They're
[2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:03.720]  not perfect. They don't, they're not infallible. And people say, well, stuff like this would come
[2:14:03.720 --> 2:14:10.920]  out of it was true. It does come out. Vincent Boogliosi. Well, yeah, stuff eventually comes out,
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:16.680]  but frequently behind the scenes, the Pentagon papers was leaked to the New York Times.
[2:14:16.680 --> 2:14:22.360]  Gelsberg. But we have more, we need more people being stand-up people like you, Alex,
[2:14:23.080 --> 2:14:27.720]  and telling the truth and letting the chips fall where they may. There aren't too many of those
[2:14:27.720 --> 2:14:34.680]  people in America, unfortunately. I'm trying to think of his name, Mark Twain, boy.
[2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:41.080]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man. Don't get old. Don't get old, Alex. But Mark Twain
[2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:46.280]  made a very perceptive observation. He said, why is physical courage so common,
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:54.120]  but moral courage so rare? Yes. So we need people that to step forward. And like on this book,
[2:14:54.120 --> 2:15:01.400]  no major, you know, no major TV or major newspaper wants to step forward, interview the book,
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:06.040]  have me on. They're just terrified. And by the way, they even talk about prosecuting Bush for
[2:15:06.040 --> 2:15:10.120]  murder. And by the way, you can get on TV. I mean, you've been on TV, I would guess hundreds of
[2:15:10.120 --> 2:15:15.560]  times. I mean, you know, in just more modern times, you're on all the time. You're the go-to guy on
[2:15:15.560 --> 2:15:22.280]  so many issues. Suddenly, you're not on CNN Fox in MSNBC. CNN, after the Wall Street article,
[2:15:22.280 --> 2:15:28.440]  I mean, the New York Times article had me on CNN because of the New York Times article. They
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:33.880]  interviewed me for 20, 25 minutes on tape, and they put out an incredible piece of about four
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:37.640]  minutes that was so distorted it was beyond recognition and almost sounded like a Bush
[2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:42.520]  propaganda piece. Just to give you an example, they asked me, what's the likelihood that this
[2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:46.920]  thing will happen? And I said, well, there's not a high probability. And they cut me off right there.
[2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:52.120]  And I always want to say, but there's a substantial possibility that as a direct
[2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:55.720]  resolve of this book, Bush is going to find himself in the American courtroom. They took
[2:15:55.720 --> 2:16:00.600]  all that out. And then it sounded like you said it was going nowhere. It totally distorted it.
[2:16:01.400 --> 2:16:06.120]  So that sounds like something. Sorry. Why there's no one that has the courage to
[2:16:06.120 --> 2:16:09.960]  interview me on national television about this book. I don't know. But if you were
[2:16:11.960 --> 2:16:15.640]  the host of one of those shows, obviously you'd have the courage, but no one has stepped forward
[2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:22.600]  yet. There's terrified of talking to me about the subject matter of my book. Yeah, let's go
[2:16:22.600 --> 2:16:27.960]  ahead and take another call here. Up next would be Will in Oklahoma. Go ahead, Will.
[2:16:29.320 --> 2:16:34.760]  Hi, Alex. Hi. Will, I'm just starting my awakening to the New World Order agenda.
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:39.400]  And I just had a question real quick. I was a little confused. I got on the show a little late
[2:16:39.400 --> 2:16:44.440]  and Mr. Bugalosi said that hopefully one prosecutor would read the facts and would
[2:16:44.440 --> 2:16:48.200]  be courageous enough to prosecute. So I was wondering why doesn't he do that?
[2:16:48.200 --> 2:16:52.280]  He's not a sitting prosecutor in a county or city. He's retired.
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:57.240]  Okay. I have one more question that you said. You talked about the internet being
[2:16:57.240 --> 2:17:02.920]  coming in control just a minute ago to limit its use. And do you think that is because the
[2:17:02.920 --> 2:17:07.160]  government is realizing that the resistance to the reticle government and the police state
[2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:11.240]  is gaining its strength? Yes, but also because the alternative media is kicking the butt of
[2:17:11.240 --> 2:17:15.880]  the mainstream media and they're losing market share. It's a cocktail of reasons. You want to
[2:17:15.880 --> 2:17:19.880]  come? Well, he doesn't want to get off the side of it. I didn't even hear a lot of his words.
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:24.280]  About his first thing, I don't know how much time we have left, but I was talking to my wife
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:29.720]  a couple of days ago and I asked her this question. I said, you know about these cold case files.
[2:17:29.720 --> 2:17:36.040]  You've heard about them, Alex. Yes. Just one victim and a loan detective pursues the killer
[2:17:36.040 --> 2:17:41.560]  for 10, 15, 20, 25 years. Then we hear stories that he's found back east living in an assumed name.
[2:17:42.280 --> 2:17:47.480]  He's brought out to, brought back to Austin or LA or Berkeley or wherever you, and he's prosecuted
[2:17:48.280 --> 2:17:53.880]  and justice is brought about with just one victim. So I said to her, I said, there are
[2:17:53.880 --> 2:18:00.200]  one million victims, at least 100,000 victims in their cold graves right now. You know,
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:06.840]  as I'm talking to you, decomposing. And I said, what person in authority on the face of this globe
[2:18:07.800 --> 2:18:14.600]  is trying to bring about justice for these, let's say 100,000 people trying to bring about justice,
[2:18:14.600 --> 2:18:19.960]  trying to bring the killer of these 100,000 people to justice? And she said to me, well,
[2:18:19.960 --> 2:18:24.520]  you are. And I said, well, you didn't hear my question. I said, what person in authority
[2:18:24.520 --> 2:18:30.360]  is doing this? I said, I don't have the clout of an emaciated moth. I'm looking for that person in
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:35.400]  authority that, you know, does have the institutional authority to go after. You've done the work,
[2:18:35.400 --> 2:18:39.640]  you've put the evidence together, you're disseminating it, you're sending it out to prosecutors,
[2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:43.720]  and you're saying, Hey folks, people always tell me I've got to do everything and I've got to fix
[2:18:43.720 --> 2:18:48.760]  it. And I'm like, Hey, I'm just having the guest on the info so you people know what's going on,
[2:18:48.760 --> 2:18:53.000]  and then can make your own decisions. This is a team effort here. Many hands make light work.
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:57.720]  No more time for calls. I appreciate your call. Well, Steve and Aaron and others,
[2:18:57.720 --> 2:19:02.440]  I'll get to you later, but we've got to let Mr. Vincent Boogliosi go. The book is
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:06.360]  the prosecution of George W. Bush for murder number nine of the Newark Times bestseller list.
[2:19:06.360 --> 2:19:13.080]  Get it online on Amazon. You can also, of course, get a bookstores everywhere. Mr. Boogliosi,
[2:19:13.080 --> 2:19:18.920]  do you have a personal website? No, I hate to tell you that I don't have a computer either.
[2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:23.400]  I guess McCain said he doesn't have one. I'm still working with a yellow pad and pencil.
[2:19:23.960 --> 2:19:26.440]  But you actually go down to the law library. That's different.
[2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:31.240]  Oh, yeah, yeah. But there, you know, the prosecution of George W. Bush for murder.com,
[2:19:31.240 --> 2:19:35.720]  I guess. It's put out by Vanguard Press. It's in all the stores and Amazon.com,
[2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:40.600]  and it's selling well, but we'd like to get it up to number one to get the message out to the
[2:19:40.600 --> 2:19:46.040]  majority of Americans so that a prosecutor will be more apt to step forward. Well, we have to punish
[2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:50.520]  tyranny. We have to punish tyranny or the precedent will be set. Thank you for all the time. We are
[2:19:50.520 --> 2:19:54.840]  out of time, and we will talk to you again in the future if you'll join us again.
[2:19:54.840 --> 2:19:58.120]  Thank you, sir, very much. I appreciate it. Take care. We'll be right back with Dr. Nick

[2:24:49.160 --> 2:24:54.920]  the monster who tried to end the internet, you shut down one hub, most of the web shuts down.
[2:24:54.920 --> 2:24:59.480]  He wanted to kill that neutrality two years ago. We barely beat him. They're back at it again through
[2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:04.680]  the companies themselves doing it. I remember having Dr. Nick Bagachon two years ago saying this
[2:25:04.680 --> 2:25:11.320]  guy is a crook. Nick Bagachon doesn't talk like that without evidence piled the rafters. He is the
[2:25:11.320 --> 2:25:16.920]  brother of the man running against him for the Senate seat. The man who looks like he's probably
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:21.560]  going to win if we get behind him, which we need to do. Imagine having Nick Bagachon's brother
[2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:29.560]  who knows all about all this stuff getting into the Senate. Just amazing. We're not giving the
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:35.160]  New World Order a heads up. They know that. Tell us why you said two years ago on this show that
[2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:41.240]  he was as dirty as it gets. Well, there was a good friend of mine who had run against him years ago,
[2:25:41.240 --> 2:25:46.520]  had sort of dredged up the record. Then when you start to look at things that we knew were coming
[2:25:46.520 --> 2:25:52.200]  out in terms of oil and gas and what special interests that various people up here are connected
[2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:59.080]  to, you start to get a pretty good read on what's happening. Then it was four years ago
[2:25:59.080 --> 2:26:05.800]  that I ran against one of the guys who eventually got indicted two years later. Then Stevens was
[2:26:05.800 --> 2:26:11.080]  implicated through his son who was president of our state senate at the time. In fact, we're still
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:16.440]  waiting to see the indictments come that direction. But already, I think five legislators or past
[2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:21.800]  legislators already in prison, two others are slated who were wired up for, I guess, close
[2:26:21.800 --> 2:26:29.080]  to a year in some cases. But Stevens was sort of the top guy in this whole chain, this whole
[2:26:29.080 --> 2:26:33.720]  feeding frenzy. When you look at the establishment here in Alaska, what they've done is basically
[2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:40.440]  appropriate huge federal and state resources to multinational corporations like there was
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:45.640]  a fire sale going on. All of that starting to unravel and the people who make the money like
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:52.360]  this, the deal here in Alaska, what happened is Bill Allen, who was a welder back in the 80s and
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:57.800]  had no real anything, became sort of the shill for the oil industry up here. His deal was he would
[2:26:57.800 --> 2:27:02.440]  get us to become a subcontractor and get all these huge subcontracts, which he did. He had
[2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:07.640]  billions, literally billions of dollars in work. Even after he was indicted, and I guess he has
[2:27:07.640 --> 2:27:12.840]  to serve 10 years, but he spared his family, his wife and children, who were also indicted by the
[2:27:12.840 --> 2:27:20.200]  IRS and the Bureau and Federal Bureau of Investigation and others for criminal activity.
[2:27:20.760 --> 2:27:26.280]  The kids and his wife got off and he got a minimal sentence, a pretty old guy, but
[2:27:26.280 --> 2:27:32.040]  he wore a wire for almost a year and had raised millions and millions. He sold his company,
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:35.640]  that was part of the deal. He had to get out of the contracting business, so he still got,
[2:27:35.640 --> 2:27:41.880]  I think, $390 million for that deal. But he had to keep the money. He'll pay back the IRS,
[2:27:41.880 --> 2:27:47.720]  whatever he owed them, and do some other things. But Stephen's office, and actually his home here,
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:53.400]  Senator Stephen's home, and his son's office, home, and businesses were all rated by the FBI and
[2:27:53.400 --> 2:27:59.160]  the IRS because of all of the things that have gone on. And one of the ways they did this was
[2:27:59.160 --> 2:28:05.880]  Bill Allen did the remodel on Ted Stephen's house, and Ted Stephen's paid for $130,000 worth of the
[2:28:05.880 --> 2:28:10.440]  work, but kind of forgot about a quarter of a million dollars worth of the work or somebody did.
[2:28:10.440 --> 2:28:15.240]  And that's the deal, is he got a quarter of a million in gifts that never got reported on his
[2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:20.360]  federal forms, because you got to report gifts over 300 bucks in some of those years,
[2:28:20.360 --> 2:28:26.840]  because they go back to 2003, and it's from this contractor. And the same contractor was the one
[2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:32.840]  who implicated all the guys who were already in jail. And there was a Senator identified,
[2:28:32.840 --> 2:28:37.480]  there was a Senator A and a Senator B, and one of these was his son, eventually identified in our
[2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:41.960]  media. And there's still two grand juries seated. This was the one in Washington, D.C. that just
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:46.200]  came down with all the stuff that people are reading about right now. And there's still a
[2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:51.480]  grand jury in Washington state looking at fisheries corruption because Ted Stephen was passing
[2:28:51.480 --> 2:28:56.440]  legislation granting money to fisheries organizations who had kind of an understanding
[2:28:56.440 --> 2:29:00.600]  that 10% of that went to his kid, who was president of the Senate at the time.
[2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:03.640]  So there's just all sorts of corruption going on.
[2:29:03.640 --> 2:29:07.320]  Oh, in fact, you know, here we have a gas line, right, that we're trying to build to relieve
[2:29:07.320 --> 2:29:11.160]  the rest of the country of the problems, you know, and so there's big things happening there,
[2:29:11.160 --> 2:29:15.400]  and we've talked about them in the past. And one of the, you know, when you look at that,
[2:29:16.600 --> 2:29:22.440]  it's the stranglehold on all of this. And what the end result is, is private companies are
[2:29:22.440 --> 2:29:28.360]  making huge, huge money because they were able to buy legislators here on a wholesale basis.
[2:29:28.360 --> 2:29:31.880]  You know, stay there. Dr. Nick Baggage, I want to come back to more about this and get into some
[2:29:31.880 --> 2:29:35.960]  other geopolitical issues that are going on and take calls. He's with us for the rest of the hour.
[2:29:35.960 --> 2:29:40.360]  Appreciate him joining us. His brother, former mayor of Anchorage, of course, their father,
[2:29:40.360 --> 2:29:45.800]  famous congressman, his brother is running for Stephen Seed and is doing very well in the polls.
[2:29:45.800 --> 2:29:50.040]  We can only hope and pray that he gets elected. We'll be right back with Dr. Nick Baggage.
[2:29:50.040 --> 2:29:59.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[2:32:04.120 --> 2:32:09.000]  the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health? Most experts agree
[2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:15.320]  that the water you drink should be at a pH level of nine or higher. Plasma pH drops combine a unique
[2:32:15.320 --> 2:32:20.680]  formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements. This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength
[2:32:20.680 --> 2:32:26.680]  and effectiveness. Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline
[2:32:26.680 --> 2:32:31.800]  while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy. With just 10 drops,
[2:32:31.800 --> 2:32:38.120]  you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10. Alkalizing water helps the body
[2:32:38.120 --> 2:32:43.400]  rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body. Disease organisms
[2:32:43.400 --> 2:32:48.840]  like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment. Order your bottle of Alka

[2:33:12.600 --> 2:33:28.440]  Well, I want to bring up next for Dr. Nick Baggich who has worked in so many different areas of
[2:33:28.440 --> 2:33:34.920]  private industry teaching, representing the native tribes up in Alaska, his father or congressman,
[2:33:34.920 --> 2:33:40.920]  his brother in government. I want to bring up something because I'm here in the middle of Texas
[2:33:40.920 --> 2:33:48.840]  and I read the oil and gas news and I have family that work as mid-level and low-level people
[2:33:48.840 --> 2:33:56.280]  for oil and gas companies and so I hear them talking about it. Even before the new London
[2:33:56.280 --> 2:34:02.120]  Kilo decision of what now almost three years ago, they passed laws in the legislature of Texas
[2:34:02.120 --> 2:34:07.720]  that said, oh, you have a landowner bill of rights, but the landowner bill of rights says
[2:34:07.720 --> 2:34:14.680]  that if oil companies or gas companies or coal companies, lignite mining here, surface coal,
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:19.960]  if they want to come on your property and you won't sell it, you basically, if you don't take
[2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:24.600]  their first offer, it takes you out of the regular court system and puts you into administrative law
[2:34:25.160 --> 2:34:29.400]  and then you have to pay court costs and then end up almost getting nothing.
[2:34:29.400 --> 2:34:35.000]  Now a new London Kilo decision, the media gave it the attention that it said, well,
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:39.480]  not only is it for government interest now, but in the case there, a big drug company,
[2:34:39.480 --> 2:34:44.200]  it was Eli Lilly there in Connecticut, wanted to tear down nice neighborhood. Usually it's okay
[2:34:44.200 --> 2:34:49.560]  if they're stealing land from poor people, but these were $300,000, $600,000, two, three-story
[2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:55.160]  Victorian homes on the lake, on the river there and they literally just came and took the houses
[2:34:55.160 --> 2:34:59.240]  and people who had fought in court wanting more money or not wanting to sell, some of them,
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:04.040]  the grandparents had been born there, they would then say, okay, now you owe us half a million
[2:35:04.040 --> 2:35:09.480]  dollars on your half a million dollar house, you owe us money, you get nothing. And in those cases,
[2:35:09.480 --> 2:35:14.840]  they were also coming to houses worth, one case, $332,000, I remember was in the paper and I had
[2:35:14.840 --> 2:35:23.000]  locals on and they would offer them $62,000 just for the lots value. So the point I'm getting
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:28.040]  out here is then I started researching this and found out the model for this was really built in
[2:35:28.040 --> 2:35:35.480]  a few of the states where you have 85, 90 plus percent in some cases, like Nevada, like Utah,
[2:35:35.480 --> 2:35:42.680]  or Alaska, and that they would just come in and either lay resources off use or give it
[2:35:42.680 --> 2:35:47.160]  to select groups or even come on private property. And now in Texas, I've been reading about if a
[2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:51.800]  landowner won't sign an oil lease for the company, they just cut the fence now and are driving on,
[2:35:51.800 --> 2:35:57.160]  in some cases, drilling and then under the law, they could have to pay damages, but the way they've
[2:35:57.160 --> 2:36:02.120]  rigged it, those damages could basically be less than what a regular oil or gas lease would be.
[2:36:02.120 --> 2:36:06.280]  And so I'm just now learning about that it was worse than I thought. And I know Dr. Nick
[2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:11.240]  baggage has represented tribes in this and his father and his brother. So he's a real expert on
[2:36:11.240 --> 2:36:15.880]  this because Alaska is one of the places where what it's 90 plus percent federal and state.
[2:36:15.880 --> 2:36:20.360]  And so there's a lot of this happening and that's some of the things Stevens was also tied into.
[2:36:20.360 --> 2:36:26.360]  Again, you have more experience than this than I do. Can you put into common sense language,
[2:36:26.360 --> 2:36:32.040]  kind of the smorgasbord I just threw out. Yeah, you know, the background on this really important
[2:36:32.040 --> 2:36:38.040]  and it starts with statehood back in 1958. And this is a big issue because in statehood,
[2:36:38.040 --> 2:36:43.400]  we were an independent territory to some extent. We were controlled by the US, but as a territory,
[2:36:43.400 --> 2:36:46.680]  we should have been offered a lot of different things. Well, one of the deals that was made in
[2:36:46.680 --> 2:36:52.280]  the statehood negotiations was the state would give up its surface estate in exchange for its
[2:36:52.280 --> 2:36:56.920]  mineral rights and oil and gas rights where the federal government ever had any of those rights.
[2:36:56.920 --> 2:37:00.920]  The state would get 90 percent of the rents and royalties paid to the federal government in
[2:37:00.920 --> 2:37:05.560]  exchange. We gave up a huge amount of our surface estate because under the Constitution,
[2:37:05.560 --> 2:37:10.120]  the federal government was only supposed to get, you know, post offices, military bases. And that
[2:37:10.120 --> 2:37:15.320]  was pretty much it, you know, in the parks and all this other stuff came in various land acts
[2:37:15.320 --> 2:37:21.640]  from the 1920s on on up. Well, the biggest land act in Alaska, aside from statehood was
[2:37:21.640 --> 2:37:27.000]  the Native Land Claims Settlement Act, which transferred 44 million acres and about $950
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:32.280]  million to the native corporations here in Alaska as a first settlement. And that gave them
[2:37:32.280 --> 2:37:36.520]  essentially 9 percent of everything because they got the mineral rights, energy rights,
[2:37:36.520 --> 2:37:41.080]  and everything, and had a priority selection before the state perfected its statehood
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:45.000]  selections and out of all federal land, which basically everything at the time.
[2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:51.240]  And so that happened. And then there was a million acres that went to the Mental Health Trust,
[2:37:51.240 --> 2:37:55.080]  which was set up to cover mental health issues for Alaska. So the federal government didn't
[2:37:55.080 --> 2:38:00.200]  have to underwrite it. So way back before statehood, they set up a university trust and gave them a
[2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:05.640]  million acres and set up a mental health trust and gave them a million acres. The idea was they would
[2:38:06.200 --> 2:38:11.480]  develop revenues from minerals and energy and surface rights to run their institutions so
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:15.320]  that the public didn't have to pay for them. But it was paid for out of public resources, which kind
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:19.960]  of makes sense when you think about a territory, not being a state, not having representatives
[2:38:19.960 --> 2:38:25.640]  in the Senate or the House and having sort of this caretaker relationship. And when oil was
[2:38:25.640 --> 2:38:29.400]  discovered, everything changed. You had to have the Native Land Claims Settlement Act because
[2:38:29.400 --> 2:38:33.800]  you couldn't get the international bankers to underwrite the pipeline. And that's when my dad
[2:38:33.800 --> 2:38:38.520]  was in Congress. He'd got the Native Land Claims done in his freshman year and then was working
[2:38:38.520 --> 2:38:44.120]  on the pipeline issue when he and the majority leader for the U.S. House disappeared. And Stevens
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:49.000]  was in office then. He was still in the Senate. He was appointed in 1968. He didn't win an election.
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:54.760]  He was actually appointed because of a vacancy in 1968. And then won his subsequent elections.
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:39:01.320]  And Stevens, and you know, goes back, I mean, to pre-state it. He was here as a BIA attorney,
[2:39:01.320 --> 2:39:07.400]  or Department of Interior, rather, attorney way back then. So he's one of the original dirt bags
[2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:12.200]  in all of this. He had a lot of respect. Absolutely. And you know, the thing is,
[2:39:12.760 --> 2:39:17.720]  he's done a lot for Alaska in a lot of ways. And no one can, you know, begrudge that. But what
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:23.000]  happened is over the decades, you kind of lose your perspective. And I'll tell you how all the
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:27.800]  payoffs work, how they get around the rules, so people get a bigger picture of this. You know,
[2:39:27.800 --> 2:39:31.800]  I mean, it's from the simplest things. Like, and I'm not saying necessarily this is about Ted Stevens,
[2:39:31.800 --> 2:39:35.960]  but about politicians in general. You know, they'll get involved in the poker game against the lobbyist.
[2:39:36.680 --> 2:39:42.920]  And man, that lobbyist is folding on four of a kind, you know. And making sure the other guy
[2:39:42.920 --> 2:39:48.440]  is walking away with the table. Well, that came out with the CIA director. They go to the Watergate
[2:39:48.440 --> 2:39:53.480]  Hotel and there's hookers on one floor, alcohol, and drugs if they want them on another. And you
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:58.600]  go in there and you win $100,000 a week if you want to go play poker with the defense contractors.
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:04.040]  Right. And this is the kind of illegal stuff that these guys slide around on. The other is,
[2:40:04.040 --> 2:40:08.680]  of course, speaking fees after they're out of office and when they can keep the money.
[2:40:08.680 --> 2:40:13.480]  And, you know, who's worth a million bucks for a speech? I mean, get real. It's a payoff. It's
[2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:19.160]  like, okay, you did your, you followed the party line and you did what you're told and now is the
[2:40:19.160 --> 2:40:25.000]  big payoff. And so one of the other ways is they get to invest in a little project that Joe Blow
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:29.400]  has. And oh, for 50 grand, don't worry, you're going to make a million in the first year. And
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:33.480]  they do. You know, they're the ones that you're warned about. That's like Hillary and the cattle
[2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:38.920]  futures. I mean, around here, that's how they do it. A corrupt developer, somebody else will
[2:40:38.920 --> 2:40:43.560]  come by from a city council person. Barack Obama's been caught doing this. A piece of land that's
[2:40:43.560 --> 2:40:48.920]  worth 200 grand on the tax rolls. Well, they'll just pay 600,000 or vice versa. The politician
[2:40:48.920 --> 2:40:53.880]  won a piece of land worth 100,000 and it gets bought for 300,000. Right. And this happens
[2:40:53.880 --> 2:40:57.720]  or the trade. One of the other things that happened with Stevens was a car, you know,
[2:40:57.720 --> 2:41:04.280]  was a classic Mustang traded for a $44,000 car. And the problem was there's a little,
[2:41:04.280 --> 2:41:08.760]  and 5,000 in cash. And if, but if you add up the highest book values on these, because they're
[2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:15.080]  available, the Mustangs are available. He got about a $20,000 discrepancy from reality to
[2:41:15.080 --> 2:41:19.320]  what he, what he did. You know, so you start looking at all that. Okay. Now, we know that's
[2:41:19.320 --> 2:41:24.280]  low level though. You know, it was kind of becoming an embarrassing, doddering, senile person saying
[2:41:24.280 --> 2:41:30.440]  silly things on TV. Meanwhile, we have Halliburton getting $16 million for a $100 blue tarp.
[2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:34.760]  We've got no bid contracts, trillions missing from Pentagon, all this corruption. It looked
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:38.840]  like Stevens was doing everything they told him. Was it because he became an embarrassment with
[2:41:38.840 --> 2:41:44.520]  the bridge to nowhere? Why did they go ahead and burn him? I, you know, I think not so much
[2:41:45.080 --> 2:41:49.000]  that is, is, you know, he's kind of an angry guy if you've ever watched him. And
[2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:53.880]  you know, it's not really the public service image that you get. It's kind of the bully.
[2:41:53.880 --> 2:41:58.520]  And that's not public service. A lot of people tolerated it, but you know, and at the end of the
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:04.040]  day, your friends are a whole nother matter. And he has a lot of friends for sure. But I think at
[2:42:04.040 --> 2:42:09.720]  the end of the day, it's really, he did a lot, you know, in terms of the earmarking process,
[2:42:09.720 --> 2:42:13.720]  and he tried to block that. So they wouldn't have to report who, you know, signed up for.
[2:42:13.720 --> 2:42:17.960]  Yeah, but what he did was just help take the oil and gas from the people and then just give them
[2:42:17.960 --> 2:42:23.000]  a bunch of quote, free federal money and then, and then advertise with a great job he done.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:25.400]  Right. And let's talk about the, the transfer of wealth.
[2:42:25.400 --> 2:42:29.880]  Well, I mean, I figured, let me ask you this. Are you aware of the fact that they're passing
[2:42:29.880 --> 2:42:36.040]  laws at all the states in many of the several states where now they're just running in and
[2:42:36.040 --> 2:42:39.080]  grabbing oil and gas on people's land without even asking?
[2:42:39.640 --> 2:42:44.600]  We, they tried to do it here and there was a 1200 people burned, showed up and burned the
[2:42:44.600 --> 2:42:49.000]  local legislator and effigy because he was taking money from the company trying to do it here. And
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:53.960]  they actually stopped it. And you know, there's a, the, the estates, the way they're split out,
[2:42:53.960 --> 2:42:58.280]  the surface estate and the mineral rights and the energy rights, they all run separately,
[2:42:58.280 --> 2:43:02.360]  and the water rights for a lot of states on the east coast, there's some provisions for
[2:43:02.360 --> 2:43:06.520]  energy rights. And in Texas, there are some titles that go back far enough where people had energy
[2:43:06.520 --> 2:43:12.360]  rights, but a lot of it is a situation where it's a split estate and you're right. And, and the
[2:43:12.360 --> 2:43:16.680]  thing about those takings is there was a U.S. Supreme Court decision that said they can take,
[2:43:16.680 --> 2:43:21.640]  not in the public interest, in an eminent domain case, but also for the benefit of some private
[2:43:21.640 --> 2:43:26.360]  company. Yeah. And they deem that that private company successes. New London kilo, yeah. Yeah,
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:31.720]  it's like, and you want to talk about fascism. I mean, how much more corporate does it get with a
[2:43:31.720 --> 2:43:36.840]  marriage with government? And this is the ultimate welfare. Oil and gas here on the offshore resources
[2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:41.400]  that are being auctioned off, like there's a fire sale going on, have enough proven value
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:48.360]  according to our own USGS to be valued today at $36 trillion. If we did what, what 80% of the
[2:43:48.360 --> 2:43:52.360]  rest of the world does is they have state owned oil companies and they contract to the oil and
[2:43:52.360 --> 2:43:57.000]  gas companies. So they make a profit and it's privately run, you know, in terms of efficiency,
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:43:59.800]  because they get a little bit over the cost of operations, eight, nine, 10%,
[2:44:00.840 --> 2:44:05.960]  but that much money would retire our national debt three times over. And if the government,
[2:44:05.960 --> 2:44:12.280]  if the government wasn't sitting on top, how much of the state is under federal control? It's about
[2:44:12.280 --> 2:44:18.360]  70% and all the offshore outside of the three mile limit. And in Alaska, outside of three mile limit
[2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:23.480]  are the big gigantic huge. So that should be opened up. I mean, I mean, not just the land,
[2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:29.960]  but the sea to, to US companies and citizens, but no, it's for the environment. And they use
[2:44:29.960 --> 2:44:34.120]  a few hippies as the front has nothing to do with the environment, does it? No, it doesn't. In fact,
[2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:39.320]  the big foundations that underwrite a lot of this Rockefeller Foundation, some of the others,
[2:44:39.320 --> 2:44:44.520]  you know, it's about tying up the resource sort of as a safety deposit box for the future for
[2:44:44.520 --> 2:44:49.560]  multinationals. And artificial scarcity and artificial scarcity. Yeah. And then they get the
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:53.640]  price up. Everybody's worrying about getting gas money to work. And I appreciate that. I mean,
[2:44:53.640 --> 2:44:59.080]  I know what that's about. And the fact is it shouldn't be this way, but now that you'll get
[2:44:59.080 --> 2:45:04.120]  to develop it. And you know, a lot of this, when you start to think about it, it's a spire sale that
[2:45:04.120 --> 2:45:09.160]  could solve our national problems. And instead, in a more balanced way with the industry. And as
[2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:13.480]  it is, people are going to freeze in the dark again this winter. Well, my point is, is there are a
[2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:18.600]  lot of private landowners from the Dakotas to Texas to even Alaska, I'm reading about in Utah,
[2:45:18.600 --> 2:45:23.320]  where they never get the oil and gas or call off their property. By the time the, the, the
[2:45:23.320 --> 2:45:29.160]  companies are done, they might get one, one, you know, thousands of what they were supposed to get.
[2:45:29.160 --> 2:45:33.720]  And it's just, it's just getting so corrupt. It's just so amazing. And the fairness of this is
[2:45:33.720 --> 2:45:37.400]  about legislation. You know, and it's got to be starting, they need to change it to where
[2:45:38.040 --> 2:45:42.760]  the surface to stakeholder, even though they segregated to those rights, at least in the
[2:45:42.760 --> 2:45:47.000]  sense of in the future, we need to have them run the way they used to, where you had some water
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:50.440]  rights, you had some mineral rights, you had your timber rights, you know, and make sure they run
[2:45:50.440 --> 2:45:54.760]  together. And where they're separated, there needs to be a lot more consideration of the
[2:45:54.760 --> 2:45:58.840]  surface to stakeholder when these developments are planned. Because that's another big scam that
[2:45:58.840 --> 2:46:03.000]  we have 1% privately held outside of the native corporation, state, federal and local land.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:08.440]  1% probably held in Alaska. And then what is it? 5% probably held in Nevada.
[2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:12.600]  I think it's something like that. And, you know, the native corporations hold,
[2:46:12.600 --> 2:46:17.400]  you know, 9%, which is great. And they're using it in really, really good ways. But the
[2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:22.360]  state and the federal government, you know, they had home setting here up until the mid-60s,
[2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:27.400]  and you could still get trade sites up until the early 70s. And they cut all that out. And,
[2:46:27.400 --> 2:46:31.800]  you know, that was the way in which you transferred to the average person based on hard work,
[2:46:31.800 --> 2:46:37.880]  believe me. Really hard work. Certain rights that you could have. Well, they cut all that off.
[2:46:38.440 --> 2:46:42.600]  And the federal government has retained huge, vast estate. And then on the statehood act,
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:46.600]  that said, we're supposed to get 90%, U.S. Supreme Court said they could change that at
[2:46:46.600 --> 2:46:51.240]  will. And they did in the course of the National Naval Petroleum Reserve. And they're giving us
[2:46:51.240 --> 2:46:58.040]  half instead of 90%. Meanwhile, this is so complex. This is so complex that even educated people
[2:46:58.040 --> 2:47:03.880]  have terrible understanding. And that's why we're going into tyranny. It's just unbelievable.
[2:47:03.880 --> 2:47:08.920]  Right. The things that are going on. And I see examples of Lignite mines all over Central Texas,
[2:47:08.920 --> 2:47:15.560]  East Texas, where somebody doesn't want their family ranch or farm bulldozed. And the companies
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:20.760]  aren't even offering a market value. And then if they fight it, they basically end up almost
[2:47:20.760 --> 2:47:24.760]  getting nothing because they fought it. And they've codified it into fraudulent state law
[2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:30.040]  to really legalize stealing. Right. And this is here in Alaska, you know,
[2:47:30.040 --> 2:47:34.360]  the surface of states, even when they're doing public right of ways and as like running over a
[2:47:34.360 --> 2:47:40.680]  business, they actually compensate them for fair market value based on independent appraisals.
[2:47:40.680 --> 2:47:45.080]  The state does. And they cover their business losses for some period of time as they're being
[2:47:45.080 --> 2:47:50.200]  disrupted and moved. And those settlements, I've never heard of them going to court. People have
[2:47:50.200 --> 2:47:55.480]  always felt like they got fair value in negotiating it. But I agree. And most states doesn't happen.
[2:47:55.480 --> 2:48:00.680]  And what happened up here that caused a big outcry is the state leased, what are called
[2:48:00.680 --> 2:48:06.120]  coal bed methane, which are shallow leases that are non-competitive. And they can go up to 3000
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:12.440]  foot wells. And then the Matsu Valley, which is highly populated, they decided to hire the local
[2:48:12.440 --> 2:48:17.960]  legislator to be their PR guy. And this was a cabinet maker by trade. So he was their PR guy.
[2:48:18.760 --> 2:48:23.800]  They burned him in effigy. He was almost thrown out of office, but decided not to run for health
[2:48:23.800 --> 2:48:29.640]  reasons. As the recall petitions were perfected and filed with the state a few years ago. And,
[2:48:29.640 --> 2:48:32.440]  you know, all of this kind of nonsense. And the surface of the state holder said,
[2:48:32.440 --> 2:48:37.480]  wait a minute, you're not coming in my yard, literally, and punching a hole in the ground
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:41.560]  and not talking to me about it. Now, there's some people that wanted to do that that had big
[2:48:41.560 --> 2:48:46.280]  acreage where it wouldn't disturb other landowners and find they negotiated their deals. And I guess
[2:48:46.280 --> 2:48:49.880]  there's some guys that are actually getting permitted and going to go forward, but they did
[2:48:49.880 --> 2:48:56.280]  it on a wholesale basis, you know, the whole area. And, you know, people were totally upset.
[2:48:56.280 --> 2:49:01.320]  So they redid the process now to where there's a better public process. And they killed most of
[2:49:01.320 --> 2:49:06.120]  that. And it seems to be working where people are getting fair value, but I want to shift
[2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:09.320]  gears completely out of this as we're going to come back and take a few final calls for
[2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:13.160]  you and let you go. And I'm going to try to get you and your brother on next week. But
[2:49:13.800 --> 2:49:16.760]  have you seen the latest? It just came out last night. I don't expect that you have,
[2:49:16.760 --> 2:49:21.240]  but I want your take on it. Headline, Cheney Neocons considered killing Americans in pretext
[2:49:21.240 --> 2:49:25.480]  to attack Iran at a media conference a few weeks ago on the YouTube videos out there
[2:49:26.280 --> 2:49:30.200]  at the Campus Progress Journalism Conference, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour
[2:49:30.200 --> 2:49:35.880]  Hirsch revealed how Neocons convened around Dick Cheney a few months ago and brainstormed ways
[2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:41.480]  to kick off World War four as they finally call it. They wanted to build ships almost identical
[2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:46.200]  that look the same as the Iranian patrol boats and basically have Navy SEALs come in and fire
[2:49:47.080 --> 2:49:52.440]  on the larger ships and have a shootout between them and then put that on the news.
[2:49:52.440 --> 2:49:56.920]  And then Cy Hirsch just reports it like it's no big deal and says, oh, we decided not to put it
[2:49:56.920 --> 2:50:00.920]  in the magazine. I mean, the White House source confirmed it, but, you know, that's not news.
[2:50:00.920 --> 2:50:06.360]  I mean, what is wrong with Hirsch? You know, it is bizarre. You know, well, it's access,
[2:50:06.360 --> 2:50:10.520]  you know, see, and that's the thing that's so important to these guys. They whore themselves
[2:50:10.520 --> 2:50:14.040]  out for that little bit of access, because otherwise, you know, this administration is
[2:50:14.040 --> 2:50:18.280]  famous for just turning you off, but they got to report something. So, you know, that's the
[2:50:18.280 --> 2:50:23.400]  way it goes. And nobody picks it up. You know, it virtually goes nowhere. It hit a little blip
[2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:28.520]  on the radar screen for 30 seconds and was gone. You know, and that's how these things play out.
[2:50:28.520 --> 2:50:34.520]  And it's because there's way, way too much power, and there's no check in that power.
[2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:40.120]  I mean, when you can, for a few grand and a few trinkets, bribe your Congress,
[2:50:40.120 --> 2:50:44.920]  which is what's gone on, and end your legislatures in places where it matters.
[2:50:44.920 --> 2:50:51.560]  And what happens is, slowly and over time, it erodes not just the integrity of that Constitution,
[2:50:51.560 --> 2:50:57.640]  but it erodes our lifestyles as Americans and look around from NAFTA to all of the
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:51:00.440]  ridiculous trade agreements. Stand there. Got a break. Finish the point after the break.
[2:51:00.440 --> 2:51:05.560]  Out of Nick Beckett. May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message
[2:51:05.560 --> 2:51:11.000]  of information. 9-Eleven was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:15.080]  a puppet for the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage?
[2:51:15.080 --> 2:51:19.240]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.?
[2:51:19.240 --> 2:51:25.960]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of
[2:51:25.960 --> 2:51:31.400]  despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[2:51:31.400 --> 2:51:38.040]  a global awakening has taken place. An inside job? How dare you?
[2:51:41.160 --> 2:51:44.680]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:51:44.680 --> 2:51:49.560]  Oh, hell, it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth
[2:51:49.560 --> 2:51:53.000]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:04.120]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level. Wake up, Protestant America. There is an
[2:52:04.120 --> 2:52:09.400]  ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state. This confederation of evangelicals,
[2:52:09.400 --> 2:52:14.120]  Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting block. Their agenda
[2:52:14.120 --> 2:52:18.840]  is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation. Our forefathers wrote the Bill of
[2:52:18.840 --> 2:52:23.240]  Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience. History and the Bible
[2:52:23.240 --> 2:52:27.800]  proved to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate. It must be our love
[2:52:27.800 --> 2:52:32.920]  of God and of country that prompts or constrains us. This will change the character, not civil
[2:52:32.920 --> 2:52:37.240]  enforcement. From history, we saw that when church and state united, known as papal Rome,
[2:52:37.240 --> 2:52:41.800]  religious intolerance resulted. This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of
[2:52:41.800 --> 2:52:47.320]  our nation. America and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda. Protestant America, awake before it
[2:52:47.320 --> 2:52:53.000]  is too late. The prophecies are fast fulfilling. Jesus is coming soon. For free materials call

[2:54:39.800 --> 2:54:43.880]  Let's give out your brother's website as well. He was already leading in the polls against
[2:54:43.880 --> 2:54:50.600]  Ted Stevens, Mr. Tildey Internet, Mr. Accepting Gifts, Ted Stevens, but now it's really looking
[2:54:50.600 --> 2:54:53.800]  good. I mean, I don't want to jinx anything, but it looks like your brother's going to be in the
[2:54:53.800 --> 2:55:00.520]  next senator from Alaska. It looks very good for him. He's in double digits as of the latest
[2:55:00.520 --> 2:55:07.240]  polls on going this week. He's going to have a tough race. He's raised a million and a quarter
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:14.520]  in four months from 4,100 people, which is an incredible base to work from. And a lot of
[2:55:14.520 --> 2:55:18.760]  those are outside of Alaska. So people want to get involved in this campaign. That way,
[2:55:18.760 --> 2:55:26.280]  go to Beggachbegich.com and get involved in his campaign. He's going to make a big difference for
[2:55:26.280 --> 2:55:30.840]  not just Alaska, but for the rest of the country. Beggach.com. Wow. And I'm going to enjoy the
[2:55:30.840 --> 2:55:36.200]  access through you and then getting him on once he is a senator. We're getting just, I mean,
[2:55:36.200 --> 2:55:40.120]  over time, I guess being here on the air for 13 years, you get to know more people and as they
[2:55:40.120 --> 2:55:44.760]  move into more positions. That's just kind of how it works. And so many people, Dr. Beggach,
[2:55:44.760 --> 2:55:48.280]  think we're supposed to be losers, think that we're supposed to fail at all this, think that we
[2:55:48.280 --> 2:55:52.600]  don't have any power and the corrupt elite is invincible. No, they're always scared of the
[2:55:52.600 --> 2:55:57.400]  people and alternative media because they know history and they know what highly motivated groups
[2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:02.920]  can do. And so many of my listeners are great, but so many others get mad when we have celebrities
[2:56:02.920 --> 2:56:10.120]  on or mad when we have big people on and get upset and suspicious when Governor Ventura or
[2:56:10.120 --> 2:56:14.200]  all these other people come on and say 9-11 is an inside job. No, folks, we're starting to turn
[2:56:14.200 --> 2:56:19.720]  the corner. We don't need to be beautiful losers. We need to win. And I think realizing that we
[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:24.280]  can win and having that attitude is a big part of the battle, Dr. I agree with you. And that,
[2:56:24.280 --> 2:56:28.360]  you know, you're only defeated when you stop breathing, you know, I mean, then it's over
[2:56:28.360 --> 2:56:33.480]  and then whatever happens, happens, you know, but there's a lot to say for what a few people can do.
[2:56:33.480 --> 2:56:38.840]  And, you know, my family, although we're different in a lot of our politics, certain things are
[2:56:38.840 --> 2:56:44.120]  fundamental, you know, in the personal privacy issues, gun ownership, the things that are
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:49.560]  important to most Americans to keep the government honest are the same for us. And, you know,
[2:56:49.560 --> 2:56:55.480]  that's what's been missing in so much of this is a recognition of where the root of the Constitution
[2:56:55.480 --> 2:57:01.000]  lies. And that is in the freedoms and the liberty to debate, to have discussion. When you have things
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:06.200]  like the Internet, the 21st century communication tool, it would have been like our founding fathers
[2:57:06.200 --> 2:57:10.920]  being told, no more mail unless we open it all. You know, and they would have been another revolution.
[2:57:10.920 --> 2:57:16.760]  The fact is the privacy issues, the complex issues of today require a new generation of leadership
[2:57:16.760 --> 2:57:22.440]  out of both parties. And that's what's long overdue. And Ted Stevens in 40 years has done some
[2:57:22.440 --> 2:57:27.560]  things for Alaska that are great. But at this stage of his career, he has lost touch with the
[2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:31.320]  fundamentals of what government is. You know, when I was a tribal administrator, we invited
[2:57:31.320 --> 2:57:36.120]  him in four different occasions to come and see what our tribe was doing. And rather than ever
[2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:40.840]  show up or allow anyone on his staff to come, even when it was arranged, he preempted it.
[2:57:40.840 --> 2:57:46.840]  And it was because he wanted to wipe out every tribal government in Alaska to even solidify
[2:57:46.840 --> 2:57:52.280]  more power for a federal agency that already has way more than they need, not just here but everywhere
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:57.800]  else. And the things that he does have authority to do, like oil and gas, have been given away
[2:57:57.800 --> 2:58:02.360]  when we could have been negotiating much better deals with the oil industry and paying off the
[2:58:02.360 --> 2:58:06.360]  national debt. I mean, think about that for your grandchildren. We could have done it this
[2:58:06.360 --> 2:58:12.920]  generation and we still can. And that requires a different view of how government works and
[2:58:12.920 --> 2:58:18.040]  a different view of what the public resources should be generating in fair market value.
[2:58:18.040 --> 2:58:21.880]  And that's what's not happening with our natural resources in Alaska.
[2:58:21.880 --> 2:58:25.000]  We got a break before we end this hour and come back and take two or three calls in the next

[3:00:24.680 --> 3:00:31.240]  Knock on wood. Ted Stevens the crook. Such a gentleman. He's trying to be nice to Ted Stevens.
[3:00:31.240 --> 3:00:36.760]  Ted Stevens is a complete monster. Let's go ahead and talk to Aaron in California
[3:00:36.760 --> 3:00:41.720]  than Betsy and Ingrid trying to get to Judith and Catherine. Go ahead, Aaron. You're on the air.
[3:00:42.760 --> 3:00:49.000]  Hi Alex. Hi Dr. Baggage. I wanted to come up about Harp actually. I know that back in 2001
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:54.840]  they had 180 antennas and now I believe it's at 360. They're finishing it here in 2008. I mean
[3:00:54.840 --> 3:01:00.280]  just how much power is that? Well I have the director of Harp on a month ago and he said
[3:01:00.280 --> 3:01:05.400]  they have 3 million watts. Is that correct, Dr. Baggage? In terms of input power but it's not
[3:01:05.400 --> 3:01:12.200]  a good descriptor because you have to do an antenna gain and factor in also what happens
[3:01:12.200 --> 3:01:16.440]  when you capitalize on energy. That's right. Take FM with different types of
[3:01:16.440 --> 3:01:22.840]  dibowl. You can put 10 watts in and get 40 watts out at effective radiated power.
[3:01:23.480 --> 3:01:26.920]  Right and so you've got to do the multipliers and so you actually got
[3:01:27.640 --> 3:01:32.520]  you're approaching at 180 antenna. You're getting about half to where the half of a
[3:01:32.520 --> 3:01:37.880]  billion watts of effective radiated power and they're headed up to 360. Actually they have
[3:01:37.880 --> 3:01:41.560]  180 constructed. You know I should have brought this up. I had the director on Otis and the
[3:01:41.560 --> 3:01:45.960]  audio that I had him on for an hour but there were military officers who wouldn't say they were
[3:01:45.960 --> 3:01:51.560]  popping in during the breaks and then waiting and then you can't say that but over the line
[3:01:51.560 --> 3:01:56.360]  where people on air couldn't hear it and then the guy admitted that they can turn the aurora
[3:01:56.360 --> 3:02:02.680]  borealis basically on. Did you hear that? Right and in fact I've got to listen to that
[3:02:02.680 --> 3:02:06.840]  tractor. One of your folks sent that over to me because next time we're on I want to talk about
[3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:11.480]  what they said and show really how they twist the truth. We just did this with Wired Magazine.
[3:02:11.480 --> 3:02:16.360]  They sent one of their associate editors up for a four return into a four and a half hour interview
[3:02:16.360 --> 3:02:21.560]  and then a three hours to take one portrait. You know it's like a long long couple of days.
[3:02:21.560 --> 3:02:26.120]  That's why I hate mainstream media. They're so slow. Oh but it's going to be very thorough
[3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:30.200]  and and I think they're going to finally put a story together that really tells the story in
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:34.920]  terms of that and especially these issues that the military continues to raise and we were able
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:42.840]  to get a lot of documents from the family of Ben Eastland that we were able to use to finally
[3:02:42.840 --> 3:02:48.840]  resolve some of those. We got the chronology of all the early meetings with DARPA and all of the
[3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:54.360]  funders and the Jason Group interactions and the interactions with ARCO that were proprietary
[3:02:54.360 --> 3:02:59.080]  ARCO at that time. In fact I need to fax all that stuff to you in advance of that next program
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:03.480]  because you're going to be blown away. Yeah let me just set you up for about two weeks out. We'll
[3:03:03.480 --> 3:03:07.560]  do like an hour and a half all in harp and really talk about what it is. You know I was thinking
[3:03:07.560 --> 3:03:11.320]  about maybe trying to get but I see I don't think they would allow it because I mean they had like
[3:03:11.320 --> 3:03:22.360]  different spooks on the line while the director was on and never been interrogated so much you
[3:03:22.360 --> 3:03:27.080]  know once it was time for the show and then they said we want you to fly up here. We want to fly
[3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:31.880]  you up here and show you it's nice and then last time I checked they're inviting me up there but
[3:03:31.880 --> 3:03:36.360]  I don't know if I want to go up there. Well the thing about it is it's like somebody going into
[3:03:36.360 --> 3:03:40.760]  a nuclear reactor you know I mean what are you going to see. Well that's kind of like with
[3:03:40.760 --> 3:03:48.680]  Halibut. Forty and slip Halibut now with what was the inron in California the later secretary
[3:03:48.680 --> 3:03:55.400]  of the army white he would lead him into fake data on a fake energy trading room and of course
[3:03:55.400 --> 3:03:58.760]  it was all just being done on a ballot sheet whatever the execs wanted to make up each day
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:03.240]  it was all just made up chart overcharging and billions of days some days and it was just all
[3:04:03.240 --> 3:04:09.480]  fake. Yeah exactly so you know when you start to look at all this and you start to see you know how
[3:04:09.480 --> 3:04:15.640]  all this blows out and what we really need is more accountability more responsibility in terms
[3:04:15.640 --> 3:04:19.800]  of government and less corporate welfare because when you start to look at all the transfers and
[3:04:19.800 --> 3:04:25.240]  all the things that get shuffled around it's all about you know giving someone greater access to
[3:04:25.240 --> 3:04:30.600]  markets or taxpayers no one ever thinks about us as human beings anymore and that's a whole different
[3:04:30.600 --> 3:04:37.160]  way of well the director was also saying that these millions of affected watts of radio energy
[3:04:37.160 --> 3:04:40.760]  wasn't bad for people around there and I said but it's admitted you don't want to get near an AM
[3:04:40.760 --> 3:04:46.280]  transmitter and he said no that's not true I mean it was ridiculous he sounded childlike
[3:04:46.280 --> 3:04:50.520]  listen we'll talk to you soon dr. baggage we'll talk to your brother next week thanks for coming
[3:04:50.520 --> 3:04:54.440]  on with us. Hey I'm looking forward to talking with you again and it'll always be a good program
[3:04:54.440 --> 3:04:58.280]  take care you better take care there goes dr. nick baggage his brother about to beat Ted Stevens

[3:08:32.680 --> 3:08:39.880]  what he's saying we believe he was told this by this executive but there's just some other
[3:08:39.880 --> 3:08:43.320]  problems with that we don't know they're trying to plant this info on him or this executive
[3:08:43.320 --> 3:08:47.240]  believes it but somebody's threatening your family and saying we're going to get you if you don't
[3:08:47.240 --> 3:08:53.080]  shut up but by the way we'll let you go out and talk about this when his video has been
[3:08:53.080 --> 3:08:57.400]  on number one on Google one of his interviews one of the speeches he gave tens of millions
[3:08:57.400 --> 3:09:01.720]  watching it every month I mean it did become a phenomenon and I do believe he was threatened
[3:09:01.720 --> 3:09:08.440]  it's just that in the mechanics of the energy the global energy market exploration delivering
[3:09:08.440 --> 3:09:14.600]  the market it just doesn't line up with the facts in a lot of different places so we'll talk
[3:09:14.600 --> 3:09:19.080]  about that also I don't know Bob Chapman's aware of this but he's usually just as aware of the
[3:09:19.080 --> 3:09:24.440]  current news as I am or more so but we broke yesterday here I mean it came out on think
[3:09:24.440 --> 3:09:28.920]  progress but we really pushed it out on info wars.com we now have a more detailed article on
[3:09:28.920 --> 3:09:35.080]  info wars.com we want everybody to get out to the forewinds chaining neocons considered killing
[3:09:35.080 --> 3:09:41.160]  americans and pretext to attack Iran in a video posted here youtube taped to the campus progress
[3:09:41.160 --> 3:09:46.840]  journalism conference earlier this month the Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Seymour Hirsch
[3:09:46.840 --> 3:09:52.920]  revealed how the neocons convened around Dick Cheney and Brainstorm's ways to kick off
[3:09:52.920 --> 3:09:57.800]  world war four as they finally call their pet project started war in the middle east and central
[3:09:57.800 --> 3:10:02.520]  asia and he went on to say they wanted to create boats build boats and shipyards in just a few
[3:10:02.520 --> 3:10:09.640]  weeks that look like the same blue pt boats the iranians used to patrol their waters have navy
[3:10:09.640 --> 3:10:15.000]  seals dress up go in with a bunch of arms and then attack it says a shootout that means both sides
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:20.920]  against our destroyers saying it was iranians that maybe kill the seals and Seymour just said you
[3:10:20.920 --> 3:10:26.200]  know the newspaper didn't want to post that you know because they didn't carry it out but they
[3:10:26.200 --> 3:10:32.360]  did our source in the White House did say this was among 11 other 12 total plans they had now
[3:10:32.360 --> 3:10:36.760]  now we know they've done stuff like this before the White House memo other things this is smoking
[3:10:36.760 --> 3:10:41.800]  gun stuff especially Seymour I mean he's never lied he's always been right he's always had inside
[3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:46.920]  scoop almost to the point it's like he represents an element of the new world order I mean it's the
[3:10:46.920 --> 3:10:53.240]  New Yorker magazine and he's allowed to do this so and he has these incredible sources going back
[3:10:53.240 --> 3:10:57.080]  to vietnam he broke operation phoenix and they were torturing people to death and their kids and
[3:10:57.080 --> 3:11:02.840]  from the parents and using the former zoo and in Saigon to torture people and you know all this
[3:11:02.840 --> 3:11:06.280]  he's just broken hundreds of things Pulitzer prize winner probably the greatest living
[3:11:06.280 --> 3:11:11.160]  investigative journalist out there bob let's cover this first a were you aware of this
[3:11:11.160 --> 3:11:15.000]  and and be you know I don't make stuff up so I've told you about it what's your take regardless
[3:11:16.680 --> 3:11:23.960]  first of all I knew about it and picked it up the same way you did and these kind of operations
[3:11:23.960 --> 3:11:30.360]  have been going on for years it's just they haven't been as aggressive and blatant as they have in
[3:11:30.360 --> 3:11:39.480]  the last eight years the means to an end sort of thing in order to achieve some financial
[3:11:39.480 --> 3:11:46.600]  or political objective and there are people in government who are very interested in enriching
[3:11:46.600 --> 3:11:54.680]  themselves as well as putting forth a program that that pursues their aims so I'm not surprised at
[3:11:54.680 --> 3:12:03.080]  all and uh you know there was a time when they backed off doing that during the 50s and the 60s
[3:12:03.080 --> 3:12:07.480]  and the Russians during the Cold War did too they had an agreement you know we won't kill you
[3:12:07.480 --> 3:12:15.320]  up people if you don't kill ours and this lasted quite a long while but when we got into Vietnam
[3:12:15.320 --> 3:12:21.560]  and we did what we did things started to evolve from that that were extremely negative things
[3:12:21.560 --> 3:12:29.000]  like what you've just brought up and we saw the Iran Contra affair the smugly amass of amounts of
[3:12:29.640 --> 3:12:36.680]  of illegal drugs into the United States by the participants and today we get these kinds of one
[3:12:36.680 --> 3:12:46.840]  of 12 possible scenarios to get us involved in World War four it is truly believable if you have
[3:12:47.640 --> 3:12:50.520]  looked at things the way that Alex and I have
[3:12:52.680 --> 3:12:58.920]  keep talking about that I mean keep fleshing this out for me Bob this is a huge deal I mean this is
[3:12:58.920 --> 3:13:06.040]  a huge issue to to have the New Yorker deciding to not run with the story not because it wasn't
[3:13:06.040 --> 3:13:10.680]  accurate because well they didn't carry out these stage terror attacks I mean the fact that the Vice
[3:13:10.680 --> 3:13:19.880]  President was proposing this this is huge I mean even considering it is monstrous I mean that the
[3:13:19.880 --> 3:13:27.720]  man has to be demented and you know the the other side of the Illuminous Coin uh is the big no
[3:13:27.720 --> 3:13:34.760]  Brzezinski saying I mean these guys the Charlie's off I mean they just set the New World Order back
[3:13:34.760 --> 3:13:41.720]  30 years well we've got to take them out of power they can't do those things and he said the same
[3:13:41.720 --> 3:13:46.600]  thing again here just a few weeks ago which I quoted them in the in the issue that came out
[3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:52.840]  yesterday and I have to agree with them I mean he's the enemy as far as I'm concerned but these
[3:13:52.840 --> 3:14:01.640]  guys in the White House they're not only the enemy they're crazy so what do we do about this Bob I
[3:14:01.640 --> 3:14:06.840]  mean how do we educate the public and show them that we have smoking gun evidence here and then
[3:14:07.960 --> 3:14:12.680]  even our own movement has gotten so trained to accept these crimes by these individuals that
[3:14:12.680 --> 3:14:17.880]  it's kind of like oh hum I mean neocons write editorials saying we need giant terror attacks in
[3:14:17.880 --> 3:14:24.120]  America 9-11 was great for us in the Philadelphia Daily News we have Gary Hart who wrote up the
[3:14:24.120 --> 3:14:29.240]  CFR plan for the Homeland Security system who's definitely one of them saying oh yeah we stage
[3:14:29.240 --> 3:14:33.640]  terror attacks and open letters I mean these bastards are getting really arrogant here why are they
[3:14:33.640 --> 3:14:40.680]  doing that well I think that they're close to and pushing toward a total government at least in
[3:14:40.680 --> 3:14:48.120]  in their minds and eyes and they see it's a culmination of hundreds of years of attempting to
[3:14:48.120 --> 3:14:53.320]  ring about a world government and they think they're getting very close and the other hand
[3:14:53.320 --> 3:14:59.560]  uh Brzezinski says hey you guys are missing the point here we're not getting close we've been
[3:14:59.560 --> 3:15:07.320]  stopped at the past and there's serious serious problems in what we're trying to do and we're
[3:15:07.320 --> 3:15:13.080]  very very concerned that this whole thing may fall apart on us so you've got two groups of
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:21.400]  thinking one is sane and one not sane and you know how do you do something about it we're
[3:15:21.400 --> 3:15:28.760]  doing everything we can by being on the air and publishing you know I had an email the other day
[3:15:29.400 --> 3:15:34.680]  not pertaining to this sort of thing but I call a gentleman up because I call everybody up who
[3:15:34.680 --> 3:15:41.320]  asked me to and he said it would be a great idea if we had a million or two people million people
[3:15:41.320 --> 3:15:50.120]  march on Washington regarding the Federal Reserve well if we all feel strongly enough about this
[3:15:50.120 --> 3:15:58.200]  incident that Cheney and his gang of murderers and tortures and rapists are going to do these
[3:15:58.200 --> 3:16:03.880]  kind of programs well why don't we get a million people to walk on walk have a walk march on
[3:16:03.880 --> 3:16:10.440]  Washington and tell them we're not going to put up with this anymore Bob why do you think so many
[3:16:10.440 --> 3:16:19.960]  people who see themselves as quote conservatives just say hey tortures good rapes good murders
[3:16:19.960 --> 3:16:25.480]  good nukem all they don't understand that once you dehumanize the Iraqis or anybody else that
[3:16:25.480 --> 3:16:32.040]  you've built a government and an elite that will do that right back at home to you and they dehumanize
[3:16:32.040 --> 3:16:42.280]  themselves there's no justification for for those kinds of thoughts those kinds of actions I know
[3:16:42.280 --> 3:16:49.480]  that sometimes you are forced to go to war but most of the wars that we've had are have been
[3:16:49.480 --> 3:16:56.120]  unavoidable they usually caused by either financial or political interests you know such as the
[3:16:56.120 --> 3:17:04.040]  Second World War everybody who's read knows it was a setup and on on both on both Japan as well
[3:17:04.040 --> 3:17:12.040]  as in Europe and and so people have got to think about not allowing this to happen and it has
[3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:19.720]  nothing to do with conservatives who believe in that sort of thing it has something to do with
[3:17:19.720 --> 3:17:25.960]  everybody who believes in that sort of thing and you know what's been very very encouraging
[3:17:26.920 --> 3:17:33.960]  and I talked this over with Tony Hilda not too long ago is that we've had a movement of people
[3:17:33.960 --> 3:17:39.640]  from the right to the center and from the left to the center so to speak and it's the most
[3:17:39.640 --> 3:17:46.760]  important thing that's happened in the last 10 years in America because now we're talking with
[3:17:46.760 --> 3:17:54.520]  and coordinating with people who have the same desires that we have and there's no
[3:17:54.520 --> 3:18:01.240]  political label on it and so if we're free if the conservative republicans quote in quotes
[3:18:01.880 --> 3:18:08.120]  think that those are good things they should rethink it and maybe they should think about
[3:18:08.120 --> 3:18:14.920]  not being conservative republicans anymore because what they're thinking of are allowing to happen
[3:18:15.480 --> 3:18:21.320]  is just morally wrong well it is and they're not exempt from all of this too I think it's a
[3:18:21.320 --> 3:18:25.480]  decadence a disconnection from reality they haven't really lived they haven't seen the dark side
[3:18:25.480 --> 3:18:29.720]  that cheney likes to talk about so they think it's cute and funny and macho no being a thug
[3:18:29.720 --> 3:18:34.200]  supporting evil supporting killing innocence is not tough and macho what's tough and macho
[3:18:34.200 --> 3:18:39.800]  is standing up for the week being strong having a higher you know moral compass than those around
[3:18:39.800 --> 3:18:44.040]  you and and and you know take the left they're not calling themselves the left anymore i had former
[3:18:44.040 --> 3:18:48.760]  congressman dan hamburg on who always thought of himself as a liberal and he said look you know
[3:18:48.760 --> 3:18:52.680]  i'm into the second amendment now now i totally understand it i know it's both parties i know
[3:18:52.680 --> 3:18:59.320]  we need to be armed and and all the liberals i know are off buying ak-47s and they finally get it i
[3:18:59.320 --> 3:19:04.760]  mean i i have to come in the left i mean are you seeing the same thing i'm saying bob you know up
[3:19:04.760 --> 3:19:12.680]  until eight years ago about 80 percent of my subscribers were conservatives today it's 5050
[3:19:12.680 --> 3:19:19.960]  and we've got x marxist linus socialist you name it and i'm happy to have them yeah they're finally

[3:24:16.280 --> 3:24:20.360]  lindsay williams we think he's a great guy we're talking privately on it yesterday we both have
[3:24:20.360 --> 3:24:25.880]  misgivings on the same issues the story just has problems whether we believe what he's saying
[3:24:25.880 --> 3:24:31.400]  we believe he believes what he's saying but this issue we're going to be paying $50 a gallon uh a
[3:24:31.400 --> 3:24:35.880]  barrel gas and they're going to be paying you know two dollars a gallon in the next year it just
[3:24:35.880 --> 3:24:44.040]  doesn't fit with a lot of the data and input that we have first you've got to look at the fact that
[3:24:44.040 --> 3:24:52.360]  um arco has been part of um a bp for some time most of those people are retired i don't know that
[3:24:52.360 --> 3:25:03.160]  they're in touch or not it's just a question um the uh the occurrence of major fields uh such as
[3:25:03.160 --> 3:25:08.280]  an indonesia first of all it would take at least two years for it to get online if it was uh earth
[3:25:08.280 --> 3:25:16.600]  bound so to speak indonesia is uh is uh importing oil presently uh i know that surprises people but
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:23.160]  that's true and uh they're a member of opec and although they have recently at least for the
[3:25:23.160 --> 3:25:28.520]  time being bowed out not knowing that they have another field so to speak and i don't really
[3:25:28.520 --> 3:25:35.560]  think that the government need indonesia uh the important people in that country uh could not know
[3:25:35.560 --> 3:25:41.320]  about some field that was waiting to be developed as far as the russians are concerned they're not
[3:25:41.320 --> 3:25:45.240]  going to do anything the new world ought to tell them to they're going to do what they want to do
[3:25:45.240 --> 3:25:53.400]  and it'll take seven years in the arctic if they are drilling um deeply in water to bring about
[3:25:53.400 --> 3:25:59.560]  production and uh yeah that's a good point these wells are hard to drill on dry land when you're
[3:25:59.560 --> 3:26:09.720]  talking 30 000 40 000 feet well that's correct and um i don't i don't believe that um uh that there
[3:26:09.720 --> 3:26:17.160]  is such fields uh they may find them but i don't think that they found them yet it's possible but
[3:26:17.160 --> 3:26:24.200]  it's not probable and uh and so and and why would russia want to overproduce or indonesia
[3:26:24.200 --> 3:26:29.240]  to dry prices down unless somebody put a gun to their head and you know i worked against
[3:26:29.240 --> 3:26:33.080]  the russians you don't put a gun to their head they shoot back and they're quite good at it
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:39.320]  quite frankly uh just ask any german to survive world war two i mean they kill ratio might have
[3:26:39.320 --> 3:26:43.960]  been 20 to 1 against the russians but they kept right on coming they got a lot of guts and they're
[3:26:43.960 --> 3:26:54.360]  not stupid uh also uh you know the major oil companies are heavily invested in this ethanol
[3:26:54.360 --> 3:27:00.520]  thing and if the price of gasoline and oil go down uh it's going to really raise havoc with
[3:27:00.520 --> 3:27:09.960]  their investments and so uh i also think that 50 dollar oil is is possible but we would have to
[3:27:09.960 --> 3:27:15.960]  have a very deep recession and depression and uh to have to have that happen and particularly
[3:27:15.960 --> 3:27:21.560]  depression because during the nation would have to come to a complete hyperinflation
[3:27:21.560 --> 3:27:26.920]  exactly would have the opposite and then after it totally imploded if the entire economy ended
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:34.040]  flatlined then you might see oil drop because nobody could buy it yes that's true and and also
[3:27:34.680 --> 3:27:42.520]  um i see a very very bottom line of um of 80 dollars a barrel over the next two years
[3:27:42.520 --> 3:27:48.840]  and in all probability that's more likely it'll be 100 to 120 dollars a barrel because every nation
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:54.520]  in the world is inflating their money supply money and credit the average is plus eight to 14
[3:27:54.520 --> 3:28:01.560]  percent a year inflation is raging it's raging it's just that people know it but there's no
[3:28:01.560 --> 3:28:07.800]  verification unless you listen to this program and a few other like it or read my publication and
[3:28:08.440 --> 3:28:15.480]  so it's very difficult for oil over the next year let's say to drop to 50 dollars a barrel
[3:28:15.480 --> 3:28:21.400]  when the cost of everything else is going up yes we just had a correction in commodities
[3:28:21.400 --> 3:28:26.200]  but we've been saying we've been saying for six months we've been saying for six months on record
[3:28:26.200 --> 3:28:30.840]  because it happens every summer that the price is going to peak at the end of July or mid-July
[3:28:30.840 --> 3:28:36.520]  and then go back down through the fall and winter and then start picking back up in the spring back
[3:28:36.520 --> 3:28:40.920]  into summer and if you watch the graph it goes up a little bit down back up a little bit down
[3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:48.360]  but on a multi-year graph it's going straight up so to say oh see the old companies were right
[3:28:48.360 --> 3:28:54.840]  the price went down about 25 dollars a barrel this is the trick they play where it's a dollar 50
[3:28:54.840 --> 3:28:59.720]  then it goes to two then it drops back down to a dollar 75 then it raises back up to three then it
[3:28:59.720 --> 3:29:05.720]  drops to 250 then to four then to 350 then to 450 then to four I mean this is them simply training
[3:29:05.720 --> 3:29:11.160]  us everybody's saying wow I love four dollar gas it's better than 450 man we got it good
[3:29:12.120 --> 3:29:17.160]  no the gas prices are high we'll be right back with Bob Chapman and your phone call stay with us

[3:32:48.200 --> 3:32:53.080]  that oil prices could drop down to $50 a barrel which would mean i guess
[3:32:53.080 --> 3:33:00.280]  a dollar seventy five two dollars at the pump this is not my opinion at the associated press
[3:33:00.280 --> 3:33:06.840]  in 2001 reported on a big series in a big series and then we went to the university and the
[3:33:06.840 --> 3:33:10.520]  and the groups that have been involved in the research and then the group that had the lawsuit
[3:33:10.520 --> 3:33:15.640]  and got the documents not just the ap article and we've written articles about this the last few years
[3:33:15.640 --> 3:33:25.000]  on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com where the oil companies in 95 and 96 met the top
[3:33:25.000 --> 3:33:30.280]  10 in the u.s. and in london and we have all the documents all the minutes of their meetings and
[3:33:30.280 --> 3:33:35.080]  they said there's too much oil being discovered we want to keep prices up how do we do it and they
[3:33:35.080 --> 3:33:41.960]  said well no matter of wildcatters bring in fields we can't really block natural gas that's hard but
[3:33:41.960 --> 3:33:47.880]  but that's why that's been booming in the u.s. and keeping the economy afloat many areas like
[3:33:47.880 --> 3:33:53.400]  texas but they said what we can do is buy up these refineries and in the next five years
[3:33:53.960 --> 3:34:00.280]  they bought up over 200 refineries and closed them now marathon and a few others have tried
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:04.440]  to go buy those old things get through the regulatory red tape they're trying to retrofit
[3:34:04.440 --> 3:34:10.760]  them and fix them up these are small refineries so they could find an ocean of oil tomorrow
[3:34:10.760 --> 3:34:16.840]  so how are they going to bring it in when we're four or five years even if they started on
[3:34:17.480 --> 3:34:21.720]  a hundred new refineries in the u.s. and we're bringing imported gas in as well let's say hundreds
[3:34:21.720 --> 3:34:27.720]  overseas it's just infrastructure wise because i know a lot not a lot but quite a bit more than
[3:34:27.720 --> 3:34:34.040]  most people about the oil industry because family and being here in texas that what bob we're talking
[3:34:34.040 --> 3:34:39.640]  about five years to be able to really bring the market something that could and then that's a
[3:34:39.640 --> 3:34:44.120]  dead reckoning estimation but five years where they did want to give us all the oil they're
[3:34:44.120 --> 3:34:49.960]  blocking up even in alaska in places we're talking for five years or is that wrong oh i think that's
[3:34:49.960 --> 3:34:58.360]  right and uh and let's assume uh in that period of time uh that we have a severe recession uh
[3:34:58.360 --> 3:35:05.800]  when the depression arrives if in fact it does uh then you're going to have less usage and so one
[3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:13.720]  could meet the other in the middle so to speak and yes then um the production of oil and gas
[3:35:14.440 --> 3:35:22.520]  versus usage would would uh increase bringing the price down i mean goodness it during the
[3:35:22.520 --> 3:35:27.880]  depression it could go back to 11 to 12 dollars as well i mean you know there's there's nothing
[3:35:27.880 --> 3:35:36.040]  sacred as sacrosanth in any market and uh and and yes uh i think that major oil companies would
[3:35:36.040 --> 3:35:41.320]  want prices higher but they don't always get what they desire they're making record profits now i'm
[3:35:41.320 --> 3:35:46.760]  sure you've seen them well i'm getting people emailing me thinking oh aren't oil prices low
[3:35:46.760 --> 3:35:54.120]  now as if a national average of 390 many areas of california 450 some areas even higher uh this
[3:35:54.120 --> 3:35:59.240]  is the pavlovian way they train us remember folks a few years ago when two bucks was outrageous and
[3:35:59.240 --> 3:36:05.640]  then three bucks and then uh i mean this is so childlike uh that people now think that oil prices
[3:36:05.640 --> 3:36:15.560]  are low well you know that's that uh propaganda and then the release factor uh you know being able
[3:36:15.560 --> 3:36:22.440]  to accept something that you don't want to accept it just like you know people who are taken kidnapped
[3:36:22.440 --> 3:36:31.000]  by say bank robbers you know you cooperate to keep your life and you sometimes adapt the thinking
[3:36:31.000 --> 3:36:37.320]  of the people who have imprisoned you so to speak now patty hearth is a good example of that
[3:36:37.320 --> 3:36:42.840]  you don't hear much about it anymore but uh uh you know that's what she's to come to and it's
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:49.640]  normal yeah she started robbing banks with them that's right and of course being very wealthy
[3:36:49.640 --> 3:36:57.960]  it was easy for her to um have that obscured a few may very good point and and i think that's what
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:37:03.800]  the globalist use psychology they sold us torture they sold us preemptive war wars of aggression
[3:37:03.800 --> 3:37:09.320]  corruption surveillance and the public has that syndrome i forget the exact name where you go
[3:37:09.320 --> 3:37:16.440]  ahead and start defending your abusers is is is basically what it is yes and and that's not abnormal
[3:37:16.440 --> 3:37:22.600]  i mean most people don't want to die i mean when you're at my age you really don't care because
[3:37:22.600 --> 3:37:28.920]  he you know you think you're fortunate you live this long but anyway well i've studied i've studied
[3:37:28.920 --> 3:37:33.560]  enough history bob as you have to know that i've got a much better chance of my family and myself
[3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:38.600]  coming through it if i'm bold if i fight back and that being weak and living in denial invites
[3:37:38.600 --> 3:37:43.320]  enslavement and so i hope all these cattle like people out there who love the system i hope they
[3:37:43.320 --> 3:37:48.120]  realize they're inviting doom by rolling over on their back and presenting their belly to the
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:53.640]  wolf do you agree with that absolutely absolutely if you're going to go down you better go down
[3:37:53.640 --> 3:37:57.160]  fighting all right i want to spend just two or three minutes i want to take calls for the rest
[3:37:57.160 --> 3:38:00.840]  of the hour and we appreciate bob chap in the international forecaster dot com joining us get
[3:38:00.840 --> 3:38:04.840]  a free subscription trial subscription at the international forecaster dot com and valuable
[3:38:04.840 --> 3:38:12.360]  information uh bob before we go to the calls just three or four minutes the basic economic
[3:38:12.360 --> 3:38:18.840]  outlook what's currently happening right now well we have been shown particularly through
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:26.360]  the discount window and the auctions by the fed that if anything the credit crisis is worse now
[3:38:26.360 --> 3:38:31.080]  than it was a year ago and i'm sure wall street will tell you that's incorrect and i'll have all
[3:38:31.080 --> 3:38:37.240]  kinds of reasons to tell you that but the bottom line is they're increasing money in credit by
[3:38:37.240 --> 3:38:43.800]  about 17 percent and at the same time the banks are still having a terrible problem staying solvent
[3:38:43.800 --> 3:38:48.680]  and there's some 500 billion dollars a month that's being given to banks which just keeps
[3:38:48.680 --> 3:38:56.040]  on being an auctioned and and lent and rolled it at two and a quarter and 2.35 percent and it's
[3:38:56.040 --> 3:39:01.960]  keeping the system going but you can't do it indefinitely and that's where we're at this week
[3:39:01.960 --> 3:39:08.280]  as far as the credit situation is concerned uh the commercial paper market uh where businesses
[3:39:08.280 --> 3:39:14.520]  go and they put up collateral and they borrow money for short periods of time uh 30 60 90 days
[3:39:14.520 --> 3:39:21.640]  maybe six months for production things or research or whatever they're doing and that money is getting
[3:39:22.360 --> 3:39:29.000]  more and more and more difficult to get and it's been that way for about a year and so that's
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:34.680]  another negative toward and that kills economy business financial such a yes it does kill the
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:40.760]  economy because the government also was taking in more money borrowing more money and it's crowding
[3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:49.160]  out business borrowers i mean the bank calls up and says xyz instruments uh you had a five
[3:39:49.160 --> 3:39:54.760]  million dollar line of credit now it's a million uh why while we hate to tell you this but we just
[3:39:54.760 --> 3:40:00.680]  had to buy some more treasuries in order to keep the government solving i mean that's hypothetical
[3:40:00.680 --> 3:40:07.640]  but the point is yes you're right alex it impedes business and development and for those that don't
[3:40:07.640 --> 3:40:13.480]  know in this globalist economy margins of profit are so small in in in so many industries and so
[3:40:13.480 --> 3:40:20.440]  many manufacturing uh sectors that they'll need to borrow 10 20 30 40 50 million dollars to do
[3:40:20.440 --> 3:40:25.640]  their run of a product just so they can sell it into the market and then pay off the debt in that
[3:40:25.640 --> 3:40:30.600]  six month period and then make their profit and then now they can't even get it even though they
[3:40:30.600 --> 3:40:38.520]  are solvent companies uh that are you know based on the short term on a debt model and so again
[3:40:38.520 --> 3:40:45.400]  that's fouling up the system it's feeding on itself it's feeding on itself and there's no way to stop
[3:40:45.400 --> 3:40:52.360]  it i mean they they unleashed a monster and they can't put them back in the cage and the monster
[3:40:52.360 --> 3:40:59.800]  is going to continue to chase them or bite at them or whatever it does and sooner or later it's
[3:40:59.800 --> 3:41:04.600]  going to get them and it's going to get us too we're going to have to pay even though we didn't
[3:41:04.600 --> 3:41:08.040]  do anything wrong and they did but that doesn't make any difference that's just the way it is
[3:41:08.040 --> 3:41:13.240]  there was another article in bloomberg also an ap today about how record amounts last month record
[3:41:13.240 --> 3:41:19.560]  for all-time history even in the previous months of banks going to the discount cash window and
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:23.800]  quote getting free money from the fed that they have to quote you know pay interest back on but
[3:41:23.800 --> 3:41:30.120]  that's our money that's more liquidity currency being put out devaluing the currency so you say
[3:41:30.120 --> 3:41:34.520]  feeding on ourselves it's like we're starving to death on a boat out the middle of the Atlantic
[3:41:34.520 --> 3:41:40.360]  Ocean so we're chopping our toes off and then our feet off and barbecuing them but we can't we can't
[3:41:40.360 --> 3:41:47.080]  sustain ourselves that long eating ourselves perfect example we're devouring the host
[3:41:50.280 --> 3:41:54.040]  so this is akin to someone starving to death when the body starts eating its own muscles
[3:41:54.680 --> 3:41:58.760]  that's right which your body really does start eating itself without you cutting your toes off
[3:41:58.760 --> 3:42:04.520]  and eating them your body does that uh my god i mean if this was a country that was 240 pounds
[3:42:04.520 --> 3:42:10.680]  solid muscle totally you know huge bull neck uh the you know the best economy in the world say 100
[3:42:10.680 --> 3:42:17.000]  years ago are we emaciated down to what 95 pounds and and then how skinny will we get
[3:42:19.080 --> 3:42:26.440]  um hope probably were that were withered down to 40 or 50 pounds but during that process
[3:42:27.240 --> 3:42:32.840]  we it's going to be extraordinarily different difficult to counter punch i mean you're getting
[3:42:32.840 --> 3:42:37.720]  weaker and weaker and it's not only us it's the whole world i mean just take a look at europe this
[3:42:37.720 --> 3:42:46.600]  week i mean they're ready to declare we are in a serious recession and they are i mean we haven't
[3:42:46.600 --> 3:42:53.160]  seen anything yet i mean america started in recession a year and a half ago and i'm starting
[3:42:53.160 --> 3:42:59.480]  to see figures i'm starting to see economists say well gee it could have started in the last quarter
[3:42:59.480 --> 3:43:07.320]  of 2006 well thank you very much where have you been another thing too is that i think finally
[3:43:08.040 --> 3:43:11.800]  the mainline economists even though they're hired by the banks and the brokerage houses
[3:43:11.800 --> 3:43:17.320]  and the government are finally saying look these figures coming out of washington
[3:43:17.320 --> 3:43:22.760]  are totally bogus and we can't use them anymore look at the monster it's created
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:30.120]  and so all of these things are are starting to confluence and as we go on and and the exposure
[3:43:30.120 --> 3:43:37.160]  comes then the next step is deeper recession and that means we get a print more money and then
[3:43:37.160 --> 3:43:44.120]  there's more hyperinflation until some point where the borrowers won't borrow anymore when you see that
[3:43:44.120 --> 3:43:52.280]  you know you are about to enter deflation that will be the key then you go into that death spiral
[3:43:52.280 --> 3:43:58.440]  and we go into it's going to be tough and we go into foreign companies and even countries coming in
[3:43:59.080 --> 3:44:02.760]  who don't have the devalued currency they're going into recessions and depression but they
[3:44:02.760 --> 3:44:06.840]  still have a strong currency they're coming in with all the dollars they've bought in the past
[3:44:07.400 --> 3:44:11.800]  and they are buying up the infrastructure the water districts everything here's the wall street
[3:44:11.800 --> 3:44:18.280]  journal where we're fighting the foreigners off in about half the time from grabbing roads that
[3:44:18.280 --> 3:44:23.080]  are worth a hundred billion dollars over 50 years and they're getting them for a half billion a
[3:44:23.080 --> 3:44:30.360]  billion for 75 so literal pennies on the dollar roads we've already paid for the state transportation
[3:44:30.360 --> 3:44:34.040]  boards won't fix them they're spending the money on cameras and emergency centers and
[3:44:34.040 --> 3:44:39.880]  martial law war wags and the rest of it literally big armored vehicles and then we have this
[3:44:39.880 --> 3:44:45.000]  bush calls for new highway tolls more private funding of roads and he just basically declared
[3:44:45.000 --> 3:44:48.840]  the states are stopping this i'm going to use the federal funds to demand
[3:44:48.840 --> 3:44:53.800]  that the infrastructure be handed over to private interest so i mean you talk about cannibalism
[3:44:53.800 --> 3:45:01.480]  this is amazing bob and it's a fact you know you just read from your mind exactly what the
[3:45:01.480 --> 3:45:08.760]  governor of new york state said and that is not the answer the answer is maybe what schrottzenegger
[3:45:08.760 --> 3:45:17.320]  is doing say look we're laying off 200 000 or is it 20 000 and everybody uh no this 20 000 and i
[3:45:17.320 --> 3:45:25.400]  have to uh uh be laid off and uh 200 000 i have to have their salaries cut the minimum wage uh at
[3:45:25.400 --> 3:45:31.560]  the same time the legislature in california is arguing about uh which way they're going to go
[3:45:31.560 --> 3:45:37.880]  on trying to solve this 15 billion dollar i'm in the whole dilemma well when this implodes what are
[3:45:37.880 --> 3:45:42.840]  all the new three million cops from 500 000 a decade ago what are they going to do when there's
[3:45:42.840 --> 3:45:46.440]  when you when they can't pull people over and give them tickets anymore to raise money because the
[3:45:46.440 --> 3:45:51.880]  people have no more money what are they going to do when all this is going bankrupt i don't know
[3:45:53.080 --> 3:45:58.520]  i don't know what they can do and if they start being aggressive well the people will get aggressive
[3:45:59.480 --> 3:46:04.680]  and um i i certainly wouldn't want to be in law enforcement at that time because it's going to be
[3:46:04.680 --> 3:46:13.320]  very difficult okay let's take some calls folks uh let's go ahead and get my call list up here on
[3:46:13.320 --> 3:46:17.880]  the computer in front of me let's go to betsy ingrid judith catherine and zack i'm going to get to
[3:46:17.880 --> 3:46:23.400]  all of you but let's move quick betsy in texas you're on the air with bob Chapman hi alex um
[3:46:23.400 --> 3:46:31.080]  i've been listening to you since february 2002 and it just keeps getting more and more you know
[3:46:31.080 --> 3:46:40.120]  exxon 11 billion dollar profits bp 13 billion i mean we we have an energy scare but then we

[3:46:48.520 --> 3:46:53.000]  remember though those profits for exxon and bp are uh that's in dollar figures so the profits
[3:46:53.000 --> 3:46:56.600]  really aren't that big i'm not saying that the old companies aren't crooked they're as crooked as it
[3:46:56.600 --> 3:47:04.840]  gets but they are bob you want to explain that relationship well it's very very convoluted
[3:47:04.840 --> 3:47:13.720]  convoluted uh but the oil companies are among the richest entities in the world and they have been
[3:47:13.720 --> 3:47:19.800]  allowed to do exactly what they want to do and you know they got all these profits coming in
[3:47:19.800 --> 3:47:25.160]  and that's nice for them but you know you've got millions of people in the world starving because
[3:47:25.160 --> 3:47:32.680]  they won't refine more gasoline to bring the price down anything else uh i'm betsey uh you

[3:48:15.960 --> 3:48:22.440]  and no one has more courage than you and goddess on your side and i like to tell you what happened to
[3:48:22.440 --> 3:48:28.680]  my friend and me exactly one week ago today we got pulled over by the cops and we have a um
[3:48:29.480 --> 3:48:35.080]  we have a sticker on the car info wars dot com and two sticker two round ball stickers and when they
[3:48:35.080 --> 3:48:40.680]  when they got done with us he said do you know why we did this and they pointed to the stickers
[3:48:40.680 --> 3:48:47.240]  they um treated us like criminals ordered us out of the car and facing the police car then they
[3:48:47.240 --> 3:48:51.640]  searched the car they searched my purse threw everything out of my purse didn't put it back
[3:48:51.640 --> 3:48:58.520]  in questioned us beyond belief and uh it was horrible well for those that don't know all over
[3:48:58.520 --> 3:49:03.800]  the western world the police have been told to harass patriots to engage in secret police
[3:49:03.800 --> 3:49:09.480]  activities uh did you tell them shame on you i mean or i guess they were proud that they saw
[3:49:09.480 --> 3:49:15.000]  someone who loved america as a threat oh my god they like ron paul oh my god they're evil i know
[3:49:15.560 --> 3:49:20.920]  we didn't do anything no they never asked for insurance registration every cop asked us that
[3:49:20.920 --> 3:49:27.400]  before and then they um never gave us a ticket they were just letting you know that it was a
[3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:34.120]  commissariat political stop uh i mean one cop said do you know why we did this and he pointed to
[3:49:34.120 --> 3:49:40.280]  the stickers god almighty it's it's bad i mean what's wrong with these cops bob thinking that people
[3:49:40.280 --> 3:49:44.760]  that defend america and we've been right about everything that we're the bad ones well what
[3:49:44.760 --> 3:49:51.480]  did what do they think well i think that uh they probably get uh a lot of uh disinformation from
[3:49:51.480 --> 3:49:56.520]  government and uh they do what they're told because they have to or they lose their jobs
[3:49:56.520 --> 3:50:04.280]  and i think uh it puts them in a state of mind where anybody who challenges the system and
[3:50:04.840 --> 3:50:13.160]  which they've chosen to operate in is outside of what they are or evil or whatever and uh so
[3:50:13.160 --> 3:50:19.240]  these two ladies in the car were evil because they thought ron paul was a good choice and
[3:50:19.880 --> 3:50:23.720]  so they harassed them tell what ingrid stay there we're gonna skip this break for all the

[3:55:53.320 --> 3:55:57.480]  and looking to the government to fix these problems the thing is they're not going to fix them for
