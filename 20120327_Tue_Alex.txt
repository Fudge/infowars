[00:00.000 --> 00:10.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.280 --> 00:11.280]  You want answers?
[00:11.280 --> 00:13.160]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.160 --> 00:17.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.640 --> 00:36.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:36.880 --> 00:43.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have got an incredible transmission lined up for you today.
[00:43.800 --> 00:50.240]  And we are going to be here for the next three hours that I shall be back this evening,
[00:50.240 --> 00:58.480]  7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern, 5 o'clock Pacific, 6 o'clock Mountain PM with Info Wars
[00:58.480 --> 00:59.480]  Nightly News.
[00:59.480 --> 01:05.600]  Well, I have finally had a chance to see Hunger Games, and I am going to give you a big spoiler
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.800]  alert here coming up in the last 15 minutes or so of the next hour.
[01:10.800 --> 01:21.320]  I'm going to give you my review of the film, and it is 100% Agenda 21 and is our actual
[01:21.320 --> 01:23.080]  future.
[01:23.080 --> 01:28.200]  This is what they call predictive programming, where they put in science fiction what they're
[01:28.200 --> 01:29.800]  planning to establish.
[01:29.800 --> 01:36.920]  A collapsed society by design, 10 regions per country, this has 12, a dictatorship running
[01:36.920 --> 01:43.720]  at this depopulated people, monorail connecting mega cities with most people forced to live
[01:43.720 --> 01:48.720]  in the city, small groups living in the countryside who are under feudalism and who are killed
[01:48.720 --> 01:52.400]  if they're caught hunting and trying to feed themselves.
[01:52.400 --> 01:58.640]  The men are effeminate and pranced around going, ah, ah, ah, ah, trendy.
[01:58.640 --> 02:02.680]  And you've got the enforcer military, though, who's dominating everybody.
[02:02.680 --> 02:09.520]  So again, it's fashionable for men to submit to tyranny, giggle at liberty, except for
[02:09.520 --> 02:10.520]  the enforcers.
[02:10.520 --> 02:15.480]  And so that's all part of having resistance spread out of you, and they have gladiatorial
[02:15.480 --> 02:21.000]  events to play the regions off against each other in worship of the centralized government.
[02:21.000 --> 02:27.960]  See, I already started giving you a review right there, but that's the future.
[02:27.960 --> 02:31.320]  When you see films like Demolition Man, I don't know, they came out like 15 years ago
[02:31.320 --> 02:36.040]  or more, and everything is this nanny state dictatorship.
[02:36.040 --> 02:39.760]  That's actually what they're planning.
[02:39.760 --> 02:51.040]  And so this whole program that they're setting up, this whole operation that's being developed
[02:51.040 --> 02:52.040]  is just so over the top.
[02:52.040 --> 02:54.600]  I don't even know how we're going to be able to deal with it.
[02:54.600 --> 03:01.200]  Now, that said, we've got a lot of really important news that we're going to be covering,
[03:01.200 --> 03:03.200]  obviously, after the break.
[03:03.200 --> 03:11.280]  The whole Trayvon Martin case, because it's an example of media manipulation, is important
[03:11.280 --> 03:12.280]  to cover.
[03:12.280 --> 03:13.280]  I'm going to be breaking that down.
[03:13.280 --> 03:18.360]  In fact, just when we come back from break, then we've got the really bad news that the
[03:18.360 --> 03:29.360]  media is preparing everyone for the Supreme Court to rule that socialist health care is
[03:29.360 --> 03:45.120]  the law of the land, and the White House is also arguing in these meetings with the Supreme
[03:45.120 --> 03:54.040]  Court that, yes, it could be selectively enforced as well, which that itself is just off the
[03:54.040 --> 03:56.040]  chart unconstitutional.
[03:56.040 --> 04:00.400]  That, oh, the government can make one group do something, but not the other.
[04:00.400 --> 04:06.120]  That's called incredible unfair weights and measures, incredible discrimination, class
[04:06.120 --> 04:09.280]  system, but that's the whole point of big government.
[04:09.280 --> 04:12.640]  It's there to shut down the competition of the globalist.
[04:12.640 --> 04:13.760]  And so we're going to be going over that.
[04:13.760 --> 04:15.480]  And Ron Paul has been right in the past.
[04:15.480 --> 04:20.840]  He says the word is the Supreme Court is going to rule that government run health care is
[04:20.840 --> 04:21.840]  the model.
[04:21.840 --> 04:27.080]  We're going to be covering that after the break as well and Obama requests 770 million
[04:27.080 --> 04:30.160]  to fight global warming overseas.
[04:30.160 --> 04:32.880]  That means take people's property.
[04:32.880 --> 04:36.120]  We're going to be going over all of that today.
[04:36.120 --> 04:42.160]  Also, kids all over America are being sent on buses without their parents consent or
[04:42.160 --> 04:45.800]  knowledge to FEMA camps with police with machine guns.
[04:45.800 --> 04:47.120]  The kids drive behind barbed wire.
[04:47.120 --> 04:51.720]  It's all training them to go to the prisoner centers, and that's what it is on record.
[04:51.720 --> 04:53.560]  So that's expanding as the state trains you.
[04:53.560 --> 04:57.120]  Hey, your kids belong to us and our hands are going down their pants at the pedophile
[04:57.120 --> 05:00.120]  training TSA and there's news on the TSA as well.
[05:00.120 --> 05:02.080]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[05:02.080 --> 05:06.040]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[05:06.040 --> 05:07.640]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[05:07.640 --> 05:11.720]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[05:11.720 --> 05:12.720]  or gold?
[05:12.720 --> 05:13.720]  It's true.
[05:13.720 --> 05:16.640]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible
[05:16.640 --> 05:18.240]  that could even happen again.
[05:18.240 --> 05:22.680]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[05:22.680 --> 05:23.680]  seeds.
[05:23.680 --> 05:28.720]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[05:28.720 --> 05:30.600]  food for you and your family.
[05:30.600 --> 05:31.720]  And here's the best part.
[05:31.720 --> 05:35.920]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[05:35.920 --> 05:38.400]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[05:38.400 --> 05:41.640]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[05:41.640 --> 05:48.480]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[05:48.480 --> 05:52.600]  That's 877-327-0365.
[05:52.600 --> 05:57.480]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[05:57.480 --> 06:01.440]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[06:01.440 --> 06:05.600]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[06:05.600 --> 06:08.640]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions.
[06:08.640 --> 06:12.160]  But many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been
[06:12.160 --> 06:16.840]  designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[06:16.840 --> 06:21.600]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[06:21.600 --> 06:26.200]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[06:26.200 --> 06:30.840]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[06:30.840 --> 06:34.360]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[06:34.360 --> 06:41.160]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive
[06:41.160 --> 06:42.160]  system.
[06:42.160 --> 06:49.520]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com
[06:49.520 --> 06:52.640]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[06:59.640 --> 07:05.920]  Folks, Iran and the Middle East nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[08:24.120 --> 08:33.360]  On the 27th day of March, 2012, we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[08:33.360 --> 08:39.820]  We've got former top state department psychological warfare chief who wrote the book on overthrowing
[08:39.820 --> 08:44.200]  governments and psychological warfare and of course he literally wrote the book co-authored
[08:44.200 --> 08:46.800]  a bunch of the books with Tom Clancy.
[08:46.800 --> 08:51.160]  We're going to have Dr. Steve Pacinic on, hadn't been on in four or five months.
[08:51.160 --> 08:54.240]  Turns out I wasn't going through all my voicemail properly.
[08:54.240 --> 09:04.560]  He called me weeks ago wanting to come on about the Stratford emails that I'm in where Stratford
[09:04.560 --> 09:09.360]  here in Austin, a private intelligence group, really with connections to the CIA, they just
[09:09.360 --> 09:11.440]  released stuff that the CIA can't publicly do.
[09:11.440 --> 09:16.960]  They let Stratford leak it, attacking me and saying, you know, that they've got to release
[09:16.960 --> 09:22.640]  bin Laden photos because, you know, I'm out there convincing the public that it was staged.
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.400]  And of course, you know, Pacinic nine years ago said that he died of kidney failure and
[09:26.400 --> 09:31.040]  that they would stage his discovery at one point.
[09:31.040 --> 09:34.440]  And he certainly is a good source of info for us on that front.
[09:34.440 --> 09:40.280]  He's saying he talked to high level intelligence people that it created a giant stir in the
[09:40.280 --> 09:46.200]  intelligence community over the fact that everybody knew that it was fake and was really
[09:46.200 --> 09:48.400]  creating an internal war.
[09:48.400 --> 09:54.880]  And he says Stratford is important and that they basically are a mouthpiece of the CIA.
[09:54.880 --> 09:57.600]  So we'll be, we'll be breaking that down.
[09:57.600 --> 10:02.440]  And I want to be clear over the years, I've called Stratford many times Dr. Friedman and
[10:02.440 --> 10:03.440]  asked him to come on the show.
[10:03.440 --> 10:05.720]  They'll never return our calls.
[10:05.720 --> 10:08.040]  Last week we sent a camera crew down there.
[10:08.040 --> 10:13.040]  We're going to do a nightly news piece on that soon to demand that they talk to us and
[10:13.040 --> 10:15.600]  they brushed us off of the security guard did.
[10:15.600 --> 10:19.560]  So we're going to keep working on that report and show the fact that they are talking trash
[10:19.560 --> 10:25.640]  about me behind the scenes, but not then willing to belly up to the bar and actually face me
[10:25.640 --> 10:26.640]  here on air.
[10:26.640 --> 10:32.440]  And I don't want to make it about Alex Jones, but it just shows that, that the system is
[10:32.440 --> 10:37.760]  scared of this some have been lied in story because it's as phony as a $3 bill.
[10:37.760 --> 10:47.720]  So Pachinic thinks that there's some skull duggery going on with this Sergeant Bales
[10:47.720 --> 10:52.280]  and the whole massacre there in Afghanistan.
[10:52.280 --> 10:57.440]  So we'll get his take on that for about 35, 40 minutes in the second hour.
[10:57.440 --> 11:03.840]  And then I'm going to give you my review of the Hunger Games that is a Jenna 21.
[11:03.840 --> 11:09.840]  It's actually what the UN in the 1996 biological diversity assessment that I cover in my film
[11:09.840 --> 11:11.160]  road to tyranny.
[11:11.160 --> 11:14.520]  They actually describe that movie.
[11:14.520 --> 11:18.880]  I mean that is exactly what they want to do and I'm going to try to get the author on
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.480]  because she's either a listener of this show or research is the new world order.
[11:23.480 --> 11:27.440]  The first book came out four years ago in 2008, it's a trilogy.
[11:27.440 --> 11:28.440]  I haven't read the books.
[11:28.440 --> 11:34.960]  A lot of the offices or she's working for the globalist and it's some kind of conditioning
[11:34.960 --> 11:38.000]  thing, but it's anti authoritarian.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.080]  But the system would say, well, that just conditions people, even if it's anti a Jenna
[11:42.080 --> 11:45.920]  21, it still just acclimates people to this idea.
[11:45.920 --> 11:48.360]  I have to say it's anti a Jenna 21.
[11:48.360 --> 11:50.560]  I mean, I guess Hollywood thinks everybody's so dumb.
[11:50.560 --> 11:52.080]  Okay, it's a popular book.
[11:52.080 --> 11:53.320]  We'll make a bunch of money.
[11:53.320 --> 11:59.520]  So what if it's an anti neo feudalist movie?
[11:59.520 --> 12:05.960]  I mean, it's America collapses basically under carbon taxes a hundred years later.
[12:05.960 --> 12:13.400]  They're having a 70th something gladiatorial diversion that's meant to play the different
[12:13.400 --> 12:15.040]  12 regions off against each other.
[12:15.040 --> 12:21.480]  The centralized government jumbo tron telescreens like like everything is put back to loincloth
[12:21.480 --> 12:31.200]  you know, frozen agrarian society feudalism, you're executed if you're caught trying to
[12:31.200 --> 12:35.280]  raise more food or, you know, catch a rabbit to eat it.
[12:35.280 --> 12:38.760]  But then the government itself has all this high tech system they use to control.
[12:38.760 --> 12:42.560]  That is exactly what the new world order is planning.
[12:42.560 --> 12:48.760]  That is exactly what they state in a Jenna 21 UN biological diversity assessment 96 Club
[12:48.760 --> 12:49.760]  of Rome.
[12:49.760 --> 13:01.640]  The movie is exactly Tim Hardy reviewing it is exactly what they want to set up where
[13:01.640 --> 13:03.880]  almost everybody's depopulated.
[13:03.880 --> 13:08.280]  There's a few mega cities, you know, one per region or so with small agrarian societies
[13:08.280 --> 13:14.960]  heavily oppressed and 99% of the land locked off for the elites and the elites are all
[13:14.960 --> 13:22.360]  foppish and feminine, metrosexual, jibbering, I mean, that is exactly the plan.
[13:22.360 --> 13:25.560]  How many of you have heard me talk about this, a lot of you out there that are radio listeners
[13:25.560 --> 13:29.320]  don't have the time or energy to go look up all the documents we post to watch in game,
[13:29.320 --> 13:33.600]  to watch road to tyranny to, you know, look at the research we've done to find out.
[13:33.600 --> 13:39.160]  I didn't just imagine the hunger games as our future without ever reading the book 10
[13:39.160 --> 13:41.920]  years ago before the books were out.
[13:41.920 --> 13:46.160]  And the lady that wrote this book didn't either.
[13:46.160 --> 13:50.080]  What's in these books is what they're planning.
[13:50.080 --> 13:52.120]  I got to get Alan Wadd on about this.
[13:52.120 --> 13:57.800]  You know, he's always talking about predictive programming and that is what it is.
[13:57.800 --> 14:01.480]  You know, you notice them like Star Trek, it's the UN symbol and it's all about global
[14:01.480 --> 14:06.480]  government back on earth and Roddenberry admitted he wants global government before
[14:06.480 --> 14:08.360]  he died and said this was programming.
[14:08.360 --> 14:09.360]  Of course it is.
[14:09.360 --> 14:12.760]  You got the Attorney General saying, put anti-gun messages in TV.
[14:12.760 --> 14:14.120]  We want to brainwash the public.
[14:14.120 --> 14:16.560]  Well, they have all these anti-family messages.
[14:16.560 --> 14:21.120]  When you're watching TV and see a message and suspend this belief and the women are
[14:21.120 --> 14:27.280]  always the boss and the men are bad and everybody's fighting with each other and racial tension.
[14:27.280 --> 14:30.360]  That's there for a reason.
[14:30.360 --> 14:39.040]  That's programming and I know you know it, but do you really know it?
[14:39.040 --> 14:44.360]  Whether they have their way, folks, the Hunger Games is our future.
[14:44.360 --> 14:48.560]  That's why they're getting this ready with gladiatorial war, all these sports that are
[14:48.560 --> 14:50.360]  getting more and more violent.
[14:50.360 --> 14:55.160]  The UN says, and I've got to dig this out, in the UN biological diversity assessment
[14:55.160 --> 14:58.240]  of 96, the one on their online side has been watered down.
[14:58.240 --> 14:59.240]  It's a synopsis.
[14:59.240 --> 15:00.720]  I had to go to the library to get the full one.
[15:00.720 --> 15:01.720]  It's somewhere around here.
[15:01.720 --> 15:03.960]  I show it again at Roddenberry that I produced 10 years ago.
[15:03.960 --> 15:05.920]  I show copies of it, underlined.
[15:05.920 --> 15:09.960]  It said, we'll have regional governments, everybody crammed in cities, small agrarian
[15:09.960 --> 15:10.960]  groups.
[15:10.960 --> 15:16.600]  The regions will have combat games, gladiatorial diversions, gladiatorial events to give them
[15:16.600 --> 15:20.040]  a sense of regionalism instead of nationalism.
[15:20.040 --> 15:24.080]  So they get rid of the major countries and have them in a global conglomerate.
[15:24.080 --> 15:29.320]  But then you still have tribalism, but you make that subregions within the super states,
[15:29.320 --> 15:30.800]  which is the North American Union SPP.
[15:30.800 --> 15:33.600]  See, I'm already getting into it.
[15:33.600 --> 15:34.600]  Whoa.
[15:34.600 --> 15:36.160]  I mean, it's happening.
[15:36.160 --> 15:39.280]  And they talk about human sacrifice, how they're going to promote that, how they're
[15:39.280 --> 15:45.120]  going to have people in agrarian, post-industrial society, with these high-tech reservations
[15:45.120 --> 15:54.560]  in the armored cities, with specialized, militarized computer systems, combat robots, drones, very
[15:54.560 --> 16:00.040]  small groups of militarized men to enforce very small.
[16:00.040 --> 16:08.120]  And the rest of the men, literally given hormones, walking around like, I mean, this is the system.
[16:08.120 --> 16:14.640]  Men jumping around in pink outfits, foppishly, with their wrist like, well, murdering everybody.
[16:14.640 --> 16:16.480]  I mean, that's what they do.
[16:16.480 --> 16:17.480]  There it is.
[16:17.480 --> 16:21.560]  United Nations Systems Worldwide Earthwatch, biodiversity assessment.
[16:21.560 --> 16:23.280]  That's the 1995 one.
[16:23.280 --> 16:26.120]  Well, there's the Haywood 96.
[16:26.120 --> 16:30.240]  Click on that one and see if it's the right one and type in human sacrifice.
[16:30.240 --> 16:36.000]  See the second blue link down there?
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.360]  That the full document is just a synopsis.
[16:39.360 --> 16:40.360]  Search this.
[16:40.360 --> 16:46.960]  You in biological diversity assessment, 1996, human sacrifice.
[16:46.960 --> 16:54.120]  I mean, you cannot make up the hardcore nature of this.
[16:54.120 --> 16:55.920]  I'm living in a twilight zone movie.
[16:55.920 --> 16:58.320]  You know, I see and hear these people constantly moan.
[16:58.320 --> 17:02.000]  I hear it in rock music, rap music, country music.
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.320]  I listen to everything.
[17:05.320 --> 17:12.040]  And all they do is whine about how life's not worth living and it's so boring.
[17:12.040 --> 17:15.440]  And that is pure Madison Avenue baloney.
[17:15.440 --> 17:19.760]  I walked outside last night and watched that crescent moon with Jupiter and Saturn lined
[17:19.760 --> 17:27.520]  up like something out of 2001 space Odyssey.
[17:27.520 --> 17:29.960]  It's springtime.
[17:29.960 --> 17:38.120]  Just beautiful flowers everywhere, birds singing, crisp air outside, electrifying information
[17:38.120 --> 17:44.280]  in incredible developments, horrific things happening, exhilarating things happening.
[17:44.280 --> 17:45.440]  Hundreds of reports coming out.
[17:45.440 --> 17:49.000]  They've not just stopped aging in mice and rats.
[17:49.000 --> 17:50.640]  They've reversed it.
[17:50.640 --> 17:54.280]  Fountain of youth confirmed for decades now being released.
[17:54.280 --> 17:59.480]  Just totally crazy, CIA announcing everyone's house being watched through all the major
[17:59.480 --> 18:04.480]  appliances.
[18:04.480 --> 18:11.520]  I mean, the world is just incredibly active and incredibly alive and so much is happening.
[18:11.520 --> 18:14.960]  And there's people walking around talking about how it's boring.
[18:14.960 --> 18:18.280]  I mean, you're only alive and conscious one time.
[18:18.280 --> 18:20.520]  You say, oh, I'd love to go to Mars.
[18:20.520 --> 18:22.560]  Oh, I'd love to go to foreign planets.
[18:22.560 --> 18:24.440]  I, you know, I'd love to go to space.
[18:24.440 --> 18:25.720]  You're in space.
[18:25.720 --> 18:26.960]  You're in the universe.
[18:26.960 --> 18:33.680]  You're on a gorgeous planet, a very special place with giant oceans filled with life and
[18:33.680 --> 18:40.920]  rainforest and fields and caves and the universe all around us and all the life forms and the
[18:40.920 --> 18:46.440]  magic of the human eye and smell and taste and touch.
[18:46.440 --> 18:52.240]  And the fact that we can see a beach and a sunset and know it's beautiful and that our
[18:52.240 --> 18:56.520]  soul communicates and resonates with it.
[18:56.520 --> 18:57.520]  Whoa.
[18:57.520 --> 19:00.560]  I mean, that's incredible.
[19:00.560 --> 19:04.840]  And these people are moping around talking about how life isn't worth living.
[19:04.840 --> 19:09.040]  And then Paul Watson's got an article coming out about all the people dying in Japan from
[19:09.040 --> 19:12.000]  radiation poisoning and they just call it something else.
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.040]  And when people go in with bleeding intestines, bleeding gums, radiation poisoning, they call
[19:17.040 --> 19:19.880]  them mentally ill and give them Prozac.
[19:19.880 --> 19:23.000]  What do they do with the troops for 22 years with DU poisoning?
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  They give them Prozac.
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  So they go home.
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.760]  I mean, we talk about people in wheelchairs who then rot and die and never get medical
[19:28.760 --> 19:33.560]  care from the scumbag VA because DU poisoning doesn't exist.
[19:33.560 --> 19:34.560]  And it's the same thing.
[19:34.560 --> 19:40.200]  I mean, it's just psychopaths who think radiation poisoning and death and war and black uniforms
[19:40.200 --> 19:45.800]  and nothing but women that look like Kagan and Janet Reno stumbling around looking
[19:45.800 --> 19:47.800]  like goblins ruling us.
[19:47.800 --> 19:52.200]  This is the wavelength progression system signature of the elite.
[19:52.200 --> 20:01.480]  Potbellies, weird women ruling us, uh, metrosexual men toggling around, poison death, black pyramids.
[20:01.480 --> 20:02.640]  I had tried everything.
[20:02.640 --> 20:04.960]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[20:04.960 --> 20:08.120]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[20:08.120 --> 20:12.560]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[20:12.560 --> 20:18.280]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[20:18.280 --> 20:19.780]  and be satisfied.
[20:19.780 --> 20:23.760]  Now there are hundreds of great products at infowarstein.com, but I want to point out
[20:23.760 --> 20:31.280]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[20:31.280 --> 20:36.080]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound, when I started taking the
[20:36.080 --> 20:41.560]  Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[20:41.560 --> 20:42.960]  Now that's results.
[20:42.960 --> 20:48.680]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarstein.com and to order just three of
[20:48.680 --> 20:54.120]  their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite

[20:59.680 --> 21:03.280]  Hey there, you've reached Claire, leave me a message.
[21:03.280 --> 21:04.680]  Claire, it's Ann.
[21:04.680 --> 21:07.680]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product we talked about before?
[21:07.680 --> 21:08.680]  The all-natural one.
[21:08.680 --> 21:09.680]  Ambron?
[21:09.680 --> 21:14.400]  Well, I got to tell you this, not only did Ambron stop my hot flashes, but since I started
[21:14.400 --> 21:17.800]  the Ambron program, I have lost so much weight.
[21:17.800 --> 21:20.080]  Seriously, even my belly fat, it's gone.
[21:20.080 --> 21:22.520]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[21:22.520 --> 21:23.520]  I feel great.
[21:23.520 --> 21:24.520]  Give me a call.
[21:24.520 --> 21:27.960]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[21:27.960 --> 21:31.840]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[21:31.840 --> 21:36.800]  Ambron restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off, yes, even
[21:36.800 --> 21:38.280]  that stubborn belly fat.
[21:38.280 --> 21:42.160]  Plus, Ambron eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too, so with your hormones
[21:42.160 --> 21:45.800]  in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.

[22:34.080 --> 22:38.320]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[22:38.320 --> 22:39.320]  to serve as debt.
[22:39.320 --> 22:42.840]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[22:42.840 --> 22:46.120]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[22:46.120 --> 22:47.120]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[22:47.120 --> 22:50.440]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[22:50.440 --> 22:53.640]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[22:53.640 --> 22:55.080]  It's time to understand the system.
[22:55.080 --> 22:57.440]  Call 800-686-2237.
[22:57.440 --> 23:04.440]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water
[23:04.440 --> 23:05.440]  filtration.
[23:05.440 --> 23:10.240]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over six years in serving thousands of satisfied customers,

[23:19.480 --> 23:24.960]  that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cyst and parasites to non-detectable

[23:34.520 --> 23:37.220]  and the Berkey guy will ship your order free of charge.

[24:25.600 --> 24:33.920]  Yes, soon the federal government is going to control every facet of healthcare.
[24:33.920 --> 24:37.400]  It's not just that they're going to make you buy insurance.
[24:37.400 --> 24:39.640]  The insurance companies wrote it.
[24:39.640 --> 24:43.420]  They're owned by the big banks that want to euthanize you before you ever collect your
[24:43.420 --> 24:49.120]  social security, before you ever actually need to use the healthcare and that's why
[24:49.120 --> 24:53.760]  in the healthcare law they do have death panels and they admit they have death panels as Bill
[24:53.760 --> 24:55.360]  Gates and others have said.
[24:55.360 --> 24:57.800]  They don't call them death panels though.
[24:57.800 --> 25:03.880]  It's federal boards that then set up local boards that decide under the socialist system
[25:03.880 --> 25:09.480]  if you get the surgery and it's the same way in Canada, it's the same thing in England,
[25:09.480 --> 25:10.920]  it's the same thing everywhere.
[25:10.920 --> 25:16.920]  They decide and the state euthanizes you.
[25:16.920 --> 25:19.840]  And then once it's social self-care they're going to decide whether you're allowed to
[25:19.840 --> 25:20.840]  have a baby or not.
[25:20.840 --> 25:24.080]  They have to look at your genetics and see if they're aberrant.
[25:24.080 --> 25:26.240]  This is the new system of oppression.
[25:26.240 --> 25:32.120]  But on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers, and yes, go ahead and torture them, go ahead
[25:32.120 --> 25:37.080]  and scroll down, Justice Kagan and Obamacare.
[25:37.080 --> 25:42.640]  She needs to recuse herself immediately.
[25:42.640 --> 25:44.440]  That's the Curtin MO article.
[25:44.440 --> 25:49.200]  Now that Obama's unconstitutional monstrosity, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
[25:49.200 --> 25:53.880]  Act, kind of like the Patriot Act's patriotic, aka Obamacare, has reached the Supreme Court.
[25:53.880 --> 25:58.280]  It is time for Justice Elena Kagan to recuse herself as Solicitor General of the United
[25:58.280 --> 26:03.520]  States Kagan headed up an office that formulated the Obama administration's legal defense
[26:03.520 --> 26:06.240]  of the legislation.
[26:06.240 --> 26:14.440]  She is obliged under Section 455b3 of Title 28 U.S. Code to recuse herself from cases where
[26:14.440 --> 26:21.560]  a justice has served in governmental employment and in such capacity participated as counsel,
[26:21.560 --> 26:26.920]  advisor, or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed opinion concerned
[26:26.920 --> 26:29.960]  the merits of the particular case or controversy.
[26:29.960 --> 26:35.760]  In February, Senator Jeff Sessions cited United States v. Gibson a decision made by the Tent
[26:35.760 --> 26:41.480]  Circuit that held judges who had previously taken part, albeit small, in the investigation,
[26:41.480 --> 26:45.480]  preparation, or prosecution of a case must disqualify themselves.
[26:45.480 --> 26:56.080]  She must recuse herself under law, big L, big A, big W, with a thousand exclamation points
[26:56.080 --> 26:57.080]  behind it.
[26:57.080 --> 26:58.960]  Law, law, law.
[26:58.960 --> 27:00.960]  Put her up there back on screen.
[27:00.960 --> 27:03.200]  And again, I have nothing against women that look like Elena Kagan.
[27:03.200 --> 27:07.720]  I want to know, though, why almost all of them ruling us look like her.
[27:07.720 --> 27:10.080]  Maybe she's not even from this planet.
[27:10.080 --> 27:13.080]  Maybe that's some type of bizarre Android goblin creature.
[27:13.080 --> 27:16.880]  I mean, I don't usually get into looks, but why is it that everybody's trying to take
[27:16.880 --> 27:20.160]  my guns, take my private property, and take my kids?
[27:20.160 --> 27:24.280]  The family court judge, it takes everybody's kids in Austin, looks like her twin, Judge
[27:24.280 --> 27:29.400]  Jean Mir, Janet Reno, Janet Napolitano.
[27:29.400 --> 27:32.020]  Is this a secret government cloning factory?
[27:32.020 --> 27:34.360]  And that's what the clones look like?
[27:34.360 --> 27:42.120]  Seriously, were these like underground, subterranean clones that were created in like a factory,
[27:42.120 --> 27:47.040]  back in attack of the clones, and somebody secretly took delivery of them?
[27:47.040 --> 27:48.520]  Maybe the Nazis were cloning goblins.
[27:48.520 --> 27:50.640]  All right, I'm going to stop there.
[27:50.640 --> 27:57.560]  The point is, she must recuse herself the law.
[27:57.560 --> 28:01.840]  She put out the ridiculous statement saying they could order anything and have socialism.
[28:01.840 --> 28:02.840]  Go read it.
[28:02.840 --> 28:09.960]  She argued for the law in Congress that it was constitutional, in debates with Congress
[28:09.960 --> 28:15.600]  for the executive and then was made the Supreme Court justice, but forget that because we
[28:15.600 --> 28:18.720]  got a White House that says they can launch wars without congressional approval now.
[28:18.720 --> 28:24.800]  We got a White House that says they can secretly arrest us and kill us.
[28:24.800 --> 28:30.120]  Everybody's going to find out laws are there for a reason to restrain these monsters like
[28:30.120 --> 28:31.120]  Elena Kagan.
[28:31.120 --> 28:34.360]  Yes, children, monsters are real.
[28:34.360 --> 28:39.160]  And she's one of them, a disgusting, anti-American piece of trash.
[28:39.160 --> 28:44.240]  She absolutely hates this country and is an authoritarian pig.
[28:44.240 --> 28:48.760]  Capital P, capital I, capital G, with a thousand exclamation points.
[28:48.760 --> 28:55.760]  She is a bag of scruffulous because, you know, they're getting all the conservatives ready.
[28:55.760 --> 29:02.360]  Oh, Alito says you're probably, it's legal, El Scalia, it's in the news.
[29:02.360 --> 29:06.480]  And Ron Paul's got his ear to the ground.
[29:06.480 --> 29:11.560]  Ron Paul has got his ear right to the ground and he said on this show years ago he thought
[29:11.560 --> 29:14.520]  the Congress would pass it when they said it wouldn't and he was right there and he
[29:14.520 --> 29:18.400]  says the word is they're going to pass it and they've got all the conservative groups
[29:18.400 --> 29:21.280]  saying brace and get ready for it.
[29:21.280 --> 29:30.000]  And that, that demonic slug, I mean, whoa, the Supreme Court is a joke now, okay?
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  It's not a real court.
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.040]  It's run by a bunch of criminals, okay?
[29:34.040 --> 29:39.480]  And so, of course, Elena Kagan needs to recuse herself her honorable excellency.
[29:39.480 --> 29:45.360]  Some Obama crook up there trying to shove a government takeover of our lives so that
[29:45.360 --> 29:50.240]  fat witch has control of our lives, I'm sick of it, I hate you tyrant.
[29:50.240 --> 30:01.200]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.200 --> 30:05.240]  I had tried everything, I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting
[30:05.240 --> 30:07.880]  weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[30:07.880 --> 30:12.640]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins
[30:12.640 --> 30:18.240]  and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and
[30:18.240 --> 30:19.240]  be satisfied.
[30:19.240 --> 30:23.600]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at infowarstein.com but I want to point out
[30:23.600 --> 30:31.160]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[30:31.160 --> 30:34.880]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound.
[30:34.880 --> 30:39.120]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[30:39.120 --> 30:41.520]  than 37 pounds in just two months.
[30:41.520 --> 30:42.960]  Now, that's results.
[30:42.960 --> 30:48.720]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarstein.com and to order just three of
[30:48.720 --> 30:54.160]  their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite
[30:54.160 --> 30:55.800]  almost immediately.

[31:01.280 --> 31:08.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[31:08.000 --> 31:12.680]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[31:12.680 --> 31:21.720]  There's a place down at Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[31:21.720 --> 31:28.840]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[31:28.840 --> 31:34.960]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[31:34.960 --> 31:39.920]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[31:39.920 --> 31:46.720]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[31:46.720 --> 31:51.280]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
[31:51.280 --> 31:53.440]  ride all day with confidence.
[31:53.440 --> 31:56.400]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[31:56.400 --> 32:01.560]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[32:01.560 --> 32:03.200]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[32:03.200 --> 32:07.920]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized
[32:07.920 --> 32:08.920]  risk.
[32:08.920 --> 32:10.160]  Saving means to make money.
[32:10.160 --> 32:14.400]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[32:14.400 --> 32:19.920]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[32:19.920 --> 32:25.680]  It's made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants
[32:25.680 --> 32:27.360]  or antibacterials.
[32:27.360 --> 32:32.880]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[32:32.880 --> 32:35.240]  and a terrorizing clothing called lint.
[32:35.240 --> 32:38.560]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[32:38.560 --> 32:40.640]  to do something you've never done before.
[32:40.640 --> 32:48.760]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[32:48.760 --> 32:55.720]  Look, I don't normally attack enemies of liberty off of how they look, but if you want to get
[32:55.720 --> 33:22.080]  a free catalog, you can go to Calben on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[33:22.080 --> 33:31.560]  That's 100% text book conflict of interest.
[33:31.560 --> 33:37.400]  It'd be like Hitler sitting as the head judge of the Nuremberg trial.
[33:37.400 --> 33:41.280]  Literally, that's what this is like.
[33:41.280 --> 33:45.680]  Or it'd be like Joseph Stalin sitting in a war crime tribunal where communists are being
[33:45.680 --> 33:46.680]  looked at.
[33:46.680 --> 33:47.680]  It is so ridiculous.
[33:47.680 --> 33:54.360]  I don't want to know why all the rulers over me now look like Pat from Saturday Night Live.
[33:54.360 --> 33:55.600]  It's weird.
[33:55.600 --> 33:57.600]  It's like discrimination.
[33:57.600 --> 33:58.600]  What about other women?
[33:58.600 --> 33:59.600]  What about other men?
[33:59.600 --> 34:06.400]  I mean, if you're a forteranny, hate liberty, and look like Janet Napolitano or Kagan, you
[34:06.400 --> 34:13.080]  go right to the top.
[34:13.080 --> 34:16.240]  I mean, maybe it is like Mars attacks, and really that's like a rubber suit and it's
[34:16.240 --> 34:20.520]  a gray alien or something, and that's just what they manufacture off world.
[34:20.520 --> 34:26.080]  It's that suit, that outfit, and that's, maybe it is a, maybe David Ike's right.
[34:26.080 --> 34:32.520]  Maybe she's a reptoid, and that's her, like a rubber suit.
[34:32.520 --> 34:35.160]  I'm joking before the New York Times goes with that.
[34:35.160 --> 34:37.040]  I just, I'm going crazy, man.
[34:37.040 --> 34:38.640]  I can't handle it anymore.
[34:38.640 --> 34:42.960]  Folks, it is totally unconstitutional for the government to make you buy healthcare,
[34:42.960 --> 34:43.960]  and I've had lawyers on.
[34:43.960 --> 34:45.560]  I've read the court rulings.
[34:45.560 --> 34:47.000]  It's well known.
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.840]  It's totally illegal for her to sit in judgment of her own law.
[34:49.840 --> 34:53.480]  She helped write, and that she helped promote to Congress.
[34:53.480 --> 34:56.400]  On record, I just read to you senators pointing it out.
[34:56.400 --> 35:02.080]  Want me to tell you again?
[35:02.080 --> 35:11.040]  Section 455b, that's section 455b3 of Title 28 of U.S. Code, I read to you earlier.
[35:11.040 --> 35:12.040]  But it gets worse.
[35:12.040 --> 35:19.520]  But on just weights and measures, that's the Constitution term for discrimination.
[35:19.520 --> 35:31.560]  Selective enforcement of regulations and laws is the essence, the spark, the soul, the heart,
[35:31.560 --> 35:38.840]  the core, the ether of tyranny and oppression.
[35:38.840 --> 35:41.720]  They don't want total government for everybody.
[35:41.720 --> 35:47.080]  It's for us, not for them, who openly engage in any crime you can imagine.
[35:47.080 --> 35:52.560]  U.N., diplomatic immunity, running giant, child kidnapping rings, snuff filming children,
[35:52.560 --> 35:55.640]  minor footnote, nobody gets in trouble.
[35:55.640 --> 35:59.080]  Diplomatic immunity, they're pushing forward to take over your country's taxes with carbon
[35:59.080 --> 36:04.160]  taxes, engage in any crime, and exempt themselves from their own rules, shutting down the power
[36:04.160 --> 36:06.160]  plants and building them in China.
[36:06.160 --> 36:13.200]  Just every form of these crooks trampling us, laughing at us.
[36:13.200 --> 36:17.240]  No excess is enough for them, because that's the religion of domination.
[36:17.240 --> 36:20.960]  That's the whole point, isn't it, be over the top, till we just go into a catatonic
[36:20.960 --> 36:33.720]  state, fall down in a fetal position, and just kneel before an army of Cagans, Elena
[36:33.720 --> 36:36.960]  Kagan.
[36:36.960 --> 36:41.560]  It's so disgusting.
[36:41.560 --> 36:48.640]  Humanity is powerful, strong, we're the equivalent of a 10,000-foot silver giant with huge battle
[36:48.640 --> 36:55.840]  axes, and outtotals, or slides like a slug, the spirit of the New World Order that looks
[36:55.840 --> 36:56.840]  just like Elena Kagan.
[36:56.840 --> 37:00.800]  That's why they like her, that's the spirit of it.
[37:00.800 --> 37:09.200]  Being a trail of pus, of half-digested children squirting out the back, because killing kids
[37:09.200 --> 37:13.760]  is what the New World Order is always into, in wars, in euthanasia, in abortion, she loves
[37:13.760 --> 37:14.760]  that.
[37:14.760 --> 37:22.040]  Killing kids up to three, first it's up to birth, now to three, oh yeah, so she's got
[37:22.040 --> 37:27.160]  this trail of the most nauseous rotten meat-smelling thing you can imagine behind her, and she's
[37:27.160 --> 37:35.400]  about a foot tall and about two feet long, and she slithers up to a 10,000-foot juggernaut,
[37:35.400 --> 37:37.620]  and we just fall to our knees.
[37:37.620 --> 37:42.240]  She just lifts up her dress and just the stink of rotten meat comes out, and everybody
[37:42.240 --> 37:47.280]  just falls to their knees, ah, ruler, you're too powerful, and we're just like, take our
[37:47.280 --> 37:51.560]  children, stick your hands down their pants, and they're like, that's right, forward armies,
[37:51.560 --> 37:57.120]  we're at a file-trading New World Order, yeah, we're gonna slaughter everybody, because we're
[37:57.120 --> 37:59.000]  the authorities.
[37:59.000 --> 38:05.640]  She's a big fat maggot wearing a pearl necklace, she's Kagan, bow to her, Janet Reno, burn
[38:05.640 --> 38:14.160]  the kids at Waco, it's so trendy.
[38:14.160 --> 38:17.320]  I probably shouldn't even be on the air today.
[38:17.320 --> 38:18.760]  Was I in a good mood for going on air today?
[38:18.760 --> 38:19.760]  No, I wasn't.
[38:19.760 --> 38:22.360]  I was stomping around cussing, which I shouldn't be doing.
[38:22.360 --> 38:25.480]  It's really starting to get to me, in fact, I know what's happening, I gotta get her off
[38:25.480 --> 38:40.600]  screen, I've got her on the TV over here, and it's making me mad right now.
[38:40.600 --> 38:46.280]  I was at the Supreme Court a couple years ago, it was on like a Sunday, we're just getting
[38:46.280 --> 38:51.880]  some b-roll, and a cop, federal police, it jumps out and goes, what are you doing?
[38:51.880 --> 38:57.280]  And I was down at the bottom, so I kind of turned into one of the marble feet, and it
[38:57.280 --> 39:01.080]  went through my Levi's and jabbed into my shin, only time I've ever had an infection
[39:01.080 --> 39:05.960]  like this, got super infected, and I didn't know it, it was like rotting all the meat
[39:05.960 --> 39:10.320]  out inside my leg, I didn't know, I finally went to the doctor, so I was like bitten by
[39:10.320 --> 39:15.880]  the satanic building, but it was the reverence of like, what are you doing?
[39:15.880 --> 39:17.960]  And he was like, do you know how important this building is?
[39:17.960 --> 39:20.880]  He would talk about the justice, I ended up being nice to him, I said, I'm gonna talk
[39:20.880 --> 39:21.880]  to this poor victim.
[39:21.880 --> 39:25.400]  I was like, oh really, tell me what it's like to be around him, he's like, oh, and suddenly
[39:25.400 --> 39:30.840]  oh, film if you want, oh, it's so incredible, oh my, he was all threatening to arrest me
[39:30.840 --> 39:34.280]  and stuff, you know, you don't film this without permission, I'm like, I didn't say, first
[39:34.280 --> 39:38.200]  amendment, pal, watch it, I decided to do a test, because I could see the guy who wasn't
[39:38.200 --> 39:42.560]  evil, he was just a victim of the brainwashing, and I went, oh, I'm sorry, I just wanted it
[39:42.560 --> 39:47.560]  for B-roll for my TV show, oh, it's a political show, kind of libertarian in Austin, yeah,
[39:47.560 --> 39:51.840]  oh, it's so neat, what's it like working around the justices, oh, it must be really, and he's
[39:51.840 --> 39:58.000]  like, oh, he's like, oh yes, and his eyes got all starry, oh, it's so incredible, they're
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.960]  such incredible people, oh, they're so powerful, I mean, he was like talking about spiritual
[40:03.960 --> 40:10.760]  cesspits of demonic weakness and servile evil and fraud, but he was speaking of it with
[40:10.760 --> 40:17.520]  great reverence and power, and just drifting with enjoyment and enslavement and his commitment
[40:17.520 --> 40:28.280]  to serving it, I don't like these people, as you can tell, I can see them and it's disgusting,
[40:28.280 --> 40:34.360]  they're a danger to everyone, I can barely control myself right now, knowing I'll soon
[40:34.360 --> 40:40.640]  be under their control with healthcare, they're already got their bioethics boards announcing
[40:40.640 --> 40:44.120]  that when you are going to be in a car wreck, they're going to try to be a computer to tell
[40:44.120 --> 40:49.040]  the doctors that they can render care or not, and what care can be done, I mean, the hellishness
[40:49.040 --> 40:55.760]  that these horrible demons are going to run healthcare, and it's going to be done illegally
[40:55.760 --> 41:01.440]  by that witch who knows she's not allowed to sit over it, and I need to get into the
[41:01.440 --> 41:05.920]  other news, it just makes me want to throw up, and I haven't even gotten into the other
[41:05.920 --> 41:13.080]  news yet, this is from CNS News, this has been the issue with it all the time, you can debate
[41:13.080 --> 41:16.680]  whether the government can make you get healthcare or not, which of course they can't, you can
[41:16.680 --> 41:25.800]  debate it, there's one out of a hundred points that you might be able to try to argue fraudulently,
[41:25.800 --> 41:31.160]  but you cannot debate that the 2,000 plus waivers he's given, he gave one to McDonald's
[41:31.160 --> 41:36.000]  for their tens of thousands of employees, they don't have to get them healthcare, he
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.440]  gave it to all the big unions, all these companies that are in favor with the globalist, they
[41:41.440 --> 41:47.680]  get to stay open, they don't have to go get the government healthcare, and it's totally
[41:47.680 --> 41:56.280]  illegal, it's not just unconstitutional, it's selective enforcement, here it is, administration
[41:56.280 --> 42:01.120]  admits to court under Obamacare, select group can get healthcare, not pay for it, not buy
[42:01.120 --> 42:06.920]  insurance and not pay penalty, that's another unfair deal, is that certain groups are just
[42:06.920 --> 42:11.000]  going to get totally free healthcare all the way out, others aren't even guaranteed it
[42:11.000 --> 42:17.320]  like pre-existing conditions in children, and then other companies don't have to get
[42:17.320 --> 42:21.120]  their employees, so it's just whatever they say, it's like whatever the insurance companies
[42:21.120 --> 42:25.880]  in banks say, and now they're going to run your healthcare, the HMOs, and make you buy
[42:25.880 --> 42:31.720]  it, it's already made the price go up, make you buy it, and then control the healthcare
[42:31.720 --> 42:35.920]  and make you pay more for not getting healthcare, I'm going to tell you again, Paul Watson over
[42:35.920 --> 42:41.400]  a month ago got a chest cold, it took him a month to get into the health service, he
[42:41.400 --> 42:45.320]  got in about a week and a half ago, and they gave him a bag with some Band-Aids and some
[42:45.320 --> 42:48.400]  aspirin and some Tylenol, and they said, aren't you going to swab me, aren't you going to
[42:48.400 --> 42:54.480]  see if it's bacterial or viral, and they said, nope, you've just been, you say you were jogging
[42:54.480 --> 42:59.480]  on a treadmill a month ago, you overexerted yourself, stop exercising, and when the Fukushima
[42:59.480 --> 43:02.480]  people are dying, they don't get healthcare, Paul's got an article just went up, they
[43:02.480 --> 43:09.040]  call him mentally ill, when the troops are down to do you, you're mentally ill, he goes
[43:09.040 --> 43:12.760]  in, national healthcare, and I said, well why don't you go see a private doctor, because
[43:12.760 --> 43:16.560]  I know they have him, he goes, well you have to be recommended and referred by the national
[43:16.560 --> 43:21.320]  health service, they have to decide, and Paul's like, may I go see, get a referral to a private
[43:21.320 --> 43:32.880]  practitioner, no, here is your bag of Band-Aids and aspirin, oh yeah, we've got control now,
[43:32.880 --> 43:41.560]  oh man, all these idiot cattle out there, I think they're about to get some free healthcare,
[43:41.560 --> 43:44.880]  and Bill Gates is there with the nurses last year, we've played the clip 50 times, so I'll
[43:44.880 --> 43:51.680]  play it again, I'll tell you, a lot of people don't like, a lot of people don't like what
[43:51.680 --> 43:56.040]  they call death panels, and everybody giggles, but I tell you, you don't give granny into
[43:56.040 --> 44:02.080]  care lives, that last year you hired 10 teachers, and the teachers are all like, they're being
[44:02.080 --> 44:07.240]  taught gladiatorily, kill a grandma, I get some money, as if the bankers want to give
[44:07.240 --> 44:13.800]  you some money, honey, as if you're going to get something when somebody else loses,
[44:13.800 --> 44:17.560]  I hear these good old boys for the last eight, nine years going, I'm glad we're in Iraq,
[44:17.560 --> 44:22.960]  we need the oil, and I told them, then I said, listen, moron, do you think the elite murdering
[44:22.960 --> 44:26.480]  all those people over there on lies and having our troops get killed, went over there to
[44:26.480 --> 44:33.520]  steal the oil to give it to you, Jack, do you know that the UN and all the different groups,
[44:33.520 --> 44:40.680]  the IMF World Bank and OPEC were angry, it was all over the news, pre-1991 that Saddam
[44:40.680 --> 44:44.400]  was selling too much oil and driving down the price, they were paying like 89 cents
[44:44.400 --> 44:51.800]  then or less, and they were telling him, stop pumping, do you understand that once they
[44:51.800 --> 44:57.300]  got there, they shut the oil off, that boosts the price, idiots, you're paying over four
[44:57.300 --> 45:03.680]  bucks now, do you understand, idiots, that it isn't your military, it isn't your country
[45:03.680 --> 45:07.600]  anymore, it's been taken over by foreign banks that are totally criminal publicly, who were
[45:07.600 --> 45:11.240]  butchering the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution so they can rob you seven ways
[45:11.240 --> 45:16.200]  to Sunday, they're paramilitarizing the police, have totally legal surveillance in place everywhere,
[45:16.200 --> 45:19.960]  are building giant FEMA camps all over the place and now admitting it and saying they'll
[45:19.960 --> 45:24.200]  secretly arrest and kill anybody they want and shut the media off, people are like, well,
[45:24.200 --> 45:28.720]  I've nothing to hide, I'll just go along with it, oh, just like women that can't believe
[45:28.720 --> 45:32.240]  they're being grabbed in a parking lot and put in a van, they just go along with it because
[45:32.240 --> 45:37.280]  they hope it'll be okay, and three weeks later, they're on a dirty mattress with a guy behind
[45:37.280 --> 45:44.600]  them, raping them with a cattle prod, because you wanna be gullible, because people that
[45:44.600 --> 45:49.720]  have red blood and are angry and who are desperately trying to wake you out of your trance will
[45:49.720 --> 45:57.680]  actually talk to you straight, this isn't a game, idiots, it isn't a game, it isn't
[45:57.680 --> 46:04.360]  Alex Jones is out of control, no, I'm in control and I know what we're facing and I know how
[46:04.360 --> 46:09.080]  bad it is and I'm upset.
[46:09.080 --> 46:12.240]  You know they're still coming after the gentleman in Illinois even though it got thrown out
[46:12.240 --> 46:17.800]  of court by one judge for taping police, he's facing life in prison again, they're arresting
[46:17.800 --> 46:22.560]  people everywhere for filming police in public and courts are ruling they can do it, they're
[46:22.560 --> 46:26.680]  now arresting people for talking back to police and charging them with felonies saying the
[46:26.680 --> 46:31.760]  words are an assault, they're now charging people with felonies who ball up while being
[46:31.760 --> 46:43.280]  billy clubbed, oh it's just, I think I'm joking here man, where is it, you have that video
[46:43.280 --> 46:48.400]  clip ready, we're gonna go to it here in a minute, man arrested charged with assault
[46:48.400 --> 46:56.400]  for pointing finger at cops and there's witnesses saying he didn't do anything but pull a cigarette
[46:56.400 --> 47:01.880]  outside of his pocket but they say that because a finger could look like a gun, I'm not joking,
[47:01.880 --> 47:07.480]  we got a link to the arrest indictment affidavit, this guy and they've got this weird woman
[47:07.480 --> 47:12.960]  in the newscast who's getting off, she's drinking the tyranny, they've got the spokesman for
[47:12.960 --> 47:18.880]  the police and she's got that same weird, well let the court decide this and handle it, he
[47:18.880 --> 47:27.280]  knows what he did and she's just going, they're all in the prison, their money is mine, I mean
[47:27.280 --> 47:31.840]  it is just like that's who they are, she's controlling it though, she's got that same,
[47:31.840 --> 47:42.640]  I can't even do it, let me try for viewers to actually give you the look, it's like a,
[47:42.640 --> 47:49.320]  that's their spirit folks, I can see them and I mean and they're like, your country is ours,
[47:49.320 --> 47:59.640]  your planet is ours, New World Order, send in the rulers, and it'll cape, it's Kagan, totally
[47:59.640 --> 48:05.960]  committing crime in front of everyone, set to rule on the law she wrote, Kagan solicitor
[48:05.960 --> 48:14.240]  general, now rules on her legislation, totally illegal, core sign, robbing your money, totally
[48:14.240 --> 48:21.000]  illegal, flaunting in your face, media going along with it, and I mean you got to watch
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.320]  this video, it's up at infowars.com, man arrested, charged with assault, for pointing finger
[48:25.320 --> 48:29.560]  at cops, disrespecting the police officer is now a crime, let's play part of the news
[48:29.560 --> 48:36.960]  clip, here it is, a pointed finger lands a father in jail, that's right in this Fredericksburg
[48:36.960 --> 48:41.960]  band in fact says he didn't even point his finger at police officers, but now he faces
[48:41.960 --> 48:46.160]  two felony charges, Gail Huff is live from Fredericksburg tonight with the details on
[48:46.160 --> 48:52.360]  this story, Gail, well police say pointed a finger like this and that felt very threatening
[48:52.360 --> 48:59.040]  to them, in fact he ended up arrested, charged with assault, he made the motion of shooting
[48:59.040 --> 49:02.400]  at the officers with his hand.
[49:02.400 --> 49:09.560]  David Lawless is accused of pointing his finger at two Fredericksburg detectives, that's enough
[49:09.560 --> 49:13.760]  you can watch it infowars.com, if you can't see the woman, I've noticed this with the
[49:13.760 --> 49:20.360]  really evil ones, when they talk, they creamily enjoy the power and she enjoys the power over
[49:20.360 --> 49:25.200]  people, all those prisoners, and she touches her teeth together, when she talks, her lips
[49:25.200 --> 49:30.520]  enjoy and she goes, when she's talking she's going touching her teeth together, I've noticed
[49:30.520 --> 49:39.920]  that with the really bad ones, I've learned their mannerisms, that she talks, again they're
[49:39.920 --> 49:45.920]  the priest of power, as O'Brien torturing Winston 1984 is leaning over him on the rack
[49:45.920 --> 49:50.240]  and he's saying, we're here to make humanity ugly and still uglier, as he pulls one of
[49:50.240 --> 49:54.200]  Winston's rotten teeth out and he looks at him and he says, you look at my old face and
[49:54.200 --> 49:59.600]  you think I'm weak, but my weakness in my wrinkles is the sign of the vigour of the
[49:59.600 --> 50:04.080]  overall organism, you see we're here to make society more horrible, more brutish, we're
[50:04.080 --> 50:09.080]  here to trample and be trampled upon Winston, we're here to wreck society where the priest
[50:09.080 --> 50:16.120]  of power always pressing on the nerve of power Winston, more ugly, more oppressive, that's
[50:16.120 --> 50:20.880]  what we're going to do, nothing's going to stop us Winston, it's a society run by psychopaths,
[50:20.880 --> 50:27.800]  more psychopaths for our enjoyment, do you understand scum, Winston, something will stop
[50:27.800 --> 50:32.240]  you, a spirit in the universe, something will stop you, no it won't Winston, nothing will
[50:32.240 --> 50:37.880]  stop it, what do you think there's gravity, we can have our scientists have two systems
[50:37.880 --> 50:42.320]  where there is gravity for navigating ships and aircraft and for the general public where
[50:42.320 --> 50:49.720]  there is no gravity, we can do that Winston, it's justice for the government to publicly
[50:49.720 --> 50:55.040]  run al-Qaeda and have them blowing stuff up in Libya and Afghanistan and Iran, but then
[50:55.040 --> 50:59.880]  al-Qaeda's bad and we have to give our rights up because al-Qaeda may hit us any moment,
[50:59.880 --> 51:00.880]  ooooh.

[51:52.880 --> 52:04.560]  it's an Info War, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[52:04.560 --> 52:08.000]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[52:08.000 --> 52:12.320]  like no one is home, don't let your home be the next target, make it look like someone
[52:12.320 --> 52:17.120]  is home watching television with fake TV, fake TV is a small electronic device that
[52:17.120 --> 52:21.000]  makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.920]  home watching TV, fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer but is far more convincing
[52:25.920 --> 52:31.240]  to burglars, fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm and is highly recommended
[52:31.240 --> 52:35.520]  by numerous police departments, use it anytime you're away from home, to order your fake

[54:26.240 --> 54:47.040]  Yeah I know James Brown's feeling deep inside and I'm super bad, super bad means super good.
[54:47.040 --> 55:05.480]  Fear of radiation treated as psychiatric disorder, that's right let me read that headline again.
[55:05.480 --> 55:13.080]  Fear of radiation treated as psychiatric disorder in Fukushima, they just had 5 reactors completely
[55:13.080 --> 55:18.440]  melt down and blow up including a uranium reactor the most deadly, children have been
[55:18.440 --> 55:22.640]  dropping dead that's what happens it causes heart failure, a lot of the workers have
[55:22.640 --> 55:28.280]  died but they always just keep it as a minor footnote in the news.
[55:28.280 --> 55:32.960]  Despite proven track record of official deception over disaster they give you Prozac if you
[55:32.960 --> 55:38.960]  come in with your child bleeding out of every orifice.
[55:38.960 --> 55:43.760]  They're calling it insane and they're putting them in mental wards and not giving a medical
[55:43.760 --> 55:48.600]  treatment when they collapse because there's nothing going on kind of like this guy who
[55:48.600 --> 55:56.240]  it turns out has no criminal record, 50 something years old who's been arrested in charge with
[55:56.240 --> 56:01.920]  assault for pointing finger at cops, it turns out he's a guy involved in the community no
[56:01.920 --> 56:13.480]  criminal record and who's liked and the police were accusing his son in a robbery case and
[56:13.480 --> 56:18.040]  he told them that they were liars so they said your fingers a gun pointing at you're
[56:18.040 --> 56:22.840]  going to jail and that's what the rest of the news caskets into.
[56:22.840 --> 56:31.360]  Think anybody's safe there, oh where'd Bob go, oh he pointed his finger at the police
[56:31.360 --> 56:34.560]  and that's assault, that's what he's charged with.
[56:34.560 --> 56:40.480]  Fear of radiation treated as psychiatric disorder, big article at infowars.com and again I want
[56:40.480 --> 56:44.480]  to get Dr. Doug Rocky on it for like 30 minutes soon if we can about this because that's what
[56:44.480 --> 56:47.560]  they told him, he was the head of the DU program.
[56:47.560 --> 56:52.040]  The head of the DU program in the 80s and 90s wrote the book on it, he's got like two
[56:52.040 --> 56:57.760]  or three degrees, biology, physics, he was the head of the program wrote the book but
[56:57.760 --> 57:01.520]  back in the 40s they knew it was deadly when they had DU the military looked at using it,
[57:01.520 --> 57:05.760]  not until 90 did they allow its use and now it's just served out everywhere, shooting
[57:05.760 --> 57:10.720]  ranges for the military, it's put in concrete, it's put in forklifts, it's put in airplane
[57:10.720 --> 57:21.040]  parts, it's everywhere, it's like all nutritious, deadly poisonous, not just radioactive and
[57:21.040 --> 57:26.160]  when the troops in congressional testimony, I remember a Marine Corps captain in the wheelchair
[57:26.160 --> 57:30.000]  weighed about 75 pounds, he died a few weeks after the testimony, was like please give
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.520]  me medical help, they say I'm mentally ill and the guy is shaking uncontrollably, looks
[57:33.520 --> 57:38.320]  like worse than a concentration camp victim, he was dead soon and they're like mentally
[57:38.320 --> 57:41.760]  ill, mentally ill, mentally ill, you're not ill, die, now go in the coffin, when you
[57:41.760 --> 57:46.400]  die and go in the coffin it's, of course they did all the major medical reports on their
[57:46.400 --> 57:52.000]  brain stems and found chemical weapons from what was blown up at the bases in Iraq and
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.120]  the DU, I mean they go get private autopsies and they're like yeah they died of chemical
[57:57.120 --> 58:03.120]  weapons of radiation and then doctors are dying of it, they go you're mentally ill,
[58:03.120 --> 58:06.960]  here's prozac and they're like no, my kidneys are failing, that's what the DU does, I need
[58:06.960 --> 58:12.320]  surgery and you don't get surgery, it doesn't exist, but my kidneys are failing, doesn't
[58:12.320 --> 58:18.560]  matter, say it didn't DU will give you surgery, literally, but it's DU, you're not getting
[58:18.560 --> 58:25.120]  the surgery then, you're mentally ill, and if you argue with me I'm going to say you're
[58:25.120 --> 58:28.520]  PTSD, you're not going to be able to own guns anymore and I'm going to send the police
[58:28.520 --> 58:35.400]  by to take your guns, and if you think it's wrong, we'll just say you're crazy like they
[58:35.400 --> 58:47.000]  did in the Soviet Union, we'll be right back, this is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio
[58:47.000 --> 58:49.640]  Network.
[58:49.640 --> 58:55.960]  A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty
[58:55.960 --> 59:00.600]  good sized meal that I was still starving, and my research led me to a well-known fact
[59:00.600 --> 59:04.840]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[59:04.840 --> 59:10.240]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[59:10.240 --> 59:15.280]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[59:15.280 --> 59:21.160]  be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there, and discovered

[59:25.840 --> 59:30.520]  need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've

[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:13.040]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:41.040]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:48.920]  Dr. Steve Pacenek is going to be joining us coming up the next segment. I'm going to
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:54.800]  be honest with you, I started my super exercise regimen of running twice a day again. I went
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.320]  out of town for a few weeks and got off my exercise regimen and stopped losing weight
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.400]  and forgot to take my Tangy Tangerine and pollen burst, and for the last few weeks I've
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:10.200]  been back on it, and I am so crazed right now. The combination of exercising and researching
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.560]  things and how crazy it's gotten is that I've gotten a bit crazed today. But if you're
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:18.800]  not upset, there's something wrong with you. I love that bumper sticker. If you're not
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.400]  upset, you're not paying attention.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:27.200]  I dovetailed with the articles here, man arrested, charged with assault for pointing
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:33.440]  finger at cops, disrespecting police officers, now a felony crime, infowarseteam.com. Then
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:40.920]  I have these articles also from infowarseteam.com. There's links to the Orange County Register.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:45.360]  We're not joking about this. DHS, all the time people see our articles and they go,
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:52.360]  oh, this isn't true. Not even looking at the links. No, it's true. DHS raids home to seize
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:58.960]  deadly hair straighteners. Federal agency founded to fight terrorism continues war on
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:06.280]  grooming appliances. The Department of Homeland Security, a federal agency created in the
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:13.920]  aftermath of 9-11, to fight terrorism has continued its war on potentially deadly grooming
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:22.400]  appliances by raiding a home in the affluent Orange County City of Laguna, Nigel, to seize
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.680]  alleged counterfeit hair straighteners. By the way, I want to do this on the nightly
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:30.600]  news tonight. I know it does and they're listening. I want to add this one report. This is on
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.960]  the nightly news. It turns into two hours every night. They already got a bunch in there.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:41.640]  They're getting ready for it. I want to go pull up the Fox News and AP article. The headline
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:49.440]  is $15 million fines for garage sale. And by the way, we think I'm joking. It goes
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:55.920]  like $5,000 first fine, $100,000 next, million, then $15 million. I'm not joking. Truth is
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:04.760]  more absurd than any Kurt Vonnegut novel that I could give you an anecdote from. And all
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.200]  over the place now they're saying, oh, there's a lead toy. We've got a SWAT team. We're sitting
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.600]  a Department of Education SWAT team, even though there is no one in a SWAT team legally
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:20.920]  there, to somebody's house because they didn't pay a student loan, when there is no criminal
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:26.920]  statute involved. It's just all lawless craziness. Yeah, there it is. Yeah, yeah, $15 million.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:33.680]  You know, I'm sorry, I said a million. Yeah, new government policy. If I can scroll down,
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.720]  I can read them the headline. Thanks. New government policy imposes strict standards
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:45.400]  on garage sales nationwide. Americans who slap $1 price tags on their used possessions
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:51.920]  at garage sales or bazaars, events risk being slapped with fines up to $15 million thanks
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:59.960]  to new government campaign. And that's from three years ago. Print that for me, please.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:06.480]  That's a Fox News article right there. But, but Sandusky can do what he does for 20 years
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.160]  and not get in trouble. Here's another one. Insane Michigan government announces plans
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:17.000]  to destroy ranch livestock based on hair color. So instead of just getting citizens involved
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.680]  in a campaign to kill feral hogs, government is saying if your pig has any hair, we're
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:30.320]  going to kill it. That's the bureaucrats for you. Most hogs species have visible hair.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.160]  Even the pink ones have white hair. That's one of the more popular types. And you got
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.280]  the ham shires and all the rest of them. So that's being announced. And there's giant
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:43.080]  fines and felonies. So you got to kill all your pigs if they resemble what could be a
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:51.520]  feral hog. It's not feral though. So we got that. Just the bureaucrats are coming. They're
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.560]  going to eat out our substance as the founders said. They're arming against us and they're
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.320]  commanded by goblin creatures like Elena Kagan.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:06.760]  Folks, Iran and the mid-east nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices. Whether

[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:09.100]  power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:14.160]  bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:19.240]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.960]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:29.520]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:33.840]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:38.520]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.720]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:46.780]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can

[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:35.200]  All right, for the next 40 minutes or so, Dr. Steve Pechenik is our guest and I'm going
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:41.840]  to give you a review with Aaron Dykes of the Hunger Games that is a dystopic predictive
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:47.320]  programming piece on Agenda 21 and what the establishment actually wants to establish.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:52.440]  We read the 96 Biological Diversity Assessment by the UN, not the redacted one online, but
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:57.680]  the actual hard copy. It's the society they're proposing. Truth is truly stranger than fiction.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:03.600]  We're going to be going over the blockbuster film coming up. Now, Dr. Steve Pechenik is
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:08.240]  an MD, PhD. He's an American psychiatrist, former State Department official, author
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:14.480]  and publisher. He's the acclaimed author of Psycho Political Thrillers and the co-author
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.320]  of the best-selling Tom Clancy Ops Center and Tom Clancy's NetForce paperback series
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:23.200]  trained in psychiatry at Harvard University International Relations at MIT. His novels
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:27.360]  are based on over 20 years' experience resolving international crises and houses situations
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:32.680]  for the Department of State and for four administrations, and that's putting it lightly, also involved
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.240]  in overthrow of governments and assassinations and things like that. They'll never talk about
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:42.120]  it on air, but Steve Pechenik's very interesting and somehow I'd missed a call from his that
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:47.680]  happens. I get so many calls and I was going through a voicemail and heard it again where
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.760]  he'd called up and said, hey, you know, it's in the Washington Post. It's all these places.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:56.200]  And I was aware of that. I just, I barely mentioned it, but in the larger context, it is important
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:02.440]  to show how the system scrambled to try to counter the info we put out last year that
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:06.360]  Bin Laden was killed many years ago with Dr. Pechenik's information because that's what
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:12.160]  was in it. And you know, the show, videos of the radio show, we're seeing tens of millions
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:17.880]  of times online on top of our 15 million listeners a week. And most of the military
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:22.080]  I talked to didn't buy it. I mean, I was talking to a Marine Corps major just the other day.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:28.360]  I said, none of them buy it. And of course, the SEALs, helicopter blowing up, all of it,
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:34.280]  the SEAL Team 6 people getting killed, all of it is a major coverup. And the strat for
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.400]  emails, especially a CIA front, so it looks like it's private intelligence, but highly
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.920]  connected to, you know, kind of leak info out so they can say that the CIA is an operating
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:48.400]  domestically based here in Austin, was saying, oh my gosh, Alex Jones is terrible. He's crazy.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.400]  Glenn Beck too. You know, they're not going along with the fact he was thrown in the ocean
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.080]  and all this. They need to show the fact that he's really at this military base, which
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:01.440]  is another Psyop and then a Psyop to act like, well, yeah, don't believe the official story,
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:05.120]  but most of it's true. So they do that when they know you're not buying it.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:11.440]  And so Steve Pachennick, Dr. Pachennick has some comments on all of this and says he talked
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.760]  to some intelligence people and tested some of the info to find out who's involved in
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:21.000]  the coverup. And he's here to explain that because it shows how desperate they are to
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.320]  shut this down. If it wasn't true, they wouldn't be running around like chickens with their
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.200]  heads cut off behind the scenes worried about this with the Huffington Post and the Washington
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:36.080]  Post and all these other publications attacking with this info. So Dr. Pachennick, thanks
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.080]  for coming on with us.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:41.680]  Oh, it's always a pleasure, Alex. I think this is your moment in history. I don't want
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:46.240]  to exaggerate, but basically what you said and what you asked me 10 years ago, what did
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:52.840]  I think about 9 11 Osama bin Laden? And I told you only you that Osama bin Laden was dead.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:58.240]  He had Marfan syndrome. So we know that medically it started under Clinton. It was continued
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:05.880]  under Bush Jr. And of course, this president, Obama really exaggerated and lied completely
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:11.600]  along with Biden. But unfortunately, the entire military industrial complex now intelligence
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:17.360]  complex is really in a series of self destructive mode. And I tested it out. It wasn't just
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:23.040]  something that I wanted to just accept because you went forward. I felt you were very brave.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.200]  I felt that there was a need for someone like you and I was more than happy to talk on the
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:34.080]  air and the entire system really went to the forefront to try to discredit you and it turned
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:40.680]  really tried to discredit me. And how this happened is a year in November of last year,
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:44.360]  I was invited into a meeting where they were intelligence individuals. I'm still a member
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.480]  of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, National Military Intelligence,
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:53.240]  AFSC, House on Fire Relations, but you all got to understand I'm not acting on anybody's
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:59.280]  behalf of my own as an American citizen patriot who's getting really resentful of the fact
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:06.240]  that our military is being abused by our intelligence system and our civilians in order to betray
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:14.920]  and penetrate our civilian population with lies, distortion, and deceit, and attacks.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:19.200]  And let me be very specific. And in order to test it, besides the predictions I made
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:25.160]  on your show, I put in what we call a poison pill into the intelligence community. They
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:30.280]  weren't even aware of it. But the technical term is I doubled up some agents. I did some
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:39.120]  disinformation. But what came forth on March 6 in the Huffington Post is the issue that
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:45.840]  you and Alec Beck were crazy because Fred Burton, who I happened to know about, he works
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.040]  for Stratford in Austin, but he was in the diplomatic security system.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.520]  Didn't he work for you?
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.720]  Well, he worked down to me. I was deputy assistant secretary of management. He was too low and
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:59.760]  not really significant, not the brightest man in the world. He called you crazy and
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:05.000]  he called Glenn Beck crazy. But what was more important is how they compromised. The entire
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.400]  intelligence system was compromised as follows. This poison pill that was really intellectual
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:15.200]  went through military intelligence in the Army, went through military intelligence in
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:20.640]  the Air Force Navy, went through the DNI, that's the director of national intelligence,
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:26.880]  James Clapper, who reaffirmed the story. Unfortunately, the Council on Farm Relations, it went through
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.440]  the office of the National Security Council under Obama, who reaffirmed that he killed
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:35.480]  Osama bin Laden, which means that he's the only president in the United States to have
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:41.640]  killed a dead man who's been dead for 10 years and was willing to lie repeatedly, went through
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:45.720]  of the vice president's office, Biden, who of course is not the very brightest man in
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:50.480]  the world. I think he has two aneurysms. This is the man who told us about FDR, giving
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.920]  a speech into the pressure in 1929 on television when there wasn't television and there wasn't
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:56.920]  FDR.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.400]  FDR wasn't until 33.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.280]  That's exactly right. But this is our leaders. These are civic leaders. These are civilians
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.720]  who have been so-called elected, no better than any of the others, no better than anybody
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:15.120]  else. And it went through, not only through the military intelligence, went through the
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.920]  CIA, and I'm afraid the one I admire the most, General Petraeus, really has to evaluate
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:26.000]  what he has done, what his involvement is, and who was involved in the CIA, because this
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.680]  is an old CIA storyline that goes back to the days of Clinton, Bush Jr., and I would
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:38.600]  strongly recommend that Petraeus do an evaluation of the CIA and either fire the people there
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:44.600]  or resign himself, including James Clapper, who's a former general, including Petraeus,
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:49.160]  who's a former general. I would say strongly that the three generals who charge the military
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:53.560]  intelligence, I will not name them. They know who they are, should resign because we do
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.560]  have to-
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:00.520]  But just like putting ink into the blood system to test where there's leaks and things, you
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:04.760]  put information in to track it, so explain what you did for folks.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.920]  Well, what I did was literally put in a tracer, an information tracer, to see where it bounced
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:14.960]  around and to see who reaffirmed the story of Osama bin Laden and how they tried to repeatedly
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.760]  in the intelligence community convince me that Osama bin Laden was really alive and
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:24.520]  that they had photographs of him. And I said, give me a break. I do television shows. I've
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:29.320]  seen his medical records, and none of you in the intelligence community has ever dealt
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:34.360]  with his medical record. And those who I hear is his position. He was dead 10 years ago.
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:39.240]  He was never alive. And the point of fact is once you hit the Osama bin Laden story,
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:44.400]  you then get to the president, Obama, who's lying. You get the Bush Jr., who lied, and
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:50.320]  you get the Clinton, because it's Clinton who sent him a position in Dubai at the American
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.560]  Hospital under the CIA and was part of the 9-11.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:59.080]  And by the way, that's CBS News. It's admitted months before 9-11 that happened. But specifically
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:05.440]  just to digress here for a moment, Dr. Pachinicus, I'm trying to understand this. All of this
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:12.360]  is going on, and we have them selling this idea that bin Laden's dead, but then they
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:18.880]  put out the fake photo and let it circle around and later admitted it was a fake photo. But
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:23.320]  when I talked to weaker-minded people in the military and in the general population, they
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:28.320]  think they saw a classified photo, and then I show them the photo and say, see, that's
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.720]  the one they admit is fake. So they did a little psychological warfare thing there, too,
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:37.640]  where they put out a fake photo but never said it was the real photo to make people
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:42.440]  think they saw the photo. I mean, just all these tricks here, and of course, you said
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:48.120]  it was a fake situation room photo. You said all that came out. They admitted that most
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:51.960]  of the stories a lie, but now they're saying still believe a little bit of it. And then
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:57.360]  I talked to a Navy SEAL whose best friend is in SEAL Team 6, and he said SEAL Team 6
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:03.400]  does believe that someone blew up their helicopter and killed them to basically cover up the
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.840]  whole bin Laden situation.
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:09.560]  Well, let's go on and tell them. Let me show you what happened on the Tracer bullet. I
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:15.120]  went through the entire intelligence and military community in order to find out how many people
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:20.960]  were involved in denigrating you and me on the Osama bin Laden, how much money the American
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:26.120]  public has wasted, how much dysfunctional behavior there is in the military intelligence
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.400]  department. You're exposing an Operation Mockingbird.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:37.320]  I get a call from an English reporter who works to quote the Huffington Post in California.
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:41.880]  I do not want to identify him because he has a daughter. He knows exactly who I am. I know
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:48.480]  who he is. He's unnoticed, but basically I will not identify him. He was MI6. Then I
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:53.760]  get a meeting, literally a meeting from that meeting that had November from a Jewish Orthodox
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.800]  young man who works at the Lincoln Laboratories at MIT. I will not identify him. I'm a Mossad
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:05.840]  operative. You're typical low-level incompetent Mossad. Now, this is Israel's finest product.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:10.480]  You have basically what we call a schmendric. A guy who didn't even know what he was doing
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:16.240]  was doubled up so fast. He was pathetic, trying to talk to me and convince me that Osama bin
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:22.160]  Laden was dead. So you have MI6. You have CIA. You have the Mossad. Then you have the
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:28.240]  Huffington Post of the United Kingdom. It is shameful that they were involved, and that
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:33.200]  is a desecration of actually the Internet and it's a violation of criminal law. Then
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:37.800]  we go on to the Washington Post because we're not finished yet. Who comes forward and has
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:43.240]  to propagate the story, but the man we call the harlot of the intelligence community,
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:49.240]  David Ignatius, one of the key writers. You would think by this time the Washington Post
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:54.840]  would know enough and have enough decency and journalistic professionalism to get rid
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:59.920]  of David Ignatius, who barely can write a novel, but does write fiction in his nonfiction
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:05.040]  articles, where he talks about Obama as the head of infidelity and killing, and he wanted
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:08.000]  to kill Vice President Biden to take over the presidency.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.760]  Now, you have to be a moron to literally think about these stories, and a man like Ignatius
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:19.640]  should resign, he should be fired, and this is the kind of event that went on. The millions
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:24.840]  of dollars that were wasted, the millions of dollars that had to be taken in order to
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:30.560]  discredit you, but more importantly me, on the lies that were occurring in order for
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:37.320]  our men to die in Iraq for no purpose, for men to die in Afghanistan because Obama didn't
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:41.840]  really know what he was doing and they're still dying now, for generals who were nothing
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:47.880]  more than professionals lying cowardly individuals who were never able to assert the fact that
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:53.400]  they didn't belong there, who I have reprimanded for over two to three years instead of wasting
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:58.520]  your time promoting your career, worry about the veterans who are coming back, who have
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:04.440]  no jobs, who are not taking care in the veterans administration, who are told by my physicians
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:09.000]  that they're going to be treating 1,000 patients for one physician and the nurses are going
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  to be treating them, and that's General Senceki, who had his leg blown off in Vietnam, but
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.760]  if we treated him today the way we had treated him in Vietnam, he wouldn't have had any leg
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:20.760]  prostheses.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:25.480]  All right, Doc, let me stop you for a moment. Let me stop you for layman out there because
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:30.760]  you're moving fast. When you say it's illegal, you're saying clearly there was an intelligence
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:36.840]  multi-nation operation to have media put out talking points domestically, which is illegal
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:43.600]  under federal law to have the CIA involved in domestic propaganda operations and penetrating
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:49.480]  the country, but other governments were involved, which really makes it media espionage, and
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:55.360]  so yes, that is illegal, and you were testing this. I mean, can you tell us specifically
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.320]  though what you were privately giving them that then came back to you to prove that it
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.480]  was intelligence operations?
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:07.120]  It's a very simple counterintelligence that I do in 30 years taking down regimes and
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:13.400]  neutralizing operatives, often having to neutralize my own CIA operatives who are really dysfunctional.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:18.960]  In 30 years, many of them have become exceedingly dysfunctional. That institution has to be ripped
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:24.600]  apart, taken down, and actually eliminated. There are major heroes in that institution.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:29.480]  They're no longer there. 60 to 80% of them are now on contract offices. General Petraeus
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:34.880]  should be now interrogated and questioned as to what he was doing and what he has been
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:40.320]  selling and allowing to happen. It was simple for me. A guy who's had 30 experience, a man
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:45.640]  who's retired, really without any assets, all I had to do was double one of my friends
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:52.160]  and operatives, tell him certain things, allow those elements that I told him to spread through
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:58.960]  the system and see where it went. It was like putting a blue stain into the water and seeing
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:22:59.960]  where it went.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:04.320]  So that tells you they're really worried about this, and that tells you that they know it's
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:09.880]  a lie. Have you gotten any word about them killing the Navy SEALs?
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:15.080]  But not only was it a lie, of course the Navy SEALs never killed Osama bin Laden. There
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:19.280]  was no way they killed him. He was already dead. But Osama, what the Navy SEALs may have
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:25.520]  done was to attack some building near Pakistan. But in the process, here's what happened internationally.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:33.520]  We have alienated our ally Pakistan. We have created a civil war with the ISI, the Internal
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:38.640]  Service Intelligence System, which I knew about and worked with Yakub Khan against the civilian
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:43.200]  government of Pakistan, which we cannot control. And Obama the President does not know how
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:48.640]  to control it. Neither Hillary Clinton. We have created problems in Iran. We have allowed
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:54.280]  Israel to get out of control. We now have Turkey as a problem. We have Afghanistan as
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:24:01.120]  a problem. Now we have desecrated bodies. We have men who go out extensively to kill
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:07.960]  people. And now we have veterans coming back. We have been totally dysfunctional in Iraq.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:14.200]  We have had an army that now has to be put in question. They have lost wars and have
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:19.560]  created more deaths and casualties since World War II than any other institution that I
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:25.120]  know of. And I served in the military. I was a colonel in 32 and rejected the promotion
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:31.200]  to Brigadier because of the fact that I did not want to remain in a socialized system
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:36.120]  where everything was taken care of for you, your food, your uniform, and you didn't have
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.120]  to think.
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:41.960]  Now we have produced some of the smartest generals and some of the most dysfunctional generals
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:49.720]  I have ever seen. Cowardly, unable to assert themselves, and egregiously self-contained
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:53.880]  in terms of what they want for themselves. What we have now is what Eisenhower warned
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:59.040]  about. A military industrial complex where the civilians, our legislators, are totally
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:05.320]  held hostage to every desire that they want. We're now shifting from the army in Iraq and
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:11.440]  Afghanistan to a navy that we don't even need to go to war or have an economic war
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:16.600]  or poor structure outside of China along with Australia. So we're building up alliances
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:24.880]  with Vietnam, Cambodia, and Myanmar. Our military has to be downgraded. It has to be sequestered.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:29.280]  We cannot do it with Canada. We cannot do it with our legislators. We cannot do it with
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.280]  our system.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:34.200]  Well, Doctor, you know, sometimes we've got to get you on. You're here today talking
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:39.960]  about some of these issues that I agree with. We have people like the top White House financial
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:46.120]  advisor, John Corzine, openly stealing billions of dollars, caught lying, and still doesn't
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:51.880]  get in trouble making 40-to-1 bets. And I always thought that the New World Order crowd
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:56.320]  really had their act together. I know they're good at dominating us and running our lives,
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:00.280]  but they're not in control of themselves is, I think, the point you're getting at here.
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:06.440]  And I'm seeing a colligial-like craziness out of the elite right now. And I'm seeing
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:12.080]  the others that are awake scared stealing whatever they can and leaving the country.
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:19.400]  What's your take on that? Because I'm seeing a lot of really dangerous signs out of the
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.920]  power structure that they are just going completely crazy.
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:27.960]  Six months ago, I said on your show, John Corzine should have been in prison. He was
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:33.320]  the senator who bought the Senate, and he bought it for millions of dollars, 75 million.
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:39.920]  He went to become governor of New Jersey. He was corrupt. He was totally disliked.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:46.800]  He was corrupt there. And anybody who knew him at Goldman Sachs, where he was continuously
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:53.240]  an issue in terms of his abruptness, in terms of his incompetency, should know now that
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:58.560]  he is going, he was corrupt. That issue that he lost 1.3 billion and could not remember
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:03.280]  where the money was is going to be displaced on a poor woman by the name of Edmund O'Brien.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:09.040]  Edmund O'Brien, who was told by him that she should not have done it and she refused to
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:13.040]  sign something. So it's going to be seen out in the congressional hearings as to what
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:19.000]  happened. He has to go to jail. Blank fine of Goldman Sachs has to go to jail. A totally
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.800]  corrupt individual. Co-in of Goldman Sachs has to go to jail.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:31.360]  You got Jamie Dimon or JPMorgan Chase, another institution that has betrayed and has totally
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:36.760]  ripped this country repeatedly, has to go to jail. Warren Buffett has to be investigated
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:41.680]  for his involvement in the banking crisis. And instead, coming out with these Pontius
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:46.960]  righteous statements, you know, he's willing to pay taxes, he's willing to pay taxes, but
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:52.360]  he was willing to take Moody's and upgrade false securities, which he can do about.
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.720]  He owned 40% of Moody's when he told me about it.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:28:01.080]  Sure. Well, Dr. expanding on that here, you have Obama signing the NDA saying he'll disappear
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.760]  any citizens he wants. And I want you to break this down. You've got him taking out of the
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:14.440]  deep freeze, the war footing emergency COG powers from run or nuclear attack and saying
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:18.560]  he'll use it for any emergency or the threat of an emergency, including economic.
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:24.000]  I see federalization of police happening. I'm seeing all sorts of movements. I think
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.320]  the bankers think just like they thought they'd win a 40 to one bet at MF global that they're
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:34.200]  going to get away with this. But here's my point, doctor. They're selling 5 million guns
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:41.080]  a month right now. Everyone I know, liberal conservative is waking up and is saying, don't
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:46.440]  come push me around. And I think that this elite has really overplayed their hand. What's
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.440]  your view on that?
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:53.600]  Well, I think you're absolutely right. I think our political, economic and military and intelligence
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:59.440]  elite have failed. They have really disgraced this country. I think we're tired of it. I
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:03.600]  think it's time for the veterans to stand up for their rights when they come back and
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:08.840]  to state that they have fought for a country that really was not behind them. We have an
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.640]  army without a, we have an army without a country. We have a country that has wars without
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:20.240]  any dedication. And the issue is we have to have a system where these people go to prison.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:23.680]  The legislators could not do it. Cowards, they basically...
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:28.600]  Stay there. I want to hear how you think we can do it, Dr. Pachennick. I mean, can we
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:33.200]  get this republic back without violence? They're attacking peaceful protesters everywhere. They're
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:37.680]  arresting people, filming police. I mean, how do you get a country back from the clutches
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:42.560]  of a bunch of tyrants? The only good news is they are incompetent. They've got all this
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:47.840]  power. They've set up this takeover. But at the final equation, they are incompetent.
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:54.320]  It is true. They can be defeated. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:30:03.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:08.600]  of food I was eating. I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:13.360]  was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:19.880]  as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:23.840]  Now there are hundreds of great products at InfoWarsTeam.com, but I want to point out

[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:51.480]  with us in studio to do a review of the Hunger Games because this is what the globalist eugenicists
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:57.320]  want to build. You see this movie, this is what the sustainable development, smart growth
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:03.960]  people, their ultimate goal is lockdown cities, feudalism. They're showing you their dream.
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:08.680]  Jumbotrons with Janet Napolitano telling you watch their neighbors. Dr. Pacenek, you got
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:13.320]  cut off by the break. I mean, we sit here, we see classical tyranny being set up. We
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:17.240]  learned that 12 years ago, Bloomberg is now reported, they made deals with Prudential
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:22.800]  and others to take the death benefits of troops that have been paying in to get life insurance
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:28.920]  in the military. We learned that nine out of 10 reactors is leaking one way or the other
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:32.080]  just because they don't even care to repair them now because the elites will get bigger
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:38.880]  bonuses if they don't. We're seeing that same tropism of elites and you're a psychiatrist,
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:45.040]  perhaps you can describe it, where they become delusional. I mean, as I get more power, I
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:48.960]  try to be more careful and realize I have a bigger responsibility, not that I'm even
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:55.600]  some great person, but I understand just how transient life is and how delicate. But I see
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:59.680]  other people that get power more and more, not just in the elite, but in the general
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:06.760]  public, it's a delusional worldview. And I really see parallels to Rome slash Hitler
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:12.600]  in the bunker giving orders to armies that don't exist. I see the Indians deserting us
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:17.680]  now, the Pakistanis that were our buddies starting to do that. I see the whole world
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:21.400]  lining up and a lot of them are bad corrupt countries. I'm not a fan of what Russia's
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:27.480]  up to. All of this is going on. And I see them saying those secretly arrest us and the
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:34.120]  communist Chinese using the NDAA as political cover to pass their own. What do we do? I
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:38.680]  mean, because the government is gearing up for war with us and admitting it, and they
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:42.720]  think they're going to win and it's going to be like another core design 40 to one bet.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.360]  They're not going to win in my historical summation. Do you agree with that? Do you disagree?
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.400]  What are solutions? You've got the floor.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:55.120]  Well, solutions are very simple. We said it 10 years ago. We said it when 9-11 occurred.
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:00.240]  We said it when the lies and distortions occurred through this military industrial complex.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:06.840]  The military industrial complex has to be taken apart. Eisenhower said it in the 1950s.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:12.600]  That was his last speech. Great general, great president. We don't have anything like that.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:19.200]  So it comes back to the individual citizen who he, she doesn't matter, Republican, Democrat,
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:26.880]  Panthen, whatever the religion is, is to get on and start mandating and asking for representation
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:32.480]  and demanding from the congressmen and the legislators that if they can't indict the
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:38.520]  corrupt, they can indict the political elites. They can't demand that there be a reduction
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:43.760]  in the military industrial complex and they can't afford to stand forward. They're going
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:47.520]  to have to go forward. And one of the people who will go forward, one of the groups will
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:53.680]  be the veterans. I predict they'll be a recapitulation of what happened in the 1920s, after World
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:37:00.600]  War I, when the veterans were not given any benefits and they rioted on the Mall of Washington
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:05.240]  at D.C. because they were denied the benefits. And it was a general Douglas McCarthy who
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:12.160]  had to break it up along with a Colonel Eisenhower. I go to the veterans of this war, the Iraq
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:18.240]  war, the Afghanistan war, the African wars to say to them, you are now the leaders of
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:24.240]  a system that has failed you. You've offered your bravery, your honor, and now you should
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:31.040]  be forward. I say to the young people, it's now your turn to do an Arab Spring in America.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:36.560]  You use the Twitter. You use the social media. You take apart the various elements that are
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:44.000]  required in a peaceful way. The 99.1 movement was a disaster because it was not focused,
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.880]  it was not effective, and it had no real leadership or message. This is far greater than that.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:54.280]  You don't have any candidates or public officials who could represent your interests. I don't
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:58.880]  care whether it's Democrats, Republicans, and defend the wrong fall. Each one of them
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:04.120]  is corrupted. Each one of them has been in the system too long. We need term limits.
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:10.040]  We need an entire new government that has to be restructured. The benefits that have
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:16.200]  to be eviscerated in terms of the number of people decrease the federal budget marketably,
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:20.900]  bring back the powers to the states and to the local community, not just an issue of
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:28.360]  lowering the taxes. It's also a civil disobedience, refusing to pay taxes, refusing to consort
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:33.040]  with the banks, refusing to pay money into the banks, taking your money out of the banks.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:38.640]  Once you take your money out of the banks, I'm now in a federal violation by telling
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:44.040]  you this. They can't work because they can't extend their credits. Banks work by allowing
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:48.960]  them to give you money for the money you deposited. It's really your money, but they're going
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:54.840]  to tell you what to do with their money, with your money. You can Twitter, you can have
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:39:00.760]  an April spring, you can have a leadership with the veterans, you can coalesce together,
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:05.600]  but do not think you have a candidate out there. It's neither Ron Paul, it's neither
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:12.440]  Romney, it's certainly not Centurum, and it's not Obama. Those of you who think that you
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:19.120]  have a new country and a new republic, you're wrong. This is nothing more than a republic
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:25.080]  that is dysfunctional. It's very much what Alex has said. We no longer have a republic,
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:31.320]  but we have an empire. Exactly what happened to Rome. Our Centurum guards are the generals
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:39.240]  in Southcom, Socom, St. Pac, and Afrocom. These are all the generals who control the
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:45.080]  various areas and mandate that they need equipment that you don't need. Example, Hillary Clinton
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:51.960]  just gave aid back to the military generals who made a military coup in Egypt. Why? Not
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:58.000]  because it was necessary, it was part of AID, it was a humanitarian effort. She gave them
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:03.840]  back 3.2 billion because we don't have enough work for our workers who make tanks that we
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:10.400]  will never use, the M1 Abrams. So we have a system that is so corrupt, both domestically
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:15.920]  and internationally, that we must take it apart. There is no repair here. State department
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:21.120]  is not functional, AID is not functional, the presidency is out of control, you have
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:27.160]  more secret service guards protecting something for no reason whatsoever. You have TS agents
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:31.520]  that have no value whatsoever. I have Miami port here and other ports that are not even
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:38.000]  protected. I had a commander of the Coast Guard tell me he didn't have to worry about protection
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.600]  of the port. So what I was saying to you, this is a republic which needs the input of
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:50.520]  the young, the old, and the caring. You must go now literally online and create an Arab
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:56.640]  Spring and go forth and every one of your cities and towns, refuse the Patriots Act,
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:02.880]  refuse the TSA, take your money out of your bank, refuse to listen and pay the taxes that
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:08.800]  you require and take out the amount that's owed to war and ask how much goes to war.
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.760]  And see what happens when you practice the rights that you are bound with, the civil
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:20.760]  disobedience. It's Jefferson who said every generation must discover its own democracy.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:29.080]  Now we're in 2011 and 2012 and now we must do what we didn't do in 2001 when the government
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:34.160]  attacked you. It wasn't just Bush Jr., it was Clinton as well. And it wasn't just Clinton
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:39.680]  and Bush Jr., it was Obama as well propagating the lie and the next president will propagate
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:44.720]  the lie. And the next president will increase the military industrial complex. We do not
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:49.680]  need it. We do not need the stealth bombers. We do not need the carriers. We do not need
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:54.800]  even the jet plane. We have now one of the biggest problems which we haven't handled
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:59.400]  and we are overwhelmed with and that's cyber terrorism and cyber security. Fortunately,
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:03.520]  we have a general who's very effective on it but you don't hear about him but we're
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:09.760]  overwhelmed that Chinese are attacking us in terms of cyber security. We do have an economic
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:14.920]  problem in Europe but we're not there to fund them continuously with fake money and fake
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:21.480]  paper. So we have to build an industrial basis here where we can manufacture, not in China,
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:26.400]  not in India. We do not need to take over the Indian foreign policy because the Indians
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:31.800]  have fewer legislators and diplomats than New Zealand had. We don't have an interest
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.640]  around the world other than our own national security. Our own national security means
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.960]  America first and unless we can do that, we will lose our republic.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.880]  And Doc, that's the problem is that we have global financial interest that wrapped themselves
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:53.960]  in the flag and have now bought off our politicians and we saw that the Occupy Wall Street Movement
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:59.560]  was pushed by Soros. They made it a blank canvas of, hey, we're mad at corruption on
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:03.400]  Wall Street, which was good. Then they tried to get the biggest crowds they could out there
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:08.120]  to take control of it. But as soon as those crowds woke up to that and didn't want to
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:15.480]  be part of a fake preemptive uprising that was actually synthetic, then Obama ordered
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:21.240]  in more than 30 cities in one weekend, Homeland Security and a tent amendment violation to
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:27.200]  clear these people off the streets. And so they tried to trigger, because their actuaries
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:33.800]  show that real uprisings are coming, they tried to trigger preemptively a false one
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:38.760]  to then brand it that people are calling for socialism when they're not. But we do need
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:43.240]  people to stop complying more and more. We do need people to get really aggressive with
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:49.080]  banner hangs, talk radio, city council, and shout down the crooks in government because
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:55.560]  there's no doubt the system is moving preemptively with a classical authoritarian system to oppress
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:02.000]  us. And to the contrary, I see the oppression of the TSA and the rest of it actually being
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.960]  what's waking people up. So I think there's a miscalculation by the cowardly bureaucratic
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:11.800]  class, because they're looking at the world the way that they see it, they would be scared
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:17.960]  by this. Instead, I see people arming to the teeth, and I hope to avert a armed conflict.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:22.280]  But I would caution the establishment, because I've seen the memos that are public. The White
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:25.680]  House thinks we're so dumb, doctor, they openly talk about staging a new Oklahoma city like
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:30.960]  we don't read their own memos that are public. I caution them not to start the war, because
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:36.040]  once it starts and they start trying to arrest people, people won't have anything to do but
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:40.280]  fight back. And it's not like people are going to wait in their homes for the secret police
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.840]  to come get them. This is not going to be like Russia. Dr. Pachennik, your view in one
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:45.840]  minute comment on that.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.720]  I would agree with you. I think the notion that we have the Second Amendment, we're
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:55.240]  on, it's far more serious than anybody realized. This administration is dysfunctional. The
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:59.800]  Republic is dysfunctional. The only thing that is functional is the American citizens.
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:04.040]  We're not dummies. We're not stupid. We're not afraid. People ask me, aren't I afraid
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:08.600]  that I might be killed? The answer is no. I've been to battle, and I served for my country
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:13.240]  eight different times. I didn't ask for metal. I don't ask for promotion. I do ask my country
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:19.960]  to step forward once again and protest the corruption, the deceit, the lies, and the attacks
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:26.040]  that are coming on us and go forward as individuals and as Americans, irrespective of the background,
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:31.680]  your gender, your religion. You are the next generation. Let's take down the Republic and
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:34.400]  get rid of the Empire.
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.720]  So restore the Republic, get rid of the Empire.
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:46.440]  Get rid of the Empire. Get rid of this Republic and make it a real democracy. I want multiple
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:50.960]  parties. I don't want to hear about Republicans and Democrats where they trade off. That's
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:53.720]  nonsense. It didn't work for 200 years.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:59.520]  Well, we're not even following the Republic right now, and it's just a terrible situation.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:04.920]  I hear your frustration, but it shows that if they did do that whole Psyop, which I saw
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:11.520]  in the Washington Post, a bunch of the places, and it was government directed, that was clear.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:17.760]  They wouldn't have attacked us if it wasn't true and if it wasn't hurting them. And that's
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:22.360]  my greatest frustration is that I'm just one little guy, and I've had so much success
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:27.880]  standing up to these people. I wish other people realized that all that evil men need
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:34.680]  to triumph is that good men do nothing, as many of our founders said. And no army can
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:39.800]  stop an idea whose time has come. Now is the time to stand up. Now is the time to get involved.
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.400]  Dr. Pachinic, thank you so much for spending time with us today.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:45.680]  Thank you for the privilege of being in your show, and God bless the people.
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:52.640]  All right. Thank you so much for joining us. There goes Dr. Pachinic. Shifting gears into
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:59.840]  a very important subject, art imitates life. Life imitates art. And the main thing that
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:07.840]  the United States still produces is movies and art, books, comic books, literature, television
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:17.080]  shows. We're the big purveyor of it. And it's all laced with conditioning messages.
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:22.480]  Now in the last few months, I've had a lot of people say to me, Alex, what's all this
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:27.040]  hype with the Hunger Games? And I said, I don't know. I'm not reading fiction books
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:32.360]  right now. Don't have time for it. And then I saw some of the ads for the movie, had a
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:37.760]  chance to read the synopsis, had a chance to view the film. And Aaron had a chance to
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:47.160]  go last night and see it. And it completely blows me away. And Aaron was staggered at
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:54.240]  the end of the film last night because it's exactly what's in all the eugenics documents.
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:59.760]  It's exactly what's in the Biological Diversity Assessment, UN, Club of Rome. It is a super
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:06.720]  advanced technological society by a tiny technocratic elite who have rewilded 90 plus
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:11.920]  percent of the country. They have the nation broken into 12 regions, which we're 10 regions
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:17.800]  under FEMA. They have a monorail for the elite. Most of the public's been killed by an artificial
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:23.040]  collapse around 100 years before. And they play the different zones off against each
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:29.360]  other and organize society around ritualistic warfare, gladiatorial games. Now, in the UN
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:34.280]  Biological Diversity Assessment 96, they talk about gladiatorial games, bringing them back.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:38.400]  Human sacrifice. I cover that in endgame. They've expunged it off the UN website. We
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:42.400]  have a copy of it. They just have a synopsis. We're going to dig that back out by the way,
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:48.320]  Aaron. This is what is in all their literature. You got the Jumbotron thing, spy on your neighbors.
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:53.160]  It's feudalistic. If you get caught, you know, poaching something, you know, there's plenty
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:58.360]  of game. You get killed. It's the system they plan on setting up. Most people in compact
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:05.320]  cities, 90 plus percent population reduction, it goes right down the line. Amazing technology
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:10.800]  everywhere, but only for the elite, not for the general public. And the elite have a subclass
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:19.800]  that manages things who are profanely trendy and gibbering and and foppish and metrosexual.
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:23.120]  All of this is the plan. Now, Aaron, we're about to go to break. You got a minute and
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:28.040]  a half to give us a preview of your take on this. Aaron, you got it, Alex. And we've got
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:33.200]  so many of these movies. The reservoir is deep with these archetypal thematic movies
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:38.440]  that tell us about the system they're building and designing. And this one really hits home
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:44.880]  because it's, I think, 74 years in the future after the rebellion, which clearly seems to
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:50.640]  be this time. And those who fought back were punished with this game system where they
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:55.440]  take the children and put them into this gladiator. It's all about the state taking them. And again,
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:59.920]  there was a rebellion against the central government sometime before. And then 74 years
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:03.880]  have transpired since the game system was developed. Yes. And they have you in style.
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:08.160]  Peacekeepers, they call them peacekeepers in the film, and they monitor the different districts
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:13.120]  and they live in squalor and basic things, but they're spied upon under a high tech
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:18.560]  system. There's plenty of food, but they restrict the rations for the control of the population.
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:22.680]  And if you go for more food, they put your name in the bull moor. So you're more likely
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:31.240]  to be chosen for this likely death gladiatorial game. Total eugenics actual plan upon seeing
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:39.960]  this. It completely blows my mind that you see this film and this is what they've got
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:44.040]  planned. I mean, this is total predictive programming. It's sick and it's got the whole
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:49.720]  Wizard of Oz note at the top behind the curtain. There's the little society of trendies who
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:54.320]  serve the system, have the stylish haircuts, and they celebrate this game. And it's a great
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:58.560]  thing to bring in these little chosen people from the outer realms. Stay there. We'll be
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:06.120]  right back with the agenda 21 movie. Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:08.720]  essential for sustaining life, but it's not always the most available. When disaster strikes,
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:13.400]  water quickly vanishes from store shelves like it did during 9 11 Katrina, Japan and
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:17.440]  in Joplin. Three days without water and your body begins to shut down. Don't risk being
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:21.760]  without an abundant supply of water when the next disaster hits. Get a flowjack hand well
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:26.240]  pump. The affordable flowjack drops right into almost any well and is easy to install
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:30.480]  without having to remove the existing pump, giving you immediate access to plenty of cool,
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:34.220]  clean water. You could risk your family's health on a limited supply of stored water

[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:03.360]  Hey there, you've reached Claire. Leave me a message.
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:07.920]  Claire, it's Anne. Hey, you know that hormone balancing product we talked about before? The
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:12.840]  all-natural one. Ambron? Well, I gotta tell you this. Not only did Ambron stop my hot
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:18.760]  flashes, but since I started the Ambron program, I have lost so much weight. Seriously, even
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:24.320]  my belly fat, it's gone. I haven't been this thin in years. I feel great. Give me a call.
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:28.640]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance. Until you balance
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:33.640]  your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight. Ambron restores hormonal balance
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:39.160]  naturally so the weight can just fall off. Yes, even that stubborn belly fat plus Ambron
[01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:43.280]  eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too. So with your hormones in balance, you
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:48.080]  can feel great and finally lose the weight. Be one of the first 50 callers right now and

[01:53:55.200 --> 01:54:23.240]  That's 1-800-408-1130. Let's put on screen for TV viewers, the author of the Hunger Games
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:24.240]  show.
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:32.240]  And we do want to try to get her on air with us because I want to pick her brain, Suzanne
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:37.120]  Collins, and ask her if anybody approached her with this info. I mean, obviously they
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:42.240]  did or she's a listener of this show. And the fact that she wrote this novel four years
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:49.240]  ago, you know, the first one, and it is a Gen 21. So she's either a patriot and folks
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:53.240]  even mid-level in Hollywood don't know what they've brought forward or this is a mass
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:58.000]  conditioning program. Aaron, what do you make of this? Why do you think they've deployed
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.080]  this? Because they don't deploy anything big like this with this type of hype unless
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:03.520]  it's meant for a reason.
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:06.880]  The thing is that it's always a double-edged sword, Alex. I mean, even if it was written
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:10.720]  with the right intentions, most of the public watching this film has no clue what they're
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:15.040]  watching, just like all these other films. And it's subconsciously in the mind. And if
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:21.000]  you're not aware of what you're seeing, it does help them kind of hold you and get to
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  yourself.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.200]  That's right. If you're not conscious of it, it actually conditions you and acclimates
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:25.200]  you.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:28.720]  If you are conscious, you can just, as you're lounging in your chair, decode these things
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:29.960]  and start to put pieces together.
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:34.960]  And it's all about nanotech out of computers manifesting. So there's artificial intelligence,
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:40.560]  might even be running it. You've got genetically engineered wasp, fake artificial environments,
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:45.560]  fake skies that are so huge. Yeah, it was very gladiatorial, but also Truman Show, also
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:49.920]  running Man, where it's a manipulated reality with this game show. And the population's
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:53.920]  very kept. This is several generations into a kept population.
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:58.480]  It's to keep you focused on their corner of false reality because they can't rewrite the
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:03.600]  entire system. So it's about sucking you into the spectrum of their lives. And this lady's
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:08.880]  a television writer. So she's writing TV shows that are designed to suck you in. Man, I tell
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:09.880]  you, it's hardcore.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:13.200]  Man, I just heard about this movie yesterday. So I know nothing about the author, but, but
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:18.000]  in terms of the themes, it's the classic ritual sacrifice where they choose children from
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.880]  each district. But instead of rebelling against the fact that they're taking and basically
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:27.000]  sentencing to death, these children are competing cheer for it. And they hope for pride of their
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.960]  district and, and this and that's really what it is. People's sons get killed in the military
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:34.520]  and rather than get upset about it, they're really proud of it.
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:35.520]  Yeah.
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:39.280]  I mean, it's all a ritualistic sacrifice. It's really creepy, but they put a lot of things
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:44.040]  in your face, including the genetically modified creatures they had in this thing. And, and
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:48.440]  like you said, the nanotech creatures that were created on computers and instantaneously
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:52.600]  brought into the reality of this world where they're having the competition.
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:56.160]  Yeah, I'd only heard about it in the last few months, people mentioning it. And I saw
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:01.360]  a major hype and then you never heard of it till yesterday when you guys went to see
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:08.720]  it. I mean, I mean, overall, it's all there. This is Agenda 21. This is the rewilding.
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:15.200]  They talk about gladiatorial games, human sacrifice in Agenda 21, in the biological
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:19.440]  diversity assessment. I mean, this, this is what they want to build. And so I guess they
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:21.520]  had to make a movie about it.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:26.720]  It's just really creepy. And it's just like the film Zardos where it's the outlaying districts,
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:31.720]  the further most from the centralized planning government, where you kind of have that last
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:36.960]  vestige of the rebellion, even though they're programmed, you find those who finally resist
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:41.320]  coming from that area. And they still have a little bit of their humanity intact. They
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:45.000]  know how to hunt and run a trot line as the song goes.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.280]  And the country boy can't survive. So perhaps this Collins lady will put her back on screen.
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:51.360]  Maybe she's good.
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:56.240]  Again, I don't know anything about the author of these books. I did hear that the next book
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:00.360]  has to do with when they go back to their FEMA district, or if they don't call it FEMA,
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:04.920]  whatever they call it, it's basically a FEMA kept region. And they got the population
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:09.880]  divided and it's divided conquer once again, where they have ethnic groups in their own
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:14.280]  division and they're pitted against the other groups. And, and there's a lot of that kind
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:19.160]  of thing going on again, as you have the upper class who are into the trendiness and the
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:25.240]  foppishness and being in style and and buying into the pageantry of life.
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:31.360]  Exactly if the population would just realize that style and fads are all scientific systems
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:36.160]  to control you. Once you become aware of the manipulation, no matter how sophisticated
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:41.880]  it doesn't work anymore, we'll finish up and then go to Dr. Ben Fuchs, her pharmacist.

[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:39.720]  I worked with him on Scanner Darkly. And I've talked to him a few times, but never really
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:44.360]  twist his arm into coming on. But we're close to getting him on. He's just shooting another
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:48.000]  film right now.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:52.640]  I'm just blown away by this. I want people to understand this is the type of stuff that
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:58.160]  the globalists are trying to set up. Districts are poor working class. It's like a time warp.
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:03.520]  Each district is fenced. Dirt roads, people are hungry. They live off squirrel meat. And
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:08.760]  of course, if they catch you poaching, then you get in trouble. I mean, this is the complete
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:14.200]  system. The globalists want to go back to an agrarian feudalistic system with controlled
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:20.160]  compact science cities. This just blows me away, Aaron. I keep saying, I'm blown away.
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:25.920]  They made a movie about what they're planning based around running man game shows with technology
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:31.720]  projected into our areas where we're wearing loincloths. How many times have I said that?
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:34.720]  That's their plan. And then now they've made a movie about it. And people think they're
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:38.240]  seeing fiction when this is actually a blueprint of madmen.
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:44.040]  Yeah, they have rustic 1900 style societies, and then they have spaceship type crafts floating
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:48.960]  over to monitor the population. So that gives you an idea of the technological separation.
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:53.680]  But all the writings show a bifurcation, a separation, two classes, you know, a super
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.600]  rich and a super poor. And the super poor, of course, is the great mass of everybody.
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:02.960]  And all they are are the small amount that they allowed to live after they killed 90
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:07.800]  plus percent to toy with us. It's just because they enjoy still torturing us. They're going
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:09.360]  to keep some of us, they say.
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:13.120]  But I know you already justified why I talk about a fiction film, but I don't watch much
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:16.880]  TV anymore. So these kind of films, well, you have to talk about it. It's a brainwashing
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:21.920]  system makes an impact on me. But these things carry real themes. I mean, we said you better
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:26.440]  stick to reality. Well, it's full of fiction and reality. Anyway, look at the Obama Obama
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:30.400]  bin Laden narrative we just talked about, and no, they're already blurring the lines.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:34.880]  Look at how this Trayvon Martin thing is a production, whether it was wrong or not,
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:39.920]  whether he was murdered or not. The point is the media decides to push this now. Why?
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:44.160]  They wag the dog. But on the point of food, they have so much excess food, they throw
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:47.960]  it to the pigs, they throw it in the dirt, but you can't have any because you're under
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:51.960]  this ration system. You're being kept by the peacekeepers.
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:57.800]  And that's the carbon tax model they're actually calling for rationing. We ought to do a whole
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:01.640]  review of it and just piece by piece, talk about it and show how that's the real plan.
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:06.080]  But most amazing part of this movie, if you're one of the chosen sacrifices who's reaped
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:11.120]  from the crowd, that's your only glory in life is that you get taken to the golden city,
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:15.840]  that you have a chance to shine one more time as you burn up in death, improbable death.
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:21.000]  Because for those who don't know the scenario, they bring 24 children and only one can survive.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.080]  The others have to kill each other. And that's the point of the gladiatorial sport here.
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:26.080]  It's a...
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:32.160]  Instead, the ritual high priest psychopath class in every culture manifests the same design
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:38.080]  they want your kids. Right now, the TSA is just wanting their genitals, and mommy and
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:41.600]  daddy are taught, the men in uniforms with the little pot bellies with the spit dripping
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:46.600]  out from their lips, they're going to grab your genitals now. And people do it and you're
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:52.000]  going to take the cancer virus shot. We're already in it. We're already in a total control
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.440]  grid and it's about to get a lot crazier. Speaking of that, we're going to have the
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:04:00.360]  Prometheus review, sneak peek, we have the inside scoop, secrets of Prometheus. That's
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:05.520]  going to be out, what, Thursday, Aaron? Yeah. I ended up doing an hour of voiceover for
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:08.600]  a 10 minute clip. It was pretty intense, but we're going to get it done.
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:13.880]  All right. You got your work cut out for you. We'll be exposing that Thursday.
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:17.760]  But I just can't tell you how creepy it is that they have a multi-generational ritual
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:22.400]  sacrifice for the fact that the population dared to rebel against the controllers. That's
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:25.800]  really at the heart. But that's what they really do. Governments get together in many
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:30.360]  cases in history, like the French and the British, and would have wars between cousins.
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:35.200]  Because on having uprising, so am I. Let's start a war. I mean, that's what they do.
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:39.440]  They put the fluoride in our water because we're free Americans and we're the best. They're
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:42.360]  teaching us. But Alex, you represent history. History
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:47.080]  sees what's really going on. It's us in the now who are deceived, the general population,
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:51.600]  and that's who it's aimed at telling us, don't fight back against the system. So let's say
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:54.920]  yesterday we talked about the natives getting restless, the populace. No, that's it. The
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:59.520]  message is you fight back, you die. We the elite are gods above you. That's the message
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:03.840]  of the film. A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot
[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:08.640]  of research into why, even if I had a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:13.440]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:17.600]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:23.160]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:29.040]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:33.960]  and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:38.400]  designed to give you the real nutrition you need. And once you've got that, you don't
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:44.960]  have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:50.920]  the vitamins and minerals I need. Check it out for yourself. It's incredible. Go to infowarseteam.com

[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:07.760]  you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could
[02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:12.240]  easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are, wants to
[02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:17.120]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:22.160]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:26.960]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist
[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:31.700]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a
[02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:36.120]  threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:39.200]  onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:43.280]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:47.440]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more

[02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:06.680]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[02:07:06.680 --> 02:07:12.040]  opportunity, and recognized risk. Saving means to make money. The Calben Pure Soap Company
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:16.360]  can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:21.400]  triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now. Soaps made from vegetable
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:27.720]  and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials. Your
[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:33.400]  risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and a
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:37.560]  deteriorating clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want something
[02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:41.040]  you've never had before, you've had to do something you've never done before. Getting

[02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:09.480]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:38.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:10:08.440]  You can find the city hall, death and taxes. Don't talk about politics or religion. This
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:14.400]  is all in the middle of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line. Lay down GI, lay down
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:19.060]  GI. We saw it all through the 20th century and now in the 21st century it's time to
[02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:23.840]  stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:28.560]  We should not submit to dehumanization. I don't know about you but I'm concerned with
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:32.720]  what's happening in this world. I'm concerned with the structure. I'm concerned with the
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:38.600]  systems of control. Those that control my life and those that seek to control even more.
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:41.920]  I want freedom. That's what I want and that's what you should want.
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:46.120]  It's up to each and every one of us to turn this into just some of the breathing, the
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:50.920]  hatred, the envy and yes, the insecurities because that is the central mode of control.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:57.080]  Make us feel pathetic, small so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:03.640]  destiny. We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale. Start challenging
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:08.640]  this corporate slave state. The 21st century is going to be a new century. Not the century
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:14.640]  of slavery, not the century of lies and even the notion of giving it a classism, statism
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:19.440]  and all the rest of modes of control. It's going to be the age of humankind standing
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:24.440]  up for something pure and something right. What a bunch of garbage, liberal, democratic,
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:29.440]  conservative, republican. It's all there to control you, two sides of the same coin.
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:35.440]  Two management teams getting for control. The CEO job of slavery incorporated. The truth
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:39.440]  is out there in front of you. If they lay out this buffet of lies, I'm sick of it and
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:42.440]  I'm not going to take a bite out of it. Do you got me?
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:50.440]  Human kind is too good. We're not a bunch of underachievers. We're going to stand up
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:55.440]  and we're going to be human beings. We're going to fire on the real things. The things that
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:12:01.440]  matter. Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit. Well, that's it. That's
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:06.440]  all I've got to say. It's in your coin.
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:14.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back. Pharmacist Ben Fuchs is going to be joining
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:18.440]  us for the balance of the hour here in just one moment. And Aaron's going to continue
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:23.440]  to ride shotgun with us. But finishing up Aaron with the Hunger Games, I think you hit on
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:28.440]  the heart of it. It's the idea that there's an advanced civilization. There's advanced
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:34.440]  technology. The general public is kept at a primitive level so they can't challenge it.
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:39.440]  And the elite have these glistening secret high tech cities, life extension, genetic
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:44.440]  engineering, nanotech, with floating UN peacekeepers above them just so they can toy with
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:50.440]  humanity. The elite want to basically live as gods on a Mount Olympus, but still keep
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:56.440]  humans there to toy with us because they're psychopaths and enjoy the ritualistic dominating
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:13:01.440]  humanity over and over and over again. And there's a debate within the elite, many other
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:07.440]  publications on whether they will keep some of us to toy with or whether they're going to
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:12.440]  just basically exterminate 99%. And we've gone over those quotes and documents. Aaron,
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:16.440]  comment on that. And I'm glad you said Olympians. Of course, this stuff is archetypal because
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:21.440]  there's thousands of movies you could pull it from. But as the games go on, as the children
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:27.440]  chosen from these districts are made to compete for their lives gladiatorily in this matrix
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:34.440]  system, Truman Show type system, you've got the Olympians who run the inner city directing
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:39.440]  things, keeping tracks of charts and they have little tracker chips in the arms and another
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:45.440]  nod to RFID and they monitor the whole grid, add new factors in. It's very Mount Olympus.
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:49.440]  It reminds me. Oh, exactly. They have tracker chips in them. And I saw an MSNBC article
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:54.440]  today, Aaron, where they're announcing the school uniforms are all going to have RFID now.
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:59.440]  It's so creepy. But remember the movie Jason and the Argonauts where the Olympians, the gods
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:04.440]  are bored. They're bored with life. The only thing they care about is that little chess piece
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:09.440]  on the board. Was it Jason or was it one of those other Greek myth movies where because
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:13.440]  he's in the fight because he's fighting back against the system because he doesn't accept
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:17.440]  what the gods have decreed for. Well, sure. That's class of the Titans, all of it. They're
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:22.440]  super interested in that person, the one who's fighting back. And you see that in this film, too.
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:27.440]  It's just so pathetic that the elite can do this because they're not elite. They're a bunch of scum.
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:32.440]  They're like cancer. They're willing to do bad things. So they believe that's their social Darwinian,
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:36.440]  you know, social Darwinistic right to do that to everybody.
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:41.440]  Yeah. And then a sub-factor of the gladiatorial contest, they always have the professional gladiators
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:45.440]  who've been training for their whole lives and they almost always win the contest. And I've seen
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:49.440]  other movies where this is a theme, too, where even though you're brought in to fight for your life,
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:53.440]  you really don't have a real shot at winning. You're really just meant to die because they want
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:58.440]  you to know you're dominated. But you have a chance.
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:04.440]  But it's still their system. So it's about making you feel helpless because you're not helpless.
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:09.440]  And we're exposing the real secret, the deep secret of the Hunger Games here today.
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:14.440]  Now, shifting gears, I want you to stay here, Aaron, because I wasn't going to keep Aaron over into this hour
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:20.440]  and he's got a lot of work to do. But Aaron's like, by the way, Alex, your goal is to go to 180.
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:26.440]  And I've lost now right at 40 pounds. I lost 37 that went out of town for two weeks, stopped working out,
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:30.440]  stopped doing all the tangy tangerine, ate a little bit too much, stopped losing weight,
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:34.440]  got back on it a few weeks ago, lost another two pounds just now, starting to accelerate that.
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:40.440]  And again, it's not even sold or promoted here as a weight loss thing. Just that the food is so depleted,
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:44.440]  the soil that the food's grown in is so depleted, that when you actually get the real minerals
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:50.440]  and trace elements, you start not being as hungry. But Aaron, you're one pound from your goal.
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:53.440]  How much weight have you lost?
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:56.440]  I believe it's about 85 pounds now.
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:59.440]  85 pounds. Can we get a wider shot on that digital camera?
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:05.440]  I mean, the thing is, I wasn't motivated to weigh myself at the top point there, so I'll never know for sure.
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:11.440]  Yeah, but we'll give folks a wide shot of you, but you now have one pound to lose?
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:14.440]  It's two, actually. I don't want to exaggerate.
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:17.440]  Okay, I thought you said 181. It's 182.
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:21.440]  I'm very close, though. I've continued to lose weight. I think the last time we were on with Ben Fuchs,
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:26.440]  it was about 210 or 215 or so, and I was already feeling good then.
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:31.440]  Well, to give you an idea how big I've been, I've lost 40 pounds, and I've still got some weight to lose.
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:35.440]  When I sit down, it looks like I have a belly, but my wife, when I get out of the shower, she's like,
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:40.440]  whoa, I'm starting to get like a six pack. I mean, the guns are coming back.
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:44.440]  But listen, I went off tangy tangerine, and yeah, I'm pitching this and promoting it, folks.
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:46.440]  I'm only promoting what I believe in here.
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:51.440]  I basically started doing it like once a day and quit working out and was on the road.
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:55.440]  So I'd go to steakhouses and Mexican food restaurants and, you know, kind of pig out with the kids and stuff
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:58.440]  and work late and things and, you know, drink beer.
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:02.440]  So I didn't gain weight back. I just stopped losing it.
[02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:07.440]  But then when I got back, I've never been in the habit of taking vitamin and mineral drinks.
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:11.440]  So I kind of started forgetting to do it again because I wasn't really hungry in the morning
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:16.440]  because I was just going for regular food and I suddenly, I couldn't run eight miles.
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:19.440]  I was running like four or five miles and I said, oh my gosh, I got to get back on tangy tangerine.
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:22.440]  I got to get back on pollen burst. I got to get back on all this.
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:24.440]  My wife's like, come on and boom.
[02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:28.440]  Within a week of getting back on it, I'm able to run eight miles in the morning.
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:33.440]  In fact, this morning I had about seven. I had to go and I had to quit.
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:37.440]  I was just ready to keep running off into the sunset because of this.
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:41.440]  I went to NFOlwarsTeam.com, just up front telling you about this and then we're going to get into
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:46.440]  just regular health things you can do, exercises, breathing, that pharmacist has been fusing,
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:50.440]  has been putting out there that is really successful and really works well.
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:54.440]  And again, none of this is a secret. The globalists don't want you to know this,
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:59.440]  but I'm telling you, the word about young jevity and the fact that folks can sign up at NFOlwarsTeam.com
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:04.440]  and get discounts and you can also, over $50 orders, go and get free shipping when you sign up for auto-ship.
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:09.840]  There's also a phone number there if you want to call and order products that way.
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:16.280]  But my mother, who's been a master swimmer and totally into health, couldn't lose weight.
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:18.800]  She is not reclusive, but doesn't like media.
[02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:21.080]  She sings, she might come out and endorse it.
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:22.960]  She's lost like, looks like 25, 30 pounds.
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:25.040]  She's able to swim, run further.
[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:32.000]  I mean, this stuff is magic, but all it is, is it's not synthetic vitamins, it's natural
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:33.000]  vitamins.
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:36.520]  We're going to go to break, but I want to bring Ben Fuchs in here as we go to break.
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:41.680]  What is happening, pharmacist Ben Fuchs, when people start taking a tangy tangerine?
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:47.400]  Hey Alex, and hey Aaron, what's happening is your body is beginning to work like it's
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:49.000]  supposed to work.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:50.960]  Your body's supposed to work a certain way.
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:55.120]  If you don't give it what it needs, every bit as much as if you don't give your car gasoline
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:56.920]  and oil, it's not going to work the way it is.
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:02.320]  When you see weight gain, what you're seeing is the visible evidence of a body that's not
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:03.320]  working correctly.
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:07.840]  When you see weight loss, you're seeing the visible evidence of a body that is beginning
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:08.840]  to work correctly.
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:10.840]  It's as simple as that.
[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:16.280]  Well, we're going to go to break, and when we come back, I want to get into the basics
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:21.120]  of the biomechanical system of the body, and the fact that the controllers know we need
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:24.840]  these building blocks, and it's not an accident that they don't just take the building blocks
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:30.440]  out of the food, but they also, as you know, then add all of these additives in that are
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:36.600]  really drugs and toxic chemicals to totally debilitate us and then chop us up later, never
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:42.320]  telling us that they gave us the binary weapons systems that actually created this effect.
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:49.840]  Ben Fuchs is a registered pharmacist, nutritionist, cosmetic chemist, and founder of a COMP pharmacy
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:51.360]  in Rocky Mountain Natural Laboratories.

[02:19:56.280 --> 02:19:57.280]  Stay with us.
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:04.280]  We'll be right back with him and Aaron Dykes on the other side.

[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:17.320]  I've lost right at 40 pounds.
[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:24.040]  Aaron has lost 80 plus, absolutely incredible, and he didn't do it by dieting.
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:29.720]  Aaron had dieted off and on for years, exercised, went to the gym every day, but once you put
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:34.880]  the weight on, it's really hard and your stomach hurts, you want to eat, because even if you're
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:39.760]  quote eating healthy stuff, it doesn't have the vitamins and minerals, and so yes, I'm
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:41.400]  promoting InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:45.440]  I've scoured the world, come up with the best company to promote, and I hope that you'll
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:51.480]  go there and get the products at InfoWarsTeam.com, because again, a year and a half ago, I was
[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:55.160]  talked into trying this stuff, I didn't try it because I know vitamins and minerals are
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:57.800]  important, but I just never got into it.
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:05.000]  Then family started using it, then Aaron started using it, and I started seeing dramatic, dramatic,
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:08.280]  dramatic, dramatic, and just a spoon if I can get one, thanks.
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:11.960]  I'm going to have some pollen burst here on there, because I normally do this time of
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:19.000]  the day instead of just having a coffee, because I notice that doesn't work as well as a pollen
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  burst.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  I'm going to have one of those on air.
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.440]  Normally I would have done it during the break privately, but I'm going to do it right
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:24.440]  here on air.
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:29.680]  This is a short segment, going back to Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, Ben, explain to people again what's
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:34.800]  happening here, and crystallize, if you had 3 million people listening to you, say on
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:38.920]  national television, which you do right now on radio and TV, what would you say to them
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:43.960]  about what's happening, because this is revolutionary, and the other vitamin companies and people
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:46.160]  aren't even advertising this fact?
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:50.960]  What's happening is we are looking for nutrition, and for eons, we got calories and nutrition
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:51.960]  together.
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:56.200]  So when we go out, when the body has a drive for calories, and you feel hungry, the body's
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:58.840]  expecting to get nutrition with those calories.
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:03.200]  It's only been the last 150, 200 years that we figured out how to process food to the
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:07.720]  extent that we could deliver calories without nutrition, and today, if you go out and you
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:08.720]  look for food.
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:09.720]  If you go for fast food.
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:12.960]  If you go to the supermarket and get your food, you're going to get lots of calories
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:16.080]  and you're not going to get nutrition, so you're going to eat the calories, and your
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:19.220]  body's going to say, Hey, where's my nutrients?
[02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:23.200]  Go out and get some more calories and you're going to go out and get some more calories.
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:26.200]  And your body's going to say, Hey, where's my nutrients?
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:29.900]  Let's get some more calories and you end up with this vicious cycle of the body looking
[02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:34.280]  for nutrients, you delivering the calories, the body expecting nutrients, not getting
[02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:37.100]  it and sending you out on a hunt for more calories.
[02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:40.940]  When you give yourself these nutrients, not only do you get nutrients, but you get them
[02:26:40.940 --> 02:26:43.300]  in an easy to absorb fashion.
[02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:49.220]  So you get them quickly, so the body gets its hit of nutrients and it's satisfied.
[02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:54.020]  And you don't feel like going out and getting more calories and that's how people lose
[02:26:54.020 --> 02:26:55.020]  weight.
[02:26:55.020 --> 02:26:57.820]  And the beautiful thing about this thing, Alex, is it happens quickly.
[02:26:57.820 --> 02:27:02.180]  Now, I never even talked about this stuff as weight loss, but when I started to see
[02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:06.460]  what was happening and I started to see that people are really focused on weight loss,
[02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:09.860]  I was like, we got to explain how this thing is happening.
[02:27:09.860 --> 02:27:11.620]  Why are people losing weight?
[02:27:11.620 --> 02:27:16.180]  You're losing weight because you're not feeling the need to intake as much calories because
[02:27:16.180 --> 02:27:18.140]  you're meeting your nutritional needs.
[02:27:18.140 --> 02:27:22.180]  But the good news is, the beautiful thing is not only are you losing weight, you're protecting
[02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:26.780]  your heart, you're building your immune system, you're delivering better brain health, you're
[02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:28.500]  improving your digestive system.
[02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:33.540]  In short, not only are you losing weight, but you're getting improvements in every single
[02:27:33.540 --> 02:27:39.860]  health marker because Alex, the body runs on nutrients, every bit as much as your car
[02:27:39.860 --> 02:27:43.980]  runs on oil and gasoline, your body runs on vitamins and minerals.
[02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:48.100]  When you get yourself on a nutritional supplement program like the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, the
[02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:52.500]  Ultimate EFA's, the Osteo FX, all the things that you get in the Alex pack, one of the
[02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:57.300]  first things you notice is you're satisfied without having to eat as much calories and
[02:27:57.300 --> 02:27:59.700]  that's exactly what you're talking about.
[02:27:59.700 --> 02:28:03.700]  I'm also noticing that my skin is healthier.
[02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:04.700]  Well let me tell you about the skin.
[02:28:04.700 --> 02:28:10.180]  You know, I've been in the skin care business for many years and there is no way that you
[02:28:10.180 --> 02:28:15.780]  could find a skin care product that can have as much benefit for your skin as a nutritional
[02:28:15.780 --> 02:28:16.780]  supplement program.
[02:28:16.780 --> 02:28:20.980]  The beautiful thing about skin health is the skin turns over faster than any other tissue
[02:28:20.980 --> 02:28:22.060]  in the body.
[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:29.020]  So if you have acne, rosacea, eczema, psoriasis, any kind of skin condition, because of how
[02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:33.860]  fast the skin turns over, every four to eight weeks you have new skin cells, because of
[02:28:33.860 --> 02:28:39.380]  how fast the skin turns over, you can notice results, skin results in a quicker fashion
[02:28:39.380 --> 02:28:41.660]  than any other system in the body.
[02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:44.860]  And let me tell you something, people really, really care about their skin, but when you
[02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:48.980]  see that your acne or your rosacea or your eczema disappear, what you're really seeing
[02:28:48.980 --> 02:28:53.780]  is the visible evidence that the biochemistry inside the body is changing.
[02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:59.540]  So not only is your eczema an acne and psoriasis and whatever your skin condition improving,
[02:28:59.540 --> 02:29:03.140]  but you're decreasing the likelihood of heart disease further on down the road.
[02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:07.840]  You're decreasing the likelihood of cancer and other degenerative health issues further
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:09.300]  on down the road.
[02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:14.380]  So not only do you have improvement in the visible markers, the weight loss, the appearance,
[02:29:14.380 --> 02:29:19.980]  the skin health, but you can use that as evidence that you are actually creating changes inside
[02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:23.980]  the body that are reducing your risk of degenerative diseases down the road.
[02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:28.180]  When we come back, I want to talk about the U.N. movements and movements in the U.S. that
[02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:35.820]  are the most destructive and serious we've ever seen, trying to shut down vitamin C even
[02:29:35.820 --> 02:29:37.580]  in large dosages.
[02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:41.380]  They're really wanting to only let you have a tiny amount, and then Big Pharma is trying
[02:29:41.380 --> 02:29:45.660]  to patent all this, even fish oil, and make you pay thousands of dollars for something
[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:48.660]  that would cost a few, you know, dollars.
[02:29:48.660 --> 02:29:50.900]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:29:50.900 --> 02:29:54.660]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.660 --> 02:30:21.980]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:21.980 --> 02:30:48.380]  Now
[02:30:48.380 --> 02:31:02.300]  we're getting started.
[02:31:02.300 --> 02:31:03.300]  Hi folks.
[02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:04.300]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:31:04.300 --> 02:31:08.660]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized
[02:31:08.660 --> 02:31:09.660]  risk.
[02:31:09.660 --> 02:31:10.900]  Saving means to make money.
[02:31:10.900 --> 02:31:15.140]  The CalBent Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:19.060]  fashion real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what
[02:31:19.060 --> 02:31:23.900]  you're using now. Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no
[02:31:23.900 --> 02:31:29.180]  useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials. Your risk is the hundreds
[02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:33.820]  of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and a
[02:31:33.820 --> 02:31:37.500]  terror-aiding clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want
[02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:40.460]  something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done
[02:31:40.460 --> 02:31:46.900]  before. Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on

[02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:06.380]  ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size
[02:32:06.380 --> 02:32:10.340]  meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:14.420]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:18.380]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:23.260]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[02:32:23.260 --> 02:32:27.620]  themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy. I then searched out the best
[02:32:27.620 --> 02:32:32.420]  vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young

[02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:25.780]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs is our guest writing Shotgun with us is Aaron Dykes. If
[02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:29.900]  you're listening on radio you really should go up to PrisonPlanet.tv and
[02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:35.580]  watch Aaron right now because Aaron has lost 80 plus pounds. Just to be clear
[02:33:35.580 --> 02:33:40.660]  Aaron, I mean you were working out almost every day, you were dieting. Well I've
[02:33:40.660 --> 02:33:44.260]  watched you in the office down the hall go through this last few years.
[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:48.860]  Describe to people what happened once you started listening to Pharmacist Ben
[02:33:48.860 --> 02:33:52.580]  Fuchs and the other guests we have on the show. Describe that transformation for
[02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:56.620]  radio listeners who can't see you right now. Look first of all just being part of
[02:33:56.620 --> 02:33:59.500]  this larger waking up to the New World Order. I don't want to be part of the
[02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:04.260]  system. I'm trying to step by step detach myself from the things they've got me
[02:34:04.260 --> 02:34:08.940]  hooked with all throughout life and that means television, that means these
[02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:14.180]  Fortune 500 food companies and all the other junk they got us into and I don't
[02:34:14.180 --> 02:34:17.500]  want to be a part of it. But they love you. I've been motivated for years but it
[02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:21.260]  just wasn't working. I was working out hard and I just wasn't losing the
[02:34:21.260 --> 02:34:26.340]  weight. But then it was a perfect storm. Ben Fuchs came on the air. I've heard
[02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:31.580]  about these vitamins. I decided to try them and it just started working. You
[02:34:31.580 --> 02:34:35.020]  did what you'd always been doing, eating healthy food, exercising but
[02:34:35.020 --> 02:34:38.300]  something started happening. You started losing weight. So how long is it taking
[02:34:38.300 --> 02:34:44.300]  you to lose what 80 plus pounds? I really started hitting it hard back in June but
[02:34:44.300 --> 02:34:49.980]  I started taking the vitamins in about May or April of last year and it's you
[02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:55.020]  know it's 80 plus. It may well be 90. So in a year you've lost over 80 pounds.
[02:34:55.020 --> 02:34:59.700]  Folks again, this is one of the easiest things I've done too. I mean I really
[02:34:59.700 --> 02:35:03.260]  enjoy exercising now whereas before it was definitely a chore. It was something
[02:35:03.260 --> 02:35:08.340]  I had to make myself do. Now I really kind of look forward to it. Folks again,
[02:35:08.340 --> 02:35:11.300]  I'll promote what I believe in and your purchase also supports the
[02:35:11.300 --> 02:35:14.180]  broadcast and helps the news organization. That's why every few weeks you
[02:35:14.180 --> 02:35:18.340]  know we we have a plug for young Jevity and the Tangy Tangerine, Rebound,
[02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:23.540]  Polymburst, Cell Shield, all of it available at infowarsteam.com. There's
[02:35:23.540 --> 02:35:30.100]  banners linking to it at infowars.com. But if you try this, it's miraculous and
[02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:34.060]  you know I've talked to people like Dr. Blalock and he talks about the fact that
[02:35:34.060 --> 02:35:39.300]  essential fatty acids, coconut oil for people with Alzheimer's and the system
[02:35:39.300 --> 02:35:43.060]  knows this but they won't tell them. I hate to talk about this but Ted's giving
[02:35:43.060 --> 02:35:47.420]  me authorization. He wants to save others. Ted Anderson's dad got Alzheimer's so
[02:35:47.420 --> 02:35:50.780]  bad he couldn't even take him fishing anymore. Got him on Tangy Tangerine for
[02:35:50.780 --> 02:35:54.540]  six months, knew who he was, started getting his memory back. He was, I mean
[02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:58.660]  it was dramatic. Ted was gonna have to have surgery on his knee, doesn't need it
[02:35:58.660 --> 02:36:02.900]  anymore because he's taking the osteo FX and all that and it was so
[02:36:02.900 --> 02:36:07.980]  incredible that then his dad went and got his blood tested and they said well
[02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:13.860]  your vitamin K is too high and told him don't take the Tangy Tangerine anymore
[02:36:13.860 --> 02:36:18.820]  because it has vitamin K and don't eat leafy vegetables. Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, I
[02:36:18.820 --> 02:36:22.780]  then went and searched that online and found out that's standard. He's never
[02:36:22.780 --> 02:36:26.780]  even had a stroke. They just say you're gonna go on Cumin and blood thinner and
[02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:32.180]  you can't be on vitamin K now and so you can't have leafy vegetables. I mean the
[02:36:32.180 --> 02:36:37.940]  doctors saying no Brussels sprouts here, you know, no spinach Popeye. I mean and
[02:36:37.940 --> 02:36:42.220]  we're the extremists. I guess I'm with Al Qaeda Ben. That's the extent
[02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:45.980]  that the medical model has gotten to, that's how deep the medical model has
[02:36:45.980 --> 02:36:50.100]  gotten into pharmacological therapy. This idea that you have to get off your
[02:36:50.100 --> 02:36:54.220]  nutrients so the drugs can do their work. I mean if you just sit about thick and
[02:36:54.220 --> 02:36:56.940]  sit and think about it for a couple seconds, it's ludicrous, right? No
[02:36:56.940 --> 02:37:01.060]  Brussels sprouts, no broccoli, so you're Coumadin which is rat poison works. But
[02:37:01.060 --> 02:37:05.140]  that's the extent, not only that the medical model, that's not only is that
[02:37:05.140 --> 02:37:08.700]  how deep the medical model has gone into this this idea that we can drug
[02:37:08.700 --> 02:37:13.140]  ourselves to health. But that's the extent of the hypnotic trance that we
[02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:18.860]  are under that gives the authority to the man in the white coat. We trust the
[02:37:18.860 --> 02:37:23.220]  doctors so much that we're willing to not eat green leafy vegetables which
[02:37:23.220 --> 02:37:26.980]  everybody knows are important for all markers of health because we're scared.
[02:37:26.980 --> 02:37:30.780]  We've been led to believe that if we don't take the Coumadin or we don't
[02:37:30.780 --> 02:37:33.660]  take the statin drugs or we don't take the prescription medicine something's
[02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:39.180]  going to happen to us. It's a hypnotic trance of the of the most incredible
[02:37:39.180 --> 02:37:43.380]  degree to the highest degree and what happens is once you start on a
[02:37:43.380 --> 02:37:47.580]  nutritional supplement program you notice oh my god I'm feeling better oh
[02:37:47.580 --> 02:37:51.460]  my god I'm losing weight oh my god I'm not as hungry anymore and you wake up out
[02:37:51.460 --> 02:37:56.660]  of the trance and like Alex said or like Aaron said we should be focusing on
[02:37:56.660 --> 02:38:02.580]  building our bodies up without having to interface with the control model with
[02:38:02.580 --> 02:38:06.180]  the the medical tyranny with the corporate tyranny that doesn't care
[02:38:06.180 --> 02:38:11.460]  about you or your family this is about taking the control back this is about
[02:38:11.460 --> 02:38:16.020]  taking the power back this is about putting the ball into our own court the
[02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:21.300]  health ball into our own court your body is a miracle the healing power of the
[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:26.900]  human body is one of the most amazing phenomena in all of life the ability the
[02:38:26.900 --> 02:38:31.900]  body has to regenerate itself to heal itself even at the age of 90 you can
[02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:35.420]  begin to build muscle you can begin to build tissue no matter what your health
[02:38:35.420 --> 02:38:39.420]  crisis is once you start to get yourself on a good nutritional supplement
[02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:43.740]  program once you start to correct your diet and eat eat the right foods and
[02:38:43.740 --> 02:38:48.580]  not eat the corporate swill you will notice health changes and biological
[02:38:48.580 --> 02:38:53.020]  changes that will seem like a miracle listen I did a fire ant video the other
[02:38:53.020 --> 02:38:58.420]  day to compare the fact that with a soft-kill weapon like the globalist put
[02:38:58.420 --> 02:39:03.820]  the GMO the vaccines the aspartame the rest of it that if you frontal assault
[02:39:03.820 --> 02:39:08.020]  poke an ant bed a fire ant bed where they pin they'll swarm out and attack you
[02:39:08.020 --> 02:39:11.820]  but if you give them amdro that looks and smells like food but has poison in it
[02:39:11.820 --> 02:39:17.060]  and slowly kills them they'll all eat it and die and people said your animal
[02:39:17.060 --> 02:39:21.140]  cruelty just poking an ant bed this is the mental illness but killing Iraqi
[02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:25.780]  kids is good but as a side issue I happen to know with ranchers and people
[02:39:25.780 --> 02:39:29.780]  and Richard Reeves reminded me of this today that one of the cheapest forms of
[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:35.660]  killing fire ants is actually Nutrisweet you just shake it up and mix it up with
[02:39:35.660 --> 02:39:39.380]  something like apple juice or something with your equal put it on the fire ant
[02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:42.860]  bed so you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna kill the fire ant bed oh I'm gonna
[02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:46.820]  really commit a crime here I'm gonna kill the fire ant beds in my yard and
[02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:51.540]  videotape it I'm gonna feed them aspartame show them alive and dead a week
[02:39:51.540 --> 02:39:56.180]  later and I'm gonna show you what you're eating it will kill fire ants but
[02:39:56.180 --> 02:40:01.340]  you're eating it that's how incredible this is and then I think about Ted God
[02:40:01.340 --> 02:40:04.220]  bless him and I hate to use him as an example but he wants me to save lives
[02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:09.620]  where the doctor said it so he's God and so he doesn't get his tangy
[02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:12.660]  tangerine and now doesn't you know pretty much know who he is again and has lost
[02:40:12.660 --> 02:40:17.780]  his memory compared to the miraculous results but I've I've seen the cases all
[02:40:17.780 --> 02:40:21.220]  over the place where there was stuff 20 years ago they knew a central fatty
[02:40:21.220 --> 02:40:26.180]  acids and and coconut oil and studies was good for people with Alzheimer's and
[02:40:26.180 --> 02:40:33.300]  then it's an autoimmune situation in some cases in other cases it's chronic
[02:40:33.900 --> 02:40:38.700]  inflammation in the brain according to Dr. Blalock they know this and they know
[02:40:38.700 --> 02:40:43.420]  that when you get off the GMO and get off the aspartame and get off the the
[02:40:43.420 --> 02:40:48.020]  artificial salts like the MSG that you can reverse a lot of it and they won't
[02:40:48.020 --> 02:40:52.180]  tell you because they want to give you the drugs and suck the money out of you
[02:40:52.180 --> 02:40:58.060]  it is so diabolical why would somebody with Alzheimer's from your research as
[02:40:58.060 --> 02:41:02.900]  a pharmacist who would go on to something like tangy tangerine why would
[02:41:02.900 --> 02:41:07.940]  Ted's dad in just a few months she dramatic I mean it was like magic
[02:41:07.940 --> 02:41:11.660]  results Ted said it on air here that his dad suddenly remembered things to go
[02:41:11.660 --> 02:41:17.300]  fishing again was was back he had sores all over his skin like old folks get you
[02:41:17.300 --> 02:41:20.900]  know well you know where the blood vessels break that went away I mean it
[02:41:20.900 --> 02:41:27.100]  was dramatic dramatic how what's happening there pharmacist Ben Fuchs
[02:41:27.100 --> 02:41:30.860]  there's 12 that according to the World Health Organization there's over 12,000
[02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:36.220]  12,800 different diseases but there's not 12,800 different diseases there's
[02:41:36.220 --> 02:41:40.380]  only one disease and it shows up in the brain as Alzheimer's disease and it
[02:41:40.380 --> 02:41:44.060]  shows up in the pancreas diabetes and it shows up in the joints as arthritis and
[02:41:44.060 --> 02:41:48.220]  shows up in the intestinal celiac disease it shows up in different places but
[02:41:48.220 --> 02:41:53.540]  it's just one disease it's the disease of inflammation and breakdown and we get
[02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:58.780]  inflammation and breakdown primarily from one reason and one reason only and
[02:41:58.780 --> 02:42:04.020]  that is lack of nutrients and intake of the wrong kinds of food so whether it's
[02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:07.100]  Alzheimer's disease or whether it's arthritis or whether it's a skin disease
[02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:12.260]  like acne it doesn't matter these are just ways of obfuscating and confusing
[02:42:12.260 --> 02:42:16.340]  people so that they just give up their give it give up and and wave their hands
[02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:20.380]  and say you fix me the fact of the matter is whether it's showing up in your
[02:42:20.380 --> 02:42:23.540]  brain or whether it's showing up in your joints or your pancreas it's your body
[02:42:23.540 --> 02:42:28.940]  breaking down and the body breaks down from only one reason and that is lack of
[02:42:28.940 --> 02:42:32.740]  nutrients and intake of the wrong kinds of foods for two reasons intake of the
[02:42:32.740 --> 02:42:37.020]  wrong substances and lack of nutrients so how do you get around it it's simple
[02:42:37.020 --> 02:42:41.820]  get yourself on nutritional supplementation and watch the results if
[02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:44.620]  it's Alzheimer's disease that you're dealing with your brain health is gonna
[02:42:44.620 --> 02:42:47.780]  improve if it's heart disease that you're dealing with your heart health is
[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:51.220]  gonna improve if it's skin issues that you're dealing with your skin health is
[02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:55.580]  gonna improve because it's really only one thing that's going wrong it's the
[02:42:55.580 --> 02:43:00.300]  body breaking down secondary to lack of nutrients and the intake of wrong food
[02:43:00.300 --> 02:43:05.420]  substances okay and the beautiful thing is it doesn't take long doesn't take 30
[02:43:05.420 --> 02:43:10.140]  days it takes a week or less I want to state something here this is two things
[02:43:10.140 --> 02:43:14.260]  that's happening right now on the radio show I do this occasionally a it is
[02:43:14.260 --> 02:43:18.660]  revolutionary information that can save lives and be it's a sales pitch because
[02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:22.500]  we're a free market system funding ourselves we're not robbing banks like
[02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:26.060]  many revolutionaries do we're trying to restore the Republic get our country back
[02:43:26.060 --> 02:43:29.580]  by promoting things that we believe in and you know I've been promoting
[02:43:29.580 --> 02:43:34.500]  longevity for about a year plus because I know it's good but since I actually did
[02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:39.860]  my own advice I'm just totally sold so I hope people will go to info wars team
[02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:46.300]  dot-com and find out about rebound cell shield RTQ the on tangy tangerine
[02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:51.620]  pollen burst it's all amazing and their purchase also supports the broadcast but
[02:43:51.620 --> 02:43:58.860]  that said that is secondary to people understanding hey don't drink aspartame
[02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:04.020]  I know so many people that listen to the show and friends and family and even
[02:44:04.020 --> 02:44:07.660]  famous people and I'll watch them brush in their teeth and they've got fluoride
[02:44:07.660 --> 02:44:14.220]  toothpaste or or or I see them you know at a restaurant wanting equal and they
[02:44:14.220 --> 02:44:19.700]  just don't think about it so we're trying to save lives here we're trying to
[02:44:19.700 --> 02:44:23.260]  discuss what's really happening I mean if you could see him on TV folks radio
[02:44:23.260 --> 02:44:28.420]  listeners Aaron Dykes 80 plus pounds keep singing 80 plus I mean do you know
[02:44:28.420 --> 02:44:32.940]  how much it is past 80 it's probably 90 but I couldn't guarantee that my goodness
[02:44:32.940 --> 02:44:40.220]  how much did you weigh bro probably 270 maybe more did you know I hit 270 I'm not
[02:44:40.220 --> 02:44:44.220]  proud of it but hey I mean they got how many people know obese in this country I
[02:44:44.220 --> 02:44:46.900]  mean look what they're doing all of us how many people are gonna have cancer
[02:44:46.900 --> 02:44:51.180]  it's it's nearing but you should be proud of the fact that you it's not
[02:44:51.180 --> 02:44:55.060]  embarrassing that you lost all this way to you they were that big hey listen
[02:44:55.060 --> 02:45:00.940]  brother I've only lost right at 40 I need to lose another 40 yeah you know what
[02:45:00.940 --> 02:45:05.180]  Alex and Aaron we're domesticated through our food we're made less virile
[02:45:05.180 --> 02:45:08.380]  we're made like a you know the difference between a lion and a big fat
[02:45:08.380 --> 02:45:12.060]  tabby cat on your couch that's what happens when we eat the food we're
[02:45:12.060 --> 02:45:16.940]  supposed to be lions we're supposed to have a level of virility and energy and
[02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:20.780]  zest for life that allows us to go out and do things when is it happening when
[02:45:20.780 --> 02:45:24.340]  we interface with the food the corporate food and the fast food and the
[02:45:24.340 --> 02:45:28.780]  advertised food and the marketed food is we become like a big fat tabby cat
[02:45:28.780 --> 02:45:34.100]  sitting on the couch when we should be a lion in the jungle it's a domestication
[02:45:34.100 --> 02:45:39.060]  that's going on by the way it's well you feed you feed farm animal certain diets
[02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:44.340]  to make them aggressive or make them docile and when you mention that it's
[02:45:44.340 --> 02:45:50.100]  on record that GMO alone in all species is making things fatter slower and
[02:45:50.100 --> 02:45:55.380]  stupider I saw a big study on that just last week fluoride to you know if you
[02:45:55.380 --> 02:45:59.900]  wanted to pick a way to dumb down the the population of a country you put some
[02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:03.180]  stuff in the water supply wouldn't you so if you put something in the water
[02:46:03.180 --> 02:46:07.460]  supply you got a perfect vehicle a perfect vector for creating any kind of
[02:46:07.460 --> 02:46:11.020]  health condition that you want and now because we've been exposing them they're
[02:46:11.020 --> 02:46:15.100]  openly have you seen pharmacist Ben Fuchs how they're proposing everywhere
[02:46:15.100 --> 02:46:20.980]  putting statins in the water prozac in the water they want to make
[02:46:20.980 --> 02:46:24.940]  drugs now over-the-counter chronic drugs that are being dispensed for chronic
[02:46:24.940 --> 02:46:28.340]  diseases and chronic health Christ chronic health issues like hypertension and
[02:46:28.340 --> 02:46:31.420]  cardiovascular disease and cholesterol lowering drugs they want them over the
[02:46:31.420 --> 02:46:34.420]  counter so you don't even need to go to a doc you can go right to the drugs or
[02:46:34.420 --> 02:46:37.900]  you can see the commercial on TV and then go over to Walgreens and get your
[02:46:37.900 --> 02:46:42.140]  statin statin lowering drug over-the-counter this idea of of drugging
[02:46:42.140 --> 02:46:46.540]  ourselves to health if you just sit and think about it for just 30 seconds it
[02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:51.260]  would just be you'd see it with the stupidity of it how can a point
[02:46:51.260 --> 02:46:56.300]  possibly restore us to health how is that even possible it's this pharmacological
[02:46:56.300 --> 02:47:01.660]  model that is really at the root of much of the much of the health crisis that
[02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:04.500]  we're dealing with in this country this idea that you can eat whatever you want
[02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:07.220]  it doesn't matter what kind of nutrients you take you can just get a
[02:47:07.220 --> 02:47:11.100]  prescription drug and it'll take care of it it's the model itself that is
[02:47:11.100 --> 02:47:16.340]  corrupt absolutely and again the Washington blog that we posted in
[02:47:16.340 --> 02:47:21.180]  full wars calm last week at a boil down of mainline scientific studies will
[02:47:21.180 --> 02:47:25.060]  put that on screen for TV viewers radio listeners I can just search the
[02:47:25.060 --> 02:47:30.180]  headline study genetically modified corn increases body weight in rats and it
[02:47:30.180 --> 02:47:33.500]  goes on to say many crops in the u.s. are now genetically modified for example
[02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:37.620]  93% of soybeans grown in the u.s. are genetically engineered and then they're
[02:47:37.620 --> 02:47:42.420]  used as filler and all the many of the major processed food products out there
[02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:47.620]  86% of all corn GMO 93% of canola that's a lot of the oil you're getting in
[02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:53.860]  foods 93% of cottonseed oil between 08 and 09 95% of all sugar beats planted
[02:47:53.860 --> 02:47:58.140]  were genetically engineered to be able to tolerate high dosages of pesticide
[02:47:58.140 --> 02:48:03.460]  roundup then it links to the mainline studies about higher body weight and
[02:48:03.460 --> 02:48:10.060]  rats lethargy cancer reduced fertility lower IQ is I mean this is what we're
[02:48:10.060 --> 02:48:14.860]  eating this is what's happening and I've looked at studies Americans used to
[02:48:14.860 --> 02:48:19.620]  eat more fattening things bigger desserts in the old time it was like the
[02:48:19.620 --> 02:48:24.700]  French you know smoking cigarette skinny pigging out but we have the GMO a lot
[02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:29.060]  of people actually are eating less now but they're eating crud why do you get
[02:48:29.060 --> 02:48:32.980]  fat when you're eating toxic stuff I mean I mean I guess it's just the
[02:48:32.980 --> 02:48:37.180]  toxins are held oh well number one that's one of the ways the body stores
[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:42.100]  toxins is in fat fat is a mechanism for for keeping toxins safe keeping its
[02:48:42.100 --> 02:48:46.340]  toxins segregated from the rest of the body but secondly you're poisoning your
[02:48:46.340 --> 02:48:49.940]  metabolic system the body has a certain chemistry that it needs look it's like a
[02:48:49.940 --> 02:48:54.060]  recipe you know your body has a recipe like a cake has a recipe or like a
[02:48:54.060 --> 02:48:59.580]  some kind of food has a recipe your body has a recipe it needs certain things it
[02:48:59.580 --> 02:49:03.180]  needs vitamins it needs minerals it needs macronutrients protein essential
[02:49:03.180 --> 02:49:07.340]  fatty acids it needs a certain degree of carbohydrates if you don't give your
[02:49:07.340 --> 02:49:11.540]  body the basics which you're going to end up is with chemical imbalances and
[02:49:11.540 --> 02:49:15.380]  metabolic disorders they're gonna they're gonna look like fat they're
[02:49:15.380 --> 02:49:18.380]  gonna they're gonna feel like sluggishness and they're gonna end up
[02:49:18.380 --> 02:49:21.500]  they're gonna end up producing a dysfunctional immune system that's
[02:49:21.500 --> 02:49:26.860]  gonna keep you sick and unable to defeat this kind of medical and corporate
[02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:29.860]  and government tyranny that we're all dealing with and again I want to be
[02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:37.060]  clear stop eating the fast food stop taking the aspartame stop drinking the
[02:49:37.060 --> 02:49:41.380]  fluoride water my sales pitch is get healthy and then if you want to go to
[02:49:41.380 --> 02:49:46.620]  the next level info wars team calm it is so simple and this is one of the few
[02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:50.340]  areas we can really try to take full control of our lives they're still
[02:49:50.340 --> 02:49:53.940]  chem trailing us they're still you know they're spraying crops with pesticides
[02:49:53.940 --> 02:49:58.580]  you're still getting it in vegetables they use fluoride as a pesticide I'm
[02:49:58.580 --> 02:50:02.700]  gonna kill fire ants with equal I'm a show people and that that's one of the
[02:50:02.700 --> 02:50:06.580]  next videos I'm gonna do I mean that's my mission and it's not because I'm goody
[02:50:06.580 --> 02:50:10.780]  two shoes or Ben Fuchs says it's normal to want to warn people info wars team
[02:50:10.780 --> 02:50:14.620]  calm I haven't gone through a lot of these there's all these points I want to
[02:50:14.620 --> 02:50:19.220]  get into you I get into with you like high fructose corn syrup are trying to

[02:54:00.980 --> 02:54:10.980]  all the leaves are brown leaves are brown and the sky is grey and the sky is grey
[02:54:10.980 --> 02:54:18.980]  I came for nothing for a while on a winter's day on a winter's day
[02:54:18.980 --> 02:54:24.980]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs is our guest let's run through these points real quick
[02:54:24.980 --> 02:54:30.500]  now there's so many I want to have you back up maybe with Dr. Corey Gold in a
[02:54:30.500 --> 02:54:33.140]  few days to actually go through these maybe I'll have both you guys together
[02:54:33.140 --> 02:54:37.780]  and maybe I can take a chill pill instead of a pollen burst and actually shut
[02:54:37.780 --> 02:54:43.620]  up it's just that I'm so excited about this it works so well I watched Aaron
[02:54:43.620 --> 02:54:48.780]  not eating exercising couldn't lose weight I was in the same boat and this
[02:54:48.780 --> 02:54:53.300]  isn't even advertises weight loss all these other baloney weight loss systems
[02:54:53.300 --> 02:54:59.140]  don't work or unhealthy and there was the answer when I want a midnight snack I
[02:54:59.140 --> 02:55:04.220]  drink some tangy tangerine again I didn't even get him on to do a big
[02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:07.860]  sales pitch today and then I just start promoting it saying get it because I know
[02:55:07.860 --> 02:55:14.780]  it's that good it's so frustrating that some people out there won't believe me
[02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:20.260]  and won't try it but going through these points here what about the movements
[02:55:20.260 --> 02:55:26.540]  now openly to restrict over-the-counter vitamins and minerals Ben evil it's
[02:55:26.540 --> 02:55:30.860]  insidious it's so nasty especially vitamin C by the way vitamin C they seem
[02:55:30.860 --> 02:55:33.460]  to be targeting vitamin C I don't know if you notice it that's their favorite
[02:55:33.460 --> 02:55:36.620]  one that's the one that they're really concentrating on limiting and keeping
[02:55:36.620 --> 02:55:40.900]  people from getting because vitamin C isn't even really a vitamin if it's like
[02:55:40.900 --> 02:55:44.820]  a god among men when it comes to vitamin most animals make their own vitamin C
[02:55:44.820 --> 02:55:48.860]  human beings and and guinea pigs there was a Nobel prize on that the elite know
[02:55:48.860 --> 02:55:53.620]  that they're obsessed with it Linus Pauling got research on it so powerful
[02:55:53.620 --> 02:55:59.300]  and so non-toxic that it almost beggars belief it's almost unbelievable the
[02:55:59.300 --> 02:56:04.900]  comp it's toxic it's a benefit to toxicity to toxicity ratio you can take
[02:56:04.900 --> 02:56:09.340]  grams of it intravenously and in fact but if you had any kind of degenerative
[02:56:09.340 --> 02:56:12.980]  disease you'd be wise to take grams of it I was about to say that's the main
[02:56:12.980 --> 02:56:17.300]  thing he credits along with other things but of course you know that you know one
[02:56:17.300 --> 02:56:21.340]  of the most famous Native Americans he likes to be called American Indian who
[02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:26.020]  are Russell means they were injecting him and it's like one clinic where they're
[02:56:26.020 --> 02:56:30.180]  allowed to do it as an official cancer treatment with mega dosages of pure
[02:56:30.180 --> 02:56:33.820]  vitamin C and it was just like and they was gonna be dead soon and people are
[02:56:33.820 --> 02:56:38.140]  reportedly taking it orally with fatty vitamin C to and on that whole thing is
[02:56:38.140 --> 02:56:42.380]  just poison it's it's across to a vampire for their whole medical
[02:56:42.380 --> 02:56:46.300]  industrial complex vitamin C is it's amazingly important now here's the thing
[02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:49.740]  about vitamin C if you take a prescription drug you got to control the
[02:56:49.740 --> 02:56:54.500]  dosage very very tightly the window what they call a therapeutic window the
[02:56:54.500 --> 02:56:57.620]  amount that you can take without having side effects is very small on
[02:56:57.620 --> 02:57:02.020]  prescription drugs sometimes five or ten milligrams a five or ten milligram
[02:57:02.020 --> 02:57:05.460]  difference can cause toxicity and side effects with vitamin C because it's a
[02:57:05.460 --> 02:57:10.660]  vitamin because it's handled by the body so efficiently you can take mega doses
[02:57:10.660 --> 02:57:14.740]  of it orally as well as internally and not only that because vitamin C is a
[02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:19.860]  stress vitamin and it's an anti-inflammatory vitamin most people are deficient
[02:57:19.860 --> 02:57:23.940]  because most people are under huge amounts of stress and most people are
[02:57:23.940 --> 02:57:31.300]  dealing with three four five grams there's no you could take ten grams of it
[02:57:31.300 --> 02:57:34.780]  I go to bowel tolerance is what I tell people and that means go to the point
[02:57:34.780 --> 02:57:38.140]  where you start to have loose stools which by the way makes vitamin C an
[02:57:38.140 --> 02:57:48.180]  amazing laxative there are millions on that tangentangerine has 1,667% of the
[02:57:48.180 --> 02:57:52.740]  daily value you need but but are you saying that's not even enough well no
[02:57:52.740 --> 02:57:56.140]  here's the thing about the beyond tangentangerine the vitamin C is in a
[02:57:56.140 --> 02:58:00.220]  liquid form and the body needs its nutrients in a liquid form when people
[02:58:00.220 --> 02:58:03.500]  take vitamin C typically they're taking a vitamin C pill or they're getting
[02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:06.420]  vitamin C in a multiple vitamin and it depends in order for you to get the
[02:58:06.420 --> 02:58:09.700]  benefit of the vitamin C you got to be breaking down the pill you got to be
[02:58:09.700 --> 02:58:12.860]  breaking down the vitamin you got to deal with absorption with the beyond
[02:58:12.860 --> 02:58:16.900]  tangentangerine because of its liquid fashion it goes right to work and this
[02:58:16.900 --> 02:58:21.020]  is especially important if you have any kind of digestive issues which many many
[02:58:21.020 --> 02:58:25.660]  millions of Americans do well beyond tangentangerine is my favorite and I
[02:58:25.660 --> 02:58:28.700]  just try to bunch the stuff that's what I like a hundred and fifteen vegetables
[02:58:28.700 --> 02:58:32.940]  and fruits that are condensed down into this bad boy the mighty 90 of vitamins

[03:01:35.260 --> 03:01:40.140]  are made domestic and we're made dumb by the foods in fact it should it should
[03:01:40.140 --> 03:01:45.060]  make people angry to pass by mcdonald's or the golden arches or whatever kind of

[03:01:50.860 --> 03:01:54.660]  how we're manipulated this is how we are directed and this is how we'll make

[03:01:59.300 --> 03:02:04.660]  that's this sanity returning is that I hatefully look at mcdonald's I hate

[03:02:08.900 --> 03:02:13.100]  all of these different types of things because I realize that when I eat it I
[03:02:13.100 --> 03:02:17.780]  feel ill and I realize they're pushing on everybody as our society degenerates
[03:02:17.780 --> 03:02:21.900]  where they have the worst heart problems cancer were cursed and it's all part of
[03:02:21.900 --> 03:02:27.460]  the vaccine pushers they all own it and I declare war on them mcdonald's is part
[03:02:27.460 --> 03:02:32.740]  of the Monsanto board of directors the pure evil pure evil pure evil that's

[03:03:04.580 --> 03:03:07.900]  getting on your on a nutritional supplement program is if you have a
[03:03:07.900 --> 03:03:12.380]  craving for salt get yourself on minerals these people that make the food
[03:03:12.380 --> 03:03:16.300]  the food processors they understand how to hit these cravings but when you get
[03:03:16.300 --> 03:03:19.780]  yourself on nutritional supplements and you get yourself on minerals that's your
[03:03:19.780 --> 03:03:23.820]  own salt cravings that you're hitting when you get yourself on protein that's
[03:03:23.820 --> 03:03:27.660]  your own sugar craving maybe the space alien that's inside that rubber suit
[03:03:27.660 --> 03:03:31.340]  that they call Elena Kagan really looks like gremis like it's a big purple
[03:03:31.340 --> 03:03:37.020]  turd I'm sorry I'm sorry Ben I'm having trouble dealing the new world order
