[00:00.000 --> 00:18.400]  Leading of frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18.400 --> 00:32.000]  Two of our reporters are on the ground and are walking in to the control borders zone.
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.440]  It's about a 20-minute walk and they've gotten out of their vehicles and they're traveling
[00:37.440 --> 00:42.800]  down the beach towards where the illegal alien, UN-funded Horde, is beginning to mass in the
[00:42.800 --> 00:49.200]  last 24 hours and have been scaling the fence, throwing rocks at people.
[00:49.200 --> 00:51.560]  We're going to have them joining us in about an hour live.
[00:51.560 --> 00:59.560]  They're also going to be posting exclusive reports to newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:59.560 --> 01:05.880]  So look for that live feed coming up probably in the second hour today.
[01:05.880 --> 01:12.600]  I don't even at this point know what to say because we know there is a wall of double
[01:12.600 --> 01:17.080]  standards and criminality being committed against Trump and against anyone that supports Trump
[01:17.080 --> 01:22.960]  in the restoration of our constitutional republic.
[01:22.960 --> 01:29.640]  Barack Obama threw entire groups of hundreds of conservative newspapers out saying, I don't
[01:29.640 --> 01:32.040]  think your reporting is accurate.
[01:32.040 --> 01:37.240]  He would stage the questions hours before with the control corporate press he would
[01:37.240 --> 01:38.560]  go to.
[01:38.560 --> 01:43.120]  He arrested and prosecuted and persecuted whistleblowers, remembers the press, the likes
[01:43.120 --> 01:45.600]  of which we've never seen in our history.
[01:45.600 --> 01:49.920]  There's video of him saying, this is my house, get out of here and have somebody that doesn't
[01:49.920 --> 01:52.520]  shut up like Acosta thrown out, which was cheered.
[01:52.520 --> 02:01.840]  But then a federal judge recently appointed by Trump said Acosta was abused and his rights
[02:01.840 --> 02:05.280]  were trampled to be thrown out.
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.680]  And that's another hoax Acosta's hard pass, which means he can wander basically anywhere
[02:10.680 --> 02:13.480]  he wants was taken.
[02:13.480 --> 02:17.040]  He still has his soft pass to go to the press conferences, but guess who the mainstream
[02:17.040 --> 02:22.640]  media lobby to year and a half ago to have their soft pass taken infowars.com, thousands
[02:22.640 --> 02:27.560]  of articles, national scandal where the control corporate press weighing in saying Alex Jones
[02:27.560 --> 02:34.800]  is fake and Dr. Jerome Corsi needs to be thrown out and the White House buckled and
[02:34.800 --> 02:39.560]  said, okay, they don't get to come to the press conference.
[02:39.560 --> 02:42.520]  And now the very same groups all get all upset.
[02:42.520 --> 02:49.320]  The federal judge sees that in the control corporate media and says, let me virtue signal.
[02:49.320 --> 02:55.080]  You see, anyone that sides with America with common sense is under attack.
[02:55.080 --> 02:59.680]  And so these cowards virtue signal to the establishment and continue to rule against
[02:59.680 --> 03:02.400]  Trump until it gets to the Supreme Court level.
[03:02.400 --> 03:09.440]  Remember the Supreme Court when they said that Trump obviously could control who came
[03:09.440 --> 03:10.880]  into the country and who didn't.
[03:10.880 --> 03:11.880]  That's in the Constitution.
[03:11.880 --> 03:14.120]  It's a no brainer.
[03:14.120 --> 03:19.600]  Same thing with the appointment of Whitaker as the acting attorney generally has 210
[03:19.600 --> 03:23.600]  days for them to start hearings for his official approval.
[03:23.600 --> 03:26.120]  He's acting AG has all the powers of the AG.
[03:26.120 --> 03:27.480]  The media says that's not true.
[03:27.480 --> 03:29.480]  It's Oaks.
[03:29.480 --> 03:33.560]  So it's the same scenario over and over again.
[03:33.560 --> 03:38.040]  Republican judges, Democrat judges rule against Trump until he gets to the Supreme Court.
[03:38.040 --> 03:41.680]  And then it's so obvious how fraudulent it is the Supreme Court has to overrule over and
[03:41.680 --> 03:42.680]  over again.
[03:42.680 --> 03:44.520]  Lower courts has never any coverage of that.
[03:44.520 --> 03:45.520]  Let me explain something.
[03:45.520 --> 03:50.240]  There's something called separation of powers between the legislative, the executive and
[03:50.240 --> 03:52.040]  the judicial.
[03:52.040 --> 03:58.960]  And the president, one infinity percent has control over who comes in the White House
[03:58.960 --> 03:59.960]  and who doesn't.
[03:59.960 --> 04:02.200]  The president doesn't have to have a press conference.
[04:02.200 --> 04:05.280]  The president could shut down the press office in there.
[04:05.280 --> 04:08.320]  There wasn't one till about 80 years ago.
[04:08.320 --> 04:12.160]  The president could do it every once, but he is always letting the press in.
[04:12.160 --> 04:16.400]  He kicked the cost out because the cost was grabbing the woman, but the media all lined
[04:16.400 --> 04:23.920]  up as liars, as truth assassin, and they said he didn't touch her, even though you all saw
[04:23.920 --> 04:27.080]  him do it.
[04:27.080 --> 04:29.200]  So this is the next level.
[04:29.200 --> 04:31.280]  This is the next level.
[04:31.280 --> 04:33.560]  It's not about a cost on this petty issue.
[04:33.560 --> 04:40.360]  It's that most people are scared that Trump appoints, and they'll side against him every
[04:40.360 --> 04:45.080]  time they'll side against America because they're cowards and they're scum, and they
[04:45.080 --> 04:47.920]  got into the system so that they can be part of the system.
[04:47.920 --> 04:52.960]  Trump is an outsider coming in trying to desperately rest control from these special interests.
[04:52.960 --> 04:53.960]  They're fighting.
[04:53.960 --> 04:57.040]  They're fighting to maintain control, bloodsuckers.
[04:57.040 --> 04:58.040]  We'll be back.
[04:58.040 --> 05:00.520]  Stay where the special gets straight ahead.

[06:19.120 --> 06:32.720]  It is Friday, the 16th of November, 2018.
[06:32.720 --> 06:40.120]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to plunge directly into the insane news.
[06:40.120 --> 06:43.040]  Let me just read the headlines.
[06:43.040 --> 06:51.040]  Winter Storm Avery causes chaotic commutes, strand students at school overnight kills
[06:51.040 --> 06:53.440]  nine on slick roads.
[06:53.440 --> 06:59.200]  A lot of top meteorologists and astrophysicists say that we're looking for a new ice age
[06:59.200 --> 07:02.120]  to begin, at least a mini-ice age.
[07:02.120 --> 07:09.280]  Meanwhile, Celine Dionne is now launching a new clothing line where she literally invades
[07:09.280 --> 07:13.720]  a school nursery and turns all the children genderless.
[07:13.720 --> 07:18.200]  The assault, the rape of the genders, accelerates.
[07:18.200 --> 07:24.600]  Furious Tories rebel and attack their puppet globalist prime minister for betraying Britain
[07:24.600 --> 07:28.760]  on a vote of no confidence she can be removed from office today.
[07:28.760 --> 07:33.880]  The new so-called Brexit deal, three years after the UK voted to pull out of the New
[07:33.880 --> 07:40.840]  World Order and the EU, actually gives the EU total control over the UK and makes them
[07:40.840 --> 07:43.680]  a complete vassal.
[07:43.680 --> 07:49.360]  So you talk about a really, really slick stab in the back, that's it.
[07:49.360 --> 07:53.960]  We have Paul Watson joining us to break that down as well.
[07:53.960 --> 07:58.400]  Continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, migrants, that's illegal aliens funded by the UN and
[07:58.400 --> 08:00.200]  US taxpayers.
[08:00.200 --> 08:02.160]  Migrants are scaling US Mexico fence.
[08:02.160 --> 08:05.400]  Will they be arrested?
[08:05.400 --> 08:08.680]  San Diego Tribune.
[08:08.680 --> 08:13.000]  Dozens from caravan line up at border seeking asylum.
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.160]  More caravan migrants arrive in Tijuana, brace for long stay, as more than 50,000 from three
[08:18.160 --> 08:21.280]  different caravans make their way.
[08:21.280 --> 08:27.880]  Meanwhile, Springdale man arrested after shooting at multiple officers during pursuit.
[08:27.880 --> 08:28.880]  That's KFSN.
[08:28.880 --> 08:33.760]  We have to read in USA Today and everywhere else to find out who this Springdale man was,
[08:33.760 --> 08:39.320]  an illegal alien trying to kill a bunch of cops.
[08:39.320 --> 08:43.440]  But again, you'll never hear that, though it's in the arrest information.
[08:43.440 --> 08:50.560]  Meanwhile, Camilla Harris of California draws parallel between ICE and the KKK.
[08:50.560 --> 08:53.960]  Having a border is the KKK.
[08:53.960 --> 08:57.600]  Arresting someone shooting and trying to kill cops is KKK.
[08:57.600 --> 09:03.160]  Meanwhile, Vice President Pitt says empire and aggression have no place in Indo-Pacific.
[09:03.160 --> 09:06.480]  Reuters are shot across the bow at the communist Chinese.
[09:06.480 --> 09:11.200]  Speaking of communist Chinese, I've told you they're exporting their Mark of the Beast
[09:11.200 --> 09:16.560]  global social score working with Google and now secretly Facebook, Twitter, and of course
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.400]  Apple is chaperoning the whole merger.
[09:21.400 --> 09:29.160]  To export global social score with face scanning cameras up to a half a mile away to ticket
[09:29.160 --> 09:34.040]  you and control your life, and they just announced the U.S. Chinese developed face scanning is
[09:34.040 --> 09:37.560]  going to be deployed, where if they see you on your phone from a half mile away, you'll
[09:37.560 --> 09:41.040]  be given a ticket or it'll be added to your social score.
[09:41.040 --> 09:43.400]  Meanwhile, Venezuela thinks it's great as well.
[09:43.400 --> 09:47.880]  Venezuela is releasing an ID card that can track and punish citizens, a global social
[09:47.880 --> 09:52.240]  score system Reuters reports now coming to Venezuela and who designed it?
[09:52.240 --> 09:57.120]  Chinese telecom giant building Venezuela's social credit system.
[09:57.120 --> 10:00.880]  Told you this five years ago, six years ago, now it's in Reuters.
[10:00.880 --> 10:05.520]  Meanwhile, Professor Warren's Amazon Echo is always recording her conversations.
[10:05.520 --> 10:09.080]  Judge gives authorities access to Alexa's recordings in double murder case.
[10:09.080 --> 10:14.160]  Turns out everything 24-7 for over a year from the time they plugged it in was recorded
[10:14.160 --> 10:16.200]  at the Amazon data banks.
[10:16.200 --> 10:21.600]  So housed with the central intelligence agency.
[10:21.600 --> 10:23.320]  That's just some of what we'll be covering there.
[10:23.320 --> 10:28.000]  Meanwhile, more and more judges are ruling in the UK, Canada and the United States that
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.440]  atheists have a right to be your preachers.
[10:33.440 --> 10:34.440]  You heard me right.
[10:34.440 --> 10:36.040]  They must invade everything.
[10:36.040 --> 10:39.960]  The trans movement has a right to tell your five-year-old boy they're really a girl and
[10:39.960 --> 10:42.280]  your five-year-old girl they're really a boy.
[10:42.280 --> 10:45.640]  They have a right to have men compete in sports and take over women's sports.
[10:45.640 --> 10:49.600]  And now Christian church backs Atheist pastor amid uproar.
[10:49.600 --> 10:51.760]  That's an info wars.com article.
[10:51.760 --> 10:52.760]  Kit Daniels.
[10:52.760 --> 10:53.760]  Yes.
[10:53.760 --> 10:55.920]  We're going to teach you there is no God.
[10:55.920 --> 10:58.720]  That's the new official religion.
[10:58.720 --> 11:04.520]  Invading the churches to the ecumenical movement because if you don't teach that, your 501c3
[11:04.520 --> 11:05.520]  is taken.
[11:05.520 --> 11:06.520]  It's here.
[11:06.520 --> 11:11.120]  Meanwhile, Rand Paul warns of censorship of conservatives by big tech of all places he
[11:11.120 --> 11:12.600]  went to CNN to do it.
[11:12.600 --> 11:18.280]  Meanwhile, a real journalist releasing real information that exposed criminal activity
[11:18.280 --> 11:21.320]  is now we've learned been secretly indicted as we first reported a year ago.
[11:21.320 --> 11:27.240]  Now it's confirmed they accidentally released it in a data dump the federal judge did.
[11:27.240 --> 11:28.240]  Federal prosecutors.
[11:28.240 --> 11:33.320]  Assange prosecutor accidentally reveals he has been secretly indicted.
[11:33.320 --> 11:40.560]  Meanwhile, the unelected dictator of the European Union, Junker has been seen totally drunk
[11:40.560 --> 11:45.560]  unable to talk again at the podium wearing a brown shoe and a black shoe until his aides
[11:45.560 --> 11:51.140]  come over and tell him he's also been videotaped again, groping women in public.
[11:51.140 --> 11:54.800]  So all of that is coming up as well.
[11:54.800 --> 12:00.040]  But now for this segment and the next, I'm going to be speaking with David Knight of
[12:00.040 --> 12:05.600]  the David Knight show that kicks off every weekday morning, 8am to 11am, proceeding this
[12:05.600 --> 12:12.440]  transmission, the Alex Jones show about a story within a story within a story.
[12:12.440 --> 12:18.400]  Jim Acosta gets up, as you all know, a week and a half ago and says, less than a week
[12:18.400 --> 12:23.840]  and a half ago, a little over a week and a half ago, I guess about nine days ago, technically.
[12:23.840 --> 12:29.080]  Jim Acosta gets up and he says, there is no caravan and Trump goes, no, it's real.
[12:29.080 --> 12:31.880]  And so Acosta says, no, it's not, it's hundreds of miles away.
[12:31.880 --> 12:34.320]  So just everything coming out of Acosta's mouth is a lie.
[12:34.320 --> 12:36.800]  So after three questions, Trump says, that's enough.
[12:36.800 --> 12:41.480]  Acosta grabs the mic back from the intern, pushes her arm down, and the whole corporate
[12:41.480 --> 12:45.440]  media says it's not true, he didn't touch her.
[12:45.440 --> 12:46.440]  This is incredible.
[12:46.440 --> 12:47.440]  Fox News weighs in.
[12:47.440 --> 12:53.080]  A suit is filed in federal court in a recently appointed judge that Trump nominated.
[12:53.080 --> 12:58.760]  And the judge virtue signaling says that Acosta's rights were violated.
[12:58.760 --> 12:59.760]  We're going to read this.
[12:59.760 --> 13:03.560]  And the first amendment was so, A, that's a hoax when it hoax.
[13:03.560 --> 13:07.120]  He had his hard pass taken where he can just walk around anywhere he wants, anytime at
[13:07.120 --> 13:08.120]  the White House.
[13:08.120 --> 13:12.520]  He can get his soft pass, plus mainstream media, including CNN lobbied to have our soft pass
[13:12.520 --> 13:15.360]  taken a year and a half ago from Jerome Gorsi, which was taken.
[13:15.360 --> 13:19.960]  So you just heap the hypocrisy on the hypocrisy.
[13:19.960 --> 13:22.280]  Then it gets worse.
[13:22.280 --> 13:27.400]  We go back and see Obama criticizing Trump saying he's in a war on the press when Obama
[13:27.400 --> 13:31.280]  used to shut down questioners and say, you're in my house.
[13:31.280 --> 13:33.040]  We'll play that in a moment.
[13:33.040 --> 13:37.760]  Trump would arrest hundreds of whistleblowers and members of the press and blocked hundreds
[13:37.760 --> 13:42.320]  of conservative publications from the White House core completely saying he believed they
[13:42.320 --> 13:44.120]  weren't reporting accurately.
[13:44.120 --> 13:49.080]  So he says specifically your band because I don't like how you report.
[13:49.080 --> 13:53.640]  Remember that Obama boots reporters from conservative papers.
[13:53.640 --> 13:59.320]  Obama who wants surveilled reporters, criticizes Trump over press freedom flashback here all
[13:59.320 --> 14:03.000]  the times Obama kick reporters out of press events.
[14:03.000 --> 14:04.000]  This is incredible.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.520]  And here he is saying this is my house, which is true.
[14:06.520 --> 14:11.920]  He is the executive over the executive branch when he was president and a hundred percent
[14:11.920 --> 14:14.960]  has control over who can come in and out of the White House.
[14:14.960 --> 14:21.520]  But now just two years and change later, the entire corporate press, including Fox News
[14:21.520 --> 14:25.480]  and federal judges come in and say, you can't do that.
[14:25.480 --> 14:29.800]  You abused poor little Jim Acosta, who didn't touch that woman, even though you all saw
[14:29.800 --> 14:33.720]  him do it and didn't jerk the microphone away and who never hackles and he's a perfect
[14:33.720 --> 14:34.720]  little angel.
[14:34.720 --> 14:36.760]  The judge said, I'm going to read the ruling to you.
[14:36.760 --> 14:40.680]  Acosta has been abused.
[14:40.680 --> 14:44.200]  This is incredible because CNN is globalist run media.
[14:44.200 --> 14:45.200]  It's force fed.
[14:45.200 --> 14:48.680]  We're going to go to break in a moment, come back with David Knight to get his breakdown
[14:48.680 --> 14:49.680]  of this.
[14:49.680 --> 14:52.320]  But here is Obama saying this is my house.
[14:52.320 --> 14:58.520]  The civil rights of LGBT Americans is yeah, hold on a second.
[14:58.520 --> 15:00.840]  Okay, you know what?
[15:00.840 --> 15:07.200]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[15:07.200 --> 15:10.200]  no, no, no, no, no, no.
[15:10.200 --> 15:11.200]  Hey.
[15:11.200 --> 15:12.200]  Yeah.
[15:12.200 --> 15:13.200]  Listen, you're my house.
[15:13.200 --> 15:14.200]  You don't know?
[15:14.200 --> 15:15.200]  Come on.
[15:15.200 --> 15:17.900]  It's not, you know what?
[15:17.900 --> 15:28.400]  It's not, it's not respectful when you get invited to somebody.
[15:28.400 --> 15:37.280]  You're not, you're not, you're not going to, you're not, you're, you're not going to get
[15:37.280 --> 15:40.400]  a good response from me by interrupting me like this.
[15:40.400 --> 15:48.400]  No, shame on you, you're going to be doing this.
[15:48.400 --> 15:59.960]  Shame on you, same thing from Shut.
[15:59.960 --> 16:00.960]  Hear that?
[16:00.960 --> 16:06.400]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.

[20:03.600 --> 20:16.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:16.360 --> 20:31.200]  Live, raw and unfiltered, it's the Alex Jones show.
[20:31.200 --> 20:36.680]  It was Tucker Carlson a few nights ago that dedicated two segments to the unprecedented
[20:36.680 --> 20:41.440]  attack on the First Amendment, on the press, by Obama, by the Democrats, and currently
[20:41.440 --> 20:46.320]  big tech working with the Democrats, congressional hearings saying silence all conservatives
[20:46.320 --> 20:49.560]  off the internet.
[20:49.560 --> 20:55.680]  And that's how they were able to basically steal the 2018 election, a combination of
[20:55.680 --> 20:56.680]  censorship and fraud.
[20:56.680 --> 21:04.800]  Meanwhile, look at drugreport.com, Acosta gets a pass, Trump judge sides with CNN White
[21:04.800 --> 21:12.800]  House media mesh, well the mess is that these lower courts always go against Trump and then
[21:12.800 --> 21:16.560]  the higher courts always go with him because Trump's on the right, he can kick anybody
[21:16.560 --> 21:17.560]  out he wants.
[21:17.560 --> 21:21.840]  Obama kicked hundreds of different conservative outlets out over the years saying I don't
[21:21.840 --> 21:23.960]  think you're accurate reporting.
[21:23.960 --> 21:28.560]  He was specifically saying I don't like what you said, so you're out.
[21:28.560 --> 21:32.720]  It's very draconian, it's very authoritarian, but it's the executive branch, you don't
[21:32.720 --> 21:36.600]  have a right to be in there inside the White House.
[21:36.600 --> 21:40.400]  You can go around to events, you can ask questions, try to cover things, but you can't be inside
[21:40.400 --> 21:41.400]  the White House.
[21:41.400 --> 21:45.880]  Like Obama said, you're in my house, we played that clip earlier.
[21:45.880 --> 21:50.680]  But the fact that the media ignores the arrest of hundreds of reporters, the prosecution,
[21:50.680 --> 21:55.600]  the persecution, using the trading with the enemy act, the sedition act, all of the stuff
[21:55.600 --> 22:00.400]  that nobody's ever done except Lincoln in the middle of a huge war, to the press and
[22:00.400 --> 22:06.320]  the corporate media praised this when their own reporters were being indicted and arrested.
[22:06.320 --> 22:09.600]  And now Julian Assange we learn has a secret indictment, we reported on it over a year
[22:09.600 --> 22:13.480]  ago but next year's news today.
[22:13.480 --> 22:17.760]  So I don't even know how to describe how insane this is and we're right in the middle
[22:17.760 --> 22:21.800]  of the story because Paul Watson blew up the video when they were saying Acosta hadn't
[22:21.800 --> 22:28.760]  touched her, he zoomed in about double, did nothing else to it, uploaded it to Twitter
[22:28.760 --> 22:31.840]  and they go, it's a different video format than the original, that's what happens when
[22:31.840 --> 22:35.720]  you can press it, download it and re-upload it.
[22:35.720 --> 22:38.360]  Hundreds of different angles, up the same thing.
[22:38.360 --> 22:43.720]  And the White House spokesperson said, look, their video's real, it's zoomed in, the president
[22:43.720 --> 22:45.160]  said that too.
[22:45.160 --> 22:49.880]  But it doesn't matter, everybody saw it, everybody saw it.
[22:49.880 --> 22:53.280]  So this is next level, we're seeing in and the rest of the corporate press claims their
[22:53.280 --> 23:02.120]  free speech, claims that they stand with the First Amendment for themselves but then are
[23:02.120 --> 23:05.320]  advocates for getting rid of it for everybody else.
[23:05.320 --> 23:10.000]  It's quite a sickening position and it needs to be called out when they have hearings in
[23:10.000 --> 23:15.360]  January where the Democrats are going to witch-hunt Trump now as the enemy of the press when he's
[23:15.360 --> 23:18.120]  been the opposite.
[23:18.120 --> 23:21.200]  He actually goes towards the press, he talks, he has more press conferences they might have
[23:21.200 --> 23:25.480]  ever seen, he's more open and transparent than anybody and they turn that around.
[23:25.480 --> 23:28.560]  So when the Republicans have these hearings, when the Democrats have them, the Republicans
[23:28.560 --> 23:32.200]  have got to say, are you kidding, you're the ones in these very committees, he said, silence
[23:32.200 --> 23:37.200]  in full wars and drudge report and talk radio, you people are monsters and you think we're
[23:37.200 --> 23:41.960]  so dumb that you're not doing this, David Knight, this is just so insane.
[23:41.960 --> 23:47.360]  Yeah, you know, Alex, I think it needs to be said that there's a big difference between
[23:47.360 --> 23:52.520]  taking actions against a specific reporter and taking actions against an entire news
[23:52.520 --> 23:53.520]  organization.
[23:53.520 --> 23:57.600]  Now that's, latter is what Barack Obama has done as well but it's also a difference between
[23:57.600 --> 23:58.600]  speech and conduct.
[23:58.600 --> 24:03.080]  New issues to always say, I don't like your speech or whatever you say, I can do anything,
[24:03.080 --> 24:07.320]  I can scream and shout, I can wave my arms around, but you hit me, that's a different
[24:07.320 --> 24:08.440]  thing, right?
[24:08.440 --> 24:11.560]  And that's really what's going on here in the White House.
[24:11.560 --> 24:16.960]  It's not just the fact that you've got Jim Acosta constantly trying to seize the stage
[24:16.960 --> 24:22.880]  and grandstand and draw attention to himself by debating the president, but it's that when
[24:22.880 --> 24:26.000]  they told him, okay, that's enough, but we've answered two of your questions, he starts
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.760]  with a third one, that's enough, the intern tries to take it away and he gets physical
[24:29.760 --> 24:31.920]  with her and for that reason he can be thrown out.
[24:31.920 --> 24:37.400]  But if we go back to what Obama did, Alex, as you were talking about, going back to 2009,
[24:37.400 --> 24:43.680]  Obama banned Fox News from a lot of very important interviews and Josh Ernest was upfront about
[24:43.680 --> 24:47.400]  it, he bragged about that, but of course now Fox News is under different management and
[24:47.400 --> 24:49.720]  now they're standing proudly with CNN.
[24:49.720 --> 24:53.560]  It's absolutely amazing, we had Barack Obama before he became president, about a week before
[24:53.560 --> 24:59.560]  the election, there were some newspapers that had endorsed his opponent at the time, McCain,
[24:59.560 --> 25:02.560]  and he threw those reporters off the plane right after he got elected.
[25:02.560 --> 25:06.400]  He threw a black female reporter out of the White House, can you imagine if Trump did
[25:06.400 --> 25:07.400]  something like that?
[25:07.400 --> 25:11.680]  Well, they actually, she showed up and didn't know at the Tarmac and they physically grabbed
[25:11.680 --> 25:14.600]  her and drug her off, like I'll find the photo of that.
[25:14.600 --> 25:15.600]  It's incredible.
[25:15.600 --> 25:19.560]  Yeah, and then the clip that you were playing there, I played earlier this morning about
[25:19.560 --> 25:21.560]  the, you know, this is my house.
[25:21.560 --> 25:26.520]  That was a transgender individual, that was an LGBT event, and that was a transgender
[25:26.520 --> 25:31.320]  guy that was upset about something that Obama was not doing, he goes, hey, you know, that's
[25:31.320 --> 25:33.920]  very rude, I'm not gonna let you, this is my house, you get out.
[25:33.920 --> 25:38.160]  So here's the deal, Alex, you know, we've got a difference between conduct and speech
[25:38.160 --> 25:40.000]  that they want to ignore.
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.680]  There's a difference between one reporter and an entire news organization that they
[25:44.680 --> 25:49.960]  want to ignore, and then there's the difference that the White House is not the public square
[25:49.960 --> 25:53.120]  and they want to ignore that because they have a double standard.
[25:53.120 --> 25:58.400]  Whenever you do anything to these protected mainstream media organizations, then they
[25:58.400 --> 26:02.680]  scream bloody murder that you're attacking their free speech, but then they allow infowars
[26:02.680 --> 26:06.960]  to be completely deprogrammed off of Twitter and other places.
[26:06.960 --> 26:10.640]  You know, when we talk about the public square, right, the public square is not the White
[26:10.640 --> 26:16.600]  House, the public square is not Tucker Carlson's house, the public square is Twitter.
[26:16.600 --> 26:18.280]  Jack Dorsey has said that eight times.
[26:18.280 --> 26:22.840]  Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that, a federal judge earlier this year ruled that people
[26:22.840 --> 26:27.200]  attacking Trump, he can't block them on his Twitter, it's a public square, but the very
[26:27.200 --> 26:33.920]  same type of judiciary then says they can ban any nationalist conservatives, they want
[26:33.920 --> 26:34.920]  off of everything.
[26:34.920 --> 26:40.400]  So this is a huge double standard, it is cartels of corporations and government working in
[26:40.400 --> 26:47.160]  unison to silence pro-America, pro-Trump, pro-restoration of the republic media, and
[26:47.160 --> 26:48.640]  that's what makes it an organized crime.
[26:48.640 --> 26:51.800]  It is a concerted effort to silence us.
[26:51.800 --> 26:56.600]  Here is Senator Rand Paul speaking about this of all places, CNN.
[26:56.600 --> 27:01.880]  There he is in the lion's den of the anti-free speech movement talking about it.
[27:01.880 --> 27:05.880]  You know, I think the whole Facebook thing presents a conundrum to us.
[27:05.880 --> 27:09.760]  It's a privately owned company, most time conservatives, we don't want to over-regulate
[27:09.760 --> 27:14.720]  private businesses, but they do have sort of a monopoly on this sort of social exchange
[27:14.720 --> 27:15.720]  speech.
[27:15.720 --> 27:18.960]  So what I've been saying for a while is we need to look at the barriers to entry that
[27:18.960 --> 27:23.400]  government might be creating and see if we can allow them to other companies to bring
[27:23.400 --> 27:26.600]  up, not the government starting other companies, but the government getting out of the way
[27:26.600 --> 27:28.760]  to allow confidentiality with Facebook.
[27:28.760 --> 27:32.560]  I think if it gets so bad that they don't allow conservative viewpoints on Facebook,
[27:32.560 --> 27:36.400]  I think you will get to a point where people will leave in droves and go to other, and
[27:36.400 --> 27:40.440]  I think people already are, so if Facebook wants to continue to make money and they make
[27:40.440 --> 27:45.120]  lots of it, I would suggest to them that they really, really advocate to let conservative
[27:45.120 --> 27:50.240]  opinions and not to somehow censor conservative opinions, and you know, if they become so
[27:50.240 --> 27:55.760]  politically correct that any kind of conservative opinion is unacceptable, if you are opposed
[27:55.760 --> 27:59.600]  to open borders or something, that somehow hates speech or something, we're going to
[27:59.600 --> 28:03.160]  live in a world where people are eventually going to have to go somewhere else to communicate.
[28:03.160 --> 28:07.400]  Now, there's Rian Paul being very, very nice, showing he really knows what's happened when
[28:07.400 --> 28:10.400]  I come back with David and talk about it, but it came out today.
[28:10.400 --> 28:15.400]  In fact, I didn't see it in my stack of money, I can print that.
[28:15.400 --> 28:23.040]  Mark Zuckerberg approached the board of Facebook and wanted to remove President Trump in 2017
[28:23.040 --> 28:27.040]  from Facebook for not wanting to have open borders.
[28:27.040 --> 28:32.800]  That's the big globalist crime, saying you have a country, saying that yes, Trump's right
[28:32.800 --> 28:37.520]  to ban people from six nations that don't have real passports that are terror exporters
[28:37.520 --> 28:38.520]  from the country.
[28:38.520 --> 28:42.040]  One reason they said I was banned was the Islamophobia, yes, I'm afraid of Somalia
[28:42.040 --> 28:46.240]  and Sudan, where they don't even have, you know, electricity or running water and kill
[28:46.240 --> 28:51.640]  women, children that have sex slavery, being able to openly just fly here unvetted, yes,
[28:51.640 --> 28:53.600]  I think that's the right thing to do.
[28:53.600 --> 28:56.800]  So they want to ban everybody, let's get this straight, they want to abuse their power
[28:56.800 --> 28:58.200]  and they are.
[28:58.200 --> 29:04.400]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature, expand your horizons with

[29:28.720 --> 29:32.920]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[29:32.920 --> 29:36.920]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public
[29:36.920 --> 29:40.240]  but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[29:40.240 --> 29:45.160]  And what if the social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[29:45.160 --> 29:46.160]  There is.
[29:46.160 --> 29:47.160]  It's rightsocial.net.
[29:47.160 --> 29:48.160]  Rightsocial.net.
[29:48.160 --> 29:52.320]  A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order.
[29:52.320 --> 29:55.840]  Rightsocial.net, where you have the right to freely speak your mind.
[29:55.840 --> 29:56.840]  Rightsocial.net.
[29:56.840 --> 29:59.400]  The right place to be.
[29:59.400 --> 30:04.600]  Please, whatever you do realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship
[30:04.600 --> 30:08.720]  and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars, yes some of them
[30:08.720 --> 30:12.400]  are like little side accounts, they even know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed
[30:12.400 --> 30:17.160]  our products but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump
[30:17.160 --> 30:20.160]  rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[30:20.160 --> 30:23.680]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[30:23.680 --> 30:28.520]  and the world back from the brink but the globalists now want to target where the resistance
[30:28.520 --> 30:31.400]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[30:31.400 --> 30:34.480]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[30:34.480 --> 30:35.480]  I want to keep going.
[30:35.480 --> 30:40.560]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially, I want to push all
[30:40.560 --> 30:41.560]  the way.
[30:41.560 --> 30:42.720]  I've committed to do that.
[30:42.720 --> 30:46.720]  I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen but you've got a backish
[30:46.720 --> 30:48.320]  and I promise you this.
[30:48.320 --> 30:53.160]  I will never falter, I will never waver at the spiritual level, I physically will but
[30:53.160 --> 30:58.080]  I give you my commitment if you financially support us, InfoWarsFor.com to give you my
[30:58.080 --> 31:00.120]  absolute total commitment.
[31:00.120 --> 31:06.000]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[31:06.000 --> 31:09.320]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing, it's a good thing and I've had water filtration
[31:09.320 --> 31:14.160]  sponsors since the day I got on air and over the years I learned a lot about water filtration,
[31:14.160 --> 31:15.760]  I learned what the best was.
[31:15.760 --> 31:20.360]  Now the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons
[31:20.360 --> 31:21.360]  an hour.
[31:21.360 --> 31:22.360]  It's amazing.
[31:22.360 --> 31:24.280]  That's not all the bad stuff, it leaves the good stuff in the good minerals.
[31:24.280 --> 31:29.000]  That Red Hawk and the Patriots over at my Patreon supply that have developed these filters
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.040]  ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[31:31.040 --> 31:32.760]  He has a glut of them.
[31:32.760 --> 31:36.560]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[31:36.560 --> 31:38.160]  When it's discounted, it's $200.
[31:38.160 --> 31:39.160]  It's $127.
[31:39.160 --> 31:45.240]  He's selling them to us at cost and we're making $20 something bucks on them.
[31:45.240 --> 31:47.480]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[31:47.480 --> 31:49.720]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[31:49.720 --> 31:50.720]  It's amazing.
[31:50.720 --> 32:00.160]  Alexa Pure Pro at M4WarsLife.com or M4Store.com or call 888-253-3139.
[32:00.160 --> 32:04.200]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[32:04.200 --> 32:09.440]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[32:09.440 --> 32:14.520]  It literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[32:14.520 --> 32:19.240]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[32:19.240 --> 32:23.360]  This seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists
[32:23.360 --> 32:28.000]  tried to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure
[32:28.000 --> 32:30.160]  nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[32:30.160 --> 32:31.160]  That's been incredible.
[32:31.160 --> 32:36.560]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[32:36.560 --> 32:41.280]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists and others showed
[32:41.280 --> 32:46.280]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[32:46.280 --> 32:52.760]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[32:52.760 --> 32:55.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[32:55.880 --> 32:56.880]  discovery.
[32:56.880 --> 33:26.800]  We'll see you next time on X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[33:26.800 --> 33:28.560]  You want to stop tyranny?
[33:28.560 --> 33:37.520]  Well, so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:37.520 --> 33:39.280]  Take CNN, for example.
[33:39.280 --> 33:43.760]  It was CNN that almost single-handedly led the campaign to have broadcaster Alex Jones
[33:43.760 --> 33:48.800]  banished from the internet on the grounds that they didn't like what Jones had to say.
[33:48.800 --> 33:51.200]  Ultimately, CNN succeeded in doing that.
[33:51.200 --> 33:55.400]  The network convinced every major tech platform to ban Jones in its outlet, Infowars.
[33:55.400 --> 34:01.760]  You don't have to like Alex Jones to see that as a terrifying loss for free speech because
[34:01.760 --> 34:03.680]  it was exactly that.
[34:03.680 --> 34:06.440]  But CNN was not done trying to silence its critics.
[34:06.440 --> 34:11.040]  Last year, the cable network threatened an anonymous Reddit user for creating an anti-CNN
[34:11.040 --> 34:12.040]  meme.
[34:12.040 --> 34:17.040]  CNN threatened to expose his identity and ruin his life if it ever was criticized by him
[34:17.040 --> 34:18.040]  again.
[34:18.040 --> 34:22.560]  Now, CNN is claiming to defend free speech, only when it's their speech.
[34:22.560 --> 34:25.920]  You'll notice, by the way, that CNN did not object when the government threatened to
[34:25.920 --> 34:30.880]  imprison employees of the cable channel RT if they didn't register as foreign agents.
[34:30.880 --> 34:35.680]  Yes, RT is owned by a foreign government, so is the BBC.
[34:35.680 --> 34:38.680]  Until last year, much of the New York Times was owned by a foreign national.
[34:38.680 --> 34:42.840]  This is true of other news organizations, none of which has ever registered as a foreign
[34:42.840 --> 34:43.920]  agent.
[34:43.920 --> 34:48.600]  But because RT is owned by Russia, which the left believes got Donald Trump elected, it
[34:48.600 --> 34:52.520]  is fine with CNN if they are bullied and silenced.
[34:52.520 --> 34:56.760]  So call CNN what you will, but don't pretend they are defenders of the First Amendment.
[34:56.760 --> 34:57.760]  They are not.
[34:57.760 --> 35:03.520]  Now, I want to get David Knight's take on this, but understand, folks, it's not about
[35:03.520 --> 35:06.360]  a cost or this particular story.
[35:06.360 --> 35:09.280]  It's about the whole thing is a lie.
[35:09.280 --> 35:16.920]  And they're practicing lying now at a level 5, 10 times worse than before, 20 times.
[35:16.920 --> 35:21.800]  I don't know how to quantify, and they're doing it on every channel now, where they'll
[35:21.800 --> 35:28.840]  go on every channel and say Donald Trump hates all Mexicans, or Alex Jones is a Nazi, or
[35:28.840 --> 35:33.880]  Alex Jones just said, kill the press with battle rifles and then not show a clip.
[35:33.880 --> 35:40.080]  You understand that level of propaganda is super dangerous, and it shows they've converted
[35:40.080 --> 35:45.120]  the entire corporate press to levels of lying that are just staggering.
[35:45.120 --> 35:47.960]  They won't do anything.
[35:47.960 --> 35:49.320]  There is no caravan.
[35:49.320 --> 35:52.160]  I did not touch the woman.
[35:52.160 --> 35:53.960]  I did not know who she was.
[35:53.960 --> 35:55.640]  I only asked one question.
[35:55.640 --> 36:02.920]  Acosta has said all of this, and the press, the so-called press went, yes, yes.
[36:02.920 --> 36:04.520]  He did not touch the woman.
[36:04.520 --> 36:06.200]  He only asked one question.
[36:06.200 --> 36:08.320]  Jim Acosta is very polite.
[36:08.320 --> 36:11.360]  And then the federal judge said, I've got the ruling right here.
[36:11.360 --> 36:17.560]  Acosta has had his rights grossly violated, but Trump did it terrible to this man in this
[36:17.560 --> 36:18.560]  institution.
[36:18.560 --> 36:20.120]  He did not take an act however he wants.
[36:20.120 --> 36:23.080]  It actually says all this.
[36:23.080 --> 36:27.560]  So you've got the political class lined up against Trump, and I've got the articles
[36:27.560 --> 36:28.560]  right here.
[36:28.560 --> 36:32.640]  Sheryl Sandberg and other Facebook execs reportedly investigated if they could ban Trump after
[36:32.640 --> 36:36.360]  Zuck was appalled by his call for the Muslim ban.
[36:36.360 --> 36:37.640]  It wasn't a Muslim ban.
[36:37.640 --> 36:43.200]  It was six countries that don't even have working airports where imams give out a piece
[36:43.200 --> 36:50.280]  of paper saying who they are, and then they use it to bring terrorists in and smugglers.
[36:50.280 --> 36:51.280]  Unbelievable.
[36:51.280 --> 36:52.280]  Insane.
[36:52.280 --> 36:57.480]  Oh, look, could Twitter ban Trump for violating its terms of service?
[36:57.480 --> 37:00.400]  Company forced to explain why it hasn't.
[37:00.400 --> 37:02.760]  Twitter explains why it hasn't banned Trump, blah, blah, blah.
[37:02.760 --> 37:03.920]  Why haven't they banned Alex Jones?
[37:03.920 --> 37:05.520]  Oh, I guess they did.
[37:05.520 --> 37:10.640]  So the point is they're foaming at the mouth to get everybody's free speech, including
[37:10.640 --> 37:11.640]  the president.
[37:11.640 --> 37:16.680]  Under Obama, there were arresting reporters in mass and kicking on anybody that didn't
[37:16.680 --> 37:19.280]  endorse Obama.
[37:19.280 --> 37:20.280]  And they lie.
[37:20.280 --> 37:21.280]  It's more lies.
[37:21.280 --> 37:23.120]  They said he was kicked out of the press corps.
[37:23.120 --> 37:30.160]  No, they only took this hard pass where that disrupter could walk around like Frankenstein
[37:30.160 --> 37:35.160]  in the middle of the German forest harassing people at the White House 24-7.
[37:35.160 --> 37:36.600]  It's incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:36.600 --> 37:43.720]  So there's a lot of news, but we're covering this because a federal judge and a whole bunch
[37:43.720 --> 37:46.880]  of other federal judges said Trump can't control the borders.
[37:46.880 --> 37:50.720]  Now you've got Democrat Congresswoman like Camilla Harris of California.
[37:50.720 --> 37:56.160]  She ought to worry about it being on fire or the human feces everywhere or the bankruptcy.
[37:56.160 --> 37:58.600]  She says ICE is the KKK.
[37:58.600 --> 38:00.680]  That clip's coming up.
[38:00.680 --> 38:02.280]  This woman has guards at her house.
[38:02.280 --> 38:04.160]  This woman has guards at the Capitol.
[38:04.160 --> 38:07.880]  This woman, though, says our country itself can't have any border.
[38:07.880 --> 38:09.600]  That means you can't have a country.
[38:09.600 --> 38:12.160]  Remember, nationalism's dirty.
[38:12.160 --> 38:13.640]  Nationalism's bad.
[38:13.640 --> 38:14.720]  Nationalism's something that's evil.
[38:14.720 --> 38:15.720]  You can't have it.
[38:15.720 --> 38:17.720]  Of course, they're not getting rid of the nation.
[38:17.720 --> 38:19.120]  They're just conquering it.
[38:19.120 --> 38:23.920]  I mean, it would be nice to take on this at the end of this segment and next segment,
[38:23.920 --> 38:27.240]  and then we'll look ahead on who else is joining us today and all the other incredible news
[38:27.240 --> 38:28.240]  that's coming up.
[38:28.240 --> 38:33.320]  But before I go any further, we're going to win this fight.
[38:33.320 --> 38:36.880]  And because the globalists have been caught lying, what they've decided to do is just
[38:36.880 --> 38:41.960]  muddy the waters with so much lying, you get conditioned to just accept it.
[38:41.960 --> 38:44.680]  That's all they're doing right now is cult programming.
[38:44.680 --> 38:47.000]  And it's working on some people.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  It's not working on others.
[38:48.000 --> 38:49.000]  They're trying to murder logic.
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.040]  And they're trying to destroy any institution that will stand up and point out they're lying.
[38:53.040 --> 38:54.280]  You know what I hate them for?
[38:54.280 --> 39:00.240]  It's because we'll show you a stack of history of how Obama was hundreds of times meaner
[39:00.240 --> 39:01.680]  to the press than Trump.
[39:01.680 --> 39:02.840]  Trump fights back.
[39:02.840 --> 39:04.880]  He lets the press run wild.
[39:04.880 --> 39:12.320]  Obama had him by the neck, absolutely dominating and controlling him like a pimp.
[39:12.320 --> 39:17.360]  It's just insane how they get ratings and money off Trump and they get stardom off Trump.
[39:17.360 --> 39:20.480]  If people tune back in because of Trump, they exist because of Trump.
[39:20.480 --> 39:21.840]  And then they hate the very part.
[39:21.840 --> 39:24.880]  It's like the New York Times hating Drudge Report and the Washington Post, how do we
[39:24.880 --> 39:26.080]  shut down Drudge Report?
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.480]  He gives too many links to Info Wars and Daily Caller, meanwhile half their traffic comes
[39:30.480 --> 39:31.480]  from Drudge.
[39:31.480 --> 39:35.160]  They hate the very thing that lifts us up.
[39:35.160 --> 39:36.160]  It's unbelievable.
[39:36.160 --> 39:38.960]  Briefly, before I go back to David, he'll tell us what's coming up next segment.
[39:38.960 --> 39:41.560]  He's got a lot to say on this.
[39:41.560 --> 39:45.840]  Please financially support Info Wars and get great products at the same time.
[39:45.840 --> 39:50.160]  We have a huge special on 67% off on colloidal silver.
[39:50.160 --> 39:51.280]  That's at cost.
[39:51.280 --> 39:57.440]  We have 57% off on supermode vitality, 50% off on X3, the new better formula than X2.
[39:57.440 --> 39:58.440]  It's amazing.
[39:58.440 --> 40:03.240]  10 store-wide free shipping, that's on the apparel, Alexa Pure Breeze because they ordered
[40:03.240 --> 40:04.240]  too many.
[40:04.240 --> 40:08.160]  The very best gravity filter out there, competitors are $350, it's normally $240.
[40:08.160 --> 40:12.040]  It's 127, the lowest price ever for inventory for the year.
[40:12.040 --> 40:13.480]  You cannot beat that price.
[40:13.480 --> 40:14.480]  Get one for yourself.
[40:14.480 --> 40:15.480]  Get one for family.
[40:15.480 --> 40:16.640]  It is an amazing gift.
[40:16.640 --> 40:18.200]  You cannot get a better deal.
[40:18.200 --> 40:24.480]  Clean up your water and fund the Info War, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com or AAA 253-3139.
[40:24.480 --> 40:28.800]  David, I'm ranting here and I'm going to let you roll next time because you've got a lot
[40:28.800 --> 40:33.520]  to say on this, but how do you quantify what's happening here?
[40:33.520 --> 40:37.600]  This acceleration of the line on purpose in front of everyone.
[40:37.600 --> 40:38.600]  What is the point?
[40:38.600 --> 40:42.320]  Well, Alex, one level is racketeering.
[40:42.320 --> 40:45.640]  It's racketeering by the mainstream media and it's racketeering by the social media
[40:45.640 --> 40:48.080]  oligarchs at a Silicon Valley.
[40:48.080 --> 40:49.920]  They're trying to demonetize any of their competition.
[40:49.920 --> 40:55.080]  It was just yesterday, they took away PayPal from Bitshoot and of course they tried to
[40:55.080 --> 40:57.840]  do that same thing with Gab, even take them off of the internet.
[40:57.840 --> 41:00.920]  This is the level of persecution as you pointed out before.
[41:00.920 --> 41:04.760]  They're able to put out anything no matter how obvious their lie.
[41:04.760 --> 41:08.120]  When they talk about this whole thing with Jim Acosta and say, he didn't touch her.
[41:08.120 --> 41:10.200]  No, look, you sped up the video and so forth.
[41:10.200 --> 41:12.800]  People can do their own experiment.
[41:12.800 --> 41:14.720]  Everybody's got video editors on their computer now.
[41:14.720 --> 41:18.280]  All they have to do is just take their original source and just zoom it in and put the two
[41:18.280 --> 41:21.080]  side by side and you can see how it looks.
[41:21.080 --> 41:22.080]  Don't believe us.
[41:22.080 --> 41:23.080]  Don't believe your lying eyes.
[41:23.080 --> 41:25.400]  You don't believe CNN and the rest of the mainstream media.
[41:25.400 --> 41:30.160]  It's absolutely amazing how these people collude together to push these lies.
[41:30.160 --> 41:32.560]  That's why we need people like Julian Assange.
[41:32.560 --> 41:37.160]  That's why we need people like John Kiriakou that I spoke to in the last half hour of
[41:37.160 --> 41:38.440]  my program.
[41:38.440 --> 41:42.400]  He's exposing the crimes of these people.
[41:42.400 --> 41:47.200]  Under the Espionage Act of 1917, Barack Obama locked up more people who were whistleblowers
[41:47.200 --> 41:51.760]  and journalists than all the presidents before him combined.
[41:51.760 --> 41:56.040]  Under that, they came after John Kiriakou and at the center of all that was John Brennan.
[41:56.040 --> 41:59.400]  After they arrested him, after the Bush administration said, no, he didn't do anything.
[41:59.400 --> 42:02.680]  We're going to look at whether or not his whistleblowing about torture violated any
[42:02.680 --> 42:03.680]  rules.
[42:03.680 --> 42:04.680]  They said, no, we're not going to prosecute him.
[42:04.680 --> 42:09.040]  Brennan gets in with Obama and he found out with the memos that Brennan said, charge him
[42:09.040 --> 42:10.040]  with espionage.
[42:10.040 --> 42:11.680]  They said, he didn't commit any espionage.
[42:11.680 --> 42:14.880]  They said, charge him with it in any way and make him defend himself.
[42:14.880 --> 42:15.880]  What did he do?
[42:15.880 --> 42:22.000]  He went to these same people, Mueller, Strock, ran a sting on him, trying to get him involved
[42:22.000 --> 42:23.920]  and then trap him into an espionage thing.
[42:23.920 --> 42:24.920]  He didn't do it.
[42:24.920 --> 42:25.920]  He was honest.
[42:25.920 --> 42:26.920]  And they've done it.
[42:26.920 --> 42:27.920]  They did it to William Benning.
[42:27.920 --> 42:28.920]  They've tried it on me.
[42:28.920 --> 42:29.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[42:29.920 --> 42:30.920]  They mean Benning.
[42:30.920 --> 42:32.960]  When we come back, though, I was going to mention this as a segment and you brought it up the
[42:32.960 --> 42:34.680]  key what Rand Paul was hitting at.
[42:34.680 --> 42:37.160]  He goes, hey, people ought to build their own thing.
[42:37.160 --> 42:41.360]  They're trying to destroy every alternative to Facebook and Google.
[42:41.360 --> 42:43.360]  They're going after Brighton.
[42:43.360 --> 42:44.640]  They're going after Info Wars.
[42:44.640 --> 42:45.640]  They're going after us.
[42:45.640 --> 42:48.440]  That's why the listeners and viewers must stand with us more than ever.
[42:48.440 --> 42:51.560]  This is a fight for America and our very birthright, folks.
[42:51.560 --> 42:54.920]  We are fighting true international authoritarianism.
[42:54.920 --> 42:55.920]  Spread those live links.
[42:55.920 --> 42:56.920]  That's how you fight back.
[42:56.920 --> 42:59.520]  Stay with us.
[42:59.520 --> 43:03.400]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[43:03.400 --> 43:07.920]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[43:07.920 --> 43:13.360]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[43:13.360 --> 43:18.760]  Big ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[43:18.760 --> 43:20.280]  to unhealthy levels.
[43:20.280 --> 43:26.800]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[43:26.800 --> 43:30.800]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[43:30.800 --> 43:32.120]  in the rainwater.
[43:32.120 --> 43:37.480]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter and not only were the heavy
[43:37.480 --> 43:43.600]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[43:43.600 --> 43:49.200]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[43:49.200 --> 43:54.560]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[43:54.560 --> 43:59.680]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[43:59.680 --> 44:02.160]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[44:02.160 --> 44:07.720]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your
[44:07.720 --> 44:08.720]  mood.
[44:08.720 --> 44:10.400]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[45:00.440 --> 45:04.840]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[45:04.840 --> 45:09.520]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[45:09.520 --> 45:11.040]  to detoxify the body.
[45:11.040 --> 45:15.920]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[45:15.920 --> 45:17.440]  It's made in the USA.
[45:17.440 --> 45:22.360]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[45:22.360 --> 45:24.200]  the body and it supports the infowar.
[45:24.200 --> 45:26.440]  It is a classical 360 win.
[45:26.440 --> 45:30.920]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[45:30.920 --> 45:35.600]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[45:35.600 --> 45:36.600]  get.
[45:36.600 --> 45:39.800]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[45:39.800 --> 45:44.840]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[45:44.840 --> 45:50.080]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[45:50.080 --> 45:53.920]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[45:53.920 --> 45:54.920]  prayers together.
[45:54.920 --> 45:55.920]  We're changing the world.
[45:55.920 --> 46:00.480]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and InfowarsLive.com.
[46:00.480 --> 46:05.880]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[46:05.880 --> 46:10.080]  Infowars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[46:10.080 --> 46:14.240]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[46:14.240 --> 46:17.440]  People say, well, I would just start a fight with them because they were already dominating
[46:17.440 --> 46:20.920]  and running America into the ground and I knew we had no future.
[46:20.920 --> 46:21.920]  We didn't do this.
[46:21.920 --> 46:26.880]  So we've already had incredible success, but if you will simply realize how epic this
[46:26.880 --> 46:32.120]  is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target and if
[46:32.120 --> 46:38.080]  you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, Infowars.com,
[46:38.080 --> 46:43.000]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.640]  We have huge sales at InfowarsLive.com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping
[46:47.640 --> 46:52.360]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce
[46:52.360 --> 46:53.360]  and you're right to the market.
[46:53.360 --> 46:56.640]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Global will stay with
[46:56.640 --> 46:57.640]  you.
[46:57.640 --> 46:58.640]  This is Infowars Darker Tower.
[46:58.640 --> 46:59.640]  We're your support.
[46:59.640 --> 47:00.640]  I'm counting on you.
[47:00.640 --> 47:06.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:06.640 --> 47:32.240]  So what the corporate collaborator globalist press is doing is they know the world government's
[47:32.240 --> 47:33.240]  out in the open.
[47:33.240 --> 47:34.240]  They know they're getting rid of our freedoms.
[47:34.240 --> 47:39.240]  They know they're consolidating control of information all over the world.
[47:39.240 --> 47:43.560]  There's a global social score market to be system rolling out and Reuters today is coming
[47:43.560 --> 47:44.560]  to Latin America.
[47:44.560 --> 47:48.440]  China is putting it in our own media and government's bringing it in as well.
[47:48.440 --> 47:50.480]  Trump's trying to block it.
[47:50.480 --> 47:54.120]  They create false consensus where all the corporate media says Jim Acosta didn't touch
[47:54.120 --> 47:55.120]  the woman.
[47:55.120 --> 47:58.960]  All the corporate media says Trump's in a war against the press when it was Obama and
[47:58.960 --> 48:02.880]  they create a false consensus and there's another tactic we're going to David Knight
[48:02.880 --> 48:08.560]  on this tactic where you don't want to be under the unelected TPP.
[48:08.560 --> 48:13.120]  So they just say there is no TPP doesn't matter they're having negotiations on C-span doesn't
[48:13.120 --> 48:14.840]  matter parts of it leak.
[48:14.840 --> 48:16.400]  They go it doesn't exist.
[48:16.400 --> 48:21.720]  Crazy people say there's a TPP and that's into 21 and something called globalism.
[48:21.720 --> 48:25.560]  Why I mean the day after Trump got elected they had articles going.
[48:25.560 --> 48:30.160]  What is this term globalism and who made it up and it was whole articles about it's insane.
[48:30.160 --> 48:31.160]  It doesn't exist.
[48:31.160 --> 48:34.800]  It doesn't matter there are thousands of books written about globalism David Rockefeller
[48:34.800 --> 48:36.120]  called himself a globalist.
[48:36.120 --> 48:38.240]  They've been using the term for 50 years.
[48:38.240 --> 48:40.040]  It doesn't mean they want a global government.
[48:40.040 --> 48:46.360]  It's here but they just change the subject so you're always debating whether or not it
[48:46.360 --> 48:51.700]  even exists instead of acting on it like oh massive censorship is being concerted for
[48:51.700 --> 48:55.880]  election meddling against nationalists and conservatives and others across the world
[48:55.880 --> 49:00.720]  and it's admitted it's going on and leaders of Google and others have done press conferences
[49:00.720 --> 49:04.600]  two years ago saying Trump won we're not going to let it happen again and documents came
[49:04.600 --> 49:08.240]  out saying we're going to suppress nationalists and conservatives.
[49:08.240 --> 49:13.520]  The good censorship is what they called it so instead of having a debate in Congress
[49:13.520 --> 49:19.520]  they just go up and deny it the media denies it even as they call for it and then the senators
[49:19.520 --> 49:26.120]  go okay gee you're not doing it and everyone plays along like this isn't happening because
[49:26.120 --> 49:31.520]  members of Congress know if they really come out against this they're going to be targeted
[49:31.520 --> 49:36.080]  and everyone else is a coward except Donald John Trump.
[49:36.080 --> 49:40.120]  Rand Paul starts to come out a little bit and you guys ought to stop this it's a little
[49:40.120 --> 49:43.120]  naughty now.
[49:43.120 --> 49:46.800]  Matt Gaetz says oh you can censor whoever you want they totally shadowed that in the
[49:46.800 --> 49:49.480]  next day because he green lighted it.
[49:49.480 --> 49:52.680]  Everyone thinks you're going to pack this authoritarianism on the head it's a global
[49:52.680 --> 49:58.360]  authoritarian race by the chai comms and the big tech companies and the big banks and the
[49:58.360 --> 50:02.920]  EU and others there's a big global race and our military is not even involved in that
[50:02.920 --> 50:07.520]  race so Google is like we're not even going to talk to you or help you shut up.
[50:07.520 --> 50:12.840]  Total disrespect of our country and of everything and here comes Trump saying this is a bad
[50:12.840 --> 50:17.480]  deal why are we acting like chumps and all these traders and sellouts go oh he's the
[50:17.480 --> 50:22.600]  bad guy get rid of him and Alex Jones and any of his supporters well you know what I'm
[50:22.600 --> 50:27.120]  not sticking my neck out for Trump I'm sticking it out for my own family and everybody else
[50:27.120 --> 50:32.520]  because I'm not sticking it out sticking your neck out is going along with this that's crazy
[50:32.520 --> 50:37.160]  so shame on all the cowards out there I want to get David Knight's take on this but here's
[50:37.160 --> 50:42.040]  President Trump again last week saying that's not doctoring and again that's he's saying
[50:42.040 --> 50:46.280]  two plus two equals four which is a revolutionary act here it is.
[50:46.280 --> 50:51.720]  All that was nobody manipulated it give me a break see that's just dishonest reporting
[50:51.720 --> 50:57.320]  all that is is a close up see that's just that is just dishonest reporting I watched
[50:57.320 --> 51:02.200]  that I heard that last night they made it close up they showed it close up and he was
[51:02.200 --> 51:07.200]  not nice to that young woman I don't hold him for that because it wasn't overly you
[51:07.200 --> 51:12.400]  know horrible but it was but all that was when you say doctor you're a dishonest guy
[51:12.400 --> 51:17.080]  because it wasn't doctored they gave a close up view that's not doctoring.
[51:17.080 --> 51:22.440]  A federal judge says the cost has been abused gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation
[51:22.440 --> 51:27.080]  that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a target individual or in members of a targeted group
[51:27.080 --> 51:32.800]  making them question their own memory perception insanity using persistent denial misdirection
[51:32.800 --> 51:39.200]  contradiction and lying that attempts to destabilize the victim and delegitimize the victims belief
[51:39.200 --> 51:45.700]  it's used by the CIA and other intelligence agencies we are watching the total gaslighting
[51:45.700 --> 51:52.040]  of the free world by naked tyrants day of the night what do we do yeah you're absolutely
[51:52.040 --> 51:57.800]  right Alex and they want to get back to the day when they just had ABC CBS NBC and NPR
[51:57.800 --> 52:01.440]  and they could all say the same thing they had the major newspapers they would all say
[52:01.440 --> 52:04.320]  the same thing operation mockingbird you know the government would give them their talking
[52:04.320 --> 52:10.880]  points if they want to retain access to the people who are powerful and in Washington
[52:10.880 --> 52:16.200]  then they would not buck that system and now we've got new management at Fox News and they
[52:16.200 --> 52:20.800]  want to be part of that system and they have been invited by the new masters of our speech
[52:20.800 --> 52:25.320]  the corporations yeah one of the things that I find interesting about this Alex is that
[52:25.320 --> 52:31.040]  you've got the left who hate all corporations and you would think that they would be suspicious
[52:31.040 --> 52:34.720]  of the idea that we're going to let the major corporations decide what we can and cannot
[52:34.720 --> 52:39.200]  say and yet they fall in line because they're so blinded by their partisanship that they
[52:39.200 --> 52:42.360]  fall in line with this and they go that's a good thing it's a private property and so
[52:42.360 --> 52:46.840]  forth no it's not you know as I said before the White House is not the public square
[52:46.840 --> 52:52.240]  Tucker the Supreme Court rules these companies are our our public square they know it under
[52:52.240 --> 52:57.520]  law they're protected from third-party stuff because they say they're a public commons
[52:57.520 --> 53:01.680]  and only criminal activity should be blocked but they jump back and forth and Congress
[53:01.680 --> 53:05.520]  acts like they're ignorant that's right and and we've had a Supreme Court decision back
[53:05.520 --> 53:11.320]  in 1946 Marsh versus Alabama they threw a Jehovah's Witness off of a company owned town but they
[53:11.320 --> 53:15.960]  said but she was standing in the public square of that town and even if you own that privately
[53:15.960 --> 53:19.520]  it's still the public square and you can't do that they pretend that that doesn't happen
[53:19.520 --> 53:23.280]  now even though Jack Dorsey said that he did that you pointed out that Facebook said well
[53:23.280 --> 53:28.960]  we'll take off we might take off President Trump back in 2017 earlier this year we had
[53:28.960 --> 53:33.200]  Jack Dorsey at Twitter say I might take Trump off of this so we've got federal judges telling
[53:33.200 --> 53:38.520]  Trump that he can't remove trolls off of his personal account his personal account but
[53:38.520 --> 53:44.000]  that they can remove him off of the entire thing that's what that I think that in Catholic
[53:44.000 --> 53:48.000]  saying is they're gonna put a gag in our mouth change this up and then let us get pilloried
[53:48.000 --> 53:53.000]  the town square this is how it works I can't set foot on any of these big platforms where
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.280]  I'm being lied about where I'm being attacked where the Google searches are only giving
[53:56.280 --> 54:01.240]  the negative I can't even respond when they call me a Nazi you know all these names I
[54:01.240 --> 54:06.760]  can't even respond and that's the key to the censorship and then they want to take away
[54:06.760 --> 54:12.320]  this platform we have so our listeners can respond for us my only voice David's only
[54:12.320 --> 54:17.240]  voice outside of this broadcast is you listeners and viewers and again if they can get us they
[54:17.240 --> 54:20.920]  can get everybody this is an epic battle folks and everybody else is scared I mean I'll
[54:20.920 --> 54:26.960]  say it everybody else but Matt Drudge and Donald Trump and Alex Jones and David Knight
[54:26.960 --> 54:32.520]  and Tucker Carlson and a few others are willing to stand up everybody else is scared and it's
[54:32.520 --> 54:37.920]  this the instinct to be a slave is now taking this country over and people praise us for
[54:37.920 --> 54:43.160]  standing up praise us this is what you're supposed to do you should instinctively be
[54:43.160 --> 54:49.760]  madder than a bull in a china chop over this type of raping of our birthright every time
[54:49.760 --> 54:56.520]  this happens incredible horrors follow guaranteed the chai comms are working with the dims to
[54:56.520 --> 55:02.960]  build total control grids in America it's in Reuters today folks we're in trouble and
[55:02.960 --> 55:07.400]  everybody else goes yeah we're in trouble let's roll over and show our yellow bellies
[55:07.400 --> 55:13.160]  to the globalist not me not what the hell is wrong with people let me tell you how bad
[55:13.160 --> 55:19.640]  this is Alex when I was talking to John Kiriakou he pointed out that in 2014 Chuck Grassley
[55:19.640 --> 55:23.520]  who is not just a senator but he's had the judiciary committee he realized that they
[55:23.520 --> 55:28.480]  were illegally spying on him and on other people and it was a crime it was a it was
[55:28.480 --> 55:35.840]  an order that was co-signed by Brennan and Clapper and didn't just create felonies every
[55:35.840 --> 55:40.560]  time finally in the news confirm we reported years ago but it also violated the separation
[55:40.560 --> 55:45.520]  of powers but it's not even the executive it was its own rogue groups criminally spying
[55:45.520 --> 55:50.800]  on their overseers and so what they did was they class that they committed a crime and
[55:50.800 --> 55:55.760]  then they classified that crime and told him you can't talk about it now Grassley could
[55:55.760 --> 55:59.680]  have talked about it he didn't have the courage to talk about it he had immunity he could
[55:59.680 --> 56:04.960]  have talked about it and not be prosecuted people like John Kiriakou did not have immunity
[56:04.960 --> 56:09.880]  and he talked about it he went to jail and they tried to give him a plea bargain he said
[56:09.880 --> 56:13.000]  I'm not gonna do it I didn't violate any laws here and they said we're just trying to minimize
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.920]  damage and that's what Grassley's known so for four years he was silent about it and
[56:17.920 --> 56:24.200]  then he got the new people and the administration and CIA whatever to declassify it so he talks
[56:24.200 --> 56:27.920]  about it nobody covers it basically on November but that is the good news because of all the
[56:27.920 --> 56:32.160]  Khashoggi stuff that Grassley was intimidated for years but now that Trump's in Trump's
[56:32.160 --> 56:36.120]  really trying to reform this that's another example I mean I don't think we can really
[56:36.120 --> 56:42.760]  there's no courage even in the Senate I don't think we can over qualify how special Trump
[56:42.760 --> 56:47.160]  is I mean that's why they're so scared of him yeah yeah absolutely I mean we've got
[56:47.160 --> 56:51.920]  to have the situation as you're pointing out it's not dangerous to stand up to these people
[56:51.920 --> 56:57.160]  it's dangerous to not stand up to them it's even greater for us if we if we capitulate
[56:57.160 --> 57:02.000]  to this and we talk about free pass free press and free speech we have to understand that
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.040]  there's a difference you know when we talk about the free press it's what you are allowed
[57:05.040 --> 57:10.800]  to see and hear right but also they're coming after free speech and that is what they're
[57:10.800 --> 57:15.120]  doing on social media when they try to gag President Trump as an individual citizen
[57:15.120 --> 57:20.600]  or when they gag millions of people taking them off of social media we've got an organization
[57:20.600 --> 57:25.360]  out there that is working with the DCC the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee
[57:25.360 --> 57:30.560]  they bragged about the fact they banned 10,000 they said we got another 80,000 80 to 90,000
[57:30.560 --> 57:33.720]  that we're going to ban as well because we just call them bots or we say they're hateful
[57:33.720 --> 57:38.960]  or whatever stay right there like this is so critical just six months ago they said
[57:38.960 --> 57:42.480]  oh people are violating rules or terms now they just say we don't like any nationalist
[57:42.480 --> 57:46.240]  or conservatives we're going to ban hundreds of thousands now and they have security meetings
[57:46.240 --> 57:50.600]  in Berlin with the CIA bragging about it you need to support independent media that's

[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:22.520]  alex jones sometimes i feel i've got to run away i've got to get away from the pain you
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:31.880]  know david night and i are just apoplectic because it's it's so insanely obvious that
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:40.160]  there is a global corporate takeover destroying speech everywhere and we can't seem to get
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:44.640]  the general public to realize how much danger they're in the president gets it he understands
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.520]  it and then he's under incredible attack and now because we've got trump in there and other
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:53.680]  nationalists are getting elected the authoritarians are throwing everything they've got against
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:01.000]  us now and it's basically going to cause a quickening of the authoritarianism and and
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.840]  maybe that's a good thing is it'll wake people up i don't know david other other points on
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:09.560]  all this we know alex we're talking about what's happening in florida and georgia arizona
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.000]  and so forth these guys don't give up when they lose an election they're not giving
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.880]  up about brexit they're not giving up about president trump's election they never quit
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:23.080]  but they are able to use the media and the connections that they have their you know as
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:27.360]  i was saying before it's strange to see the left saying we're going to allow these giant
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.600]  corporations to censor everybody's speech and be and decide what you're going to be
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.040]  able to say and not say and they accept that because these big corporations saying we're
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:40.840]  with you on political correctness we're with you on the transgender agenda or whatever any
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.920]  kind of identity politics stuff yeah we check all those boxes however what they don't realize
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:51.080]  is that they're also working hand in glove with the military industrial complex with
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.680]  nato with the atlantic council and all these neocons that are out there they're also running
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.560]  this because they are also globalists so this whole thing about identity politics and political
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:05.000]  correctness that silicon valley buys into that puts a nice veneer on it for the left
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.440]  and they like that they want that people censored on the basis of that but they don't realize
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:14.040]  that the larger issue here is that the globalists are coming back against everybody that's defeating
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:19.160]  them whether it's in britain with the uk of the brexit or whether it's president tromp
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.920]  or whether it's some of these other countries that are trying to defend themselves as you
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:30.240]  saw with the manuel macron the last week pushing back against anybody who wants to have some
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.800]  say so and control over their lives so they will use any tactic any technique and these
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:38.840]  people are just embracing that it's absolutely amazing to see this tyranny where they're
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.640]  able to come after people and they're as i said before they're bragging about it we're
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.680]  not going to stop at social media we're not going to stop until we demonetize people we're
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:52.360]  not going to stop until we absolutely kick off their websites off of the internet david
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.160]  we know where they're going it's in roiders today we first broke this almost six years
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:02.320]  ago venezuela is releasing an id card that can track and punish citizens and the chinese
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:07.200]  government chinese telecom giant is building venezuela's social credit system this is the
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.560]  global system china is exporting it google and others are working with them and google
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.440]  won't even work with the pentagon now the decision has been made to go to authoritarianism
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:23.720]  and if trump can stop this he can stop the entire global takeover this must be stopped
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:29.360]  now this system is is is the beginning of the end and if we can't hold the line here
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.360]  there is no hope you know alex you said google won't work with pentagon and so forth they
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:39.160]  won't show up for congressional hearings just like clapper and brennan won't show up when
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.680]  they're you know they're they're asked to come in and talk about these are the people
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:46.240]  who really are the government because they can tell the senators hey we're not gonna
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.960]  work with you we're not gonna work with the pentagon we're not gonna work with the senators
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:55.280]  we're in charge here the corporations and the cia that are running this situation and
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.960]  that's what's so scary about all this stuff is that the that the american people are not
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.720]  getting some of this information even when you have this simple little thing with jimacosta
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.000]  and president trump it is so obvious it's so apparent you can see the video they can
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.320]  run the experiment themselves do it on their own editor everybody's got a little i movie
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:17.400]  editor on their computer or the equivalent on on a pc's they can prove it to themselves
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.040]  but they're not interested enough or they don't have enough time and they only hear
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:28.320]  that same echo chamber that is coming out over and over again that's what's uh so

[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:40.520]  resistance you're listening to alex jones we are the heart of the resistance because
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:45.600]  other people were scared or they thought how do you do that how do you build your own radio
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.080]  tv network how do you resist how do you get a populist president elected well we did it
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:56.680]  you did it the audience did it our affiliates did it our sponsors did it god did it and
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:02.880]  now here we are under total attack the enemy was arrogant before the corporate press because
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.560]  they wanted all the advertising money we didn't even care about it tried to act like talk radio
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:11.240]  didn't exist you know had a bigger audience than all corporate news combined and then
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:15.760]  finally when hillary lost and they saw populist winning all over the world they said that's
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:20.200]  it shut the free speech down now and they go that'll wake them up faster no we'll just
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:27.440]  deny it to congress which is its own giant scandal and you know out of the 25 members
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:32.040]  of the e you only two countries ever had votes to enter the e you and they thought those were
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:37.200]  trade deals just like the i am at the world bank world trade organization the trans specific
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:41.840]  partnership the north american union was supposed to the trans no american partnership all these
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:49.320]  different systems more north american trade deals they're really signing your sovereignty
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:54.720]  over these international corporate boards and the e you is there to suck europe dry get
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.800]  rid of the nation states in their own words and now set up an e you army we first talked
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:05.400]  about decades ago to block any nation states trying to pull out during the financial implosion
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:11.480]  of the nations and then third world populations are brought in and weaponized put on welfare
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:19.120]  so they can burn down any city at the snap of a finger and the journey towards total
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:25.000]  enslavement is then complete so paul watson who is a member of u kip and works on their
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.920]  strategy committee has been for the last two days at parliament nonstop he came back last
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.200]  night file this report i just talked to him earlier we're gonna be getting him on the
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:43.400]  show but there are big developments and just like they do here we vote something and they
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:50.040]  just didn't ignore it the swamp and the bureaucracy just ignores it so paul's father report the
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:58.840]  truth about brexit then we're going to get into illegal aliens funded by the un called
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.360]  migrants are scaling the u.s. mexico fence will they be arrested our reporters have just
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:11.560]  arrived on the scene that's going to be coming up later live as well also illegal aliens
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:15.520]  are involved in more vicious crimes rapes shootouts with police and the media won't
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:19.720]  even say they're illegal but we found the evidence and we have the shocking dash cam
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:26.240]  video of that coming up but camilla harris of the democrat from california a member
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:35.120]  of congress she says any border is kkk that is all coming up and the big news is the world
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:40.760]  system that's now being put in place for the cashless society roiders is now reporting
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:49.280]  on it meanwhile national guard soldier arrested charged with smuggling mexican nationals into
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:56.480]  the u.s. yes the treason runs deep the treason of people involved in human smuggling and
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:05.400]  selling the nation out big business doing this ladies and gentlemen it's all coming
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:13.040]  up please don't forget news wars dot com present planet dot com info wars dot com those are
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:19.480]  the sites the globalist work around the clock to try to ban and block why because we're
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.520]  pointing out that our country's under attack and the globalist that are coming in are totally
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:29.480]  authoritarian don't pay taxes and are above the law and it's a nightmare system we're
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.920]  not just getting conquered by something that's better we're being conquered by something
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:39.840]  absolutely horrible so that's coming up as well and then communist china officially
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:45.560]  moves in to latin america with the global id system and the cashless society mark of
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:50.960]  the b social credit system roiders is even reporting it but first here is paul joseph
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.320]  watchin's report the truth about brexit and some will say we'll see they passed it three
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:02.520]  years ago and it's blocked and the bureaucrats won't do it but ten years ago you couldn't
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:06.960]  get people to even admit that the uk was in the e you they did it by stealth and five
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:12.160]  years ago people didn't believe that they never voted to not be part of it and three
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.800]  years ago they voted to get out of it now they're saying you can't get out of it that's
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:19.040]  the beginning of the end once people learn their rule by outside and elected powers here's
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:24.760]  paul joseph watchin let's just be honest this whole thing was designed to fail from the
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:30.680]  very beginning to reason may never intended to dignify the referendum result i warned
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:35.960]  that they were gonna stab us all in the back from day one to reason may deliberately negotiated
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:41.520]  a crappy deal knowing it would be rejected so as to create the pretext for cancelling
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:47.320]  brexit if you enter into a negotiation with no limits on the length to which you'll compromise
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:53.360]  that's not a negotiation that's a capitulation that's surrender from the start this has
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:59.680]  been one long process in managed surrender my right honorable friend and she is unquestionably
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:08.080]  honorable said that we would leave the customs union annex to says otherwise my right honorable
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:13.920]  friend said that she would maintain the integrity of the united kingdom a whole protocol says
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.480]  otherwise my right honorable friend said that we would be out of the jurisdiction of the
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:27.960]  european court of justice after 174 says otherwise as what my right honorable friend says and
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:32.480]  what my right honorable friend does no longer match this is not brexit this is a failure
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:37.160]  of government policy it needs to be rejected i mean for god's sake her chief negotiator
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:43.440]  the guy cutting the deal ollie robbins was a staunch communist who defended starlin what
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:49.480]  did you expect now to reason may is threatening no brexit whatsoever if her sandwich of a
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:54.360]  deal gets rejected which it will and that was the plan all along i knew this is what
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.640]  would happen because it's a tried and tested e u model give people the illusion of choice
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:05.520]  the facsimile of democracy let them vote but if their vote defies the e u just sabotage
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:11.080]  the process or make them vote again and again and again until you get the result you want
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:15.760]  citizens across the continent voted to reject the mass trick treaty to reject the knees
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:22.040]  treaty to reject the e u constitution to reject the lisbon treaty to reject the euro bailout
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:28.400]  every time the votes were ignored emphasizing the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.360]  the european union we are being asked to sign up to a deal that doesn't really give
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:39.080]  us brexit that portrays the greatest democratic exercise in this country but i have to say
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:45.160]  tonight i'm feeling more optimistic i'm seeing the resignations i think we're getting close
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:50.760]  to the end of the worst and most duplicitous prime minister in british history and that
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.280]  like it was a chance for a fresh start this is also about punishing the uk to intimidate
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:00.560]  other european countries out of pursuing their own form of brexit this is nothing less than
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:06.520]  a complete and total betrayal of democracy we didn't vote to sign up to everything under
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:13.240]  a different name and be the e u's bitch we voted to leave the e u this deal de facto keeps
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:20.240]  us in the e u but with no say and no influence it turns us into a slave state and on top
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:25.400]  of that we're handing over 39 billion pounds for the privilege where the prostitutes in
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:30.000]  this exchange where the ones getting bent over and screwed yet we're paying them this
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.760]  deal is so awful that we'd be better off staying in the e u and that was the plan all along
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:41.760]  now they're going to push for a second referendum which includes the option of cancelling brexit
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:46.520]  an option that will serve as a death sentence for the very notion of great britain as a
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:51.920]  democratic country having stuck in the knife may in her globalist cabal and are twisting
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:57.240]  it by putting the country at risk of the chilling prospect of being ruled by jeremy
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:03.240]  corbin a terrorist sympathiser who thinks that venezuelan socialist dystopia is a model
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:08.320]  for the world the choice is now clear we stand up for the united kingdom the whole of the
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.920]  united kingdom the integrity of the united kingdom or we vote for a vassal state with
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.440]  the breakup of the united that's the reason they never represented the interests of the
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:25.400]  united kingdom to begin with so how on earth is she still in power this is it this is our
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:30.960]  last chance to appoint a leader whose loyalties lie with their country not with a gaggle of
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:36.400]  odious technocrats in brussels this is the last chance for britain to avoid disappearing
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:42.000]  down a hard left hellhole this is the last chance for britain to avoid a constitutional
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:49.160]  crisis this is sovereignty on the chopping block this is democracy hanging by a thread
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:16:02.800]  hear that that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked

[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.480]  viewers the best iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:21.600]  based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:26.600]  us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:31.000]  and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.200]  that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:41.040]  but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:47.080]  three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it supercharges it and makes
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:53.040]  it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it

[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:35.880]  alex jones so the caravan that two weeks ago tore down and smashed rubed mexican border
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:40.560]  defenses running over their military and riot police injuring many of them some of them
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:47.760]  with firearms and mall of cocktail firebombs has made it in the last 48 hours the first
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:54.240]  vanguard bust in would have taken over 100 days for them to get there at 10 miles a day
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:59.880]  but they were bust in lavishly by unicef and by u.s. a.i.d. the state department funding
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:05.440]  george soros that's public and now they're beginning to mash and promising and taunting
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:09.640]  military the last two days we played the video yesterday saying in spanish we're going to
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:16.320]  run over you we are coming you will not stop us we are here and so the first end of the
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:22.640]  tentacle the first tip of the spear has now hit and we have two of our reporters that
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:28.720]  are on the scene live reports coming up at info wars dot com and news wars dot com we're
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:32.320]  gonna be asking locals what they think of what's going on we're gonna be going and talking
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:37.960]  to some of the invaders about who's funding them and what's going on and we're also gonna
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:42.680]  be again showing that imaginary caravan that does not exist there's footage from two days
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:48.160]  ago does not exist and of course on the news people are actually climbing over being allowed
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:52.640]  to climb over the military's not engaging them yet because you can't do that well that's
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:22:00.320]  kkk behavior according to camilla harris the democrat from california a member of congress
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.480]  is a parallel between ice and the kkk even though ice is about half hispanic even though
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:09.200]  latin america's collapsed even though all the countries around venezuela put up fences
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:15.240]  because it's collapsed into a total hellhole but don't worry they have a digital mark of
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:20.520]  the beast that's coming in this week have the article here next segment don't know no
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:27.360]  there's a nice corridor set up by the un into our country with the democrats waiting with
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:33.320]  open arms in california covered in human feces and needles and out of control crime and ash
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:39.120]  raining down out of the sky and all the corruption why she says it's the kkk if we have a border
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:46.320]  mexico has a border with us and checks people there's a border with central america with
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:52.720]  guatemala and honduras and beliefs but see we can't because camilla harris has brown
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:23:00.400]  skin so she's a god so she can engage in racial baiting and try to demonize america's existence
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.360]  and the american flag and all the rest of the democrats hate so here she is are you aware
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:14.400]  of the perception of many about how the the power and the discretion at ices being used
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:20.840]  to enforce the laws and do you see any parallels i do not see any parallels between i'm talking
[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:25.680]  about perception officers and agents i'm talking about perception i do not see a parallel between
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.960]  what is constitutionally mandated as an as it relates to enforcing the law are you aware
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:34.080]  that there's a perception i see no are you aware that there's a perception ice in the
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.360]  same category as the kkk is that where you're asking me i know i'm very specific about what
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:46.720]  i'm asking are you aware of a perception that the way that the discretion i see i'm not
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:51.920]  finished i see none i'm not finished i'm not finished are you aware that there's a perception
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:24:00.640]  that that ice is administering its power in a way that is causing fear and intimidation
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:08.000]  um um particularly among immigrants and and specifically among immigrants coming from
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:14.080]  mexico and central america are you aware of that perception i do not see a parallel between
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:18.880]  the power and the authority that ice has to do its job and the agents and officers who
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:23.840]  do it professionally and excellently with lots of compassion sir how can you be the head
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:29.480]  of an agency and be unaware of how your agency is perceived by certain communities there
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:34.000]  is a lot of perceptions in the media and in the public that are incorrect about the agents
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.560]  but the perception exists would you agree whether or not it's correct and wouldn't you agree
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:45.480]  then that if that perception exists there might need to be some work done to correct
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:50.880]  the perception we're going to back that up and play it again in a moment the computer
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:55.240]  jumped ahead like 10 seconds she says the perception that your kkk and then he responds
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:03.320]  to it that that part some reason wasn't there um this is a race baiting kkk member this is
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:08.600]  a racist hispanic woman who has a chip on her shoulder against america and white people
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:14.280]  and she's there saying that people trying to get into the country to have anchor babies
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:21.080]  and get everything free are so scared of the kkk that they're fighting to get into it and
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:25.360]  they get there and half the agents on average are hispanic and literally treat them like
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:30.040]  royalty and then if a person shows up with a bunch of unidentified kids they take the
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.400]  kids away from them till they find out who they are and this same woman claims they're
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:39.920]  brutalizing kids and and and is compared it to the nazis this is a monster race baiting
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:52.840]  pig that's what she is and this is how these people operate the full quotes are online
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:58.880]  so let's go ahead and play it from the beginning so you can have it here in context um i think
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.760]  you would agree as a member of law enforcement that law enforcement um generally speaking
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:09.480]  and certainly would be the case um with ice officers and agents that um a great deal of
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:15.480]  your power um is discretionary you have limited resources and you make decisions about what
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:19.840]  you're going to do um but you exercise a great deal of discretion in terms of how you're
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:25.080]  going to use the limited resources and how are you going to prioritize them and then
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:31.760]  understanding that i think you would also agree that one's perspective and their bias
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:37.840]  if they have bias will influence their exercise of discretion in terms of the power they have
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:42.160]  and how it will be used and implemented so i want to return to the question that senator
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.800]  peters asked you about the statement you made describing the democratic party as liberal
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:54.560]  cratic or neoclanist which was this um i think the assumption there was that you were comparing
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:27:04.480]  it to the kukuk's clan kukuk's clan um the kkk so you said in response to his question
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:11.000]  you're sorry because the words caused offense so would you not be sorry if no one was offended
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.280]  by your words no it was wrong to do uh why was it wrong because those are offensive words
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:23.600]  why are they offensive because they have history in this country and and i honestly did not
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:28.240]  mean it that way but please talk about that pause you here's a woman in the party that
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:34.880]  founded the kkk there's a total race-baiting party of crime and blue city sludge and needles
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:40.240]  and feces and and and child trafficking and and radical islam supporting and just all
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:45.600]  the filth that comes out of these people and christians and conservatives and abolitionists
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:52.120]  end all this crap and fight a war for it these people flip around turn the minority population
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:57.240]  that they're able to into a bunch of race-baiting scum and the deputy head of ice points out
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:02.040]  the democrats are a neoclan party they are they're a race-based party and then now he's
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:07.240]  having to apologize to her and just continues on let's let's keep going that would then
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:13.480]  make those words wrong well the the clan was uh what we would call today a domestic terrorist
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:19.640]  group why why would we call them domestic terrorist because they're race-based scum like you
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:24.600]  tried to use fear and force to change political environment like anti-spotland democrats motivation
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:30.600]  for the use of fear and force based on race and ethnicity right are you aware of the perception
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:39.800]  of many about how the the power and the discretion at ice is being used to enforce the laws
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:46.040]  and do you see any parallels i do not see any parallels between i'm talking about officers
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:50.120]  and agents how there she goes doing the parallel with that flipping it around that that we're not
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:55.720]  the kkk here at the democratic party race-based system no no no it's you and you can't have a

[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:29.400]  all right
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:37.800]  next segment i'm a little bit behind i'm going to get into an incredible window
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:44.760]  into the world of total big tech surveillance and what they can do
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:52.440]  once the internet id is in place chicago has already done it venezuelas doing it
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:34:02.120]  it blue cities are all going to do it amusement tax forced on playstation gamers in chicago
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:08.760]  i'm not kidding we're gonna be getting to that coming up and it ties into roiders
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:15.000]  venezuela is releasing an id card that can track and punish citizens it's the world social scorb
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:22.440]  get ready for it it's going to be nightmarish but people won't stand up with themselves
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:27.960]  and so it's going to get bad especially because lawmakers on average are like 75 years old
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:32.680]  and don't know how to find their ass with both hands and i'm not saying it's 75 years old
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:37.800]  they're all a bunch of arrogant lawyers that care more about playing golf and having people
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:43.560]  pull their chairs out for them they don't know what's going on the chai comms big tech are running
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:51.800]  circles around them it's sick so we just played a bunch of camilla harris the democrat kook the
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:59.480]  racist the race baiter the kkk lover she's in the kkk party draws parallels between ice and the kkk
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:05.400]  now let's talk turkey
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:12.840]  you've got 800 million people in latin america and the populations have to double the next 20 years
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:24.280]  to 1.6 billion that 1.8 billion muslims they're set to double by 2030 in the next 12 years or 11
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:33.240]  years time's flying and these are mono cultures in the middle east mono cultures in north africa
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:38.920]  mono cultures in islamic countries in asia because they don't live in peace with you if you're not a
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:45.800]  muslim in fact if you're not the right type of muslim you date but the left oh zuckerbrudd's
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:52.440]  considering banning trump off facebook because he banned people from six nations that don't have real
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:36:01.560]  passports so the great crime is stopping the un these big corporations that have already diluted
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:06.680]  the third world from stopping the political groups they organize and then have come to your
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:14.040]  border to get all the free goods and bankrupt your welfare society there is hope though because in
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:23.880]  germany and in sweden and in italy the socialist in many cases have been joining the right wingers
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:32.840]  are going yeah we don't want our pension funds totally bankrupted and so we better stop but
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:38.360]  see the globalists are now banning the socialist off facebook and twitter and youtube because
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:44.760]  they're not little socialist globalists but china is now moving into venezuela to control the
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:52.360]  invasion of central and north america and to put in a national id control grid and google is actually
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:59.720]  helping the venezuelan dictatorship suppress their population we're going to cover all that
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:06.440]  in the next segment but let's get to this because there's not just saying the caravan invasions
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:10.680]  don't exist or the un's not involved or soros isn't involved when it's all public
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:15.080]  knowledge that's going on and soros is separately in bloomberg and the wall street journal and the
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:20.360]  new york times and reuters bragging that he's funding the migrant caravans through money he
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:27.240]  gets from taxpayers via the state department and the un to love a pr piece in the same new york times
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:31.000]  about how great it is that they're funding the migrants and then another piece saying it doesn't
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.560]  exist you're like well does it make sense no they're training you to accept lies
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:43.880]  and then you have an article national guard soldier arrested charged with smuggling mexican
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:48.280]  nationals into the u.s a migration related news coverage continues to center around
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:53.880]  u.s troops deployed at the u.s border anticipation of migrant caravans along a way to arrival one
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:57.800]  service member has reportedly gone against the security grain and smuggled mexican migrants
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:04.120]  into the u.s oh he's gone against the security grain says the army time to the security grain
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:09.400]  he's violated his orders he's violated his oath he's violated federal law with human smuggling
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:13.560]  and ate in the bed of the smuggler groups that brought him up here but that's just going against
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:18.760]  the grain kind of like the un says nambla want to date your five-year-old daughter's going against
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:29.000]  the grain california national guardsman pfc edward jair acosta avalab was arrested november
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.200]  10th with his car was stopped in san diego california about two miles north of the u.s
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:41.000]  mexico border u.s.a reported but this is all just now happening esti coming out a few days later
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:46.440]  or four days later here it is more caravan migrants arrive in teowanna race for a long stay
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:53.240]  they find one kid zoom in on them and that brings me next to the propaganda they called it hundreds
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:59.560]  smash over the mexican border two and a half weeks ago it was tens of thousands now dozens from
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:05.160]  caravan line up at border seek asylum new york times local news says it's 2000 according to
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:12.600]  board patrol see dozens means 2000 hundreds means 50 000 get to learn how the math works
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:17.560]  learn how the double speak works it's a formula of deception now here's another example of deception
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:27.000]  it's everywhere this is out of uh five news online kfsp spring dale man arrested after

[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:09.240]  he's an illegal alien he's been deported before but you've got to dig deep to even learn that
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:16.600]  that's really the headline here msm nationwide covers and just says a spring dale man it's like
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:22.920]  when muslims rape little girls or kill them it's always german men ten german men kidnapped a

[01:44:53.880 --> 01:45:01.560]  digestive pack today the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:07.160]  environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:12.920]  it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:19.000]  iodide in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.400]  pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:29.720]  discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:34.680]  due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:39.960]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:46.760]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:52.680]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:46:00.040]  it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4's life dot com please whatever you do realize
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:04.680]  that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship and you saw 18 twitter accounts they say
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:08.600]  affiliated with info wars yes some of them were like little side accounts they know we had like
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:13.800]  info were stored that just showed our products but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment

[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:28.040]  brick but the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:34.840]  in the future i want to be troublesome and pesky i want to keep going i want to make them do the

[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:45.160]  prayed for that and i've been told that's going to happen but you've got a back ish and i promise

[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:59.800]  total commitment
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:03.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:15.000]  so
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:38.200]  so crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.200]  so
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  Now if you're a radio listener, you can't see this incredible footage, but it's up on inforwars.com
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  But let's just say that this illegal alien does not have the highest IQ.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  How do you pronounce his last name? I don't have the highest IQ either.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  29 year old Lewis Cabos Cenobio, so this is this idiot 29 year old Lewis Cabos Cenobio is an illegal alien here.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  He's in Arkansas and the police try to pull him over so he just gets out of the car and starts trying to kill the police
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  and then tries to come around into the police car to kill the cop. Really smart if you're wanting to get the death penalty.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  For no reason. All he would have gotten was maybe deported. Most of police departments, nothing because the judges are globalist and leftist in Sanctuary City and say let him go.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  But instead he tries to kill this cop, races on down the road, other police see him and he stops and tries to kill them.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  Now normally when illegal aliens kill people in blue cities they are actually let off.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  Every few days I see were hit and run, stabbing, shooting, shooting a young woman in the back in San Francisco.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  They let him go, no charges. They said in fact there's talk of suits against the state and against the feds for even supporting it.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  That's right, she shot a woman in the back, she's white, kill her ass and that was a white jury.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  That's white prosecutors because there's nothing like a virtue signal saying you want to take a gun and shoot a woman in the back as long as they're white.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  As long as it's in San Francisco, the city of piles of human feces, it's a good thing.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  Because this is the cult, you cannot say any illegal aliens bad unless they're white.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  They had that Germany legal alien running around, burning everything down in Colorado for a couple of years.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  There's a lot of crazy people fleeing their countries that get here illegally and then they have no identity they can do pretty much anything they want.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  Remember the railway killer that they confirmed he killed 20 plus people, mainly Hispanics, he was Hispanic.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  He just rode around trains murdering people and no one could ever catch him because he didn't have any identity.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  But then everybody else has got to be surveilled 24 hours by the system or we're terrorists.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  So dash cam video shows moment illegal immigrant, illegal alien suspect opens fire on Arkansas police officer and then gets chased down the road and shoots it more police vehicles until he gets shot twice.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  And now he's out of any type of condition and is at the jail.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  And I'm sure the left will be saying, release him immediately.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  The articles on infowars.com, watch illegal alien charged with attempted murder after firing at the police.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  Let me tell you, he didn't just shoot at him.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  He was coming up to the vehicle.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  He wasn't risking his life to like fight ISIS that has sex slaves or al-Qaeda or something.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  He wasn't risking his life to fight another military.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  He was going out of his way because the cops dare pull him over to try to kill a cop on dash cam.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  This guy is a real rocket scientist.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  He's risking his life for no reason to try to kill a cop because he hates America and police so much.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  That's the mindset to him.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  This is evil.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  This is bad.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  You've got to, you've seen the different confessions.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  Can we pull the guy up that Trump ran ads of that got banned?
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  Illegal alien deported repeatedly.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  Do you have anything to say if he killed this cop and cold blood and shot him in the back?
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  No, I'm just sad I didn't kill more because there's a certain percentage of people in Latin America who've ruined those countries who were into the cult of death and murdering people indiscriminately.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  And illegal aliens on average commit twice as much crime as any other group.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  Does that mean all the quote immigrants are bad people?
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  No, but statistically there are a lot of criminals coming in and that's what Trump said.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  And they mainly feed on their own communities.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  But we're told that mattered.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  Were we able to find that piece?
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  I forgot the name of the banned video.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  This is the banned ad just a few weeks ago in the whole election.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  That's got the guy saying he's, you know, he's just too bad he didn't kill more cops.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  It's incredible.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  But that's the mindset here.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  What I do want to get to since I mentioned San Francisco is this piece I mentioned a few days ago, but I didn't get to.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  Because NBC actually did a good job telling the truth about the disgusting crime-ridden situation in San Francisco Bay Area and wire blue city such hell pits.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  So we're going to play that report and then we did find the other piece.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  But here is this extremely powerful NBC report.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  NBC very investigation reveals a dangerous concoction of drug needles, garbage, and even feces lining the streets of downtown.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  Investigative reporter Begat Shaban explains why parts of the city are now being compared to some of the worst slums, not just in the country, but in the world.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  Terry and Jess, parts of the city aren't just disgusting.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  These diseased streets can be dangerous.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  Millions of your tax dollars are spent cleaning them.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  So why does one of the richest cities in the world have neighborhoods that resemble some of the poorest?
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  Tonight, we investigate.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  You like taking walks?
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  Anayla Reed is pretty observant for a three-year-old.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  This looks like a microphone.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  That's what it is.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  She's anxious, which might be why she had no problem telling us her thoughts on San Francisco.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  You know, come on poop in there.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  Can you see poop sometimes?
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  Yeah, when garbage.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  How does that make you feel?
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  That makes me angry.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  It makes you angry?
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  Yeah.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  Anayla and her fellow preschoolers have to regularly dodge some of the worst of what San Francisco has to offer.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  The day we met Anayla, she and her class walked right by newly a dozen drug needles.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  That's the kids singing, by the way.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  You got to start paying attention to the ground, okay?
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  Kim Davenport is Anayla's mom and often walks her to school.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  It's not safe.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  It's not healthy.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  Feces on the ground, needles.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  You actually have to pull her out of the way to keep them separate.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  Yes, of course.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  I just have to do that this morning.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  So how dirty is the city?
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  I hit the streets with my producer to find out.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  Together, we surveyed 153 blocks of downtown San Francisco.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  We spent three days walking up and down every street, inspecting more than 20 miles of the city.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  We found trash on every block, 303 piles of feces, and 100 needles.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  If you do get stuck with these, uh, disposed needles, you can get HIV, hepatitis C, hepatitis B.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  Dr. Lee Riley is an infectious disease expert at UC Berkeley.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  The fecal matter could possibly get into air, and if you happen to inhale that, you can also go into your intestine.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  Which can be deadly, especially for children.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  Dr. Riley has researched some of the dirtiest slums in the world,
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  but believes contamination levels in parts of San Francisco may now be even worse.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  Much higher than what we see in places like Brazil, or Kenya, or India.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  The neighborhoods we surveyed include the notorious tenderloin,
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  but also popular tourist spots like Union Square and major hotels.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  The area also includes City Hall, schools, playgrounds, and a police station.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  We took hundreds of photos and videos.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  Alright, that's enough for four more minutes. The full video is on infowars.com.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  But you have to understand, Democrats ship the drugs in. Democrats ship the human trafficking in.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  Democrats manage it.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  But you think this army, PFC, that got caught bringing illegal aliens in yesterday?
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  You think this is the only person doing this? It's big business.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  Because once they get here, they get the free welfare, the free housing,
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  the babies are had for free, they're made citizens.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  And then the Democrats and the local mafia, they go get them a job,
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  and they take most of their welfare money.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  And then if they get uppity, then there's a call made to ICE from the sanctuary city,
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  and they say that you've done something illegal, and then ICE is allowed to come in.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  So they bring in these people as their slaves, it's on record, that's how this works.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  And that's why it's getting worse.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  And they vote the way they want, they politically do what they're told, but that's the beginning.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  This is a permanent underclass.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  You bring them in, you got your yogurt factory, you control them, you shake them down,
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  you got your factory, whatever. That's how slavery works.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  These are sweatshops being set up in America with slaves.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  Then you sell them heroin, they rob everybody for the money, and you get it.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  That's the Democrat Plantation.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  This is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  So I want you to experience SuperMailVitality before it's too late.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  Unleash the SuperMail in you.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:59:06.000]  You need to support independent media that's under attack. We're under attack by these globalists as you know. Your support's been amazing. We make it easy to support us because we have great products. And we're announcing a mega blowout sale at InfowarsStore.com to fund us into the new year so we have a budget to continue on in the face of their attacks.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  SuperMail and Super Female Vitality is incredibly high quality, cold pressed herbs known for strength, stamina, libido energy. It's amazing. It is a whopping 57% off.

[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:57.000]  And we're continuing free shipping store wide on Alexa Pure Breeze, water filters and on all the other books and videos and material at the InfowarsStore.
[01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:17.000]  But bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  They are voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  We came, we saw, we died. With her, you'll end up in world war three. I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEF CON 2. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions. Of course not, because she's...
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  Really loud noise.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  Alright, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties. We'll try to get Leigh Ann back on in a few minutes.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  By the way, I was told Hillary Clinton specifically complained about that video we put out about a week before the election.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  It got 20 million views or so on different platforms. She particularly did not like that little campaign ad.
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  She said she wanted to go to war with Russia and all the rest of it. Many analysts said it was a much better chance we'd end up having a war if she was in office.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  And that's what they want to solve it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  Now, we have a guest joining us who's in the U.K. an expert on Brexit.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  And their fight is our fight here.
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  The unelected globalism that they're under is the same globalist we're under.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  And so any setback they have in Brazil or they have in the continent of Europe or they have in the U.K. or they have in Asia or Africa is a setback for them here as well.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  So it is a global fight. We're involved in a global fight that we are engaged in.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  We're going to be looking at all that coming up at the bottom of the hour on this live Friday edition.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  But I want to get into the casino gulag system and what the whole digital system is going to be like when we come back from break, an amusement tax forced on PlayStation gamers right here in America.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  So we're going to be breaking all that down on the other side of this break and looking at what the Panopticonic censorship and control is going to be like as a society in a civilization with the whole global social credit score that is galloping forward at light speed.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  We're also going to look at Yonker speaking of the EU at the bottom of the hour or videos up on news wars dot com info wars dot com appears incapable of dressing himself.
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  Wait till you see this and some of his other annex because as bad as stuff is you look at who's controlling everything they're not invincible.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  He's wearing black shoe and brown shoe and has to be told by them as he's so incredibly drunk.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  We've got some of these other videos but he's the unelected head of the EU.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  And you know there's the EU working with Africa to open the borders up at this migration meeting so he can bring in more to our world populations.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  He can use as a political weapon by 90% of the illegal aliens they bring in and legalize you put on welfare.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:46.000]  And five years after or not off of it they want permanent class they control it's a very simple equation also coming up.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  Some Christians say at least I'll be able to go to my church no now the courts are going to make you have atheist preachers I'm not kidding.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:02.000]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our official oil formula or just want an alternative in four words life has the formula for you.
[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  Ultimate krill oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA and omega-3 is found in our high quality ultra pure krill oil concentrate.
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as athazanthin and omega-3s ultimate krill oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:29.000]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways including supporting heart health, joint health and cognitive health,
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.000]  aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function and more.
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified high quality krill oil concentrate.
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:59.000]  Paired with our ultimate fish oil or you separately it's time to see what krill oil can do for you with ultimate krill oil now available at infowarstore.com.
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  I know what they find, it's in their mind, it's what they want to see.
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:34.000]  Baby from the rain, here comes the night and here I stay, waiting for dark day.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us here in our number three on this worldwide transmission. I am your host Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:07:00.000]  I want to go into the netherworld of the digital cashless society and all the unprecedented abuses and control and social engineering that are going to come with it in the architects of this system's own admissions.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:07.000]  So that's coming up in just a few minutes. First off I didn't plug last hour, I get so busy so focus on the news.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:20.000]  We are listed supported and we finance with high quality supplements, with t-shirts, with books, with films, with amazing water filtration systems, with amazing air filtration systems, with everything.
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:33.000]  And we go out and find whatever the very best is whether it's supplements or water filtration or air filtration and we become dealers in it and we become the biggest sellers of it by selling it at the lowest price.
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:38.000]  So we make a big announcement, everyone should do their Christmas shopping now.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:59.000]  For a particular item that's at infowarsstore.com, Alexa Pure Pro. Alexa Pure Pro is the top of the line stainless steel gravity fed water filtration system that cuts out all the garbage, hundreds of chemicals, but lets the good minerals and things go through.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:05.000]  Reverse osmosis long term is very very bad because it cuts everything out. This leaves the good minerals in.
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:19.000]  It's the system I've chosen for my family. I bought it for a gift from many people. There are a lot of companies and units out there that in the past were pretty good companies, but over time they lower quality.
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:29.000]  Alexa Pure has never done that. So any water filtration systems you see at infowarsstore.com are the highest rated and I've personally used them and we've gotten great customer reviews for years.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  And Pro Pure is excellent as well. You know, each systems apples and oranges the other, but and it's available at infowarsstore.com.
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:46.000]  But Alexa Pure Pro is their big nice top of the line stainless steel model. All their models are great.
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:09:01.000]  But this particular deal is a way one time thing. I've been selling high quality water filtration for 20 plus years and it's an absolute must to have.
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  But this system is already the best out there. They have competitors that are similar to this that are 350 bucks. Normally at 240 it's a great deal.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  Okay. But when we discount it's usually 199 for the big one.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  The owner of the company ordered thousands and thousands, a couple thousand extra than they project those something at the end of the year.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  They don't want to have to pay the state franchise taxes or the state income taxes, depending on what state you're in.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  Texas is called a franchise tax. Any inventory we have, same thing. There's a percentage we got to pay on it.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  That's why you hear car dealers say end of the year must go. That is the best deals of the year. You can probably get three, four, five thousand dollars on the vehicle.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  You couldn't have gotten that year and they've got to pay inventory on it. And then at first for a few months, there's not a lot of cars, the dealership, because the new ones are coming in.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  It's the same thing. This is top of the line, super high quality, water filtration system, the best they've got, the biggest they've got, stainless steel, super high quality with the filters for 127.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  127. And I can tell you we're getting at their cost, 90 something dollars. So it helps from the Info War. You get the best deal ever on a filter.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  200 bucks is a steal. That's normally our discount when we're discounting it. This is 127.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  A Lexapure Pro. And maybe you already have a system. Give it as a gift. Explain to them what's going on in the water.
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  It is a total 360 wind. Fund the Info War. Get the Lexapure Breeze and take care of yourself and your children because the stuff that's in the water is just unspeakable, especially in big cities.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  But also in rural areas, if you're getting most, most well water, unless it's out of an aquifer, is seriously contaminated.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  That's all over the news now, like Life of State and the other chemicals in France. Large percentages of the kids in some rural areas, 10% of the kids don't have arms and legs from one pesticide runoff that they banned a few years ago.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  They call it a mystery, but you read deeper. They know it's a pesticide runoff. The biggest thing you can do for your family is purify your water.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  It's the number one thing to remove so much of the garbage that's out there. Lexapure Pro Water Filtration 127 at infowarstore.com or by calling toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  And then separately, please don't forget, we only have until Sunday with a 67% off on the colloidal silver, 50% off on brain force, 57% off on supermail vitality, and a bunch of other our best selling items.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  We had to end that big store while it sells. A lot of stuff is about to sell out. These are best sellers that are not close to selling out for a while, so we're still able to offer this to you at infowarstore.com.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  Okay, let's start getting into this right now.
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  When we talk about taxation, when we talk about regulation, it's important to remember what George Washington said, the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  And if you look at the models in the last 20 years that the globalist futurist were putting out, they said, look, we're going to make humanity in jobs from farming to industrial work to load steel labor obsolete.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  So we've got a ballooning population. We're also going to then build a world where humans are obsolete, but there's nobody at the checkout counter and there's nobody at the restaurant and robots cook your food and a robot waitress comes over or you program it into the control panel.
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  It's all there. And it's being done to make humans obsolete. So then the big industrialized system run by the technocrats can dictate to you what type of job you get, what type of food you get when you get to vacation, because you've been made obsolete.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  And now these big mega cores and these big corporate systems, they have a planned economy. And so you now socially have to behave the way they want or you don't get a job, you don't get your ration credits, because again, you've been put in an artificial construct where humans no longer have any value.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  You've let them put you into an artificial biosphere where you are nothing but a complete negative and truly are a parasite, not contributing. And a microcosm is 40 years ago they came out with the Texas Instruments calculator.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  They come out with a calculator. Sounds great. Sounds like it's a lot of fun. Makes it easy. People go from knowing how to do arithmetic in their minds and on paper to almost no one knowing how to do basic math now.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  You start making the rifles where they're automated and computerized, where snipers can shoot people at a half mile away better than the best sniper could before. It puts in Coriolis, it puts in Windage, it puts it all in. But soon no one knows how to actually shoot a rifle and people being good riflemen are gone.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  Same thing is they're having more and more crash landings, more and more problems, because pilots really don't know how to fly planes anymore, the younger ones, because everything is really already automated in large aircraft.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  Then they make you go to automation in cars. Then they make you go to automation in trucks in the name of safety.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  The self-driving cars are already here. The new Audi's are coming out, new Mercedes this year, that already control how you drive. If you get out of the confines it believes you should be driving via its GPS and computerized systems, it simply takes control.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  And so we're being inducted into a machine interface takeover that in every case and in every study and every program makes us physically weaker, makes us mentally weaker. They're getting rid of knowing how to write with a pencil or a pen.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  They're getting rid of cursive. They're getting rid of regular language. The language is shrinking. The IQ is dropping. The sperm count is plunging. We are dying.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  It's not the technology makes us weak. The technology's been designed from the beginning to take us over, almost as if it's been done before, almost as if we're just another experiment.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  You understand? When we come back we're going to look into this nightmare world and where it's going to take us. Stay with us.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[02:18:54.000 --> 02:19:04.000]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air. Obviously, water filtration is a great thing. It's a good thing.
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air. And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration. I learned what the best was.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest, stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour. It's amazing.
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:26.000]  It cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in the good minerals. Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my Patreon supply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  He has a glut of them. He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249. When it's discounted, it's $200. It's $127. He's selling them to us at cost.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  And we're making $27 bucks on them. So they're going to sell out very, very quickly. This is the gift of life, the gift of health. It's amazing. Alexa Pure Pro at infowarstore.com or call AAA-253-3139.
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:24.000]  I've got a good woman at home who thinks I do no wrong.
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:41.000]  You know, sometimes. So it's all admitted. Nation states can't exist. Families can't exist. They want you as weak and dumb as you can.
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:54.000]  Colleges all over Europe, all over the U.S. If people are upset about anything, they're taught to flop around like two-year-olds. They play with Play-Doh and construction paper, but they can't have scissors. This is 20-year-old people.
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:11.000]  Meanwhile, young children are being taught that whites are inherently evil. They showed that video from a public YouTube series where they're taught communism and the hatred of America and the hatred of men, white men specifically.
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:31.000]  Now, let's get into where this is going because this is the corpus. Remember Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, you can pull it up, would not allow their sons, their daughters access to any digital phones, any computers, any iPads, nothing.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:44.000]  They were allowed to technically, with textbooks, learn how they work and learn with limited programs how the guts worked, but not the propaganda they were putting out.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:55.000]  Because Zuckerberg and others, they're the ruling class. Zuckerberg's employees are ordered to put on VR goggles and hunch over, but he walks bipedally above them.
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:05.000]  Maybe we can pull that up, the shot that tells it all. So, where is it going? Where is it going here?
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:14.000]  Again, if you're a radio listener, remember, my crew is so good, everything I say they put on screen within seconds, or I flip out, which is not good.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:21.000]  I tell you, Steve Jobs didn't let his kids have it. I tell you, Bill Gates didn't let his kids have it. I tell you, the stuff, it's true.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:34.000]  Now, TV viewers are like, yeah, we're watching. So, I was told this by Max Kaiser, and Max is a great guy, but you notice Max doesn't come on anymore, because Max got some trouble.
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:43.000]  Max is very good friends with George Soros' sons, and I'm going to leave it at that, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:50.000]  I'm going to stop. I'm about to start saying some things. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I said I wouldn't say it.
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  Anyway, so that's why he told us about this 10 years ago, the exact plan. But I'm not supposed to tell you the part about the Soros, so forget I said that, actually.
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:03.000]  See, I never break confidence that I'm about to do it. Oh my God.
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  See, if I ever do stuff like this, people will stop telling me things, but at a certain point, this is criminal, so I should tell you.
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:20.000]  I'm going to go crazy. I can't handle it anymore. Why do I have to put up with this? Why don't people say no to this crap?
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:28.000]  I'm not going to tell you what I was going to tell you. I'm going to stop right there. I'm not putting an act on here, guys. I'm actually going crazy right now.
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:33.000]  I mean, I went out to eat with my wife last night for her 40th birthday.
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:42.000]  And her birthday is not yesterday. I didn't dox my wife. It was a while back, but we haven't had time to go out until now.
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:55.000]  And I had multiple leftists come over and say things to me, which is fine, except they're so mentally ill and so stupid, they don't know that I'm their friend.
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:00.000]  Because you wanted to go to this trendy sushi place. It doesn't happen in most places, and it was good.
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:06.000]  And I'm in there and I'm like, most people like me, but I don't care that they hate me.
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  It's that they really think I'm the bad guy when all I'm trying to do is warn everybody and I've been proven consistently right about all this stuff over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:26.000]  And now it's passé what I cover because it's all the really bad stuff about to happen now and is happening.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  China is about four years ahead of us. The EU is about two years ahead of us. Venezuela is about a year ahead of us.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  And there's an exact plan. And I've got all the articles today admitting all of it.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  You think I get happy when everything we predict becomes exactly true?
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:47.000]  Anyways, Max Kaiser is a good guy. He knows the Soros and people.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  I think he said that on air a few times so I can say that on air.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000]  And they kind of told him what was coming in the future.
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:02.000]  You don't just think Max came up with the casino gulag all by himself.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  No, what's going to happen is no one's going to have any jobs. We're going to be forcefully displaced from them.
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  Men have been turned into jellyfish. Women will be on these power trippers that are just worshipping the state and think not having kids is cool.
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  And we're done. And then you will be paid. You will be paid if you win the video games.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000]  And that'll be your job that you play all day.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  But when you lose, you will have to pay money.
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  But just like Ready Player One that they push on you, that's actually the plan.
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  But Kaiser told you on the air here 15 years ago, not in Ready Player One.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:48.000]  So they're really building that. This isn't a game. This isn't funny.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  This is really happening. And Kaiser is just one of the sources.
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  Amusement tax. This is a Kit Daniels article. Everyone might want to read this on newswords.com and infowords.com.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  Newswords.com isn't as blacklisted and blocked, so it'll share better if you share it from newswords.com.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  And by the way, newswords is now a quarter of the size of infowords.
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  It's now a big old, big old, big old website.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  It got a big old diggling. Amusement tax forced on PlayStation gamers in Chicago.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  There's only one cesspit worse than San Francisco or L.A. and that's Chicago, the test bed.
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  Well, I guess New York's a close third.
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  Shitty owes 130 billion to public pensions according to reports.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  So now it's like drugs. The left always brings drugs in, then has people use it, then lets the criminals rob poor areas to pay the money back
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  to the government that brings the drugs in and the Democrat areas.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000]  Well, now this is their drug on dopamine.
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  And so when you want to sign up for PlayStation every year, and notice it's PlayStation and Microsoft working with the government
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  and other video game companies to totally control your life and tax everything you do.
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  So it's that seamless integration.
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  PlayStation gamers are now forced to pay an amusement tax in Chicago as city officials tax everything to cover underfunded public pensions.
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  But don't worry, let's bring in more illegal aliens to bankrupt things. That'll fix it, right?
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  Gamers were recently notified that they would have to pay a 9% levy every time they pay for PlayStation subscription services such as PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music.
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  The city's amusement tax, which used to apply mostly to concert and sporting event tickets, was extended to include streaming services.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000]  That means now your digital devices report the Chicago Tribune.
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  That includes charges paid for playing games according to Chicago Finance Department.
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  Spotify, Netflix, and Hulu were already collecting the tax on consumers.
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  Apple, on the other hand, took the city to court.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  Chicago, because they never pay any tax. They just run slave camps.
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  They're on the top of the pyramid, bitches, not the bottom.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  Chicago forced the tax on gamers over the city, fell 130 billion in pension debt.
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  Now, that's just an example.
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:09.000]  And that means total control, total surveillance.
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  Now, here's the big inch of lotter, as they say.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  Venezuela is releasing an ID card that can track and punish citizens.
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  And then they later admit, okay, it's really the global social score that tracks everything you do.
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  And China built it and it's coming to America.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  Coming to America, here's Reuters.
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000]  Right here, I just showed you Reuters.
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  Chinese telecom giant building Venezuela's social credit system.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  It's called, wait for it, the fatherland card.
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  We have the Chinese dictator with the dictator of Venezuela marching together in a military parade.
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  Oh yeah, baby. Oh, they got a plan for you.
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:10.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  I can help you too.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:16.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:30.000]  This is an emergency transmission from Deep in the Heart of Texas, the U.S. Resistance,
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:44.000]  against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949. The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure. The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:53.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities. This is all confirmed. This is not a drill. Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:34:06.000]  They've officially become state-run. Apple 100%. Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship. They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:15.000]  This is happening. This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:30.000]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks. This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed. We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:48.000]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:35:09.000]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score, complete command and control system. It is the virtual reality AI weapons system, now attacking the United States with traders inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai-coms-slash-big-tech-making-combine emergency situation.
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can. They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the strawman. I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars and so they make me a herder of children and then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction. I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm. I have given you the transmission. Now break free!
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:17.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:34.000]  Thomas Jefferson. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:46.000]  Alexander Nick Rossoff is our guest. He's been on before. He's all over BBC, RT, you name it. He's a former Kremlin and government advisor. Always becomes news when he comes on.
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  I've been able to talk to people over the Kremlin. He's a journalist and broadcaster and he's an expert. He's there in the UK on the Brexit.
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:37:08.000]  And wow, Teresa may not prove that she's a globalist. Three years after they voted to pull out of the elected EU, they brought a new system in. Paul Watson was at parliament. He's broken it down saying that it literally makes them a total vassal state of the EU.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  It's even worse than the EU. So, Alexander, thank you for joining us. You're the expert on this. We've seen a bunch of resignations. People stepping down. They're saying she may be removed at any time.
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:30.000]  I know you've got the latest breakdown what's happening and why folks are saying this is such a bad deal and is what I was just saying about this so-called Brexit deal accurate.
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  Alex, hi. Well, first of all, I need to tell you that there's a farce going on out here and all these resignations, all these statements, all these people beating their breasts and saying how passionate they are about leaving the European Union.
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  All of it is a game. What we actually have here is that the so-called deal that Teresa May has come up with means that Britain is not leaving the EU. It's actually going to stay in the EU, but with one major difference.
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  If before that it had a voice in the EU and could at least resist some of its pressure, now, according to the new deal, which I think is going to be approved, Britain will have no voice at all.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  It will continue to be under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. It will continue to be in the customs union. It will continue basically to be in the same position as it is now, but minus all of its voices taken out.
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  So what we have now is Britain is going to be turned into a vessel state. Now, what Teresa May is saying is that allegedly this situation will only last for a while while they are trying to negotiate proper terms.
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:21.000]  But this situation can last forever. Technically, it can go on and on and on and on and on. I am watching how the British media is covering this whole thing, and it reminds me of how your American media has been covering Trump.
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  You know, everybody talks in exactly the same language, uses exactly the same words, and yet nothing is being said that has anything to do with reality.
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  So it's very, very similar, and even the Russian angle is very similar. As we have in America, the media is saying that Trump won because Russia helped him to win, which is rubbish, of course. The same thing is here in Britain.
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  They are saying that Brexit has won because Russia helped it to win, which is amazing if you consider that the European Union probably spent millions and millions, probably tens and hundreds of millions to keep Britain in the EU, to basically try to resist the vote for Brexit,
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:29.000]  and then derail Brexit after the vote for Brexit won. And we are talking about here, about supposedly Russia having helped to win Brexit by supposedly funding it with 8 million pounds.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  Now they are investigating this funding, the National Criminal Agency is investigating this, and this is absurd. This is surreal.
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  Billions of pounds were spent trying to keep people in Brexit, but now to see these resignations, I've watched the parliament even admit that in every section may have lied, and it literally does what Hitler couldn't do to England and the UK,
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  literally has them sign everything over to them, and that's what globalists always do, you try to get out from under them, they just double down right now. How do you expect this to unfold?
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  Well, first of all, the most depressing and worrying thing about this whole idea, about this new deal, is that Britain is being dismantled, basically.
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  Now what we have here is that Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, will be basically part of the EU, separate from the rest of Britain. This is what nobody could have expected.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:50.000]  You know, they are dismantling, slowly, they are dismantling the United Kingdom. After that, I expect that Scotland will all start to put independence again.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  I mean, technically, we are looking at a scenario where the United Kingdom in a few years' time will be only England and Wales, hopefully, for them.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  And this is absolutely outrageous, and this plan is being sold as if it's a great idea that it has been negotiated after, you know, months and months of tough negotiations.
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  We're going to come back in more into this, and what you're saying is exactly what my sources of parliament are saying and what the document shows, and the EU was set up to be a super state to destroy nation states,
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  and now the UK tries to pull out, it gets spun by May into something that literally does what Hitler couldn't do.
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is unbelievable, but the good news is, despite the corporate press pushing, this is a great deal, people are fighting back.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  Our guest will break this down on the other side. He's on Twitter at Stirring Trouble, and I butcher his name, but it's Alexander Necrossov.
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  We'll be right back. I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com. Tomorrow's news today.
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:43:00.000]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:06.000]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing. It's a good thing. And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:10.000]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration. I learned what the best was.
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:16.000]  Now, the Alexa Pure pros their biggest, nicest, stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour. It's amazing.
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:25.000]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in the good minerals. Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my Patreon supply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  He has a glut of them. He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249. When it's discounted, usually $200. It's $127.
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:42.000]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making $27 bucks on them. So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health. It's amazing. Alexa Pure pro at infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com or call AAA 253-3139.
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:13.000]  It literally dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:19.000]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:25.000]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2. That's been incredible.
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:33.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it. It's an incredible discovery.
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  Organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals. You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  We have seen what they want to do. They called it UN Agenda 21. Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda. They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  They want people out of the suburbs. They want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  It's The David Knight Show.
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000]  You never missed your show, any day.
[02:45:48.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  At InfoWars.com, forward slash show.
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  The Globalist now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  I want to push all the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this. I will never falter. I will never waver at the spiritual level. I physically will.
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:47:14.000]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at InfoWars.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:23.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:34.000]  Alexander Dick Rostov is our guest. He's a former criminal and official. He's also a journalist, and more of a respect. He goes all over British, UK, and European news.
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  I'm just fascinated because they claim there's all this Russian collusion in the 2016 election, but Russia is a diverse country like the United States, or any big industrial and cultural and economic and technical power.
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  And most of the stuff there is like here, a bunch of leftist globalists running around foaming at the mouth. So they go, oh, look, there's bots influencing the election. Even the Wall Street Journal admitted 80% of the bots were bought by Democrats because you can get around campaign laws and go to Russia or England, like Cambridge and
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  Letica or Canada, and you go and you buy the PR from countries that offer it. You're not getting it from the country. You're getting it from the company. Michael Moore went to demonstrations organized by Russian bots by the Democrats because they could get around the laws going there.
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  It's just crazy. And I don't want to go down the Russia rabbit hole because no one I know buys it and they've now kind of moved on from it. But when Italy says we don't want to be under the unelected EU and be flooded by North Africans, they say, oh, Russia did it.
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:48.000]  Or Austria says we're pulling out of the UN treaty because they're flooding us with illegals. Oh, the Russians did it. You know, if somebody baked their child a cake, the Russians did it.
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  People say I don't have any success except for the Russians. It's really insulting to everybody out there. And it's pure bull. But our guest was not just saying this earlier. Even the Guardian says now Brexit really is threatening to tear the UK apart.
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:20.000]  Well, that's because that's what it does. So we're in this position right now. Then they say Britain's populist party has an M4s editor for a spokesman. Jewish leaders are worried. We have nothing to do with putting down anybody for their ethnicity or religion.
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  So this is the weaponization they've got trying to stop us supporting the UK and sovereignty existing. And so if Putin is involved in any conspiracy, it's this.
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  It's a public conspiracy of leadership. And, you know, I decided since I've been persecuted for supporting sovereign nations, especially sovereign nations that are promoting the family and Christianity, that I think Putin has done great things.
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  And I admire the fact that he has gotten the Russians to have children again. And he's protected the nation from radical Islam. And then he's proud of their sovereignty. That's what we need.
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:50:06.000]  And Trump's been doing that too. And they say that's dirty. No, the people that tell you you're dirty if you have a country and a culture, they are called the enemy trying to demoralize you to stand down so they can take over.
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:21.000]  And the unelected EU and their drunken Nazi air leader, Junker, is an abomination. The man is basically the king of Luxembourg because his grandfather, the most powerful Nazi after Hitler, literally took the country by force.
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:34.000]  These people are a joke. And now an unelected EU lets this drunk slap world leaders in the face piss on himself. He wears the wrong color shoes. That's the latest video and grabs women by the ass in public.
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:43.000]  I mean, we're ruled by this Botheria's in a brown and black shoe. Back it up. They come and they tell him that he's drunk. You back up before that. And he figures it out.
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:52.000]  Your lordship, he's German royalty. By the way, I'm part German. My daughter, my wife's almost like 75% German. I think it's German heritage.
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  But Junker is a monster, ladies and gentlemen. I have a guest and I'm ranting. I'll be with us a couple of segments for the next hour.
[02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:07.000]  And then our resident, Ruzifo, who's a great guy, will be coming in with all the news. He's been covering Joe Gilbert.
[02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:21.000]  But seriously, I mean, at this point here, I'm ranting, but to be called a Russian agent because I support sovereign nations existing is a load of crap by the very powers that are trying to get rid of our nations.
[02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:34.000]  I'm a trader because I want the US to be run by the US. I'm a trader because I want Russia to be run by Russians. I'm a trader because I want the UK to be run by people there. I'm a trader because I want EU states to be free. How is this?
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:38.000]  How is this? I know I'm ranting, Alexander.
[02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:52.000]  That's okay. It's okay. But Alex, I think at several important points we need to make about elections and how the leftists manipulate all sorts of things.
[02:51:52.000 --> 02:52:04.000]  Now, first of all, you know, they say the nation has become deeply divided. When Trump won the election, they said all the Americans are deeply divided because of Trump's win.
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:12.000]  When Brexit won in Britain, they said Britain is deeply divided because of Brexit. Well, let me tell you something, Alex.
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:25.000]  Every nation is divided by elections. You've got winners and you've got losers. Unfortunately, the losers, in this case, both with Trump and with Brexit, started to scream, we are divided.
[02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:35.000]  No, they are not divided. They have to accept that Trump has won the election and that Brexit won the referendum. But they are not accepting it.
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:44.000]  Then secondly, they say it's populism. It's populism. Trump is a populist. Putin is a populist. Brexit is populist.
[02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:50.000]  It's got nothing to do with populism. Populism is a left-wing method.
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:58.000]  I will remind everyone that populism initiated, originated during the French Revolution in the 18th century.
[02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:08.000]  Populism is when you offer things you can't deliver and you don't want to deliver and you don't intend to deliver.
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:20.000]  So the leftists have to stop calling right-wingers, conservatives populists. They are not. Populism has always been a left-wing phenomenon.
[02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:27.000]  Populism is when you promise something you don't want to deliver or you're not planning to deliver.
[02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:37.000]  So there's two important points that are always mixing. And when it comes to the Russian involvement, meddling and inverted commas,
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:47.000]  you see what they're doing is that when they don't get the result they want, like it happened in America with Trump, like it happened with Brexit,
[02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:55.000]  they say that Russia is involved. They have no proof of that. They show no proof at all.
[02:53:56.000 --> 02:54:01.000]  I want to talk about this, but what type of hairdryer or dust buster is that in the background?
[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:03.000]  Sorry?
[02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:07.000]  It may be a background noise. It sounds like a vacuum cleaner in the background.
[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:14.000]  We're having a little fun here, but let's get serious. There's different definitions. There's kind of globalist populism where they create a fake populism and promise things.
[02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  Then there's a nationalism, which some would call a populism, but all I'm saying is interchangeably there's people that are for a nation state
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:27.000]  and a social compact who believe in a culture and an ideal and have a shared background and destiny.
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  And the globalists are at war with that, and I'm simply saying Russia is the first country in the modern era of, I'd say, the last 25 years or so,
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  at least since the turn of the century, the 21st century, to say, no, we're not going to be run by foreign multinational powers that are looting us.
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  So the only real US Russia collusion I see is that Trump admired the fact that Putin could kick out foreign controllers and start to resort some prosperity to the country.
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:55:01.000]  And so I'm saying the only real collusion is there. And I think Putin's even said they did prefer Trump, but they never really explained why that is.
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:03.000]  Can you speak to that?
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:08.000]  Well, first of all, nobody actually knew that Trump would win.
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:12.000]  Now, I definitely can tell you that nobody in the Kremlin knew.
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  And if you remember the polls that were showing in America that Trump had a 7% chance and Hillary had 93% chance,
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:29.000]  how do you think in Russia they could have thought that Trump would win?
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:38.000]  It was a surprise. Now, the reason why Russians wanted Trump to win is because he said that America should be friendly with Russia.
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:40.000]  Now, what's wrong with that?
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:45.000]  And what's wrong with the Russian people saying, yeah, we'd like that guy.
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  We don't want Hillary who was making Russia into an enemy.
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  Now, the problem is this. The reason why Western governments are so aggressive against Russia is that Russia is technically the only conservative country left in Europe.
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:08.000]  Show me another one. Britain is run by liberals. They're all neoliberals. They're even not hiding this.
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:14.000]  They're openly saying we are social liberals. They're not conservatives.
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  So if you look at any country across Europe, you would see a part probably from Poland and Hungary.
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  All the other Western countries in Europe are run by liberals.
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:31.000]  And liberals hate Russia because Russia sticks to conservative values.
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  And that is why we have this new, very strange Cold War, which is more of an information war rather than a Cold War.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:56.000]  And that's why your title info wars is very, very important now because we have info wars going on now between the liberals in the West, Russia and the rest of the world.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:00.000]  Well, I want to ask you this when we come back. I want to ask you to do one more segment.
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:06.000]  And I was just joking around earlier. I think you have an internal fan or computer, but it's no big deal. You're joining us live from the UK.
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:12.000]  When we come back, I want to ask you gut level. Where do you see this going with the EU saying, OK, we'll give you Brexit.
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:18.000]  We'll just totally take control of your country. And they're forming an EU army to openly suppress states.
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  And Macron says we need a military to fight the U.S.
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:26.000]  And Trump made the point, but you know, it wasn't for the U.S. and Russia for that matter. You'd be speaking German.
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:36.000]  It's pretty amazing. And like you said, Hollywood hates Russia because Russia will not teach five year old boys how to, you know, give other men palatial.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  I mean, it really comes down to that and address like little girls.
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:44.000]  They want Putin to put Russian boys in dresses and teach them how to do that. We'll be right back.
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage. And that's why we need you to go to the site now. If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:14.000]  25, 50, 100, 250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  Hey, how would you like to take info wars with you wherever you go? Well, now you could do just that with the new official info wars. And here's the best part. It is absolutely free at the Apple store and Google Play.

[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:36.000]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the info wars.com articles to share the videos to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:57.000]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at info wars.com forward slash newsletter. We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:19.000]  Alexander McRoss off is our guest for five more minutes. I appreciate him.
[03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:35.000]  John is about a good discussion today. This is just horrifying that Theresa May tried to keep the text of this secret till the 11th hour and we get it and it just is such a flabbergasting power grab.
[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:45.000]  And then you look at Yonker of your radio listener. I showed the video wearing it on the podium, a brown shoe and a black shoe can hardly talk shots of him slapping men in the face grabbing women by the rear end stumbling around.
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  And the guy is just a super evil dude. And he just gets to do every it's like really the heir to the Nazis stumbling around.
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:06.000]  And he's unelected and he rules everything. And then he said when Trump got elected at Davos with the chai com leader, he goes, we will crush America in a statement.
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:16.000]  He said we will. I mean, it's like and then and then I'm the enemy and this is the good guy. I'm the trader because I don't want nuclear war with Russia. And if Russia was involved in our business like China, I'd be against Russia.
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:24.000]  It's just not going on. So Alexander finishing up here with other tidbits. Where do you see this whole Brexit going?
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  Well, Alex, the problem is, of course, that the EU is basically a sinking ship. Not much said about this, but the EU has a very, very.
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:58.000]  I would call it semi legal quantitative easing program when it pumps up to 80 billion, 80 billion a month of newly created electronic money into its markets to keep them afloat.
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:08.000]  If this program would have stopped this program is by the European Central Bank, but basically it's a German bank. Germany runs the European Central Bank.
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  Oh, and Germany came up with the EU plan under who's the guy's name, Adolf Hitler? Oh, sorry.
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:26.000]  Well, all sorts of mass dictators came up with the EU plan. Lenin, Vladimir Lenin wanted the United States of Europe. Napoleon wanted the same thing.
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  Hitler wanted the United States of Europe, sorry, the United Europe, Federal Europe.
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:48.000]  But the point is this, the European Union is a sinking ship. Britain does not benefit from being part of the European Union simply because Britain is damaged economically by the European Union.
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:03:02.000]  I can tell you that the negative trade deficit between Britain and Europe is 40 billion pounds each year. And you know what it means 40 billion pounds of a negative trade deficit.
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:10.000]  It means that millions of jobs are destroyed in Britain by the European Union. That's what it means.
[03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:18.000]  And yet people who want to stop Brexit or destroy Brexit are saying that they want to protect British jobs.
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:27.000]  They say that Brexit threatens British jobs. They say Brexit threatens workers' rights, which is rubbish.
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:40.000]  Britain is damaged by the European Union. And guess why people are now realizing slowly that Theresa May never wanted a proper Brexit?
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:47.000]  Because Theresa May has managed to spoil relations with the Trump administration, which is unique in itself.
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:57.000]  And she managed to spoil relations with Russia, which is a key partner of Britain if it really wanted to leave the EU.
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:08.000]  Russia would have provided a huge market for British goods. But Theresa May and her government, they created this semi-war with Russia.
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  They blame Russia for practically everything that's going wrong in Britain.
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  And here's the final point. Russia is not bringing in massive hordes of radical Islamists to replace the population.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:28.000]  The EU is. Russia is now allowing white South Africans and others to flee there. And this is not all race-based. It's religious-based too.
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  The left is using racial attacks. That's what's forcing more of the West to get into the ethno-state mindset because the left and the cultural Marxists have put us in that position.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:48.000]  Etch-stirring trouble on Twitter, Alexander Nekrosov has been our guest. Come back soon and we look forward to speaking to you. Thank you.
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:05:13.000]  We'll be right back with Joe Gilbert. I'll be speaking to him as well. Stay with us.
[03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  We'll be right back with Joe Gilbert.
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:06:08.000]  We are drugged out. We are following other people's opinions. We are controlled by the media. Today it all changes. This reality has been forced upon us.
[03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:16.000]  It is a choice. Just like what I said, slavery is a choice. Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:25.000]  So we keep on saying, I hate you. I hate you. Fuck you. Fuck you. How are we going to get a different result out of hate? Why don't we just try love? Why don't we just try love?
[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:35.000]  We have the resources for a peaceful world. You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something. Steve Jobs is crazy.
[03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:45.000]  Now we all know Steve Jobs phones. They say drugs crazy. They say I'm crazy. But I'm here to show love. It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[03:06:45.000 --> 03:07:07.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:17.000]  All right. Joe Gilbert is taking over here in just a few minutes. He's always got guests in a big show lined up for him when he hosts. On Fridays in the War Room comes up at 3 o'clock, though in Shroyer, Rogers, Chodon, others.
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:24.000]  But I want to, because I know Joe Gilbert looks into Russia and communism and the rest of it. I think China is the big threat.
[03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:39.000]  There was no real evidence of Russian meddling on behalf of Trump. There was evidence of going on for Hillary. She talked about it. But then I had people on, like Alexander Mikhrasov, who formerly worked for the Kremlin as a journalist.
[03:07:39.000 --> 03:08:00.000]  And I see the Russian becoming Christian. I see it standing up against radical Islam. I see Trump attracted to the idea of business with Russia. Russia controls so much of the land space and borders with other nations that the only alliance against the
[03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:10.000]  criminal EU and the Chai comms would be an alliance with Russia. But I know it's the traditional enemy. We've been taught to hate Russia. And that's because the globalists and others helped.
[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:17.000]  The proto-globalists and others left this world wide help prop up the Soviet Union. And I understand they still got their communists and all their issues over there.
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:29.000]  I just see Soros against Russia. Then I see Soros against America. I see some of the Rockefeller Foundation doing the same thing. And it really is. The Chinese, the Russians, the U.S. And you have the EU in the middle of it.
[03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  It's so incredibly authoritarian. And it just gives me a headache to think about the fact that the EU is the one opening up the borders to North Africa and all these Islamic areas and the Middle East.
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:51.000]  The Middle East and then passing laws. You can't criticize it. So I see that alliance of the socialists, the globalists, radical Islam. And I don't see Russia part of that alliance.
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:09:00.000]  But I know that Joel Gilbert, I mean, I was teasing earlier. I said, well, don't worry. We've got a former Kremlin guy on because we've got a Russaphobe coming up to balance it out.
[03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:15.000]  And I don't mean that as a mean thing. I mean that as a serious thing, because I'm definitely phobic authoritarianism. I see Google moving into the former headquarters in Eastern Germany and East Berlin of the Stasi, not just companies like Facebook.
[03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:32.000]  Hiring. That's hiring former high-level Stasi to oppress people. So who needs Russia when you've got the globalists in the EU and the Democratic Party? So what would you say the different power blocks are, Joel Gilbert, a filmmaker, a writer in your view?
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:52.000]  Look, I think that, first of all, Trump has to worry about this power block of the American left socialists that are going to be pushing their agenda and trying to manipulate his ability to make deals in the foreign arena.
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:10:03.000]  Trump only lost, you know, several seats of the Republicans, won several seats only by 1 percent, of course, and lost in Arizona by less than 1 percent.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  So he's got to worry about this literally internal force that's trying to undermine his presidency. These guys who are doing this used to like Russia a lot.
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:22.000]  Bernie Sanders used to honeymoon there. Russia was their friend, and they wanted an alliance with Russia when they were hardcore Marxist communists.
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:33.000]  Now that they've turned Christian and capitalist, they don't like them very much, and they're trying to malign them and put them in the same poor light as they are with Donald Trump.
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:42.000]  So I think things are going to have to shake out over the next couple of months. Let's see how this Brexit thing shakes out if they can get rid of Theresa May.
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:50.000]  And let's see what Trump is going to do now that he's got the midterms behind him. I think by January, February, a lot of these questions will be answered.
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:11:02.000]  Well, Joe, sure. I just thought it was interesting. I had one guest on from one angle. I'm going to get your angle on that. I understand that the big issue is the ongoing election theft by the Democrats was going on with the Deep State and Mueller.
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:15.000]  All that obviously is front and center. I agree with you. But ideologically, to me, I don't see when we have the EU and the Chai comms and others openly allied with the left, with Hollywood, openly meddling.
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:26.000]  We need to go on the offense. Trump is going to offense about that and say to Americans, do you understand you in funded caravans Chai comm funding of all this side with America idiots.
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  And I understand with the left, they say America was never great. They hate nationalism. They're making a dirty word. I guess just for me to wrap my mind around the fact that we aren't we aren't voting 90% for Republicans who are patriots.
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  When when when the other side is openly allergic to America, it just seems like a no brainer. And that just shows how far we've slid that we have the real realization, Joel, that most Democrats now really have drunk the Kool-Aid and really hate the country
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:04.000]  and really hate capitalism and really just don't know their ass from a home ground.
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  Yeah, they are. Look, with Obama, it was stealth socialism. He ran as a moderate. He said, I'm going to cut the deficit in half. I'll obey the Constitution.
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:22.000]  Marriage is between man and a woman and God. It was hidden. As soon as he took power, of course, he threw everyone under the bus and pursued this radical agenda.
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  Now the Democrats are openly selling an alternate reality. This is what socialism and communism is. This is what Nazism was, where Venezuela, where you say the government is going to take control of everything, your property, your businesses,
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:48.000]  and everything's going to work out great for you. Just give us the power. And this alternate reality always fails miserably, but people are buying into it just like they did with Obama.
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  They just clap and cheer even though they have no idea what he's talking about. Stacey Abrams, you know, Gilliam in Florida, open radicals lost by less than 1%.
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:04.000]  That's just one month of organizing and signing up people for registering illegally.
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:16.000]  Hey, Peter O'Rourke, excuse me, Beto O'Rourke, he only lost by like two points, obviously there was massive fraud, but folks, we can look at France and make fun of them or California and make fun of them, or New York or Chicago.
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:21.000]  Texas has almost brought in somebody that says he hates capitalism and he hates America.
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:36.000]  Well, I got coming on later on the show, I'm going to interview a gentleman wrote an article called, Is Trump the last Republican president? Because if they flip Florida and Texas, it's going to be very difficult for a Republican president to win.
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:47.000]  And we know that the Democrats, once they take power, will use the tools of state to keep power permanently. And we'll turn just like Canada, Sweden, France, Britain, Germany,
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:14:02.000]  Venezuela, permanent socialist state, where they break down nationalism for this globalist socialist agenda. And we lived it for eight years under Obama with a stagnant economy, food stamps, illegal, illegal activity by the government.
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:15.000]  He was trying to wreck it the whole time. But exactly, I just can't believe people aren't supporting Trump more. I believe the Republicans really won the midterms, but letting them censor and letting them election medal and letting them steal in many areas, that's why we lost.
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:24.000]  So we got to take the gloves off. Joel, you're coming back on the other side to take over the next 45 minutes. Please, listeners, please do not forget that without you supporting us, we're not here.
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:34.000]  And that means sharing the article, sharing the videos. That means telling friends and family about local radio stations, local TV stations. You are the way we're able to stand up.
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:38.000]  They don't want us on air during this attempt to globalist takeover. But look, nationals are getting elected everywhere.
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  We could turn this around very, very quickly, but it's critical. Involved words continue on. I know you know all about the globalist.
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:54.000]  Your neighbors, your friends, your family, your coworkers, your church members, I don't care if you're a non-radical Muslim that wants to live in America. Great. Tell your E-mom, whatever.
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:15:02.000]  The point is, get involved, spread the word. This is do or die. People can see how clear this is. And financially, we make it so easy to support us.
[03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  We've got huge sales going right now that are unprecedented. 67% off on high quality, little silver, the Alexa Pure Breeze Pro, their biggest unit.
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:20.000]  They've got to sell them all out by the end of the year. They don't want to pay taxes. They ordered too many. Leading competitors are 350 bucks. They're normally 240. They're the best system.
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:31.000]  127, that is like $30 above cost. You cannot beat that deal on the high quality Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system exclusively available at that price.
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  If you're a non-radical Muslim that wants to live in America, get involved.
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:16:01.000]  That's a free and non-underglobal control.

[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:25.000]  That's been incredible.
[03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:32.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:46.000]  But chemists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:19:19.000]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:25.000]  The owner of this beautiful tour at my page, he applied, that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:30.000]  He has a glut of them. He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:34.000]  When it's discounted, it's $200. It's $127.
[03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:39.000]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making $27 bucks on them.
[03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:42.000]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:45.000]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health. It's amazing.

[03:19:53.000 --> 03:20:16.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:26.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones and now your host, Joel Gilbert.
[03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:34.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm Joel Gilbert guest hosting this hour coming from the People's Republic of California.
[03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:41.000]  For what's left of it that hasn't burned down, thank you to all the people who contacted me on Twitter and by email.
[03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:46.000]  2 a.m. I'm here in Thousand Oaks, California. I get a text to evacuate.
[03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:53.000]  Go ahead and put up those couple of photos. You can see that was the view from my driveway.
[03:20:54.000 --> 03:20:57.000]  You can see what's coming over the mountains on fire. So that was a little bit intimidating.
[03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:07.000]  I did stick it out. I simply watched the mountain burn and stood by until the fire went south down to Malibu.
[03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:22.000]  So I was happy that the wrath of God spared a conservative filmmaker and sought out other targets unfortunately over in Malibu.
[03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:28.000]  That was very tragic. We're still recovering. But I want to thank everybody who contacted me.
[03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  A lot to cover today. First of all, I want to comment on the Mueller probe. It is expanding and not ending.
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:41.000]  If you can put up that link, it seems to me the endless investigation of everything is taking place.
[03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:48.000]  They're going to find a few indictments here and there for financial or procedural matters and keep it going.
[03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:53.000]  And the goal is to run out the clock to prevent the investigation of Spygate.
[03:21:54.000 --> 03:22:02.000]  Hillary and the Democrats colluded with the Russians and the CIA, FBI, DOJ, British intelligence to undermine Donald Trump.
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:09.000]  Two, three, four years down the road, it's going to be old news. No one wants to want to bother.
[03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:12.000]  That's the same thing that happened with the IRS interference.
[03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:21.000]  The Democrats used the IRS to interfere in the 2012 election to prevent Republicans from organizing by decimating the Tea Party groups.
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:23.000]  No one remembers or even talks about it.
[03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:33.000]  So I think that's what the Mueller investigation is attempting to achieve, is keep the damn thing going, run out the clock, and all the Spygate guys go free.
[03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:37.000]  All right, midterm elections. Did the Republicans win or lose?
[03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:47.000]  The most shocking and alarming thing to me is that several Democrats running as open radicals lost by less than 1%.
[03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:54.000]  Andrew Gillam in Florida put his picture up there, and of course there he is, nice guy, looks like a nice guy, friendly guy.
[03:22:55.000 --> 03:23:03.000]  Beto O'Rourke in Texas, Stacey Abrams, even one of them won, which was Code Pink's Kirsten Sinema in Arizona.
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:08.000]  So this is a shocking result, I think, for Republicans.
[03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:15.000]  And we're going to have coming on the air in a few minutes a writer named Brian Jundef from Denver.
[03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:20.000]  He's a physician, and he wrote on American Thinker, will Trump be the last American president?
[03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:23.000]  And there is definitely a new battlefield.
[03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:34.000]  The Democrats are controlling the emotions of women and minorities with baseless accusations, promises of government services, and higher taxes.
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:44.000]  Now, you'd think that a promise of higher taxes would not work, but with half the people not paying taxes, raising taxes means you get more services.
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:47.000]  Now, they don't tell you that that means you're going to lose your job.
[03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:55.000]  And that's the essence of the Democrat Party of radical socialism is they sell an alternate reality.
[03:23:55.000 --> 03:24:05.000]  With this alternate reality, most Western countries have flipped permanently into the socialist and globalist world, not nationalist.
[03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:11.000]  That includes our allies, of course, Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany, Sweden.
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:21.000]  You have 50% taxes as much as 75%, huge amount of immigration from third world countries, no rights to self-defense through gun ownership.
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:24.000]  The free speech is almost eliminated in Sweden.
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:29.000]  It's almost a totalitarian country, terrible government health care.
[03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:38.000]  This is the future that the Democrats and the radicals want to bring America into this future of these other Western countries that were unable to resist it.
[03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:46.000]  Trump is calling for nationalism, a re-energizing of our national goals of our constitution.
[03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:58.000]  But the forces of the media, the money people, George Soros and globalism have achieved only a 1%, less than 1% difference in these elections.
[03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:10.000]  The alternate reality of socialism, of course, is the idea that the government, you give the government all your property, give it your right to self-defense, give up your guns,
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:16.000]  and the government will control all the businesses, will break up all these businesses and it will be run by the government.
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:21.000]  And people have largely gone along with this without realizing how bad it is.
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:25.000]  I like to give the example of the Israeli left in Israel.
[03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:30.000]  The left has sold an alternate reality several years ago, 20 years ago.
[03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:42.000]  The Israeli left said, hey, let's bring these terrorists into Israel, we'll give them land, we'll give them weapons, we'll give them a right to bear arms.
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:46.000]  And they brought the PLO into Israel, they set up a country for them.
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:55.000]  And the result was 30 years of war, thousands of Israelis dead in the streets because the left sold an alternate reality.
[03:25:55.000 --> 03:26:05.000]  Let's take a quick look at this video of Bernie Sanders and Obama selling the alternate reality and we'll have our guest after the break.
[03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:06.000]  Let's take a look.
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:21.000]  And here is a New Year's resolution that I will keep if elected president and that is if Wall Street does not end its greed, we will end it for them.
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:29.000]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:54.000]  Not only will big banks not be too big to fail, but big time bankers will not be too big to jail.
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:27:06.000]  Okay, so this is the alternate reality of Marxism and socialism. Bernie Sanders wants to break up the banks, break up the pharmaceutical companies.
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:18.000]  The state bureaucrats take charge of health care of all these American businesses and we saw the result under Obama, a little part of it, economic stagnation, no growth, food stamps for 40 million people.
[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:23.000]  The mob that you see on the streets chasing down Republicans did not come from nowhere.
[03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:34.000]  The mob was in control for eight years of Obama. They were the FBI, they were controlling the Environmental Protection Agency, they were abusing the IRS, they were abusing the FISA courts.
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:39.000]  So we've been talking about this for eight years almost now.
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:48.000]  The Republican establishment is finally waking up, Lindsey Graham suddenly became a conservative, Kevin McCarthy, even Marco Rubio, Mitch McConnell.
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:57.000]  But they're coming around about eight years too late. We've been talking about this for such a long time that these are radicals and we have to fight them.
[03:27:57.000 --> 03:28:10.000]  Mitt Romney, someone brought him my movie, Dreams for My Real Father, when he was running against Obama and said, you got to call out this guy and explain that his father was a Russian spy and Obama is a total fraud.
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:15.000]  And Mitt Romney said, oh, people don't want to talk about that, they just want to hear about the economy.
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:21.000]  Well, the voters in Florida and Texas and Arizona didn't care about the tremendous success with the economy.
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:26.000]  They cared about electing radical socialists along with voter fraud.
[03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:34.000]  I think America is in grave danger and they will not fool around if they get power again, they will make sure there is no fair election.
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:44.000]  After the break coming up, a doctor who wrote the article for American thinker called, is Donald Trump the last American president?
[03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:51.000]  We're going to talk about why this may be a reality after the break.
[03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:20.000]  It's designed to be large enough to cover your entire back. It's also perfect to wrap around your legs, knees or shoulder and neck.
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:22.000]  But I need to know their good quality.

[03:33:15.000 --> 03:33:21.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Joel Gilbert.
[03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:25.000]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.000 --> 03:33:27.000]  Come on.
[03:33:28.000 --> 03:33:29.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:30.000 --> 03:33:34.000]  Joel Gilbert with you, guest hosting this hour from the People's Republic of California.
[03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:36.000]  Please call in.
[03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:38.000]  We'll be taking calls in the next couple of segments.
[03:33:38.000 --> 03:33:45.000]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:57.000]  We are discussing the dangers of the slim margin of less than 1% that radical socialists openly received in the election.
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:34:12.000]  Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Andrew Gillum almost got elected in Florida. Of course, Beto O'Rourke in Texas almost took that seat while Kirsten Sinema won in Arizona on an open radical platform.
[03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:17.000]  My guest, Brian Jundef, is a doctor based in Denver.
[03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:19.000]  He's a writer for the American thinker.
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:23.000]  He wrote a piece called Will Trump Be the Last Republican President.
[03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:27.000]  Welcome to The Alex Jones Show. Brian, are you there?
[03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:30.000]  Yes, I'm here. Thank you, Joel. Good to be with you.
[03:34:31.000 --> 03:34:32.000]  Great to have you.
[03:34:33.000 --> 03:34:40.000]  So in this article you wrote about Will Trump Be the Last Republican President and you broke it down into three parts.
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:44.000]  You called it demeanor, demographics, and deception.
[03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:46.000]  Let's take these one by one.
[03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:48.000]  Let's start with demeanor.
[03:34:48.000 --> 03:35:03.000]  How is this affecting the ability of a Republican to win in the future, whether it's Trump, of course, 2020, even if he wins 2024, how does demeanor affect the ability of a Republican to win?
[03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:09.000]  Well, by demeanor, I don't mean it in a derogatory way. It's a positive demeanor.
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:21.000]  It's the fact that Trump really was the only of 17 very competent, qualified primary candidates, any of whom could have served as president.
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:26.000]  Whether we like their politics or not, most of them all had very good experience.
[03:35:27.000 --> 03:35:28.000]  Trump's the only one that won.
[03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:37.000]  Trump was the only one that could fight back against the media onslaught against all the forces on the left that were right against him.
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:39.000]  And none of the others would have made it.
[03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:45.000]  I think Trump is the only one that could have beaten Hillary Clinton in that election and could have survived.
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:48.000]  Imagine that Jeb Bush was president.
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:51.000]  He'd be going along with the establishment.
[03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:54.000]  We wouldn't have a quarter of the things we have now.
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:36:00.000]  Republican presidents wither under that type of pressure, but Trump has the demeanor to fight back.
[03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:06.000]  And if he's criticized, he will punch back harder than he's hit.
[03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:09.000]  He's a fighter. He's a street fighter from Queens.
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:15.000]  And unless we have somebody with that demeanor, they're not going to survive.
[03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:18.000]  The political environment is very toxic.
[03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:23.000]  95% of media coverage for Trump is negative.
[03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:29.000]  It wouldn't be much better with any other Republican might be 80% negative if it was K-6 or Bush or Rubio.
[03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:32.000]  But Trump can fight back and withstand that.
[03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  Yeah, look, you talked about, but even the ability to become president is going to require a junkyard dog like Trump.
[03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:51.000]  And the old rhino type of Republican candidates, even Ted Cruz, who I know very well,
[03:36:51.000 --> 03:36:56.000]  he kind of wanted to go establishment. He said, I will not go there.
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:36:59.000]  I will not engage in this type of talk.
[03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:04.000]  That's what he did in Texas. He did not want to mix it up with O'Rourke.
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:14.000]  And because Trump is kind of a one-off personality, can the Republicans produce someone who can fight even to win the presidency?
[03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:16.000]  That's a good question.
[03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:21.000]  I don't see anybody out there with his personality and demeanor that's willing to fight like that.
[03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:25.000]  Look at McCain, look at Romney, look what happened to them.
[03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:30.000]  They were media darlings and until the day they got the nomination and then the media turned on them and they didn't have an answer.
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:33.000]  They withered under the pressure and they lost.
[03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:36.000]  Obama was eminently beatable by a good candidate.
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:39.000]  I think Trump would have beaten them, but they didn't fight back.
[03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:46.000]  And I don't see an heir apparent in the Republican Party that has that skill or that fire in the belly to do that.
[03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:50.000]  Okay, let's talk about the next one.
[03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:53.000]  Yeah, okay, next one is demographics.
[03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:59.000]  Go ahead and tell us what you wrote about as regards Texas, Florida.
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:12.000]  I can tell you that people in California, the California dream is to move to Texas to get away from the high taxes and the illegal immigrants, you know, driving around without insurance, all the issues.
[03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:16.000]  And I know a lot of New Yorkers who are quite liberal move to Florida.
[03:38:17.000 --> 03:38:25.000]  How is that and what other things are possibly going to flip those states to Democrat states in a future presidential election?
[03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:29.000]  They leave those states, but they bring their liberal values with them.
[03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:39.000]  So they may not like living in a liberal state or a liberal city, but they still have their values with them and they bring them into the voting booth.
[03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:45.000]  So you're having more Democrat voters populating Texas and Florida.
[03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:56.000]  And if you look at the 2016 election, Trump won by 77 electoral votes, 67 electoral votes are Texas and Florida.
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:39:02.000]  So imagine that those two states are flipped blue and all they need is one more state.
[03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:08.000]  You can pick off Michigan, Ohio, one of the Midwestern states and its lights out for Republicans.
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:15.000]  And this is not a one off thing. This is not transient. If these people populate these states, they're staying there.
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:19.000]  Are they going to change from liberal to conservative? Not very likely.
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:22.000]  So demographics are shifting.
[03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:29.000]  You have illegal immigration. You have illegal immigrants populating a lot of the Southern states.
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:33.000]  A lot of them are voting whether they shouldn't be or not, but they are.
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:37.000]  And they're more than likely going to vote Democrat.
[03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:42.000]  And then you look in Florida that just allowed a million felons to now vote.
[03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:48.000]  Imagine if even 5% of the felons vote, that's 50,000 votes.
[03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:55.000]  The governor and senator race in Florida were decided by a few tens of thousands of votes.
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:39:59.000]  So 5% of the felons vote for the Democrat. That's it.
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:03.000]  Scott and DeSantis wouldn't have won.
[03:40:04.000 --> 03:40:09.000]  So if you're seeing demographic shifts like that, they're going to turn these red states blue.
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:13.000]  Right. Let's mention Georgia also, a very conservative state.
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:21.000]  And by less than 1% or 1%, an open radical socialist is still trying to take the governorship.
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:26.000]  And I would also argue it's not just lights out for the Republican Party.
[03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:30.000]  It's lights out for America. It's lights out for the U.S. Constitution.
[03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:41.000]  Obama showed that the Democrats would use the tools of state, IRS, FBI, DOJ, CIA to suppress and interfere with the will of the people.
[03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:50.000]  The next Democrat president will most certainly not allow a fair election and use every tool in their power to keep a permanent hold on power.
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:56.000]  So I would argue that's the danger is for the Constitution.
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:04.000]  They will eliminate amendment after amendment, appoint radical judges as Obama did. We got a taste of it.
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:13.000]  Last one is deception. How is the third one going to affect the ability of a Republican to win in the future? Deception.
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:23.000]  Well, deception is the cheating that we're seeing. You're seeing in California and Arizona and Florida votes that really don't make sense.
[03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:32.000]  When the Republican governor wins in Arizona by 300,000 votes and that doesn't carry down to the Senate race,
[03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:42.000]  sure, you can make an argument about the candidate, McSally, not being a strong conservative and being never Trump and all of that.
[03:41:43.000 --> 03:41:53.000]  But still, these traditionally red states all of a sudden have an overwhelming number of blue votes, a lot of them being found at the last minute.
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:42:03.000]  So the Democrats are trying to literally steal elections. You're seeing that in Florida. It's the provisional ballots. It's not counting voting irregularities, etc.
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  And what they can't win outright, they will steal. And again, all it takes is a couple of states where you have these irregularities.
[03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:21.000]  And I don't see much pushback. Where are the Republicans? The Republican Party is, for the most part, silent on all of this.
[03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:31.000]  But this was the other way around, and this was 2008, and votes were being stolen from Obama. That's all that we'd hear about.
[03:42:32.000 --> 03:42:34.000]  The Democrats would be outraged and would be...
[03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:43.000]  We've got to jump to a break. One second. Call in 877-8789-2539. We're going to take a break and come back for a few minutes.
[03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:50.000]  With the author of Will Trump Be the Last Republican President, we'll be right back after the break.
[03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:31.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:45.000]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:44:00.000]  X3, now available at M4sLife.com.
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:28.000]  Now I want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future. I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going.
[03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:38.000]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially. I want to push all the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.

[03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:28.000]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news. Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now, your host, Joel Gilbert.
[03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:42.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Joel Gilbert, final segment coming to you from the People's Republic of California. We are speaking with Dr. Brian Jundef, a writer for the American thinker.
[03:47:42.000 --> 03:48:00.000]  Will Trump be the last Republican president based on these states flipping traditional Republican states? Arizona, Florida, Texas have shown that 49.95% of the electorate are voting for radical socialists.
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:07.000]  Let's go to our call. Let's take Derek in North Carolina. Question for our guest.
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:18.000]  I'm calling, yeah, just to comment on this exact situation here. And are these states really flipping? I don't think that they are.
[03:48:19.000 --> 03:48:24.000]  I don't think that any of us who have been really watching the situation know or think that they are.
[03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  And there's all this evidence of election tampering, of fraud, and that's just what we're seeing on the surface, what they're blatantly doing. And so my thinking is along these lines.
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:50.000]  I'm interested to know your thoughts on this. When President Trump won, there were allegations, are allegations still to this day of Russian meddling and we've got the probe and it's ongoing and it's relentless and it's ridiculous.
[03:48:50.000 --> 03:49:05.000]  And it's all bupkis, right? But what about meddling in the election by U.S. citizens? Is that not then technically treason? And that might sound crazy or over the top, or maybe not.
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:08.000]  I think it's perfectly reasonable to think that because it.
[03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:21.000]  All right, thanks for the call. Look, Dr. Jindef, we know that there's massive voter fraud by Democrats. We have the alignment of NBC News, the entire media complex.
[03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:30.000]  Don't think they didn't coordinate the release of the Access Hollywood tape was coordinated. You've got enemies foreign and domestic, as it says in the Constitution.
[03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:45.000]  Can the Republicans overcome this just massive effort on every level by the leftist media, the Democrat Party, their globalist allies, local fraudulent election officials.
[03:49:46.000 --> 03:49:57.000]  How can, like the caller said that most people probably don't agree with all this nonsense, but somehow they're able to achieve electoral victory through all these different methods.
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:50:03.000]  Is there a path for Republicans to have another Republican president? And what is it?
[03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:15.000]  Well, there is a path, but we haven't seen it in the past two years. Yes, the 2016 election, the deep state, the Obama FBI and DOJ tampered in the election.
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:31.000]  They tried to prevent Trump from getting elected and disrupt his transition. And since then, it's been the Russian collusion narrative and trying to undermine his presidency, have him impeached, nag him to the point where he resigns, anything to stop him.
[03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:37.000]  And there's been very little pushback. I hear about all these sealed indictments. I haven't seen any yet.
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:44.000]  I haven't seen any of the deep state players arrested, charged with anything.
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:51.000]  The FISA documents have still not been released. So I'm not particularly confident, at least today.
[03:50:52.000 --> 03:50:54.000]  I'm not up to Mr. Geithner.
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:59.000]  Broad, and they get away with it. Who's stopping them?
[03:50:59.000 --> 03:51:08.000]  Right. Look, I'll agree that I don't know why I get the theory was Trump was waiting till after the midterms to really clean up the clean house.
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:19.000]  Maybe he's just feels somehow neutralized by all these different actors and players coming after him. Now with the house flipped, there'll be no more investigations of the deep state.
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:26.000]  Let's go to Tammy in California from the People's Republic. You're on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead.
[03:51:26.000 --> 03:51:34.000]  Hi, Joel. It's Tammy. I just have to say first and foremost, for those liberals that are looking to go to Texas, Texas doesn't want you.
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:51.000]  Okay. So my question is this. We have been the number one state for fraud for many, many years. Why is it that the Californians don't get off their lazy bums and, you know, do something about all the fraud?
[03:51:51.000 --> 03:52:03.000]  And then in connection with that, they filled indictments. I haven't seen anything with the filled indictments either. There's like thousands.
[03:52:04.000 --> 03:52:11.000]  Okay, attention. What kind of fraud have you know about or have you experienced here in California other than what we read about?
[03:52:11.000 --> 03:52:27.000]  Well, I know for a fact, there's a lot more Republicans in the inland parts of the state of California because I live there and it's difficult for me to fathom that there's more Democrats in this state than there is Republicans.
[03:52:28.000 --> 03:52:35.000]  And so I've looked at the maps and the way that everything's broken down and there's a lot less blue on the map in California than there is red.
[03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:44.000]  So obviously, you know, Gavin Newsom, I'm sorry, but I really don't think he should have won. I think it was all frotted out.
[03:52:45.000 --> 03:52:53.000]  I think a lot of stuff is frotted out because I don't know if you've noticed, but Californians always seem to wait, always seem to vote to have their taxes raised.
[03:52:54.000 --> 03:52:56.000]  Really? Are we that stupid?
[03:52:56.000 --> 03:53:04.000]  So, yeah, I don't understand that. Why? And that's one of the most frustrating things for me in the state.
[03:53:05.000 --> 03:53:11.000]  Okay, good. That's a good point. Thanks for the call. Look, Dr. Jim Def, I see it everywhere I go.
[03:53:12.000 --> 03:53:20.000]  I don't think I've met very many people here in California and I do have friends across the board and they don't want higher taxes.
[03:53:20.000 --> 03:53:29.000]  They don't want marijuana legalized. They don't want illegals coming in and taking over the jobs and reducing wages.
[03:53:30.000 --> 03:53:38.000]  When I was in Chicago filming, there's no place like Utopia. All the people I met in the inner city, black people, they were almost like conservatives.
[03:53:39.000 --> 03:53:45.000]  They were saying, look, we don't want legalization of marijuana. We don't want illegals coming in our community. We want more police.
[03:53:45.000 --> 03:54:06.000]  Yet somehow the Democrats are controlling the emotions of people through their gender and identity politics to earn victories or combine with fraud that are seemingly giving them more and more power to the point, as you say, where we may not get another Republican president.
[03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:20.000]  Do you have a formula that you would recommend for the Republicans that they need to act now to make sure the Democrats don't continue their march to power that we know they'll never give up next time?
[03:54:20.000 --> 03:54:35.000]  The formula was two years ago. We gave Republicans control of the White House and both houses of Congress. And since then, we've had very little. Yes, we've had two good Supreme Court justices, tax cuts. The wall is not built.
[03:54:35.000 --> 03:54:50.000]  Obamacare is not repealed. Republicans in Congress have really dropped the ball on these issues. And it's not surprising that they lost the House. And you are correct that once Democrats get control of the White House and Congress, that's it.
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:55:01.000]  They will change the rules and they will never lose power again. 2016 was a fluke. They all expected Hillary to win. She didn't. They were caught off guard. That won't happen again.
[03:55:01.000 --> 03:55:13.000]  And unless we have a strong candidate that can follow in Trump's footsteps, you'll have a Democrat president. You'll have at least one House, if not both houses of Congress and Democrat hands and that's it.
[03:55:14.000 --> 03:55:21.000]  I don't think Republicans will ever get power again. Certainly not with a conservative candidate. They may get a John McCain type.
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:34.000]  Let me interrupt. We saw with Obama that once he took power, he just ruled by executive order. He didn't care about the Congress. And the media would not challenge these executive orders and the courts were in his favor.
[03:55:35.000 --> 03:55:47.000]  So nothing would typically happen with these executive orders. So you can imagine the next Democrat president simply saying, well, we have to protect the voting. We have to protect people from racism.
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:56:04.000]  So we're going to change all these rules and kick it down the road. Let's take another caller for, let's take Jefferson in Virginia. Jefferson in Virginia, that's another swing state. You're on the Alex Jones show.
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:15.000]  Hey, Joel. Hey, doctor. I think we have to recognize that all the rules are going out the window and if the Democrats are going to change the rules as soon as they get in power, we might as well do it ourselves.
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:24.000]  And there should be a different metric for qualifying for for voting, at least in national elections. There shouldn't be an attempt at anonymity when you vote.
[03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:35.000]  You should have a picture taken when you're voting and a picture ID should be necessary. And if you're on public assistance, you shouldn't be allowed to vote your award of the state until you get off of public assistance.
[03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:40.000]  Okay, that that that one's a little tough to do. But thanks for the call.
[03:56:40.000 --> 03:56:57.000]  Look, Dr. Jim Def, can you comment on we got about a minute left. The Democrats preventing voter ID laws trying to keep people on the rolls has that's been going on for years and years. Why aren't the Republicans trying to change that?
[03:56:58.000 --> 03:57:04.000]  Or are they so fearful of being charged with racism for forcing people to come with an ID?
[03:57:04.000 --> 03:57:11.000]  That's a really good question. Why haven't they they had the both houses of Congress in the White House for the past two years.
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:19.000]  Trump ran on building a wall and repealing Obamacare. Neither happened. Trump can't do either of those alone. He's dependent on Congress.
[03:57:20.000 --> 03:57:27.000]  And unfortunately, he's fighting a battle not only against the Democrats, but against a lot of establishment Republicans.
[03:57:27.000 --> 03:57:34.000]  And unless they're gone and they're going to sign on with the Trump agenda, he's an army of one.
[03:57:34.000 --> 03:57:57.000]  Thank you for being here and we'll see you next time here on the Alex Jones show. Thanks for tuning in.
[03:58:05.000 --> 03:58:14.000]  So we've already had incredible success, but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target.
