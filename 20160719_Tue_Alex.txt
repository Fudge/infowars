[00:00.000 --> 00:26.300]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, July 19, 2016, second day of the RNC Convention
[00:26.300 --> 00:31.200]  in Cleveland. Alex Jones will be joining us live from Cleveland. He'll be doing most
[00:31.200 --> 00:37.400]  of the show today. Before he gets on the line to do the show, I'm just looking at the headline
[00:37.400 --> 00:42.240]  news and we've got, guess what, yet another Muslim attack, another day, another Muslim
[00:42.240 --> 00:48.560]  attack. I was looking at this attack on the train. I kept saying to my wife, I said, well,
[00:48.560 --> 00:54.480]  you know, his name is Muhammad. And it's about half hour or so ago, they, they release information.
[00:54.480 --> 01:00.800]  Yeah. And it's, it's Muhammad. Of course, he's a child. So I guess maybe really what he needs
[01:00.800 --> 01:06.600]  is a teddy bear. Maybe Glenn Beck can go there and give him a teddy bear, this young child
[01:06.600 --> 01:11.400]  who came here. It's just so amazing to me. And we're going to talk about that in detail
[01:11.400 --> 01:16.440]  when we come back. You know, it's not just that one. Okay. It's, it's not just another
[01:16.440 --> 01:22.560]  day, another attack. Okay. We've got the axe attack, 18 people injured. Some of them fighting
[01:22.560 --> 01:28.320]  for their lives. Who knows how horribly they've been maimed elsewhere in France. So that was
[01:28.320 --> 01:33.360]  in Germany elsewhere in France. We've got a mother and her three daughters stabbed by
[01:33.360 --> 01:40.240]  a man because he thought they were inappropriately dressed. Okay. Guess what? He's going to
[01:40.240 --> 01:45.920]  be Muhammad too. Okay. Then we got another one. Okay. Third one here. This was another
[01:45.920 --> 01:54.040]  knife attack in Germany. This guy is his name is guess what? Muhammad. Yeah. It's kind of
[01:54.040 --> 01:57.320]  like that movie. Remember American Carol? They began the movie. They're out in the desert.
[01:57.320 --> 02:01.200]  There's a bunch of Muslims in the hills about to attack another city. And some guy stands
[02:01.200 --> 02:06.720]  up and he goes, Muhammad, and they all stand up. What? It's like either Muhammad or Ali
[02:06.720 --> 02:13.120]  or Muhammad Ali, which is this guy's name, Muhammad Ali Hussein, a bit of a lack of imagination
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.680]  in terms of names in that culture evidently. What he tried to do, there was a group of
[02:17.680 --> 02:24.960]  about 50 immigrants surrounding a policewoman and a policeman. And in that mob, Muhammad
[02:24.960 --> 02:34.000]  Ali came out and stabbed the woman, stabbed the woman. But he's going to not be deported.
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.320]  And his punishment will be cut in half because they say he's young age. Okay. He's claiming
[02:38.320 --> 02:45.520]  now that he was only 18, that he's 18. Okay. When actually they know that he's 26 years
[02:45.520 --> 02:50.080]  old, but that's okay. You know, if you're Hillary Clinton or you're a Muslim, the facts
[02:50.080 --> 02:54.120]  are all relative. It's whatever you feel like, you know, if you want to be a man, you can
[02:54.120 --> 02:58.120]  be a man, even if you're a woman or vice versa. If you feel, if you're feeling like you're
[02:58.120 --> 03:05.920]  18, even though you're 26, you can be, you know, 18 if you're an illegal immigrant. Not
[03:05.920 --> 03:09.760]  a problem. You know, it's just kind of, you can just transfer right out of those penalties.
[03:09.760 --> 03:15.160]  And you know what, just back in May 10, when I found this, when I was looking for details
[03:15.160 --> 03:20.960]  on the axe attack on the train, I'm looking for German train attack. And I find yet another
[03:20.960 --> 03:26.840]  one, a Munich knife attack. This happened in Germany. This was back on May the 10th.
[03:26.840 --> 03:34.520]  Yes. This is also an Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar. Okay. Which I guess is really kind of Arabic
[03:34.520 --> 03:40.440]  for move on. There's nothing to see here. They're saying in this particular case that
[03:40.440 --> 03:45.960]  he suffered from psychiatric issues. Yeah. Yeah. It's an insane religion. It truly is.
[03:45.960 --> 03:51.480]  He suffered from insane psychiatric issues. They also said he's a German citizen, a German
[03:51.480 --> 03:57.800]  citizen now. So, you know, again, no, don't blame it on Islam. Don't blame it on migrants.
[03:57.800 --> 04:01.160]  I think we need to stop calling it Stockholm syndrome. And I think we need to start calling
[04:01.160 --> 04:06.600]  it the Merkel syndrome, because that's really what's going on. Meanwhile, we've got CNN's
[04:06.600 --> 04:15.080]  Peter Bergen, as we pointed out over the weekend, blaming the truck attack by that Mohammed
[04:15.080 --> 04:20.080]  as a, as European fascism. You know what, let's be a little bit more accurate with this.
[04:20.080 --> 04:26.520]  More accurately, it's the rise of Muslim fascism in Europe, because that's why they were brought
[04:26.520 --> 04:31.400]  here. That's why all these young men, single men, were brought here by Angela Merkel and
[04:31.400 --> 04:36.760]  the elite. They wanted a clash of civilization. They've got it. We look at this other article
[04:36.760 --> 04:40.800]  from the Drudge Report on the sun. Look at what they did the way they reported this on
[04:40.800 --> 04:45.480]  British television. What they did was they've had to report this niece attack, the one with
[04:45.480 --> 04:52.280]  the truck. They put a woman in a hijab. And they said, really, would you have done that?
[04:52.280 --> 04:56.240]  You really want to avoid the fact that Muslims dominate women, don't you? That's what they
[04:56.240 --> 05:00.600]  did. Can you imagine if they'd done an orthodox Jew to talk about Israeli issues for the Palestinians
[05:00.600 --> 05:01.600]  to be right back?
[05:01.600 --> 05:07.520]  Turkey's Ministry of Education announced Tuesday it fired 15,000 personnel, including 1,500
[05:07.520 --> 05:12.440]  university deans, or alleged involvement with the group. The government claims plotted Friday's
[05:12.440 --> 05:18.000]  deadly failed coup and the latest mass crackdown against government workers there, reports
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.720]  Fox News. The government accused U.S.-based Claire Gullen for plotting the coup and demanding
[05:23.720 --> 05:28.560]  the U.S. extradite him. Turkey sent dousers containing details of Gullen's activities
[05:28.560 --> 05:34.320]  to the U.S., the deputy prime minister said. Earlier, Secretary of State John Kerry said
[05:34.320 --> 05:39.400]  that while he recognized the need to apprehend the coup plotters, quote, we caution against
[05:39.400 --> 05:45.120]  a reach that goes beyond that end, quote, sweeping purges in the aftermath of the coup have been
[05:45.120 --> 05:51.640]  seen in the dismissal of thousands from the judiciary, police force, military, administrative
[05:51.640 --> 05:57.720]  and religious affairs departments. You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[05:57.720 --> 06:03.560]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why
[06:03.560 --> 06:05.280]  is this so good?
[06:05.280 --> 06:09.920]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[06:09.920 --> 06:14.600]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[06:14.600 --> 06:20.280]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[06:20.280 --> 06:25.920]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[06:25.920 --> 06:30.360]  spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all
[06:30.360 --> 06:31.360]  parasites.
[06:31.360 --> 06:33.680]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[06:33.680 --> 06:38.640]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend
[06:38.640 --> 06:41.360]  doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[06:41.360 --> 06:44.640]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just
[06:44.640 --> 06:49.160]  came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose full of stuff
[06:49.160 --> 06:54.600]  that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank
[06:54.600 --> 06:58.040]  you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on
[06:58.040 --> 06:59.040]  this great product.
[06:59.040 --> 07:05.120]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously
[07:05.120 --> 07:09.840]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why. My friends,
[07:09.840 --> 07:14.600]  we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse. So please listen. Solar
[07:14.600 --> 07:20.240]  generators really do provide life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators, solar generators
[07:20.240 --> 07:25.240]  run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous
[07:25.240 --> 07:30.080]  summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer
[07:30.080 --> 07:33.480]  through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get one
[07:33.480 --> 07:39.000]  this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.360]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition
[07:43.360 --> 07:49.240]  to the low price for M4Wars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com.
[07:49.240 --> 07:54.240]  That's gridwars.com. It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum
[07:54.240 --> 08:17.240]  money. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[08:24.240 --> 08:30.760]  Well, if you look to the left, if you look to the right, you see globalist-controlled
[08:30.760 --> 08:36.360]  political parties all over the world. And when you see people like Nigel Farage or Ron
[08:36.360 --> 08:43.760]  Paul or folks like Donald Trump, they are riding the populous wave of resistance, smashing
[08:43.760 --> 08:48.200]  through the lives of disinformation and exposing just how controlled the system has gotten
[08:48.200 --> 08:55.640]  Alex Jones here live, about 300 yards away from the main entrance of the RNC meeting
[08:55.640 --> 09:02.320]  2016. And we're going to be here for the next four hours today. We've got our reporters,
[09:02.320 --> 09:08.040]  Wayne Madsen and Josh Owens, going back into the lion's den today. We also have Leanne
[09:08.040 --> 09:12.920]  McAdoo and, of course, Margaret Howe, also going to be on the street talking to some
[09:12.920 --> 09:18.600]  of the socialist and BLM radical groups that are George Soros funded on the street. We've
[09:18.600 --> 09:25.360]  got Joe Biggs and Richard Reeves out roving as well. We've got billboards driving around
[09:25.360 --> 09:29.800]  on big trucks. We have digital billboards, Hillary for prison. And magically, there's
[09:29.800 --> 09:34.440]  a radio station that just popped up on an open frequency, 94.5. Everybody's talking
[09:34.440 --> 09:38.920]  about and listening to, and we have big banner trucks telling folks about that. So we have
[09:38.920 --> 09:43.560]  InfoWars radio cutting through the lives of disinformation. As soon as I learned that
[09:43.560 --> 09:51.960]  Hillary was censoring our aircraft over this event via Obama and the FAA, which they've
[09:51.960 --> 09:56.320]  never done in any convention before, both at this conviction and the one coming up next
[09:56.320 --> 10:04.200]  week in Philadelphia, magically some flyers got printed up for 94.5 underground RNC radio,
[10:04.200 --> 10:10.800]  94.5 FM, and then magically, InfoWars.com, transmissions are being sent out on it, and
[10:10.800 --> 10:16.280]  magically, what is it, 4,000 of these flyers got handed out on the streets here at Cleveland,
[10:16.280 --> 10:20.640]  just magically, and then magically, because you censored us, there's a GoFundMe account,
[10:20.640 --> 10:24.720]  people are flooding with money, that a separate national air campaign company's running to
[10:24.720 --> 10:30.120]  put Hillary for prison banners up all over the nation, and then magically, it was in
[10:30.120 --> 10:35.960]  hundreds of newspapers over the weekend, hundreds of TV stations on ABC News nationally, CBS
[10:35.960 --> 10:42.200]  News nationally, CNN nationally, Fox News nationally, folks I talked to in New York
[10:42.200 --> 10:47.480]  saw it, an old Ted Nugent gave me a call today, actually last night we talked this morning,
[10:47.480 --> 10:52.320]  again, he's gonna be coming on the show in the next few days, that's how I get Ted Nugent
[10:52.320 --> 10:56.600]  on, not through his web servers, great crew, they're great people, they're all busy, I
[10:56.600 --> 11:00.320]  just kinda go, hey, Ted Nugent, we need you to come on the show, one time I said that
[11:00.320 --> 11:05.080]  about a year ago, and Ted called up that day, yeah, I heard the show, I wanna come on,
[11:05.080 --> 11:09.840]  so, Ted Nugent, by the way, was not invited to speak at this, the RNC didn't want him,
[11:09.840 --> 11:15.800]  it's not Trump, it's the RNC, they're scared of him, he's too radical, he's effective
[11:15.800 --> 11:20.760]  because he tells the truth in the face of radical globalist attacks on a republic, there
[11:20.760 --> 11:26.520]  are the radicals, our response meets and matches them, we're not the radicals defending what
[11:26.520 --> 11:31.840]  this country was founded on and what made us great, so, Ted Nugent will be heard at
[11:31.840 --> 11:36.240]  the RNC either tomorrow or the next day, we're looking for the best slot because he's playing
[11:36.240 --> 11:40.880]  300 shows a year, he's playing like six shows a week right now, he's in Florida, he just
[11:40.880 --> 11:48.320]  left Austin, and so that's all basically unfolding right now, so look for Ted Nugent
[11:48.320 --> 11:51.800]  here with us, Dinesh DeSousa, he's gonna be on the show tomorrow, we have an interview
[11:51.800 --> 11:56.680]  with Leon McAdoo with the filmmaker who's got the new film out that will bring down
[11:56.680 --> 12:01.080]  Hillary, way more hardcore than 2016, showing how they're organized crime and how the Clintons
[12:01.080 --> 12:05.640]  are an organized crime syndicate, and the point is, yes, you already know that, but
[12:05.640 --> 12:10.120]  now, after they made him a political prisoner, he's only doubled and tripled down, that's
[12:10.120 --> 12:18.960]  gonna be coming out nationwide as well, and that interview is up on infowars.com, here
[12:18.960 --> 12:23.800]  obviously is the big news that we have for everybody.
[12:23.800 --> 12:29.200]  Another religion apiece event took place on a train in Germany where people got killed
[12:29.200 --> 12:35.440]  by a ax-wielding Afghan immigrant who wasn't happy with all the welfare and all the other
[12:35.440 --> 12:41.000]  goodies, and of course, no mention of him being an Islamist, he had to read deeply into
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  the articles, even find out who he was, which is some crazy guy with an ax, like some crazy
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.880]  guy with a truck, or some crazy people in San Bernardino, or crazy people at Fort Hood,
[12:50.880 --> 12:56.040]  or crazy people in Paris at the Eagles of Death Concert, and crazy people out shooting
[12:56.040 --> 13:00.600]  the cops, and you had five cops dead, it was a big national deal, now three are shot dead
[13:00.600 --> 13:05.400]  in Baton Rouge, it's kind of like just blown over, I mean, come on, the police need to
[13:05.400 --> 13:10.640]  reform themselves, and again, folks, the globalists have been federalizing our police, the globalists
[13:10.640 --> 13:14.640]  have been causing most of the problems we have, but regardless, this is our country,
[13:14.640 --> 13:19.200]  our police, it's not George Soros' business, they'll finance a bunch of communist radicals
[13:19.200 --> 13:24.640]  and others to push an agenda of killing police, and then act like that's reform, it is outrageous
[13:24.640 --> 13:28.760]  sedition and destabilization against this country, now, obviously, here's the other
[13:28.760 --> 13:36.120]  big news, the spin machine is going into overdrive, and yes, I have a problem with Mike Pence,
[13:36.120 --> 13:41.520]  the governor of Indiana, for his globalist trade deals, but he's a Christian, he's pro-gun,
[13:41.520 --> 13:47.200]  he's pro-life staunch, he's a thousand times better than Newt Genrich, but here's the deal,
[13:47.200 --> 13:53.040]  he'll need Pence, who is a dealmaker, to navigate the House and the Senate and to work with
[13:53.040 --> 13:56.560]  the governors, and he has been the head of the governor's association and so many other
[13:56.560 --> 14:01.880]  things, it is not an issue compared to Hillary's crimes and her agenda to come after our basic
[14:01.880 --> 14:06.360]  liberties, and you see, singing in Fox News all of them, making a big deal out of Pence,
[14:06.360 --> 14:12.000]  they're trying to hype libertarians and conservatives into making this a big issue, when the issue
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.240]  is, what does Trump do once he gets in, if he uses Pence as a mechanism to get things
[14:17.240 --> 14:22.240]  done, but get a populist Americana agenda done, that's great, and that's what Trump says
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.000]  he's doing with this, and he goes in there with his no-nonsense 60-minute interview,
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.720]  we'll play some clips up later, and basically says, okay, vote for the Iraq War, he was
[14:30.720 --> 14:36.240]  given bad intelligence, the difference is Hillary's been involved in all the fake intelligence,
[14:36.240 --> 14:39.960]  and they spend that as hypocritical, no, this is who he's chosen, he didn't do the
[14:39.960 --> 14:45.040]  Iraq War, he was against the Iraq War, that's another reason I'm supporting Trump, so we're
[14:45.040 --> 14:50.280]  moving forward here, and this is a distraction from everything else that's happened, so I'm
[14:50.280 --> 14:54.200]  done talking about the Pence situation, if he gets into office and they go sideways,
[14:54.200 --> 14:58.640]  then it'll be an issue, right now we're facing Hillary, Rodham Clinton, the crime boss, who's
[14:58.640 --> 15:02.240]  coming after all of our liberties, all of our freedoms, and wants to sew this country
[15:02.240 --> 15:07.000]  up for the globalist, and we don't stop her, that's our problem.
[15:07.000 --> 15:12.720]  Take Mrs. Trump, Melania, 17-minute speech, we're gonna play parts of it, I get up this
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.440]  morning and I hear, oh my gosh, she plagiarized it, oh my gosh, she's such a horrible woman,
[15:17.440 --> 15:22.040]  the left is out calling her horrible names, calling her all this horrible stuff, she said,
[15:22.040 --> 15:25.240]  these are basically my words, put together with the speech writers, I only read it once
[15:25.240 --> 15:33.720]  because they're my words, and then I went and I read the Michelle Obama so-called speech,
[15:33.720 --> 15:38.960]  this is like saying if Melania Trump at her wedding played, here comes the bride, here
[15:38.960 --> 15:45.440]  comes the bride, all dressed in white, this is the standard speech that you intro, that
[15:45.440 --> 15:50.680]  every person intros about my values and my parents brought me up to do this, and this
[15:50.680 --> 15:56.240]  is what I stand for and it's why I love America, I don't know who first said this, it's been
[15:56.240 --> 16:02.040]  said for hundreds of years, this is the standard intro of a speech, and it's not even word
[16:02.040 --> 16:07.600]  for word, it's very different, but I've always talked about my family, my values being brought
[16:07.600 --> 16:19.200]  up to believe in these things, is that plagiarizing Mrs. Obama, I mean this is like if you claim
[16:19.200 --> 16:24.800]  that, I mean Starbucks wants a copyright now for their new symbol to be a green circle,
[16:24.800 --> 16:29.400]  in fact they've gone out and gotten that as their trademark, a green circle and they're
[16:29.400 --> 16:33.280]  claiming now they want the color green, Disney says they don't want you to be able to write
[16:33.280 --> 16:38.160]  the name Mickey Mouse in your own article because that word or that name is copyright,
[16:38.160 --> 16:42.960]  this is total red herring bull, but I'll tell you it's plagiarizing, Obama claims he's
[16:42.960 --> 16:46.880]  pro-America, Obama claimed he was a Christian, Obama claimed he was going to cut taxes, Obama
[16:46.880 --> 16:51.160]  claimed Obamacare was free, Obama claimed he wasn't coming after our guns, Obama claimed
[16:51.160 --> 16:55.920]  Obama claimed Obama claimed, when he's a foreign globalist operative here to destroy
[16:55.920 --> 17:00.920]  this country, so he's the impostor, he's the plagiarizer claiming he's an American, he's
[17:00.920 --> 17:05.800]  the plagiarizer claiming he's Americana, he's the plagiarer having his truth squads eight
[17:05.800 --> 17:09.440]  years ago run around the country saying we'll have you arrested if you lie about him and
[17:09.440 --> 17:14.080]  say he doesn't want to cut taxes, and if you say Obamacare isn't free, and if you say Obama
[17:14.080 --> 17:19.440]  isn't a Christian, I can play the truth squad news clips nationally and from Missouri and
[17:19.440 --> 17:25.680]  other states where they said we will arrest you if you say he's a Muslim, but we all
[17:25.680 --> 17:30.640]  know now he is a radical jihadi, we now know he's financed it worldwide, so Obama is the
[17:30.640 --> 17:35.880]  plagiarer, he's the impostor, he's the counterfeit, he's the fraud, he's the phony three dollar
[17:35.880 --> 17:40.520]  bill, he's the piece of trash, but I actually have screenshots of it, and I'm going to go
[17:40.520 --> 17:48.880]  over some of this coming up where I have screenshots of Melania's speech, and then I have screenshots
[17:48.880 --> 17:54.880]  of her supposed speech, and they are vastly different, but it's all the same thing about
[17:54.880 --> 18:00.400]  my values and my parents and why I love America, I mean it's just like Schwarzenegger's speech
[18:00.400 --> 18:06.440]  in 2004 at the RNC that I watched from 50 feet away, and I thought oh my gosh the same
[18:06.440 --> 18:13.040]  old speech everybody gives, I mean is this a tired speech, is this a speech everybody
[18:13.040 --> 18:19.720]  gives, but it's kind of true you see, I mean that's really what your roots are about, so
[18:19.720 --> 18:23.800]  it's like saying you know if she gave the Star Spangled Banner a salute, or if she did
[18:23.800 --> 18:29.920]  the salute of the flag and the national anthem or something people said oh she plagiarized,
[18:29.920 --> 18:38.960]  no, she's stating the common Americana theme, she's quoting what we are, who we are, and
[18:38.960 --> 18:43.080]  so you could see it as dry and old, you could see it as set over and over again, you could
[18:43.080 --> 18:48.040]  even say it's plagiarized for everybody else, but it's the American experience, so yeah
[18:48.040 --> 18:54.040]  I like fast cars, I like freedom, I like Apple Pie, I like the second amendment, I like free
[18:54.040 --> 19:01.440]  market, I like basic pro-family values, am I plagiarizing that, I guess so, I guess I'm
[19:01.440 --> 19:06.360]  plagiarizing it from my ancestors that helped found this country in 1775 and 1776, and my
[19:06.360 --> 19:09.920]  ancestors that helped found Texas, and my ancestors that were involved in every war
[19:09.920 --> 19:14.640]  and every fight for this republic, I'm not plagiarizing it, it's my blood, it's my genetics,
[19:14.640 --> 19:18.680]  it's who I am, it's my birthright, and Obama is the usurper that's coming in here trying
[19:18.680 --> 19:22.200]  to steal my birthright and your birthright, because it doesn't matter when your family
[19:22.200 --> 19:26.600]  got here, it doesn't matter if you weren't even born here like Trump's wife, she embraces
[19:26.600 --> 19:31.640]  America, she promotes freedom, she promotes prosperity, she promotes women's dignity
[19:31.640 --> 19:35.960]  and freedom, and that's why she's American, but it's bigger than America, it's about
[19:35.960 --> 19:40.240]  the renaissance worldwide, and when we come back we're gonna plow through a ton of news
[19:40.240 --> 19:45.640]  and the latest attempt last night for them to try to hijack and force a vote to steal
[19:45.640 --> 19:49.760]  the delegates, to steal the votes and not let Trump get the nomination, that failed,
[19:49.760 --> 19:53.560]  but our own Wayne Madsen and other reporters on the ground learned they've got a sneak
[19:53.560 --> 19:59.600]  attack coming Wednesday night, they plan to walk off as delegates implying that Trump
[19:59.600 --> 20:00.600]  has been overthrown.
[20:00.600 --> 20:06.440]  To a professional trader in precious metals, the key is spot price, spot price is market
[20:06.440 --> 20:11.420]  price, what gold or silver actually costs on the exchange, regular people looking to
[20:11.420 --> 20:17.400]  invest never get spot price, because resellers add fees for everything, refining, minting,
[20:17.400 --> 20:23.360]  brokerage costs, commissions, the public is never offered spot price, until now.
[20:23.360 --> 20:28.120]  In a limited new customer outreach, JM Bullion offers you the chance to own a 10 ounce bar
[20:28.120 --> 20:34.400]  of pure silver at spot price, no fees, commissions, markups, not even a shipping cost, now through
[20:34.400 --> 20:40.040]  JM Bullion own the most real investment of all at real cost, not a piece of paper from
[20:40.040 --> 20:46.840]  Wall Street or a bank, a 10 ounce bar of silver at spot price, that's a solid investment,
[20:46.840 --> 20:55.480]  but you must act now, go online to realpricedsilver.com for this limited time offer, that's realpricedsilver.com,
[20:55.480 --> 21:00.000]  realpricedsilver.com, limit one offer per household, 50 United States only.
[21:00.000 --> 21:05.240]  Yeah, first of all, I want to say, think of 12, that's a two, two per male, brain force,
[21:05.240 --> 21:10.440]  prostagart, silver bullet, I use them all, they're phenomenal, they work, buy them folks.

[21:12.840 --> 21:18.520]  I am a relatively short time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine

[22:03.880 --> 22:06.680]  to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead.
[22:06.680 --> 22:10.920]  This infection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like
[22:10.920 --> 22:15.320]  statins, pain meds, and antidepressants, and no, water treatment plants are not equipped
[22:15.320 --> 22:17.840]  to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[23:29.560 --> 23:33.240]  There is an affordable alternative to the high cost of healthcare that offers freedom
[23:33.240 --> 23:37.480]  from insurance while providing compliance with the Obamacare individual mandate.
[23:37.480 --> 23:41.680]  Imagine having access to quality, affordable healthcare that allows you the freedom to

[23:54.400 --> 23:56.680]  Go to libertyoncall.org.
[23:56.680 --> 24:17.360]  I've gotten pretty wound up and pretty angry because there's a story up on infowars.com
[24:17.360 --> 24:19.240]  that ties into all this.
[24:19.240 --> 24:26.520]  Tolerant receptors, media, calls Melania Trump a dumb bitch who can't speak English.
[24:26.520 --> 24:31.960]  Hillary supporters find with misogyny and bigotry when it comes to insulting a conservative.
[24:31.960 --> 24:36.920]  Of course, the media is piling on because when a woman threatens Hillary, she's got
[24:36.920 --> 24:37.920]  to be destroyed.
[24:37.920 --> 24:41.360]  When a woman exposes Bill Riping, she's got to be destroyed.
[24:41.360 --> 24:43.080]  This is what Hillary does.
[24:43.080 --> 24:49.400]  You have this lady get up and give a classic speech about her family and her roots and
[24:49.400 --> 24:52.520]  why she loves America and her values.
[24:52.520 --> 25:01.840]  It's vaguely like a few lines of speeches written by other speech writers by Michelle
[25:01.840 --> 25:02.840]  Obama.
[25:02.840 --> 25:07.440]  All I care about is the fact that somebody like Melania, I believe and she's shown, believes
[25:07.440 --> 25:08.720]  what she's saying.
[25:08.720 --> 25:17.920]  We know that Hillary and Michelle Obama and Barack Obama and all these other people, they
[25:17.920 --> 25:19.240]  really are out to get this country.
[25:19.240 --> 25:20.240]  They want to dominate it.
[25:20.240 --> 25:21.240]  They want to break it.
[25:21.240 --> 25:22.240]  They want to control it.
[25:22.240 --> 25:24.440]  That's what this election is all about.
[25:24.440 --> 25:28.880]  It's about a repudiation of the globalist and the Bush and Clinton crime family.
[25:28.880 --> 25:32.600]  You've got the Bushes and all the other top Republicans not coming to this thing.
[25:32.600 --> 25:37.120]  You've got the RNC operatives in there trying to block people like Ted Nugent saying he's
[25:37.120 --> 25:39.640]  too radical.
[25:39.640 --> 25:41.760]  Think about that.
[25:41.760 --> 25:46.720]  Ted Nugent's an absolute barn burner, loved by conservative populist all over the country.
[25:46.720 --> 25:50.600]  He has the mantle of Chuck Heston.
[25:50.600 --> 25:54.560]  He's the guy that helped get the NRA back in line to actually defend the Second Amendment
[25:54.560 --> 26:02.440]  and stop waffling with the help of gun owners of America and, of course, this show.
[26:02.440 --> 26:05.720]  And oh, we don't want you to speak too radical.
[26:05.720 --> 26:10.760]  It's a badge of honor that the RNC doesn't want Ted Nugent to speak.
[26:10.760 --> 26:11.920]  I don't even attempt to do it.
[26:11.920 --> 26:12.920]  I don't even...
[26:12.920 --> 26:14.040]  Let me explain this.
[26:14.040 --> 26:19.760]  I always intend to stay as a referee on the outside of things trying to simply awaken
[26:19.760 --> 26:20.760]  the people.
[26:20.760 --> 26:23.640]  I don't care about being invited to the White House if Trump wins.
[26:23.640 --> 26:26.360]  I can care less about eating off fine China.
[26:26.360 --> 26:27.760]  And I think Trump's the same as well.
[26:27.760 --> 26:30.240]  I actually want to see this country great again.
[26:30.240 --> 26:32.040]  I actually want to see industry here again.
[26:32.040 --> 26:36.760]  I know globalism is designed to deindustrialize us in a post-industrial world.
[26:36.760 --> 26:40.360]  That's the treaty that George Herbert Walker Bush signed us onto, but Congress didn't
[26:40.360 --> 26:41.360]  ratify.
[26:41.360 --> 26:44.240]  That's what agenda 21 is.
[26:44.240 --> 26:48.400]  They want to sit there and ridicule us for talking about that, acting like it doesn't
[26:48.400 --> 26:49.400]  exist.
[26:49.400 --> 26:50.400]  There's no world government.
[26:50.400 --> 26:51.760]  Oh, there's no carbon tax.
[26:51.760 --> 26:54.240]  Oh, none of this is true.
[26:54.240 --> 26:56.000]  We're not going away.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.480]  We're not backing off.
[26:57.480 --> 26:58.600]  We're not stopping.
[26:58.600 --> 27:04.920]  We're here overlooking the RNC with a vantage point on the globalist operatives inside trying
[27:04.920 --> 27:07.600]  to sabotage Donald Trump and derail it.
[27:07.600 --> 27:09.160]  And you heard me.
[27:09.160 --> 27:10.280]  You heard me.
[27:10.280 --> 27:12.280]  We have these neocons under siege.
[27:12.280 --> 27:17.520]  We have these rhinos under siege with aircraft and billboards and radio right here blasting
[27:17.520 --> 27:18.520]  everything.
[27:18.520 --> 27:22.200]  I'm going to go out on the street later today, I think, and just randomly walk around with
[27:22.200 --> 27:27.880]  a live feed, maybe even in the fourth hour, and just let you see how many people are listeners
[27:27.880 --> 27:29.720]  of every race, color, and creed.
[27:29.720 --> 27:30.720]  That's what scares the globalist.
[27:30.720 --> 27:33.480]  I guarantee you, you send mainline reporters out there.
[27:33.480 --> 27:34.920]  People don't even care who they are.
[27:34.920 --> 27:40.200]  But they love Info Wars because we are populist and we're bigger in many cases than the mainstream
[27:40.200 --> 27:41.200]  media.
[27:41.200 --> 27:43.080]  And that's not bragging about Info Wars.
[27:43.080 --> 27:47.560]  That's basically stating the exciting facts that their time is coming to an end.
[27:47.560 --> 27:52.800]  Their reign is coming to an end, and they know it, and Info Wars is only one focal point
[27:52.800 --> 27:53.800]  and one example of that.
[27:53.800 --> 27:58.840]  And I'm going to play part of my speech when we come back from yesterday with full 17-minute
[27:58.840 --> 28:02.400]  speeches up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[28:02.400 --> 28:04.960]  We've got better audio versions of it going up soon.
[28:04.960 --> 28:08.360]  This is something someone else shot just off an iPhone.
[28:08.360 --> 28:12.840]  We've kind of got a bottleneck of all the powerful videos and things that are going to be and
[28:12.840 --> 28:13.840]  interviews that we've already gotten.
[28:13.840 --> 28:17.760]  I'm going to surprise folks, they're going to be coming out today and tomorrow.
[28:17.760 --> 28:20.760]  But I just want you to know we're in a good position, you're in a good position if you
[28:20.760 --> 28:25.400]  realize we're in a good position with history on our side, with truth on our side, to really
[28:25.400 --> 28:29.120]  give the globalists a run for their money if we don't give up.
[28:29.120 --> 28:34.840]  But that's why they're changing the subject from what Melania Trump had to say in her
[28:34.840 --> 28:43.200]  speech to claiming a few lines of it sounded something like something Michelle Obama said.
[28:43.200 --> 28:50.520]  As if, see, there's the evil white racist woman stealing from the poor black lady again.
[28:50.520 --> 28:55.240]  There she is, the horrible slave owner, or she has no connection to that, but it doesn't
[28:55.240 --> 28:56.240]  matter.
[28:56.240 --> 29:01.480]  The horrible demon that actually ate black children, cooked them up in stew pots, Melania
[29:01.480 --> 29:07.080]  Trump, and of course Donald Trump's evil and racist and homophobic as well, because the
[29:07.080 --> 29:09.280]  mainstream media said so.
[29:09.280 --> 29:14.560]  This is just how they inject this narrative over and over and over again, but when we
[29:14.560 --> 29:21.600]  come back I've got part of the speech I gave, we'll play it from the intro, at the rally
[29:21.600 --> 29:24.520]  they tried to stop, the rally they tried to shut down, the rally the globalist failed
[29:24.520 --> 29:25.520]  that was extremely successful.
[29:25.520 --> 29:30.720]  I'd say there's probably about 1,000 people there, but what really mattered was that hundreds
[29:30.720 --> 29:34.880]  of newspapers and TV stations carried it and large chunks of what I said and what other
[29:34.880 --> 29:38.160]  people said and what Roger Stone said about the Clintons and their abuse of women and
[29:38.160 --> 29:41.880]  more of the Chinese missile secrets and selling us out to foreign powers.
[29:41.880 --> 29:46.720]  It all got out on TV, radio and print, all over the country yesterday, just like our
[29:46.720 --> 29:51.080]  aircraft with the Hillary for Prison did, devastating victories, we're just small, small
[29:51.080 --> 29:53.480]  part of the resistance.
[29:53.480 --> 30:19.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:19.320 --> 30:24.480]  The government accused U.S.-based Claire Gullen for plotting the coup and demanding the U.S.
[30:24.480 --> 30:25.480]  extradite him.
[30:25.480 --> 30:29.840]  Turkey sent dowsers containing details of Gullen's activities to the U.S.
[30:29.840 --> 30:31.840]  The deputy prime minister said.
[30:31.840 --> 30:37.000]  Earlier, Secretary of State John Kerry said that while he recognized the need to apprehend
[30:37.000 --> 30:42.280]  the coup plotters, quote, we caution against a reach that goes beyond that, end quote.
[30:42.280 --> 30:47.440]  Sweeping purges in the aftermath of the coup have been seen in the dismissal of thousands
[30:47.440 --> 30:49.160]  from the judiciary.
[30:49.160 --> 30:55.880]  This force, military, administrative and religious affairs departments, you can find more reports
[30:55.880 --> 30:57.760]  on infowars.com.
[30:57.760 --> 31:04.680]  More than two years ago, info wars first told you about our research into what has been
[31:04.680 --> 31:06.680]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[31:06.680 --> 31:10.800]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[31:10.800 --> 31:16.000]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.720]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[31:19.720 --> 31:23.440]  They took the good halogenin and put the deadly halogenin.
[31:23.440 --> 31:27.960]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[31:27.960 --> 31:30.400]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[31:30.400 --> 31:35.880]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[31:35.880 --> 31:41.640]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[31:41.640 --> 31:43.240]  ever concerning iodine.
[31:43.240 --> 31:45.200]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[31:45.200 --> 31:49.480]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[31:49.480 --> 31:51.440]  any optimum health regimen.

[33:17.000 --> 33:40.200]  On the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:47.000 --> 33:54.000]  It's really great to be here in 21, 2016, all beautiful people here, Americans, United,
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.000]  their race color is green, we're a red blood, loving liberty, and loving the First Amendment.
[34:00.000 --> 34:01.000]  It's amazing.
[34:01.000 --> 34:09.000]  I tell you, the establishment works for us and others, have done everything they can
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.480]  to try to shut down our free speech, they try to destroy our sovereignty, they try to
[34:13.480 --> 34:17.480]  attack our Second Amendment, and everything they've done is blood on their face.
[34:17.480 --> 34:22.480]  They are failing, and Donald Trump is surging in every major poll across the country.
[34:22.480 --> 34:32.480]  And of course what's happening is a lot better than Donald Trump or Ron Paul or Alex Jones
[34:32.480 --> 34:34.480]  or Madras or anybody.
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.480]  It's China who's about you, and people worldwide.
[34:38.480 --> 34:46.480]  Nationalism, sovereignty, true free market capitalism is rising worldwide as the globalists
[34:46.480 --> 34:48.480]  try to implement their world government.
[34:48.480 --> 34:51.480]  It is dead or alive.
[34:51.480 --> 34:59.480]  If you think you're awakening the dream so far is big, this planet and the globalists
[34:59.480 --> 35:07.480]  have not seen anything yet.
[35:07.480 --> 35:14.480]  One time, a few hours ago, they had one day, a pretty modest few girls out, recombined
[35:14.480 --> 35:16.480]  airplanes with banners.
[35:16.480 --> 35:22.480]  One day after we announced we were going to have lots more days of D&C and R&C cover
[35:22.480 --> 35:29.480]  but airplanes flying, as soon as that happened, as soon as that unfolded, they put an exclusive
[35:29.480 --> 35:32.480]  zone on shutting all aircraft down.
[35:32.480 --> 35:35.480]  That is because they're afraid of free speech.
[35:35.480 --> 35:41.480]  And that's what they always try to do, is come and disrupt people and take over their free
[35:41.480 --> 35:42.480]  speech.
[35:42.480 --> 35:43.480]  These are not liberals.
[35:43.480 --> 35:56.480]  These are anti-free speech, anti-freedom's come, but they need to get their asses more free.
[35:56.480 --> 36:00.480]  That's why George Floyd is trying to overstate the freeing everywhere else in the country.
[36:00.480 --> 36:05.480]  The tribes will be free and these globalists come down and they cause a bunch of division,
[36:05.480 --> 36:08.480]  they stir up a bunch of racism, and they get everybody fighting with each other.
[36:08.480 --> 36:09.480]  And you know what?
[36:09.480 --> 36:10.480]  It ain't working.
[36:10.480 --> 36:13.480]  All this garbage has left America together.
[36:13.480 --> 36:14.480]  It's coming.
[36:14.480 --> 36:15.480]  It's coming.
[36:15.480 --> 36:16.480]  It's coming.
[36:16.480 --> 36:17.480]  It's coming.
[36:17.480 --> 36:18.480]  It's coming.
[36:18.480 --> 36:19.480]  It's coming.
[36:19.480 --> 36:20.480]  It's coming.
[36:20.480 --> 36:21.480]  It's coming.
[36:21.480 --> 36:22.480]  It's coming.
[36:22.480 --> 36:23.480]  It's coming.
[36:23.480 --> 36:24.480]  It's coming.
[36:24.480 --> 36:25.480]  It's coming.
[36:25.480 --> 36:26.480]  It's coming.
[36:26.480 --> 36:30.480]  It's coming.
[36:30.480 --> 36:33.480]  It's coming.
[36:33.480 --> 36:36.480]  It's coming.
[36:36.480 --> 36:37.480]  It's coming.
[36:37.480 --> 36:44.480]  The answer, the answer to 1984 is 1776!
[36:44.480 --> 36:46.480]  Well done!
[36:46.480 --> 36:49.480]  1776!
[36:55.480 --> 36:57.480]  We're not back and down.
[36:57.480 --> 36:59.480]  We're not gathered.
[36:59.480 --> 37:01.480]  We're not going away.
[37:01.480 --> 37:09.480]  And every time the enemy does us, it just makes us stronger!
[37:09.480 --> 37:11.480]  She thinks they censored our airplanes.
[37:11.480 --> 37:15.480]  Now we're doing national campaigns for funding,
[37:15.480 --> 37:19.480]  where we're going to slam all over the country.
[37:19.480 --> 37:23.480]  And now we're going to push even harder with more Hillary for President Sharks.
[37:23.480 --> 37:28.480]  How many Hillary for President Sharks we got here today?
[37:28.480 --> 37:33.480]  We will get that meme, that meme, multiple times.
[37:33.480 --> 37:38.480]  As we have number one search term, about Brexit and Occamado.
[37:38.480 --> 37:43.480]  That's right, we're even getting a Nintendo or other money now.
[37:43.480 --> 37:48.480]  So, think about that, and think about that long and hard.
[37:48.480 --> 37:51.480]  I'm going to bring my money after a real quick show day.
[37:51.480 --> 38:04.480]  I'm going to shut down our free speech, and we're not going to have a big giant red light blue little finger!
[38:04.480 --> 38:10.480]  Hillary for President! Hillary for President!
[38:10.480 --> 38:14.480]  Hillary for President! Hillary for President!
[38:14.480 --> 38:20.480]  Hillary for President! Hillary for President!
[38:20.480 --> 38:24.480]  Hillary for President!
[38:24.480 --> 38:28.480]  She is crooked, Hillary.
[38:28.480 --> 38:30.480]  Now listen to the thing about memes.
[38:30.480 --> 38:32.480]  When you hear the truth, it's really hard to get it going.
[38:32.480 --> 38:34.480]  But when something's true, it's easy to get it going.
[38:34.480 --> 38:39.480]  Like, crooked Hillary, and Hillary for President.
[38:39.480 --> 38:43.480]  Can I tell you, it is absolutely beautiful to see what's happening.
[38:43.480 --> 38:44.480]  Joe, you've been here a few days.
[38:44.480 --> 38:47.480]  I've been by Joe Big's, great matriot, already dead.
[38:47.480 --> 38:50.480]  Hey, how's that? He's here now fighting for this country.
[38:50.480 --> 38:53.480]  That's the great part about what we're doing is the globalists want to say our veterans,
[38:53.480 --> 38:56.480]  our police, our patriots, the number one enemy.
[38:56.480 --> 38:59.480]  That shows you this is an obvious outside global sport.
[38:59.480 --> 39:03.480]  Of course they come here and say our veterans and our police are the enemy.
[39:03.480 --> 39:06.480]  Because they're the enemy, the globalists are the enemy.
[39:06.480 --> 39:09.480]  You guys are beautiful.
[39:09.480 --> 39:11.480]  I am seeing so much emotion out here.
[39:11.480 --> 39:15.480]  I love seeing each and every one of those Hillary for President shirts.
[39:15.480 --> 39:18.480]  It's loud and clear across the world.
[39:18.480 --> 39:20.480]  You guys are the best followers ever.
[39:20.480 --> 39:21.480]  You guys are the best.
[39:21.480 --> 39:23.480]  You understand what's going on.
[39:23.480 --> 39:24.480]  You violate.
[39:24.480 --> 39:26.480]  You're not asleep and what's going on.
[39:26.480 --> 39:28.480]  But we're sick and tired of what we've been seeing.
[39:28.480 --> 39:30.480]  That's why we want Donald Trump.
[39:30.480 --> 39:33.480]  That's right, close the door.
[39:33.480 --> 39:35.480]  That's the right time to make courage.
[39:35.480 --> 39:38.480]  But listen, don't include our faith in anyone in this.
[39:38.480 --> 39:41.480]  It's all of us together, the line of liberty.
[39:41.480 --> 39:44.480]  Coming together, nothing's going to be able to turn this around at the end.
[39:44.480 --> 39:46.480]  We're identifying the globalists.
[39:46.480 --> 39:48.480]  We're identifying their primary control.
[39:48.480 --> 39:50.480]  We're identifying what their operations are.
[39:50.480 --> 39:56.480]  And once the general public understands the paradigm, it's carried over.
[39:56.480 --> 39:58.480]  All right, folks.
[39:58.480 --> 40:00.480]  Again, that is an amateur person that uploaded that video.
[40:00.480 --> 40:03.480]  We're going to upload the HD and higher quality later today.
[40:03.480 --> 40:05.480]  But I wanted to air five, six minutes of that.
[40:05.480 --> 40:08.480]  We're going to have Wayne Madsen coming up in the next 15 minutes or so.
[40:08.480 --> 40:12.480]  Inside the convention center, it's about 300 yards away from me.
[40:12.480 --> 40:16.480]  We're overlooking it where last night he was able to talk to delegates
[40:16.480 --> 40:20.480]  and super delegates about the plan and the aftermath of them trying to steal
[40:20.480 --> 40:26.480]  the election from Trump, trying to have a no vote and not honor the popular vote.
[40:26.480 --> 40:30.480]  A bunch of, you know, never Trump people who promised they wouldn't do it.
[40:30.480 --> 40:32.480]  But then of course, as I predicted, they did it.
[40:32.480 --> 40:33.480]  It wasn't hard to predict.
[40:33.480 --> 40:35.480]  Now they're back at it again.
[40:35.480 --> 40:41.480]  This time they have a secret plan that Madsen discovered Wednesday to try to walk out
[40:41.480 --> 40:44.480]  at the end of Ted Cruz's speech.
[40:44.480 --> 40:49.480]  And we have Glenn Beck going on Meet the Press and actually coming out
[40:49.480 --> 40:51.480]  for Hillary Clinton for president.
[40:51.480 --> 40:55.480]  Truly seconding, ladies and gentlemen, there's a Business Insider article
[40:55.480 --> 40:56.480]  that's pretty good.
[40:56.480 --> 41:01.480]  That's linked up on DrudgeReport.com, the man who could have stopped Donald Trump.
[41:01.480 --> 41:06.480]  And they asked the question, why did Matt Drudge, who probably could have stopped
[41:06.480 --> 41:09.480]  Donald Trump, why did he not stop him?
[41:09.480 --> 41:13.480]  Well, he was very fair covering all the major Republican candidates,
[41:13.480 --> 41:19.480]  and I would say even lean towards people like Cruz early on, just from my watching.
[41:19.480 --> 41:23.480]  But as the dirty tricks rolled out and as the intimidation rolled out
[41:23.480 --> 41:27.480]  and as people bullied Drudge saying, don't you dare, you know,
[41:27.480 --> 41:30.480]  link to anything that Trump's doing when the media would lie about Trump,
[41:30.480 --> 41:33.480]  Drudge would actually put what Trump had said.
[41:33.480 --> 41:37.480]  But I haven't talked to Drudge about this, but this is my same reason for supporting Trump.
[41:37.480 --> 41:43.480]  So I'm guessing this is why Drudge did it, because this is why I'm supporting Trump.
[41:43.480 --> 41:47.480]  It became apparent that they were stealing the election from Bernie Sanders.
[41:47.480 --> 41:51.480]  It became apparent they were going to give it to Hillary, and here's the deal.
[41:51.480 --> 41:55.480]  Forget anybody but Trump, anybody but Hillary.
[41:55.480 --> 41:58.480]  I mean, you watch Trump's courage out there with the death threats.
[41:58.480 --> 42:02.480]  You watch him lose all these businesses and golf courses and hotel deals
[42:02.480 --> 42:06.480]  and beauty pageant deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[42:06.480 --> 42:08.480]  You watch him spend 50 million of his own money.
[42:08.480 --> 42:10.480]  You watch him say Hillary for president.
[42:10.480 --> 42:13.480]  You watch him say our economic surrender is over.
[42:13.480 --> 42:16.480]  You watch him expose Hillary as a communist Chinese agent.
[42:16.480 --> 42:21.480]  You watch him come out and expose that Black Lives Matter as a George Soros group
[42:21.480 --> 42:23.480]  to destabilize the country.
[42:23.480 --> 42:29.480]  I've gone from holding my nose 14, 15 months ago supporting Trump to being 100% behind him.
[42:29.480 --> 42:31.480]  100% behind him.
[42:31.480 --> 42:35.480]  And I think I can speak for Drudge just because I know Drudge is a common sense guy.
[42:35.480 --> 42:37.480]  You know, I've read his writing. I've seen what he links to.
[42:37.480 --> 42:40.480]  I've gotten a pulse for what Drudge thinks.
[42:40.480 --> 42:43.480]  And I think that I can give you a dead reckoning guess here
[42:43.480 --> 42:47.480]  that it's exactly why I just told you he's supporting Trump.
[42:47.480 --> 42:50.480]  But that'd be like if I guessed why you supported Trump.
[42:50.480 --> 42:53.480]  I mean, is it the same reason? He's the underdog.
[42:53.480 --> 42:55.480]  Both political parties are against him.
[42:55.480 --> 42:58.480]  The establishment we hate that keeps giving us new world order is against him.
[42:58.480 --> 43:00.480]  The whole power structure is throwing money against him.
[43:00.480 --> 43:02.480]  The media is lying against him.
[43:02.480 --> 43:05.480]  The media is distorting what he said.
[43:05.480 --> 43:09.480]  And he's running against Hillary Clinton.
[43:09.480 --> 43:14.480]  I mean, that is a no-brainer why Matt Drudge supported Donald Trump
[43:14.480 --> 43:17.480]  because he's clearly the best choice.
[43:17.480 --> 43:19.480]  He's clearly the guy we need.
[43:19.480 --> 43:25.480]  And it's such an epic time to be alive historically at this crossroads
[43:25.480 --> 43:29.480]  where the choice is so clear.
[43:29.480 --> 43:33.480]  I don't think Donald Trump's going to be perfect. Nobody is.
[43:33.480 --> 43:36.480]  But he is not out to get this country.
[43:36.480 --> 43:38.480]  And he does want to make this country great again.
[43:38.480 --> 43:41.480]  That's why he's got my full backing.
[43:41.480 --> 43:45.480]  And by the way, that means you're full backing.
[43:45.480 --> 43:52.480]  I began to support Trump early on because I knew Hillary would be the nominee.
[43:52.480 --> 43:54.480]  And I said, I hope I'm right.
[43:54.480 --> 43:56.480]  But my gut tells me I'm going the right direction.
[43:56.480 --> 43:58.480]  It's never been wrong.
[43:58.480 --> 44:02.480]  And I tell you, a lot of you that haven't supported Trump
[44:02.480 --> 44:04.480]  are going to feel really stupid.
[44:04.480 --> 44:06.480]  And I think it's about a 50% chance they're going to kill him.
[44:06.480 --> 44:09.480]  And so when they blow his plane up or shoot him in front of everybody,
[44:09.480 --> 44:12.480]  those of you that were going, oh, I'm the purest.
[44:12.480 --> 44:13.480]  I'm for Ted Cruz.
[44:13.480 --> 44:14.480]  Oh, I'm the purest.
[44:14.480 --> 44:15.480]  I'm for all this bull.
[44:15.480 --> 44:18.480]  Ted Cruz is bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs
[44:18.480 --> 44:20.480]  and bought and paid for by the Bushes.
[44:20.480 --> 44:21.480]  And it's been proven.
[44:21.480 --> 44:26.480]  And I held my nose and hoped he'd just gotten basically incubated by them,
[44:26.480 --> 44:28.480]  but it woken up.
[44:28.480 --> 44:30.480]  But because the Bush name is dead now politically,
[44:30.480 --> 44:33.480]  I'm telling you, he would be their third term.
[44:33.480 --> 44:37.480]  And I don't want to dislike Ted Cruz,
[44:37.480 --> 44:39.480]  but the guy is a phony.
[44:39.480 --> 44:41.480]  He's a phony Texan.
[44:41.480 --> 44:44.480]  And I get really irritated by guys with lizard skin boots
[44:44.480 --> 44:47.480]  and cowboy hats sticking their fingers in their pockets
[44:47.480 --> 44:50.480]  and walking around going, oh, I'm a cowboy.
[44:50.480 --> 44:52.480]  I mean, it makes me sick.
[44:52.480 --> 44:54.480]  The guys all had no cattle.
[44:54.480 --> 44:56.480]  And I'm not getting off into a fight about Cruz.
[44:56.480 --> 45:00.480]  But Trump has issued the olive branch to Cruz.
[45:00.480 --> 45:02.480]  He's been sneaking around behind the scenes.
[45:02.480 --> 45:04.480]  And it's his people.
[45:04.480 --> 45:09.480]  And about your fake people and cowboy hats wearing Texas shirts.
[45:09.480 --> 45:11.480]  You might want to throw up.
[45:11.480 --> 45:16.480]  And it's a Texas coalition of carpet baggers from Texas.
[45:16.480 --> 45:17.480]  Boys, is that reverse psychology?
[45:17.480 --> 45:18.480]  That's what's going on.
[45:18.480 --> 45:24.480]  A bunch of fake Texans up here in Cleveland,
[45:24.480 --> 45:29.480]  degrading my state, degrading my heritage with this phony Canadian.
[45:29.480 --> 45:31.480]  Nothing against Canadians, but my God,
[45:31.480 --> 45:33.480]  I'm not up there trying to run your country.
[45:33.480 --> 45:34.480]  It's like Schwarzenegger.
[45:34.480 --> 45:36.480]  Even if I like Schwarzenegger, which I don't,
[45:36.480 --> 45:38.480]  the guy's not from here, man.
[45:38.480 --> 45:41.480]  Dude, go to Austria and run for president.
[45:41.480 --> 45:42.480]  Polls show you'd win.
[45:42.480 --> 45:44.480]  I mean, go to your country.
[45:44.480 --> 45:45.480]  Go to your homeland.
[45:45.480 --> 45:48.480]  He's an open borders guy anyways and anti-gun.
[45:48.480 --> 45:52.480]  What I'm getting at is the reign of fake conservatives is coming to an end.
[45:52.480 --> 45:55.480]  Donald Trump, Matt Drudge, Alex Jones,
[45:55.480 --> 45:57.480]  we all herald the end of this.
[45:57.480 --> 45:59.480]  And I want to give credit where credit's due.
[45:59.480 --> 46:02.480]  Even mainstream media says, okay, Matt Drudge is the only guy
[46:02.480 --> 46:03.480]  that probably could have stopped Trump.
[46:03.480 --> 46:04.480]  Well, that's right.
[46:04.480 --> 46:07.480]  The grassroots could have stopped Trump.
[46:07.480 --> 46:12.480]  That's why we were reached out to very early on by the Trump people.
[46:12.480 --> 46:15.480]  When I was already supporting it, it was because they understood that.
[46:15.480 --> 46:17.480]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[46:17.480 --> 46:22.480]  But it is important for the Trump people to not let the rhinos that are left in the party
[46:22.480 --> 46:25.480]  keep people out of the tent that built the tent like Ted Nugent.
[46:25.480 --> 46:28.480]  By the way, Ted Nugent doesn't need to be at this RNC.
[46:28.480 --> 46:31.480]  But it's pure baloney that he wanted to be here early on.
[46:31.480 --> 46:34.480]  And they just said, no, you're too radical, not Trump at the RNC.
[46:34.480 --> 46:38.480]  And Ted Nugent's too cool of a guy to sit there and go,
[46:38.480 --> 46:41.480]  bitch, you're complaining to Donald Trump who he knows.
[46:41.480 --> 46:46.480]  But again, this is how this stuff operates.
[46:46.480 --> 46:49.480]  This is how they get things done.
[46:49.480 --> 46:51.480]  And I'm sitting here on Business Insider.
[46:51.480 --> 46:55.480]  It says, David former KKK Grand Wizard, he's with Trump.
[46:55.480 --> 46:58.480]  Are you?
[46:58.480 --> 47:01.480]  I mean, that is, well, you've got a grand dragon on California for Hillary.
[47:01.480 --> 47:04.480]  Does that mean that, you know, that she's for the KKK?
[47:04.480 --> 47:06.480]  Well, in her case, actually she is.
[47:06.480 --> 47:10.480]  That's when she got toodled by was Senator Robert Byrd,
[47:10.480 --> 47:12.480]  who was actually a real grand dragon.
[47:12.480 --> 47:16.480]  But going deeper into this article, it's a larger issue than just Drudge.
[47:16.480 --> 47:19.480]  You read the article and it says, oh my gosh, Drudge gave an interview,
[47:19.480 --> 47:23.480]  an exclusive when he doesn't give them every few years, to infowars.com.
[47:23.480 --> 47:26.480]  He's so horrible.
[47:26.480 --> 47:31.480]  And it's got Glenn Beck criticizing Drudge here.
[47:31.480 --> 47:37.480]  And then they don't even give you a link to the Drudge 45 minute interview.
[47:37.480 --> 47:39.480]  They have Glenn Beck popping off in the article.
[47:39.480 --> 47:43.480]  So we're going to take their headline, we're going to post it,
[47:43.480 --> 47:45.480]  but point out that they didn't let you actually hear what Drudge had to say.
[47:45.480 --> 47:50.480]  So here's the 45 minute interview if you actually want to know what's going on.
[47:50.480 --> 47:54.480]  So all the general tactics, how am I really attacking this article?
[47:54.480 --> 47:57.480]  It's written kind of from both sides schizophrenically,
[47:57.480 --> 48:05.480]  but it's got the classic Benedict Arnold in here of Glenn Beck saying,
[48:05.480 --> 48:10.480]  I don't know what the hell happened to Matt Drudge echoed back the prominent conservative talk show host
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.480]  who supports Hillary Clinton, I should add, and founder of the blaze.
[48:15.480 --> 48:19.480]  And then it goes on to have Cruz also attacking Drudge previously,
[48:19.480 --> 48:22.480]  but then not actually letting you hear what Drudge has to say.
[48:22.480 --> 48:25.480]  Drudge is going with the populist.
[48:25.480 --> 48:28.480]  Drudge is going with Americana. Drudge is going with the future.
[48:28.480 --> 48:32.480]  Drudge is, in fact, not just going, he's leading it
[48:32.480 --> 48:39.480]  because he is a populist, a nationalist, a true libertarian conservative, just like I am.
[48:39.480 --> 48:47.480]  And so he's helping lead the future, not a coward, not someone who's neutral or beyond neutral.
[48:47.480 --> 48:51.480]  There are things far worse than the neutral Rand Paul, someone neutral.
[48:51.480 --> 48:55.480]  No, no, we've got the Glenn Beck who's been going on the Sunday news shows
[48:55.480 --> 48:59.480]  with Democratic Party operatives and badmouthing.
[48:59.480 --> 49:05.480]  I'm going to play this clip and come back. Badmouthing Trump and saying he supports Hillary Clinton.
[49:05.480 --> 49:12.480]  And the host of it, former Democratic Party operative, said he was, quote, speechless, speechless
[49:12.480 --> 49:19.480]  while he was hearing this. And even the White House run media matters came out and said,
[49:19.480 --> 49:23.480]  he's trying to rebrand himself as mainstream and join us.
[49:23.480 --> 49:26.480]  And then they say, we don't want you, Glenn Beck.
[49:26.480 --> 49:30.480]  The White House run media matters.
[49:30.480 --> 49:35.480]  So you run to Zuckerberg and gravel at his feet and say his censorship of libertarians and conservatives is good
[49:35.480 --> 49:38.480]  and worth it and the things should be doing.
[49:38.480 --> 49:46.480]  You run to meet the press run by the former, what is it, White House chief who was taught, I forget.
[49:46.480 --> 49:49.480]  I mean, it's just, it's totally crazy town.
[49:49.480 --> 49:55.480]  You run to the enemy because you were always the enemy and I told everyone you were the enemy.
[49:55.480 --> 49:58.480]  But let me tell you what it means that Glenn Beck is doing this.
[49:58.480 --> 50:03.480]  I have been told this by the highest levels of folks under Roger Ailes.
[50:03.480 --> 50:05.480]  They've got a big fake scandal brewing.
[50:05.480 --> 50:11.480]  It's being run by the Rupert Murdoch kids with ancient fake sexual harassment garbage on Roger Ailes.
[50:11.480 --> 50:13.480]  By the way, Roger Ailes has never done anything.
[50:13.480 --> 50:20.480]  We're skip this network break. Roger Ailes has never done anything for me.
[50:20.480 --> 50:25.480]  I have been offered Fox shows and have refused them and cows on record.
[50:25.480 --> 50:27.480]  I've been offered contracts three different times.
[50:27.480 --> 50:29.480]  They can't believe I won't do weekend shows.
[50:29.480 --> 50:32.480]  So here's the deal.
[50:32.480 --> 50:41.480]  I'm not saying this about Roger Ailes because I want to get any type of entree into Fox.
[50:41.480 --> 50:43.480]  Fox is a sinking island.
[50:43.480 --> 50:49.480]  Fox is meant to be destroyed by the Rupert Murdoch children as soon as they get Ailes out of the way.
[50:49.480 --> 50:54.480]  And Rupert Murdoch is fading into the oblivion, okay?
[50:54.480 --> 51:00.480]  And they plan to bring down Ailes by the end of this year with a made up sexual harassment string of women,
[51:00.480 --> 51:02.480]  totally made up from our sources.
[51:02.480 --> 51:08.480]  Some of this stuff is 20 years old when he founded Fox News.
[51:08.480 --> 51:12.480]  And then they plan to basically turn it into a Democratic Party socialist channel.
[51:12.480 --> 51:13.480]  They know the demographics.
[51:13.480 --> 51:15.480]  Most of their viewers are dying.
[51:15.480 --> 51:20.480]  They know that there are other companies that are 95% of what they do,
[51:20.480 --> 51:24.480]  are in globalist media, anti-failin' media, anti-gun media.
[51:24.480 --> 51:30.480]  I mean, look at what Newscore and the Fox studios put out, globalist disinformation.
[51:30.480 --> 51:38.480]  They are preparing to turn Fox into a CNN light that they think will still keep the conservative audience that's left
[51:38.480 --> 51:41.480]  because where do they have to go?
[51:41.480 --> 51:47.480]  And that's why Glenn Beck, who is arch enemies with Roger Ailes, the two are obsessed with each other,
[51:47.480 --> 51:53.480]  is now going out and showing his wares on ABC and CBS and all the rest,
[51:53.480 --> 51:57.480]  sabotaging the libertarian move to block the globalist destruction of the Republic.
[51:57.480 --> 52:00.480]  Here at the final moment, he shows himself to be the Benedict Arnold.
[52:00.480 --> 52:05.480]  So this isn't about the loser, the fake, the actor Glenn Beck.
[52:05.480 --> 52:11.480]  This is about the fact that this is a larger move to take over talk radio, which they're already doing,
[52:11.480 --> 52:14.480]  and shutting down true patriot host.
[52:14.480 --> 52:17.480]  This is a larger move to kick them all off serious XM.
[52:17.480 --> 52:25.480]  It is a larger move, ladies and gentlemen, on every stinking front there is
[52:25.480 --> 52:27.480]  to shut down free speech in this country.
[52:27.480 --> 52:32.480]  And Matt Drudge came a year ago to the InfoWars studios,
[52:32.480 --> 52:38.480]  or I guess a little less than a year ago, and he came to the studios and he warned people,
[52:38.480 --> 52:41.480]  I met with the Supreme Court Justice, they're coming out for free speech next year,
[52:41.480 --> 52:43.480]  and you notice it's all here.
[52:43.480 --> 52:48.480]  And then Business Insider will let us hear what Ted Cruz had to say, what Glenn Beck had to say,
[52:48.480 --> 52:52.480]  what a bunch of other people had to say, but won't let you actually hear.
[52:52.480 --> 52:55.480]  I mean, they say he doesn't give interviews for every couple of years,
[52:55.480 --> 52:58.480]  and he gave an interview to this crazy person, Alex Jones,
[52:58.480 --> 53:00.480]  but they won't let you hear what he actually had to say.
[53:00.480 --> 53:03.480]  But here's what happened, I've been to a bunch of different dinners and things,
[53:03.480 --> 53:09.480]  and have been mobbed by even mainstream major newspaper writers.
[53:09.480 --> 53:14.480]  So the New York Times, weekly standard, the list goes on and on,
[53:14.480 --> 53:17.480]  and all they ask about is Matt Drudge, and how do you know Matt Drudge?
[53:17.480 --> 53:20.480]  I say, I'm just really not going to make any comments,
[53:20.480 --> 53:23.480]  but he listens to the show some and links to a lot of our stories,
[53:23.480 --> 53:26.480]  and as a trailblazer, and came to visit me, it was a surprise.
[53:26.480 --> 53:27.480]  He goes, is that really a surprise?
[53:27.480 --> 53:29.480]  I said, no, that was really a surprise.
[53:29.480 --> 53:31.480]  Oh, yeah, right, you staged that.
[53:31.480 --> 53:32.480]  No, it's not, you know.
[53:32.480 --> 53:37.480]  Oh, you just recanted to me that you're really a libertarian, and that's all fake.
[53:37.480 --> 53:39.480]  You know, just weird stuff like that.
[53:39.480 --> 53:45.480]  And folks were overall nice, but it's just crazy to see this,
[53:45.480 --> 53:49.480]  and then everybody wants this Drudge interview, but no one will actually link to it.
[53:49.480 --> 53:51.480]  But what's beautiful about what he's done is,
[53:51.480 --> 53:54.480]  whether it was the New York Times, or whether it was the weekly standard,
[53:54.480 --> 53:57.480]  or whether it was Politico, or whether it was the Washington Post,
[53:57.480 --> 54:01.480]  or whether it was all these different groups I talked to, I mean, I'm talking,
[54:01.480 --> 54:04.480]  I mean, it was so much my head was spinning.
[54:04.480 --> 54:09.480]  To a person, they all think the Matt Drudge interview happened last month,
[54:09.480 --> 54:13.480]  because it took that long to start going more and more viral,
[54:13.480 --> 54:15.480]  because nobody can get a Matt Drudge interview.
[54:15.480 --> 54:18.480]  So Matt is so smart, he goes and does this one interview,
[54:18.480 --> 54:21.480]  and then he wants to know what Matt Drudge thinks,
[54:21.480 --> 54:24.480]  and all they can go to is hear what he said a year ago.
[54:24.480 --> 54:27.480]  So no matter how much they try to ignore it, I see, I don't think like that.
[54:27.480 --> 54:28.480]  He really is smart.
[54:28.480 --> 54:33.480]  You're all smart in different ways, but you can see Matt Drudge has this long-term vision.
[54:33.480 --> 54:36.480]  And so this is not the Matt Drudge butt-kissing contest.
[54:36.480 --> 54:41.480]  It's just really great to see what the stuff he does kind of work his magic down the road,
[54:41.480 --> 54:43.480]  because my brain works different ways than that.
[54:43.480 --> 54:45.480]  You know, I've got my own smarts in different ways and things,
[54:45.480 --> 54:49.480]  kind of smarts with a pit bull attacking a zebra biting it on the nose,
[54:49.480 --> 54:55.480]  or a donkey, you know, Democrat analogy here, but it's crazy to see this,
[54:55.480 --> 54:59.480]  and it's crazy to see them try to block everything and try to restrict,
[54:59.480 --> 55:02.480]  and try to spin, and try to act like they control the narrative,
[55:02.480 --> 55:04.480]  and that, you know, the populist movement's a joke.
[55:04.480 --> 55:08.480]  When I talk to these reporters, they are scared, they are listening.
[55:08.480 --> 55:13.480]  I talked to John Ronson, who's a really smart guy and, you know, a big filmmaker as well,
[55:13.480 --> 55:17.480]  and I've known him for 16, no, actually 17 years, no, 18 years.
[55:17.480 --> 55:21.480]  I mean, three years before I went into Bohemian Grove, and no, two years.
[55:21.480 --> 55:23.480]  And he said, no, absolutely.
[55:23.480 --> 55:25.480]  He said, you know, he's a big guardian writer.
[55:25.480 --> 55:27.480]  He said, I'm not just telling you this.
[55:27.480 --> 55:29.480]  He said, you're a libertarian brand in Europe.
[55:29.480 --> 55:32.480]  It's the hottest thing, hottest thing, you know, here in the U.S.
[55:32.480 --> 55:35.480]  It looks like you and Drudge and Trump are about to become the establishment.
[55:35.480 --> 55:37.480]  And I said, no, we're not.
[55:37.480 --> 55:41.480]  We're about to try to turn the people loose and show the power of populism.
[55:41.480 --> 55:44.480]  We're only focal points of that, but it really is amazing.
[55:44.480 --> 55:47.480]  And so, yes, I would have to give Matt Drudge the credit.
[55:47.480 --> 55:50.480]  First, the American people and populists seeing through things.
[55:50.480 --> 55:57.480]  Then Matt Drudge and then myself, the credit for early on supporting Trump,
[55:57.480 --> 56:04.480]  when it became clear that he was a populist and it was going to be Hillary if we didn't do something.
[56:04.480 --> 56:11.480]  But speaking of that, we've got several different clips here that we're going to play as we go out to break.
[56:11.480 --> 56:16.480]  Let's play one, the first clip of Glenn Beck on Meet the Press,
[56:16.480 --> 56:18.480]  savaging Donald Trump.
[56:18.480 --> 56:20.480]  And remember, this means supporting Hillary Clinton.
[56:20.480 --> 56:22.480]  Here it is.
[56:22.480 --> 56:29.480]  Then you have Donald Trump, who the only advisors that he listens to are his children.
[56:29.480 --> 56:30.480]  What do you have?
[56:30.480 --> 56:31.480]  He's a corrupt businessman.
[56:31.480 --> 56:32.480]  She's corrupt.
[56:32.480 --> 56:35.480]  So both sides are now saying, what are you going to do?
[56:35.480 --> 56:38.480]  I think we feel all Americans, I shouldn't say all.
[56:38.480 --> 56:45.480]  I think Reince and a few others at both conventions are going to be fine just pulling the lever.
[56:45.480 --> 56:49.480]  But I think a lot of people are pulling it, not holding their nose,
[56:49.480 --> 56:54.480]  wincing in pain as they think about pulling that lever.
[56:54.480 --> 56:58.480]  So what you decide to do is your own business.
[56:58.480 --> 57:01.480]  But I have to tell you, there are choices.
[57:01.480 --> 57:04.480]  You can vote for the Green Party.
[57:04.480 --> 57:06.480]  You can vote for the Libertarian Party.
[57:06.480 --> 57:09.480]  And I know people will say, well, that's a vote for the other guy.
[57:09.480 --> 57:11.480]  But you know what?
[57:11.480 --> 57:14.480]  I can't sell my soul any more to these parties.
[57:14.480 --> 57:22.480]  So he can't sell his soul any more to these other parties.
[57:22.480 --> 57:26.480]  And he tries to spin it like voting for someone else isn't a vote for Hillary.
[57:26.480 --> 57:28.480]  Trying to manipulate people.
[57:28.480 --> 57:30.480]  I mean, I know folks that know Glenn Beck, OK?
[57:30.480 --> 57:32.480]  He scripts everything he says.
[57:32.480 --> 57:34.480]  He's the opposite of me.
[57:34.480 --> 57:38.480]  And I am so proud that he's the opposite of me.
[57:38.480 --> 57:41.480]  I am so proud that I am not.
[57:41.480 --> 57:44.480]  And listen, I have held my tongue on Glenn Beck for so long,
[57:44.480 --> 57:46.480]  but that guy has really sabotaged me.
[57:46.480 --> 57:48.480]  He's gotten in my business.
[57:48.480 --> 57:49.480]  And let me tell you something.
[57:49.480 --> 57:52.480]  I think good Lord above, I think my family.
[57:52.480 --> 57:58.480]  I think Matt Drudge and also folks like George Norrie that have helped get the info are over to the next level
[57:58.480 --> 58:02.480]  because they've helped me in my life because I'm not really a competitive guy.
[58:02.480 --> 58:04.480]  I'm not out to be the big guy.
[58:04.480 --> 58:06.480]  I'm not out to be the winner.
[58:06.480 --> 58:12.480]  But let me tell you, when somebody tries to ruin me and break me and shut me down and destroy me,
[58:12.480 --> 58:14.480]  I do savor it.
[58:14.480 --> 58:19.480]  I'll tell you, I absolutely savor and I enjoy any time I'm down or I'm tired.
[58:19.480 --> 58:23.480]  I can think about all the people in my life from the bullies when I was 10 years old,
[58:23.480 --> 58:27.480]  right through some of the people that fired me off radio because I was talking about Hillary and Bill,
[58:27.480 --> 58:30.480]  right through to people like Glenn Beck and everybody else.
[58:30.480 --> 58:34.480]  I'm not going to shut me down and I'm not backing down and neither are the American people.
[58:34.480 --> 58:37.480]  And neither is Donald Trump and neither is Matt Drudge.
[58:37.480 --> 58:40.480]  We're taking this country back. Stay with us.
[58:40.480 --> 58:44.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:44.480 --> 58:50.480]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:50.480 --> 59:00.480]  Thank you.
[59:20.480 --> 59:24.480]  You will find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[59:24.480 --> 59:29.480]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[59:29.480 --> 59:33.480]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[59:33.480 --> 59:35.480]  I went home about 6.45 this morning.
[59:35.480 --> 59:39.480]  I took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[59:39.480 --> 59:45.480]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com
[59:45.480 --> 59:52.480]  Call 888-253-3139.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:27.480]  It is crazy to be here in Cleveland.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.480]  It is amazing. I have had probably half the police we walk by say,
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.480]  Alex Jones, Alex Jones, give me thumbs up.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.480]  I have had maybe 20% of the Secret Service.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.480]  Wave at me or give me thumbs up.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.480]  It is crazy. It is crazy.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.480]  Again, that has got to freak the criminals, the globalists now,
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:53.480]  that Obama and Soros' attempt to start a civil war to intimidate the police
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.480]  and giving in to the globalists has absolutely backfired our news director
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.480]  who has been working his butt off at a level I have never seen.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:02.480]  He is such a hard worker. Rob Dew is here with us.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.480]  We have Wayne Madsen from Inside the RNC where they are trying to steal it again tomorrow night.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.480]  I am going to be going inside the night and tomorrow right through when Trump gets the nomination.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.480]  We are talking about those dirty tricks in the next segment.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:16.480]  But I tell you, have you ever seen so many listeners,
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.480]  not just delegates that have come here or Republicans,
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.480]  the locals, especially the black folks.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.480]  It is so crazy that black folks love me so much.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:30.480]  It is not about us, but it is a benchmark.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.480]  The media can spin the idea that it is us against them.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.480]  Alex, just a quick story.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.480]  I was shooting from the tripod position way in the back for your speech yesterday
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.480]  and when I was packing stuff up, listeners of all types came.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.480]  Wouldn't you say about as far as people were blacked up?
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.480]  Oh, yeah, yeah. And the black folks were coming up to me going, they knew who I was.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.480]  They were like, Rob Dew, thank you, thank you.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.480]  And they wanted to take pictures with me.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.480]  I have never had that happen before with so many people in just one location
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.480]  and they were all, some of them had shirts on, some of them didn't,
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.480]  but they were all like, oh, thank you for what you did.
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.480]  But it wasn't just the rally. It is very humbling to have folks looking at you
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.480]  like you are going to save them.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.480]  Look, I am just like you. I am fighting tyranny. You are just as powerful as I am.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.480]  People stop me in the streets. They know who I am.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.480]  I met a guy last night, a California delegate at midnight walking down the road.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.480]  He goes, hey, you're with Info Wars.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.480]  I said, yeah, hey, what happened today?
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.480]  Give me your take on what happened today. He started talking. He's like, yeah.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.480]  That's right. It's not about us. We're only telling you because you aren't known.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.480]  You're not a public figure, most of you.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.480]  You don't get to understand how big the Liberty Movement is.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.480]  Yeah, it is.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.480]  I mean, I could barely walk down the street anywhere.
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.480]  No, you get mobbed. It's on another level with you.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.480]  I want to go out and just show that. I want to show people that
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.480]  because we are the future.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.480]  And this whole mainstream media is about making us feel like we're alone.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.480]  They have these articles every day chastising Drudge
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:46.480]  for being associated with Trump and myself as he rises and they fall.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.480]  And then Drudge links to it because he knows it's a joke.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.480]  Yeah.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.480]  I mean, these people just don't get it, man.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.480]  I said, we really are turning the tide.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.480]  We definitely are.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.480]  We have a long way to go, but we're turning it.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.480]  It is. And with the banner flights, that breaking through the mainstream media,
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.480]  we got the trucks going. I mean, it's all really happening.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.480]  That was in hundreds of, I mean, a publication.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.480]  Everybody was talking about it. It was the only,
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.480]  because there was nothing else going on for two days.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.480]  It was just people standing around going, ooh, you know,
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.480]  oh my God, there's a band, people are flying banners around.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.480]  I see people ask, that'll scare the globalists if info wars and Drudge,
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.480]  just websites with tiny crews compared to the mainstream media can kick their butt.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.480]  It's because you're pushing BS.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.480]  Well, and it's because we're not caught up in this giant hierarchy either.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.480]  It's like, hey, we want to go do this. Boom, we do it.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.480]  We want to go do this. Boom, we do it.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.480]  There's no like, we just go where the action is.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.480]  And that's the difference, I think, with a lot of these mainstream media.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480]  They're stuck in there.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.480]  Can you believe that they kept Ted Nugent for speaking here?
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.480]  That's ridiculous.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.480]  Ted, you know, and they had the Duck Dynasty guy on last night.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.480]  How is he any different from Ted Nugent?
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.480]  They had Scott Beyo, Chachi.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.480]  I mean, they're getting all these celebrities.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.480]  What's wrong with Ted Nugent?
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.480]  He's, you know, because he's too good.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.480]  Yeah.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.480]  And again, that's not Trump's fault.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.480]  It's not Trump's people. It's the RNC.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.480]  Of course.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.480]  That's all, anytime we run into, and it's funny,
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.480]  when you meet an info wars person who's a delegate,
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.480]  they have a different mindset than one of these RNC people
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.480]  who are just oblivious to like, what's going on in the world?
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.480]  Well, I mean, I flew up here with a bunch of delegates that were with Carl Rove,
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.480]  and he had him bringing them on the plane.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.480]  They were like, literally bugging their eyes.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.480]  Calling by his real name.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.480]  Calling by his real name.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.480]  Third blossom.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.480]  Yeah.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.480]  I mean, they were really, and that's why I said, that's it.
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.480]  I'm getting off the plane.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.480]  I'm really confronting now.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.480]  You know, the gloves are off, man.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.480]  That face when he turns and looks at you,
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.480]  it's like this, this Dan Ackroy movie.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.480]  I think it's called Nothing but Trouble.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.480]  He looked exactly like that guy from Central Casting,
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.480]  just big and pustule and just had no soul in it.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.480]  He had no soul in his eyes.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.480]  He looked like he was wearing, it was somebody else inside.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:36.480]  Well, this is the guy that sabotages the Republican Party.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480]  Yeah.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.480]  And, and he's done.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.480]  Oh yeah.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.480]  He's, he's a footnote at this point.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.480]  All right.
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.480]  I'm going to come back.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.480]  I want you to ride shotgun with me a little bit because we've got Wayne Madsen
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.480]  and the rest of the crew inside.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.480]  We give people a video shot of their TV viewers.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.480]  infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480]  I skipped a break last hour.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.480]  I didn't plug last hour.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.480]  When you folks go to infowarsstore.com and, and, and the videos,
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.480]  the books, the musicals, that's how we fund this.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.480]  Council member.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.480]  French citizens are getting ready for war.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:08.480]  Gun club memberships quadruple after terror attacks as mood turns nasty.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:13.480]  French citizens are voting for right wing politicians like Marie Le Pen,
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.480]  who have offered anything different to President Francois Hollande's
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:22.480]  feeble response to Charlie Hebdo, the Paris massacre or the Nice atrocity.
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:29.480]  French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said that France must learn to live with terror attacks.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.480]  Patrick Culver, who is the head of the director general of internal security,
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.480]  told members of a French parliamentary commission,
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.480]  we are on the brink of a civil war.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:43.480]  French security forces are also preparing for mass civil unrest
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:47.480]  and radicalized immigrants taking over entire neighborhoods.

[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.480]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator,
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.480]  but we're waiting for an outrageously low price,
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.480]  you are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why.
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.480]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:17.480]  So please listen, solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.480]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently,
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.480]  emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:28.480]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.480]  you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.480]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:38.480]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:42.480]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:45.480]  in addition to the low price for infowars listeners.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.480]  So it's a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.480]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.480]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:08:16.480]  Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:32.480]  And here we are above the RNC, above the conference center where they are meeting.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:35.480]  And I've got Rob do our news director sitting right beside me.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.480]  A lot of amazing things going on.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:41.480]  I do intend at the bottom of the hour to open the phones up for everybody.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:48.480]  There is a key report up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com from Wayne Madsen.
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:52.480]  And I've asked Paul Watson to actually write an article about this.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.480]  It's really a big deal.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.480]  Now, this isn't about tooting my horn, but I want folks to realize I know what I'm talking about.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.480]  When the Republicans a few months ago said, okay, we're not going to challenge Trump anymore for the nomination,
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:10.480]  I said, guaranteed, I know Glenback and I know the other carpet bagger that's down in Texas.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.480]  I mean, I'm nothing against northerners to come south.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.480]  I love folks, but a carpet bagger comes down here to take advantage of Texans,
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:21.480]  take advantage of our looks, our cowboy hats, our culture, people thinking that you can quote trust a Texan.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.480]  You can find a real one.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:25.480]  Yeah, you can handshake deal because your bracket will come after you.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.480]  But we're talking about Ted Cruz, you know, the Canadian.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:36.480]  Sure enough, they tried to overthrow the votes, force it down, take the votes and try to install Ted Cruz.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.480]  That failed yesterday.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:41.480]  Now, the word is, and Wayne Madsen investigative journalist,
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.480]  former head of a major security division of the National Security Agency,
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:53.480]  first major NSA whistleblower 20 years ago, he was on the ground with Kit Daniels and our crew.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:58.480]  And he's there right now with Josh Owens inside the Quicken Loans Center.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:04.480]  And he discovered they're planning Wednesday night after Ted Cruz speaks to try to walk out.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:11.480]  Donald Trump doesn't need to send his people into talk to the Cruz former delegates and say, please don't do this.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.480]  Follow your pledge and follow the popular vote.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:21.480]  He's tell Ted Cruz, we're just going to take you off the speaking slot, you bastard, because I've had enough of this.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.480]  Okay.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.480]  And it makes me sick that I ever halfway supported Ted Cruz enough dirty tricks.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.480]  I mean, Glenn Beck is on Meet the Press and other shows saying vote for Hillary.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.480]  I cannot handle this anymore.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:40.480]  Listen, the bad Donald Trump, if you believe the worst stuff about him, he's 50 times better than Hillary.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.480]  The guy's got courage.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.480]  He's got honor.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.480]  He loves America.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.480]  He wants to have better trade deals.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.480]  He's pro-second amendment.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.480]  He's pro-family.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.480]  And then he's even liberal on some subjects that I'm somewhat liberal on.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.480]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.480]  Leave people alone in their bedrooms.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.480]  He's a great candidate.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.480]  And he's a unifier.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.480]  He's from the north, you know, where America started.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:03.480]  And it's just exciting to see him bringing America together as a great unifier.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:07.480]  If they let him in, he'll be the new Ronald Reagan, and I think more so.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.480]  And I'm so excited about it.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:13.480]  Listen, Wayne Madsen is somebody I'd call a famous journalist.
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:17.480]  I would call him kind of a classical liberal, libertarian liberal.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.480]  He's been supporting Trump.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:23.480]  I don't think of a time I've seen him support a Republican.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.480]  He's kind of not really supported Democrats either, but I don't want to speak for him.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:30.480]  But before we get into what happened last night, it was coming up tomorrow night that we're breaking here.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:35.480]  Wayne Madsen inside the convention center for TV viewers, M4Wars.com, forward slash show.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:40.480]  Radio listeners can go find the feed right there, but this will also be archived later today.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.480]  Let's first talk about you, transformative Lee.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.480]  Am I speaking for you or do you support Trump?
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.480]  And then why are you supporting him?
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.480]  And then what happened last night?
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.480]  What's happening tomorrow?
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:12:03.480]  Well, Alex, what has happened here so far is yesterday there was an attempt to have the rules altered to go for a full roll call vote and that failed.
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:14.480]  That was being pushed primarily by Senator Mike Lee, a Cruz delegate from Utah and the former attorney general of Virginia, Ken Cusinelli.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:25.480]  As I said, that failed because the chair, Rince Priebus said, you have to have a certain number of states and a certain number of signatures to go for a full roll call vote.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:29.480]  The Cruz people said, no, they cried foul.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:39.480]  They said, look, this is a ruling that, you know, they used the word bugs describing the RNC.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.480]  They weren't happy.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:56.480]  Now, last night, what I discovered was from a senior delegate from Tennessee who's a Trump delegate said, look, there's a rumor that the Cruz people will stage a walkout after Ted Cruz's speech tomorrow evening.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:00.480]  We spoke to the Texas Cruz people.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:09.480]  They said, look, we're hoping to vote for our person Cruz, but then when Trump gets the nomination, we will support Trump.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:17.480]  Now, what's going to happen tonight after the gavel goes down is we're going to have the nomination process for president and then for vice president.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:24.480]  But they're going to start the roll call with Alabama and it goes in alphabetical order.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:38.480]  And at some point in time, and this is a very unconventional convention, but usually the presidential candidate's home state moves for nomination by acclimation.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.480]  So they don't go through the entire roll call.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.480]  This is what the Cruz people wanted.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:49.480]  They wanted the chance for Texas, which is at the end of the alphabet to be able to vote along with Utah.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.480]  Excuse me.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:14:06.480]  So I would say that at some point in time during the roll call, my suspicion is that New York, which is Trump's home state, their delegation chair will move for acclimation.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:09.480]  So it won't go to further states.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.480]  Now, Wayne, let me throw this in at you.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.480]  I got something to add to that.
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:14.480]  Absolutely.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.480]  Again, Rob, to hear with us in force is director.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.480]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:25.480]  Clearly, this is about just sabotaging Trump, making it look like he's not even supported by his own party to damage him and support Hillary.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:31.480]  I mean, I cannot believe these Republicans after their attempt to claim that they were super delegates and that votes didn't count.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.480]  They were repudiated.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.480]  They had to back off.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.480]  This is very traitorous, very treacherous, very dishonorable.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:41.480]  Do these people have any idea how dirty this is?
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:47.480]  A, and then B, you know, clearly this is going to blow up in their face and it's not going to succeed.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.480]  And then how are they going to feel when Hillary gets elected?
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:56.480]  Well, I mean, I don't think many of the people here would vote for Hillary Clinton.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:58.480]  This is a fairly...
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.480]  Then why are they trying to sabotage Trump?
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.480]  Because, I mean, nobody else is going to get it.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.480]  Right.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.480]  They've tried to do that.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.480]  But I think when it comes down to November, we're talking about a Republican.
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.480]  At least the ones represented here are Republicans.
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:21.480]  I don't think many will sit at home and want to sacrifice their vote if they think that Hillary Clinton could be elected president.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.480]  There may be some, certainly.
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:31.480]  We don't even have the governor of Ohio here and they spent $54 million to get this convention in Cleveland.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:35.480]  And they're not going to make that back by hot dog sales from the concourse here.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:42.480]  You don't have K-Secure, he's in Cleveland, but he's attending side meetings.
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.480]  And that's another reason I'm supporting Trump.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:50.480]  You have all the old, disgusting rhinos, the bushes, the old establishment, just like the Clintons fighting with everything they've got.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.480]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.480]  Let me ask you this.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.480]  I know you don't want to get into your own personal views, but I've seen you on air.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.480]  I mean, you've...
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.480]  What is your real view of Trump?
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.480]  I mean, you're here obviously exposing the fact you're trying to take him out.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.480]  What is your view of this general election?
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.480]  What's your view of Trump?
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:09.480]  Well, I think what we see with Trump and on the other side, Bernie Sanders, is there is anger across the country.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.480]  Nobody will deny that fact.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:18.480]  And you can sense the anger here amongst a lot of the delegates I've spoken to them.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:24.480]  They don't like the way the country has gone for the last eight years under Barack Obama.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.480]  And they look at Hillary as just the continuation of the Obama administration.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.480]  Some actually believe she might be worse.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:35.480]  So I think what we're seeing is the anger playing out.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:44.480]  And I think we're going to see the same attempt in Philadelphia by Sanders people to do exactly what the Cruz people did here to try to say,
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:50.480]  even though Trump, of course, was not the favorite of the Republican establishment.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.480]  So this is...
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:59.480]  As I've written, anyone who has the old political rulebook from the last century needs to throw it away.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.480]  It doesn't work anymore.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.480]  That's right. This is a major political realignment.
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:09.480]  Wayne, is this one of the biggest realignments in your historical research that we've seen since the founding of the Republic?
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:19.480]  Well, Alex, I've actually never seen a convention like this where you've got the only previous GOP nominee for President Bob Dole was here.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:25.480]  All the others are boycotting John McCain, Mitt Romney, none of the Bushes are here.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:31.480]  But as you know, from your flight here, the Bushes have their surrogate here working behind the scenes.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.480]  And that's Carl Rove.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:50.480]  And I talked to a former Republican congressman last night from Ohio, and it was his feeling that Rove is here to basically be the Bush henchman here to see what he can possibly do to disrupt the convention for Trump.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.480]  So there's a good chance that Rove is behind some of this attempt to embarrass Trump.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:03.480]  He may be. The issue with... You've got rumors that Mitt Romney's in town too, although nobody's seen him.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:08.480]  We know K-6 here. As you know, Rove is here. So yeah, there is some...
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.480]  Well, that's extremely shameful. That's extremely shameful. I want to come back to you over the break, but real quick, Rob, do you have a question or a point?
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:26.480]  Well, I just want to confirm what Wayne Madsen was just saying. The delegate I talked to from California last night said it was all cruise states and Marco Rubio people getting together in one side of the convention floor.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:36.480]  They were all colluding, and he was witnessing this happening. And when they called for that roll call, he actually stood up and said something to the chair at that point saying, no, we should not allow this.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:46.480]  Look, at this point, those are Hillary operatives in the convention trying to spoil the will of popular voters. This is election fraud that we're watching here, okay?
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:53.480]  And that video is up. You can watch this whole... The old interview, it's on the Alex Jones channel. It's called California Delegate Exposes How Never Trump is Gonna Fail.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:59.480]  Because he basically said, Trump's got it in the bag. They will not be able to steal it from... But we'll see. We still have to maintain vigilance at this point.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:07.480]  Well, they're bare minimum trying to embarrass him, aren't they, Wayne? I'm sorry? They're bare minimum trying to embarrass Trump.
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:16.480]  Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, the issue with this convention so far has been we haven't even seen a schedule with timed events.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:27.480]  We first saw the first schedule with any times given what came out yesterday. But unlike many other conventions where you got people slotted in certain times, we haven't seen that.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:34.480]  So there's a lot of play going on at this convention. And we see a lot of to be determined speakers still on the list.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:40.480]  That's right. Unprecedented. Let's talk about the other intel you've gleaned the last few days inside the convention center.
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:45.480]  We're day two. We're right above the convention center broadcasting live. Wayne Madsen and our crew is inside.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:52.480]  We've got crew on the streets out there talking to the BLM groups and other sorrows funded trash. It's all coming up straight ahead.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:59.480]  And we've got a religion of peace, jihadi killing people with an axe in Germany. And we're hearing now it's the Germans fall. Stay with us.
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:09.480]  Men, if you're like me, you appreciate the feeling of a clean, smooth shave from a quality blade, the sort of shave that cuts clean without the burn.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:19.480]  So why are you messing around with generic razors that cost 32 bucks for an eight pack when you can shave with Harry's high quality German engineered blades for half the price?
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:28.480]  And because Harry's is so confident in the quality of their blades, they'll send you their most popular set, complete with a razor, one of their world famous blades,

[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:24.480]  Welcome to your lives. There's no turning back. We've got the Republican establishment, the Bush's, Glenn Beck, Ted Cruz trying to sabotage the people's popular vote. Stop Donald Trump. I mean, my God, that's incredible.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:35.480]  And we've got the people really waking up. But coming up, I got a short interview with the Dexter Suzer, the Lee Ann McAdoo dead last night. And then we've also got the Suzer coming on tomorrow. We've got Ted Nugent and a lot more.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:46.480]  And we're going to be talking to Lee Ann McAdoo and Margaret Howell out on the street that are interviewing folks. Joe Biggs is also going to the convention center. I'm going to be in there later tonight and of course tomorrow when they attempt this big walk out.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:59.480]  And I also saw two guys wearing new Black Panther Party shirts. They saw me looking out the window. I stopped at a red light, jumped out and actually ran the building away from me. I just want to go talk to them and say, Hey, you know, George Soros is fun and all this.
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:11.480]  Try to cause a war in this country. It's not going to help anybody. So I'm going to go out and talk to some of those folks. I'm able to. We are on the lookout. We are on the hunt. As they say, Rob is here with news director.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:22.480]  He's going to be in Philadelphia with a David nine and others. But right now let's go back to Wayne Madsen on the floor. What else have you gleaned Wayne and what else are you looking to happen? What's the next shoot a drop?
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:42.480]  Well, tonight we'll actually see the Republican establishment on stage scheduled to speak as the ex officio chairman of the convention speaker of the house, Paul Ryan. And also speaking will be the Senate majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:26:00.480]  So it'll be very interesting because neither one of them have given what I would call full throated endorsements of Donald Trump. So it'll be very interesting to see what they have to say tonight when they are up there on this podium behind me.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:23.480]  We also have some members of the Trump family, Donald Trump Jr. scheduled to speak. And there'll be some other Republican politicians on stage. But unlike past conventions, Republican conventions, in this case, we don't see a lot of the big office holders.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:36.480]  There is a few here. Scott Walker is scheduled to speak here. The governor was constant. Isn't that for you an endorsement of Trump? I mean, I know you've kind of dodged this twice. I'm not mad that you have but just as a private citizen.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.480]  I mean, what is your view of Trump?
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:54.480]  Well, I think he's on many issues. He's the anti neocon for one thing on foreign policy. He's their worst nightmare. He wants to patch up our relations with Russia, which the neocons are dead set against.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:27:10.480]  He's against these trade agreements. He thinks that we should have left Saddam Hussein in power in Iraq and thinks it's awful that we're trying to overthrow Assad in Syria because he sees them as stabilizing influences.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:26.480]  So I see a lot of people who have voted Democratic in the past taking a close look at Donald Trump because foreign policy issues, trade issues, bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States.
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:42.480]  And you can just walk a few blocks from this convention center and you see empty factories. Cleveland was once a huge manufacturing city and that's all been lost. Although I got to admit they've done a pretty good job at refurbishing the center city here.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:49.480]  Yeah, they made the downtown look better. But you go outside of here. It looks like a war zone. But a lot of great people here and we can rebuild this country.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:58.480]  Well, what do you think happens if he does lose? How do they put this political dead duck Hillary in power? If she doesn't go for full dictatorial powers, she's going to be removed pretty quickly.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:13.480]  Well, I believe what we're seeing with Kasek in town and the rumor presence of Mitt Romney and people like Rove. I think they're looking at 2020. They want to try to get this party back under their control.
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:28.480]  They're going through. Remember, after the last election, they did this post mortem, this autopsy on the Republican Party. And then their worst nightmare occurred because they lost total control over the party with the nomination of an outsider.
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:40.480]  They're going to try for 2020 to get it back under the control of the insiders. And I think that's what they're meeting probably in one of these hotel suites downtown planning really for 2020.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:47.480]  I believe that these Republicans are already conceding the November election to Hillary Clinton.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:54.480]  Well, and then working with with with back and everybody else to make sure that happens as well opposition for the Democrats inside.
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:01.480]  And so that lets us know if Trump gets elected, the battle just begins as well as the Democrats and Republican establishment trying to sabotage him at every turn.
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:05.480]  So we can't just get him an office and leave him there. We've got to support him.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:21.480]  That's right. I mean, it's I think the one thing with the schedule being so fluid, normally those schedules are hammered out way in advance because people are traveling and whatnot.
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:24.480]  So what does that mean to you? What does that mean to you? What does that signify?
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:32.480]  It means that this is really this is the most unorganized convention that I've covered and I've seen in recent times.
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:38.480]  Maybe in a way that's good. Yeah, I mean, in a way that's that's how the first ones were and that's what freedom looks like.
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:43.480]  It's not just some top down centralized system. I know you're filing more reports doing a great job.
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:48.480]  So Wayne Madsen, Wayne Madsen report dot com works with info wars dot com. Thanks for being a correspondent for us.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.480]  We'll be back with our folks on the streets. Stay with us.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:59.480]  The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:04.480]  Council member French citizens are getting ready for war.
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:09.480]  Gun club memberships quadruple after terror attacks as mood turns nasty.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:22.480]  French citizens are voting for right wing politicians like Marie Le Pen, who have offered anything different to President Francois Hollande's feeble response to Charlie Hebdo, the Paris massacre or the knee.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:29.480]  French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said that France must learn to live with terror attacks.
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:39.480]  Patrick Culver, who is the head of the director general of internal security, told members of a French Parliamentary Commission, we are on the brink of a civil war.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:47.480]  French security forces are also preparing for mass civil unrest and radicalized immigrants taking over entire neighborhoods.
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:56.480]  Article by Paul Joseph Watson on info wars dot com. I'm Ashley Beckford. Stay tuned for more special reports.

[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:48.480]  But it cost us $75 to $80 a bottle just to package it. Just to put the bio PQQ in it, which is equivalent of 300 pounds of blueberries.

[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:40.480]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm we're here.
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:49.480]  And returning weeknight at 7 o'clock central info wars nightly news. And then of course Sunday's 4 to 6pm central of the live Sunday broadcast. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:59.480]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Cleveland, Ohio, site of the 2016 Republican National Convention back at the home base in Austin, Texas.
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:06.480]  We have David Knight and the rest of the great crew making this all possible, but I've got 9 or 10 people here in our crew.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:13.480]  I guess more than that actually about 11. And so we've got a full court press here with our operation. We've been dominating coverage.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:24.480]  Hundreds of newspapers, hundreds of TV stations all over national news, promoting liberty, warning people about globalism, showing that if somebody just gives the new order a stand up fight, we kick their butts.
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:30.480]  Very, very exciting time to be alive right now.
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:41.480]  Looking at this, it really shows that you can only have a globalist takeover, a multinational corporate takeover of your country when the people aren't aware of what's happening.
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:46.480]  That's why you've got to control the media. And the globalist mainstream media was arrogant when the internet first came into being.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:52.480]  They thought it would be a tool of surveillance, a tool of control. They thought that they could basically dominate it, but it's shown the genies out of the bottle.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:35:02.480]  Now they fit the panic button. They admit, we're going to have Joe Biggs on a little ball with us. They admit that they're having major, major problems and that everything's unraveling.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:10.480]  So now they want censorship. Now they want control. Now they want to be able to just basically shut us down.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:17.480]  It doesn't work to call us racists and all this garbage. And that's why it's more important than ever.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:22.480]  I haven't even plugged yet any of the products or things that found this operation.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:28.480]  First off, I want to thank you for being supporters. I want to let you know that we give you the very best products, the very lowest prices we possibly can.
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:37.480]  And I want to encourage you from the bottom of my heart to continue to spread the word. It's really having a big effect. History's happening.
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:50.480]  And to take advantage of the nutraceuticals, whether it be lung cleanse or brain force or DNA force or supermail vitality or child ease or any of these amazing products, check them out.
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:57.480]  They've changed my life. Just our sleep formula is an example of our philosophy. It's nine different ingredients.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:04.480]  Just this dose of melatonin on average is $15 and $19 a bottle of the same dose, same quality.
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:11.480]  Ours is $19.95. It has the same regular dose of melatonin. Then it has L tryptophan. Then it has valerian root, chamomile.
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:19.480]  It goes on and on. To get this, it'd be $50 at a discount store for all these different compounds in one big pill.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:24.480]  Safe, healthy, relaxing sleep. It's amazing.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:38.480]  M4warslife.com, $19.95. We're running 25% off on DNA force. That will end today because it's going to sell out. And so that will end by tomorrow because I have to hold back some bottles for folks that sign up for autoship.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.480]  They get 10% off. So we always have to hold some back for folks that are already signed up for autoship or those that may.
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:52.480]  It'll be about a month to get more DNA force in. It's 25% off. It's the top nutraceutical out there, proven to have growth, nerve growth factor.
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:58.480]  I mean, just stuff, telomeres, you name it. DNA force is amazing. Take advantage of that. I want to take you all for your support.
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:04.480]  Hillary for prison shirts are $19.95. We've been selling them as low as $5 because I want to get tens of thousands of them out there.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:09.480]  There's like 80,000 of them now out there or something. They're all over the country. It's one of the top memes in the nation.
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:17.480]  But at $19.95, we can take all the proceeds and pay for aircraft in the skies. You've seen that be national news. You've seen that be the top meme in the country. It's amazing.
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:25.480]  We're leading the way on how to resist. We're ragtag. We're cross-eyed and exhausted at the time, but we've got the passion. We're going over the top.
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:36.480]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site. Infowarslife.com is the nutraceuticals. You can also call toll free in order or ask any questions or ask about different discounts.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:44.480]  There's a lot of other ones I don't have time to mention. 888-253-3139. 888-253-3139.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:53.480]  We're also going to be going out to the Black Panther meetings and more. I'm going to be there. Others are. We're not playing games. We're going to go expose what George Soros is financing and is running.
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:38:01.480]  And if a clan rally pops up, we're going to go cover that as well, though I haven't heard of one of those. The birds of a feather, federal minions, tend to fly together.
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:09.480]  Joe Biggs was about to go into the convention center. We saw him down there and I said, I know he's got something to cover, but I'm going to go to some of the protest here in a little while.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:18.480]  I thought Biggs might want to be with us, but he can choose what he wants to do. We're going to Lee Ann, McAdoo, and of course our other great addition reporter.
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:25.480]  And that's of course Margaret Howell. But first, Joe, what have you seen today so far and what's going on inside the convention center?
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:35.480]  I mean, as you can see, the police have pretty much built this entire wall around the center and kept a lot of people back. There's smaller pockets of protests happening, but I think today is going to be one of the largest ones.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:45.480]  Cornell West is going to be speaking at 4pm with Carl Dix, the co-founder of the Revolutionary Communist Party, along with the Huey P. Newton Gun Club and the new Black Panther Party.
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:48.480]  That's at four o'clock at the public square down here.
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:55.480]  And we're going. We need all the patriots. We're peaceful. We're just coming to cover it. We're coming to talk to them in an interview and hopefully talk some sense into them.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:05.480]  It's going to be interesting to see this large amount of people, these different diverse groups coming together right here with the amount of police. The nerves are high, the intensity.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:11.480]  You know, the helicopters are flying everywhere. I just spoke with one of our guys down on the ground that works closely with the Cleveland Police Department.
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:16.480]  He's working on trying to get me in one of these police choppers to fly around and get some aerial footage as well today.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:23.480]  So it's going to be interesting to see how everything pans out. But I guarantee you by Thursday, Thursday is going to be that day where it really gets hot and heavy.
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:30.480]  People are going to be angry. They've been out in the sun every day. Whatever we find out happens at the end of this week with the RNC Convention and all that.
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:33.480]  I think Thursday is going to be our big day.
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.480]  What did you expect coming in and what have you experienced since you've been here?
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:50.480]  I expected just complete and total chaos. But once you get here and actually see how they've barricaded this place in and really done a good job at keeping these people out and not letting them get close to the area
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:55.480]  and not to bother the delegates trying to go in and out and not really screwing around with people, Cleveland didn't play any games.
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:59.480]  I mean, they brought in police from all over the country and it's definitely helping out.
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:06.480]  But it's definitely, it's sad to see when you have the head of the police department here also calling for a temporary ban on our Second Amendment rights.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.480]  That's something I do have a problem with.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:11.480]  That's right. But he also said Obama's basically financing and running Black Lives Matter and did all this.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.480]  Look, here's the issue. They bring with you holidays in the attack. We lose our liberties.
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:24.480]  They got all these communist groups, White House funded. We lose our liberties. No, if we just stand for these unconstitutional groups calling for criminal action, then we'll have it up with society again.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:29.480]  That's what the globalists have brought all this crime in is because they want to use it to turn us into this.
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:36.480]  I can't believe that so many Americans are upset over this Melania Trump speech and not as angry about this.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.480]  By the way, I went and looked at it. Everybody says my family's roots and my values. Everybody says that.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:47.480]  Yeah, it's a typical, you know, wife's speech. I mean, it's borderline. Is she running for president? No.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:54.480]  Well, of course, Obama's been caught plagiarizing whole cloth. But that's okay. Look, look, it's all about a diversion. I agree with you.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.480]  Stay here a little while or do you have a meeting we're going to?
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:57.480]  No, no, no. I'm good.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:04.480]  All right. Well, we're going to go to now our crew. Joe Bex is with us. We've got Leanne, Macadoo, and Margaret Howell down on the ground.
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:08.480]  Guys, what have you observed? And where do you see all this going?
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:14.480]  That's right, Alex. We are right here across from the Quicken Loans and here in front of the main media staging area.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:23.480]  This is the mass distraction epicenter. This is where they're running interference for the globalist, letting you know that the only thing that you need to care about was Melania's speech
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:33.480]  and that it was allegedly plagiarized because she used very common words that everyone speaks about, family, you know, building your own wealth, working hard, you know,
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:38.480]  the Obamas own that type of speech, apparently. They own the American dream as they try to kill it.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:47.480]  Absolutely. And of course, let's not forget, Obama was accused of plagiarism in 2008. They were accused of taking portions of Hillary Clinton's speeches
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:54.480]  and she accused him. He said that was ludicrous. How could, you know, this is a boulder dash. I've written two books. No, he didn't.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:59.480]  Who wrote your books, Obama? So it's just total distraction. Exactly.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:04.480]  You know, Saul Alinsky pulled some big quotes out of that book. So it's just mass distraction here.
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:12.480]  And all of these people here are like true patriots, kind of fighting back against the mass distraction.
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:19.480]  We've seen so many people out here getting in people's faces, not being afraid of standing up and speaking out saying why they're voting for Trump.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:26.480]  This guy here is doing a great impression of him. And so I'm going to step away because he's quite distracting.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:29.480]  I was about to say, is somebody doing a distraction to me?
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:32.480]  I'm going to drop kick him in a second.
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:37.480]  Here, let's see. Let's let this distractor get in here. Let's, let's see what this gumbo's doing.
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:42.480]  We have to understand that. At first, we have to come. We have to acknowledge that we have to identify that.
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:50.480]  And ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone is going to be my guest any second now. So stay tuned and join us here at the Republican National Convention.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:56.480]  Because we are going to take our party.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.480]  Pretty good.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:00.480]  By the way, every time they do this,
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:08.480]  1776 is going to commence again if you do another Alex Jones impression.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:11.480]  Nothing in there.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.480]  Believe me, it's not making me feel real good.
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:15.480]  They're shooting something as well. So they've got.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:20.480]  He's had his 10 seconds of fame. We've been trolled or whatever. I think it's funny.
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:23.480]  Yeah, he's good. He's good.
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:27.480]  I know we had a Millie Weaver kind of running around doing some reports for us.
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:34.480]  She's already reported the fact that there has been an altercation between a biker for Trump and an anarchist at one of these parks.
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:36.480]  She's running over here to get us that footage.
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:38.480]  So we're already seeing kind of the tensions are high.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:42.480]  And Joe Biggs kind of brought this up the way that they have everything set up.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:45.480]  The protesters are pretty far away from everything.
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:48.480]  And they're not facing any opposition.
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:50.480]  So there's no opposing voices really.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:52.480]  It's not like as if they're clashing against each other.
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:57.480]  So really it is you have to show up to these events and challenge them on their ideas.
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:01.480]  I got into a discussion with a young man who was for socialism.
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:04.480]  And then he said ultimately communism.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.480]  That's the big dream.
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:09.480]  And he sat there and tried to tell me that communism didn't kill millions of people.
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:12.480]  And that it's just a wonderful thing and that capitalism is terrible.
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.480]  Yeah, just look at Venezuela.
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.480]  I mean, you know.
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:19.480]  No, whenever you bring that up, they're like, oh, but that's not what we're going to.
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:20.480]  That's not what we're going to do.
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:21.480]  That's what we're going to do.
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:23.480]  We put you in a forced labor camp and oversee you.
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:25.480]  We'll be bosses then.
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:27.480]  I tell you, communism is such a job.
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:31.480]  We got corporate fascism now using socialism to domesticate us.
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:33.480]  Leanne, what did you expect going into this?
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:35.480]  And what have you experienced so far?
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:40.480]  Well, you know, honestly, I expected that it was going to be a little bit more chaotic,
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:43.480]  but they really have cordoned off so much of the roads here.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:49.480]  They're doing a very good job at making sure you can't access any areas without the proper identification.
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:53.480]  So a lot of the George Soros groups, we've seen a lot.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:57.480]  We're going to be speaking with some of them right after what they're actually standing around waiting to speak with us.
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:59.480]  But they're all over the place.
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:04.480]  All of these people who don't even realize that they are working for one of the biggest globalists.
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:07.480]  Well, I tell you what, I mean, Margaret can pop anytime she wants Leanne,
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:11.480]  but we can obviously bleep it once, but tell them not to cuss if they do, we'll have to cut it off.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:15.480]  But let's go try to talk to some of these Soros minions right now if you want.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:18.480]  Okay. Well, now they're walking this way.
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:21.480]  I understand. Just whenever one pops by, we'll talk to him.
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:25.480]  You know, it's like that guy yesterday, he was running around, you know,
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:28.480]  and I guess he has a show on Cartoon Network to make a big deal of it that I got the wrong station.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.480]  Somebody told me he was with Comedy Central.
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.480]  So I said, Hey, did you, you know, it's things that people are getting mad at you to come up here and talk.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:36.480]  And then he only said was have sex to my wife.
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:40.480]  Why is he yellow? And it was like, Oh, Alex got defeated by that.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.480]  No, I was trying to go here.
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:42.480]  Here's some free speech.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.480]  And he's mocking building seven.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:44.480]  Yeah, mocking building seven.
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:46.480]  I'm just like, come up here, dude.
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:50.480]  And the people thought that defeated me when the guy's like he had a lobotomy or something.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:52.480]  I mean, I was just writing the embassy.
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:57.480]  I probably shouldn't admit it, but I manhandled him and pushed him down.
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:58.480]  Like, who are you?
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:45:59.480]  What a loser.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.480]  That's what you do with your life.
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:02.480]  That's how you're helping this country.
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:05.480]  I mean, these people are just sick in the head.
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:08.480]  I mean, at least some of the people that are out here, even though they're fighting on the wrong team,
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:10.480]  they're very passionate about what they do.
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:14.480]  And they're not using their five seconds to talk about utter ludicrousness.
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:15.480]  That's right.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:16.480]  We're live in Cleveland.
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:19.480]  Lee Ann McAdoo is out there in the 90 degree heat on a beautiful sunny day.
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:26.480]  We are up here in the command base, the studio right above the RNC meeting and the quick and alone center.
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.480]  We're going to be in there today as well.
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:37.480]  We're going to be going to this communist slash sort of Soros slash Nazi collaborator slash Black Lives Matter slash the Black Panther Party event at four o'clock.
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:39.480]  And again, Joe, what park is that?
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:42.480]  It's going to be at the public square park right over here around the corner.
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.480]  It's about a block away.
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:47.480]  All right, well, we're going to be moseying on over there to be able to cover that.
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:52.480]  Lee Ann, have you found any of the Soros minions?
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:54.480]  I do not see any at the present moment.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:59.480]  I do not. We've got Gunnar here who was really outspoken, getting in some confrontations.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:05.480]  What do you think about the fact that there are so many young people that want socialism in this country?
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:13.480]  Well, I think Bernie Sanders really touched the nerve in this country, you know, speaking about issues like student loans, Wall Street, crony capitalism.
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:15.480]  Why do you roll over then to Hillary?
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:21.480]  What Bernie did really well was he talked about issues and problems in this country, but he offered the wrong solution.
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:28.480]  Because the problems that he's been talking about are problems with crony capitalism, problems with the government picking winners and losers.
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:30.480]  And we are the losers.
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:34.480]  The people at the bottom, the students, the people who don't have a lot of money.
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:37.480]  Free market will make you so damn rich that you're going to be a failure.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:43.480]  Free asset problem more is to free up the markets and stay away from socialism. It's a failed experiment.
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:46.480]  It's going to have to be a three-year-old way to address this.
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:49.480]  So it's good to have people out here countering that.
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:52.480]  I'll just make a phone call.
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:57.480]  Leigh Ann, I'm sorry. I was listening to you. I was having a conversation over here.
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:02.480]  Sorry about that. I'm not able to get the feeds kind of coming in and out.
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:09.480]  But yeah, I mean, it's just really great to have so many people coming out here to counter these protesters who truly believe what they're telling you.
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:17.480]  I mean, this kid truly believed and fought to tell me that communism killed millions of people, democide.
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:19.480]  That's a big seven foot kid.
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.480]  And I had a guy yesterday tell me that Sharia Law was peaceful.
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:25.480]  Oh yeah, that guy said Sharia Law was peaceful.
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:27.480]  And some folks are saying, see, it is peaceful.
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:29.480]  Like that guy with the hatchet with the hat.
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:31.480]  Yeah, that was very peaceful and loving.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:35.480]  Oh yeah. Or the guy who stabbed his neighbors because they weren't dressing appropriately.
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:39.480]  So he was obviously having some lascivious thoughts about these young children.
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:42.480]  And so he stabs them. I mean, but safe and loving.
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:45.480]  Let's open up the borders. Let's not vet anyone.
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.480]  And that's racism.
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:50.480]  Hey, what matters is Melania Trump said she loved her family and loved America.
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:51.480]  That's plagiarism.
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:52.480]  Scandal.
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:56.480]  I had a girl tell me, I had a girl tell me yesterday that I was on her land.
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:59.480]  She's about a 23 year old little socialist punk.
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:01.480]  She goes, you're on my land. I'm a Native American.
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.480]  I was like, well, I was born here. I'm a Native American too.
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.480]  And I'm older than you. So I've been on this planet a lot longer than you.
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.480]  And I was like, I think you're a dumbass.
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.480]  And she's sitting there the whole time looking around.
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:15.480]  And she's going, oh, well now, then all of a sudden she switches. She's Mexican.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:17.480]  So she starts speaking to me in Spanish and then into another language.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.480]  I was like, I thought you were just Native American. Now you're Mexican.
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:21.480]  I was like, do you want to make America, Mexico again?
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:24.480]  She's like, this is not your land. I was like, well, guess what happens when you lose a war?
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:25.480]  We take the land. Sorry.
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:28.480]  Here's what happens. Nobody's, nobody's good or bad on either side.
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:31.480]  Nobody's bad. The point is, it's a joke.
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:32.480]  They're very bad.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:37.480]  The point is, is that as soon as we got here, the natives are always trying to get us to attack the other tribe.
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:40.480]  So they were just as warlike as the Europeans. We're all the same.
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:43.480]  We all do the same kind of crap. We're all good. We're all bad.
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:46.480]  It's just they teach these kids.
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:51.480]  You're going to get ahead in the world by being a socialist and being part of a group and you're owed reparations.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:54.480]  Guess what? You're not getting them. Nobody's getting them.
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:57.480]  The only reparations are getting our jobs back and our industry back.
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:58.480]  Leigh Ann Magado.
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:02.480]  Well, I agree. And that's one of the things that I really loved about Dinesh Jesus' movie.
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:04.480]  He put Hillary's America.
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:11.480]  He really spells it out. So many people who have been brainwashed in these Black Lives Matter cults and everything that are putting out these false narratives.
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:14.480]  They're only getting one side of history.
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:24.480]  And so we were speaking with several recovering Democrats who had been educated on the real truth of the Democratic Party, their racist roots, their thuggish roots.
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:30.480]  And just talking about that these are the same tactics that convicts, con men use to steal.
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:32.480]  That's what they're using to steal America.
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:34.480]  Exactly. Exactly.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:41.480]  And the big old mommy at the Democratic Party with all her little milkies, you know, there with all her little slaves on the fetid poisoned milk.
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:46.480]  She can't keep her minions in the dark for life. She can't hide them from the waiting world.
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:50.480]  We'll be back. Great job, Leigh Ann. We'll talk to Margaret Howe and more straight ahead.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:51:03.480]  Here's a live coverage of RNC from Cleveland 2016 on Alex Jones in FullWars.com.
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:38.480]  There is an affordable alternative to the high cost of health care that offers freedom from insurance while providing compliance with the Obamacare individual mandate.
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:44.480]  Imagine having access to quality, affordable health care that allows you the freedom to choose your doctor and hospital.
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:50.480]  Members can share up to 100% of necessary medical expenses, including some alternative treatments.
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:55.480]  Find out how you and your family can contain health care costs without giving up your freedom.
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:52:00.480]  Go to libertyoncall.org. That's libertyoncall.org.
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:04.480]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:09.480]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:14.480]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:22.480]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:29.480]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:32.480]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:37.480]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:40.480]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:43.480]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:46.480]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:50.480]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:55.480]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:58.480]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:03.480]  Paid non-attorney spokesperson. Bar Justice is responsible for the content of this ad.
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:20.480]  Attention, all women who have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. In February and May 2016, Johnson & Johnson baby powder was ordered to pay $72 million and $55 million by two juries to two women who contracted ovarian cancer after years of using the talcum baby powder product.
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:29.480]  Multiple studies show that women who have long-term use of talcum powder in products such as baby powder for feminine hygiene can increase the risk of contracting ovarian cancer.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:37.480]  If you or a family member have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and used talcum powder prior to the diagnosis, call talcum baby powder alert today.
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:44.480]  You may be entitled to substantial compensation. The consultation is free and you'll pay nothing unless you receive a settlement.
[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:52.480]  So if you or a loved one used talcum baby powder products before being diagnosed with or died from ovarian cancer, make this important, free call today.
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:59.480]  Call 1-800-588-7342.
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:22.480]  We will not be forgotten. We won't be left behind. Our victories will all be for a mind.
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:38.480]  One of the biggest things that hurts my feelings and one of the biggest victories of the globalist and mainstream media is that Ron Paul, back in 2007 or so, along with the Liberty Movement, started the Tea Party.
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:46.480]  And we would throw 9-11 commission reports into the water instead of 9-11 was a fraud, but also say we're anti-war but we're more libertarian than conservative.
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:53.480]  And then that movement built and then as soon as Obama got in, people were protesting Republicans and Democrats.
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:58.480]  The Republicans got scared. They came and tried to co-opt the Tea Party. It kind of co-opted them, though. There was an internal battle.
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:05.480]  But the media would say minorities aren't welcome. These are racist.
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:24.480]  And then folks were scared it wouldn't go out to the Tea Party rallies and it became a self-fulfilling prophecy to say if you're pro-gun or pro-family or pro-private property or pro-sovereignty or pro-Christianity or pro-life, you know, but you're a minority, you're not welcome at the Tea Party or the new Second American Revolution.
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:31.480]  That's not going on. In fact, now that people of quote color have actually been going to Tea Party events the last few years, you go and it's like a third or half of them are.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:37.480]  Because they got everybody's hug and everybody loves them. It's like, you know, I mean, you go and it's like Christian patriots, folks.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:43.480]  You go, there's a thousand people. There might be one clan guy. I mean, it is amazing. Just like our rally yesterday.
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:51.480]  Had to be about a thousand people. News said 500. I mean, it was like a third African-Americans. It was just so amazing.
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:56:05.480]  But again, the way they sell this really worked for a while. And imagine just you win the revolution. If you say anyone who has any color can't be pro-gun or pro-life or pro-America or not want Sharia law.
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:12.480]  Well, I mean, that's crazy. And that's why they're race baiting. I mean, Donald Trump is not racist in any way.
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:22.480]  I mean, I have like NPR and also had democracy now go to me. Do you support Donald Trump banning all Muslims? And I said, yeah, until they're vetted, they don't even check their passports or IDs.
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:26.480]  They let them in. We don't know the numbers. I've stayed banned anybody coming in until we've got them.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:33.480]  Yep. I mean, that's how it is every other country. So I want to go to Margaret Howe, one of our great reporters out there braving the heat.
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.480]  What is your view of being here three days now, Margaret?
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:44.480]  Well, Alex, we're on the ground and can I just say back to that comment you just made about anybody who is African-American supporting Trump is being a racist.
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:54.480]  I actually found this amazing guy right here, Eric. Look at this Trump shirt, Alex. What do you think, sir? You're a Trump supporter, correct?
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.480]  I am. I am.
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:56.480]  Can you tell me why?
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:04.480]  I'm a Trump supporter because people don't listen to his views on healthcare, but he has views on healthcare. And I like that.
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:14.480]  They don't listen to his views on the border, which are real views on the border. He actually says not all Mexicans, he says Mexicans who are unvetted.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:16.480]  Trump's not a racist, right?
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:30.480]  No, no, no, no, no, no man, no man, no man. Well, people don't know as of one day Trump got his limousine, got pulled over or flat-tired, and he then paid that guy's house off and came and helped him out.
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:31.480]  Nobody knows that.
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.480]  Nobody knows that.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:39.480]  Why do you think that the evil liberal left media wants to paint him as a racist? Why is that their narrative, do you think?
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:47.480]  To help Hillary. Why not? It's easy. Why not? They want to help Hillary. Why not? Why wouldn't they? Because they want to help Hillary.
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:59.480]  Like, look at all the movies that come out these days. Who's the heroine? It's all women. I'm okay with women. I have three daughters. I'm okay with women being heroes, but why are they doing it?
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:01.480]  It's an agenda, exactly.
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:04.480]  It's like, when do we have a centralized agenda? This guy gets it.
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:06.480]  It's an agenda. Yes, ma'am.
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:10.480]  Have you always felt this way? How long have you been like this?
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:13.480]  How long have I been like? How long have I been like this?
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:15.480]  How long have you been awake?
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:17.480]  I've been awake for years. For years. Okay.
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:19.480]  Hey, tell them to stay there. I want to come right back to it, Margaret.
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:22.480]  He's going to come right back to you, sir. I want you to hang out with me.
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:31.480]  10 seconds. All right. We're talking to, I'm telling you, folks, there are just people who happen to have dark skin all over Cleveland that are info warriors and Trump supporters.
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:32.480]  Oh, yeah.
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:37.480]  I mean, we got to go out and show this. I mean, it's in the crowds. It's like a third of the people are black that are here supporting them.
[01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:38.480]  Extremely passionate.
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:42.480]  Absolutely. And they're totally awake. And more articulate than I am. That guy just said it in like 10 seconds.
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:46.480]  It's a whole agenda, folks. Centralized BS agenda.
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:52.480]  Hey, everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side.
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:56.480]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:58.480]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:04.480]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country.
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:08.480]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:11.480]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge.
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:15.480]  And everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:19.480]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity,
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:25.480]  and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives

[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:36.480]  you need to check out infowarsteam.com.
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:40.480]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition. Head over to infowarsteam.com.

[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:34.480]  Yeah, coming in with some buckaroo buns. Of course there you go buckaroo buns.
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:39.480]  Alright, listen, I don't see the feed in live time.
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:42.480]  It's about info wars open with the video feed. It's about a minute behind.
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:48.480]  I was just talking about how many great black Americans, Hispanic Americans there are supporting info wars in Trump here.
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:53.480]  About as many info wars as Trump t-shirts. I wonder Trump noticed it.
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:57.480]  And then all of a sudden I can't even see her feed yet. She goes, I happen to have a guy right here who wants to talk.
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:59.480]  You know, there's a black American who's away.
[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:02.480]  So that's what I'm talking about. It's almost like that was staged. It wasn't staged.
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:09.480]  It shows how what you see in mainstream media is not the reality of what's going on and Americans are coming together.
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:12.480]  And that's the beautiful thing, repudiating the establishment.
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:15.480]  Margaret, let's go back to your friend and talk to him some more.
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:23.480]  You know, I lost him, Alex, but I found some other people that really wanted to talk to us that are here today on the opposite side of this.
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:27.480]  We've got a bust up militarism. What's going on guys?
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:34.480]  We're here to talk about the endless wars and the fact that United States is responsible for perpetuating a lot of the violence and extremism that we have in this world.
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:40.480]  We want to talk about cutting our military budget back, reinvesting that money into our communities.
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:43.480]  What does the bra have to do with it? Can't you do that with a shirt on?
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:44.480]  Sure.
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:46.480]  Yeah, it's a clever messaging, right? Bust up.
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:47.480]  And there you go.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:50.480]  You know what? We've got these social justice warriors out in full force.
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:55.480]  And just a quick question. Do you guys know that you're working directly for George Soros?
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:59.480]  I'm sorry. I'm just really against militarism, if that's what you're talking about.
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:04.480]  And I think that we need to cut our military budget in order to focus on things at home, like healthcare.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:06.480]  What about Hillary launching all these wars?
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:08.480]  What about Hillary launching all these wars?
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:12.480]  Oh yeah, she is definitely the biggest war hawk running for office right now. There's no doubt about it.
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:13.480]  What about Libya?
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:16.480]  What about Trump not wanting to go to war in Iraq or Afghanistan?
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:18.480]  Yeah, Trump was against Iraq. She's for it, witch.
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:19.480]  So many.
[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:22.480]  Trump was against Iraq. What do you say about that?
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:25.480]  I mean, aren't you a Trump supporter for that reason alone?
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:29.480]  He doesn't want to engage in foreign wars and cost American lives, not to mention the foreign lives.
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:30.480]  And against Syria.
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:34.480]  Yeah, absolutely. I'm not a Trump supporter on a single issue alone.
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.480]  I think the hateful rhetoric is going to lead to violence and extremism.
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:40.480]  We've experienced that in context of protesting alone.
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:48.480]  What kind of safety can be guaranteed if somebody at this presidential platform is going to give us a permission to be violent when it's dissent on the line?
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:53.480]  You know what, doll, I hear you, but at the same time, you know, if we don't have a strong front, what do you make of our open borders?
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:55.480]  I'd love to know what you make about that.
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:57.480]  Open borders? Absolutely. I'm refugees.
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:59.480]  Welcome. I stood up yesterday.
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:01.480]  Welcome. Welcome to your hatchage.
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:04.480]  I mean, aren't you kind of asking for it without a vetted...
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:09.480]  You know, I keep getting asked if I'm asking for violence, if I'm asking for rape.
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:11.480]  I should realize the epitome of violence.
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:13.480]  And I definitely disagree.
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:15.480]  Does every migrant get a free hatchage when they come in?
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:18.480]  I think I'll see a hatchage.
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:21.480]  And not somebody's religious beliefs. Thanks for your time, though. I really appreciate it.
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:23.480]  Hope you've got some pepper spray.
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:27.480]  She's saying thanks for your time. She's out of talking points.
[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:30.480]  Ask her who pays her to be there and ask...
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:34.480]  You know, I wonder if she knows she's an indirect on Soros' payroll.
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:39.480]  That would be my next question for her, but she looks a little preoccupied, handing out those bras.
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:41.480]  You know, my gosh.
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.480]  You know, Alex... I love how the leftists always have women like naked.
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:47.480]  They said they're not objectifying women.
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:49.480]  That PETA and Soros always have them half naked.
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:51.480]  The total objectification.
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:53.480]  It's just like, it's everything they do is the opposite of reality.
[02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:56.480]  Does she have hairy armpits or blue hair?
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:58.480]  No, Margaret.
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:01.480]  You know, I don't want to disrespect hairy armpits because we've all been there.
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:05.480]  But just Alex, you've got some of the most gorgeous women in the world working for you.
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:07.480]  I've got Leanne to my right.
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:10.480]  Just the N. Millie to the epitome.
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:12.480]  We're at the rally there.
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:14.480]  Millie just left the flag-burning rally.
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:16.480]  She's got some amazing footage.
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:18.480]  I can't wait to see it myself.
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:20.480]  Millie, what was going on down there?
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:24.480]  Yes, so it seems like everybody's in a heightened state of emotion right now.
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:28.480]  We have anti-American, anti-Trump protesters in the streets.
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:30.480]  At the same time, we also...
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:32.480]  Burning American flags.
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:34.480]  Yes, well, they weren't necessarily burning.
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:36.480]  They were stopping.
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:40.480]  Draping on the ground and stopping it and yelling out profanities.
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:45.480]  Basically, they were very much against America and what America stands for.
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:47.480]  You and Millie stay right there, Margaret.
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:50.480]  We're going to come right back to you and Millie to talk about this.
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:54.480]  We're going to a thorough sponsored BLM, New Black Panther,
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:57.480]  Communist meeting as well in a couple of hours of live feeds of that.
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:07.480]  Thanks for watching JonesInFallWars.com. Stay with us.
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:33.480]  Patrick Culver, who is the head of the Director General of Internal Security,
[02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:36.480]  told members of a French parliamentary commission,
[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:39.480]  we are on the brink of a civil war.
[02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:43.480]  French security forces are also preparing for mass civil unrest
[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:47.480]  and radicalized immigrants taking over entire neighborhoods.

[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:53.480]  So many people calling to my radio show and telling me how young Jebedy
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:56.480]  and the products at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:59.480]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:01.480]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:02.480]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:03.480]  Why is this so good?
[02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:09.480]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:14.480]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:18.480]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:22.480]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:26.480]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:29.480]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:30.480]  These are all parasites.
[02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:32.480]  Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it.
[02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:34.480]  You have the neem in there.
[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:37.480]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:40.480]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:43.480]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:44.480]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:48.480]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose.
[02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:50.480]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:53.480]  And you can support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:55.480]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[02:07:55.480 --> 02:08:15.480]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:25.480]  Transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:32.480]  Hollywood.
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:38.480]  All right, Mr. D bringing us in.
[02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:43.480]  I'm working sunglasses because the light is shooting right through these big windows over the RNC,
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:46.480]  the Quicken Loan Center, and it is like torture.
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:48.480]  So me and Beggs are wearing our sunglasses.
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:51.480]  We're not trying that cool, even though it is kind of fun.
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:54.480]  We're the Blues Brothers now, but we're teleprompter free.
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:56.480]  We're real media, just real analysis.
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:59.480]  They've got a, well, tell folks what's coming up.
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:02.480]  We're going to shoot a quick video of this off the live show and sit down on Twitter and Facebook.
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:05.480]  It's about an hour and 50 minutes from now.
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:09.480]  We've got the Communist Group, the new Black Panther Party,
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:11.480]  and the Black Lives Matter people meeting.
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:13.480]  We're told this is the big enchilada.
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:16.480]  Everybody who's here in Cleveland needs to be there to cover this.
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:20.480]  We're going to be there peacefully covering it and asking these folks questions.
[02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:24.480]  Because we've seen the new Black Panther Party going out and saying, kill cops, and it happens.
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:26.480]  And Obama says, yeah, we've got to reform the cops.
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:29.480]  Average cop pumping gas, it's his fault, blows brains out.
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:31.480]  Just to me, people go, why are you for the cops?
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:36.480]  He's coming back and I'm like, I'm not for shooting anybody in the back of the head who had done anything wrong.
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:40.480]  Whether it be a bad cop shooting somebody or it be a crazy person shooting somebody.
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:44.480]  But statistically, police really aren't doing this.
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:46.480]  Are the police doing some things that are wrong?
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:49.480]  Yeah, I'm the guy that's always exposing it, but it doesn't mean I hate the police.
[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:50.480]  We want to kill the police.
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:52.480]  We're going to go back to our guests that are there on the street.
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:55.480]  But Joe Biggs, tell folks what the tales.
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:10:01.480]  I want to encourage each and every one of you in the Cleveland area to come out today to the Public Square Park.
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:07.480]  It's in between Third Street and Second Street, right in between Prospect Avenue and West Huron Road.
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:15.480]  Today, Dr. Cornel West, Carl Dix of the Revolutionary Communist Party, the new Black Panther Party,
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:19.480]  and the Huey P. Newton Gun Club will be out there in a huge rally.
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:24.480]  So I want to encourage all of you to come out, wear your Hillary for Prison T-shirts and InfoWars shirt,
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:30.480]  engage in conversation, ask these guys what they're about, find out what it is they're trying to do,
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:31.480]  and let's all come together.
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:36.480]  Let's have a good talk and let's be peaceful, but this should be a pretty big rally based off the chatter.
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:39.480]  I'm getting here from local law enforcement.
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:43.480]  All right. Let's go back to our crew.
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:45.480]  They're on the ground right outside where we're at.
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:49.480]  It's got a Margaret Howell. You were there talking to some folks.
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:52.480]  We got caught off at the break. Please continue.
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:57.480]  Well, Alex, I'm here with Millie, and she was just telling me about this protest rally.
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:00.480]  Can you tell me a little bit about this, Millie, that we're stomping the flag?
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:06.480]  So the incident started with the police confiscating the metal pole from this man's American flag
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:09.480]  and replacing it with a cardboard pole.
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:16.480]  Then the media encircled the man, and I then asked the man if he felt his rights were being violated.
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:18.480]  It became clear to me that he didn't care about his rights.
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:24.480]  He just cared about disrespecting veterans and disrespecting the American flag.
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:31.480]  Then at some point I asked him, don't you think you're disrespecting veterans by draping the flag on the floor
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:33.480]  and stomping on it?
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:37.480]  We lay the flag over veterans' coffins when they've died.
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:42.480]  Then a biker's for Trump man jumped in, and the incident escalated,
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:44.480]  and they began fighting over the flag.
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:46.480]  The police had to jump in.
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:50.480]  Things got really heated. It was a pretty intense event.
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:53.480]  I've never felt safer than when there's a biker for Trump around.
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:55.480]  He was a very nice guy.
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:12:01.480]  He was very respectful, and he just couldn't stand seeing the flag being disrespected in that way.
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:06.480]  They were yelling F the American flag, and it was just pretty disrespectful on there.
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:08.480]  Sure, let's be clear. Let's be clear here.
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:11.480]  American flags have been used for some things that are wrong,
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:16.480]  but also the globalists when they do that, they're saying our country, our laws, our freedoms,
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:19.480]  this is a globalist takeover telling us that they're going to bring it down.
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:23.480]  People do have a free speech right to burn it if they want,
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:28.480]  but they don't have a right to go out in public in front of veterans and try to incite a riot.
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:32.480]  This is disorderly conduct. That's why they're doing this.
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:37.480]  This is the same crew, the same group of folks that are running this whole destabilization program.
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:40.480]  They want to go to a park like I've done and burn the U.N. flag,
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:43.480]  but I don't run up in front of people and get in their face.
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:45.480]  I don't do it at a U.N. building.
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:49.480]  The point is they're doing all of this to incite and try to get riots going to say,
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:52.480]  oh, that's Trump's fault. They've been doing this all along.
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:54.480]  Let's get her take on that.
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:59.480]  You know, Alex, speaking of violence, the nonviolent girls that don't want any militarization,
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:02.480]  just their bras on, they've resorted to vulgarity.
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:04.480]  They've taken over the street now.
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:07.480]  They're right in the middle of the street, and they're actually one of them laying on the ground
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:10.480]  because she's all about the nonviolence.
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:12.480]  Let's show that. Let's show that.
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:15.480]  One of the sorrows people, I know these tags are just sorrows.
[02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:18.480]  One of those affiliated groups are now laying half naked in the street.
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:20.480]  She's gotten up.
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:23.480]  I mean, just taking over the whole street, you know, this is a thoroughfare.
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:25.480]  This road is not closed.
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:27.480]  People, they need to get to and from.
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:32.480]  And to take over the middle of the street and bras, just, just, ah.
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:35.480]  Here we go.
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:38.480]  If you're a radio listener, we have live feeds at info wars.com,
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:41.480]  forward slash show, live coverage to the RNC.
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:45.480]  Our, our, our same guy, our guy that was away has engaged in one of them
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:48.480]  and a conversation with one of them. Of course, there's no talking to her.
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:50.480]  Here, here, let's see this conversation.
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:53.480]  Take them home. Show me your guns here.
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:55.480]  All right, now I'm not going to say anything more.
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:59.480]  All I'm saying is it's not appropriate to be asking women to take their bras off.
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:01.480]  What do you want to say on camera?
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:05.480]  It's not appropriate for them to be out here the way that they are.
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:07.480]  Sorry, what's wrong with that? What's wrong with that?
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:09.480]  I didn't ask them to take their bras off.
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:11.480]  They didn't ask them to take their bras off.
[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:13.480]  Did we go to a swimming pool?
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:15.480]  Did we go to a swimming pool?
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:17.480]  You're making it up then. You just said, no, I didn't do the,
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:19.480]  but yes you did. You said...
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:20.480]  So, which is it?
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:21.480]  Derek, how you doing? You hanging in there?
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:22.480]  I'm sorry.
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:24.480]  You hanging in there? What happened?
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:26.480]  He's been early on.
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:28.480]  I'm hanging in there, dude.
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:29.480]  You want to drop your pants, don't you?
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:31.480]  No, no, I don't want to drop my pants. It's good to go.
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:33.480]  My pants stay on. I'm good to go.
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:35.480]  No, no, don't drop the bras.
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:38.480]  I'm good to go. My pants, I'm sorry. I keep hanging.
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:40.480]  My pants are clean.
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:42.480]  What I'm saying is that these women want to say
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:44.480]  that they're coming out with their bras off.
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:46.480]  So, what is their point?
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:48.480]  Okay, bras exposed. What's their point?
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:50.480]  What's wrong with bras exposed?
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:52.480]  Ask them what their point is. Is that threatening you?
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:54.480]  They're trying to sexualize their message.
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:55.480]  And why is it bothering you?
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:57.480]  No, I'm fainting. I'm not bothering.
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:58.480]  Okay, so why are you making a point about it?
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:14:59.480]  So what is their point?
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:01.480]  You have a Trump t-shirt on. That offends me.
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:04.480]  All right, so we've got Fiddo and Alessio, the big beard.
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:07.480]  And he's sitting there, you know, denying all this is going on.
[02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:09.480]  And all they want is attention.
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:10.480]  Something they got took over the stage yesterday.
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:12.480]  He said, what color is my PP?
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:15.480]  What color is my urine? I have sex with my wife.
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:17.480]  It's all just to be shocking to divert
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:19.480]  from the fact that foreign banks have taken the country over.
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:21.480]  They're trying to arrest the press.
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:23.480]  They're trying to bankrupt us.
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:27.480]  And the borders are completely wide open at every front.
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:29.480]  And so it just descends into total idiocy.
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:32.480]  You've got all these mentally ill, weak people.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:35.480]  They're getting $15 an hour from different foundation groups
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:39.480]  coming in just to sell as much discord as they can.
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:42.480]  Margaret, that's just a bunch of idiots out there.
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:44.480]  Come on, Alex. We're down here.
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:46.480]  We're hoping to bring you guys the latest
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:48.480]  of what's happening right in front of this convention.
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:50.480]  But I tell you, some of these arguments,
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:51.480]  I can't help but laugh.
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:52.480]  I'm going to have to put this microphone down a second
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:54.480]  and just have a good laugh after what I just heard.
[02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:57.480]  This guy needs to go home and just have a bath, honestly.
[02:15:57.480 --> 02:15:58.480]  Whoo.
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:15:59.480]  What can you make?
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:01.480]  Well, they think me stinky is powerful.
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:03.480]  It is powerful.
[02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:05.480]  Well, they think witch is melancholy.
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:07.480]  I don't know.
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:09.480]  Can we move away from him?
[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:10.480]  I'm getting sick to smiling.
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:12.480]  All right. Well, listen, Margaret, pull away from him.
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:14.480]  Rick and order reset up.
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:16.480]  We'll come back to you in about five minutes.
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:18.480]  We do have Richard Reeves with us right now.
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:21.480]  And Richard Reeves is here, one of our great crew members,
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:23.480]  kind of behind the scenes, a lot of stuff done,
[02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:26.480]  but our political correspondent to talk about
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:28.480]  what Wayne Madsen discovered yesterday.
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:30.480]  They didn't just try to have this no vote
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:32.480]  and then try to steal it from Trump, which failed yesterday.
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:35.480]  Then they claim that Trump's wife is plagiarizing stuff,
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:36.480]  which isn't true.
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:38.480]  Now their new stunt is reportedly tomorrow night.
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:41.480]  They're bragging to our reporters on the ground.
[02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:43.480]  Wayne Madsen, they're planning a walkout
[02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:46.480]  of Cruz and Rubio delegates to try to embarrass
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:48.480]  Trump and help Hillary.
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:50.480]  And we also have the good old suspect, Glenn Beck,
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:53.480]  on national TV, ABC News, you name it,
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:55.480]  saying, you know, vote for Hillary Clinton.
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:57.480]  I mean, this is the huge Republican establishment
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:16:59.480]  proving they're for Hillary.
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:01.480]  I mean, regardless what you think about Trump,
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:03.480]  I mean, Trump's better than Hillary.
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:05.480]  What do you make of that, Richard Reeves?
[02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:06.480]  Well, Alex, thank you.
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:09.480]  I am broadcasting from the Pirate Mobile Command Center
[02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:11.480]  for infowars.com.
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:14.480]  And yes, what you saw last yesterday
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:18.480]  was one of the last dying gas with the Never Trump movement.
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:20.480]  They are just on their deathbed.
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:22.480]  They do have this plan for tomorrow
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:24.480]  where they're going to try to have some folks walk out.
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:27.480]  But yesterday, the reports were that they only had
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:30.480]  parts of the Colorado and Iowa delegation
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:32.480]  where all that walked out yesterday
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:36.480]  when they got shot down over the denial of approving the rules.
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:39.480]  They wanted to not approve the rules that came out
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:41.480]  of the Rules Committee, which were in favor
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:43.480]  of the nomination of Donald Trump.
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:46.480]  And that indeed is what did get approved yesterday.
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:49.480]  Basically, what happened was, is what we had in 2012
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:52.480]  where the Ron Pollars got shut down
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:55.480]  from even being able to proffer their vote at the convention,
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:57.480]  which it would have been a losing vote,
[02:17:57.480 --> 02:17:59.480]  but their votes at least would have gotten counted
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:01.480]  as part of the nomination process.
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:03.480]  And you'd have had Mitt Romney the winner
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:05.480]  with X number of votes,
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:08.480]  and then Ron Paul with a small minority of votes
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:11.480]  that at least would have showed the contest how it went down.
[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:15.480]  But basically, they were shut down in 2012.
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:18.480]  The establishment shut down the Ron Pollars' heart.
[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:21.480]  This time, it was the chew on the other foot.
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:23.480]  I'm not necessarily in favor of what they did,
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:27.480]  but clearly, Trump has a majority delegates there.
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:30.480]  Clearly, he has a popular vote that tried to convince us he didn't.
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:31.480]  That's failed.
[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:32.480]  So what are you making this new report?
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:34.480]  They're going to try the stunning in tomorrow night.
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:37.480]  Well, I think that their plan is going to fall short,
[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:40.480]  but all these delegates worked very, very hard
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:42.480]  to get in that convention center.
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:44.480]  So you may have a minority walks out.
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:48.480]  Believe me, their alternates are chomping at the bit.
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:50.480]  There's, you know, all these alternates show up.
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:52.480]  Most conventions alternates do not show up.
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:55.480]  The alternates, I'm sure for the most part,
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:57.480]  only 90% have shown up.
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:18:59.480]  And if there's any kind of a walk out,
[02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:01.480]  you can expect the alternates to fill in.
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:05.480]  And clearly, the body of delegates for the overall convention
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:08.480]  is in the 70 to 80% range.
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:10.480]  So Donald Trump's got it.
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:11.480]  Donald Trump's got it.
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:13.480]  They're just trying to embarrass him.
[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:16.480]  Like with this thing claiming that Melania plagiarized.
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:18.480]  I read her speech versus the other.
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:20.480]  This is classic stuff you say about, you know,
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:22.480]  loving her parents, loving the roots,
[02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:24.480]  loving America, the American dream.
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:27.480]  And but it's not even the exact words.
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:28.480]  Clearly not plagiarism.
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:31.480]  This is basically stating stuff everybody says.
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:32.480]  Talk about desperate.
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:33.480]  This is so obvious.
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:35.480]  I think this is going to backfire him as well.
[02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:36.480]  Stay there, Richard.
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:37.480]  I want to talk to you about this straight ahead.
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:39.480]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:43.480]  When he said he's on the mobile pirate command base,
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:46.480]  when Hillary had an exclusion zone a week ago
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:49.480]  put in to stop our planes from flying starting on Monday.
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:50.480]  We flew the days before.
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:51.480]  I said, that's it.
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:54.480]  A little bird told me there's going to be a micro FM
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:56.480]  pirate transmitter brought in an open frequency.
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:57.480]  It covers the whole city.

[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:03.480]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:06.480]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:08.480]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:11.480]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you,
[02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:13.480]  there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:17.480]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:19.480]  With the IRS's new programs,
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:21.480]  there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:26.480]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, that's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website,
[02:22:26.480 --> 02:22:55.480]  DanPillard.com.
[02:22:57.480 --> 02:23:01.480]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator,
[02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:03.480]  but we're waiting for an outrageously low price,
[02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:06.480]  you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:07.480]  Here's why.
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:10.480]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:12.480]  and it's getting worse, so please listen.
[02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:16.480]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:19.480]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently,
[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:22.480]  emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:26.480]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:29.480]  you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:31.480]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:23:31.480 --> 02:23:36.480]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:40.480]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:43.480]  in addition to the low price for infill-wars listeners.
[02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:45.480]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:48.480]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:52.480]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:24:21.480]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:26.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:32.480]  Richard Reeves trying to start a mobile command bus that is sending out 94.5.
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:34.480]  We'll have a frequency, obviously, in Philadelphia.
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:37.480]  We're going to have aircraft from other parts of the country since they're censoring us there.
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:39.480]  We're having a gigantic effect.
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:43.480]  We have mobile TV vans that have giant jumbo trons with 94.5
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:46.480]  and infillwars.com for live coverage driving around.
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:50.480]  I told folks this year I normally try to piggy bank some extra money
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:52.480]  for our emergency backup for the infill-wars operation.
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:55.480]  We're hiring new people, new reporters, camera folks, writers.
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:24:59.480]  We are putting everything in full push.
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:03.480]  And we're working 14 to 15 hours a day, not just here, but the crew back in Austin.
[02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:06.480]  I want to thank you all for your support that we are all in.
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:08.480]  Richard Reeves, what is it like for you?
[02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:13.480]  You've been working with me off and on for, I don't know, 18 years or so.
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:17.480]  We've covered other RNCs in New York and Denver together, DNCs.
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:20.480]  What is it like just to see what the infill war is doing?
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:25.480]  Not bragging about infill war, but just an example of populism in the globalist face.
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:27.480]  We have such devastating success.
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:29.480]  Hundreds of news articles a day.
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:31.480]  Hundreds of TV stations covering stuff.
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:33.480]  We're dominating coverage.
[02:25:33.480 --> 02:25:34.480]  Our information is getting out.
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:36.480]  It's having a huge effect, Richard.
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:37.480]  That just shows of others take action.
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:39.480]  Goodbye, New World Order.
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:40.480]  Absolutely.
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:41.480]  Two words to describe it.
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:44.480]  Exhilarating, electrifying.
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:48.480]  It's been unbelievable to see the progress we've made, huge progress going on.
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:53.480]  That's why the Never Trumpers, the last tail end of the establishment faction,
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:56.480]  they're going to pull whatever they pull tomorrow, their parliamentary trick.
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:57.480]  But they're going down.
[02:25:57.480 --> 02:26:01.480]  And I think one of the key things that happened along the way was Donald Trump
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:05.480]  hiring Paul Manafort at the suggestion of Roger Stone.
[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:09.480]  That combined with Roger Stone coming on your show, getting all the intel out,
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:14.480]  rallying the Info Warriors, and ultimately the most important people in the world.
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:15.480]  But again, it's not about credit.
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:16.480]  I'm not that big.
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:18.480]  Stone isn't that big.
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:19.480]  Drudge is big, but not that big.
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:22.480]  The elite is a rotting carcass.
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:25.480]  All we have to do is stand up against it like an old rotting barn in a big wind
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:26.480]  that's going to blow over.
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:28.480]  I think we've reached that point, Richard.
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:29.480]  Absolutely.
[02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:32.480]  You used to have a little trailer that you played.
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:35.480]  It was, I think, from the Dark Crystal where the emperor is on his deathbed
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:38.480]  and they're trying to grab his scepter.
[02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:41.480]  And you know how they try to get his scepter from him, and he says,
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:42.480]  I'm not dead yet.
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:44.480]  And he reaches out and grabs it back.
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:48.480]  Well, I think we've passed the point where the emperor can even say that I'm not dead yet.
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:52.480]  Basically, the emperor is not able to really reach back for the scepter anymore,
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:55.480]  except maybe in his death dreams.
[02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:56.480]  So yes, absolutely.
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:26:57.480]  I totally agree.
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:26:58.480]  In fact, can we come in?
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:26:59.480]  They got one in German and Chinese.
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:00.480]  We always should play that one.
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:03.480]  Play the one in English, Dark Crystal, Death of the Emperor.
[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:05.480]  And of course, I played this with the Saudi King died.
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:06.480]  They tried to censor us and got real mad.
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:09.480]  I said, this is actual footage of the Saudi King dying.
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:11.480]  But that censorship failed.
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:15.480]  But yeah, we should play that because Hillary is literally them trying to reanimate this.
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:18.480]  And they've never made themselves more open and more clear.
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:20.480]  What in your gut, Richard?
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:23.480]  Because I remember you coming with, like, a year and a half ago with stone in the office
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:24.480]  and that meeting we had.
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:26.480]  We can't get into the internal baseball of that, obviously.
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:30.480]  But just the fact that Donald Trump would basically reach out to us,
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:34.480]  shows you what Dr. Corsi said six months ago is true.
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:36.480]  He knew him 40 years ago.
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:38.480]  And Trump has always been an anti-New World Order guy.
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:41.480]  He was just keeping it stealth until he activated.
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:44.480]  And they've got a dossier on him, and that's why they're so scared.
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:45.480]  I really think that's the truth.
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:48.480]  I think Trump is a stealth patriot.
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:51.480]  Well, I absolutely think we're going to get the opportunity to find out.
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:54.480]  I think that, you know, here we are,
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:57.480]  towards about three quarters through July.
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:00.480]  We've got August, September, October for more and more people to wake up.
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:05.480]  You know, it's that hundredth monkey syndrome where you've got the hundred monkeys on the island.
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:11.480]  And we're up there where probably there's 25, 30, or 40% of the monkeys are awake.
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:15.480]  So if those 20 or 30% can just wake up one other monkey,
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:20.480]  well, you're talking about 60 to 70% of us Info Warrior monkeys are going to be wide awake.
[02:28:20.480 --> 02:28:22.480]  And we're going to be ready to fire Hillary.
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:25.480]  And Donald Trump's going to come in.
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:27.480]  I think he's going to prosecute her to the max.
[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:32.480]  You know, this Hillary for prison meme hopefully will become a reality because I know that
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:36.480]  with the airplanes in the air and the trucks floating around with the ads, everything,
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:39.480]  that meme has just gotten out there so big.
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:42.480]  And notice everybody wants her to go to prison with her being above the law.
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:43.480]  It's just beautiful.
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:46.480]  Folks say, Hillary might come after you like, oh, you mean they might come after me?
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:47.480]  Oh, I never thought of that.
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:49.480]  Oh, God, I'm quitting what I'm doing.
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:53.480]  We were going here to the basically the new Black Panther Party,
[02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:55.480]  you know, kill the pig event in an hour.
[02:28:55.480 --> 02:28:57.480]  Yeah, yeah, we know.
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:28:58.480]  Okay.
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:28:59.480]  People just don't get bigs.
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:02.480]  The fact that we're committed and they keep telling us, hey, you know, you might get hurt.
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:03.480]  Oh, really?
[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:04.480]  That's part of the job.
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:05.480]  It's part of the job.
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:08.480]  I'm not rolling over and waiting into my house, folks.
[02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:14.480]  Well, you know, on the field, on the field, on the intellectual field, we're on the field.
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:15.480]  Right out.
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:16.480]  That's right.
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:17.480]  That's right, Alex.
[02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:22.480]  And speaking of the protesters, I in 2008, I went to the RNC in St. Paul and what I saw
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:26.480]  so far over there in St. Paul was a much bigger left-wing opposition.
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:32.480]  So it's got to be frustrating for poor billionaire George Soros that, hey, he's got unlimited money.
[02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:33.480]  But you know what?
[02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:40.480]  He doesn't have enough stinky, unbathed protesters to show up at the RNC in Cleveland.
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:41.480]  That's right.
[02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:42.480]  Let's look at some of this scum.
[02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:44.480]  Let's come in with the A-Team abortionist clip.
[02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:46.480]  And then we'll go back to Richard and the callers.
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:53.480]  I'm going to give the number out 800-25 at 9-9-231, open phones 800-25 at 9-9-231.
[02:29:53.480 --> 02:30:22.480]  That's right.
[02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:48.480]  That's right.
[02:30:48.480 --> 02:31:14.480]  That's right.
[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:40.480]  That's right.
[02:31:40.480 --> 02:32:06.480]  That's right.
[02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:35.480]  That's right.
[02:32:35.480 --> 02:32:59.480]  That's right.
[02:32:59.480 --> 02:33:25.480]  That's right.
[02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:51.480]  That's right.
[02:33:51.480 --> 02:34:17.480]  That's right.
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:43.480]  That's right.
[02:34:43.480 --> 02:35:09.480]  That's right.
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:35.480]  That's right.
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:36:01.480]  That's right.
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:27.480]  That's right.
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:53.480]  That's right.
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:37:19.480]  That's right.
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:45.480]  That's right.
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:38:11.480]  That's right.
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:37.480]  That's right.
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:39:03.480]  That's right.
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:29.480]  That's right.
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:55.480]  That's right.
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:40:21.480]  That's right.
[02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:47.480]  That's right.
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:41:13.480]  That's right.
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:39.480]  That's right.
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:42:05.480]  That's right.
[02:42:05.480 --> 02:42:31.480]  That's right.
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:57.480]  That's right.
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:23.480]  That's right.
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:49.480]  That's right.
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:44:15.480]  That's right.
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:41.480]  That's right.
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:45:07.480]  That's right.
[02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:33.480]  That's right.
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:59.480]  That's right.
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:25.480]  That's right.
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:51.480]  That's right.
