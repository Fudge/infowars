[00:00:04.855 --> 00:00:09.677]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:11.258]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.258 --> 00:00:12.198]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.198 --> 00:00:17.021]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:21.943]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:32.968]  For the last month, we have struggled
[00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:48.012]  To alert the public to the fact that nurses, police, medical workers, daycare workers, public school teachers are being fired, are being threatened with being fired.
[00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:51.693]  Both are happening if they do not take the regular seasonal flu shot.
[00:00:51.693 --> 00:00:54.593]  So they're setting the precedent to make that mandatory for everybody.
[00:00:54.593 --> 00:00:57.974]  And the new H1N1, those injections start next week.
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.422]  And now it's finally all over mainstream media going, oh yes, people are being fired, you have to take it.
[00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:09.223]  So Obama is a congenital liar as usual.
[00:01:09.223 --> 00:01:12.183]  Nothing he says is ever true.
[00:01:12.183 --> 00:01:13.684]  Just everything is a lie.
[00:01:13.684 --> 00:01:19.465]  But of course, he's a complete puppet working for the globalists that are bringing in world government.
[00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:28.268]  We have Annette Moak joining us, fired for not taking a flu shot in the third hour today.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.063]  And so that is coming up.
[00:01:32.063 --> 00:01:45.096]  We are also going to get into this report at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and I'm going to attempt, after the break, to calmly go over all the different facets of this.
[00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:48.359]  But this is a maximum alert.
[00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.104]  And I believe we've only put out a handful
[00:01:54.505 --> 00:01:59.287]  of what I call maximum alerts on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com over the years.
[00:01:59.287 --> 00:02:05.511]  This is a maximum alert.
[00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:07.412]  All the pieces of the puzzle are now in place.
[00:02:07.412 --> 00:02:09.132]  It is completely clear what's going on.
[00:02:09.132 --> 00:02:14.075]  And I want to speak directly to the military and police on this show today.
[00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:24.060]  Just in case some of you out there listening don't understand what you're part of, and just in case the public doesn't realize what's happening, I want to break it down for you.
[00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:28.203]  I want to break down the history of this and now what's currently happening.
[00:02:28.203 --> 00:02:31.064]  Here it is, Maximum Alert.
[00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:31.384]  U.S.
[00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:37.067]  troops now occupying America.
[00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:46.512]  And the spin that they are putting on this, we're going to go over that today as well.
[00:02:46.512 --> 00:02:49.734]  Also, finally, Time Magazine and the BBC and others
[00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:57.068]  Are admitting that the chemical cocktails and consumer products are destroying male fertility.
[00:02:57.068 --> 00:03:12.396]  How many medical doctors, how many endocrinologists that deal with the glands, how many medical scientists have we had on here, chemists, biologists, to explain to you that out of thousands of different plastic formula,
[00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:28.939]  In the 60s, globally, two different types of plastics were adopted for food and drink containment that leach high-powered gender-bending sterilants.
[00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:35.104]  Now, what did the White House science czar call for in the government textbook he wrote?
[00:03:35.104 --> 00:03:37.646]  A sterilant that leaches into the food and water.
[00:03:37.646 --> 00:03:39.187]  It's in your food and your water.
[00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:39.788]  It's a fact!
[00:03:40.677 --> 00:03:47.818]  And I want to just explain something to people out there that think the establishment's cute and fun and think that you're part of the establishment.
[00:03:47.818 --> 00:03:58.521]  I'll guarantee you, you didn't get a memo to not drink this stuff and not eat this stuff unless you're part of the super class that the head of the Kissinger Group, who we've interviewed, admits they're setting up a world government.
[00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:09.663]  There's only 6,000 super gophers, super elite legates, super elite individuals that hold power for less than 20 families.
[00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:21.901]  Now they get memos and they avoid all plastic, they avoid all GMO, they avoid all vaccines like the plague.
[00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:23.723]  Because it is a plague.
[00:04:23.723 --> 00:04:26.226]  So I'm going to go over that again for you today but I just
[00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:28.659]  I want to, again, reach out to people.
[00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:29.839]  This doesn't have to happen.
[00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.180]  We don't have to live like this.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:43.506]  If we just have an awakening outside of the controlled media paradigm, and just start making the choices not to drink this and not to eat this, we have a few years in the market system to reverse this.
[00:04:43.506 --> 00:04:49.629]  But soon, they're going to bankrupt the economy globally and consolidate it, that they're going to control everything.
[00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:53.591]  They're shutting down the farms and ranches right now, and we're not going to be able to escape this.
[00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:54.732]  They're killing us right now.
[00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:55.172]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:07.949]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:14.056]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:05:14.056 --> 00:05:16.680]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.287]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.287 --> 00:05:27.352]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:32.738]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.039]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.800]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.322]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:44.064]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:47.766]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.766 --> 00:05:50.888]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:50.888 --> 00:05:52.789]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.910]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:06:01.053 --> 00:06:06.777]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:06:06.777 --> 00:06:08.118]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:10.120]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:17.125]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:25.671]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:26.038 --> 00:06:33.143]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:36.306]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:36.306 --> 00:06:40.209]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was BOOM!
[00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:40.509]  BOOM!
[00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:40.829]  BOOM!
[00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:41.149]  BOOM!
[00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:42.090]  BOOM!
[00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.172]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:45.172 --> 00:06:51.217]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:06:51.217 --> 00:06:53.218]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:59.026]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:07:00.695 --> 00:07:09.779]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:19.684]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.
[00:07:19.684 --> 00:07:28.128]  AlkaZone's unique formula contains potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and the antioxidant selenium, along with 79 trace minerals from ancient marine deposits.

[00:07:54.214 --> 00:07:55.255]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:56.155]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:32.228 --> 00:08:35.890]  Okay, my friends, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:40.012]  Coming up in the third hour, we have a nurse who was fired for not taking the flu shot.
[00:08:40.012 --> 00:08:44.575]  It is now admitted that this is happening.
[00:08:44.575 --> 00:08:49.358]  And we're going to be breaking that down and covering it in detail.
[00:08:49.358 --> 00:08:51.939]  Our top story is a maximum alert.
[00:08:51.939 --> 00:08:52.259]  U.S.
[00:08:52.259 --> 00:08:54.741]  troops now occupying America.
[00:08:54.741 --> 00:09:00.724]  From Michigan to California, from Arizona to Texas, to Florida, to Iowa, to Ohio, to New York.
[00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:23.403]  The Massachusetts, regular Army troops, Marines, National Guard, they are all, they are all
[00:09:27.924 --> 00:09:35.567]  Running around the country being deployed in an acclimation operation.
[00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:40.409]  It doesn't matter if it's a county fair in the middle of nowhere in South Dakota.
[00:09:40.409 --> 00:09:44.291]  It doesn't matter if it's a small town in Arizona or a big city in Texas.
[00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:58.112]  It doesn't matter if it's an NFL football game, a college football game, a local football game, and this has been going on for several decades, but it's expanding, it's getting larger and larger.
[00:09:58.112 --> 00:10:06.054]  They have National Guard, State Guard, regular Army, Marines, come out and search people.
[00:10:06.054 --> 00:10:11.976]  Randomly at checkpoints, randomly going into the city center, randomly going into a high school football stadium.
[00:10:11.976 --> 00:10:16.118]  We have the photos, we have the videos, they're in my film, Martial Law, we put out in 2005.
[00:10:19.414 --> 00:10:25.837]  This is on record, and we would cover this and people would be in denial about it, saying that's not happening.
[00:10:25.837 --> 00:10:28.338]  It's posse comitatus violation.
[00:10:28.338 --> 00:10:33.980]  I videotaped in Police State 2000 and Police State 2, the takeover, and Police State 3, total enslavement.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:40.282]  Marines all over the country coming in, practicing taking over Hebron, Maryland.
[00:10:40.282 --> 00:10:43.564]  Practicing taking over Swansboro, North Carolina.
[00:10:43.564 --> 00:10:46.285]  Practicing taking over areas of
[00:10:47.365 --> 00:10:48.986]  Oakland, California.
[00:10:48.986 --> 00:10:54.149]  And I would go and videotape it, and the Marines would walk over and say, turn your camera off.
[00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:56.550]  You're not allowed to videotape us.
[00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:12.920]  And they would come up to other people that sent us footage in Maryland, and with guns, with the police, and say, in America, you can't videotape plainclothes Marines directing uniformed Marines and the Boy Scouts in, quote, hunting down militia members.
[00:11:15.023 --> 00:11:24.647]  Now it's admitted that they have the Boy Scouts working with them nationally, the Girl Scouts.
[00:11:24.647 --> 00:11:35.571]  And they've gone from maybe a hundred drills a year ten years ago, and that's just a guesstimation, to tens of thousands of drills.
[00:11:35.571 --> 00:11:36.832]  And now they're not drills.
[00:11:36.832 --> 00:11:40.493]  They'll just set up a checkpoint and start searching people.
[00:11:40.493 --> 00:11:42.174]  And they've done that with the Army and Marines.
[00:11:44.025 --> 00:11:46.666]  Remember three months ago we had the state representative on.
[00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:58.152]  The governor of Tennessee put out a statement saying we are not going to have Army and National Guard and Homeland Security and FBI and BATF and local police and state police out shutting down highways searching cars.
[00:11:59.048 --> 00:12:04.411]  And then for two weeks straight, the military went ahead and did it and just told the governor, shut up.
[00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:06.473]  They said, we're doing this under NORTHCOM.
[00:12:06.473 --> 00:12:10.615]  Because the John Warner Defense Authorization Act states we have authorization to do this.
[00:12:10.615 --> 00:12:14.998]  And the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, let there be no debating this.
[00:12:14.998 --> 00:12:23.143]  For any of you out there in denial, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act states that Homeland Security will set up NORTHCOM brigades
[00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:29.852]  To take control of the states from the governors and for civil insurrection.
[00:12:29.852 --> 00:12:33.339]  Army times a year ago said they're going to deploy one brigade.
[00:12:34.605 --> 00:12:36.646]  Then it was five brigades.
[00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:37.246]  Now it's 379,000 troops.
[00:12:37.246 --> 00:12:37.647]  So a brigade's 4,000.
[00:12:37.647 --> 00:12:38.347]  Divide that into 379,000.
[00:12:38.347 --> 00:12:40.068]  How many brigades is that?
[00:12:40.068 --> 00:12:41.109]  It's a lot of brigades.
[00:12:41.109 --> 00:12:42.449]  So it goes from 4,000 to 20,000 to 40,000 to 100,000 to 379,000.
[00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:43.690]  And ladies and gentlemen, they are deploying.
[00:12:57.987 --> 00:12:59.068]  They are deploying.
[00:12:59.068 --> 00:13:11.794]  You can read the press releases from the state police in Arizona, in Texas, in California, where they just announced that they've got the Army, they've got the Marine Corps, they've got the National Guard, they've got the State Guards.
[00:13:11.794 --> 00:13:13.935]  It's all being federalized.
[00:13:13.935 --> 00:13:21.798]  Armories that were empty are now being turned into threat fusion, threat integration centers with the local police, county police, state police, and the military.
[00:13:21.798 --> 00:13:24.740]  They're moving heavy armaments and light armaments into them.
[00:13:26.092 --> 00:13:29.633]  The military doesn't work for America anymore.
[00:13:29.633 --> 00:13:42.156]  It works for offshore banks that have bankrupt the country by design and are criminally bringing us into receivership and putting hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt, with interest, on every American.
[00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:47.097]  $23.7 trillion has been stolen in the first 10 months of the banker takeover, October 3rd.
[00:13:47.097 --> 00:13:49.698]  We haven't gotten numbers in a month and a half.
[00:13:49.698 --> 00:13:53.119]  It'll be over 28 trillion when the numbers come in, following the trend.
[00:13:53.859 --> 00:13:55.940]  28 Trill right now is gone.
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:56.520]  Confirmed?
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:56.881]  23.7.
[00:13:56.881 --> 00:14:13.989]  We have been completely and totally robbed and we could stand up and say this is illegal, this is criminal, we want to indict the Federal Reserve, we want to arrest them, we want to write off this fraudulent debt, triage it.
[00:14:13.989 --> 00:14:16.970]  That's not going to happen unless we have a mass awakening.
[00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.291]  You understand?
[00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:19.431]  They've written the white papers,
[00:14:21.803 --> 00:14:28.826]  Professor Barnett at the Navy War College brags that the military works for offshore corporations and the New World Order.
[00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:30.566]  I called him up to get him on the show.
[00:14:30.566 --> 00:14:31.306]  He canceled.
[00:14:31.306 --> 00:14:32.747]  I called him up and I said, why aren't you coming on?
[00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:33.947]  He goes, I found out who you are.
[00:14:33.947 --> 00:14:36.008]  And I said, look, your New World Order takeover is going to fail.
[00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:37.729]  You're not going to bring America down.
[00:14:37.729 --> 00:14:42.931]  He started laughing at me and he said, yeah, no, you're going to fail.
[00:14:42.931 --> 00:14:43.931]  You can't stop us.
[00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:47.892]  I mean, these people sit there on the phone saying you're not going to stop us.
[00:14:47.892 --> 00:14:49.453]  I mean, it's just so sick.
[00:14:51.024 --> 00:14:54.145]  I mean, they just sit there literally laughing and growling at me on the phone.
[00:14:54.145 --> 00:14:57.986]  It's so funny to them, because it's all about winning to these people.
[00:14:57.986 --> 00:15:01.447]  You think we can have a military that's half the military on the planet?
[00:15:01.447 --> 00:15:03.728]  More than half the military expenditure on the planet?
[00:15:03.728 --> 00:15:12.771]  You think they can go overthrow hundreds of third world countries, run black op, run child kidnapping rings, engage in every form of corruption and evil, and then
[00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:14.691]  We're good to go.
[00:15:37.816 --> 00:15:39.877]  Nineteen-year-old National Guard person.
[00:15:39.877 --> 00:15:51.041]  These guys are babies in these videos pouring in from Texas and Arizona and Kentucky and Iowa and Ohio and New York and everywhere else.
[00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:53.662]  The videos are just pouring in.
[00:15:53.662 --> 00:15:56.663]  Tennessee, these are babies they've got out there.
[00:15:58.459 --> 00:16:04.043]  They've trained the Marines and the Army in the battle-hardened Homeland Security Brigade System.
[00:16:04.043 --> 00:16:07.685]  Those are the most battle-hardened troops in the Army, according to Army Times.
[00:16:07.685 --> 00:16:10.547]  They're deployed now at the bases waiting.
[00:16:10.547 --> 00:16:18.693]  But they're now sending out and training baby-faced, just got in the National Guard, going to be rotating over into Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:16:18.693 --> 00:16:22.136]  They're going to come back, of course, with more checkpoint skills and be a little bit hardened.
[00:16:23.229 --> 00:16:35.896]  And you watch them in these videos from Kentucky and Tennessee and Arizona that have come in the last few days and they are there looking at citizens in the eyes, looking at their bags.
[00:16:35.896 --> 00:16:50.164]  We have other photos and videos of them searching people, stopping people in subways, demanding to look in women's purses, demanding to look in five-year-olds' backpacks, training Americans, this is normal, and training the troops, it's normal, and they're all carrying
[00:16:51.124 --> 00:16:56.206]  Forty-fives, Army-issued or Army-issued Beretta 9mm.
[00:16:56.206 --> 00:16:59.307]  They are locked and loaded.
[00:16:59.307 --> 00:17:03.908]  Even during regular riots, they don't normally arm the National Guard, locked and loaded.
[00:17:03.908 --> 00:17:11.231]  When they're on the border, for the thousand they sent down there for a show, and everybody was demanding the border be secured, and by the way, it hasn't been.
[00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:16.392]  They built like a hundred miles of the 2,000-mile fence, and illegal aliens were paid by Homeland Security to build it.
[00:17:16.392 --> 00:17:17.773]  I'm not kidding, that's on record, AP.
[00:17:19.363 --> 00:17:22.044]  They're not allowed to have bullets in their guns.
[00:17:22.044 --> 00:17:24.364]  They're not allowed to have live rounds.
[00:17:24.364 --> 00:17:25.464]  That's mainstream news.
[00:17:25.464 --> 00:17:27.145]  Just search that term.
[00:17:27.145 --> 00:17:29.165]  National Guard not allowed to be armed on border.
[00:17:29.165 --> 00:17:31.805]  They're allowed to carry their rifles but not have bullets.
[00:17:31.805 --> 00:17:35.886]  And when the Mexican troops shoot at them every week, they're told to run and they do run.
[00:17:35.886 --> 00:17:44.028]  But they're allowed to have sound cannons, microwave guns, now being deployed by county police in Orange County and other areas around the country, Orange County, California.
[00:17:45.051 --> 00:17:48.717]  They are now deploying against the American people with live ammo.
[00:17:48.717 --> 00:17:53.765]  With hot .223, and hot .45, and hot 9mm.
[00:17:53.765 --> 00:17:56.009]  They're now deploying with LRAD sound cannons.
[00:17:56.009 --> 00:17:58.132]  They're now deploying with microwave guns.
[00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:02.932]  It's in the local news, they're rolling it out at the tea parties.
[00:18:02.932 --> 00:18:05.753]  The whole homeland security system is for the American people.
[00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:16.557]  Now I've gotten a few emails from National Guardmen and I've seen their comments on our stories going, hey, we're just told to help out the community, the police are overstretched, you just don't like the military.
[00:18:16.557 --> 00:18:19.598]  Let me explain something to you, fool.
[00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:23.579]  They shoot you up with genetically engineered cocktails and adjuvant
[00:18:24.932 --> 00:18:27.676]  Vaccines that have killed a bunch of you deader than a hammer.
[00:18:27.676 --> 00:18:32.122]  They've done chemical and biological and radiological testing on you under Project Shad and other programs.
[00:18:32.122 --> 00:18:32.923]  Go look it up.
[00:18:32.923 --> 00:18:38.652]  And they've killed you to test higher-up military doctors to make sure they'll follow orders.
[00:18:38.652 --> 00:18:40.494]  And that's all you're being tested for right now.
[00:18:41.414 --> 00:18:51.178]  Now in the first deployments, and they've been phasing these in over 20 years that we know of, well since 1988, so that's 20 years, 21 years, hard to believe, but 10 years hot and heavy.
[00:18:51.178 --> 00:18:56.021]  The first time they put you out as directing traffic just to acclimate you that it's normal, and to acclimate the citizens.
[00:18:56.021 --> 00:18:59.822]  The next time they have you search a few bags, randomly.
[00:18:59.822 --> 00:19:04.304]  The next time they have you go out and start setting up checkpoints with police searching cars.
[00:19:04.304 --> 00:19:07.826]  Next they have you out taking blood at DWI checkpoints without warrants.
[00:19:08.795 --> 00:19:14.600]  You are being prepared to go to war against America and engage in high treason.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.421]  Do not destroy your sacred honor.
[00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:18.903]  Do not destroy your family name.
[00:19:18.903 --> 00:19:20.405]  Do not be part of this, fools.
[00:19:22.014 --> 00:19:27.176]  Refuse these criminal, treasonous, illegal orders to deploy on the streets of America.
[00:19:27.176 --> 00:19:33.759]  I'm going to continue breaking this down with the history of it, how they operate, and I want to explain to people.
[00:19:33.759 --> 00:19:40.261]  They do this incrementally, so people like me sit here warning you, and they incrementally roll it out until you get acclimated.
[00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:50.045]  But I'm telling you, this is a more than, I'd say 50 or more, 50 times increase in the amount of deployment.
[00:19:51.198 --> 00:19:52.278]  It's all happening.
[00:19:52.278 --> 00:19:54.619]  They are going to a whole new level.
[00:19:54.619 --> 00:20:00.362]  It's like an enemy army lining up on your border.
[00:20:00.362 --> 00:20:02.323]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:20:02.323 --> 00:20:04.824]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:20:05.825 --> 00:20:19.274]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to Fluscam.com and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and the vaccine poisons.
[00:20:19.274 --> 00:20:30.862]  Learn why Barack Obama's ScienceR recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce populations, and why OxySilver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:20:31.642 --> 00:20:34.744]  OxySilver is far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:20:34.744 --> 00:20:38.826]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting you and your family.
[00:20:38.826 --> 00:20:42.608]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:48.171]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[00:20:48.171 --> 00:20:51.312]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[00:20:51.312 --> 00:20:54.274]  Call toll-free 888-KO-GERMS.
[00:20:54.274 --> 00:20:56.935]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:20:56.935 --> 00:20:58.416]  Order OxySilver today.
[00:20:58.416 --> 00:20:59.677]  This call could save your life.
[00:21:00.305 --> 00:21:02.326]  There are many guarantees in this world.
[00:21:02.326 --> 00:21:05.887]  The closest I can come to a guarantee is that the dollar is going to zero.
[00:21:05.887 --> 00:21:13.431]  During the great hyperinflation in Weimar, Germany, people who had worked all their lives and invested conservatively were wiped out, reduced to poverty.
[00:21:13.431 --> 00:21:16.252]  There are many parallels between the Weimar and the U.S.
[00:21:16.252 --> 00:21:16.752]  today.
[00:21:16.752 --> 00:21:17.632]  I'll send you a list.
[00:21:17.632 --> 00:21:26.676]  There are ways to protect yourself from hyperinflation, gold and silver, and legal and constitutional ways to avoid confiscation, which is becoming highly probable.
[00:21:26.676 --> 00:21:28.777]  I'm Bob Moss with Midas Resources.
[00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:34.219]  Many of the people I talked to today are aware of trouble coming, but haven't taken action to protect themselves.
[00:21:34.219 --> 00:21:39.280]  There is, in fact, a financial tsunami coming, and it could fall upon us quickly with little warning.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.181]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:41.101]  Protect yourself.
[00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:43.182]  Call me today, Bob Moss, at 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[00:21:47.563 --> 00:21:54.085]  That's Bob Moss, Midas Resources, 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[00:21:54.085 --> 00:21:59.367]  Again, that's Bob Moss, 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[00:21:59.367 --> 00:22:04.389]  It's here.
[00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:09.530]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:17.153]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:25.322]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:22:25.322 --> 00:22:28.647]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:31.392]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:22:31.392 --> 00:22:32.193]  NSA spies.
[00:22:32.702 --> 00:22:37.043]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:22:37.043 --> 00:22:41.004]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:22:41.004 --> 00:22:43.264]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:22:43.264 --> 00:22:47.705]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:24:02.136 --> 00:24:05.877]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:05.877 --> 00:24:06.417]  to 3 p.m.
[00:24:06.417 --> 00:24:09.938]  Central, we're here defending what's left of this republic.
[00:24:09.938 --> 00:24:11.759]  This is America's last stand.
[00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:17.220]  Make no mistake, we're being completely economically and militarily dominated right now.
[00:24:18.683 --> 00:24:28.612]  You are all going to lose your standard of living by at least 50% in the next few years if we don't let the bankers know that we are repulsing their attack on us.
[00:24:28.612 --> 00:24:30.653]  We have got to indict these people.
[00:24:30.653 --> 00:24:32.935]  We've got to have state grand juries go after them.
[00:24:32.935 --> 00:24:36.118]  They're all a bunch of criminal made-offs.
[00:24:36.118 --> 00:24:36.679]  Bernanke,
[00:24:38.385 --> 00:24:44.007]  Rubin, Greenspan, Paulson, all of these people are criminals.
[00:24:44.007 --> 00:24:49.750]  But because they've stolen so many trillions of dollars, everybody bows down to them like they're God.
[00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:57.873]  Now, they have set up NORTHCOM under the pretext of 9-11, but Bill Clinton gave speeches about NORTHCOM in 1993.
[00:24:57.873 --> 00:25:00.734]  They always planned this.
[00:25:00.734 --> 00:25:02.355]  And this is for the American people.
[00:25:02.355 --> 00:25:05.676]  I have interviewed Marine Corps officers who in 1988 were
[00:25:08.613 --> 00:25:13.077]  Rating gun shops with police in police uniforms.
[00:25:13.077 --> 00:25:14.659]  Since then, that's been declassified.
[00:25:14.659 --> 00:25:17.722]  But it wasn't declassified in 2002 when I put it in Road to Tyranny.
[00:25:17.722 --> 00:25:20.064]  9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:25:20.064 --> 00:25:22.487]  Do you understand what is going on here?
[00:25:24.571 --> 00:25:32.433]  Do you understand they're passing laws for police to go in people's homes for gun confiscation nationwide and doing what they call knock and talk?
[00:25:32.433 --> 00:25:38.455]  Do you understand under the flu guys they're passing laws across the country to come in your home for quarantines without a warrant?
[00:25:38.455 --> 00:25:43.437]  Do you understand across the nation states are passing laws to take your blood at checkpoints without warrants?
[00:25:43.437 --> 00:25:45.277]  It's already happened in Texas.
[00:25:45.277 --> 00:25:47.678]  Do you understand that this is real?
[00:25:50.484 --> 00:25:55.849]  You understand, on record, they've trained with 13 Latin American nations to occupy the U.S.
[00:25:55.849 --> 00:26:03.356]  this year, on record, and under NLE09, with troops from 14 European nations.
[00:26:03.356 --> 00:26:10.563]  Israel, France, Germany, the Netherlands, England, Scotland, Ukraine, Czech Republic.
[00:26:10.563 --> 00:26:16.008]  It is off the charts, but the average person is concerned about their stupid football team winning.
[00:26:17.298 --> 00:26:18.899]  Do you like being slaves?
[00:26:18.899 --> 00:26:20.860]  Do you want secret police on every corner?
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.042]  Do you want to be searched every day when you go in the shopping mall or grocery store?
[00:26:24.042 --> 00:26:27.425]  The FBI announced three years ago they want metal detectors everywhere!
[00:26:27.425 --> 00:26:28.285]  Body scanners!
[00:26:28.285 --> 00:26:30.587]  England already has mobile body scanner units.
[00:26:30.587 --> 00:26:35.810]  They're putting body scanners in in the Houston airport and directing people through them.
[00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:41.654]  They put thumb scanners and face scanners in to get into SeaWorld and to get into Disney World.
[00:26:41.654 --> 00:26:42.555]  Total control!
[00:26:43.834 --> 00:26:53.900]  Thousands of public schools make you thumb scan to get your lunch, thumb scan biometrically to get into tanning salons, gyms, libraries, total cashless grids going in.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:27:04.267]  Google admits they're using the cameras and microphones on computers to watch and listen to you with AI computers recording every word you say, and then transcribing it for NSA echelon scanning.
[00:27:04.267 --> 00:27:06.128]  InfoPoll9.
[00:27:06.128 --> 00:27:09.510]  Everything I'm saying's got the NSA meters going off the charts right now.
[00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.871]  All of these key code words, check them out!
[00:27:11.871 --> 00:27:12.452]  Red level!
[00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.931]  These people mean business!
[00:27:14.931 --> 00:27:21.716]  BBC, AP, Reuters admitting, oh my goodness, the plastics we've all been drinking from for decades are sterilizing every wine.
[00:27:21.716 --> 00:27:26.159]  When I have the government documents that they standardized and had companies go with that type in 1964!
[00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:31.183]  They're poisoning us!
[00:27:31.183 --> 00:27:34.185]  They're poisoning the cops and the military that are carrying this out!
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:43.763]  I'm going to open the phones up and I'm only taking calls because we can't have the phones getting filled up with other people because I want you to be able to get through.
[00:27:43.763 --> 00:27:54.747]  By active duty National Guard, military, Army, Marine Corps, officers, former military, about the checkpoints, the military checkpoints you're seeing.
[00:27:54.747 --> 00:27:56.308]  I have listeners emailing me.
[00:27:58.078 --> 00:28:02.684]  Scores of articles per hour so fast I can't even read them.
[00:28:02.684 --> 00:28:10.635]  We're being sent so many videos of Army, Marine Corps, and National Guard checkpoints across the nation that I can't even read it.
[00:28:10.635 --> 00:28:12.437]  It's shooting out of the printer.
[00:28:13.138 --> 00:28:36.551]  Jaron, during the break, printed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 articles out of Pittsburgh alone of 2,500 troops, National Guard, Regular Army, searching people, setting up checkpoints in Pittsburgh right now for the G20.
[00:28:36.551 --> 00:28:38.992]  They are doing this everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:38.992 --> 00:28:42.054]  This is full acclimation, so when they really drop the hammer on you,
[00:28:43.453 --> 00:28:46.114]  And on us, the public and the locals will go along with it.
[00:28:46.114 --> 00:28:56.219]  Remember Thomas Sanchez in 1999 dealt a force quietly with the police department, not even telling the city council, leased the old police department building.
[00:28:56.219 --> 00:29:01.401]  The day after the police moved out, they went in, blew it up and burned it down as a psych warfare test.
[00:29:01.401 --> 00:29:05.323]  And Thomas Sanchez came on this show.
[00:29:05.323 --> 00:29:06.764]  And of all places, he went on the 700 Club as well.
[00:29:09.483 --> 00:29:17.650]  And said, I was in Army Intelligence, and they came to me and said, we want you to be part of a PDD-25 martial law scenario.
[00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.632]  This is an acclimation test.
[00:29:19.632 --> 00:29:25.297]  They had Army psych warfare chiefs on the ground videotaping the neighborhood where they launched the attack.
[00:29:25.297 --> 00:29:28.300]  That's just one of thousands of ops.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.462]  God help us.
[00:29:30.462 --> 00:29:31.063]  Look at this.
[00:29:31.063 --> 00:29:35.647]  MAAC organizes Pittsburgh security for G20 National Guard on the ground.
[00:29:37.273 --> 00:29:40.755]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be right back with all of this and a lot more.
[00:29:40.755 --> 00:29:43.357]  Dr. Stan Monteith coming up today.
[00:29:43.357 --> 00:29:46.639]  Let's try to get Stuart Rhodes to pop in for 10 minutes about this from Oath Keepers.
[00:29:46.639 --> 00:29:50.942]  They've been demonized by the Southern Poverty Law Center as terrorists for saying they'll follow their oath.
[00:29:50.942 --> 00:29:52.343]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.343 --> 00:29:54.865]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.865 --> 00:29:57.547]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.831 --> 00:30:03.853]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.853 --> 00:30:09.177]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.177 --> 00:30:11.219]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.219 --> 00:30:16.222]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.222 --> 00:30:17.143]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.403 --> 00:30:18.524]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.524 --> 00:30:20.405]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.405 --> 00:30:21.486]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:23.688]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:25.029]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:26.550]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:31.834]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.834 --> 00:30:35.416]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:39.239]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.239 --> 00:30:40.460]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.361]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.361 --> 00:30:42.462]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.462 --> 00:30:43.402]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.402 --> 00:30:44.223]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.483 --> 00:30:47.524]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.524 --> 00:30:49.625]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:49.625 --> 00:30:55.067]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:55.067 --> 00:30:57.568]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:57.568 --> 00:31:06.972]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:06.972 --> 00:31:13.955]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.545 --> 00:31:21.129]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:23.110]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.611]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.611 --> 00:31:36.577]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.199 --> 00:31:38.860]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.700]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:47.623]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.623 --> 00:31:55.885]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.885 --> 00:31:57.446]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.446 --> 00:32:00.707]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.707 --> 00:32:03.628]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:12.361]  Power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:32:12.361 --> 00:32:16.983]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:32:16.983 --> 00:32:23.146]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:32:23.146 --> 00:32:26.668]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:32:26.668 --> 00:32:31.350]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.011]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms,
[00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:37.752]  Brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:32:37.752 --> 00:32:40.133]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:32:40.133 --> 00:32:43.373]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:32:43.373 --> 00:32:47.915]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:32:47.915 --> 00:32:50.155]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:32:50.155 --> 00:32:50.315]  877-327-0365.
[00:32:50.315 --> 00:32:50.555]  Don't wait.
[00:32:50.555 --> 00:32:51.015]  Call today.
[00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:07.110]  Nobody knew where John had come from.
[00:33:32.802 --> 00:33:33.702]  Big John!
[00:34:02.148 --> 00:34:04.949]  Big John!
[00:34:04.949 --> 00:34:07.811]  Big Bad John!
[00:34:07.811 --> 00:34:10.992]  Big John!
[00:34:10.992 --> 00:34:16.855]  Then came the day at the bottom of the mine when a timber cracked and men started crying.
[00:34:16.855 --> 00:34:19.476]  Miners were praying and hearts beat fast.
[00:34:19.476 --> 00:34:22.558]  Everybody thought that they'd breathed their last except John.
[00:34:24.724 --> 00:34:25.985]  Alright, we are back live.
[00:34:50.572 --> 00:34:51.393]  Ladies and gentlemen...
[00:35:10.698 --> 00:35:17.320]  Words cannot describe how serious our peril is, how real and tangible this criminal takeover is.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.881]  Do you know how Hitler was able to take over France?
[00:35:20.881 --> 00:35:35.005]  They always talk about how he hit a blitzkrieg around the Maginot Line and how he defeated the French in just a couple weeks and the British evacuated it, Dunkirk, and then Hitler allowed them to leave.
[00:35:38.257 --> 00:35:44.159]  Hitler had made deals with the high command of the French military.
[00:35:44.159 --> 00:35:49.700]  That's why they're called the Vichy French, out of the town of Vichy.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:57.782]  They made a deal to stand down, and so over 80% of the French military stood down.
[00:35:57.782 --> 00:36:07.245]  And that's how the corporate takeover happened, and the Nazis then gave control to the Nazi sympathizers, the Vichy, to run France.
[00:36:08.991 --> 00:36:10.953]  And that is the story of what happened there.
[00:36:10.953 --> 00:36:12.194]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:36:12.194 --> 00:36:19.800]  Foreign corporations, the Fortune 100, of the 100 biggest economies, more than 50 are corporations, not countries.
[00:36:21.869 --> 00:36:37.193]  went in and covertly bought off our military, our police, our government, our Congress, predominantly, under the guise of national security, the National Security Council, have now set up NORTHCOM as the military governorship of the United States.
[00:36:37.193 --> 00:36:40.634]  Just like Iraq is a puppet state run by the globalists via the U.S.
[00:36:40.634 --> 00:36:45.755]  military, and they have a puppet government that if it doesn't do what it's told, gets killed, gets overthrown.
[00:36:46.991 --> 00:36:57.378]  And they tell us on the news that Mohammed Karzai isn't a puppet in Afghanistan and that the president of Iraq isn't a puppet.
[00:36:57.378 --> 00:36:59.360]  If you believe that, I got a bridge.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.861]  I'll be happy to sell you.
[00:37:00.861 --> 00:37:13.149]  I've got some oceanfront property in Arizona and from my front porch you can see the sea, as George Strait would say.
[00:37:13.149 --> 00:37:15.151]  And all over the nation,
[00:37:16.181 --> 00:37:26.285]  The Marines, the Army, the National Guard, the State Guards have been federally funded to run checkpoints all over the nation to acclimate the public.
[00:37:26.285 --> 00:37:27.245]  And this is on record.
[00:37:27.245 --> 00:37:37.149]  And Homeland Security has announced that the 379,000 troops that they're going to phase in, deployed in every town and city in America, Pentagon's own words, say even small towns,
[00:37:39.636 --> 00:37:51.581]  This is all being done, according to the Homeland Security reports that we broke, to quote, deal with American gun owners, anti-Federal Reserve activists, and the Tea Parties.
[00:37:51.581 --> 00:37:56.164]  And there have been National Guard and Army Intelligence and Regular Army.
[00:37:56.164 --> 00:37:59.045]  We broke this months before it came out in the Baltimore Sun.
[00:38:01.056 --> 00:38:08.640]  Regular Army is spying and watching and surveilling in plain clothes all the tea parties, all the in the Fed rallies.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:20.326]  Ron Paul, when he goes and gives a speech in Houston or in Lake Jackson, it's on record, the Army documents are public, the Army is there watching him.
[00:38:20.326 --> 00:38:22.687]  That's treason!
[00:38:22.687 --> 00:38:27.170]  And Ed in California called in, it says vet that disagrees, but then hung up.
[00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.610]  Hey Ed,
[00:38:29.687 --> 00:38:30.488]  You disagree?
[00:38:30.488 --> 00:38:31.908]  Call up and tell me I'm wrong.
[00:38:31.908 --> 00:38:36.731]  Call up and tell me I'm an anti-John Wayne, anti-American person.
[00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:41.634]  Because I don't like the Army spying on myself and Ron Paul and others.
[00:38:41.634 --> 00:38:44.997]  Go ahead and tell me, Ed, everything's fine.
[00:38:44.997 --> 00:38:46.297]  Go ahead and laugh at me, Ed.
[00:38:46.297 --> 00:38:48.879]  Go ahead and tell me there's no such thing as a New World Order.
[00:38:48.879 --> 00:38:50.360]  Tell me whatever it is you're going to tell me.
[00:38:53.251 --> 00:38:53.491]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:38:53.491 --> 00:39:03.037]  We're going to go to Jim, Yvette, Dan, and Mass, security officer, and others.
[00:39:03.037 --> 00:39:11.923]  Speaking of Mass, though, before I break all this down in detail, I want everybody to listen very carefully and check out every claim I make, because it's all on the record.
[00:39:11.923 --> 00:39:15.585]  No more time for denial here than what I think should be done about all this.
[00:39:15.585 --> 00:39:21.609]  Let's just play Judge Napolitano, the one good person on Fox, that's why they just have him as a contributor.
[00:39:22.944 --> 00:39:25.326]  Who'll tell you like it is.
[00:39:25.326 --> 00:39:27.167]  He was against the Patriot Act when Bush was in.
[00:39:27.167 --> 00:39:29.049]  He's against it now when Obama's in.
[00:39:29.049 --> 00:39:30.870]  The only good person on Fox.
[00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:31.751]  We've had him on the show.
[00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:33.932]  I've been on his internet show.
[00:39:33.932 --> 00:39:37.074]  Internet Fox TV show.
[00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:39.256]  Only once, though, before they came down on him.
[00:39:39.256 --> 00:39:43.900]  Here he is telling you about the law on the governor's desk now in Massachusetts.
[00:39:44.844 --> 00:39:46.384]  To come into your house without warrants.
[00:39:46.384 --> 00:40:02.509]  And remember, now they're saying without warrants the feds are federalizing local police to give you $100,000 fine the first infraction via our regulation, a $15 million fine the second for selling any recalled product of tens of thousands.
[00:40:02.509 --> 00:40:06.671]  As if anybody knows what's been recalled and what hadn't been recalled.
[00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:07.751]  No warrant, no nothing.
[00:40:08.877 --> 00:40:10.358]  And they arrest you.
[00:40:10.358 --> 00:40:13.220]  It's all about warrantless searches.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.320]  Knock and talk.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.762]  From Illinois to Texas.
[00:40:16.762 --> 00:40:19.544]  In Dallas, they come to your door and say, mind if I come in and see your guns?
[00:40:19.544 --> 00:40:20.985]  In upscale neighborhoods.
[00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:23.686]  And the Dallas Morning News reports it like it's a good thing.
[00:40:23.686 --> 00:40:24.407]  They do it everywhere.
[00:40:26.135 --> 00:40:44.692]  All over the nation, I see reports every day of, oh, three or four or five army liaison officers from the regular army, from Homeland Security, have been given as a federal grant to the Spokane, Washington, and they go through the list of the towns, police department.
[00:40:44.692 --> 00:40:48.275]  And they're going to be assigned to the police intelligence office.
[00:40:49.403 --> 00:40:50.746]  Looking for local threats.
[00:40:50.746 --> 00:40:54.052]  Yes, army spies in the police department.
[00:40:54.052 --> 00:40:55.394]  Totally criminal.
[00:40:55.394 --> 00:40:57.759]  Totally anti-American.
[00:40:57.759 --> 00:41:01.485]  And again, they told you all of this was for Al Qaeda, but now they admit it's for you, the gun owners.
[00:41:02.691 --> 00:41:06.414]  And they've got bills introduced to basically ban any firearm they want when they want.
[00:41:06.414 --> 00:41:13.779]  Just dictatorial power to be given to John P. Holdren, who argued as a Justice Department lawyer a year and a half ago in the D.C.
[00:41:13.779 --> 00:41:19.304]  Heller case for a complete gun ban nationwide, saying there is no individual right to keep and bear arms.
[00:41:20.731 --> 00:41:23.413]  And then we say, hey, we don't want you to be able to pass that law.
[00:41:23.413 --> 00:41:25.654]  And they say, we don't want your guns.
[00:41:25.654 --> 00:41:27.696]  The same military tactic.
[00:41:27.696 --> 00:41:29.117]  You ever seen Mars Attacks?
[00:41:29.117 --> 00:41:31.158]  Funny comedy movie.
[00:41:31.158 --> 00:41:37.282]  When the aliens are running around shooting people, they broadcast on loudspeakers, don't run, we are your friends.
[00:41:37.282 --> 00:41:40.784]  And the people come out and put their hands up and the aliens shoot them.
[00:41:40.784 --> 00:41:44.587]  See, the director of that movie is throwing in your face a favorite military tactic.
[00:41:46.445 --> 00:41:56.910]  From World War One and on, they will broadcast over loudspeakers, the war is over, we are your friends, come out with your hands up, and they mow you down when you do it.
[00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:59.492]  And these average military men are being acclimated.
[00:41:59.492 --> 00:42:02.533]  These military women are being acclimated.
[00:42:02.533 --> 00:42:06.895]  Their first sent-outs, they think it's normal, and they say, oh, we're just going to have a local college football game.
[00:42:06.895 --> 00:42:09.697]  Go run traffic in the parking lot.
[00:42:09.697 --> 00:42:11.178]  Go volunteer to help your community.
[00:42:11.178 --> 00:42:13.359]  The police are overstrapped, and then we see the mayor of
[00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:18.492]  Birmingham, Alabama, the mayor of Schenectady, New York.
[00:42:18.492 --> 00:42:21.714]  Scores of other towns and cities announcing, oh, we've got a police shortage.
[00:42:21.714 --> 00:42:23.914]  They've only tripled the police the last few years.
[00:42:23.914 --> 00:42:26.495]  Now the city's on the unfunded mandates.
[00:42:26.495 --> 00:42:29.356]  The feds only pay for about 10% of it, can't pay for it.
[00:42:29.356 --> 00:42:33.078]  And so they go, oh, we'll just lay off cops and bring the army in.
[00:42:33.078 --> 00:42:34.798]  That's in the news.
[00:42:34.798 --> 00:42:35.799]  And then I get emails
[00:42:36.877 --> 00:42:40.380]  And see comments on InfoWars from people going, I'm in the army.
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.182]  Yeah, we go out and help the community at checkpoints.
[00:42:43.182 --> 00:42:46.024]  Yeah, we're going out and helping look for drunk drivers.
[00:42:46.024 --> 00:42:48.705]  What, are you for drunk drivers, Alex?
[00:42:48.705 --> 00:42:51.147]  You're being acclimated, sir.
[00:42:51.147 --> 00:42:54.049]  They do that so that it sounds reasonable.
[00:42:54.049 --> 00:42:56.931]  Oh, I'm just helping at a checkpoint stop drunk drivers.
[00:42:56.931 --> 00:43:04.677]  And I told you two years ago when they started announcing this, when Northcom announced it, I said that we would then have these arguments of them going, well, we're stopping drunks.
[00:43:05.765 --> 00:43:16.950]  Well, the Army's doing star flight, medevac, the local town doesn't have enough helicopters, so when a child's stuck in a car, we come with the jaws of life and get him out.
[00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.671]  Do you like being played like a fool?
[00:43:18.671 --> 00:43:22.493]  Do you like buying propaganda hook, line, and sinker?
[00:43:22.493 --> 00:43:25.714]  Our military doesn't belong to us anymore.
[00:43:25.714 --> 00:43:29.896]  Our country's been seized criminally in a corporate hostile takeover by offshore banks.
[00:43:31.411 --> 00:43:34.412]  But here's Judge Napolitano telling you like it is.
[00:43:34.412 --> 00:43:36.753]  Everywhere they use different pretexts.
[00:43:36.753 --> 00:43:57.763]  Drunk driving, the flu, dangerous toys for children and products being sold at flea markets and garage sales, and oh, the Amish can't sell eggs on the street corner because the eggs might be poisonous, and they can't sell cheese, and they can't sell watermelons, and they won't vaccinate their kids so the CPS have to take hundreds of their kids a month that we know of in Illinois and Ohio.
[00:43:58.383 --> 00:44:03.527]  And the government's just doing all this, and we have to take your blood at checkpoints without warrants to stop drunk drivers.
[00:44:03.527 --> 00:44:05.088]  Well, why didn't we do it before?
[00:44:05.088 --> 00:44:07.330]  Because there's a Fourth Amendment.
[00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.152]  This is total takeover.
[00:44:10.152 --> 00:44:11.773]  You are the target.
[00:44:11.773 --> 00:44:18.198]  Living in your $300,000 house, driving your $25,000 Tahoe, with a swimming pool in the backyard.
[00:44:18.198 --> 00:44:19.639]  You're going to be made a slave.
[00:44:19.639 --> 00:44:26.745]  The only jobs in the economy are going to be surveillance, checkpoints, prisons, camera operators, and working in the factories that make them.
[00:44:28.148 --> 00:44:29.771]  They're converting the whole economy.
[00:44:29.771 --> 00:44:31.334]  They write white papers on it.
[00:44:31.334 --> 00:44:32.236]  They brag.
[00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:36.384]  A handful of global corporations are going to re-engineer the economy.
[00:44:36.384 --> 00:44:37.546]  Here's Judge Napolitano.
[00:44:39.687 --> 00:44:43.150]  The N1 virus has made thousands of people across the country sick.
[00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:44.351]  Many have died.
[00:44:44.351 --> 00:44:48.115]  And some worry that it could grow into a full-blown pandemic.
[00:44:48.115 --> 00:44:53.740]  Well, one state, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is preparing for that with a very controversial bill.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:45:03.829]  Massachusetts proposing legislation that would allow police to forcefully quarantine residents and even impose martial law without a warrant.
[00:45:04.878 --> 00:45:06.821]  Could that possibly be constitutional?
[00:45:06.821 --> 00:45:11.067]  We've called in Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[00:45:11.067 --> 00:45:11.808]  Hey, Steve.
[00:45:11.808 --> 00:45:19.598]  So, because apparently they're worried that swine flu is a public safety issue, they're talking about a law where the police can...
[00:45:20.239 --> 00:45:26.061]  Knock on your door, or not necessarily knock on your door, just go in and essentially quarantine you.
[00:45:26.061 --> 00:45:27.781]  Well, they're doing more than talking about a law.
[00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:38.104]  The state of Massachusetts, both houses of the legislature have enacted this law and once Governor Deval Patrick signs it and he says that he will, it'll become the law and it will allow
[00:45:38.524 --> 00:45:51.230]  For him to declare an emergency, and once he declares an emergency, he can authorize non-healthcare licensed personnel, read that to mean police, to vaccinate people against their will.
[00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.831]  Now, can they force adults to take vaccination?
[00:45:53.831 --> 00:45:54.452]  No.
[00:45:54.452 --> 00:46:02.035]  They will incarcerate adults without a trial, without charges, without even a search warrant, who refuse to be vaccinated.
[00:46:02.035 --> 00:46:03.796]  This is what the statute authorizes.
[00:46:03.796 --> 00:46:05.517]  The statute also authorizes the police
[00:46:08.138 --> 00:46:14.646]  To remove children from adults, vaccinate them against the will of the child and the will of the parents.
[00:46:14.646 --> 00:46:16.568]  This is so troubling on so many different levels.
[00:46:16.568 --> 00:46:26.900]  I mean, first of all, you think, wait a minute, they've got a great big list with everybody who got a flu shot's name on it, and are they going to just have neighbors turn into other neighbors?
[00:46:28.562 --> 00:46:28.842]  You're sick!
[00:46:28.842 --> 00:46:30.584]  You haven't gotten a shot!
[00:46:58.342 --> 00:47:05.448]  Man, the first time, if this were to happen, and the first time some cop goes in and gives some kid a shot, it's going to hit the fan.
[00:47:05.448 --> 00:47:11.453]  Yes, it will, and the state of Massachusetts will be sorry it enacted this, because people will revolt against it.
[00:47:11.453 --> 00:47:13.375]  Alright, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[00:47:13.375 --> 00:47:19.080]  Alright, under the executive order signed by Bush, expanded by Obama, it allows all of this.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.741]  It's totally criminal.
[00:47:20.741 --> 00:47:23.984]  They had executive orders about forced sterilizing Americans under eugenics.
[00:47:25.384 --> 00:47:26.984]  They had laws that blacks weren't human.
[00:47:26.984 --> 00:47:28.165]  It's all a fraud.
[00:47:28.165 --> 00:47:33.686]  Does a black man, chained up as a slave, pulling a plow, have a right to say, I'm a human being, I'm not a slave, and fight back?
[00:47:33.686 --> 00:47:34.546]  Yes, he does.
[00:47:34.546 --> 00:47:38.227]  Even if the law says he doesn't have a right.
[00:47:38.227 --> 00:47:42.248]  Now, this is probably all just a big martial law drill.
[00:47:42.248 --> 00:47:51.310]  They're gonna do forced inoculations, they're making nurses and others do it, they're gonna try to set the precedent, and then a year or two later, it'll be a bigger operation, and bigger and bigger.
[00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:54.751]  It's all a process, because they know it's very hard to beat in criminalism.
[00:47:55.171 --> 00:48:02.878]  Jim is a vet in Illinois, Dan a mass security officer, Juan a New York health care worker, Lori in Texas just saw Homeland Security buses.
[00:48:02.878 --> 00:48:06.001]  Yeah, we see Homeland Security armored vehicles here in Austin now.
[00:48:06.001 --> 00:48:06.802]  White ones.
[00:48:06.802 --> 00:48:10.745]  Little armored trucks, big Homeland Security buses.
[00:48:10.745 --> 00:48:13.268]  They took over the old Highland Mall that shut down.
[00:48:13.268 --> 00:48:18.092]  I tell the idiot public this and they email me laughing at me even though it's right down there in Highland Mall.
[00:48:18.092 --> 00:48:19.814]  It's just all very funny to you, isn't it?
[00:48:20.828 --> 00:48:30.014]  It's all very funny, and Obama's saying you don't have to take the shots, but then meanwhile they're forcing everybody and getting ready for it.
[00:48:30.014 --> 00:48:31.295]  Let's talk to Jim.
[00:48:31.295 --> 00:48:32.035]  Jim, go ahead.
[00:48:32.035 --> 00:48:48.566]  Alex, I saw that piece we are changing on the Ohio National Guard, and I want to suggest that maybe they get the picture of Mary Ann Vecchio kneeling over the dead body of Jeffrey Miller, taken May 4th, 1970, when the Ohio National Guard fired on peaceful students at Kent State, you know, so they could be reminded
[00:48:49.258 --> 00:48:51.379]  You know, of what happens when we have a policy flaw.
[00:48:51.379 --> 00:48:52.640]  See, the Feds learned.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:49:00.745]  They're going to stage their own Kent States where they're going to have their own people shoot police who won't even know.
[00:49:00.745 --> 00:49:02.005]  They'll disappear into the crowd.
[00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:03.506]  They've been caught doing this all over the world.
[00:49:03.506 --> 00:49:06.828]  And then they're going to mow everybody down and just start slaughtering everybody with pleasure.
[00:49:06.828 --> 00:49:09.189]  No, of course, agent provocateurs, yes.
[00:49:09.189 --> 00:49:14.272]  But now you keep saying that the answer is 1984, 1776.
[00:49:14.272 --> 00:49:16.654]  And I'd like to elaborate a little bit on that if I could.
[00:49:16.654 --> 00:49:18.014]  Sure.
[00:49:18.014 --> 00:49:18.995]  If I could read something here.
[00:49:20.074 --> 00:49:43.293]  Though governments can originally have no other rides than that before mention, nor policies be founded on anything but the consent of the people, yet such have been the disorders their ambition has filled the world with, that in the noise of war, which makes so great a part of the history of mankind, this consent is little taken notice of, and therefore many have mistaken the force of arms for the consent of the people, and reckon conquest as one of the originals of government.
[00:49:43.293 --> 00:49:48.097]  But conquest is as far from setting up any government as demolishing a house is from building a new one in its place.
[00:49:48.777 --> 00:49:55.882]  Indeed, it often makes way for a new frame of commonwealth by destroying the former, but without the consent of the people, can never erect a new one.
[00:49:55.882 --> 00:50:15.594]  That the aggressor who puts himself into a state of war with another, and unjustly evades another man's right, can by such an unjust warrant never come to have right over the conquered, will easily be agreed upon by all men, who will not think that robbers and pirates have a right of empire over whomsoever they have force enough to master, or that men are bound by promises which unlawful force is extort for them.
[00:50:16.158 --> 00:50:24.260]  Should a robber break into my house and with a dagger at my throat make me seal deed to convey my estate to him, would this give him any title?
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:29.061]  Just such a title by his sword has an unjust conqueror who forces me into his submission.
[00:50:29.061 --> 00:50:34.463]  The injury and the crime is equal, whether committed by the wearer of a crown or of some petty villain.
[00:50:34.463 --> 00:50:40.404]  The title of the offender and the number of his followers makes no difference in the offense unless it be to aggravate it.
[00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:42.645]  The only difference is great robbers punish little ones.
[00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:45.488]  Is that Thomas Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin?
[00:50:45.488 --> 00:50:47.130]  That's John Locke.
[00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.592]  John Locke.
[00:50:48.592 --> 00:50:49.272]  Email me that.
[00:50:49.272 --> 00:50:50.854]  I want to post that.
[00:50:50.854 --> 00:50:51.815]  I've read that before.
[00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:52.956]  I'd forgotten who'd written it.
[00:50:52.956 --> 00:50:53.317]  Stay there.
[00:50:53.317 --> 00:50:56.560]  We'll come back to you, then get to Dan, Juan, Lori, and others.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.761]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[00:51:00.788 --> 00:51:02.369]  Are you constantly tired?
[00:51:02.369 --> 00:51:04.209]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[00:51:04.209 --> 00:51:07.511]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[00:51:07.511 --> 00:51:10.532]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.

[00:51:52.733 --> 00:51:53.294]  That's 1-800-976-0025 today!
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:07.302]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.302 --> 00:52:09.942]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:09.942 --> 00:52:11.483]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.483 --> 00:52:12.303]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.303 --> 00:52:13.123]  This is his MO.
[00:52:13.123 --> 00:52:14.663]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.663 --> 00:52:16.644]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.644 --> 00:52:23.805]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:23.805 --> 00:52:24.286]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.286 --> 00:52:29.907]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.627 --> 00:52:34.129]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.129 --> 00:52:36.290]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.336 --> 00:53:04.099]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:53:04.099 --> 00:53:14.245]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:53:14.245 --> 00:53:21.550]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:27.194]  Doctors who have tried heart and body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results as well.
[00:53:27.194 --> 00:53:30.316]  Here's what Dr. Goodman has to say about his experience with the product.
[00:53:30.416 --> 00:53:36.197]  If you notice that most times here are these drug ads on TV, they have a list of possible side effects.
[00:53:36.197 --> 00:53:43.139]  I find that if you're going to take something that is, you're trading one problem for five or six other problems, that to me doesn't make sense.
[00:53:43.139 --> 00:53:49.661]  Using something that is natural, that is absorbed into the body, particularly because it's in a liquid form, I think is the best way to go.
[00:54:07.671 --> 00:54:23.585]  We have the lady coming up in about 50 minutes who shot the video in Kingman, Arizona, the National Guard out running highway checkpoints and eyeing the citizens and training the citizens that secret police on street corners in army uniforms are normal.
[00:54:24.488 --> 00:54:26.649]  Like it's downtown Baghdad.
[00:54:26.649 --> 00:54:43.012]  Jim, that John Locke quote, for those that are on fluoride and didn't understand it, those that support the establishment and this raping that's going on, it's pointing out that naked, brutal oppression is a fraud and is illegitimate.
[00:54:43.012 --> 00:54:48.774]  And just the point I was making before I went to you about a black man not being a slave even if the law says he's not human and has no rights.
[00:54:49.841 --> 00:54:54.985]  And that all these systems of looting can do is destroy societies, but that's what the globalists want.
[00:54:54.985 --> 00:54:59.169]  They want to de-industrialize and destroy all major societies in their own words.
[00:54:59.169 --> 00:55:00.510]  Finish up your point.
[00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:13.421]  Well, I firmly believe that the action of the Second Continental Congress of July 4, 1776, Unanimous Declaration of the 13 United States, which was written by Jefferson because he was heavily influenced by Locke, is nothing but
[00:55:14.116 --> 00:55:21.165]  You know, a brief summarization of Locke's two treaties, and I think it's very important for all free men to know that, because the political status begins in your mind.
[00:55:21.165 --> 00:55:24.649]  You have to determine in your mind whether you're going to be a slave or you're going to be a free man.
[00:55:24.649 --> 00:55:25.349]  That's right.
[00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:27.973]  They're training us to be dominated and to capitulate.
[00:55:27.973 --> 00:55:28.894]  Thank you, Jim.
[00:55:28.894 --> 00:55:30.636]  Dan and Mass, the security officer.
[00:55:30.636 --> 00:55:31.477]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:55:31.477 --> 00:55:32.878]  Hey Alex, how you doing, brother?
[00:55:32.878 --> 00:55:33.099]  Good.
[00:55:34.215 --> 00:55:35.977]  Yeah, I'm a security officer.
[00:55:35.977 --> 00:55:37.718]  I'm not looking for no plug either.
[00:55:37.718 --> 00:55:39.319]  I'm also a radio talk show host.
[00:55:39.319 --> 00:55:40.821]  I do the same thing you do.
[00:55:40.821 --> 00:55:47.166]  But I want to report false inoculations and also a large number of Humvees for the Boston area.
[00:55:47.166 --> 00:55:48.367]  Okay.
[00:55:48.367 --> 00:55:52.370]  One of my clients asked whether the part-time security is a paper company.
[00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:55.313]  They did a mandatory sign-up for the flu shot.
[00:55:56.354 --> 00:55:58.916]  You know, people coming in, and it was disgusting.
[00:55:58.916 --> 00:56:01.758]  People bringing their kids in there, their family, their wives.
[00:56:01.758 --> 00:56:07.122]  And I'm trying over there, passing out papers, and trying to tell these people how poisonous these damn things are.
[00:56:07.122 --> 00:56:12.826]  They're putting these pins in these poor kids' arms, and it was just disgusting, the whole damn thing.
[00:56:12.826 --> 00:56:16.829]  You know, watching these kids, you know, just get ejected with poison and everything.
[00:56:16.829 --> 00:56:18.931]  So they're just hurting the kids.
[00:56:18.931 --> 00:56:21.513]  They're hurting the kids in where?
[00:56:21.513 --> 00:56:24.475]  In a way, in Massachusetts.
[00:56:24.475 --> 00:56:25.035]  Are they doing it?
[00:56:26.434 --> 00:56:28.516]  You know, just the whole family doing a company there.
[00:56:28.516 --> 00:56:31.038]  I mean, I'm a client, so I don't have to get the inoculation.
[00:56:31.038 --> 00:56:35.301]  I mean, it was just disgusting to watch this whole thing take place.
[00:56:35.301 --> 00:56:39.544]  And what are the Humvees doing?
[00:56:39.544 --> 00:56:40.685]  Well, I was on the Mass Pike.
[00:56:40.685 --> 00:56:43.007]  It was August 22nd at 2 a.m.
[00:56:43.007 --> 00:56:48.150]  I was heading to Rhode Island for my show the next day, or the weekend, I'm sorry.
[00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:49.732]  And I stopped at a truck stop.
[00:56:49.732 --> 00:56:51.993]  There was two trailers, you know, at the flatbed.
[00:56:51.993 --> 00:56:54.135]  There was three Humvees on each one.
[00:56:54.485 --> 00:56:54.886]  Yeah.
[00:57:14.605 --> 00:57:24.591]  Yeah, we've confirmed from the defense contractor companies, they're setting up thousands and thousands of Humvees with police computers to run Americans' plates.
[00:57:24.591 --> 00:57:25.772]  But it's all announced.
[00:57:25.772 --> 00:57:30.074]  I mean, they're deploying 379,000 troops in the next year on our streets.
[00:57:30.074 --> 00:57:31.115]  This is it.
[00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:32.336]  Thank you, Dan.
[00:57:32.336 --> 00:57:34.837]  Juan in New York, healthcare worker.
[00:57:34.837 --> 00:57:36.979]  Juan, welcome.
[00:57:36.979 --> 00:57:38.019]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:57:38.019 --> 00:57:41.561]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[00:57:41.561 --> 00:57:42.242]  Good to talk to you.
[00:57:44.212 --> 00:57:52.513]  Yeah, I have received a letter, uh, back a few weeks ago about our, about the influenza vaccine that we had to take.
[00:57:52.513 --> 00:58:06.096]  And, um, I actually sent you guys a letter and it told us on the bottom that they're going to, uh, update us on the status of the forced inoculation and on the novel H1N1.
[00:58:06.096 --> 00:58:13.637]  So yesterday at an, at a internal meeting for our department, our manager told us that it looks like
[00:58:14.229 --> 00:58:20.232]  They're going to, uh, you know, make the H1N1 vaccine, uh, mandatory.
[00:58:20.232 --> 00:58:25.355]  So, she says we probably won't have any recourse.
[00:58:25.355 --> 00:58:32.179]  But I don't understand how they're gonna do this, because 50% of the people that I talk to don't want to take the regular flu vaccine.
[00:58:32.179 --> 00:58:36.121]  Stay there, we're gonna come back to you in 70 seconds when we start the second hour.
[00:58:36.121 --> 00:58:38.483]  This is classical military operation.
[00:58:42.509 --> 00:58:45.130]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:50.293]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:54.535]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.535 --> 00:58:56.536]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.536 --> 00:59:05.060]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:10.602]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.602 --> 00:59:12.223]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.463 --> 00:59:18.985]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:18.985 --> 00:59:30.027]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.027 --> 00:59:30.788]  That's right.
[00:59:30.788 --> 00:59:33.368]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.368 --> 00:59:34.949]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:59:36.889 --> 00:59:37.349]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.162]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.162 --> 01:00:09.924]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.924 --> 01:00:11.505]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.505 --> 01:00:12.426]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.426 --> 01:00:17.251]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.251 --> 01:00:21.316]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.523 --> 01:00:36.694]  As complete tyranny and the arm of false flag terror unfolds across the world in the years to come, don't say you weren't warned, don't say that it wasn't laid out before you.
[01:00:36.694 --> 01:00:45.641]  All of us have a responsibility to learn this information, to learn how elites operate, to learn how this corporate takeover is taking place, and to get the word out and to say no.
[01:00:47.247 --> 01:00:52.232]  We have a guest coming up in about 45 minutes who was in Kingman, Arizona and shot the video.
[01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:54.794]  It's viral on YouTube, up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:54.794 --> 01:00:57.637]  It's in Paul Watson's article, Maximum Alert, U.S.
[01:00:57.637 --> 01:01:00.179]  Troops Now Occupying America.
[01:01:00.179 --> 01:01:01.020]  She'll be joining us.
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.943]  She also called the National Guard when she brought up posse comitatus.
[01:01:03.943 --> 01:01:04.623]  They hung up on her.
[01:01:04.623 --> 01:01:07.846]  We're going to have the audio of that as well.
[01:01:07.846 --> 01:01:08.687]  We have other video.
[01:01:08.687 --> 01:01:12.231]  We are Change Ohio in Kentucky with warrantless military checkpoints.
[01:01:13.396 --> 01:01:17.801]  In the middle of the city, they would walk up to him and say, will you shoot us in the back of the head?
[01:01:17.801 --> 01:01:19.363]  Will you put us in death camps?
[01:01:19.363 --> 01:01:20.864]  Will you take our guns if ordered?
[01:01:20.864 --> 01:01:23.707]  And the military wouldn't say they wouldn't.
[01:01:23.707 --> 01:01:25.089]  Very sick.
[01:01:25.089 --> 01:01:26.811]  Very, very, very, very sick.
[01:01:30.526 --> 01:01:33.747]  Let's go back to Dan, no, Juan in New York.
[01:01:33.747 --> 01:01:37.588]  Juan, show, you're a healthcare worker and they've said, looks like it's going to be mandatory.
[01:01:37.588 --> 01:01:42.929]  Well, they're already ordering people that it's mandatory, but they tell them, don't tell anybody we're making you do this.
[01:01:42.929 --> 01:01:46.230]  Then Obama's there to soothe everyone and say, don't worry.
[01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:48.871]  They know the majority are against it and it's illegal.
[01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:51.432]  So he tells you there's no attack happening.
[01:01:51.432 --> 01:01:57.293]  And then all the surrogates go out and then try to force it when they corner you by yourself at work.
[01:01:57.293 --> 01:01:59.154]  This is the nature of a military PSYOP.
[01:02:02.356 --> 01:02:03.357]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:20.011 --> 01:02:22.552]  I don't want to take the swine flu vaccine.
[01:02:22.552 --> 01:02:24.692]  So I don't know what they're going to... Well that's it!
[01:02:24.692 --> 01:02:27.753]  I mean, there's no law you've got to take the regular flu shot.
[01:02:27.753 --> 01:02:36.036]  The executive order says under level 6 they can make you take the emergency shot, but that's an illegal UN agreement.
[01:02:36.036 --> 01:02:37.416]  And no, it's totally illegal.
[01:02:37.416 --> 01:02:42.217]  That's why Obama gets on TV every week and says you don't have to take it while they try to force it.
[01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:43.938]  These are hardcore criminals.
[01:02:45.034 --> 01:02:52.118]  Also, if you will allow me, I'd like to tell you about a bright spot in this horrible situation.
[01:02:52.118 --> 01:03:01.083]  The bright spot in this horrible situation is that I am now, you know, now that all this is coming out, I am bumping into more and more people, like-minded people.
[01:03:01.083 --> 01:03:07.287]  So, I always thought of myself as in the minority, but as I speak to people, people have these same views.
[01:03:07.287 --> 01:03:11.690]  Just take, for instance, yesterday, I was in the neonatal intensive care unit, and
[01:03:13.095 --> 01:03:18.818]  A nurse was talking about it with a doctor and they were both talking almost the same.
[01:03:18.818 --> 01:03:24.440]  When I cornered the nurse alone, she started spewing out a lot of things and I was like, wow.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.202]  Everything, even about 9-11 and the government and everything.
[01:03:27.202 --> 01:03:32.724]  So I immediately went down to my workstation where I keep copies of Endgame because I find that that's the most...
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:40.662]  The most effective orientating tool to people who have ideas, but are very scattered about it.
[01:03:40.662 --> 01:03:43.903]  So I immediately gave it to her and I said, you should watch this tonight.
[01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:50.706]  And I'm actually making her copies for, of, uh, police state and, uh, loose change and things like that.
[01:03:50.706 --> 01:04:00.409]  And if that's in this dark, in this dark time, that's one little sliver of light that people are waking up and people are going to start to take action.
[01:04:00.919 --> 01:04:03.920]  Well, the key is, get the internal CDC report.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:18.942]  You can pull it up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, or just the headline, Secret CDC Report Links Vaccine to Guillain-Barre, or to Neurological Disorders, and then go, here's the secret CDC report.
[01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:29.184]  And then you can pull up the CDC report from 2000 that got leaked in 2002, and Congress then released it, where the head of the CDC said, I wouldn't give this to my granddaughter.
[01:04:29.184 --> 01:04:29.804]  Any shots.
[01:04:30.731 --> 01:04:32.633]  But we've got to keep this from the public.
[01:04:32.633 --> 01:04:33.974]  We've got a mandate to push this.
[01:04:33.974 --> 01:04:35.916]  Look, everybody's waking up to vaccines.
[01:04:35.916 --> 01:04:42.562]  So they're staging this whole deal to try to set the precedent that they make us take the shots while they announce you don't have to take it.
[01:04:42.562 --> 01:04:44.904]  They say you don't have to take it, but you're fired if you don't.
[01:04:45.725 --> 01:04:47.226]  Well, that's making you take it.
[01:04:47.226 --> 01:04:48.106]  God bless you, sir.
[01:04:48.106 --> 01:04:48.626]  Keep it up.
[01:04:48.626 --> 01:04:49.566]  Keep spreading the word.
[01:04:49.566 --> 01:04:50.527]  Yes.
[01:04:50.527 --> 01:04:58.750]  As the tyranny intensifies, it's a double-edged sword because now all these people that didn't want to wake up are forced to face the fact that we were right.
[01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:59.750]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:00.390]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:05.692]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.692 --> 01:05:10.214]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.214 --> 01:05:12.495]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.495 --> 01:05:14.136]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.136 --> 01:05:15.156]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.396 --> 01:05:23.820]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:06:07.411 --> 01:06:11.993]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:11.993 --> 01:06:17.576]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:17.856 --> 01:06:22.640]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.263]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:06:26.263 --> 01:06:31.087]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:37.652]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.

[01:07:03.755 --> 01:07:06.696]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[01:07:06.696 --> 01:07:08.937]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[01:07:08.937 --> 01:07:09.917]  Here's the story.
[01:07:09.917 --> 01:07:14.718]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[01:07:14.718 --> 01:07:15.978]  Now here's the bad news.
[01:07:15.978 --> 01:07:21.060]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.900]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:27.785]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[01:07:27.785 --> 01:07:33.291]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[01:07:33.291 --> 01:07:35.493]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[01:07:35.493 --> 01:07:44.183]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[01:07:44.483 --> 01:07:49.667]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.

[01:07:59.154 --> 01:08:06.220]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.482]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:19.873 --> 01:08:25.855]  I want to go through your calls quickly.
[01:08:25.855 --> 01:08:29.896]  All of you are bringing up key info, but I want to get to more people.
[01:08:29.896 --> 01:08:44.840]  Now, we have a lot of callers on different issues, and we'll take the people that are on hold, but as you hear callers hang up, that is the military people, active duty, involved in these checkpoints, involved in all these drills, the Marines involved in these illegal checkpoints.
[01:08:45.828 --> 01:08:50.732]  Or wives or husbands of these Marines and Army soldiers and National Guard, call in.
[01:08:50.732 --> 01:08:57.638]  I'm also trying to get a hold of We Are Change Ohio, who shot the video in Kentucky, boldly walked up and
[01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:09.395]  Ask the National Guard that was out there searching bags, running checkpoints, staring at the citizens, staring everybody down like secret police out of Red Dawn, out of the Soviet Union.
[01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:11.356]  They have done an incredible job.
[01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:12.337]  This is how it's done.
[01:09:12.337 --> 01:09:21.404]  In fact, go ahead, Hoosh, and play that clip of We Are Change Ohio in Kentucky at military checkpoints.
[01:09:21.404 --> 01:09:21.744]  Here it is.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:31.921]  I mean, it's a combat zone, you know?
[01:09:31.921 --> 01:09:33.962]  Right, but what if it was here?
[01:09:33.962 --> 01:09:36.503]  They wouldn't have no reason to make another like that.
[01:09:36.503 --> 01:09:38.324]  But they did do it in Katrina.
[01:09:38.324 --> 01:09:39.765]  Yeah.
[01:09:39.765 --> 01:09:42.086]  Well, I wasn't in the states for Katrina.
[01:09:42.086 --> 01:09:43.366]  But would you agree with that?
[01:09:43.366 --> 01:09:45.467]  Like, is that something the Army should be doing?
[01:09:45.467 --> 01:09:47.928]  Taking guns away from the citizenry?
[01:09:47.928 --> 01:09:49.029]  I'm just a soldier.
[01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:51.230]  I do what I'm told.
[01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:53.131]  But you did take an oath to the Constitution, though.
[01:09:54.548 --> 01:09:56.829]  When you salute with the flag and whatnot.
[01:09:56.829 --> 01:09:56.929]  Yes.
[01:09:56.929 --> 01:10:00.229]  And you're also sworn to the officers and the NCOs that are above you.
[01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:10.932]  But if the officer asks you to do something unconstitutional, where does your loyalties lie, I guess, for... Well, if an officer is asking us to do something that's unconstitutional, it's not coming from him, he's not making it up.
[01:10:10.932 --> 01:10:13.033]  It's coming from somebody higher than him.
[01:10:13.033 --> 01:10:13.893]  Right.
[01:10:13.893 --> 01:10:16.013]  But then... So the chain follows down.
[01:10:16.013 --> 01:10:17.234]  It could come straight from the President.
[01:10:17.234 --> 01:10:18.734]  The President wants his stuff done.
[01:10:18.734 --> 01:10:19.254]  That's true.
[01:10:19.254 --> 01:10:20.694]  You know, that's on the President.
[01:10:20.694 --> 01:10:22.555]  But you do not, like, it is your right to say no.
[01:10:23.942 --> 01:10:30.306]  I mean, it is, but you just do what we're telling you.
[01:10:30.306 --> 01:10:31.207]  We're soldiers.
[01:10:31.207 --> 01:10:32.247]  Hit pause.
[01:10:32.247 --> 01:10:32.988]  Did you hear that?
[01:10:32.988 --> 01:10:36.150]  Yeah, I've got a right to say no in unlawful order.
[01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:39.512]  They're commanded to in their training, but they don't really give that training anymore.
[01:10:39.512 --> 01:10:42.414]  But I'm still just going to follow my orders.
[01:10:42.414 --> 01:10:43.355]  I will take your guns.
[01:10:45.168 --> 01:10:46.748]  And they will take your guns.
[01:10:46.748 --> 01:10:49.929]  They did it in Katrina and surrounding areas to set the precedent.
[01:10:49.929 --> 01:10:53.090]  And they're training military nationwide to take your guns.
[01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:57.131]  Now, they've created this cult of worshipping the military, worshipping police.
[01:10:57.131 --> 01:11:03.893]  But when they're bought and paid for by foreign offshore banks, and they're destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution, they're attacking the Republic.
[01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:06.634]  And they are domestic enemies of this country.
[01:11:07.776 --> 01:11:12.999]  When they start going after our guns and our liberties and setting up illegal checkpoints, they are the real enemy combatants.
[01:11:12.999 --> 01:11:20.183]  But they've been trained that patriots and conservatives and libertarians and Ron Paul supporters and in the Fed protesters are terrorists.
[01:11:20.183 --> 01:11:20.963]  No!
[01:11:20.963 --> 01:11:28.027]  You are a treasonous, treacherous criminal when you engage in these criminal activities.
[01:11:28.027 --> 01:11:32.509]  And that's all they're doing is acclimating this fool to carry this out.
[01:11:32.509 --> 01:11:33.250]  Let's go back to him.
[01:11:34.864 --> 01:11:41.796]  Might give you a little bit more information and there's another checkpoint about two blocks in that direction with some people that are a little higher ranked than I am.
[01:11:41.796 --> 01:11:44.441]  Might have some information for you.
[01:11:44.441 --> 01:11:44.942]  Hit pause.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.600]  Did you hear that?
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.701]  There's another checkpoint.
[01:11:49.701 --> 01:11:53.642]  I also have these delusional people sending me emails saying these aren't checkpoints.
[01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:54.342]  Yes, they are.
[01:11:54.342 --> 01:12:02.765]  You can go read the state police press releases around the country in Tennessee and California and other areas where they say they're warrantless checkpoints.
[01:12:02.765 --> 01:12:04.046]  Got it?
[01:12:04.046 --> 01:12:11.568]  I got video and photos of them searching little kids' bags in the middle of major cities and towns.
[01:12:11.568 --> 01:12:12.668]  Stop living in denial.
[01:12:12.668 --> 01:12:13.669]  Here's more video.
[01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:14.109]  More audio.
[01:12:23.533 --> 01:12:27.974]  It's an ambulance driving by.
[01:12:27.974 --> 01:12:33.636]  And another checkpoint.
[01:12:33.636 --> 01:12:37.077]  Looks like Mayberry.
[01:12:37.077 --> 01:12:41.218]  You got the military on their radios reporting what the citizens are doing, watching everybody.
[01:12:41.218 --> 01:12:45.599]  This is the most disgusting thing to watch.
[01:12:45.599 --> 01:12:46.940]  These people are such traitors.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:48.920]  And it doesn't matter if you don't know you're a traitor.
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.261]  You've rationalized it in your gut, you know it's wrong.
[01:12:53.489 --> 01:12:56.250]  All we're doing is traffic control.
[01:12:56.250 --> 01:13:00.071]  We're making sure that all emergency vehicles get in properly.
[01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:02.752]  All outgoing traffic goes out smoothly.
[01:13:02.752 --> 01:13:03.152]  Right.
[01:13:03.152 --> 01:13:04.893]  Do you know how long this has been going on?
[01:13:04.893 --> 01:13:08.054]  Like specifically here at Riverfest, of how many years?
[01:13:08.054 --> 01:13:08.854]  I know several years.
[01:13:08.854 --> 01:13:09.954]  At least five or six.
[01:13:09.954 --> 01:13:10.515]  At least.
[01:13:10.515 --> 01:13:11.015]  Really?
[01:13:11.015 --> 01:13:11.515]  Hit pause.
[01:13:11.515 --> 01:13:14.956]  So this has been going on for 20 years.
[01:13:14.956 --> 01:13:16.957]  In the last 10 it's accelerated.
[01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:18.597]  You notice six years.
[01:13:18.597 --> 01:13:20.818]  But now suddenly all over the country
[01:13:21.684 --> 01:13:23.905]  They're just everywhere.
[01:13:23.905 --> 01:13:31.708]  We're getting confirmed reports and local blurbs about troops in the middle of nowhere at four-way stops in the country.
[01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:43.734]  Here's the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette about 2,500 troops with the FBI, with local police.
[01:13:43.734 --> 01:13:44.194]  Amazing.
[01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:54.817]  And it says that the county, city, state, and university camera systems are now hooked into the feds, and there's a command center.
[01:13:54.817 --> 01:14:09.750]  They have a photo here in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, headline, M-A-A-C, organizes Pittsburgh security for G20, and it says M-A-A-C Center, and it's the military running the command center over the police and over everyone.
[01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:11.771]  This is just unbelievable.
[01:14:11.771 --> 01:14:14.213]  Because they know how to occupy a country.
[01:14:14.213 --> 01:14:15.875]  Finish up with this clip, and we're going to your calls.
[01:14:17.402 --> 01:14:25.085]  We're military police, which means we have military authority under Newport Police Department.
[01:14:25.085 --> 01:14:27.306]  Okay, so do you have police powers?
[01:14:27.306 --> 01:14:33.469]  No, that is in conjunction with the police department.
[01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.530]  Are you guys trained with the police at a local police center?
[01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:43.013]  Military police are trained military police ways, but we will assist police officers if asked.
[01:14:45.472 --> 01:14:47.173]  That was high treason right there.
[01:14:47.173 --> 01:14:49.893]  Got the MPs out there, and that's what they do.
[01:14:49.893 --> 01:14:52.514]  They come out and say, oh, it's just traffic checkpoints.
[01:14:52.514 --> 01:14:55.595]  Oh, oh, got a guy with some marijuana, got a drunk driver.
[01:14:55.595 --> 01:14:59.477]  Oh, we're going to go over and help, and then the troops help put the handcuffs on.
[01:14:59.477 --> 01:15:01.717]  Just unbelievable.
[01:15:01.717 --> 01:15:11.661]  There aren't riots, there aren't burning cities, but the globalists know they're bankrupting the economy by design, and they know the people are going to try to peacefully stand up, and they're getting ready to crush the American people.
[01:15:11.661 --> 01:15:12.181]  Back to the clip.
[01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:15.634]  Not this police department.
[01:15:15.634 --> 01:15:19.420]  Chain of command, they do interact with them and they get mission briefings.
[01:15:26.003 --> 01:15:30.425]  Um, yeah, so like, we noticed that there's a difference.
[01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:34.086]  You guys are traffic control and then there's rover control or something like that.
[01:15:34.086 --> 01:15:38.408]  The guys with the big guns like chillin' with the Humvees down there by the bridge.
[01:15:38.408 --> 01:15:40.149]  It's the exact same job.
[01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:44.370]  All we are here to do is to reinforce the Newport Police Department.
[01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:46.491]  Right, so do you have any police... Hit pause.
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.600]  You like the military terms?
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.162]  Reinforce the Newport Police Department.
[01:15:53.162 --> 01:15:55.082]  Reinforce them against the enemy.
[01:15:55.082 --> 01:15:56.583]  That's what the military does.
[01:15:56.583 --> 01:15:57.323]  They fight enemies.
[01:15:57.323 --> 01:15:59.263]  And we have an imperial government.
[01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:00.684]  An imperial military.
[01:16:00.684 --> 01:16:06.706]  And they're stationed right here in the heart of the empire.
[01:16:06.706 --> 01:16:07.206]  Back to the clip.
[01:16:08.781 --> 01:16:09.462]  No.
[01:16:09.462 --> 01:16:10.963]  We do not arrest.
[01:16:10.963 --> 01:16:14.227]  Not unless asked to do so by Newport Police Department.
[01:16:14.227 --> 01:16:20.293]  Do you know if this has worked around Homeland Security at all?
[01:16:20.293 --> 01:16:21.394]  No.
[01:16:21.394 --> 01:16:21.894]  That's a lie.
[01:16:21.894 --> 01:16:24.457]  Newport Police Department, we are here to assist you.
[01:16:24.457 --> 01:16:26.879]  It just seems like it starts with little things like this.
[01:16:26.879 --> 01:16:30.223]  We call this, I mean, this is a checkpoint, right?
[01:16:31.357 --> 01:16:38.659]  National Guard's been responding to state, er, we have been assisting law enforcement since National Guard's been in existence.
[01:16:38.659 --> 01:16:40.420]  But for emergencies?
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:42.961]  Right, this is not an emergency situation.
[01:16:42.961 --> 01:16:48.282]  It's gone from national emergencies to state emergencies over to public events.
[01:16:48.282 --> 01:16:48.783]  That's fine.
[01:16:48.783 --> 01:16:52.624]  Even, I believe it's Brown v. Board of Education back in the 50s.
[01:16:52.624 --> 01:16:54.865]  National Guard was involved.
[01:16:56.738 --> 01:17:02.885]  Yeah, that's where they wouldn't let black kids into public school, forcing the states, forcing federal control.
[01:17:02.885 --> 01:17:05.528]  He just admitted everything right there.
[01:17:05.528 --> 01:17:07.230]  You see how they do this?
[01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:07.770]  Go back to him.
[01:17:16.744 --> 01:17:18.866]  Yeah, well as like people were trying to kill her.
[01:17:18.866 --> 01:17:20.627]  Like a mob was trying to possibly kill her.
[01:17:20.627 --> 01:17:22.688]  We are here to assist law enforcement.
[01:17:22.688 --> 01:17:23.129]  That is our role.
[01:17:23.129 --> 01:17:25.050]  How do you feel about Posse Comitatus?
[01:17:25.050 --> 01:17:30.734]  After the Civil War, and the war like by the South.
[01:17:30.734 --> 01:17:31.855]  It's not my call.
[01:17:31.855 --> 01:17:32.675]  What's that?
[01:17:32.675 --> 01:17:33.516]  It's not my call.
[01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:38.619]  This guy will take your guns in a minute if he's told to.
[01:17:38.619 --> 01:17:40.641]  Posse Comitatus can be placed on any civilian.
[01:17:42.014 --> 01:17:47.596]  Posse Comitatus can be placed on anybody by a federalized law enforcement officer.
[01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:47.916]  Anybody.
[01:17:47.916 --> 01:17:50.297]  So you consider yourself a law enforcement officer?
[01:17:50.297 --> 01:17:51.537]  Nope.
[01:17:51.537 --> 01:17:52.657]  I am military police.
[01:17:52.657 --> 01:17:55.238]  That is it.
[01:17:55.238 --> 01:17:58.879]  Is there any other... Hit pause.
[01:17:58.879 --> 01:18:03.120]  Notice he now says Posse Comitatus is his right to come against you.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.581]  You see they turn everything around.
[01:18:06.727 --> 01:18:11.137]  Remember, our military killed 1,300,000 Iraqis in the last six and a half years.
[01:18:11.137 --> 01:18:12.199]  They mean business, folks.
[01:18:12.199 --> 01:18:12.741]  Go back to him.
[01:18:14.918 --> 01:18:16.098]  He's asking about camps.
[01:18:16.098 --> 01:18:18.559]  We have a duty to honor our votes.
[01:18:44.383 --> 01:18:46.465]  And then it cuts to the military.
[01:18:46.465 --> 01:18:48.167]  Checkpoints.
[01:18:48.167 --> 01:18:50.490]  And the Humvees on the highway.
[01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:51.230]  God help us.
[01:18:51.230 --> 01:18:52.992]  Okay, Lori, stay there.
[01:18:52.992 --> 01:18:55.135]  Homeland Security bus in Texas.
[01:18:55.135 --> 01:18:56.356]  Mike, Louisiana.
[01:18:56.356 --> 01:18:59.179]  The guy who called in to C-SPAN with Chertoff.
[01:18:59.179 --> 01:19:00.901]  Mike's a Massachusetts nurse.
[01:19:00.901 --> 01:19:02.803]  Andy, North Carolina vet.
[01:19:02.803 --> 01:19:04.245]  We're going to continue with your phone calls.
[01:19:04.245 --> 01:19:06.287]  I'm going to go to him quickly in the next segment.
[01:19:07.867 --> 01:19:12.871]  But that's how it's done, what We Are Change Ohio did.
[01:19:12.871 --> 01:19:15.292]  This is all a mass checkpoint drill.
[01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:28.242]  On the video, at the end of the We Are Change Ohio Kentucky checkpoint video, they just block off the whole bridge and the highway, and they've got their Humvees and their machine guns, and they're just out there doing whatever they want.
[01:19:32.346 --> 01:19:36.127]  And they're out there training people to get used to seeing the military setting up checkpoints.
[01:19:36.127 --> 01:19:38.148]  And all over the country they're searching people's bags.
[01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:40.549]  This is high treason!
[01:19:40.549 --> 01:19:45.930]  And they're just incrementally warping the brains of the troops and the military to accept this and to go along with this.
[01:19:45.930 --> 01:19:48.691]  And it is outrageous.
[01:19:48.691 --> 01:19:57.234]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the middle of a segment at 45 after today when we have the lady join us from Arizona.
[01:20:00.931 --> 01:20:07.633]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:20:07.633 --> 01:20:09.294]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:20:09.294 --> 01:20:13.896]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:20:13.896 --> 01:20:21.558]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:20:21.558 --> 01:20:24.019]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[01:20:24.199 --> 01:20:26.440]  And has no dangerous secondhand smoke.
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:28.380]  So it's safe for the people around you.
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:32.681]  And will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.
[01:20:32.681 --> 01:20:36.382]  So, get rid of the ashtrays, the smell, and the smoke.

[01:20:49.585 --> 01:20:54.988]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:07.476 --> 01:21:15.599]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:15.599 --> 01:21:23.762]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:23.762 --> 01:21:28.863]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:28.863 --> 01:21:33.485]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:34.065 --> 01:21:38.426]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.
[01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:39.506]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:39.506 --> 01:21:44.007]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:44.007 --> 01:21:48.908]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:48.908 --> 01:21:51.908]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:53.669]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.909]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.951 --> 01:22:06.974]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:06.974 --> 01:22:12.858]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:12.858 --> 01:22:19.021]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.361 --> 01:22:21.321]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.321 --> 01:22:23.782]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:23.782 --> 01:22:36.964]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:22:36.964 --> 01:22:38.645]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.645 --> 01:22:40.505]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.505 --> 01:22:46.726]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:47.415 --> 01:22:55.689]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:55.689 --> 01:22:57.251]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.251 --> 01:22:58.453]  The people strike back!
[01:23:02.293 --> 01:23:05.357]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[01:23:05.357 --> 01:23:07.640]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:11.766]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutraversal Foods.
[01:23:11.766 --> 01:23:18.094]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese, and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[01:23:18.454 --> 01:23:22.335]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[01:23:22.335 --> 01:23:26.697]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[01:23:26.697 --> 01:23:28.957]  Nutraversal Foods from eFoods Direct.
[01:23:28.957 --> 01:23:30.298]  Your new comfort food.
[01:23:30.298 --> 01:23:33.399]  Incredible taste, easy to prepare, and a long shelf life.
[01:23:33.399 --> 01:23:34.639]  Nutraversal Foods.
[01:23:34.639 --> 01:23:41.361]  More fun while hunting and fishing, bigger tails around the campfire, and the food your kids will want when celebrating the win of a ballgame.
[01:23:41.361 --> 01:23:45.823]  And if it's this great during the good times, imagine how reassuring it will be if times get tough.
[01:23:48.868 --> 01:23:52.870]  They didn't want you to be able to form opposition to the forced inoculation.
[01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:54.230]  Now they're beginning it.
[01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:55.531]  With a regular flu shot.
[01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:56.091]  Totally illegal.
[01:23:56.091 --> 01:24:00.973]  So they just keep denying it as they're doing it.
[01:24:17.025 --> 01:24:19.126]  Let's go to Lori in Texas.
[01:24:19.126 --> 01:24:20.767]  Homeland Security bus driving around.
[01:24:20.767 --> 01:24:22.268]  Go ahead, Lori.
[01:24:22.268 --> 01:24:22.808]  Hi.
[01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:35.135]  About 11.30 I was driving home towards Cedar Park here in Austin and saw a bus coming towards me on 183 going south and big tour bus looked on the side and said Homeland Security.
[01:24:35.135 --> 01:24:37.836]  So I picked up the phone and called y'all to let you know.
[01:24:37.836 --> 01:24:44.660]  Yeah, they got like five of those last time we checked over at Highland Mall and they've taken over most of the mall
[01:24:45.782 --> 01:24:53.427]  And then delusional people go to the mall and claim they don't see it, even though Homeland Security will run you out of the mall if you go through one of the open doors.
[01:24:53.427 --> 01:24:54.528]  They've taken the whole thing over.
[01:24:54.528 --> 01:24:56.849]  I mean, it's just totally delusional.
[01:24:56.849 --> 01:24:59.051]  Your neighbors will tell you you didn't see that.
[01:24:59.051 --> 01:25:13.520]  Yeah, something else about a month ago, I worked for a dental clinic in South Austin, and we received a fax that said, from Camp Mabry, that said that they needed a dentist to basically paid volunteers to get the troops dental-ready over two weekends.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:18.602]  And so, I tried to call y'all about a month ago to let y'all know, but I never could get through.
[01:25:18.602 --> 01:25:23.584]  But I know your dad's a dentist, and I don't know if he got the same fax.
[01:25:23.584 --> 01:25:27.926]  Can you email it to riders at InfoWars.com?
[01:25:27.926 --> 01:25:31.347]  I'll see if the girls up front kept it for me, but I sure will.
[01:25:31.347 --> 01:25:32.348]  Riders at where?
[01:25:32.348 --> 01:25:34.749]  At InfoWars.com.
[01:25:34.749 --> 01:25:35.669]  InfoWars.com.
[01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.909]  Okay.
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:39.001]  And then a couple of other things real quick.
[01:25:39.001 --> 01:25:47.547]  See, what they're doing is they're reaching out to the community as if the government doesn't have its own health care to get everybody integrated, quote, as volunteers for them.
[01:25:47.547 --> 01:25:54.672]  And their first contact with you through their force multiplication operation sounds reasonable.
[01:25:54.672 --> 01:25:57.493]  It's like the Peace Corps is almost totally CIA.
[01:25:57.493 --> 01:26:00.976]  They go help you, but then later down the road they get control of you.
[01:26:00.976 --> 01:26:02.337]  And that's all this is.
[01:26:02.337 --> 01:26:04.038]  This is the military taking over America.
[01:26:05.247 --> 01:26:06.168]  That's right.
[01:26:06.168 --> 01:26:07.629]  Two other quick things real quick.
[01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:19.917]  I noticed about a month ago about that same time I was watching the news in the morning and the news that they were talking about just little things that said in Austin that birth rates have gone down and they blame that on the housing market.
[01:26:19.917 --> 01:26:32.166]  And then also on the History Channel there's a good series called That's Impossible and a little series, a little one that they had called Weather Warfare and that totally talks about how they're changing the weather.
[01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:33.170]  I don't think so.
[01:26:46.251 --> 01:26:47.011]  Thank you, sir.
[01:27:15.014 --> 01:27:25.156]  Wanted to launch another Working Hard here in the epicenter of the police state takeover, their beta testing area.
[01:27:25.156 --> 01:27:33.437]  I have an open invitation for all military and police authorities to come by 2112 St.
[01:27:33.437 --> 01:27:36.218]  Claude, Melvin's Bar.
[01:27:36.218 --> 01:27:41.119]  It's a bar I took over that I'm going to be streaming your radio show through.
[01:27:41.119 --> 01:27:43.679]  I'm going to be doing screenings of
[01:27:44.474 --> 01:27:44.714]  I don't
[01:28:04.454 --> 01:28:04.834]  That's right.
[01:28:23.936 --> 01:28:30.141]  The subject does not answer a question when you get on to do the follow-up.
[01:28:30.141 --> 01:28:33.224]  Ask them why they didn't answer the question.
[01:28:33.224 --> 01:28:36.747]  It's a good way to corner them and get in that area.
[01:28:36.747 --> 01:28:40.630]  What about Chertoff saying six of the ten commission members have not said it was a fraud?
[01:28:40.630 --> 01:28:43.452]  That's on record in the Washington Post.
[01:28:43.452 --> 01:28:46.915]  They've done TV interviews saying it, and he just said, nope, you're liars.
[01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:54.474]  Well, I'll let you know that that's what they do, that they, faced with the facts, faced with the evidence, they just deny.
[01:28:54.474 --> 01:28:56.535]  They just blatantly lie.
[01:28:56.535 --> 01:28:59.617]  That's... If they have no other recourse, that's the tactic.
[01:28:59.617 --> 01:29:02.279]  You know, you schooled everybody on it.
[01:29:02.279 --> 01:29:05.520]  You know that's what they... They can't come out and admit it.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:11.304]  It's impossible for them to admit it, so that's why I say it's good to throw it in their face if you're a second caller.
[01:29:11.304 --> 01:29:13.265]  Why didn't you answer that correctly?
[01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:14.906]  Or if they do a tactic like that,
[01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:25.603]  If they say, well, they didn't do it, then get on the internet, draw up the, uh, uh, the clips of it and say, well, I'm looking at it right now and here right now, and let me read it to you.
[01:29:25.603 --> 01:29:26.965]  So you can throw it in their face.
[01:29:28.067 --> 01:29:31.650]  Yeah, in Truth Rising, good point sir, thanks for the call Mike.
[01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:36.934]  In Truth Rising, Gary Hart gets asked about his letter to Ahmadinejad of Iran saying the U.S.
[01:29:36.934 --> 01:29:39.035]  may stage terror attacks as a pretext to invade.
[01:29:39.035 --> 01:29:43.559]  He denied he wrote the letter till they pulled out the letter from the Huffington Post.
[01:29:43.559 --> 01:29:45.540]  He said, oh that letter!
[01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:47.782]  And then he suddenly had respect for them.
[01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:51.445]  Again, they lie out of court.
[01:29:51.445 --> 01:29:54.347]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.362 --> 01:30:01.124]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.124 --> 01:30:04.125]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.125 --> 01:30:09.467]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.467 --> 01:30:11.508]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.508 --> 01:30:16.510]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:17.691]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.691 --> 01:30:18.811]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.811 --> 01:30:20.692]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.692 --> 01:30:21.772]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.772 --> 01:30:23.793]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:23.973 --> 01:30:25.295]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.295 --> 01:30:26.836]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.836 --> 01:30:32.103]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.103 --> 01:30:35.687]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.687 --> 01:30:39.171]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.511 --> 01:30:40.731]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.731 --> 01:30:41.632]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.632 --> 01:30:42.732]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.732 --> 01:30:43.672]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.672 --> 01:30:44.753]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.753 --> 01:30:47.814]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.814 --> 01:30:49.595]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.595 --> 01:30:50.495]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.103 --> 01:31:05.410]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.410 --> 01:31:09.956]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:09.956 --> 01:31:12.219]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.219 --> 01:31:13.841]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:13.841 --> 01:31:14.883]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.103 --> 01:31:23.545]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:23.545 --> 01:31:30.987]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:31:30.987 --> 01:31:37.029]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:31:37.029 --> 01:31:42.610]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:47.194]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:31:47.194 --> 01:31:51.558]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[01:31:51.558 --> 01:31:54.661]  866-762-9238.

[01:32:01.055 --> 01:32:06.220]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:09.723]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[01:32:09.723 --> 01:32:15.449]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[01:32:15.449 --> 01:32:18.011]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[01:32:18.011 --> 01:32:22.555]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[01:32:22.555 --> 01:32:25.278]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[01:32:25.718 --> 01:32:31.446]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[01:32:31.446 --> 01:32:33.689]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:32:33.689 --> 01:32:42.260]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:43.262]  Don't pick your nose.
[01:32:43.622 --> 01:32:48.206]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[01:32:48.206 --> 01:32:53.310]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:55.071]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[01:32:55.071 --> 01:32:57.273]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:32:57.273 --> 01:32:59.014]  Be well and stay well.
[01:32:59.014 --> 01:33:02.557]  Best MZ.
[01:33:02.557 --> 01:33:08.382]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:10.684]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:33:12.563 --> 01:33:28.608]  We're only going to use their first names, but coming up in about 12 minutes, Luca and Bridget from Mojave County, Minutemen, and Mojave County Oath Keepers, who shot the video of the Arizona National Guard on the street of Kingman, Arizona at checkpoints.
[01:33:28.608 --> 01:33:40.792]  And we're going to be playing that video again live on air, then Dr. Stan Monteith with key flu news, medical doctor joining us to cover the eugenics angle of all of this.
[01:33:40.792 --> 01:33:42.052]  That is coming up in the next hour.
[01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:46.893]  In the final hour today, I have another guest popping in for about 15 minutes.
[01:33:46.893 --> 01:33:53.500]  Then I'm going to get into the master plan of how the military has been taken over by foreign corporations, known as the New World Order.
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:56.082]  That's all this is, is a global corporate takeover.
[01:33:56.082 --> 01:34:05.011]  And how the military, the police, and the citizenry are being brainwashed to accept 379,000 troops openly announced that are going to be patrolling America.
[01:34:05.011 --> 01:34:05.912]  So that is coming up.
[01:34:07.304 --> 01:34:12.226]  Also want to encourage people to remember InfoWars.com, the secure online video bookstore.
[01:34:12.226 --> 01:34:14.167]  That is how we fund this operation.
[01:34:14.167 --> 01:34:18.629]  We're also going to start simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv at 45.
[01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:20.309]  That's when we're going to go live.
[01:34:20.309 --> 01:34:24.891]  45 after, coming up in about 10-11 minutes.
[01:34:24.891 --> 01:34:33.295]  And don't forget we have the new film, Camp FEMA, American Lockdown, documenting the concentration camps, now available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888.
[01:34:34.275 --> 01:34:35.736]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:34:35.736 --> 01:34:53.822]  The big solution here is going to your cities and counties that are being quietly federalized, speaking out at City Council, pointing out how this takeover is taking place, and saying our local police have no business merging with the regular military and the National Guard, and running illegal checkpoints, and going out and protesting these.
[01:34:54.941 --> 01:35:01.926]  Nurses in New York are now starting to have big protests against the forced inoculation that Obama denies is going on.
[01:35:01.926 --> 01:35:05.749]  The people have to stand up and say no in their local communities.
[01:35:05.749 --> 01:35:07.610]  That's where the rubber meets the road.
[01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:12.834]  The Army's deploying sound weapons and microwave guns at tea parties against the American people.
[01:35:12.834 --> 01:35:14.235]  That's admitted.
[01:35:14.235 --> 01:35:22.982]  We're going to go to Mike and Mass and Andy in North Carolina and others, but for the next 10 minutes or so, I wanted to get up on the show with us, Steve Schenck,
[01:35:24.062 --> 01:35:24.502]  I don't think so.
[01:35:43.737 --> 01:35:48.619]  You can't say that in every case because it's very hard sometimes to get organic, but it's non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[01:35:48.619 --> 01:35:54.521]  They've got a whole new line of Nutraversal products on top of their classic high-quality line.
[01:35:54.521 --> 01:36:03.344]  This is where I've chosen to get my storable foods, so I wanted to welcome Steve Schenck here on air as he rolls out for our listeners an entirely new product line.
[01:36:03.344 --> 01:36:05.285]  Steve Schenck from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:36:05.285 --> 01:36:05.925]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:36:06.812 --> 01:36:09.674]  Hey Alex, it's good to be with you again.
[01:36:09.674 --> 01:36:12.136]  Things have been kind of insane for the last three months.
[01:36:12.136 --> 01:36:17.139]  We've been reworking our whole operation.
[01:36:17.139 --> 01:36:18.921]  One of the things that we discovered was
[01:36:20.042 --> 01:36:40.119]  A lot of people are starting to realize that in order for them to be independent, you've got to understand that any fear coming from the swine flu, the bank failures, the New World Order bunch, and whatever people realize may or may not be happening
[01:36:40.956 --> 01:36:41.237]  I think so.
[01:36:52.997 --> 01:37:06.569]  All of these things, if a family will take responsibility for their own preparedness, for their own lives, it really shouldn't be a matter of saying, hey, we're going to get prepared.
[01:37:06.569 --> 01:37:10.272]  It should be a matter of saying, hey, what are we dependent on?
[01:37:10.272 --> 01:37:11.693]  Food is a main thing.
[01:37:11.693 --> 01:37:13.194]  Transportation is a main thing.
[01:37:13.194 --> 01:37:13.915]  Our jobs.
[01:37:14.515 --> 01:37:34.100]  All of these things, if we can get out of debt, so that we're not dependent on being controlled by the debt structure, so we can spend some time with our families going out camping, these new... What we've come up with is a concept that people need to be eating the food right now, and so we've come out with a whole brand new line.
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:35.741]  It's called the 7-Day Responder.
[01:37:35.741 --> 01:37:38.682]  We did a little experiment with the 3-Day Responder.
[01:37:38.682 --> 01:37:41.822]  The whole idea behind this is this is virtually health food.
[01:37:41.822 --> 01:37:43.523]  It has no hydrogenated oil.
[01:37:44.173 --> 01:37:52.548]  No MSG, none of the junk that the health food people are realizing will make you glow in the dark and walk sideways.
[01:37:52.548 --> 01:37:54.331]  And these are all put together in meals.
[01:37:55.786 --> 01:37:56.286]  Yes, I have.
[01:38:19.252 --> 01:38:31.519]  You know, we've got a lot of things that are coming at us, and various people are concerned about the various sirens that you're blowing and the freedom drums that you're beating, and rightly so.
[01:38:31.519 --> 01:38:34.821]  But they can do something on their own.
[01:38:34.821 --> 01:38:46.128]  It's no longer a matter of waiting for, quote, them, the government, or whoever the powers that be are, our legislators, our supposedly representative form of government,
[01:38:46.861 --> 01:38:49.603]  It's no longer a matter of waiting for them to fix things.
[01:38:49.603 --> 01:38:50.984]  Nobody's going to fix anything.
[01:38:50.984 --> 01:38:54.207]  Each family has to fix their own situation.
[01:38:54.207 --> 01:39:02.213]  That's why the establishment is harassing and trying to tax and regulate with the Animal ID, Premises ID, small farms and ranches.
[01:39:02.213 --> 01:39:06.557]  They openly want to bankrupt us and drive us under government control.
[01:39:07.412 --> 01:39:08.553]  Absolutely.
[01:39:08.553 --> 01:39:19.117]  And food is the place that always has been, always will be, the maximum control of the maximum number of the population.
[01:39:19.117 --> 01:39:31.802]  And if folks believe what you're telling them, that this is in the process of happening, has already happened in many instances, the main thing that we came out with this new line for, that we still have,
[01:39:32.452 --> 01:39:40.936]  The regular one-year supplies and things that you have a whole bunch of supplies of and all of the listeners have a lot of supplies of.
[01:39:40.936 --> 01:39:44.918]  But now with this new seven-day, people literally can buy their groceries.
[01:39:44.918 --> 01:39:51.341]  They can free themselves up if they want to get their kids off the texting telephones and get them back into the family.
[01:39:51.341 --> 01:39:54.963]  Take them camping and you don't have to go through all the struggles of cooking good food.
[01:39:54.963 --> 01:39:59.965]  This stuff is phenomenal whether you're at a camp stove in your home or serving a gourmet dinner.
[01:40:01.564 --> 01:40:07.427]  The idea is if families can become independent.
[01:40:07.427 --> 01:40:08.767]  Dependency is the thing.
[01:40:08.767 --> 01:40:11.889]  I know that you rail against this constantly.
[01:40:11.889 --> 01:40:22.994]  We're dependent on what our legislators do to control us, but the fact is that we as individuals must absolutely love our families enough
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:30.145]  To get in a situation where those dependencies won't force us to do things that we do not want to do.
[01:40:30.145 --> 01:40:38.232]  And let's face it, they're trying to acclimate everybody to accept troops and military and police coming to your door, forcibly inoculating you.
[01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:43.956]  But in the first phases of this, in the years to come, this is clearly just a conditioning drill going on right now.
[01:40:43.956 --> 01:40:46.938]  In the
[01:40:48.692 --> 01:40:52.593]  In the years to come, they are going to continue to ratchet this up.
[01:40:52.593 --> 01:40:59.555]  But the way they do it with Katrina and other ops is they shut everything down, then flush you out to come to their gathering centers.
[01:40:59.555 --> 01:41:01.515]  I love the slogan you guys have got.
[01:41:01.515 --> 01:41:03.916]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:41:03.916 --> 01:41:08.257]  The banking issue is why they're really setting up this police state grid.
[01:41:08.257 --> 01:41:12.598]  The economy is now a jobless recovery, total Orwellian term.
[01:41:12.598 --> 01:41:15.039]  Things are deteriorating fast.
[01:41:15.039 --> 01:41:17.540]  And in the years to come, it is essential
[01:41:18.476 --> 01:41:21.378]  To trust in God, but tie up your camel, as the Bedouins say.
[01:41:21.378 --> 01:41:27.983]  You know, trust in God, but row away from the rocks, as Hunter S. Thompson once said.
[01:41:27.983 --> 01:41:37.349]  And you guys are the high-quality place, and very inexpensive, to get freshly packaged, new, trustworthy, high-quality food that lasts more than 10 years.
[01:41:37.349 --> 01:41:40.992]  efoodsdirect.com, the letter E, and then foodsdirect.com.
[01:41:40.992 --> 01:41:44.494]  Big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:41:44.494 --> 01:41:47.997]  Steve, tell folks about some of the packages you've got, and how people can call you.
[01:41:48.888 --> 01:41:57.090]  Well, this little seven-day responder, there are two forms of it, Packet A and Packet B. They're each a full week worth of food.
[01:41:57.090 --> 01:42:12.135]  What we do with them is, you know, you'll hear organizations talk about a serving of food being one cup, and they give you a serving a day, and that's a year's supply for 365 cups of food.
[01:42:12.135 --> 01:42:13.936]  It doesn't work.
[01:42:13.936 --> 01:42:15.116]  Each one of these meals
[01:42:15.789 --> 01:42:22.133]  is sixteen ounces and there are three of them a day and it comes in a package, a seven-day responder.
[01:42:22.133 --> 01:42:27.636]  If they'll get up on the website, efoodsdirect.com, they'll see a picture of this little rascal.
[01:42:27.636 --> 01:42:35.560]  It's about a foot square and four inches deep and it's got seven days worth of phenomenal food plus snacks in it.
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:41.783]  And we've got families right now literally living on this because it's better food than they can prepare themselves.
[01:42:41.783 --> 01:42:42.564]  The whole idea
[01:42:43.492 --> 01:42:47.981]  Is not just to think in terms of, oh, if the gloom and doom hits us.
[01:42:49.063 --> 01:42:54.246]  And that issue is fine, and it's important to be aware of it.
[01:42:54.246 --> 01:42:59.749]  But the fact is, we've got to live our lives every day, and life ought to be a little bit of fun.
[01:42:59.749 --> 01:43:03.932]  They can go backpacking with this food, they can go camping with it.
[01:43:03.932 --> 01:43:14.738]  Mom can get off the grid in terms of having to be laboring over the stove and providing food, and we can get away from these terrible, terrible fast food restaurants.
[01:43:15.353 --> 01:43:24.900]  And by the way, you already had a great website, but it's been revamped, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:26.821]  A lot of new info there.
[01:43:26.821 --> 01:43:28.403]  We've only got about a minute left here, Steve.
[01:43:28.403 --> 01:43:30.844]  Give folks the toll-free number to call.
[01:43:30.844 --> 01:43:31.205]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:43:31.205 --> 01:43:31.385]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:43:36.723 --> 01:43:51.107]  We've also got a live chat up on the website now, Alex, which is just really exciting because people can ask their questions and get answers immediately.
[01:43:51.107 --> 01:43:54.148]  They can call in and get answers.
[01:43:54.148 --> 01:43:57.209]  Our objective is to help people become independent.
[01:43:57.689 --> 01:43:59.450]  We're not worried about the fear.
[01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:10.638]  If people want to become independent, then they can choose to be fearless in this world that we're dealing with that you're so aptly warning them about and telling them what's happening.
[01:44:10.638 --> 01:44:12.939]  eFoodsDirect.com, folks.
[01:44:12.939 --> 01:44:15.641]  Firearms, food, water.
[01:44:15.641 --> 01:44:20.304]  They've got a lot of great products on the water filter line, a lot of little stoves and things.
[01:44:20.304 --> 01:44:23.086]  There's so much at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:44:23.086 --> 01:44:24.447]  Again, eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:44:24.447 --> 01:44:26.168]  Steve, give them that toll-free number one more time.
[01:44:26.918 --> 01:44:31.341]  It's 800-409-5633.
[01:44:31.341 --> 01:44:33.542]  And people can call and get a catalog and things.
[01:44:33.542 --> 01:44:36.444]  You have videos up on the site that are free, but don't wait, folks.
[01:44:36.444 --> 01:44:42.427]  Start putting in some storable food, even if it's a couple of seven-day responder packs.
[01:44:42.427 --> 01:44:43.388]  Begin.
[01:44:43.388 --> 01:44:44.368]  Get involved.
[01:44:44.368 --> 01:44:46.930]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[01:44:46.930 --> 01:44:48.291]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:44:48.291 --> 01:44:50.092]  Steve Schenck, thank you so much.
[01:44:50.092 --> 01:44:52.113]  Take care, Alex.
[01:44:52.113 --> 01:44:54.154]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, here's a video clip.
[01:44:54.154 --> 01:44:55.315]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:58.326 --> 01:45:00.048]  Why is the National Guard out here?
[01:45:00.048 --> 01:45:03.451]  Uh, we're just helping with security and traffic and stuff for the races.
[01:45:03.451 --> 01:45:04.331]  Are you under the city?
[01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:05.673]  Are you working for the city right now?
[01:45:05.673 --> 01:45:07.154]  Guys, are you working for the city?
[01:45:07.154 --> 01:45:10.277]  Because, uh, are you under the control of the police, though?
[01:45:10.277 --> 01:45:11.538]  I have no idea, actually.
[01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:11.918]  Okay.
[01:45:11.918 --> 01:45:12.939]  I just do what I'm told.
[01:45:12.939 --> 01:45:13.800]  I say, Roger, Sergeant.
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:15.201]  I don't know, but we'll call you that.
[01:45:15.201 --> 01:45:16.162]  You're a Sergeant?
[01:45:16.162 --> 01:45:16.983]  Okay, that's cool.
[01:45:16.983 --> 01:45:17.283]  Thank you.
[01:45:17.583 --> 01:45:19.424]  Have you ever done anything like this before?
[01:45:19.424 --> 01:45:19.965]  A fare?
[01:45:19.965 --> 01:45:21.106]  A national guard?
[01:45:21.106 --> 01:45:21.566]  Nope.
[01:45:21.566 --> 01:45:23.687]  Five dollar change and I'm here.
[01:45:23.687 --> 01:45:27.170]  This is not for civil... I mean, you're operating in a civilian environment.
[01:45:27.170 --> 01:45:28.991]  There is a point of communications law.
[01:45:28.991 --> 01:45:32.553]  The army or the national guard shouldn't be here unless there is an emergency.
[01:45:32.553 --> 01:45:33.154]  You know?
[01:45:33.154 --> 01:45:33.774]  Anyway, thank you.
[01:45:33.774 --> 01:45:34.635]  I won't interrupt.
[01:45:34.635 --> 01:45:35.616]  Not a good thing.
[01:45:35.616 --> 01:45:41.800]  And not against you, but it's not a good thing what's happening in this country when the military is teaming up with local police.
[01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:43.161]  We're not liking this at all.
[01:45:44.497 --> 01:45:45.118]  Nothing with you, but thank you.
[01:45:45.118 --> 01:45:45.778]  Yeah, nothing with you, thank you.
[01:45:45.778 --> 01:45:45.918]  Uh-huh.
[01:45:45.918 --> 01:45:46.619]  We're not back in this at all.
[01:45:46.619 --> 01:45:46.940]  Is it gone?
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:47.060]  Huh?
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:47.460]  I said gone.
[01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:47.780]  I hope not.
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:48.241]  I don't think so.
[01:45:48.241 --> 01:45:48.581]  I don't think so.
[01:45:48.581 --> 01:45:48.962]  I don't think so.
[01:45:48.962 --> 01:45:49.322]  I don't think so.
[01:45:49.322 --> 01:45:50.543]  I don't think so.
[01:45:50.543 --> 01:45:50.884]  I don't think so.
[01:45:50.884 --> 01:45:51.224]  I don't think so.
[01:45:51.224 --> 01:45:51.564]  I don't think so.
[01:45:51.564 --> 01:45:51.905]  I don't think so.
[01:45:51.905 --> 01:45:52.245]  I don't think so.
[01:45:52.245 --> 01:45:52.605]  I don't think so.
[01:45:52.605 --> 01:45:53.066]  I don't think so.
[01:45:53.066 --> 01:45:54.507]  I don't think so.
[01:45:54.507 --> 01:45:54.868]  I don't think so.
[01:45:54.868 --> 01:45:55.228]  I don't think so.
[01:45:55.228 --> 01:45:55.568]  I don't think so.
[01:45:55.568 --> 01:45:56.449]  I don't think so.
[01:45:56.449 --> 01:45:56.890]  I don't think so.
[01:45:56.890 --> 01:45:58.351]  I don't think so.
[01:45:58.351 --> 01:45:58.712]  I don't think so.
[01:45:58.712 --> 01:45:59.593]  I don't think so.
[01:45:59.593 --> 01:45:59.933]  I don't think so.
[01:45:59.933 --> 01:46:00.373]  I don't think so.
[01:46:00.373 --> 01:46:00.994]  I don't think so.
[01:46:00.994 --> 01:46:01.475]  I don't think so.
[01:46:01.475 --> 01:46:01.815]  I don't think so.
[01:46:01.815 --> 01:46:02.295]  I don't think so.
[01:46:02.295 --> 01:46:02.796]  I don't think so.
[01:46:02.796 --> 01:46:03.176]  I don't think so.
[01:46:03.176 --> 01:46:03.697]  I don't think so.
[01:46:07.688 --> 01:46:15.933]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, now we just showed you a video clip of National Guard in Arizona at these checkpoints.
[01:46:15.933 --> 01:46:32.662]  And earlier in the show, we were playing the audio, the video's up on InfoWars.com, we'll play some of that in the background, of We Are Change Ohio in Kentucky, just at a community event all over the downtown city, blocking bridges, pointing machine guns at people off the tops of their Humvees.
[01:46:32.662 --> 01:46:35.664]  And the military were asked, they said, would you confiscate our guns?
[01:46:36.894 --> 01:46:42.200]  If you were to do so and they said, well, we'll sneeze there on air.
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:43.762]  That's a radio rarity.
[01:46:43.762 --> 01:46:49.709]  They will follow the orders if they're told to.
[01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:53.173]  So all of this is going on.
[01:46:53.173 --> 01:46:54.254]  All of this is happening.
[01:46:56.747 --> 01:47:01.852]  And for more than 20 years that we've confirmed this has been covertly going on.
[01:47:01.852 --> 01:47:11.300]  Now NORTHCOM admits they want to put 378,000 regular army troops on the streets of America, not just National Guard.
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:14.242]  They're putting local military liaison officers in.
[01:47:14.242 --> 01:47:16.084]  This is part of the global corporate takeover.
[01:47:16.084 --> 01:47:18.145]  This is incremental martial law.
[01:47:18.145 --> 01:47:21.728]  We have the report maximum alert US troops now occupying America.
[01:47:22.389 --> 01:47:25.771]  PrisonPlanet.com article from Paul Watson that boils all this down.
[01:47:25.771 --> 01:47:29.054]  It's essential that you go to your city councils, your county commissioners.
[01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:33.982]  And you point out that the Feds are federalizing those areas, and you're aware of it.
[01:47:33.982 --> 01:47:37.063]  Schenectady, New York, mayor has asked for quote, martial law.
[01:47:37.063 --> 01:47:38.024]  That's his quote.
[01:47:38.024 --> 01:47:39.224]  And for troops.
[01:47:39.224 --> 01:47:41.565]  The mayor of Birmingham has called for this.
[01:47:41.565 --> 01:47:42.906]  The Feds are giving him grants.
[01:47:42.906 --> 01:47:46.867]  The Feds are giving local police grants to take blood at checkpoints warrantlessly.
[01:47:46.867 --> 01:47:50.629]  Regular Marines are running checkpoints in California with the state police.
[01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:53.610]  In Tennessee, the military is running checkpoints with Homeland Security.
[01:47:53.610 --> 01:47:54.311]  Regular Army.
[01:47:55.242 --> 01:48:01.428]  This is really happening, and they're totally converting our society from a free society to a police state.
[01:48:01.428 --> 01:48:13.158]  With us until 8 after, when Dr. Stan Monteith joins us for the rest of this segment, the next two, is Luca and Bridget, we'll just use their first names, from Mojave County Minute Men and Mojave County Oath Keepers.
[01:48:13.158 --> 01:48:15.140]  They shot the video we just played
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.161]  Bye Alex, thank you.
[01:48:16.161 --> 01:48:16.801]  Bye Alex, my honor.
[01:48:29.574 --> 01:48:33.837]  Uh, were you just driving along and saw this or did you hear about this?
[01:48:33.837 --> 01:48:42.523]  Oh, we were just doing our little drive to the post office and we were just doing our daily route there and we were driving through.
[01:48:42.523 --> 01:48:48.407]  They were having a hot rod car show that they have every year and we're just driving down Andy Devine and
[01:48:49.594 --> 01:48:57.302]  You know, if it wasn't for our keen senses from the past few years from your show, I don't even know I would have ever paid attention.
[01:48:57.302 --> 01:49:07.271]  But here were National Guard guys, you know, on the street in their uniform waving the flags, and we just said, my God, it's really even happening here.
[01:49:07.271 --> 01:49:10.515]  Yeah, they had traffic directing flags.
[01:49:10.515 --> 01:49:10.575]  Yes.
[01:49:12.335 --> 01:49:15.756]  So we just, we flipped the UE as it shows in our video.
[01:49:15.756 --> 01:49:22.198]  We had our trusty little pen and I'm sorry it didn't come out so good, but we were just, it was just fast.
[01:49:22.198 --> 01:49:23.098]  And we just flipped around.
[01:49:23.098 --> 01:49:24.258]  No, I think it's a pretty good video.
[01:49:24.258 --> 01:49:25.559]  No, no, it's great.
[01:49:25.559 --> 01:49:26.359]  Good.
[01:49:26.359 --> 01:49:30.600]  Well, we, and we flipped around and we just asked the question that you saw on the video.
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:32.501]  You know, what were they doing here?
[01:49:34.206 --> 01:49:36.467]  And they just say, oh, we're just helping.
[01:49:36.467 --> 01:49:41.069]  And then notice all the way over in Kentucky, it's traffic control checkpoints.
[01:49:41.069 --> 01:49:45.031]  But then they say, we do assist officers if they need help arresting somebody.
[01:49:45.031 --> 01:49:46.052]  Exactly.
[01:49:46.052 --> 01:49:46.472]  Exactly.
[01:49:46.472 --> 01:49:47.713]  We just heard that.
[01:49:47.713 --> 01:49:52.475]  And the interesting thing also, after we came back, we left because we were still in the car.
[01:49:52.475 --> 01:49:53.636]  We couldn't hold up traffic.
[01:49:54.264 --> 01:50:12.729]  So we parked and we walked back about 20 minutes later and the part that isn't on the clip, we had spoken to the regular traffic guy and boy, he gave us, we were laughing, he gave us the regular line that you always give about, don't you love the truth boys?
[01:50:12.729 --> 01:50:14.350]  I mean he started going into that.
[01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:15.350]  He got very hostile.
[01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:18.172]  If you love the troops, you let them search your car!
[01:50:18.172 --> 01:50:22.234]  America's about checkpoints and troops on street corners!
[01:50:22.234 --> 01:50:25.617]  You're some kind of comic, and you don't want to turn your gun in?
[01:50:25.617 --> 01:50:38.705]  Yes, he got very ugly with us, and I asked him about Posse Comitatus, and he just, he said, well that, I said it was illegal what they were doing, according to Posse Comitatus, and he said, well that's your opinion.
[01:50:38.705 --> 01:50:39.766]  That's your opinion!
[01:50:39.766 --> 01:50:41.747]  We run this nation now!
[01:50:41.747 --> 01:50:44.269]  Every country in history falls to their own military.
[01:50:45.174 --> 01:50:46.735]  And that's now happening.
[01:50:46.735 --> 01:50:48.856]  They've occupied all these other countless nations.
[01:50:48.856 --> 01:50:51.037]  We're now being occupied.
[01:50:51.037 --> 01:50:54.679]  And they've got them everywhere with guns.
[01:50:54.679 --> 01:50:59.902]  In many cases, just training us that we're absolute slaves and training them to accept all this.
[01:50:59.902 --> 01:51:00.342]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.377 --> 01:51:10.585]  If you or your parents are 62 years of age or older and a homeowner, RMApply.com has a message that is vitally important for you and your family.

[01:51:46.527 --> 01:51:50.608]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:51:50.608 --> 01:51:51.488]  And we knew what to do.
[01:51:51.488 --> 01:51:52.609]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:51:52.609 --> 01:51:56.350]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[01:52:15.714 --> 01:52:17.277]  To tell their story.
[01:52:17.277 --> 01:52:25.791]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:26.158 --> 01:52:33.260]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:33.260 --> 01:52:36.420]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:36.420 --> 01:52:42.202]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:52:42.202 --> 01:52:45.282]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:56.610]  I suppose the government sponsored terror.
[01:52:56.610 --> 01:53:00.732]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:53:00.732 --> 01:53:11.314]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:53:11.314 --> 01:53:12.735]  Garden in a can.

[01:53:31.323 --> 01:53:32.743]  Garden in a Can.

[01:53:52.347 --> 01:53:52.387]  866-598-7396.
[01:54:00.865 --> 01:54:03.668]  Not this police department.
[01:54:03.668 --> 01:54:06.031]  Chain of command they do interact with them and they get
[01:54:12.205 --> 01:54:13.446]  Mission briefings.
[01:54:13.446 --> 01:54:14.787]  Mission briefings.
[01:54:14.787 --> 01:54:19.210]  Um, yeah, so like, we noticed that there's a difference.
[01:54:19.210 --> 01:54:22.872]  You guys are traffic control and then there's rover control or something like that.
[01:54:22.872 --> 01:54:27.235]  The guys with the big guns, like, chilling with the Humvees down there by the bridge.
[01:54:27.235 --> 01:54:28.936]  It's the exact same job.
[01:54:28.936 --> 01:54:33.139]  All we are here to do is to reinforce the Newport Police Department.
[01:54:33.139 --> 01:54:37.522]  Right, so do you have any police powers as far as, like, arrests?
[01:54:37.522 --> 01:54:37.802]  No.
[01:54:37.802 --> 01:54:38.803]  We do not arrest.
[01:54:38.803 --> 01:54:41.625]  Not unless asked to do so by Newport Police Department.
[01:54:43.746 --> 01:54:45.047]  Did you hear that military tactic?
[01:54:45.047 --> 01:54:47.389]  We don't arrest unless asked to by police.
[01:54:47.389 --> 01:54:51.553]  We're here to reinforce the police.
[01:54:51.553 --> 01:54:56.377]  We're talking to Luca and Bridget from Mojave County Minutemen.
[01:54:56.377 --> 01:54:59.159]  And their website, of course, you can check that out.
[01:54:59.159 --> 01:55:01.301]  We've got it up on screen for you here in a moment.
[01:55:02.475 --> 01:55:05.716]  Luca and Bridget, you've got the floor.
[01:55:05.716 --> 01:55:07.936]  I just discovered you're listeners to the show.
[01:55:07.936 --> 01:55:10.757]  No surprise that our great listeners are out there taking action.
[01:55:10.757 --> 01:55:22.420]  We need everybody to get little digital hidden recorders or pens or whatever and start documenting this because it's coming in from all over the country and Europe and England and Canada.
[01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:25.761]  Canada's announced they're going to have regular army patrolling the streets.
[01:55:25.761 --> 01:55:26.981]  This is a takeover.
[01:55:28.999 --> 01:55:31.381]  Alex, I would like to say something.
[01:55:31.381 --> 01:55:36.066]  I have other videos that I'm uploading, very disturbing, never happened before.
[01:55:36.066 --> 01:55:38.388]  One is on the YouTube channel that we have.
[01:55:38.388 --> 01:55:52.422]  Bottom line, for the first time on the valley where we live, we live in Mojave County, between Bullhead and Kingman, there were a few days ago military choppers flying low altitude.
[01:55:52.942 --> 01:56:00.046]  Well they have NLEO-9 focused on several states, but mainly Arizona, troops from 14 different nations to quote, fight American terrorists, foreign troops.
[01:56:12.834 --> 01:56:13.774]  Yes, I believe so.
[01:56:13.774 --> 01:56:18.656]  There is another video, very disturbing, of 60 seconds that I took with a digger pen, and the quality is much better.
[01:56:18.656 --> 01:56:27.398]  It was done almost three weeks ago, and bottom line, at the gas station in Kingman, there was a huge armored vehicle that with no insignia.
[01:56:27.398 --> 01:56:30.919]  I went around, and I was looking for some sort of a flag.
[01:56:30.919 --> 01:56:33.859]  There was no flag, and I was quite shocked.
[01:56:33.859 --> 01:56:39.661]  It was 8.30 in the morning, and now all this starts to connect the dots, and I start to think we have some sort of hotspot around here.
[01:56:41.929 --> 01:56:53.936]  I think we are a hotspot and Alex, just like you said, if people must realize this, what you were just saying, the acclimation operation, I mean, how much more obvious does it have to get?
[01:56:53.936 --> 01:57:01.981]  You know, when it hits your own town, when you see the National Guard reinforcing the local police department, and if you ask a question
[01:57:02.699 --> 01:57:08.640]  We were treated like, you know, they were going to arrest us or that we were from, you know, some domestic terrorists.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:11.301]  I mean, we were treated just terribly.
[01:57:11.301 --> 01:57:18.282]  And just to let you know, too, we just, right before we got on the show today, I just, I told Paul, I just called the National Guard.
[01:57:18.282 --> 01:57:19.102]  I've got the number.
[01:57:19.102 --> 01:57:20.343]  I called the National Guard.
[01:57:20.343 --> 01:57:21.743]  Yeah, we listened to the audio.
[01:57:21.743 --> 01:57:22.923]  You're clear.
[01:57:22.923 --> 01:57:28.724]  They're kind of garbled, but we can barely, so we're not going to air it, but we will link it up in a story.
[01:57:28.724 --> 01:57:31.125]  We're going to give it to Paul Watson to put in the overall article.
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:39.563]  Okay, what a shame because I was clear, but this lady was so irritated with me for calling and asking a question.
[01:57:39.563 --> 01:57:45.505]  She was so, and she ended up hanging up on me because she didn't want to talk about posse comitatus.
[01:57:45.505 --> 01:57:48.446]  She just didn't want to talk to me.
[01:57:48.446 --> 01:57:53.388]  Well, slaves aren't allowed to ask questions in America.
[01:57:53.388 --> 01:57:54.369]  Exactly.
[01:57:54.369 --> 01:57:55.649]  And how dare you?
[01:57:55.649 --> 01:57:57.890]  But you watch all these troop videos from around the country.
[01:57:57.890 --> 01:58:00.311]  A lot of places they're searching bags, searching cars.
[01:58:01.681 --> 01:58:08.029]  They sit there on the street corners as families walk by going like it's cobras slithering by.
[01:58:08.029 --> 01:58:10.753]  They're just like, terrorists, terrorists.
[01:58:10.753 --> 01:58:15.599]  It's like being in an airport with just the troops just looking at you like you're about to attack them.
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.001]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.626 --> 01:58:50.689]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:50.689 --> 01:58:54.911]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.911 --> 01:58:56.913]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.913 --> 01:59:05.438]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.438 --> 01:59:11.001]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:11.001 --> 01:59:12.622]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.842 --> 01:59:19.367]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.367 --> 01:59:30.416]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.416 --> 01:59:31.197]  That's right.
[01:59:31.197 --> 01:59:33.759]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:33.759 --> 01:59:35.341]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:59:37.282 --> 01:59:37.742]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.841 --> 02:00:08.603]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.603 --> 02:00:10.365]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.365 --> 02:00:11.946]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.946 --> 02:00:13.508]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.508 --> 02:00:17.712]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.712 --> 02:00:22.837]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.837 --> 02:00:30.525]  Final segment with our guest, the great folks from the Mojave County Minutemen and Mojave County Oath Keepers.
[02:00:32.847 --> 02:00:35.630]  This is just like an army massing on your border.
[02:00:35.630 --> 02:00:37.652]  In 1939, the Germans began to mass on the Polish border.
[02:00:37.652 --> 02:00:39.574]  The Poles said, why are you going to attack us?
[02:00:39.574 --> 02:00:41.276]  Hitler said, I'm not going to attack.
[02:00:41.276 --> 02:00:45.520]  Then Hitler staged a terror attack against his own military base on the Polish border.
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:48.443]  Gleiwitz blamed it on the Poles and invaded.
[02:00:48.443 --> 02:00:49.985]  That's now declassified in public.
[02:00:51.587 --> 02:01:01.435]  And just all these years, secret military operations, paying off county commissioners, paying off mayors, the army coming with satchels, in some cases up to a million bucks, buying off mayors.
[02:01:01.435 --> 02:01:03.477]  And I went, why would the army be doing that?
[02:01:03.477 --> 02:01:10.903]  And I found out they'd done that in third world countries, mainly Latin America and Middle East and Africa, before they would overall take them over.
[02:01:12.116 --> 02:01:27.509]  And so I just, and then I talked to military people, got declassified documents, talked to congressmen, talked to JAG officers, retired judge advocate generals, agreeing with me that this was preparation for martial law, and now suddenly troops all over, open announcements, we were right.
[02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:32.671]  It's totally criminal, but they're going to do acclimation drills that look reasonable.
[02:01:32.671 --> 02:01:35.133]  Oh, we're helping search people going in the football stadium.
[02:01:35.133 --> 02:01:36.914]  Oh, we're helping with the Kentucky Derby.
[02:01:36.914 --> 02:01:38.214]  Oh, we're helping on the subways.
[02:01:38.214 --> 02:01:40.156]  Oh, we're helping in your small town.
[02:01:40.156 --> 02:01:43.237]  Oh, the Army is helping the local police.
[02:01:43.237 --> 02:01:45.038]  Oh, they're helping the local high school.
[02:01:45.038 --> 02:01:47.559]  Oh, they're helping the local charity.
[02:01:47.559 --> 02:01:49.581]  And the local green
[02:01:51.039 --> 02:01:54.681]  Assessment group in Austin that's going to control the carbon system.
[02:01:54.681 --> 02:02:02.025]  It's a former black ops commander from the army runs Austin and he said this is our mission in Austin.
[02:02:02.025 --> 02:02:03.065]  I mean they're everywhere.
[02:02:03.065 --> 02:02:07.388]  They are taking over America and the higher-ups know what they're doing.
[02:02:07.388 --> 02:02:09.949]  The low levels don't.
[02:02:09.949 --> 02:02:11.790]  In closing comments, Luca and Bridget.
[02:02:12.645 --> 02:02:14.466]  Okay, I want to say one thing.
[02:02:14.466 --> 02:02:17.788]  First of all, uh, I have no permit to say my first and last name.
[02:02:17.788 --> 02:02:19.449]  All I want to do is spell it out right.
[02:02:19.449 --> 02:02:21.190]  My name is Luca Zanna.
[02:02:21.190 --> 02:02:25.232]  Z as in Zebra, A as in America, and N as in Nancy, Nancy, America.
[02:02:25.232 --> 02:02:27.253]  Because there's a bunch of things we can do here.
[02:02:27.253 --> 02:02:29.975]  Let them know that we are not afraid.
[02:02:29.975 --> 02:02:31.196]  Okay, we are not afraid.
[02:02:31.196 --> 02:02:32.296]  We're going to expose them.
[02:02:32.296 --> 02:02:36.379]  Because if we feel like we're going to... If they think that we're afraid, it's like a dog.
[02:02:36.379 --> 02:02:38.360]  It nips you in the butt, then it's going to go for the trot.
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:40.822]  What did the sheriff say to you, Luca?
[02:02:55.754 --> 02:02:57.476]  Well, I'm sure he's a nice man.
[02:02:57.476 --> 02:02:58.757]  I must admit that he's a good guy.
[02:02:58.757 --> 02:02:59.798]  We have a good report.
[02:02:59.798 --> 02:03:01.640]  But now we know what he says.
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:02.641]  It's what he's going to do.
[02:03:02.641 --> 02:03:05.845]  Because, you know, he said pretty much he agrees with me.
[02:03:05.845 --> 02:03:12.632]  I asked him about if he has anything missing, in part, about an exception in the posse committatus, why the international guard could be used.
[02:03:13.633 --> 02:03:22.424]  We have to point out, just like they use marines at the mass shooting in Alabama, we have to point out that this is wrong or they'll set the precedent it's right and I agree with you.
[02:03:22.424 --> 02:03:25.088]  We gotta go to city councils everywhere preemptively.
[02:03:25.088 --> 02:03:29.133]  Because notice all these mayors are saying they want martial law.
[02:03:29.133 --> 02:03:31.416]  Arkansas, New York, it's happening.
[02:03:31.716 --> 02:03:33.758]  I ask a favor to all the Infowarriors.
[02:03:33.758 --> 02:03:36.482]  This is, uh, from our, we need to help each other.
[02:03:36.482 --> 02:03:40.146]  And, uh, we need to call the National Guard office here because they hang up on us.
[02:03:40.146 --> 02:03:41.267]  And that's not right.
[02:03:41.267 --> 02:03:42.228]  Bridget, give them phone numbers.
[02:03:42.228 --> 02:03:46.092]  Alex, can I, can I give the number because it's just shocking how I was treated.
[02:03:46.092 --> 02:03:46.553]  Can I give that number?
[02:03:47.153 --> 02:03:56.756]  Yes, give their number and say you may be ignorant and not know you're engaged in treason and an acclamation operation, but be polite, but say we are going to stand for the Republic.
[02:03:56.756 --> 02:03:57.376]  Yes, give out.
[02:03:57.376 --> 02:03:59.937]  Exactly, because that's exactly what was going on.
[02:03:59.937 --> 02:04:00.777]  The number is 928-773-3161.
[02:04:07.332 --> 02:04:07.852]  Give it again.
[02:04:07.852 --> 02:04:08.473]  928-773-3161.
[02:04:08.473 --> 02:04:15.177]  That's the Kingman, Arizona National Guard.
[02:04:15.177 --> 02:04:16.798]  And folks should call Camp Mabry.
[02:04:16.798 --> 02:04:19.880]  I know they're involved in all sorts of black ops here in town.
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:21.121]  I've got that confirmed.
[02:04:21.121 --> 02:04:22.481]  Let them know we know what they're doing.
[02:04:22.481 --> 02:04:23.682]  We're not stupid.
[02:04:23.682 --> 02:04:25.043]  Exactly.
[02:04:25.043 --> 02:04:25.944]  And you know what, Alex?
[02:04:25.944 --> 02:04:26.704]  One last thing.
[02:04:26.704 --> 02:04:28.145]  That is so important.
[02:04:28.624 --> 02:04:34.245]  We were, I hate to say this, but we were kind of stupid until about four years ago, until we found you.
[02:04:34.245 --> 02:04:37.726]  And I know everybody says this, but you've kind of saved our lives.
[02:04:37.726 --> 02:04:41.567]  We've completely changed our lives in the last four years.
[02:04:41.567 --> 02:04:50.929]  And these people, like the woman who answers the phone at the National Guard, she was shocked to hear a citizen calling and using the words like Masi Kamatata.
[02:04:50.929 --> 02:04:53.589]  People need to do it.
[02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:56.290]  Let me say body on the other side, and we're going to go to Dr. Stan Monteith.
[02:04:56.290 --> 02:04:57.650]  We'll go ahead and get him online now.
[02:04:57.650 --> 02:04:58.050]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:04.011]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.011 --> 02:05:07.633]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.633 --> 02:05:12.215]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.215 --> 02:05:17.798]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:18.098 --> 02:05:22.861]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.861 --> 02:05:26.484]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.484 --> 02:05:31.307]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.307 --> 02:05:37.871]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.871 --> 02:05:39.793]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.293 --> 02:05:43.497]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.497 --> 02:05:48.002]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:05:48.002 --> 02:05:49.724]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:05:49.724 --> 02:05:50.165]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.165 --> 02:05:50.225]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.225 --> 02:05:50.785]  Don't wait.
[02:05:50.785 --> 02:05:51.226]  Call today.
[02:06:00.757 --> 02:06:08.505]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:06:08.505 --> 02:06:14.592]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:06:14.592 --> 02:06:17.255]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:06:17.535 --> 02:06:23.819]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:23.819 --> 02:06:27.881]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:27.881 --> 02:06:33.264]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.504 --> 02:06:35.584]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.584 --> 02:06:37.345]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.345 --> 02:06:39.865]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:39.865 --> 02:06:44.586]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.586 --> 02:06:48.287]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.287 --> 02:06:51.408]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:51.408 --> 02:06:53.308]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:53.308 --> 02:06:55.429]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:07:01.124 --> 02:07:04.126]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.126 --> 02:07:09.451]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.451 --> 02:07:11.512]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.512 --> 02:07:16.516]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.516 --> 02:07:17.417]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.677 --> 02:07:18.798]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.798 --> 02:07:20.699]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:21.759]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.759 --> 02:07:23.960]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:25.301]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.301 --> 02:07:26.842]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.842 --> 02:07:32.104]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.104 --> 02:07:35.686]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.686 --> 02:07:39.148]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.508 --> 02:07:40.728]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.728 --> 02:07:41.629]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.629 --> 02:07:42.729]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.729 --> 02:07:43.670]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.670 --> 02:07:44.750]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:47.811]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.811 --> 02:07:48.331]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:48.331 --> 02:07:49.992]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.992 --> 02:07:51.112]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:51.112 --> 02:07:54.033]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.318 --> 02:08:13.981]  I was just listening to the ad that ran.
[02:08:13.981 --> 02:08:21.267]  It's a local, so a lot of stations probably didn't hear it, but it's the eFoods Direct ad that I cut a year and a half ago.
[02:08:21.267 --> 02:08:28.292]  And I said, will you have storable foods or will you be forced to go to the inoculation centers?
[02:08:28.292 --> 02:08:36.678]  Now how did I make an ad a year and a half ago saying they would be trying to forcibly inoculate you with inoculation centers now being announced?
[02:08:36.678 --> 02:08:37.899]  Now as they ease it out there.
[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:53.092]  Because we got the secret FEMA training manuals three years ago, a year and a half before it was declassified, of the tens of thousands of clergy being secretly hired by FEMA, and the training manual said, tell them it's of God to turn your guns in.
[02:08:53.092 --> 02:08:58.036]  It's of God to go to the FEMA camp and be inoculated, to submit.
[02:08:58.036 --> 02:09:00.698]  It's of God to do all of this.
[02:09:00.698 --> 02:09:03.761]  And so we then knew that was one of their main battle plans.
[02:09:04.702 --> 02:09:10.107]  Then, in January, we saw them telling local police, get ready for martial law, the flu's coming.
[02:09:10.107 --> 02:09:18.494]  That's why we knew in January, rolled into April, and then it came out, we knew it was level six, three months before it became mainstream news.
[02:09:18.494 --> 02:09:25.480]  And we've warned so many people about what's happening, that it's going to be hard for the globalists to carry this out.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:31.685]  We're going to go to Dr. Stan Monteith in one moment, but finishing up with Luca and Bridget from Mojave County Minute Men and Mojave County Oath Keepers.
[02:09:34.531 --> 02:09:36.392]  And final comments from both of you.
[02:09:36.392 --> 02:09:37.592]  Alex, I want to say one thing.
[02:09:37.592 --> 02:09:40.373]  We need to be proactive, as you know, as you say.
[02:09:40.373 --> 02:09:44.994]  Information is the first weapon, and then we need also start to make this information active in the community.
[02:09:44.994 --> 02:09:48.215]  Otherwise, if we keep it to ourselves, it's not the only thing.
[02:09:48.215 --> 02:09:52.876]  One important thing we're doing this Saturday and Sunday, and this is part of the knowledge we must know.
[02:09:52.876 --> 02:09:55.337]  We have apple seed coming in Cayman.
[02:09:55.337 --> 02:09:59.518]  It's free class of a clinic, how to become a rifleman.
[02:09:59.878 --> 02:10:02.679]  Pray for the best, but hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
[02:10:24.588 --> 02:10:44.850]  Exactly, and just what, for me, it's just like Luca said, I'm going to do apple seed, you know, we're aware, we open our mouths, we ask questions, we're not afraid, we learn to shoot, we don't shut up, we're learning everything we can, we're spreading the word, and if the New World Order thinks that they're going to be able to take us over without a fight,
[02:10:45.450 --> 02:10:50.397]  I think they miscalculated that there's too many people just like us from coast to coast.
[02:10:50.397 --> 02:10:53.181]  They're going to have a big fat fight on their hands if they want to.
[02:10:53.181 --> 02:10:54.603]  Well, they're going to stage events, though.
[02:10:54.603 --> 02:10:56.686]  They're going to kill their own troops and blame it on us.
[02:10:56.686 --> 02:10:58.969]  They're going to bomb federal buildings and blame it on us.
[02:10:58.969 --> 02:11:01.092]  We're going into a very dark time, but remember...
[02:11:01.733 --> 02:11:05.336]  We know they did it, just like Hitler with Gleiwitz and Reichstag.
[02:11:05.336 --> 02:11:06.877]  We know they're staging the events.
[02:11:06.877 --> 02:11:08.898]  We know they've released the flu.
[02:11:08.898 --> 02:11:10.860]  We know they're staging all of this.
[02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:13.402]  This is only another big drill, in my opinion.
[02:11:13.402 --> 02:11:14.443]  God bless you.
[02:11:14.443 --> 02:11:16.764]  We'll continue to check in with you as things develop.
[02:11:16.764 --> 02:11:17.605]  Take care of yourselves.
[02:11:17.605 --> 02:11:18.606]  We love you, Alex.
[02:11:18.606 --> 02:11:19.687]  We love you, Alex.
[02:11:19.687 --> 02:11:21.188]  We love you taking action as well.
[02:11:21.188 --> 02:11:25.411]  And folks, go to city councils, go to county commissioners.
[02:11:25.411 --> 02:11:26.472]  I remember in 1999,
[02:11:29.895 --> 02:11:33.719]  The SWAT team came in and threatened me at a County Commissioner's meeting not to speak.
[02:11:33.719 --> 02:11:36.121]  It was on video, on TV.
[02:11:36.121 --> 02:11:37.803]  I said, I'm going to speak.
[02:11:37.803 --> 02:11:45.150]  Then after the SWAT team commander, who was in the same County Commissioner building, asked me, was actually across the street, he said, please come to my office.
[02:11:45.150 --> 02:11:46.831]  He said, look, I'm a Vietnam vet.
[02:11:46.831 --> 02:11:48.373]  There's not going to be troops in Austin.
[02:11:48.373 --> 02:11:50.675]  There's no martial law coming.
[02:11:50.675 --> 02:11:52.277]  He said, I would never allow that.
[02:11:52.277 --> 02:11:52.917]  Lieutenant Beck.
[02:11:53.717 --> 02:11:57.024]  They later got mad at him and ran him out, because he said things like this.
[02:11:57.024 --> 02:11:58.307]  And I said, listen to me.
[02:11:58.307 --> 02:11:59.770]  They're paying off police chiefs.
[02:11:59.770 --> 02:12:01.293]  And I gave him videos of it.
[02:12:01.293 --> 02:12:03.157]  Police chiefs I interviewed, they tried to pay off.
[02:12:03.157 --> 02:12:04.140]  San Antonio police chief.
[02:12:05.003 --> 02:12:07.345]  And I said, Delta Force will visit you.
[02:12:07.345 --> 02:12:09.706]  They're visiting all the major cities now.
[02:12:09.706 --> 02:12:11.788]  Austin was about 700,000 people then.
[02:12:11.788 --> 02:12:13.949]  I said, they're going to come to you soon.
[02:12:13.949 --> 02:12:14.790]  He laughed at me.
[02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:18.332]  A couple months later, he calls up and says, can you come to my office?
[02:12:18.332 --> 02:12:20.474]  He goes, here's Delta Force's card.
[02:12:20.474 --> 02:12:22.555]  He said, everything you said is true.
[02:12:22.555 --> 02:12:23.316]  Tell me more.
[02:12:24.156 --> 02:12:26.499]  And then he said, how do you know all this being so young?
[02:12:26.499 --> 02:12:29.584]  So I was like 24 or something.
[02:12:29.584 --> 02:12:30.525]  I don't remember how old I was.
[02:12:30.525 --> 02:12:32.227]  Yeah, about 24, 25.
[02:12:32.227 --> 02:12:34.891]  I looked really young and he said, who are you with?
[02:12:34.891 --> 02:12:36.553]  Are you with the government?
[02:12:36.553 --> 02:12:38.315]  Is this a thing in the government fighting each other?
[02:12:38.315 --> 02:12:40.539]  And I said, no, I'm with the American people.
[02:12:42.336 --> 02:12:49.683]  I mean, they just can't believe that citizens would be involved and informed in running counterintelligence against this global corporate takeover.
[02:12:49.683 --> 02:12:51.384]  Look, somebody's got to do it!
[02:12:51.384 --> 02:12:55.127]  I never claim to have all the answers or be the best at this.
[02:12:55.127 --> 02:12:59.871]  We're just a ragtag group going toe-to-toe with the New World Order and their PSYOPs.
[02:12:59.871 --> 02:13:03.735]  But if you just start understanding, everything they say is the opposite.
[02:13:03.735 --> 02:13:05.957]  Everything they say is a lie or a distortion.
[02:13:07.023 --> 02:13:18.457]  I've got mainstream news we're going to cover with Dr. Monteith admitting that they chose a plastic of thousands of plastic formulas for worldwide adoption in the 60s that sterilizes the men.
[02:13:20.352 --> 02:13:24.413]  The White House Science Czar admits they're putting the stuff in the water.
[02:13:24.413 --> 02:13:28.153]  Folks, the military and the police, I'm not your enemy.
[02:13:28.153 --> 02:13:33.454]  I don't have some macho, head up thing, fantasy of having war with you.
[02:13:33.454 --> 02:13:36.435]  I hate what you do, though.
[02:13:36.435 --> 02:13:37.455]  I hate your ignorance.
[02:13:37.455 --> 02:13:40.355]  I hate your denial.
[02:13:40.355 --> 02:13:41.836]  I just wish you'd research.
[02:13:41.836 --> 02:13:43.616]  This is important.
[02:13:43.616 --> 02:13:47.477]  This is real.
[02:13:47.477 --> 02:13:48.977]  Let's go to Dr. Stan Monteith.
[02:13:50.219 --> 02:13:55.521]  He's led a delegation of physicians from Santa Cruz County to the House of Delegates of the California Medical Association for 10 years.
[02:13:55.521 --> 02:13:59.182]  He's led the battle with an organized medicine in California to address the AIDS epidemic.
[02:13:59.182 --> 02:14:01.283]  This is an old bio.
[02:14:01.283 --> 02:14:06.985]  He's a talk show host on Genesis, written a bunch of best-selling books, made videos, made films.
[02:14:06.985 --> 02:14:14.588]  He's a medical doctor, been doing this for over 40 years, fighting the New World Order, an expert on the eugenics, an expert on AIDS being engineered.
[02:14:15.528 --> 02:14:17.449]  And an expert on what's happening with this flu.
[02:14:17.449 --> 02:14:20.491]  For the Balance of the Hour, Dr. Stan Monteith joins us.
[02:14:20.491 --> 02:14:22.392]  Doctor, it's good to have you on with us.
[02:14:22.392 --> 02:14:24.054]  It's great to be with you, Alex.
[02:14:24.054 --> 02:14:33.599]  And this is an exciting time because, you know, I'm getting all sorts of emails from people in the healthcare industry who are saying, look, they're threatening to take away my job.
[02:14:33.599 --> 02:14:38.743]  They're threatening to take away my pension if I won't take this vaccine.
[02:14:38.743 --> 02:14:40.143]  And I say, do not take it.
[02:14:40.143 --> 02:14:42.545]  Just tell them you're going to sue them, get the other people
[02:14:45.185 --> 02:14:48.746]  Hunter Monteef?
[02:14:48.746 --> 02:14:51.146]  All right, we just lost his phone line.
[02:14:51.146 --> 02:14:55.627]  Yes, they've denied the last month that they're ordering people to take shots and it's forced.
[02:14:55.627 --> 02:14:57.248]  Now they're having to admit it slowly.
[02:14:57.248 --> 02:15:02.409]  But again, they deny it to the last minute so we can't build opposition.
[02:15:02.409 --> 02:15:05.970]  If an army's about to attack you, they want to sneak up.
[02:15:05.970 --> 02:15:09.530]  They don't want you to know they're coming.
[02:15:09.530 --> 02:15:11.711]  And this is what they're doing.
[02:15:12.967 --> 02:15:20.433]  While we're getting Dr. Monteith back on the line, MAAC organizes Pittsburgh security for G20.
[02:15:20.433 --> 02:15:23.996]  It says the FBI and Secret Service are running it along with the Army.
[02:15:23.996 --> 02:15:26.958]  Now we saw this in 99, in Seattle.
[02:15:26.958 --> 02:15:30.982]  When I knew the Army was running this two weeks before, I said they're going to stage riots.
[02:15:30.982 --> 02:15:38.127]  And then it came out, the police had to admit later, 50 anarchists were flown in, funded by a big foundation.
[02:15:38.127 --> 02:15:41.750]  This is all in my film, Police State 2 The Takeover, that we released in 2000.
[02:15:43.919 --> 02:15:46.200]  You want to see the documentation?
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:49.660]  And they flew them in.
[02:15:49.660 --> 02:15:55.642]  And they had them attack police before the news cameras to then set the pretext to attack everybody.
[02:15:55.642 --> 02:15:57.202]  Delta Force ran that as well.
[02:15:57.202 --> 02:16:01.143]  That was in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Seattle Times.
[02:16:01.143 --> 02:16:04.044]  It was in all three of the papers in Seattle.
[02:16:04.044 --> 02:16:06.644]  Seattle Times, Post-Intelligencer, and the other one.
[02:16:06.644 --> 02:16:08.985]  That's all in Police State 2.
[02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:11.521]  The takeover.
[02:16:11.521 --> 02:16:12.742]  This is the takeover.
[02:16:12.742 --> 02:16:16.285]  And they know incremental is hard to beat.
[02:16:16.285 --> 02:16:18.327]  It's like a frog in cold water.
[02:16:18.327 --> 02:16:19.208]  He won't jump out.
[02:16:19.208 --> 02:16:20.849]  You turn it up slowly, he'll boil to death.
[02:16:20.849 --> 02:16:22.271]  You throw him in hot water, he'll jump out.
[02:16:23.325 --> 02:16:24.646]  That old analogy.
[02:16:24.646 --> 02:16:28.990]  And the troops are brainwashed, the police are brainwashed, the public's brainwashed.
[02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:34.654]  And I told you over a decade ago, the big takeover would come when they fully bankrupted the economy.
[02:16:34.654 --> 02:16:37.416]  Dr. Monteith, we lost you there, and your phone's real low.
[02:16:37.416 --> 02:16:38.457]  Can you speak up?
[02:16:38.457 --> 02:16:39.818]  Okay, how is that?
[02:16:39.818 --> 02:16:40.259]  Good, good.
[02:16:40.259 --> 02:16:40.759]  Start over.
[02:16:40.759 --> 02:16:42.600]  You're saying an exciting time to be alive.
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:44.342]  Well, it certainly is.
[02:16:44.342 --> 02:16:47.925]  But, you know, really with this whole thing of this swine flu,
[02:16:48.545 --> 02:16:51.828]  Everybody, or most people, have missed this article.
[02:16:51.828 --> 02:17:06.441]  It appeared in the New York Times on the 12th of September, and they quote a number of leading epidemiologists who have said that, you know, that they got a great vaccine, but the problem is the epidemic is going to be over.
[02:17:06.441 --> 02:17:10.725]  It's going to be peaked out before the vaccine is available in the middle of next month.
[02:17:11.647 --> 02:17:13.948]  And that really is true.
[02:17:13.948 --> 02:17:22.273]  In fact, I emailed or just talked to Mr. Hartman and hopefully he'll have those figures off the CDC webpage.
[02:17:22.273 --> 02:17:25.936]  You can see that it's already peaked at its highest level.
[02:17:25.936 --> 02:17:33.040]  They call it widespread level 5 in almost 20 states as of about two weeks ago.
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:35.421]  It's already peaked and declining.
[02:17:35.421 --> 02:17:38.403]  The incidence of the new infections in California
[02:17:38.965 --> 02:17:45.189]  This disease is so mild that most people who get it don't even know they've been ill.
[02:17:45.189 --> 02:17:48.611]  What they've done is a bait-and-switch on the vaccine.
[02:17:48.611 --> 02:17:58.017]  The article that they utilized to demonstrate that the vaccine was effective was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on the 10th of September.
[02:17:58.017 --> 02:18:02.780]  It's called, A Trial of Influenza, a H1N1-2009 monovalent adjuvanted vaccine.
[02:18:07.290 --> 02:18:18.635]  In other words, they used an adjuvanted vaccine in Australia to prove that the vaccine works, but they're not going to give an adjuvanted vaccine in the United States, at least.
[02:18:18.635 --> 02:18:25.198]  They're afraid to, because they know there's so much opposition to it, and because it's not licensed in the United States.
[02:18:25.198 --> 02:18:29.880]  So, they used one vaccine and said, gee, look how great it works!
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:33.142]  And then, of course, they're going to use a different vaccine in the United States.
[02:18:33.459 --> 02:18:44.693]  Well, Doctor, I want to walk through all this with you, but also from your years of researching this Eugenics Order of Darkness, Brotherhood of Darkness, as your book title states it, what do you think the master plan here?
[02:18:44.693 --> 02:18:50.360]  Is this just a giant drill for federalization and nation-states to go under UN Level 6 control?
[02:18:51.406 --> 02:18:53.969]  Or could this be something bigger?
[02:18:53.969 --> 02:18:59.896]  It may be a trial, it may be an effort to make $40 billion for the pharmaceutical industry.
[02:18:59.896 --> 02:19:04.421]  Certainly they're going to do tremendous damage to a large segment of our population.
[02:19:04.915 --> 02:19:14.237]  Because the CDC is mandating that this vaccine, or at least suggesting the vaccine, be given to every pregnant woman.
[02:19:14.237 --> 02:19:23.078]  Whereas if you read the material from the manufacturers of the vaccine here in the United States and throughout the world, they say, don't give it to pregnant women.
[02:19:23.078 --> 02:19:27.959]  The CDC is saying it ought to be given to all children starting at two years of age.
[02:19:27.959 --> 02:19:31.740]  The manufacturers are saying, don't give it to children less than four years of age.
[02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:33.600]  They get into all sorts of problems with it.
[02:19:34.136 --> 02:19:36.738]  And they don't want to give us one shot of the vaccine.
[02:19:36.738 --> 02:19:45.806]  They want to give two shots of the swine flu vaccine and two shots of the influenza vaccine for that seasonal regulator.
[02:19:45.806 --> 02:19:46.427]  Well, stay there.
[02:19:46.427 --> 02:19:49.289]  You're a medical doctor, an expert on eugenics.
[02:19:49.289 --> 02:19:52.492]  I want to get into their larger master plan as well and take phone calls.
[02:19:52.492 --> 02:19:57.236]  Dr. Stan Monteith of Radio Liberty, his ministry, joins us today.
[02:19:57.236 --> 02:19:57.837]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.414 --> 02:20:02.314]  You worry.
[02:20:02.314 --> 02:20:04.375]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:20:04.375 --> 02:20:07.035]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:20:07.035 --> 02:20:09.156]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:20:09.156 --> 02:20:10.756]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:20:10.756 --> 02:20:14.357]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:20:14.357 --> 02:20:19.578]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:20:19.578 --> 02:20:23.558]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:20:23.558 --> 02:20:25.239]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:20:25.239 --> 02:20:28.159]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[02:20:28.159 --> 02:20:31.080]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:20:31.604 --> 02:20:40.250]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:20:40.250 --> 02:20:45.073]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[02:20:45.073 --> 02:20:49.096]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[02:20:49.096 --> 02:20:52.998]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:52.998 --> 02:20:54.499]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:54.499 --> 02:20:56.220]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:21:01.798 --> 02:21:02.819]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:21:02.819 --> 02:21:08.364]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:21:08.364 --> 02:21:08.905]  I get it.
[02:21:08.905 --> 02:21:18.534]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:21:18.534 --> 02:21:19.675]  That's not what's happening.
[02:21:19.935 --> 02:21:28.400]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:31.802]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:21:31.802 --> 02:21:36.065]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:21:36.065 --> 02:21:37.665]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:21:37.665 --> 02:21:41.067]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:21:41.067 --> 02:21:45.230]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:21:45.430 --> 02:21:46.331]  You should, too.
[02:21:46.331 --> 02:21:47.471]  Find out what they know.
[02:21:47.471 --> 02:21:54.056]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:21:54.056 --> 02:21:54.336]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:54.336 --> 02:21:56.638]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:56.638 --> 02:21:58.619]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:58.619 --> 02:22:08.186]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:22:08.186 --> 02:22:09.867]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:22:10.799 --> 02:22:12.361]  But who is the enemy?
[02:22:12.361 --> 02:22:13.162]  Bin Laden.
[02:22:13.162 --> 02:22:14.123]  This is his M.O.
[02:22:14.123 --> 02:22:15.525]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:22:15.525 --> 02:22:17.527]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:22:17.527 --> 02:22:24.675]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:22:24.675 --> 02:22:25.156]  Some U.S.
[02:22:25.156 --> 02:22:30.802]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:22:31.483 --> 02:22:34.984]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:22:34.984 --> 02:22:37.145]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:23:01.323 --> 02:23:04.844]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[02:23:04.844 --> 02:23:06.765]  Now, going green can save money.
[02:23:06.765 --> 02:23:12.327]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[02:23:12.327 --> 02:23:20.350]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[02:23:20.350 --> 02:23:29.653]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives.
[02:23:29.953 --> 02:23:33.154]  Increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.

[02:23:38.336 --> 02:23:43.857]  Find out why our customers tell us the Renaissance Charger is the only battery charger they will ever use.

[02:23:47.720 --> 02:23:48.701]  That's r-charge.com.
[02:23:48.701 --> 02:23:49.301]  Or call us at 989-637-4179.
[02:23:49.301 --> 02:23:49.822]  That's 989-637-4179.
[02:23:49.822 --> 02:23:51.604]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[02:23:51.604 --> 02:23:54.006]  Medical doctor, Dr. Stan Monteith, joins us for the rest of the hour.
[02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:14.481]  We're going to take some of your phone calls on the swine flu, your questions, your comments.
[02:24:14.481 --> 02:24:23.124]  When we open the phones up, Doctor, unlimited amounts, as many as we can take, nurses and husbands and wives of nurses being ordered to take it or they're fired.
[02:24:23.124 --> 02:24:24.324]  Nurses who've been fired.
[02:24:24.324 --> 02:24:27.265]  We're going to have a lady on today, but she kind of chickened out.
[02:24:27.265 --> 02:24:28.085]  I don't blame her.
[02:24:28.085 --> 02:24:30.366]  But we have the letters with her being threatened.
[02:24:30.366 --> 02:24:30.926]  It's in the news.
[02:24:30.926 --> 02:24:32.386]  They're now being fired.
[02:24:32.386 --> 02:24:34.107]  But there's not even a law.
[02:24:34.107 --> 02:24:38.348]  They're using regulations and Obama's lying, saying they're not trying to make this mandatory.
[02:24:39.208 --> 02:24:48.111]  Open discussions on CNN and Fox about using the military to forcibly inoculate us, but you gave us the CDC, Center for Disease Control map.
[02:24:48.111 --> 02:24:49.891]  We'll put that up on screen.
[02:24:49.891 --> 02:24:52.112]  They admit it's supposed to peak middle of next month.
[02:24:52.112 --> 02:24:53.412]  It's basically already peaked.
[02:24:53.412 --> 02:24:55.073]  It doesn't even go up much.
[02:24:55.073 --> 02:24:57.314]  This is a very mild flu, as you said.
[02:24:57.314 --> 02:24:59.614]  So why do they want us to take this vaccine so bad?
[02:24:59.614 --> 02:25:04.156]  Because it contains mercury, and mercury is toxic.
[02:25:04.156 --> 02:25:05.556]  It destroys the fertility.
[02:25:05.556 --> 02:25:08.037]  It controls, destroys the mind, destroys the
[02:25:08.891 --> 02:25:15.553]  The endocrine system, there is no safe dose of mercury, yet they're going to give it.
[02:25:15.553 --> 02:25:23.535]  They want everybody to take a swine flu shot with a full dose of mercury, a regular flu shot with a regular dose of mercury.
[02:25:23.535 --> 02:25:27.197]  They want every pregnant woman to take these shots.
[02:25:27.197 --> 02:25:28.597]  They want to give two shots.
[02:25:29.738 --> 02:25:36.462]  Of swine flu and two shots of the regular influenza vaccine to every child less than 10 years of age.
[02:25:36.462 --> 02:25:41.865]  Is this not precedent setting where they're ordering medical workers to take the standard flu shot?
[02:25:41.865 --> 02:25:43.566]  Oh, it absolutely is.
[02:25:43.566 --> 02:25:45.286]  I don't know about the standard flu shot.
[02:25:45.286 --> 02:25:46.607]  They've always recommended it.
[02:25:46.607 --> 02:25:47.948]  No, no, they're ordering that.
[02:25:47.948 --> 02:25:48.848]  I've got the letters.
[02:25:48.848 --> 02:25:51.570]  I've got the letters from major hospital chains.
[02:25:51.570 --> 02:25:53.731]  They are firing people that don't take it.
[02:25:54.171 --> 02:26:01.679]  Well, basically, of course, this is going to produce terrible damage, first of all, because it does contain the mercury.
[02:26:01.679 --> 02:26:05.943]  A lot of people never have gotten the flu until they take a flu shot.
[02:26:05.943 --> 02:26:11.088]  They've been recommending for years that medical personnel take the seasonal flu.
[02:26:11.088 --> 02:26:13.570]  Now, that's not the H1N1.
[02:26:13.570 --> 02:26:18.455]  It's the seasonal, and most people won't take it because they know it makes them sick and it doesn't do any good.
[02:26:19.594 --> 02:26:24.517]  The vast majority of doctors in this country do not believe in influenza.
[02:26:24.517 --> 02:26:32.802]  And that's in national polls, and everybody mouth-to-mouth, person-to-person, knows that I took the flu shot and almost died.
[02:26:32.802 --> 02:26:34.903]  I mean, my mother, that happened to her.
[02:26:34.903 --> 02:26:38.305]  Everybody I know has their horrible flu shot story.
[02:26:38.305 --> 02:26:41.747]  And of course, this promotes Gilead-Rey disease.
[02:26:41.747 --> 02:26:45.429]  It produces all sorts of medical problems.
[02:26:45.948 --> 02:26:55.075]  And they have been trying to sell it to the American people, and yet so many people have been crippled or have permanent damage to their immunity.
[02:26:55.075 --> 02:27:00.598]  You have to understand that the whole idea of vaccines is to stimulate the immune system.
[02:27:00.598 --> 02:27:05.122]  And this is one reason why we have so much autoimmune disease in America.
[02:27:05.122 --> 02:27:12.807]  We're talking about rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Sjogren's disease, certain types of thyroiditis, chronic bowel symptoms.
[02:27:12.807 --> 02:27:15.489]  It's because they've overstimulated the immune system.
[02:27:15.834 --> 02:27:16.274]  Eczema?
[02:27:46.274 --> 02:27:49.036]  There's been an explosion of autoimmune disease.
[02:27:49.036 --> 02:27:52.699]  There's an explosion of eczema and asthma, as you point out.
[02:27:52.699 --> 02:27:57.683]  And then, of course, the mercury in the vaccine attacks the brain.
[02:27:57.683 --> 02:28:13.356]  This is why, today, in the United States, one in six children, according to the CDC, their own figures, one in six children has either a learning disability or a neurodevelopmental abnormality.
[02:28:13.957 --> 02:28:15.939]  One in six American children.
[02:28:15.939 --> 02:28:19.061]  You don't see this in children who don't take the vaccine.
[02:28:19.061 --> 02:28:22.564]  They're destroying the minds and lives of our children.
[02:28:22.564 --> 02:28:26.568]  Which is what the top eugenicists like H.G.
[02:28:26.568 --> 02:28:32.433]  Wells and Bertrand Russell and John V. Holdren said they would do.
[02:28:32.433 --> 02:28:33.093]  Absolutely.
[02:28:33.093 --> 02:28:42.261]  In fact, if you read, and we have the book, people can get it, it's called The Impact of Science on Society, written by Bertrand Russell.
[02:28:42.757 --> 02:28:45.880]  Any comment there?
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:50.204]  By diet, injections and injunctions.
[02:28:50.204 --> 02:28:58.212]  We will so alter the mind of the child that they will not be able to differ from the things that they were taught by the schoolmaster.
[02:28:58.212 --> 02:29:00.934]  By diet, injections and injunctions.
[02:29:00.934 --> 02:29:02.456]  What are they going to put in the diet?
[02:29:05.026 --> 02:29:18.411]  Aspartame in the diet that has an impact on the mind, but we could talk for hours on that, produces cancer, but then they put the mercury that they're giving our kids in the injections.
[02:29:18.411 --> 02:29:20.632]  They know that this destroys the mind.
[02:29:20.632 --> 02:29:30.436]  Do you realize that today in America, we have 5 million people with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and all of China with four times our population.
[02:29:30.436 --> 02:29:32.517]  They've only got a little over five and a half million.
[02:29:33.459 --> 02:29:34.539]  And it gets worse than that.
[02:29:34.539 --> 02:29:35.440]  Stay there, doctor.
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:38.001]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:38.001 --> 02:29:38.841]  It gets worse than that.
[02:29:38.841 --> 02:29:41.222]  Our diabetes level, everything.
[02:29:41.222 --> 02:29:45.544]  We're going to talk about that with medical doctor, Dr. Stan Monteith, on the other side.
[02:29:45.544 --> 02:29:51.786]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.786 --> 02:29:53.187]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.187 --> 02:29:55.708]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.708 --> 02:29:58.409]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.794 --> 02:30:05.037]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.037 --> 02:30:07.039]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.039 --> 02:30:15.566]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.566 --> 02:30:21.111]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.111 --> 02:30:22.732]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:22.972 --> 02:30:29.476]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.476 --> 02:30:40.544]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.544 --> 02:30:41.304]  That's right.
[02:30:41.304 --> 02:30:43.886]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[02:32:03.432 --> 02:32:05.854]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:32:05.854 --> 02:32:08.517]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:32:08.517 --> 02:32:09.698]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:32:09.698 --> 02:32:11.399]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:32:11.399 --> 02:32:14.061]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[02:32:14.061 --> 02:32:17.925]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR.
[02:32:27.549 --> 02:32:32.457]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:32:36.227 --> 02:32:37.688]  How dare you?
[02:32:37.688 --> 02:32:43.751]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:32:43.751 --> 02:32:46.632]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:32:46.632 --> 02:32:53.116]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of the... Truth Rising.

[02:33:12.922 --> 02:33:17.784]  Is it getting better?
[02:33:17.784 --> 02:33:23.107]  Or do you feel the same?
[02:33:23.107 --> 02:33:25.428]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[02:33:25.428 --> 02:33:33.432]  You've got someone to blame You said one love
[02:33:35.188 --> 02:33:39.090]  Mike, Chris, Susan, Dan, Mark.
[02:33:39.090 --> 02:33:40.311]  Dan's calling from the Philippines.
[02:33:40.311 --> 02:33:42.311]  We're going to go to your calls with Dr. Monteith here in a few minutes.
[02:33:42.311 --> 02:33:50.115]  We're going to have him back up next week if he can do it to get more into eugenics with us.
[02:33:50.115 --> 02:33:53.177]  Doctor, separately from the whole flu situation,
[02:33:54.701 --> 02:33:56.202]  I mean, you mentioned Alzheimer's.
[02:33:56.202 --> 02:33:59.964]  They now have this early onset of it when you're 35, 40 years old.
[02:33:59.964 --> 02:34:04.867]  You mentioned that we have more brain disorders than people in China and more Alzheimer's.
[02:34:04.867 --> 02:34:05.948]  I mean, they're killing us.
[02:34:05.948 --> 02:34:06.788]  We know it's designed.
[02:34:06.788 --> 02:34:08.129]  They stated they would do it.
[02:34:08.129 --> 02:34:11.331]  They write giant textbooks on it like eco-science bragging about it.
[02:34:15.546 --> 02:34:17.348]  How do we defeat this?
[02:34:17.348 --> 02:34:22.993]  They control the main churches, they control the corporations, they don't just want a world government.
[02:34:22.993 --> 02:34:30.299]  That's the means to the end, as John P. Holder in White House Science Czar says, as he states, a planetary government, a planetary regime.
[02:34:30.299 --> 02:34:34.083]  Dr. Pianka says it, Peter Singer says it, they all say it.
[02:34:34.083 --> 02:34:34.763]  Ehrlich says it.
[02:34:35.844 --> 02:34:36.604]  George Bush Sr.'
[02:34:36.584 --> 02:34:37.284]  's advisor.
[02:34:37.284 --> 02:34:42.426]  They're going to have a world government to carry out our orderly extermination, testing soft kill weapons.
[02:34:42.426 --> 02:34:51.628]  As we die, they train as it's normal, they pose as the saviors, they have marches and marathons to fund research, which is actually funding how to kill us.
[02:34:51.628 --> 02:34:54.669]  You're a medical doctor who discovered this decades ago.
[02:34:54.669 --> 02:35:01.831]  It appears, all the evidence shows, they're expanding their eugenics operations to more of a hot kill, fast kill now,
[02:35:02.951 --> 02:35:07.174]  And the Reuters has got a big article out saying, oh, there'll be millions of deaths this year.
[02:35:07.174 --> 02:35:09.596]  People will think they take the shot and die.
[02:35:09.596 --> 02:35:11.557]  But no, there'll be no adverse reactions.
[02:35:11.557 --> 02:35:12.658]  It's impossible.
[02:35:12.658 --> 02:35:18.942]  They're telling doctors if someone dies after they take it or becomes paralyzed, the shot didn't do it.
[02:35:18.942 --> 02:35:28.409]  It appears they're preemptively studying how to roll this out successfully, just like Gardasil, and kill and maim us and sterilize us and then get away with it.
[02:35:29.192 --> 02:35:44.264]  Well, I think that probably the vaccine that they're going to give in Europe will be more dangerous than the one that they're going to give here, because the one they're going to use in Europe is a squalene, one that's licensed to give to people over 65.
[02:35:44.264 --> 02:35:48.248]  They're going to give it to the whole population.
[02:35:48.248 --> 02:35:52.391]  And then, of course, there's an article in Global Research, which is usually very, very
[02:35:52.961 --> 02:35:53.021]  Yes.
[02:36:07.359 --> 02:36:20.591]  Well, we've had medical workers at the vaccine companies call in, and I've seen reports that, no, there's different versions, but, no, they have the Indralucan, or whatever it's called, that Dr. Horowitz saw yesterday.
[02:36:20.591 --> 02:36:23.553]  They're saying that it is in the vaccines, or at least some of them.
[02:36:23.553 --> 02:36:25.215]  It may very well be.
[02:36:25.215 --> 02:36:30.059]  We can't trust them, because they have put things into the vaccines in the past.
[02:36:30.851 --> 02:36:33.593]  Well, they will say, well, we didn't know it was there.
[02:36:33.593 --> 02:36:34.954]  Well, they can say that.
[02:36:34.954 --> 02:36:38.736]  But when they did know it was there, they continued to distribute it.
[02:36:38.736 --> 02:36:43.359]  And I'm talking about specifically the polio vaccine, the original polio vaccine.
[02:36:43.359 --> 02:36:48.902]  And when they found out it had a cancer virus in it, they continued disseminating it.
[02:36:48.902 --> 02:36:54.746]  They've contaminated the whole population of the world, about 30% of our population today.
[02:36:55.595 --> 02:37:01.901]  Still carries that cancer vaccine, that cancer virus that was in the original polio vaccine.
[02:37:01.901 --> 02:37:12.872]  One reason why the incidence of bone cancer, and brain cancer, and lymphoma, and mesothelioma, and ependymoma, and medulloblastoma in children has gone up.
[02:37:12.872 --> 02:37:18.137]  And when they actually, when they biopsy them, they find evidence of this cancer-producing virus
[02:37:18.513 --> 02:37:23.435]  That was introduced into our population through the original polio vaccine.
[02:37:23.435 --> 02:37:33.699]  And no doubt by design, German news is reporting that they're growing it again in the same monkeys that have the SV40 for the virus stock in the European vaccines.
[02:37:33.699 --> 02:37:37.260]  Well, God help those people over there, supposedly.
[02:37:37.260 --> 02:37:39.761]  And all we know is what they tell us, Alex.
[02:37:39.761 --> 02:37:45.863]  Supposedly, the American vaccine is going to be grown in the yolk of eggs.
[02:37:45.863 --> 02:37:46.984]  But then we get the chicken.
[02:37:47.697 --> 02:37:48.318]  I think so.
[02:38:03.868 --> 02:38:08.491]  Well, what about how for five years the FDA approved it's now in wide use?
[02:38:08.491 --> 02:38:24.701]  Not just a radiation of the meat, but they're now spraying in Latin, I can't pronounce it, that means bacteria eating virus, they grow it in giant vaccine tanks with other viruses and RNA and are now spraying it on most meats we get at the store.
[02:38:24.701 --> 02:38:30.305]  Well, I'm very concerned about what they're doing to our food supply.
[02:38:30.305 --> 02:38:32.406]  It will lead to terrible problems.
[02:38:32.816 --> 02:38:45.145]  Certainly we know that the genetically modified corn that they have introduced across America and of course it is contaminating our entire corn supply here.
[02:38:45.145 --> 02:38:46.786]  Chickens are a lot smarter than people.
[02:38:46.786 --> 02:38:48.268]  Chickens won't eat it.
[02:38:48.268 --> 02:38:52.951]  We know that it actually causes infertility in pigs.
[02:38:52.951 --> 02:38:56.634]  We know that studies have been done in Russia that shows it causes
[02:38:57.682 --> 02:38:58.522]  We're good to go.
[02:39:25.854 --> 02:39:33.320]  Hundreds of millions of dollars to store seeds in vast vaults up above the Arctic Circle on a little island there.
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:45.929]  And nobody's asked, why are they storing all these seeds for corn and for wheat and for all the other vegetables and things, you know, in these vaults where they'll be permanently frozen?
[02:39:45.929 --> 02:39:47.850]  And it should be very obvious.
[02:39:47.850 --> 02:39:51.233]  All of these people are dedicated to population control.
[02:39:51.233 --> 02:39:55.636]  And they want the seeds for when they start all over again.
[02:39:56.118 --> 02:39:57.399]  They've stated this, in fact...
[02:39:59.207 --> 02:40:08.371]  The MI6 officer, he was OSS, who wrote the James Bond novels that were made into movies, he wrote Moonraker.
[02:40:08.371 --> 02:40:13.673]  And in that, the global elite and this head banker want to kill everybody on Earth.
[02:40:13.673 --> 02:40:18.275]  They, the eugenics pure, go to a space station.
[02:40:18.275 --> 02:40:20.596]  While they kill everybody on Earth, they're going to come back.
[02:40:20.596 --> 02:40:23.518]  But in the real government documents, they're not going to space.
[02:40:23.518 --> 02:40:24.778]  They've got the underground bases.
[02:40:24.778 --> 02:40:27.079]  And I saw a Reuters article two weeks ago.
[02:40:27.079 --> 02:40:28.040]  In fact, we can pull that up.
[02:40:29.057 --> 02:40:29.497]  U.N.
[02:40:29.497 --> 02:40:31.138]  chief or U.N.
[02:40:31.138 --> 02:40:33.060]  head visits Seed Vault.
[02:40:33.060 --> 02:40:39.003]  And it's this photo of the big armored mountain and the troops guarding the ark.
[02:40:39.003 --> 02:40:41.605]  And then you read the transhumanists.
[02:40:41.605 --> 02:40:45.527]  They admit, which are the eugenicists, that they do plan to kill us.
[02:40:45.527 --> 02:40:50.370]  And they're putting in the police state grid to then carry out the medical mayhem and murder.
[02:40:50.370 --> 02:40:53.572]  And I want the troops and military to know something.
[02:40:53.572 --> 02:40:55.653]  I know this is probably going to go ahead and go to fruition.
[02:40:57.239 --> 02:40:59.501]  Just know, you're going to be judged at your own hand.
[02:40:59.501 --> 02:41:03.484]  The masters you've served for are going to murder you and your family as well.
[02:41:03.484 --> 02:41:05.465]  Go ahead and laugh!
[02:41:05.465 --> 02:41:12.451]  Just remember, as you're dying with your family years from now, you asked for it, you were warned, you wanted to be part of it.
[02:41:12.451 --> 02:41:13.792]  Dr. Monteith?
[02:41:13.792 --> 02:41:17.815]  Men and women become accomplices to the evils they fail to oppose.
[02:41:18.419 --> 02:41:30.926]  And the people within the military who are carrying out the orders of our leaders who have killed... I don't know if you've ever read the article by the shoe-thrower, or the man, of course, who shoes George Bush.
[02:41:30.926 --> 02:41:35.128]  He talked about the million Iraqis who were killed.
[02:41:35.128 --> 02:41:37.749]  He talked about the million widows there.
[02:41:37.749 --> 02:41:42.592]  He talked about the five million orphans in Iraq today.
[02:41:42.592 --> 02:41:45.793]  He talked about the suffering of the people, how they've turned...
[02:41:47.316 --> 02:41:48.617]  Arab is against one another.
[02:41:48.617 --> 02:42:06.247]  One time, the Sunnis, the Shias, the Christians got along well together, but since the Americans came in, the Christians have been driven out, and of course, everybody is everybody else's throat, and we are sending in Asian provocateurs to commit acts of terrorism to maintain this division.
[02:42:06.247 --> 02:42:13.151]  But this is all because the American people haven't had the courage to stand up.
[02:42:13.681 --> 02:42:22.049]  Oh, they voted for Barack Obama, who is, of course, expanding the war in Afghanistan today, because he is a servant of the elite.
[02:42:22.049 --> 02:42:26.494]  And we're talking about the tryout for commission, as you do as well.
[02:42:26.494 --> 02:42:37.144]  The Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderbergers, is a financial elite led by David Rockefeller, who has a different worldview, because he worships a different god.
[02:42:37.771 --> 02:42:45.556]  Until people understand that there is a powerful spiritual force, a Luciferian force, behind everything going on today.
[02:42:45.556 --> 02:42:47.997]  And they really hate humanity.
[02:42:47.997 --> 02:42:49.618]  And that's why they're storing the seeds.
[02:42:51.069 --> 02:42:58.135]  There are videos of Maurice Strong, as you know, saying we're going to destroy the entire industrial base through the world government.
[02:42:58.135 --> 02:42:59.316]  I mean, they're doing it now.
[02:42:59.316 --> 02:43:09.925]  Doctor, I remember when I was first on your show back in 99 when I was out there covering Operation Urban Warrior in Oakland with the Marines trying to confiscate our guns on video.
[02:43:09.925 --> 02:43:11.807]  Look how much has happened now.
[02:43:11.807 --> 02:43:13.828]  Everywhere they've got troops on the streets.
[02:43:13.828 --> 02:43:17.712]  I mean, the reports, it's just intensifying incrementally.
[02:43:18.871 --> 02:43:26.159]  Well, but on the other hand, you know, more and more Americans are beginning to know what's going on.
[02:43:26.159 --> 02:43:30.924]  I think that the other side is frightened, and I think they're going to start moving very, very rapidly.
[02:43:30.924 --> 02:43:40.474]  I think that this march that we had in Washington, D.C., I think it was the 12th of September, and probably between a million and a million and a half people were there.
[02:43:41.298 --> 02:43:46.043]  I think that this really has been disturbed because this was an amazing thing.
[02:43:46.043 --> 02:43:55.093]  In fact, there would have been a lot more people there if they hadn't turned back the buses and the cars and people trying to come and join in that demonstration.
[02:43:55.740 --> 02:44:00.261]  You are waking up an awful lot of people, you and Cynthia, and a few of the others.
[02:44:00.261 --> 02:44:05.003]  Yeah, but the problem is they then put the operative Glenn Beck in there to lead them.
[02:44:05.003 --> 02:44:08.484]  We wake the people up and then we turn them over to Glenn Beck.
[02:44:08.484 --> 02:44:10.585]  Well, he's as phony as a three dollar bill.
[02:44:10.585 --> 02:44:17.927]  He would not... Everybody has to understand that Glenn Beck would not be on national television if he was telling the truth.
[02:44:17.927 --> 02:44:23.489]  So, basically he's going to say some things that are absolutely right, you agree with, but that's the old
[02:44:24.045 --> 02:44:25.326]  He's got a great switch technique.
[02:44:25.326 --> 02:44:32.088]  He gets in there, he gets your confidence, and then he gives you a lot of information that is frankly not true.
[02:44:32.088 --> 02:44:35.749]  And that's why I think people, you know, look to you for leadership.
[02:44:35.749 --> 02:44:37.730]  They look to you for reliable information.
[02:44:37.730 --> 02:44:45.373]  I appreciate so much you're getting that information out, and you must be ruffling a lot of feathers because you're getting so much opposition.
[02:44:45.373 --> 02:44:47.794]  People are saying, you've got to get that guy off the air.
[02:44:47.794 --> 02:44:52.656]  They're saying that locally here in Santa Cruz, and of course, hopefully our road to
[02:44:53.106 --> 02:44:53.667]  We're good.
[02:45:10.540 --> 02:45:10.860]  I don't know.
[02:45:26.778 --> 02:45:28.980]  Why, the epidemic is going to be just about over.
[02:45:28.980 --> 02:45:37.065]  It's already peaking out as we speak today, but they've got 195 million doses of the vaccine.
[02:45:37.065 --> 02:45:38.106]  What are they going to do with it?
[02:45:38.106 --> 02:45:39.687]  They've got to give it to the people.
[02:45:39.687 --> 02:45:45.391]  That's why they want to double up on the amount of mercury they're going to give to our children.
[02:45:45.391 --> 02:45:50.995]  Every child less than 10 years of age, they want to give them not one, but two swine from
[02:45:52.376 --> 02:45:58.158]  Absolutely, and the key point you make here from the CDC's own website is it's now going to be peaking in the next couple weeks.
[02:45:58.158 --> 02:46:01.260]  Why then for something incredibly mild are they doing this?
[02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:04.801]  They're just fear-mongering this event to be able to expand their control.
[02:46:04.801 --> 02:46:10.724]  But going back to radio stations, plug the local station I'm on.
[02:46:10.724 --> 02:46:14.606]  It's KOMY here in the Monterey Bay area.
[02:46:14.606 --> 02:46:17.667]  You're doing a great job at getting your information out.
[02:46:19.681 --> 02:46:21.462]  But very, very few people object to it.
[02:46:21.462 --> 02:46:25.005]  Most people really appreciate what you're saying.
[02:46:25.005 --> 02:46:36.492]  Well, I know that MZ, the owner of those stations, has had me on two different ones, and I know it's been very popular, but he has said there are people viciously, a minority, saying, get me off.
[02:46:36.492 --> 02:46:39.714]  I want to explain something to those people.
[02:46:39.714 --> 02:46:40.515]  Ten years ago,
[02:46:41.803 --> 02:46:46.364]  Or about nine years ago, I was offered a national radio slot.
[02:46:46.364 --> 02:46:48.164]  I was told I would be the next Glenn Beck.
[02:46:48.164 --> 02:46:49.684]  Glenn Beck wasn't on the scene yet.
[02:46:49.684 --> 02:46:54.485]  They said, we need a young Rush Limbaugh, no more New World Order, no more fellow reserve.
[02:46:54.485 --> 02:46:56.826]  You reach out and grab people on the radio.
[02:46:56.826 --> 02:47:01.987]  And of course, as a journalist, they said, this is a private meeting.
[02:47:01.987 --> 02:47:05.608]  You're not going to discuss this, non-disclosure, but this is the offer.
[02:47:05.608 --> 02:47:07.388]  And then I had some other offers along the road.
[02:47:08.539 --> 02:47:16.650]  And if I wanted to be on 500, 600 radio stations and be making 50 million dollars a year like Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh, I could have done it.
[02:47:16.650 --> 02:47:18.132]  The money means nothing.
[02:47:18.132 --> 02:47:24.180]  When you know they're putting cancer viruses in vaccines, when you know they've designed the plastics to leach,
[02:47:24.861 --> 02:47:52.834]  uh... injured uh... estrogen mimickers on record as bbc today to sterilize you when you know you have no future out what why would i take fifty million dollars and go live in a mansion and sit there a lot of people all day the truth is what matters we have no future this is a cold-blooded killing machine this isn't just some boss hogg offering me fifty million to hang out with him in roscoe pico train this is there's no survival this is making a deal with the devil
[02:47:53.274 --> 02:47:53.794]  Absolutely not.
[02:47:53.794 --> 02:47:55.115]  Not even for a million dollars.
[02:48:14.719 --> 02:48:17.022]  Freedom is the most important thing we have.
[02:48:33.801 --> 02:48:45.515]  It hurts me at a level of wanting to reach new people to warn them for all those women listening who can go Google Gardasil deaths and find out how many people it's killing so they don't kill their daughter or maim them.
[02:48:45.515 --> 02:48:47.677]  So when you try to take me off the air...
[02:48:48.698 --> 02:48:51.941]  It is on you, murdering those young girls.
[02:48:51.941 --> 02:48:55.965]  And if you want that on your soul, my God, just be forewarned.
[02:48:55.965 --> 02:48:57.866]  So I want to make that clear.
[02:48:57.866 --> 02:49:02.431]  That there's nothing I'd like better, Dr. Monteith, than to quit this show and stop doing this.
[02:49:02.431 --> 02:49:03.892]  This is a burden.
[02:49:03.892 --> 02:49:07.855]  And so people who think they get me by attacking me or lying about me or doing that,
[02:49:08.576 --> 02:49:12.477]  And they attack the station owners that have courage to put me on.
[02:49:12.477 --> 02:49:16.438]  You folks don't even know where I'm coming from, and so I just feel sorry for you.
[02:49:16.438 --> 02:49:17.959]  Dr. Monteith, go ahead.
[02:49:17.959 --> 02:49:19.940]  Well, I admire what you do, Alex.
[02:49:19.940 --> 02:49:20.940]  You do it so well.
[02:49:20.940 --> 02:49:25.841]  You do it better than anybody else I know, because you speak with such intensity.
[02:49:25.841 --> 02:49:33.944]  People have to understand, as Alex said, first of all, the H1N1 infections, swine flu, is a very mild disease.
[02:49:33.944 --> 02:49:37.205]  In fact, in the initial study that they did over in
[02:49:38.210 --> 02:49:53.801]  In Australia, where they actually, this is the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on the 10th of September, and this is the vaccine trial that they're using to justify using the vaccine in the United States.
[02:49:53.801 --> 02:50:03.047]  It tested an entirely different vaccine in Australia, the one that was at the adjuvantivity, the squalene adjuvant.
[02:50:03.047 --> 02:50:07.110]  But what was really so interesting about the study, although they didn't play it up,
[02:50:07.662 --> 02:50:08.062]  Well, I don't know.
[02:50:30.512 --> 02:50:31.432]  Stay there, got him right.
[02:51:01.431 --> 02:51:05.176]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dry guy.
[02:51:05.176 --> 02:51:12.344]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[02:51:12.344 --> 02:51:17.651]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[02:51:17.651 --> 02:51:19.513]  Lucky for you, there's the freeze-dry guy.
[02:51:19.693 --> 02:51:26.195]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[02:51:26.195 --> 02:51:31.136]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[02:51:31.136 --> 02:51:40.479]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[02:51:40.479 --> 02:51:47.341]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[02:51:47.341 --> 02:51:47.881]  Comparably,
[02:51:48.061 --> 02:51:52.367]  The advances made in food storage from the World War II era till now are equally great.

[02:52:01.761 --> 02:52:03.742]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:52:03.742 --> 02:52:07.363]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:52:07.363 --> 02:52:09.244]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:52:09.244 --> 02:52:12.906]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:52:12.906 --> 02:52:18.668]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:52:18.668 --> 02:52:22.610]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:53:02.205 --> 02:53:09.949]  AirAndAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[02:53:09.949 --> 02:53:18.554]  AirAndAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[02:53:18.554 --> 02:53:23.297]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[02:53:23.297 --> 02:53:27.239]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[02:53:27.239 --> 02:53:31.361]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[02:53:31.621 --> 02:53:32.161]  I think so.
[02:54:01.255 --> 02:54:06.604]  We're going to talk to Mike in Mass, Chris in Maryland.
[02:54:14.116 --> 02:54:15.117]  Dan in the Philippines.
[02:54:15.117 --> 02:54:21.345]  We'll go to Dan here in just a moment for the next two segments and I'm going to get into a host of other issues in the next hour.
[02:54:21.345 --> 02:54:32.219]  What Dr. Monteith keeps trying to point out here while I'm interrupting is, there's just so many facets that are popping into my mind here, is what I've already read the mainstream news, it's admitted that
[02:54:33.266 --> 02:54:38.429]  Upwards of 30% of people where they test for the antibodies already have it in many nations.
[02:54:38.429 --> 02:54:39.829]  It's very mild.
[02:54:39.829 --> 02:54:40.910]  So what is this all about?
[02:54:40.910 --> 02:54:44.832]  Well, if they want to have a scare, they have to monger for months.
[02:54:44.832 --> 02:54:52.956]  And so clearly this is a way to just sell vaccines, set the precedent to make people take them, and get everybody into this medicalized tyranny.
[02:54:52.956 --> 02:54:54.076]  Dr. Monteef.
[02:54:54.076 --> 02:55:01.020]  Well, I've never seen in all those 47 years I've had this, such a dramatic coordinated campaign.
[02:55:02.185 --> 02:55:07.969]  By every means of communication to convince us we've got to take this H1N1 vaccine.
[02:55:07.969 --> 02:55:13.053]  So, obviously, for anybody out there listening to this, you can realize the control they have.
[02:55:13.053 --> 02:55:18.717]  They control literally almost every major media outlet in the United States.
[02:55:18.717 --> 02:55:20.979]  I mean, why would they be talking about this?
[02:55:20.979 --> 02:55:30.386]  This is such a mild disease that, as Alex says, most people don't even know they've had the disease in the study which they used to justify giving the vaccine.
[02:55:30.782 --> 02:55:31.103]  That's good.
[02:55:44.131 --> 02:55:45.132]  Hello, hello.
[02:55:45.132 --> 02:55:46.253]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:56:13.433 --> 02:56:24.463]  Hello, just wanted to let, you know, I just wanted to let the audience know about a new, or not new, it's a tool for the internet to, you know, when they talk to their friends, you know, if everything, everyone says they're connected, they say how.
[02:56:24.463 --> 02:56:31.750]  You know, there's some things out there called NNDB.com, like no name database or however you want to say it.
[02:56:31.750 --> 02:56:34.773]  NNDB.com and Muckety.com, M-U-C-K-E-T-Y.com.
[02:56:38.061 --> 02:56:40.804]  And they provide a vast resource of how everyone is connected.
[02:56:58.371 --> 02:56:59.752]  Crazy people connected in there.
[02:56:59.752 --> 02:57:12.877]  You can see... Yeah, for folks that don't know, Dr. Horowitz has filed an affidavit with the FBI showing a criminal racketeering conspiracy with a partnership from New York and the Rockefellers behind this whole inoculation hoax.
[02:57:12.877 --> 02:57:14.758]  I appreciate your call.
[02:57:14.758 --> 02:57:22.061]  Dr. Monteith, the Rockefellers, I mean, eugenics, every time we turn over some evil rock, the Rockefellers are under it.
[02:57:22.833 --> 02:57:24.254]  They certainly are.
[02:57:24.254 --> 02:57:28.097]  And first, they've been at it for, you know, about a part of a century.
[02:57:28.097 --> 02:57:31.960]  And it goes all the way back, first old John T. and then his son.
[02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:45.950]  And these people, at the beginning of the 20th century, in the early 1900s, were already funding the laboratory at Cold Harbor, which was busy creating new diseases at that time.
[02:57:45.950 --> 02:57:50.734]  They always have wanted to eliminate the majority of the people in the world, and of course,
[02:57:51.195 --> 02:57:59.644]  Basically all one has to do is read the scriptures and find out that the rider of the pale horse is going to kill a quarter of the population.
[02:58:00.452 --> 02:58:02.833]  A quarter of the population of the world?
[02:58:02.833 --> 02:58:11.034]  I have the writings of Barbara Marks Hubbard, who is deeply involved in Luciferianism, who wrote a book called The Revelation, the book of co-creation.
[02:58:11.034 --> 02:58:25.718]  She didn't write it, it was channeled to her by the demonic spirit, which she said, we're going to kill a quarter of the population of the world, but that is not your job, that is ours, my dear, because we are the writers of Pale Horse Death.
[02:58:26.158 --> 02:58:34.104]  Then they have the Earth First Battalion in the military, they've got a whitewash coming out, Men Who Stare at Goats with George Clooney about it.
[02:58:34.104 --> 02:58:36.265]  We'll be right back in one minute with more calls.
[02:58:36.265 --> 02:58:41.469]  Dr. Stan Monteef, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:41.469 --> 02:58:46.152]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:49.361 --> 02:58:50.962]  Radio Network!
[02:58:50.962 --> 02:58:54.365]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.365 --> 02:58:57.987]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:57.987 --> 02:59:02.551]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.551 --> 02:59:03.972]  These emergency backup systems
[02:59:04.212 --> 02:59:07.095]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:59:07.095 --> 02:59:13.220]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.220 --> 02:59:16.843]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.843 --> 02:59:21.647]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.647 --> 02:59:28.213]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.213 --> 02:59:30.175]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:59:30.635 --> 02:59:33.837]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:59:33.837 --> 02:59:38.340]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:59:38.340 --> 02:59:40.142]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:59:40.142 --> 02:59:40.522]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.522 --> 02:59:40.582]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.582 --> 02:59:41.122]  Don't wait.
[02:59:41.122 --> 02:59:41.743]  Call today.
[02:59:41.743 --> 02:59:42.863]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.863 --> 02:59:44.064]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:06.309 --> 03:00:10.830]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:00:10.830 --> 03:00:11.510]  to 3 p.m.
[03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:12.450]  Central Standard Time.
[03:00:12.450 --> 03:00:13.171]  We're here live.
[03:00:13.171 --> 03:00:15.931]  I'm going to break down.
[03:00:15.931 --> 03:00:23.553]  Coming up, our maximum alert dealing with the troops being deployed all over the United States, what's happening with the flu, your calls, and a lot more.
[03:00:23.553 --> 03:00:27.013]  Dr. Stan Monteef of Radioliberty.com is our guest.
[03:00:27.013 --> 03:00:30.394]  A lot of great books and videos and materials available at Radioliberty.com.
[03:00:30.394 --> 03:00:32.375]  We're very thankful for him joining us.
[03:00:32.375 --> 03:00:34.435]  I want to get him back up about eugenics in the near future.
[03:00:35.526 --> 03:00:39.989]  In fact, Doc, I keep meaning to come out and interview you for a new eugenics film I'm working on.
[03:00:39.989 --> 03:00:42.551]  We need to set that up.
[03:00:42.551 --> 03:00:45.073]  I'm also interviewing Dr. Blalock for it.
[03:00:45.073 --> 03:00:47.334]  Let's talk to Mike in Mass.
[03:00:47.334 --> 03:00:48.335]  Mike, you're on the air.
[03:00:48.335 --> 03:00:48.815]  Go ahead.
[03:00:48.815 --> 03:00:50.236]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:50.236 --> 03:00:50.697]  Hi, Doc.
[03:00:50.697 --> 03:00:51.537]  How are you doing?
[03:00:51.537 --> 03:00:53.058]  I'm doing fine.
[03:00:53.058 --> 03:00:54.019]  That's good.
[03:00:54.019 --> 03:01:02.605]  I'm a nursing student in Massachusetts, and I brought up to my team the first day of classes on the Massachusetts Bill 2020 about forced inoculations.
[03:01:03.274 --> 03:01:13.356]  And she advised me that it'd be wise if I didn't tell the other students about this bill and the effects of it.
[03:01:13.356 --> 03:01:18.358]  Yeah, well they have the bill to come in your home and forcibly take your children and inoculate you.
[03:01:18.358 --> 03:01:20.938]  That's on mainstream news and you're not supposed to talk about it though?
[03:01:20.938 --> 03:01:23.519]  Because in America you're not allowed to?
[03:01:23.519 --> 03:01:28.680]  Exactly, but I took the liberty upon myself to take the video that was posted on your site
[03:01:29.224 --> 03:01:42.913]  I'm with the judge yesterday, and I went on Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, all those globalism websites, and used it against them, and started spreading the word, and I call all Massachusetts residents to do the same.
[03:01:42.913 --> 03:01:43.934]  We have to use this technology.
[03:01:43.934 --> 03:01:47.956]  But hold on, who told you you're not supposed to talk to people?
[03:01:47.956 --> 03:01:50.618]  The dean of my department of the nursing program.
[03:01:50.618 --> 03:01:55.241]  And in America, you can't talk about what's on the news or what's being debated in the newspaper?
[03:01:55.241 --> 03:01:56.802]  That's the new freedom?
[03:01:56.802 --> 03:01:57.343]  That's the freedom.
[03:01:58.761 --> 03:02:02.643]  I went against her orders, as a true patriot does.
[03:02:02.643 --> 03:02:04.484]  I mean, who are Dr. Monteith?
[03:02:04.484 --> 03:02:08.565]  Who are all these people that just gleefully serve evil?
[03:02:08.565 --> 03:02:17.709]  Well, unfortunately, a lot of them just want to go along and get along, but they think that, you know, well, if they just go along, that this is not going to affect them.
[03:02:17.709 --> 03:02:24.112]  They don't understand that if they serve these evil forces, eventually they themselves will be destroyed.
[03:02:25.592 --> 03:02:27.093]  I saw Germany.
[03:02:27.093 --> 03:02:32.356]  I was a military officer, medical officer, and I was in Germany after the Second World War.
[03:02:32.356 --> 03:02:34.657]  I saw their cities in rubble.
[03:02:34.657 --> 03:02:40.921]  I mean, total destruction of many of the major cities over there because the good people did nothing.
[03:02:41.641 --> 03:02:41.861]  I don't
[03:02:58.399 --> 03:02:58.940]  What's going on?
[03:03:17.208 --> 03:03:18.049]  Well, Doctor, hold on.
[03:03:18.049 --> 03:03:19.609]  You said you could stay.
[03:03:19.609 --> 03:03:22.911]  Can you do one more long segment to finish up telling us about that?
[03:03:22.911 --> 03:03:24.232]  And then take some more calls?
[03:03:24.232 --> 03:03:24.312]  Okay.
[03:03:40.046 --> 03:03:43.308]  Again, I see this more and more as we're winning.
[03:03:43.308 --> 03:03:48.111]  People are waking up to vaccines, so they're trying through fear to push it on us.
[03:03:48.111 --> 03:03:52.154]  I see this almost as a failing forward or fleeing forward.
[03:03:52.154 --> 03:03:52.514]  Doctor?
[03:03:52.514 --> 03:03:53.935]  I agree with you.
[03:03:53.935 --> 03:04:01.100]  I think that this is the greatest issue from our point of view, because now suddenly this is not what's going on over in Iraq.
[03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:05.062]  This is not the genocide that's being carried out over in Africa.
[03:04:05.062 --> 03:04:07.784]  This is going to affect people in this country.
[03:04:08.266 --> 03:04:12.607]  And you know, there's nothing that gets your attention more than when your own dogs get scored.
[03:04:12.607 --> 03:04:17.689]  And I think a lot of health care workers are going to be up in arms about this, and I'm just... Oh, they are!
[03:04:17.689 --> 03:04:21.890]  I've got an article about big demonstrations forming around the country of health care workers.
[03:04:21.890 --> 03:04:24.011]  Anything else, Mike and Mass?
[03:04:24.011 --> 03:04:36.975]  Yeah, I just wanted to end with, um, if they do pass this bill in Massachusetts and police officers do house-to-house or business-to-business, uh, there will be, um, you could say a second shot heard around the world that's referring to, uh, their original American members.
[03:04:37.833 --> 03:04:38.754]  Yeah, well that's the thing.
[03:04:38.754 --> 03:04:46.058]  If 1% of citizens don't take the shot and fight back, that's 3 million people firing weapons at police.
[03:04:46.058 --> 03:04:47.499]  We don't want this to happen.
[03:04:47.499 --> 03:04:49.581]  Because the new order wants to start this war.
[03:04:49.581 --> 03:04:56.845]  And I hope police and military know they're being marched in, up against the spirit of 1776, and they're going to be crushed.
[03:04:56.845 --> 03:04:58.126]  But that's part of the plan.
[03:04:58.126 --> 03:04:59.287]  I'll explain when we get back.
[03:05:01.687 --> 03:05:04.689]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.689 --> 03:05:10.014]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.014 --> 03:05:12.055]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.055 --> 03:05:17.059]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.059 --> 03:05:17.980]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:19.361]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.361 --> 03:05:21.262]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.262 --> 03:05:22.323]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.323 --> 03:05:24.525]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.525 --> 03:05:25.866]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.866 --> 03:05:27.387]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.387 --> 03:05:32.651]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.651 --> 03:05:36.254]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.254 --> 03:05:39.717]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.057 --> 03:05:41.278]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.278 --> 03:05:42.179]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.179 --> 03:05:43.300]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.300 --> 03:05:44.220]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.220 --> 03:05:45.321]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.321 --> 03:05:48.364]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.364 --> 03:05:50.145]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.145 --> 03:05:51.066]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.632 --> 03:06:05.959]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:05.959 --> 03:06:10.485]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.485 --> 03:06:12.768]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.768 --> 03:06:14.390]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.390 --> 03:06:15.412]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.632 --> 03:06:24.055]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:07:01.127 --> 03:07:05.410]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[03:07:05.410 --> 03:07:08.671]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[03:07:08.671 --> 03:07:16.456]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy if we the people
[03:07:16.736 --> 03:07:18.958]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[03:07:18.958 --> 03:07:21.340]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[03:07:21.340 --> 03:07:28.167]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[03:07:28.167 --> 03:07:33.892]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[03:07:34.332 --> 03:07:36.914]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[03:07:36.914 --> 03:07:44.679]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[03:08:06.149 --> 03:08:10.993]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:08:10.993 --> 03:08:12.574]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.574 --> 03:08:14.136]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.136 --> 03:08:18.319]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.319 --> 03:08:26.706]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:26.706 --> 03:08:32.211]  Dr. Monteith, we're going to continue with phone calls, but I wanted to ask you,
[03:08:33.700 --> 03:08:35.440]  This was basically a matter of eugenics.
[03:08:35.440 --> 03:08:41.081]  You see, wouldn't the world, if you are a eugenicist, who believe in eugenics, wouldn't the world be better off if there weren't any hemophiliacs?
[03:08:41.081 --> 03:08:43.742]  Because then we wouldn't have the disease.
[03:08:59.798 --> 03:09:02.060]  They set out to kill the Hemophiliacs.
[03:09:02.060 --> 03:09:04.721]  They killed almost half of them in the United States.
[03:09:04.721 --> 03:09:11.126]  They shipped Dr. A that they knew would kill the Hemophiliacs to Canada, to France...
[03:09:15.447 --> 03:09:24.792]  If we know they did that, and other companies have done thousands of other things, why do we then trust any vaccines they come out with, anything they say?
[03:09:24.792 --> 03:09:26.653]  Bayer worked with Hitler.
[03:09:26.653 --> 03:09:28.834]  It's all these companies.
[03:09:28.834 --> 03:09:33.777]  I mean, it's so elementary, and then they admit this flu isn't dangerous.
[03:09:33.777 --> 03:09:39.460]  I mean, compared to regular flu, 30-some percent of people already have it, didn't even get sick.
[03:09:39.460 --> 03:09:44.703]  I mean, just how... I mean, how is it... Why aren't people waking up quicker?
[03:09:45.143 --> 03:09:49.225]  Well, what we need to do is simply keep talking and talk about it.
[03:09:49.225 --> 03:10:07.654]  I'm sure you're well aware of the fact that Baxter says, you know, batches, a massive batch of influenza vaccine to Europe that actually contains the deadly H1N5 or H5N1 avian flu viruses.
[03:10:07.654 --> 03:10:09.454]  Our bodies would fight this off.
[03:10:09.454 --> 03:10:12.676]  We don't get infected by it unless they infect it into you.
[03:10:13.106 --> 03:10:23.431]  And they were going to give it to millions of people if it hadn't been for the Czechoslovakians who tested the vaccine before it was given and probably killed all the ferrets that then checked the vaccine.
[03:10:23.431 --> 03:10:28.813]  They would have killed millions of people if I'm talking within the last several months.
[03:10:28.813 --> 03:10:37.217]  This happened, and Baxter said, RG, we just have no idea how the deadly virus got in our flu vaccine.
[03:10:37.217 --> 03:10:38.458]  Let me ask you this.
[03:10:40.356 --> 03:10:43.518]  This is why I think we're moving towards the climax of history.
[03:10:43.518 --> 03:10:51.363]  That would have been the greatest criminal act of all time, would have dwarfed anything that Adolf Hitler ever did.
[03:10:51.363 --> 03:10:59.809]  And we would have heard on the news that it was a muted, mutated, bird flu killing everybody, and we would have never known it was Baxter.
[03:10:59.809 --> 03:11:02.671]  But by the grace of God, a lab technician discovered it.
[03:11:02.671 --> 03:11:09.055]  And basically, this was in the last couple of months, and anybody can check these facts out, fortunately,
[03:11:09.494 --> 03:11:21.063]  We have access to the internet and you can go to your search engine and simply put in Baxter of the avian flu virus and it would put into a flu vaccine.
[03:11:21.063 --> 03:11:27.668]  When they would do that, I mean, they should have immediately arrested the people from Baxter and put them in prison.
[03:11:27.668 --> 03:11:31.391]  We're talking about the attempt to kill millions of people.
[03:11:31.531 --> 03:11:32.752]  Well, let me go further, doctor.
[03:11:32.752 --> 03:11:44.957]  Then it came out in a London Telegraph that of a hundred homeless that were given this shot, a bird flu vaccine, and told that it was regular flu vaccine, the city, one city in Poland, paid them.
[03:11:44.957 --> 03:11:47.819]  This happened all over Europe.
[03:11:47.819 --> 03:11:50.300]  21 of the hundred that were tested died.
[03:11:50.300 --> 03:11:52.281]  So this is a deadly weapon.
[03:11:52.281 --> 03:11:55.382]  And then no one from the vaccine makers got in trouble.
[03:11:55.382 --> 03:11:56.983]  They arrested the city officials.
[03:11:58.459 --> 03:12:08.422]  Well, I think it's about time the American people... I honestly believe that the one that they're going to give in Europe is going to be much more deadly than the one they give here in the United States.
[03:12:08.422 --> 03:12:15.583]  But I'm not certain of that, and you shouldn't take it anyway because it contains mercury, but you do not know what is in it.
[03:12:15.583 --> 03:12:18.484]  I mean, we can go back to the history of vaccines.
[03:12:18.484 --> 03:12:25.366]  We can start back, certainly, back in 1942 when they gave our military yellow fever vaccine.
[03:12:25.945 --> 03:12:39.668]  But they forgot to test it ahead of time, and of course, they got yellow jaundice because it had the hepatitis B. And actually, about 300,000 American troops got the virus.
[03:12:39.668 --> 03:12:47.770]  Fortunately, only about 28,000 came down with the disease, and I don't know how many of them died, but... Only 28,000 had their liver eaten!
[03:12:47.770 --> 03:12:49.431]  How nice of the government!
[03:12:49.431 --> 03:12:54.792]  But what people do not know, and this is one of the most carefully kept secrets of modern times,
[03:12:55.640 --> 03:13:10.945]  Is that there are, and you can go to the World Health Organization website and get the information, 2 billion people, that is not million, that's 2 billion people have been infected with Hepatitis B throughout the world.
[03:13:10.945 --> 03:13:12.346]  How did they get it?
[03:13:12.346 --> 03:13:21.629]  The vast majority of them got from the World Health Organization Vaccine Immunization Program, where they just accidentally used dirty needles.
[03:13:22.679 --> 03:13:22.800]  Oh!
[03:13:22.800 --> 03:13:25.602]  Of course that's their spin.
[03:13:25.602 --> 03:13:35.570]  I saw the BBC article about four years ago where it said in one African country, we don't know why forty-some percent of the women all have HIV and we've had medical tests.
[03:13:35.570 --> 03:13:38.992]  A lot of these little ten-year-old girls have never had sexual intercourse.
[03:13:39.933 --> 03:13:43.995]  Unfortunately, I think you're true both here and in the United States.
[03:14:05.186 --> 03:14:18.612]  You know, basically, they gave an experimental hepatitis B vaccine, and it was about 1976 or 77, to cohorts of homosexuals who volunteered for this.
[03:14:18.612 --> 03:14:26.736]  This was a hepatitis B trial, you know, to see if the vaccine worked in New York, in San Francisco, and in Los Angeles.
[03:14:26.736 --> 03:14:34.840]  And a few years later, all the homosexuals there started, or most of them, started coming down with a strange new disease that turned out to be AIDS.
[03:14:35.712 --> 03:14:49.509]  In San Francisco, and we have the figures for it, 75% of the young homosexuals, idealistic people who are trying to stop the spread of hepatitis B in their community, 77% of them came down
[03:14:53.559 --> 03:14:56.922]  With AIDS, and they're almost all dead today.
[03:14:56.922 --> 03:14:58.403]  And why did the government use them?
[03:14:58.403 --> 03:15:05.789]  Because they were very sexually promiscuous, and it was perfect to use them as the seed vector to spread it.
[03:15:05.789 --> 03:15:10.052]  And the cover, you say, oh, well, it's their private security that's doing that.
[03:15:10.052 --> 03:15:17.178]  And so basically, of course, we thought, well, and I will have to admit, I was, I could not believe this initially.
[03:15:18.051 --> 03:15:29.537]  I thought that, you know, if it had gone to 77% of the homosexuals, you know, who had taken this vaccine, obviously it was going to just explode in the rest of the homosexual population.
[03:15:29.537 --> 03:15:35.720]  It was going to get to the heterosexual population, which is equally promiscuous, and it really didn't do it.
[03:15:35.720 --> 03:15:40.222]  It was also meant to launch the global fear-mongering.
[03:15:40.222 --> 03:15:45.625]  This virus is designed to kill black, and in the United States today,
[03:15:46.397 --> 03:15:55.304]  Almost half of the AIDS cases are in black, and almost half of the people who've died of AIDS are black in the United States.
[03:15:55.304 --> 03:15:58.006]  And as you said, doctor, they've done the studies.
[03:15:58.006 --> 03:16:00.487]  My dad's shown me these in medical journals.
[03:16:00.487 --> 03:16:01.908]  He's a physician.
[03:16:01.908 --> 03:16:07.733]  That you'll take a black that is less promiscuous in these average actuaries than whites,
[03:16:08.567 --> 03:16:10.388]  They know how to create diseases that are race specific.
[03:16:10.388 --> 03:16:17.774]  In other words, if you want to infect blacks, they have slightly different genetic makeup, and you can actually engineer a disease, and this is an engineered disease.
[03:16:17.774 --> 03:16:19.636]  How do we know it was engineered?
[03:16:37.031 --> 03:16:45.256]  Because one of the fellows who was part of the engineering came forward, he was dying of pancreatic cancer, and he told a man named Gary Glum the story.
[03:16:45.256 --> 03:16:49.078]  And actually the book is called Full Disclosure.
[03:16:49.078 --> 03:16:58.023]  In fact, you can go to my website and we actually have the front of the book there, and yet all of the links have been disconnected.
[03:16:58.023 --> 03:17:01.705]  They don't want you to read the book, but the book is called Full Disclosure.
[03:17:01.705 --> 03:17:02.886]  You could probably get a copy.
[03:17:03.476 --> 03:17:08.340]  And I want to say this, I was listening to XM Left today, the liberal XM channel, I heard two black soldiers
[03:17:30.399 --> 03:17:33.281]  And of course, the thing is that they have targeted the blacks.
[03:17:33.281 --> 03:17:36.603]  That's, of course, why they put the abortion clinics into the black
[03:18:01.477 --> 03:18:05.659]  Look at Obama taking the funding block off for abortions in Africa!
[03:18:05.659 --> 03:18:06.680]  Sure.
[03:18:06.680 --> 03:18:14.624]  I mean, people find it difficult to believe that there is a genocidal program, first for the blacks, but next for the whites.
[03:18:14.624 --> 03:18:17.226]  And now they're getting around to the white part.
[03:18:17.226 --> 03:18:27.872]  And you go into countries like, say, Bimbabwe in Africa today, and the average age of a black man, you know, the average man would die at 64.
[03:18:29.079 --> 03:18:31.461]  Today, the average age of a black man who dies is 34.
[03:18:31.461 --> 03:18:34.084]  They have the life.
[03:18:34.084 --> 03:18:35.445]  They've done this intentionally.
[03:18:35.445 --> 03:18:36.206]  They've done it with AIDS.
[03:18:36.206 --> 03:18:39.950]  They've done it with other programs that they have that kill off the blacks.
[03:18:39.950 --> 03:18:49.900]  And sir, that's another point, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I've had other medical doctors on and folks that study statistics.
[03:18:49.900 --> 03:18:51.842]  Before, around 40% of children
[03:18:54.252 --> 03:19:18.257]  would would would die before the age of five or six and so that would show that the average life expectancy was fifty five years old in frontier days but if you lived past five or six people actually were living longer eighty ninety in many cases on average you go to old graveyards you see half the graves are for three-year-olds four-year-olds five-year-olds two-year-olds but now if you take out the infant mortality rate
[03:19:18.817 --> 03:19:25.187]  Being lower today than it was 150 years ago, our life expectancy has plunged.
[03:19:25.187 --> 03:19:29.073]  So has the Russians, the Africans, every country that takes vaccines.
[03:19:29.907 --> 03:19:45.232]  Absolutely, and the thing is that this is why Bill and Melinda Gates, who are totally dedicated to population control and are certainly funding putting the seeds up above the Arctic Circle, that's why they're funding giving the vaccines to all those children.
[03:19:45.232 --> 03:19:46.392]  So stay there.
[03:19:46.392 --> 03:19:47.533]  Let's talk about them.
[03:19:47.533 --> 03:19:53.035]  I'll just go ahead and keep you for another 20 minutes if you can do it, because I want to go to Chris, John, Steve, Mark, and Rob, and everybody else.
[03:19:53.035 --> 03:19:56.376]  Let's talk about Bill and Melinda Gates, the ghouls of Planned Parenthood.
[03:19:56.376 --> 03:19:56.796]  They run it.
[03:20:01.485 --> 03:20:02.806]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:20:02.806 --> 03:20:08.389]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:13.413]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:20:13.413 --> 03:20:18.436]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:20:18.979 --> 03:20:24.200]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:20:24.200 --> 03:20:26.501]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:20:26.501 --> 03:20:31.322]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:20:31.322 --> 03:20:32.423]  And here's the best part.
[03:20:32.423 --> 03:20:35.203]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:20:35.203 --> 03:20:39.125]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:20:39.125 --> 03:20:42.305]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:20:42.305 --> 03:20:44.126]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:20:44.526 --> 03:20:47.768]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:20:47.768 --> 03:20:52.070]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:58.173]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:20:58.173 --> 03:21:01.594]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:21:01.594 --> 03:21:07.317]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[03:21:07.317 --> 03:21:08.658]  And we knew what to do.
[03:21:08.658 --> 03:21:10.659]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:21:10.659 --> 03:21:12.320]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film.
[03:21:13.459 --> 03:21:17.686]  That finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:21:17.686 --> 03:21:26.200]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:21:26.584 --> 03:21:33.668]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:21:33.668 --> 03:21:36.830]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:21:36.830 --> 03:21:40.732]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was BOOM!
[03:21:40.732 --> 03:21:41.052]  BOOM!
[03:21:41.052 --> 03:21:41.372]  BOOM!
[03:21:41.372 --> 03:21:41.693]  BOOM!
[03:21:41.693 --> 03:21:42.613]  BOOM!
[03:21:42.613 --> 03:21:45.695]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:21:45.695 --> 03:21:52.679]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[03:21:57.261 --> 03:22:02.684]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:22:02.684 --> 03:22:08.207]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:22:08.207 --> 03:22:08.767]  I get it.
[03:22:08.767 --> 03:22:18.372]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:22:18.372 --> 03:22:19.533]  That's not what's happening.
[03:22:19.793 --> 03:22:28.261]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:22:28.261 --> 03:22:31.644]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:22:31.644 --> 03:22:35.928]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:22:35.928 --> 03:22:37.529]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:22:37.529 --> 03:22:40.932]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[03:22:40.932 --> 03:22:45.096]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:22:45.276 --> 03:22:46.176]  You should, too.
[03:22:46.176 --> 03:22:47.337]  Find out what they know.
[03:22:47.337 --> 03:22:50.638]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:22:50.638 --> 03:22:50.698]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:50.698 --> 03:22:51.018]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.018 --> 03:22:51.219]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.704 --> 03:23:06.866]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[03:23:06.866 --> 03:23:10.367]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:23:10.367 --> 03:23:16.089]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:23:16.089 --> 03:23:18.650]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:23:18.650 --> 03:23:23.191]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:23:23.191 --> 03:23:25.912]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:23:26.372 --> 03:23:32.098]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:23:32.098 --> 03:23:34.360]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:23:34.360 --> 03:23:42.909]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:23:42.909 --> 03:23:43.910]  Don't pick your nose.
[03:23:44.270 --> 03:23:48.851]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:23:48.851 --> 03:23:53.973]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:23:53.973 --> 03:23:55.713]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[03:23:55.713 --> 03:23:57.934]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:23:57.934 --> 03:23:59.654]  Be well and stay well.
[03:23:59.654 --> 03:24:03.695]  Best MZ.
[03:24:03.695 --> 03:24:06.816]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[03:24:06.816 --> 03:24:09.977]  In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[03:24:11.451 --> 03:24:32.183]  Ladies and gentlemen, when you discover that there's a technological enslavement system, a scientific dictatorship in place, and we have stacks of their textbooks here in the office, we show them to you daily on air, where they're talking about how we're stupid and how they control us and they laugh about how they're killing us, it angers you.
[03:24:32.183 --> 03:24:37.086]  And then to see the poverty pimps, the liberals, Margaret Sanger, hired by the Rockefellers,
[03:24:38.951 --> 03:24:48.084]  Ninety-something years ago, and I sent off to the universities and got her actual copies of her letters, not just quotes in books, calling blacks subhuman, garbage, weeds that have to be killed.
[03:24:48.084 --> 03:24:51.690]  She came as a liberal lover to the blacks.
[03:24:51.690 --> 03:24:52.310]  W.E.B.
[03:24:52.310 --> 03:24:54.834]  Du Bois, they hired him to go out.
[03:24:55.695 --> 03:25:00.640]  And they've destroyed their family with the welfare, paid the women not to have men in the house.
[03:25:00.640 --> 03:25:02.342]  They've done it to everybody else's community now.
[03:25:02.342 --> 03:25:03.663]  Blacks were the test.
[03:25:03.663 --> 03:25:06.005]  They sold the narcotics in their communities.
[03:25:06.005 --> 03:25:07.947]  They put the Planned Parenthood in their communities.
[03:25:07.947 --> 03:25:14.093]  And then the liberals on TV, Chris Matthews says, if you don't agree with Obama, you're a racist.
[03:25:14.093 --> 03:25:18.116]  So the real eugenicists, the real hardcore people that hate blacks,
[03:25:18.857 --> 03:25:23.618]  I've documented, they're the ones that pose as the liberals.
[03:25:23.618 --> 03:25:29.960]  You see, blacks, you don't have to worry about the FBI-controlled Ku Klux Klan wearing the sheets.
[03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:32.221]  The real killers are the liberals.
[03:25:32.221 --> 03:25:33.201]  The so-called liberals.
[03:25:33.201 --> 03:25:34.261]  They're not liberal.
[03:25:34.261 --> 03:25:37.402]  They got all these well-meaning idiots under them that don't understand what they're part of.
[03:25:37.402 --> 03:25:40.563]  But Bill and Melinda Gates, Bill Gates is part of Planned Parenthood.
[03:25:41.463 --> 03:25:44.745]  He's given over $80 billion with Warren Buffett to their foundation.
[03:25:44.745 --> 03:25:46.326]  I have the article somewhere in the stack.
[03:25:46.326 --> 03:25:47.927]  Guys, pull it up on screen.
[03:25:47.927 --> 03:25:54.211]  Times of London, rich meet, secret meeting for population control in New York four months ago.
[03:25:54.211 --> 03:25:55.592]  Dr. Monteith, short segment.
[03:25:55.592 --> 03:26:00.596]  We're going to come back and talk to Chris, John, Steve, Mark, and Rob, and then let you go.
[03:26:00.596 --> 03:26:01.977]  But you're an expert on eugenics.
[03:26:01.977 --> 03:26:03.678]  You were talking about this before I was born.
[03:26:04.638 --> 03:26:07.199]  I'm 35 years old, been doing this for over 40.
[03:26:07.199 --> 03:26:10.541]  Explain to them what his global vaccine program is.
[03:26:10.541 --> 03:26:13.662]  He wants to release mosquitoes that have vaccines in them.
[03:26:13.662 --> 03:26:19.384]  Explain to people how his father was the former head of Planned Parenthood, who we're dealing with.
[03:26:19.384 --> 03:26:25.227]  Well, Bill and Melinda Gates, that foundation, is funding all sorts of terrible things.
[03:26:25.227 --> 03:26:30.529]  One of the worst things, of course, is the massive vaccine program for African Americans.
[03:26:30.934 --> 03:26:46.450]  Of course, here in the United States, why they've taken the mercury out of childhood vaccines, the vaccines that are given for childhood diseases, unfortunately they've left it in the vaccines that are given to children.
[03:26:46.450 --> 03:26:47.611]  What a clever study.
[03:26:47.611 --> 03:26:48.512]  In fact, now they've
[03:26:49.093 --> 03:26:49.514]  I think so.
[03:27:03.533 --> 03:27:12.461]  Seasonal vaccine and two shots of swine vaccine starting at six months of age but through the maximum amount of damage as far as the mercury.
[03:27:12.461 --> 03:27:15.323]  And they know about it because we have their study.
[03:27:15.323 --> 03:27:17.025]  It's called the Southwood Study.
[03:27:17.025 --> 03:27:24.871]  It was actually before there was a meeting that was held in the year 2000 with people from the CDC and the World Health Organization.
[03:27:24.871 --> 03:27:28.815]  The vaccine manufacturers got together at a place called Simpsonwood.
[03:27:28.815 --> 03:27:30.196]  It's the Simpsonwood before
[03:27:30.572 --> 03:27:30.832]  I don't know.
[03:27:53.944 --> 03:27:59.889]  A 90 American boy is now autistic and their lives are destroyed and they know what they're doing.
[03:27:59.889 --> 03:28:11.879]  But Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are funding the vaccine programs in Africa and we left the mercury of the vaccines we're giving to the African children.
[03:28:11.879 --> 03:28:16.742]  Now that not only destroyed their minds, they destroyed their fertility.
[03:28:16.742 --> 03:28:21.126]  And their fertility is destroyed in this generation and in subsequent generations.
[03:28:22.445 --> 03:28:29.207]  And not just this generation they've destroyed fertility, but you know, with their children and their children's children.
[03:28:29.207 --> 03:28:37.629]  One of the most vicious and horrible things that has ever been done and is being done by the Melinda Gates Foundation.
[03:28:37.629 --> 03:28:40.569]  Now, you have to ask yourself, why would they do that?
[03:28:40.569 --> 03:28:49.111]  First of all, why would people who are dedicated to population control want to save the lives of little African children?
[03:28:49.111 --> 03:28:51.572]  And they don't want to save their lives, they want to destroy them.
[03:28:52.458 --> 03:28:54.720]  Yeah, that's 1 plus 1 equals 100.
[03:28:54.720 --> 03:28:55.601]  It doesn't make sense.
[03:28:55.601 --> 03:28:58.243]  In fact, put that article back up.
[03:28:58.243 --> 03:29:02.626]  Secret meeting with the Rockefellers, the Gateses, Warren Buffett, Ted Turner.
[03:29:02.626 --> 03:29:05.228]  Ted Turner, who calls us useless eaters and feeders.
[03:29:05.228 --> 03:29:07.890]  Billionaire club in bid to curb overpopulation.
[03:29:07.890 --> 03:29:12.054]  And they said a secret meeting of how to carry this out.
[03:29:12.054 --> 03:29:12.414]  Go ahead.
[03:29:13.586 --> 03:29:15.748]  Don't forget George Soros was there.
[03:29:15.748 --> 03:29:16.448]  Yes.
[03:29:16.448 --> 03:29:21.352]  Basically, you have to try to say, why would rational people do this?
[03:29:21.352 --> 03:29:23.834]  Well, these are not rational people.
[03:29:23.834 --> 03:29:27.196]  They're people who've gone over to the dark side.
[03:29:27.196 --> 03:29:30.999]  And basically, there is an organization in the United States.
[03:29:30.999 --> 03:29:32.360]  They have a newsletter.
[03:29:32.360 --> 03:29:36.303]  They have offices in New York City, Geneva, London.
[03:29:36.303 --> 03:29:37.564]  They're very well funded.
[03:29:37.564 --> 03:29:40.406]  Some of the richest people in the world fund them.
[03:29:40.406 --> 03:29:42.668]  And of course, they're called the Lucius Trust.
[03:29:43.106 --> 03:29:51.812]  Tell us about Lucia's Trust and phone calls straight ahead.
[03:29:51.812 --> 03:29:53.213]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.213 --> 03:29:55.735]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.735 --> 03:29:58.437]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.152 --> 03:30:05.374]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.374 --> 03:30:07.394]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.394 --> 03:30:15.917]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.917 --> 03:30:21.459]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.459 --> 03:30:23.080]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.320 --> 03:30:29.845]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.845 --> 03:30:40.894]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.894 --> 03:30:41.654]  That's right.
[03:30:41.654 --> 03:30:44.236]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[03:31:04.551 --> 03:31:05.232]  It's here.
[03:31:05.232 --> 03:31:10.375]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[03:31:10.375 --> 03:31:18.000]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[03:31:18.706 --> 03:31:26.149]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[03:31:26.149 --> 03:31:37.894]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[03:31:37.894 --> 03:31:41.856]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[03:31:41.856 --> 03:31:44.117]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[03:31:44.117 --> 03:31:47.959]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[03:33:07.904 --> 03:33:11.327]  I know I harp on eugenics every day.
[03:33:11.327 --> 03:33:12.808]  How could you talk about anything else?
[03:33:12.808 --> 03:33:18.412]  We have a global government being set up openly for the stated purpose of exterminating us.
[03:33:18.412 --> 03:33:22.235]  They're testing different poisons and toxins in the food and vaccines.
[03:33:22.235 --> 03:33:25.138]  They're bragging about it.
[03:33:25.138 --> 03:33:36.146]  And the general public still only cares about football and is it racist to criticize Obama when he's just a black face on their killing machine.
[03:33:36.146 --> 03:33:36.867]  I mean, I almost
[03:33:38.157 --> 03:33:39.118]  Broke down and cried.
[03:33:39.118 --> 03:34:00.855]  A week and a half ago, my kids are playing out in the front yard, in the neighbor's yard, and two different groups of neighborhood kids out of four groups, you know, four different groups of kids from different parents in the neighborhood, I know all their parents, were coming up showing me their flu shot bandages on their arms, and these are sweet little smart little kids, and, uh,
[03:34:03.459 --> 03:34:03.759]  I don't know.
[03:34:22.882 --> 03:34:32.330]  Then they're over at my house, playing in the backyard, and one of their mothers calls and says, tell her son's name to come home in 20 minutes for dinner.
[03:34:32.330 --> 03:34:34.392]  And she goes, I go, how are you doing?
[03:34:34.392 --> 03:34:35.232]  How you been doing?
[03:34:35.232 --> 03:34:37.574]  To the lady three doors down.
[03:34:37.574 --> 03:34:38.815]  And she goes, oh, I'm good.
[03:34:38.815 --> 03:34:44.520]  I just got both, you know, both my kids flu shots today.
[03:34:44.520 --> 03:34:47.383]  And I just didn't even say anything to her.
[03:34:47.383 --> 03:34:48.463]  I know I was supposed to.
[03:34:49.724 --> 03:34:51.525]  Well, you call it denial, is the term.
[03:34:51.525 --> 03:34:53.926]  But the truth of the matter is, Alex, it is so hard to believe
[03:35:20.819 --> 03:35:26.422]  The doctor who you know and trust would give something to your child that would be harmful to them.
[03:35:26.422 --> 03:35:43.132]  But what you must understand, I don't know if you've ever seen the DVD or heard the talk put out by Dr. Blaylock, and I know you don't know Russell, but he has a talk on vaccines and brain development, pointing out that the vaccines actually stunt brain development.
[03:35:43.132 --> 03:35:47.795]  The younger they're given, why of course the younger the child is, the more damage they do
[03:35:48.342 --> 03:35:59.310]  But every time you take a vaccine, why, it triggers off not only the immune response of the body, but the immune response of the brain.
[03:35:59.310 --> 03:36:01.912]  And that's why those children were a little groggy.
[03:36:01.912 --> 03:36:03.753]  They weren't quite themselves.
[03:36:03.753 --> 03:36:05.614]  You know, they weren't thinking clearly.
[03:36:05.614 --> 03:36:11.559]  Well, when you get the flu, you know, your mind is sort of, sort of groggy.
[03:36:11.559 --> 03:36:14.481]  But of course, the same thing happens when you take the vaccine.
[03:36:15.202 --> 03:36:29.046]  But you do this repeatedly, and you produce chronic inflammation in the brain of an older person, and that's why so many of them get demented, but you do this to the child, it prevents the normal development of the brain of the child.
[03:36:29.046 --> 03:36:38.769]  This is criminal activity, and to give them, they want to give several of these vaccine shots at the same time, knowing that it will do the maximum amount of damage that way.
[03:36:38.769 --> 03:36:43.150]  The average doctor has no idea, because he's never allowed to hear this information,
[03:36:43.570 --> 03:36:47.072]  That's why we need to educate your audience.
[03:36:47.072 --> 03:36:48.492]  They've got to go to the doctors.
[03:36:56.479 --> 03:37:05.343]  Well, I think that an awful lot of people at least have a suspicion that something's going on, and I think there's a growing awareness that there's something seriously wrong.
[03:37:05.343 --> 03:37:14.507]  But they have to understand that it is not simply the mercury in the vaccines, although this is toxic to the brain, it is the aluminum that is in the vaccines.
[03:37:14.507 --> 03:37:17.488]  Now, unfortunately, as far as we know,
[03:37:18.251 --> 03:37:26.738]  I'm not going to have aluminum in the swine flu vaccine, but it is in the regular seasonal vaccine.
[03:37:26.738 --> 03:37:37.347]  And this, of course, aluminum is a toxic metal, and aluminum and mercury together are even more toxic, and then if you have fluoridated water, that's the one, two, three thing.
[03:37:37.347 --> 03:37:44.653]  And this is why so many of our, even our college students when they graduate, are totally incapable when they graduate
[03:37:45.273 --> 03:37:46.013]  They can't think!
[03:37:46.013 --> 03:37:55.696]  I mean this is what the globalists call for in their documents is brain damaging everybody through the food water and vaccines and so you see it people say it's like the public's retarded.
[03:37:55.696 --> 03:37:57.957]  They are!
[03:37:57.957 --> 03:38:08.100]  And Dr. Blaylock points that out that they have major studies that people that are 20 now on average have the memory of a 65 year old and literally
[03:38:08.880 --> 03:38:28.427]  They're just going to turn it into a business, advertise it, and say it's normal to have an ADIQ, it's normal to drool, you know, geniuses won't have 140 IQ, they'll have 100, and if somebody can tie their shoelaces, they'll be a genius, and then the elite's just laughing
[03:38:29.227 --> 03:38:35.515]  And I know there's brain-damaged people listening right now, but even with a retarded child, you can get through to them and talk to them.
[03:38:35.515 --> 03:38:38.398]  To the police officers, you've been brain-damaged.
[03:38:38.398 --> 03:38:40.280]  You've been brainwashed.
[03:38:40.280 --> 03:38:42.523]  The sodium fluoride isn't good for you.
[03:38:42.523 --> 03:38:44.505]  The vaccines aren't good.
[03:38:44.505 --> 03:38:47.008]  Bad man giving you shot.
[03:38:47.589 --> 03:38:51.352]  Bad, you know, bad system hurt your brain.
[03:38:51.352 --> 03:38:54.494]  Brain is what you think with.
[03:38:54.494 --> 03:38:57.276]  It's in your... I'm not being sarcastic here.
[03:38:57.276 --> 03:39:08.284]  Sometimes I think I should talk to the general public like that, because... Look, I want to take a few final calls here with you, Dr. Monteith, but one last question before we take a few of those.
[03:39:08.284 --> 03:39:11.866]  Quickly, the time we have left here, because I've got other news for listeners I'm going to hit.
[03:39:11.866 --> 03:39:12.567]  We appreciate your time.
[03:39:14.201 --> 03:39:38.240]  I talked to Blaylock on several times in the last month, and he pointed out that mercury, aluminum, not just squalene, are adjuvants themselves and cause the autoimmune response and swelling, not just in the brain, but in other glands and organs, and that that's where most of the damage is coming from, not just the cancer viruses, not just the neurological damage of the mercury itself.
[03:39:38.240 --> 03:39:40.042]  What's your intel on that as a medical doctor?
[03:39:40.222 --> 03:39:41.943]  Well, I think he's absolutely right.
[03:39:41.943 --> 03:39:48.929]  And remember what Bertrand Russell said in his book on page 53, The Impact of Science on Society?
[03:39:48.929 --> 03:39:55.794]  By diet, injection, and injunction will alter the brain pattern of our children.
[03:39:55.794 --> 03:39:57.635]  That's exactly what it was about.
[03:39:57.635 --> 03:39:58.596]  He was one of the leaders.
[03:39:58.596 --> 03:39:59.877]  He made it all out.
[03:39:59.877 --> 03:40:04.781]  But we can't let the people know there really are evil people who want to harm the
[03:40:06.308 --> 03:40:07.548]  Alright, let's take a call.
[03:40:07.548 --> 03:40:08.809]  We're going to do calls quickly now.
[03:40:08.809 --> 03:40:10.910]  Chris in Maryland, you're on the air with Dr. Stan Monteith.
[03:40:10.910 --> 03:40:11.870]  Go ahead.
[03:40:11.870 --> 03:40:12.410]  Hey, doctor.
[03:40:12.410 --> 03:40:15.431]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[03:40:15.431 --> 03:40:24.354]  I was a combat lifesaver in the Army years ago, and one of the things that we were taught is to give vaccines for the flu.
[03:40:24.354 --> 03:40:33.117]  And during the course, the instructor had said, now this and this, these actual flu vaccines are from last year's strain.
[03:40:33.117 --> 03:40:34.538]  And I questioned my ass.
[03:40:35.615 --> 03:40:38.176]  Uh, why are we getting last year's strain?
[03:40:38.176 --> 03:40:44.098]  Because of, if it's this year that we're living in, what good is last year's strain gonna be?
[03:40:44.098 --> 03:40:51.081]  And it makes sense now with all these nanoparticles, these adjuvants, such as mercury, uh, the other stuff.
[03:40:51.081 --> 03:40:55.623]  Yeah, you're not given the shot to take care of the flu, you're given it to brain, be brain damaged.
[03:40:55.623 --> 03:40:56.683]  Exactly.
[03:40:56.683 --> 03:41:00.545]  And now I understand why I've got these medical disabilities, such as, uh,
[03:41:01.229 --> 03:41:10.222]  Damn IBS and autoimmune system infection where it's attacking my own body.
[03:41:10.222 --> 03:41:11.844]  It makes perfect sense.
[03:41:11.844 --> 03:41:14.328]  Were you into the Gulf War during the first Gulf War?
[03:41:15.496 --> 03:41:16.737]  Unfortunately, yes.
[03:41:16.737 --> 03:41:23.380]  Because that's when they use the experimental vaccine, so-called vaccine A, with the squalene in it.
[03:41:23.380 --> 03:41:30.724]  And over, you know, almost 80,000 of the 690,000 troops we sent are dead already.
[03:41:30.724 --> 03:41:33.326]  And of course, they're monitoring this very closely.
[03:41:33.326 --> 03:41:35.387]  Yeah, the Army admits it was the squalene.
[03:41:35.387 --> 03:41:36.448]  You're lucky you're not dead.
[03:41:37.188 --> 03:41:37.789]  You're lucky you're not.
[03:41:37.789 --> 03:41:42.513]  I mean, the Army admits you've been soft killed and I'm sorry they tried to murder you.
[03:41:42.513 --> 03:41:46.956]  Just be glad you're not dead and warn as many people as you can before they continue the murders.
[03:41:46.956 --> 03:41:49.178]  Well, I just got out of the hospital because of it.
[03:41:49.178 --> 03:41:55.183]  I had some bleeding and the only good thing I got out of it was the morphine.
[03:41:55.183 --> 03:41:57.645]  That's about the only good thing that I got out of the whole thing.
[03:41:57.645 --> 03:41:59.407]  Well, they hit you hard and I'm sorry they did.
[03:41:59.407 --> 03:42:00.308]  But see, they hate you.
[03:42:00.308 --> 03:42:04.311]  As somebody that believes they're patriotic, they hate you.
[03:42:04.311 --> 03:42:05.312]  They hate their servants.
[03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:12.708]  Yeah, and this reminds me, the Christianity in this country is not the Christianity that Jesus taught back in his day.
[03:42:12.708 --> 03:42:13.470]  I know it.
[03:42:13.470 --> 03:42:14.453]  Because the churches...
[03:42:15.006 --> 03:42:19.610]  Are teaching people to, you know, pray for your leaders, pray for your country.
[03:42:19.610 --> 03:42:22.753]  Why would I want to pray for a country that wants to kill me for first?
[03:42:22.753 --> 03:42:26.896]  It's not your country, it's a criminal corporate group.
[03:42:26.896 --> 03:42:32.841]  Look, if hijackers hijack a plane, does everybody bow down because they put the captain cap on?
[03:42:32.841 --> 03:42:33.662]  No!
[03:42:33.662 --> 03:42:35.824]  You know it's illegitimate, it's a hijacking.
[03:42:35.824 --> 03:42:38.045]  It's a global corporate takeover.
[03:42:38.045 --> 03:42:42.049]  They wrap themselves in the flag and then carry out their operations.
[03:42:42.049 --> 03:42:43.270]  Dr. Montee, if you wanted to comment.
[03:42:43.630 --> 03:42:45.391]  Can't say it better than that.
[03:42:45.391 --> 03:42:48.133]  It is not our country.
[03:42:48.133 --> 03:42:50.034]  Our country has been taken over.
[03:42:50.034 --> 03:42:51.435]  We have a visible government.
[03:42:51.435 --> 03:42:55.898]  We have an invisible government, which I call the Brotherhood of Darkness.
[03:42:55.898 --> 03:42:57.859]  People need to understand that.
[03:42:57.859 --> 03:43:01.101]  They want to destroy the majority of the people of
[03:43:02.025 --> 03:43:07.370]  And by the way, I know there are new military people who aren't veterans yet and a lot of police listening.
[03:43:07.370 --> 03:43:09.232]  Most of you don't laugh, some do.
[03:43:09.232 --> 03:43:16.820]  Go ahead, take all the shots, get diabetes when you're 35, let your kid get cancer when they're 10, and then you won't be laughing.
[03:43:16.820 --> 03:43:17.961]  This isn't a game.
[03:43:17.961 --> 03:43:20.284]  I'm not up here risking my life to tell you about this stuff.
[03:43:20.284 --> 03:43:21.665]  They've killed a lot of people.
[03:43:21.665 --> 03:43:23.126]  And I appreciate your call, Chris.
[03:43:23.126 --> 03:43:24.087]  I'm sorry they did that to you.
[03:43:26.122 --> 03:43:35.110]  Dr. Monteith, I'm sure you saw the ABC News article from three or four months ago with the headline that Merck, quote, sent out hit teams to doctors' homes.
[03:43:35.110 --> 03:43:43.176]  And in court documents that came out, they said, oh, we've got to seek and destroy, take them out, hit them, anyone that criticizes our drugs and vaccines.
[03:43:43.176 --> 03:43:49.782]  And then when Merck got caught in federal court with these internal corporate documents, they said, oh, we just meant that as a joke saying hit teams.
[03:43:51.491 --> 03:43:55.893]  Well, this is nothing funny about what's going on.
[03:43:55.893 --> 03:44:01.456]  The number of people who have been killed, the number of children whose lives have been destroyed forever.
[03:44:01.456 --> 03:44:08.580]  One in every 60 to 90 boys in the United States is autistic, and they did it on purpose.
[03:44:08.580 --> 03:44:08.740]  That's
[03:44:10.698 --> 03:44:18.185]  They call autism the range of brain damage caused from the chemical weapon and biological weapons in the vaccines.
[03:44:18.185 --> 03:44:24.291]  The thing is that basically probably every child has been injured to some greater or lesser extent.
[03:44:24.744 --> 03:44:29.266]  And now they're coming out with pharmacological crops that have the vaccines in them.
[03:44:29.266 --> 03:44:30.127]  Right.
[03:44:30.127 --> 03:44:34.289]  Oh, so basically the GMO food is a disaster.
[03:44:34.289 --> 03:44:42.833]  That's why they're storing the seeds up above the Arctic Circle, so that they will have them there when they start in all over again.
[03:44:42.833 --> 03:44:46.535]  John in North Carolina, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:44:46.535 --> 03:44:46.995]  Thank you.
[03:44:46.995 --> 03:44:48.576]  I appreciate the opportunity.
[03:44:48.576 --> 03:44:49.676]  I know your time is short.
[03:44:52.194 --> 03:44:53.835]  A couple things.
[03:44:53.835 --> 03:44:58.177]  We had black helicopters directly over our house just the day before yesterday.
[03:44:58.177 --> 03:44:59.718]  I was trying to get in with you.
[03:44:59.718 --> 03:45:02.019]  They were scanning you?
[03:45:02.019 --> 03:45:07.241]  Well, I mean, they were right over our house looking in our windows.
[03:45:07.241 --> 03:45:08.742]  I mean, within a hundred feet.
[03:45:09.448 --> 03:45:10.129]  Yeah, they do that.
[03:45:10.129 --> 03:45:11.890]  Everybody gets those visits.
[03:45:11.890 --> 03:45:13.191]  It's all part of being a slave.
[03:45:13.191 --> 03:45:17.375]  The thing is, we have no criminal history at all.
[03:45:17.375 --> 03:45:18.436]  That's why!
[03:45:18.436 --> 03:45:20.558]  If you were a criminal, they'd like you.
[03:45:20.558 --> 03:45:23.740]  They don't like producing good red-blooded Americans.
[03:45:23.740 --> 03:45:27.284]  The MIAC report, Homeland Security, says you are the enemy.
[03:45:27.284 --> 03:45:31.387]  Right, and they were definitely showing that.
[03:45:31.387 --> 03:45:35.691]  I've been talking to people around here and showing them the 800 FEMA camps.
[03:45:36.300 --> 03:45:49.106]  And yesterday I was at the Hertford Chamber of Commerce and got the pandemic flu in you, which is to be given to the... This is a checklist for the employers.
[03:45:49.106 --> 03:46:04.294]  And right down in there, and I take and I show this right along with the detention... Anyway, concentration camps under 1.2 plan for the... It says, plan for the impact of a
[03:46:05.017 --> 03:46:05.397]  I'm good.
[03:46:21.857 --> 03:46:23.078]  Yeah, send that to us.
[03:46:23.078 --> 03:46:25.178]  We've seen that in the news, but it's always good.
[03:46:25.178 --> 03:46:28.500]  Send it to writers at InfoWars.com.
[03:46:28.500 --> 03:46:29.300]  God bless you, sir.
[03:46:29.300 --> 03:46:48.368]  I've got to move quick because we're almost out of time, but we just put up on screen, Vioxx maker Merck and co-drew up Dr. Hit List, an international drug company made a hit list of doctors who had to be neutralized or discredited because they criticized their anti-arthritis drug, the pharmacological giant produced.
[03:46:49.068 --> 03:46:59.732]  And of course what they do is they demonize them, they marginalize them, they get them in front of a group of doctors and they laugh at them and it takes a lot of courage to stand up against them and say
[03:47:15.499 --> 03:47:19.503]  Why are you doing things that are going to damage and kill people?
[03:47:19.503 --> 03:47:22.807]  Well, I tell you what, I was in the House of Delegates of the California Medical
[03:47:38.046 --> 03:47:38.906]  We're good to go.
[03:48:00.993 --> 03:48:04.055]  But people say most are black.
[03:48:04.055 --> 03:48:08.477]  They're just going to put a red ribbon on and go to a dinner and feel good.
[03:48:08.477 --> 03:48:17.342]  So the globalists are also good at creating movements of charities around the black ops they're running to then act like they're the saviors while they do it.
[03:48:17.342 --> 03:48:18.402]  It's so sick.
[03:48:18.402 --> 03:48:20.943]  I know it really is.
[03:48:20.943 --> 03:48:29.548]  But one day Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and Farrakhan are going to have to stand before the Lord and answer for what they've done and the betrayal of the black people.
[03:48:30.162 --> 03:48:30.422]  I hear you.
[03:48:30.422 --> 03:48:33.666]  We're going to have you back up soon about the whole HIV situation.
[03:48:33.666 --> 03:48:38.090]  John, is it John in North Carolina next or is it Steve?
[03:48:38.090 --> 03:48:39.171]  Steven in Texas.
[03:48:39.171 --> 03:48:40.673]  You're on the air with Dr. Stan Monteef.
[03:48:42.231 --> 03:48:44.532]  Dr. Monti, it's good to talk to you.
[03:48:44.532 --> 03:48:53.954]  As a Bible-believing Christian, I'm sure you've heard of Jonathan Edwards, who preached the most well-known sermon in American history, Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.
[03:48:53.954 --> 03:49:02.675]  I don't know if you're aware of how he died, and this relates to vaccines, and I have something else I want to bring up if you have time, but in 1758, he was given the smallpox vaccine.
[03:49:05.600 --> 03:49:07.242]  And that's what killed him.
[03:49:07.242 --> 03:49:15.509]  Well, I wish we had John Jonathan Edwards back again because he led the great awakening in 1730 that saved America.
[03:49:15.509 --> 03:49:18.371]  Well, what we need is a great revival today.
[03:49:18.371 --> 03:49:22.435]  Short of that, I don't think we have any possibility of survival.
[03:49:22.435 --> 03:49:29.361]  And the other thing I wanted to ask is, have you ever heard of a book called Horrors of Vaccination Exposed and illustrated?
[03:49:29.361 --> 03:49:32.764]  Yeah, I've got a copy right here by my right hand.
[03:49:33.809 --> 03:49:40.455]  Yeah, and I had sent a copy of that to Alex, but I just wanted to give you real quick some quotes right at the beginning.
[03:49:40.455 --> 03:49:41.896]  It's real short.
[03:49:41.896 --> 03:49:51.485]  Dr. James J. Garth Wilkinson in 1876 said this, this amazing act is the homicidal insanity of a whole profession.
[03:49:51.485 --> 03:49:53.287]  This is blood assassination.
[03:49:53.976 --> 03:49:54.736]  And then another one.
[03:49:54.736 --> 03:49:57.577]  Vaccination is not always a harmless procedure.
[03:49:57.577 --> 03:50:01.777]  It must be looked upon as the production of an acute, infectious disease.
[03:50:01.777 --> 03:50:04.878]  Dr. Milton J. Rusino, 1914.
[03:50:04.878 --> 03:50:07.018]  And then finally, this is the kicker.
[03:50:07.018 --> 03:50:09.299]  Vaccination is a delusion.
[03:50:09.299 --> 03:50:11.399]  It's penal enforcement, a crime.
[03:50:11.399 --> 03:50:15.060]  Professor Alfred Russell Wallace, in the wonderful century, 1899.
[03:50:15.060 --> 03:50:17.240]  Yeah, let me stop you.
[03:50:17.240 --> 03:50:20.961]  For those that don't know, vaccination's over 300 years old.
[03:50:20.961 --> 03:50:22.221]  And I did get the PDF.
[03:50:22.901 --> 03:50:24.262]  We need to get a link to that up on the site.
[03:50:24.262 --> 03:50:26.264]  We have limited personnel and just can't do everything.
[03:50:26.264 --> 03:50:28.527]  I'm trying to finish a film today.
[03:50:28.527 --> 03:50:29.728]  It has to be done.
[03:50:29.728 --> 03:50:32.010]  Follow the Republic, but I appreciate your call.
[03:50:32.010 --> 03:50:35.693]  That's why everybody else should start radio shows, websites, get the word out.
[03:50:35.693 --> 03:50:37.015]  RadioLiberty.com.
[03:50:37.015 --> 03:50:40.498]  Great books, videos, materials at RadioLiberty.com.
[03:50:40.498 --> 03:50:43.241]  Dr. Monteith, thank you so much for spending time with us today.
[03:50:43.241 --> 03:50:44.462]  It's always a pleasure.
[03:50:44.462 --> 03:50:45.223]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:50:46.221 --> 03:50:46.822]  Thank you.
[03:50:46.822 --> 03:50:51.046]  Straight ahead, more key news on the economy as we wrap up this transmission.
[03:50:51.046 --> 03:50:56.051]  I'll have to spend more time tomorrow on the overall troop takeover of America.
[03:50:56.051 --> 03:50:56.552]  Stay with us.
[03:51:02.014 --> 03:51:03.595]  Are you constantly tired?
[03:51:03.595 --> 03:51:05.437]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[03:51:05.437 --> 03:51:08.739]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[03:51:08.739 --> 03:51:11.761]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:51:11.761 --> 03:51:18.406]  Liquid zeolite, available only at RestoreYourHelpNow.com, captures toxins and physically carries them out of your body.
[03:51:18.406 --> 03:51:23.070]  This safe and effective way of detoxifying can easily remove heavy metals and contaminants.
[03:51:23.070 --> 03:51:31.296]  Studies show that liquid zeolite captures triggering antigens which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[03:51:31.616 --> 03:51:40.061]  Liquid Zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that, when taken daily, supports a healthy, happy and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.
[03:51:40.061 --> 03:51:43.364]  And Liquid Zeolite is so gentle that you won't even know you're taking it.
[03:51:43.364 --> 03:51:46.926]  Although your list of ailments may be endless, the solution is simple.

[03:52:02.176 --> 03:52:07.981]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:07.981 --> 03:52:14.967]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:15.555 --> 03:52:22.142]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:22.142 --> 03:52:24.124]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:24.124 --> 03:52:26.626]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.626 --> 03:52:37.598]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.198 --> 03:52:39.859]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.859 --> 03:52:41.720]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:41.720 --> 03:52:48.624]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.624 --> 03:52:56.909]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.909 --> 03:52:58.470]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.470 --> 03:52:59.671]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.485 --> 03:53:07.387]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[03:53:07.387 --> 03:53:12.508]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[03:53:12.508 --> 03:53:13.728]  That was then.
[03:53:13.728 --> 03:53:15.008]  This is now.
[03:53:15.008 --> 03:53:17.729]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[03:53:17.729 --> 03:53:23.791]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to 4 hours of real-time audio and video.
[03:53:23.791 --> 03:53:25.091]  The DigiNet Sunglasses are
[03:53:25.131 --> 03:53:25.571]  We're good to go.
[03:54:06.568 --> 03:54:08.069]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:54:08.069 --> 03:54:08.730]  to 3 p.m.
[03:54:08.730 --> 03:54:09.610]  Central Standard Time.
[03:54:09.610 --> 03:54:10.551]  We're here live.
[03:54:10.551 --> 03:54:13.213]  Dr. Ron Paul's on the show tomorrow.
[03:54:13.213 --> 03:54:15.975]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny's on the radio show tomorrow.
[03:54:15.975 --> 03:54:20.899]  We've got Dave Mustaine from Megadeth with his new album, In Game.
[03:54:20.899 --> 03:54:23.221]  The people in mass graves and plastic coffins.
[03:54:23.221 --> 03:54:26.563]  Guess who influenced that?
[03:54:26.563 --> 03:54:28.225]  So he'll be joining us.
[03:54:28.225 --> 03:54:29.686]  And a lot of other big guests.
[03:54:29.686 --> 03:54:30.807]  Dave Mustaine's tomorrow, right?
[03:54:32.233 --> 03:54:32.653]  Friday.
[03:54:32.653 --> 03:54:33.554]  Friday, excuse me.
[03:54:33.554 --> 03:54:35.114]  A bunch of big guests this week.
[03:54:35.114 --> 03:54:37.595]  Charlie Sheen is on next week with another big announcement.
[03:54:37.595 --> 03:54:39.716]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:54:39.716 --> 03:54:41.417]  Phase 2 of our operation.
[03:54:41.417 --> 03:54:43.378]  And yes, I know I've dropped the ball.
[03:54:43.378 --> 03:54:44.798]  I've bitten off more than I can chew.
[03:54:44.798 --> 03:54:48.800]  I know I'm like a week late announcing the winner of the last contest.
[03:54:49.889 --> 03:55:01.877]  When I got off air today, because there were hundreds of videos to watch, I watched a bunch last week, watched them again, couldn't decide, showed them to guys, because I really take this serious, and then noticed that one of the people...
[03:55:02.796 --> 03:55:06.278]  Had won last time, and I'm... There are no contest rules.
[03:55:06.278 --> 03:55:07.258]  It's whoever I want to win.
[03:55:07.258 --> 03:55:11.360]  I'm thinking, I guess the best man win, or maybe they'll get second place.
[03:55:11.360 --> 03:55:11.860]  I'm not sure.
[03:55:11.860 --> 03:55:13.381]  I'm trying to watch them all.
[03:55:13.381 --> 03:55:15.222]  I'm going to try to announce it tomorrow, but it'll get announced.
[03:55:15.222 --> 03:55:17.703]  And we have the other big Charlie Sheen contest coming up.
[03:55:17.703 --> 03:55:19.023]  It's $13,000 plus dollars.
[03:55:19.023 --> 03:55:20.324]  $10,000 after taxes.
[03:55:20.324 --> 03:55:22.505]  We want this to be $10,000 you actually get.
[03:55:22.505 --> 03:55:26.707]  I'm going to have that up by next week, but I'm finishing Fall of the Republic.
[03:55:26.707 --> 03:55:31.069]  And the whole Charlie Sheen thing got me behind a couple weeks on the film doing that whole thing.
[03:55:31.849 --> 03:55:35.892]  And just bear with us, because I'm just, I'm not whining, but I'm just overwhelmed here.
[03:55:35.892 --> 03:55:39.795]  The harvest of exposing corruption is so big.
[03:55:39.795 --> 03:55:41.316]  We've got three minutes left in the show.
[03:55:41.316 --> 03:55:44.218]  I just want to beg listeners, all I want to do is reach more people.
[03:55:44.218 --> 03:55:49.701]  And I want to thank you for supporting us by buying the books and videos we sell on Infowars.com, like Camp FEMA.
[03:55:49.701 --> 03:55:54.024]  I want to thank all the listeners that are PrisonPlanet.tv members and watch the live show, 15 cents a day.
[03:55:54.024 --> 03:55:57.407]  I want to thank all the sponsors, and I want to ask you to spread the word.
[03:55:58.007 --> 03:55:59.288]  Anybody can listen on the internet.
[03:55:59.288 --> 03:56:04.152]  If you don't have an AM and FM in your area, everybody can listen on the free podcast and the listen page.
[03:56:04.152 --> 03:56:05.993]  Everybody can listen on the free streams.
[03:56:05.993 --> 03:56:07.715]  Spread the word about the show.
[03:56:07.715 --> 03:56:09.876]  I think we're telling it like it is, like nobody else.
[03:56:09.876 --> 03:56:11.398]  We have the most informative guest.
[03:56:11.398 --> 03:56:12.939]  The last three minutes, Ted Anderson.
[03:56:14.201 --> 03:56:16.122]  You bought gold when it was well below 1,000.
[03:56:16.122 --> 03:56:17.742]  You've almost run out of that gold.
[03:56:17.742 --> 03:56:24.484]  It's up at 1,200, I mean, 1,012, 1,020 today, back and forth.
[03:56:24.484 --> 03:56:27.025]  Silver, you're running out of it at that lower price.
[03:56:27.025 --> 03:56:30.026]  This'll probably be the last time at the lower price you can offer it.
[03:56:30.026 --> 03:56:36.348]  We've done this a few times where it was $9,011 what you bought it at when it was at 990-something.
[03:56:36.348 --> 03:56:38.468]  Now it's 1,000-something.
[03:56:38.468 --> 03:56:40.329]  Ted, tell folks about the special today.
[03:56:40.771 --> 03:56:44.133]  Yeah, Alex, right now we're still working on those Walking Liberty halves.
[03:56:44.133 --> 03:56:47.834]  They're at $8.69 or $173 per roll of 20.
[03:56:47.834 --> 03:56:50.496]  And $10 Liberties that are at $8.18.
[03:56:50.496 --> 03:56:52.256]  Both of those coins are going to go up.
[03:56:52.256 --> 03:56:55.818]  I've had my brokers come to me and they say, wait a minute, what am I going to tell people?
[03:56:55.818 --> 03:56:57.079]  I've got the regular price here.
[03:56:57.079 --> 03:56:58.919]  It's so much higher than what these are.
[03:56:58.919 --> 03:57:04.082]  And I just said, well, you're just going to have to hold on and let them know that this is an Alex Jones special and that's what we're doing.
[03:57:05.022 --> 03:57:13.707]  All I can say, Alex, is that gold has been holding over $1,000 an ounce, silver has been trading at that $17 level, and it isn't getting weaker.
[03:57:13.707 --> 03:57:14.507]  I wish it would.
[03:57:14.507 --> 03:57:16.948]  I wish I had another opportunity to buy in low.
[03:57:16.948 --> 03:57:24.212]  I mean, what I could do with gold at $9.11 again is just unbelievable, but I just... Let's be clear.
[03:57:24.212 --> 03:57:26.213]  You're selling silver at below spot.
[03:57:27.281 --> 03:57:37.367]  Well, I mean, just to make it clear, when you're buying Walking Liberty halves, you're never going to buy them at less than spot, but that coin contains just short of an ounce of silver, so you multiply by two.
[03:57:37.367 --> 03:57:37.967]  Well, then I'm confused.
[03:57:37.967 --> 03:57:42.450]  If it's a half ounce for $8.00 and what?
[03:57:42.450 --> 03:57:42.510]  $8.69.
[03:57:42.510 --> 03:57:48.734]  So two times that, two times that is a little above, a little bit above $17.00.
[03:57:48.734 --> 03:57:50.195]  Exactly.
[03:57:50.195 --> 03:57:51.676]  Well, I mean, compare it to this.
[03:57:51.676 --> 03:57:52.276]  Try to buy a U.S.
[03:57:52.276 --> 03:57:52.456]  silver.
[03:57:52.456 --> 03:57:53.917]  But wait a minute, that's not below spot?
[03:57:57.208 --> 03:58:01.730]  Spot 716, so I mean it's right at that particular level.
[03:58:01.730 --> 03:58:05.152]  But you can't buy it at this in any market conditions.
[03:58:05.152 --> 03:58:06.732]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:06.732 --> 03:58:11.234]  800, so it's right at spot.
[03:58:11.234 --> 03:58:11.914]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:11.914 --> 03:58:13.875]  Insane deals on gold and silver.
[03:58:13.875 --> 03:58:15.556]  Tell them the Alex Jones Specials.

[03:58:20.418 --> 03:58:23.199]  800-686-2237.

[03:58:24.900 --> 03:58:26.160]  Do not procrastinate.
[03:58:26.160 --> 03:58:27.581]  The brokers are there until midnight.
[03:58:27.581 --> 03:58:27.981]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:27.981 --> 03:58:28.081]  800-686-2237.

[03:58:39.485 --> 03:58:40.766]  Infowars.com.
[03:58:40.766 --> 03:58:43.227]  Go!
[03:58:43.227 --> 03:58:46.428]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:58:51.297 --> 03:58:54.658]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.658 --> 03:58:58.279]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.279 --> 03:59:02.861]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.861 --> 03:59:08.463]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.743 --> 03:59:13.527]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.527 --> 03:59:17.149]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.149 --> 03:59:21.953]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:21.953 --> 03:59:28.517]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.517 --> 03:59:30.479]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:30.959 --> 03:59:32.619]  Direct to you, and in your face!
[03:59:32.619 --> 03:59:36.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
