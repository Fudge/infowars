[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:38.360]  for the last month we have struggled to alert the public to the fact that nurses
[00:38.360 --> 00:43.600]  police medical workers daycare workers public school teachers are being fired
[00:43.600 --> 00:49.720]  are being threatened with being fired both are happening if they do not take
[00:49.720 --> 00:53.160]  the regular seasonal flu shot so they're setting the precedent to make that
[00:53.160 --> 00:59.440]  mandatory for everybody and the new H1N1 those injections start next week and
[00:59.440 --> 01:04.120]  now it's finally all over mainstream media going oh yes people are being
[01:04.120 --> 01:10.000]  fired you have to take it so Obama is a congenital liar as usual nothing he says
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.040]  is ever true just everything is a lie but of course he's a complete puppet

[01:42.280 --> 01:48.840]  over all the different facets of this but this is a maximum alert and I believe
[01:48.840 --> 01:57.160]  we've only put out a handful of what I call maximum alerts on infallwars.com
[01:57.160 --> 02:06.240]  and prisonpana.com over the years this is a maximum alert all the pieces of the
[02:06.240 --> 02:11.160]  puzzle are now in place it is completely clear what's going on and I want to
[02:11.160 --> 02:14.400]  speak directly to the military and police on this show today it just in
[02:14.400 --> 02:19.280]  case some of you out there listening don't understand what you're part of
[02:19.280 --> 02:23.360]  and just in case the public doesn't realize what's happening I want to break
[02:23.360 --> 02:26.880]  it down for you I want to break down the history of this and now what's
[02:26.880 --> 02:36.160]  currently happening here it is maximum alert US troops now occupying America and
[02:36.160 --> 02:44.320]  the spin that they are putting on this we're going to go over that today as
[02:44.320 --> 02:52.120]  well also finally time magazine and the BBC and others are admitting that the
[02:52.120 --> 02:57.160]  chemical cocktails and consumer products are destroying male fertility how
[02:57.160 --> 03:02.640]  many medical doctors how many endocrinologists at the old the glands
[03:02.640 --> 03:09.400]  how many medical scientists have we had on here chemist biologist to explain to
[03:09.400 --> 03:16.560]  you that out of thousands of different plastic formula in the 60s globally two
[03:16.560 --> 03:23.680]  different types of plastics were adopted for food and drink containment that
[03:23.680 --> 03:31.680]  leech high-powered gender-bending sterile it's now what did the White House
[03:31.680 --> 03:35.600]  scientists are called for in the government textbook you wrote a sterile
[03:35.600 --> 03:39.360]  it that leaches into the food and water it's in your food in your water it's a
[03:39.360 --> 03:43.680]  fact and I want to just explain something to people out there that think
[03:43.680 --> 03:46.400]  the establishment is cute and fun and think that you're part of the
[03:46.400 --> 03:51.920]  establishment I'll guarantee you you didn't get a memo to not drink this
[03:51.920 --> 03:54.920]  stuff and not eat this stuff unless you're part of the superclass that the
[03:54.920 --> 03:58.000]  head of the Kissinger group who we've interviewed admits they're setting up a
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.840]  world government there's only 6,000 super gophers super elite legates super
[04:03.840 --> 04:11.580]  elite individuals that hold power for less than 20 families now they get
[04:11.580 --> 04:18.640]  memos and they avoid all plastic they avoid all GMO they avoid all vaccines
[04:18.640 --> 04:25.120]  like the plague because it is a plague so I'm gonna go over that again for you
[04:25.120 --> 04:29.800]  today but I just want to again reach out to people this doesn't have to happen
[04:29.800 --> 04:33.680]  we don't have to live like this if we just have an awakening outside of the
[04:33.680 --> 04:38.520]  controlled media paradigm and just start making the choices not to drink this and
[04:38.520 --> 04:43.600]  not to eat this we have a few years in the market system to reverse this but
[04:43.600 --> 04:48.520]  soon they're gonna bankrupt the economy globally and consolidate it that they're
[04:48.520 --> 04:51.320]  gonna control everything they're shutting down the farms and ranches right

[08:36.640 --> 08:40.400]  hour we have a nurse who was fired for not taking the flu shot it is now
[08:40.400 --> 08:46.680]  admitted that this is happening and we're going to be breaking that down and
[08:46.680 --> 08:53.360]  covering it in detail our top story is a maximum alert US troops now occupying
[08:53.360 --> 08:59.320]  America from Michigan to California from Arizona to Texas to Florida to Iowa to
[08:59.320 --> 09:12.640]  Ohio to New York to Massachusetts regular army troops marines National Guard
[09:12.640 --> 09:32.800]  they are all they are all running around the country being deployed in an
[09:32.800 --> 09:37.680]  acclimation operation it doesn't matter if it's a county fair in the middle of
[09:37.680 --> 09:43.120]  nowhere in South Dakota it doesn't matter if it's a small town in Arizona or a
[09:43.120 --> 09:50.360]  big city in Texas it doesn't matter if it's an NFL football game a college
[09:50.360 --> 09:54.400]  football game a local football game and this has been going on for several
[09:54.400 --> 09:58.920]  decades but it's expanding it's getting larger and larger they have National
[09:58.920 --> 10:06.680]  Guard State Guard regular army marines come out and search people randomly at
[10:06.680 --> 10:10.440]  checkpoints randomly going into the city center randomly going into a high
[10:10.440 --> 10:14.000]  school football stadium we have the photos we have the videos they're in my
[10:14.000 --> 10:22.360]  film martial law we put out in 2005 this is on record and we would cover this and
[10:22.360 --> 10:26.520]  people would be in denial about it saying that's not happening it's Posse
[10:26.520 --> 10:31.120]  commentatus violation I videotaped in police state 2000 and police state to
[10:31.120 --> 10:36.000]  the takeover and police state three total enslavement marines all over the
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.120]  country coming in practicing taking over Hebron Maryland practicing taking
[10:41.120 --> 10:47.680]  over swansboro north Carolina practicing taking over areas of Oakland
[10:47.680 --> 10:52.320]  California and I would go and videotape it and the marines would walk over and
[10:52.320 --> 10:56.880]  say turn your camera off you're not allowed to videotape us and they would
[10:56.880 --> 11:00.840]  come up to other people that sent us footage in Maryland and with guns with
[11:00.840 --> 11:06.280]  the police and say in America you can't videotape plain clothes marines
[11:06.280 --> 11:12.520]  directing uniform marines and the Boy Scouts in quote hunting down militia
[11:12.520 --> 11:17.840]  members now it's admitted that they have the Boy Scouts working with them
[11:17.840 --> 11:29.840]  nationally the Girl Scouts and they've gone from maybe a hundred drills a year
[11:29.840 --> 11:34.720]  ten years ago and that's just a guesstimation to tens of thousands of
[11:34.720 --> 11:38.520]  drills and now they're not drills they'll just set up a checkpoint and
[11:38.520 --> 11:44.320]  start searching people they've done that with the army and marines remember
[11:44.320 --> 11:47.640]  three months ago we had the state representative on the governor of Tennessee
[11:47.640 --> 11:51.480]  put out a statement saying we are not gonna have army and National Guard and
[11:51.480 --> 11:56.440]  Homeland Security and FBI and BATF and local police and state police out
[11:56.440 --> 12:00.760]  shutting down highway searching cars and then for two weeks straight the
[12:00.760 --> 12:04.680]  military went ahead and did it and just told the governor shut up they said
[12:04.680 --> 12:07.560]  we're doing this under North com because the John Warner Defense
[12:07.560 --> 12:10.960]  Authorization Act states we have authorization to do this and the John
[12:10.960 --> 12:15.440]  Warner Defense Authorization Act let there be no debating this for any of you
[12:15.440 --> 12:20.440]  out there in denial the John Warner Defense Authorization Act states that
[12:20.440 --> 12:26.560]  Homeland Security will set up North com brigades to take control of the states
[12:26.560 --> 12:31.040]  from the governors and for civil insurrection army times a year ago
[12:31.040 --> 12:37.000]  so they're going to deploy one brigade then it was five brigades now it's
[12:37.000 --> 12:43.960]  379,000 troops so it brigades 4,000 divide that into 379,000 how many
[12:43.960 --> 12:50.320]  brigades is that it's a lot of brigades so it goes from 4,000 to 20,000 to 40,000
[12:50.320 --> 12:58.360]  to 100,000 to 379,000 and ladies and gentlemen they are deploying they are
[12:58.360 --> 13:02.560]  deploying you can read the press releases from the state police in Arizona in
[13:02.560 --> 13:07.720]  Texas in California where they just announced that they've got the army
[13:07.720 --> 13:11.360]  they've got the Marine Corps they've got the National Guard they've got the state
[13:11.360 --> 13:15.600]  guards it's all being federalized armories that were empty are now being
[13:15.600 --> 13:19.000]  turned into threat fusion threat integration centers with the local
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.120]  police county police state police in the military they're moving heavy armaments
[13:23.120 --> 13:29.440]  and light armaments into them the military doesn't work for America anymore
[13:29.440 --> 13:33.640]  it works for offshore banks that have bankrupt the country by design and are
[13:33.640 --> 13:37.720]  criminally bringing us into receivership and putting hundreds of
[13:37.720 --> 13:43.440]  thousands of dollars of debt with interest on every American 23.7 trillion
[13:43.440 --> 13:47.200]  has been stolen in the first 10 months of the banker takeover October 3rd we
[13:47.200 --> 13:51.360]  haven't gotten numbers in a month and a half it'll be over 28 trill when the
[13:51.360 --> 13:57.880]  numbers come in following the trend 28 trill right now is gone confirmed 23.7
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.640]  we have been completely and totally robbed and we could stand up and say
[14:02.640 --> 14:06.120]  this is illegal this is criminal we want to indict the Federal Reserve we want
[14:06.120 --> 14:14.320]  to arrest them we want to write off this fraudulent debt triage it that's not
[14:14.320 --> 14:18.640]  going to happen unless we have a mass awakening you understand they've written
[14:18.640 --> 14:25.000]  the white papers professor Barnett at the Navy War College brags that the
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.360]  military works for offshore corporations in the New World Order I called him up
[14:29.360 --> 14:32.560]  to get him on the show he canceled I called him up I said weren't you coming
[14:32.560 --> 14:35.120]  on he goes I found out who you are and I said look your new world order
[14:35.120 --> 14:38.040]  takeover is going to fail you're not going to bring America down he started
[14:38.040 --> 14:43.920]  laughing at me and he said yeah no you're gonna fail you can't stop us I
[14:43.920 --> 14:48.120]  mean these people sit there on the phone saying you're not gonna stop us I mean
[14:48.120 --> 14:53.440]  it's just so sick I mean they just sit there literally laughing and growling at
[14:53.440 --> 14:56.920]  me on the phone it's so funny to them because it's all about winning to these
[14:56.920 --> 15:00.800]  people you think we can have a military that's half the military on the planet
[15:00.800 --> 15:04.200]  more than half the military expenditure on the planet you think they can go
[15:04.200 --> 15:07.360]  overthrow hundreds of third-world countries run black op run child
[15:07.360 --> 15:14.600]  kidnapping rings engage in every form of corruption and evil and then engage in
[15:14.600 --> 15:17.600]  domestic propaganda operations the Pentagon admits they're involved in
[15:17.600 --> 15:21.280]  and planting false news and that they wouldn't try to take over the country
[15:21.280 --> 15:24.920]  it's Lockheed Martin that runs most the red light camera systems it's other
[15:24.920 --> 15:29.280]  defense contractors that now own the big private prisons in America they are
[15:29.280 --> 15:33.400]  conquering our economy and fully integrating an end of the banks they
[15:33.400 --> 15:40.000]  are taking over now the average 19-year-old National Guard person these

[16:25.640 --> 16:32.120]  Kentucky and Tennessee and Arizona that have come in the last few days and they
[16:32.120 --> 16:36.080]  are there looking at citizens in the eyes looking at their bags and we have

[34:33.920 --> 34:47.520]  tree just stood there along big John big John big John big bad John all right
[34:47.520 --> 34:50.920]  we are back live
[34:50.920 --> 34:58.560]  there's a light up above and 20 men scrambled from a would-be grave now
[34:58.560 --> 35:05.160]  there's only one left down in the same big John with Jackson timbers they
[35:05.160 --> 35:13.960]  start ladies and gentlemen words cannot describe how serious our peril is how
[35:13.960 --> 35:19.880]  real intangible this criminal takeover is do you know how Hitler was able to
[35:19.880 --> 35:24.160]  take over France they always talk about how he did a blitzkrieg around the
[35:24.160 --> 35:29.360]  Maginot line and how he defeated the French in just a couple weeks and the
[35:29.360 --> 35:36.880]  British have evacuated at Dunkirk and then Hitler allowed them to leave
[35:37.720 --> 35:44.280]  Hitler had made deals with the high command of the French military that's
[35:44.280 --> 35:50.760]  why they're called the Vici French out of the town of Vici they made a deal to
[35:50.760 --> 35:58.280]  stand down and so over 80% of the French military stood down and that's how the
[35:58.280 --> 36:02.920]  corporate takeover happened and the Nazis then gave control to the Nazi
[36:02.920 --> 36:10.520]  sympathizers the Vici to run France and that is the story of what happened there
[36:10.520 --> 36:16.200]  and it's the same thing here foreign corporations the fortune 100 of the
[36:16.200 --> 36:22.240]  hundred biggest economies more than 50 your corporations not countries went in
[36:22.240 --> 36:27.880]  and covertly bought off our military our police our government our Congress
[36:27.880 --> 36:32.240]  predominantly and that the guys of the national security the National Security
[36:32.240 --> 36:36.440]  Council have now set up Northcom as the military governorship of the United
[36:36.440 --> 36:41.040]  States just like Iraq is a puppet state run by the globalist via the US military
[36:41.040 --> 36:44.280]  and they have a puppet government that if it doesn't do what it's told it's
[36:44.280 --> 36:49.920]  killed it's overthrown and they tell us on the news that Muhammad Karzai is in a
[36:49.920 --> 36:57.560]  puppet in Afghanistan and that the president of Iraq is in a puppet if you
[36:57.560 --> 37:01.880]  believe that I got a bridge I'll be happy to sell you I've got some ocean front
[37:01.880 --> 37:06.800]  property in Arizona and from my front porch you can see the sea as George
[37:06.800 --> 37:18.840]  straight would say and all over the nation the Marines the Army the National
[37:18.840 --> 37:24.560]  Guard the State Guards have been federally funded to run checkpoints all
[37:24.560 --> 37:28.080]  over the nation to acclimate the public and this is on record and Homeland
[37:28.080 --> 37:32.400]  Security has announced that the 379,000 troops that they're gonna phase in
[37:32.400 --> 37:36.480]  deployed in every town and city in America Pentagon's own words say even
[37:36.480 --> 37:42.680]  small towns this is all being done according to the Homeland Security
[37:42.680 --> 37:47.920]  reports that we broke the quote deal with American gun owners anti-fetal
[37:47.920 --> 37:53.080]  reserve activists and the Tea Parties and there have been National Guard and
[37:53.080 --> 37:58.040]  Army Intelligence and Regular Army we broke this months before it came out
[37:58.040 --> 38:03.520]  in the Baltimore Sun regular Army is spying and watching and
[38:03.520 --> 38:08.200]  surveilling in plain clothes all the Tea Parties all the in-the-fed rallies
[38:08.200 --> 38:16.200]  Ron Paul when he goes and gives a speech in Houston or in Lake Jackson it's on
[38:16.200 --> 38:20.440]  record the Army documents are public the Army is there watching him that's
[38:20.440 --> 38:26.880]  treason and Ed in California called in it says vet that disagrees but then hung
[38:26.880 --> 38:32.880]  up hey Ed you disagree call up and tell me I'm wrong call up and tell me I'm an
[38:32.880 --> 38:38.280]  anti-John Wayne anti-American person because I don't like the Army spying on
[38:38.280 --> 38:45.060]  myself and Ron Paul and others go ahead and tell me Ed everything's fine go
[38:45.060 --> 38:47.840]  ahead and laugh at me Ed go ahead and tell me there's no such thing as a new
[38:47.840 --> 38:52.360]  world order tell me whatever it is you're gonna tell me
[38:52.360 --> 39:01.080]  1-800-259-9231 we're gonna go to Jim a vet Dan and mass security officer and
[39:01.080 --> 39:06.040]  others speaking of mass though before I break all this down in detail and
[39:06.040 --> 39:09.400]  everybody to listen very carefully and check out every claim I make because
[39:09.400 --> 39:14.080]  it's all on the record no more time for denial here and then what I think should
[39:14.080 --> 39:19.720]  be done about all this let's just play judge Napolitano the one good person on
[39:19.720 --> 39:25.400]  Fox that's why they just have him as a contributor who'll tell you like it is he
[39:25.400 --> 39:28.400]  was against the Patriot Act when Bush was in he's against it now when Obama's
[39:28.400 --> 39:32.280]  in the only good person on Fox we've had him on the show I've been on his
[39:32.280 --> 39:38.640]  internet show internet Fox TV show only once though before they came down on him
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.880]  here he is telling you about the law on the governor's desk now in Massachusetts
[39:43.880 --> 39:47.680]  to come into your house without warrants and remember now they're saying
[39:47.680 --> 39:50.480]  without warrants the feds are federalizing local police to give you
[39:50.480 --> 39:56.360]  hundred thousand dollar fine the first infraction via a regulation of fifteen
[39:56.360 --> 40:01.000]  million dollar fine the second for selling any recalled product of tens of
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.520]  thousands as if anybody knows what's been recalled and what hadn't been
[40:04.520 --> 40:12.360]  recalled no warrant no nothing and they addressed you it's all about warrantless
[40:12.360 --> 40:17.960]  searches knock-and-talk from Illinois to Texas in Dallas they come to your door
[40:17.960 --> 40:21.120]  and say mind if I come in and see your guns in upscale neighborhoods and the
[40:21.120 --> 40:26.080]  Dallas Morning News reports it like it's a good thing they do it everywhere all
[40:26.080 --> 40:32.920]  over the nation I see reports every day of oh three or four or five army liaison
[40:32.920 --> 40:37.400]  officers from the regular army from Homeland Security have been given as a
[40:37.400 --> 40:41.800]  federal grant to the Spokane Washington and they go through the list of the
[40:41.800 --> 40:46.920]  towns police department and they're going to be assigned to the police
[40:46.920 --> 40:53.320]  intelligence office looking for local threats yes army spies in the police
[40:53.320 --> 40:58.400]  department totally criminal totally anti-american and again they told you
[40:58.400 --> 41:02.760]  all of this was for al-Qaeda but now they admit it's for you the gun owners and
[41:02.760 --> 41:06.080]  they've got bills introduced to basically ban any firearm they want when they
[41:06.080 --> 41:09.400]  want just dictatorial power to be given to John P. Holdren who argued as a
[41:09.400 --> 41:14.680]  Justice Department lawyer a year and a half ago in the DC Heller case for a
[41:14.680 --> 41:18.960]  complete gunman nationwide saying there is no individual right to keep their
[41:18.960 --> 41:23.560]  arms and then we say hey we don't want you to be able to pass that law and they
[41:23.560 --> 41:28.840]  say we don't want your guns the same military tactic ever seen Mars attacks
[41:28.840 --> 41:33.080]  funny comedy movie when the aliens are running around shooting people they
[41:33.080 --> 41:37.840]  they broadcast on loudspeakers don't run we are your friends and the people come
[41:37.840 --> 41:41.600]  out and put their hands up and the aliens shoot them see the director of that
[41:41.600 --> 41:47.480]  movies throwing in your face a favorite military tactic from World War one and
[41:47.480 --> 41:52.000]  on they will broadcast over loudspeakers the war is over we are your friends come
[41:52.000 --> 41:57.640]  out with your hands up and they mow you down when you do it and these average
[41:57.640 --> 42:01.240]  military men are being acclimated these military women are being acclimated
[42:01.240 --> 42:05.120]  their first announced they think it's normal they say oh we're just gonna have
[42:05.120 --> 42:10.400]  a local college football game go run traffic in the parking lot go volunteer
[42:10.400 --> 42:13.120]  to help your community the police are overstrapped and then we see the mayor
[42:13.120 --> 42:19.040]  of Birmingham Alabama the mayor of Schenectady New York scores of other
[42:19.040 --> 42:22.360]  towns and cities announcing oh we've got a police shortage they've only tripled
[42:22.360 --> 42:26.800]  the police the last few years now the city's on the unfunded mandates the feds
[42:26.800 --> 42:30.960]  only pay for about 10% of it can't pay for it and so they go oh we'll just lay
[42:30.960 --> 42:37.120]  off cops and bring the army in that's in the news and then I get emails and see
[42:37.120 --> 42:41.680]  comments on info wars for people going I'm in the army yeah we go out and help
[42:41.680 --> 42:45.200]  the community at checkpoints yeah we're going out and helping look for drunk
[42:45.200 --> 42:51.240]  drivers what are you for drunk drivers Alex you're being acclimated sir they
[42:51.240 --> 42:55.680]  do that so that it sounds reasonable oh I'm just helping at a checkpoint stop
[42:55.680 --> 42:59.000]  drunk drivers and I told you two years ago when they started announcing this
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.120]  when Northcom announced it I said that we would then have these arguments of
[43:03.120 --> 43:07.840]  them go we're stopping drugs well the army's doing star flight
[43:07.840 --> 43:12.640]  medevac we're the local town doesn't have enough helicopters so when a child
[43:12.640 --> 43:17.720]  stuck in a car we come with the jaws of life and get them out do you like being
[43:17.720 --> 43:22.400]  played like a fool do you like buying propaganda hook line and sinker our
[43:22.400 --> 43:27.560]  military doesn't belong to us anymore our country's been seized criminally in a
[43:27.560 --> 43:33.520]  corporate hostile takeover by offshore banks but here's Judge Napolitano telling
[43:33.520 --> 43:38.360]  you like it is everywhere as they use different pretext drunk driving the flu
[43:38.360 --> 43:43.320]  dangerous toys for children and products being sold at flea markets and
[43:43.320 --> 43:47.120]  garage sales and oh the Amish can't sell eggs on the street corner because the
[43:47.120 --> 43:50.800]  eggs might be poisonous and they can't sell cheese and they can't sell water
[43:50.800 --> 43:54.640]  melons and we've got a they won't vaccinate their kids so the CPS have to
[43:54.640 --> 43:58.560]  take hundreds of their kids a month that we know of in Illinois and Ohio and we
[43:58.560 --> 44:01.000]  did the government's just doing all this and we have to take your blood at
[44:01.000 --> 44:04.240]  checkpoints without warrants to stop drunk drivers well why didn't we do it
[44:04.240 --> 44:10.680]  before because there's a fourth amendment this is total takeover you are
[44:10.680 --> 44:16.560]  the target living in your $300,000 house driving your $25,000 Tahoe with a
[44:16.560 --> 44:20.400]  swimming pool in the backyard you're gonna be made a slave the only jobs the
[44:20.400 --> 44:25.000]  economy are gonna be surveillance checkpoints prisons camera operators
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.120]  and working in the factories that make them they're converting the whole
[44:29.120 --> 44:32.960]  economy they write white papers on it they brag a handful of global
[44:32.960 --> 44:39.760]  corporations are going to re-engineer the economy here's Judge Napolitano the
[44:39.760 --> 44:43.720]  N1 virus has made thousands of people across the country sick many have died
[44:43.720 --> 44:48.640]  and some worrying that it could grow into a full-blown pandemic well one
[44:48.640 --> 44:52.160]  state the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is preparing for that with a very
[44:52.160 --> 44:56.440]  controversial bill Massachusetts proposing legislation that would allow
[44:56.440 --> 45:02.080]  police to forcefully quarantine residents and even impose martial law
[45:02.080 --> 45:07.840]  without a warrant could that possibly be constitutional we've called in Fox News
[45:07.840 --> 45:12.880]  senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano hey Steve so because
[45:12.880 --> 45:17.520]  apparently they're worried that the swine flu is a public safety issue they're
[45:17.520 --> 45:22.360]  talking about a law where the police can knock on your door right or not
[45:22.360 --> 45:26.200]  necessarily knocking your door just go in and essentially quarantine you while
[45:26.200 --> 45:29.880]  they're doing more than talking about a law the state of Massachusetts the both
[45:29.880 --> 45:33.320]  houses of the legislature have enacted this law and once governor the
[45:33.320 --> 45:37.640]  val Patrick signs it and he says that he will it'll become the law and it will
[45:37.640 --> 45:43.680]  allow him to declare an emergency and once he declares an emergency he can
[45:43.680 --> 45:48.780]  authorize non-healthcare licensed personnel read that to mean police to
[45:48.780 --> 45:52.640]  vaccinate people against their will now can they force adults to take
[45:52.640 --> 45:58.000]  vaccination no they will incarcerate adults without a trial without charges
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.480]  without even a search warrant who refused to be a vaccinated this is what
[46:02.480 --> 46:06.480]  the statute authorizes it also authorized the statute and the statute
[46:06.480 --> 46:11.400]  also authorized the police to remove children from adults vaccinate them
[46:11.400 --> 46:15.080]  against the will of the child and the will of the parents this this is so
[46:15.080 --> 46:18.320]  troubling on so many different levels I mean first of all you think wait a minute
[46:18.320 --> 46:22.520]  they've got a great big list with everybody who got a flu shots name on it
[46:22.520 --> 46:28.800]  and are they gonna just have neighbors turn into other neighbors they're sick
[46:28.800 --> 46:33.520]  well got the shot it's interesting you say that there there is not a clause in
[46:33.520 --> 46:38.600]  the statute that requires you to report a neighbor but the government will you
[46:38.600 --> 46:42.520]  know it will do it look this is this is the reason why we have federal judges
[46:42.520 --> 46:46.240]  because federal judges in Massachusetts will have to take this statute and
[46:46.240 --> 46:50.880]  compare it to the Constitution and the Constitution says the police can't break
[46:50.880 --> 46:54.280]  into your home and the police can't take your children away from you and
[46:54.280 --> 46:58.840]  parents decide what medication the children get not the government man the
[46:58.840 --> 47:02.960]  first time if this were to happen and the first time they some cop goes in and
[47:02.960 --> 47:07.460]  gives some kid a shot it's gonna hit the fan yes it will and the state of
[47:07.460 --> 47:11.360]  Massachusetts will be sorry it enacted this because people will revolt against
[47:11.360 --> 47:16.240]  it all right judge and in a politics all right under the executive order signed by
[47:16.240 --> 47:20.920]  Bush expanded by Obama it allows all of this it's totally criminal they had
[47:20.920 --> 47:25.600]  executive orders about forced sterilizing Americans under eugenics they had
[47:25.600 --> 47:29.680]  laws that blacks weren't human it's all a fraud does a black man chained up as a
[47:29.680 --> 47:33.200]  slave pulling a plow have a right to say I'm a human being I'm not a slave and
[47:33.200 --> 47:39.600]  fight back yes he does even the law says he doesn't have a right now this is
[47:39.600 --> 47:43.800]  probably all just a big martial law drill they're gonna do force inoculations
[47:43.800 --> 47:46.960]  they're making nurses and others do it they're gonna try to set the precedent
[47:46.960 --> 47:50.920]  and then a year or two later it'll be a bigger operation and bigger and bigger
[47:50.920 --> 47:54.800]  it's all a process because they know it's very hard to beat incrementalism
[47:54.800 --> 47:59.480]  Jim is a vet in Illinois Dan and mass security officer Juan in New York
[47:59.480 --> 48:03.320]  healthcare worker Lori in Texas just saw Homeland Security buses yeah we see
[48:03.320 --> 48:07.320]  Homeland Security armored vehicles here in Austin now white ones little armored
[48:07.320 --> 48:12.320]  trucks big Homeland Security buses they took over the old Highland Mall that
[48:12.320 --> 48:16.400]  shut down I tell the idiot public this and they email me laughing at me even
[48:16.400 --> 48:19.400]  though it's right down there in Highland Mall it's just all very funny to you
[48:19.400 --> 48:23.840]  isn't it it's all very funny and Obama saying you don't have to take the shots
[48:23.840 --> 48:30.160]  but then meanwhile they're forcing everybody and getting ready for it let's
[48:30.160 --> 48:35.240]  talk to Jim Jim go ahead I saw that piece we are changed it on the Ohio
[48:35.240 --> 48:38.800]  National Guard and I want to suggest that maybe they get the picture Marianne
[48:38.800 --> 48:43.360]  Beckio kneeling over the dead body of Jeffrey Miller taking May 4th 1970 when
[48:43.360 --> 48:47.720]  the Ohio National Guard fired on peaceful students at Kent State you know so
[48:47.720 --> 48:52.040]  they could be reminded you know of what happened when we see the feds learned
[48:52.040 --> 48:55.720]  they're gonna stage their own Kent States where they're gonna have their
[48:55.720 --> 49:01.920]  own people shoot police who won't even know they'll disappear into the crowd
[49:01.920 --> 49:04.040]  they've been caught doing this all over the world and then they're gonna mow
[49:04.040 --> 49:06.880]  everybody down and just start slaughtering everybody with pleasure no
[49:06.880 --> 49:12.200]  of course agent for rocket tours yes but now you keep saying that the answer
[49:12.200 --> 49:18.080]  1984 1776 and I'd like to elaborate a little bit on that if I could sure if I
[49:18.080 --> 49:21.680]  could read something here though governments can originally have no other
[49:21.680 --> 49:25.640]  rides and that before mentioned nor policy be founded on anything but the
[49:25.640 --> 49:29.160]  consent of the people yet such have been the disorders ambition has filled the
[49:29.160 --> 49:33.200]  world with that in the no noise of war which makes so great a part of the
[49:33.200 --> 49:37.080]  history of mankind this consent is little taken notice of and therefore many
[49:37.080 --> 49:40.480]  have mistaken the force of arms for the consent of the people and wrecking
[49:40.480 --> 49:44.560]  conquest as one of the original government the conquest is far from
[49:44.560 --> 49:47.720]  setting up any government as the machine houses from building a new one in its
[49:47.720 --> 49:51.800]  place indeed it often makes way for a new frame of Commonwealth by destroying
[49:51.800 --> 49:56.000]  the former but without the consent of the people can never erect a new one that
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.440]  the aggressor who puts himself into a state of war with another and unjustly
[49:59.440 --> 50:03.520]  evades another man's right can by such an unjust warrant never come to have
[50:03.520 --> 50:07.480]  right over the conquered will be easily be agreed by all men who will not think
[50:07.480 --> 50:11.040]  that robbers and pirates have a right of empire over whomever they have force
[50:11.040 --> 50:14.960]  enough to master or that men are bound by promises which unlawful forces

[53:36.600 --> 53:40.080]  that if you're going to take something that if you're trading one problem for
[53:40.080 --> 53:44.120]  five or six other problems that's me doesn't make sense using something that
[53:44.120 --> 53:48.600]  is natural that is absorbed into the body typically because in a liquid form I

[54:17.280 --> 54:21.720]  pying the citizens and training the citizens that secret police on street
[54:21.720 --> 54:27.640]  corners and army uniforms are normal like it's downtown Baghdad Jim that John
[54:27.640 --> 54:32.680]  Locke quote for those that are on fluoride and didn't understand it those
[54:32.680 --> 54:36.600]  that support the establishment in this raping that's going on it's pointing
[54:36.600 --> 54:43.400]  out that naked brutal oppression is a fraud and is illegitimate and just the
[54:43.400 --> 54:46.720]  point I was making before I went to you about a black man not being a slave even
[54:46.720 --> 54:51.760]  if the law says he's not human it has no rights and that all these systems of looting
[54:51.760 --> 54:55.640]  can do is destroy societies but that's what the globalists want they want to
[54:55.640 --> 54:59.560]  deindustrialize and destroy all major societies in their own words finish up
[54:59.560 --> 55:04.600]  your point well I firmly believe that the action of the Second Continental
[55:04.600 --> 55:10.000]  Congress July 4 1776 United Units Declaration 13 United States is which
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.120]  was written by Jefferson because he was heavily influenced by Locke is nothing
[55:13.120 --> 55:16.880]  but you know a brief summarization of Locke's two treaties and I think it's
[55:16.880 --> 55:20.320]  very important for all free men to know that that because the political status
[55:20.320 --> 55:22.720]  begins in your mind you have to determine in your mind whether you're
[55:22.720 --> 55:26.320]  gonna be a slave that's right be a free man they're training us to be
[55:26.320 --> 55:30.720]  dominated and to capitulate thank you Jim Dan and master security officer go

[1:01:02.320 --> 1:01:05.520]  when she brought up Posse Comitatus they hung up on her we're gonna have the
[1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:10.320]  audio of that as well we have other video we are change Ohio and Kentucky
[1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:15.640]  with warrantless military checkpoints in the middle of the city they would walk
[1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:18.480]  up to them and say will you shoot us in the back of the head will you put us in
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:21.880]  death camps will you take our guns have ordered and the military wouldn't say
[1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:28.680]  they wouldn't very sick very very very very sick
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:35.920]  let's go back to Dan no one in New York one show you're a healthcare worker and
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:38.440]  they've said looks like it's gonna be mandatory well they're already ordering
[1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:42.080]  people that it's mandatory but they tell them don't tell anybody we're making you
[1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:46.520]  do this then Obama's there to soothe everyone and say don't worry they know
[1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:49.960]  the majority are against it and it's illegal so he tells you there's no
[1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:54.520]  attack happening and then all the surrogates go out and then try to force
[1:01:54.520 --> 1:01:58.680]  it when they corner you by yourself at work this is the nature of a military
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:06.880]  psiop hello yes sir oh yes so like I was I was saying before I don't know how
[1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:11.160]  they're gonna implement this because half the people that I talked to don't
[1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:16.120]  want to take the regular flu vaccine including me also the people the half
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:20.760]  the half that are do that do want to take the flu vaccine don't want to take
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:24.160]  the swine flu vaccine so I don't know what they're gonna are they gonna well
[1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:27.800]  that's it I mean there's no law you got to take the regular flu shot the
[1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:31.800]  executive order says under level six they can make you take the emergency shot
[1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:37.720]  but that's a illegal you in agreement and no it's totally illegal that's why
[1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:41.720]  Obama gets on TV every week and says you don't have to take it while they try to
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:47.840]  force it these are hardcore criminals also if you will allow me I like to tell
[1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:52.760]  you about a bright spot in this in this horrible situation the bright spot in
[1:02:52.760 --> 1:02:57.280]  the horrible situation is that I am now you know now that all this is coming out
[1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:02.200]  I am bumping into more and more people like-minded people so I was I always
[1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:06.560]  thought of myself as in the minority but as I speak to people people have these
[1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:10.400]  same views just take for instance yesterday I was in the neonatal intensive
[1:03:10.400 --> 1:03:17.480]  care unit and a nurse was talking about it with a doctor and they were both
[1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:21.480]  talking almost the same when I when I cornered the nurse alone she started
[1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:25.920]  spewing out a lot of things and I was like wow everything even about 9-11 and
[1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:29.240]  the government and everything so I immediately went down to my workstation
[1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:34.840]  where I keep copies of endgame because I find that that's the most the most
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:40.120]  effective orientating tool to people who have ideas but are very scattered about
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:43.240]  it so I immediately gave it to her and I said you should watch this tonight and
[1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:49.800]  I'm actually making her copies for of police state and lose change and things
[1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:56.000]  like that and if that's in this dark in this dark time that's one little
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  sliver of light that people are waking up and people are going to start to take
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.960]  action well the key is get the internal CDC report you can pull it up at info
[1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:12.480]  wars.com and prisonplanet.com or just the headline secret CDC report links
[1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:16.400]  vaccine to Gillian beret or to neurological disorders and then go
[1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:21.560]  here's the secret CDC report and you can pull up the CDC report from 2000 that
[1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:26.240]  got leaked in 2002 and Congress then released it where they were the head of
[1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:31.160]  the CDC said I wouldn't give this to my granddaughter any shots but we've got to
[1:04:31.160 --> 1:04:34.520]  keep us from the public we've got a mandate to push this look everybody's
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:37.880]  waking up to vaccines so they're staging this whole deal to try to set the
[1:04:37.880 --> 1:04:41.520]  precedent that they make us take the shots while they announce you don't
[1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:44.840]  have to take it they say you don't have to take it but you're fired if you don't
[1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:49.200]  well that's making you take it God bless you sir keep it up keep spreading the
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:54.560]  word yes as the tyranny intensifies it's a double-edged sword because now all
[1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:58.160]  these people that didn't want to wake up are forced to face the fact that we were
[1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:01.720]  right more call straight ahead stay with us the illusion created by the power
[1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:06.000]  elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat will you

[1:08:37.160 --> 1:08:42.160]  military people active duty involved in these checkpoints involved in all these
[1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:47.360]  drills the Marines involved in these illegal checkpoints or wives or husbands
[1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:51.400]  of these Marines and Army soldiers and National Guard call in I'm also trying to
[1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:56.080]  get a hold of we are change Ohio who shot the video in Kentucky boldly walked
[1:08:56.080 --> 1:09:02.440]  up and asked the National Guard that was out there searching bags running
[1:09:02.440 --> 1:09:06.240]  checkpoints staring at the citizens staring everybody down like secret
[1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:11.080]  police out of red dawn out of the Soviet Union they have done an incredible job
[1:09:11.080 --> 1:09:16.440]  this is how it's done fact go ahead who's and play that clip of we are
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:34.240]  change Ohio in Kentucky at military checkpoints here it is they wouldn't
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:10:03.640]  have no reason to make another one yeah well I wasn't in the states but would you agree with that like is that something the Army should be doing taking guns away from the citizen right just a soldier to do what I'm told but you did taking out for the Constitution now when you flag you're also sworn to the officers and the NCOs are above you but if the officer asks you to do something unconstitutional where does your
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:27.640]  loyalty lie I guess well if an officer is asking us to do something that's unconstitutional it's not coming from him he's not making it up it's coming from somebody higher than him right but then so the chain follows down it could come straight from the president president wants to stop done through you know that's on the president but you do not like it is your right to say no I mean it is but you just do what's for soldiers
[1:10:27.640 --> 1:10:47.640]  did you hear that yeah I've got a right to say no in lawful order they're commanded to in their training but they don't really give that training anymore but I'm still just going to follow my orders I will take your guns and they will take your guns they did it in Katrina and
[1:10:47.640 --> 1:11:06.640]  surrounding areas to set the president and they're trained in military nationwide to take your guns now they've created this cult of worshiping the military worshiping police but when they're bought and paid for by foreign offshore banks and they're destroying the bill of rights and Constitution they're attacking the Republic and they are domestic enemies of this country
[1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:19.640]  when they start going after our guns and our liberties and setting up illegal checkpoints they are the real enemy combatants but they've been trained that patriots and conservatives and libertarians and Ron Paul supporters and in the Fed protesters are terrorist
[1:11:19.640 --> 1:11:33.640]  no you are a treasonous treacherous criminal when you engage in these criminal activities and that's all they're doing is acclimating this this fool to carry this out let's go back to him
[1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:43.640]  Mike give a little bit more information and there's another checkpoint about two blocks in that direction with some people with a little higher rank than I am I have some information
[1:11:43.640 --> 1:12:03.640]  did you hear that there's another checkpoint I also have these delusional people sending me emails saying these aren't checkpoints yes they are you can go read the state police press releases around the country in Tennessee and California and other areas where they say they're warrantless checkpoints got it
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:14.640]  I got video and photos of them searching little kids bags in the middle of major cities and towns stop living in denial here's more video more audio
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:43.640]  an ambulance driving by and another checkpoint looks like Mayberry you got the military on their radios reporting what the citizens are doing watching everybody this is the most disgusting thing to watch
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:51.640]  these people are such traders and it doesn't matter if you don't know you're a trader you've rationalized it in your gut you know it's wrong
[1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:54.640]  this is just
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:13:13.640]  do you know how long this has been going on specifically here at river fast of how many years I know several years at least five or six at least
[1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:31.640]  it's been going on for 20 years in the last 10 it's accelerated you notice six years but now suddenly all over the country they're just everywhere we're getting confirmed reports and local blurbs about troops in the middle of nowhere at four way stops in the country
[1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:54.640]  here's the Pittsburgh Post Gazette about 2500 trips with the FBI with local police amazing and it says that the county city state and university camera systems are now hooked into the feds and there's a command center
[1:13:54.640 --> 1:14:13.640]  they have a photo here in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette headline MAAC organizes Pittsburgh security for G 20 and it says MAAC center and it's the military running the command center over the police and over everyone this is just unbelievable because they know how to occupy a country
[1:14:13.640 --> 1:14:16.640]  finish up with this clip and we're going to your calls
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:24.640]  we're military police which means we have military authority under Newport police department
[1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:27.640]  so do you have police powers
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:32.640]  no that is in conjunction with the police department
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:35.640]  are you guys trained with the police or like a local police or something
[1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:42.640]  military police are trained military police ways but we will assist the police officers that pass
[1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:47.640]  hit pause
[1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:58.640]  get the MPs out there and that's what they do they come out and say oh it's just traffic checkpoints oh oh got a guy with some marijuana got a drunk driver oh we're going to go over and help and then the troops help put the handcuffs on
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:01.640]  just unbelievable
[1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:06.640]  there aren't riots there aren't burning cities but the globalists know they're bankrupting the economy by design
[1:15:06.640 --> 1:15:13.640]  and they know the people are going to try to peacefully stand up and they're getting ready to crush the American people back to the club
[1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:16.640]  any kind of training operations
[1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:19.640]  not this police department
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:24.640]  uh chain of command they do interact with them and they get uh mission briefings
[1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:33.640]  um yeah so like we know so that there's a difference you guys are traffic control and then there's rover control or something like that
[1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:37.640]  the guys with the big guns like chillin with the humvees down there
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:39.640]  same thing same job same job same job same job
[1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:43.640]  all we are here to do is to uh reinforce the newport police department
[1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:47.640]  right so do you have any police power before it's like just the rest
[1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:55.640]  you like the military terms reinforce the newport police department reinforce them against the enemy that's what the military does
[1:15:55.640 --> 1:16:02.640]  they fight enemies and we have an imperial government an imperial military and they're stationed right here in the heart of the empire
[1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:06.640]  back to the club
[1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:08.640]  no
[1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:10.640]  what you're doing out of rest
[1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:14.640]  not unless asked to do so by New York our newport police department
[1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:19.640]  um do you know if this is like worked around uh homeland security at all
[1:16:19.640 --> 1:16:20.640]  no no
[1:16:20.640 --> 1:16:21.640]  that's a lie
[1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:22.640]  newport police department
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:23.640]  here it is
[1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:30.640]  it seems like it starts with like little things like this like we call this I mean this is a check point right
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:37.640]  National Guard's been responding to state we have been assisting law enforcement since National Guard's been in existence
[1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:39.640]  look for a more emergency
[1:16:39.640 --> 1:16:41.640]  right this is not an emergency situation
[1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:42.640]  well even
[1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:47.640]  it's gone from like a national emergency or state emergency over public events
[1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:52.640]  that's fine even I believe it's brown or brown versus board of education back in the 50s
[1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:53.640]  okay
[1:16:53.640 --> 1:16:54.640]  national cause
[1:16:54.640 --> 1:17:02.640]  so we yeah that's where they wouldn't let black kids into public school forcing the states forcing federal control
[1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:04.640]  he just admitted everything right there
[1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:06.640]  you see how they do this
[1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:08.640]  go back to him
[1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:09.640]  you're called for many things
[1:17:09.640 --> 1:17:10.640]  well that was
[1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:11.640]  that was a potential right
[1:17:11.640 --> 1:17:13.640]  yeah
[1:17:13.640 --> 1:17:15.640]  that was to let a girl go to school
[1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:18.640]  yeah well as like people were trying to kill her
[1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:20.640]  like a mob was trying to possibly kill her
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:22.640]  we are here to assist law enforcement
[1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:24.640]  that is our way
[1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:26.640]  how do you feel about that
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:28.640]  after the civil war
[1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:30.640]  and the war like by the south
[1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:31.640]  it's not my call
[1:17:31.640 --> 1:17:32.640]  what's that
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:33.640]  it's not my call
[1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:35.640]  Pascal take your guns in a minute
[1:17:35.640 --> 1:17:36.640]  if he's told you
[1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:38.640]  any words you're giving you just
[1:17:38.640 --> 1:17:41.640]  policy commentators can be placed on any civilian
[1:17:41.640 --> 1:17:44.640]  policy commentators can be placed on anybody by
[1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:47.640]  federalized law enforcement officer
[1:17:47.640 --> 1:17:48.640]  anybody
[1:17:48.640 --> 1:17:50.640]  so you consider yourself a law enforcement officer
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:52.640]  a military police
[1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:54.640]  that is it
[1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:56.640]  is there any
[1:17:56.640 --> 1:17:58.640]  good pause
[1:17:58.640 --> 1:17:59.640]  notice he now says
[1:17:59.640 --> 1:18:01.640]  policy commentators is his right
[1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:02.640]  to come against you
[1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:04.640]  you see they turn everything around
[1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:06.640]  remember our military killed a
[1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:08.640]  million three hundred thousand Iraqis
[1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:10.640]  in the last six and a half years
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:12.640]  they mean business folks go back to him
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:16.640]  be worthy of disobeying
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:18.640]  disobeying
[1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:20.640]  let's say that you were told to round up people
[1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:22.640]  to throw them in office
[1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:24.640]  he's asking about camps
[1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:26.640]  we're here to assist law enforcement
[1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:27.640]  that is it
[1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:29.640]  we're trying to get it as like
[1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:30.640]  what are you going to do
[1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:32.640]  do you want to slide more to the higher
[1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:34.640]  demands for order or the constitution
[1:18:34.640 --> 1:18:36.640]  woo
[1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:38.640]  that's pretty much what we're trying to do
[1:18:38.640 --> 1:18:40.640]  we have a duty to honor our
[1:18:40.640 --> 1:18:42.640]  that is it
[1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:45.640]  and then it cuts to the military
[1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:47.640]  checkpoints
[1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:49.640]  and the Humvees and the highway
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:51.640]  god help us
[1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:53.640]  okay Lori stay there you just homeland security
[1:18:53.640 --> 1:18:55.640]  bus in Texas Mike Louisiana
[1:18:55.640 --> 1:18:57.640]  the guy who called in to C-Span
[1:18:57.640 --> 1:18:58.640]  with Chertov
[1:18:58.640 --> 1:19:00.640]  Mike's a Massachusetts nurse
[1:19:00.640 --> 1:19:01.640]  Andy
[1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:03.640]  North Carolina vet we're going to continue
[1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:05.640]  with your phone calls and go to him quickly
[1:19:05.640 --> 1:19:07.640]  in the next segment
[1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:09.640]  but that's how it's done
[1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:11.640]  what we are change Ohio
[1:19:11.640 --> 1:19:13.640]  did this is all
[1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:15.640]  a mass checkpoint drill on the video
[1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:17.640]  at the end of the we are change Ohio
[1:19:17.640 --> 1:19:19.640]  Kentucky checkpoint video
[1:19:19.640 --> 1:19:21.640]  they just block off the whole bridge in the highway
[1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:23.640]  and they've got their Humvees
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:25.640]  their machine guns
[1:19:25.640 --> 1:19:27.640]  and they're just out there
[1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:29.640]  doing whatever they want
[1:19:31.640 --> 1:19:33.640]  they're out there training people to get used
[1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:35.640]  to seeing the military setting up checkpoints
[1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:37.640]  and all over the country they're searching people's bags
[1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:39.640]  this is high treason
[1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:41.640]  and there's incrementally warping
[1:19:41.640 --> 1:19:43.640]  the brains of the troops in the military
[1:19:43.640 --> 1:19:45.640]  to accept this and to go along with this

[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:23.640]  we'll play some of that in the background of We Are Change Ohio in Kentucky
[1:46:23.640 --> 1:46:27.640]  just at a community event all over the downtown city blocking bridges
[1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:31.640]  pointing machine guns at people off the tops of their Humvees
[1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:35.640]  and the military were asked they said would you confiscate our guns
[1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:39.640]  if you were ordered to do so and they said well we'll
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:45.640]  uh sneeze there on air that's a radio rarity they will uh
[1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:49.640]  follow the orders if they're told to
[1:46:49.640 --> 1:46:55.640]  so all of this is going on all of this is happening
[1:46:55.640 --> 1:47:01.640]  and for more than 20 years that we've confirmed this has been covertly going on
[1:47:01.640 --> 1:47:09.640]  now north com admits they want to put 378,000 regular army troops on the streets of america
[1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:13.640]  not just national guard they're putting local military liaison officers in
[1:47:13.640 --> 1:47:17.640]  this is part of the global corporate takeover this is incremental martial law
[1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:21.640]  we have the report maximum alert us troops now occupying america
[1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:25.640]  prisonplanet.com article from paul watson that boils all this down
[1:47:25.640 --> 1:47:29.640]  it's essential that you go to your city councils your county commissioners
[1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:33.640]  and you point out that the feds are federalizing those areas and you're aware of it
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:37.640]  scannactity new york mayor has asked for quote martial law that's his quote
[1:47:37.640 --> 1:47:41.640]  and for troops the mayor of birmingham has called for this the feds are
[1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:45.640]  giving him grants the feds are giving local police grants to take blood at checkpoints
[1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:49.640]  warrantlessly regular marines are running checkpoints in california with the state police
[1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:53.640]  in tennessee the military is running checkpoints with homeland security regular army
[1:47:53.640 --> 1:47:57.640]  this is really happening and they're totally converting
[1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:01.640]  our society from a free society to a police state with us until
[1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:05.640]  eight after when dr stanmontif joins us for the rest of this segment the next two
[1:48:05.640 --> 1:48:09.640]  is luca and bridgett will just use their first names from mojave

[1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:31.640]  uh were you just driving along
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:35.640]  and saw this or did you hear about this or we were we were just doing
[1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:39.640]  our little drive to the post office and we were just
[1:48:39.640 --> 1:48:43.640]  doing our daily route there and we were driving through they were having a hot rod
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:47.640]  car show that they happen to have every year and we're just driving down and
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:51.640]  you divine and you know if it wasn't for our
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:55.640]  keen senses from the past few years from your show i don't even know i would have
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:59.640]  ever paid attention but here were national guard guys you know
[1:48:59.640 --> 1:49:03.640]  on the on the street in their uniform waving the flags
[1:49:03.640 --> 1:49:07.640]  and we just said my god it's really even happening here
[1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:11.640]  yeah they had traffic directing flags yes
[1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:15.640]  so we just we flipped the ui as it shows in our video
[1:49:15.640 --> 1:49:19.640]  we had our trusty little pen and i'm sorry it didn't come out so good
[1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:23.640]  but we were just it was just fast and we just well i think it's pretty good
[1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:27.640]  video no it's great good well we and we flipped around and
[1:49:27.640 --> 1:49:31.640]  we just asked the question that you saw on the video you know what were they
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:35.640]  doing here and they just say oh we're just
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:39.640]  helping and then notice all the way over in Kentucky it's traffic control
[1:49:39.640 --> 1:49:43.640]  checkpoints but then they say we do assist officers if they need help
[1:49:43.640 --> 1:49:47.640]  arresting somebody exactly exactly we just heard that
[1:49:47.640 --> 1:49:51.640]  and the interesting thing also after we came back we left because we were
[1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:55.640]  still in the car we couldn't hold up traffic so we parked and we walked
[1:49:55.640 --> 1:49:59.640]  back about 20 minutes later and the part that isn't on the
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:03.640]  clip we had spoken to the regular traffic
[1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:07.640]  guy and and boy he gave us we were laughing he gave us
[1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:11.640]  the regular line that you always give about don't you know
[1:50:11.640 --> 1:50:15.640]  the truth boy i mean he started going into that he got very
[1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:19.640]  you left the troops you let them search your car america's about
[1:50:19.640 --> 1:50:23.640]  checkpoints and troops on street corners you're some kind of comic
[1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:27.640]  you don't want to turn your gun in yes he got very ugly with us and
[1:50:27.640 --> 1:50:31.640]  i asked him about posse comitatus and he just he said well
[1:50:31.640 --> 1:50:35.640]  that i said it was illegal what they were doing according to posse comitatus
[1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:39.640]  and he said well that's your opinion that's your opinion
[1:50:39.640 --> 1:50:43.640]  we run this nation now every country in history falls to their

[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:19.640]  and start documenting this because it's coming in from all over the country
[1:55:19.640 --> 1:55:23.640]  and Europe and England and Canada Canada's announced they're going to have
[1:55:23.640 --> 1:55:27.640]  regular army patrolling the streets this is a takeover
[1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:31.640]  Alex yes I would like to say something I
[1:55:31.640 --> 1:55:35.640]  have other video that I'm applauding uh very disturbing never happened before
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:39.640]  one is on the youtube channel that we have uh bottom line uh
[1:55:39.640 --> 1:55:43.640]  for the first time on the valley where we live and we live in Mojave County in between
[1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:47.640]  Bullhead and uh like excuse me Bullhead and Kingman
[1:55:47.640 --> 1:55:51.640]  there were a few days ago uh military choppers flying low altitude
[1:55:51.640 --> 1:55:55.640]  they'll normally they fly by this time they were
[1:55:55.640 --> 1:55:59.640]  circling the valley for 20 minutes and they were called by our
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:03.640]  Apache but you people they have NLE09 focused on
[1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:07.640]  several states but mainly Arizona troops from 14 different
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:11.640]  nations to quote fight American terrorists foreign troops
[1:56:11.640 --> 1:56:15.640]  yes I believe so there is another video very disturbing of
[1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:19.640]  60 seconds that I took with the bigger pen and the quality is much better it was done
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:23.640]  almost three weeks ago and bottom line at the gas station in Kingman
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:27.640]  there was a huge armored vehicle that with NLE09 I went
[1:56:27.640 --> 1:56:31.640]  around and I was looking for some sort of a flag there were no flag
[1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:35.640]  and uh I was quite shocked with 8.30 in the morning and now all
[1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:39.640]  these start to connect the dots and I start to think we have some sort of hot spot around here
[1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:43.640]  I think we are a hot spot and Alex
[1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:47.640]  just like you said if people must realize
[1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:51.640]  this you were just saying the acclimation operation I mean how much
[1:56:51.640 --> 1:56:55.640]  more obvious does it have to get you know when it hits your own town
[1:56:55.640 --> 1:56:59.640]  when you see the you know the National Guard reinforcing the local police department
[1:56:59.640 --> 1:57:03.640]  and if you ask a question we were treated like
[1:57:03.640 --> 1:57:07.640]  you know they were going to arrest us or that we were from you know
[1:57:07.640 --> 1:57:11.640]  domestic terrorists I mean we were treated just terribly and
[1:57:11.640 --> 1:57:15.640]  just to let you know too we just right before we got on the show today I just
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:19.640]  I told Paul I just called the National Guard I got the number I called the National Guard
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:23.640]  we listened to the audio you're clear they're kind of
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:27.640]  garbled but we can bear so we're not going to air it but we will link it up
[1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:31.640]  in a story we're going to give it to Paul Watson to put in the overall article
[1:57:31.640 --> 1:57:35.640]  okay what a shame because I was clear but this lady was
[1:57:35.640 --> 1:57:39.640]  so irritated with me for calling and asking a question
[1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:43.640]  she was so and she ended up hanging up on me because
[1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:47.640]  she didn't want to talk about Pasi Kamatata she just didn't want to talk to me
[1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:51.640]  well slaves aren't allowed to
[1:57:51.640 --> 1:57:55.640]  ask questions in America exactly and and how dare you
[1:57:55.640 --> 1:57:59.640]  but you watch all these troop videos from around the country a lot of places they're searching bags
[1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:03.640]  searching cars they sit there on the street
[1:58:03.640 --> 1:58:07.640]  when foreigners' families walk by going like it's Cobra's slithering
[1:58:07.640 --> 1:58:11.640]  by they're just like terrorists I'm looking it's like it's like being in an airport
[1:58:11.640 --> 1:58:15.640]  with just the troops just looking at you like you're about to attack them
[1:58:15.640 --> 1:58:19.640]  and they admit nor come admits this is the occupation
[1:58:19.640 --> 1:58:23.640]  of the United States just locally they're going to soft soap it white wash
[1:58:23.640 --> 1:58:27.640]  it everything's fine we're just here helping your police let us search
[1:58:27.640 --> 1:58:31.640]  your car let us take your blood let us do a breathalyzer

[1:59:55.640 --> 1:59:59.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[2:00:05.640 --> 2:00:09.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups

[2:00:17.640 --> 2:00:21.640]  and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[2:00:21.640 --> 2:00:25.640]  Final segment with our guest
[2:00:25.640 --> 2:00:29.640]  the great folks from the Mojave County Minutemen and Mojave County
[2:00:29.640 --> 2:00:33.640]  Oath Keepers
[2:00:33.640 --> 2:00:37.640]  This is just like an army massing on your border in 1939 the Germans began to mass on the Polish
[2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:41.640]  border the Poles said why are you going to attack us? Hitler said I'm not going to attack
[2:00:41.640 --> 2:00:45.640]  then Hitler staged a terror attack against his own military base on the Polish border
[2:00:45.640 --> 2:00:49.640]  Gliwitz blamed it on the Poles and invaded that's now declassified
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:53.640]  by the public
[2:00:53.640 --> 2:00:57.640]  and just all these years secret military operations paying off county commissioners paying off mayors
[2:00:57.640 --> 2:01:01.640]  the army coming with satchels in some cases up to a million bucks buying off mayors
[2:01:01.640 --> 2:01:05.640]  and I went why would the army be doing that and I found out they'd done that in third world
[2:01:05.640 --> 2:01:09.640]  countries mainly Latin America and Middle East and Africa before
[2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:13.640]  they would overall take them over
[2:01:13.640 --> 2:01:17.640]  and so I just and then I talked to military people got declassified documents talked to congressmen
[2:01:17.640 --> 2:01:21.640]  officers retired judge advocate generals agreeing with me that this
[2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:25.640]  was preparation for martial law and now suddenly troops all over
[2:01:25.640 --> 2:01:29.640]  open announcements we were right it's totally criminal
[2:01:29.640 --> 2:01:33.640]  but they're going to do acclimation drills that look reasonable over helping search
[2:01:33.640 --> 2:01:37.640]  people going in the football stadium over helping with the Kentucky Derby over helping on
[2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:41.640]  the subways over helping in your small town all the army is
[2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:45.640]  helping the local police over helping the local high school over helping
[2:01:45.640 --> 2:01:49.640]  the local charity and the local green
[2:01:49.640 --> 2:01:53.640]  assessment group in Austin that's going to control the
[2:01:53.640 --> 2:01:57.640]  carbon system it's a former black ops commander from the army
[2:01:57.640 --> 2:02:01.640]  runs Austin and he said this is our mission in Austin
[2:02:01.640 --> 2:02:05.640]  I mean they're everywhere they are taking over America
[2:02:05.640 --> 2:02:09.640]  and the higher ups know what they're doing the low levels don't
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:13.640]  in closing comments Luca and Bridget okay
[2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:17.640]  one thing first of all I have no problem to say my first and last name
[2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:21.640]  all I wanted to spell it out right my name is Luca Zanna
[2:02:21.640 --> 2:02:25.640]  Z as Zibra is America and as Nancy Nancy America because
[2:02:25.640 --> 2:02:29.640]  the best thing we can do here let them know that we are not afraid
[2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:33.640]  okay we are not afraid we're going to expose them because if we feel like
[2:02:33.640 --> 2:02:37.640]  we're going to they think that the way afraid is like a dog in you can do but that's going
[2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:41.640]  to go for the trot we're going to go all the way and so much that we're going to make
[2:02:41.640 --> 2:02:45.640]  more reports and we need to try to inform everybody sheriff
[2:02:45.640 --> 2:02:49.640]  of the county we already spoke yesterday with the sheriff I'm going tomorrow to speak
[2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:53.640]  with the mayor we need to be on the public online or
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:57.640]  what did the sheriff say to you Luca well the sheriff is a nice man
[2:02:57.640 --> 2:03:01.640]  I must admit that he's a good guy we have a good report but now he's know what it
[2:03:01.640 --> 2:03:05.640]  says is what he's going to do because you know he said pretty much he agrees with me
[2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:09.640]  I asked him about if there's anything missing part about the exception
[2:03:09.640 --> 2:03:13.640]  in the post to commit that is why the National Guard could be you could be used
[2:03:13.640 --> 2:03:17.640]  we have to point out just like they use Marines at the mass shooting in Alabama
[2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:21.640]  we have to point out that this is wrong or they'll set the precedent it's right
[2:03:21.640 --> 2:03:25.640]  and I agree with you we got to go to city councils everywhere preemptively
[2:03:25.640 --> 2:03:29.640]  because notice all these mayors are saying they want martial law
[2:03:29.640 --> 2:03:33.640]  Arkansas, New York it's happening I ask a favor to all the info warriors
[2:03:33.640 --> 2:03:37.640]  this is the tomorrow we need to help each other and we need to call
[2:03:37.640 --> 2:03:41.640]  the National Guard office here because they ain't got on us and that's no right
[2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:45.640]  can I give the number because it's just shocking how I was
[2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:49.640]  treated can I give that number out yes give their number and say you may be ignorant
[2:03:49.640 --> 2:03:53.640]  and not know you're engaged in treason and an acclamation operation
[2:03:53.640 --> 2:03:57.640]  but be polite but say we are going to stand for the republic yes give out
[2:03:57.640 --> 2:04:01.640]  exactly because that's exactly what was going on the number is
[2:04:01.640 --> 2:04:05.640]  928-773-3161
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:09.640]  give it again 928-773-3161
[2:04:09.640 --> 2:04:13.640]  that's the Kingman, Arizona National Guard
[2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:17.640]  and folks should call Camp Mayberry I know they're involved in all sorts of black
[2:04:17.640 --> 2:04:21.640]  ops here in town I've got that confirmed and let them know
[2:04:21.640 --> 2:04:25.640]  we know what they're doing we're not stupid exactly and you know what Alex
[2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:29.640]  one last thing that is so important we were I hate to say
[2:04:29.640 --> 2:04:33.640]  this but we were kind of stupid until about four years ago until we found
[2:04:33.640 --> 2:04:37.640]  you and I know everybody says this but you kind of saved our lives
[2:04:37.640 --> 2:04:41.640]  we completely changed our lives in the last four years
[2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:45.640]  and these people like the woman who answers the phone at the National Guard
[2:04:45.640 --> 2:04:49.640]  she was shocked to hear a citizen calling and using the words

[2:07:03.640 --> 2:07:07.640]  if you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[2:07:07.640 --> 2:07:11.640]  how much ammunition do you want my answer would be all I can get
[2:07:11.640 --> 2:07:15.640]  in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones food is your only ammunition
[2:07:15.640 --> 2:07:19.640]  how much do you want when do you want it now or after
[2:07:19.640 --> 2:07:23.640]  the battle starts when will you need it can you buy it without proper identification
[2:07:23.640 --> 2:07:27.640]  will there be any food will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine
[2:07:27.640 --> 2:07:31.640]  and you can't feed yourself will you go to the gathering center and be immunized
[2:07:31.640 --> 2:07:35.640]  you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply
[2:07:35.640 --> 2:07:39.640]  food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life
[2:07:39.640 --> 2:07:43.640]  how much will you need we don't know how much do you want all you can get
[2:07:43.640 --> 2:07:47.640]  I'm Alex Jones I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day
[2:07:47.640 --> 2:07:51.640]  call 1-800-409-5633
[2:07:51.640 --> 2:07:55.640]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com
[2:07:55.640 --> 2:07:59.640]  again that number 1-800-409-5633
[2:08:09.640 --> 2:08:13.640]  I was just listening to the ad that ran
[2:08:13.640 --> 2:08:17.640]  it's a local so a lot of stations probably didn't hear it but it's the eFoods Direct ad
[2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:21.640]  that I cut a year and a half ago and I said
[2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:25.640]  will you have storable foods or will you be forced to go to the
[2:08:25.640 --> 2:08:29.640]  inoculation centers now how did I make an ad
[2:08:29.640 --> 2:08:33.640]  a year and a half ago saying they would be trying to forcibly inoculate you
[2:08:33.640 --> 2:08:37.640]  with inoculation centers now being announced now as they ease it out
[2:08:37.640 --> 2:08:41.640]  there because we got the secret FEMA training manual
[2:08:41.640 --> 2:08:45.640]  three years ago a year and a half before it was declassified
[2:08:45.640 --> 2:08:49.640]  of the tens of thousands of clergy being secretly hired by FEMA
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:53.640]  and the training manual said tell them it's of God to turn your guns in
[2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:57.640]  it's of God to go to the FEMA camp and be inoculated to submit
[2:08:57.640 --> 2:09:01.640]  it's of God to do all of this
[2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:05.640]  and so we then knew that was one of their main battle plans
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:09.640]  then in January we saw them telling local police get ready for martial law
[2:09:09.640 --> 2:09:13.640]  training that's why we knew in January rolled into April
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:17.640]  and then it came out we knew it was level six three months before it became mainstream news
[2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:21.640]  and we've warned so many people about what's happening
[2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:25.640]  that it's going to be hard for the globalists to carry this out
[2:09:25.640 --> 2:09:29.640]  we're going to go to Dr. Stan Monteef in one moment but finishing up with Luca and Bridget
[2:09:29.640 --> 2:09:33.640]  from Mojave County Minutemen and Mojave County Oathkeepers
[2:09:33.640 --> 2:09:37.640]  final comments from both of you
[2:09:37.640 --> 2:09:41.640]  we need to be proactive as you know as you say
[2:09:41.640 --> 2:09:45.640]  information is the first weapon and then we need also start to make this information active in the community
[2:09:45.640 --> 2:09:49.640]  otherwise if we keep it for ourselves it's not the only thing
[2:09:49.640 --> 2:09:53.640]  one important thing we're doing this Saturday and Sunday and this is part of the knowledge we must know
[2:09:53.640 --> 2:09:57.640]  we have apple seed coming in chemo
[2:09:57.640 --> 2:10:01.640]  it's free class of a clinic how to become a rifleman
[2:10:01.640 --> 2:10:05.640]  for women and for teenagers till 21
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:09.640]  please come we post the information on mojaveminutemen.com
[2:10:09.640 --> 2:10:13.640]  because this is not the way we're going to somehow prepare for what's coming
[2:10:13.640 --> 2:10:17.640]  we need to know the information but also we need to know the skills that our founder's father
[2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:21.640]  has and pray for the pray for the best but
[2:10:21.640 --> 2:10:25.640]  hope for the best prepare for the worst exactly exactly and just
[2:10:25.640 --> 2:10:29.640]  what for me is just like Luca said I'm going to do
[2:10:29.640 --> 2:10:33.640]  apple seed you know we're aware we open our mouths we ask
[2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:37.640]  questions we're not afraid we learn to shoot we don't shut up we're learning
[2:10:37.640 --> 2:10:41.640]  everything we can we're spreading the word and if the new world order thinks
[2:10:41.640 --> 2:10:45.640]  that they're going to be able to take us over without a fight
[2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:49.640]  I think they miscalculated that there's too many people just like us
[2:10:49.640 --> 2:10:53.640]  from coast to coast they're going to have a big fat fight on their hands if they want to
[2:10:53.640 --> 2:10:57.640]  well they're going to stage events though they're going to kill their own troops and blame it on us they're going to bomb federal
[2:10:57.640 --> 2:11:01.640]  buildings and blame it on us we're going into a very dark time but remember
[2:11:01.640 --> 2:11:05.640]  we know they did it just like Hitler with Gliwitz and Reichstag we know
[2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:09.640]  they're staging the events we know they've released the flu we know they're staging
[2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:13.640]  all of this this is only another big drill in my opinion god bless
[2:11:13.640 --> 2:11:17.640]  you we'll continue to check in with you as things develop take care of yourselves
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:21.640]  we love you alex we love you alex we love you taking action as well and folks
[2:11:21.640 --> 2:11:25.640]  go to city councils go to county commissioners I remember
[2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:29.640]  in 1999
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:33.640]  the SWAT team came in and threatened me at a county commissioners meeting not to speak
[2:11:33.640 --> 2:11:37.640]  it was on video on TV I said I'm going to speak
[2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:41.640]  then after the SWAT team commander it was in the same county commissioner building
[2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:45.640]  asked me was actually across the street he said please come to my office and he said look I'm a
[2:11:45.640 --> 2:11:49.640]  Vietnam vet there's not going to be troops in Austin there's no martial law coming
[2:11:49.640 --> 2:11:53.640]  he said I would never allow that Lieutenant Beck
[2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:57.640]  they later got mad at him and ran him out because he said things like this and I said listen
[2:11:57.640 --> 2:12:01.640]  to me they're paying off police chiefs and I gave him videos of it police chiefs
[2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:05.640]  I interviewed they tried to pay off San Antonio police chief and I said
[2:12:05.640 --> 2:12:09.640]  Delta Force will visit you they're visiting all the major cities now
[2:12:09.640 --> 2:12:13.640]  Austin was about 700,000 people then I said they're going to come to you soon
[2:12:13.640 --> 2:12:17.640]  he laughed at me a couple months later he calls up and says can you
[2:12:17.640 --> 2:12:21.640]  come to my office he goes here's Delta Force's card he said everything you said is
[2:12:21.640 --> 2:12:25.640]  true tell me more and then he said how do you know all this
[2:12:25.640 --> 2:12:29.640]  being so young so I was like 24 or something
[2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:33.640]  I don't remember how old I was yeah about 24 25 I looked really young and he
[2:12:33.640 --> 2:12:37.640]  said who are you with are you with the government is this a thing in the government fighting
[2:12:37.640 --> 2:12:41.640]  each other and I said no I'm with the American people
[2:12:41.640 --> 2:12:45.640]  I mean they just can't believe that citizens would be involved and informed
[2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:49.640]  in running counterintelligence against this global corporate takeover
[2:12:49.640 --> 2:12:53.640]  look somebody's got to do it I never claimed to have all the answers or be the best
[2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:57.640]  at this we're just a ragtag group going toe to toe with the
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:13:01.640]  new world order and their psyops but if you just start understanding
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:05.640]  everything they say is the opposite everything they say is a lie or a distortion
[2:13:05.640 --> 2:13:09.640]  I've got mainstream news we're going to cover with Dr. Monteef
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:13.640]  admitting that they chose a plastic of thousands of plastic formulas
[2:13:13.640 --> 2:13:17.640]  for worldwide adoption in the 60s that sterilizes
[2:13:17.640 --> 2:13:21.640]  the man the White House science are
[2:13:21.640 --> 2:13:25.640]  putting the stuff in the water that they want I mean folks
[2:13:25.640 --> 2:13:29.640]  the military and the police I'm not your enemy I don't have some macho
[2:13:29.640 --> 2:13:33.640]  head up thing of fantasy of having war with you
[2:13:33.640 --> 2:13:37.640]  I don't I hate what you do though I hate your ignorance I hate
[2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:41.640]  your denial I just wish you research
[2:13:41.640 --> 2:13:45.640]  this is important this is real
[2:13:45.640 --> 2:13:49.640]  let's go to Dr. Stan Monteef
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:53.640]  he's led a delegation of physicians from Santa Cruz County to the House of Delegates
[2:13:53.640 --> 2:13:57.640]  of California Medical Association for 10 years he's led the battle with an organized medicine
[2:13:57.640 --> 2:14:01.640]  in California to address AIDS epidemic this is an old bio and was
[2:14:01.640 --> 2:14:05.640]  talk show host on Genesis written a bunch of bestselling books made videos
[2:14:05.640 --> 2:14:09.640]  made films he's a medical doctor been doing this for over 40 years
[2:14:09.640 --> 2:14:13.640]  fighting the new world order an expert on the eugenics an expert on
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:17.640]  AIDS being engineered and an expert on what's happening with this flu
[2:14:17.640 --> 2:14:21.640]  for the balance of the hour Dr. Stan Monteef joins us doctor it's good to have you on
[2:14:21.640 --> 2:14:25.640]  with us it's great to be with you Alex and this is an exciting time
[2:14:25.640 --> 2:14:29.640]  because you know I'm getting all sorts of emails from people in
[2:14:29.640 --> 2:14:33.640]  the health care industry who's saying look they're threatening to take away my job
[2:14:33.640 --> 2:14:37.640]  they're threatening to take away my pension if I won't take this
[2:14:37.640 --> 2:14:41.640]  vaccine and I say do not take it just tell them you're gonna sue them
[2:14:41.640 --> 2:14:47.640]  if the other people
[2:14:47.640 --> 2:14:51.640]  all right we just lost his phone line yes
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:55.640]  they've denied the last month they're ordering people to take shots and it's forced
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:59.640]  now they're having to admit it slowly but again they deny it to the last minute
[2:14:59.640 --> 2:15:03.640]  so we can't build opposition if an army's about to attack
[2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:07.640]  you they want to sneak up they don't want you to know they're coming
[2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:11.640]  and this is what they're doing
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:15.640]  and while we're getting Dr. Monteef back on the line
[2:15:15.640 --> 2:15:19.640]  MAAC organizes Pittsburgh
[2:15:19.640 --> 2:15:23.640]  security for G20 it says the FBI and Secret Service are running it along with the army
[2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:27.640]  now we saw this in 99 in Seattle when I knew the army
[2:15:27.640 --> 2:15:31.640]  was running this two weeks before I said they're gonna stage riots and then it came out
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:35.640]  the police had to admit later 50 anarchists were flown in funded
[2:15:35.640 --> 2:15:39.640]  by a big foundation this is all in my film police state to the takeover
[2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:43.640]  they were released in 2000
[2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:47.640]  you want to see the documentation and they flew them in
[2:15:47.640 --> 2:15:51.640]  and they had them attack police before the news
[2:15:51.640 --> 2:15:55.640]  cameras to then set the pretext to attack everybody
[2:15:55.640 --> 2:15:59.640]  Delta Force ran that as well that was in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:03.640]  Seattle Times it was in all three of the papers in Seattle
[2:16:03.640 --> 2:16:07.640]  Seattle Times Post-Intelligencer and the other one that's all in
[2:16:07.640 --> 2:16:11.640]  police state to the takeover
[2:16:11.640 --> 2:16:15.640]  this is the takeover and they know incremental is hard to beat
[2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:19.640]  it's like a frog in cold water he won't jump out he turned it up
[2:16:19.640 --> 2:16:23.640]  slowly he'll boil to death he throw him in hot water he'll jump out
[2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:27.640]  that old analogy and the troops are brainwashed the police are brainwashed the public's brainwashed
[2:16:27.640 --> 2:16:31.640]  and I told you over a decade ago the big takeover
[2:16:31.640 --> 2:16:35.640]  would come when they fully bankrupted the economy Dr. Monteef we lost
[2:16:35.640 --> 2:16:39.640]  you there and your phone's real low can you speak up okay how is that
[2:16:39.640 --> 2:16:43.640]  good start over you're saying an exciting time to be alive well it certainly is
[2:16:43.640 --> 2:16:47.640]  but you know really with this whole thing on this wine
[2:16:47.640 --> 2:16:51.640]  flu everybody or most people have missed this article
[2:16:51.640 --> 2:16:55.640]  that appeared in the New York Times on the 12th of September
[2:16:55.640 --> 2:16:59.640]  and they quote a number of leading epidemiologists who
[2:16:59.640 --> 2:17:03.640]  have said that you know that they got a great vaccine but the problem
[2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:07.640]  is the epidemic's going to be over it's kind of a peeked out
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:11.640]  before the vaccines available in the middle of next month
[2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:15.640]  and that really is true in fact I emailed
[2:17:15.640 --> 2:17:19.640]  or just talked to Mr. Hartman and hopefully he'll have those
[2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:23.640]  figures off the CDC webpage so you can see that it's
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:27.640]  already peaked at its highest level they call it widespread
[2:17:27.640 --> 2:17:31.640]  level five in almost 20 states as of about
[2:17:31.640 --> 2:17:35.640]  two weeks ago it's already peaked and declining
[2:17:35.640 --> 2:17:39.640]  the incidence of the new infections in California this disease
[2:17:39.640 --> 2:17:43.640]  is so mild that most people who get it don't even know they've been ill
[2:17:43.640 --> 2:17:47.640]  and what they've done is the bait and switch on the vaccine
[2:17:47.640 --> 2:17:51.640]  the article that they utilized to demonstrate
[2:17:51.640 --> 2:17:55.640]  that the vaccine was effective was published in the
[2:17:55.640 --> 2:17:59.640]  Journal of Medicine on the 10th of September it's called a trial of influenza
[2:17:59.640 --> 2:18:03.640]  A H1N12009 mile surveillance
[2:18:03.640 --> 2:18:07.640]  monovalence adjuvanted vaccine
[2:18:07.640 --> 2:18:11.640]  in other words they used an adjuvanted vaccine in Australia
[2:18:11.640 --> 2:18:15.640]  to prove that the vaccine works but they're not going to give an
[2:18:15.640 --> 2:18:19.640]  adjuvanted vaccine in the United States at least they're afraid to
[2:18:19.640 --> 2:18:23.640]  because they know there's so much opposition to it and because it's not licensed
[2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:27.640]  in the United States so they used one vaccine
[2:18:27.640 --> 2:18:31.640]  and said gee look how great it works and then first they're going to use a different
[2:18:31.640 --> 2:18:35.640]  vaccine in the United States well doctor I want to walk through all this with you
[2:18:35.640 --> 2:18:39.640]  but also from your years of researching this eugenics order of darkness
[2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:43.640]  brotherhood of darkness as your book title states it
[2:18:43.640 --> 2:18:47.640]  what do you think the master plan here is this just a giant drill for federalization
[2:18:47.640 --> 2:18:51.640]  and nation states to go under UN level six control
[2:18:51.640 --> 2:18:55.640]  it could this be something better it may be a trial it may be
[2:18:55.640 --> 2:18:59.640]  an effort to make 40 billion dollars for the pharmaceutical industry
[2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:03.640]  I certainly they're going to do tremendous damage to our a large segment of our
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:07.640]  population because the CDC is
[2:19:07.640 --> 2:19:11.640]  mandating that this vaccine or at least I suggest
[2:19:11.640 --> 2:19:15.640]  the vaccine be given to every pregnant woman or as if you read the material
[2:19:15.640 --> 2:19:19.640]  from the manufacturers of the vaccine here in the United States and throughout
[2:19:19.640 --> 2:19:23.640]  the world they say don't give it to pregnant women
[2:19:23.640 --> 2:19:27.640]  the CDC is saying it ought to be given to all children starting at two years of age
[2:19:27.640 --> 2:19:31.640]  the manufacturers are saying don't give it to children less than four years of age
[2:19:31.640 --> 2:19:35.640]  they get into all sorts of problems with it and they don't want to give but
[2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:39.640]  one shot of the vaccine they want to give two shots of the swine blue
[2:19:39.640 --> 2:19:43.640]  vaccine and two shots of the influenza vaccine
[2:19:43.640 --> 2:19:47.640]  so that these don't break away well stay there you're a medical doctor
[2:19:47.640 --> 2:19:51.640]  expert on eugenics I want to get into their larger master plan as well
[2:19:51.640 --> 2:19:55.640]  and take phone calls Dr. Stan Montief of Radio Liberty his ministry

[2:21:11.640 --> 2:21:15.640]  doing a great job that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like
[2:21:15.640 --> 2:21:19.640]  bailout candy that social security would be there for you that's not what's
[2:21:19.640 --> 2:21:23.640]  happening you might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel
[2:21:23.640 --> 2:21:27.640]  inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be
[2:21:27.640 --> 2:21:31.640]  secure if all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold

[2:22:03.640 --> 2:22:07.640]  of American history a terrorist act of war against this country
[2:22:07.640 --> 2:22:11.640]  the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy
[2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:13.640]  bin Laden this is his MO
[2:22:13.640 --> 2:22:17.640]  we have to look to the Middle East we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[2:22:17.640 --> 2:22:21.640]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to

[2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:29.640]  believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and
[2:22:29.640 --> 2:22:33.640]  on the US I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[2:22:33.640 --> 2:22:37.640]  have been detained and Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers
[2:22:37.640 --> 2:22:41.640]  ties to the FBI the Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli intelligence

[2:23:53.640 --> 2:24:05.640]  we are going to take some of your phone calls on the swine flu your questions
[2:24:05.640 --> 2:24:09.640]  your comments when we open the phones up doctor unlimited amounts as many as we
[2:24:09.640 --> 2:24:13.640]  can take nurses and husbands and wives of nurses being ordered to take another
[2:24:13.640 --> 2:24:13.640]  fired nurses who have been denied their rights to the
[2:24:13.640 --> 2:24:27.640]  law they are using regulations and Obama is lying saying they are not trying to make
[2:24:27.640 --> 2:24:31.640]  this mandatory open discussions on CNN and Fox about using the military to
[2:24:31.640 --> 2:24:29.640]  forcibly inoculate on the
[2:24:29.640 --> 2:24:45.640]  CDC center for disease control map will put that up on screen they admit it's
[2:24:45.640 --> 2:24:49.640]  supposed to peak middle of next month it's basically already peaked it doesn't
[2:24:49.640 --> 2:24:53.640]  even go up much this is a very mild flu as you said so why do they want us to
[2:24:53.640 --> 2:24:59.640]  take this vaccine so bad because it contains mercury and mercury is toxic
[2:24:59.640 --> 2:25:03.640]  it destroys the fertility it controls destroys the mind destroys the the
[2:25:03.640 --> 2:25:09.640]  endocrine system if there is no safe dose of mercury and yet they're going to
[2:25:09.640 --> 2:25:13.640]  give it they want everybody to take a swine flu shot with a full dose of
[2:25:13.640 --> 2:25:17.640]  mercury a regular flu shot with the regular dose of mercury they want to
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:23.640]  every pregnant woman to take up these shots they want to give two shots of
[2:25:23.640 --> 2:25:29.640]  swine flu and two shots of the regular influenza vaccine to every child less
[2:25:29.640 --> 2:25:33.640]  than 10 years of age is this not precedent setting where they're ordering
[2:25:33.640 --> 2:25:37.640]  medical workers to take the standard flu shot oh it absolutely as well I don't
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:41.640]  know about the standard flu shot they've always recommended no they're ordering
[2:25:41.640 --> 2:25:47.640]  that I've got the letters I've got the letters from major hospital chains they
[2:25:47.640 --> 2:25:52.640]  are firing people they don't take it well basically of course this is going to
[2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:57.640]  produce terrible damage first of all because it does contain the mercury a
[2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:01.640]  lot of people never have gotten the flu until they take a flu shot they've
[2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:06.640]  been recommending for years that medical personnel take the seasonal flu now that
[2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:11.640]  that's not the eighth one and one it's the seasonal and most people won't take it
[2:26:11.640 --> 2:26:15.640]  because they know it makes them sick and it doesn't do any good as a vast
[2:26:15.640 --> 2:26:20.640]  majority of doctors in this country do not believe in the influenza that the
[2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:24.640]  regular and that's a national polls and everybody mouth to mouth person to
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:29.640]  person knows that I took the flu shot and almost died I mean my mother that
[2:26:29.640 --> 2:26:33.640]  happened to her everybody I know has their heart broken and they're
[2:26:33.640 --> 2:26:37.640]  mother that happened to her everybody I know has their horrible flu shot story
[2:26:37.640 --> 2:26:42.640]  and of course they this promote skin we have great disease it produces all
[2:26:42.640 --> 2:26:47.640]  sorts of medical problems and they said they have been trying to sell it to the
[2:26:47.640 --> 2:26:52.640]  American people and yet so many people have been crippled or have permanent
[2:26:52.640 --> 2:26:57.640]  damage their immunity you have to understand that the whole idea vaccines
[2:26:57.640 --> 2:27:02.640]  is to stimulate the immune system and this is one reason why we have so much
[2:27:02.640 --> 2:27:07.640]  autoimmune disease in America we talked about rheumatoid arthritis lupus
[2:27:07.640 --> 2:27:12.640]  shortened disease of certain types of thyroiditis chronic bowel symptoms it's
[2:27:12.640 --> 2:27:18.640]  because they've overstimulated the immune eczema absolutely and so and then
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:23.640]  of course what you have to understand we can start with simply an alphabetical
[2:27:23.640 --> 2:27:29.640]  approach to this a that you get off you get asthma and you get allergies you get
[2:27:29.640 --> 2:27:35.640]  autoimmune disease you realize that in the United States today one in nine
[2:27:35.640 --> 2:27:41.640]  children has asthma that you don't see this in the Amas children because they
[2:27:41.640 --> 2:27:45.640]  aren't required to take the vaccines or they just refuse to take the vaccine
[2:27:45.640 --> 2:27:49.640]  there's been an explosion of autoimmune disease there's an explosion of
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:55.640]  excellent asthma as you point out and then of course the mercury in the
[2:27:55.640 --> 2:28:01.640]  vaccine attacks the brain this is why today in the United States one in six
[2:28:01.640 --> 2:28:07.640]  children according to the CDC their own figures one in six children has a
[2:28:07.640 --> 2:28:13.640]  either a learning disability or a neurodevelopmental abnormality one in
[2:28:13.640 --> 2:28:18.640]  six American children you don't see this in children who don't take the vaccines
[2:28:18.640 --> 2:28:23.640]  they're destroying the minds and lives of our children which is what the top
[2:28:23.640 --> 2:28:30.640]  eugenicists like H.C. Wells and Bertrand Russell and John V. Holdren said
[2:28:30.640 --> 2:28:36.640]  they would do absolutely in fact if you read and we have the book people can
[2:28:36.640 --> 2:28:41.640]  get it it's called the impact of science on society written by Bertrand Russell
[2:28:41.640 --> 2:28:49.640]  and he comments there by in by in by died injections and injunctions we will
[2:28:49.640 --> 2:28:54.640]  alter of the mind of the child that they will not be able to differ from the
[2:28:54.640 --> 2:28:59.640]  things that they were taught by the school master by diet injections and
[2:28:59.640 --> 2:29:04.640]  injunctions what are they going to put in the diet or why they put aspartame
[2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:09.640]  in the diet that has impact on the mind but we could talk for hours on that
[2:29:09.640 --> 2:29:14.640]  but it's just cancer but then they put Chris the the mercury that they're
[2:29:14.640 --> 2:29:19.640]  giving our kids in the injection they know that this destroys the mind this
[2:29:19.640 --> 2:29:24.640]  you realize that today in America we have five million people with dementia
[2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:29.640]  and Alzheimer's disease in all of China with four times our population they
[2:29:29.640 --> 2:29:33.640]  only got a little over five and a half million people and it gets worse than
[2:29:33.640 --> 2:29:38.640]  that stay there doctor long segment coming up it gets worse than that our
[2:29:38.640 --> 2:29:42.640]  diabetes level everything we're gonna talk about that with medical doctor
[2:29:42.640 --> 2:29:47.640]  doctor Stan Monty on the other side stay with us

[2:33:53.640 --> 2:33:58.640]  I mean you mentioned Alzheimer's they now have this early onset of it when you're 35-40 years old
[2:33:58.640 --> 2:34:02.640]  you mentioned that we have more brain disorders than people in China
[2:34:02.640 --> 2:34:04.640]  more Alzheimer's
[2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:07.640]  I mean they're killing us we know it's designed they stated they would do it
[2:34:07.640 --> 2:34:11.640]  they write giant textbooks on it like eco science bragging about it
[2:34:11.640 --> 2:34:16.640]  and how do we defeat this
[2:34:16.640 --> 2:34:20.640]  they control the main churches they control the corporations
[2:34:20.640 --> 2:34:24.640]  they don't just want a world government that's the means to the end as John P. Holder
[2:34:24.640 --> 2:34:29.640]  and White House Science are says as he states a planetary government a planetary regime
[2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:33.640]  Dr. P. Anka says it Peter Singer says it they all say it
[2:34:33.640 --> 2:34:38.640]  Erlich says it George Bush senior's advisor that they're going to have a world government to carry out
[2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:42.640]  our orderly extermination testing soft kill weapons as we die
[2:34:42.640 --> 2:34:48.640]  they train as it's normal they pose as the saviors they have marches and marathons to fund research
[2:34:48.640 --> 2:34:51.640]  research which is actually funding how to kill us
[2:34:51.640 --> 2:34:54.640]  you're a medical doctor who discovered this decades ago
[2:34:54.640 --> 2:35:00.640]  it appears all the evidence shows they're expanding their eugenics operations to more of a hot kill
[2:35:00.640 --> 2:35:02.640]  fast kill now
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:06.640]  and the Reuters has got a big article out saying oh there'll be millions of deaths this year
[2:35:06.640 --> 2:35:09.640]  people will think they take the shot and die
[2:35:09.640 --> 2:35:12.640]  but no there'll be no adverse reactions it's impossible
[2:35:12.640 --> 2:35:16.640]  they're telling doctors if someone dies after they take it or becomes paralyzed
[2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:18.640]  the shot didn't do it
[2:35:18.640 --> 2:35:23.640]  it appears they're preemptively studying how to roll this out successfully
[2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:28.640]  just like Gardasil and Killen Mamus and sterilizes and then get away with it
[2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:35.640]  well I think that probably the vaccine that they're going to give in Europe will be more dangerous
[2:35:35.640 --> 2:35:39.640]  than the one that they're going to give here because the one that they're going to use in Europe is
[2:35:39.640 --> 2:35:47.640]  is a squailing one that license to give to people over 65 they're going to give it the whole population
[2:35:47.640 --> 2:35:53.640]  and then of course there's an article in global research which is usually very very very very reliable
[2:35:53.640 --> 2:35:57.640]  and they're talking about the nanoparticles that they put in there to so-called
[2:35:57.640 --> 2:36:00.640]  turbo-charged European vaccine
[2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:04.640]  now I just hope and pray that they haven't snuck it into our vaccine
[2:36:04.640 --> 2:36:06.640]  because you can't trust them
[2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:11.640]  well we've had medical workers at the vaccine companies call in and I've seen reports
[2:36:11.640 --> 2:36:17.640]  that no there's different versions but no they have the Indra-Lukin or whatever it's called
[2:36:17.640 --> 2:36:19.640]  that Dr. Horowitz on yesterday
[2:36:19.640 --> 2:36:22.640]  they're saying that it is in the vaccines or at least some of them
[2:36:22.640 --> 2:36:26.640]  it may very well baby see we can't trust them
[2:36:26.640 --> 2:36:29.640]  because they have put things into the vaccines in the past
[2:36:29.640 --> 2:36:34.640]  or they will say well we didn't know it was there well they can say that
[2:36:34.640 --> 2:36:38.640]  but when they did know it was there they continue to distribute it
[2:36:38.640 --> 2:36:43.640]  and I'm talking about specifically the polio vaccine, the original polio vaccine
[2:36:43.640 --> 2:36:46.640]  and when they found out it had a cancer virus in it
[2:36:46.640 --> 2:36:48.640]  they continued disseminating it
[2:36:48.640 --> 2:36:52.640]  but they've contaminated the whole population of the world
[2:36:52.640 --> 2:36:57.640]  about 30% of our population today still carries that cancer vaccine
[2:36:57.640 --> 2:37:01.640]  that's cancer virus that was in the original polio vaccine
[2:37:01.640 --> 2:37:05.640]  one reason why the incidence of bone cancer and brain cancer
[2:37:05.640 --> 2:37:09.640]  and lymphoma and mesothelioma and pentamoma
[2:37:09.640 --> 2:37:13.640]  and medulla blastoma in children has gone up and when they actually
[2:37:13.640 --> 2:37:18.640]  when they perhaps see them they find evidence of this cancer producing virus
[2:37:18.640 --> 2:37:23.640]  that was introduced into our population through the original polio vaccine
[2:37:23.640 --> 2:37:26.640]  and no doubt by design in German news is reporting
[2:37:26.640 --> 2:37:30.640]  that they're growing it again in the same monkeys that have the SV-40
[2:37:30.640 --> 2:37:33.640]  for the virus stock in the European vaccines
[2:37:33.640 --> 2:37:36.640]  well I've got help those people over there supposedly
[2:37:36.640 --> 2:37:39.640]  and all we know is what they tell us Alex
[2:37:39.640 --> 2:37:45.640]  supposedly the American vaccine is going to be grown in the yolk of eggs
[2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:50.640]  but then we get the chicken of viruses that's the frightening thing about this
[2:37:50.640 --> 2:37:54.640]  and they've introduced so many viruses from so many animals
[2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:59.640]  God gave us an immune system that allows us to fight off animal viruses
[2:37:59.640 --> 2:38:03.640]  we can't get to our bodies unless you inject them with a needle
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:08.640]  but what about how for five years the FDA approved it's now in wide use
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:12.640]  not just a radiation of the meat but they're now spraying in Latin
[2:38:12.640 --> 2:38:17.640]  I can't pronounce it that means bacteria eating virus
[2:38:17.640 --> 2:38:21.640]  they grow it in giant vaccine tanks with other viruses and RNA
[2:38:21.640 --> 2:38:24.640]  and are now spraying it on most meats we get at the store
[2:38:24.640 --> 2:38:29.640]  well I'm very concerned that so much of what they're doing to our food supply
[2:38:29.640 --> 2:38:32.640]  it will lead to terrible problems
[2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:37.640]  certainly we know that the genetically modified corn that they have introduced
[2:38:37.640 --> 2:38:44.640]  across America and of course it is contaminating our entire corn supply here
[2:38:44.640 --> 2:38:47.640]  chickens are a lot smarter than people chickens both eat it
[2:38:47.640 --> 2:38:52.640]  we know that it actually causes infertility and pigs
[2:38:52.640 --> 2:38:54.640]  we know that studies have been done in Russia
[2:38:54.640 --> 2:38:59.640]  that shows it causes the genetically modified corn
[2:38:59.640 --> 2:39:02.640]  actually creates infertility and animals in Russia
[2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:05.640]  and the people wanted to get the information out and were told
[2:39:05.640 --> 2:39:10.640]  you can't disseminate the information it's all about population control
[2:39:10.640 --> 2:39:16.640]  we know that the Rockefeller Foundation and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:22.640]  at Monsanto and a similar very large genetic modification company
[2:39:22.640 --> 2:39:28.640]  over in Switzerland are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to store seeds
[2:39:28.640 --> 2:39:33.640]  in vast bulk up above the Arctic Circle on a little island there
[2:39:33.640 --> 2:39:37.640]  and nobody's asked why are they storing all these seeds for corn
[2:39:37.640 --> 2:39:41.640]  and for wheat and for all the other vegetables and things
[2:39:41.640 --> 2:39:46.640]  you know in these vaults where they'll be permanently frozen and should be very obvious
[2:39:46.640 --> 2:39:50.640]  all of these people are dedicated to population control
[2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:55.640]  and they want the seeds for when they start all over again
[2:39:55.640 --> 2:40:03.640]  they've stated this in fact the MI-6 officer he was OSS who wrote the James Bond novels
[2:40:03.640 --> 2:40:07.640]  that were made into movies he wrote Moonraker
[2:40:07.640 --> 2:40:11.640]  and in that the global elite and this head banker
[2:40:11.640 --> 2:40:15.640]  want to kill everybody on earth they the eugenics pure
[2:40:15.640 --> 2:40:19.640]  go to a space station while they kill everybody on earth
[2:40:19.640 --> 2:40:23.640]  they're going to come back but in the real government documents they're not going to space
[2:40:23.640 --> 2:40:26.640]  they've got the underground bases and I saw a Reuters article two weeks ago
[2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:28.640]  in fact we can pull that up
[2:40:28.640 --> 2:40:32.640]  UN chief or UN head visit seed vault
[2:40:32.640 --> 2:40:35.640]  and it's this photo of the big armored mountain
[2:40:35.640 --> 2:40:38.640]  and the troops guarding the arc
[2:40:38.640 --> 2:40:42.640]  and then you read the transhumanist they admit
[2:40:42.640 --> 2:40:45.640]  which are the eugenicists that they do plan to kill us
[2:40:45.640 --> 2:40:50.640]  and they're putting in the police state grid to then carry out the medical mayhem and murder
[2:40:50.640 --> 2:40:53.640]  and I want the troops and military to know something
[2:40:53.640 --> 2:40:56.640]  I know this is probably going to go ahead and go to fruition
[2:40:56.640 --> 2:40:59.640]  just know you're going to be judged at your own hand
[2:40:59.640 --> 2:41:03.640]  the masters you've served for are going to murder you and your family as well
[2:41:03.640 --> 2:41:05.640]  go ahead and laugh
[2:41:05.640 --> 2:41:08.640]  just remember as you're dying with your family years from now
[2:41:08.640 --> 2:41:12.640]  you asked for it you were warned you wanted to be part of it
[2:41:12.640 --> 2:41:13.640]  Dr. Monteef
[2:41:13.640 --> 2:41:18.640]  men and women become accomplices to the evil they failed to oppose
[2:41:18.640 --> 2:41:23.640]  and the people within the military who are carrying out the orders of our leaders
[2:41:23.640 --> 2:41:27.640]  who have killed I don't know if you'll have read the article by the shoe drawer
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:30.640]  of the man of course who the shoe is in George Bush
[2:41:30.640 --> 2:41:34.640]  he talked about the million Iraqis who were killed
[2:41:34.640 --> 2:41:37.640]  he talked about the million widows there
[2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:41.640]  he talked about the five million orphans in Iraq today
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:44.640]  he talked about the suffering there are the people
[2:41:44.640 --> 2:41:48.640]  how they've turned the Arabs against one another
[2:41:48.640 --> 2:41:52.640]  one time the students of the shoes the Christians got along well together
[2:41:52.640 --> 2:41:57.640]  but since the American came in the Christians have been driven out and the Christians
[2:41:57.640 --> 2:42:02.640]  everybody is everybody else's throat and we are sending in Asian provocateurs
[2:42:02.640 --> 2:42:06.640]  to commit acts of terrorism to maintain this division
[2:42:06.640 --> 2:42:13.640]  but this is all because the American people haven't had the courage to stand up
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:15.640]  oh they voted for Barack Obama
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:18.640]  who is of course expanding the war in Afghanistan today
[2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:21.640]  because he is a servant of the elite
[2:42:21.640 --> 2:42:25.640]  and we're talking about the trial of the commission that you do as well
[2:42:25.640 --> 2:42:31.640]  the council on foreign relations to Bilderberg is this financial elite led by David Rockefeller
[2:42:31.640 --> 2:42:34.640]  who has a different worldview
[2:42:34.640 --> 2:42:37.640]  because he worships a different God
[2:42:37.640 --> 2:42:41.640]  and until people understand that there is a powerful spiritual force
[2:42:41.640 --> 2:42:45.640]  a Luciferian force behind every big corner of the day
[2:42:45.640 --> 2:42:47.640]  and they really hate humanity
[2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:49.640]  and that's why they're storing the seeds
[2:42:49.640 --> 2:42:51.640]  so they will have them there
[2:42:51.640 --> 2:42:56.640]  their videos are more e-strong as you know saying we're going to destroy the entire industrial base
[2:42:56.640 --> 2:42:59.640]  through the world government I mean they're doing it now doctor
[2:42:59.640 --> 2:43:04.640]  I remember when I was first on your show back in 99 when I was out there covering Operation Urban Warrior
[2:43:04.640 --> 2:43:08.640]  in Oakland with the Marines training to confiscate our guns on video
[2:43:08.640 --> 2:43:13.640]  look how much has happened now everywhere they've got troops on the streets
[2:43:13.640 --> 2:43:17.640]  I mean the reports it's just intensifying incrementally
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:25.640]  well so they but on the other hand you know more and more Americans are getting to know what's going on
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:28.640]  I think that the other side is frightening
[2:43:28.640 --> 2:43:30.640]  I think they're going to start moving very very rapidly
[2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:36.640]  I think that this March that we had Washington DC I think was the 12th of September
[2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:40.640]  and it's probably between a minute and a minute and a half people were there
[2:43:40.640 --> 2:43:45.640]  I think that this really has been disturbed because this was an amazing thing
[2:43:45.640 --> 2:43:50.640]  in fact there would have been a lot more people there if they hadn't turned back the buses
[2:43:50.640 --> 2:43:55.640]  on the cars and people trying to come and join in that demonstration
[2:43:55.640 --> 2:44:00.640]  you are waking up an awful lot of people you and the few of the others who have part of it
[2:44:00.640 --> 2:44:04.640]  yeah but the problem is they then put the operative Glenn Beck in there to lead them
[2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:08.640]  we wake the people up and then we turn them over to Glenn Beck
[2:44:08.640 --> 2:44:12.640]  well he's as funny as a three dollar bill he would not everybody has to understand
[2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:17.640]  that Glenn Beck would not be on national television and he was telling the truth
[2:44:17.640 --> 2:44:22.640]  so basically he's going to say some things that are absolutely right you agree with
[2:44:22.640 --> 2:44:27.640]  but that's the old greatness with technique he gets in there he gets your confidence
[2:44:27.640 --> 2:44:31.640]  and then he gives you a lot of information that is frankly not true
[2:44:31.640 --> 2:44:37.640]  and that's why I think people you know look to you for these if they look to you for reliable information
[2:44:37.640 --> 2:44:40.640]  I appreciate so much you're getting that information out
[2:44:40.640 --> 2:44:44.640]  and you must be ruffling a lot of feathers because you're getting so much opposition
[2:44:44.640 --> 2:44:49.640]  people are saying you've got to get that guy off the air they say that locally here in Santa Cruz
[2:44:49.640 --> 2:44:55.640]  and of course hopefully our station manager is going to have the courage to keep you off
[2:44:55.640 --> 2:45:01.640]  but people are beginning to wake up I've been at this for 47 years
[2:45:01.640 --> 2:45:06.640]  and we are seeing more people accept now and especially when they're threatening our health care workers
[2:45:06.640 --> 2:45:10.640]  being fired and let me say that the health care workers who are there
[2:45:10.640 --> 2:45:15.640]  just tell them that you fire me and I'm going to sue you and I will tell any of them
[2:45:15.640 --> 2:45:19.640]  I'll come back and testify you first of all you do not need to take the shot
[2:45:19.640 --> 2:45:25.640]  because by the time they have the vaccine for the H1N1 influenza virus
[2:45:25.640 --> 2:45:31.640]  why the epidemic is going to be just about over it's already peaking out as we speak today
[2:45:31.640 --> 2:45:36.640]  but they've got 195 million doses of the vaccine
[2:45:36.640 --> 2:45:39.640]  what are they going to do with it they've got to give it to the people
[2:45:39.640 --> 2:45:44.640]  that's why they want to double up on the amount of mercury they're going to give to our children
[2:45:44.640 --> 2:45:51.640]  every child less than 10 years of age they want to give them not one but two swine flu shots
[2:45:51.640 --> 2:45:55.640]  Dr absolutely and the key point you make here from the CDC's own website
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:45:57.640]  is it's now going to be peaking in the next couple weeks
[2:45:57.640 --> 2:46:00.640]  why then for something incredibly mild are they doing this
[2:46:00.640 --> 2:46:04.640]  they're just fear mongering this event to be able to expand their control
[2:46:04.640 --> 2:46:09.640]  but going back to radio stations plug the local station I'm on
[2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:14.640]  I guess KOMI, KOMI here in the Monterey Bay area
[2:46:14.640 --> 2:46:17.640]  and that's doing a great job of getting your information out
[2:46:17.640 --> 2:46:21.640]  and I hear but very very few people object to it
[2:46:21.640 --> 2:46:24.640]  most people really appreciate what you're saying
[2:46:24.640 --> 2:46:29.640]  well I know that MZ the owner of those stations has had me on two different ones
[2:46:29.640 --> 2:46:33.640]  and I know it's been very popular but he has said there are people viciously
[2:46:33.640 --> 2:46:35.640]  a minority saying get me off
[2:46:35.640 --> 2:46:38.640]  I want to explain something to those people
[2:46:38.640 --> 2:46:42.640]  ten years ago or about nine years ago
[2:46:42.640 --> 2:46:45.640]  I was offered a national radio slot
[2:46:45.640 --> 2:46:47.640]  I was told I would be the next Glenn Beck
[2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:49.640]  Glenn Beck wasn't on the scene yet
[2:46:49.640 --> 2:46:51.640]  they said we need a young Rush Limbaugh
[2:46:51.640 --> 2:46:53.640]  no more New World Order, no more fellow reserve
[2:46:53.640 --> 2:46:56.640]  you reach out and grab people on the radio
[2:46:56.640 --> 2:47:00.640]  and of course as a journalist
[2:47:00.640 --> 2:47:02.640]  they say this is a private meeting
[2:47:02.640 --> 2:47:04.640]  you're not going to discuss this non-disclosure
[2:47:04.640 --> 2:47:05.640]  but this is the offer
[2:47:05.640 --> 2:47:07.640]  and then I had some other offers along the road
[2:47:07.640 --> 2:47:11.640]  and if I wanted to be on 500, 600 radio stations
[2:47:11.640 --> 2:47:15.640]  and be making $50 million a year like Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh
[2:47:15.640 --> 2:47:16.640]  I could have done it
[2:47:16.640 --> 2:47:17.640]  the money means nothing
[2:47:17.640 --> 2:47:21.640]  when you know they're putting cancer viruses in vaccines
[2:47:21.640 --> 2:47:24.640]  when you know they've designed the plastics to leach
[2:47:24.640 --> 2:47:27.640]  estrogen mimickers on record
[2:47:27.640 --> 2:47:29.640]  that's BBC today to sterilize you
[2:47:29.640 --> 2:47:32.640]  when you know you have no future
[2:47:32.640 --> 2:47:35.640]  why would I take $50 million and go live in a mansion
[2:47:35.640 --> 2:47:37.640]  and sit there and lie to people all day
[2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:38.640]  the truth is what matters
[2:47:38.640 --> 2:47:40.640]  we have no future
[2:47:40.640 --> 2:47:42.640]  this is a cold-blooded killing machine
[2:47:42.640 --> 2:47:45.640]  this isn't just some boss hog offering me $50 million
[2:47:45.640 --> 2:47:48.640]  to hang out with him in Roscoe Pico train
[2:47:48.640 --> 2:47:50.640]  there's no survival
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:53.640]  this is making a deal with the devil
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:56.640]  Gerald Rundus, a friend of mine, Dr. Monteef
[2:47:56.640 --> 2:47:59.640]  always gives the analogy of
[2:47:59.640 --> 2:48:01.640]  for selling out
[2:48:01.640 --> 2:48:03.640]  if I offered you $1,000 for your eyes
[2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:05.640]  would you take it, Dr. Monteef?
[2:48:05.640 --> 2:48:07.640]  absolutely not
[2:48:07.640 --> 2:48:09.640]  what have I offered you?
[2:48:09.640 --> 2:48:11.640]  what have I offered you a million?
[2:48:11.640 --> 2:48:12.640]  or a billion?
[2:48:12.640 --> 2:48:13.640]  nothing
[2:48:13.640 --> 2:48:16.640]  because freedom is the most important thing we have
[2:48:16.640 --> 2:48:18.640]  your eyes exactly
[2:48:18.640 --> 2:48:19.640]  exactly
[2:48:19.640 --> 2:48:20.640]  to finish the statement
[2:48:20.640 --> 2:48:23.640]  your eyes are just a window to the soul
[2:48:23.640 --> 2:48:26.640]  how much money would I take for my soul?
[2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:29.640]  so folks, you don't hurt me when you get me taken off the air
[2:48:29.640 --> 2:48:30.640]  you hurt yourselves
[2:48:30.640 --> 2:48:32.640]  I've told you the truth
[2:48:32.640 --> 2:48:35.640]  it hurts me at a level of wanting to reach new people
[2:48:35.640 --> 2:48:38.640]  to warn them for all those women listening
[2:48:38.640 --> 2:48:40.640]  who can go Google Gardasil deaths
[2:48:40.640 --> 2:48:42.640]  and find out how many people it's killing
[2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:44.640]  so they don't kill their daughter or maim them
[2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:47.640]  so when you try to take me off the air
[2:48:47.640 --> 2:48:51.640]  it is on you murdering those young girls
[2:48:51.640 --> 2:48:53.640]  and if you want that on your soul
[2:48:53.640 --> 2:48:55.640]  my God just be forewarned
[2:48:55.640 --> 2:48:57.640]  so I want to make that clear
[2:48:57.640 --> 2:48:59.640]  that there's nothing I'd like better, Dr. Monteef
[2:48:59.640 --> 2:49:01.640]  than to quit this show and stop doing this
[2:49:01.640 --> 2:49:03.640]  this is a burden
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:05.640]  and so people that think they get me by attacking me
[2:49:05.640 --> 2:49:07.640]  or lying about me or doing that
[2:49:07.640 --> 2:49:10.640]  and they attack the station owners that have courage
[2:49:10.640 --> 2:49:11.640]  to put me on
[2:49:11.640 --> 2:49:14.640]  you folks don't even know where I'm coming from
[2:49:14.640 --> 2:49:16.640]  and so I just feel sorry for you
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:18.640]  Dr. Monteef, go ahead
[2:49:18.640 --> 2:49:20.640]  Well, hi, Meyer, what you do, Alex?
[2:49:20.640 --> 2:49:21.640]  You do it so well
[2:49:21.640 --> 2:49:23.640]  you do it better than anybody else
[2:49:23.640 --> 2:49:25.640]  I know because you speak with this intensity
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:27.640]  people have to understand
[2:49:27.640 --> 2:49:28.640]  as Alex said
[2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:29.640]  first of all
[2:49:29.640 --> 2:49:32.640]  the H1N1 infection swine flu
[2:49:32.640 --> 2:49:34.640]  is a very mild disease
[2:49:34.640 --> 2:49:36.640]  in the initial study that they did
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:39.640]  over in Australia
[2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:41.640]  where they actually
[2:49:41.640 --> 2:49:43.640]  this is the study published in New England
[2:49:43.640 --> 2:49:45.640]  Journal of Medicine on the 10th of September
[2:49:45.640 --> 2:49:47.640]  and this is the
[2:49:47.640 --> 2:49:49.640]  the vaccine trial
[2:49:49.640 --> 2:49:51.640]  that they're using to justify
[2:49:51.640 --> 2:49:53.640]  using the vaccine in the United States
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:49:56.640]  they've tested an entirely different vaccine
[2:49:56.640 --> 2:49:57.640]  in Australia
[2:49:57.640 --> 2:49:59.640]  the one that was at the adjuvant
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:00.640]  did it
[2:50:00.640 --> 2:50:02.640]  they were scraping the adjuvant
[2:50:02.640 --> 2:50:04.640]  but what was really so interesting
[2:50:04.640 --> 2:50:05.640]  about the study
[2:50:05.640 --> 2:50:07.640]  although they didn't play it up
[2:50:07.640 --> 2:50:09.640]  was that they got all these people recruited
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:11.640]  they wanted to get these studies done
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:12.640]  as quickly as they could
[2:50:12.640 --> 2:50:14.640]  so they tested all of them ahead of time
[2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:16.640]  just to see if they had antibodies
[2:50:16.640 --> 2:50:18.640]  to the infection
[2:50:18.640 --> 2:50:20.640]  to the swine flu infection
[2:50:20.640 --> 2:50:22.640]  because first they wanted
[2:50:22.640 --> 2:50:25.640]  they figured probably one or two of them would have
[2:50:25.640 --> 2:50:28.640]  they found that 14% of one group
[2:50:28.640 --> 2:50:30.640]  already been infected
[2:50:30.640 --> 2:50:32.640]  and 39% of another group
[2:50:32.640 --> 2:50:33.640]  had already been infected
[2:50:33.640 --> 2:50:34.640]  in other words
[2:50:34.640 --> 2:50:36.640]  they were already immune to the disease
[2:50:36.640 --> 2:50:38.640]  and all they could accomplish
[2:50:38.640 --> 2:50:43.640]  by giving them the vaccine
[2:50:43.640 --> 2:50:46.640]  was going to boost their immunity to the disease
[2:50:46.640 --> 2:50:48.640]  they were already immune to
[2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:50.640]  most of the people in the United States
[2:50:50.640 --> 2:50:52.640]  have had this disease already
[2:50:52.640 --> 2:50:54.640]  but they can't let them know
[2:50:54.640 --> 2:50:57.640]  they got 195 million doses of the vaccine
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:51:24.640]  Stay there! Got him right!
