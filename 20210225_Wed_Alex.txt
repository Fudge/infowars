[00:00.000 --> 00:23.160]  They asked you this because you had the rioters who were there and some have told police that
[00:23.160 --> 00:25.360]  they were there because the president told them to be there.
[00:25.360 --> 00:29.920]  The president after the riot started tweeted that Pence was a coward.
[00:29.920 --> 00:34.840]  What was your reaction when you heard what the president tweeted and did Pence feel any
[00:34.840 --> 00:38.880]  betrayal from him given how loyal he's been to the president?
[00:38.880 --> 00:41.520]  I don't think there was much focus on the tweet at the time.
[00:41.520 --> 00:46.240]  To be honest, the vice president was in a secure location on the phone with leader McCarthy,
[00:46.240 --> 00:50.720]  leader McConnell, speaker Pelosi and leader Schumer trying to figure out how can we get
[00:50.720 --> 00:52.440]  back to work as quickly as we can.
[00:52.440 --> 00:56.720]  And then he was talking to General Milley and to Secretary Miller to say how quickly
[00:56.720 --> 01:01.640]  can the National Guard get here and fulfill and make sure that this facility is safe.
[01:01.640 --> 01:05.720]  So his focus was really on how quickly can we get back to finishing the work of the American
[01:05.720 --> 01:11.320]  people and not allowing those who had perpetrated those crimes to be victorious on that day.
[01:11.320 --> 01:12.920]  So did he feel any betrayal?
[01:12.920 --> 01:15.480]  Was he upset at all that Trump didn't go on?
[01:15.480 --> 01:21.040]  Look, I think the reality is that the president and vice president met.
[01:21.040 --> 01:23.280]  They talked several times before they departed.
[01:23.280 --> 01:26.160]  They departed amicably.
[01:26.160 --> 01:30.160]  The president told the vice president he did a great job for him.
[01:30.160 --> 01:31.520]  And they've spoken since.
[01:31.520 --> 01:36.960]  And so look, the reality is that clearly there are differences about what the vice president's
[01:36.960 --> 01:39.520]  role was on January 6th.
[01:39.520 --> 01:43.320]  But I think that in that moment, the vice president was focused in doing his job and
[01:43.320 --> 01:46.600]  staying at his post until it was complete.
[01:46.600 --> 01:51.440]  I've never felt better about President Trump's leading the party than I do right now.
[01:51.440 --> 01:52.720]  Let's talk about the president.
[01:52.720 --> 01:56.840]  He has a big speech this weekend at CPAC.
[01:56.840 --> 02:02.880]  I know there might be a couple of Republicans that you know that aren't particularly fond
[02:02.880 --> 02:03.880]  of the president.
[02:03.880 --> 02:04.880]  I don't know.
[02:04.880 --> 02:07.620]  Maybe they want to go back to the good old days of the establishment, only doing show
[02:07.620 --> 02:11.640]  votes to repeal and replace Obamacare, but not getting anything done.
[02:11.640 --> 02:14.760]  I don't think that's the future of the Republican Party.
[02:14.760 --> 02:21.080]  What would you expect the president in this speech to be talking about?
[02:21.080 --> 02:26.040]  Number one, he will position himself as the alternative to Joe Biden.
[02:26.040 --> 02:32.480]  He I think will make a speech that will unify Republicans on policy that I think he has been
[02:32.480 --> 02:33.480]  working the phones.
[02:33.480 --> 02:35.240]  I was with him all weekend.
[02:35.240 --> 02:38.000]  He wants us to win in 2022.
[02:38.000 --> 02:39.000]  And stay tuned.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.600]  I think you're going to see over the next couple of months, Donald Trump lead the Republican
[02:44.600 --> 02:50.920]  Party on policy and give us the energy we need to take back the House and the Senate.
[02:50.920 --> 02:53.240]  The Democrats are doing their part.
[02:53.240 --> 02:58.800]  If we could get behind President Trump and follow his lead, we will win in 2022.
[02:58.800 --> 03:03.520]  If we argue with ourselves, we're going to we're going to lose and there's no reason
[03:03.520 --> 03:08.360]  to lose.
[03:08.360 --> 03:12.240]  I played those clips because those are big deals.
[03:12.240 --> 03:16.360]  Big Pence does extremely calculate everything Lindsey Graham does is extremely calculated.
[03:16.360 --> 03:21.800]  They're calculating individuals and they are members of the globalist establishment.
[03:21.800 --> 03:25.280]  They want America to be dominant over the global system.
[03:25.280 --> 03:29.800]  But they support a lot of the evil aims of it, but they are light years better than the
[03:29.800 --> 03:36.040]  totally satanic Democrats and the chai comms, obviously in the EU.
[03:36.040 --> 03:40.400]  But their survivors, Mitch McConnell is a Chinese agent.
[03:40.400 --> 03:44.200]  So he's pure evil, obviously.
[03:44.200 --> 03:50.640]  But to have them come out, I've got a bunch of other clips that are similar and all signal
[03:50.640 --> 03:52.040]  that they support Trump.
[03:52.040 --> 03:56.080]  That's because they don't want Trump to start a third party that would destroy the Republican
[03:56.080 --> 03:58.640]  Party and put the Democrats in total command.
[03:58.640 --> 04:04.440]  So if Graham and Pence were completely evil, this is an exercise in kissing their ass.
[04:04.440 --> 04:08.520]  I'm just breaking down a real politic in an active alien way, their perspective.
[04:08.520 --> 04:12.800]  It doesn't mean I agree with this, I'm playing devil's advocate from their mindset.
[04:12.800 --> 04:16.600]  It's like when I say, well, Trump thinks if he gets the vaccine out quicker, they'll
[04:16.600 --> 04:18.040]  unlock the economy faster.
[04:18.040 --> 04:21.600]  It doesn't mean I agree with Trump pushing the vaccine one of the worst things he did.
[04:21.600 --> 04:24.080]  But I get why he did it from his perspective.
[04:24.080 --> 04:28.600]  I don't play Machiavellian things, but I engage in Machiavellian analysis.
[04:28.600 --> 04:31.360]  You could see where these guys are coming from.
[04:31.360 --> 04:33.480]  And Trump's not very Machiavelli.
[04:33.480 --> 04:37.520]  He's more straightforward, but he does engage in some of that type stuff and he's not up
[04:37.520 --> 04:41.360]  to speed on what mRNA vaccines are versus standard ones.
[04:41.360 --> 04:43.200]  But that's just an example.
[04:43.200 --> 04:48.880]  The point is, it is a big deal to have Pence and Graham come out and kiss the ring.
[04:48.880 --> 04:51.800]  So we'll talk about where we're going forward at this point.
[04:51.800 --> 04:52.800]  This is really good news.
[04:52.800 --> 04:53.800]  Stay with us.
[04:53.800 --> 05:03.760]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there, about looking at
[05:03.760 --> 05:07.800]  the world from the perspective of the globalists, that the public's so dumbed down that they
[05:07.800 --> 05:10.920]  don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that
[05:10.920 --> 05:14.200]  we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[05:14.200 --> 05:16.680]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[05:16.680 --> 05:17.680]  They play God.
[05:17.680 --> 05:21.640]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[05:21.640 --> 05:25.160]  And I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me.
[05:25.160 --> 05:26.680]  They've tried to join them.
[05:26.680 --> 05:30.880]  But metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit.
[05:30.880 --> 05:32.200]  I'm the connection with God.
[05:32.200 --> 05:36.120]  And I know that God does not like to flex and I've joined the enemy.
[05:36.120 --> 05:40.600]  But I'll tell you at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with
[05:40.600 --> 05:45.000]  the system, believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power out of it.
[05:45.000 --> 05:50.800]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[05:50.800 --> 05:55.360]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real
[05:55.360 --> 06:12.320]  God of the universe doesn't like, and that's a fact.
[06:12.320 --> 06:18.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Wednesday, February 24th of the year is 2021.
[06:18.360 --> 06:22.240]  All right, I have some very good news for you.
[06:22.240 --> 06:27.280]  Very good news in this sea of troubles.
[06:27.280 --> 06:28.880]  We are on board the ship of truth.
[06:28.880 --> 06:30.000]  We have God on our side.
[06:30.000 --> 06:35.280]  As long as we keep the North Star fixed, we are going to make it through this one way
[06:35.280 --> 06:36.280]  or another.
[06:36.280 --> 06:39.480]  Let me give you the good news here on the Alex Jones broadcast.
[06:39.480 --> 06:45.080]  Before I tell you about the big guest, several big guests we've got joining us here today
[06:45.080 --> 06:51.680]  on the second, third and fourth hour.
[06:51.680 --> 07:00.400]  We have seen major polls come out that are scientific showing 90 plus percent of Republicans
[07:00.400 --> 07:03.880]  see Trump as the leader of the party.
[07:03.880 --> 07:08.280]  We have other mainline polls out of USA Today, the New York Times and others that show between
[07:08.280 --> 07:14.360]  75 and 86 percent and a whole other bevy of polls showing similar numbers.
[07:14.360 --> 07:17.000]  So here's the deal.
[07:17.000 --> 07:23.400]  Trump had about 80 percent support amongst Republicans in real internal polls from the
[07:23.400 --> 07:29.720]  pollsters I talked to, and that's what I saw on the street before they stole the election.
[07:29.720 --> 07:35.240]  The Democrats are really scared, folks, because when you send somebody into exile, when you
[07:35.240 --> 07:39.640]  steal something from folks, it doesn't make them hate it.
[07:39.640 --> 07:41.080]  It makes them like it.
[07:41.080 --> 07:54.120]  We've all heard the saying that distance makes the heart grow fond, familiarity breeds contempt.
[07:54.120 --> 08:03.720]  And now, hey, Trump's been gone a month and a half or a little over a month, and already
[08:03.720 --> 08:07.240]  gas prices have exploded, already the stock market's going down.
[08:07.240 --> 08:14.200]  We have the transgender health and human services ugly fat dude with curly hair saying his main
[08:14.200 --> 08:17.000]  mission is to chop your son's penis and testicles off.
[08:17.000 --> 08:18.720]  I mean, this is a family show.
[08:18.720 --> 08:20.220]  That's what they're announcing.
[08:20.220 --> 08:24.000]  Literally coming for scalps, Native Americans sometimes, you know, I guess if the French
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.640]  taught them how to do it, prove they killed people, bring us some scalps.
[08:26.640 --> 08:30.200]  Well, this dude's like, hey, I'm coming for scalps.
[08:30.200 --> 08:33.280]  Our mission is to chop your five-year-old balls off.
[08:33.280 --> 08:40.560]  I mean, you talk about a scary horror movie character, oh, and by the way, Biden's got
[08:40.560 --> 08:44.880]  his executive orders about dudes can compete in women's sports.
[08:44.880 --> 08:51.440]  Oh, but Lance Armstrong couldn't take testosterone to out testosterone men, but a man can go
[08:51.440 --> 08:56.360]  with testosterone, bones that are twice the size, muscles that are three times stronger
[08:56.360 --> 09:00.840]  on average, and then go, that's a quality.
[09:00.840 --> 09:04.960]  And finally, women are clicking to this that this isn't about empowering women, this isn't
[09:04.960 --> 09:08.760]  about empowering men, this is about breaking up the family and then breaking up the genders
[09:08.760 --> 09:09.760]  themselves.
[09:09.760 --> 09:13.040]  So we have all that going on.
[09:13.040 --> 09:19.360]  And so people are realizing this and they are understanding this and they are getting
[09:19.360 --> 09:20.360]  it.
[09:20.360 --> 09:26.840]  Now, there's a parallax view here or a paradox.
[09:26.840 --> 09:35.600]  And it's that people keep saying, hey, Democrats are leaving in droves to Republicans, hey,
[09:35.600 --> 09:39.880]  there's a massive awakening, Biden could hardly talk, there was already a massive awakening.
[09:39.880 --> 09:45.160]  Trump won in a gigantor landslide, gigantor.
[09:45.160 --> 09:48.840]  That's how they had to wait till the polls closed to go cheat and find out what to be,
[09:48.840 --> 09:52.120]  because it was just, and it's why the spike had to be, you know, five times all the voting
[09:52.120 --> 09:56.320]  of the day because it was just ridiculous.
[09:56.320 --> 10:00.040]  And they had to do it down and dirty in front of everybody, because these globalists already
[10:00.040 --> 10:03.320]  sold us up to China and others, and these are deals that have been made, and they're
[10:03.320 --> 10:05.440]  all Chinese agents, basically.
[10:05.440 --> 10:07.880]  The globalists use China to corrupt people here.
[10:07.880 --> 10:10.960]  The globalists are above the Chinese, but they're Chinese agents.
[10:10.960 --> 10:11.960]  They're all blackmailed.
[10:11.960 --> 10:14.640]  That's why they're so scared.
[10:14.640 --> 10:19.480]  That's why they'll do anything.
[10:19.480 --> 10:24.240]  So they tried with the Capitol to have a big bloody event with their anti-fibervocateurs
[10:24.240 --> 10:30.960]  that was even testified to in Congress yesterday by the police chief that resigned.
[10:30.960 --> 10:37.960]  He was ordered by the main chief to send half the police to traffic control.
[10:37.960 --> 10:39.560]  They were the victims that day.
[10:39.560 --> 10:43.960]  They were not part of a conspiracy, like General Honorary says, working with Trump supporters.
[10:43.960 --> 10:51.320]  They were outgunned, outmanned, when Antifa and several Southern Parvy Law Center type
[10:51.320 --> 11:00.840]  infiltrators went into their groups and provocative a minority of people to break into the Capitol.
[11:00.840 --> 11:03.360]  And there was meant to be attempted arrest of Pelosi.
[11:03.360 --> 11:04.360]  Death was meant to happen.
[11:04.360 --> 11:09.840]  That's how they used the Q operation to confuse everybody and to make them think they were
[11:09.840 --> 11:10.960]  taking orders from Trump.
[11:10.960 --> 11:15.240]  But less than one tenth of 1% of the million people that showed up to hear Trump actually
[11:15.240 --> 11:18.880]  took the bait and did it.
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.240]  And just like in other capitals, when leftists have taken them over, once things got violent,
[11:23.240 --> 11:28.040]  at a certain point the police stood down after they were able to get the Congress into the
[11:28.040 --> 11:29.040]  basement.
[11:29.040 --> 11:31.040]  Now, if you got near the basement, they shot you.
[11:31.040 --> 11:32.440]  You saw what happened to Ashley Babbot.
[11:32.440 --> 11:36.240]  It's a sad story, but they were told, anybody comes through to the entrances, you get to
[11:36.240 --> 11:39.880]  the basement, you kill them.
[11:39.880 --> 11:40.880]  And I'm not defending that.
[11:40.880 --> 11:46.680]  It was wrong, but this was a hysteria things got out of control.
[11:46.680 --> 11:50.720]  So now, as Mark Twain said, a lie goes halfway around the world before the truth puts its
[11:50.720 --> 11:51.720]  pants on.
[11:51.720 --> 11:57.320]  Now, a month plus later, a month and I guess four days later, or I guess that was the inauguration
[11:57.320 --> 12:03.400]  was a month ago, a month and a half or more, January 6, people now are understanding late.
[12:03.400 --> 12:09.760]  CNN paid $70,000, along with others, to Jayden X, he bragged that the left was infiltrating
[12:09.760 --> 12:12.080]  and wearing Trump gear.
[12:12.080 --> 12:15.440]  And they've got other undercover videos and we've got video of them anti-foot putting
[12:15.440 --> 12:17.640]  on their modern gear.
[12:17.640 --> 12:21.240]  And wait, we've got documents where the feds provocateur this.
[12:21.240 --> 12:23.000]  Yeah.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.360]  And so that's all coming out, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:26.360 --> 12:31.680]  And so stealing the election, doing this to Trump, doing this to American people, isn't
[12:31.680 --> 12:34.880]  going to make Trump weaker, it's going to make Trump stronger, and it's going to make
[12:34.880 --> 12:36.840]  everything Trump does stronger.
[12:36.840 --> 12:40.920]  So sure as the sun came up this morning, I got an email from the Southern Barbary Law
[12:40.920 --> 12:49.440]  Center saying, we've got witnesses that you hate Trump and that you hate your listeners.
[12:49.440 --> 12:53.520]  All that is is an attempt, we're going to run a story that you hate Trump and hate your
[12:53.520 --> 12:58.440]  listeners to drive a wedge, hoping Trump's dumb enough to think I hate Trump and hoping
[12:58.440 --> 13:00.280]  I'm dumb enough to then hate Trump.
[13:00.280 --> 13:05.080]  And then they use it as a quote, a film I was in where I said I would love hate relationship.
[13:05.080 --> 13:08.320]  I support President Trump, don't like some of the things he does, and I've been persecuted
[13:08.320 --> 13:11.680]  for supporting him, so half of me hates Trump.
[13:11.680 --> 13:12.680]  That's a true statement.
[13:12.680 --> 13:20.240]  But these people parse words and manipulate, but what I never did was say that I despise
[13:20.240 --> 13:21.240]  my audience.
[13:21.240 --> 13:25.080]  I'm like a man thrown into the ocean, in the middle of nowhere, and all I've got is
[13:25.080 --> 13:28.160]  a life raft, and the listeners literally are the life raft.
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.600]  You literally keep us on air, you defend us in the fight, I want to keep fighting, we're
[13:32.600 --> 13:33.600]  all together.
[13:33.600 --> 13:35.680]  I'm your life raft, you're mine.
[13:35.680 --> 13:37.000]  But again, it's that same thing.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  What are they trying to do?
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.760]  They're not Trump out of the Republican Party, so he's not the leader.
[13:40.760 --> 13:45.160]  Trick Trump into doing a third party, led by a bunch of rhinos, and the Lincoln Project,
[13:45.160 --> 13:50.160]  the pedophile project, and the former RNC head that heads it up.
[13:50.160 --> 13:55.240]  And so all of that is unfolding, and I told you six months ago about the Lincoln Project,
[13:55.240 --> 13:59.440]  I said I can take one look at those guys and tell you they're a pedo operation.
[13:59.440 --> 14:06.720]  Those pedos all look the same, man, and they're all compromised.
[14:06.720 --> 14:11.240]  And I happen to know even more about the Lincoln Project people information, I'm going to leave
[14:11.240 --> 14:12.240]  it at that.
[14:12.240 --> 14:17.800]  But if they're having sex with gay hookers, that's their issue.
[14:17.800 --> 14:21.160]  But then they can't be compromised, it's going to have to be exposed.
[14:21.160 --> 14:23.520]  And they sure as hell can't do it on taxpayer money.
[14:23.520 --> 14:28.640]  So yeah, you got a bunch of those Republicans going to gay strip clubs and screwing trainings
[14:28.640 --> 14:30.680]  and screwing dudes, okay?
[14:30.680 --> 14:33.400]  And that's the Lincoln Project, okay?
[14:33.400 --> 14:36.640]  And if they challenge me, I'll just release the information, how's that sound?
[14:36.640 --> 14:43.080]  So that's what's going on here is a bunch of compromised individuals, ladies and gentlemen,
[14:43.080 --> 14:47.280]  that are traitors against this country, infiltrated by the CCP and others, and they're trying
[14:47.280 --> 14:53.320]  to cut Trump off from us, and cut him away from us, and us away from him, and it's not
[14:53.320 --> 15:00.240]  working, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:00.240 --> 15:01.240]  Trump is an idea now.
[15:01.240 --> 15:02.240]  Do you do a perfect job?
[15:02.240 --> 15:03.240]  Absolutely not.
[15:03.240 --> 15:04.240]  Was he wrong on some things?
[15:04.240 --> 15:05.240]  Yes.
[15:05.240 --> 15:13.240]  Trump is a populism and Americanism, and they want that shot down, and they want that defeated.
[15:13.240 --> 15:17.040]  And so we have to champion that, and hold that up, because it's bigger than Trump.
[15:17.040 --> 15:19.400]  He's now a symbol like the American Eagle.
[15:19.400 --> 15:22.480]  So is Info Wars, and there's a battle over that symbol.
[15:22.480 --> 15:26.160]  That's why your support of us is paramount, and the enemy can't stand the fact that we're
[15:26.160 --> 15:29.960]  not on the air.
[15:29.960 --> 15:32.960]  So it's all coming up.
[15:32.960 --> 15:36.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's all coming up today.
[15:36.280 --> 15:40.320]  And Sasha Barakohan, not an American, the medals in our elections, who says he wants
[15:40.320 --> 15:45.080]  to be arrested, and Mark Zuckerberg arrested, he cannot admit it, he helped cover up the
[15:45.080 --> 15:46.080]  Chinese espionage.
[15:46.080 --> 15:48.440]  We're going to play the video.
[15:48.440 --> 15:53.200]  He helped cover up Chinese espionage.
[15:53.200 --> 15:57.720]  That boys is a bad man.
[15:57.720 --> 15:59.320]  The people are awakening.
[15:59.320 --> 16:02.440]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[16:02.440 --> 16:03.840]  Governments are an amazing tool.
[16:03.840 --> 16:06.520]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[16:06.520 --> 16:11.000]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chikoms
[16:11.000 --> 16:17.520]  especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets
[16:17.520 --> 16:21.520]  when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on
[16:21.520 --> 16:24.840]  record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[16:24.840 --> 16:31.360]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[16:31.360 --> 16:32.840]  In their own words, they admit it.
[16:32.840 --> 16:37.720]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket-pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[16:37.720 --> 16:39.680]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[16:39.680 --> 16:40.680]  They're faraday cages.
[16:40.680 --> 16:42.440]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[16:42.440 --> 16:44.440]  They work absolutely great.
[16:44.440 --> 16:49.440]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[16:49.440 --> 16:52.560]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because
[16:52.560 --> 16:53.560]  it's not their business.

[17:10.240 --> 17:16.760]  and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people lined up at the few grocery
[17:16.760 --> 17:21.680]  stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned away after hours
[17:21.680 --> 17:23.120]  of freezing in the cold.
[17:23.120 --> 17:27.080]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power
[17:27.080 --> 17:29.080]  in their house and then running out of gas.
[17:29.080 --> 17:33.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king and food is the energy our bodies run off of and water

[17:55.320 --> 18:00.720]  Big discounts probably a few more days.
[18:00.720 --> 18:29.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[19:01.720 --> 19:04.160]  We are back live.
[19:04.160 --> 19:07.720]  You know, I don't think about somebody on a safari hunt when Dave Mustaine sings those
[19:07.720 --> 19:08.720]  words.
[19:08.720 --> 19:11.120]  You know, he reversed his view on hunting later.
[19:11.120 --> 19:13.120]  I also get his view about canned hunts.
[19:13.120 --> 19:15.120]  I don't think they're a good thing.
[19:15.120 --> 19:21.360]  But at the same time, I think about George Soros and Bill Gates and the medical tyranny
[19:21.360 --> 19:27.160]  and Jeffrey Epstein and them trying to manipulate our DNA and this weird cult they're in.
[19:27.160 --> 19:31.520]  I think of him pulling the needle full of those toxic chemicals getting ready to inject
[19:31.520 --> 19:35.600]  it to you and your family and then to watch the media cover up the adverse effects.
[19:35.600 --> 19:44.280]  Somebody put a music video out with that Megadeth song countdown to extinction with the articles
[19:44.280 --> 19:49.080]  of the studies and the actual Bell's policy and the paralyzation and the death and all
[19:49.080 --> 19:50.080]  the rest of it.
[19:50.080 --> 19:57.000]  Okay, let me get back to what I was hitting on that's so huge.
[19:57.000 --> 20:02.120]  When Trump goes out and Trump rallies the states and Trump makes his main focus election
[20:02.120 --> 20:08.280]  fraud and gets legislatures to pass specific laws prohibiting these illegal ballots, they've
[20:08.280 --> 20:14.200]  already got laws saying you can't do it, but laws with teeth in it to prosecute governors
[20:14.200 --> 20:19.080]  and others that make these consent degree agreements that we're going to be able to
[20:19.080 --> 20:25.000]  stop the globalist because of course blue collar Americans, black, white, Hispanic everybody
[20:25.000 --> 20:29.400]  else are flocking to Republicans right now with the shutdown of the Keystone pipeline
[20:29.400 --> 20:35.360]  and the dying of the stock market and their 401K is going down 30% in just a month.
[20:35.360 --> 20:39.400]  People really get it and they see that Biden can hardly talk and they know he's a puppet
[20:39.400 --> 20:46.880]  and so the system needs to destroy Trump and to do that they're going to want to stage
[20:46.880 --> 20:49.040]  false flags.
[20:49.040 --> 20:54.800]  To do that they're going to want to shoot up schools, shoot up churches, shoot up universities,
[20:54.800 --> 21:01.560]  shoot up shopping malls and claim that right wing militia slash racist did it.
[21:01.560 --> 21:06.000]  And that's what all the preparation is and everything you see is about using the Pentagon
[21:06.000 --> 21:13.780]  and the FBI and see American people are having a second round of hearings admitting it all.
[21:13.780 --> 21:18.760]  But what they wanted to come out at those hearings isn't.
[21:18.760 --> 21:23.800]  They had the former chief of police there who was not in control because he had half
[21:23.800 --> 21:29.480]  his officers taken away trying to blame him for it and then when he's asked about it,
[21:29.480 --> 21:30.480]  it's true.
[21:30.480 --> 21:37.400]  Yes, known Antifa did promote online their plan to attack four months before and we've
[21:37.400 --> 21:41.680]  aired you the Sunshine Project videos where they had the maps of the Capitol and how to
[21:41.680 --> 21:46.080]  break the windows and how to get weapons in and how to kidnap people and how to use guns
[21:46.080 --> 21:49.480]  on Congress and these are academics and federal employees.
[21:49.480 --> 21:54.600]  The FBI is not going to arrest them, the FBI is not going to their houses when they're
[21:54.600 --> 21:58.280]  all promoting it on those videos I've played for you.
[21:58.280 --> 22:03.760]  The name of the report that has it all in it is Democrats confess to staging January
[22:03.760 --> 22:05.480]  6 Capitol attack.
[22:05.480 --> 22:13.840]  It's the featured video or if it is it move it back to the top please at band.video.
[22:13.840 --> 22:16.200]  And it's all right there.
[22:16.200 --> 22:18.640]  And last time I checked it's only got like a quarter million views.
[22:18.640 --> 22:20.160]  Can you pull it up for me?
[22:20.160 --> 22:22.360]  It eats 10 million views.
[22:22.360 --> 22:26.640]  It's undercover video and audio of Antifa admitting they staged as Trump people and
[22:26.640 --> 22:33.000]  then dressing up like Trump people and going and then tricking a few hundred to join them.
[22:33.000 --> 22:39.880]  Only 274,000 views and I'm not bitching anybody but that's pathetic.
[22:39.880 --> 22:48.000]  I mean it's a 20 minute video it proves it all right there.
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.320]  Really mind blowing.
[22:50.320 --> 22:52.120]  We show you the clips.
[22:52.120 --> 22:53.120]  We lay it all out.
[22:53.120 --> 22:59.160]  So the only hope the globalists have is massive false flags to blame us and then try to start
[22:59.160 --> 23:03.480]  some civil war and have gun confiscation which Biden admits he wants which will cause
[23:03.480 --> 23:08.360]  a real conflict which again the globalists want to collapse the U.S. to consolidate control
[23:08.360 --> 23:09.720]  of it into the world government.
[23:09.720 --> 23:13.680]  They're already positioning the dollar to fall, they're already shutting off our energy,
[23:13.680 --> 23:16.880]  they're already demoralizing our children, they're already bankrupting everything, they're
[23:16.880 --> 23:20.480]  already trying to keep us locked down forever just like Europe and China is open for business.
[23:20.480 --> 23:28.280]  It's all happening and we need governors and legislatures and Congress to get it and we
[23:28.280 --> 23:34.440]  did not throw people overboard like Ted Cruz because he took his kids to Cancun when Governor
[23:34.440 --> 23:37.720]  Cuomo killed 16,000 old people on purpose.
[23:37.720 --> 23:44.840]  We need to get serious here ladies and gentlemen and understand our enemies want Trump destroyed.
[23:44.840 --> 23:49.600]  They want info wars destroyed because we're standing in the way of you and your family
[23:49.600 --> 23:53.800]  and make no mistake info wars is standing in the way of the new world order and I know
[23:53.800 --> 23:57.520]  most of you know that and I appreciate you but people need to have that burn in because
[23:57.520 --> 24:01.800]  I think all the time about downsizing or cutting back or giving up just because I've done this
[24:01.800 --> 24:06.480]  so long that it totally possesses me and so I have no life but that's only a thought.
[24:06.480 --> 24:16.640]  I would never do it because I have a responsibility to take these creatures on.
[24:16.640 --> 24:19.400]  So I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back and play you Sasha Barrico and
[24:19.400 --> 24:27.840]  on TV bragging that he released the Giuliani video, a Giuliani taking his microphone off
[24:27.840 --> 24:35.120]  and let's just face it he assumed the position of a young eighth woman wanted to have sex
[24:35.120 --> 24:40.640]  with him he's a horn dog he's well known it's not a secret that Giuliani I mean I'm
[24:40.640 --> 24:44.920]  going to leave it at that they're of age women okay it's not illegal but the point is she's
[24:44.920 --> 24:48.240]  asking him to take care of wanting all over him and he was getting the mic off but he
[24:48.240 --> 24:53.080]  was like okay lady I'm laying back the point is it's not an underage girl he wasn't killing
[24:53.080 --> 25:00.640]  old people in a he wasn't killing old people in a nursing home he was trying to open the
[25:00.640 --> 25:07.600]  economy back up and expose election fraud and Cohen admits he released that to stop
[25:07.600 --> 25:12.760]  the news about the laptop which is Chinese Communist Takeover in Hunter Biden and missing
[25:12.760 --> 25:16.820]  people and sex with his niece and just I'm just everything else so that's who Cohen
[25:16.820 --> 25:21.240]  is a monstrous creature.
[25:21.240 --> 25:26.280]  Now just I mean look at an un-American not an American he wants your guns he wants your
[25:26.280 --> 25:30.640]  speech and he comes over here and pisses on us and does it all behind the First Amendment
[25:30.640 --> 25:31.640]  sick.
[25:31.640 --> 25:35.120]  We're gonna go to break but I've got a big announcement I want to make we have a get
[25:35.120 --> 25:40.560]  prepared while you still can giant super sale that I won't have time to get to during the

[26:51.960 --> 26:58.200]  anywhere in the world right now info wars store.com in the early 1990s it was a really
[26:58.200 --> 27:06.760]  funny movie that came out called Wayne's World even before I had access to the show in the
[27:06.760 --> 27:13.160]  mid 90s I wouldn't call that movie and thought man that was fun to speak out have your own
[27:13.160 --> 27:17.480]  ideas and even if you're a nerd you're still entertaining because you're real well what
[27:17.480 --> 27:25.640]  are they saying Wayne's World every day when I cover these huge topics I don't feel worthy
[27:25.640 --> 27:29.360]  to talk to you because these topics are so huge are so real but I'm trying to tell you
[27:29.360 --> 27:33.200]  the truth I'm trying to get it right and most of the time we do the globalists love lying
[27:33.200 --> 27:39.400]  to you they love manipulating you they enjoy destroying humanity they enjoy manipulating
[27:39.400 --> 27:45.640]  ideas and using people's ignorance against them that for me is really set down and disgusting
[27:45.640 --> 27:51.040]  so you've got to pledge for myself and all info wars crew that we will never join the
[27:51.040 --> 27:56.200]  globalists we will never know and manipulate you because we know we're all in this together
[27:56.200 --> 28:04.040]  I knew Trump was in battle I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of
[28:04.040 --> 28:09.600]  the enemy and a lot of people just couldn't believe it they're like oh no it's 3g chest
[28:09.600 --> 28:13.760]  5g chest he's invincible and I understand why people wanted to believe that because this
[28:13.760 --> 28:17.880]  is scary what's going on the global government the new world order and now that people have
[28:17.880 --> 28:21.680]  got the facts that's real they won't somebody to come save them from well Trump sure as
[28:21.680 --> 28:26.560]  hell tried my gosh look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled depending
[28:26.560 --> 28:31.000]  on the drug once I decide on that executive order we pay the most of anybody in the world
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.200]  that's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed and now people are
[28:35.200 --> 28:40.320]  going to feel the sting and the pain the energy cost everything else but what's really illustrated
[28:40.320 --> 28:44.920]  this is the trial to the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting
[28:44.920 --> 28:50.120]  him down and saying he lost the election and just engage in all sorts of criminal activity
[28:50.120 --> 28:56.640]  because the fix is in folks the swamp is deep Trump fought it but it's up to us to win it
[28:56.640 --> 29:06.320]  as men age they often experience a slowdown in vitality energy and overall wellness and
[29:06.320 --> 29:14.040]  that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date super male vitality specifically
[29:14.040 --> 29:21.080]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[29:21.080 --> 29:28.120]  in males now look this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[29:28.120 --> 29:36.920]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives yes we're talking about ancient wisdom combined

[30:36.200 --> 30:43.440]  artist i think about such a very cold he comes to this country he runs around for decades
[30:43.440 --> 30:53.000]  posing as a immigrant from eastern europe and central asia and other places and he
[30:53.000 --> 30:58.560]  tries to decrade americans hardworking blue collar people particularly white folks and
[30:58.560 --> 31:03.480]  he goes and sings you know at two a.m. and a bar people are drunk and changes the lyrics
[31:03.480 --> 31:08.400]  at the very end once they've been singing with him for five minutes so the jewel down
[31:08.400 --> 31:15.400]  the well so my country can be saved so my company can be saved now those shows were
[31:15.400 --> 31:21.560]  successful america was still asleep back then but his latest shows have been total failures
[31:21.560 --> 31:26.160]  is his showtime program and like two hundred thousand viewers total joke that's nothing
[31:26.160 --> 31:32.360]  and then his movie was a big flop too and i did watch it and it's one time after another
[31:32.360 --> 31:36.840]  he tries to set somebody up politically oh because it's hollywood it's cute he tried
[31:36.840 --> 31:42.560]  to have sex with ron paul and ron paul thought him off that's not an attempted sexual assault
[31:42.560 --> 31:48.720]  by some pervert no that's just sasa baratco and it's so cute he's got free speech just
[31:48.720 --> 31:56.360]  thank god you're not him so get him off the screen he's hard to look at he's a predator
[31:56.360 --> 32:02.600]  he can't even hide the fact he's a predator he's a genetic psychopath folks so that most
[32:02.600 --> 32:07.920]  psychopaths are it's it's it's genetic traits and it's very sad that he just he just doesn't
[32:07.920 --> 32:13.120]  have a connection to god and so with him it's all about deception all about setting you up
[32:13.120 --> 32:16.720]  all about getting the kid in the back of the car all about tricking the woman in the car
[32:16.720 --> 32:20.640]  all about tricking somebody in the hotel room see the stuff that smart psychopaths though
[32:20.640 --> 32:24.560]  do it through vaccines like bill gates does they do it through poison drugs they do it
[32:24.560 --> 32:29.040]  through institutions so they get away with it but they still enjoy it just the same way
[32:29.040 --> 32:33.520]  as a retail psycho likes to kidnap your child out of the backyard of your wife and take
[32:33.520 --> 32:38.060]  him to a dungeon and torch her to live in hell out of them because they enjoy it so he went
[32:38.060 --> 32:44.440]  around in his movie to patriot events conservative events and then he would start saying anti
[32:44.440 --> 32:48.720]  somatic and racist stuff and they would throw him out he still edited it and said they didn't
[32:48.720 --> 32:56.480]  so he used to be sued for defamation and so he's mr. false flag that's what it is when
[32:56.480 --> 33:00.480]  you go to a bar on Friday night and people got their paycheck and they're drunk and you
[33:00.480 --> 33:07.760]  sing funny songs and then change the last chorus and the last lines to throw the Jew
[33:07.760 --> 33:13.120]  down the well and people are like what so you can demonize America because you're a racist
[33:13.120 --> 33:16.600]  that hates Christians you're a racist that hates America you're a racist that thinks
[33:16.600 --> 33:21.840]  you own this country you're a parasite so you wear your overalls and you get up there
[33:21.840 --> 33:33.120]  and you do all this because you're a predator and it's who you'll always be so like a clown
[33:33.120 --> 33:35.880]  you dress up like clowns you get the kids in the back of the car it's all I love funny
[33:35.880 --> 33:40.800]  clown that's all this I could do is a clown a few other faces but the real face of that
[33:40.800 --> 33:47.800]  photo they showed earlier we look like Brian Skelter where he looks like a frickin demon
[33:47.800 --> 33:54.240]  you'll float too oh yeah there's clowns there's everything down here so he says this we're
[33:54.240 --> 33:59.040]  gonna play the club yeah that's the real face right there he's like how do I oppress you
[33:59.040 --> 34:03.120]  how do I rip you off how do I spam you you deserve it I'm gonna get it over on you I'm
[34:03.120 --> 34:07.680]  gonna hurt you I'm the good guy though I'm the I'm the high and mighty you've got about

[34:13.200 --> 34:17.760]  way I live you got to use the words I say I control your speech I'm gonna arrest Mark
[34:17.760 --> 34:26.120]  Zuckerberg he called for his arrest call for my arrest to defend America the Pied Piper
[34:26.120 --> 34:34.560]  so just like Antifa dressed up as Trump supporters and broke in the Capitol to frame us and to
[34:34.560 --> 34:41.920]  get a few hundred Q idiots that actually thought Trump wanted this to follow in he's running
[34:41.920 --> 34:48.520]  false flags it's what Cohen does so here he is admitting that he released early the Giuliani
[34:48.520 --> 34:53.360]  footage to kill the Hunter Biden story with him saying I'm under control of Chinese intelligence
[34:53.360 --> 34:56.840]  people are missing people are dying I'm under criminal investigation Southern District of
[34:56.840 --> 35:04.440]  New York him naked with his niece pedophilia reportedly child porn all over it and here's
[35:04.440 --> 35:08.760]  Cohen to the rescue to cover that up so he's not just helping the time is Chinese he's
[35:08.760 --> 35:16.480]  helping cover up the pedophilia the child porn all of it and how's he do it with a young
[35:16.480 --> 35:24.560]  model tried to give Rudy Giuliani a massage trying to get all over him they studied their
[35:24.560 --> 35:28.760]  target they knew who he was and Juliana like okay I'm taking my mic off I'm laying back
[35:28.760 --> 35:34.000]  lady you want to want to do it do it consensual he's a lawyer puts his hands back he was trying
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.240]  to have sex with her oh but they don't have us conservatives are oh he's a devil now we're
[35:38.240 --> 35:43.240]  done with Giuliani because he's a well-known womanizer but it what a little kid was it
[35:43.240 --> 35:49.320]  no separately before she came in she said she was adult reporter outside Cohen said
[35:49.320 --> 35:53.880]  this is my daughter this is my little girl but she's too old to have sex with I only
[35:53.880 --> 35:58.440]  have sex with little kids he says at the movie who's remote pedophilia the whole time setting
[35:58.440 --> 36:02.760]  Giuliani up so you remember one minute before she's a little girl but she's not a little
[36:02.760 --> 36:09.360]  girl so he's about 30 so they can imply Giuliani's the pedophile because pet because because
[36:09.360 --> 36:16.960]  they're covering up for the pedophile laptop Jeffrey Epstein Weiner Biden Hunter all of
[36:16.960 --> 36:21.880]  it see how it works because he's not creative as a psychopath he just knows how to invert
[36:21.880 --> 36:27.800]  reality because he's better than you he's smarter than you he rules you now and if you
[36:27.800 --> 36:32.680]  let him he will hurt you so let's go ahead and let him tell you about how he covered
[36:32.680 --> 36:38.520]  up for the time his Chinese are the pedophiles you know what we did with Rudy was crucial
[36:38.520 --> 36:48.560]  I mean we made the movie to have an impact on the election the movie came out a couple
[36:48.560 --> 36:56.720]  of hours before the final presidential debate on that day Rudy Giuliani was in charge of
[36:56.720 --> 37:02.800]  undermining President Biden at that point he was not President Biden with this hard
[37:02.800 --> 37:11.600]  drive of material that was supposedly showing that Biden was part of a crime family so yes
[37:11.600 --> 37:18.640]  our movie came out on that day and instead of Rudy undermining the president the new
[37:18.640 --> 37:25.920]  president he was on on the back foot explaining why he had his hand down his pants so ethically
[37:25.920 --> 37:33.880]  oh I can stand by that all day long is the movie as a whole ethical yes you know we
[37:33.880 --> 37:42.960]  did it because there was a deeply unethical government in in power and there was no question
[37:42.960 --> 37:51.560]  as to we had to do what we could to inspire people to vote and remind people of the immorality
[37:51.560 --> 37:56.680]  of the government prior to the election the immorality so she's all dressed up like a
[37:56.680 --> 38:00.840]  30-something hot lady put her hands all over him said let me give you a massage but before
[38:00.840 --> 38:04.720]  he walks a minute he says she's a little girl so the audience is dumb he thinks and
[38:04.720 --> 38:10.960]  goes oh that's a little girl these people are sick ladies and gentlemen and I'm not
[38:10.960 --> 38:17.280]  even defending what Giuliani did but he's red-blooded and that's why he's a fighter
[38:17.280 --> 38:22.680]  but that doesn't even matter again here's Cohen admitting that oh he's moral and Trump's
[38:22.680 --> 38:27.800]  immoral he wanted to expose the immorality of this administration he's so good he's
[38:27.800 --> 38:33.280]  so high and mighty and then in the middle Cohen runs in dressed as a transvestite to
[38:33.280 --> 38:38.120]  make the whole scene even more bizarre because at that point Giuliani wasn't gonna have sex
[38:38.120 --> 38:43.400]  whether he was brushing her off he didn't take the bait he almost did and that's how
[38:43.400 --> 38:48.200]  these people operate a spy against America an enemy of our free speech saying get rid
[38:48.200 --> 38:52.760]  of our speech our most cherished right once our guns to while he's the big Hollywood defender
[38:52.760 --> 38:58.360]  of speech and uses speech to carry out criminal operations we're gonna come back to the next
[38:58.360 --> 39:02.720]  hour and I'm gonna play hell let's just go to it now we have a here's the Capitol a police
[39:02.720 --> 39:08.960]  chief talking about Antifa a clear lack of accurate and complete intelligence across several
[39:08.960 --> 39:12.800]  federal agencies contributed to this event and not poor planning by the United States
[39:12.800 --> 39:18.280]  Capitol police we rely on accurate information from our federal partners to help us develop
[39:18.280 --> 39:23.760]  effective security plans the intelligence that we based our planning on indicated that
[39:23.760 --> 39:29.240]  the January 6 protest were expected to be similar to the previous MAGA rallies in 2020
[39:29.240 --> 39:34.160]  which drew tens of thousands of participants the assessment indicated that members of the
[39:34.160 --> 39:40.200]  proud boys white supremacist groups and Tifa and other extremist groups were expected to
[39:40.200 --> 39:45.480]  participate on January 6 and that they may be inclined to become violent based on the
[39:45.480 --> 39:50.200]  intelligence I received we plan for an increased level of violence at the Capitol and that
[39:50.200 --> 39:55.400]  will be right back with a full clip stay with us our number two straight ahead ladies and

[40:59.960 --> 41:04.880]  of the two one is born of Renaissance the other is born of conquest one bases its power
[41:04.880 --> 41:10.920]  on having strong enlightened focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity
[41:10.920 --> 41:17.080]  art and skill and strength the other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls
[41:17.080 --> 41:23.320]  with a tiny elite above it America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty
[41:23.320 --> 41:28.720]  and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery that's why the globalists tell us
[41:28.720 --> 41:33.240]  America was founded on slavery when it wasn't they point out one of our evils so they can
[41:33.240 --> 41:38.240]  invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters a global permanent lockdown is here
[41:38.240 --> 41:42.000]  is already causing millions and millions to starve to death when they're done billions
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.040]  will starve to death even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a
[41:46.040 --> 41:50.560]  top general have come out and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world
[41:50.560 --> 41:57.920]  war that's the fact this is the Bill Gates new world order weapon finally we're seeing

[43:06.760 --> 43:12.360]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will
[43:12.360 --> 43:18.480]  being given free will being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe
[43:18.480 --> 43:23.320]  an entire system and the fact that you're able to commune with God the fact you're
[43:23.320 --> 43:27.840]  able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty
[43:27.840 --> 43:33.000]  of your wife your husband the beauty of your child learning knowledge the beauty of music
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.960]  the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself
[43:37.960 --> 43:44.320]  is what God teaches us is worship so don't worship the globalist don't worship the NFL
[43:44.320 --> 43:48.600]  don't worship all the things of the system but worship the things of God because we're
[43:48.600 --> 43:53.320]  made by God and appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still
[43:53.320 --> 44:20.880]  have it while you still have it you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:20.880 --> 44:29.280]  good evening welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight we take a lot of digs at the media on this
[44:29.280 --> 44:34.600]  show and we do it for two reasons it's fun and they deserve it recently we've watched
[44:34.600 --> 44:40.320]  with growing amusement as our media gatekeepers thrash around in a frenzy of foaming hysteria
[44:40.320 --> 44:45.040]  over the possibility that someone somewhere might dare to present facts or form opinions
[44:45.040 --> 44:50.280]  without their express written permission freelance thinking is what they hate most it's a threat
[44:50.280 --> 44:55.720]  to their monopoly they can't say that out loud so instead they call it disinformation
[44:55.720 --> 45:00.240]  disinformation is the real threat says the guy who thinks his union has the contract
[45:00.240 --> 45:04.880]  on bringing you the news it's ridiculous but before you judge these people take a moment
[45:04.880 --> 45:09.640]  and feel some compassion consider how they might be feeling right about now imagine if
[45:09.640 --> 45:15.000]  you had spent 30 years making a good living as a car mechanic and all of a sudden GM invents
[45:15.000 --> 45:19.920]  an engine that anyone can fix at home with a screwdriver you'd be upset that's how
[45:19.920 --> 45:25.520]  CNN feels about the internet it's exposing their scam naturally they're a little irrational
[45:25.520 --> 45:31.760]  about it millions of Americans clinging to conspiracy theories this is all evidence
[45:31.760 --> 45:40.960]  of radicalization and that's not easy to say it's not an easy word to use but it's way
[45:40.960 --> 45:46.640]  past time to talk about this honestly no one should tip toe past this predicament disinformation
[45:46.640 --> 45:55.480]  networks like QAnon are causing people to lose touch with reality disinformation networks
[45:55.480 --> 46:00.960]  that doesn't sound like a misleading social media post it sounds like a terror cell and
[46:00.960 --> 46:05.160]  it sounds that way on purpose the thing about disinformation they're telling us is that
[46:05.160 --> 46:08.960]  it's not simply harmful to you personally it's not like eating a pint of Ben and Jerry's
[46:08.960 --> 46:13.720]  or sneaking a smoke while the kids are at school no disinformation isn't a sin it's
[46:13.720 --> 46:19.840]  a crime disinformation hurts everyone it's an offense against this country disinformation
[46:19.840 --> 46:25.320]  is an attack on America and not just on America but more critically on something called our
[46:25.320 --> 46:32.440]  norms our norms are so out of whack that it has become surprising when good things happen
[46:32.440 --> 46:38.120]  even after four years of us talking you know night after night about the norms that are
[46:38.120 --> 46:43.700]  being shattered he is doing everything to shred every one of these norms we can't
[46:43.700 --> 46:47.640]  not allow these kind of democratic norms to be shattered so we've abided by these norms
[46:47.640 --> 46:51.440]  but this president is just real we're in this administration just blown right through those
[46:51.440 --> 46:58.760]  norms now since the Red Scare have once good men and women been dragged into this kind
[46:58.760 --> 47:07.360]  of sabotage of our democracy and social norms our norms shattered shredded crushed destroyed
[47:07.360 --> 47:13.360]  blown through why is it always our norms that are the first to be attacked maybe because
[47:13.360 --> 47:18.320]  our norms are democracy's first responders they run to the sound of gunfire norms are
[47:18.320 --> 47:22.720]  like the young lieutenants in Vietnam walking point to the rice paddies exposing themselves
[47:22.720 --> 47:27.120]  to fire in order to save the platoon it's a dangerous job being a norm and never more
[47:27.120 --> 47:31.800]  so than now you thought underwater welding was a treacherous gig you feared for the guys
[47:31.800 --> 47:37.920]  who fixed antennas on skyscrapers that's nothing imagine being a norm in today's America they
[47:37.920 --> 47:43.560]  don't last long okay we'll stop it's all pretty amusing it's hard to resist our norms our
[47:43.560 --> 47:46.680]  norms on the other hand if we're being completely honest here and we strive to be completely
[47:46.680 --> 47:51.360]  honest we have to admit there is a kernel of truth in what they're yelling about there
[47:51.360 --> 47:56.600]  is disinformation out there and it does hurt people makes people stupid for one thing but
[47:56.600 --> 48:00.960]  it also impairs their ability to make wise decisions you can't know what to do next if
[48:00.960 --> 48:04.920]  you don't know what's really going on a lot of people in this country in that position
[48:04.920 --> 48:10.480]  right now we saw evidence of it just this week we read a research paper called how informed
[48:10.480 --> 48:16.120]  are americans about race and policing it was published by the skeptic research center check
[48:16.120 --> 48:20.120]  it out online if you have a minute it's a pretty amazing document the researchers asked people
[48:20.120 --> 48:25.480]  to estimate the number of unarmed african-americans who were killed by the police in 2019 here
[48:25.480 --> 48:31.400]  the results 44% of americans who describe themselves as the liberal believe the total
[48:31.400 --> 48:38.000]  number of killed was quote a thousand or more more than a thousand unarmed african-americans
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.800]  gunned down by cops is that true well as it happened we have definitive statistics on
[48:42.800 --> 48:46.800]  this they're publicly available you could find them in about a minute the actual number
[48:46.800 --> 48:54.080]  of unarmed african-americans killed by the police in 2019 was 27 so more than a thousand
[48:54.080 --> 49:00.440]  versus the reality of 27 quite a spread and it was not an anomaly the rest of the study
[49:00.440 --> 49:05.360]  found similar results self-described liberals for example believe that a strong majority
[49:05.360 --> 49:11.320]  of people killed by police in 2019 were african-americans the actual percentage was less than half
[49:11.320 --> 49:18.160]  that closer to 25% these are not small mistakes a lot of americans are completely and utterly
[49:18.160 --> 49:27.040]  misinformed and that has actual consequences knocking out of the park again but when we
[49:27.040 --> 49:30.840]  would try to put out those crime statistics we were banned that they would say it's disinfo
[49:30.840 --> 49:38.960]  to show an FBI statistic that in the year 2018 14 black men were killed by police in
[49:38.960 --> 49:43.920]  wrongful shootings and the total number was like 20 something overall okay let's say
[49:43.920 --> 49:50.200]  they were all wrong it's like the rarest way to die if you're a black man as a police
[49:50.200 --> 49:53.040]  does that mean there aren't some racist cops does that mean sometimes you don't get driving
[49:53.040 --> 49:57.600]  while black absolutely you get driving while white in the wrong neighborhood i was growing
[49:57.600 --> 50:01.400]  up in dallas and i the only place you get beer was the black neighborhood the cops would
[50:01.400 --> 50:05.400]  pull me over and go what are you doing over here buying beer aren't you couple times they
[50:05.400 --> 50:09.160]  took it away and dumped it out that was back when the cops were a lot nicer maybe it was
[50:09.160 --> 50:14.040]  black got it going to jail i don't know the point is is the rarest way for a black person
[50:14.040 --> 50:19.840]  to die is from a cop but the very global is taking the health care away and and and destroying
[50:19.840 --> 50:23.880]  the country and bringing all the fentanyl in that's killing millions of people oh and
[50:23.880 --> 50:27.840]  the mass of suicide among black males and white males the highest groups kill themselves
[50:27.840 --> 50:34.920]  that's all not a problem but the reason i played that tucker piece was because he has
[50:34.920 --> 50:41.200]  the best analogies and by the way he doesn't need the help of any writers but but that
[50:41.200 --> 50:55.920]  tuckers really smart and that's the best analogy i've ever seen is seeing in cannot compete
[50:55.920 --> 51:01.880]  with the fact that the internet has distributed the means of production to everybody so everybody
[51:01.880 --> 51:10.520]  can have a voice so no matter how many people they remove off of the air or off the internet
[51:10.520 --> 51:16.840]  more will just fill their place because there's a vacuum there and no one wants to see CNN
[51:16.840 --> 51:21.280]  CNN's top shows have a half million viewers and they're force fed into cable systems and
[51:21.280 --> 51:29.640]  TV systems and hotels and bus stops and train stops and airports and in public school across
[51:29.640 --> 51:35.560]  the country in first and second period putting on the school they make you watch 15 minutes
[51:35.560 --> 51:41.560]  of CNN when i was a junior in high school they said oh we got a grant from CNN and the federal
[51:41.560 --> 51:48.720]  government and every classroom got a television and cable and you had to watch CNN propaganda
[51:48.720 --> 51:54.240]  and by the way the CNN propaganda they were showing me how many years ago that was i got
[51:54.240 --> 52:01.600]  a high school let me see i was 17 18 man i'm 47 now that was a long time ago it was a lot
[52:01.600 --> 52:07.400]  like what you see on the news now because they weren't on CNN outright in 1992 saying white
[52:07.400 --> 52:12.480]  people are inherently evil and america is bad but when i was going to anderson high school
[52:12.480 --> 52:17.200]  in north austin you know a couple years in dallas couple years here they would literally
[52:17.200 --> 52:27.360]  show you 15 minutes of basically marx's linenist crap and so they don't know what to do because
[52:27.360 --> 52:31.320]  no one wants to watch them and they sit there and ring their hands and they go you know
[52:31.320 --> 52:35.400]  there's all these radicals and they believe in disinfo and blah blah blah meanwhile the
[52:35.400 --> 52:41.440]  new york times had an article out we covered a few days ago saying do not engage in critical
[52:41.440 --> 52:47.160]  thinking do not research what people claim unless it's the new york times and then they
[52:47.160 --> 52:54.640]  link to a list of recommended trustworthy news do you imagine if you told your wife
[52:54.640 --> 52:58.440]  honey don't talk to any friends don't read your newspapers don't go outside you just
[52:58.440 --> 53:04.760]  stay here and only listen to me she'd say i'm out of here or if your wife tried that
[53:04.760 --> 53:11.560]  or with your children or anybody it's called a cult of authoritarians and they know they've
[53:11.560 --> 53:16.840]  lost the public they know the world to moved on and so they're now labeling us like when
[53:16.840 --> 53:21.120]  your wife leaves you's walking out the door your husband oh you're a nazi because i broke
[53:21.120 --> 53:27.800]  your nose or you're a nazi because i was cheating on you or you're a terrorist they're packing
[53:27.800 --> 53:31.720]  the car up they're packing the station wagon up i'm out of here leave me alone they're
[53:31.720 --> 53:36.440]  like shut up you're evil you're bad come back to me come back to me you've got to stay with
[53:36.440 --> 53:41.560]  me only listen to me in fact come back in the house i'll tie you up in the basement so
[53:41.560 --> 53:45.720]  you can't ever go away i mean they've now hit that and now they're like we need to put
[53:45.720 --> 53:50.920]  tens of millions of people in reeducation camps we need to train the public to submit
[53:50.920 --> 53:55.640]  to us we need to make them come back we need to we need to have general honorary in the
[53:55.640 --> 53:59.880]  military get them but we can't trust the military either why they're even they're even more white
[53:59.880 --> 54:09.400]  supremacist it's a joke and you get around these neurotic crazy leftist cia fbi all of them they're
[54:09.400 --> 54:15.080]  in their own weird little bubbles and then they think we're all in a bubble and they all think
[54:15.080 --> 54:19.240]  threatening us that coming after us is going to make us back down it's not so it's a very
[54:19.240 --> 54:23.160]  explosive situation we'll cover it all the next hour we have the gentleman that went through
[54:23.160 --> 54:28.120]  canadian customs and said i'm not doing your pcr fraudulent test that went viral mr sky's

[55:48.680 --> 55:55.880]  and as depressing as things can be you have to understand that this is all a test this experience
[55:55.880 --> 56:03.880]  this life on this planet is a reckoning it's god giving us a chance to work things out with third
[56:03.880 --> 56:09.640]  dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it
[56:09.640 --> 56:14.840]  really does come down to that so as sad as things are and as evil as things are look at all the good
[56:14.840 --> 56:20.600]  in the world as well and realize that god is the author of our consciousness god is the author of
[56:20.600 --> 56:28.360]  us having our own will god is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful
[56:28.360 --> 56:33.480]  thing when you look at mainstream media in hollywood and this whole evil culture in washington bc
[56:33.480 --> 56:39.480]  and fauci and the and the mass cult it's all about dominating a free will it's all about telling you
[56:39.480 --> 56:43.720]  you're dirty you're ugly you're in a bad because satan hates you because you're made in the image
[56:43.720 --> 57:10.680]  of god the creator of the universe you're listening to the alex jones show
[57:10.680 --> 57:18.120]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide and we have the gentleman that went in through the customs
[57:18.120 --> 57:23.400]  of canada and said i'm not doing this i'm not complying with your fraud ten things that happened
[57:23.400 --> 57:27.480]  in the uk so they're trying to talk about jail time but the courts are ending up throwing this
[57:27.480 --> 57:34.280]  out so it's all color law christ sky joins us next segment that steve quill then john rapaport
[57:34.280 --> 57:43.000]  but the big takeaway my friends is that populism is rising across the world i don't care if it comes
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.760]  in the form of balsam arrow or it comes in the form of trump both of which were the real deal
[57:46.760 --> 57:52.520]  and and and been the best job they can boris johnson a trader posing as a populist but then
[57:52.520 --> 57:59.080]  you've got somebody like the prime minister of canada just in trudeau and he says i love comic
[57:59.080 --> 58:04.440]  china and dictatorship and then people go wow this is like a dictatorship i saw a headline one of the
[58:04.440 --> 58:09.720]  crew did putting out that namie wolf interview yesterday and it's like oh namie wolf warrants
[58:09.720 --> 58:16.120]  tearing around the corner no it's sitting in your lap so i changed the headline it's sitting in your
[58:16.120 --> 58:21.560]  lap and it's a corrupt ruling class that is totally authoritarian that is willing to do anything
[58:21.560 --> 58:26.280]  at any time to anybody to maintain that power and so many people play along with it and go along
[58:26.280 --> 58:30.680]  with the structure thinking that oh they'll they'll protect themselves doing it no you're
[58:30.680 --> 58:36.040]  destroying your protection and it's like a it's like if you ever watched a dam collapse usually it
[58:36.040 --> 58:40.520]  springs a small leak and then that undermines the dam and then the dam will be able to say hey
[58:40.520 --> 58:43.880]  we've got a leak we've got a problem they'll try to fix it then they'll say hey we think the dam
[58:43.880 --> 58:48.040]  might fail in the next few weeks we were unable to fix it because the integrity was breached
[58:48.040 --> 58:52.280]  and then you see a larger area break open and a couple days later this the whole thing suddenly
[58:52.280 --> 58:57.640]  collapses so at first it's just leaks down in the foundation and they try to fix it then it's
[58:57.640 --> 59:01.720]  starts seeing some water coming through down at the bottom and then as soon as holes start
[59:01.720 --> 59:06.600]  blowing through it and the water starts moving quick it may have taken a month for it to get
[59:06.600 --> 59:12.040]  to that point then the whole dam goes in five minutes and with that's the point we've reached
[59:12.040 --> 59:17.800]  with tyranny with all these people pretending hey let's have a civil war and put 80 million
[59:17.800 --> 59:24.840]  trump supporters in camps hey uh you know let's arrest mark zuckerberg says cohen sasha barack
[59:24.840 --> 59:30.200]  cohen he won't do what i say hey who would want to live in a world like that where they just arrest
[59:30.200 --> 59:36.520]  whoever sasha barack cohen wants there's an old funny meme they got millions of views on twitter
[59:36.520 --> 59:41.240]  probably five years old you got the gay chemicals the frogs and all i was doing was reading a study
[59:41.240 --> 59:45.640]  out of berkeley about the frogs becoming sterile and being attracted to their male frogs and funny
[59:45.640 --> 59:50.280]  enough that was in the new york times what's happening the sperm this weekend was their cover
[59:50.280 --> 59:57.000]  story of oh it's not just us becoming infertile it's other animals could it be could it be satan
[59:57.000 --> 1:00:04.840]  no it's atrazine so it's all coming up maybe we should play the old geronimo frost frog piece
[1:00:05.640 --> 1:00:09.000]  for you because the only place you find our videos the only place you're allowed to see them now is
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  banned on video and yeah people are like wow this is one of the only independent
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:16.760]  video sites where you get you know a lot of videos get a million views a ton of videos
[1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:22.600]  get 200 300 000 most videos get about 30 000 views well i don't care about the views because we only
[1:00:22.600 --> 1:00:27.000]  have our own advertising on there i have to pay with the bandwidth i care about fighting back
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:33.080]  and waking people up so all i care about is how many people we reach and so i've got to ask stupid
[1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:37.560]  dress up as a gay frog because the left will let me make fun of myself so when i did that that was
[1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:42.360]  allowed to go on twitter you got millions of views but it educated people they're like hey i'm
[1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:47.560]  actually going to filter my water so if i dress up in a tutu and to hop around as a gay frog i will
[1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:55.640]  do that i will do a lot of things to fight these people because i am legitimately concerned it's
[1:00:55.640 --> 1:01:03.160]  welcome to lily pad lane here i come so there you go and and and you know and if i do silly stuff
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:08.200]  they let it get on the internet they decide they are the overlords they decide you know they don't
[1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:12.920]  want me showing you this new lands it study that came out two days ago from the journal of lands
[1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:17.560]  this is not like someone publish it this is this is lands it put this out saying PCR tests are
[1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:24.360]  totally fake and do not work and are a fraud i mean the whole basis but all these world leaders
[1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:29.080]  are saying hey you don't get on a train a plane without the PCR tested we're gonna lock you up

[1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:26.520]  it's alex jones yeah we cut that from a few years ago i thought we turned the time but i'm gonna have
[1:03:26.520 --> 1:03:32.200]  to say that we have been uh the state is in contention about to be under global is controlled
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:38.520]  yet again because they've got the governor on their side thank you for joining us in our number
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:44.760]  two christ sky made international headlines last few days as a video went viral of him challenging
[1:03:44.760 --> 1:03:52.120]  the covid pcr fraud police at the canadian border and trying to violate his rights
[1:03:52.680 --> 1:03:57.000]  we'll be talking to him here in just a moment but let's take some time now to look at these
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:02.840]  headlines and these are just pouring in france considers slowing vaccine rollout for hospital
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:11.320]  staff with many unable to work following the jab some dying many getting very very sick
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:18.840]  and live site news links to a bunch of mainstream reports out of france breaking that down but
[1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:23.560]  but here's the issue they skipped animal trials experts that looked at it said it will really
[1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:27.560]  hurt you down the road and they're having the worst adverse reactions of any vaccine ever
[1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:31.880]  and bill gates told you last year it's going to really hurt you bad because they'd actually
[1:04:31.880 --> 1:04:36.760]  done a secret test on animals under the guise of the other quote you know covid vaccines for
[1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:42.520]  animals so this is a big deal folks you got all these old people dying taking it it's it's just

[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:51.480]  they were going to give it to everybody but somebody old folks died a month and a half ago
[1:04:51.480 --> 1:04:56.360]  the british government said okay back off but now they're just going to do it with the parents

[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:21.800]  lockdown oh see it's always another lockdown for non-essential businesses as the big businesses
[1:05:22.360 --> 1:05:27.800]  take over the economy this is siege and we told you this was coming i saw this article on info wars
[1:05:27.800 --> 1:05:34.600]  and uh but i like michael snider but i almost took it down because you know i i michael has
[1:05:34.600 --> 1:05:39.560]  these articles a year ago and then now that you know this is deadly and it's a horrible virus and
[1:05:40.120 --> 1:05:47.000]  well they they always say it in europe and all over oh we got a lockdown again a new strain
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:51.800]  a new super deadly one oh this doctor saw it this doctor thinks so it's the same system telling
[1:05:51.800 --> 1:05:55.720]  his pc r test work when they don't the same system saying four percent of the public would die
[1:05:55.720 --> 1:06:00.760]  it's the same system that lied to us about what's happening in the nursing homes
[1:06:02.600 --> 1:06:08.120]  it pays to ship actual covid patients in to actually kill old people so they get some death
[1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:15.480]  numbers so a new highly resistant covid variant has emerged in california and it could make the
[1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:20.920]  black far worse just when it seemed like covid pandemic may be subsiding a new covid strain
[1:06:20.920 --> 1:06:26.680]  has emerged in california that has the potential to change everything you see very similar articles
[1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:31.080]  all over the press see it ends very breathless as well according to test conducted by dr charles
[1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:37.160]  chewie and his team this new strain appears to result in more severe illness and it also appears
[1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:44.200]  to result in more people dying from the virus now this could be true the bogey made of cheese as
[1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:49.880]  well but to be serious i said a year ago they would use this as a simulant for the lockdown and
[1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:54.200]  that we went along with it they released out of wuhan they have more deadly viruses in the same
[1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:58.920]  family they could release to really keep us under their control so who knows you never know but the
[1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:04.680]  last so-called super deadly strains and all this were bs most people don't have enough vitamin d3
[1:07:04.680 --> 1:07:08.520]  but uh so nothing against niner saying that i just don't i just don't agree with him and
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:13.160]  i just think these people cried wolf so much that i don't buy into it the other is the devil's

[1:15:56.520 --> 1:16:01.320]  on the line but just like alphi oaks down in naples saying you don't wear mask in the store
[1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:05.960]  and everybody loves it well he's out there fighting as well but i gotta tell you the canadian police
[1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:10.520]  are very subservient to the tyranny they've been violating people's rights so here to lay it out for
[1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:15.480]  us the model of the future because what's happening in canada is coming here folks it's already here
[1:16:15.480 --> 1:16:20.520]  christ sky we salute you back to work dot biz you guys are still under lockdown thank you so much for
[1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:27.320]  coming on thank you for having me man been watching you for a very very long time well brother you're
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:30.920]  doing more than i'm doing it comes to getting on the front lines tell us why you did it when you
[1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:36.520]  did it the aftermath that just you've got the floor okay well everybody knows that i've been
[1:16:36.520 --> 1:16:41.080]  probably one of the main lockdown speakers not just in canada but all around the world i've
[1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:46.680]  been speaking about it since last march i've been all over like i said it was in ireland in
[1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:53.240]  september when i came back from ireland i did a uh i did a speech september 26 i went to ireland
[1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:57.400]  and i warned everybody that instead of opening them on september 20th they were going to lock
[1:16:57.400 --> 1:17:02.280]  them down they were going to introduce the five-tier level lockdown and i tried to warn the irish
[1:17:02.280 --> 1:17:06.680]  population and i even stayed there till the 20th of september when they got locked down and then i
[1:17:06.680 --> 1:17:13.000]  came back home uh when i came back home i was on quarantine i don't believe in quarantine if you're
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:17.480]  not sick quarantines for sick people not healthy people so i was planning on going to the protest
[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:22.440]  oh here's the clip right here this is made on september 26 uh six days after i got back from
[1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:27.560]  ireland i was on we're gonna play that next segment but but but tell folks how you knew you got the
[1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:33.160]  document through the canadian government of the un that later was confirmed yes like it wasn't even
[1:17:33.160 --> 1:17:37.480]  just a canadian document it was basically a worldwide document and they they gave a little
[1:17:37.480 --> 1:17:41.080]  bit of leeway to all the different countries on how to implement and then how to sell it to the
[1:17:41.080 --> 1:17:46.440]  people but one thing was clear there's five levels of lockdown level five was basically the australia
[1:17:46.440 --> 1:17:50.360]  style where you're not allowed to go 500 meters from your house and they have total of complete
[1:17:50.360 --> 1:17:55.320]  control over you checkpoints all the rest of it level one you're still on a lockdown you're still
[1:17:55.320 --> 1:18:00.520]  forced to wear a mask the idea that we're going to be getting the masks off anytime soon is ridiculous
[1:18:00.520 --> 1:18:04.120]  they plan on keeping the mask on people for years because that's how they're going to
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:09.240]  perpetuate the compliance perpetuate the idea that there's something to be afraid of etc so
[1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:13.080]  it was easy to say and i told the people in ireland that was going to happen and it happened and i
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:19.960]  came back to canada and on september 26 i went to the protest and i did my speech there knowing
[1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:23.320]  that i was violating quarantine knowing i was going to at least get ticketed and i didn't get
[1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:27.720]  ticketed but it wasn't a big deal and i told everybody exactly what was going to happen then
[1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:31.480]  i said they're going to bring us on a lockdown by the end of the year we're going to be completely
[1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:34.920]  locked down they're going to try to cancel christmas on us they're going to try to cancel the
[1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:39.800]  santa claus parade which is the biggest event we have in all of canada and i said after christmas
[1:18:39.800 --> 1:18:44.200]  once they got you locked down once we're in the canadian winter and it's really cold then they're
[1:18:44.200 --> 1:18:48.760]  really going to put the screws to you they're going to start tightening travel restrictions
[1:18:48.760 --> 1:18:55.080]  etc etc but the most important thing that everybody has to realize is in canada and the united states
[1:18:55.080 --> 1:19:00.040]  we have something called rights rights are like a secret superpower that every citizen has but
[1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:03.320]  you have to exercise them or they go away and i want you to spend the whole segment on that but
[1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:08.360]  let's let's let's get back to this document that first broke in canada i guess yeah back
[1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:13.480]  six eight months ago and then we later i searched it to see if it was real and we found the un
[1:19:13.480 --> 1:19:18.280]  original document that was just changed a little bit for each country they denied it at the time
[1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:22.440]  but now it's all admitted and it's not like you go into level one level two level three you go to
[1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:26.760]  level one level two back to level one then level four then back to level two then level five then
[1:19:26.760 --> 1:19:31.800]  you're never out of total martial law locked in your house contact tracers forced inoculations
[1:19:31.800 --> 1:19:37.480]  anywhere you go total permanent tyranny this so this is literally the frog in the pot as they
[1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:43.080]  raise the temperature yes it starts with the mass the mass of the foundation of all the other
[1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:47.080]  restrictions that's why when you hear people say oh it's just a mask or any other propaganda that
[1:19:47.080 --> 1:19:51.480]  they repeat from the tv it's absolutely ridiculous because without the mask there would be no contact
[1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:55.160]  tracing without the contact tracing there'd be no force testing without the force testing there'd
[1:19:55.160 --> 1:19:59.080]  be no force quarantine without the force quarantine there'd be no travel restrictions or any other
[1:19:59.080 --> 1:20:04.760]  restrictions then we have the businesses part of this whole framework is like you said this is all
[1:20:04.760 --> 1:20:09.400]  about globalization this is all about consolidating the governments of the world into one type of
[1:20:09.400 --> 1:20:13.480]  superpower if you will and the number one thing they got to get rid of is small business because
[1:20:13.480 --> 1:20:18.040]  small business is independence so that's why I created back to work the nonprofit because at
[1:20:18.040 --> 1:20:21.960]  the beginning of this it was quite clear that the target of this is small business they're going
[1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:28.520]  broke while amazon on a big business and making record profits so the idea that you have to comply
[1:20:28.520 --> 1:20:33.320]  to get out of this is the complete absurdity the more you comply the more restrictions they put
[1:20:33.320 --> 1:20:38.040]  on you the longer they keep extending everything it was two weeks almost 52 weeks ago and people
[1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:42.680]  are still complying still saying they'll do whatever it takes whatever the government tells them i
[1:20:42.680 --> 1:20:46.520]  don't know how many times people need to be lied to or how many times people need to be told the
[1:20:46.520 --> 1:20:51.000]  government is not your friend they're here to control by the time they hit level five they're
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:55.240]  going to say it's the few dissenters that don't go along with us we've got to put them in jail
[1:20:55.240 --> 1:20:59.960]  permanently then you'll actually get out but then nobody ever gets out mission complete planetary
[1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:04.600]  dictatorship well they already got me on conditions because they've arrested me so many times this
[1:21:04.600 --> 1:21:09.960]  year i was arrested i was arrested going to the east coast just to go speak i got arrested on an
[1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:15.400]  airplane by the the rcmp which is the equivalent of the canadian fbi they made up some completely
[1:21:15.400 --> 1:21:20.200]  false charges just so they could basically kidnap me off the airplane and prevent me from speaking
[1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:25.480]  in new brunswick and halifax two separate cities on two separate days thankfully i got out and they
[1:21:25.480 --> 1:21:32.120]  were forced to let me go back to toronto which i did and then uh when i was in toronto uh january
[1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:38.040]  23rd they started they they issued an emergency order a new emergency order that prohibited our
[1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:42.200]  right to assembly so now anybody that was at a protest that we had been doing for months and
[1:21:42.200 --> 1:21:46.360]  months and months with the complete support of the toronto police anybody that spoke at a protest
[1:21:46.360 --> 1:21:50.920]  got arrested people like tally and wolf have been arrested three times lamont daigle's been arrested
[1:21:50.920 --> 1:21:55.800]  a couple times so i told everybody don't do a protest if you go to the protest you're gonna
[1:21:55.800 --> 1:22:00.520]  get a grab you're gonna get arrested i go you know what you can do everybody can go for a walk
[1:22:00.520 --> 1:22:04.600]  because we're downtown toronto we're in the nicest places so we had thousands and thousands of people
[1:22:04.600 --> 1:22:10.360]  walking we're in the heart of downtown toronto high class area none of us were wearing masks
[1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:16.280]  i told everybody let's go shopping everybody go in the stores masks free as which is your right
[1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:19.880]  you can claim your medical exemption everybody has the right to an exemption they're not allowed to
[1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:23.800]  ask you what your condition is they're not allowed to ask you for a doctor's note they're not allowed
[1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:28.520]  to ask you to approve your condition and above all they're not allowed to deny you service so we
[1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:32.520]  went into multiple stores we started with i believe shoppers drug mart they didn't give us a problem
[1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:37.240]  at all we had about 30 40 people in there mass free we didn't want to go crazy over capacity or
[1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:41.800]  anything like that to scare people everyone went in their shop so we weren't trespassing we weren't
[1:22:41.800 --> 1:22:46.680]  breaking any laws and we just marched down young street in bluer area and went into a whole bunch
[1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:51.320]  of different stores every store we went to they called a whole bunch of police there you saw patty
[1:22:51.320 --> 1:22:54.840]  wagons yourself police trying to intimidate people trying to tell people to leave the store
[1:22:54.840 --> 1:23:00.520]  you know what you didn't see not one bylaw officer and the whole thing with math is a bylaw and why
[1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:04.760]  didn't they have a bylaw officer there because of a bylaw officer was there we had the law printed
[1:23:04.760 --> 1:23:09.000]  out i would have read it out loud to them the bylaw officer would have agreed that everything we
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:13.800]  were doing is perfectly legal and no store can deny anybody without wearing and that is the key
[1:23:13.800 --> 1:23:18.840]  that is the key because this is all done color of law there's just steamrolling us until it all gets
[1:23:18.840 --> 1:23:23.080]  accepted and what you're seeing right there on the screen that you just saw the people walking
[1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:29.000]  down that steps that was the day they made mass mandatory in toronto and that was all of me taking
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:33.720]  a whole bunch of men women and children about a hundred of us to the ttc which is the subway
[1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:38.600]  where mass was supposedly mandatory and we brought all those people on their mastery everybody
[1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:42.760]  claimed an exemption they had to let you give me faith in humanity stay there we're going to play
[1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:47.800]  the clip of you going to ironland giving you the exact day months before they'd be locked down
[1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:50.840]  showing that the u n is in global control incredible we'll be right back
[1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:58.760]  in the early 1990s it was a really funny movie that came out called wanes world
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:07.960]  even before i had access to these shows in the mid 1990s i wouldn't call that movie and thought man
[1:24:07.960 --> 1:24:13.160]  that looks fun in fact you speak out have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd you're still
[1:24:13.160 --> 1:24:19.400]  entertaining because you're real well what do they say in wanes world we're not worthy we're not
[1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:24.760]  worthy every day when i cover these huge topics i don't feel worthy to talk to you because these
[1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:28.840]  topics are so huge are so real but i'm trying to tell you the truth i'm trying to get it right and

[1:27:26.360 --> 1:27:33.560]  i tell you chris sky gives me hope he's smart he's dynamic he's on target he's a leader that's what
[1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:38.600]  we need more of i'm very honored to have him very honored to learn he's a listener i've seen
[1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:43.240]  his work quite a bit uh but i didn't know that he was a listener and i'm and i'm very thankful
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:47.960]  that our producers were able to get him on quickly uh but boy this is just crazy people
[1:27:47.960 --> 1:27:53.800]  don't understand this is premeditated and that's how he could go to ireland and say on this exact
[1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:59.480]  date months from now they'll intensify the lockdown not remove it as they promised to do because he
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:07.480]  had the un document he had the formulae next segment listeners uh pointed this out we found a
[1:28:07.480 --> 1:28:13.080]  document from 11 years ago when lockstep came out 2010 where i said they're going to lock down the
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:20.200]  borders make you wear masks have checkpoints force inoculations to travel now no one cares
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:24.680]  when i read lockstep 11 years later it's like oh well so what but to see the younger alex jones
[1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:29.480]  and see people think it's like magic like like how does chris sky know the exact day
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:33.880]  because the irish now listen to him i've seen the articles are like because it's like superstition
[1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:37.560]  don't care if you're american irish we're all the same be african whatever it's like it's like
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:43.080]  people think you're magic then like whoa how do you know that because it's a damn premeditated
[1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:49.000]  operation and so everything he's saying is is absolutely on target so chris i interrupted you
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:53.640]  earlier because i wanted you to get into what currently happened before we got into your rights
[1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:57.000]  people knowing their rights and we even have more rights here but rights are really what we
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:00.520]  demand so you've got as much rights as i've got even if the canadian constitution doesn't say it
[1:29:00.520 --> 1:29:04.680]  but even according to your constitution or your charter you've got amazing uh rights that should
[1:29:04.680 --> 1:29:08.200]  be defended it's only pointing out rights already exist but what i wanted to hit first was
[1:29:09.400 --> 1:29:13.320]  you mentioned the ire the ireland clip set this up we'll tell folks the date cover some more of
[1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:19.160]  those areas then we'll get into rights okay well i really quick i just want to finish what happened
[1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:23.000]  on the day when i did the massless shopping so we went to all the store of massless shopping they
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:26.760]  wouldn't bring the bylaw police came everywhere tried to intimidate i'm talking really fast because
[1:29:26.760 --> 1:29:31.160]  i know time is limited and i will keep you as long as we need to affect i'm excited too people
[1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:36.360]  ask me they go jones are you on cocaine or meth no i had one cup of coffee this morning i start
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:40.680]  talking about global government with claus swab saying i'll be locked in my house and won't ever
[1:29:40.680 --> 1:29:45.640]  get me again and i can't have a car they're gonna force will be a knock to evacuate me and my kids
[1:29:45.640 --> 1:29:50.200]  i'm gonna have to fight back i'm pissed this is cold it's like when you go to football
[1:29:50.200 --> 1:29:56.040]  then you get excited sorry go ahead it's survival so anyway after everybody dispersed after we
[1:29:56.040 --> 1:29:59.480]  were successful going into all the stores the last story went into his whole foods because it's
[1:29:59.480 --> 1:30:06.040]  partially owned by amazon i walked back to my car alone i had one bodyguard who was a senior citizen
[1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:11.800]  from the ukraine and she saw as soon as i got to my car i got sworn by the police i got arrested
[1:30:11.800 --> 1:30:17.320]  they charged me with four counts of a public mischief and a count of public nuisance they
[1:30:17.320 --> 1:30:22.120]  ended up letting me out that day they gave me all these ridiculous conditions i was supposedly banned
[1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:26.920]  from the city of toronto they wanted me to hand over all my legally owned firearms and then i and
[1:30:26.920 --> 1:30:31.080]  then i had a condition that states that i have to abide by the emergency order so right now
[1:30:31.080 --> 1:30:35.960]  i'm on quarantine at home normally if i left my house right now all they can do is charge me under
[1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:40.200]  the quarantine act and give me one of those stupid ticket violations which i would fight in court
[1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:45.800]  and it would get thrown out now if i leave my house they can charge me with a breach of my
[1:30:45.800 --> 1:30:50.120]  conditions which is a serious criminal charge and because they've already arrested me so many times
[1:30:50.120 --> 1:30:54.920]  this year they can make a case not even to give me bail so with all this lockdown stuff the way
[1:30:54.920 --> 1:30:59.000]  they've manipulated the law so if i leave my house right now i can basically get locked up without
[1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:03.400]  bail for six months well that's what i was going to say next in germany it's the same where they
[1:31:03.400 --> 1:31:09.080]  bust in on people medical doctors doing doing online seminars about how this is a fraud where
[1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:14.440]  they swat team people in canada that are online live criticizing what's going on it's clearly the
[1:31:14.440 --> 1:31:18.840]  cover with contact tracers to arrest their political opposition in the future and they're
[1:31:18.840 --> 1:31:22.760]  already doing it i mean it'll take australia where they arrest all these people because they're
[1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:27.640]  online criticizing the lockdown yeah that's what they're trying to do in canada next they want to
[1:31:27.640 --> 1:31:31.560]  try to they're trying to do an online speech law they're already really censoring social media as
[1:31:31.560 --> 1:31:36.280]  you know but they're trying to take it a step further but with regards to what you were just uh
[1:31:36.280 --> 1:31:46.520]  what we were just getting at oh sorry we had uh sorry i lost my train of thought no it's i
[1:31:46.520 --> 1:31:50.120]  hey that's what i do on the show too there's so many damn things they they have you locked up in
[1:31:50.120 --> 1:31:56.600]  your house now you're going to that crazy house i wanted to let everybody know that when you come
[1:31:56.600 --> 1:32:01.080]  home from another country they're trying to stop everybody from traveling the reason they want
[1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:05.240]  everybody not to travel is because when you go to these other countries you're seeing that you're
[1:32:05.240 --> 1:32:09.480]  not locked down in these places places like mexico they're partying all these other countries are
[1:32:09.480 --> 1:32:13.240]  open for business having good time they want you to think everybody's living like canada
[1:32:13.240 --> 1:32:17.400]  masked up terrified and afraid exactly the more locked down they never want you to leave because
[1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:22.440]  they want to keep you in that bubble and take full control to finish the final takeover exactly they
[1:32:22.440 --> 1:32:27.080]  want to have they want to control your perception 100 they don't want any outside influences
[1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:31.320]  breaking their brainwashing over you so they came up with all these crazy rules oh when you
[1:32:31.320 --> 1:32:34.840]  come home we're going to forcibly test you so you're going to stand in line for two or three hours
[1:32:34.840 --> 1:32:38.760]  and then we're going to make you go to a hotel and we're going to keep you there locked up like
[1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:43.640]  an animal or a criminal and solitary confinement so you definitely don't want to travel it's
[1:32:43.640 --> 1:32:49.560]  absolute hogwash just like i showed on the video we have rights canadians have rights
[1:32:49.560 --> 1:32:54.280]  section six of the charter of rights and freedoms is freedom of movement that means canadians can
[1:32:54.280 --> 1:33:00.680]  come and go from canada as they please they can move around canada as they please without any
[1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:08.200]  type of confinement without any type of harassment then we have section 14.1 of the quarantine act
[1:33:08.200 --> 1:33:13.320]  and it very explicitly states what the government is allowed to do when they're trying to see if
[1:33:13.320 --> 1:33:17.320]  you have a communicable disease and they're allowed to do things like ask you health questions
[1:33:17.320 --> 1:33:22.040]  observe for symptoms take a temperature check but they are not allowed any invasive type of
[1:33:22.040 --> 1:33:26.600]  medical procedure and that obviously includes something something up your nose in your mouth
[1:33:26.600 --> 1:33:32.760]  in your butt now they even have so all of that is completely illegal and they're only using the
[1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:39.080]  threat of these stupid fines to try to coerce people into going and the fines are toilet paper
[1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:43.240]  there's been thousands and thousands of people charged with these fines and all that happens is you
[1:33:43.240 --> 1:33:47.480]  bring it to court you could say the same thing violation of section six violation of 14 oh which
[1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:51.240]  means they have state laws that you don't have to wear a mask if you have anxiety but then they
[1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:56.360]  try to ignore it all this facility you exactly on top of that but as soon as it goes to court it
[1:33:56.360 --> 1:34:01.320]  gets thrown out so when you come home from a vacation if you're a canadian citizen or a
[1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:07.720]  permanent resident you have the same rights you simply say i'm a citizen or a permanent resident
[1:34:07.720 --> 1:34:11.720]  chris here's the key here's the key to say that beautiful in your video to their faces with 90
[1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:16.360]  thousand people watching at the time on your own screen beautiful people understand what you said
[1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:22.200]  complying only makes the lockdown longer and worse and it never ends only not complying so so that
[1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:26.680]  they broke them the social contract we think comply for a reasonable problem no we're not
[1:34:26.680 --> 1:34:31.480]  complying for a reasonable problem this is an authoritarian un world government big pharma
[1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:37.400]  bill gates claus Schwab takeover on record and that's what i talked about september 26 i did a
[1:34:37.400 --> 1:34:43.080]  video i want you guys to play it andrew andrew says from rebel filmed it it was uh like a prediction
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:47.720]  video and it said everything that was going to happen and i've seen this video translated into
[1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:52.520]  so many different languages i lost count i was just in istanbul two weeks ago and i just ran into
[1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:57.240]  somebody on the street and they might know my numbers public so this person what's at me the
[1:34:57.240 --> 1:35:02.600]  video of me with turkish subtitles and this video got i think close to a million views in one copy
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:08.600]  and the way the accuracy is laid out is unparalleled and it's like you said it's not because i'm psychic
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:13.880]  it's because this stuff is planned so far in advance that they have to have it written down
[1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:18.600]  they have to have documents there are whistleblowers in the government and the and the police department
[1:35:18.600 --> 1:35:22.840]  that are trying to get this stuff out there because they don't want to get oh almost all the
[1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:27.320]  prestigious doctors and scientists including the lands that is saying the pcr tests the fraud
[1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:32.360]  and the covetous are killing most of these people pcr tests were already invalidated in the portuguese
[1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:36.600]  court because everybody knows that the false positives outweigh the actual positives especially
[1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:40.920]  when they up the cycle count in canada right now they up the cycle count to something like 30 or
[1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:45.640]  35 even up to 40 in some cases what that means for the layman terms is they're increasing the
[1:35:45.640 --> 1:35:50.520]  sensitivity of the test so basically anything that you have in your system it could have been a flu
[1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:54.200]  shot it could have been a covid vaccine it could have been you had covid months ago it could have
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:58.040]  been that you had a cold it could have been that you had the flu any little thing will come up as
[1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:02.920]  covid and then they call you a covid case and then they pretend that they have to have us locked down
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:06.360]  and reality that's another key point you just dropped that's why people that have had even
[1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:10.920]  their second round are showing covid positive so now falci said even if you had the vaccine
[1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:15.080]  you can't go out in public you can't wear a mask who made this guy god he's a little fraud
[1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:20.440]  he said you can't you can't not wear a mask and that's what i say in the video september 26 i already
[1:36:20.440 --> 1:36:24.200]  tell everybody way back then they're going to tell you to take the vaccine that's going to get you
[1:36:24.200 --> 1:36:27.800]  back to normal then in reality once you take the vaccine they're going to tell you the vaccine is
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:32.040]  not as effective as we thought we we don't know if you're not contagious so you're still going to
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:35.400]  have to wear your mask but you're still going to have to get vaccinated by the way that's really
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:39.960]  bad for your sinus to jam it all the way up in your head like that well there's so many contaminants
[1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:43.640]  in the air there's a lot of evidence showing they're actually infecting people with other
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:47.960]  viruses and bacteria at these facilities stay there we'll come right back i know the chinese
[1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:50.920]  government got caught taming them and it's all planned we'll be right back
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:37:00.760]  the need for storable foods are increasingly apparent with millions left without power
[1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:09.720]  including most grocery stores many texas residents are left without food the lines of the grocery
[1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:18.440]  stores are getting longer and longer while most of the store shelves are left bare now we know that
[1:37:18.440 --> 1:37:25.720]  in the most historic record freezing temperatures in over a century your government can simply
[1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:33.560]  turn off the power turn off the heat and turn off the water don't let your government dictate
[1:37:33.560 --> 1:37:40.680]  whether or not you're able to feed your family go to infoorstore.com and get at least a year
[1:37:40.680 --> 1:37:47.080]  supply of storable foods to make sure you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:56.600]  get your storable foods at infoorstore.com as negative if times are right now and as
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:38:03.240]  depressing as things can be you have to understand that this is all a test this experience this
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:11.000]  life on this planet is a reckoning it's god giving us a chance to work things out the third
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:16.760]  dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it
[1:38:16.760 --> 1:38:21.800]  really does come down to that so as sad as things are and as evil as things are look at all the
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:27.080]  good in the world as well and realize that god is the author of our consciousness god is the
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:33.880]  author of us having our own will god is the author of us having free will and that free will
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:38.520]  is a beautiful thing and when you look at mainstream media in hollywood and this whole
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:44.680]  evil culture in washington dc and fauci and the and the mass cult it's all about dominating
[1:38:44.680 --> 1:38:49.400]  your free will it's all about telling you you're dirty directly you're in bed because satan hates
[1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:55.160]  you because you're made in the image of god the creator of the universe i've been thinking a lot
[1:38:55.160 --> 1:39:00.440]  lately about playing devil's advocate on there about looking at the world from the perspective
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:04.360]  of the globalist that the public is so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing
[1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:08.680]  their future from them that we're poisoning them that we're sterilizing them then they deserve to
[1:39:08.680 --> 1:39:14.680]  be killed yes that's the position of the globalists they play god and they think because we don't stand
[1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:20.440]  up they have a right to do this to them you know i've told you that the globalist who tried to
[1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:26.120]  hire me they try to get and join them but metaphysically at a spiritual level i have the holy
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:30.840]  spirit i'm connection with god and i know that god does not like that so i cannot join the enemy
[1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:37.000]  but i'll tell you at a selfish level i get very very mad at people to go along with the system
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:41.240]  believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power out of it whether you're just a
[1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:48.440]  steelworker or a schoolteacher or a kenry testiger you're not god and treating other people like
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:53.240]  they're animals and your god is something that the real god of the universe doesn't like and that's
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:59.160]  a fact we told you it was coming under the united nation's pilot program in singapore for eight months
[1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:04.600]  they made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that make some a social distance and report them
[1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:08.840]  back to cell towers to track for every movement this is for everybody the way it gets better
[1:40:09.480 --> 1:40:14.920]  now france has programs in their factories government push and sponsor to make everyone wear
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:20.600]  actual dog collars to make a social distance and report back to civil computers they're turning
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:25.880]  us into a commodity human animal clones have been around for 50 years it's all being announced
[1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:31.160]  they are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:36.360]  downplay that they own us with the gene therapy systems and patents that they produced do you
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:41.480]  understand it is a takeover of the entire species at the genetic level and now they're coming with
[1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:46.520]  dog collars and they're announcing in public schools in the u.s starting next year it will begin
[1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:51.880]  did you hear me dog collars for your children all based on a hoax all based on a lot implore
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:41:14.680]  wars continue to spread the word to fight back you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:14.680 --> 1:41:20.600]  what if i say i will never surrender well christ guy is really kicking ass and i tell a lot of our
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:24.680]  guests you're on fire because we have guests on their own fire they can call this broadcast on fire
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:30.360]  christ guy during that break man he was telling me all this amazing stuff will you please because
[1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:33.560]  it makes me very proud of the listeners for supporting us over the years there's so many
[1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:37.240]  activists i get on like you uh you know ended up waking up because of the show you're saying
[1:41:37.240 --> 1:41:40.680]  you've been listening to this broadcast since you were a child brother tell folks about that
[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:47.720]  oh my gosh we the first video i saw of you must have been in like 2002 just after 9 11 happened
[1:41:47.720 --> 1:41:52.360]  and i've been a fan since then so i was uh probably around 14 or 15 years old then
[1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:57.800]  we're talking over 20 years ago so it'd be on the show is a complete honor and just like you
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:03.800]  i live and breathe this i i sleep like maybe three hours every 24 hours everybody that knows me know
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:09.720]  of this that's the spirit though because when you know you're under attack and you're not hateful
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:14.920]  you're not bitter you're winning you're laughing you're dominating you're crushing them yeah so i
[1:42:14.920 --> 1:42:20.360]  have a lot of energy i just eat a lot i don't breathe but i eat a lot that's for sure well
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:24.120]  brother you're kicking ass let's play that clip that probably has a hundred million views i mean
[1:42:24.120 --> 1:42:27.720]  in fact when you mention the clip i've forgotten i saw this months ago and had like five million
[1:42:27.720 --> 1:42:33.400]  views and as fast as they take it down it goes back up in like every language out there uh so uh
[1:42:33.400 --> 1:42:39.320]  here is probably the 50th ripped generation of you laying out the battle plan and and folks now
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:43.960]  are like oh this guy's a prophet no you have their battle plan here it is don't need a math the masses
[1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:48.360]  about compliance because they know canadians like to do what they're told so they tell you have to
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:52.280]  wear a mask next they're going to tell you have to contact trace then they're going to tell you
[1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:56.200]  you have to take the vaccine and because canadians like to do what they're told they're hoping that
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:43:01.720]  everyone just complies and then guess what kids once you take your vaccine like a dumb person
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:06.520]  that doesn't know any better they're going to tell you a story the vaccine isn't as effective as we
[1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:11.000]  thought it was going to be so now you still got to wear your mask still got to get contact trace
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:15.400]  still have all the restrictions and social distancing and still take your vaccine and then
[1:43:15.400 --> 1:43:19.720]  what did you get out of all of this you got a whole year where you weren't allowed to travel
[1:43:19.720 --> 1:43:24.120]  your business was closed they took your rights and freedoms they forced the vaccine on you
[1:43:24.120 --> 1:43:29.320]  and what happened the same amount of people died everything is the exact same and now they're
[1:43:29.320 --> 1:43:34.440]  going to put you back on lockdown and bring it all the way till july of next year so they can do
[1:43:34.440 --> 1:43:40.040]  the same thing again bring you from july august and september getting you off lockdown but just to
[1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:45.400]  bring you back on lockdown again if you have any time and figured it out yet it's a perpetual cycle
[1:43:45.400 --> 1:43:50.840]  that you never get out of and it's a way to take your rights your freedoms close your business
[1:43:50.840 --> 1:43:56.440]  take your wealth why so you become dependent on government why if you're independent the government
[1:43:56.440 --> 1:44:00.760]  works for you like it's supposed to if you depend on the government to give you a paycheck to feed
[1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:05.320]  your family every month because they closed your business on you now the government doesn't work
[1:44:05.320 --> 1:44:11.880]  for you the government rules you so instead of a middle class we have the government upper class
[1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:16.840]  and the lower class dependence that rely on the government to survive in other words we have a
[1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:21.720]  slave class and that's what they're trying to do it that simple all right thanks a lot chris and
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:25.320]  you were telling me days before they came to your house and threatened to arrest you if you spoke
[1:44:25.320 --> 1:44:29.880]  in public again i mean that's not a free country actually the day before that because they knew i
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:34.520]  came back on the 20th of september on the 25th of september they came to my house knowing that the
[1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:39.080]  26th i'd be at the protest and the police openly said if you go to the protest we're going to charge
[1:44:39.080 --> 1:44:43.880]  you under the quarantine act criminally and i said go for it i'm going on the protest i went to the
[1:44:43.880 --> 1:44:48.680]  protest i made that video they charged me they gave me a ticket uh the mainstream media came up
[1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:53.720]  just to film them giving me the ticket i looked at the ticket they spelled my first and last name
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:57.960]  wrong on the ticket i went back on the podium got on the mic i publicly challenged him to give me a
[1:44:57.960 --> 1:45:02.360]  proper ticket so i could challenge it in court they didn't the next week while i was still on
[1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:08.760]  quarantine i went back to the protest again this time uh maxine bernier the leader of the ppc was
[1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:13.080]  there and rob carbone leader of the republican party of canada was there and we also pictures
[1:45:13.080 --> 1:45:17.720]  together nobody told them to quarantine nobody told them to stay away from me anything like that
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:22.120]  the next day i got i got charged criminally under the quarantine act i'm the only person in the
[1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:27.480]  history of canada to get charged criminally i took it to court i've been trying to go ahead
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:31.720]  to court and get a trial because i know i could file multiple charter challenges and win guess
[1:45:31.720 --> 1:45:36.360]  what they've done they postponed on me four times so far and i have another court date coming up and
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:39.000]  i guess what they're going to do again i'm going to ask them for disclosure i'm going to ask them
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:42.760]  for a trial they're not going to give it to me because they listen brother you're on the war room

[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:53.960]  beat this thing together and let me tell you claus schwaub and bill gates and all the criminals
[1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:58.120]  that launched this they're big organized crime these big corporations hitler thought he was too
[1:48:58.120 --> 1:49:02.440]  big to fail the southern union thought they were too big to fail gg pig thinks he's too big to fail
[1:49:02.440 --> 1:49:06.920]  they will fail i'm gonna play this report where we predicted it all 10 years ago 11 years ago
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:11.080]  and then steve quill's coming up next hour here's the report i'm not even worthy to be
[1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:16.280]  bringing you information this powerful and i hope that you pay attention to what we cover here
[1:49:16.280 --> 1:49:24.280]  minute by minute because i've had chills uh since last night this just confirms everything else
[1:49:24.280 --> 1:49:31.320]  we've already researched a Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:37.480]  elite millions being killed mandatory quarantines checkpoints the end of the family everything
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:41.240]  that's in the other documents but this dove tells of all the other Rockefeller foundation
[1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:46.440]  documents about the gmo food sterilize you and force vaccines and the hell we're already living
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:50.760]  in this is going to continue to intensify until we take our government's back from these eugenics
[1:49:50.760 --> 1:49:56.200]  madmen but that story is up on prisonplanet.com the question is will you have the courage to
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:50:00.360]  really do the research yourself because i don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these
[1:50:00.360 --> 1:50:06.440]  claims these people are so arrogant that they write policy papers so many of them that they're
[1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:12.600]  producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read
[1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:18.680]  them all it is an open conspiracy against you and your family i pray to god i pray to my heavenly
[1:50:18.680 --> 1:50:23.480]  father jesus christ every night to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this
[1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:29.160]  horror and to give me the strength to carry on because i know why a lot of you don't want to
[1:50:29.160 --> 1:50:33.320]  look at this information and just want to comment on the youtube videos or on message boards and i'm
[1:50:33.320 --> 1:50:44.200]  a liar i know why because it's scary you're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore
[1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:49.320]  you're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends you're not going to be
[1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:57.000]  able to just you'll go out and enjoy yourself all the time the only chance we've got of beating

[1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:11.880]  mentally psychologically physically spiritually the only way to defeat it is for the rank and
[1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:17.800]  file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be
[1:51:19.240 --> 1:51:23.720]  once you face this information once you've consciously admitted it to yourself it will
[1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:29.320]  take over your life it should take over your life well i mean what else what else could it do

[1:55:52.920 --> 1:55:56.760]  patreon supply the number one storeable food company in the united states of the world really
[1:55:56.760 --> 1:56:02.440]  only 14 years old because they've got such servers and such quality and such fast delivery they've
[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:07.160]  become the biggest company and they said listen we can't do the discounts anymore and we can't do
[1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:11.880]  the free shipping because there isn't enough markup we're not making money you're not making money
[1:56:11.880 --> 1:56:17.080]  we gotta keep the lights on jones we're already the lowest price for high quality and i called
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:22.840]  them up during the ice storm and i said look we've habituated everybody to sales and they said you're
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:26.840]  right we don't care we'll sell it basically at cost you'll get your percentage to pay for your
[1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:31.080]  operation how about free shipping to alex and i said are you being sarcastic and the owner
[1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:37.080]  doesn't want his name mentioned said no free shipping and 10 off that that's such an insane
[1:56:37.080 --> 1:56:43.880]  deal it makes my head spin but he said you only run it for seven days and so that's that seven days
[1:56:43.880 --> 1:56:49.480]  starting today 10 off and free shipping are already great high quality trouble food you cannot
[1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:54.040]  beat that deal but it's part of the four to five years supplies special and i'll be honest with
[1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:57.160]  listeners i never used to talk like this we could be off the air at any time you see hundreds of
[1:56:57.160 --> 1:57:01.560]  publications saying fbis put right up at me in jail you see all the headlines arrest alex jones

[1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:40.200]  reason i decided to do this even though we've we've we've learned to run lean we don't keep a lot of
[1:57:40.200 --> 1:57:43.160]  stuff in the warehouse when you order something we've got it ready to ship but i basically don't
[1:57:43.160 --> 1:57:46.600]  have lost the warehouse anymore because i just sell what we've got and that's it i don't keep a
[1:57:46.600 --> 1:57:50.680]  stop pile because i don't have the money and they could arrest me at any time and then we've got
[1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:54.120]  people to keep stay on here and try to keep operating as long as we can after that but
[1:57:54.120 --> 1:57:57.720]  they've tried to silence us it's not working so now i'm not going to tell you the stuff they're
[1:57:57.720 --> 1:58:01.560]  doing it's it doesn't intimidate me at all it actually gives me me energy but they've got
[1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:06.920]  a lot of stuff going on something they think intimidates us it doesn't intimidate us it only
[1:58:06.920 --> 1:58:12.360]  makes us know we're definitely over the target so it could be your last chance to get products at
[1:58:12.360 --> 1:58:16.760]  infowarstore.com it could be your last chance to get storable food i mean they can start a major war

[1:58:20.440 --> 1:58:24.120]  this is only going to get crazier from here on out i told you that when they stole the election
[1:58:24.120 --> 1:58:29.000]  from trump i said don't go to sleep because the start's just begun of this so we may go on for
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:33.320]  years we may turn things around all i know is if you want to support us now's the time we've been
[1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:37.480]  proven right all hell's breaking loose we got the best deals ever and we're not globalist take

[1:58:46.840 --> 1:58:52.760]  of it right now all right we're gonna go to break and come back with steve quill you know i knew
[1:58:52.760 --> 1:59:00.440]  trump was in battle i knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the
[1:59:00.440 --> 1:59:06.440]  enemy and a lot of people just couldn't believe it they're like oh no it's the 3g chest 5g chest
[1:59:06.440 --> 1:59:10.920]  he's invincible and i understand why people wanted to believe that because this is scary what's going
[1:59:10.920 --> 1:59:15.160]  on the global government in the new world order and now that people woke up in fact that's real
[1:59:15.160 --> 1:59:20.200]  they want somebody to come save them from well trump sure as hell tried my gosh look at how
[1:59:20.200 --> 1:59:25.000]  prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled depending on the drug once i decide that executive
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:30.360]  order we pay the most money by the world that's just one case of hundreds of things that trumpet
[1:59:30.360 --> 1:59:35.720]  reversed and now people are gonna feel the sting in the pain the energy cost everything else but
[1:59:35.720 --> 1:59:40.600]  what's really illustrated this is the trial to the senate where trump's own lawyers are attacking
[1:59:40.600 --> 1:59:45.480]  him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engage all sorts of criminal
[1:59:45.480 --> 1:59:51.640]  activity because the fix is in folks the swamp is deep trump fought it but it's up to us to win it
[1:59:51.640 --> 2:00:09.000]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:16.120]  under my thumb the girl who once had me down
[2:00:17.720 --> 2:00:22.200]  humanity was doing a great job trying to struggle free from the grips of world government
[2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:28.440]  but it wasn't enough of a spiritual christian movement to break the chains of say god has to
[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:34.920]  do that in the end it's not up to us to win this it's up to us to persevere to the end to meet with
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:39.960]  our creator through this test everything in life is a test everything is a everything is a dance
[2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:46.440]  everything is an already choreographed by god by giving us consciousness and free will but god
[2:00:46.440 --> 2:00:51.640]  still knows the outcome but still his children had to go through the test steve quayle is the best
[2:00:51.640 --> 2:00:55.800]  filling author filmmaker researcher survivalist one of the first big survivalist he's been on
[2:00:55.800 --> 2:01:00.920]  air over 30 years out here i'm on air 30 years ago and thought he sounds legitimate doesn't sound
[2:01:00.920 --> 2:01:07.240]  like he's lying but he he's going too far it turned out he was just too far ahead and so he
[2:01:07.240 --> 2:01:13.720]  joins us to get into the announcements of reeducation camps of martial law of all trump supporters
[2:01:13.720 --> 2:01:20.520]  must be reeducated uh of the cutting off our pipelines opening our borders uh biden coming
[2:01:20.520 --> 2:01:26.760]  up and play the video pledge allegiance to the great reset that's the technical name of uh
[2:01:26.760 --> 2:01:33.160]  this whole operation and that's really the public name of it the the the scientific name is uh the
[2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:40.840]  operation lockstep so that's all coming up here ladies and gentlemen steve quayle joins us and
[2:01:40.840 --> 2:01:46.600]  i really appreciate him coming on steve it's so surreal people over use that word but to know
[2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:50.520]  this was all coming to see him setting it up to see the beta testing and then you always
[2:01:50.520 --> 2:01:55.400]  warning that once they launch though won't be beta anymore to all accelerate and now we've
[2:01:55.400 --> 2:02:01.160]  accelerated like it warped speed and it's it's just getting more nightmarish by the moment and so
[2:02:01.160 --> 2:02:08.520]  there's this paradox of huge awakenings but also those that are under deception are accepting
[2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:14.120]  now more and more and in downtown austin a large part of the public when we go videotape them actually
[2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:19.480]  behave like hunchback demons or something so just a lot of weirdness is going on thank you for joining
[2:02:19.480 --> 2:02:25.400]  thank you for joining us my friend well alex i think you've nailed it and the bottom line is the
[2:02:25.400 --> 2:02:31.800]  entire nation has turned largely against the living god and embrace satanism the luciferians and
[2:02:31.800 --> 2:02:36.840]  ladies and gentlemen for all these years we've been called every name you can call us but quote
[2:02:36.840 --> 2:02:43.160]  conspiracy theorists and first of all every single conspiracy we've named has now come into play
[2:02:43.160 --> 2:02:47.000]  we told you the globalist we're going to try and steal the government we told you there being
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:54.520]  mccamps we told you ladies and gentlemen about all the military plans and even now fortress america
[2:02:54.520 --> 2:03:00.840]  simply means that the politicians who have sold us out and sold us to foreign interests and you'd
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:06.840]  be surprised at how much chinese money went into back the leading politicians and ladies and gentlemen
[2:03:06.840 --> 2:03:14.440]  we're at the time now texas is a microcosm of the war that's going to be absolutely in place
[2:03:14.440 --> 2:03:21.800]  and exerted against the entire united states of america some somebody called it texas again
[2:03:21.800 --> 2:03:26.200]  and and alex we've been talking about everything from weather warfare as we've been talking about
[2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:32.200]  foreign troops we've been talking about by the way but some people don't get it but there's 256
[2:03:32.200 --> 2:03:37.640]  thousand that's a real number of guillotines dispersed throughout the fema camps military
[2:03:37.640 --> 2:03:42.120]  bases and different places around the world i couldn't know that unless somebody excuse me
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:46.360]  who had access to that and didn't they put it in the last defense authorization act to use guillotines
[2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:54.760]  again yes they did and it's now an official uh acceptable form of absolute uh capital punishment
[2:03:54.760 --> 2:03:59.960]  and i heard you 30 years ago saying and when they're about to make their move they'll legalize
[2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:05.960]  guillotines and i'm like this guy's a wack job they just did it last year yep and here's the thing
[2:04:05.960 --> 2:04:12.360]  ladies and gentlemen this is really critical again the weather modification against texas
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:17.480]  was for basically four different reasons number one succession number two the lawsuits against
[2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:23.560]  the stolen election number three texas is oil and livestock industry number four i just made a
[2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:31.320]  quick note of myself uh you know uh the the ability of texas to actually with her economy
[2:04:31.320 --> 2:04:38.360]  and the amount of people that have distilled the patriotic fervor now when i see austin alex
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:43.000]  you know i i wonder about that but here's the thing sure but does the texas idea of being our
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:47.880]  own country and self-sufficient what we were they had to discredit that is yucky schumer said now
[2:04:47.880 --> 2:04:51.480]  maybe we've learned our lesson but we now know it was urkot and the globalist ordered the stand
[2:04:51.480 --> 2:04:59.320]  down we have the document absolutely so here's the deal the entire united states is going into a
[2:04:59.320 --> 2:05:06.040]  forced famine there's nothing in the pipelines and i tell people this next to food alex has told you
[2:05:06.040 --> 2:05:11.640]  about uh you know the food supply you've got to get it but uh all of the supplements alex every
[2:05:11.640 --> 2:05:17.800]  supplement you have i said years ago the food will go and then they'll uh they the globalist
[2:05:17.800 --> 2:05:21.880]  luciferians well we already can't get most of the supplements a lot of this is our last runs
[2:05:21.880 --> 2:05:26.600]  we've already gotten rid of seven products we just can't get it right and that's the thing they
[2:05:26.600 --> 2:05:31.560]  want to starve us and i tell you what when the richest guy in the world the gates of hell makes
[2:05:31.560 --> 2:05:38.040]  this statement that you and i should eat artificial meat uh hello everybody that's why texas was
[2:05:38.040 --> 2:05:44.520]  chosen i've been talking about weather modification and weather warfare for 25 years and the thing
[2:05:44.520 --> 2:05:48.600]  that people got to understand every defense secretary has talked about it there's the united
[2:05:48.600 --> 2:05:56.920]  nations treaty against it the most sophisticated weapons are 72 ionospheric heaters so this is
[2:05:56.920 --> 2:06:03.880]  to starve you into compliance and by the way alex you made the statement it's true 125 million people
[2:06:03.880 --> 2:06:10.200]  have to die according to the globalists all of the statements have all made from all the
[2:06:10.200 --> 2:06:14.520]  political left they're going to get rid of trump supporters are going to get rid of gun owners and
[2:06:14.520 --> 2:06:21.560]  i want to share this every gun owner you've got to understand that the battlefield is coming to your
[2:06:21.560 --> 2:06:29.160]  front door and in essence you watch the country get stolen supreme court they are no longer supreme
[2:06:29.160 --> 2:06:34.760]  okay we've watched our congress sell us out we've watched the election stolen we've watched the
[2:06:34.760 --> 2:06:40.280]  technocrats build the ultimate surveillance system in china and i said all along and so did you alex
[2:06:40.280 --> 2:06:44.760]  that they're just going to bring it to the united states and ladies and gentlemen by the way facebook
[2:06:44.760 --> 2:06:51.000]  is craze book uh cellophones i call them helipons and we've heard all of the things and ladies and
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:57.160]  gentlemen alex and i you remember this alex 20 years ago we talked about marcus wolf of the stasi
[2:06:57.160 --> 2:07:04.040]  you have demi prima cop the former head of let me stop you i had you on like 20 years ago it was
[2:07:04.040 --> 2:07:09.240]  20 years ago it was right around 9 11 and you go they hired marcus wolf and a million dollar program
[2:07:09.240 --> 2:07:14.040]  in the congressional budget i thought you were wrong i went and looked it up and it was in their
[2:07:14.040 --> 2:07:19.480]  budget years later they admitted it they admitted google and facebook hired all of his adjunct to
[2:07:19.480 --> 2:07:26.280]  actually run their operations that's mainstream news and it is and so what was facebook what is
[2:07:26.280 --> 2:07:31.320]  twitter what is all of social media and look at all of us who are warning about it we've all been
[2:07:31.320 --> 2:07:37.880]  deplatformed i just found out i'm i'm banned in more countries yesterday but what's fascinating is
[2:07:37.880 --> 2:07:47.400]  simply this they have created self-erecting or basically self-building intelligence dossiers
[2:07:47.400 --> 2:07:51.800]  on our video how many people don't get jobs because they're bragging on facebook uh going out and
[2:07:51.800 --> 2:07:59.000]  getting hammered or whatever but it's worse than that every single uh contact of the facebook ease
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:04.920]  and by the way i came came up with the term i believe it's accurate phases of death book uh
[2:08:04.920 --> 2:08:10.600]  obviously all of the different tracking facial tracking parameters everything and the bottom
[2:08:10.600 --> 2:08:17.960]  line is is that ladies and gentlemen all of these were funded funded by the uh central intelligence
[2:08:17.960 --> 2:08:25.000]  agency or different intelligence agencies and that's why all of the guys who submitted to it are all
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:31.240]  billionaires and some of the richest people in the world so here's the thing texas please understand
[2:08:31.240 --> 2:08:39.400]  this you had full scale weather war against you economic warfare against you uh you heard what
[2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:47.720]  tumor that piece of uh uh you know uh mouthpiece uh i can't say it but the bottom line is those
[2:08:47.720 --> 2:08:53.640]  people hate you and so in order to insulate themselves they brought in the national guard
[2:08:53.640 --> 2:09:03.240]  notice this even nancy polosovic okay decided polosovic decided to ask for armored personnel
[2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:09.240]  carriers with machine guns the most anti-gun spokesman for the demon-cratic party and the
[2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:16.360]  republican whores republican whores absolutely wanted a machine gun you and notice he went
[2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:21.000]  out and reviewed the armored vehicles like red dawn and they said they're staying until i meant
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:26.120]  to play the glady clip from yesterday guys get it senator lehi said they stay until we're routed out
[2:09:26.840 --> 2:09:30.840]  and so we have permanent martial law in dc let's come back and talk about what they're gonna do
[2:09:30.840 --> 2:09:34.280]  next because you're great at telling us what's happening now but you're really great at telling
[2:09:34.280 --> 2:09:39.480]  us what's coming next the different the different uh scenarios and how we decide what those will be

[2:11:03.640 --> 2:11:08.280]  to bring in federal and globalist control we have seen massive lines of people
[2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:14.680]  lined up at the few grocery stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:19.720]  away after hours of freezing in the cold we've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars
[2:11:19.720 --> 2:11:24.040]  because they don't have any power in their house and then running out of gas ladies and gentlemen

[2:12:20.200 --> 2:12:25.800]  and a lot of big films arrow tv you name it but Steve quail is definitely the visionary his books
[2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:31.480]  and i've read them all just decades before predicted everything and it's just incredible
[2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:34.920]  people ask word alex jones get it all i got it from the globalist admitting a lot of stuff and
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:40.360]  then steve quail's analysis of my own analysis but i mean steve quail's been right up there with
[2:12:41.240 --> 2:12:45.480]  david icon others predicting what was coming and he just deserves the credit folks because he
[2:12:45.480 --> 2:12:49.880]  he was put through a lot of hell for telling the truth and yes we do carry some of his books
[2:12:50.440 --> 2:12:54.760]  at info wars store dot com but the one you need to read is available steve quail dot com is
[2:12:54.760 --> 2:12:59.560]  weather wars and unnatural disasters we'll talk about this coming up next segment but let's
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:05.960]  spend the shorter segment steve getting into i can't be alarmist enough i mean when you've got
[2:13:05.960 --> 2:13:11.480]  lehi saying we're not going to leave the troops until the trump supporters are routed out and
[2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:17.640]  every other pundit saying we want war we want death we want to kill people um all of it i mean
[2:13:17.640 --> 2:13:22.920]  that they say they want us in fema camps they have bills that say reeducation camp centers
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:28.760]  i mean this is this is what obama wanted to do we know biden is what what the third term of of of
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:35.080]  obama really oh biden is that accurate and what do you think's coming next well first of all what's
[2:13:35.080 --> 2:13:40.840]  coming next and by the way biden's just a hand puppet just substitute the new world order
[2:13:40.840 --> 2:13:46.120]  just substitute the death of 90 of the world's population that's what's real but what's coming
[2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:50.840]  first and foremost is basically alex we're going to see border lockdowns and what really
[2:13:50.840 --> 2:13:56.760]  infuriated me was when lehi said we're not going to take away our if you will protective
[2:13:56.760 --> 2:14:03.640]  of barbed wire our fortress washington dc and he said this until the first and second amendment
[2:14:03.640 --> 2:14:12.600]  are gone ladies and gentlemen that's treason that's treason in essence they i'll make it simple alex
[2:14:12.600 --> 2:14:18.200]  they want everybody dead they're not coming for the gun owners are coming to murder they you know
[2:14:18.200 --> 2:14:22.440]  dot to arrest them they'll arrest you i totally agree so why are they being so honest why did
[2:14:22.440 --> 2:14:27.480]  biden last monday endorse the invasion of hong kong and death camps in china i mean the whole
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:34.120]  world was just like what the hell is this well the ties between the current administration
[2:14:34.120 --> 2:14:43.240]  and china are off the charts the amount of money paid to bribe you know i mean come on you you can
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:52.120]  see all of the uh different compromise compromise even uh mic mcconnell and others compromised
[2:14:52.120 --> 2:14:58.440]  compromised by the chinese interest so here's the deal ladies and gentlemen the two most important
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:05.240]  rights in my opinion the bill of rights is free speech they're killing our ability to speak freely
[2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:12.040]  second is the second amendment with without it everybody dies and what makes me furious alex
[2:15:12.040 --> 2:15:18.440]  is even the deagle report you and i nailed that the years ago stating they're going to take the
[2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:25.160]  population of america down to 100 million and we don't know major insurance actuaries have this
[2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:30.760]  magic disappearance of large parts of the population coming up soon right and you can expect first of
[2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:37.320]  all again i want to tell people what's headed genocide of the elderly and of the infirm okay
[2:15:37.320 --> 2:15:44.440]  you're going to watch state after state everything from uh allowing you know merciful death usman
[2:15:44.440 --> 2:15:51.400]  asia everything they're going to basically make total war on the american people they're going
[2:15:51.400 --> 2:15:56.840]  to starve us out and by the way alex when you see all of these uh empty coolers at whatever
[2:15:56.840 --> 2:16:03.080]  mart store whatever supermarket store what makes people think there will ever be food on the shelves
[2:16:03.080 --> 2:16:10.440]  again i'm telling you everyone the plan was with the covet 19 lockdown it's the cover for the collapse
[2:16:10.440 --> 2:16:14.280]  so they can blame it on covet when the plan was always the great reset to bring us to our knees
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:21.400]  in their own words yeah and absolutely and then the other thing that false charges listen right
[2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:27.960]  now there is no appeal to the courts there is no appeal a false arrest are happening all over the
[2:16:27.960 --> 2:16:34.440]  country and and biden just released he just signed a uh proclamation uh i guess you'd say
[2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:41.560]  amnesty against all of the antifa and blm people meanwhile trump supporters rotten prism that's
[2:16:41.560 --> 2:16:46.360]  right people that shot cops burned down buildings they're released literally but meanwhile people
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:49.720]  that walk between the velvet robes because they didn't know what was happening a few hundred broke
[2:16:49.720 --> 2:16:55.560]  in a few hundred followed they're they're being charged with terrorism absolutely and here's what's
[2:16:55.560 --> 2:17:00.840]  coming next you're already seeing it in the headlines of today california the new mutant
[2:17:00.840 --> 2:17:07.480]  variation of cv 19 all of the bull manure that was associated with the first lockdown ladies and
[2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:13.720]  gentlemen you create the problem cv 19 you provide the solution oh our tests and you provide the
[2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:20.840]  ultimate thing vaccination this is the statement and i made this first on alexa show years ago shot
[2:17:20.840 --> 2:17:26.520]  in a shot in a shot in the arm shot in the head either way you end up done vaccine or a bullet
[2:17:26.520 --> 2:17:32.360]  to your head people thought that was so extreme and i want to share this the word extremists the
[2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:39.400]  word uh uh they call us everything fear mongers uh conspiracy theories and they love the race thing
[2:17:39.400 --> 2:17:44.920]  because now anyone pro human anyone pro life is called a racist we are for the human race it's
[2:17:44.920 --> 2:17:51.320]  actually true they are anti-carbon meaning they're anti-human why are they so anti-carbon well first
[2:17:51.320 --> 2:17:58.280]  of all because they intend that's a great question they intend to get rid of humanity or humankind
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:04.280]  and i am a human racist too i believe in the right of the human race to exist and insert
[2:18:04.280 --> 2:18:10.520]  a siliconized life form a good example sex robots yeah but how did you know that 20 years ago when
[2:18:10.520 --> 2:18:14.200]  you wrote best selling books on it because that no one had said that you did how did you know their
[2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:21.240]  secret plan because now they've unveiled it well here's the deal knowing they want to destroy fertility
[2:18:21.240 --> 2:18:28.200]  and human fertility knowing all of the you know science fiction movies were telegraphing it way
[2:18:28.200 --> 2:18:34.120]  back into the fifties actually even back into the thirties and forties but the thing is is that human
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:42.200]  sexuality will give way that's the same thing with the lgbtq xyz movement obviously uh we're
[2:18:42.200 --> 2:18:48.760]  seeing the denigration of the human race we're seeing the depopulation of human race i tell
[2:18:48.760 --> 2:18:53.560]  people we've got the dumbest sperm in the world because and i'm saying in america because they
[2:18:53.560 --> 2:18:57.960]  can't count our sperm counts and it doesn't matter if you're black or white or hispanic or whatever
[2:18:57.960 --> 2:19:02.360]  all of our sperm is dying our future is dying we're under attack we should stop killing each other
[2:19:03.400 --> 2:19:10.120]  absolutely you are an american you're not an afro-american you're not a i am a human racist i
[2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:14.920]  am pro-human i am a human racist right i think we're calling the term today here brother
[2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:22.680]  yep yep and here's the deal the deal is is that all of these life forms and by the way i'm on record
[2:19:22.680 --> 2:19:27.480]  and what you're gonna see ladies and gentlemen is all the demons all the middle age uh uh you know
[2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:33.240]  myths and legends come into your literal vision and you're gonna see demon possessed machines
[2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:39.000]  and all that the technocrats are doing is based on silicon when people they were talking about
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:43.720]  you eradicating eradicating yeah they say this spirit is going to come into the silicon just
[2:19:43.720 --> 2:19:50.360]  like they told us in maximum overdrive absolutely so everything hollywood by the way every hollywood
[2:19:50.360 --> 2:19:54.680]  movie in science fiction has to get cleared through the intelligence agency you got to say
[2:19:54.680 --> 2:19:59.640]  that i was talking to a top scientist from mit dinner i'm gonna leave it at that and i've
[2:19:59.640 --> 2:20:03.960]  done a very famous person and he told me i said what's the end game he said what elon must had
[2:20:03.960 --> 2:20:10.120]  a month ago about endless orgasms from a computer he said he said a sex robot is our main goal
[2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:14.200]  and but but this seems dumb to me because i don't want to have sex with a sex doll but to them
[2:20:14.760 --> 2:20:19.240]  that if they can become a woman if they can replace that they believe they want stay there
[2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:25.720]  steve quill is on fire as always gen six giants dot com gen six giants dot com steve quill dot com
[2:20:25.720 --> 2:20:31.400]  and his book weather wars and unnatural disasters amazing we carry some of his books we should be
[2:20:31.400 --> 2:20:35.720]  carrying them all in four store i don't care where you get it just be sure and get uh this this this

[2:23:01.240 --> 2:23:07.320]  vampires wherever you want to call them that are highly predatory and are setting up a false
[2:23:07.320 --> 2:23:14.200]  fantasy land system of constant bombardment of propaganda drugs and electromagnetic radiation
[2:23:14.200 --> 2:23:21.640]  to change the very dna of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control
[2:23:22.280 --> 2:23:27.720]  like a pawn on a chessboard the bottom line is they want to play god they are playing god and
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  the news is only going to tighten around our necks from year on out so many other people
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:37.640]  want to be positive they want to put out fake news and when i only covered limited amounts of
[2:23:37.640 --> 2:23:42.440]  adaptive renewal order but at the end of the day it's all about the population it's all about world
[2:23:42.440 --> 2:23:47.160]  government it's all about the end of human system as we know it and on its ashes a nightmare
[2:23:47.160 --> 2:24:00.120]  being built only admitting it can turn around stop it you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:24:00.120 --> 2:24:13.400]  wow there is a war on for your mind and my mind
[2:24:15.800 --> 2:24:21.320]  steve quayle is going to have to join us again next week if he'll do it he just laid an incredible
[2:24:21.320 --> 2:24:26.600]  idea on me and i knew about some of this i was being told about this maybe when i mentioned elon
[2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:33.400]  muskis why he brought this up but a real sink in the enemy's armor is there all this technology is
[2:24:33.400 --> 2:24:38.360]  advancing but they're mainly targeting the general public and mainline technology or older technology
[2:24:38.360 --> 2:24:44.040]  but they're not targeting some of these other areas and it's it's a real gap in the globalist
[2:24:44.040 --> 2:24:48.840]  defenses and so we're going to talk about that maybe at the end of the show or maybe he comes back
[2:24:48.840 --> 2:24:53.640]  and joins us next week but very very exciting and we're definitely on the same page but he's
[2:24:53.640 --> 2:24:58.680]  as usual a few steps ahead of me so steve quayle we're here we're talking about all this you mentioned
[2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:04.360]  senator lehi here he is yesterday on tv and as you mentioned the full timon interview he says
[2:25:04.360 --> 2:25:09.320]  not until we've rotted out the extremist speech and gotten the guns the tumors introduced a bill
[2:25:09.320 --> 2:25:13.720]  that that biden supports to ban all semi-autos and everything and register everybody else and
[2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:17.240]  then have no due process where the justice department says you can't have a gun you can't
[2:25:17.240 --> 2:25:23.800]  have a gun making them imperial this is so dangerous um he said that basically we won't
[2:25:23.800 --> 2:25:28.840]  have the troops leave dc until that happens so they're planning on stuff so bad they're worried
[2:25:28.840 --> 2:25:34.920]  about a march on dc with pissed off americans here senator lehi uh i would suggest everybody
[2:25:35.960 --> 2:25:41.080]  get together and look at the future because if you have something that goes on for months
[2:25:41.080 --> 2:25:47.400]  and the president calling them everybody else calling them i'm worried that there was not more
[2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:56.920]  there uh i think until we wrote out the hate and throw the raptors through the door that day
[2:25:57.560 --> 2:26:06.280]  no fence or tank of barriers going to provide the safety we need um i want safety but also
[2:26:06.280 --> 2:26:11.320]  talk about it a bit franker and says give up those who give up essential liberty to
[2:26:12.280 --> 2:26:21.160]  purchase low-temperity safety deserve either liberty nor safety but um i know a vote is on
[2:26:21.160 --> 2:26:28.840]  and before i close i do want to commend uh chief haunting for your swift response i you don't have
[2:26:28.840 --> 2:26:37.000]  an easy job to protect a city as large as washington dc and balance the delicate balance with other
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:44.520]  dozens of other law enforcement so senator lehi he can barely talk he twists benjamin
[2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:48.600]  franklin's quote about those that give up essential liberty will have and deserve neither
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:53.800]  but then he says oh no tanks or bar bar friends will protect us but they gotta stay till we've
[2:26:53.800 --> 2:27:02.120]  routed out the hate wow after they burned down half the country uh this this last summer so again
[2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:09.000]  this is really a declaration of war see well like so here's the thing it's more than a declaration
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:15.880]  of war the american people especially the trump obviously the second amendment gun owners the
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:21.480]  christians really high up on the list look at the identification the billification of christians
[2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:25.560]  the nullification of them were better off without them and the destruction by the way
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:30.680]  the cutting off the heads relating the idea teams i i'd encourage everybody to go to revelation
[2:27:30.680 --> 2:27:36.760]  chapter 20 and and and verse four and it talks about the souls of them that were beheaded for
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:43.240]  the witness of jesus and for the word of god and for they who didn't worship the beast we've heard
[2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:48.440]  again we've heard from bill gates his own mouth you won't be able to buy you won't be able to sell
[2:27:48.440 --> 2:27:54.040]  you won't be able to uh uh uh trade and you won't be able to travel that's right it's not the bible
[2:27:54.040 --> 2:27:59.000]  telling us now it's bill gates it's claus Schwab and you know it's interesting the jackabins use
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:03.080]  guillotines when they had other ways to kill in france they were satanists on record that's main
[2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:08.760]  lines history people don't know that uh it goes back to the bible of the heading why is the satan
[2:28:08.760 --> 2:28:14.040]  system obsessed with beheading there it is and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment
[2:28:14.040 --> 2:28:20.040]  was given to them and i saw the souls of them were beheaded for the witness of jesus for the
[2:28:20.040 --> 2:28:26.120]  word of god for which did not worship the beast either his image neither received his mark upon
[2:28:26.120 --> 2:28:31.160]  their foreheads or their hands and they had lived and reigned with christ a thousand years i mean
[2:28:31.160 --> 2:28:37.320]  they are literally setting this up well they're setting us up and it's prophetic because again
[2:28:37.320 --> 2:28:43.720]  the war that's between the children god god's children and satan's offspring was set up in
[2:28:43.720 --> 2:28:48.040]  genesis three fifteen i agree why do they love to chop our why is satan's favorite way to chop the
[2:28:48.040 --> 2:28:55.000]  head off great answer because we were created in the image and likeness of god and he hates
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:59.880]  god so much that's why they want us to wear a mask and hate ourselves and they want to chop the
[2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:04.440]  head off absolutely and and the mask is the first thing that's why i said the mask of the beast
[2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:11.320]  equals a mark of the beast and equals the murder by the beast alex here's the thing maybe people
[2:29:11.320 --> 2:29:17.480]  can understand they used to talk about someone who's headed to their execution of prison dead
[2:29:17.480 --> 2:29:27.480]  man walking we are all dead people walking unless we stand up we speak up we speak out and we do
[2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:33.400]  peaceful resistance until it's no longer peaceful they are not the mark though that we're wearing a
[2:29:33.400 --> 2:29:41.720]  mask of shame to our image that we're evil this is so satanic absolutely because again it's it's
[2:29:41.720 --> 2:29:47.400]  art look at it look what's in a smile what's in anger your face is the expression your mouth is
[2:29:47.400 --> 2:29:51.800]  what you're it's truth they don't want us registering the face because at a spiritual level
[2:29:51.800 --> 2:29:57.080]  we know that's a good person or a bad person absolutely and they want to cut off communication
[2:29:57.080 --> 2:30:03.800]  by the way the six-foot bullsheet s-h-e-e-t okay here's the thing bulls the lie the sheet and
[2:30:03.800 --> 2:30:11.080]  i'm spelling it s-h-e-e-t is what covers up the lie or what covers up our face and now they're
[2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:18.280]  they know how stupid and i'm saying this how stupid with no science modern science and and
[2:30:18.280 --> 2:30:22.440]  hundreds of years of science has been thrown out the door well i mean i have a new landed
[2:30:22.440 --> 2:30:27.320]  study saying the p-start test is totally fake unreliable and a fraud so the basis of the whole
[2:30:27.320 --> 2:30:35.960]  thing is a fraud absolutely but but again it's how many people became complacent apathetic and
[2:30:35.960 --> 2:30:44.120]  indifferent and the point is is that by conceding to evil conceding to evil we end up being subject
[2:30:44.120 --> 2:30:50.120]  to evil well let me ask you this on the timeline obviously god is god's plan but god lets us choose
[2:30:50.120 --> 2:30:54.600]  our destiny to a certain extent what do you expect to happen next as things are moving so quickly
[2:30:55.640 --> 2:31:02.440]  i expect in march things will change dramatically for the worse i suspect and here's my sources
[2:31:02.440 --> 2:31:08.840]  check it out with your sources they want a second lockdown that will be total okay we are they're
[2:31:08.840 --> 2:31:14.680]  going to claim this california version is the reason absolutely and nothing good comes out of
[2:31:14.680 --> 2:31:21.560]  california nothing good i mean think about it well i like the movies i like this gavin newson
[2:31:21.560 --> 2:31:26.920]  now has opposed to 1.25 million people trying to recall them it's going to be too late for the
[2:31:26.920 --> 2:31:32.440]  damage he's already done look at the left coast look at what happened in portland look at what
[2:31:32.440 --> 2:31:38.120]  happened in washington seattle one of the most beautiful cities in the world now it's just turned
[2:31:38.120 --> 2:31:43.080]  into uh uh you know basically shanty oh i was in seattle 20 years ago beautiful most beautiful
[2:31:43.080 --> 2:31:49.000]  city i ever saw i wanted to move there i was there two years ago a hellhole absolutely you can't
[2:31:49.000 --> 2:31:54.920]  even walk down the street and and you know like you said the bottom line is this the bottom line is
[2:31:54.920 --> 2:32:03.480]  this i i gotta keep hitting this they're coming to kill us they've already sentenced us this goes
[2:32:03.480 --> 2:32:08.360]  back to weather underground those days the population oh they admitted salty population all the massive
[2:32:08.360 --> 2:32:12.120]  deaths from covid they're trying to cover up why are they trying to burn qualmo to scare the other
[2:32:12.120 --> 2:32:18.600]  governors and also follow the orders well i think qualmo is going to be the quote throw away governor
[2:32:18.600 --> 2:32:25.000]  to to make people think see there's still justice but it wasn't just qualmo and i'm telling you this
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:30.440]  the place people want to be is where the states are going to have a second amendment sanctuary
[2:32:30.440 --> 2:32:36.280]  and i see war you ask me what i see in the future i see war against individual states
[2:32:36.280 --> 2:32:42.600]  against the globalists and by the way the word white helmets i just i'm asking i'm praying and
[2:32:42.600 --> 2:32:47.320]  i'm believing i'm going to get the document that i'll share with you so you share with
[2:32:47.320 --> 2:32:51.640]  you know we always were worried about the blue helmets how many times do you hear the white
[2:32:51.640 --> 2:32:58.360]  helmets of good guys are coming to your aid that was total misdirection or mis misdirection
[2:32:58.360 --> 2:33:04.520]  they are bringing in the foreign troops to take away the guns and ladies and gentlemen that's why
[2:33:04.520 --> 2:33:10.840]  the second amendment stands but alex there is no rule of law there is no justice there is no liberty
[2:33:10.840 --> 2:33:17.240]  and the next here's the thing forget the second lockdown i call it the kill down that's when
[2:33:17.240 --> 2:33:23.080]  they come they take us away they blow us away and i'm sorry but that's what's happening no food when
[2:33:23.080 --> 2:33:29.000]  you're in that secondary lockdown i don't know if it's six months i don't know if it's seven months
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:33.480]  but i'm telling you this too the other thing that's going to happen and i know people are seeing
[2:33:33.480 --> 2:33:37.640]  why is the government talking about aliens aliens aliens stay there let's talk about
[2:33:37.640 --> 2:33:42.280]  project bluebean and all that with steve quail who is kicking butt we'll be right back on the other

[2:34:47.160 --> 2:34:55.000]  on the globalist as negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be you have
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:35:02.760]  to understand that this is all a test this experience this life on this planet is a reckoning
[2:35:03.800 --> 2:35:09.560]  it's God giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so we can decide where we want
[2:35:09.560 --> 2:35:15.400]  to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come down to that so as
[2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:19.400]  sad as things are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the world as well and realize
[2:35:19.400 --> 2:35:26.600]  that God is the author of our consciousness God is the author of us having our own will God is
[2:35:26.600 --> 2:35:33.400]  the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing when you look at mainstream
[2:35:33.400 --> 2:35:38.840]  media in hollywood this whole evil culture and washington dc and foushee and the and the mass
[2:35:38.840 --> 2:35:43.400]  cult it's all about dominating your free will it's all about telling you you're dirty you're
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:48.120]  ugly you're in bed because satan hates you because you're made in the image of God the creator of

[2:38:04.760 --> 2:38:19.240]  the same thing i said to the guest we had on last hour who's fighting the lockdowns and the
[2:38:19.800 --> 2:38:26.280]  fake pcr test coming into canada he's all excited i'm all excited i had one cup of coffee this morning
[2:38:26.840 --> 2:38:31.320]  people say what are you on what am i on world government's here it's all being announced we
[2:38:31.320 --> 2:38:36.680]  can't be in our comfort zone we can't just go along with this we had the former head of the cia
[2:38:36.680 --> 2:38:41.720]  six years ago when he was the director of it john brennan say oh we control the weather but we
[2:38:41.720 --> 2:38:47.640]  don't want the public or other governments to know about it on c span so there's this tactic
[2:38:47.640 --> 2:38:52.440]  where they talk about this and then we try to have a debate the legislature or at the congressional
[2:38:52.440 --> 2:38:57.480]  level they go i never heard of that kitty boy what are you talking about because most of senators
[2:38:57.480 --> 2:39:03.720]  and congressmen aren't even involved in it that's why they're able to do so many incredible things
[2:39:03.720 --> 2:39:08.360]  is the scientific elite are playing god we have his book it's excellent weather wars big old
[2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:15.400]  coffee table book an unnatural disasters by steven quail available infowarstore.com just read it

[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:34.760]  i'm not trying to be desperate i'm not trying to sound alarmist you can see how crazy things are
[2:39:34.760 --> 2:39:39.480]  they're all in the news saying arrest me at the investigations made up crap uh so just pray for
[2:39:39.480 --> 2:39:42.520]  us this number one thing we need folks and i appreciate your support please support the
[2:39:42.520 --> 2:39:46.680]  local affiliates because they can't have us on air as everything we talked about came through
[2:39:46.680 --> 2:39:52.440]  let's talk about that steve quill this paradox again of everything we said is coming true people
[2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:56.920]  are really waking up and then the enemy just accelerates at cnn tucker carlson played it last
[2:39:56.920 --> 2:40:03.640]  night and said why 80 million americans have to be arrested i mean they're all who knew america
[2:40:03.640 --> 2:40:09.640]  was terrorist i mean we're rejecting the beast system so the beast starts trying to persecute
[2:40:09.640 --> 2:40:18.200]  the bible says then starts killing people well absolutely i like so here's the thing it's again
[2:40:18.200 --> 2:40:25.240]  ladies and gentlemen forget the word arrest there will be a rest but they want 125 million people
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:31.960]  murdered now my death is to hate would say how come the democrats are always saying you know we
[2:40:31.960 --> 2:40:40.120]  want to nuke us meaning literally drop atom bombs on us cut our heads off uh uh basically shoot us uh
[2:40:40.120 --> 2:40:46.200]  everything they said make war on us and and yesterday even nancy polosi was recorded she
[2:40:46.200 --> 2:40:51.480]  wants civil war i think that's the thing that people got to understand the russian revolution
[2:40:51.480 --> 2:40:59.320]  every revolution has to come into essence by armed conflicts conflict and so here here's what
[2:40:59.320 --> 2:41:05.000]  people need to get this is no longer rhetoric your apathy and your indifference will kill you
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:10.360]  how many people alex took for granted that texas would never have a snowstorm excuse me
[2:41:10.360 --> 2:41:15.400]  never have a snowstorm meanwhile all the volcanoes of the world the biggest ones in the world
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:22.360]  are absolutely going off ejecting uh particles silicon particles and other particles into the
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:30.040]  stratosphere it stays and and we're we're already suffering from a lack of sunlight chemtrails
[2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:36.120]  residue in the upper atmosphere and then you've got the gates of hell saying that well gee we're
[2:41:36.120 --> 2:41:41.800]  going to block the sun i think mike adams gave the best statement i've ever heard they want to kill
[2:41:41.800 --> 2:41:47.800]  photosynthesis ladies and gentlemen your diet for those of you who get to live will be basically
[2:41:47.800 --> 2:41:56.600]  1500 calories a day of insect-based protein if that and alex one of the things i said 25 years ago
[2:41:56.600 --> 2:42:00.280]  and this is something that's really tough for a lot of people to take i know i know that's
[2:42:00.280 --> 2:42:03.400]  what's crazy is you were the first one i ever heard you're gonna eat bugs you're gonna they're
[2:42:03.400 --> 2:42:09.080]  gonna ban beef they they're doing it all right now they're doing it all right now and and again
[2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:14.920]  two things ladies and gentlemen 25 years ago this is critical i said when the volcanoes of the world
[2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:22.760]  erupts simultaneous major volcanoes and cannibalism fills the headlines of the day i said no that
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:30.200]  tribulations are beginning tribulations and in this slide jesus said we're gonna have tribulation
[2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:37.000]  and so what's happening the church has been neutralized by wolves in the pulpit the church has
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:42.920]  been and i'm talking about believers forgive me the word church is inaccurate there's no standing
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:49.000]  up very little forgive me the majority of people in the pulpit are not standing up and speaking
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:54.760]  about the biblical revelations they're not accepting that jesus told us about this by the
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:43:00.520]  raid the book of revelation is the revelation that god gave to his servant john the apostle
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:07.400]  john who was in exile on the island of patmos it's a revelation of jesus so that leads into the alien
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:13.640]  situation people if the defense department is releasing all the uh ways that the different
[2:43:13.640 --> 2:43:20.440]  craft especially the triangle the tr3b's are those are the triangular shapes you see with three lights
[2:43:20.440 --> 2:43:25.640]  and they're talking about the alien reverse engineered which they just released and they're
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:32.120]  talking about the aliens that actual aliens are on earth and they're going to do that in six months
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:36.760]  why are they doing that i'll tell you why they're doing that they're prepping you for the fact is
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:42.920]  they're going to claim catholic church is already there that the absolute creators of the universe
[2:43:42.920 --> 2:43:48.680]  are the aliens prometheus on steroids and so i know the hollywood people and other globalists
[2:43:48.680 --> 2:43:52.920]  none of them are atheists they believe aliens made us they believe they're in contact with them
[2:43:52.920 --> 2:43:56.520]  which is really the devil and they believe that they have to do all this evil then the devil
[2:43:56.520 --> 2:44:01.000]  empower them but imagine the angels you see there's a guy in the sky comes down from the sky but
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:05.320]  but really no he's a fallen one marooned here explain that biblically for folks that don't
[2:44:05.320 --> 2:44:09.880]  understand it well first of all the bible says that there was war in heaven the devil and his
[2:44:09.880 --> 2:44:14.200]  angels fought against god and his angels and their place was not found in heaven so they
[2:44:14.200 --> 2:44:19.240]  were kicked out of heaven one third of the angels and they they live in the heavens until
[2:44:19.240 --> 2:44:25.720]  they're cast out of there's you know publicly urges their prison yep and and basically they
[2:44:25.720 --> 2:44:32.840]  have three and a half years not seven years 42 months to basically make war on the saints
[2:44:32.840 --> 2:44:38.600]  and unfortunately the saints are going to be slaughtered because they don't believe see
[2:44:38.600 --> 2:44:42.760]  this is one of the reasons people don't want to deal with bible prophecy even when it's playing
[2:44:42.760 --> 2:44:50.120]  out the four horsemen the the apocalypse you know we've seen famine we see war we see absolute at
[2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:55.080]  the but given the good news because people do wake up at the end though yeah they do wake up and
[2:44:55.080 --> 2:45:02.040]  here's the deal we're trying to wake up the people that will listen to the fact that this is all in
[2:45:02.040 --> 2:45:07.240]  motion and you know in the south they say this is fixing to get ready this is already happening you
[2:45:07.240 --> 2:45:13.320]  can't tell the people of texas god bless each and every one of you in texas i mean that seriously
[2:45:13.320 --> 2:45:19.800]  that there is that that they had your best interests in mind they don't have your best
[2:45:19.800 --> 2:45:22.760]  interests in mind one of the things that people got understand is all these people
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:27.720]  they're talking about metals i've been talking about it too that you saw with absolutely
[2:45:27.720 --> 2:45:33.320]  game stop and the whole panic in the silver and right now alex at being in that business for 35
[2:45:33.320 --> 2:45:39.720]  years the silver market is so difficult to get product the premium is huge but i'll tell you
[2:45:39.720 --> 2:45:45.960]  what's going to happen you will see the price of silver and gold go really high but it will be a
[2:45:45.960 --> 2:45:51.560]  point of this there will be none to buy none to buy look at how fedex the center in memphis
[2:45:51.560 --> 2:45:57.080]  shut down people couldn't get that and then the us mail good night with the exception of overnight
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:01.480]  you're totally right my instinct i've said for years is the time of waiting's over get to the
[2:46:01.480 --> 2:46:05.720]  country get dug in get ready uh and and don't worry about the things of the earth because
[2:46:06.520 --> 2:46:10.840]  the i mean the globalists are about to wage war and they're all slaves claus swap bill gates
[2:46:10.840 --> 2:46:16.120]  explain that these are satan slaves that they're not their own people they are driven by this force
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:20.600]  when they get to that level of satanism what happens to them well what happens to them they
[2:46:20.600 --> 2:46:25.320]  totally get demon possessed they're given over and by the way they don't call them satan they call
[2:46:25.320 --> 2:46:32.520]  them lord lucifer and they literally believe that he's god yet he demands the sacrifice of 100
[2:46:32.520 --> 2:46:37.640]  million babies he demands even the sacrifices that we've heard have taken place in the white
[2:46:37.640 --> 2:46:43.960]  house not under donald trump but even now funny business is going on funny business let me define
[2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:50.280]  funny business the whole world jesus said this the whole world lies in the evil one and people
[2:46:50.280 --> 2:46:54.120]  you're looking to your government to bail you out there no one's coming to your aid and people
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:46:58.920]  ask why does satan want to hurt children he wants to steal their essence hurt them but also get his
[2:46:58.920 --> 2:47:04.360]  minions to do such horrible things god it's the ultimate sin cuts them off so satan knows he's
[2:47:04.360 --> 2:47:09.400]  really got these people that just like an episode three of revenge of the sith uh you know written
[2:47:09.400 --> 2:47:13.400]  by george lucas cheesy movie but very accurate he says to darth vader newly admitted he said you're
[2:47:13.400 --> 2:47:18.200]  not darth vader yet they'll kill a couple hundred kids then you'll be on the dark side and he's
[2:47:18.200 --> 2:47:22.600]  first of all they want the life is in the blood of the innocence whether you call it a dino
[2:47:22.600 --> 2:47:29.240]  chrome or anything but satan demands a blood sacrifice because he feasts literally as well
[2:47:29.240 --> 2:47:35.480]  as the demons and that and i call spiritual vampires they feast on innocence the horror of
[2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:39.800]  a child being tortured in the black mass over a whole day their blood being drunk while they beg
[2:47:39.800 --> 2:47:46.440]  for mommy that is beautiful ambrosia of the satanist absolutely and again ladies and gentlemen
[2:47:46.440 --> 2:47:52.600]  it just goes back to the original religion of nimrod the tower of babel it goes back to the
[2:47:52.600 --> 2:47:58.360]  canaanites it goes back to the philistines there's always been the sacrifice innocence alex he's
[2:47:58.360 --> 2:48:04.920]  killing off the next generation we talked about population reduction we talked about uh uh basically
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:09.880]  even the infertility of the american male we're talking about excreted pharmaceuticals when i
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:14.520]  first started talking about that that all the estrogen the water from birth control pills was
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:19.800]  going to emasculate the american male people said what are you talking about and now they're talking
[2:48:19.800 --> 2:48:26.840]  about excreted pharmaceuticals but more than that even the xenoestrogens in plastic is basically
[2:48:26.840 --> 2:48:33.240]  been a chemical castrant of the absolute stay there we'll be right back five more minutes
[2:48:33.240 --> 2:48:42.360]  we'll see quail then we've got no more fake news coming up agenda 21 and agenda 2030 are all about
[2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:48.280]  making you dependent and cutting you off from energy food and medicine and with the blackouts
[2:48:48.280 --> 2:48:53.880]  we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to bring in federal and globalist control we have
[2:48:53.880 --> 2:49:01.240]  seen massive lines of people lined up at the few grocery stores and restaurants that were open and
[2:49:01.240 --> 2:49:06.120]  most of them getting turned away after hours of freezing in the cold we've seen millions of people
[2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:10.760]  sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power in their house and then running out of gas
[2:49:10.760 --> 2:49:16.520]  ladies and gentlemen energy is king and food is the energy our bodies run off of and water as well
[2:49:16.520 --> 2:49:19.720]  they're both available the highest quality water filtration and the highest quality

[2:49:37.320 --> 2:49:44.760]  desk house probably a few more days the new world order is a planetary corporate plan for world
[2:49:44.760 --> 2:49:52.600]  government but world government is only the control grid now intermembers of the cult are told
[2:49:52.600 --> 2:49:57.960]  that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality but the price for that is
[2:49:57.960 --> 2:50:05.000]  to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based line forms that's why they say carbon
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:12.360]  is bad they are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet they are playing god they believe
[2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:18.360]  they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:24.200]  to carry out this transformation i know this sounds insane but if you read the writings of the
[2:50:24.200 --> 2:50:32.600]  globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have been given the information to say no to
[2:50:32.600 --> 2:50:39.720]  this plan this is the end of all life on earth as we know it this is the alien takeover of earth
[2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:45.880]  you're listening to the alex joneshow
[2:50:52.440 --> 2:50:58.920]  it seems like yesterday all right steam quail is our guest one more segment
[2:50:58.920 --> 2:51:02.840]  that a very special report on our next segment and then john rapk working on our fake news next
[2:51:02.840 --> 2:51:08.760]  over but it was long ago all i know is we're vindicated and as negative as things are as
[2:51:08.760 --> 2:51:13.400]  sad they are we're seeing revelation beginning to be fulfilled and we've experienced spiritual
[2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:17.400]  things you've experienced that we know it's real for some people that haven't experienced that i don't
[2:51:17.400 --> 2:51:22.120]  know if they're blessed or cursed but this is all extremely real you're as serious as a heart attack
[2:51:22.120 --> 2:51:27.800]  i'm as serious as a heart attack or god struck me down this is all real in four or five minutes
[2:51:27.800 --> 2:51:33.240]  we have left what else would steam quail like to impart the folks well first of all you need
[2:51:33.240 --> 2:51:40.040]  community you need people that you can interface with and even if it's two or three people the
[2:51:40.040 --> 2:51:44.520]  problem with prepping is it's a pretty isolated thing and i want to share this with anybody
[2:51:44.520 --> 2:51:49.960]  who's got groups anybody comes in about wanting to kill this person kill that person blow this
[2:51:49.960 --> 2:51:56.440]  up blow that up those are always the plans those are always law enforcement trying to get you to
[2:51:56.440 --> 2:52:03.800]  even say something that's on record when it gets really bad ditch the helipons okay ditch the
[2:52:03.800 --> 2:52:07.800]  fracking mix and by the way alex i didn't know this but one of those famous scientists i won't
[2:52:07.800 --> 2:52:13.240]  tell you his name he's famous all over the world said you realize when you have a cell phone on
[2:52:13.240 --> 2:52:18.600]  in your bedroom or wherever you keep it if you keep it on at night put it in a separate room
[2:52:18.600 --> 2:52:25.640]  he says they have smart weapons now that basically the heliphone you talked at your ad talked about
[2:52:25.640 --> 2:52:32.920]  you know even when it's off the batteries up can act if you will as almost a homing signal for them
[2:52:32.920 --> 2:52:37.720]  to figure out where you're at it actually can make sure it's not just directing out directed
[2:52:37.720 --> 2:52:42.440]  energy they they have all sorts of weird algorithms and electromagnetic attacks the phones can launch
[2:52:43.560 --> 2:52:49.080]  absolutely so here here's the thing ladies and gentlemen the first and most important thing
[2:52:49.080 --> 2:52:57.560]  in my opinion is get right with the living god i trust i trust and and i do the word of god because
[2:52:57.560 --> 2:53:04.040]  that's the only thing that told us at the beginning what the end would be like and he who can tell you
[2:53:04.040 --> 2:53:10.440]  at the end who created all the beginning remember every time you see a mass person they are destroying
[2:53:10.440 --> 2:53:16.200]  the image and likeness of god how many of you are being told if you have sex with whoever your
[2:53:16.200 --> 2:53:21.240]  wives you're supposed to wear masks oh take this new man that said he's a woman that heads up the
[2:53:21.240 --> 2:53:29.640]  federal department of health he says let's sterilize and cut boys genitals off let's have orgies but
[2:53:29.640 --> 2:53:34.200]  men and women having sex should wear masks husband and wives are bad it's just all weird perverts

[2:54:58.440 --> 2:55:04.200]  told the people who some of the biggest politicians of the world have literally gone into the presence
[2:55:04.200 --> 2:55:10.200]  of satan's throne on earth and worshiped fallen fallen at his feet and declared their allegiance
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:15.880]  and just like an eyes wide shut they were masked absolutely and why is that ladies and gentlemen
[2:55:15.880 --> 2:55:21.320]  because it's because of that because god god made us and the enemy sees it and literally hates the
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:26.760]  space god hates our faces the woman breaks up with a man alex they can't get to the man necessarily
[2:55:26.760 --> 2:55:33.160]  so they tear up his photographs or vice versa satan is tearing up the image and likeness of the

[2:56:23.400 --> 2:56:29.800]  sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it we should but once it comes through
[2:56:29.800 --> 2:56:36.680]  once it hits us once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us we just have to point out we
[2:56:36.680 --> 2:56:42.440]  tried to stop it so prepare yourselves america you're going under judgment just like all the
[2:56:42.440 --> 2:56:58.360]  children that were to board it this is the truth this is the info war
[2:57:04.440 --> 2:57:08.760]  john rap aboard of no more fake news is set to take over here in just a few minutes
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:16.040]  but i looked at my sheet of paper wrong earlier a few hours ago and and premiered this video where
[2:57:16.040 --> 2:57:20.600]  i predicted uh what was going to currently happen in 2010 that our archive is found
[2:57:22.760 --> 2:57:28.360]  and so uh we will play this piece of important information coming up here in just a few minutes
[2:57:29.080 --> 2:57:33.560]  but i do just want to thank the listeners i want to thank the crew i want to thank everybody because
[2:57:33.560 --> 2:57:40.440]  as negative as things are this is the animating contest of liberty that thomas jevers have talked
[2:57:40.440 --> 2:57:47.640]  about and i am just as happy as a pig in manure as they say to no john rapport and no steve quill
[2:57:47.640 --> 2:57:54.600]  and no david i and to no tucker carlson and to know you and to know so many other countless people
[2:57:54.600 --> 2:58:00.280]  the good souls some got brown skin some got black skin some got pink skin white skin
[2:58:00.280 --> 2:58:05.080]  polka dotted freckled skin don't matter they got red blood and they love god and this is really
[2:58:06.280 --> 2:58:13.240]  the human race as steve quill said i am a human racist i am pro human doesn't mean i don't know
[2:58:13.240 --> 2:58:17.640]  groups have been turned against me and there are you know some people are idiots i i can differentiate
[2:58:17.640 --> 2:58:23.160]  that just like black folks who differentiate a racist white person versus a nice person but you've
[2:58:23.160 --> 2:58:27.640]  got to differentiate discriminate on whether somebody's got a connection to god or not so all
[2:58:27.640 --> 2:58:31.320]  this talk about don't discriminate it's just the globalists don't want you to discriminate in your
[2:58:31.320 --> 2:58:37.000]  car you see the road turns if you don't discriminate in turn you're gonna run off a cliff so discrimination
[2:58:37.000 --> 2:58:43.160]  is good when it comes to staying no to evil it's not good if you just judge a book by its cover
[2:58:44.920 --> 2:58:49.320]  but that's all up to you and and what path you want to follow folks all i know is things are
[2:58:49.320 --> 2:58:58.280]  getting down to the wire look at these headlines on the whole vaccination harassment it's not
[2:58:58.280 --> 2:59:03.400]  vaccination it's government and corrupt corporations with liability protection able to put in your
[2:59:03.400 --> 2:59:07.560]  body what they want and they knew it would kill a bunch people bill gates said it would so now he
[2:59:07.560 --> 2:59:13.800]  just wants to normalize we die when we do this they can't hide this anymore so they're instead
[2:59:13.800 --> 2:59:19.320]  flaunting it look at this headline y'all who knows israel adopts law allowing names of a vaccine to be
[2:59:19.320 --> 2:59:26.840]  shared whatever happened your medical records be in private oh we're gonna share it wow talk about
[2:59:26.840 --> 2:59:31.400]  bullying and again this big new lands that study came out a few days ago confirming what all the
[2:59:31.400 --> 2:59:37.240]  other studies show british journal of medicine others that it's all fake 90 plus percent fake test
[2:59:37.240 --> 2:59:44.600]  bcr france considers slowing vaccine rollout for hospital staff as many get so sick they're
[2:59:44.600 --> 2:59:52.200]  unable to work or die and it just goes on from there and then you see this empty
[2:59:54.840 --> 2:59:56.920]  thug governor clomo
[3:00:00.760 --> 3:00:05.800]  who followed orders so he could get out of this anytime saying fouchy told me who's you in control
[3:00:05.800 --> 3:00:10.360]  and try to spin it and say it's trump's fault trump wasn't in control of fouchy trump's gates
[3:00:10.360 --> 3:00:16.600]  his boy he's the u n's boy he could get out of this but he's too demonic and too stupid now it's
[3:00:16.600 --> 3:00:21.160]  over 16 000 old people like rap report said last year it was three times what they said he was dead
[3:00:21.160 --> 3:00:28.520]  on wasn't 5 000 it's 16 70 some numbers are 18 20 000 dead they covered up that's a crime alone
[3:00:28.520 --> 3:00:32.040]  and they knew the only people they could kill was old people and most of them didn't quote
[3:00:32.040 --> 3:00:37.400]  die in ammonia even the flu they were killing them in there to get the money it's only certain
[3:00:37.400 --> 3:00:42.680]  nursing homes and hospitals has happened at almost all the deaths just like conversely there's the
[3:00:42.680 --> 3:00:48.200]  good hospitals nursing homes were where like oh there's clusters all over it's always like southern
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:53.800]  baptist and christian or or black nursing homes people actually go hey we lost five percent of
[3:00:53.800 --> 3:01:00.440]  our people and they gave a shot they died so it's only certain nursing homes that will report
[3:01:00.440 --> 3:01:07.880]  what's going on the others don't do it so this is all a big evil test and it's super destructive
[3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:12.920]  but here's a video and when we play it we'll we'll show the data up front here in a moment
[3:01:12.920 --> 3:01:15.800]  maybe pause it there for a second so you can see the dates it kind of moves quickly
[3:01:16.440 --> 3:01:22.600]  of back in 2010 when i was reading operation lockstep from the rockefeller foundation
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:28.840]  july 16 2010 and then i was extrapolating what that would look like and what that would be like
[3:01:28.840 --> 3:01:35.880]  and it's exactly what happened just like i made in game it's hard to believe three years before
[3:01:35.880 --> 3:01:43.560]  that 14 years ago how do i make it i'm not john the baptist i'm not uh john the revelator no
[3:01:44.600 --> 3:01:49.960]  it's it's there you've just got to have the will to admit it to yourself so here is the report
[3:01:49.960 --> 3:01:54.040]  we're gonna post it to band up video i don't know what the headline is yet but you know watch alex
[3:01:54.040 --> 3:02:00.200]  jones predict the covid 19 lockdowns i mean i don't know what i wasn't predicting and it was right
[3:02:00.200 --> 3:02:07.080]  there here it is the alex jones show there is a war on for your mind i mean i'm not even worthy to
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:12.360]  be bringing you information that's powerful and i hope that you pay attention to what we cover here
[3:02:12.360 --> 3:02:20.600]  minute by minute because i've had chills uh since last night this just confirms everything else we've
[3:02:20.600 --> 3:02:28.680]  already researched a rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite millions
[3:02:28.680 --> 3:02:33.960]  being killed mandatory quarantines checkpoints the end of the family everything that's in the
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:37.960]  other documents but this dev tells of all the other rockefeller foundation documents about
[3:02:37.960 --> 3:02:42.920]  the gmo food sterilize you and the forced vaccines and the hell we're already living in this is
[3:02:42.920 --> 3:02:47.400]  going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen
[3:02:47.400 --> 3:02:52.600]  but that story is up on prisonplanet.com the question is will you have the courage to really do
[3:02:52.600 --> 3:02:56.840]  the research yourself because i don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:03:03.080]  these people are so arrogant that they write policy papers so many of them that they're producing
[3:03:03.080 --> 3:03:09.640]  these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all it is
[3:03:09.640 --> 3:03:15.800]  an open conspiracy against you and your family i pray to god i pray to my heavenly father jesus christ
[3:03:15.800 --> 3:03:21.160]  every night to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the
[3:03:21.160 --> 3:03:26.360]  strength to carry on because i know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and
[3:03:26.360 --> 3:03:33.160]  just want to comment on the youtube videos or on message boards and i'm a liar i know why because
[3:03:33.160 --> 3:03:40.200]  it's scary you're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore
[3:03:42.520 --> 3:03:45.400]  you're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends you're not going to be
[3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:53.080]  able to just you know go out and enjoy yourself all the time the only chance we've got of beating
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:04:00.280]  this scientific dictatorship this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you
[3:04:01.400 --> 3:04:07.960]  mentally psychologically physically spiritually the only way to defeat it is for the rank and
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:15.640]  file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be once
[3:04:15.640 --> 3:04:20.280]  you face this information once you've consciously admitted it to yourself it will take over your
[3:04:20.280 --> 3:04:29.000]  life it should take over your life i mean what else what else could it do we've got to get past
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:34.360]  the artificial stigma that the control corporate media has been putting out for decades ahead of
[3:04:34.360 --> 3:04:42.200]  their open of unveiling a planetary dictatorship they all talk about how we need a police state
[3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:47.960]  to carry this out canada and united states are going to work in lockstep display the seriousness
[3:04:47.960 --> 3:04:54.200]  of our commitment at home and abroad when losers draw you need to choose a side

[3:07:58.840 --> 3:08:04.200]  of storable food in my house but my notion has always been this is last case scenario worst
[3:08:04.200 --> 3:08:10.040]  case scenario like end of america apocalyptic type of scenario but i'm realizing now that's not the
[3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:15.320]  case folks they can shut off the power they can shut off the water at any given moment now i was
[3:08:15.320 --> 3:08:19.800]  lucky i had plenty of food in my fridge and in my pantry that i didn't have to dig into my
[3:08:19.800 --> 3:08:25.400]  storable food but many people in texas did it don't be in that situation don't have that major
[3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:29.560]  wake-up call when they come to shut down your power and they shut down the stores and the food

[3:09:06.520 --> 3:09:10.440]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:09:10.440 --> 3:09:17.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host john rapaport
[3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:36.600]  okay folks here we are our weekly chat i'm going to go back to what i was talking about last week
[3:09:36.600 --> 3:09:44.840]  and um indicate that it's a weak point of the enemy
[3:09:47.560 --> 3:09:48.600]  what do i mean by that
[3:09:50.920 --> 3:09:58.920]  they're presenting a wall of lies to the public about covet 19 about the virus about the test
[3:09:58.920 --> 3:10:07.880]  about this about that all is justification for basically imprisoning the population what they
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:15.560]  call the lockdowns we close anything we want to close when we want to close it we open it up we
[3:10:15.560 --> 3:10:21.960]  shut it down we tell you to stay indoors you can't travel you can't go to a restaurant yes you can
[3:10:21.960 --> 3:10:33.480]  no you can't putting the population completely under the gun the weak point which you can do
[3:10:33.480 --> 3:10:40.680]  something about it's not just be talking to you but you can share this information
[3:10:42.040 --> 3:10:49.560]  and lawyers who are listening can specifically do something about the weak point is the test
[3:10:49.560 --> 3:10:56.440]  the pcr test this is what i started to talk about last week i got a little ways into it
[3:10:57.240 --> 3:11:02.680]  i'm going to review that quickly and move on so that you really grasp this
[3:11:04.440 --> 3:11:12.360]  because everything is writing for them on people believing in this test for the so-called virus
[3:11:13.080 --> 3:11:18.440]  that's how they get their case numbers their death numbers that's how they justify their
[3:11:18.440 --> 3:11:26.680]  lockdowns their closure of businesses their wreckage of economies all planned nothing to do with the
[3:11:26.680 --> 3:11:39.080]  virus but it's the test so first of all this is called the pcr test it takes a very tiny tiny
[3:11:39.080 --> 3:11:45.640]  tiny sample out of the swab taken from the patient and it amplifies it or blows it up
[3:11:45.640 --> 3:11:55.560]  millions of times in what's called cycles each cycle is a quantum leap and blowing up the test
[3:11:58.120 --> 3:12:03.480]  but one of the open secrets in the testing community for decades now is that different
[3:12:03.480 --> 3:12:11.160]  labs come up with different results but just two you know you can go to one lab and the test will
[3:12:11.160 --> 3:12:19.480]  say positive meaning you're infected you go to another lab and the result of the same test would
[3:12:19.480 --> 3:12:32.680]  be negative you're not infected so here's a strategy suppose 50 people out of the entire population
[3:12:32.680 --> 3:12:42.680]  in one day went to three or four different states and got tested three or four different times
[3:12:43.320 --> 3:12:51.880]  and the results came back negative positive negative positive you sue the labs with a good
[3:12:51.880 --> 3:13:05.880]  lawyer you sue the labs because they are fronting and admittedly false medical procedure
[3:13:07.240 --> 3:13:13.960]  they're trying to destroy a person's life quarantine isolation cut off from friends
[3:13:13.960 --> 3:13:24.120]  and family etc etc etc inducing fear terror all of the above and more that's a direct strategy
[3:13:25.480 --> 3:13:31.080]  go to three or four different states right around the borders where they connect get tested where you
[3:13:31.080 --> 3:13:38.200]  know the tests are going to go to three or four different labs on the same day very close in time
[3:13:38.200 --> 3:13:44.120]  results come back positive negative positive negative sue the labs
[3:13:46.520 --> 3:13:53.080]  if you had 50 people with their clients out of a whole country doing that some amazing things
[3:13:53.080 --> 3:14:03.960]  would happen believe me the public would suddenly be shocked into a realization second point
[3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:15.720]  if the test is run at 35 cycles or higher even Anthony Fauci readily admits and we have him on
[3:14:15.720 --> 3:14:24.440]  videotape saying it the test is useless and meaningless 35 cycles what does that mean that
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:32.680]  means that from the test sample taken from the patient the test blows it up and quantum leaps
[3:14:32.680 --> 3:14:38.200]  35 times and then assesses the result either positive or negative
[3:14:41.560 --> 3:14:51.240]  so Fauci and others have admitted at 35 cycles or higher the test is meaningless useless but
[3:14:52.040 --> 3:15:00.920]  the FDA and the CDC and other public health bodies have been recommending that the test be
[3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:10.120]  run at up to 40 cycles to look for the virus that's a crime understand that's a crime because
[3:15:10.120 --> 3:15:17.960]  you're going to get a torrent a waterfall a Niagara of false positives when you go above 35
[3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:26.360]  cycles and there's a strategy for that let's say somebody's been told to take the test or order
[3:15:26.360 --> 3:15:33.320]  to take the test they find a good lawyer and they say we want a sworn affidavit from the lab
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:41.640]  as to how many cycles they're utilizing in the test if the lab refuses to give out that information
[3:15:41.640 --> 3:15:52.360]  sue them if the lab says they're running it at more than 35 cycles sue them if you had 50 lawyers
[3:15:52.360 --> 3:16:02.440]  and clients doing that the whole scene would collapse the whole program would collapse the whole
[3:16:02.440 --> 3:16:13.800]  COVID-19 hopes would collapse these are real time strategies they're not just fantasies
[3:16:15.480 --> 3:16:20.360]  so in the rest of the time today what i'm going to do is go over some of the other
[3:16:20.360 --> 3:16:27.160]  fatal flaws in the PCR test so that you can understand them for example we have from the
[3:16:27.160 --> 3:16:40.440]  New York Times august 29th 2020 an article that says your corona test is positive maybe it shouldn't
[3:16:40.440 --> 3:16:51.480]  be and in that article it clearly stated that based on a large study up to 90 percent of all
[3:16:52.440 --> 3:17:02.280]  PCR tests for COVID were false positives that indicate indicated the person was infected
[3:17:02.280 --> 3:17:14.440]  when the person was not infected up to 90 percent of all the people who had been tested understand
[3:17:17.000 --> 3:17:23.480]  now the article went on to say the remedy for this is more testing less completely insane
[3:17:23.480 --> 3:17:33.880]  obviously but that was what they said however the takeaway is that up to 90 percent of all
[3:17:33.880 --> 3:17:40.840]  people tested up to the time of that article could have been false positives but in fact
[3:17:40.840 --> 3:17:54.440]  in the early 1990s it was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's world even before
[3:17:54.440 --> 3:17:59.640]  i had an extra TV show in the mid-1990s i wouldn't call that movie and thought man that was fun
[3:18:00.520 --> 3:18:04.840]  to speak out have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd you're still entertaining because
[3:18:04.840 --> 3:18:12.280]  you're real well what do they say in Wayne's world we're not worthy we're not worthy every day
[3:18:12.280 --> 3:18:16.760]  when i cover these huge topics i don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or
[3:18:16.760 --> 3:18:20.360]  so real but i'm trying to tell you the truth i'm trying to get it right and most of the time we
[3:18:20.360 --> 3:18:26.440]  do the globalists love lying to you they love manipulating you they enjoy destroying humanity
[3:18:26.440 --> 3:18:32.040]  they enjoy manipulating ideas and and using people's ignorance against them that for me is really
[3:18:32.040 --> 3:18:38.600]  set down and disgusting so you've got to pledge for myself and the whole info worth crew that we
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:43.320]  will never join the globalist we will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in
[3:18:43.320 --> 3:18:49.560]  this together i've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there about
[3:18:49.560 --> 3:18:53.640]  looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist that the public's so dumbed down
[3:18:53.640 --> 3:18:57.080]  that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them that we're poisoning them that
[3:18:57.080 --> 3:19:02.760]  we're sterilizing them then they deserve to be killed yes that's the position of the globalist
[3:19:02.760 --> 3:19:07.480]  they play god and they think because we don't stand up they have a right to do this to us
[3:19:08.280 --> 3:19:12.680]  you know i've told you that the globalists have tried to harm me they try to get me to join them
[3:19:12.680 --> 3:19:19.080]  but metaphysically at a spiritual level i have the holy spirit i'm connection with gods and i know
[3:19:19.080 --> 3:19:23.880]  that god does not like that especially not join the enemy but i'll tell you at a selfish level
[3:19:23.880 --> 3:19:28.920]  i get very very mad at people that go along with the system believing you're part of it or
[3:19:28.920 --> 3:19:33.800]  believing you're getting power whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a
[3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:40.360]  chemistry teacher you're not god and treating other people like they're animals and you're god
[3:19:40.360 --> 3:19:47.080]  is something that the real god of the universe doesn't like and that's a fact i love the patriot
[3:19:47.080 --> 3:19:54.040]  blend wake up america coffee i just love it i can't get enough of it we've got a fresh brew
[3:19:54.040 --> 3:19:59.160]  right now that's what fills my mug that's what fills my belly that's what fills my soul wake up
[3:19:59.160 --> 3:20:05.480]  america patriot blend coffee folks we have had this coffee for years at infowarstore.com years
[3:20:05.480 --> 3:20:11.240]  never raise the price never the wake up america blend the best coffee the crew here loves it we
[3:20:11.240 --> 3:20:17.000]  drink it every day and of course that's just one of the great ways you can support info wars here
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:21.880]  everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody why not support info wars and keep the coffee
[3:20:21.880 --> 3:20:26.520]  supply at your house with the wake up america patriot blend of course read all the great reviews
[3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:31.480]  pretty much perfect review there 4.9 star when you have thousands of reviews it's uh impossible to
[3:20:31.480 --> 3:20:35.880]  have a perfect review unless literally everybody gets a five star so i mean if you have 4.9 that's
[3:20:35.880 --> 3:20:39.720]  pretty much everybody gives it a five star except maybe one or two people patriot blend 100
[3:20:39.720 --> 3:20:49.160]  percent organic coffee only available at info wars store dot com you're listening to the alex
[3:20:49.160 --> 3:21:15.160]  jones show news analysis reports it's the alex jones show and now your host john rapaport
[3:21:15.160 --> 3:21:25.080]  okay we're back here and before the break i was talking about this article in new york times
[3:21:26.280 --> 3:21:37.080]  august 29 2020 your corona test is positive maybe it shouldn't be up to 90 percent of all people
[3:21:37.080 --> 3:21:46.040]  who had been tested up to that time who registered positive would be false positives therefore you
[3:21:46.040 --> 3:21:52.840]  could just take 10 percent and say well maybe those are actual positives and if you did that
[3:21:53.400 --> 3:21:57.480]  you wouldn't have a pandemic you wouldn't have an epidemic you wouldn't have anything except an
[3:21:57.480 --> 3:22:03.960]  ordinary flu season and the whole show would be over this is in the new york times the freaking
[3:22:03.960 --> 3:22:15.560]  new york times there is more evidence i'm putting before you that the test is a fraud is a hoax is
[3:22:15.560 --> 3:22:21.960]  completely insane and those of you watching can now see on the screen this announcement from the
[3:22:21.960 --> 3:22:30.760]  state of florida governor ron desantis and his public health department who stated in december
[3:22:30.760 --> 3:22:38.120]  that they were now requiring all labs in the state of florida to report every test they do
[3:22:39.560 --> 3:22:47.640]  how many cycles they ran the test that because above 35 cycles it's meaningless why did they
[3:22:47.640 --> 3:22:53.560]  do that because they know the governor and his public health department know the fraud that is
[3:22:53.560 --> 3:23:00.680]  going on and they want to expose it they don't want to allow the enemy to suddenly be able to
[3:23:00.680 --> 3:23:07.400]  jack up these fake case numbers in the state of florida and say oh we just had 100 000 new cases
[3:23:07.400 --> 3:23:11.480]  and so we're going to have to lock down everybody no no no no no no no no no
[3:23:13.880 --> 3:23:23.960]  it's the test stupid it's the cycles stupid that's what's going on here this is such a major
[3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:32.520]  weak point in the enemy's position that if you attack it with this video this program
[3:23:33.240 --> 3:23:38.920]  with articles that have been written articles i've written reports that you've seen on infowars
[3:23:38.920 --> 3:23:47.880]  about the test the fakery of the test and this gets out far enough into the public and enough
[3:23:47.880 --> 3:23:56.040]  people wake up the show is going to collapse it's like everybody's been in the movie theater
[3:23:56.040 --> 3:24:02.920]  watching the fraud pandemic and all of a sudden the screen goes white and the movie stops and
[3:24:02.920 --> 3:24:11.080]  everybody looks around and says what the hell was that all about end of story okay so let me
[3:24:11.080 --> 3:24:21.400]  continue here with more reasons why the test is a fraud because no large study has ever been done
[3:24:22.920 --> 3:24:33.960]  of the pcr test and its ability to say if it can whether any person is sick or is going to get sick
[3:24:33.960 --> 3:24:44.760]  in the usual meaning of the word sick you know symptoms no large scale
[3:24:46.760 --> 3:24:55.560]  well-formed study has ever been done with say 500 or 1000 volunteers i don't care how
[3:24:55.560 --> 3:25:05.000]  how you want to define it as long as it's well done to prove that the test can say that anybody
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:11.160]  is sick or is going to get sick and there are ways of running such a test and i've described
[3:25:11.160 --> 3:25:20.040]  it's pretty straightforward and simple and in the end what you get is you unblind the test
[3:25:20.040 --> 3:25:27.640]  and you reveal all the volunteers after the test has been done and you see who's sick
[3:25:27.640 --> 3:25:34.760]  and who's running marathons and you know based on how their tests came out whether the tests mean
[3:25:34.760 --> 3:25:42.040]  anything or they don't mean anything and i would bet the farm that the results would be so bad
[3:25:42.040 --> 3:25:48.440]  for the test that it would be thrown out of court thrown out of labs thrown out of
[3:25:48.440 --> 3:25:58.600]  thrown out of medical societies as being a complete fraud if they ever really did such a large scale
[3:25:58.600 --> 3:26:08.200]  study of the test test the test that the test never been done never will be done why because
[3:26:08.200 --> 3:26:19.320]  it's an open secret and these criminals understand that if they expose themselves in that way by
[3:26:19.320 --> 3:26:28.520]  running a fair test of the test that they're going to be shown to be criminals predators
[3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:44.200]  hoaxers frauds no large scale study has ever been done furthermore to show that even in a
[3:26:44.200 --> 3:26:56.120]  single lab if you took one sample from one patient and you ran that sample multiple times in other
[3:26:56.120 --> 3:27:03.720]  words did multiple tests on that single sample whether the results would be uniform and the
[3:27:03.720 --> 3:27:11.320]  same every time so let's say uh no swab whatever take it down to this certified lab they don't
[3:27:11.320 --> 3:27:17.640]  know what's going on all they know is they've been ordered to run this sample and they do and then
[3:27:17.640 --> 3:27:23.960]  they're given the same sample again run the test again they don't know that again and again and
[3:27:23.960 --> 3:27:30.120]  again maybe a hundred times and then we take another patient and we do the same thing run the
[3:27:30.120 --> 3:27:36.920]  test run it again a hundred times is it going to come out the same each time for a given patient
[3:27:39.480 --> 3:27:49.640]  big study like that never been well done never been vetted how can you do that you can't accept
[3:27:49.640 --> 3:27:58.600]  if you're a criminal except if you want to foist this test on the public as they did with COVID-19
[3:27:59.480 --> 3:28:05.800]  because they knew that it would be spitting out false positives like a fire hose and that's exactly
[3:28:05.800 --> 3:28:15.160]  what they needed in order to rig and fake case numbers and say we must lock down because of
[3:28:15.160 --> 3:28:21.560]  the case numbers that's the way it's worked that's the way it is working and that's the way it'll
[3:28:21.560 --> 3:28:28.200]  keep on working until we expose the fraudsters and the predators and the criminals
[3:28:32.040 --> 3:28:41.000]  and lots of people in the scientific community know this this is not news we had a decision in
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:50.680]  the supreme court appeals court case in Portugal in November of 2020 in what had to be the best
[3:28:50.680 --> 3:29:00.200]  COVID educated court in the world that declared that lockdowns of plaintiffs in the case were
[3:29:00.200 --> 3:29:09.240]  illegal because the PCR test was a fraud the way it was being done meaning it was being done at
[3:29:09.240 --> 3:29:18.840]  too many cycles they knew that the court and they exposed it in their judgment which was published
[3:29:19.800 --> 3:29:24.600]  and ignored by major media all over the world including in Portugal
[3:29:26.680 --> 3:29:35.080]  and the court said that it was absurd to assume that the result of the PCR test
[3:29:35.080 --> 3:29:43.800]  or any test alone could determine what a case of a disease was without somebody qualified
[3:29:43.800 --> 3:29:51.080]  actually looking at the patient and seeing what symptoms the patient had that any test alone was
[3:29:51.080 --> 3:29:58.200]  not enough to say this is a case of COVID that's exactly though what's being done every day and
[3:29:58.200 --> 3:30:04.920]  every day and every way in every country in the world and the court ruled against it and said this
[3:30:04.920 --> 3:30:11.640]  was absolutely preposterous and nonsense they read the studies that they needed to read and they
[3:30:11.640 --> 3:30:19.160]  read them correctly even though they were criticized on that basis for it but they made the right
[3:30:19.160 --> 3:30:25.880]  decision and it was a landmark historical decision in Portugal I've written an article about it
[3:30:25.880 --> 3:30:35.400]  it's up today at no more fake news there's more the weakness of the enemy is in the test he'll be back
[3:30:35.400 --> 3:30:50.200]  the answer to 1984 is 1776
[3:30:58.440 --> 3:31:00.520]  info wars has been banned
[3:31:00.520 --> 3:31:03.400]  and arrested

[3:31:44.600 --> 3:31:48.520]  throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different
[3:31:48.520 --> 3:31:54.120]  mixes of the two one is born of renaissance the other is born of conquest one bases its power on
[3:31:54.120 --> 3:32:00.760]  having strong enlightened focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity art and skill
[3:32:00.760 --> 3:32:06.920]  and strength the other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite
[3:32:06.920 --> 3:32:13.560]  about it america is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[3:32:13.560 --> 3:32:18.920]  of total mass high-tech slavery that's why the globe was tell us america was founded on slavery
[3:32:18.920 --> 3:32:23.480]  when it wasn't they point out one of our evils so they can invert the facts that they are truly
[3:32:23.480 --> 3:32:28.760]  the slave masters a global permanent lockdown is here it is already causing millions and millions
[3:32:28.760 --> 3:32:33.080]  of starve to death when they're done billions will starve to death even the former head of the
[3:32:33.080 --> 3:32:37.800]  ministry of defense in england and a top general have come out and said the covered lockdown is
[3:32:37.800 --> 3:32:42.840]  going to trigger a giant new world war that's the facts this is the bill gates new world order weapon
[3:32:45.160 --> 3:32:51.800]  i knew trump was in battle i knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents
[3:32:51.800 --> 3:32:58.920]  of the enemy and a lot of people just couldn't believe it they're like oh no it's a 3g chest 5g
[3:32:58.920 --> 3:33:03.480]  chest he's invincible and i understand why people wanted to believe that because this is scary what's
[3:33:03.480 --> 3:33:07.880]  going on global government the new world order and now that people woke up the fact that's real
[3:33:07.880 --> 3:33:13.480]  they won't somebody to come save them from well trump sure as hell tried my gosh look it out prescription
[3:33:13.480 --> 3:33:18.040]  drug prices just tripled quadruple depending on the drug wants to fight and sign that executive order
[3:33:18.040 --> 3:33:22.120]  we pay the most of anybody in the world that's just one case of hundreds of things
[3:33:22.680 --> 3:33:27.400]  the trumpet reversed and now people are going to feel the sting of the pain the energy caused
[3:33:27.400 --> 3:33:32.440]  everything else but what's really illustrated this is the trial to the senate where trump's own
[3:33:32.440 --> 3:33:37.560]  lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engage in
[3:33:37.560 --> 3:33:43.320]  all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in folks the swamp is deep trump fought it but
[3:33:43.320 --> 3:33:49.240]  it's up to us to win it the people are awakening they're taking control of their own environment
[3:33:49.240 --> 3:33:54.840]  cell phones are an amazing tool really they're a supercomputer that's handheld but big tech large
[3:33:54.840 --> 3:34:01.160]  corporations hackers governments foreign governments the chikoms especially are using this to steal
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:06.440]  your data to share your data to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of
[3:34:06.440 --> 3:34:12.600]  people's data they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements cutting
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:20.040]  them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their ai takeover in their own words they admit
[3:34:20.040 --> 3:34:24.120]  so i've been selling privacy pouches and blocket pockets and things like that for more than a
[3:34:24.120 --> 3:34:28.280]  decade and now the units have gotten really lightweight they're faraday cages they just
[3:34:28.280 --> 3:34:33.560]  look like a cloth envelope they work absolutely great and it just gives you that security to have
[3:34:33.560 --> 3:34:38.840]  power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother
[3:34:38.840 --> 3:34:43.240]  to know what you're up to because it's not their business get yours at m4store.com today
[3:34:48.280 --> 3:34:54.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:54.760 --> 3:35:10.600]  okay we're back here for the last segment in this hour john rappaport here and in the wars
[3:35:12.360 --> 3:35:15.960]  i've been going over the fraudulent bcr tests
[3:35:16.680 --> 3:35:20.440]  over and there's one more element that i want to cover today
[3:35:20.440 --> 3:35:26.680]  today people have been saying for some time we're asking the question well is it possible
[3:35:27.800 --> 3:35:30.840]  that they've just relabeled the flu
[3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:39.400]  covid and people have cited numbers and with charts and graphs and stuff well look here
[3:35:39.400 --> 3:35:44.120]  the number of flu cases went way down and the number of cases went way up and so this
[3:35:44.120 --> 3:35:52.280]  looks the answer is of course that's what they've been doing of course and you don't need charts
[3:35:53.000 --> 3:36:01.640]  to explain it you just need to understand the definition of a covid case and a definition
[3:36:02.280 --> 3:36:11.240]  of a flu case they overlap in fact a mild what's called a mild case of covid 19
[3:36:11.240 --> 3:36:17.480]  is flu symptoms cough chills and fever
[3:36:20.040 --> 3:36:27.240]  there you have you can be diagnosed with covid 19 with a positive pcr test and i've shown
[3:36:27.240 --> 3:36:39.720]  how easy that is to obtain a false positive and a cough or chills and fever which are
[3:36:39.720 --> 3:36:46.120]  obviously symptoms of flu or flu like illness or the common cold
[3:36:47.880 --> 3:36:57.800]  so what's the problem there isn't any for them they just switch they say okay let's call the flu
[3:36:57.800 --> 3:37:04.280]  covid 19 oh we wouldn't do that a million years of course they're doing it all the time because
[3:37:04.280 --> 3:37:12.680]  they've got the definition in front of them i'm just paraphrasing the cdc definition of a mild
[3:37:12.680 --> 3:37:21.960]  case of covid cough or chills and fever accompanied by a positive pcr test if you happen to be
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:27.960]  living in an area where there are people who have tested positive which everybody is
[3:37:27.960 --> 3:37:37.720]  living in such an area now it's all you need there's the fraud what else do you need to know
[3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:46.520]  it's by definition okay it's not some oh very sophisticated trick here's how we're going to
[3:37:46.520 --> 3:37:52.360]  do it with the algorithm and the thing and the computer program that goes inside out and upside
[3:37:52.360 --> 3:38:00.840]  down and before you know it your brain is turned no it's just as simple we take this
[3:38:01.800 --> 3:38:13.160]  over here and we switch it over there switch switch by definition always look at the definitions
[3:38:13.160 --> 3:38:22.440]  of these so-called diseases i started out doing that 1987 with the cdc's definition of AIDS and
[3:38:22.440 --> 3:38:31.320]  i found it was like 15 pages long it was almost nothing that couldn't be shoved into a diagnosis
[3:38:31.320 --> 3:38:44.600]  of a case of AIDS it's the same now rearranged the same exact deal now so that's another yet
[3:38:44.600 --> 3:38:52.120]  fraudulent use of the pcr test ah we know we can get false positive here so boom you're positive
[3:38:52.120 --> 3:39:01.000]  mr jones and you have a cough covid 19 you're positive mr smith you have chills and fever
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:04.200]  and a positive pcr test your case of covid 19
[3:39:07.480 --> 3:39:16.520]  there you go there you go so the question always is
[3:39:19.080 --> 3:39:22.440]  are people who are learning this information
[3:39:22.440 --> 3:39:37.000]  doing popcorn entertainment wow this is interesting yeah and it moves the adrenaline a little bit
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:46.840]  you know as you're sitting there listening or watching yeah okay or is it also motivating you
[3:39:46.840 --> 3:39:57.000]  to take action that's to make breakpoint folks that's what information is all about
[3:39:59.400 --> 3:40:07.880]  there is a thing an actual thing called critical mass of information it's real i've seen it operate
[3:40:07.880 --> 3:40:10.200]  in many different venues over the years
[3:40:10.200 --> 3:40:20.200]  if enough people are aware of the facts and the truth about something a point is reached
[3:40:20.200 --> 3:40:26.040]  where unpredictable things begin to happen and those unpredictable things are good
[3:40:28.040 --> 3:40:34.200]  they are on the side of liberty and freedom and individual power
[3:40:34.200 --> 3:40:39.400]  or they're on the side of what good people want
[3:40:41.960 --> 3:40:49.240]  so are you going to share this information in the form of say this video which it will
[3:40:49.240 --> 3:40:53.080]  become in a few minutes on band dot video at info wars
[3:40:55.080 --> 3:40:59.160]  i'm going to look at some of the articles that i've posted written at no more fake news about
[3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:07.880]  the test and share those are you going to become a transfer of the truth
[3:41:09.960 --> 3:41:20.360]  your own media outlet so to speak an email list a bigger list you compile you send it out
[3:41:21.800 --> 3:41:26.760]  sure you're going to get no answers from some people rejections from other people so what
[3:41:26.760 --> 3:41:30.440]  who cares you know you just keep doing it anyway
[3:41:32.920 --> 3:41:41.320]  if enough people had already been doing this over the last year on a number of issues and
[3:41:41.320 --> 3:41:50.520]  insanities and crimes being committed in the name of pandemic regulations we wouldn't be where we are
[3:41:50.520 --> 3:41:57.880]  now so it's up to you what you decide to do it's up to you
[3:42:02.600 --> 3:42:11.720]  liberty and freedom are never gone they're always there because they're part of you
[3:42:11.720 --> 3:42:19.800]  they're part of every individual that impulse can never be destroyed
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:36.520]  which is why the enemy has to take such sustained and heavy action over a period of time long long
[3:42:36.520 --> 3:42:44.520]  time in order to try to wipe liberty and freedom out and they can't do it but they're not going to
[3:42:44.520 --> 3:42:56.920]  stop trying they can sit on it they can put an iron boot on a face on many faces they can
[3:42:57.640 --> 3:43:03.880]  poison people with injections depopulate they can do all kinds of things but they can never
[3:43:03.880 --> 3:43:15.320]  destroy liberty and freedom in you in you and in every individual but this is about you
[3:43:16.840 --> 3:43:23.800]  so in a very real sense it doesn't matter what you think or what i think in terms of
[3:43:24.440 --> 3:43:27.480]  will liberty and freedom go away they don't ever go away
[3:43:27.480 --> 3:43:36.040]  you see that's the problem because if they could be wiped out then people could just go around
[3:43:36.760 --> 3:43:44.760]  with a complete amnesia and say what difference does it make what happens we're just animals
[3:43:44.760 --> 3:43:53.080]  living in a corral we're just biological machines that have no existence beyond the physical it
[3:43:53.080 --> 3:44:01.000]  doesn't matter how much repression is brought down in our heads because you know freedom i don't
[3:44:01.000 --> 3:44:07.880]  even know what that means so what who cares we just live and then we die and that's it that's all
[3:44:07.880 --> 3:44:24.120]  there is but that isn't so and the knowledge that is it isn't so is alive in you some and it's not
[3:44:24.120 --> 3:44:36.520]  going away that's the rub my friends that is the rub that's what causes a person to feel what he
[3:44:36.520 --> 3:44:49.400]  feels when he knows the truth but does nothing about it that's what causes the sensation of wait
[3:44:49.400 --> 3:44:57.160]  a minute now i don't know i'm not feeling right here because liberty and freedom do not go away
[3:44:57.160 --> 3:45:06.520]  they're always there in you so if you do nothing you know you're doing nothing
[3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:21.080]  and that's the rub so the question is always are you going to purvey and spread the truth
[3:45:21.080 --> 3:45:37.000]  or not we're ready here for permanent lockdown as far as the enemy goes but we're not going to do that
