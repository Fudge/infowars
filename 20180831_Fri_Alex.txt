[00:00.000 --> 00:03.600]  An emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas and U.S. resistance
[00:03.600 --> 00:07.440]  missed a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China
[00:07.440 --> 00:11.360]  allied with the big mega banks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:11.360 --> 00:15.680]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:15.680 --> 00:18.800]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood. The Communist Chinese have taken
[00:18.800 --> 00:22.480]  control of the main universities. This is all confirmed. This is not a drill.
[00:22.480 --> 00:26.640]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:26.640 --> 00:31.600]  They've officially become state-run Apple 100%. Google is now making the transition
[00:31.600 --> 00:36.800]  and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship. They are now beta testing using
[00:36.800 --> 00:41.200]  me as the straw man. A demonized version of Alex Jones to do that. This is happening.
[00:41.200 --> 00:46.000]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.120]  Thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it. Now this attack is thousands
[00:51.120 --> 00:57.200]  and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks. This is a titrated dose.
[00:57.200 --> 01:03.520]  Reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[01:04.320 --> 01:08.160]  In layman's terms they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[01:08.160 --> 01:13.840]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression. Now when the mega ton hits us
[01:13.840 --> 01:19.120]  of the total takeover we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's
[01:19.120 --> 01:25.040]  a lethal dose if we accept the dose. Total Internet of Things integration global social
[01:25.040 --> 01:30.240]  score complete command and control system. It is the virtual reality AI platform system
[01:30.240 --> 01:34.960]  now attacking the United States with traders inside the major security agencies blocking
[01:34.960 --> 01:39.600]  Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the
[01:39.600 --> 01:44.560]  Chai Con slash Big Tech begging combine emergency situation. I have been chosen for destruction
[01:44.560 --> 01:49.440]  because I brought you this information and have been battering ramming it out as much as I can.
[01:49.440 --> 01:54.800]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[01:55.440 --> 02:00.560]  where every angle of my good is turned against us so they take what I've said being sincere
[02:00.560 --> 02:05.040]  building into an insincere person in the straw man. I'm a person that cares about life and
[02:05.040 --> 02:09.600]  children and is against these wars and so they make me a herder of children and then they build me
[02:09.600 --> 02:14.720]  into this line to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a
[02:14.720 --> 02:20.800]  debate about Alex Jones so even if I didn't sell out to them they now use me as an archetype to
[02:20.800 --> 02:27.120]  serve them by being the main distraction. I have now been captured by the enemy in the information
[02:27.120 --> 02:32.320]  warfare program and it's being used against you only your full understanding of this key will
[02:32.320 --> 02:41.200]  break you free from this paradigm. I have given you the transmission, now break free!
[02:41.200 --> 02:48.800]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the
[02:48.800 --> 02:57.360]  mind of man, Thomas Jefferson. If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance.
[02:57.360 --> 03:05.600]  As you probably heard recently many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated
[03:05.600 --> 03:10.160]  effort to censor content from broadcaster Alex Jones. They're never going to remove him,
[03:10.160 --> 03:15.680]  that's crazy, that's too far. This isn't about Alex Jones, this is about freedom.
[03:16.400 --> 03:21.680]  Trump's election and Alex Jones' popularity are merely symptoms of a corrupt and failed status
[03:21.680 --> 03:28.960]  quo. You have about 800 million followers, that's why you're banned. Social media censorship.
[03:28.960 --> 03:34.160]  Virtually every day the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions they disagree
[03:34.160 --> 03:40.960]  with. Facebook's censor off-repeats and saying all the ones that don't even see that we have been
[03:40.960 --> 03:45.760]  censored. For many on the left the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them prevent
[03:45.760 --> 03:50.880]  them from speaking. They broke their algorithm to try to steal the selection. Now they're down to the
[03:50.880 --> 03:56.800]  left corners of the internet. Oh no, conservatives can speak to one another, we must shut it off.
[03:56.800 --> 04:01.120]  People know what's true, they can smell it, you can't stop them from knowing that.
[04:02.800 --> 04:08.960]  That's right ladies and gentlemen, you won. We won. We won the battle for truth, we won the battle
[04:08.960 --> 04:14.720]  for information and all they have left is their brainwashed minions in the streets,
[04:14.720 --> 04:22.960]  their brainwashed leftists, their cultists and their group think. And they are now trying to
[04:23.920 --> 04:31.280]  mold and morph and manipulate the internet so that their false consensus that everybody
[04:31.280 --> 04:36.640]  hates Trump, everybody hates America, everyone wants to live in a world where everything's racist.
[04:36.640 --> 04:45.680]  That's what they're trying to push, but you won. They lost so they have to erase you off the playing
[04:45.680 --> 04:52.640]  field. Don't let them continue to spread the links, continue to go out in the real world in the 3D realm
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.600]  and talk about info wars, talk about the truth, have conversations with people.
[05:00.240 --> 05:05.920]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here
[05:05.920 --> 05:11.440]  in Leilani estates, but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned
[05:11.440 --> 05:18.560]  about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[05:18.560 --> 05:25.280]  the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals,
[05:25.280 --> 05:30.720]  alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
[05:30.720 --> 05:37.200]  metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[05:37.200 --> 05:43.040]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to
[05:43.040 --> 05:49.120]  optimal levels. As it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water,
[05:49.680 --> 05:55.280]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:55.280 --> 06:06.880]  But more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it. Waging war on corruption.
[06:06.880 --> 06:14.400]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war and now your host
[06:14.400 --> 06:24.480]  Owen Troyer. Are the globalist reeling right now? Yes! Is America having a rejuvenation economically,
[06:24.480 --> 06:34.320]  spiritually? Yes! Are you having a victory right now in the fight for truth and liberty? Yes!
[06:35.040 --> 06:38.800]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show. Filling in for Alex Jones today, I'm Owen Troyer. We will be
[06:38.800 --> 06:44.400]  hearing from Alex Jones today in the third hour. Dr. Nick Begich hosts the fourth hour. We're going
[06:44.400 --> 06:48.560]  to have a lot of exciting things to talk about with him. Roger Stone is going to be joining
[06:48.560 --> 06:54.000]  the show in just 30 minutes. Breaking news coming about Roger Stone's situation right now when it
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.320]  comes to the Mueller probe. We're going to get the exclusive from Roger on that shortly. Will
[06:58.320 --> 07:04.640]  Johnson from United America first joins me at 12.30. He has just been censored off Facebook.
[07:04.640 --> 07:12.480]  You will not believe why. Now, before we get to the great broadcast today and all the news and
[07:12.480 --> 07:21.440]  our great guests, last night President Trump held a rally in Indiana and every Trump rally seems to be
[07:21.440 --> 07:30.880]  bigger and better than the one before. And while it seems to be redundant for the audience to tune
[07:30.880 --> 07:36.800]  in to every Trump rally that he's going to be doing three a week now soon, it really is incredible
[07:37.360 --> 07:45.440]  to listen to Trump speak, see the energy in the crowd, feel the energy in the crowd, feel the
[07:45.440 --> 07:53.440]  momentum in America changing, feel the status quo changing, feel and see the people getting the
[07:53.440 --> 07:57.920]  power back. Maybe not necessarily as much as we need to have the power of the government, but the
[07:57.920 --> 08:03.600]  power to know what's going on, the power to be informed, which is what they're trying to stop
[08:03.600 --> 08:07.040]  right now by censoring info wars and other conservatives on the internet. But listen to
[08:07.040 --> 08:12.720]  President Trump last night as he is well aware of what's going on. He's warned the tech giants
[08:12.720 --> 08:18.720]  what you're doing is illegal. He's even pushed it so far as to say it's a very antitrust situation.
[08:18.720 --> 08:23.520]  We're going to cover all that news, but listen to President Trump last night addressing big tech
[08:23.520 --> 08:31.280]  censorship at his rally in Evansville, Indiana. Importantly, my administration is also standing
[08:31.280 --> 08:41.440]  up for the free speech rights of all Americans free speech rights. Look at social media. It's
[08:41.440 --> 08:49.440]  a thing called free speech rights. You look at Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media
[08:49.440 --> 08:58.080]  giants. And I've made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship,
[08:58.080 --> 09:03.920]  blacklisting and rigged search results. And you know, it can go the other way also.
[09:03.920 --> 09:15.520]  We will not let large corporations silence conservative voices. And it can. It can go
[09:15.520 --> 09:22.720]  the other way to someday. It can play little tricks with them. We're not going to let them control
[09:23.680 --> 09:29.760]  what we can and cannot see, read and learn from. We can't do that.
[09:29.760 --> 09:38.640]  And America is a free country. And we are going to stay always a free country.
[09:40.960 --> 09:48.640]  We're defending American values. And we're also defending our great American interests
[09:48.640 --> 09:54.160]  all over the world. And President Trump again, going on the bully pulpit
[09:54.160 --> 10:02.320]  right now, doing these rallies, endorsing candidates, conservative candidates that
[10:02.320 --> 10:07.680]  are running for Congress, running for governor. It looks like in Indiana, you're going to have
[10:07.680 --> 10:13.200]  Donnelly unseated. A Democrat is going to be unseated in the upcoming midterm elections
[10:13.840 --> 10:17.280]  by the guy that Trump endorsed last night. Of course, I can't remember his name right now.
[10:17.280 --> 10:24.000]  But President Trump going and doing these rallies is such a game changer because
[10:25.680 --> 10:34.560]  it energizes his base unlike anything else. A sound clip on TV doesn't quite do it like
[10:34.560 --> 10:39.840]  Donald Trump live for an hour off the teleprompter, off the cuff, telling it like it is.
[10:39.840 --> 10:50.320]  And what scares them honestly, Trump is one angle. A president of the United States that
[10:50.320 --> 10:56.560]  they can't control. Yes, that scares them. But millions and millions and millions of Americans
[10:57.280 --> 11:04.480]  seeing the truth, seeing the censorship, seeing the authoritarian nature of the tech left,
[11:04.480 --> 11:11.600]  seeing the traitorous nature of the Democrat Party, and then having it highlighted
[11:12.960 --> 11:17.040]  and then hammered by President Trump when he does these rallies with tens of thousands of people
[11:17.040 --> 11:25.200]  in the audience, where he has a speaker come up and the speaker says, wow, thank God, President
[11:25.200 --> 11:31.280]  Trump kept us from Hillary Clinton and the entire crowd chants, lock her up for 60 seconds.
[11:31.280 --> 11:38.000]  That's America. That's the American people coming back. That's what has the globalist
[11:38.000 --> 11:44.640]  scared. And just like for us, now they're never going to tell you this, but just like we realize,
[11:44.640 --> 11:49.760]  if they take out Alex Jones, they take out everybody. If they take out Alex Jones,
[11:49.760 --> 11:55.280]  they take out free speech. Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists and the deep state understand
[11:55.280 --> 12:04.080]  for them, the same formula applies to Hillary Clinton. If Hillary Clinton goes down, if the
[12:04.080 --> 12:11.920]  crimes of Hillary Clinton go public and she goes down and even to jail, they're all going down.
[12:12.640 --> 12:18.480]  So that is the nexus point that we have reached. That is the juxtaposition
[12:18.480 --> 12:26.160]  that we are now at in the allegory of life. We understand on our side of things,
[12:26.880 --> 12:33.040]  if they take out Alex Jones and make an example of Alex Jones to censor free speech, free speech
[12:33.040 --> 12:39.600]  is dead. If we can bring justice down on Hillary Clinton, if we can arrest Hillary Clinton for
[12:39.600 --> 12:45.280]  all the crimes that she's committed, all the crimes of the shadow government and the deep state
[12:45.280 --> 12:51.600]  are next and they know it. So just like Alex Jones for them is the first domino to fall
[12:52.480 --> 12:58.640]  in the line of censorship against free speech, Hillary Clinton will be the first domino to fall
[12:58.640 --> 13:05.360]  in the line of total criminality by the government, the shadow government, by the globalists,
[13:06.320 --> 13:11.360]  and by the people that are trying to censor us right now. And the first test case of censorship
[13:11.360 --> 13:16.480]  is Alex Jones. That's right, Owen, and we've got some big special reports coming up the third hour.
[13:16.480 --> 13:21.200]  Dr. Nick Beggis joining us. I'm working on a bunch of big news here behind the scenes, but
[13:21.200 --> 13:27.920]  this is a real civil war by pro-American forces and the globalist forces inside this country. This
[13:27.920 --> 13:32.080]  is history. We're not embellishing. The president knows what's going on. He's involved. He's
[13:32.080 --> 13:36.640]  listening directly to you. Thank God for DrudgeReport.com, helping punch info wars through directly
[13:36.640 --> 13:41.280]  to the president. I know the president's gotten my reports and my information directly repeated
[13:41.280 --> 13:46.640]  and I'll leave it at that and Drudge gets it directly to him. You all get it directly to him
[13:46.640 --> 13:50.720]  and now he's talking about the shadow banning, the censorship, everything. One reason I came in
[13:50.720 --> 13:55.360]  here, Owen, is because I never plug in this second segment and we're going to win against
[13:55.360 --> 13:59.920]  these Soros funded lawsuits and the rest of this garbage because we've told the truth and what the
[13:59.920 --> 14:03.920]  media puts out is fraud. But I'm going to tell the listeners again right now, you know this is
[14:03.920 --> 14:08.160]  history. You know info wars is paying off for your children's future, for your liberty, for your
[14:08.160 --> 14:12.960]  second amendment, for your religious freedom. You know we're the Americans just like you. You
[14:12.960 --> 14:18.400]  know we're on the front line. So we need your financial supported info wars store.com on this
[14:18.400 --> 14:23.120]  Friday like never before to commit to go sign up for auto ship for any of the great supplements,
[14:23.120 --> 14:27.040]  the great coffee, things you're going to want to reorder, get a t-shirt, get a book, whatever.
[14:27.040 --> 14:31.440]  I know you've been doing it, but I want to thank you now for recommitting because we will defeat
[14:31.440 --> 14:36.240]  the enemy if you increase the amount of funds coming in here. In fact, if just a few percentage
[14:36.240 --> 14:42.000]  of you more start purchasing products, we can basically unless they kill me are unstoppable.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.840]  And I've already got plans to set up all sorts of other emergency backup systems. In fact,
[14:45.840 --> 14:49.520]  some of them are already in place that are even outside of my control. I'm going to leave it and
[14:49.520 --> 14:53.760]  I'm working with world leaders. And I don't want to brag about this, but I'm working with world
[14:53.760 --> 15:00.240]  leaders, world leaders, not just the president. I mean directly with household names in Europe
[15:00.240 --> 15:04.320]  to do some major stuff. Okay, that's why they're coming after me. They've got my phones tapped.
[15:04.320 --> 15:08.400]  They know what we're doing. We're really making a run at the enemy. So I don't want to ever brag
[15:08.400 --> 15:12.960]  about stuff because that would draw the enemy in to know they know now. Okay, they know we're
[15:12.960 --> 15:17.760]  planning to take the whole damn planet back. Okay, we're against the eugenicist. We want a pro-human
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.320]  future. We are Renaissance individuals and we are going to go till the end, no matter what they do,
[15:22.320 --> 15:26.400]  but they're coming after us because we are the opposite of George Soros. You understand?
[15:27.200 --> 15:31.600]  But I need massive funding to launch operations that they've held us back six months on.
[15:31.600 --> 15:36.400]  The enemy has successfully stopped us here
[15:37.280 --> 15:41.120]  on the front. We need to move forward with a major offensive and I need capital flooding
[15:41.120 --> 15:44.800]  infowarstore.com. Now I'm going to judge it this weekend off of what happens today,
[15:44.800 --> 15:48.320]  how much I'm going to expand to face the enemy. You want us to fight hard? Do it now.

[18:10.880 --> 18:16.880]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.520 --> 18:23.600]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.600 --> 18:28.960]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[18:28.960 --> 18:35.040]  trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[18:35.040 --> 18:40.720]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is
[18:40.720 --> 18:45.920]  not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[18:45.920 --> 18:51.120]  activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[18:51.120 --> 18:57.600]  in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack
[18:57.600 --> 19:07.440]  of our pollen block chewable tablets. The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen,

[20:20.000 --> 20:26.160]  From the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[20:26.160 --> 20:31.440]  and now your host, Owen Shroyer. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[20:32.720 --> 20:40.960]  this is a big broadcast for multiple reasons. Tons of big news to cover. President Trump is
[20:40.960 --> 20:46.400]  hitting the fake news harder than he ever has before. You should have heard his speech last night
[20:46.400 --> 20:55.760]  in Evansville, Indiana. President Trump is hitting the tech giants harder than ever before,
[20:57.120 --> 21:03.280]  saying that they are skating on thin ice. They're flirting with anti-trust law violations, and
[21:04.160 --> 21:08.640]  they're not going to censor free speech in this country. But that's not stopping them, is it?
[21:09.520 --> 21:15.440]  No, it's not. No, it's not. In fact, they keep doing it. In fact, I'm working on getting guests
[21:15.440 --> 21:19.520]  all lined up. I can't even believe it, man. New people are telling me they're getting blocked
[21:19.520 --> 21:26.560]  every day. Every day. You get people getting blocked for sharing FDA.gov documents talking about
[21:26.560 --> 21:30.800]  vaccines. They get blocked for sharing actual government documents. Will Johnson got blocked
[21:30.800 --> 21:36.800]  off Facebook. He's coming on at 12.30. You won't believe why. Fulcrum News. David Seaman. They're
[21:36.800 --> 21:43.760]  banished. They're gone. The list just goes on and on and on. Of course, Alex Jones, myself,
[21:43.760 --> 21:53.520]  David Knight, Roger Stone, Milo Yiannopoulos, and on and on, and Diamond and Silk, and Ron DeSantis,
[21:53.520 --> 22:01.840]  and Devin Nunes, and Jim Jordan. And it just goes on and on and on. But you've got death threats
[22:01.840 --> 22:06.960]  to Trump every day. I get threats every day. Roger Stone gets threats. Alex Jones gets threats.
[22:06.960 --> 22:14.000]  I mean, we get threats. We don't even cover it. Paul Joseph Watson. I don't even cover it. But
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.960]  they're allowed to exist. I covered yesterday the ACLU attorney certified by Twitter says,
[22:18.960 --> 22:25.200]  you know, F white people. White people are bad. Yeah, that doesn't violate Twitter's terms of
[22:25.200 --> 22:30.640]  service. Oh, but if a white conservative said black people were bad, yeah, kicked them off immediately.
[22:31.520 --> 22:35.680]  Again, it's a double standard. And they say, oh, it's hate speech. This is not about hate speech,
[22:35.680 --> 22:42.880]  folks. This is 110% about political speech. This is 110% about trying to move the Overton window.
[22:44.880 --> 22:50.320]  Confirm their false consensus that there's a blue wave coming and everybody hates Trump.
[22:50.320 --> 22:54.400]  And it couldn't be more opposite the reality of the situation.
[22:57.920 --> 23:00.960]  No, Trump is probably the most popular president ever.
[23:00.960 --> 23:07.520]  Yeah. No, the blue wave is not even a splash.
[23:11.280 --> 23:14.720]  And so they don't want you to know what's actually going on.
[23:16.960 --> 23:21.760]  This is from the Hill. Trump says to Google Facebook, Amazon, they may be in a very
[23:22.560 --> 23:26.080]  possible antitrust situation. Oh, oh, they are.
[23:26.080 --> 23:30.800]  Trump has even said it's illegal, folks. They're playing chicken with Trump. Do you understand
[23:30.800 --> 23:36.960]  how everything comes down to these midterms in 67 days? See, the tech giants think they can get away
[23:36.960 --> 23:44.000]  with this because they're actually getting high on their own extra. I mean, I'm sorry to give you a
[23:44.960 --> 23:49.360]  kind of disgusting analogy here, but they're literally getting high off of their own feces,
[23:49.360 --> 23:54.080]  folks. They're they're they're crapping in their own hands and getting high off the fumes.
[23:54.080 --> 23:58.560]  They really think a blue wave is coming. So they're doubling down on the censorship,
[23:58.560 --> 24:02.880]  and then they think that when the blue wave comes, they'll impeach Trump, and they won't be
[24:02.880 --> 24:06.960]  under threat anymore of looking at antitrust lawsuit violations.
[24:08.320 --> 24:12.800]  But guess what? The blue wave is not coming. Hillary didn't get elected. You're all high
[24:12.800 --> 24:20.320]  off the fumes of your own crap. So double down on the censorship, double down on your belief that
[24:20.320 --> 24:27.520]  there's a blue wave coming and watch the red wave drown you. That's what's going to happen,
[24:27.520 --> 24:34.720]  and Trump is going to hit you with every antitrust lawsuit in the books if you don't cut this out
[24:34.720 --> 24:41.440]  before the midterms, which you're still going to lose. They don't get it, folks. They already rigged.
[24:41.440 --> 24:48.080]  They rigged the 2016 presidential elections. Do you understand this? They already censored
[24:48.080 --> 24:52.880]  conservatives on social media. They were already censoring Alex Jones. They just didn't delete
[24:52.880 --> 24:59.680]  him. So even though they already rigged social media, they already rigged the elections in
[24:59.680 --> 25:06.720]  2016, they still lost. And so now they're doubling down. They're doubling down on the fake news.
[25:06.720 --> 25:11.760]  They're doubling down on the censorship on social media, and it's not going to work. You know what
[25:11.760 --> 25:22.480]  happens when you double zero? You still get zero. Zero. So that's why we have to get out and be
[25:22.480 --> 25:27.760]  informed and vote in the midterms in 67 days to make sure the Democrats don't take back the house.
[25:27.760 --> 25:31.760]  It doesn't look like they have very good odds to take back the Senate, but they do believe they can
[25:31.760 --> 25:37.760]  take back the house. I don't think so. But if they do, they will try to remove Trump, and they'll try
[25:37.760 --> 25:43.760]  to do everything they can to try to end America as we know it. But I don't see that coming.
[25:43.760 --> 25:48.960]  In fact, I see the opposite coming. And I think that once November comes and they lose in the
[25:48.960 --> 25:55.120]  midterms, it's game on. Trump is already slow. See, Trump is kind of sitting there in the ring,
[25:55.120 --> 25:59.840]  just kind of unwrapping his hands, taking the gloves off like, you sure you want to keep
[25:59.840 --> 26:06.320]  censoring, huh? Yeah, I saw you were censoring Mike Pence there. I saw you were censoring Will
[26:06.320 --> 26:12.480]  Johnson. I saw you guys totally removed Alex Jones. So Trump's just taking the gloves off,
[26:12.480 --> 26:18.080]  removing his tape, saying, oh yeah, notice you guys were censoring me on Twitter. Oh yeah,
[26:18.080 --> 26:24.000]  noticed you guys were throttling back my live views on YouTube and Facebook. You guys sure
[26:24.000 --> 26:31.280]  you want to keep doing that, huh? Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube. Boy, I think you guys
[26:31.280 --> 26:35.840]  are guilty of some campaign finance. You guys want to keep doing that? And they're just watching
[26:35.840 --> 26:43.040]  Trump remove the gloves and they think it's some sort of joke or they're going to have him removed.
[26:43.040 --> 26:46.720]  And so he's removing the gloves, he's taking his time and the midterms are coming up.
[26:48.800 --> 26:53.200]  And then everything comes down to the midterms. And then that becomes the flash point.
[26:53.920 --> 26:57.360]  And everything that follows is a result of what you see here.
[26:57.360 --> 27:08.160]  So that's what's all going on. And in the meantime, Roger Stone coming up in the next segment,
[27:09.200 --> 27:13.920]  he says he expects to be charged with the crime next in this Mueller campaign. Of course,
[27:13.920 --> 27:18.560]  that comes from NBC News. That could be total fake news. They could be taking Roger out of context
[27:18.560 --> 27:24.880]  or just making that up. But it is linked on Drudge and we're going to be hearing from Roger Stone
[27:24.880 --> 27:34.480]  in the next segment. But just look at how ridiculous they are. Yeah, yeah. Oh, by the way,
[27:34.480 --> 27:39.040]  that same NBC News that printed that story that we'll see if it's fake news or not when Roger
[27:39.040 --> 27:44.400]  Stone joins me in the next segment. They're leading the front of Drudge right now because
[27:44.400 --> 27:50.800]  it's now come out that NBC News censored the Me Too movement. That's right. Ronan Farrow,
[27:50.800 --> 27:56.240]  who was really the journalist that kind of broke all of this open, they censored Ronan Farrow's
[27:56.240 --> 28:04.880]  Me Too reports. Of course, wasn't it NBC News that had Matt the Rat Lauer? That was NBC News,
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.520]  right? I can't remember if it's NBC or CBS. They're like one and the same. But the point is,
[28:10.080 --> 28:15.440]  NBC threatened Ronan Farrow if he kept reporting on Harvey Weinstein. Why is Harvey Weinstein
[28:15.440 --> 28:22.560]  protected? All of the disgusting treatment towards women that Harvey Weinstein has engaged in,
[28:22.560 --> 28:27.520]  but NBC and the globalists and the deep state are rushing to his defense. Why is that? Oh,
[28:27.520 --> 28:33.680]  why is that? Because he's friends with the Clintons. Because he's a Democrat donor to the tunes of
[28:33.680 --> 28:38.480]  millions of dollars over time. That's why they're protecting Harvey Weinstein. Don't you get it?
[28:38.480 --> 28:47.200]  You're allowed to rape women, assault women, abuse women, take advantage of women, insult women.
[28:47.200 --> 28:51.920]  You can do anything you want as long as you're a good liberal. You can do anything you want
[28:51.920 --> 28:56.000]  under the sun as long as at the end of the day you hate America and you're a good liberal. You
[28:56.000 --> 29:02.880]  can get away with anything. Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature,

[30:56.560 --> 31:03.040]  it, so we need your support. We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together
[31:03.040 --> 31:08.560]  with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us
[31:08.560 --> 31:13.200]  through Mother Nature to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic
[31:13.200 --> 31:19.280]  Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from
[31:19.280 --> 31:23.760]  nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[31:23.760 --> 31:29.520]  It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[31:29.520 --> 31:34.720]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you
[31:34.720 --> 31:39.360]  can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of
[31:39.360 --> 31:45.200]  this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[31:45.200 --> 31:50.400]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
[31:50.400 --> 31:54.640]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[31:54.640 --> 31:59.760]  we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and infowarslife.com.
[31:59.760 --> 32:05.200]  We knew it was coming. The whole thing was for me leg. First demonize info wars, lie about us,
[32:05.200 --> 32:10.960]  build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube
[32:10.960 --> 32:16.800]  and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia. And then voila,
[32:16.800 --> 32:23.760]  two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in
[32:23.760 --> 32:31.680]  the top five or top 10 news feeds. Go to infowars.com, forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast,
[32:31.680 --> 32:36.400]  just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[32:36.400 --> 32:41.360]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and give us your emails so that
[32:41.360 --> 32:46.000]  we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform. But
[32:46.000 --> 32:51.280]  whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com, forward slash show, how they can download the free
[32:51.280 --> 32:56.400]  Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out
[32:56.400 --> 32:59.280]  this is the verboten info. This is what they don't want you to see.
[32:59.280 --> 33:05.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:12.480 --> 33:18.960]  We now take you live to the central Texas commenced every and the heart of the resistance.
[33:18.960 --> 33:21.680]  And now your host, Olin Troyer.
[33:21.680 --> 33:33.280]  And if you were in Evansville, Indiana last night, the home of the aces, you heard thunder.
[33:35.280 --> 33:42.880]  Tens of thousands of people filling arenas, chanting USA, lock her up and other such
[33:42.880 --> 33:51.920]  patriotic hymns as President Trump begins his campaign tour to help save America during the
[33:51.920 --> 33:57.920]  midterm elections and then again in the 2020 presidential election. Now, Roger Stone, my
[33:57.920 --> 34:04.160]  cohost on the war room from three to six p.m. weekdays at infowarsshow.com joins me next.
[34:05.040 --> 34:11.600]  And it's the same story, but they refresh it to try to continue the narrative that that Roger
[34:11.600 --> 34:18.800]  Stone is doomed or guilty, even though he is guilty of no such violations that they're trying to
[34:18.800 --> 34:23.840]  attach to him. So the NBC news story that's linked on Drudge says Trump pal Stone says he expects
[34:23.840 --> 34:30.160]  Mueller to charge him with a crime. But I want Roger to clarify this and to explain exactly
[34:30.160 --> 34:36.560]  where his head's at and the fake news that's out there about him. So Roger, thanks for joining us.
[34:36.560 --> 34:42.720]  I'm great to be here, Owen. You know, there's nothing new in this story. There's nothing that
[34:42.720 --> 34:49.920]  I haven't said right here at infowars, literally four months. When 12 of my current or former
[34:49.920 --> 34:57.120]  associates have been dragged in front of FBI interrogation, when at least four and perhaps
[34:57.120 --> 35:07.680]  more of my associates have testified for the grand jury, it's not unreasonable to expect
[35:07.680 --> 35:13.200]  that Mueller is up to something. But to be categorically clear, he has no evidence of
[35:13.200 --> 35:20.000]  Russian collusion. He has no evidence of collaboration of any kind with WikiLeaks. I never
[35:20.000 --> 35:27.360]  received allegedly hacked emails and passed them on to Donald Trump. That's a MSNBC, R.E. Melbour
[35:27.360 --> 35:33.120]  fairy tale. No evidence that I knew about the acquisition or publication of John Podesta's
[35:33.120 --> 35:40.000]  emails in advance. That's a falsehood as well. But we know, as Alan Dershowitz has said, the
[35:40.000 --> 35:46.720]  average American inadvertently commits four felonies a day and that a runaway federal prosecutor
[35:46.720 --> 35:54.480]  with unfettered power and literally no oversight and no rules can literally indict a ham sandwich.
[35:54.480 --> 36:01.680]  So when I go out and I prepare based on their terrorizing my many friends and associates,
[36:01.680 --> 36:08.400]  by the way, asking virtually every one of them about Alex Jones and infowars, what am I supposed
[36:08.400 --> 36:14.480]  to expect? I can tell you right now what my crime is, Owen. I figured it out. I'm guilty
[36:14.480 --> 36:20.960]  of supporting Donald Trump for president, of defeating Hillary Clinton. Those are my only
[36:20.960 --> 36:26.960]  crimes and I've had no choice but to prepare. I've already spent over a half million dollars
[36:26.960 --> 36:34.560]  on legal fees beating back these harassment lawsuits by the DNC and Obama directed left-wing
[36:34.560 --> 36:41.200]  front group. They seek to destroy me financially. They want to ruin me so I can't fight back.
[36:41.200 --> 36:45.200]  That's why I had to set up a legal defense fund at stonedefensefund.com.
[36:46.000 --> 36:51.280]  They'd like to make it hard for me to raise money, but I continue to soldier onward.
[36:52.320 --> 36:58.320]  Well, and as you said, Robert Mueller has no oversight. I mean, he's totally out of control.
[36:58.320 --> 37:04.640]  He's a rogue prosecutor. He's above the government operating above everything right now. And just
[37:04.640 --> 37:12.560]  to clarify, so people understand, all of Donald Trump's past associates who also happen to be,
[37:12.560 --> 37:18.720]  well, not all, but many of Trump's past associates, many of which happen to be Roger Stone associates,
[37:18.720 --> 37:22.960]  too, are all being looked at. They're all being investigated. They're looking at their emails.
[37:22.960 --> 37:28.000]  They're trying to bring them in. So one can only reason to believe that Roger Stone is next up.
[37:28.000 --> 37:35.280]  But interestingly enough, and I don't know how much you want to put into this, Roger, but Rudy
[37:35.280 --> 37:41.120]  Giuliani is putting together a counter report to question Robert Mueller's legitimacy. I don't
[37:41.120 --> 37:46.080]  know if you trust Rudy Giuliani in this matter or not, or if you think this is the right thing to
[37:46.080 --> 37:52.400]  start doing. But to me, if there's going to be no oversight on Mueller, well, maybe we should just
[37:52.400 --> 37:59.040]  launch an investigation on Mueller then. I mean, maybe that's the answer. Look, I am a, I'm a big
[37:59.040 --> 38:04.880]  supporter of Rudy Giuliani. Rudy Giuliani is a wartime conciliary. He is head in the shoulders
[38:04.880 --> 38:10.080]  above the attorneys who represented the president previously, who were lulled into a false sense
[38:10.080 --> 38:15.520]  of security when Robert Mueller assured them if they just turned over everything voluntarily,
[38:15.520 --> 38:23.440]  this matter would be resolved last year. Obviously, Mueller lied. Now, the time for reports is past.
[38:23.440 --> 38:29.680]  It's a time for action. In all honesty, Mueller has every intention of subpoenaing the president if
[38:29.680 --> 38:36.080]  he needs to to try to trap him in some kind of obstruction of justice or perjury or some other
[38:36.080 --> 38:42.960]  process crime. The courts have held that Mueller's appointment is constitutional because he has the
[38:42.960 --> 38:49.200]  oversight of two officials, one elected and one appointed by an elected official. Those would be
[38:49.200 --> 38:55.200]  Donald Trump and acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The problem with that is, Owen, both
[38:55.200 --> 39:02.080]  Trump and Rosenstein are at a minimum witnesses or more specifically deeply involved in the facts
[39:02.080 --> 39:07.920]  regarding the very matter that Mueller is investigating, including the Comey firing where
[39:07.920 --> 39:13.600]  Rosenstein wrote the underlying memo telling Trump how and why Comey should be fired and freaked out
[39:13.600 --> 39:20.000]  when that memo became public and his deep state buddy found out that Rosenstein was a weasel who
[39:20.000 --> 39:26.000]  was double dealing him. And then, of course, it was Rosenstein who signed the extension of the
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.480]  phony Faisal warrants that were both illegal and unconstitutional. And the president is clearly
[39:32.480 --> 39:38.880]  a target. So somebody who is a target and somebody who should be a target, but at minimum our witnesses
[39:38.880 --> 39:46.240]  cannot have oversight in the case at hand. Therefore, Mueller's investigation is hopelessly
[39:46.240 --> 39:53.600]  compromised. Don't issue reports, Rudy. Don't study fire. Fire, Mueller, fire Rosenstein,
[39:53.600 --> 39:58.880]  fire Jeff Sessions. That would be a pleasure. And clean house at your justice department.
[39:58.880 --> 40:04.080]  This is a speeding bullet heading directly for the president's head. Stop talking about,
[40:04.080 --> 40:09.920]  I might get involved, I should get involved, get involved today. That would be my advice. Now,
[40:09.920 --> 40:16.800]  some would say, well, that advice is self serving. But Owen, it's the Trump presidency that is at
[40:16.800 --> 40:22.880]  stake. And now that we know that Bruce Orr, the Justice Department official under Obama,
[40:22.880 --> 40:30.560]  was briefing Andrew Weisman, the hit man, the pit bull for Robert Mueller, the conflict of
[40:30.560 --> 40:37.520]  interest is abundantly clear. Mr. Mueller and Mr. Weisman, it's time to go. Well, if you look at
[40:37.520 --> 40:46.320]  the, let's say, evolution of this Mueller probe, I think its original intentions, which were to
[40:46.320 --> 40:52.560]  destroy Donald Trump in the public eye, in the media, acting like this Mueller probe is legit.
[40:53.680 --> 40:58.720]  You know, maybe even using the Mueller probe to remove Trump or some of his officials or,
[40:58.720 --> 41:05.600]  but again, to me, the whole thing was to just have this aura over Trump in the media and with
[41:05.600 --> 41:10.800]  the Mueller probe that he's bad, he's guilty of whatever. To me, that was the original intent.
[41:10.800 --> 41:16.880]  But now, Roger, I think it's evolved into new levels because of all their involvement with
[41:16.880 --> 41:22.000]  the illegal spine. You know, it's one thing for these government officials to get away with all
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.800]  the illegal activity they did during the Obama years. I think that they felt comfortable in
[41:26.800 --> 41:31.120]  all of their illegality. But now that Trump is president and he's called it out and now they've
[41:31.120 --> 41:35.680]  all been exposed, I think the Mueller probe has reached new levels. Now they're trying to protect
[41:35.680 --> 41:41.200]  their own hide, perhaps from major jail time here because of all the crimes they committed under
[41:41.200 --> 41:46.640]  the Obama administration that he either ordered them to commit or turn the other head at. So to
[41:46.640 --> 41:52.880]  me, the Mueller probe has gone from an offensive to get Donald Trump to now a defensive, oh boy,
[41:52.880 --> 41:58.320]  I hope Donald Trump doesn't get us. Well, you're absolutely right. I think it becomes abundantly
[41:58.320 --> 42:03.840]  clear that the whole rushing collusion investigation is meant to divert us from the extraordinary
[42:03.840 --> 42:10.880]  crimes in violation of the Constitution, the spying and manipulation of the election process by the
[42:10.880 --> 42:18.160]  Obama FBI and the Obama Justice Department, and the deep crimes of Mr. Mueller himself, 9-1-1,
[42:18.160 --> 42:27.920]  BCCI, the Interacts, and so on, those on and on. So you're absolutely right. These people realize
[42:27.920 --> 42:32.560]  that if they don't put Donald Trump in jail, that they themselves are going to end up in jail. And
[42:32.560 --> 42:39.280]  that's the real issue. And I think that right now we're looking at a situation and Trump feels like
[42:40.800 --> 42:46.800]  I mean, folks, if the average American that's that's that's got their head and Kim Kardashian's
[42:46.800 --> 42:52.720]  boobs and Tom Brady's butt, if the average American knew what was going on in this country,
[42:52.720 --> 42:56.080]  they really would panic. I mean, that I think that there's a level of this where Trump just
[42:56.080 --> 42:58.640]  doesn't want to send the average American into a panic because they're so ignorant.

[46:58.560 --> 47:11.680]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[47:11.680 --> 47:30.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[47:30.560 --> 47:33.360]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[47:33.360 --> 47:41.680]  Roger Stone. If you're following the news, you know that special counsel Robert Mueller has me
[47:41.680 --> 47:47.920]  in his crosshairs. At least eight of my current or former associates have been interrogated by the
[47:47.920 --> 47:54.320]  FBI. At least four of them have been dragged before the grand jury. But Mr. Mueller has no
[47:54.320 --> 48:00.160]  evidence of rushing collusion, WikiLeaks collaboration or any advanced knowledge of the
[48:00.160 --> 48:07.600]  acquisition and release of John Podesta's emails. Instead, he seeks to silence me and to turn me
[48:07.600 --> 48:13.920]  against the president, as he did Michael Cohn. I have no intention of flipping on Donald Trump,
[48:13.920 --> 48:19.760]  but I face financial ruin and bankruptcy for my family in this epic fight. Please,
[48:19.760 --> 48:26.320]  I'm really the fight, but I need to know that you have my back. Go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[48:26.320 --> 48:27.520]  I need your help.
[48:27.520 --> 48:32.880]  That's Roger Stone, my co-host on the war room from 3 to 6 p.m. Central Weekdays at
[48:32.880 --> 48:38.400]  infowords.com. We are here filling in four Alex Jones on the Alex Jones show. And of course,
[48:39.120 --> 48:45.680]  you've got Roger Stone right now under the microscope with this Mueller investigation
[48:45.680 --> 48:50.400]  because of his great crime of supporting Donald Trump and being a patriot and loving America.
[48:50.400 --> 48:55.440]  That is Roger Stone's biggest crime is being a good American patriot. But while there's one
[48:55.440 --> 49:01.760]  form of trash that looks like Robert Mueller, there's another form of trash that takes the
[49:01.760 --> 49:08.560]  shape of a quote-unquote journalist that works for the Wall Street Journal named Shelby Holiday.
[49:09.200 --> 49:14.880]  This is not one of Roger Stone's favorite journalists. She also goes on TV and spouts
[49:14.880 --> 49:19.600]  her fake news. Roger, would you like to address the latest garbage coming out of Shelby Holiday?
[49:20.160 --> 49:24.400]  Yeah, I'm afraid I have to. You know, when I've been in American politics for 40 years,
[49:24.400 --> 49:29.760]  I've worked for four American presidents. I've had dealings with literally hundreds of mainstream
[49:29.760 --> 49:34.880]  media reporters. There are many that I have real respect for. There are many who I believe are
[49:34.880 --> 49:40.400]  just honest men and women trying to do their job, trying to get the facts straight and report them.
[49:41.040 --> 49:48.800]  And then there Shelby Holiday, the single most odious, duplicitous, dishonest, and self-absorbed
[49:48.800 --> 49:55.040]  reporter in the mainstream media. Now, Shelby Holiday reached out to a veteran reporter for
[49:55.040 --> 50:01.360]  the National Enquirer claiming that I was the source of the National Enquirer's story regarding
[50:02.080 --> 50:09.760]  Ben Carson and some medical malpractice issues, or Ted Cruz and his string of girlfriends,
[50:09.760 --> 50:16.720]  when in fact I was the source of neither one of those stories. But when Shelby Holiday was told
[50:16.720 --> 50:22.800]  by this veteran reporter that she didn't want to talk and she hung up, Holiday called her back.
[50:23.360 --> 50:28.720]  And then when she hung up again, she called her back again. But when they finally spoke,
[50:28.720 --> 50:34.960]  Shelby Holiday spoke over the reporter when she attempted to deny what Shelby Holiday had already
[50:34.960 --> 50:41.600]  decided were the facts. This woman is a blight upon the earth. She's a piece of human garbage.
[50:41.600 --> 50:48.880]  But above all, she is not in any way a journalist or a reporter. She's up there with Brian Stelzer,
[50:48.880 --> 50:56.000]  one of your real favorites, Owen. She's in that league when it comes to lies and disinformation.
[50:56.000 --> 51:03.760]  There she is, folks. Shelby Holiday, the epitome of fake news. Brian Stelzer doesn't appreciate that,
[51:03.760 --> 51:08.400]  Roger. But I've got a little Shelby Holiday article right here from the Wall Street Journal.
[51:08.400 --> 51:11.680]  You know what we do to fake news, Roger? What do we do to fake news? We rip it.
[51:14.400 --> 51:17.360]  Yes, indeed. This one's for you, Shelby.
[51:19.520 --> 51:24.880]  Fake news, not a journalist. Crime back in your hole. Stop harassing reporters who are
[51:24.880 --> 51:32.000]  far better journalists than you are. We're here at the Alex Jones show and we're laying it out.
[51:32.000 --> 51:38.400]  Next Monday on The War Room, Owen and I are going to expose the five worst journalists in the
[51:38.400 --> 51:44.160]  mainstream media. That's right. And it's a heavy competition to pick the five worst. I think we've
[51:44.160 --> 51:50.480]  already identified two. One would be Shelby Holiday. The other one would be Brian Stelzer.
[51:50.480 --> 51:57.280]  But who will vie for those highly coveted other three positions as the worst mainstream media
[51:57.280 --> 52:02.960]  journalist in America? Tune into The War Room on Monday at five o'clock Eastern to find out
[52:02.960 --> 52:10.320]  who wins these coveted awards. Wow. I'm just racking my brain right now, Roger. That's going
[52:10.320 --> 52:14.400]  to be a tough one. And again, just to clarify, actually, this Monday is Labor Day. So it'll be
[52:14.400 --> 52:20.880]  Tuesday. Tune in Tuesday. Yeah, that's right. Roger doesn't take holidays. So he doesn't think
[52:20.880 --> 52:26.400]  about holidays. He's always working. But man, I mean, fake is people in news. Shelby Holiday.
[52:26.400 --> 52:30.400]  You know, Roger, and I'll just say this, I mean, I know that that I can be really aggressive and
[52:30.400 --> 52:34.480]  loud. And you could even say maybe I have an ego or all this stuff. But you know, the one thing
[52:34.480 --> 52:39.040]  that I try not to be that people like Shelby Holiday and a lot of these other journalists are
[52:39.040 --> 52:45.280]  is an arrogant snob. You know, I never want to come off as an arrogant snob. And if I ever do,
[52:45.280 --> 52:49.600]  I hope that someone would tell me. But to me, when I see Shelby Holiday on TV, it's just an
[52:49.600 --> 52:55.520]  arrogant snob. I know I'm the only one that knows nobody else knows anything except me.
[52:55.520 --> 53:02.000]  That's what I get from people like Shelby Holiday. And it's just like, no, I want to remind you of
[53:02.000 --> 53:09.280]  this. When I when I was accused of dining with Julian Assange, which I had said in an email to
[53:09.920 --> 53:16.320]  Sam Nunberg, the psychopath who worked for Donald Trump to get to get him to stop calling me.
[53:16.320 --> 53:22.000]  And then I produced the airline tickets, the hotel receipt, the restaurant receipts that
[53:22.000 --> 53:27.360]  showed I was in Los Angeles on the days that Shelby Holiday said I was dining with Assange.
[53:27.920 --> 53:34.160]  Holiday actually said on MSNBC, well, maybe his dinner with Assange was over Skype.
[53:34.960 --> 53:40.880]  Really? You're a journalist? Climb back in your hole, Shelby. You are a disgrace to the profession
[53:40.880 --> 53:47.120]  of journalism. That idea is so laughably ridiculous that you only embarrass yourself.
[53:47.120 --> 53:52.080]  Boy, when you when you're when you're in the same classification of fake news with a Brian
[53:52.080 --> 53:57.280]  Stelter and a Don Lemon, which is where Shelby Holiday lands herself now. That's a tough hole
[53:57.280 --> 54:01.840]  to climb out of. All right, Roger, I've got another subject I want to discuss with you before you
[54:01.840 --> 54:07.920]  depart with us here. And that is the John McCain saga. Now, I'm not asking you to get into your
[54:07.920 --> 54:13.040]  opinions on McCain or anything, you know, let the dead rest. But I will ask you this.
[54:13.040 --> 54:22.480]  Because I'm a little confused by this. I have never seen ever, ever anyone's death covered
[54:22.480 --> 54:28.960]  like John McCain's. He has been his services have extended for 72. He's got 72 hours worth of
[54:28.960 --> 54:34.480]  services. He's flying around on like Air Force One jets. He's got like 10 different ceremonies.
[54:34.480 --> 54:39.280]  They're all publicly on television. It's all McCain's the hero, everything about McCain.
[54:39.280 --> 54:47.120]  What I'm sorry, have you ever seen a national coverage of a dead senator like this? I mean,
[54:47.120 --> 54:51.840]  I remember Reagan dying. I remember there's been other people that died. There wasn't five days
[54:51.840 --> 54:56.080]  worth of TV events. There wasn't 10 different ceremonies and everything celebrating their
[54:56.080 --> 55:01.680]  life and times. How is it John McCain gets this great coverage? Eight years ago, he was the enemy
[55:01.680 --> 55:05.440]  of the liberal media. And now all of a sudden they love him. I mean, have you ever seen anything
[55:05.440 --> 55:10.560]  like this, Roger? Yeah, you know, even Ronald Reagan, who's probably the greatest president
[55:10.560 --> 55:14.880]  of my lifetime, his funeral and death did not merit this kind of phone.
[55:14.880 --> 55:20.960]  It got 24 hours. Ronald, I remember it. Reagan's death got 24 hours and the ceremonies and they
[55:20.960 --> 55:27.040]  moved on. Yeah, so this is easy to explain. McCain is a man who moved from the right to the left.
[55:27.040 --> 55:32.240]  And therefore they hated him when he was a conservative. But now that he's a liberal and
[55:32.240 --> 55:39.200]  undermining Donald Trump, they have to deify him. Look, my opinion of John McCain is well known.
[55:39.200 --> 55:45.200]  The fact that he partied with the Russian oligarch Daripaska and a group of young Russian
[55:45.200 --> 55:52.400]  prostitutes for his 70th anniversary on Daripaska's yacht, despite the fact that as John Salomon
[55:52.400 --> 56:00.080]  has reported at the Hill, the FBI warned McCain that Daripaska was an agent for Putin,
[56:00.080 --> 56:07.040]  but he met with him anyway. But now is not the time. I'm not going to step into this breach
[56:07.040 --> 56:13.520]  because our critics want to accuse us of speaking ill of the dead. So I wish him Godspeed.
[56:13.520 --> 56:19.200]  May he rest in peace. The day to dissect his transgressions in politics and in government
[56:19.200 --> 56:25.280]  is on another day. But I think most Americans see through this fronting coverage in which people
[56:25.280 --> 56:31.440]  who hated John McCain's guts when he was in public office step forward and talk about what a great
[56:31.440 --> 56:37.280]  man he was. Well, and again, you know, I won't go into our opinions on John McCain. We'll let
[56:37.280 --> 56:43.600]  your comments lie there and we'll move on. But again, I'll just say this. The coverage that
[56:43.600 --> 56:47.520]  McCain's death is getting is unprecedented to anything I've ever seen. He was even bigger
[56:47.520 --> 56:52.800]  than Michael Jackson's death, which was a huge TV event. And it's like, since when is John McCain
[56:52.800 --> 56:58.480]  some media darling? He used to be most one of the most hated men in media. And it's just incredible
[56:58.480 --> 57:02.640]  to me that this is going on. And you know, it's also it's like when he was in charge of that
[57:02.640 --> 57:07.040]  committee for releasing the prisoner of war records from Vietnam, you know what he did?
[57:07.040 --> 57:11.360]  He didn't release them. He snuffed them. He threw them in the trash because he didn't want people
[57:11.360 --> 57:15.280]  to know about his own history. But you know what? I digress. John McCain may he rest.

[59:56.320 --> 01:00:13.120]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today and now your host Owen Troyer.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:31.040]  You know, anybody who knows me knows that I monitor and follow news like a fiend.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:40.480]  Maybe I am a news fiend. So I'm just a little perturbed honestly. I'm just a little perturbed
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:47.920]  as to why John McCain's death has been the main story on television news now for four days.
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:57.920]  So the day he died it was the biggest story and then the day after he died it was about how he was
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.720]  he was dividing America from the grave insulting Trump from the grave and then the two days after
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:11.520]  that it's been all John McCain ceremonies and funerals he's flying around on big bowing jumbo
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.600]  jets having his casket moved he gets to have an American flag over his casket even though he's
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:21.280]  responsible for thousands of Americans dying I mean it's all just absurd to me you know what
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:27.120]  I don't even know if I can do this guys I was going to come on here and do a troll
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.280]  basically like praising John McCain for all his war crimes but it's really just so sick I really
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.800]  can't even joke about it to be honest with you yeah let me joke about how John McCain you know
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:45.840]  the story goes he did his wet start on the USS Forester I think he damaged like seven of the
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:51.520]  the jet aircraft that was on the deck he may have even killed or wounded many of his uh
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:58.320]  fellow fellow military men I mean it just it it's really just sick and they say oh well
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.880]  don't you know he was a prisoner of war well now wait a second don't you know that it was
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:11.680]  John McCain who censored and deleted and trashed when the Vietnamese were going to send over the
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:17.440]  prisoner of war records so that the other American soldiers families that had prisoners of wars uh
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.160]  prisoners of war over in Vietnam could find out the truth about what happened to their family members
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.200]  what happened to them what their fate was if they died if they were tortured everything
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:34.480]  you know who stopped the families from getting those reports John McCain do you know why because
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:41.120]  John McCain's time as a prisoner of war is not what you think it is see so I can't even do it I
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:47.280]  can't even do the troll guys I'm sorry I can't even do it so as I would just need a I would just
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:52.960]  need a bullet a bullet point list I can't just read these stories here but here's what I'll say
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:03:04.960]  I think that I think that America seeing John McCain as a turncoat against Trump
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:12.160]  the leader of the democrat party with an R behind his name really woke people up to who John McCain
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:22.960]  was a fraud then after that level of illusion was removed people started to peel through the layers
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:28.960]  and they find out wait a second this John McCain who were claiming was a war hero maybe not so much
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:34.880]  actually was very very dangerous when he was a pilot flying jets responsible for multiple
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:40.880]  crashes many deaths of his comrades then you find out when he was a prisoner of war he received
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:47.840]  special treatment in fact you can even go listen to his audio the vietnamese recorded John McCain
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:53.760]  on tape when he was a prisoner of war praising the vietnamese thanking them telling you how great
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.560]  they were do you know what the other prisoner prisoners of war do you know what happened to
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.840]  them no he shouldn't be in heaven you guys should have flames behind him let's get a flaming graphic
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:12.000]  behind McCain do you know when John McCain the vietnamese said John tell the american people
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.320]  how great we are he did it he said the vietnamese are great people they're treating me great you can
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.280]  read it's it's it's even recorded the transcripts are out the audio is out do you know what happened
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:26.800]  to the other prisoner of prisoners of war that they did that too they spit in their face they said
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:32.800]  I'm not going to tell you you're great America is great I'm loyal to America they died McCain said
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:39.200]  screw America I love Vietnam he lived he got special treatment and then he erased the records
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:44.240]  of the prisoners of war so that you wouldn't know the truth about him but guess what John we do
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:50.160]  know the truth about you your own audio that you tapes praising the vietnamese leaked and then you
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.520]  erased the records so no the people are sick of John McCain's funeral it's not a three-day funeral

[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:25.520]  three straight days what a joke but you know what in all seriousness okay in all seriousness guys
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:34.880]  i think that this tv coverage of john mccain and the forced praise of john mccain and the forcing of
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:41.200]  john mccain going down in history as an american hero and a patriot i think that's actually going
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:45.840]  to turn america off i think the third straight day of the mccain funeral ceremonies is going to make
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.960]  americans say okay you know what f this guy still haunting this country from the grave
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:11:00.640]  can't he just go away unbelievable all right let's refresh guys let's take it down i think
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:06.240]  i've said my piece i can't take any more another mccain funeral today oh you know who mccain was
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.720]  was really close with who said just the nicest things about mccain on on television in the last
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:30.000]  few days david portray us oh oh is that chuckie schumer chuckie you know what you know what
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:37.360]  we have to say it i'm not mad at i'm not mad at these people for going through the ceremonies
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:42.640]  and doing the whole fake thing for john mccain i get it i get it but you know what
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:50.320]  this is why info wars exist folks because we have to we have to tell you the unpleasant truths
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:59.120]  we have to take you into the the discomfort zones so so if so i so we'll report it i'll
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.080]  report the truth about mccain unabashedly and i won't regret it because no one else will
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:13.360]  know john mccain did not deserve these ceremonies by my by my measurement in fact i'll even go to
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:19.120]  the full extreme i don't believe john mccain deserved to have the american flag on his coffin
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:29.200]  yeah yeah no it's fine i'll be the one to say it it's all right it's okay we'll be the ones to
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:36.400]  say it no one else will say it i get it let the dead rest well what about all the dead people
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:44.480]  because of mccain what about mccain meeting with isis in syria you know what i almost want to
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:52.160]  believe the q theory that john mccain received the death penalty for treason if you believe the q
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.600]  conspiracy theories that's what q says i almost want to believe that because it probably is what
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:03.600]  should have happened i see i shouldn't even it's just it's just why why are they forcing mccain down
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:09.280]  our throat as his hero they hated mccain when he ran again this is what i'm saying do you not remember
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:15.760]  when mccain ran against obama if mccain was such a hero if mccain was this media darling if mccain

[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:33.760]  ladies and gentlemen there's good news and there's bad news and you're well aware of it all
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:40.480]  the bad news is that right now the tech giants in silicon valley are doing everything they can to
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:45.120]  try to censor the truth and you know we keep saying censor free speech and that's kind of a
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:50.960]  buzzword free speech you know first amendment but i think we need to change our messaging
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:56.480]  because it doesn't really hit home enough and i think it's kind of become a numbing effect oh
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:59.520]  censor free speech censor free speech first amendment first amendment it doesn't really
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:04.400]  have the power that it used to have where i think if we change our messaging and we say the tech
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:10.320]  giants in silicon valley are trying to censor the truth because that's ultimately what's going on
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:16.240]  they are making it impossible for you to red pill people on the internet they don't want people
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:21.840]  being red pilled on the internet because look what happens changes the world that's what happened
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:28.480]  in the last four years on the internet red pills galore and it changed the course of human history
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:36.480]  so now they have to put in a internet beta blocker to make sure no red pills are able to make it out
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:44.080]  on the internet of course alex jones the ultimate red pill depository ban and so that's where we're
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:51.600]  at but the good news the good news is that we have infowarstore.com and we have an audience
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:57.440]  that supports us at infowarstore.com and that's good news for us and that's good news for the truth
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:03.360]  and that's good news for free speech and the good news for you is that the products at infowarstore.com
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:09.440]  are the real deal and i've got a lot of the products just laid out for me right here on the desk this
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:15.600]  is probably maybe 15 percent of our supplements that i have here before me maybe maybe less than that
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:21.920]  so this is just a brief introduction of the supplements that we have at infowarstore.com
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:30.320]  the ultimate bone broth formula very popular this is a supplement craze bone broth that is really

[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:52.000]  a with the regular price of the bone broth the ultimate bone broth of infowarstore.com the regular
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.720]  price at $39.95 is already the best price out there that you're going to find for a bone broth
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:06.080]  formula that is so powerful but we didn't stop there we cut it in half this is absurd so now

[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:37.520]  $50 minimum for a bone broth formula that you could maybe compare this to ingredient wise

[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:44.720]  america first is where you can find a lot of his content but as we're talking about the censorship
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:51.760]  on social media coming out of the last segment will johnson has recently been what were you
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.480]  banned will or were you just putting time out on facebook we'll get into why in a second but
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:00.080]  but what is your current status i believe it's on facebook where they're censoring you know
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:07.200]  yes i've been banned for 30 days because i said black people are not monkey
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.400]  so so so it's bad if you say monkey even though you're not talking about black people
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:18.480]  but then if you say black people are not monkeys that's that's even worse and you get banned
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:25.360]  exactly exactly and i was just making a point that the gentleman in florida making a statement
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:30.800]  about monkeying around the same statement obama said the same statement chuck schumer said the
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:38.240]  same statement diane feinstein said but because he said it he's a republican it's racist and then
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:42.560]  you have doesn't make any sense seriously though seriously like let's let's try to get to the bottom
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:48.160]  of this i mean this this is totally mentally deranged people right i mean this there's no logic
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:53.920]  here i mean they can't actually believe this when don lemon goes on um the lemonhead ten watt
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:35:00.320]  light bulb news on cnn and he says look at the dog whistling that they're doing to the racist when
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:06.560]  he says monkey angela rye says this is no longer dog whistling this is a foghorn so they're obviously
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:11.520]  getting their talking points from the democrat party but but do they actually do you think they
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:17.360]  actually believe this will do you think they really believe that ronda santus said the phrase
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:23.280]  monkeying around do they really believe he said that to signal to white people that hey this is a
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:28.960]  racist anti-black candidate do you think they really believe that no they don't believe that
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:34.480]  they're just using this as a tactic to attack him to attack any republicans and try to demonize them
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:40.240]  as racist white people running in in the white are trying to run for position in any political
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:45.120]  position across the nation you know i saw this part of his interview when he was under with
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:50.880]  don lemon and even on with uh shepherd smith where they were talking about oh my god this was just a
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:58.240]  piece out of the donald trump racist playbook i mean seriously they are trying to they pick
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.720]  anything and everything to try to demonize someone and when they sent me the thing and facebook
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:06.960]  banning me they just said you've been banned for this video and they said if you do anything like
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:12.480]  this again we're going to permanently ban you so my question is is what is that what statement
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:18.480]  caused me to get banned because i said black people are not monkeys or because i was talking
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:26.240]  about evolution where they say man came from monkeys which one is it or is it the ai algorithm
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:32.080]  that now if you just say monkey they ban you so you can't even say monkey anymore or they're
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:38.960]  going to say oh racist ban him yeah i mean you know what that probably is but here is you know
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:44.240]  they always say that black people can't be racist so i said okay so can i call somebody a monkey
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:54.080]  monkey hey so did you just call me a monkey you get the monkey pass me as a black male
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:37:03.280]  me as a black male i'm giving you the monkey pass i can say can i act like a monkey too can i go
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:15.520]  exactly shut down in the wars shut it down they tell us we evolved from monkeys right they try
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.320]  to tell us we evolved from monkeys just totally like chris but then they say if you say you're a
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:28.000]  monkey you have to get banned and you're a racist so you know what i'm pretty sure the next thing
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.880]  that's going to happen at these schools they're going to remove the monkey bars oh my god no no
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:40.160]  will they already look this up they already there was a famous a famous park i think it was called
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:45.920]  gorilla park crew look this up there was a famous park and there was a it was a a caged gorilla
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:50.160]  had been at this park for decades it was like the landmark of the park the kids would climb on the
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:55.120]  cage and there was a caged gorilla they removed the gorilla from the park because they said it
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:02.320]  was racist because the gorilla was black well i'm sorry black gorillas have black hair what does
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:08.480]  this have to do with race exactly why is it that it's always a democrat that's calling black people
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:14.480]  monkey you don't ever hear that from republicans it's always a democrat so the associating black
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:20.320]  people with monkeys they do it day in and day out year after year and here it is someone said
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:26.240]  monkeying around the same thing obama said now all of a sudden you're racist because you said the
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:32.080]  word monkey yeah i did see that but you know i'm talking about the monkey bars that kids will swing
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:37.680]  from yeah that's right or maybe we need to maybe we need to change the name of the monkey bars what
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:45.040]  should we change it to the swing bars swing bars that's it yeah yeah the monkey bars are now racist
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.800]  so that we have to rename them the swing bars i think that that's the i think that's the answer
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:52.960]  but you know what i'm glad that you brought up the shep smith interview because i don't know if you
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:56.560]  were monitoring this as closely as me but but you can really here's what here's what here's what you
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:02.240]  can find out you can find out really easily when you monitor news when people are getting talking
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:06.640]  points directly from someone else directly from above directly from the democrat party
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:11.760]  shep smith don lemon angela rye those are just the three that i heard i'm sure that there were
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:17.200]  probably many others that did it they all said the exact same thing this is no longer a dog whistle
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:24.560]  this is now a foghorn 110 clearly an order from above this is the rhetoric you're going to use
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:29.840]  and when when when shep smith had the the candidate going up against the santus on if you watch the
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:35.760]  interview he's trying to bait him into saying the santus is a racist and the the the the guy opposing
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:40.240]  santus the santus won't say it so then shep smith just says no come on just just say he's a racist
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:44.720]  just say it because that's all they wanted they just wanted that clip of saying the santus is a
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:49.920]  racist this was propaganda they don't even try to hide it anymore will they they're doing it right
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:54.560]  in front of our face and they think that people are so stupid they won't even see it no you're
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:59.920]  absolutely right with this being the midterm election they are trying to demonize white
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:07.040]  people and republicans as much as possible they are not hiding it just like you said and i guarantee
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:13.680]  they've already banned alex jones info board they've just banned me for 30 days they're banning
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:20.480]  other people across the board until november and they might do it permanently and they told me that
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:26.320]  if i keep talking is keep having free thoughts that they might just remove me completely from
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:33.120]  facebook and i'm like why what exactly did i say that would cause for violence what exactly did i
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:39.520]  say that was racist against any group of people what exactly did i say that was demonizing someone
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:44.800]  all i did was talk about the things that they are doing and all they're doing is trying to
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:52.160]  race bait race bait over and day in every single day and tell people believe that the whole racism
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:56.720]  is coming from the republican party which is not true it is a hundred percent coming from the
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:02.640]  democratic party and i'm sick of it me as a black man they've used black people to try to
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:07.280]  push their crazy agenda onto the rest of us and then you still have a lot of black people for the
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:12.720]  life of me i don't understand why they keep voting for the democrats that's doing nothing for them
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:19.040]  well it seems to me will though that that the democrat magic of being racist against black
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:24.800]  people but then owning their vote that pun not intended or maybe pun fully intended the democrat
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:31.440]  black magic seems to be wearing out it doesn't i mean all i see now is for i mean honestly most
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:37.840]  black people now like trump i mean i i go out now i get more hate hatred of trump and conservatives
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:41.440]  from white people than black people black people are more awakened to what's going on than white
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:47.440]  people are it seems like to me you know i think the white liberal they still want black people to be
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:53.920]  on the on the virtual plantation because that's their thing that's their token thing yes that is
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:59.120]  that's exactly it and they don't want to let go of that they've they've been controlling black people
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:05.280]  and now they want to put brown people on the same the same position by destroying them as much as
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:10.560]  possible and i'm see i'm here to say that a lot of black people are waking up to it just what a week
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.680]  and a half ago not even that long it was what 21 percent of the approval rating in the black
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:22.880]  community for the president just the other day is up to 36 percent within within a week or a week
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:27.840]  and a half that's phenomenal and see that's only the numbers we know about that's the only the people
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:32.160]  that's actually speaking up for the president the rest of the people don't want to say anything
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:37.600]  because they're afraid of getting demonized or afraid of being attacked i get so many attacks
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:42.960]  simply because i support the president and he's a white man but he's the president of the united
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:49.200]  states i voted for him most of us voted for him we should not have to do that and it's crazy that

[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:56.160]  spread the word again thank you so much for being part of the second american revolution
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:07.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:19.760]  and now the tip of the spear leading the fight to take back the nation
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:28.240]  it's olyn shroyer you're listening to the alex jones show all right can you stop monkeying
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:33.120]  around please will johnson will johnson's monkeying around here he's monkeying around
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:38.560]  during the break you know don't you know that got you banned from facebook will monkeying around
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:46.480]  like that yeah yeah that's exactly what got me monkeying around not now paying attention to
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:51.760]  what i'm supposed to be saying not paying attention to what i'm being told to do because i'm monkeying
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:48:01.280]  around you know free a free monkey so on a on a on a real note though on a real note i want to talk
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:05.920]  about because because what they're trying to do like you said before the midterms as they're trying
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:11.600]  to brand republicans as racist that's the whole thing brand them as racist and they think they
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:16.000]  have black people brainwashed enough to believe it the exact opposite thing is happening to me
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.800]  the more they start to cry racism and virtually signal the black people the more i see black
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:25.440]  people saying no thanks i'm not going to cater to your brainwashing anymore but i think kandice
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:31.440]  owens is a perfect example because think about it like this i would i would make the argument
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:40.880]  that kandice owens is doing more to awaken black people than anyone else right now because of how
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:45.920]  her message is being amplified and and she's being featured on every different television
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:51.200]  station and every news network okay so so what is kandice owens message uh black people have the
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:55.520]  right to think for themselves uh black people don't have to vote democrat they can make up their
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:00.720]  own mind and she just gives you facts i mean she really a lot of times doesn't even get too political
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:05.760]  when she talks about this stuff she just gives you the facts of these issues and so who's trying to
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:11.840]  censor kandice owens though what side of the aisle is trying to censor kandice owens message
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:19.280]  it's not republicans it's the democrats it's the left why because will i theorize that right now
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:27.200]  in america honestly black people right now have have probably more power in america than they've
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:31.520]  ever had before now what am i talking about a lot of people don't understand this i'm saying right
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:36.720]  now black people in america can change the direction of this country simply by voting
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:43.040]  and they're learning this and the fact that they're now leaning to vote conservative and republican
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:49.120]  the democrats are totally freaked out because this is true african-american empowerment this is true
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:55.280]  black empowerment and it and it's the left it's the democrats and it's social media that's blocking
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:02.640]  you that's trying to stop it would you agree with that analysis will oh a hundred percent they block
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:10.320]  in the video that i did i went live last night the video i did i talked about the word monkey
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:18.480]  and i was i was specifically to to the point that black people are not monkey and is the left
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:23.920]  that's demonizing people like kandice owens they're attacking her because for some reason
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:29.360]  she's not saying what they want her to say i'm not saying what they want me to say
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.040]  or what they want me to say i'm not doing it i'm for some reason they can't wrap it around
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:39.840]  their mind and you know what you just had a a picture up there a tweet that just came up there
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:47.200]  uh the race trader which i've been called the uncle tom uh cooning but i was called one yesterday
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:56.320]  that was completely new to me a unicorn i was called a unicorn because i was told that i'm not real
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:01.680]  there's no way that i could be real supporting the president of the united states a black man
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:06.800]  you are out of your place you're talking out of turn you're doing something you're not supposed
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:11.520]  to do because you're black and they say you have dreadlocks and you support the president what is
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:15.760]  wrong with you i've had people say that you need to cut off those dreadlocks you don't deserve them
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:24.640]  as if dreadlocks are owned specifically to black people if you're not real who am i talking to you
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:30.400]  right now that's a good question at first when he said you're a unicorn and first i was like okay
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:36.560]  unicorn exactly what is he talking about unicorn and then it down on me oh you think i'm not real
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:42.000]  because i support the president of the united states and i don't believe the line left liberal
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  media so that makes me not real isn't that an incredible dynamic to what's going on right now
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:55.760]  though will where i mean honestly i these people they really believe that trump supporters don't
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:02.160]  exist the media has actually tricked these people into believing trump supporters don't exist and
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:07.520]  they're not real so when they finally meet someone and that says hey i like trump they don't even
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:12.240]  believe it especially if it's a black person because they know no no no that's even more impossible
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:15.840]  we've been told trumps are racist so there can't be any black people that like trump so
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:21.920]  the brainwashing power is is truly on display when you deal with these people and they say
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:26.640]  oh my a black trump supporter that can't be that doesn't exist and it's like uh no there's there's
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:31.920]  honestly prime millions of them so there's a lot and the reason why they don't say anything because
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:36.000]  they're afraid of their family members attacking them they're afraid of getting attacked at word
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.520]  they're afraid of walking down the street being attacked so what i've done is i purchased a make
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:47.120]  america great again hat and i cut the hole at the top of it so my dreadlocks will flare out on the
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:52.880]  top of it so that just really triggers them here it is a black deal with dreadlocks wearing a make
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:58.240]  america great again hat and my dreadlocks are coming out they and he said i just don't understand
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:04.480]  you he said right now my mind just can't wrap around you one person told me that i'm kryptonite
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:11.040]  to the democratic party because i'm not supposed to be thinking this way i'm supposed to be in line
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:16.320]  but i want to be but i want to be clear about one thing too because we're having this conversation
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:20.880]  we don't we i mean the only reason we're even having this conversation
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:26.720]  this race-based conversation is because of the left any any other conversation we're having right
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:31.360]  now we wouldn't break it down on race we wouldn't even care we don't even see skin color honestly
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:37.520]  anymore it's the left that is driving us into these alleys to talk about identity politics
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:42.880]  and and we simply go into the alleys to show you how it's actually the left that's engaging in
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:48.640]  racism it's the left that obsesses over identity politics over over outside of that paradigm nobody's
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:52.880]  really thinking about it nobody's really worried about it where they're so crazy though just hearing
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:54:03.280]  the word monkey freaks them out monkey monkey you know what you're absolutely right my whole
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:09.280]  video was to point that out it's the left that is trying to use the word monkey to try to demonize
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:15.200]  the left and specifically because he's a white male anybody white this is monkey you're automatically
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:21.040]  racist when i was growing up as a kid i remember i would used to go over my friend's house and yes
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:25.280]  they were white i have black and white friends and when i would go over to their house they were
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:31.280]  referred to their kids as monkey hello monkey come on monkey and i didn't even think anything about
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:37.200]  monkey because no one exactly stopped mucking around no one thought it was racist until
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:42.400]  trump came into place now everything and anything that they being racist or sexist
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:49.600]  is is what it is today these people are insane you're you know what you keep touching on it
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:56.400]  they are insane and it is the left 100 percent that wants to push racial division in the country
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:03.680]  and they need it more so than ever because of the mid term election we've got to vote them out
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:11.440]  2018 or we all lose monkey you know what will all right so so we've got monkey we've got we've got
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:16.240]  a whole thing if saying monkey is racist and half the democrat party is racist the crew just had a
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:21.600]  story up where they've got all the white democrats saying the word monkey so i guess all the democrats
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:24.800]  raised but you know what will we've got a minute and a half left here let's think about all the
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:28.880]  things we have to get rid of now because monkey is racist we can't play on the monkey bars as you
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:35.680]  point out i think we need to ban donkey kong i think donkey kong a video game based off a monkey
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:41.200]  and an ape clearly racist clearly race baiting donkey kong should be illegal yes you can no
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:46.800]  longer be curious get rid of curious george that's right here's george you can no longer be curious

[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:08.320]  got to get rid of the monkeys because it's not monkeys that's in the cages it's black people
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:13.360]  in the cages at the zoo so next you're going to see liberals and everyone storming these zoos

[01:59:53.280 --> 02:00:07.440]  we're playing a viral video right now of a young girl getting adopted
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:18.400]  I'm going to be adopted
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:26.880]  and she finds out she's getting adopted and she breaks down into tears
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:36.000]  and the whole room breaks down into tears now I was watching that video last night and cried
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:43.040]  myself watching it and it reminded me and I wish I was better at this but because of the nature of
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:49.440]  what I do here I tend to forget how important love is as you know the hippie-dippy oh love
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:56.160]  and love but but that's the power of love right there and there's a young girl getting adopted
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:01:02.720]  who now has the insurance of love in her life every day and you see the power of love when she
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:09.520]  breaks down into tears knowing she is loved she is cared about now why am I telling you this well
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:14.560]  it is a feel-good story but I'm actually going to relate this to a real-life situation now this
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:21.360]  story comes from BBC my robot makes me feel like I haven't been forgotten so basically the story is
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:27.840]  this this girl is lonely and isolated and I guess doesn't have friends or whatever and she had a
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:33.120]  situation medically and if it wasn't for the robot she would have been depressed and lonely so
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:38.480]  basically the robot's her best friend and saved her from depression okay is that a good source
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:43.520]  tool for a robot is it not I don't know what is a is there a larger issue here well maybe
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:50.640]  Netflix is coming out with a brand new film that's basically this story in real life it's a cartoon
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:56.800]  but but the story is a girl and a robot a girl's best friend is the robot and takes on the world
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:04.480]  together with the robot now you might think I'm taking things to the extreme here oh and it's
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:08.960]  just a cartoon quit thinking too deeply about it well maybe that's the case but now hold on
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:14.080]  let's not forget how propaganda works and let's not forget the history of propaganda
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:18.720]  now I'm not saying not to watch this film or it's not a good movie I don't know it's not out yet
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:25.040]  but would you really put it past Hollywood would you really put it past China which is now the
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:32.640]  lead exporter of sex dolls would you really put it past those institutions not to try to
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:39.920]  drive a wedge in between humans and to drive them to robots there's plenty of evidence to support
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:49.840]  this theory robot teachers invade Chinese kindergartens well robots are taking over China we know
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:54.720]  that they want to bring everything from China to the United States and now you've got movies coming
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:03:00.480]  out about people teaming up with their best friend being a robot you have the little girl
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:05.680]  saying that the robot is her best friend it saves her from being lonely again I'm not sitting here
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:09.840]  saying there may be not be there might not be a good use for robots I'm not saying that this
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:16.480]  movie is meant to be propaganda but I'm simply saying is there a agenda right now to drive humans
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:21.360]  away from one another and into the arms of robots that can obviously be controlled
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:29.680]  now why do I bring this as a segue to the video of the young girl crying because she was adopted
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:36.800]  because folks I'm sorry a robot can never love you a robot does not have the capacity for love a
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:42.800]  robot does not have a spirit a robot does not have a soul so instead of looking to robots for the
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:48.480]  answer instead of looking to robots for love why don't we look to fellow humans a robot is not
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:53.040]  going to make a girl break down and cry when it says you're being adopted only a human can do that
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:04:00.240]  only a human spirit and a human soul can actually make you feel love and so I look at that video
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:06.960]  and I say that's the answer to loneliness that's the answer to hatred that's the answer to everything
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:12.720]  really is love is embracing the fellow human and making them feel fulfilled we're a young girl
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:18.480]  instead of having to go through life wondering why nobody loves her wondering if she can ever
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:25.680]  be loved wondering if she is even welcome or wanted in the world because of one simple act of love
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:30.880]  because of one simple act of kindness her entire world has changed and she's so emotional she's
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:37.040]  brought to tears that's the power of love they want to cut that out folks they are trying to cut
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:43.440]  out the love between humans and they want to bring us into loving robots and humans and robots
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:49.120]  coming together is the answer is the ultimate answer no love is the ultimate answer and it can

[02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:44.400]  me buy or sell guess who leads the pack with 71.96 percent that's right ladies and gentlemen apple
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:54.720]  run by communist china 71.96 percent first let's go to this clip from indiana last night with the
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:07:01.760]  president throwing down the gauntlet and laying out ladies and gentlemen that we are a free country
[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:09.520]  and this mass organized racketeering antitrust civil rights violating collusion by the big tech
[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:17.040]  companies to violate millions of people's speech ahead of the midterms will not stand very importantly
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:26.160]  my administration is also standing up for the free speech rights of all americans free speech
[02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:34.640]  rights look at social media it's a thing called free speech rights you look at google facebook
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:44.560]  twitter and other social media giants and i've made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:52.480]  political censorship blacklisting and rigged search results and you know it can go the other way
[02:07:52.480 --> 02:08:05.120]  also we will not let large corporations silence conservative voices and it can it can go the other
[02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:14.320]  way to someday it can play little tricks with them we're not going to let them control what we can
[02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:25.040]  and can that see read and learn from we can't do that america is a free country and we are going
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:36.080]  to stay always a free country we're defending american values and we're also defending our great
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:43.200]  american interests all over the world now this isn't about bragging it's about letting you know why
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:47.920]  in full wars is under such attack because of you the tens of millions of listeners and viewers not
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:52.160]  just in the u.s but around the world that are educating their leaders from eastern europe
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:58.640]  to areas of africa to latin america to the middle east to asia to russia to the united states to
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:03.920]  riggs it in the uk the world is on fire against the tyranny of globalism and is awakening that big
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:10.080]  tech is the system is the technotronic technocracy in their own words that's controlling everyone so
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:17.040]  let's go back 25 days ago on august 6 when i was banned on that monday across four major platforms
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:23.040]  within two more days 25 other platforms that's now over 30 actually they come in every day i've
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:29.760]  just quit counting all working in collusion and we have where they collude in this online system
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:36.080]  called blind perfectly named blind that more than 50 large companies all get in there and then group
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:43.040]  think uh with with silicon valley they call it the blind they go in there and blind themselves
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:46.960]  to the truth and what made america great and human freedom we're going to be talking about that in a
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:55.040]  moment but think about how far we've come ladies and gentlemen when just a couple months ago it was
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:10:01.360]  only in full wars dot com and it was only drudge report dot com and right bar dot com some that
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:06.320]  was hammering this and i was on the phone to white house sources into the high-level campaign
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:11.600]  saying you must get the message to the president of shadow banning he's 90 shadow banned on twitter
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:16.800]  all of the conservatives are 93 band now it's 96 i mean that they have big computer companies
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:23.040]  that track it trace it it's admitted and so we've had a crash course with just 66 67 days
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:32.080]  how many days we are now i mean we are we are we are so incredibly close to this right now but
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:37.920]  this is history and because you got in the game and because you spoke out and because you got
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:45.840]  involved and because you you cared 67 days out we are moving the ball down the field
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:52.960]  and we are tied right now at the end of the fourth quarter baby this is it and now the big
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:58.240]  text been caught censoring they've only intensified the censoring you notice because they are now in
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:03.760]  full and complete panic mode and now they have nothing to lose we need chairman antitrust act
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:11.600]  emergencies we need federal injunctions we need executive orders now now this is it this whole
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:16.640]  rubric of oh these are private companies so this is the democrats working in unison a month and a
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:23.280]  half ago to threaten big tech to bring in total censorship or that they would be federalized
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:28.080]  you've quote trump lost the midterms so trump was being free market leaving it totally wild and
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:33.440]  open like he should but the democrats the chai comms the eu they came in with fines and regulations
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:39.440]  but pressure on the tech companies who are already globalist to totally start censoring this is so
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:43.200]  this is so incredible ladies and gentlemen we're going to go to break in a few minutes
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:47.680]  when i come back i'm going to get to the breitbart article and also the information
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:53.120]  liberation article that's up on info wars dot com where it is so thought-provoking it is so
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:59.440]  revealing not about alex jones not about info war sure it's about that but it's about you guess
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:08.640]  which company the only 21 believe in banning alex jones and guess which company 70 plus percent i
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:12.880]  think you can guess that we're going to cover it when we come back from break but first a few

[02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:19.200]  president trumps getting more hardcore his learning curve is very quickly about shadow banning about
[02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:25.440]  fixing search results about blacklisting and it all started with info wars being ground zero
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:31.200]  so ladies and gentlemen this is about the stay behind network obama setup this is about the
[02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:36.480]  network that they created before he left office in december and january inside the cia this is
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:41.200]  mainstream news to use billions of dollars of defense department money with stay behind networks
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:44.960]  rogue groups in the government just like other agencies are rogue to the president and the
[02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:49.200]  constitution to actually sabotage the independent media and direct big tech
[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:55.200]  there they are meeting just about a year ago two years ago with obama to sabotage the election
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:21:00.480]  and steal the election and now it's all come out that they've been doing it so let's go to the president
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:08.240]  in indiana last night throwing down the gauntlet here it is very importantly my administration
[02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:15.680]  is also standing up for the free speech rights of all americans free speech rights
[02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:24.240]  look at social media it's a thing called free speech rights you look at google facebook twitter
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:33.760]  and other social media giants and i've made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:41.680]  political censorship blacklisting and rigged search results and you know it can go the other way
[02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:53.920]  also we will not let large corporation silence conservative voices and it can it can go the
[02:21:53.920 --> 02:22:00.880]  other way to someday it can play little tricks with them we're not going to let them control
[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:11.600]  what we can and cannot see read and learn from we can't do that america is a free country
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:22.720]  and we are going to stay always a free country we're defending american values and we're also
[02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:30.720]  defending our great american interests all over the world it was george arwell that famously
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:35.840]  said in a world of universal deceit telling the truth is revolutionary act and that's totally true
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:39.440]  and you know when trump says we're going to make america great again they go it was never great
[02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:45.840]  it'll never be great let's see we're having our morale raised we have the ability we have the
[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:50.880]  capacity we have the history we can do it and it's happening 4.6 growth rate
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:59.440]  and there he is telling these basic truths we are a free country these are political town squares
[02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:04.480]  and commons the companies have said that but they're going in and removing whoever whenever they
[02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:10.560]  want exercising real control social control to not let you communicate over these major platforms
[02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:16.960]  or do business or live when they are now bigger than brick and mortar combined with big tech not
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:21.920]  letting them have access to the market it's it's just like letting black folks you know eat certain
[02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:28.480]  lunch counters or own property i mean this is this is true tyranny so here's this bombshell info
[02:23:28.480 --> 02:23:33.440]  from right bart.com it's also information liberation.com it's all upon info wars.com
[02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:40.640]  poll 61 percent of big tech companies and employees say ban alex jones to quote our
[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:47.520]  great president these are not good people folks and then it shows the survey a recent survey
[02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:54.960]  a big tech workforce discussed app build show that 61 percent on the app blind a recent survey of
[02:23:54.960 --> 02:24:02.400]  big tech workplace discussion app blind that's a good orwellian term shows that 61 percent of
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:07.600]  employees at major tech firms agree that twitter should join the rest of silicon valley and black
[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:14.320]  listing info wars host alex jones how nazi like is that the notable exception is twitter employees
[02:24:14.320 --> 02:24:22.000]  themselves the workplace discussion app blind man you talk about apropos or symbolic that is amazing
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:30.800]  is a consortium of 37 000 microsoft 6 500 uber 21 000 amazon employees and we're from google
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:37.920]  facebook airbnb and others and they said they need to ban alex jones so apple of course
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:43.680]  chinese communists run the worst suicide net factories total evil helping round up their
[02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:48.320]  people putting their i cloud keys on it helping deperson folks that don't play ball with the
[02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:54.640]  chicoms 71.96 or 72 percent say completely banned me from everything just disappear me
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:25:01.520]  put me in a gulag basically cisco that's the actual routers and hubs 67.65
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:07.920]  lift is giving everybody free rides to vote for the democrats which is an election meddling
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:16.400]  i mean that that is a gift in kind 65.52 xpedia 64.29 don't worry i won't stop with any of you
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:25.760]  guys uh intuit 63 pinterest 63 oracle oracle yeah we have some issues there uh 62.5 they're
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:37.520]  oath 59 intel 57 adobe 56 and it goes down all the way down to airbnb 51 microsoft 51 and then
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:44.160]  twitter 21.43 so i guess it shows internally jack really is trying to say he doesn't want to do this
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:47.600]  that looks like he may be more legitimate compared to some of these other big giants
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:53.600]  but he's already banned malo enopolis gab mcginnis you name it this is incredible
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:59.280]  to sit there and read this and they can do it to everybody and they're setting the precedent
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:05.280]  with communist chinese deplatforming unpersoning social scores for total control
[02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:12.400]  and we've also had other major companies and other major groups push for everybody else to be
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:17.840]  deplatformed as well and they admit especially at facebook that they're now bringing this plan in
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:21.440]  for quote trusted and untrusted users and they're tracking your sexual preference
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:26.640]  what your medical issues are where you live they've got a psychological profile on you
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:32.640]  beyond anything hitler ever had it violates the fair housing act you name it and president
[02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:38.880]  trump is taking action as a champion against it so i am very very proud of president trump
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:43.120]  i'm very very proud of our listeners of our radio affiliates of our tv affiliates of everyone
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:47.440]  standing up for free speech all the new radio and tv affiliates hundreds of them that have
[02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:52.480]  been picking us up literally since this happened a month ago you're changing the world and we're
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:57.680]  in a fight for our lives and we're in a fight for our way of life and this is the real deal
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:02.240]  and it's just amazing that they're trying to do this in plain view but it's because they're scared
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:07.200]  and they said in the wiki leaks we delivered the election to obama hillary we will deliver your
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:14.640]  ascendancy that is the memos we showed last week and so they couldn't deliver the ascendancy
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:21.840]  so they don't know what to say now they don't know what to do now and so the dying dinosaur media
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:25.840]  where people like brian stilter get a hundred retweets and paul washington gets a 50 000 or
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:31.040]  100 000 he says take alex jones and trump off twitter i want to be the big boy because
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:36.320]  they're failed no one likes them they're known liars so the dinosaur media now are the attack
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:41.520]  dog thought police that interface with big tech to censor us and people are just now figuring
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:48.720]  this out this is classical racketeering but they did it through the cia office that obama set up
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:53.600]  in the john warren defense authorization act now they have senator warner mark warner senator
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:59.760]  white and senator murphy in the legislation that was set up to do this and saying don't just ban
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:08.480]  info wars ban everybody and 25 days later 26 days later it's happening and trump's fighting back
[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:12.160]  but he's got to move now and all of you've got to get more vocal than ever because they're trying

[02:32:57.040 --> 02:33:12.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:26.800]  gentlemen we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the united states government leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:54.800]  we turn to them and we very toughly say sorry you're fired true very tough things to get passed i guess i'm good at getting things passed but it was great we had great help by the republicans
[02:33:54.800 --> 02:34:12.800]  by the republicans in congress we had virtually no help by the democrats very importantly my administration is also standing up for the free speech rights of all americans free speech rights
[02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:38.800]  look at social media it's a thing called free speech rights you look at google facebook twitter and other social media giants and i've made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship black listening and rigged search results and you know it can go the other way also
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:35:04.800]  we will not let large corporations silence conservative voices and it can it can go the other way too someday it can play little tricks with them we're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see read and learn from we can't do that
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:24.800]  america is a free country and we are going to stay always a free country we're defending american values and we're also defending our great american interests all over the world
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:52.800]  look at africa you can fit three north americas inside of it it's got more resources than any other continent in the world and it's got what more than 20 countries but ladies and gentlemen it is in squalor it is in warfare it is in violence and why is that
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:36:10.800]  because christianity was never able to get full control and not that christianity is perfect as man implements it but if you look at europe it was just like africa 2000 plus years ago murder death killing constant war human sacrifice in fact some cases even worse
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:23.800]  africa had more civilization in some areas than europe but what happened christianity never got down here christianity once it came to europe created real stability
[02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:34.800]  why are the globalists going after christianity because they want you totally alone they don't want you to have any culture they don't want to have anything that ties a white person or an arab or a black person as humans together in one ethos or idea
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:44.800]  and even if you don't believe in jesus christ like i personally do it doesn't mean almost some high horse judging you what is your ethos what binds you to other people
[02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:58.800]  well leftist ideology is about what color you are and where you came from and then fighting with each other over it and being controlled by that when that's the opposite of martin luther king junior the christian
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:09.800]  you see so it's christians that tried to end slavery it's christians that tried to have the civil war over slavery it's christians that got the west to reform much of the planet
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:24.800]  and now it's all falling back into the mud because we're losing that and globalism is being replaced with it oh and shroyer has been hosting the broadcast today he's been doing a great job
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:37.800]  we're going to have coming up in the next segment dr nick baggots who's an amazing individual is going to be breaking down the science of control the science of censorship the science of weather modification
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:45.800]  in fact you might want to introduce him later when he comes on next segment just to get into that because they made fun of you about that when they admit there's real weather weapons
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:55.800]  and all we're saying is wow look at this meteorology so that's all coming up and I wanted to say you've been really kicking butt and you're wanting to pull a doubleheader today hosting this show I've got a bunch of stuff done and you're going to be hosting the war room coming up
[02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:57.800]  just about an hour and 30 minutes
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:06.800]  yeah and I'm looking forward my guest is going to be christopher nyleem he's done a lot of work with president trump when it comes to veterans affairs working with the veterans getting them proper health care
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:11.800]  so I'm going to get an update with him as far as where the VA stands and since trump is coming on
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:21.800]  you're having a veterans special yeah veterans calling show special as well as you know what the military thinks about what trump has done in response to everything obama did to kind of ratchet it back
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:32.800]  so we're going to be talking a lot about the military and taking military calls from veterans on the war room with christopher nyleem but it's always fun to host the alex show show this is the biggest audience and the most active audience in the world
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:42.800]  they're trying to crush you they're trying to crush us but nothing can stop you spreading the word info wars dot com port slash show signing up for the free podcast and telling other people about it
[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:52.800]  we're number one on android and on apple millions and millions of downloads they took us from number one we're not even listed now but you can still find the apps that's because they're scared they don't want to validate
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:39:08.800]  the nationalism and populism and the christian judei christian ethos is back and then from russia to the united states from brazil to you name it people are awakening to the globalist plan of dehumanization to make us alone and to make us control
[02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:22.800]  now i'm going to go ahead and in this segment here because i want to go to part of a poll joseph watch and report that's really really really really really critical and then when we come back dr nick baggage is going to be on and so much more but again ladies and gentlemen
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:47.800]  without you supporting us without you spreading the word about the broadcast we're nothing but the president's awake now he's taking action you're taking action we're only 67 days out from the election i want to thank all our a m and f m affiliates on to thank our tv affiliates our cable affiliates all over the country from chicago to houston texas and i want to just ask all our listeners watching local tv our listing local radio thank that station thank their sponsors

[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:18.800]  Terror grows.
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:20.800]  Elizabeth, wake up!

[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:28.800]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:30.800]  Is it contagious?
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:32.800]  It's not real.
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:34.800]  It looks right after you.
[02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:36.800]  You're looking at it as if it was human or not human.
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:41.800]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:43.800]  We're being cornered.
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:46.800]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:48.800]  The barricaded street.
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:52.800]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:49:21.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:26.420]  The
[02:49:26.420 --> 02:49:28.920]  The
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:30.920]  The
[02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:32.920]  The
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:34.920]  The
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:36.920]  The
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:38.920]  Bono.
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:43.920]  Bono has announced that during the upcoming U2 tour, he's going to wave a giant EU flag on stage.
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:46.920]  Well, U2 is kicking off its tour in Berlin this week.
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:49.920]  And we've just had one of our more provocative ideas.
[02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:54.920]  During the show, we're going to wave a big bright blue EU flag.
[02:49:54.920 --> 02:49:59.920]  According to Bono, waving a giant EU flag is transgressive.
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:01.920]  It's a radical act.
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:12.920]  Waving a flag that represents a giant unelected bureaucracy.
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:22.920]  So radical, waving a flag that represents the interests of a Byzantine metropolitan elite who have repeatedly ignored the democratic will of European citizens.
[02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:34.920]  So transgressive, waving a flag that represents draconian self-serving neoliberal economic policies that have ruined the lives of working-class people in Greece, Italy and Spain.
[02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:44.920]  So radical, waving a flag that represents a federal super-state whose entire agenda is based around removing sovereignty and control from ordinary people.
[02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:55.920]  So transgressive, one of the richest celebrities on the planet, waving a flag that represents one of the most opaque, autocratic institutions on the planet.
[02:50:55.920 --> 02:51:01.920]  So radical, mate, remember when Geldof stuck his middle finger up at those working-class fishermen?
[02:51:01.920 --> 02:51:04.920]  In Paris, you make him look like a man of the people.
[02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:09.920]  Bono says he's proud to recall when Germany welcomed frightened Syrian refugees.
[02:51:09.920 --> 02:51:16.920]  Remember, this was the same guy who back in 2015 lectured us all not to use the word migrants.
[02:51:16.920 --> 02:51:19.920]  We must call them refugees.
[02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:24.920]  Then what happened? Waves and waves of migrants, not refugees, flooded into Germany.
[02:51:24.920 --> 02:51:30.920]  It was 2,000 migrants who molested over 1,000 women in Cologne on New Year's Eve in 2015.
[02:51:30.920 --> 02:51:38.920]  It was a migrant who barreled a truck through a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016, killing 12 people and injuring 56 others.
[02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:45.920]  Germany's violent crime rate increased, and 90% of it was attributable to male migrants.
[02:51:45.920 --> 02:51:48.920]  Yeah, hope you're proud, Bono. Really proud.
[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:52.920]  Hey, Bono, if you're so proud, why didn't you take in any refugees?
[02:51:52.920 --> 02:51:58.920]  I mean, you're worth $700 million, and you own three multi-million dollar properties.
[02:51:58.920 --> 02:52:03.920]  But don't expect him to take in any refugees since he doesn't even like having neighbors.
[02:52:03.920 --> 02:52:09.920]  Not content with living in a single mansion in 2005, Bono bought the one next door.
[02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:12.920]  Still no room for those frightened Syrian refugees, though.
[02:52:12.920 --> 02:52:17.920]  Oh, but he temporarily changed the chorus of the U2 song to raise awareness.
[02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:19.920]  So I guess that's something, right?
[02:52:19.920 --> 02:52:27.920]  Bono says only dirty right wing nationalists think that diversity is a danger because Bono loves diversity.
[02:52:27.920 --> 02:52:29.920]  He loves diversity so much.
[02:52:29.920 --> 02:52:35.920]  He spends most of his time living in an affluent suburb of Dublin that's almost entirely white.
[02:52:35.920 --> 02:52:36.920]  So diverse.
[02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:41.920]  In a town which is full of mega-rich celebrities like himself, so diverse.
[02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:43.920]  What's the difference between God and Bono?
[02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:46.920]  God doesn't walk around Dublin believing he's Bono.
[02:52:48.920 --> 02:52:49.920]  That was a joke.
[02:52:49.920 --> 02:52:50.920]  That really saddens me.
[02:52:50.920 --> 02:52:57.920]  Bono says he's proud of Europe's fight to end climate change, a fight that Bono does his best to contribute towards
[02:52:57.920 --> 02:53:04.920]  by travelling around Europe in his luxury private Learjet and lazing around in his CO2 belching 140-foot yacht.
[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:11.920]  U2's private jet carbon footprint for its 2009 tour was also big enough to fly the van to Mars and back.
[02:53:11.920 --> 02:53:17.920]  Bono also paid for two long-distance taxi rides and a flight to pick up a hat that he'd forgotten.
[02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:18.920]  So proud of you, Bono.
[02:53:18.920 --> 02:53:21.920]  Bono says he's also proud of the fight to end global poverty.
[02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:27.920]  So proud that his charity called out giant corporations who use shell companies and offshore tax havens
[02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:30.920]  to siphon much-needed funds out of developing countries.
[02:53:30.920 --> 02:53:36.920]  But not proud enough for Bono himself to refrain from buying into a partnership of one of those very shell companies.
[02:53:36.920 --> 02:53:42.920]  Bono's so proud of the fight to end global poverty that his charity, which was set up to help fight global poverty,
[02:53:42.920 --> 02:53:46.920]  gives so much money to help fight global poverty.
[02:53:46.920 --> 02:53:50.920]  No, no, that's right. It gives just 1% of its income to fight global poverty.
[02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:54.920]  According to Bono, Europeans living under the EU are happier than ever.
[02:53:54.920 --> 02:53:59.920]  So happy that according to a recent poll, Europeans living in France, Germany and Spain,
[02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:05.920]  the countries most closely embroiled with the EU, are overwhelmingly pessimistic about their children's future.
[02:54:05.920 --> 02:54:11.920]  In France, for example, just 9% thought that their children would be better off than them in the future.
[02:54:11.920 --> 02:54:17.920]  So happy. Meanwhile, Bono says he's inspired by Pope Francis' solidarity with the most vulnerable.
[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:22.920]  Unless, of course, you're talking about vulnerable children being sexually abused by Catholic priests.
[02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:25.920]  Something Pope Francis has helped cover up for years.
[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:29.920]  Here's an idea, Bono. If you really do care about protecting the vulnerable,
[02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:36.920]  why not have a word with Pope about how he rewarded the cardinal who raped little boys for decades?
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:39.920]  Doesn't sound very inspirational to me.
[02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:46.920]  So, Bono, go ahead and wave your little EU flag, perform your insufferable celebrity virtue signal.
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:51.920]  Because that very sanctimonious, out-of-touch, imperious, know-it-all attitude
[02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:56.920]  is precisely why we voted to leave the EU in the first place.
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:15.920]  Two Iranian individuals, Amadreza Muhammadi Dostar and Majid Gorbani, were arrested and formally charged by the Department of Justice,
[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:26.920]  with allegedly acting on behalf of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran by conducting covert surveillance of Israeli and Jewish facilities in the United States
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:33.920]  and collecting identifying information about American citizens and U.S. nationals who are members of the group.
[02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:50.920]  Mujahideen Akhalk, a group opposed to the Iranian Islamic regime. Representative Peter Roskham, Republican of Illinois, recently told the Free Beacon that these two arrests are just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:57.920]  This is a result of the Iran regime getting financial support from the Obama administration in the Iran deal.
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:05.920]  Acting with impunity, that deal emboldened them. This is an unmasking of that.
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:19.920]  Unfortunately, it's all too predictable. Give them a level and regime huge amounts of cash with no restraining influence, and this is what happens.
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:31.920]  Intelligence experts have been warning that Iran has sleeper cell agents spread across the United States to lay the groundwork for a large-scale terror attack on American soil.
[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:34.920]  Peter Roskham went on to say,
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:49.920]  The takeaway is we can take the Iranians at face value. They were declarative during the Iran negotiations. They were not willing to make any commitments as it relates to their state sponsorship of terror.
[02:56:49.920 --> 02:57:00.920]  It's clear they haven't. This can't be a surprise to anyone. It is entirely consistent with what they've been communicating.
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:08.920]  The surprise is the idea anyone thought they were slowing down or giving up their aggressive disposition.
[02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:17.920]  Fortunately, the arrest of these two Iranian spies suggests that things may be changing under this new administration.
[02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:21.920]  We will be looking more closely at Iran in weeks to come.
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:41.920]  This is Greg Ries reporting for infowars.com.

[03:00:11.920 --> 03:00:21.920]  And welcome back to infowars. This is Dr. Nick Begich, and I'm sitting in on this last hour.
[03:00:21.920 --> 03:00:26.920]  Today on a Friday, I'm broadcasting from California, doing a little bit of traveling.
[03:00:26.920 --> 03:00:32.920]  Man, where do we start today? What a crazy couple of weeks since I've been here.
[03:00:32.920 --> 03:00:44.920]  You know, that's a free speech issue. Let's start with that, and let's start with a little bit of discussion about what's going on in not just the United States, but really around the world.
[03:00:44.920 --> 03:00:52.920]  You know, the globalists have a different cultural overlay, no matter whether you live in Europe, Asia, Latin America, or the United States.
[03:00:52.920 --> 03:00:58.920]  And essentially, it's to attack those that would challenge the status quo.
[03:00:58.920 --> 03:01:07.920]  In the last few days in Germany, there has been some huge protests, primarily anti-immigration protests.
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:11.920]  And these have been brewing for a long, long time.
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:19.920]  I have one of my business partners is in Germany, and he has lived there all his life.
[03:01:19.920 --> 03:01:26.920]  And what he has seen in the last seven or eight years is really he is rethinking his whole life.
[03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:32.920]  He is probably exiting Germany before the year is out. He's had it. He's done.
[03:01:32.920 --> 03:01:39.920]  And here's what's going on. You know, political correctness as a concept in the U.S. is one thing.
[03:01:39.920 --> 03:01:52.920]  In Germany, it's on steroids. I mean, believe me, you don't dare say anything in Germany for fear of being retaliated against by the left.
[03:01:52.920 --> 03:01:59.920]  Social Democrats control the country, and I don't know how you get social and Democrats together.
[03:01:59.920 --> 03:02:08.920]  But now we're seeing that repeated model in the United States, where we're seeing the Democratic Party shifting more and more to the socialist side of the equation,
[03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:11.920]  and in fact, alienating their own membership.
[03:02:11.920 --> 03:02:18.920]  You know, this is, again, political speech, controlling speech, and what's appropriate to say.
[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:23.920]  A lot of what's been happening in Germany is about to happen here.
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:30.920]  You know, people are not free to speak their mind in Germany, and that is changing.
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:37.920]  Suppressing speech breaks out in another way ultimately, and that is what we're beginning to see.
[03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:45.920]  The press in Germany has been forbidden from releasing true information on the crime increases.
[03:02:45.920 --> 03:02:55.920]  90% of violent crimes being caused by immigrant populations, and they're not even able to talk about it.
[03:02:55.920 --> 03:02:57.920]  And this is what is angering people.
[03:02:57.920 --> 03:03:08.920]  What triggered the latest riots and protests was, in fact, the stabbing of a German citizen by a migrant.
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:18.920]  You know, Germany was an orderly country. I started traveling quite a bit there 25 years ago and have once or twice a year since,
[03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:21.920]  but never have I seen what we're seeing now.
[03:03:21.920 --> 03:03:23.920]  And you're going to see more of this.
[03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:32.920]  In fact, on this program some months ago, I talked about this, said this was coming our way, and here it is today.
[03:03:32.920 --> 03:03:42.920]  When you think about protecting your borders or opening your borders in the way that Germany has, it was a mistake, a significant mistake.
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:47.920]  Because culturally, it's just you're begging for the clash.
[03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:51.920]  And why didn't other Muslim countries open their doors?
[03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:58.920]  Why didn't Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and some of the other countries in the Middle East open their doors?
[03:03:58.920 --> 03:04:02.920]  You know, this is a question that should be asked.
[03:04:02.920 --> 03:04:10.920]  At the same time, when we think about what's happening now to Alex and many others, the idea of banning people from speaking their mind from saying
[03:04:10.920 --> 03:04:21.920]  what we've been always free to say in this country, this is the beginning of the end of what we think about within this republic.
[03:04:21.920 --> 03:04:32.920]  It's time to get back, back to the essence of what we are as Americans, to be able to speak our mind, to know that we can engage debate without recrimination,
[03:04:32.920 --> 03:04:35.920]  because that is what the country is about.
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:37.920]  We're going to be right back shortly.
[03:04:37.920 --> 03:04:39.920]  There's going to be a little bit of a break.
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:40.920]  Pay attention to the commercials.
[03:04:40.920 --> 03:04:47.920]  You know, Alex needs to support this network, needs to support, there's a lot of things coming, and we need to stay in contact with the American people.
[03:04:47.920 --> 03:04:51.920]  We'll be right back after these brief messages.
[03:05:18.920 --> 03:05:30.920]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[03:05:30.920 --> 03:05:37.920]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[03:05:37.920 --> 03:05:51.920]  Head to infowarstore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the pro-pure whole house filtration system today.
[03:06:08.920 --> 03:06:14.920]  And welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:06:14.920 --> 03:06:23.920]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and I'm standing in this last hour on a Friday broadcasting from California instead of my normal location in Anchorage, Alaska.
[03:06:23.920 --> 03:06:28.920]  You know, just before the break, we were just starting to get into this whole speech issue.
[03:06:28.920 --> 03:06:34.920]  You know, in terms of talking about Europe, what's kind of happening there, but right here at home.
[03:06:34.920 --> 03:06:49.920]  Thank God Donald Trump is speaking up now and dealing with this issue because really when you start silencing the speech from the right or the left, from any group, this is a dangerous, dangerous precedent.
[03:06:49.920 --> 03:06:55.920]  Now, short of yelling fire in a movie theater, all speech should be permitted.
[03:06:55.920 --> 03:07:07.920]  If you violate somebody's rights in terms of slander or libel, there's remedies for that, but it's not up to the media to be the judge or the jury or to silence you in this way.
[03:07:07.920 --> 03:07:12.920]  This is fundamentally a violation of everything we know as Americans.
[03:07:12.920 --> 03:07:22.920]  Even the far leftist Noam Chomsky has come out in favor of the idea of people speaking freely, including Alex Jones.
[03:07:22.920 --> 03:07:28.920]  George Norrie had Alex on for a couple hours the other night. I listened to that broadcast.
[03:07:28.920 --> 03:07:40.920]  Good job, George. I mean, you know, we've worked together for 20 years and I work with everybody in broadcasting from the far left to the far right and everybody in between.
[03:07:40.920 --> 03:07:51.920]  And why do I do that? Because everyone needs the message that deal with the issues of technology, the issues of science, the issues of politics and economics, and we may not agree.
[03:07:51.920 --> 03:08:02.920]  In fact, most of us will never agree on everything. And if somebody says they agree with you on everything, one of you is lying, because I just don't believe that's generally possible.
[03:08:02.920 --> 03:08:11.920]  But think about it. You know, my family is Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, and independents and everything in the middle.
[03:08:11.920 --> 03:08:29.920]  And when we get together, believe me, there are explosive fiery debates. But when we leave, we embrace each other as brothers and sisters, as family members, which is the same spirit this country used to have and we need to capture again.
[03:08:29.920 --> 03:08:39.920]  It's not about shutting down the other voices. It's about listening to those voices to develop our own arguments and to recognize when we might be wrong.
[03:08:39.920 --> 03:08:54.920]  But that will never happen in the way that things are moving today. We need to take the opposite. We need to make sure that the platforms are level, that they're not restricting speech, and there needs to be penalties for these platforms that do.
[03:08:54.920 --> 03:09:08.920]  Because this is really pushing and spending money and resources for political candidates and political purposes in an unreasonable, unfair, and I believe, which could be illegal.
[03:09:08.920 --> 03:09:18.920]  But taking it a little bit further, think about this idea. First comes speech, and then what comes? And think about the companies that are doing it.
[03:09:18.920 --> 03:09:36.920]  Facebook, Google, Apple, they have more access on information on people than anyone ever thought of. You know, way back, maybe, I think it was almost 20 years ago now, there was a program being considered within the Pentagon called Total Awareness.
[03:09:36.920 --> 03:09:46.920]  You will remember this, and there was some whistleblower, some leak, information came out on it, and they were going to track all this stuff about all of us.
[03:09:46.920 --> 03:09:59.920]  And you know what? Instead, they got Google, they got Apple, they got Facebook, and they have literally kicked in the digital doorway of every one of our homes.
[03:09:59.920 --> 03:10:14.920]  Let me say that again. They've kicked in the digital doorway of every one of our homes. You know, when privacy was enshrined in our Constitution, it was done to avoid exactly that.
[03:10:14.920 --> 03:10:31.920]  There wasn't a digital doorway then. Most of our information about it was, in fact, held in our homes. Not so anymore. It's held in electronic databases scattered around the planet, from what we purchase to what we do to who we socialize with.
[03:10:31.920 --> 03:10:47.920]  All of this data is now collected and has been for a couple of decades, at least, in what are called data warehouses. One of my books, Earth Rising the Revolution, gets into this. I wrote it 18 years ago, and you can read that book.
[03:10:47.920 --> 03:10:57.920]  It's available through InfoWars, but you can read that book, and I'll tell you what. Everything in it was documented with over 650 sources.
[03:10:57.920 --> 03:11:13.920]  And our predictions about how that technology will be used is a subject of mainstream media now, almost 20 years later. 20 years later, and here we are playing catch-up with information that was readily available long ago.
[03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:32.920]  And it is five minutes to midnight. It is time to engage, fully engage, and demand that personal privacy, free speech, and the fundamentals of this Democratic Republic and our constitutional government be enforced and protected.
[03:11:32.920 --> 03:11:48.920]  In fact, when you get into these big networks that are controlling what we say and who gets to speak and who gets to platform, the idea that they should be able to collect this information should be forbidden.
[03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:58.920]  Now, let me say this in a different way. All that data that's collected, now some of it's directly related to financial transactions. You buy something, they keep a credit card data.
[03:11:58.920 --> 03:12:10.920]  You've got six months to dispute the charge in most jurisdictions. On six months and one day, that data ought to be dumped. In other words, it ought not to be allowed to be collected.
[03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:20.920]  And no, you shouldn't be able to consent to it. They shouldn't even be able to ask you, will you sign the agreement to let us use your data?
[03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:31.920]  No, should not be allowed. Should not be allowed to be asked. No one should be asked to give up their personal freedom. No one should be asked to give up their personal privacy.
[03:12:31.920 --> 03:12:41.920]  No one should be asked to have their digital doorway kicked in and give them permission. Nobody should be asked to give up their constitutional rights.
[03:12:41.920 --> 03:12:50.920]  It should be illegal to ask the question. These are rights inalienable rights, rights that rest with who we are as living souls.
[03:12:50.920 --> 03:12:59.920]  No one has the right to take it. No one has the right to keep it. And certainly, no one has the right to manipulate it for political and economic purposes,
[03:12:59.920 --> 03:13:15.920]  which is the whole business model for Google, Facebook, Apple, and all the rest of them, is to take the data, use it to manipulate political and economic outcomes, and to push the agenda of those that run those networks.
[03:13:15.920 --> 03:13:21.920]  Alex was talking just before I came on about the idea that they're polling. You know, they're polling all these organizations.
[03:13:21.920 --> 03:13:33.920]  They found what employees think about banning Alex Jones and banning others. It's not an issue to poll employees over. They work for these utilities.
[03:13:33.920 --> 03:13:41.920]  They don't get to decide who goes on the air and who has access. Who cares what the poll says? It's irrelevant.
[03:13:41.920 --> 03:13:56.920]  You could poll a lot of things during America's history and find some things were unpopular, starting with the revolution itself, where 3% to 6% of the American public at that time favored a revolution.
[03:13:56.920 --> 03:14:05.920]  Minority voices lead to the kinds of changes that created the very country where we're standing and sitting today.
[03:14:05.920 --> 03:14:18.920]  This is why speech is important. This is why political debate is important. This is why diversity and political opinion is as fundamental as any other aspect of the American character.
[03:14:18.920 --> 03:14:26.920]  And we cannot abandon it on the doorstep of high technologies altered, or Silicon Valley, or anyone else.
[03:14:26.920 --> 03:14:42.920]  Now, think about these same companies. To get into China, they had to create the very models for controlling speech and tracking individuals that have led to the most invasive thing we've ever seen.
[03:14:42.920 --> 03:15:07.920]  This makes 1984 look good compared to what we're seeing happening in China today. But those very same companies facilitating this ideological change in America taking a Chinese model and overlaying it in the US to manipulate a democratic process.
[03:15:07.920 --> 03:15:23.920]  What the heck is that? When you talk about influence in American politics, I can't remember which California senator had a Chinese spy in their office for 20 years, but you only saw that flash for a few seconds in the mainstream media.
[03:15:23.920 --> 03:15:30.920]  We're going to be back in a few minutes. We've got a couple of breaks. There's some great Labor Day specials going on right now.
[03:15:30.920 --> 03:15:37.920]  It's a good way to support Alex at the same time, save a lot of money on some very, very good health products for you and your family.
[03:15:37.920 --> 03:15:50.920]  Support Alex, take advantage of the Labor Day special. We'll be right back after a few moments. This is Dr. Nick Begich with InfoWars on the tip of the spear with Alex Jones.
[03:15:50.920 --> 03:16:01.920]  Healthcare reform is confusing, but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the health care system has become a challenge.

[03:17:20.920 --> 03:17:26.920]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one.
[03:17:26.920 --> 03:17:29.920]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:29.920 --> 03:17:36.920]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too.
[03:17:36.920 --> 03:17:41.920]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[03:18:12.920 --> 03:18:18.920]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[03:18:18.920 --> 03:18:24.920]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:24.920 --> 03:18:35.920]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:46.920]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:46.920 --> 03:18:51.920]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:18:51.920 --> 03:19:06.920]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage and that's why we need you to go to the site now. If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[03:19:06.920 --> 03:19:21.920]  The fifth year, even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.

[03:20:17.920 --> 03:20:23.920]  Live from the InfoWare's.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:23.920 --> 03:20:32.920]  And welcome back to InfoWare's. This is Dr. Nick Begich and I'm standing in on this fourth hour on a Friday, headed into Labor Day weekend.
[03:20:32.920 --> 03:20:38.920]  I want to remind everyone of the Labor Day specials, take a look at the site. This is a great way to support this network.
[03:20:38.920 --> 03:20:45.920]  It helps everyone continue to spread this word and get the message out. You know, this is what it is all about.
[03:20:45.920 --> 03:20:52.920]  You know, there's an opportunity to not just build your physical health by taking advantage of the products and the sale that's going on right now,
[03:20:52.920 --> 03:21:02.920]  but your intellectual health by looking at these issues in a much broader, much more accurate way from my perspective.
[03:21:02.920 --> 03:21:08.920]  You know, when I travel, I do turn on a TV set. You'll see it in the background because I'm in a hotel.
[03:21:08.920 --> 03:21:14.920]  So I'll turn it on and I'll watch Fox News for a little while and I'll watch CNN for a little while.
[03:21:14.920 --> 03:21:24.920]  And every time I'm just blown away at really the kind of information that's coming out is so different.
[03:21:24.920 --> 03:21:30.920]  You'd think we were on a different planet. So contrary views are critical to preserve.
[03:21:30.920 --> 03:21:39.920]  Pick up the phone. When you get off of the show today, pick up your phone, call your Senator, your U.S. Senator, your U.S. Congressman,
[03:21:39.920 --> 03:21:45.920]  and start complaining about the banning that's happening with Facebook and these other platforms.
[03:21:45.920 --> 03:21:50.920]  Call them up. Their phone numbers are listed in your local phone books. Look them up online.
[03:21:50.920 --> 03:21:57.920]  Start calling your congressional offices and complaining about the silencing of political speech.
[03:21:57.920 --> 03:22:03.920]  Now is the time. These phone lines should be lit up.
[03:22:03.920 --> 03:22:09.920]  Call them. Tell them what you think. Don't let them shut down contrary invoices.
[03:22:09.920 --> 03:22:13.920]  Next time it will be them. And this is the truth of the matter.
[03:22:13.920 --> 03:22:21.920]  We have seen university professors come out on this issue. We've seen people from the far left now coming out on this issue
[03:22:21.920 --> 03:22:27.920]  recognizing that this is not the way the nation should go. Not now, not ever.
[03:22:27.920 --> 03:22:36.920]  When you think about, again, what's kind of happening across the spectrum and across the sea, just before I started this hour,
[03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:42.920]  we had a report from Europe. And I want to talk a little bit about what's going on in Europe.
[03:22:42.920 --> 03:22:52.920]  You hear about the European Parliament all the time, and we heard just in the last hour, the reminder that nobody votes
[03:22:52.920 --> 03:23:00.920]  for anybody, anybody on the European Parliament. They're appointed and they think they're a democratic institution.
[03:23:00.920 --> 03:23:07.920]  This is a representative government by representative government representing only a layer of the elite.
[03:23:07.920 --> 03:23:17.920]  They do not represent the average European because not one single average European voted for any of them.
[03:23:17.920 --> 03:23:24.920]  And yet they control their currency through their central bank, and they control a body of regulation
[03:23:24.920 --> 03:23:32.920]  that covers countries that are so different, so diverse, and they claim authority in doing it.
[03:23:32.920 --> 03:23:41.920]  No, in our world, authority of government comes from the people, by the people, and for the people, by the vote.
[03:23:41.920 --> 03:23:49.920]  Not by appointment, by an elite crowd who decides who's going to make the decisions for us.
[03:23:49.920 --> 03:23:55.920]  The same is true with the United Nations. You know, it's a great idea to get countries together to have conversations,
[03:23:55.920 --> 03:24:00.920]  talk about mutual interests, but they have no right to regulate me.
[03:24:00.920 --> 03:24:05.920]  I didn't vote for any of these people. Certainly, I'm interested in the opinions of others.
[03:24:05.920 --> 03:24:13.920]  I'd like to see us have those kind of dialogues, but don't tell me what to do unless I've had a chance to pull a lever,
[03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:21.920]  punch a hole, fill in a blank, and cast a vote. These are not democratic institutions.
[03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:25.920]  These are institutions representing the very, very elite.
[03:24:25.920 --> 03:24:29.920]  And I'm not talking from a place of no background.
[03:24:29.920 --> 03:24:35.920]  My father was a United States congressman. My brother was a United States senator.
[03:24:35.920 --> 03:24:39.920]  My other brother was and is currently a state senator.
[03:24:39.920 --> 03:24:42.920]  One of my brothers is running for governor of Alaska right now.
[03:24:42.920 --> 03:24:46.920]  My uncle was a mayor and later a state representative in Minnesota.
[03:24:46.920 --> 03:24:49.920]  My mother was national committee woman twice.
[03:24:49.920 --> 03:24:55.920]  I've run a couple of times as both the Alaska Independence Party and as a libertarian.
[03:24:55.920 --> 03:25:03.920]  And this is what I can tell you. The situation is getting worse.
[03:25:03.920 --> 03:25:11.920]  We used to have an environment where people could speak their mind, debate vigorously, and then go have dinner together.
[03:25:11.920 --> 03:25:16.920]  Because we were interested in solutions, not polarization.
[03:25:16.920 --> 03:25:20.920]  We need to get back to a government of solutions.
[03:25:20.920 --> 03:25:26.920]  You know, people have been beating me up a little bit because a lot of the people that have heard me over the years
[03:25:26.920 --> 03:25:29.920]  think I shouldn't be on this broadcast on InfoWars.
[03:25:29.920 --> 03:25:31.920]  And I'm not going anywhere.
[03:25:31.920 --> 03:25:39.920]  I'm going to be here supporting this network, supporting Alex Jones, supporting the right to free speech,
[03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:42.920]  because that is the fundamentals.
[03:25:42.920 --> 03:25:47.920]  You know, yeah, I have a different voice. Sometimes Alex and I disagree.
[03:25:47.920 --> 03:25:50.920]  But you know what? We disagree as gentlemen.
[03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:54.920]  And most times, more often than not, we do agree.
[03:25:54.920 --> 03:25:56.920]  And this is where it's at.
[03:25:56.920 --> 03:26:01.920]  You know, we have this opportunity to inform and enlighten the public.
[03:26:01.920 --> 03:26:04.920]  And this is what we need to be doing more of, not less of.
[03:26:04.920 --> 03:26:09.920]  One of my good friends works in a staff position within the European Parliament.
[03:26:09.920 --> 03:26:11.920]  She's been there over 20 years.
[03:26:11.920 --> 03:26:18.920]  We've had conversations once every couple of weeks for an hour or two about what's happening in Europe.
[03:26:18.920 --> 03:26:24.920]  One of the more recent conversations I had dealt with Trump's visit over there
[03:26:24.920 --> 03:26:28.920]  when he was talking to NATO about paying their fair share.
[03:26:28.920 --> 03:26:31.920]  And I asked her, I said, what do you think about that?
[03:26:31.920 --> 03:26:36.920]  She goes, the 2% or the 4% because you remember, we're paying over 4%.
[03:26:36.920 --> 03:26:42.920]  Germans are paying a little over 1% and most Europeans aren't paying the 2% that they agreed to.
[03:26:42.920 --> 03:26:47.920]  And that's 2% of their total economic GDP.
[03:26:47.920 --> 03:26:53.920]  So here we are, as Americans, we pay not 90% as Trump had indicated.
[03:26:53.920 --> 03:26:56.920]  That's probably the overall European expenditure.
[03:26:56.920 --> 03:27:04.920]  But for NATO itself, we actually pay 67% of all of NATO's costs.
[03:27:04.920 --> 03:27:06.920]  I don't think that's fair.
[03:27:06.920 --> 03:27:08.920]  I don't think that's reasonable.
[03:27:08.920 --> 03:27:11.920]  For 70 years, we've carried Europe's water.
[03:27:11.920 --> 03:27:13.920]  We forgave all of their World War II debts.
[03:27:13.920 --> 03:27:17.920]  We've maintained the defense of Europe for 70 years.
[03:27:17.920 --> 03:27:19.920]  Two years since we've had Trump in.
[03:27:19.920 --> 03:27:24.920]  Now our so-called friends in Europe are saying, well, maybe we're not such great friends anymore.
[03:27:24.920 --> 03:27:29.920]  After 70 years of carrying their water, we're not their friend anymore.
[03:27:29.920 --> 03:27:34.920]  No, maybe they're not our friend and maybe they never were.
[03:27:34.920 --> 03:27:39.920]  You know, when you look at Europe's trade balances, which is another area Trump has taken on,
[03:27:39.920 --> 03:27:49.920]  Europe, the EU has a $440 billion trade surplus as of last year.
[03:27:49.920 --> 03:27:56.920]  We have almost the identical number in the negative, a trade deficit.
[03:27:56.920 --> 03:28:01.920]  Okay, and Europeans don't think they have a fair trade agreement with us.
[03:28:01.920 --> 03:28:03.920]  They're wrong.
[03:28:03.920 --> 03:28:12.920]  Europeans need to pay their own way, pay for their own defense, and we need to get out of there and limit what we do in Europe.
[03:28:12.920 --> 03:28:15.920]  They are big enough to pay their own bill.
[03:28:15.920 --> 03:28:21.920]  And it's obvious when you look at trade balances, when you look at all economic measures,
[03:28:21.920 --> 03:28:28.920]  and the difference is when you can get a free lunch on the American taxpayers' back, you take it.
[03:28:28.920 --> 03:28:31.920]  This is what's going on with our so-called friends in Europe.
[03:28:31.920 --> 03:28:34.920]  It is not the world it was.
[03:28:34.920 --> 03:28:36.920]  And it should change.
[03:28:36.920 --> 03:28:39.920]  And we have a president that is making it change.
[03:28:39.920 --> 03:28:41.920]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.

[03:32:49.920 --> 03:33:12.920]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:33:20.920 --> 03:33:32.920]  And welcome back to Infowars. This is Dr. Nick Begich sitting in this Friday here from California rather than my normal home in Alaska.
[03:33:32.920 --> 03:33:39.920]  Just before the break, we were talking a little bit about the EU. And I challenge listeners to look this up.
[03:33:39.920 --> 03:33:55.920]  If you look up the EU and you look up their sort of platform, you know, what do they stand for? You know, one of their major issues that they actually stand for is the idea of transferring wealth out of your pocket into someone else.
[03:33:55.920 --> 03:34:07.920]  And they say this is a fundamental basic human right. Now think about this. This is like a basic thing is to take your money and hand it to someone else.
[03:34:07.920 --> 03:34:24.920]  Now, I want to tell you how far we've come in a little over 100 years. In 1894, there was a US Supreme Court decision dealing with income taxes, which is the idea of taking money out of your pocket and sticking it in someone else's.
[03:34:24.920 --> 03:34:42.920]  And you know what it was decided in 1894, unconstitutional. It was called involuntary servitude, slavery, ladies and gentlemen. And that was what the decision talks about, involuntary servitude, that no government had the right to tax your labor.
[03:34:42.920 --> 03:34:55.920]  So what happened? So it goes in 1909, they launch an amendment to the US Constitution, which finally cleared in 1913, which is when they created the income tax.
[03:34:55.920 --> 03:35:17.920]  And they did it in a little tiny bite, you see, because the income tax in 1913 was no taxes on the first 22,000 that you made, which in 1913 probably encompass 98, 99% of the US population because nobody made $22,000.
[03:35:17.920 --> 03:35:34.920]  To put that in perspective, gold was $20 an ounce, $20 and change. Today, it's around 1200 an ounce. Just do the multiplication. You know, they wouldn't be taxing any of us until we hit a half a million or so today if that same matrix applied.
[03:35:34.920 --> 03:35:49.920]  Now, you know what the top tax rate was? At 22,000, it started at 1%. And at a half a million, which would be like 60 million today, excuse me, 30 million today, it would be 6%.
[03:35:49.920 --> 03:36:06.920]  And now the top rates are hitting 33, 34%. And that's not included in excise taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, state taxes, municipal taxes and other taxes that we pay that are indirect.
[03:36:06.920 --> 03:36:22.920]  Because if you added all up, about half of our labor or more is committed to our labor being extracted from us. Something that fundamentally under our Constitution for the first 125 years was not legal.
[03:36:22.920 --> 03:36:25.920]  It was involuntary servitude. It was slavery.
[03:36:25.920 --> 03:36:50.920]  So we created a constitutional amendment so that we could all be slaves to the government and the European Parliament, a non-elected body, a group of people that nobody voted for, get to decide that, hey, it's not only a human right to rob you, something that was never, ever considered when you go back in history and really look at the issue.
[03:36:50.920 --> 03:37:07.920]  Now let's talk about a little bit about what's going on in terms of the money as it relates to all this. Because when you think about the EU, they gave up the most fundamental aspect of their sovereignty when they adopted the Euro.
[03:37:07.920 --> 03:37:25.920]  The Euro is a central bank. It's a group of bankers that are not elected, that are not. They're all appointed. And why is it important to control the money supply? Because ultimately, that is slavery.
[03:37:25.920 --> 03:37:37.920]  When you think about what's happened, how does a bank collect? How does international bankers collect? They need to always make sure that there's a big adversary out there, the big boogeyman.
[03:37:37.920 --> 03:37:48.920]  So if these guys don't pay, the other guys will collect. And that's what happens. You look historically on the entire banking system and that's what happens.
[03:37:48.920 --> 03:38:05.920]  Why are the elite so determined to make Russia our adversary? And by way of disclosure, a lot of my dietary supplements I manufacture are sold in Russia, Ukraine, and throughout Eastern Europe and Western Europe.
[03:38:05.920 --> 03:38:13.920]  So I want to make that clear right up front. But the point of the matter is why travel to Russia once or twice a year?
[03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:23.920]  I know a lot of people in Russia. I meet a lot of people on the street. And people are mystified. I mean, totally mystified by all of it.
[03:38:23.920 --> 03:38:35.920]  And the U.S. is using Syria as sort of the example of Russia's interference. You know that the United States has 850 bases and military installations around the world.
[03:38:35.920 --> 03:38:44.920]  And off of Russian soil, I believe the only one they have is in Syria. I mean, come on. Get real.
[03:38:44.920 --> 03:38:53.920]  You know, here we are standing up complaining about interference with elections when our government engages in what's called regime change.
[03:38:53.920 --> 03:38:59.920]  We don't interfere with elections. We just go in there and wipe out countries if we don't like what's going on.
[03:38:59.920 --> 03:39:08.920]  But the Russian people, and I don't believe Putin either, has an interest in reinvigorating the Cold War.
[03:39:08.920 --> 03:39:14.920]  Now, international bankers do because they benefit by this. International arms dealers do.
[03:39:14.920 --> 03:39:21.920]  And if you look at the U.S. budget, you look at the budgets of arm dealers around the world, this is the big money.
[03:39:21.920 --> 03:39:29.920]  Back in the 70s when my dad was in Congress, he would complain about them then. And it was nothing like now.
[03:39:29.920 --> 03:39:37.920]  He would complain about them because they were always ready to hand out donations, contributions, before there were very many rules.
[03:39:37.920 --> 03:39:47.920]  And I remember in one of the restaurants, the restaurant on Capitol Hill, my dad and his main chief of staff was there.
[03:39:47.920 --> 03:39:52.920]  And one of the big lobbyists was there. And in those days, you could transfer cash.
[03:39:52.920 --> 03:40:03.920]  So he's sliding over the money. And my dad holds it up in the middle of the room and goes, wow, what an excellent contribution to my campaign.
[03:40:03.920 --> 03:40:10.920]  And this guy is like hiding under the seat because my dad disclosed.
[03:40:10.920 --> 03:40:26.920]  You know, he didn't play those games. And he didn't have very much respect for a lot of the people in the industry because it was transparent to him that their interest was selling weapons systems and maintaining a Cold War.
[03:40:26.920 --> 03:40:32.920]  These are the same people influencing the maintenance of a Cold War today. Look at Hillary Clinton.
[03:40:32.920 --> 03:40:46.920]  How much money did she get from the arms industry? Go take a look. You know, she took money from whoever was handing it out through her campaign efforts, through her husband's foundation.
[03:40:46.920 --> 03:40:53.920]  You know, go back in history to when the Clintons were still in Arkansas and Bill was governor.
[03:40:53.920 --> 03:41:03.920]  He left Arkansas with a pile of lawsuits and broke. And now he's managing a foundation with over a billion dollars.
[03:41:03.920 --> 03:41:12.920]  Hundreds of millions contributed from foreign governments, foreign corporations and people who want something.
[03:41:12.920 --> 03:41:27.920]  These aren't done out of the goodness of people's heart. These are done to buy influence, outcomes and to be able to impact our political system through these so called foundations.
[03:41:27.920 --> 03:41:35.920]  They should be illegal. Presidents, when they leave office, they should get their pension and that's it.
[03:41:35.920 --> 03:41:43.920]  You know, their speech should be allowed, sure, but no million dollar fees. You know, these guys aren't worth a million bucks.
[03:41:43.920 --> 03:41:51.920]  They want to raise the million bucks, has to go to 501c3 charities who don't get to participate in politics, right?
[03:41:51.920 --> 03:41:55.920]  I mean, that's the way it works. You're a 501c3, you don't have political speech.
[03:41:55.920 --> 03:42:00.920]  And this is one of the big games international bankers and the tax code is played.
[03:42:00.920 --> 03:42:07.920]  So very wealthy people think they're doing good. They put their money in these foundations, but those foundations are neutered.
[03:42:07.920 --> 03:42:14.920]  They don't have the ability to speak on political issues. This is fundamentally flawed.
[03:42:14.920 --> 03:42:25.920]  You know, free speech, weighing in on those things that are important, these are critical, critical elements that we cannot forget in the 21st century.
[03:42:25.920 --> 03:42:37.920]  We need to remember the fundamental constitutional values that our founding fathers put in force here and make sure that in this century, they come through loud and clear.

[03:47:11.920 --> 03:47:21.920]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[03:47:21.920 --> 03:47:42.920]  Thomas Jefferson.
[03:47:52.920 --> 03:47:58.920]  I want to mention a couple of things.
[03:47:58.920 --> 03:48:08.920]  A lot of us get locked in to the information sources that feed and promote our own ideas and our own values.
[03:48:08.920 --> 03:48:14.920]  But I challenge every listener to look at what the opposition is saying. It's something they don't do.
[03:48:14.920 --> 03:48:25.920]  It's how come they were so shocked? Why the left was so shocked when Donald Trump won? Because they were only reading the news feed that felt good.
[03:48:25.920 --> 03:48:32.920]  It's good to know what the opposition is thinking. I make a point daily to at least look at the New York time headlines.
[03:48:32.920 --> 03:48:36.920]  So I know what the story is from the left.
[03:48:36.920 --> 03:48:41.920]  I also look at a publication called Technology Review that comes out of MIT.
[03:48:41.920 --> 03:48:48.920]  It's definitely institutional, but it gives you the trends in technology and how they're going to shape and change the world.
[03:48:48.920 --> 03:48:50.920]  It's extremely important publication.
[03:48:50.920 --> 03:48:56.920]  The other one that is a total insider elite publication, you can get it at any library.
[03:48:56.920 --> 03:48:59.920]  It's expensive to subscribe to. It's called Foreign Affairs.
[03:48:59.920 --> 03:49:04.920]  And if you want to know what the elite is planning for you, read it.
[03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:13.920]  And it gives you their game plan. It's a Council of Foreign Relations publication, the Trilateral Commission's publication.
[03:49:13.920 --> 03:49:16.920]  This is what they send to all of their members.
[03:49:16.920 --> 03:49:25.920]  They're basic propaganda. And it's important because you see it reflected all through the mainstream, all through the major networks.
[03:49:25.920 --> 03:49:30.920]  One of the other ones that I take a look at, of course, is my local paper.
[03:49:30.920 --> 03:49:35.920]  And the other is something called Nexus News Feed, which is an internet newsletter that comes out every day.
[03:49:35.920 --> 03:49:47.920]  It has 15 subject areas. All of the alternative stuff, from health, from metaphysical stuff, whatever the big talk is of the day,
[03:49:47.920 --> 03:49:57.920]  the Nexus News Feed is really excellent just to get an idea of sort of what everybody is talking about within a number of subject areas.
[03:49:57.920 --> 03:50:00.920]  But these are great publications. They give you a broader view.
[03:50:00.920 --> 03:50:08.920]  So we're not just always reading and studying the things that are obviously our focus, but it gives us a more balanced look
[03:50:08.920 --> 03:50:16.920]  so that we can debate the lab by understanding where they're at, where they're coming from, and where their holes are, and their arguments.
[03:50:16.920 --> 03:50:19.920]  And this is fundamentally important.
[03:50:19.920 --> 03:50:23.920]  I've talked on this network before about this issue of tolerance.
[03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:29.920]  I don't like the idea of tolerance, and everybody goes, what do you mean? How could you not like tolerance?
[03:50:29.920 --> 03:50:33.920]  No, because tolerance is an act of violence against yourself.
[03:50:33.920 --> 03:50:39.920]  Think about it. How it's translated in our modern culture as it means you shut up.
[03:50:39.920 --> 03:50:45.920]  You don't speak your truth. You don't speak what it is you truly believe.
[03:50:45.920 --> 03:50:48.920]  That is not the right way.
[03:50:48.920 --> 03:50:51.920]  Embrace the right to be different.
[03:50:51.920 --> 03:50:57.920]  Embrace the right of others to render an opinion that differs from ours.
[03:50:57.920 --> 03:51:06.920]  This is not tolerance. This is called acceptance of the fundamental right of free speech and free expression.
[03:51:06.920 --> 03:51:15.920]  When we do that, we listen, we hear the arguments, and we have an opportunity to either learn from those arguments
[03:51:15.920 --> 03:51:21.920]  or feed into the discussion information that's useful so we get somewhere.
[03:51:21.920 --> 03:51:26.920]  And it's not polarized, and it's not about withholding our truth.
[03:51:26.920 --> 03:51:29.920]  It's one of the reasons I like working with this network.
[03:51:29.920 --> 03:51:38.920]  I know I'm working with a group that speaks from here, from their core, what you believe, and you're willing to defend it.
[03:51:38.920 --> 03:51:44.920]  That's what the American debate is about. That's what the American way is about.
[03:51:44.920 --> 03:51:49.920]  You know, I think about all the different folks I've met over the years.
[03:51:49.920 --> 03:51:53.920]  And I've been doing this now 25 years, quarter of a century.
[03:51:53.920 --> 03:52:01.920]  I met Alex when he was first starting and he was doing work about the same time I was getting started in public work.
[03:52:01.920 --> 03:52:06.920]  And he was on public access TV. That was his main thrust then.
[03:52:06.920 --> 03:52:11.920]  And look what you have built together with Alex Jones.
[03:52:11.920 --> 03:52:22.920]  Everyone listening has contributed to building the biggest network of alternative news, political news in the United States.
[03:52:22.920 --> 03:52:26.920]  Bigger than NBC's website, take a look at the Alexa ratings.
[03:52:26.920 --> 03:52:30.920]  Bigger and more links by 40% than NBC has.
[03:52:30.920 --> 03:52:33.920]  This tells you something.
[03:52:33.920 --> 03:52:41.920]  5 million listeners, maybe 70 million worldwide before they started hacking this thing up.
[03:52:41.920 --> 03:52:44.920]  But you know what? It will backfire.
[03:52:44.920 --> 03:52:46.920]  You're going to see this come back.
[03:52:46.920 --> 03:52:51.920]  And it's going to come back with a fury because Alex has a right to a voice.
[03:52:51.920 --> 03:52:53.920]  This network has a right to a voice.
[03:52:53.920 --> 03:52:59.920]  And more importantly, every listener has a right to that voice.
[03:52:59.920 --> 03:53:04.920]  And if people don't like it, it's very simple. Change the channel.
[03:53:04.920 --> 03:53:11.920]  It's as simple as that. Don't turn the guy off. Just change the channel.
[03:53:11.920 --> 03:53:17.920]  That's what I do when I'm listening to CNN after about three minutes. I change the channel.
[03:53:17.920 --> 03:53:21.920]  And it's simple enough for us to do.
[03:53:21.920 --> 03:53:26.920]  When I think about the direction in which the country is headed, we're going into the midterms.
[03:53:26.920 --> 03:53:33.920]  It is absolutely critical that every vote be registered this time around.
[03:53:33.920 --> 03:53:41.920]  If we don't hold the majority and see a majority held by conservatives within the U.S. House, we're back to gridlock.
[03:53:41.920 --> 03:53:48.920]  Or I would say this, if it does change, you're going to see more legislation pushed through by a lame duck session of Congress
[03:53:48.920 --> 03:53:51.920]  than probably ever has been done in history.
[03:53:51.920 --> 03:54:00.920]  Because there's a lot of work to be done. And I know President Trump has the barrels full in terms of moving that legislation forward.
[03:54:00.920 --> 03:54:05.920]  And I'm sure the leadership in the House and the U.S. Senate do as well.
[03:54:05.920 --> 03:54:12.920]  We have an opportunity to change the direction of this country. These midterms are critical to doing that.
[03:54:12.920 --> 03:54:23.920]  Every day they beat up President Trump. And a lot of the issues they beat him up for are things that everybody knew before the election.
[03:54:23.920 --> 03:54:29.920]  And certainly it would be nice sometimes to have someone a little more polite in their speech.
[03:54:29.920 --> 03:54:32.920]  But that's not what the American people wanted right now.
[03:54:32.920 --> 03:54:34.920]  And quite frankly, it's not what we needed.
[03:54:34.920 --> 03:54:38.920]  We needed a guy who was carrying a baseball bat.
[03:54:38.920 --> 03:54:40.920]  And we got one.
[03:54:40.920 --> 03:54:44.920]  We needed a guy who was a little bit pushy.
[03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:53.920]  We needed a guy who would stand up and speak loudly for America's interests regardless of what anyone else in the world thinks.
[03:54:53.920 --> 03:54:58.920]  And it was long overdue. And there he is with that bat.
[03:54:58.920 --> 03:55:01.920]  And you know what? He came out swinging and he's still swinging.
[03:55:01.920 --> 03:55:07.920]  And people would look at the track record of success with this president, lowest unemployment.
[03:55:07.920 --> 03:55:13.920]  Highest employment rates for blacks, Hispanics and minorities ever.
[03:55:13.920 --> 03:55:16.920]  Best opportunities for business.
[03:55:16.920 --> 03:55:18.920]  Businesses are thriving.
[03:55:18.920 --> 03:55:22.920]  Wait until we see the tax receipts from all of this.
[03:55:22.920 --> 03:55:28.920]  Because foreign tax is being collected now on U.S. companies.
[03:55:28.920 --> 03:55:30.920]  That's coming in.
[03:55:30.920 --> 03:55:38.920]  You know, when we get to the year end and we see the full count of economic growth, of taxes paid in,
[03:55:38.920 --> 03:55:45.920]  of small businesses and business owners growing, wages increasing, inflation is still down,
[03:55:45.920 --> 03:55:51.920]  interest rates are still down, although the Federal Reserve would like to screw that up.
[03:55:51.920 --> 03:55:55.920]  You know, we have the best economy we have ever seen.
[03:55:55.920 --> 03:56:02.920]  We saw the tax reform act, the repeal of the Obama mandates, all within the first two years.
[03:56:02.920 --> 03:56:04.920]  Look back on Obama's record.
[03:56:04.920 --> 03:56:11.920]  At this point in his first presidency, his first term, he didn't have near the positive ratings of Donald Trump.
[03:56:11.920 --> 03:56:14.920]  Yep, he's abrasive.
[03:56:14.920 --> 03:56:16.920]  Yep, he can be rude.
[03:56:16.920 --> 03:56:18.920]  Yep, he can poke you in the eye.
[03:56:18.920 --> 03:56:23.920]  And America needed somebody to poke a few people in the eye.
[03:56:23.920 --> 03:56:28.920]  And we've got the guy at the helm doing exactly that.
[03:56:28.920 --> 03:56:33.920]  You know, in my family on election day, my eldest son and I were voting Trump.
[03:56:33.920 --> 03:56:37.920]  And the rest of my family, our liberals were voting Hillary.
[03:56:37.920 --> 03:56:39.920]  And they could not believe it.
[03:56:39.920 --> 03:56:40.920]  And we knew.
[03:56:40.920 --> 03:56:41.920]  We knew that day.
[03:56:41.920 --> 03:56:43.920]  I knew the day that he filed.
[03:56:43.920 --> 03:56:44.920]  I said, you know what?
[03:56:44.920 --> 03:56:47.920]  He's going to win the Republican primary.
[03:56:47.920 --> 03:56:52.920]  And he knocked out 16 of the top Republicans in the country.
[03:56:52.920 --> 03:56:53.920]  And won.
[03:56:53.920 --> 03:56:55.920]  And why did he win?
[03:56:55.920 --> 03:56:59.920]  Because he was the voice America wanted.
[03:56:59.920 --> 03:57:01.920]  They didn't want to win.
[03:57:01.920 --> 03:57:06.920]  They didn't want someone backpedaling and leaning backwards every time somebody came at him.
[03:57:06.920 --> 03:57:09.920]  They needed somebody tough.
[03:57:09.920 --> 03:57:13.920]  We needed somebody to look our allies in the eye and say, act like our allies.
[03:57:13.920 --> 03:57:17.920]  And to look our adversaries in the eye and say, we will not back down.
[03:57:17.920 --> 03:57:18.920]  And that's what we've got.
[03:57:18.920 --> 03:57:22.920]  This network represents that.
[03:57:22.920 --> 03:57:24.920]  Support every aspect of this network.
[03:57:24.920 --> 03:57:26.920]  Take advantage of the Labor Day specials.
[03:57:26.920 --> 03:57:49.920]  This is Dr. Nick Faggich.
[03:57:49.920 --> 03:57:53.920]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment,
[03:57:53.920 --> 03:57:57.920]  our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
