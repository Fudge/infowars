[00:00.000 --> 00:16.120]  Georgia Maloney, a patriot, an anti-globalist, anti-New World Order, anti-Claus Schwab,
[00:16.120 --> 00:21.720]  patriot, being called a Nazi, a fascist in all these lies, winning in a landslide in
[00:21.720 --> 00:27.000]  Italy, and they are crapping their britches, the first Italian female president ever.
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.080]  She's awesome, she's totally for real, they are scared as hell of her.
[00:31.080 --> 00:37.520]  The 45-year-old firebrand insists she's no fascist, just a proud conservative and nationalist,
[00:37.520 --> 00:44.920]  comfortable, nevertheless, with some of the hallmarks of Italian fascism, like this motto,
[00:44.920 --> 00:47.880]  God, Fatherland and Family.
[00:47.880 --> 00:53.400]  Exactly 100 years ago this fall, fascist dictator Benito Mussolini staged his historic
[00:53.400 --> 00:59.040]  march on Rome, eventually marching the country into two decades of dictatorship, and alongside
[00:59.040 --> 01:01.440]  Hitler into World War II.
[01:01.440 --> 01:07.200]  And it's not just Bolsonaro, it's not just her, more and more and more and more are coming.
[01:07.200 --> 01:14.200]  We have successfully triggered the chain reaction.
[01:14.200 --> 01:19.840]  An ambiguous, of course, is our combination of Nazim and Communism, the latter being the
[01:19.840 --> 01:27.080]  sole totalitarian ideology of the 20th century that still is in power in some countries, surviving
[01:27.080 --> 01:34.160]  its tragic failures, and that the left has a hard time condemning, perhaps partly because
[01:34.160 --> 01:39.640]  it has received generous funding from the Soviet Union for decades.
[01:39.640 --> 01:44.560]  What about this laziness then to, instead of welcoming the first female prime minister
[01:44.560 --> 01:49.840]  of Italy, so much commentary around the world portraying Georgia Mussolini as some sort of
[01:49.840 --> 01:50.840]  hard right figure?
[01:50.840 --> 01:57.280]  It's a shame, but it is typically the left media who rather than say, let's congratulate
[01:57.280 --> 02:02.000]  this woman who's achieved something incredible politically and for women who want to go into
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.360]  politics, the first thing they scream is fascism.
[02:08.360 --> 02:11.880]  Now, get ready for the enemy counter-defensive.
[02:11.880 --> 02:15.360]  They're going to say terrorists cut the power off in Italy.
[02:15.360 --> 02:22.040]  Before the war was started, 55 percent of Germany's energy supplies came from Russia.
[02:22.040 --> 02:28.320]  As of June 2022, the supplies had been reduced to a meager 26 percent.
[02:28.320 --> 02:32.160]  In Italy, the authorities are treading carefully.
[02:32.160 --> 02:39.160]  Their energy savings plan includes steps like extending the life of coal plants, temporarily
[02:39.160 --> 02:44.160]  halting work at factories, and shortening heating hours at workplaces.
[02:44.160 --> 02:46.680]  It's a need for a great reset.
[02:46.680 --> 02:52.400]  So people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had and everything
[02:52.400 --> 02:54.480]  will be normal again.
[02:54.480 --> 02:58.400]  This is, let's say, fiction, it will not happen.
[02:58.400 --> 03:01.520]  They are going to launch massive wars.
[03:01.520 --> 03:05.360]  The president said that we have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and
[03:05.360 --> 03:06.360]  the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[03:06.360 --> 03:11.560]  And he went on to say, I don't think that there is any such thing as the ability to
[03:11.560 --> 03:15.960]  easily use a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon.
[03:15.960 --> 03:22.960]  They are going to pull out all of the stops, but every passing minute, every passing hour,
[03:22.960 --> 03:30.640]  every passing day, the people now know about the new world order and its horrible plans
[03:30.640 --> 03:31.960]  for all of us.
[03:31.960 --> 03:36.200]  And when the general population wakes up, and that's the next domino, we're already
[03:36.200 --> 03:38.560]  approaching 30, 40 percent.
[03:38.560 --> 03:39.560]  Woo!
[03:39.560 --> 03:41.280]  I'm getting chills.
[03:41.280 --> 03:45.200]  We're already approaching the next domino to fall.
[03:45.200 --> 03:46.480]  And here's the great point of danger.
[03:46.480 --> 03:51.040]  The new world order knows they are on the cusp of defeat, and so brace yourselves.
[03:51.040 --> 03:53.400]  Because the new world order in coming, it's here.
[03:53.400 --> 03:55.840]  All over Europe, they're pulling down EU flags.
[03:55.840 --> 03:58.720]  All over Latin America, they're seeing down the Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.
[03:58.720 --> 04:01.680]  All over Asia, they're seeing the same thing in India, everywhere.
[04:01.680 --> 04:12.600]  People are unifying against the unelected head that you see on screen of the European
[04:12.600 --> 04:19.080]  Union that threatened the Italians with massive sanctions if they voted for this woman when
[04:19.080 --> 04:21.240]  she's an unelected pig.
[04:21.240 --> 04:26.560]  She was asked a question regarding, quote, political figures close to Putin contesting
[04:26.560 --> 04:29.680]  in the upcoming legislative elections in Italy.
[04:29.680 --> 04:37.560]  If things go in a difficult direction, I've spoken about Hungary and Poland, we have tools.
[04:37.560 --> 04:42.320]  If anyone in Brussels thinks of cutting the funds that belong to Italy because the league
[04:42.320 --> 04:48.680]  wins the elections, then we have to rethink this Europe, adding that this is institutional
[04:48.680 --> 04:49.680]  bullying.
[04:49.680 --> 04:53.640]  They can only get away with these operations, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:53.640 --> 04:55.600]  If we don't know, they're the ones behind it.
[04:55.600 --> 05:00.360]  If we expose are the ones behind it, game over.
[05:00.360 --> 05:02.920]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[05:02.920 --> 05:09.480]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge tip of the
[05:09.480 --> 05:10.480]  spear.
[05:10.480 --> 05:14.000]  And when we talk about the products in infomercial.com, they all blow you away.
[05:14.000 --> 05:18.600]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be repeat customers.
[05:18.600 --> 05:22.880]  And finally, one of our best selling products sold out for months back in stock, it's X3.
[05:22.880 --> 05:29.120]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy,
[05:29.120 --> 05:33.520]  your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[05:33.520 --> 05:39.960]  So X3, despite the fact that it was a run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right
[05:39.960 --> 05:45.760]  now at infowarstore.com, and it funds the info war, which is a 360 win.
[05:45.760 --> 05:49.840]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, it takes two weeks to kick it on average.
[05:49.840 --> 05:57.240]  You've got to go to infowarstore.com and get X3 50% off, X3 50% off infowarstore.com.
[06:19.840 --> 06:27.400]  We have one more domino falls against the new world order they're going down, and we
[06:27.400 --> 06:33.000]  learned from more and more declassified documents and information coming out how weak the global
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.520]  of star as populous and anti-new world order individuals get elected all over the planet.
[06:38.520 --> 06:42.600]  It's a key article up on infowars.com.
[06:42.600 --> 06:49.320]  Greenwald, Trump impeached to stop Assange pardon CIA declassifies.
[06:49.320 --> 06:56.120]  They would launch the second impeachment of Trump with no evidence of him meddling and
[06:56.120 --> 07:04.800]  doing illegal things in Ukraine just to distract Trump so that they could put pressure on him
[07:04.800 --> 07:10.480]  not to pardon Assange, a man that's been in solitary confinement one form or another
[07:10.480 --> 07:19.560]  for what is it, seven, eight years, all because he exposed criminal activities going on in
[07:19.560 --> 07:20.560]  our government.
[07:20.560 --> 07:22.040]  That's not illegal.
[07:22.040 --> 07:24.200]  That's heroic.
[07:24.200 --> 07:28.680]  And just like it came out in government documents and congressional hearings six years ago,
[07:28.680 --> 07:32.920]  five years ago, four years ago, three years ago, two years ago, in the Wall Street Journal
[07:32.920 --> 07:39.360]  of the Publications, they said, oh, there's a NATO meeting in Germany and the CFR and
[07:39.360 --> 07:44.120]  others were there and they said, we're going to ban Julian Assange when the left doesn't
[07:44.120 --> 07:48.720]  defend him, the left will follow censorship, and then we're going to censor Alex Jones
[07:48.720 --> 07:55.720]  and once we take him down, the right wing will be quite open.
[07:55.720 --> 07:59.940]  Just like the next phase with these rigged lawsuits and default judgments that violate
[07:59.940 --> 08:03.640]  federal and state law and don't give you a trial about juries, they're now bragging
[08:03.640 --> 08:08.680]  on every channel, now we're going to get all the other conservatives.
[08:08.680 --> 08:13.600]  They gave a FBI agent who I never knew he was, never said his name, never covered him,
[08:13.600 --> 08:22.000]  he admitted that on the stand, $90 million yesterday in Connecticut in this show trial
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.160]  where the judge already told the jury I was guilty and told him to punish me and I never
[08:27.160 --> 08:29.080]  said his name, he admitted on the stand.
[08:29.080 --> 08:33.160]  So here's the big takeaway here, we're winning, the globalists are losing and I want to make
[08:33.160 --> 08:37.320]  this crystal clear right now, let me get into all the other news.
[08:37.320 --> 08:43.640]  Every major channel I checked last night today, NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, you name it, local, national,
[08:43.640 --> 08:47.280]  I probably watched 50 different clips, they all read off the script and they said this
[08:47.280 --> 08:53.440]  is the end for Jones, he will never make it back from this, he will be homeless, he will
[08:53.440 --> 08:58.560]  be off the air, he doesn't have a billion dollars.
[08:58.560 --> 09:02.640]  Now first off, every constitutional lawyer we've talked to said if they don't overturn
[09:02.640 --> 09:08.400]  this, the Texas and Connecticut Supreme Court's last two show trials, the country's gone because
[09:08.400 --> 09:13.360]  they violated every rule, every law, every type of garbage, these judges were beyond
[09:13.360 --> 09:14.360]  tyrants.
[09:14.360 --> 09:19.080]  It's all on record, couldn't defend myself, couldn't say I was innocent, but they could
[09:19.080 --> 09:22.680]  put on twisted evidence and we couldn't respond to it.
[09:22.680 --> 09:32.280]  The total evisceration of due process, so we have two years on average with these appeals
[09:32.280 --> 09:38.040]  just to the Texas Supreme Court and the Connecticut Supreme Court, two years, but they're everywhere
[09:38.040 --> 09:42.800]  saying it's imminent, he'll be off the air and then even if they get their billion dollar
[09:42.800 --> 09:50.640]  judgment, the way bankruptcy works is they can only get any profit out of this operation
[09:50.640 --> 09:55.400]  under chapter 11 subsection 5 reorganization, we're not in liquidation and that's why they're
[09:55.400 --> 10:02.240]  so angry and that's why in Texas and Connecticut, at the end of the show trial, both lead lawyers
[10:02.240 --> 10:09.320]  Chris Matty and Bankie here in Texas came out and told the news cameras we're going
[10:09.320 --> 10:16.560]  to destroy info wars and take him off the air and preside over the corpse of info wars.
[10:16.560 --> 10:21.120]  They told the jury we're not here about dead kids, we're just using dead kids to get your
[10:21.120 --> 10:23.480]  guns and your free speech.
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.760]  We don't want Jones to be able to operate and yesterday Chris Matty, the former federal
[10:27.760 --> 10:33.960]  prosecutor, got up there in a press conference and said to Alex Jones' listeners, do not
[10:33.960 --> 10:40.000]  send him money, he's evil, he abuses you, he's bad, so wait a minute, he's in front of these
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.680]  plaintiffs that were rubbing their hands together when they heard all these ridiculous monopoly
[10:43.680 --> 10:51.280]  money announcements, pie in the sky, garbage, that they're going to get all this money,
[10:51.280 --> 10:55.440]  but then he actually has our finances, we gave him all the discovery, he knows I'm out
[10:55.440 --> 11:01.960]  here, he says to Alex Jones' listeners, don't send him money, don't bet on him, we're going
[11:01.960 --> 11:07.320]  to take him off the air, so you don't want money that down the road you might get some
[11:07.320 --> 11:12.360]  of for your plaintiffs, our listeners just want to keep us on air, they understand that.
[11:12.360 --> 11:18.800]  Is that not a violation, again, of the oath these people take and of the bar and of the
[11:18.800 --> 11:23.560]  federal and state laws of ethics, I've talked to a bunch of lawyers, they go absolutely,
[11:23.560 --> 11:28.640]  they're up there saying we don't want money for our plaintiffs, the judgment is just something
[11:28.640 --> 11:37.360]  to shut him down, you'd think under chapter five they would want us to go through, reorganize,
[11:37.360 --> 11:42.680]  stay on air, I get paid almost nothing and then any profit in a five-year plan gets paid
[11:42.680 --> 11:45.680]  for the judge, that's what we stay on air, but they don't want that, they've already
[11:45.680 --> 11:50.760]  been paid money by the big globalist donors to run this shenanigan, they want us off air,
[11:50.760 --> 11:53.880]  that's their goal, so you've got to do the opposite of what they're saying, I want to
[11:53.880 --> 11:59.480]  thank listeners for the incredible support, we had a lot of big sales yesterday, biggest
[11:59.480 --> 12:04.760]  settle of the year so far, double patriot points, additional 10% off, many items are
[12:04.760 --> 12:11.920]  already 50% off, with promo code 1776, that's 60% off at infowarstore.com on vitamin mineral
[12:11.920 --> 12:20.680]  fusion back at stock, X3 back at stock, 1776coin.com, you go there, you get $30 off in free,
[12:20.680 --> 12:27.000]  shipping with promo code 1776, and it's a fundraiser coin to keep us on air, you got
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.720]  my commitment, I'm not backing down, I'm not going anywhere, and listen, there are dozens
[12:32.720 --> 12:38.360]  of offers right now to go host a show owned by somebody else in another studio, and the
[12:38.360 --> 12:42.560]  show will be just as big instantaneously, but I'm going to be loyal to my crew, the
[12:42.560 --> 12:46.240]  best people ever that have stood with me, so we've got years and years, if you just
[12:46.240 --> 12:52.880]  simply donate hundreds of thousands of dollars, sounds like a lot, it's not, I'll be able
[12:52.880 --> 12:56.360]  to fight the last third show trial in Texas coming up in a few months, there's three
[12:56.360 --> 13:01.760]  of them, they triple loaded here to make sure it happened, and then I will be able to fight
[13:01.760 --> 13:07.440]  this through bankruptcy, have a five year plan in bankruptcy, and it's here, they'll
[13:07.440 --> 13:12.240]  still come after me personally, I don't care, money means nothing at the end of the day
[13:12.240 --> 13:16.280]  they came to me in the mediations and said, just come out against the second amendment
[13:16.280 --> 13:21.800]  and we'll drop all this, not doing it, not shutting up, not selling out, not going away,
[13:21.800 --> 13:25.680]  but without your support, we cannot operate and stand against these people, so here's
[13:25.680 --> 13:31.600]  Chris Matty yesterday saying, ordering you the Democrat Party, Ambulance Chaser, Anti-Free
[13:31.600 --> 13:36.760]  Speech, Anti-Gun Globalist, ordering you as listeners, do not give him money, he doesn't
[13:36.760 --> 13:40.520]  care about you, yeah I exposed the deadly shots when nobody else would have been proven
[13:40.520 --> 13:44.280]  right, yeah we exposed the open borders, we exposed the pedophile rings, hey where's
[13:44.280 --> 13:49.040]  Jeffrey Epstein's, you know, where's the $900 million judgment there for the victims, oh
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.320]  they won't let you know who most of the victims are, or who the Johns were, I got a bunch
[13:53.320 --> 13:57.640]  of evidence on that, we'll be covering coming up next segment, so this is the dying corporate
[13:57.640 --> 14:02.960]  dinosaur media, the dying legal system that's metastasized like a cancer, trying to silence
[14:02.960 --> 14:07.080]  all its opposition, trying to bully us into submission, they'll never succeed, more people
[14:07.080 --> 14:11.200]  are getting active, more people are getting outspoken, more people are starting their
[14:11.200 --> 14:15.360]  own shows, and whether your podcast or your blog reaches a thousand people or a million
[14:15.360 --> 14:19.560]  people, it doesn't matter, they can't stop us all and it's a war to silence us and they're
[14:19.560 --> 14:26.040]  not going to win, so their mission is to shut me up and take me off the air, and they say
[14:26.040 --> 14:29.440]  I'm the lead elephant, they take me out, they think they're going to take you out, so we
[14:29.440 --> 14:33.280]  are a rallying point, they're trying to capture the flag, it's not going to happen, here's
[14:33.280 --> 14:39.280]  Chris Maddy ordering you not to go to infowarstore.com, not to go to saveinfowars.com, if you want
[14:39.280 --> 14:43.240]  to make a straight donation for my personal legal defense, here it is.
[14:43.240 --> 14:48.040]  But we will be at it as long as it takes, and if you're out there right now and you're
[14:48.040 --> 14:53.280]  one of Alex Jones' audience members and you're considering giving him money, I just want
[14:53.280 --> 14:58.040]  you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet, and to go
[14:58.040 --> 15:04.840]  back to what Robbie Parker said, all Alex Jones does is take from you, exploit you,
[15:04.840 --> 15:11.160]  lie to you, feed your fears and your anxieties and your mistrust, and the only person that
[15:11.160 --> 15:16.800]  benefits in that equation is him, well that stops, that's stopping today thanks to the
[15:16.800 --> 15:19.320]  courage of these families, thank you very much.
[15:19.320 --> 15:23.200]  Okay, so you've got these ambulance chasers, the biggest in their state, Democrat party,
[15:23.200 --> 15:29.560]  Senator Blumenthal's son up there, and they're exploiting us, we all know who the exploiters
[15:29.560 --> 15:32.720]  are, everybody's fleeing the blue cities and blue states, we know who the bad guys
[15:32.720 --> 15:36.080]  are, they're so desperate, we're going to get the money for the appeals, they're so
[15:36.080 --> 15:39.680]  desperate we're going to keep fighting and we are, they're so desperate they know that
[15:39.680 --> 15:46.040]  we're going to overturn these suckers on appeals, but regardless keep going, oh man these guys
[15:46.040 --> 15:50.520]  have not given me the equivalent of 100 energy drinks, we ain't going nowhere, I'm stronger
[15:50.520 --> 15:54.560]  than ever and I'm honored to have this type of trash, attack me and lie about me, because

[19:00.400 --> 19:07.880]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist, I have come from nowhere to the
[19:07.880 --> 19:13.760]  very heights of politics, not just in America, but the world, we are engaging the globalist
[19:13.760 --> 19:19.640]  at point blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit, yes I've persevered,
[19:19.640 --> 19:24.840]  but the listeners and viewers who support infowars for the real reason you've had this
[19:24.840 --> 19:30.080]  success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've
[19:30.080 --> 19:37.480]  ever had, we are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's
[19:37.480 --> 19:41.800]  more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue
[19:41.800 --> 19:46.560]  in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them, God bless you all, I salute
[19:46.560 --> 19:51.800]  you, I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over
[19:51.800 --> 19:56.320]  the target and this streak is happening, the fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's
[19:56.320 --> 20:01.320]  our fight, God bless you all.
[20:01.320 --> 20:12.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:12.320 --> 20:39.440]  Let me finish up with the show trial case, give the number out, have huge news next hour
[20:39.440 --> 20:43.000]  with the medical doctor joining us, it's now official, they knew the shots were hurting
[20:43.000 --> 20:47.480]  people, didn't protect them, they lied, both Pfizer, Moderna and our criminal government
[20:47.480 --> 20:51.600]  and other governments coordinated by the UN and Bill Gates.
[20:51.600 --> 20:54.680]  Recovering that next hour and taking calls on that subject, but I do want to open the
[20:54.680 --> 20:58.200]  phones up for listeners that want to chime in about the show trials and where you see
[20:58.200 --> 21:06.240]  this going, understand they have four different counts, 900 and some huge number, I've got
[21:06.240 --> 21:13.520]  it right here in front of me, close to a billion dollars and now there's the unfair trade
[21:13.520 --> 21:20.760]  pact, this is claim, and attorney's fees that the judge will decide, so she found me guilty
[21:20.760 --> 21:25.200]  and then told the jury I was guilty and then on other parts she will now decide how guilty
[21:25.200 --> 21:31.720]  I am on top of that, might as well be 87 trillion, 45 quadrillion, all money on earth, everything,
[21:31.720 --> 21:36.120]  it's a joke and national media spun things and took like 10 second clip out yesterday
[21:36.120 --> 21:42.200]  when the verdict was being read and says, Jones defiantly refuses to pay the 900 plus
[21:42.200 --> 21:49.400]  million dollars, some reason I need to pull the number up here it is, 965 million, I don't
[21:49.400 --> 21:56.240]  have two million dollars in cash, they know that, we gave them our damn finances because
[21:56.240 --> 22:00.280]  the judges kept saying we'll default you if you don't give us everything, then they use
[22:00.280 --> 22:06.640]  that as a blueprint for their case, wouldn't let us put on a case or respond, ladies and
[22:06.640 --> 22:14.000]  gentlemen these people are absolutely weaponizing judiciary against you, so people ask how are
[22:14.000 --> 22:19.200]  you taking it, I'm much more worried about nuclear war, financial collapse, inflation,
[22:19.200 --> 22:24.360]  exploding crime, open borders, replacement migration, this is just another signpost on
[22:24.360 --> 22:30.760]  where we're going, this means nothing to me except I'm public enemy number one because
[22:30.760 --> 22:36.920]  we are the leading light exposing the globalist program and the great reset, period, period,
[22:36.920 --> 22:40.800]  so I wanted to go over some tweets that I thought made really, really good points that
[22:40.800 --> 22:45.360]  I hadn't thought of and this is all true, we've covered these points, everybody knows
[22:45.360 --> 22:48.440]  these points but did anybody think about this, somebody should write an article about it
[22:48.440 --> 22:53.640]  from FullWars.com, Jim Hoffry said what could he do this morning, I said how about you write
[22:53.640 --> 22:59.880]  about this, so hopefully all you'll talk about this, look at this, this is from Eliza on
[22:59.880 --> 23:06.720]  Twitter, she says damn, I wish that the survivors of Epstein received $965 million or that we
[23:06.720 --> 23:13.760]  knew the list of the victims, they tried to suppress or who the Johns are, that's right,
[23:13.760 --> 23:20.360]  here's another one, remember these rulings, Luke Radowski tweets, there's a difference
[23:20.360 --> 23:25.200]  between the two, for radio listeners I'll describe it, it's screenshots of NBC News,
[23:25.200 --> 23:33.920]  CNBC News, Purdue Pharma execs to pay $634.5 million fine in OxyCotton case where they
[23:33.920 --> 23:40.680]  made more than 10 billion profit, not just sales, profit over 15 years, knowing in their
[23:40.680 --> 23:47.160]  corporate documents that they go there on discovery that they were trying to create a new opioid
[23:47.160 --> 23:52.280]  as addictive as heroin that doctors could prescribe and they would even then sell a drug
[23:52.280 --> 23:57.400]  to get people off of it later, like Pfizer's selling an anti-blood clotting drug to counter
[23:57.400 --> 24:03.040]  their shot now, so for killing hundreds of thousands of people it's estimated that they
[24:03.040 --> 24:11.000]  paid $634 million or a tiny fraction of their profit, meanwhile Alex Jones that has less
[24:11.000 --> 24:22.760]  than $2 million cash, Alex Jones ordered to pay $965 million for Sandy Hook lies, but
[24:22.760 --> 24:27.840]  I didn't lie, I question it like everybody else did, that's another corporate lie, do
[24:27.840 --> 24:32.920]  they get in trouble for lying about WMD's, lying about the shots that don't work, here's
[24:32.920 --> 24:39.320]  the chairman says the largest fine paid by the banking executives responsible for the
[24:39.320 --> 24:48.200]  trillions loss of the 2008 financial crisis was $67.5 million, Alex Jones, before appeal
[24:48.200 --> 24:53.800]  remember that, they don't tell you about that, must pay $965 million, and now they're already
[24:53.800 --> 24:58.840]  acting like it's criminal, he says you won't pay it, you son of a bitch, you'll keep it,
[24:58.840 --> 25:06.440]  I'll keep, I'll keep the $900 million I got, okay, Neva Fry, well known lawyer says yes,
[25:06.440 --> 25:12.840]  except OJ was found guilty of the actual deaths of two victims after a trial, where Alex Jones
[25:12.840 --> 25:16.480]  that was a civil trial was found guilty of making false statements about people who were
[25:16.480 --> 25:25.760]  murdered by someone else and without a trial, Franklin makes the point Alex Jones $965 million,
[25:25.760 --> 25:34.280]  no person dead, OJ Simpson two dead people $34 million, God wins, this is the way says
[25:34.280 --> 25:41.120]  so when are we going to sue MSNBC for some of the lies that they've done, I want $1 billion,
[25:41.120 --> 25:47.440]  I'm very hurt by their lies, Thomas Payne says if Alex Jones has to pay the outlandish
[25:47.440 --> 25:51.920]  amount of money, I can't wait to see what big pharma has to pay for actually wiping
[25:51.920 --> 25:57.560]  out kids, or now the 20 million dead, 6 million conservative number, Jack Masubic says the
[25:57.560 --> 26:02.680]  left was calling for the body of Ivanka's mother to be dug up last week, spare me their
[26:02.680 --> 26:07.480]  false outrage about Alex Jones, now they're calling for harassment, they're calling for
[26:07.480 --> 26:11.960]  attacks, members of Congress they go out and attack people, Kala Harris bails out looters
[26:11.960 --> 26:19.120]  and arsonists, that's okay, Alex Jones does none of that $965 million, Sernovich speaking
[26:19.120 --> 26:23.760]  of Alex Jones, the young Turks denied the American genocide for years, YouTube made
[26:23.760 --> 26:29.920]  them an official partner, so they can deny 1.5 million Christians killed by Muslims and
[26:29.920 --> 26:35.880]  say it didn't exist when their grandchildren and children live here, but that's okay, and
[26:35.880 --> 26:39.360]  they have a right to deny the Armenian genocide, you have a right to deny the Holocaust, I
[26:39.360 --> 26:43.360]  think a bunch of Jews did get killed, Hitler was bad, but you have a right to say it, well
[26:43.360 --> 26:47.320]  if I want to deny and say I don't think Sandy Hook happened, and that's what I really believe,
[26:47.320 --> 26:52.120]  that's my right, I didn't see people to harass those folks and they know it, Charlie Kurtz
[26:52.120 --> 26:55.800]  says Alex Jones acknowledged he was wrong repeatedly before I was sued, in his order
[26:55.800 --> 27:00.560]  to pay $1 billion, meanwhile the largest fine paid by a banking executive responsible
[27:00.560 --> 27:06.480]  for 2008 financial crisis was $67 million, who hurt more people, Dan Rather, well Alex
[27:06.480 --> 27:12.240]  Jones was already morally bankrupt, yeah and you lie about WMD's in Iraq buddy, and
[27:12.240 --> 27:15.920]  Madeleine Albright said 500,000 dead kids killed by Clinton was a good price to pay,
[27:15.920 --> 27:21.120]  but she's liberal, MTG comes to my defense, no matter what you think of Alex Jones, all
[27:21.120 --> 27:27.360]  he did was speak words, he was not the one who pulled the trigger, were his words wrong
[27:27.360 --> 27:31.360]  and did he apologize, yes, that's what freedom of the press is, freedom of speech is freedom
[27:31.360 --> 27:37.120]  to speak words, political persecution must end, Jen Psaki weighed in, the evil ragged
[27:37.120 --> 27:41.200]  the end, the damage Alex Jones has done to the lives of these families is horrific, nearly
[27:41.200 --> 27:46.880]  a billion dollars doesn't solve the pain, oh did I kill their kids, but also true that
[27:46.880 --> 27:53.440]  the end of info wars would be a public service, JK Rowling weighs in, still not enough, there's
[27:53.440 --> 27:58.880]  literally nothing he could do that could make it right, what he put those families through,
[27:58.880 --> 28:05.920]  and they're back in the spotlight again, complaining about people saying something about them again,
[28:05.920 --> 28:13.880]  and it just goes on and on and on and on from there, we're gonna go to break, we're gonna
[28:13.880 --> 28:18.320]  come back and take your calls on this subject and the weaponization of the judiciary and

[33:42.080 --> 33:47.120]  info wars store dot com, they are ordering you not to bet on freedom and not let us get the funding
[33:47.120 --> 33:52.080]  to stay on air and follow these appeals and stay on the air for years and years just in this
[33:52.080 --> 33:58.240]  incarnation they're saying we're defeated well rumors of my demise as mark twain said have
[33:58.240 --> 34:03.600]  been greatly exaggerated into quote john paul jones founder of the navy when his ship was sinking
[34:03.600 --> 34:10.000]  fighting a ship three times the size in the revolutionary war the british captain held across
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.720]  and said surrender now and he said surrender i've only begun to fight and that is my message
[34:16.720 --> 34:22.400]  to you i have only begun to fight if you think you've seen resistance you're about to see even
[34:22.400 --> 34:26.240]  more and i know our audience of activists and i know they're going to take action but let's hear
[34:26.240 --> 34:33.200]  from the scumbags in texas and let's hear from the garbage up in connecticut with these judges
[34:33.200 --> 34:40.720]  and them ordering you ordering you not to support us here it is i ask that with your verdict you
[34:40.720 --> 34:50.080]  not only take alex jones platform that he talks about away i ask that you make certain he can't
[34:50.080 --> 35:00.720]  rebuild the platform that's what matters take him out of this discourse of this misinformation
[35:00.720 --> 35:10.320]  of this peddling of lies and make sure he can't do it again that is punishment that is deterrence
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.320]  but somewhere out there right now is another day
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.960]  getting ready for school fixing their lunches going to work they cannot be
[35:24.960 --> 35:30.480]  their kid and the community day when that child doesn't come home from school and we know it
[35:30.480 --> 35:34.560]  and it's sad and that's reality and the question is going to be where is alex jones with that
[35:37.280 --> 35:40.640]  is he in the studio get ready to balance
[35:43.520 --> 35:44.480]  or will you stop him
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.400]  that's going to be your case and we get all done with all the evidence we're going to come back
[35:54.400 --> 36:03.040]  and ask because that's the justice in this case but we will be at it as long as it takes
[36:03.600 --> 36:07.840]  and if you're out there right now and you're one of alex jones's audience members
[36:08.480 --> 36:12.480]  and you're considering giving him money i just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict
[36:12.480 --> 36:19.680]  today it's not a very good bet and to go back with to what robbie parker said all alex jones
[36:19.680 --> 36:26.480]  does is take from you exploit you lie to you feed your fears and your anxieties and your mistrust
[36:27.200 --> 36:33.680]  and the only person that benefits in that equation is him well that stops that's stopping today
[36:33.680 --> 36:40.000]  thanks to the courage of these families thank you very much by the way almost all of them testified
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.040]  that they never heard of me or saw me until they were approached by the democratic party and lawyers
[36:45.040 --> 36:51.920]  and shown all the controversy about megan kelly they had a problem nobody was talking about me
[36:51.920 --> 36:58.640]  and sandy hook 2017 they made a national news story to get their lawsuit going and to go show
[36:58.640 --> 37:06.320]  the parents and say here's the bad guy and the same thing is happening right now here in texas
[37:06.320 --> 37:14.400]  and you can pull this up where the secretary of state says alex jones sent people after
[37:14.400 --> 37:19.120]  poll workers no truth to it absolute bull didn't even really question the texas election
[37:19.120 --> 37:22.560]  but there was some evidence of fraud the democrats failed i did question nationally
[37:22.560 --> 37:26.080]  it was really project veritas exposed a bunch of stuff in dalas and san Antonio they did a great
[37:26.080 --> 37:32.720]  job by the way it was all true and people got arrested but the headline is alex jones released
[37:32.720 --> 37:39.520]  hell on us that's a republican secretary of state and he needs to be stopped just like in sandy
[37:39.520 --> 37:45.440]  hook you're not allowed to ever call or protest election fraud and if you do it's alex jones's fault
[37:47.440 --> 37:50.720]  like pull that article up for folks i want to see it and i've got it somewhere in my stack here i

[38:40.800 --> 38:46.400]  i did it to them so they had the false memory that alex jones sent people after him and alex jones
[38:46.400 --> 38:50.880]  did all these bad things they could sue me for that too and we know it's not gonna stop it's okay

[48:17.840 --> 48:23.760]  phase of this one guardian only proper online regulation can stop poisonous conspiracies

[48:33.680 --> 48:41.760]  that is north korea that's the bad guys that's a desperate criminal bureaucracy that is trying

[48:54.800 --> 49:01.120]  yes can you hear me out yes brother well first off i'd like to apologize to you personally uh
[49:01.120 --> 49:08.240]  my cousin introduced me to you in uh shortly after 9 11 and uh i i didn't believe that our
[49:08.240 --> 49:14.800]  government could be capable of such thing um and i don't know i was in the military so i guess i
[49:14.800 --> 49:19.040]  didn't want to believe it personally let's be clear it's criminal elements working with multinational
[49:19.040 --> 49:23.680]  corporations and real terror groups so i mean there was radical muslims involved at certain levels
[49:23.680 --> 49:31.680]  but go ahead yes but yeah i want to apologize for that and then uh i guess shortly after that well
[49:31.680 --> 49:39.520]  so went to iraq and then uh i saw what was going on over there and it wasn't all right and then uh
[49:40.640 --> 49:48.560]  then again uh i've known our judicial system uh been corrupt for a long time and i i don't know
[49:48.560 --> 49:53.200]  it's trusty what they're doing to you right now this billion dollar judgment i hope you stay on
[49:53.200 --> 49:59.680]  air i'm gonna support you anyway i can and with that war on terror i mean there are 7.8 million
[49:59.680 --> 50:05.760]  veterans that still believe in the constitution that will defend the constitution and biden has
[50:05.760 --> 50:10.320]  declared you the number one terror threat and so is the fbi that tells you they're the bad guys
[50:11.360 --> 50:17.600]  yes sir and i realize that now and uh i mean i haven't come under personal attack yet but i'm
[50:17.600 --> 50:22.000]  sure that will come in the future so well we're in it together sir and we appreciate your service
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.320]  god bless you all right let's talk to sonny in connecticut you're on the year welcome
[50:26.320 --> 50:34.960]  hi alex um i just wanted to call in and say that i think your case has set such an incredibly
[50:34.960 --> 50:43.280]  dangerous precedent for all citizens of the united states because essentially we no longer have legal
[50:45.680 --> 50:52.400]  um right to even question our government expose crimes of the government
[50:52.400 --> 51:00.080]  and i just think that this tragedy in itself was used to attack our first and second amendment
[51:00.720 --> 51:06.480]  because when you look at the fact that the and you know i'm not saying that the tragedy didn't
[51:06.480 --> 51:13.760]  happen it is tragic but what i'm saying is that it's literally been used to destroy our country
[51:13.760 --> 51:18.320]  within well that's right they're now projecting dead children and then the guilt onto the first
[51:18.320 --> 51:24.880]  and second amendment they know exactly what they're doing right because in early in early um 2022 i
[51:24.880 --> 51:30.480]  believe that remington became the first gun manufacturer to be held liable for the mass
[51:30.480 --> 51:36.080]  shooting and they were ordered to pay the family 73 million dollars now they're going after everybody
[51:36.080 --> 51:42.960]  else right because now it's like you're you're essentially being ordered almost a one billion
[51:42.960 --> 51:48.560]  dollar judgment against you for offering an opinion and you understand it's the same law firm in the
[51:48.560 --> 51:55.440]  same plaintiffs that just did this and the same court it's the same judge the fit yeah it's just
[51:55.440 --> 52:00.960]  it's mind boggling that this is happening in the united states of america and i think that
[52:00.960 --> 52:06.880]  everybody needs to get out and vote and everybody needs to do their due diligence and understand
[52:06.880 --> 52:11.920]  you know who is look at voting record oh absolutely and then they want to make any legal
[52:11.920 --> 52:15.760]  to question that the secretary of state in texas republican does and they're blaming me for people
[52:15.760 --> 52:20.400]  questioning fraud that's everywhere but but just understand judge bellis was promoted to the head
[52:20.400 --> 52:26.000]  judge in the state by the shadowy forces that run connecticut after she did this she's been rewarded
[52:26.000 --> 52:31.600]  well thank you so much for the call sonny let's talk to ed in florida on the kangaroo trial in
[52:31.600 --> 52:41.680]  connecticut go ahead hello alex um i'm kind of disappointed in the trial result but i was expecting
[52:41.680 --> 52:48.400]  something similar to that uh i was curious about your appeal that you're going to try to
[52:48.400 --> 52:59.360]  uh pass through in order to uh are you listening i i'm i yes sir i sure am sure i am okay uh
[53:00.000 --> 53:06.160]  yeah i'm i'm i'm gonna pray that your appeal turned this whole thing around uh you said you
[53:06.160 --> 53:13.520]  got like two years worth of stuff that uh to come up and i'm hoping that that i'm distracted
[53:13.520 --> 53:19.680]  by because i'm watching the television anyway yeah i'm 76 years old a few months older than
[53:19.680 --> 53:25.120]  president trump so uh i heard you mentioned once that you had photographic memory i i once
[53:25.120 --> 53:31.040]  had it too and it's long gone so i'm not as fast as i once was hey i get it brother i'm neither am i
[53:31.600 --> 53:36.000]  but uh it did look it's just turning at every level and it's because we're trying to struggle
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.360]  our way out of these people's control and they're trying to assert it history's repeating itself
[53:39.360 --> 53:43.920]  again god bless you had great points let's talk to todd in texas he wants to talk about the secretary
[53:43.920 --> 53:50.000]  of state saying i unleashed hell on the texas election commission and their employees i actually
[53:50.000 --> 53:55.040]  kind of dropped the ball and only covered national issues i think we had project veritas on once
[53:55.040 --> 54:02.400]  when they got people arrested for fraud in san antonio in dalis and we did cover arrest but i i
[54:02.400 --> 54:09.200]  didn't republicans won texas so i it's not even true they just make it up go look alex jones he
[54:09.200 --> 54:13.280]  just paid a billion dollars which is a true we need to stop these people what's your view on this
[54:13.280 --> 54:20.000]  todd um well i looked into this guy yesterday and funny enough the first thing that popped up was a
[54:21.120 --> 54:24.880]  article that he wrote in the houston chronicle and that's what i wanted to bring you guys
[54:24.880 --> 54:31.680]  attention you guys might want to make a little article about this um it's it's him calling for
[54:31.680 --> 54:39.120]  a forensic audit of the 2020 election um and it says um i'm going to read you a line from here it's
[54:39.120 --> 54:44.400]  oh my gosh he he unleashed hell then he should be really giving him a million dollars i think
[54:44.400 --> 54:48.720]  that uh he actually it took heat for this and i think he's trying to put it off on you now let
[54:48.720 --> 54:52.400]  me read you this sentence yeah i agree give us the headline so we can pull it up for reviewers
[54:53.200 --> 54:58.800]  okay it's called it's a houston chronicle it says opinion full forensic audit will restore
[54:58.800 --> 55:06.640]  faith in texas elections john b scott november 21st 2021 full forensic audit will restore
[55:06.640 --> 55:13.520]  faith in texas elections that's right it says uh whether it was the specter of foreign interference
[55:13.520 --> 55:18.720]  in our elections or allegations of widespread mail ballot fraud during the pandemic voters
[55:18.720 --> 55:24.720]  have been hit with a barrage of reasons to doubt the system and surprisingly it's starting to take
[55:24.720 --> 55:29.760]  its toll on the faith in the integrity of our election but this these are his words i agree we
[55:29.760 --> 55:34.480]  put it on screen so i i i totally agree with your analysis you know he got approached and said hey
[55:34.480 --> 55:42.240]  buddy yep yep and now you're the uh you're the scapegoat for the whole thing so i i just wanted
[55:42.240 --> 55:46.000]  to point that out to you guys i thought it was pretty funny that'll be very useful because i'm
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.240]  sure the development case on us as well but you have to understand i'd be proud to expose fraud
[55:50.240 --> 55:54.080]  in texas there was a lot of evidence of it we barely did it i wish i would have done more i
[55:54.080 --> 56:03.360]  went and looked we covered it twice people that were arrested charged caught on undercover video
[56:03.360 --> 56:09.200]  anything else Todd uh no that's it man just wanted to point that out to you guys thank you sir
[56:09.200 --> 56:12.320]  put me that article please guys that's why i love the callers that's why we're just going more and

[56:22.720 --> 56:28.160]  boom the callers did it and right there he says voters are pissed he says voters have a reason
[56:28.160 --> 56:34.000]  to be concerned there are a whole bunch of arrests in texas and then i dropped the ball don't even
[56:34.000 --> 56:40.560]  really cover it and now they're blaming me that people are pissed that'll just make me cover

[1:00:56.800 --> 1:01:02.160]  ever um i got a really big thing i want to bring to you alex but if it's okay can i save it for
[1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:07.440]  last yeah go ahead okay um first thing i want to say guys to get the truth out there more i think
[1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:12.400]  i came up with an idea uh using social media it's a certain kind of social media that i think that
[1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:17.760]  the the globalist the left you know the opposition didn't actually think about big tech uh that's
[1:01:17.760 --> 1:01:22.640]  using dating apps all right create dating profiles and then when you connect with people try to take
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:26.240]  them off the app get the number and then hit them with the truth i've been doing that i've been sending
[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:31.840]  them uh you know pdfs you know fizer dump documents you know links to alex jones anything you can send
[1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:36.160]  people that are still asleep they can wake them up it's huge and you can't get the platform for it
[1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:41.600]  if you take them off the app after you and by the way we're winning there's a 99 reduction in the
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:46.240]  uptake of the poison shots we are winning absolutely man and that's so beautiful and that's
[1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:49.840]  then so much of that is because of what people like you were doing alex so so thank you for
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:54.080]  brother don't thank me it is you that's doing it shon what's the big point you wanted to make
[1:01:54.640 --> 1:01:58.240]  all right i don't know if i actually want to drop the name but i think i may know who
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:01.840]  and i don't care if the fb i tried to kick in my door right now i think i may know who planted
[1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:06.240]  the bomb at j6 i've tried to bring this to the attention of certain people who should care about
[1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:11.520]  this nobody gets back to me so i tend to think maybe the white hats know who it is and they're not
[1:02:11.520 --> 1:02:18.400]  not saying it because maybe it's leverage that they can use in this battle but i know somebody
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:24.800]  that you know i'm 99 sure that it is to this person says it is because the person who said this
[1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:31.840]  is who did the the bomb you know drop or the the planning of the bomb that person is right i mean
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:35.120]  almost 100 of the time and i think that you should try to get in touch with him but i'm
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:42.000]  like 99.9 percent sure that i know who the j6 bomber is uh do you want us to put you on hold
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.440]  and you can tell us the the lead yeah yeah uh that would be great or email whatever i mean
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:51.280]  whatever you want to do it's fine i just i think that you should know and i think that you know
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:56.480]  if it's supposed to get out there it should get out there john please put john on hold and get him
[1:02:56.480 --> 1:03:00.640]  to give us the intel and get his email but but get him to tell you now so we don't drop the ball on

[1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:39.680]  why i no longer sell used cars and gym memberships and how i became yeoman farmer barbie so that's
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:46.160]  uh that's that um as far as how to save info wars i can't take credit for this idea the
[1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:51.680]  holy spirit brought it to me this morning but i had an idea for a raffle that i'm calling party
[1:08:51.680 --> 1:08:59.280]  with info wars where you guys could sell raffle tickets online uh buyers would get a virtual
[1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:05.520]  ticket in their email and you could draw the winner on air the winner could be flown out to
[1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:11.520]  the studio or or rent a car or whatever you guys wanted to set up put up in the hotel for the night
[1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:17.360]  hang out at the studio with you guys for the day maybe film a funny bit or uh be on the show you
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:20.960]  know things like that are really smart ways to raise extra money a lot of the other things i'm
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:26.160]  gonna do is uh i got a couple watches that i didn't buy people gave me as gifts over the year that
[1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:31.680]  are expensive i'm gonna i never wear them anyways i'm gonna raffle those off uh very soon we're
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:37.040]  gonna the armored vehicle's been great but you know it's time to sell it and it's it and then
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:40.880]  it'll be a fun auction and i'm gonna sell my my private hellcat i don't even need it i don't even
[1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:46.800]  drive it uh i got it years ago but it's a great car um just to show people how real this is and
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:50.960]  that we're committed to keeping this operation going but that that's another great idea uh farmer

[1:10:11.760 --> 1:10:16.560]  the truth and i just try to fight as hard as i can and the problem is most people don't know
[1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:21.040]  how the legal system works or they don't understand all this even my family even family members that
[1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:27.920]  i know that are successful and smart they're just calling so upset billion dollars how are you taking
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:33.600]  it and i'm like i'm great but why you owe a billion dollars no i don't get to appeal it plus i don't
[1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:41.200]  have a billion dollars it's a joke it's everything the left does is just overkill and over the top
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:46.960]  two men can have a baby you know all the rest of it it's just it's ridiculous there's processes
[1:10:46.960 --> 1:10:53.120]  here and they haven't gutted the country yet yeah if these appeals courts don't overturn this that's
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:59.280]  another major coffin nail in our republic that's two years from now does anybody think the way
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:04.880]  the world's going in two years we're gonna be worried about a billion dollar judgment i mean hell
[1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:10.160]  the way inflation's going a billion dollars might buy a hamburger in a couple years seriously
[1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:14.960]  that's how inflation works it just takes off takes off the just why am our republics in
[1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:20.320]  bob way overnight i'm like oh here i actually i can pay the billion you know i said i could never
[1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:25.520]  pay this billion dollars well i mean not of the evaluation really accelerates i guess i'll be uh
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:30.480]  have to spend my whole paycheck on it because your paychecks will be in the billions as well it
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:38.480]  happens all the time but it'll probably be more like a billions like a million in 10 years we're
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:44.160]  going into total world government ladies and gentlemen and it's it's it's life and death i'm
[1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:48.480]  worried about nuclear war i'm worried about the next virus they're gonna release i'm worried about
[1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:53.360]  killing members of my family and my friends these lawyers and all these little corrupt
[1:11:53.360 --> 1:12:00.000]  nobodies they have no idea what they're even involved in but they will because the rugs coming
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:05.520]  out from under everybody but these these these these corrupt individuals in the system that
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:09.840]  think they're winners because they're with the system are fools the system is out of control
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:16.000]  than hijacked by eugenicists the populationist rick in canada rick thanks for calling your own
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:23.520]  here hey alex how you doing so i listen to crowded all the time you're on there this morning um i hear
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:28.800]  a lot of things that go on but i just get frustrated um so you're talking about with all the things
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:32.640]  and that you're going through over the sandy hook thing and all that um i don't remember exactly
[1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:36.240]  where it was called but it was that last shooting that happened there in texas that they said all
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:41.680]  these things that happened that why they couldn't do this why they couldn't do that and 99% of it
[1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:46.640]  turned out to be all bullshit so you're talking about you've all been they they they they lied
[1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:54.240]  they lied for like months all life yes and i just don't like it's not enough attention it's thrown
[1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:59.360]  or to say hey well look what happened here like you know what i mean and why wouldn't i think
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:03.120]  you know what i mean what happened there because i know you're more informed than most of a lot of
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:07.920]  other people but it's you know what i mean it's just everything just it seems stage terrible
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:13.520]  things are happening by terrible people but it seems like it's being pushed by certain people
[1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:17.520]  to do these things right so it's kind of it's frustrating on my behalf because people don't
[1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:23.360]  pay enough attention and bring in those things out to you know to reason to pass to to things
[1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:28.560]  that are going on exactly and i said day one and you've all be this looks bad but we need to wait
[1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:33.360]  see and then i believe the police when i lied and i said okay good job then turned out was all lies
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:38.720]  they stood down for 77 minutes they had sand hand sanitizer they lied to the fbi they lied to the
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:42.560]  state police they lied to everybody and then now we're not supposed to question anything just we'll
[1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:47.200]  just we don't know what happened just forget it and it turns out the shooter was known he was
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:52.000]  threatening people nothing was done uh it just goes on and on and then if you question it oh we'll

[1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:25.520]  well i was really impressed with him a few weeks ago when he brought his
[1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:31.280]  wonderful family to visit with us while he was on air dr paul e alexander phd
[1:20:33.040 --> 1:20:39.200]  he is a former professor at mcmaster university in evidence-based medicine a former covid pandemic

[1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:52.960]  health and human services and advised the white house and witnessed this whole train wreck i'm
[1:20:52.960 --> 1:20:58.960]  going to go over his whole bio uh but how he worked with the who and more but he has been dead on
[1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:06.800]  exposing what really happened and now the fizer spokeswoman j small admitted as you know earlier
[1:21:06.800 --> 1:21:11.920]  this week in hearings that indeed it does not protect you and that they did not know protect
[1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:15.520]  you they lied to the public and told you it would protect you i've already played these clips a
[1:21:15.520 --> 1:21:19.280]  bunch we've already played the compilations of them lying to us including biden saying
[1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:26.320]  get the shot you're protected but i want to get dr alexander's response to how big a deal this is
[1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:31.120]  and how this is sending shock waves that i'm seeing and what he's seeing and also the numbers
[1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:37.200]  we're seeing almost no one now is taking the new so-called covid booster and any other big
[1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:42.800]  developments so dr alexander dr paul alexander dot com dr paul alexander dot com we really
[1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:47.600]  appreciate your courage you're one of the early people to expose this and so just give us update
[1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:53.680]  your view on what's unfolding hi alex thanks for having me it's a pleasure and honor to be on your
[1:21:53.680 --> 1:21:59.680]  show and the work that you do bringing the truth to the people so let me get straight to the point
[1:21:59.680 --> 1:22:06.160]  the reality about it is that as you said we have parents right now that almost minimally
[1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:11.840]  taking the the boosters and taking the shots with their children because parents have
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:18.240]  included and have listened to my color listen to myself listen to dr harvey wish where we
[1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:24.880]  warned against the children with almost zero risk statistical zero risk for severe outcomes from
[1:22:24.880 --> 1:22:30.880]  covid they're not candidates healthy children and we found that not one healthy child in america
[1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:37.360]  has died from covid after infection not one and that's the data across the pandemic now this
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:45.360]  revelation by phyla yesterday its executive was shocking well we we all we knew it by looking at the
[1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:52.480]  data and and what was happening around us in populations across the world that this covid
[1:22:52.480 --> 1:23:00.080]  gene injection early out of the gate by around mid of 2021 last year was not stopping infection
[1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:07.440]  in the vaccinated was not stopping replication in the airways and was not stopping transmission this
[1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:15.280]  is very serious because the basis for the mandates for throwing people out of the us military for
[1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:22.240]  throwing police out of the police services for firing nurses was because they decided to exercise
[1:23:22.240 --> 1:23:29.600]  their natural immunity they were covered yet governments business places agencies decided
[1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:36.320]  to fire people because they said you must it was a mandate that you by you taking the vaccine you
[1:23:36.320 --> 1:23:43.520]  would protect the larger society but now we know that even Pfizer knew that this vaccine this
[1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:49.360]  covid gene injection was not stopping transmission so it was a lie i'll be as straightforward as i
[1:23:49.360 --> 1:23:59.200]  can phyla madonna etc the fda the united states top regulatory agency lied they lied to the people
[1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:05.680]  by approving these covid gene injections but importantly none of the mandates were needed
[1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:12.880]  so all of those schools universities businesses were business owners committed suicide because
[1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:18.880]  they had to close their business because employees chose not to be mandated with a shock they couldn't
[1:24:18.880 --> 1:24:25.680]  stop they had to close and their business was lost many people ended their lives because of the
[1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:31.200]  mandate because of what the government did so these people need to be held account
[1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:40.880]  Pfizer needs Madonna needs executives bola bansal they need to be held under proper questioning and
[1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:48.640]  full accountability because it was not it this is not a simple mea culpa you cannot just say now oh
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:57.120]  oh doesn't stop transmission you caused a lot of debt by the policies the mandate policies
[1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:06.480]  that people are still today fighting in courtrooms so i think this is so shocking we saw it epidemiologically
[1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:13.840]  but for this Pfizer executive to say it on the earth in that hearing is a stunning development
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:20.800]  and we cannot not talk about the situation we have to bring it out well dr. Alexander i mean i'll
[1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:25.600]  i'll tell you what i think is exciting whether it's congress here the house the senate or whether
[1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:30.080]  it's the european union parliament or whether it's the brazilian government or eastern all over
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:35.760]  really smart scientists and really smart leaders are saying this is criminal we need to criminally
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:41.280]  go after them this isn't oh they messed up oh we need to have some payments here these people
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:46.240]  need to be investigated need to go to prison they knew what they were doing i agree with you fully
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:51.680]  i've called for that over and over i've said look we are not a kangaroo court society we have good
[1:25:51.680 --> 1:25:58.720]  governance america the greatest nation on earth countries like canada uk etc we need to put these
[1:25:58.720 --> 1:26:06.400]  people on the earth in proper public inquiries and an investigate and if we show if proper inquiry
[1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:14.640]  show that their actions will reckless negligent dangerous that they cause people to commit suicide
[1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:21.680]  that they cause the loss of life by their policies we need to find them you need to take we need to
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:29.200]  take all of them money we need criminal prosecutions this is not a simple mea culpa because lives
[1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:35.200]  will last you need to understand something when i was in the trump administration we were getting
[1:26:35.200 --> 1:26:42.880]  data coming up from the states where parents were taking their children to the ER with broken limbs
[1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:49.680]  those parents were locked down and locked away from work and they were they were physically
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:54.880]  abusing each other they were abusing their children children were sexually abused in school closures
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:27:02.240]  and and escaped being recognized because schools were closed there was so much rum so many children
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:08.960]  committed suicide so many business owners and laid off people for lives they lied because every
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:15.440]  COVID lockdown every school closure every vaccine mandate we looked at the signs every single one
[1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:22.000]  failed nothing worked including this gene injection that they brought it has failed and the omicron
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:32.560]  variant today is largely resistant this vaccine this gene injection must stop it does not work
[1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:38.000]  does not protect the upper areas and now this new bivalent booster it's actually showing already
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:43.920]  it is ineffective this is a catastrophe that has happened and we need to stand up as people and people

[1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:22.960]  FDA has failed the society as well let's talk about doubling down when we come back they're
[1:28:22.960 --> 1:28:28.160]  doubling down on funding more bat research under Fauci a reward for what he did him and Dasek
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:33.520]  they are doubling down with more boosters the FDA saying it's good for five and up even though
[1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:37.360]  their own panels have told them don't do it resigned over and over again what do we need to do to
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:41.600]  stop these criminals because it's only the US is giving it to little kids as you know and and six
[1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:46.640]  months up i mean why why is the US the dumping ground for this when they even admit it doesn't

[1:33:01.840 --> 1:33:22.160]  world order it's alex jones leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex
[1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:32.800]  jones
[1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:43.280]  dr paul e alexander who worked at advise the front white house on code response was a fly on
[1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:49.120]  the wall and witness it all spoke out early about his concerns now here we are with all of it coming
[1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:55.520]  out it's insane the blood clots the deaths the the the illnesses the erasing of the immune systems
[1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:02.240]  the mask absolutely traumatizing children uh annihilating their development how would you
[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:08.000]  describe the process that's been carried out and now big pharma we know was behind it i believe
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:12.560]  premeditated you give us your your view sir but just the fact that they're doubling down now
[1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:19.280]  only exacerbates the severity of their crimes in my view yeah i agree with you alex and um
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:26.080]  you know you mentioned the word your show is info wars but we are actually in an info war this is a
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:33.680]  war of uh information where one side is trying to prevent us from speaking and that's why i put
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:42.000]  out my substack alexander covert news and the thing is you had on i believe dr laddapo and on the show
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:48.800]  um joe laddapo research in general i mean think about it he they just produced a study showing
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:56.800]  that uh the the vaccine the gene injection causes a serious cardiac risk in particularly males
[1:34:56.800 --> 1:35:03.840]  and he's been under attack by the media by uh uh so-called scientists and doctors who are trying
[1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:10.880]  to vilify his work but they are saying oh well his study included small sample size well physo
[1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:17.600]  just got an ea you approve emergency use authorization by fba for the bivalent booster
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:24.640]  that you mentioned earlier based on eight mice not even human beings eight mice decided the
[1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:32.160]  vaccination status of 200 million americans physo uses methodologies called immuno bridging
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:38.640]  they're talking about laddapo's methodology what about the immuno bridging that they invented
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:44.160]  to approve these vaccines in children this process where they just look at antibody levels in kids
[1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:50.320]  the physo trials and studies are junk moderna pure garbage science so they have no right going
[1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:56.480]  after people like laddapo but they come after me my color they come after rich cooled off
[1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:02.240]  all of us were trying to educate the public because they have been flat wrong every single
[1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:08.480]  thing alex in agreement what you said earlier all of the lockdowns all of the school closures
[1:36:08.480 --> 1:36:15.680]  all of the masking the masking the blue surgical mask that we use the white cloth mask on our face
[1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:24.320]  from the word go we revealed all of the respiratory studies that showed for influenza etc even with
[1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:30.480]  this covid virus that it could not stop you from becoming infected or even transmitting all of these
[1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:35.840]  masks from the word go when we were wearing these masks on the buses when we went out in public in
[1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:40.960]  the restaurants i have to say it in the only way i could because we wrote and we published
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:46.480]  they were junk they never worked they never worked and when scientists like yourself tried to expose
[1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:51.360]  it you got censored i remember being in a grocery store in florida on a short vacation two years
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:55.920]  ago and it was all hysteria and people screaming at me put your mask on even though there was no
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:00.240]  order at that time to do it think of the discrimination of the bullying uh that people
[1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:03.920]  that didn't want to take the experimental shot or where the mask have gone through i mean this is
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:09.440]  the real discriminate the real discrimination that's going on yes and that's the point that's
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:14.000]  why when this Pfizer executive is now stating that the vaccine does not stop transmitting they
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:20.080]  didn't study it even but we know it does not stop it based on what has unfolded all of the vaccinated
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:25.920]  people are becoming infected in fact not even infected hospitalized and now we are seeing data
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:31.440]  and we have reports of them becoming severe and some dying so the fact of the matter is that
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:38.960]  everything that they told us every single thing that the CDC NIH Pfizer Moderna FDA
[1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:46.000]  relies you can't put it together in any kind of coherent explanation that anything made sense
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:53.520]  but we went along each step of the way informing the public and as you said we were cancelled
[1:37:53.520 --> 1:38:00.560]  we were tax made we were vilified but we have been proven you Alex from day one if people
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:05.280]  go back from the beginning of this pandemic and what you were saying and who you had on
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:11.840]  you are now being proven you are vindicated because sadly we don't want to win this kind of argument
[1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:18.880]  but suddenly we were correct we were correct when we said that everything was wrong and let me stop
[1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:22.480]  you because i want you to start over this is so important it's not about us saying we were right
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:27.440]  as you're saying it's that they're going to try it again and they need to be punished so as patriots
[1:38:27.440 --> 1:38:31.680]  and hardworking people we don't like to crow about how we're right we like to kind of just move on
[1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:35.440]  but we can't move on they've got to be sued they've got to be prosecuted and we've got to keep
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:40.880]  pointing out to everybody we were right or the same criminal multinational big pharma medical
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:46.800]  tyranny u n claus law bill gates operation is getting loaded ready to run a whole new attack
[1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:54.800]  very soon i agree with you and an example is this bivalent booster they've got a booster based on a
[1:38:54.800 --> 1:38:59.680]  rodent model to try to vaccinate and they're trying to vaccinate children they were approved
[1:38:59.680 --> 1:39:05.520]  yesterday i believe for five year olds i mean we have laid out the evidence in the science
[1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:13.920]  not one healthy child in united states not one healthy child in sweden in germany etc has gotten
[1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:20.800]  covid infection and gotten severely ill or died if you bring forward a child that you say this person
[1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:26.880]  this individual got covid and died what martin mccowie johns hopkins university epidemiologist
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:33.520]  has stated his group of study data the fact of the matter is those children were severely ill
[1:39:33.520 --> 1:39:40.080]  those children had serious compromise those were not well people so all of the science that the other
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:46.400]  side is putting out let's say quote unquote cbc it's always to mislead it's always to deceive
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:53.040]  and all the public wants its proper information correct information i totally agree doctor so
[1:39:53.040 --> 1:39:57.840]  you've been an advisory level at the white house uh at health and human services what is
[1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:03.520]  what can congress what can governors what can legislatures what can what can we as citizens
[1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:08.640]  do to stop this war on our children is because you know many jurisdictions in california and
[1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:13.840]  new york other areas are still trying to bully parents uh into taking these experimental shots
[1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:20.240]  for their children this is a true crime against humanity what can we do well i mean one of the
[1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:26.000]  key issues is what you've been doing people like yourself and bringing us on and showcasing us and
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  when you speak we have to keep arming the population with the information and supporting them and let
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:36.640]  them know they're not insane because that's what the governments etc and cdc and these alphabet
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:42.640]  agencies tried to make the population and parents think that you're insane for thinking oh my children
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:47.680]  don't really need those masks and they don't need you so no you are not insane parents and the
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:53.040]  population have become very critical thinkers and they need to remain so and they need to double down
[1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:59.840]  because these people won't stop and the reality is we have elections in november we need to vote
[1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:06.160]  every single one who did this to us all of those who voted wrongfully we need to look at their voting
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:12.560]  record republicans and democrats not just democrats any single person vote them out congress
[1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:18.160]  and senate and let's get our government in order and when jim jordan i like jim jordan
[1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:23.520]  i like sliz i like this rand paul i like these people i like a lot of things they say i don't
[1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:28.720]  agree with everything but when they talk about when we get back power we will start a man i don't
[1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:34.000]  want to hear hearings we have all of the information and jim i'm talking to you i know jim i met him
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:39.920]  in congress i'm talking to you we don't want hearings you have the science and the data already
[1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:45.840]  we want people in a proper docket answering on the earth and we want them held accountable
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:50.640]  that's where the american people have gotten to no more of these congressional senate sub

[1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:18.160]  think about how info wars is cited by joe rogan and tucker carlson and ball senaro and other foreign
[1:43:18.160 --> 1:43:26.800]  leaders like nigel farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:33.920]  new world order the only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and

[1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:38.080]  that are patiently holding i appreciate you being there but then norm paddice is going to pop in
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:43.600]  and lay out the travesty of justice everybody needs to understand is a blueprint for everybody else
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:47.360]  that just happened with this kangaroo court where the judge found me guilty wouldn't let us put on
[1:47:47.360 --> 1:47:52.080]  evidence and then they had a billion dollar judgment which we're going to appeal will be on for years
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:54.800]  as long as you support us that's why the plaintiff's lawyer's got up there and said
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:59.520]  do not give him money he's horrible he's a bad person because they don't want us to appeal because
[1:47:59.520 --> 1:48:03.200]  they know there's a very good chance i mean they're saying a hundred percent what they did is never
[1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:06.880]  before been done if they don't then we know that the whole system is even more corrupt than we
[1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:12.480]  thought which may happen i'm not backing down i might be dead or put in prison i'm by now i thought
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:18.800]  i mean i never intended to be alive this long i want to live but i'm signed on for this i signed
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:23.760]  on for this and you know i guess you can say it's in my blood i don't claim i'm a hero or anything
[1:48:23.760 --> 1:48:28.800]  but you know a lot of my family you know highly decorated the military never made a big deal about
[1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:33.760]  it but they didn't back down in a fight that was fighting overseas some cases questionable
[1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:38.080]  situations but they were still good people because they were americans they thought they were doing
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:43.760]  good but i'm willing to do whatever it takes here in this country when the actual the republic
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:49.600]  is under total attack and it's going to be and i'm not trying to ingratiate myself i'm not trying to
[1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:54.560]  butter him up and i know great doctors like dr alexander aren't like this but
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:49:01.360]  we need to celebrate the moral courage of dr alexander and dr peter mccullough and dr uh
[1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:06.080]  i mean the list going on dr wakefield hundreds and hundreds of prominent people that came out and
[1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:11.120]  broke the back of this and joe rogan uh you know got their major heat and and really did this and
[1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:15.520]  this broadcast we would still be under their tyranny they would still be coming with force
[1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:20.880]  injections if you hadn't stood up so it's a real fight but i think the theme dr alexander
[1:49:20.880 --> 1:49:26.160]  who again worked inside the federal government and advised president trump is telling you is
[1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:30.720]  it's not just vengeance or vindictiveness it's not even justice
[1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:35.760]  to go after these folks we've got to beat the drum for their investigation their indictment
[1:49:35.760 --> 1:49:41.280]  their imprisonment because they are a biomedical tyranny we just saw eco health alliance peter
[1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:46.480]  dadzik who bragged they cooked up very similar viruses to cova 19 and we know it's man made
[1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:52.000]  getting a bunch more money so these people are arrogant and as senator paul has said they are
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:55.920]  threatening civilization these bio weapons are just as dangerous as nuclear weapons in my view
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:00.960]  so can can you speak to that dr alexander tell folks about your sub stack and then any other
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:06.320]  key points you'd like to impart to folks sure well again my sub stack you could reach it and it's
[1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:12.480]  for free yeah there's a i think a $50 yearly fee if you want but otherwise you can subscribe for
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:20.080]  free it's alexander space coven space news alexander coven news look rand paul is a good guy
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:25.920]  i respect his intelligence i like his battle capability and what he's doing but let me say
[1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:32.160]  this way you raise a very important topic here with this uh dr second day you have a situation
[1:50:32.160 --> 1:50:39.040]  where they wrote a paper frank barric for universal north carolina chapel hill in 2015
[1:50:39.040 --> 1:50:46.480]  with menachari that paper that was published in 2015 was the seminal paper that paper laid out
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:54.400]  for us what they imagine they were telling us in 2015 what they were doing with this coronavirus
[1:50:55.040 --> 1:51:00.480]  they were stitching together various viruses portions of viruses and creating these chimeric
[1:51:00.480 --> 1:51:06.560]  viruses and they were trying to examine this spillover effect whether they could create
[1:51:06.560 --> 1:51:13.600]  this zoonotic jump from animal to human uh where they could make the virus much more infectious
[1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:20.800]  and legal and they did they told us in that 2015 paper that we just created a chimeric virus
[1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:28.320]  that we have no response to vaccine wise they said so vaccine does work any of the antivirus
[1:51:28.320 --> 1:51:34.560]  etc does not work and that this so we just created here and they looked at it in vitro
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:40.960]  there's any test human in dish and they even reported in vivo that was the animal studies
[1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:48.640]  that paper by menachari is so critical they told us this has pandemic potential lethal pandemic
[1:51:48.640 --> 1:51:56.960]  potential to the to the world yeah nobody paid attention to the 50 paper and from what barric
[1:51:56.960 --> 1:52:03.200]  and they did and dr Alexander stop right there dr Alexander stop right there your skype has been
[1:52:03.200 --> 1:52:08.000]  great but it broke up the last 10 seconds you were getting into chimeric behaviors start over
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:15.440]  yeah well what they did was they stitched together these viruses and they created a new virus
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:21.760]  they were trying to examine a range of coronaviruses to see how they could make it more infectious
[1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:26.880]  and more lethal whether or not you tell me in the future where the military was involved
[1:52:26.880 --> 1:52:32.400]  because they were benevolent i think the military is benevolent and to me it would be a
[1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:37.760]  hard question agree with you that the military should not have been looking at this because if
[1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:44.320]  soviet union at that point in the in a cold war if china etc were developing biological weapons
[1:52:44.320 --> 1:52:50.320]  we needed to know what they were doing and how we could react from an antidote point of view so even
[1:52:50.320 --> 1:52:55.840]  if you told me it was going on below the table i would even be willing in some way to accept that
[1:52:55.840 --> 1:53:01.040]  because the military is there to protect the society in the womb land however it was when
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:10.080]  frances collins fauci barric desic from eco health barric from north carolina when these people got
[1:53:10.080 --> 1:53:15.840]  involved something seems to have gone wrong there whether it was because it became a money making
[1:53:15.840 --> 1:53:21.360]  issue or they lost control of what they were doing or they were just power drunk people thinking they
[1:53:21.360 --> 1:53:30.800]  could create frankenstein viruses but they did that paper in 2015 told us they told us we
[1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:40.320]  just created corona virus that is lethal that has no vaccine response no antiviral response
[1:53:40.320 --> 1:53:47.600]  we just created it in 2015 so when these people talk about this this started to spread in february
[1:53:47.600 --> 1:53:54.080]  2020 i'm telling you we're already seeing data that's showing us information we could go back to
[1:53:54.080 --> 1:54:02.240]  december 2019 september 2019 june 2019 we are even beginning to hear whispers now this was around in
[1:54:02.240 --> 1:54:10.640]  2018 i am arguing it was something devastating happened we need frances collins and fauci
[1:54:10.640 --> 1:54:17.920]  under oath because they created a devastating monster with a bunch of poison pills we don't
[1:54:17.920 --> 1:54:24.000]  even know what's coming down the line and they're trying to force this vaccine that does not work
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:32.400]  and i want to tell the public it as simple as i can we actually knew that as long as from day one
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:40.080]  if we would have strongly properly protected the highest vulnerable elderly in our society
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:45.840]  we had early treatments we had prophylaxis treatments we had we knew of vitamin d and its
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:50.880]  role if we would have protected them in the nursing home properly double down triple down
[1:54:50.880 --> 1:54:58.960]  protections and let the rest of society it's the only way that you could tame a pandemic like this
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:05.280]  because this vaccine failed out of the gate we should have allowed the society to naturally
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:13.200]  harmlessly live lives they're healthy and well and confront the pathogen we're going to become
[1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:18.960]  naturally immune develop natural immunity properly and even mainline scientists like yourself
[1:55:18.960 --> 1:55:24.480]  weren't giving people experimental shots during a pandemic could soup it up and create worse versions
[1:55:24.480 --> 1:55:29.120]  which it did but finally enough people naturally got it to stop it thank you so much for your time

[2:00:24.160 --> 2:00:31.440]  love you love your show love you uh just wanted to let you know that uh you know obviously you've
[2:00:31.440 --> 2:00:39.440]  been targeted and i just wanted to say that uh if listeners think that they shouldn't support you
[2:00:39.440 --> 2:00:49.120]  if if you were to fail within two years those coins that they buy from the the coin store
[2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:57.840]  are going to be worth a lot more money than they think that it is possibly imaginable and they
[2:00:57.840 --> 2:01:02.800]  should start to invest in well let's hope that doesn't happen but yeah if somebody shoots me
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:07.200]  next week we sell those coins the big markup as a fundraiser but they'll probably worth five
[2:01:07.200 --> 2:01:15.920]  thousand dollars a piece absolutely and knowing that but your message has already been given because
[2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:23.520]  oh this is a piece of revolutionary 1776 2.0 this is historic americana whether we win or fail
[2:01:23.520 --> 2:01:31.440]  these coins are history absolutely and knowing that but we need to support free speech and that's
[2:01:31.440 --> 2:01:39.600]  what your lawyer said is that free speech is dead based on what is already happening which is you
[2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:46.960]  have been denied your free speech you cannot comment on anything which is going to go across the
[2:01:46.960 --> 2:01:54.080]  spectrum now across all media not the biggest publication in europe the london guardian is the
[2:01:54.080 --> 2:02:01.200]  biggest in europe the biggest in the uk they are calling for me to be criminally silenced under law
[2:02:01.200 --> 2:02:05.760]  that i'm not allowed to be heard from so the next level where you where where where where i
[2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:13.440]  where i am not allowed to speak in public or or have a show or anything well in in addition to that
[2:02:14.240 --> 2:02:21.840]  that you have now mentioned things that they don't want to talk about which is the vaccine
[2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:30.080]  which we now know is 37 000 probably dead due to the vaccine sure sure that that's all fairs it's
[2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:36.480]  one of honor there it's probably six million well of course but they lie about everything
[2:02:36.480 --> 2:02:43.280]  and that and and that's why they don't want to talk about all these things it's because they say
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:51.600]  okay alex jones is the enemy okay so if alex jones is the enemy and he's been sued for a
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:59.360]  billion dollars which is ridiculous it what are we going to what's our repercussion for trying to

[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:57.440]  let's go ahead and talk to chris go on chris chief in south carolina chief thanks for holding
[2:09:58.480 --> 2:10:03.360]  alex ajan brother go ahead and that was pretty hard to follow but i wanted to bring up something
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:08.560]  here someone's talking about this morning at the end of the american journal um his guest pointed
[2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:13.440]  out there's a possibility that trump could if we take a big enough majority in the house
[2:10:14.160 --> 2:10:18.080]  become the speaker of the house and i'm not sure about the technicalities of that but
[2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:21.680]  i wanted to propose a pretty radical sequence of events that could follow
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:27.840]  so if we went a big enough majority in both the house and the senate there's a distinct possibility
[2:10:27.840 --> 2:10:35.280]  that we could perforce and succeed in an impeachment of both uh biden and harris and then who would be
[2:10:35.280 --> 2:10:43.600]  the uh next succession for the presidency in that case remind me uh speaker of the house
[2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:50.640]  donald trump no uh fdr wasn't good for much but uh as a lesson learned after his uh presidency we
[2:10:51.440 --> 2:10:56.480]  wrote the 22nd amendment to the constitution which basically limits uh presidential terms the two full
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:11:03.760]  terms and up to slightly less than a half of another term so if that happened trump could
[2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:10.480]  also run in 24 beautiful point i'm a little high on the holy ghost right now but i do know you're
[2:11:10.480 --> 2:11:16.080]  right it would be the uh speaker of the house after that and look here's my frustration
[2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:21.360]  this is all coming out and where is trump on the shots i still they hate him i know he's good
[2:11:21.360 --> 2:11:26.000]  but i mean i don't think if he got president again i don't think he pushed new poison shots on us
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:32.160]  you know he pushed uh regeneron he pushed hydroxychloroquine he pushed ivermectin
[2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:36.400]  he just he was pushing everything just believing the medical you know independence you name it big
[2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:40.880]  pharma and that's really his blind spot i really think he needs to come out against it the sanis
[2:11:40.880 --> 2:11:47.440]  is the sanis knows how to calculate the cabbage yeah and uh on that point you know i lost faith
[2:11:47.440 --> 2:11:51.200]  in electoral politics in november of 2020 so i don't know if i'll ever be brought back into the
[2:11:51.200 --> 2:11:55.360]  fold on that but just kind of rekindle some curiosity in me and i figured out no no i think
[2:11:55.360 --> 2:11:59.920]  it's very important and the people are hungry for change thank you chief ray in kentucky welcome sir
[2:11:59.920 --> 2:12:07.760]  all right how you doing alex i'm good all right all right so all of this drama going on
[2:12:07.760 --> 2:12:12.960]  surrounding you know i'm good you know i'm good because i have you badass listeners and activists
[2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:18.480]  and i love you go ahead that's what's up man you know i called you a couple uh couple weeks ago
[2:12:18.480 --> 2:12:23.600]  about the stuff in the schools against the children and after that call man i've been getting spiritual
[2:12:23.600 --> 2:12:27.920]  attacks left and right so i just wanted to bring you a little bit of this i know you're
[2:12:27.920 --> 2:12:35.040]  going into interviews and you need some balance and clarity in this so okay i'll make it quick
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:44.720]  in the good book it says that we are supposed to um fight against powers and principalities
[2:12:44.720 --> 2:12:50.080]  and that's exactly what you're doing he gives us the power to cast out demons right by the
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:56.960]  command of our word in jesus christ holy name okay now aside from the religious aspect of it as far
[2:12:56.960 --> 2:13:03.920]  as you know the the thumpers go i just wanted to say heavenly father bless alex jones and his whole
[2:13:03.920 --> 2:13:09.840]  family because this is what he needs and what he's asking for surround him with the armor of god and
[2:13:09.840 --> 2:13:15.680]  keep it locked firm in place that any kind of demonic entities or any of that stuff can just
[2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:21.920]  stick to their worldly nonsense and have alex rise up over them for support and love man
[2:13:21.920 --> 2:13:28.640]  and jesus christ holy name the son of god bless you alex keep it going okay i bless you i will
[2:13:28.640 --> 2:13:33.200]  brother i really appreciate you let's talk to james of alcohol but james you're on the air

[2:13:46.480 --> 2:13:53.360]  sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men revile you and persecute you

[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:32.720]  and the truth will set you free and in the end jesus christ is the truth so you had so many people
[2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:38.400]  call into your show absolutely and there's always seems to show we're not screening calls we just
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:42.800]  get good you know playing phone lines it's all we ask but notice the theme is calling on god
[2:14:42.800 --> 2:14:47.840]  because that's really what it comes down to on the verge of nuclear war and let me mention
[2:14:47.840 --> 2:14:51.920]  something else real quick here um you know this is a matrix they're trying to draw you back into
[2:14:51.920 --> 2:14:58.320]  the matrix the money scheme is a joke the elections are a joke everything's a joke you know i mean

[2:20:24.400 --> 2:20:29.200]  on this segment of the info warshore i was the guy standing in court yesterday when the verdict
[2:20:29.200 --> 2:20:35.680]  came in against alex jones and free speech systems nearly a billion dollars for reputational harm
[2:20:35.680 --> 2:20:44.400]  and emotional distress to 15 members of families who lost someone who at sandy hook into a retire
[2:20:44.400 --> 2:20:49.840]  to an fbi agent i keep saying retirees not he was quick to remind everyone of that what happened
[2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:55.520]  you're wondering and what's the future hold for free speech systems and is there legal relief
[2:20:55.520 --> 2:21:01.280]  well i'm a lawyer so i still believe in the rule of law and i will never have had it have in my
[2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:06.080]  career a greater honor than the privilege i had of standing in the well of a courtroom
[2:21:06.080 --> 2:21:12.800]  losing with hostility to alex and reminding everybody that equal justice under law is written
[2:21:12.800 --> 2:21:17.840]  etched over the portal the doorway to the united states supreme court and that's the best that we
[2:21:17.840 --> 2:21:25.280]  can offer in this country equal justice under law what i didn't expect was law fair in this case
[2:21:25.280 --> 2:21:32.320]  an effort to twist the law to silence an unpopular voice to silence a man i referred to in my closing
[2:21:32.320 --> 2:21:38.880]  argument as a mad prophet you know alex goes he and when he goes sometimes i understand what he's
[2:21:38.880 --> 2:21:44.560]  saying sometimes they don't sometimes that flat out disagree um but i will defend the death of the
[2:21:44.560 --> 2:21:51.120]  right uh is right to speak his mind and i know to a moral certainty that those of you listening
[2:21:51.120 --> 2:21:56.640]  out there not a one of you have been compelled to listen you are drawn to the flame is it a
[2:21:56.640 --> 2:22:02.000]  sacred flame a profane flame i'll let him make his own representations but you are drawn to the
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:08.640]  flame of his passion because he's portraying a world you know to be true a world in which things
[2:22:08.640 --> 2:22:13.200]  don't work and you're looking for answers and you're not getting them from the politicians
[2:22:13.200 --> 2:22:16.960]  you're not getting them from the mainstream press and you're not getting them from most
[2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:22.800]  institutions that serve our society there's a wholesale legitimation crisis going on
[2:22:22.800 --> 2:22:27.520]  many of us can't tell the difference between a gang and the government and when that happens
[2:22:27.520 --> 2:22:32.800]  society is in collapse and so what i think the info wars is attempting to do and it's attempting
[2:22:32.800 --> 2:22:39.360]  to do still is to shine a bright light in dark places to unmask things so that you can reach
[2:22:39.360 --> 2:22:45.360]  conclusions for yourself about what's going on so what happened in the courtroom first there was
[2:22:45.360 --> 2:22:51.840]  never a trial on liability alex was defaulted by a judge a judge he's judge decided that his
[2:22:51.840 --> 2:22:59.200]  liability for certain torts torts a latin word comes from word torches are twisted for certain
[2:22:59.200 --> 2:23:04.800]  for defamation for intentional inflation of private of emotional stress for breach of
[2:23:04.800 --> 2:23:10.480]  privacy by publication of private facts and shockingly a violation of the connecticut
[2:23:10.480 --> 2:23:16.400]  untrick unfair trade practices that all these things were established without proof and so we
[2:23:16.400 --> 2:23:22.240]  moved into and why because alex didn't quote unquote substantially comply with discovery
[2:23:22.240 --> 2:23:26.960]  now i'll go to an appellate quarter i hope i'll go one some lawyer i hope will soon go to an
[2:23:26.960 --> 2:23:31.840]  appellate court and say whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a minute there was no substantial
[2:23:31.840 --> 2:23:36.880]  compliance with discovery what about the hundred thousand or so documents that we gave what about
[2:23:36.880 --> 2:23:42.320]  the 30 40 50 depositions that alex and his employees that for what about the request for
[2:23:42.320 --> 2:23:48.000]  admissions that we entered what about the electronic data that we provided was it perfect
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:52.960]  no but what happened is in the trial court the lawyers for the sandy hook parent were able to
[2:23:52.960 --> 2:23:58.800]  parents were able to persuade the trial judge that alex jones was a little mini ibm um that he
[2:23:58.800 --> 2:24:03.920]  should have been as well organized as a well-heeled corporation and when he wasn't when he couldn't
[2:24:03.920 --> 2:24:09.280]  meet that standard of perfection they held this organization against them and you know it was it
[2:24:09.280 --> 2:24:15.840]  wasn't it is disorganized there's no um central switch board at info wars there's no organizational
[2:24:15.840 --> 2:24:21.600]  chart it's a goose reporting structure of people it's a charismatic organization revolving around
[2:24:21.600 --> 2:24:28.720]  alex's talent they got the default we went to trial and the jury was told um that liability had
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:34.800]  been established and we were there solely to prove the extent of damages the plaintiff suffered but
[2:24:34.800 --> 2:24:41.840]  here's where it got absolutely crazy and i've never seen anything like it in 30 some years of
[2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:47.520]  trying cases and i've tried hundreds of cases across the country involving complex and simple
[2:24:47.520 --> 2:24:54.480]  matters murder down the speeding um here's what the judge told me they could assume that it was
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:25:00.720]  established that any harm these individuals claimed over a 10-year period was alex's fault
[2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:05.920]  they didn't have to prove a nexus or a connection to alex did somebody call you in the middle of
[2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:11.920]  the night and mutter sweet hostilities into your ear alex's fault did somebody leave a card on your
[2:25:11.920 --> 2:25:18.000]  windshield alex's fault did somebody leave a note on your door alex's fault did somebody look at
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:25.600]  you funny alex's fault this strained the concept of causation in ways that i have never seen done
[2:25:25.600 --> 2:25:30.960]  before and so i would object on grounds of hearsay when they talk about a threat they received
[2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:36.560]  overrule i would say lack of foundation how do you try that to alex tie that to alex overrule
[2:25:36.560 --> 2:25:41.760]  they had a young man on the on the uh they produced evidence about a young man named mark mill
[2:25:41.760 --> 2:25:47.360]  he was once a caller on info wars um and alex had spoken to him about his crashing of a super bowl
[2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:53.120]  press conference where he got up and said 9 11's an inside job alex and he talked that alex said
[2:25:53.120 --> 2:25:57.680]  i'd like to send you some assignments do you want to work with us they spoke off here no one knows
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:02.640]  what they spoke about because mark mills wasn't called as a witness alex jones wasn't questioned
[2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:07.200]  about it when he was on the stand there's no evidence that mark mills was ever employed by
[2:26:07.200 --> 2:26:14.240]  info wars but yet when he turned up 16 months later at an event hosted by sandy hook parents
[2:26:14.240 --> 2:26:20.160]  or a sandy hook family rather um and was arrested for for something they didn't tell us what um
[2:26:21.040 --> 2:26:27.760]  he was he was concluded to have been sent there by alex and that's just sheer madness and so
[2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:34.400]  those are among the sorts of issues that we will take up on appeal in terms of the trial itself
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:40.080]  alex was called as a witness and he was cross-examined by the lead plaintiff's lawyer and i'd never
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:45.600]  and this was also a shocking display of anger the likes of which i'd never seen he demand began
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:50.640]  to scream it alex alex held his composure pushed back i'm in the background screaming objection
[2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:56.640]  objection objection nobody could get a word in edmont edgewise it was sheer chaos i thought
[2:26:56.640 --> 2:27:00.640]  that alex had been abused by the plaintiff's lawyer when i rose that when i raised that
[2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:05.360]  topic with the judge she didn't want to hear about it she warned me that i might be held in contempt
[2:27:05.360 --> 2:27:10.720]  as god is my witness i have never been in a courtroom where i was threatened with contempt
[2:27:10.720 --> 2:27:17.680]  for being an aggressive advocate on behalf of my client so you know yesterday the the plaintiffs
[2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:25.200]  asked for $550,000 you know there are their lawyers that were plaintiffs some 8.2 billion
[2:27:25.200 --> 2:27:31.040]  we closed our closed arguments they closing arguments so we could go tomorrow they the jury
[2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:36.000]  had the case briefly thursday they were out all day friday no court monday because it was
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:41.920]  you know it indigenous people's day also known to red blooded americans as columbus day um the
[2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:47.360]  jury came back tuesday was out and along the way they were asking questions of the the court
[2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:52.800]  how what are we to do what do we make of these damages claims there was no evidence that anyone
[2:27:52.800 --> 2:27:58.480]  visited psychiatric or site facilities and produced bills there was nominal evidence that i
[2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:04.160]  should say um there but no bills were presented no one presented evidence lost wages no one
[2:28:04.160 --> 2:28:10.080]  presented any economic harm at all it was all what lawyers call soft money and so the jury
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:15.600]  didn't know what to do with that i had my hopes that they would return to a modest verdict that
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:21.600]  they wouldn't let passion um um an anger about alex and his message sympathy for the family
[2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:28.640]  cloud their judgment but i feared they did and the result was a verdict of about 9.7 million
[2:28:28.640 --> 2:28:33.920]  billion dollars the bad news is there's more to come there'll be further proceedings in which
[2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:38.320]  attorney fees will be awarded that'll probably be about 40 percent if the one billion so there's
[2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:43.600]  400 million um and then maybe another billion in punitive damages just passed by the court
[2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:48.720]  so there is a concerted effort to silence ballot to the info war um i'm not sure it's related
[2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:54.800]  necessarily to sandy hook because rather than thanking the jury um for the justice done to his
[2:28:54.800 --> 2:29:01.360]  plaintiffs it's our best seller we first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate
[2:29:01.360 --> 2:29:07.280]  seller but as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made him feel and how

[2:31:23.440 --> 2:31:29.760]  up their main base to defeat the new world order the only reason humanity is still in the fight
[2:31:29.760 --> 2:31:36.080]  today because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this

[2:32:11.120 --> 2:32:17.200]  point blank range in the information war but i don't deserve the credit yes i've persevered
[2:32:17.200 --> 2:32:22.240]  but the listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real reason we've had the success
[2:32:22.960 --> 2:32:27.840]  we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new world order we've ever had
[2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:35.200]  that we are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[2:32:35.200 --> 2:32:39.760]  than ever realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've
[2:32:39.760 --> 2:32:46.560]  been tearing out and to intensify them god bless you all i salute you i thank you and i beg you to
[2:32:46.560 --> 2:32:51.680]  intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this brief is happening the
[2:32:51.680 --> 2:33:00.000]  fight is my fight it's your fight it's our fight god bless you all leading a frontal assault on the
[2:33:00.000 --> 2:33:03.920]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:16.800 --> 2:33:20.560]  for the creation of all the craziness that affected the sandy hooked world
[2:33:20.560 --> 2:33:26.800]  and the sandy hooked parents you and i we all know better why the jury was permitted to
[2:33:27.520 --> 2:33:33.840]  make a decision based on an incomplete record is a mystery to us and it's a mystery that we
[2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:38.320]  will address in the appellate court from my perspective this is as dark and disturbing
[2:33:38.320 --> 2:33:43.440]  and experiencing court as i have had in a professional lifetime and that includes cases
[2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:48.960]  involving the death of children and the murder of spouses so we look forward to our prospects on
[2:33:48.960 --> 2:33:54.720]  appeal i congratulate the folks at koskoff koskoff and beater my heart goes out to the families
[2:33:54.720 --> 2:34:01.200]  we live in divided times uh they've been weaponized and used for political purposes um in this
[2:34:01.920 --> 2:34:07.600]  but we will be added as long as it takes and if you're out there right now and you're one of alex
[2:34:07.600 --> 2:34:12.880]  jones's audience members and you're considering giving him money i just want you to know that
[2:34:12.880 --> 2:34:17.840]  based on the jury's verdict today it's not a very good bet uh and to go back with to what
[2:34:17.840 --> 2:34:24.160]  robbie parker said all alex jones does is take from you exploit you lie to you
[2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:30.560]  feed your fears and your anxieties and your mistrust and the only person that benefits in
[2:34:30.560 --> 2:34:36.320]  that equation is him well that stops that's stopping today thanks to the courage of these
[2:34:36.320 --> 2:34:44.720]  families thank you very much thanks everybody that this massive financial penalty which does
[2:34:44.720 --> 2:34:50.560]  nothing to alleviate the suffering from the loss of their kids i'm sure all of these families i know
[2:34:50.560 --> 2:34:56.320]  all these families would trade every penny to have their kids back for a minute um what exists in
[2:34:56.320 --> 2:35:02.880]  the law to make sure that the financial penalty is paid by jones yeah let's first note what exists
[2:35:02.880 --> 2:35:08.720]  in the law to actually give payback for lies because we've assumed over the last many years
[2:35:08.720 --> 2:35:14.080]  there's nothing that can be done we've accepted it just today trump was ordered to stand for
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:20.000]  deposition next week in a defamation suit by gene carroll and it's the same so this
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:25.520]  you know does show that the law can sometimes redress the lies themselves what can be done
[2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:31.760]  it's a it's an old sorry uh tale that that it's one thing to get a verdict and another thing to
[2:35:31.760 --> 2:35:38.080]  chase it you can attach his assets you i'm sure there will be subsequent litigation where he'll
[2:35:38.080 --> 2:35:43.600]  say bankruptcy and they'll try to get forensic investigators and say he doesn't have it but
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:51.760]  we're talking about such outsized numbers that even if he's able to bob and weave some i just don't
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:59.680]  see how he winds up anything but basically broke now for the rest of his life so it's in fact
[2:35:59.680 --> 2:36:04.960]  defendants who have been held guilty often do squirm away one of them's named donald trump
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:10.880]  but uh there are mechanisms to attach assets and at the end of the day the sheriff will come
[2:36:10.880 --> 2:36:16.560]  and you know attach the home once you can prove that he's got assets to pay that'll be the fight
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:22.400]  and by the way if he doesn't have enough everything he does have goes to them
[2:36:24.560 --> 2:36:32.240]  total and complete lies everything he gets now goes to them uh no they they don't want you to
[2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:37.760]  know about appeals they don't want you to know about any of these processes and when i do my show
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:42.320]  for basically nothing you get nothing and i keep waging war on the new world order you will not
[2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:47.760]  silence us that's why we got two years of appeals straight ahead save info wars dot com i gotta pay
[2:36:47.760 --> 2:36:52.480]  for 40 of those appeals free speech space for 60 that's all of you paying for that it's a war you
[2:36:52.480 --> 2:36:58.080]  want to fight i'm the dog in the fight bet on me you know chris man he said do not donate money to
[2:36:58.080 --> 2:37:02.880]  jones do not buy his products do not bet on him do not bet on yourself we're gonna go back to norm
[2:37:02.880 --> 2:37:07.120]  patis to get more information from him i just finished up with eric bolding on newsmax we're

[2:37:41.520 --> 2:37:46.720]  there right now and you're one of alex jones's audience members and you're considering giving
[2:37:46.720 --> 2:37:51.120]  him money i just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today it's not a very good bet
[2:37:52.160 --> 2:37:59.520]  and to go back with to what robbie parker said all alex jones does is take from you exploit you lie
[2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:06.160]  to you feed your fears and your anxieties and your mistrust and the only person that benefits
[2:38:06.160 --> 2:38:12.000]  in that equation is him well that stops that's stopping today thanks to the courage of these
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  families thank you very much thanks everybody all right there you go ladies and gentlemen norm
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:23.600]  paddice the ultimate show trial even mainline lawyers are saying historians this is the worst
[2:38:23.600 --> 2:38:28.800]  show trial in us history totally rigged at every level the appeals where is it all going because
[2:38:28.800 --> 2:38:33.680]  they're now admitting it's the blueprint to go after everybody else well apparently so i don't
[2:38:33.680 --> 2:38:37.520]  know if you saw the guardian yet today you know they're calling for out and out government regulation
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:41.840]  of speech to prevent things like this from happening again i think the good news for
[2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:46.400]  those of us who care about free speech in the country is this case will not serve as a precedent
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:52.000]  because i doubt any other case will result in a in in a in a default of this sort and i'm pretty
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:56.880]  confident we're going to be able to overturn that default and the jury could should have been permitted
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:39:02.960]  to consider um what you gave uh why you gave it why there wasn't more and if the court really
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:07.840]  thought you withheld something let the jury draw an adverse inference but by all means let you defend
[2:39:07.840 --> 2:39:13.360]  the basis of your speech and your right to speak and by all means do not send the jury in with a
[2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:19.120]  blank check on causation such that everything anyone in this country said that expressed any
[2:39:19.120 --> 2:39:26.480]  symptom skepticism about anything related to sandy hook for the last 10 years that's all alex's fault
[2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:30.480]  and i just don't think there's a pellet an appellate court in this country brazen enough
[2:39:30.480 --> 2:39:35.280]  to let that stand as to attorney maddie's claim you know i mean as i was listening to him talk i
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:40.080]  kept waiting to hear the music from the exorcist play i mean that to me is chilling he stood in
[2:39:40.080 --> 2:39:45.120]  front of the jury and asked for compensation for his plaintiffs then he stood on the courthouse
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:49.520]  steps and said we're coming to get you alex we're going to silence you and those of you who
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:54.320]  listened to alex we're going to deprive you of his voice but here's the fallacy in what maddie
[2:39:54.320 --> 2:40:01.280]  said i said it before before alex came and joined us here none of you not one of you is forced to
[2:40:01.280 --> 2:40:06.560]  listen to alex jones when you turn the radio on what you're listening listening to is a voice
[2:40:06.560 --> 2:40:12.400]  that you trust for one reason or another now maddie told the jury that alex's job is to make you
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:17.440]  afraid so he can take your money i think there's an opposite reality and it's the reality that i've
[2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:22.240]  seen at work in my experience with info wars in the last three and a half years alex is talking
[2:40:22.240 --> 2:40:28.160]  about what scares him and it scares you too and to keep up that fight they need to raise money
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:32.720]  and they sell products well that's right and you've been here you you see that it's norm you've
[2:40:32.720 --> 2:40:37.600]  been here you've seen the opposite nobody's telling me what to say i'm doing my own preparation
[2:40:37.600 --> 2:40:43.040]  i don't control the other host i'm literally just a guy on the radio that's on tv who's pro america
[2:40:43.040 --> 2:40:48.080]  the idea that oh they default to this because we didn't give them the evidence of some secret
[2:40:48.080 --> 2:40:54.560]  manipulative plan it's because it doesn't exist they got to take isolated pieces of evidence
[2:40:54.560 --> 2:41:00.000]  because of this default and the rule of causation and weave it into a story um that suited their
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:05.440]  purposes and their purpose was silencing you i was never able to talk about everything else
[2:41:05.440 --> 2:41:10.240]  you were involved in the jury doesn't know i don't think about the great reset of bestseller
[2:41:10.240 --> 2:41:14.560]  they don't know about they know very little about your war with the world economic forum
[2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:20.320]  they know almost nothing about your concern with artificial intelligence in the hands of big tech
[2:41:20.320 --> 2:41:27.680]  and social credit scoring such that we all become automatons and in a scheme rigged and
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:32.480]  designed by programmers serving other interests perhaps chinese communist party interests they
[2:41:32.480 --> 2:41:37.600]  know nothing of that they see they think that you woke up one morning and said i'm going to get rich
[2:41:37.600 --> 2:41:41.680]  quick i'm going to put a target on the back of the sandy hook families and i'm going to ride that
[2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:47.760]  all the way into what exactly where's that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow that jury was not
[2:41:47.760 --> 2:41:52.960]  even permitted to know by court order that free speech has been forced into bankruptcy as a result
[2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:58.560]  of crippling legal fees resulting from all this litigation in fact it affected our trial strategy
[2:41:58.560 --> 2:42:03.120]  because alex was in the following position the court had ordered him not to testify about a
[2:42:03.120 --> 2:42:10.240]  whole class of things which he believes to be true um but yet to sit for for for cross examination
[2:42:10.240 --> 2:42:14.400]  alex asked the court at one point you know if i answer this question truthfully will i
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:20.240]  i'll be in contempt if i if i answer it consistent with your order it'll be perjury so therefore
[2:42:20.240 --> 2:42:25.280]  he decided not to testify at all because even if he had to be placed in that vice if he had
[2:42:25.280 --> 2:42:30.000]  pled the fifth in the jury's presence they would have drawn an adverse inference against it so alex
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:35.040]  that for a cross examination was abused during it and then boycott of the rest hold on stay there
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:40.080]  i want to explain the big i want to spend the big secret of the mind control here this is big
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:43.920]  news when we come back i'm gonna explain something really key to everything that you already know but

[2:47:51.360 --> 2:47:57.760]  i'm like we already know that i know you know that you really get it how the enemy uses psychology
[2:47:57.760 --> 2:48:02.080]  the tricks they use because once you're aware of it it's all game over in fact i meant to tell
[2:48:02.080 --> 2:48:06.800]  the crew to do this pull up indiana jones and raiders law start the uh first temple scene
[2:48:06.800 --> 2:48:11.360]  where he's got the bag of sand and the gold idol and he wants to put the bag of sand on the lever
[2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:14.800]  so it doesn't trigger the booby traps but it doesn't weigh exactly the same amount so it
[2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:20.640]  does trigger it they took adam lanza and prozac and his mom getting the gun and the school stand down
[2:48:20.640 --> 2:48:25.440]  and just like evalde and they move that aside the idol and put the bag of sand up there alex jones
[2:48:26.080 --> 2:48:31.280]  in fact then mcbrane or one of the crew can create a meme where it's it's adam lanza is the you
[2:48:31.280 --> 2:48:35.920]  know the idol right there uh and uh you got alex jones the bag and then they just move it and switch
[2:48:35.920 --> 2:48:42.160]  it out they do this everywhere a white supremacist goes into a mainly black grocery store and kills
[2:48:42.160 --> 2:48:46.640]  a bunch of innocent hard-working people and they blame all white people and all gun owners no one
[2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:52.080]  scumbag did that who turns out had a federal handler they don't want us questioning that with
[2:48:52.080 --> 2:48:56.480]  some crazy evil black person goes out and kills innocent white people black people aren't to
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:49:02.160]  blame that bad persons to blame but that's how they're manipulating us and dividing us so
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:08.720]  i was on with eric bowling his shows on tonight's big hit show on uh newsmax i actually i watch it
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:12.800]  sometimes here at the office i like eric i've hung out with him had dinner a few times over the years
[2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:19.280]  he always plays a good cop bad cop on here but i i just said when when i'm in the grocery store
[2:49:19.280 --> 2:49:23.680]  or at church people walk over they say why don't you stop talking about sandy hook won't you leave
[2:49:23.680 --> 2:49:28.240]  the kids alone even have livasmith williamson that makes her money and lives off sandy hook
[2:49:28.240 --> 2:49:32.480]  come over to me and say that win them i'm gonna stop talking about it i barely ever talked about it
[2:49:32.480 --> 2:49:37.280]  they took it and blew it up and made it big and then said why is it such a big scandal jones
[2:49:37.280 --> 2:49:41.840]  should stop this and bowling said to me you'll see it tonight when it airs but they don't censor it
[2:49:43.280 --> 2:49:50.320]  he said why don't you stop i just told him 20 something minutes in evidence of me talking
[2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:57.360]  about sandy hook that's all they had and it's my right to talk about it and say it so they
[2:49:57.360 --> 2:50:01.840]  scapegoat me is killing the kids psychologically at the back of the mind alex jones sandy hook
[2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:05.440]  oh what the families went through and they cry about their kids getting killed and they talk about
[2:50:05.440 --> 2:50:11.120]  me for weeks is that's how they tell you your hitler they tell you your white supremacist they
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:14.000]  tell you you're bad because you don't submit to their agenda meanwhile they're the ones
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:18.480]  aborting 70 plus percent of black babies before they're born meanwhile we kicked hitler's ass
[2:50:18.480 --> 2:50:23.280]  both my grandfathers almost died world war two the army air corps how are you calling me hitler
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:28.080]  so they play this game stop letting them put you in the position of the bad guy
[2:50:28.080 --> 2:50:32.240]  so they can be in the superior position but but but that's the trick they play
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:37.680]  and bowling nose over at newsmax he's got to play along with that but i just said i barely covered it
[2:50:37.680 --> 2:50:42.640]  they make me the sandy hook guy and he's like why don't you knock it off and stop talking about it
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:47.840]  why don't i knock it off it's in thousands of newspapers today a billion dollar fake fine
[2:50:47.840 --> 2:50:55.120]  norm patis closing comments that on that topic you know we were prohibited from saying that
[2:50:55.120 --> 2:50:59.600]  we that you rarely covered it online by an order of the court why because when you got
[2:50:59.600 --> 2:51:03.760]  the platform you didn't have archives of all your videos they were youtube youtube
[2:51:03.760 --> 2:51:07.840]  the platform view you couldn't get them you couldn't produce them therefore they were able
[2:51:07.840 --> 2:51:12.400]  to say you talked about it all the time you were unable to say you couldn't but the truth is they
[2:51:12.400 --> 2:51:18.160]  used but they used prison planet dot tv now free archive of everyday show to go back and that's
[2:51:18.160 --> 2:51:22.400]  all they could find so we did actually produce it they just use youtube taking our thing down to
[2:51:22.400 --> 2:51:27.920]  claim we didn't produce it yeah absolutely and it was they use twitter they use twitter remember
[2:51:27.920 --> 2:51:35.360]  early on in texas the judge is saying that because twitter took my tweets down i was in default
[2:51:35.360 --> 2:51:42.240]  perhaps because i had deleted tweets well you didn't and we all know better and jurors should
[2:51:42.240 --> 2:51:46.880]  have been able to hear that but you know that i mentioned earlier the unfair trade practice act
[2:51:46.880 --> 2:51:51.280]  this is the part that keeps me up awake at night most states have consumer protection acts and
[2:51:51.280 --> 2:51:56.080]  that protects you against unscrupulous business deals somebody can't sell you a lemon and tell
[2:51:56.080 --> 2:52:01.200]  you it's a cure for cancer they can't make false claims about ad products their advertising
[2:52:01.200 --> 2:52:06.240]  that's what the unfair trade practices acts address i've never seen it used in this instance
[2:52:06.240 --> 2:52:12.320]  where they didn't like the content of alex's speech and because he supported his speech
[2:52:12.320 --> 2:52:16.720]  with the sale of products the legitimacy of which none have been no one questioned
[2:52:16.720 --> 2:52:21.120]  because they didn't like that they persuaded the judge to let this go to the jury on an unfair
[2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:26.720]  trade practice damage claim i never saw such a thing and you know i i think that's another claim
[2:52:26.720 --> 2:52:32.560]  that has excellent chances of being taken down on appeal if it is everybody who relies on advertising
[2:52:32.560 --> 2:52:38.160]  of any sort is going to and and and and says something that someone disagrees with is going
[2:52:38.160 --> 2:52:43.920]  to be liable for an unfair trade practice claim it's just madness and i think it's it's a sort of
[2:52:43.920 --> 2:52:48.960]  peasy peasy hysteria run amok you know did did alex say things about sandy hook that
[2:52:48.960 --> 2:52:55.200]  would turned out to be wrong and that uh yes um did did he intentionally lie i didn't see it but
[2:52:55.200 --> 2:52:59.760]  yet they were able to tell the jury over and over and over again that because of the default
[2:52:59.760 --> 2:53:05.200]  liability had been established and alex was a liar and nor isn't the biggest issue here is
[2:53:05.200 --> 2:53:10.000]  the media says i'm done it's over don't don't support him for us he's going off the air if
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:14.240]  people just support us we're going to appeal beyond for years even in this incarnation they
[2:53:14.240 --> 2:53:21.600]  can't stop us that's the big lie they're scared of us having an appeal don't let the british
[2:53:21.600 --> 2:53:26.640]  don't let the british tell you you can't drink tea you know i mean the fact of the matter
[2:53:26.640 --> 2:53:32.000]  is as long as we the people can express ourselves find one another and and and arrive at truth as
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:37.040]  we understand it by our own life as best as we can there's freedom but when you're told what to
[2:53:37.040 --> 2:53:42.240]  think how to think it when you can think it um that that's tyrannical control and that's consistent
[2:53:42.240 --> 2:53:46.800]  with big tech that's consistent with the world run by ai it's consistent with everything that that
[2:53:46.800 --> 2:53:51.280]  you've talked about in your book on the great reset that's right it's a power structure losing
[2:53:51.280 --> 2:53:56.400]  control desperate to bully us into submission picking out a few leaders to demonize us hoping
[2:53:56.400 --> 2:54:00.560]  everybody loses faith and they break our will they're not norm patis thank you so much great

[3:00:18.480 --> 3:00:24.320]  one thing that's slipped by this summer early fall was um i guess there's a class action lawsuit

[3:00:31.120 --> 3:00:36.640]  the vexing people have been i saw that say that again there was a study about tylenol lawsuit

[3:12:18.080 --> 3:12:25.600]  he's an interesting character there he has a lot of uh good ideas but hey that alex book again i
[3:12:25.600 --> 3:12:31.040]  i was joking i'm happy to have it it's a it's a great one i just started it came in the mail the
[3:12:31.040 --> 3:12:36.320]  other day so we're actually going to do a global elites lecture series also on alex's book because
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:42.080]  it's such a perfect breakdown of what's going on and alex is so ahead of the times when it comes
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:48.480]  to breaking down this whole new world order plan you know for what over 20 years so amazing
[3:12:49.120 --> 3:12:53.760]  accuracy there and you know in the light of what's happened last couple days all of the
[3:12:53.760 --> 3:13:01.040]  correct things that are said all the accuracy the 90 95 accuracy there is overlooked and now
[3:13:01.040 --> 3:13:06.320]  everything is wrong because you you know you're at the center of this big you know media circus
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:13.920]  right which is again a lot of psyops because what about the 95 accuracy on everything else right
[3:13:14.560 --> 3:13:20.160]  and you know a lot of this the books that alex has mentioned over the years are the books that
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:24.720]  i heard him talk about that i just started reading on my own to really understand and get an idea of
[3:13:24.720 --> 3:13:29.760]  what's going on in the world and that's what i do is break down these books as well from the from
[3:13:29.760 --> 3:13:36.320]  the elite from these writers and the next book that we've been lecturing through is an analysis
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:43.040]  from a historian who was just documenting all the stuff that professor quigley professor antony satan
[3:13:43.840 --> 3:13:47.520]  and a lot of these writers were putting into the books brzezinski as well in fact did you know
[3:13:47.520 --> 3:13:54.400]  that brzezinski in between two ages actually cites professor anthony satan on how the west built up
[3:13:55.360 --> 3:14:00.880]  the soviets absolutely there's a there's a footnote where where brzezinski goes into citing and saying
[3:14:00.880 --> 3:14:06.800]  basically vindicating this analysis this thesis that the fabians were the were the real movers
[3:14:06.800 --> 3:14:12.000]  and shakers behind the third way movement so what we're going to talk about today what we're
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:17.920]  going to lecture through is this key l e have to understand which is the alliance between
[3:14:18.560 --> 3:14:25.680]  fabian socialism and big capitalism big monopoly capital which is something i've talked about a
[3:14:25.680 --> 3:14:31.920]  lot on the fourth hour here but this element this is so crucial to understanding how this is being
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:36.880]  rolled out in terms of the great reset this is a plan that goes back over a hundred years but i'm
[3:14:36.880 --> 3:14:41.840]  going to show you i'm going to blow you away with how a lot of the stuff that we thought was new in
[3:14:41.840 --> 3:14:47.280]  terms of the last few years or stuff that we thought was new in the the controlled 60s counter
[3:14:47.280 --> 3:14:53.200]  culture movement that was actually pioneered not even by the frankfort school marxist or the
[3:14:53.200 --> 3:15:01.040]  cultural marxist this is actually pioneered way before that in the 1890s by the fabian socialist
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:07.360]  and that's why the elite especially the british imperial elite they saw such a power such a tool
[3:15:07.920 --> 3:15:14.560]  through fabian socialism that they wed themselves to it and adopted this slow kill permeation
[3:15:14.560 --> 3:15:19.520]  strategy which is how they've been so effective and how they have gotten to where they are in the
[3:15:19.520 --> 3:15:24.160]  last hundred plus years of the new world order so we're going to we're going to go deep into the
[3:15:24.160 --> 3:15:29.120]  origins in the history of not just the classical marxist stuff a lot of people know about the
[3:15:29.120 --> 3:15:33.280]  history of carl marx and all that and that's not really what we're facing in terms of hardcore
[3:15:33.280 --> 3:15:39.840]  strict marxism what we're facing is fabian socialism which is allied with monopoly capital and once we
[3:15:39.840 --> 3:15:45.040]  understand that then we understand what's going on with the fortune 100 the fortune 500 right the
[3:15:45.040 --> 3:15:49.200]  cashless society that they want to bring in which the head of the bis just said the other day we're
[3:15:49.200 --> 3:15:54.000]  going to track everything we're going to we'll be able to halt every cash payment don't go anywhere
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:16:00.800]  this is the oxygen show this is the oxygen show i have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a
[3:16:00.800 --> 3:16:07.520]  globalist i have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics not just in america but the
[3:16:07.520 --> 3:16:14.080]  world we are engaging the globalist at point blank range in the information war but i don't
[3:16:14.080 --> 3:16:19.680]  deserve the credit yes i've persevered but the listeners and viewers who support them for wars
[3:16:19.680 --> 3:16:25.360]  for the real reason we've had this success we're having now the greatest victories in the fight
[3:16:25.360 --> 3:16:32.640]  against the new order we've ever had we are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's
[3:16:32.640 --> 3:16:37.760]  why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:43.840]  continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them i bless you all i salute you

[3:17:10.320 --> 3:17:16.240]  think about how info wars is cited by joe rogan and tucker carlson and ball sonaro and other foreign
[3:17:16.240 --> 3:17:24.720]  leaders like nigel forage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat
[3:17:24.720 --> 3:17:31.840]  the new world order the only reason humanity's still in the fight today is because the viewers
[3:17:31.840 --> 3:17:38.720]  and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported the show i don't take the credit i
[3:17:38.720 --> 3:17:43.680]  give you the credit the credit and now info wars is facing its darkest hours it isn't going to give

[3:20:15.600 --> 3:20:21.120]  welcome back to the house judge i'm your guest host j dire we are discussing the history of
[3:20:21.120 --> 3:20:26.640]  fabian socialism and fabian socialism is so key to understanding where we are today because it's
[3:20:26.640 --> 3:20:32.320]  more or less the overall ideology that is being pushed everywhere you might say well aren't we
[3:20:32.320 --> 3:20:38.160]  controlled by a big you know fortune 100 fortune 500 there they're not no actually they are socialists
[3:20:38.160 --> 3:20:41.600]  now a lot of the people in those groups the ceo's they don't know anything they don't
[3:20:41.600 --> 3:20:50.480]  know fabianism but what we want to get into is the history of this ideology as a tool for money
[3:20:50.480 --> 3:20:56.400]  to leads to push a consolidation and centralization program that's the key here that's why it's so
[3:20:56.400 --> 3:21:02.240]  useful and so effective and we have to go back to as we said marx himself who came up with this
[3:21:02.240 --> 3:21:07.840]  idea to actually create a secret society marx knew that if he could have a little intercore
[3:21:07.840 --> 3:21:12.880]  group and operate in a covert way he would be much more effective than if he just tried to be
[3:21:12.880 --> 3:21:17.520]  public and overt and so he came up with what he called the communist league which is his own
[3:21:17.520 --> 3:21:22.320]  little kind of intercourse secret society and he was fairly successful because he ended up getting
[3:21:22.320 --> 3:21:28.480]  a lot of liberal democratic wealthy money to defend him and you might think well but didn't
[3:21:28.480 --> 3:21:35.600]  marxism eventually become against liberal democracy yeah but that's when it was uh later on achieving
[3:21:35.600 --> 3:21:40.320]  power and prominence but when it was early on it needed money right none of these things work
[3:21:40.320 --> 3:21:45.360]  without funding without money and so marx was perceptive enough to understand that he could
[3:21:45.360 --> 3:21:51.040]  probably get more done by having a secret society that initially out allied itself with liberal
[3:21:51.040 --> 3:21:57.440]  publications and liberal financiers and liberal corporate interests and so we get at that time
[3:21:58.240 --> 3:22:04.400]  after marx there is a famous figure named george bernard shaw the famous playwright who decides
[3:22:04.400 --> 3:22:09.280]  that not everything that marx said was right and it need to be modified so shaw comes up with this
[3:22:09.280 --> 3:22:15.600]  idea we touched on this a little bit last time i hosted uh that we need reformed marxism because
[3:22:15.600 --> 3:22:21.440]  marx wasn't right that the the proletariat the workers they didn't rise up to overthrow the
[3:22:21.440 --> 3:22:27.040]  capitalist pigs no in fact uh all they cared about was you know going to getting their lunch break and
[3:22:27.040 --> 3:22:32.240]  you know getting a better a better paycheck and so george bernard shaw said what we actually need
[3:22:32.240 --> 3:22:40.320]  to do is take a slow uh motion turtle approach right a wolves and sheep wolf and sheep's clothing
[3:22:40.320 --> 3:22:46.720]  approach to how we transform the entirety of society and we could do that through cultural
[3:22:46.720 --> 3:22:54.640]  warfare over many decades much more effectively shaw said than if we just outright tried to have a
[3:22:54.640 --> 3:22:59.440]  quote workers revolt right so this was a was a terrible idea on the part of marx totally divorced
[3:22:59.440 --> 3:23:04.400]  from reality but unfortunately george bernard shaw was much more perceptive and he caught the
[3:23:04.400 --> 3:23:10.320]  attention of a lot of very wealthy elite people in fact not only did he attract the attention of
[3:23:10.320 --> 3:23:18.320]  lord millner and the uh uh the the the roads uh circles of the diamond magnets and whatnot he
[3:23:18.320 --> 3:23:26.000]  actually attracted the attention of uh rockefeller carnage and ford so it turns out that the corporate
[3:23:26.000 --> 3:23:33.040]  monopoly magnets had a great interest in this because they read shaw's writings and said hey
[3:23:33.600 --> 3:23:39.680]  this is actually a much better way to infiltrate transform socially engineer
[3:23:40.560 --> 3:23:46.880]  collectivize and nationalize all of the wealth and then transfer it off to private entities
[3:23:47.440 --> 3:23:53.120]  and so they realized early on that this was a great scam model and the amazing thing is that
[3:23:53.120 --> 3:23:58.800]  according to a historian uh yoan rats you in his book the millner fabian conspiracy which is a
[3:23:59.440 --> 3:24:05.600]  copiously documented five four five hundred footnotes in this 500 page book um that the
[3:24:05.600 --> 3:24:12.560]  british east india company model became the model for the uh roads uh rauchel millner
[3:24:13.520 --> 3:24:20.640]  diamond model which was the south africa company right that was a uh chartered company
[3:24:20.640 --> 3:24:27.040]  that was a monopoly corporate situation so monopoly corporate interest and the structure
[3:24:27.040 --> 3:24:33.200]  the charter that they have actually becomes the model for the fabian society the fabian society
[3:24:33.200 --> 3:24:38.720]  this socialist society right literally said in their early meetings we're going to model our
[3:24:38.720 --> 3:24:47.040]  structured society our secret society the same way that the roads millner uh a store secret
[3:24:47.040 --> 3:24:51.680]  society was modeled and that's what quigley covers in his book angle american establishment
[3:24:51.680 --> 3:24:55.760]  so it's the same secret society just using a different structure different model and different
[3:24:55.760 --> 3:25:03.040]  fronts right keep that in mind and it is explicitly a secret society in fact it was
[3:25:03.040 --> 3:25:08.720]  cecil roads himself the diamond magnate who said i'm going to construct this the roads trust
[3:25:08.720 --> 3:25:15.760]  around a secret society model now he himself was involved in other secret societies in a
[3:25:15.760 --> 3:25:20.880]  cold group so um whatever we want to think of all these different esoteric philosophies the
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:27.120]  point is that it's a society it's an inner party an inner party elite that operates as a shadow
[3:25:27.120 --> 3:25:31.360]  government so this is the real shadow government this is the origins of the real shadow government
[3:25:31.360 --> 3:25:36.320]  and then the fabians modeled on this and by the way including some of the same people like lord
[3:25:36.320 --> 3:25:43.920]  millner who was a fabian they said let's just utilize this structure to have an inner party elite
[3:25:43.920 --> 3:25:51.120]  inner party that's from them and an outer party of a bunch of dum-dums idealistic dupes who actually
[3:25:51.120 --> 3:25:57.680]  think that this is to fix things it's not to fix things it's a transformed society and by the way
[3:25:57.680 --> 3:26:01.680]  there's also interesting quotes uh from orzbranagh shawl where he seemed to actually have an affinity
[3:26:01.680 --> 3:26:05.440]  for satanism as well so again when we talk about some of these people being uh you know
[3:26:05.440 --> 3:26:09.440]  luciferians and satanists and so forth there's actually truth to that right some of them were
[3:26:09.440 --> 3:26:13.440]  now they had all kinds of different philosophies but this is a key point here because you've
[3:26:13.440 --> 3:26:18.480]  remember we did a fourth hour on alex jones uh a couple months ago where we talked about the
[3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:24.640]  occult spies of the new world order you remember that it's a it's a great fourth hour you didn't
[3:26:24.640 --> 3:26:29.840]  uh see it go look it up it's on bandai video uh the occult spies of the new world why why was
[3:26:29.840 --> 3:26:40.160]  how does that relate to this well annie basant madame blavatsky alice bailey they were uh fabians
[3:26:40.160 --> 3:26:46.160]  did you know that and they saw that theosophy could be wedded to fabian socialism and that
[3:26:46.160 --> 3:26:52.800]  this could according to quote blavatsky bring in the new age so not only were they connected to
[3:26:52.800 --> 3:26:58.080]  the uh fabians uh the george renard shaw in these circles through accepting fabian socialism
[3:26:58.080 --> 3:27:03.680]  they were also connected to the real power behind the british empire right the milliners the astros
[3:27:03.680 --> 3:27:09.440]  the clivedin said these people this is the real structure and power of the british empire that's
[3:27:09.440 --> 3:27:18.320]  the talk i did exactly and in the 1890s they were already cooking up this plot for global government
[3:27:19.680 --> 3:27:25.280]  the one they were living through today same same plot and how do we know that well for one
[3:27:25.920 --> 3:27:31.600]  these three uh which women and they were actually witchy women but they were also probably uh spies
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:37.600]  as well that's a good uh a bit of evidence to suggest that for example um madame blavatsky was
[3:27:37.600 --> 3:27:45.760]  a close associate of soviet bolshevik spy nicolas roerich and nicolas roerich is the spy slash new
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:52.800]  age or meditative guru guy again a pioneer figure for the new age movement in the 60s who was working
[3:27:52.800 --> 3:27:58.000]  with the bolsheviks as an espionage agent and who was tied to henry wallace he was the mentor to
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:05.280]  henry wallace former vp in secretary of agriculture under fdr and roerich is the one who told wallace
[3:28:05.280 --> 3:28:13.040]  and fdr to put the all seeing eye on the dollar bill no joke so you understand this is the real
[3:28:13.920 --> 3:28:17.920]  that you want to know who's all seeing eye it's these people it's the fabian society the fabian
[3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:26.560]  socialist working for these zillionaires there's madame blavatsky uh hideous witch woman and of
[3:28:26.560 --> 3:28:32.000]  course madame blavatsky also had an influence on the national socialists okay so this is not divorced
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:36.800]  from the right theosophy had an influence on national socialism as well so keep in mind that
[3:28:36.800 --> 3:28:42.080]  all these socialist movements really have their locus in their center in these fabians who are
[3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:48.720]  working for the outer party fabian ideologues working for this inner party of the real elite
[3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:54.560]  running the british empire lord balfour lord millner all of these people lord curtis don't go
[3:28:54.560 --> 3:28:59.440]  anywhere this is the outlook look around you everything i predicted from the globlestone

[3:33:17.280 --> 3:33:21.280]  welcome back to the oxygen show on your guest host j dire j's analysis we were discussing
[3:33:21.280 --> 3:33:27.120]  the history of the new age movement and its origins in these spies and espionage figures
[3:33:27.120 --> 3:33:32.080]  tied to the fabian socialist and one thing i wanted to mention was that i think one of the
[3:33:32.080 --> 3:33:39.280]  key reasons why the fabians had such a direct connect with these new ages is that they didn't
[3:33:39.280 --> 3:33:45.360]  really necessarily always believe all this stuff but the they understood that religion
[3:33:45.360 --> 3:33:51.760]  being co-opted would be a perfect means of promoting the new world order right promoting a
[3:33:51.760 --> 3:33:56.240]  global governance in other words a global governance needs means by which it can unite the
[3:33:56.240 --> 3:34:02.080]  population of the world around singular ideas and one of those single ideas would be a new age
[3:34:02.080 --> 3:34:07.440]  movement a kind of all religions are equal you know syncretism kind of thing and that's exactly
[3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:14.080]  what people like uh basant uh blavatsky and bailey were all pushing and that's why they were so useful
[3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:20.240]  to uh both the fabian socialist and one of their key institutions that they helped set up the fabians
[3:34:20.240 --> 3:34:25.760]  i'm saying the united nations so both the league of nations and the united nations were set up by
[3:34:25.760 --> 3:34:30.800]  this power structure in these people remember this is not disputed this is a historical fact
[3:34:31.520 --> 3:34:38.080]  dr carol quickley's magnum opus 1200 1300 page tragedy and hope is a history of this group of
[3:34:38.080 --> 3:34:44.240]  people so what i'm telling you today this this is the real secret society that is really running the
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:51.760]  show today and really behind both the league of nations the united nations behind the cold war
[3:34:51.760 --> 3:34:59.520]  and behind the great reset exact same group exact same ideology wedded to eugenics wedded to
[3:34:59.520 --> 3:35:06.400]  malthusianism in fact all the fabian socialists who were of any note early on immediately adopted
[3:35:06.400 --> 3:35:11.440]  eugenics they were malthusians the difference being is that you had this sort of fake left
[3:35:11.440 --> 3:35:15.600]  right dialectic amongst some some of the british elite right a hundred years ago so there was a
[3:35:15.600 --> 3:35:21.520]  kind of a fake right wing and there was this fabian socialist fake left wing but they were
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:28.720]  both working for this inner group again exemplified in figures like cesil roads and figures like
[3:35:28.720 --> 3:35:37.120]  uh lord millner and they were allied with their colleagues on the eastern seaboard of america
[3:35:37.840 --> 3:35:46.720]  the princeton harvard yale elite so these are all part of one superstructure one inner core
[3:35:46.720 --> 3:35:53.280]  that runs the whole atlanticist power block every time i talk about this people would talk about
[3:35:53.280 --> 3:36:00.480]  atlantis let's talk about atlantis the atlanticist all right geopolitics power block the western
[3:36:00.480 --> 3:36:09.520]  power block these are the people that run it and they still do and they were able to eventually
[3:36:09.520 --> 3:36:16.000]  bring the united states which is a non-interventionist power back under the sway of these royal
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:25.600]  society groups through the machinations of people like uh wild bill donovan and he was working at
[3:36:25.600 --> 3:36:29.200]  the behest of these british intelligence figures working for these figures right and even even
[3:36:29.200 --> 3:36:34.640]  going back earlier than that with uh colonel edwin mandel house sort of co-opting and working as an
[3:36:34.640 --> 3:36:39.600]  agent for these elite people to bring woodrow wilson and the federal reserve and all of that into
[3:36:39.600 --> 3:36:45.120]  into play right so this the same people pushing the federal reserve act pushing all of the stuff
[3:36:45.120 --> 3:36:50.160]  that woodrow wilson pushes including the support for the bolsheviks all that that was all done by
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:56.800]  these people it's the it's the same power structure and i'm just trying to stress that it's not
[3:36:56.800 --> 3:37:03.360]  accidental that they pushed the global religion movement of the new age movement 60 years before
[3:37:03.360 --> 3:37:09.600]  the 60s counterculture new age movement and guess what else they pushed 60 70 years before the 1960s
[3:37:09.600 --> 3:37:18.880]  socialization through degenerate art and toxic culture they were pushing amazingly weird creepy
[3:37:18.880 --> 3:37:28.400]  blasphemous stuff in the 1890s including bestiality as artwork because they knew that if you destroyed
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:35.520]  the culture through the arts then what that does it debases the people and it allows these wealthy
[3:37:35.520 --> 3:37:41.040]  people to come in and restructure society i don't know i don't just mean rich people i'm talking about
[3:37:42.080 --> 3:37:45.920]  in unimaginably wealthy people right we're talking about the wealthiest
[3:37:45.920 --> 3:37:52.480]  point 001 on the planet these people that's who we're talking about here the fabians that realized
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:38:00.400]  early on in the 1890s that the key to restructuring and and reorganizing all of society would be through
[3:38:00.400 --> 3:38:06.880]  culture war so they were way ahead of anybody in terms of the conservatives nowadays and talk
[3:38:06.880 --> 3:38:13.760]  about culture war i mean these people were doing the culture war 120 years ago right and they realized
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:22.320]  that degenerate gross nasty disgusting art would debase the culture and it was fabian socialists
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:28.000]  that were pioneering this again 50 60 years before even any of the theodoro dorno or any of the
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:33.760]  cultural marxists had any such an idea so they were way ahead of their time and this is precisely
[3:38:33.760 --> 3:38:39.600]  why one of their famous acolytes right acolytes i should say that you've heard me talk about for
[3:38:39.600 --> 3:38:46.880]  a long time hd wells right what did he push he pushed the new age movement 50 60 years before
[3:38:46.880 --> 3:38:52.000]  there was a new age movement he wrote a book called god the invisible king wherein he talks about
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:56.960]  worshiping lucifer and he says that lucifer is this enlightened deity not a demon but this
[3:38:56.960 --> 3:39:02.080]  enlightened deity that will bring the new age and he says i'm not an atheist i'm not against
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:08.480]  god it just needs to be a god of all the religions man and it wasn't just him in fact the uh
[3:39:08.480 --> 3:39:14.400]  theosophists andy basant uh blavatsky and others they actually made uh intimate connections with
[3:39:14.400 --> 3:39:21.280]  other way ahead of their time new agers like gergif gi gergif was a crucial figure for
[3:39:21.280 --> 3:39:25.120]  preparing the way for the new age movement in the 1960s the counterculture and so forth
[3:39:25.120 --> 3:39:31.280]  and it was all because all these people were connected to this inner core group of the fabian
[3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:38.080]  socialists they also set up a bunch of academic societies and front groups right long time ago
[3:39:38.080 --> 3:39:44.000]  they set up the coefficients club the rainbow club which are all these sort of pseudo intellectual
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:49.840]  reading groups right and then they started setting up uh things at universities they set up all kinds
[3:39:49.840 --> 3:39:56.800]  of um reading societies and inner uh secret groups at universities all the while pushing
[3:39:57.360 --> 3:40:04.720]  these socialist ideas while in the inner party inner group being 100 self-conscious and self
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:12.640]  recognizing that they're allied with and funded by zillionaires exactly exactly this is the key if
[3:40:12.640 --> 3:40:16.960]  you understand this you'll understand all of it and get this this is the great irony uh according
[3:40:16.960 --> 3:40:22.720]  to ratzio the historian he says that in 1897 the fabians had announced that just like the
[3:40:22.720 --> 3:40:28.400]  chartered company in africa talking about the uh ceaseless roach charter that's a corporate
[3:40:28.400 --> 3:40:35.040]  charter corporatism okay the fabian society will capture and control all of the british natives
[3:40:36.240 --> 3:40:42.640]  for its profit and for their own good the chartered company was the millner the millner group
[3:40:42.640 --> 3:40:49.120]  founded by ceaseless roach which was known as the british south africa company chartered in 1889
[3:40:49.120 --> 3:40:56.640]  so the model for corporate world government is british east india company dutch east india
[3:40:56.640 --> 3:41:02.000]  company british south africa company all the same things corporatism that then becomes the model
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:09.600]  for the fabian socialist to push nationalization socialization of everything under the guise of
[3:41:09.600 --> 3:41:14.160]  helping you everybody falls for all the dupes fall for this right it's not going to help you
[3:41:14.800 --> 3:41:19.840]  it's a scam it's a plot and these inner party people know that that's the thing and they think
[3:41:19.840 --> 3:41:25.120]  it's funny right ratzio even talks about how the fabians thought it was funny how much subterfuge
[3:41:25.120 --> 3:41:32.640]  cunning deception lie and con artistry that they would engage in to gain power to do what we call
[3:41:32.640 --> 3:41:37.440]  what they called as we talked about a couple shows back the permeation strategy the long
[3:41:37.440 --> 3:41:43.360]  long march through all the institutions and in fact they were so adept at this that a lot of the
[3:41:43.360 --> 3:41:48.880]  labor party people that in the british labor party that went into running for office didn't
[3:41:48.880 --> 3:41:53.440]  even know what the inner party was up to they didn't know that they thought oh we're just
[3:41:53.440 --> 3:42:00.240]  going to help the workers we're the party of the people right and churchell for example churchell
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:08.000]  had in his own government installed numerous open fabian society members so let's not fall into
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:13.760]  thinking oh churchell was a hero in this a churchell uh i don't maybe he didn't know the inner designs
[3:42:13.760 --> 3:42:18.800]  of what they were up to but regardless churchell installed all of these fabian society members
[3:42:18.800 --> 3:42:25.680]  in his cabinet it's kind of amazing so they were already heavily into this and by the 1990s people
[3:42:25.680 --> 3:42:31.840]  like uh milliband people like tony blair they were already openly again promoting all this
[3:42:31.840 --> 3:42:39.280]  british fabian society nonsense and remember the fake right wing is just like in america a fake
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:44.960]  right wing as well right so the brits had their fake right wing but the fabian society the strategy
[3:42:44.960 --> 3:42:49.760]  is so effective and that's how the uk has turned into the socialist government and they're pushing
[3:42:49.760 --> 3:42:54.400]  the exact same thing for the united states and on the whole world universal basic income don't go

[3:47:17.200 --> 3:47:21.760]  welcome back to the oxygen so this is jay diaries now so we're breaking down what is the
[3:47:21.760 --> 3:47:30.880]  essential operating system of the nwo of great reset of clausen company of davos and we have
[3:47:30.880 --> 3:47:37.120]  to understand this to grasp how it is that socialism can be wedded to gigantic big state
[3:47:37.120 --> 3:47:44.240]  capitalism in fact rats you go so far as to say that national capitalism or the socialization
[3:47:44.240 --> 3:47:50.400]  of the entire economy is actually a form of big state capitalism which is identical to
[3:47:50.400 --> 3:47:57.040]  you got it fabian socialism if we understand that then we'll understand exactly why all the
[3:47:57.040 --> 3:48:04.320]  institutes that the fabians helped set up explain the entire process what did they help this what
[3:48:04.320 --> 3:48:08.560]  all did they set up well not only did they help to set up the united nations fabian society was
[3:48:08.560 --> 3:48:14.320]  instrumental in creating the royal economic society and so we had people in the royal society
[3:48:14.320 --> 3:48:20.240]  again who were very fixated on very very fascinated by this idea of fabian socialism and so we
[3:48:20.240 --> 3:48:25.520]  have people like uh or we have institutions like the royal economic society the royal
[3:48:25.520 --> 3:48:29.600]  institute for international affairs chatham house we have the league for institutional
[3:48:29.600 --> 3:48:35.280]  democracy the council and foreign relations in 1921 set up in the us the commonwealth in fact all
[3:48:35.280 --> 3:48:41.280]  the transformation of the british colonies into commonwealths was actually a strategy
[3:48:41.280 --> 3:48:46.960]  pioneered by these fabians john ruskin for example was one it was a famous famous fabian who influenced
[3:48:46.960 --> 3:48:54.640]  all these figures the world bank the imf the world council of churches billderberg group
[3:48:54.640 --> 3:49:00.880]  the aspen institute these are all fabian institutions set up directly by people with
[3:49:00.880 --> 3:49:06.720]  fabian ideology and the list goes on and on on trilateral institute way i can keep going
[3:49:07.440 --> 3:49:12.640]  and part of the reason for that is because both walter lippman at harvard and david
[3:49:12.640 --> 3:49:18.400]  rockefeller fell under heavy fabian socialist influence now everybody probably knows if you've
[3:49:18.400 --> 3:49:25.040]  listened to me for a while that david rockefeller did a thesis a grab thesis under von mesis on
[3:49:25.040 --> 3:49:30.640]  libertarian austrian school economics but that wasn't his only influence in fact david rockefeller
[3:49:30.640 --> 3:49:36.880]  early on when he wrote his college senior thesis was called destitution through fabian eyes and
[3:49:36.880 --> 3:49:43.040]  that was because he was under a guy named laski at harvard who heavily influenced him in terms of
[3:49:43.040 --> 3:49:48.880]  fabian socialism as well so so david rockefeller had both an austrian economic and a fabian socialist
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:54.560]  influence and that's what produces this sort of figure that we have in a big state capitalist
[3:49:54.560 --> 3:49:59.840]  figure like david rockefeller who would go on to talk about how malism was a great social experiment
[3:49:59.840 --> 3:50:05.280]  and a great project who talks glowingly about socialism and many many papers and things that he
[3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:12.240]  wrote over the years and it was no different with ford and with jp morgan they were all influenced
[3:50:12.240 --> 3:50:18.560]  by george bernard shaw and the fabian writers and it wasn't because they were uh uh philanthropists
[3:50:18.560 --> 3:50:24.080]  good-hearted philanthropists it's because they read shaw and they understood that this style of
[3:50:24.080 --> 3:50:33.600]  economic scammery is a great means to concentrate wealth and to transfer it and you can even get
[3:50:33.600 --> 3:50:39.120]  deeper into this in terms of crashing the economies and then buying things up for pennies on the dollar
[3:50:39.120 --> 3:50:44.880]  which is what they're doing presently what happened in 2008 a lot of this stuff is done by design
[3:50:44.880 --> 3:50:48.640]  and that's what the people at these levels have realized another figure you may have heard about
[3:50:48.640 --> 3:50:54.320]  who was very influential in the world bank and imf in today's monetary policy in the west john
[3:50:54.320 --> 3:51:00.800]  manor canes a committed rabid fabian and again so many people think well these people are just
[3:51:00.800 --> 3:51:05.680]  incompetent they're so incompetent they can't they can't do anything they can't run anything
[3:51:06.320 --> 3:51:13.120]  you understand that a lot of the uh political class right they might be incompetent but the
[3:51:13.120 --> 3:51:20.640]  people in this inner party they're not incompetent they know how to run these kinds of strategies
[3:51:20.640 --> 3:51:27.360]  to destroy economies by design and when you understand that so many things actually make
[3:51:27.360 --> 3:51:31.760]  much more sense right especially in terms of what's happening for example in our country
[3:51:32.480 --> 3:51:38.720]  it's not just a bunch of dummies it's not just a bunch of incompetent you know political goofballs
[3:51:39.280 --> 3:51:44.400]  right who are uh just compromised because they're you know cumbers or something like that it's way
[3:51:44.400 --> 3:51:49.840]  more than that it's a strategy it's a technique the fabians learned it a long time ago and that's
[3:51:49.840 --> 3:51:55.200]  why their strategies and their techniques are being used from the 60s on especially the culture war
[3:51:55.200 --> 3:52:04.480]  war subversion was something crucial to fabian strategy and fabian ideology
[3:52:05.840 --> 3:52:12.160]  and so they were able to capture institutions they were able to influence many global figures
[3:52:12.160 --> 3:52:18.960]  including Mahatma Gandhi who joined the fabian society including other members amongst the elites
[3:52:18.960 --> 3:52:27.520]  of the uh of India people in Pakistan for example which is a basically a creation of the British
[3:52:27.520 --> 3:52:33.440]  empire as well they became fabian socialists even figures who according to some intelligence
[3:52:33.440 --> 3:52:37.520]  writers eventually got well this actually makes more sense the thing about the figure of Nelson
[3:52:37.520 --> 3:52:43.200]  Mandela right Nelson Mandela was this fabian socialist who was supposedly right this crusader
[3:52:43.200 --> 3:52:48.240]  for you know the workers and the african rights and so forth but the reality is that according to
[3:52:48.240 --> 3:52:53.120]  uh researcher Stephen Dorrell he was actually recruited into British intelligence a long time ago
[3:52:53.120 --> 3:52:58.000]  and so oh what's going on well it makes perfect sense if you understand the fabian thesis here
[3:52:58.000 --> 3:53:03.600]  right that really the British empire became the fabian empire and a tool for the promotion of
[3:53:03.600 --> 3:53:10.000]  slow motion socialism now the fabians had this strategy that when they had slow motion socialism
[3:53:10.000 --> 3:53:16.560]  in place that they could begin to call for the total nationalism not quote nationalization of
[3:53:16.560 --> 3:53:22.480]  everything and this was a strategy not just for the uk but the fabians were behind the european union
[3:53:23.360 --> 3:53:29.840]  this is where the EU comes from again the EU was not actually dreamt up at Bilderberg it was first
[3:53:29.840 --> 3:53:36.400]  discussed at these higher levels at Bilderberg but the real strategy and the the real mindset behind
[3:53:36.400 --> 3:53:44.720]  the european union was from the fabians again people like Count Calergi people like uh George
[3:53:44.720 --> 3:53:50.480]  Bernard Shaw these people uh uh decades ahead of the early Bilderberg meetings in the 40s and 50s
[3:53:50.480 --> 3:53:56.640]  which first talked about creating a european union they had said we needed a united states of europe
[3:53:56.640 --> 3:54:01.840]  decades prior to the existence of Bilderberg so if you remember uh i did a popular talk for the
[3:54:01.840 --> 3:54:06.960]  fourth hour here i think we got three or four hundred thousand views uh on Bilderberg uh some
[3:54:06.960 --> 3:54:12.000]  months back and i was talking about how Daniel Esslin's Bilderberg but mentions the fact that
[3:54:12.000 --> 3:54:17.200]  the EU was discussed in the 1940s and 50s at the first Bilderberg meetings and that's true
[3:54:17.200 --> 3:54:23.360]  but actually it turns out the royal society had dreamt up this idea decades even prior to that so
[3:54:23.360 --> 3:54:29.600]  it's even earlier and to let you know exactly what we're talking about here when George Orwell
[3:54:29.600 --> 3:54:35.920]  wrote 1984 and he wrote about the inner party elite who is completely above the law and really
[3:54:35.920 --> 3:54:41.920]  knows what's going on and is self-conscious of all this deception and wickedness that that inner
[3:54:41.920 --> 3:54:49.680]  party elite is this that's who he's talking about ing sock in 1984 is english socialism
[3:54:49.680 --> 3:54:55.440]  he's talking about these people the fabians that's who he's talking about and in fact
[3:54:55.440 --> 3:55:01.200]  millner's fabian society will go on to influence and help create not just league of nations united
[3:55:01.200 --> 3:55:08.320]  nations the EU but according to rats you through a high degree of psyops they would also be
[3:55:08.320 --> 3:55:15.360]  instrumental in influencing and helping to create the tavastok institute and rats you and his great
[3:55:15.360 --> 3:55:22.000]  book is a perceptive enough to realize that ultimately the fabian approach is an anti-human
[3:55:22.000 --> 3:55:28.160]  conspiracy they have all of the same eugenics and malphusian ideology of any of the other
[3:55:28.160 --> 3:55:33.280]  socialist systems including national socialism but it's not identical national socialism because
[3:55:33.280 --> 3:55:39.440]  it's international socialism so it's just a modified form of this and they were instrumental
[3:55:39.440 --> 3:55:45.360]  including uh following the advice of hd wells to transform the british colonies into a democratic
[3:55:45.360 --> 3:55:53.280]  commonwealth so it's the same inner party group but they just use a cloak of democracy and that
[3:55:53.280 --> 3:55:56.480]  right there tells you pretty much everything you need to know about how the world is run today all
[3:55:56.480 --> 3:56:01.600]  the calls for democracy democracy democracy so we need to transform these other countries in
[3:56:01.600 --> 3:56:07.280]  terms of our foreign policy into democracies it's not for america it's not for americanism it's not
[3:56:07.280 --> 3:56:13.680]  it's for the inner group that are the successor to this inner group that's it and how is it modeled
[3:56:13.680 --> 3:56:19.360]  well according to george bernard shaw and according to what quickly says this inner secret society is
[3:56:19.360 --> 3:56:25.520]  modeled on the jesuits not run by jesuits jesuits are allied to a lot of these western intelligence
[3:56:25.520 --> 3:56:30.560]  operations and are kind of a tool of a lot of these people it's not run by jesuits okay it's
[3:56:30.560 --> 3:56:38.080]  people above jesuits but the society itself of the inner party is modeled on ignatious
[3:56:38.080 --> 3:56:43.120]  legal structure of the jesuits and that's something that we've seen in quickly it also comes up again
[3:56:43.120 --> 3:56:49.120]  explicitly in the writings of george bernard shaw so uh this is the plan there's not a million
[3:56:49.120 --> 3:56:56.240]  different plans there's one global nwo plan it was planned back long ago it has elements of
[3:56:56.240 --> 3:57:02.160]  marxist theory but it modifies it to become reform marxism and the strategy of george bernard shaw
[3:57:02.160 --> 3:57:10.400]  millner ruskin roads uh bolvatsky basant all of those goofy religious figures are actually despised
[3:57:11.120 --> 3:57:15.760]  and it's the same plan that we're seeing pushed nowadays but the same transhumanists
[3:57:15.760 --> 3:57:21.520]  huxley julian huxley coins the term transhumanist he's one of these people and it's exactly what
[3:57:21.520 --> 3:57:30.800]  claustin everybody today is pushing it's the same plan rolled out clear as day this is it this is the
[3:57:30.800 --> 3:57:37.040]  plan so if you understand that you understand the whole thing and you understand the real meaning
[3:57:37.040 --> 3:57:42.560]  of 1984 for more well by the way this is jdavj's analysis you can go to my website and get my books
