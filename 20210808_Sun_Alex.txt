[00:00.000 --> 00:23.000]  I'm actually quite proud of the medical services from Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia,
[00:23.000 --> 00:31.000]  New Zealand, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia. The vast majority of the people
[00:31.000 --> 00:37.000]  speaking up who are doctors and scientists and epidemiologists and nurses are saying the vaccines
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  don't work and are killing most people and the statistics show that. But I was sitting here just
[00:42.000 --> 00:50.000]  minutes ago as I was writing the headline to post for today's show and I was looking at one of
[00:50.000 --> 00:57.000]  the largest newspapers in Germany, the largest regional newspaper over three German states with
[00:57.000 --> 01:08.000]  their headline that the largest medical union in Germany, the pathologist union, the coroner union,
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  the guys that, the gals that know what kills people that say that say that 30 to 40% of the
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.000]  dead people that they're seeing have been killed by the vaccine and that it's eating their bodies,
[01:21.000 --> 01:27.000]  which all the studies show it would do, which we predicted it would, which it did. And then guess
[01:27.000 --> 01:48.000]  who came out, guess who came out and said don't listen to them in Germany, the Paul R. Erlich
[01:48.000 --> 01:58.000]  institution. Do you know who Paul R. Erlich is? And his wife Annie H. Erlich and John P. Holder
[01:58.000 --> 02:04.000]  and the White House science are for Obama. Well, in 1974, 47 years ago, the year I was born,
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  they wrote this book for depopulation world government and how to use fluoride and vaccines
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  to attack us. It's all in here. I've shown you this book probably 500 times here on air in the last
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  20 years. It's right on my desk. It's a battle plan for everything. Rockefeller Foundation
[02:20.000 --> 02:31.000]  adopted it as global law in 1992. They updated it. Erlich's institution came out to try to debunk
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  the pathology union, which is already written letters. It turns out four months ago saying
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  we're seeing a bunch of dead, whatever this is is growing crystals and people eating them alive.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  I mean, they're cutting these folks open. The vast minority, by the way, ever get cut open.
[02:45.000 --> 02:54.000]  Families ask for it. It happens. 30 to 40% of the dead in Germany in just one spot check
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  by the top pathologist. He's like the spokesperson. He's been conducting a review in one German
[03:01.000 --> 03:12.000]  city alone. He got the same numbers. And it just piles on top of itself. And then Joe Rogan
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  comes out in a Thursday podcast that went supernova and got tens of millions of views
[03:17.000 --> 03:24.000]  on Friday. God bless him. I called him up and congratulated him. And all he said was he
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  showed studies that show that the vaccine is sloughing and causing variants. And now they're
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  freaking out everywhere saying take him off air. I've got a stack of mainline science and
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  even the Associated Press admitting what he said is true. That's coming up. But just imagine,
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  you say where are the scientists? Wouldn't they speak up? They all speak up and they get
[03:41.000 --> 03:48.000]  silenced or the head? Three scientists came up with the world government plan that we're now
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  under. One of them is Paul Erlich and his organization, his society that wants deep
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  population is saying don't worry about all those dead people. Maybe like somebody said
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  there's been Nazi murders in Germany and they went, well Hitler says it's not happening.
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  I'm going to cover that next hour. Next hour. I'm going to read the whole damn thing to
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.000]  you and show you the quotes and all the rest of it. Get ready and start your engines though
[04:18.000 --> 04:25.000]  because we got a lot more. When I saw what was in the bill Friday evening, I had promised
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  my wife and family I was not going to come to work on Saturday. I'd even given the Saturday
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  crew the day off. That didn't happen, did it? No, we put out a four hour report. When
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  I saw this on Friday, I had to come in. I mean, you couldn't, I have responsibility.
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  I mean, I'm a necessary to murder and total tyranny if I don't do this. Seriously. People
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  got to start thinking like that. Like you don't fight this. You're an accomplice. Well,
[04:49.000 --> 04:58.000]  I came in and the crew came in and wait till I cover this in 60 seconds. Stay with us.
[04:58.000 --> 05:02.000]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now if you haven't
[05:02.000 --> 05:07.000]  tried turbo force, you need to try it. I've tried turbo force with everything. Sometimes,
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  thing. I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, turbo force is my favorite
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.000]  and all the info wars products are down to taking control of your life, take control of
[05:19.000 --> 05:25.000]  your health, not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the morning
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  today. You know, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier,
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  over and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.000]  way? There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  of my health and that's why you need to go to info wars.com, take control of your health
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  right now and support the resistance. Don't buy into the group. Think don't drink the
[05:55.000 --> 06:10.000]  Kool-Aid, drink the turbo force. Kool-Aid is bad and the turbo force is good.
[06:25.000 --> 06:35.000]  Hold on, my friends. Evil will fail. It always creeps around in the shadows and slowly builds
[06:35.000 --> 06:41.000]  its power. Then it explodes on humanity for only a season. Then it rallies the faithful.
[06:41.000 --> 06:48.000]  There is a great clash and evil is crushed and destroyed yet again. But then its fragments
[06:48.000 --> 06:55.000]  always hide to grow like poison prions that rise against us once again until the great
[06:55.000 --> 07:00.000]  white throne judgment when the universe is rolled up like a scroll and Satan and his
[07:00.000 --> 07:06.000]  minions in prison for eternity. Then we will live in peace as one with God.
[07:06.000 --> 07:14.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, August 8th. The year is 2021. I am your host Alex Jones
[07:14.000 --> 07:21.000]  and there is no other way to start the broadcast than just to say it up front. Every day gets
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  more intense. Every day gets more insane as we go towards this evil singularity and I
[07:25.000 --> 07:31.000]  don't mean that as a total type of singularity where everything becomes instant and everything
[07:31.000 --> 07:37.000]  is connected and that's Satan's false singularity of God's coming singularity. But I mean a
[07:37.000 --> 07:43.000]  singularity of evil where evil has taken completely over and is operating on all cylinders
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.000]  assaulting and attacking everything in creation and trying to overturn logic and just common
[07:49.000 --> 07:56.000]  sense because that is in odds with its carcinogenic spirit and program. So let me tell you what's
[07:56.000 --> 08:05.000]  coming up tonight on this live Sunday transmission. First off, the largest German pathology union
[08:05.000 --> 08:13.000]  that's coroners and people that study disease. It's a wide-ranging, largest field in doctors.
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  They have come out and said months ago the vaccines aren't vaccines that are killing people.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  It's growing crystals in their bodies and blood clots. You need to stop it right now.
[08:23.000 --> 08:30.000]  Now the head spokesman who is running a program studying dead bodies of people has said 30 to 40%
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  of the deaths that he's seeing and being reported around the country. This is one of the largest
[08:35.000 --> 08:42.000]  papers in Germany reporting this has been caused by the vaccine. Just like you have national reports
[08:42.000 --> 08:54.000]  of 95 to 99% Israel it's 95 and Australia it's 99 and in other countries it's 90% or so.
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.000]  Of the vaccinated are the ones dying and Australia is only at 27%. It's like well everybody's
[09:01.000 --> 09:08.000]  vaccinated so it's the variant doing it. No, no, no, no. You got 23% of Australia as of this morning
[09:08.000 --> 09:16.000]  they say has been injected and you got 99.9%. There's one person in the Australian National
[09:16.000 --> 09:23.000]  News reporting in a hospital that's tested positive for COVID that hadn't been shot up.
[09:23.000 --> 09:32.000]  And what are the COVID symptoms? It's blood clots. So it's here and what did the scientists say?
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  Over a year ago, top scientists they looked at and they said this is going to cause blood clots.
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  They said we've tried to make vaccines for common cold. You copy the protein shell to stop it.
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.000]  You can't stop the RNA. It's too wide. You can only target the shell, the spike protein.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  You do that. It's all over the damn body. You can't do that. Kills all the animals in the studies.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  It's like you can't shoot yourself in the head with a shotgun and not die.
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  You can't stab yourself in the eye with an ice pick and not lose your eyeball.
[09:59.000 --> 10:07.000]  You can't drink Drano and not die. That's what's crazy is this isn't rocket science.
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  And they on purpose got the world to agree to this so that now the lawyers and the hospitals
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  and the doctors are all signed on and instead of admitting they're wrong like Trump got behind this
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.000]  with warp speed, he won't admit he's wrong as being picketed.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  And DeSantis is doing it. And you see the globalist or behavioral psychologists, they understand
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  they had to have something that would hurt a bunch of people so everybody that signed on to it won't say
[10:32.000 --> 10:40.000]  I was wrong. I got conned. Let's get the bad guys. No, now you'll all cover it up.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  And it goes on and on. See how the psychology works. See how it works.
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  But that's coming up next hour. I'm going to read you the whole article out of Germany.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  One of the largest papers, highly respected, the scientists' names, the unions, all of what they're finding.
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  I mean, it's just open and shut. 30 to 40 percent, that's an average around the country,
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  of the people they autopsy have died from the vaccine after they got it.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  Their bodies eaten by it.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  Which is exactly what the chief EU scientist, Wolfgang Wudhardt said would happen.
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  And Dr. Edon, the former head of Pfizer and all of them said, and the Nobel Prize discoverer of HIV said
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  this is going to eat holes in people.
[11:19.000 --> 11:26.000]  You get somebody a vaccine that attacks a protein in your body. Your body's going to start eating holes in your ass.
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  It's not rocket science.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  So, that's all coming up.
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  But let me tell you what we're hitting for the rest of this first hour.
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.000]  I'm usually tomorrow as it is today. And everything in this piece of legislation we've covered before,
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.000]  but I had no idea I thought it would just be more transgenderism and more gun control, more open borders, which it is.
[11:53.000 --> 12:02.000]  The trillion dollar stimulus infrastructure plan has in it stuff that when I read it in the bill, I couldn't believe it.
[12:02.000 --> 12:08.000]  I mean, I knew they were going to do it, but my God, all cars will have retina scanners and breathalysers in them.
[12:08.000 --> 12:15.000]  By law, you'll be watched by AI assistants by law in your car, because that's the holy grail.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  All your cell phones are going to contact trace you by law. No way to turn it off or it's a felony.
[12:20.000 --> 12:28.000]  Criticizing Fauci or anybody else in the CDC is five years in prison, totally illegal, into the First Amendment.
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  Transgenders can go in any bathroom they want with children, you name it.
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  Men can say they're women, it doesn't matter. They can be in all the sports, everything else.
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.000]  And it just gets more insane from there.
[12:40.000 --> 12:46.000]  And I've got the bill, it's a 2,700-page bill. I've got pages of the bill printed out here.
[12:46.000 --> 12:53.000]  And you need to go read them for yourself, because I mean, you know, I knew all this was coming, but holy smokes.
[12:53.000 --> 13:00.000]  Oh, by the way, they're going to track you by the mile and tax you while the robot watches to see if you're tired or angry or yell at your kids.
[13:00.000 --> 13:06.000]  And it's all put in the file and reported back. Oh, and Apple announced everything on your phone is going to be watched in live time,
[13:06.000 --> 13:11.000]  including all your photos will be scanned in live time. You won't be able to opt out of the cloud.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  And they're going to look for, quote, child porn and, quote, other illegal things.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  So, hey, we're going to child porn. Okay, do it. And then it's everything.
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  You're like, oh, we're against Nazis. Okay, take their rights. Okay, now you can't criticize the election.
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  Or you can't question lockdowns. That's terrorism.
[13:26.000 --> 13:35.000]  Oh, and see, that's in the two-month-old plan by but out this has it in the bill to make it illegal to criticize the lockdowns.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  I mean, wow, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.000]  So now if a family takes a photo of, say, their two-year-old daughter in the bathtub playing with a rubber ducky,
[13:44.000 --> 13:50.000]  you'll get swat teamed while Apple runs giant death camps with five million people on them.
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  And, you know, it's just absolutely involved in all forms that we can imagine.
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  That's how they're going to work. That's how they're going to persecute everybody,
[13:57.000 --> 14:03.000]  so that then all these governors and senators and FBI agents that are pedophiles, they get caught raping little kids.
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.000]  Those Democrat senators just got caught. They have the recordings of everything, raping a 12-year-old.
[14:08.000 --> 14:15.000]  Oh, well, then you're like, well, just leave them alone, too, because I got arrested for a photo of my two-year-old, you know, in the bathtub.
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  These people are sick, and they know what they're doing. That's coming up.
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  And then I've been going to defend Joe Rogan. He came out and read a mainline study.
[14:24.000 --> 14:31.000]  The media added that out that vaccines like this are seriously problems for creating poisonous variants.
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  And the media just said he made it up. He's insane. I've got Lancet Journal. I've got Associated Press.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  I've got it all for you to back up what Rogan said. That's coming up.
[14:40.000 --> 14:51.000]  And then Obama dressed in a baby blue outfit with a big platinum chain around his neck.
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  He's not a warmonger. He's not starving Africa to death. He's not a globalist puppet.
[14:55.000 --> 15:02.000]  No, no, no. He's an African god. He has his super spreader event when nobody else will be able to have an event.
[15:02.000 --> 15:11.000]  Well, the Emperor Palpatine Lightning Bolt shooting out in the video they released. I'm not joking. If you're a radio listener, we've got it up on screen.
[15:11.000 --> 15:18.000]  But that's okay when he does it. And the left is on Twitter defending it saying they want to stay locked down and you should stay locked down.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  And your kids should all wear masks, but these are special people and they don't have to.
[15:22.000 --> 15:30.000]  True North Korean-style worship. True Jim Jones-style worship. Just absolutely insane.
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  So none of the Democrats, whether it's Newsom or Pelosi or Obama, none of them got to follow all their crap rules.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  But you do. Truly sick.
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  So they're there celebrating the theft of the election at Martha's Vineyard.
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  Oh, which is it's basically five feet at sea level, private jets, all of it.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  But you don't get a car. You don't get to go outside your house.
[15:50.000 --> 15:56.000]  You're not essential, but they get to live in a 500-acre place with a huge mansion and everything else.
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.000]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations.
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  All the tyranny we warned of is down here.
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.000]  But on the good side, there is also a global awakening, the lives of which this planet has never seen.
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.000]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for your word of mouth, for your prayers over the years.
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  Because without info wars, we'd be in a lot more trouble than we are right now.
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air.
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.000]  And please take advantage of the big super sale flash sale we're doing right now at infowarstore.com.

[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that. I care about beating the New World Order.
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.000]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.000]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.000]  We're going to see this through to the end. We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.000]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowarstore.com.
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[17:54.000 --> 18:17.000]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[18:25.000 --> 18:34.000]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to Frankspeech.com now.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  To help support the CyberSupposium event,
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products,
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  but they're only offered at Frankspeech.com.
[18:45.000 --> 19:00.000]  Thank you and God bless.
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  The globalists are having their revolution,
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.000]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.000]  trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[19:15.000 --> 19:23.000]  and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[19:23.000 --> 19:28.000]  Orson slaves are just property from cradle to grave of the system
[19:28.000 --> 19:32.000]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.000]  and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  that realizes a nightmare dystopia,
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  It's that choice.
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  And it's the only choice we've got,
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  It is a spiritual battle,
[19:56.000 --> 20:10.000]  and it's the only choice at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  Well, so does he.
[20:28.000 --> 20:34.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  All right, so I just mentioned it.
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  Before I go to all this other news, let's drill into it.
[20:39.000 --> 20:45.000]  It is the Infrastructure Revitalization Act.
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  It's 2700 pages long.
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  You can go to Infowars.com,
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  link directly through these articles and read it for yourself.
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  This is not being denied, by the way.
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  The Democrats are defending this saying,
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  we need everyone watched by cameras in your car
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  and microphones and breathalysers
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  in case you do something illegal.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  This is the nanny state.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  I mean, it's not just you need an experimental deadly shot
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.000]  that wasn't even authorized by the FDA.
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  It's not just, hey, we want drag queen story time
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  and convicted pedophiles.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  It's not just we want open borders while you're locked down
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  in your house.
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  It's, hey, we want to watch you with all new cars
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  under law with cameras and microphones dialed into the police department.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  What do you think?
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  You've already accepted home assistance into your house
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  with Facebook and Google and Amazon and all the rest of it.
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  I mean, that's the nature of the future.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  You're already putting a ring up around your neighborhood.
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.000]  Now we're going to make you take it in your car.
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  And if you turn it off, you're in trouble.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  Full part of the smart city.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  This is big tech eating the regular economy.
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  Same big tech that ran the Wuhan release
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  and ran the lockdowns and doubled and tripled their profits
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  to $500 billion just last year.
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  Another $500 billion set to make this year off of you.
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  Because you take it.
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  Thomas Jefferson was famously asked by a French reporter,
[22:01.000 --> 22:04.000]  what is the level of tyranny in which humans will accept?
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  And he said the level at which you will accept.
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  What is the level that tyrants will take us to?
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  And he said the level you will accept.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  Very simple.
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  And so this is happening.
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  Let's continue.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  Republican crisis.
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  Tucker Carlson a great job on Friday.
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  Exposing it.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  The articles on infowars.com.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  And it goes through the infrastructure bill that is set to pass.
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  They're debating it this weekend.
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  And has 17 Republican cosponsors.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  I bet you can guess who.
[22:41.000 --> 22:44.000]  Everybody who's globalist or compromise
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  because they're blackmailed.
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  We got Lindsey Graham.
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  We got Mitt Romney.
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  What a good man.
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  Trump blasts nightmare infrastructure bill,
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  gift to the Democratic Party,
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  compliments of Rich McConnell and the rhinos.
[23:01.000 --> 23:05.000]  He criticizes the cameras and microphones to track you by law.
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000]  You see, it's just here now.
[23:10.000 --> 23:13.000]  How many times did I tell you the holy grail
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  of cameras and microphones all over everything watching you?
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  You're like, well, I don't have to hide them.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  Let it watch me. No, no, that's to control you
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  and know how to screw you over.
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  All this is predatory.
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  So the AI has eyes on you at all times.
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  Oh, it's got its good uses.
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  But the other day it's about total and absolute control.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  And remember how many times I told you in the last,
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  hell, 20-something years, but in the last year and a half,
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  they're going to say, oh, the unvaccinated created variants.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  Now you've got to take it by law.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  We're not going to let you fly on airplanes or have a job
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  or go in grocery stores.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  And then they announced that all over the world
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  because I've been studying them.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  I've been reading their documents like lockstep
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  from the Rockefellers who are now in control.
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.000]  People like this a year ago are like, well, lockstep.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  You know, the Rockefellers called for this plan
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  for global authoritarianism and plan for microchips
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  and can't leave your house unless you have an iPhone
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  with a tracker thing and got to take force inoculations
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  until they'd wipe out the opposition by starving them to death.
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  But, you know, the Rockefellers aren't in control.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  And who did they put in charge a month ago
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  of all U.S. COVID response and the UN, the Rockefeller Foundation.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  Sockies like we're partnered with them, they call the shots.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  They always did. They built the UN.
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.000]  They built it all, baby.
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  They didn't do all this to play games.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  And now they've sprung.
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  The monsters sprung out of the bushes.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  Now it's assaulting you. Now it's attacking you.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  So the mandates are coming.
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  That's a nice word for forced.
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.000]  The forced inoculations are coming.
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.000]  Fauci says in full FDA approval will inspire a flood
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  of vaccine requirements.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  You know, I didn't see that on my list.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.000]  There's such a day lose of clips.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  Do we have that clip, guys?
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  Somebody get that for me.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  I want to play that next segment because it's not enough
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  to just read the quote.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  I want you to hear it for yourself next segment.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  So the mandates are coming.
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  Fauci says full FDA approval will inspire a flood
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  of vaccine requirements.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  So something unapproved they're trying to make you take.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  It's already killed people which they then suppress
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  and they suppress treatments for regular viral infections
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  and bacterial to get death numbers up.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  And they send sick people to nursing homes
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  to cause high death rates.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  Man, these are some monsters.
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.000]  And now he says once it's approved, then we'll make you take it.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  Wow.
[25:38.000 --> 25:42.000]  Isn't that interesting?
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  Here's another one.
[25:43.000 --> 25:44.000]  This is out of the telegraph.
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.000]  UK travelers with Indian made AstraZeneca vaccine
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.000]  barred from the holidays.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  Oh, you thought the vaccine passport was coming.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  Oh, no.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  If you don't have the right one, you don't travel now.
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  Oh, you want to leave England?
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  You don't have the right vaccine?
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  They have a database on what you took?
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  Sorry.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  You can't travel.
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.000]  Oh, that's never coming.
[26:08.000 --> 26:09.000]  Never going to happen.
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.000]  That's Alex Jones stuff.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  That's lies.
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  Oh, and then they say the vaccine doesn't work.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  So you got to take more and you're still locked down,
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  but it's OK.
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.000]  Meanwhile, teachers union president calls for vaccine
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  mandates in schools.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  Got a clip of her coming up next segment saying that
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  who died and made the corrupt evil teachers unions
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  a bunch of communist and lazy asses who died
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  and put them in charge.
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  He just says you will do it.
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  OK, you're the boss, I guess.
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  Another stinking union.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  They're now coming out with national TV ads where you've got
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  shirts that have little plastic pockets in them.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  So you can have your vaccine passport to travel.
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  This is not a joke.
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  This is not dystopia.
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.000]  This is real dystopia.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  This is not theoretical dystopia.
[27:02.000 --> 27:03.000]  This is the real deal.
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  Government to defend federal transportation mass mandate
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  in legal filing Monday.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  Yes, got to keep those gags on the public so the globalist
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  and just in case they're in airport,
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  don't have to look at your dirty face.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  Shut your pile.
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  PhD student says he was purged by university
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.000]  for criticizing communist China.
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  That's coming up.
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  And report Nancy Pelosi told White House to consult
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  Lawrence Tribe, the big liberal communist,
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  on the CDC power grab where the CDC says
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  no one has to pay their rent anymore,
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  which has been to destroy the economy and small renters
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  so the big mega renters come in and give you your universal income
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  but with all the strings attached to it.
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  Oh, you're going to get free income.
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  Don't worry, but you're not going to be alive very long.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  They figured it all out.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  Behavioral psychologist, you wake up.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  It's the only way to stop it.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  We've got a lot more coming up today, my friends,
[28:01.000 --> 28:07.000]  but the first thing I want to do before we go to break is
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  implore you to realize how important this is.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  This is the big globalist move.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  This is 100 years of robber Baron planning.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  This is everything launched now.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  And it's not going as well as they wanted.
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  They're just going to pour on more steam though.
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.000]  So this is going to get very destructive, very reckless,
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  very, very dangerous.
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  But where they're taking us is so horrible and so dystopic.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  We don't have a choice but to do whatever it takes to stop them.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  And that's where we are right now.
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  So, folks, you're going to look back on these days as a piece of cake.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  They're going to be claiming in a year, two, three years
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  that half the population is dying from variants
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  because we didn't take the shots.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  Of course, it will be all the people who took the shots that are dying,
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.000]  because the death of logic, even those being killed, won't admit it
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  because that's too scary.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  They have Stockholm syndrome.
[28:58.000 --> 29:02.000]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.000]  that criminologists all agree on,
[29:05.000 --> 29:08.000]  and that its criminals are extremely pathological.
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.000]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[29:12.000 --> 29:17.000]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[29:17.000 --> 29:20.000]  Well, guess what? It was Anthony Fauci,
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.000]  a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  that actually killed more people than HIV
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.000]  and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  and create autoimmune disorders.
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  and would be non-lethal down the road.
[29:45.000 --> 29:48.000]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine
[29:48.000 --> 29:52.000]  because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system,
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[29:54.000 --> 29:56.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome. Go ahead.
[30:03.000 --> 30:04.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[30:04.000 --> 30:05.000]  Good, bro.
[30:05.000 --> 30:06.000]  Great last caller.
[30:06.000 --> 30:09.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore,
[30:11.000 --> 30:14.000]  with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity.
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  It's like we're living at a twilight zone, man.
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[30:18.000 --> 30:19.000]  Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.000]  for one of the products.
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  The X2 group does wonders.
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info ward.
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year.
[30:33.000 --> 30:34.000]  Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[30:36.000 --> 30:37.000]  Honor, talk to you.
[30:37.000 --> 30:38.000]  Awesome.
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  So, firstly, I wanted to do is say I love the products,
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  alpha power, even at 29.
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[30:46.000 --> 30:48.000]  All right, it helps in the bedroom.
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  So, just number one for a few words there.
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  Well, it definitely works. It's not a joke.
[30:52.000 --> 31:21.000]  Absolutely.
[31:21.000 --> 31:24.000]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[31:24.000 --> 31:30.000]  They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off 1495.
[31:30.000 --> 31:33.000]  They sell these babies for 2995 all day long.
[31:33.000 --> 31:39.000]  We've got a private label with info wars on them for 1495
[31:39.000 --> 31:42.000]  because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  and family these systems to educate them about what these
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  quote smartphones really are.
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family
[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked
[31:53.000 --> 31:55.000]  by the criminal global system.
[31:55.000 --> 32:20.000]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[32:26.000 --> 32:34.000]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to Frankspeech.com now.
[32:34.000 --> 32:37.000]  To help support the CyberSupposium event,
[32:37.000 --> 32:42.000]  I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products,
[32:42.000 --> 32:45.000]  but they're only offered at Frankspeech.com.
[32:45.000 --> 32:58.000]  Thank you and God bless.
[33:15.000 --> 33:43.000]  Music playing.
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  So I tend to get a little excited.
[33:45.000 --> 33:51.000]  I tend to get a little manic like a play-by-play guy at Super Bowl.
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.000]  On the last 30 seconds of the game when both teams are tied
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.000]  somebody's about to do a 45-yard field goal.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  Because this isn't just for some game.
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  This is for our futures and who we are.
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.000]  And the globalists are so arrogant they admit it's about
[34:07.000 --> 34:12.000]  world government and depopulation and just a super anti-Christian
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  evil that drives it.
[34:14.000 --> 34:15.000]  And it's real.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  I mean we're living in this.
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  And we have all the admissions.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  But the system knows.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  The system knows what it's doing.
[34:25.000 --> 34:29.000]  You know I just talked about last segment how the CDC announced
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  two weeks ago now.
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  Oh hey, we've signed an order.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  Everyone can stay in their houses rent free.
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  But the owners still have to pay their taxes
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  and pay their mortgages.
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  That means if you rented the garage, you know,
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  or a cottage or something to somebody and you're still paying
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  property taxes, you're still paying for maintenance,
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  you're still paying for everything,
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  you're still paying the mortgage.
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  And you're like nope sorry a year's gone by they live there free.
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  What is that designed to do?
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  I'll explain that next hour as well.
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  But it's very simple.
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  Bankrupt everybody so they bring in the universal basic income
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  including to the small renters who they've bankrupted.
[35:11.000 --> 35:18.000]  But with the universal income comes all the screens that are attached.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  They shut the economy down, they put you into a crisis,
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  and then they pose as the savior and they've got all the bills.
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  Introduce guaranteed income, paid rent, paid college,
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  paid transportation just like North Korea.
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  The answer is none of you get any of it.
[35:35.000 --> 35:42.000]  But there's a sucker born every minute as P.T. Barnum said.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  But let me play this clip.
[35:44.000 --> 35:52.000]  This is Bill Gates is on with the other globalist heir
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.000]  to a giant robber baron fortune, the Vanderbilt heir,
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  Anderson Cooper.
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  And Anderson Cooper is saying well we should just deny
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  social security benefits to people.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  Oh, because it's a privilege too, right?
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  You paid into it, it's a Ponzi scheme.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  But if you don't take the deadly experimental shot
[36:12.000 --> 36:15.000]  that violates the Nuremberg code saying you've got to do something,
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  which they admit now doesn't even work
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  and the majority of the dying have taken it,
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.000]  well then you'll just, and then Bill Gates starts smiling
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  like a pig and you know what, here it is.
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  They are saying you have to be vaccinated in order to work at a corporation.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  Is that something you support?
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  And do you think the federal government or state governments
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  or at least the federal government should mandate
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  if you want to get on an airplane, you have to be vaccinated.
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  If you want to get social security, you need to be vaccinated.
[36:46.000 --> 36:51.000]  If you want to get whatever benefits they give,
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  you need to be vaccinated for.
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  Is that something that the U.S. can and should do?
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  And he went on to say yes, but if you just back that up
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  maybe without audio for people, I mean, Gates looks like
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  he had a spontaneous ejaculation.
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  And I'm not mean that to be gross, it looks like he just,
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  he just, I can't even make the face, he's like,
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  he looks like Judge Smales when he pulls out that special putter,
[37:15.000 --> 37:21.000]  Billy Baru, he goes, oh, oh, oh, Billy, this is a big one, Billy.
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  And just has an organism.
[37:25.000 --> 37:30.000]  Remember whenever he had Vereed Zarkaria,
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  another globalist on CNN, doing an interview with him
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  a year and a half ago, and he said, you know,
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.000]  the lockdowns never really end, and Gates did the same thing.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  He had an orgasm on air.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  I mean, a picture tells a thousand words.
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  What does a live video do?
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  Oh, we'll deny him social security.
[37:46.000 --> 37:57.000]  Oh, oh, oh, yes, oh, oh, oh, it's so good.
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.000]  So we can joke about this all day, but this is the guy
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  that cooked it up, created it, hands out to the studies
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.000]  that if you give people a vaccine that attacks the spike protein,
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  the spike protein is all over your body,
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  it's going to really maim and kill a large percentage of people.
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  It kills almost all the rats, all the ferrets,
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  and now you see what's happening.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  You know, I'm not going to play the head of the U.S.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  Teachers Union saying, force everybody to have a shot.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  Everybody knows they're doing this now.
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  Why am I proving they're calling for it?
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  Why am I saying, oh, look at England,
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  we'll let you leave the country unless you've had it.
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  It's here. It's now.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  Let's get into the rest of the story,
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  and there is a lot of it there
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  about where this is going.
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  And next hour, I'm going to read to you out of the translation,
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  one of the major German newspapers highly respected
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  with the largest medical union of doctors in the country, pathologists,
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  that's coroners, that's a lot of your top doctors.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  There's a lot of fields, over 100 fields,
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  just the term pathologist.
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  Their union came out, it turns out, in March and said,
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  looks like these vaccines are killing a lot of people.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  Now they've been doing spot checks and they're finding 30 to 40%,
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  depending on where they look, 30's the low, 40's the high.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  So 35% of the death in Germany,
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  of people they're giving autopsies to,
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  died of those shots.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  Wow.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  Bombshell does not even describe that.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  But don't worry, a eugenics organization
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  that calls for world depopulation,
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.000]  the Paul Ehrlich Society has come out and tried to debunk it
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  with no proof.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  And the coroners just said,
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  will you please come see the bodies that have been eaten by this?
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  You're not an epidemiologist.
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  How dare your environmental organization come out and say,
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  oh, nobody's dying because they're not environmentalists.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  They want us dead.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  They say there's too many people everywhere.
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.000]  Who do you think trained Bill Gates,
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  Ehrlich, who do I tell you about every day?
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  Ehrlich, almost every week.
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.000]  I tell you about Ehrlich, Ehrlich, Ehrlich, Ehrlich, Ehrlich, Ehrlich,
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.000]  Ehrlich, Ehrlich, Holdren, Holdren, Holdren, Ehrlich.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.000]  Because they wrote the battle plan.
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  I'll never forget like 15 years ago,
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  Senator Jay Rockefeller was having a Senate hearing on C-SPAN.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  And I was just dialing through the channels at my house
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  with a pizza in front of me and a cold beer.
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.000]  And Rex was like, you know, three years old running around.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  And my oldest daughter was running around.
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  Charlotte and diapers.
[40:41.000 --> 40:47.000]  And I had to watch a whole two-hour hearing with John P. Holdren.
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  And Jay Rockefeller, I got to find this clip on C-SPAN.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  You can find it on our archive search system.
[40:53.000 --> 41:00.000]  He literally goes, sir, to have you in our presence is incredible.
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  I cannot believe your plan has been adopted for the planet.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  Tell us about overpopulation.
[41:05.000 --> 41:12.000]  And they're literally worshiping him because he was, years later,
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  going to be Obama's science czar.
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.000]  And they're the ones that took all the plans and put them together.
[41:19.000 --> 41:25.000]  I mean, John P. Holdren and Paul R. Ehrlich literally are the ones
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  that wrote the plan you're under right now.
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  And these people kiss their asses.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  More important than presidents, more important than him.
[41:33.000 --> 41:40.000]  So I'm reading an article with the German epidemiologists,
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.000]  pathologists, they're all coming out, foreigners.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  And they're saying how bad it is and look who counters them.
[41:47.000 --> 41:53.000]  These damn demons climb out from under a rock to try to suppress this information.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  All right, let me just let me control myself.
[41:57.000 --> 42:00.000]  Yeah, there's a Holdren.
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.000]  Now, what should I do first?
[42:05.000 --> 42:11.000]  Should I prove Joe Rogan's right in the mainline science that a vaccine like this
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  is known to cause superviruses?
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  They're saying, Joseph, oh, crap.
[42:14.000 --> 42:21.000]  Or should I show you Obama at his 500-plus acre farm on the ocean
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  at five feet above sea level that he claimed when he bought it would already be underwater
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.000]  in private jets with 700 people with no masks, no checks, which I would say is fine.
[42:30.000 --> 42:37.000]  You own that without stolen money, but you're the race bear living in a 99% white area.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  You're the guy calling for depopulation.
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  You're the guy saying don't fly in private jets.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  You're the one saying the sea level is going to rise.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  You're the one saying keep a lockdown going, but oh, I get it.
[42:46.000 --> 42:53.000]  That's for us slaves, not you, the great Obama with creeps like Stephen Colbert.
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  It's this dumb party.
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.000]  We're going to show you a video straight ahead.
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  The biosecurity state is here.
[43:00.000 --> 43:06.000]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[43:06.000 --> 43:11.000]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada who says he admires the communist dictatorship
[43:11.000 --> 43:17.000]  of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same has announced that they're buying vaccines
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  And in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.000]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[43:33.000 --> 43:34.000]  They're now implementing it.
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  And now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler,
[43:43.000 --> 43:48.000]  and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Institute in Germany.
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  And Volvers will continue to step fast and fight this.
[43:50.000 --> 43:51.000]  I don't know how long we can.
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.000]  God bless and good luck.
[43:54.000 --> 44:09.000]  I would again get right with God right now.
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air.

[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  To the third world, with their economic weapons.
[45:23.000 --> 45:31.000]  They've flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to, then, have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[45:31.000 --> 45:34.000]  capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign.
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  Hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[45:38.000 --> 45:43.000]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwaben are saying.
[45:43.000 --> 45:44.040]  And Bill Gates is saying.
[45:44.040 --> 45:50.000]  But fleeing the year-long lockdowns, that the UN and Bill Gates order them to institute,
[45:50.000 --> 45:57.000]  or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money, and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[45:57.000 --> 46:04.000]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[46:04.000 --> 46:11.000]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[46:11.000 --> 46:18.000]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions.
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.000]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.000]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[46:27.000 --> 46:37.000]  Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.000]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[46:42.000 --> 46:52.000]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the propure shower head will seal the deal.
[46:52.000 --> 47:16.000]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[47:16.000 --> 47:27.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[47:27.000 --> 47:33.000]  Well, we're to believe we got to go back on lockdown and all wear masks and we got to have vaccine passports and take shots.
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  Be able to go anywhere.
[47:35.000 --> 47:41.000]  And the very people pushing this Obama and his third administration with Biden.
[47:41.000 --> 47:50.000]  They just had a big giant party at the danger zone and it's huge 500 acre farm right on the ocean at five feet above sea level.
[47:50.000 --> 47:55.000]  The house is built the rest of the farms at about two feet of sea level.
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.000]  Hell, it sticks right out to the beach.
[47:58.000 --> 48:06.000]  And he's got to his $40 million house and $100 million property and everybody flew in on private jets.
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.000]  And oh my gosh, Jay Z and Stephen Colbert, they were all there and the photos are out there.
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  The New York Post has some of the best ones.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  And it was put out by partygoers.
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  Oh, it's thousands of people.
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.000]  They were just not wearing masks and hugging and partying and being human.
[48:22.000 --> 48:32.000]  But for all those folks that have committed suicide, all the folks that lost their jobs, all the small bars and businesses and gyms, they're closed.
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.000]  They've got some weird woman in an Egyptian outfit looking her tongue like a snake.
[48:37.000 --> 48:49.000]  And you've got Barack Obama and his black family surrounded by a bunch of rich, billionaire, white people using him as the token front for the extermination of Africa.
[48:49.000 --> 48:55.000]  Africa has borne the brunt of the U.N. admits of the 20 plus million people that started to death last year.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  New numbers have been released under the lockdown.
[48:57.000 --> 49:03.000]  14 million were Africans. That's on top of the 10 million Africans that died the year before.
[49:03.000 --> 49:10.000]  Well, no, 24 million Africans starved to death begging mommy for dinner.
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  Even the New York Times admits, oh, better send money to the U.N.
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  Why in Africa, if you don't work, you don't eat.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  If you don't farm, you don't eat.
[49:18.000 --> 49:26.000]  But the IMF and World Bank paid off all the big armies and all the leaders to starve them except four African countries said no.
[49:26.000 --> 49:31.000]  And just like Gaddafi said no, they went in and they murdered four African presidents.
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.000]  That's why Africa can't ever get up on its feet. It's not allowed to.
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  And in 2002, we got the documents.
[49:38.000 --> 49:47.000]  Greg Palace got them IMF World Bank leak where they said, what we've done to Africa and Latin America, we're now going to do to Europe and America and Canada and Australia.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  And they did it.
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  Yeah, there's the New York Times headline.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  They'll cut your legs off and give you crutches.
[49:53.000 --> 50:01.000]  No work, no food, pandemic deepens global hunger.
[50:01.000 --> 50:11.000]  And they wouldn't even let the Africans go out in a bunch of countries, especially the communist ones, all the ones of liberals worship and grow food.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  They just got to starve to death.
[50:13.000 --> 50:23.000]  But it's OK because play it again with audio. Barack Obama's in a baby blue outfit with a big platinum rapper chain.
[50:23.000 --> 50:30.000]  Man, with a bunch of weird ass billionaire Jeffrey Epstein pedophiles around them.
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  Literally, look at the list of who's there.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  It's a bunch of pedophiles scum.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  They're like, yeah, we got a black guy as our front man.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  He worked real good for us.
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  Now we've got all these black spokesperson for what we're doing.
[50:42.000 --> 50:47.000]  People are all going straight to hell.
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  I mean, can you think of something more disgusting than this?
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  And it just goes on.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  Oh, and what are they celebrating?
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.000]  We overthrew the election.
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  We overthrew Trump.
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.000]  We chumped Trump into a deadly vaccine.
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.000]  Africa won't take the shot.
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  They've already been down this road.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  Australia was a penal colony.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  They won't take it.
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  But Americans, well, they're at 50%.
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  What about the Israelis?
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.000]  What about prisoners for ever thousands of years under the control of that evil group?
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  They got it up at 90% now.
[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  Right.
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  And almost everybody dying took the shot.
[51:25.000 --> 51:30.000]  But in Australia, 20%, 23% have taken it.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  And 99% of those sick took the shot.
[51:32.000 --> 51:39.000]  Those are real numbers, but it's OK because Barack Obama, his dad was a quarter black.
[51:39.000 --> 51:44.000]  His dad was not from Kenya, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:44.000 --> 51:47.000]  His dad was from Chicago.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  We know his name.
[51:48.000 --> 51:49.000]  Frank Marshall Davis.
[51:49.000 --> 51:50.000]  Look it up.
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  He even admits he stayed with Frank Marshall Davis when he was a kid.
[51:53.000 --> 51:59.000]  And there's all the footage of his mother in Betty Page style porn.
[51:59.000 --> 52:03.000]  It is dad shot right there on the couch and all of it.
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.000]  Open and shut.
[52:04.000 --> 52:05.000]  There's his real daddy.
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  So I don't even hate Obama.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  This is a guy from birth born into the CIA.
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.000]  He had a transgender nanny when he was five years old.
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  I mean, he's been probably sexually abused his whole life.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  He is a mind control operative.
[52:21.000 --> 52:22.000]  Undoubtedly.
[52:22.000 --> 52:31.000]  But when you look at Obama now, he totals out on stage in a baby blue outfit with a big platinum chain.
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  Stealing fake corporate gangster culture that they inflicted on black people in this country.
[52:37.000 --> 52:51.000]  Everybody else to sit there and put some filter over the video of him like Emperor Palpatine with electricity shooting off with the guest list has come out of over a thousand people, 98% white.
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.000]  I mean, what type of weirdness is this?
[52:55.000 --> 53:05.000]  You got some black dude living on a hundred million dollar piece of property right by the ocean when he says the sea water is going to rise.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  We're all going to die in just a few years.
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  When he bought it six, seven years ago, they said it would be underwater by now.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  Of course, it's not private jets come private jets are bad.
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  Oh, we've all got a contact trace.
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.000]  We've all got to lock down, but not not the royalty.
[53:21.000 --> 53:26.000]  Happy 60th birthday, President Obama, who is currently the president.
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  It's not Joe Biden.
[53:30.000 --> 53:39.000]  And there's his dad, Frank Marshall Davis, famous photographer, famous communist.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  Go on record.
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  Put out the porn movies with mommy.
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  And a lot of other people.
[53:46.000 --> 53:55.000]  The point is, is that Obama said when he was the Harvard Law Journal editor, you can find these.
[53:55.000 --> 54:02.000]  He was born in Kenyon, who his dad was as a distraction for him is really from then later he changed it back.
[54:02.000 --> 54:08.000]  But we all bought that Arthur thing that was put out by Hillary Clinton.
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.000]  So there you go.
[54:09.000 --> 54:12.000]  Liberal elites are laughing at us.
[54:12.000 --> 54:20.000]  Obama scaled back 60th birthday party draw a celeb guest and I are from conservatives and communist China.
[54:20.000 --> 54:26.000]  As patriots as pro human people as as as as as as as nationalist as pro humans.
[54:26.000 --> 54:31.000]  We shouldn't play their game like, oh, look, you didn't have a COVID lockdown or oh, look, you didn't wear a mask.
[54:31.000 --> 54:35.000]  We should just point out the whole things of fraud.
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  All things alive.
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.000]  By the way, I sent this to you.
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.000]  Scott, you probably gave it to me, but I didn't see it.
[54:41.000 --> 54:49.000]  Jack Pasobak has been given a warning by Twitter that he may be suspended because the German government has complained about him.
[54:49.000 --> 54:58.000]  And wait till you see the letter from Germany because Twitter now under law complies and it says you talked about pro human.
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  That's not allowed.
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.000]  I'm not joking.
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  That's coming up next hour.
[55:04.000 --> 55:05.000]  Here's the articles.
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  No work, no food pandemic deepens global hunger in Africa.
[55:08.000 --> 55:13.000]  So he's dancing up there. The Africans are under lockdown to starving to death.
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  Another 350,000 Ethiopians are dying right now during the lockdown, but that's OK.
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  Because, you know, Barack Obama, I mean, he's a little African.
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.000]  So long as he kills all the black people, it's liberal.
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.000]  This is the extermination operation, my friends.
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.000]  I'm going to go to break.
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  I'm going to start the second hour.
[55:35.000 --> 55:46.000]  As I promised you, I'm going to hit the huge German medical news of their main pathologist union coming out and saying it's the vaccines killing people.
[55:46.000 --> 55:52.000]  But first, I'm going to hit Joe Rogan, who I told you once he got free and clear, could do what he wanted was a patriot.
[55:52.000 --> 55:57.000]  Now everybody's seeing that he's wearing 1776 shirts and he's hit on all cylinders, kicking ass.
[55:57.000 --> 56:03.000]  And they're totally flippin out and really proud of Joe going all the way and, you know, as the evidence amounts.
[56:03.000 --> 56:12.000]  And so Joe came out and read a study about a majority of people, you know, out there that are spreading the viruses have been vaccinated.
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.000]  The evidence is that that is viral sloughing.
[56:16.000 --> 56:23.000]  Well, they just said he's insane, but I'll actually show you the studies that he showed and more coming up separately.
[56:23.000 --> 56:29.000]  The New World Order and Bloomberg and all the globalists are trying to shut us down and doing horrible things.
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  That's behind the scenes, which I love. That means I'm over the target.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  All I ask you to do is financially support us to keep us on air.
[56:36.000 --> 56:42.000]  And so I can do a lot of other things behind the scenes that we're working on and getting done for you and myself and everybody together.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  So go to infowarstore.com.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  This weekend is the last couple days.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  I may run to like Tuesdays on a new specials yet.
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.000]  Privacy pouches that protect yourself from hackers, contact tracers.
[56:52.000 --> 57:00.000]  They're 1495 with 10 bumper stickers and a big door sign that says, you know, no contact tracing here.
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.000]  So 11 stickers and the privacy pouch for 1495.
[57:04.000 --> 57:07.000]  That's going to end on Tuesday or so.
[57:07.000 --> 57:14.000]  We have the vitamin D3 highest quality organic formulation with the calcium gummies for adults and children for your immune system.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  It's 50% off.

[57:47.000 --> 57:51.000]  So what's the most important part? Let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist.
[57:51.000 --> 57:54.000]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.000]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  And that's my allegor.
[57:59.000 --> 58:06.000]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy

[59:54.000 --> 59:59.000]  All right, we are now into hour number two on this Sunday edition.
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  I've actually got good cheer about all this. That's why I kind of laugh and giggle about it all.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  I don't think this is funny, folks, but I'm not going to start crying.
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  You're on television and the radio in front of a millions of people.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  Okay, here's just an example. And I noticed that this is how the left operates.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  When I was getting deplatformed three years ago, they would go,
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  you're not being deplatformed. No one's censoring you.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  Because back then, censorship was on American and nobody does that.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  I'm like, I'm told I'm being deplatformed.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  We actually got documents from Google.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  I don't think this is funny, folks, but I'm not going to start crying.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  You're on television and the radio in front of a millions of people.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Okay, here's just an example.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  I'm being deplatformed. We actually got documents from Google leaked by Google,
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  high-level folks who thought it was wrong, that Mike Cernowitz gave us.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  And they're like, Jones claims he's being called a thing called deplatformed.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  That was three and a half years ago. Now, everybody knows that term.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  Well, I noticed they passed laws in Germany that they could prosecute people three months ago.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  They would get passed if Germans complained and the German fought police, whoever that is, say it's bad.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  So I'm like, gee, I wonder how they're going to enforce that.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Well, we covered the story. Then pop, it pops up.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Just like they've got a piece of in the bill in the infrastructure bill.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  Oh, it's infrastructure, all right, of evil.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  If you lie about a health official, you can be arrested.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Probably had libel laws. No, no, no, they say it's a lie. You get arrested.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  Well, Germany's basically where we're going, or Australia, where they come.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  You see the footage in Australia, where you criticize these people, they come arrest you.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  And it's pure intimidation. They think you're like they are.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  And so they think you'll bow to this. I know you're not going to do it. I know your heart's just like mine.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  That's what scumbags haven't figured out.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  But Jack Pesovic's a Navy veteran, great guy, great sources.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  And he put a tweet out that he got notified today by Twitter that the German government's looking at.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  Now, I get average Americans will hear this thing. That's that's insane.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  They've got the UN investigating our border policy right now.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  They've got the UN investigating our police. That's what this is. That's what globalism is.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  Is your government opening you up to outside authoritarian attacks?
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  So here he says at the top of the tweet, he says Jack Pesovic, OK, Germany.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  OK, Germany, I hear you're calling. I get your message. I better bow.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Twitter says hello. Twitter is required by German law to provide notice to users who are reported by people from Germany via the Network Enforcement Act reporting flow.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Sounds like a space alien wrote it. We have received a complaint regarding your account at Jack Pesovic for the following content.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Tweet 1423673983082418177. OK.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  Now, here's the offending text. I mean, this is like two plus two equals four.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  So Winston's being being tortured to death because he secretly set it to sleep.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  You know, Winston said two freedom is two plus two equals four in his sleep.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  He wakes up in 1984 and says, did I just say that? Did the telescreen here?
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  And a month later, he's being tortured to death and they go, yeah, we heard it.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  So what did they see that he said? Drumroll, please.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  Here is the tweet. The thought crime.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  We are tearing down the conditioning of the anti-human agenda and we will win.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  Oh, I might have heard that before.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  We are tearing down the conditioning of the anti-human agenda and we will win.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  I almost just want to just play that forever. Just quit the show and just that's what we say.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  Like, imagine our in the future, we're defeating them and probably a conflict.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  Our tanks are moving in on their final headquarters, like Hitler and the bunker.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  And it's like, we're going to hear like, we are tearing down the conditioning of the anti-human agenda and we will win.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  This is our creed. And the German police, they go, no.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  It's like the New York Times said, they were shouting, we want freedom and other terrorist slogans.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Remember that last week?
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  They have investigated the reported content and have found that it is not subject to removal under the Twitter rules or German law.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  Accordingly, we have not taken any action as a result of the specific report.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  Sincerely, we're just threatening your ass.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  That's the level. You can't say, I am pro-human. I got a heart. I got red blood. I love life.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  No!
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  We've been in a lot more trouble than we are right now.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air.

[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  Welcome back. We're now into hour number two.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  Evil is always going to make a run at good.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  And it always builds up in secret and prepares all its spies and minions and then sends out its probes.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  And if it doesn't find the opposition, it escalates the attack.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  And then if you push it back, it will launch a full assault and try to take over, which it's doing right now.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  It'd rather take over all sneakily, but globally you see a big ham fisted out in the open.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  Pedophilia is good, world government is good, unapproved inoculations are good, censorship is good.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  Mass starvation in the third world from the lockdown is good.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  This is real desperation death throw stuff.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  I'd use the analogy of Bladerunner, the original Harrison Ford when he shoots Priss, and when she realizes she's dying, she's like...
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  That's what's going on right now.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:18.480]  The question is how many of us are they going to drag in the hole with them with all these nuclear weapons and bio weapons?
[1:07:18.760 --> 1:07:21.800]  He's lawless may release them just to take us down with them
[1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:27.400]  So we're not out of the out of the woods by by any a man by any stretch of the imagination
[1:07:27.400 --> 1:07:31.800]  We're in some deep crap, but they are getting their ass handed to them. We're just too powerful
[1:07:32.560 --> 1:07:37.560]  The the lust for freedom and lust isn't a good word in the Bible, but it's a good word to me
[1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:45.520]  I'm saying there's a desire for freedom. I just I desire freedom more than I desire the most beautiful woman you can imagine
[1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:48.600]  It's first and foremost. It's it's it's it's
[1:07:49.640 --> 1:07:53.480]  It's my goddess and I'm not some occultic goddess worshiper
[1:07:53.480 --> 1:07:58.120]  I do like the things God's created, but you get what I'm saying. I mean, there's a North Star
[1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:04.400]  I'm following its freedom and it sure as hell isn't subserving my will over a bunch of degenerate
[1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:07.720]  Nobodies, I'll burn in hell before I do that
[1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:10.960]  See, there's my flesh saying that no Lord, please help me
[1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:13.880]  No, I don't want to burn in hell before I do that. Love you. Jesus. Help me
[1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:20.080]  The point is I will not bow to these people I bow to God immediately because God is incredible and I've seen it
[1:08:20.080 --> 1:08:22.080]  I will not bow to these lesser people
[1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:25.640]  Never gonna happen
[1:08:26.040 --> 1:08:28.040]  So
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:31.040]  Let's get into the big news here
[1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:38.040]  Joe Rogan is a smart guy and he overthinks things. I've known Joe Rogan 23 years
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:43.600]  They've been in 1998 was friends with him by 1999 then a lot of time with Joe and
[1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:49.440]  Joe has a big heart and he's been a world champions at everything's done
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:56.680]  Commentating and and at taekwondo and and at comedy and at podcasting. He's been number one and everything
[1:08:56.680 --> 1:09:00.960]  Aspen a lot of time trying to wake Joe up and and he he he's a good guy
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:04.920]  But he had to get to wake up on his own and I told you he'd start hitting on all cylinders
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:09.200]  And and and he has and not because I told him stuff or showed him stuff
[1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:14.160]  He projects his own decency because Joe's a good guy out of the world
[1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:23.520]  And now the evidence is completely overwhelming and Joe Rogan is a microcosm of every person out there that knows what's going on
[1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:26.720]  But just can't believe it's this crazy
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:28.720]  And so let's get into it right now
[1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:33.280]  Joe came out on what Thursday into the big hit podcast
[1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:37.880]  Where he simply reported the scientific facts we'll play a clip in a moment
[1:09:39.640 --> 1:09:41.120]  That
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:46.240]  The majority of people around the world getting sick have been inoculated. That's that's in the mainstream news not debated
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:49.760]  Hell, it's 95% of those in Israel 99% in
[1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:55.720]  Australia 90 plus percent in and in places like Gibraltar and the list goes on and on Iceland
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:00.520]  And he said look at this study that shows that
[1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:08.080]  You can have people that have been inoculated with the vaccine that then slough a more deadly virus and the media didn't attack what Joe said
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:13.720]  I noticed they created straw men off of something else and said he was wrong
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:17.160]  But I want to play the clip
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:25.080]  And I want to show you just a small snapshot. This is a small snapshot. I've got like 50 articles. I'm going to show you 10
[1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:31.680]  From prestigious organizations saying exactly what Joe said, but the system knows what he said is true
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:40.200]  They are simply hoping you don't look at the information
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:43.520]  So here's what he had to say a few days ago in his podcast
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:50.560]  Vaccination can enhance the transmission of highly virulent pathogens, right? So this is a scientific paper
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:52.520]  from
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:53.520]  2015
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:57.520]  That shows
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:00.040]  That
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:06.880]  If here's it said there's this is what important quote vaccines that keep the host alive
[1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:09.400]  But still allow transmission
[1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:14.400]  Can thus allow virulent strains to circulate in a population. So
[1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:23.400]  Vaccines that don't kill the virus vaccines that allow people like this is one of the things we're finding out about what they're calling breakthrough cases
[1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:33.400]  Right. So people who are vaccinated can still get covid and they can still transmit covid is recently happened at the comedy store of vaccinated comedian
[1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:39.400]  Gave covid to like 12 different fucking people at the comedy store. Some of them vaccinated some of them not
[1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:46.400]  That situation where the vaccine just kind of protects you from serious damage, right?
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:52.400]  But it protects you from really being like badly hospitalized or death
[1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:58.400]  But doesn't stop you from getting the virus can possibly lead to the virus
[1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:03.400]  So these people that are saying oh, it's these unvaccinated people that are responsible for the variance
[1:12:03.400 --> 1:12:08.400]  Well, there's actually scientific papers that point to the very
[1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:17.400]  Sort of environment that we're creating by having so many people vaccinated with a vaccine that doesn't kill off the virus
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:21.400]  It actually kills off the virus, right?
[1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:30.400]  By having so many people vaccinated with a vaccine that doesn't kill off the virus. It actually can lead to more potent viruses
[1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:41.400]  Try finding that story anywhere other than doctors. I'm getting a PhD sending me these things guys who won't speak about it publicly because they're worried about the blowback
[1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:50.400]  People who are physicians, people who are even epidemiologists, even people that deal with diseases and viruses, they're concerned
[1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:57.400]  And they don't want to talk about it publicly because people call them anti-vaccines. It's really wild out there
[1:12:57.400 --> 1:13:05.400]  So Joe's really good at going along with their language but getting this stuff front and center and encountering the lies
[1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:11.400]  Now you notice he said the part about well, you know, you take the shot, it protects you from really serious illness
[1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:16.400]  He's even going along with that current BS and a month he'll be exposing and I would imagine
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:19.400]  He didn't tell me that. I can just see the train of thought here
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:22.400]  But this is a dozen. The evidence shows it makes it worse
[1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:31.400]  The most people in hospital have taken the shot. Most of the folks die of taking the shot. That's a fouchy lie that it doesn't work but it keeps you from getting really sick. That doesn't matter
[1:13:31.400 --> 1:13:37.400]  Here are the actual documents, okay? So here's Joe Rogan blasts racist vaccine passports
[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:41.400]  This is the majority of folks not taking it are black and exposes breakthrough cases
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:47.400]  COVID-19 vaccines could add fuel to evolution of coronavirus mutations
[1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:54.400]  MPR and that's from months ago and it's everything Joe said and more. They're not even hiding this
[1:13:54.400 --> 1:14:03.400]  Okay, Joe's vindicated right there. More polio cases now caused by vaccine and by wild virus Associated Press
[1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:07.400]  Says the Bill and Melinda Gates vaccine cause massive polio outbreaks worldwide
[1:14:07.400 --> 1:14:11.400]  Okay, boom. It goes in the body, it mutates, and then it goes even more deadly
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:16.400]  UN says new polio outbreak in Sudan caused by oral vaccine ABC News
[1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:25.400]  Okay, here's the UN report right here immunization agenda 2030 from a global strategy to leave no one behind from the UN
[1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:33.400]  And it admits right here vaccine delivered polio viruses are the majority of the illnesses worldwide
[1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:40.400]  It's all right here. Right there. Vaccine delivered polio outbreaks. There it is. Okay, that's the damn report
[1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:48.400]  Lands it one of the most prestigious in the world SARS COVID-V2 evolution and vaccines cause for concern
[1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:52.400]  And it says yes, they're the main cause and they predicted this would happen
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:57.400]  The secret ingredient for stronger vaccines gets into all that from Gavi, another big study
[1:14:57.400 --> 1:15:04.400]  Bombshell, Nobel Prize winner reveals COVID vaccines creating variants predicted that back in May
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:06.400]  And now it's all happening
[1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:11.400]  Vaccinated people with breakthrough infections can spread the Delta variant CDC says NPR
[1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:17.400]  Let's just let's just get this out the oven. They're not even hiding it. They give you the fine print
[1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:24.400]  They admit it's all going on and then they go, oh, but it's not true when you actually point out the fine print
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:29.400]  COVID-19 vaccines could add fuel to evolution of coronavirus NPR
[1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:33.400]  So Joe Rogan's right, stick it up your globalist ass
[1:15:33.400 --> 1:15:38.400]  We're going to come back. Joe's courage can be contagious
[1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:43.400]  That's how we beat the new world order is saying I'm dumb with you people
[1:15:43.400 --> 1:15:52.400]  Just like the main medical union in Germany just came out and said the vaccines are killing 30 to 40% of the people in Germany
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:16:03.400]  Stay with us
[1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:26.400]  We've been a lot more trouble than we are right now. So again, thanks for keeping us on the air

[1:18:58.400 --> 1:19:05.400]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational
[1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:11.400]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover
[1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:17.400]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades
[1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:21.400]  To get ready for this, to be able to find it off, humanity is strong, we're incredible
[1:19:21.400 --> 1:19:25.400]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it
[1:19:25.400 --> 1:19:28.400]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it
[1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:34.400]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential
[1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:42.400]  And at the same time supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family

[1:20:25.400 --> 1:20:31.400]  You know, my brain is storming so fast
[1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:34.400]  I can hardly do this show
[1:20:34.400 --> 1:20:39.400]  I'm lucky I should be sitting down right in all this town, but I know you're all going through this too
[1:20:39.400 --> 1:20:41.400]  This is getting so clear what's happening
[1:20:41.400 --> 1:20:43.400]  So crazy
[1:20:43.400 --> 1:20:52.400]  The Globalist released a bio weapon from the Wuhan lab
[1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:54.400]  That they controlled
[1:20:54.400 --> 1:20:57.400]  That simply showed up in their machines
[1:20:57.400 --> 1:21:00.400]  So they could then give us a vaccine that was poisoned
[1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:02.400]  And we figured that out back then
[1:21:02.400 --> 1:21:11.400]  That they'd done the similar test before and knew that if you created a vaccine for this basically harmless thing, that vaccine would kill you
[1:21:11.400 --> 1:21:18.400]  And they got the whole medical system to basically sign on to it, but they didn't
[1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:20.400]  Sign on to it
[1:21:20.400 --> 1:21:32.400]  The vast majority of scientists came out and said this doesn't make sense, this has been tried before, what are you doing?
[1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:39.400]  But see, when it causes all the death, they then say the unvaccinated did it, which we said a year and a half ago
[1:21:39.400 --> 1:21:43.400]  It's not like I'm just saying this now, plus the data shows that now
[1:21:43.400 --> 1:21:47.400]  We said it a year and a half ago, we predicted it 20 years ago
[1:21:47.400 --> 1:21:52.400]  Then it happens, it's exactly what we predicted
[1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:54.400]  And they just think you're ignorant
[1:21:54.400 --> 1:21:56.400]  And what did Christ say?
[1:21:56.400 --> 1:22:02.400]  My people perish for lack of knowledge
[1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:07.400]  And I'm going to butcher this verse out of the Bible, maybe the crew can pull it up, these are the times for Bible verses
[1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:13.400]  If my people humble themselves and seek my face
[1:22:13.400 --> 1:22:18.400]  And repent, I will heal them, I will heal their land
[1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:25.400]  But you got to say, hey, I'm wrong, I want to change, believe me, I'm just as bad as all of you folks
[1:22:25.400 --> 1:22:30.400]  I mean, I've got to constantly control myself, not to attack people
[1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:34.400]  Because I know it's God's plan to do that, and God's going to carry that out
[1:22:34.400 --> 1:22:39.400]  There's the quote, if my people, what you're called by my name, shall humble themselves
[1:22:39.400 --> 1:22:44.400]  And pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways
[1:22:44.400 --> 1:22:52.400]  Then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land
[1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:59.400]  Now how powerful a second Chronicle 714, because if you understand that, you understand everything in the universe
[1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:01.400]  Put it back up for me, please
[1:23:01.400 --> 1:23:08.400]  If my people, the people that love justice and goodness, who want to be good, what you're called by my name
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:13.400]  Shall humble themselves, and stop playing God, and pray, make a connection to me
[1:23:13.400 --> 1:23:17.400]  And seek me, it says it right there, pray, seek me, connect
[1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:22.400]  And turn from their wicked ways, God knows you're not perfect, God made you
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:26.400]  King David was a man of his own heart, that's what God's like
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:30.400]  Killing his best buddy, having sex with his wife, damn God made us, God's got passion
[1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:34.400]  Look, if my people, what you're called by my name, shall humble themselves
[1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:39.400]  And pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways
[1:23:39.400 --> 1:23:46.400]  Then will I hear from heaven, because there's an open channel, and will forgive their sin
[1:23:46.400 --> 1:23:49.400]  Now here's the most important part
[1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:52.400]  And will heal their land
[1:23:52.400 --> 1:24:01.400]  God, when you repent, God begins to shut down these devils, and destroy them
[1:24:01.400 --> 1:24:03.400]  Just like that
[1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:07.400]  But you've got to recognize you're not in charge, recognize you're failed
[1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:12.400]  Call out, make the connection, and then God wipes these people out
[1:24:12.400 --> 1:24:18.400]  You want to call in the air cover, you want to call down the fire, like Elijah
[1:24:18.400 --> 1:24:22.400]  You've got to do it
[1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:26.400]  And there's one thing God hates, and that's cowards
[1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:33.400]  You've got to stop caring what people think about you, and you've got to stop caring what the globalists do to you
[1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:40.400]  Because you better be worried about the fact that they're going to get your soul
[1:24:40.400 --> 1:24:44.400]  And if you think this life means anything, it means nothing
[1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:50.400]  This is ten seconds from the rest of eternity, this isn't a fly on the ass of the universe
[1:24:50.400 --> 1:24:55.400]  This is nothing
[1:24:55.400 --> 1:25:01.400]  So all these people that cheated God, and cheated themselves, and did all this evil stuff
[1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:07.400]  I mean, they're malfunctioning cancers, these people don't even rate
[1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:12.400]  I remember when I got invited to Hollywood, and they tried to seduce me, and I was like, this don't feel good
[1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:14.400]  You couldn't pay me to be part of this
[1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:20.400]  But imagine going to a Barack Obama party, or going to a Chuck Schumer party, or going to any of these
[1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:27.400]  A Bill Clinton party, and those are the most empty nobodies in the world
[1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:34.400]  But you just pull out the side of the highway at some old black church, some old white church, some old Hispanic church
[1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:39.400]  Where real people are, and you just feel like you're on fire, you feel satisfied, you feel real
[1:25:39.400 --> 1:25:44.400]  Everything they claim they are, they don't have nothing
[1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:46.400]  Zero
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:50.400]  These people have no power
[1:25:50.400 --> 1:25:53.400]  They're the failures, they weren't connected to God
[1:25:53.400 --> 1:25:56.400]  That's why they'd go against God's plan
[1:25:56.400 --> 1:26:02.400]  I say stop worshiping these damn people, and stop bowing down to them, and stop worrying what happens to this stupid ass body
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:04.400]  You're going to lose this thing
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:10.400]  Stop loving this damn flesh, and giving it all your power, and worrying about it, and dumping potions on it, and patting it all day
[1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:12.400]  You should take care of your bodies as God's temple
[1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:17.400]  But if you lose your body in the service against evil, that is a blessing
[1:26:17.400 --> 1:26:21.400]  I mean, look at these people, bowing down because they love black people
[1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:30.400]  When those very Democrats set up the whole system to take over the black church, and the black community, and put their ass in prison
[1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:37.400]  Alright, I said I'd cover the news, and I said I'd cover this big German news, and I will cover it when we come back in the next segment
[1:26:37.400 --> 1:26:43.400]  And then I got a bunch of clips the guys were telling me about them, we got the CDC director saying the vaccine doesn't protect you just today
[1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:46.400]  I talk about a rope of dope, we knew that was coming
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:49.400]  And now they're just point black static, because this is a war on logic
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:55.400]  And then we've got Fauci I mentioned earlier, they found the clip, it wasn't in the tweet, but they found the clip where he said
[1:26:55.400 --> 1:27:00.400]  Yeah, the force inoculations are coming, that's coming up, and we'll hit a lot of other stuff
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:03.400]  And I'll just say this right now
[1:27:03.400 --> 1:27:08.400]  If I had two or three times the funding we've got, I could have done a lot more, and I'm not bitching
[1:27:08.400 --> 1:27:12.400]  I know our audience is amazing, you've done great things supporting us
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:15.400]  But I am completely all in
[1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:22.400]  I mean, I'm trying right now to sell my house to put it into the fight, which is not even a hard decision to make
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:29.400]  I mean, you got the whole damn thing coming in on your ass, and everything's in, it's all in, all in
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:33.400]  All in, ladies and gentlemen, so just go to MyPillow.com

[1:28:12.400 --> 1:28:16.400]  Get Vitamin C, get Vitamin D3, get X2 before it sells out

[1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:25.400]  I mean, the great thing about this is the globalists have trillions of dollars and they can't beat us
[1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:29.400]  And then I scrounge around to get millions, and we're giving them a real defense
[1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:35.400]  We're fighting them super hard, we are very close to beating them with that tiny amount of money
[1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:40.400]  So thank you for your support, you've changed the world, M4WarStore.com
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:45.400]  Or AAA 2533139, 2533139
[1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:49.400]  But get in there and support us, because there's nowhere you can spend money
[1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:51.400]  That has a bigger effect on the fighting at Seville
[1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:56.400]  There's not one damn place you can do it
[1:29:21.400 --> 1:29:26.400]  The globalists that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT
[1:29:26.400 --> 1:29:29.400]  And other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV
[1:29:29.400 --> 1:29:33.400]  And they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses
[1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:38.400]  That would actually go attack the t-limbs for sex in the body and create autoimmune disorders
[1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:44.400]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road
[1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:47.400]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine
[1:29:47.400 --> 1:29:51.400]  Because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system
[1:29:51.400 --> 1:29:54.400]  Basically giving you the equivalent of HIV
[1:29:54.400 --> 1:30:20.400]  That's right ladies and gentlemen
[1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:25.400]  So thank you so much for taking my call
[1:30:25.400 --> 1:30:28.400]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products
[1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:31.400]  The X2 group does wonders, they recommend it to everybody

[1:30:35.400 --> 1:30:38.400]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year, thanks for holding, go ahead
[1:30:38.400 --> 1:30:40.400]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you, it's an honor
[1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:41.400]  Honor, talk to you
[1:30:41.400 --> 1:30:42.400]  Awesome

[1:33:13.400 --> 1:33:15.400]  You got me
[1:33:19.400 --> 1:33:23.400]  Live from theInfoWars.com studios
[1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:26.400]  You're listening to the ALIX Jones show
[1:33:26.400 --> 1:33:32.400]  You got me

[1:33:54.400 --> 1:33:57.400]  You got me
[1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:10.400]  What are they going to do when all the scientists and all the experts come out and admit it was mass murder?
[1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:12.400]  Where are Bill Gates and the globalist going to go?
[1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:16.400]  They think when they abuse this big, this bad, this evil, too evil to fail
[1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:19.400]  That somehow will rationalize it and they'll be protected
[1:34:19.400 --> 1:34:25.400]  They wanted to hurt us, they wanted to rape us, they wanted to depopulate us, they wanted to poison us
[1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:28.400]  And they've done it just like the secret Tuskegee experiments
[1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:31.400]  That weren't just the poor black people in Alabama
[1:34:31.400 --> 1:34:33.400]  20,000 of them injected with syphilis
[1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:38.400]  But people all over the world and the same groups done it on a mass scale
[1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:40.400]  They think, too satanic to fail
[1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:42.400]  Well, it will fail
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:46.400]  So that's the name of the full show today
[1:34:46.400 --> 1:34:49.400]  The full show broadcast
[1:34:49.400 --> 1:34:53.400]  German's top medical society
[1:34:53.400 --> 1:35:01.400]  Comes out and says 30 to 40% of the dead are from the vaccinated
[1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:06.400]  Sunday Live, Germany's largest pathology union
[1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:11.400]  Warns COVID vaccines are accounting for 30 or 40% of Germany's dead
[1:35:11.400 --> 1:35:14.400]  Who are pathologists?
[1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:18.400]  People that know what kills you, whether it's lung cancer or heart attacks
[1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:23.400]  Or whether it's other cancer or whether you were stabbed to death or run over
[1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:27.400]  Or whether you were poisoned, that's what pathology is
[1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:30.400]  The path of the human body
[1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:36.400]  And it's in a major, major scientific reports
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:38.400]  It's in major journals
[1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:41.400]  Put that back on screen, it's one of the biggest newspapers in Germany
[1:35:41.400 --> 1:35:46.400]  There it is, pathology, the study of causes of effects of disease and injury
[1:35:46.400 --> 1:35:53.400]  So, when the police want to know what do you get poisoned with, what does she get shot with
[1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:57.400]  What happened to them, they send it to a pathologist
[1:35:57.400 --> 1:36:02.400]  So if you want to know what's killing people, you go to a pathologist
[1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:05.400]  Who would know if the vaccines were killing people?
[1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:10.400]  It would be a pathologist, a coroner, a medical examiner
[1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:15.400]  Those are names we have for people by law that work for the county or the city or the state
[1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:18.400]  Or the federal government who we want to know what happened
[1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:24.400]  Because it's important if somebody's running around, it's poisoning people to death
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:27.400]  It was important back in Shakespeare or Julius Caesar's day
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:30.400]  Before him, it was important back in Christ's day
[1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:35.400]  It was important in Genghis Khan's day, and it's important in our day right now
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:42.400]  So, one of the major regional German newspapers, and you start reading the article
[1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:46.400]  Because people don't want to get in trouble, when you start reading the English translation
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:51.400]  It's like, okay, we're doctors, we're scientists, we're not attacking anything
[1:36:51.400 --> 1:36:55.400]  We just want to ask this question and we're allowed to
[1:36:55.400 --> 1:37:00.400]  And then you read deeper, because this is a bunch of German articles
[1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:05.400]  And I went and made sure and translated it out of German back into English on the sites
[1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:11.400]  And I already know all this, but it's scarier now to have one of the leading pathologists in Germany
[1:37:11.400 --> 1:37:17.400]  Who's done his own study of a bunch of dead bodies found the same number, 30 to 40% dead
[1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:24.400]  Of the dead bodies, 30, 40% of the bodies they're now autopsying die to the vaccine, they believe
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:29.400]  But they, oh, don't worry though, where's my book head?
[1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:34.400]  What'd I do with my, oh here it is, where'd my eco science book go, did I remove it?
[1:37:34.400 --> 1:37:40.400]  Oh, it's right here, look at this, but don't worry, who's in the article?
[1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:46.400]  They've got the John P. Holdren institution saying with no evidence it's not true
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:53.400]  When he wrote the science book on depopulation, poison vaccines, poison fluoride and everything else
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:57.400]  To be, Paul Ehrlich's the famous eugenicist to kill most of the people
[1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:02.400]  His plan finally got adopted
[1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:04.400]  Paul Ehrlich, John P. Holdren
[1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:07.400]  So, let's go over it
[1:38:07.400 --> 1:38:15.400]  German chief pathologist sounds alarm on fatal vaccine injuries
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:25.400]  The regional daily Osburger Algermain reported
[1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:34.400]  Shremacher assumed that the 30 to 40% of them died from the vaccination
[1:38:34.400 --> 1:38:40.400]  In his opinion, the frequency of fatal consequences of vaccinations is underestimated
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:46.400]  A politically explosive statement in times when the vaccination campaign is losing momentum
[1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:53.400]  The Delta variant is spreading rapidly and restrictions on non-vaccinated people are being discussed
[1:38:53.400 --> 1:39:01.400]  The Merkel administration quickly moved to respond to the politically explosive close quote statement
[1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:11.400]  From Heidelberg, according to the German press agency, DPA, the Paul Ehrlich Institute announced that
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:15.400]  The scientific statements were incomprehensible
[1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:23.400]  The chancellor's lackey senior German immunologist, Thomas Mertens, dismissed the findings right away
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:28.400]  I don't know of any data that would allow a justifiable statement
[1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:31.400]  I want you to know about your hands then
[1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:35.400]  To be made where I'm not assuming an unreported number
[1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:38.400]  So what does that mean? I know nothing, I know nothing
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:41.400]  Gotta be in Hogan's heroes
[1:39:41.400 --> 1:39:47.400]  The pathologist, however, received support from his own ranks
[1:39:47.400 --> 1:39:56.400]  The Federal Association of German Pathologists stated that more autopsies of vaccinated people who died within a certain time frame
[1:39:56.400 --> 1:39:58.400]  Vaccination should be performed
[1:39:58.400 --> 1:40:01.400]  They went on to say they're seeing higher death rates from the vaccinated
[1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:09.400]  The head of the autopsy working group in the association wanted to make general practitioners and health authorities aware of this
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:11.400]  Oh, don't do that
[1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:22.400]  In other words, the doctors and the patients who died within a few days or weeks of the vaccination should apply for an autopsy in case of doubt
[1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:24.400]  They don't want surveillance of the death
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:27.400]  Hell, we've had reporters on it, we're told, don't cover the death
[1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:30.400]  And the health authorities they wanted to say should take action
[1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:42.400]  The Federal Association of Pathologists has already requested this in March in a letter to the health ministry, Jin's Spahn, of the CDU, but it went unanswered
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:46.400]  So they were in March saying, hey, we got a lot of deaths here, it looks like it's caused by this
[1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:51.400]  We need to really look at this, oh, meet silence because they don't want to admit their guilt
[1:40:51.400 --> 1:41:02.400]  Sure, Mocker's warning could be, of course, ruin a multi-digit long-term billion-dollar business for various pharmaceutical companies
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:09.400]  The scientists himself was already leading an autopsy project on people who have died from COVID-19, which is subsidized by the state
[1:41:09.400 --> 1:41:17.400]  He himself has expended and expanded the focus and also autopsy more than 40 deceased vaccinated people
[1:41:17.400 --> 1:41:26.400]  Even if his results are only a snapshot, it is a dramatic one of the 30-40% died from the vaccination itself
[1:41:26.400 --> 1:41:35.400]  The pathologist cited rare severe side effects of the vaccination such as cerebral vein thrombosis, which everyone else is saying
[1:41:35.400 --> 1:41:41.400]  Or autoimmune diseases, which is in the literature, what everyone is saying
[1:41:41.400 --> 1:41:47.400]  It's like if I hold up this phone and say what color it is, you know, it's black, everyone looks at it and goes, yeah, that's black
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:52.400]  Or what colors, it's like, what color is this cup, white? I mean, this is happening
[1:41:56.400 --> 1:42:02.400]  And it just goes on to say, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, those says there's no evidence, they don't give any evidence
[1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:06.400]  Oh, Paul Ehrlich, let me show you evidence, he wrote a book, How We Should Kill Everybody
[1:42:06.400 --> 1:42:11.400]  See right there? With John P. Holder
[1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:16.400]  So it's like, you know, somebody writes a book saying, let's go kill all the black people, and then black people are being killed
[1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:21.400]  And then the group goes, no blacks are being killed, it's like the very group saying it, see, I mean, this is ridiculous
[1:42:21.400 --> 1:42:25.400]  But the average person doesn't know that
[1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:31.400]  And it goes on to other reporting agencies showing similar death numbers, like the autopsies they're doing, they're like, what happened?
[1:42:31.400 --> 1:42:37.400]  The organs have been eaten, it's them, it's these jerks that came up with this
[1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:44.400]  Look at Ehrlich, look at your enemy, know who they are, it's funny to them, Nazis 2.0
[1:42:49.400 --> 1:42:54.400]  We'll be back with a final segment ahead of Sunday Live
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:43:02.400]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told
[1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:09.400]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:16.400]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions
[1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:19.400]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia
[1:43:19.400 --> 1:43:26.400]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system, the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye
[1:43:26.400 --> 1:43:33.400]  Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[1:43:33.400 --> 1:43:36.400]  And otherwise unseen dimensions of reality
[1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:41.400]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy
[1:43:41.400 --> 1:43:47.400]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:50.400]  And the propure shower head will seal the deal
[1:43:50.400 --> 1:43:56.400]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com
[1:43:56.400 --> 1:44:00.400]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021
[1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:04.400]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations
[1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:06.400]  All the tyranny we warned of is now here
[1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:11.400]  But on the good side there is also a global awakening the likes of which this planet has never seen
[1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:15.400]  So truly the battle between good and evil is now up front and center
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:19.400]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for your word of mouth
[1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:24.400]  For your prayers over the years because without info wars we'd be in a lot more trouble than we are right now
[1:44:24.400 --> 1:44:26.400]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air

[1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:38.400]  And in the surveillance state we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in
[1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:43.400]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings, they're available at infowarstore.com in four different colors
[1:45:43.400 --> 1:45:45.400]  And they are only $19.95
[1:45:45.400 --> 1:45:49.400]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:52.400]  They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the info war
[1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:56.400]  Please take action today, protect your privacy and fund the info war
[1:45:56.400 --> 1:46:00.400]  The biosecurity state is here
[1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:03.400]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation
[1:46:03.400 --> 1:46:06.400]  Training us that humans are dirty, bad and evil
[1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:09.400]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada
[1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:14.400]  Says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same
[1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:19.400]  Has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country
[1:46:19.400 --> 1:46:24.400]  All the way out into 2024 and then in 2024 you will again take two shots
[1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:28.400]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body
[1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:33.400]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation, they developed this whole plan with Bill Gates
[1:46:33.400 --> 1:46:38.400]  They're now implementing it and now they've announced that the US policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation
[1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:43.400]  Of course the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler
[1:46:43.400 --> 1:46:48.400]  And the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Institute in Germany
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:52.400]  The info wars will continue to set fast, they fight this, I don't know how long we can
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:55.400]  The enemy's coming for us all now, God bless and good luck
[1:46:55.400 --> 1:46:57.400]  I would again get right with God right now
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:03.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:16.400]  Welcome back to the final segment of the Alex Jones Show
[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:25.400]  A special Sunday Live coming up with the widower, the husband of Ashley Babbitt
[1:47:25.400 --> 1:47:29.400]  So look for that coming up here in about 13 minutes
[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:33.400]  When this hour ends, it's going to be Sunday Live tonight
[1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:36.400]  You'll want to definitely tune in for that
[1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:42.400]  And hopefully spread that link to your friends and family and neighbors because that's how we have victory
[1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:49.400]  Alright, I'm glad that the boom operator mentioned this to me because it's something I've forgotten to cover today
[1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:57.400]  When I said last week, I'm not hedging my bets because I was clear then that Obama, also known as Biden
[1:47:57.400 --> 1:48:03.400]  But Biden's his puppet, so that Freudian slip was actually real but I don't say Biden, I say Obama
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:18.400]  That when the president who stole it by Freud has his way, they are fully intending to never have real elections in this country again
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:22.400]  Now they're domestic security force of spies and contact tracers
[1:48:22.400 --> 1:48:29.400]  And they do have an emergency alert system thing for the 11th when Mike Lindell starts putting out his evidence of election fraud
[1:48:29.400 --> 1:48:34.400]  I'm not saying that's why they're doing it, and I'm not saying for sure Biden will do it then
[1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:40.400]  But maybe they're trying to find out who the leakers are, but they're in the White House meetings drawing up the plans
[1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:45.400]  And I just believe Jack Posubic has got great sources, I made some calls and said, yeah, we're being told
[1:48:45.400 --> 1:48:50.400]  Big national emergency announcement on the 11th or near to that
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:55.400]  And I said when I announced it last week, they may not do it, but definitely they're gearing up for it
[1:48:55.400 --> 1:48:57.400]  And they have this FEMA emergency alert
[1:48:57.400 --> 1:49:05.400]  So I'm going to be in Sioux Falls, South Dakota for the Mike Lindell event broadcasting live from there
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:09.400]  Because it is very important and he has a $5 million prize and they do have a lot of evidence
[1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:13.400]  So we're going to be there, so be sure to tune in this week for all of that
[1:49:13.400 --> 1:49:16.400]  But let's talk about this
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:21.400]  I got sent this by Eddie Bravo and I went and checked it, it's a true video
[1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:27.400]  And it's a lady asking, why are there dozens of websites, I probably can't play the whole long video
[1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:36.400]  She shows dozens of websites saying that there's 233 hospitalized from COVID in this country, in that country, in this country, in that country
[1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:42.400]  And it came out actually more than a decade ago, the CIA and private corporations have computer bots
[1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:48.400]  That you load in the info you once said that it rewrites, it puts a fake name on it and then repeats it
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:53.400]  The only problem is then it has trouble portioning the name out to each country
[1:49:53.400 --> 1:49:58.400]  So somebody's going to hand load that in, but they don't care
[1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:03.400]  Because they think you're dumb, they don't think you're in Indonesia, you're in Mexico, you're going to be reading the same newspaper
[1:50:03.400 --> 1:50:09.400]  But whether you're in Russia or whether you're in the US or wherever, they've got millions of fake news websites
[1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:20.400]  I mean it came out four years ago, five years ago in the last election, that Paramount Pictures and others spent hundreds of millions on fake sites
[1:50:20.400 --> 1:50:25.400]  And you see how you'll see the exact same tweet with different people's names on it, thousands of times
[1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:30.400]  Or you'll see the videos with dozens of nightly news reports all saying the exact same thing
[1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:38.400]  That's just an example of this, so people are thinking it's some Masonic 233 thing
[1:50:38.400 --> 1:50:45.400]  322 whatever, that's not what it is in my view, it's that it's a bot putting out the fake news
[1:50:45.400 --> 1:50:49.400]  But you can check it's not true on all these big sites because they don't want to hire humans anymore
[1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:52.400]  Because humans have to be managed, because humans ask questions
[1:50:52.400 --> 1:50:58.400]  So 233, is it a Masonic message? No, I'm not defending any corrupt Masons, I'm saying
[1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:06.400]  It's a bot that's loaded that doesn't care and thinks you're stupid and doesn't think you're looking at Australia versus Germany
[1:51:06.400 --> 1:51:09.400]  Here it is
[1:51:09.400 --> 1:51:18.400]  Can someone explain to me why this number is showing up in like 17 different articles from around the world?
[1:51:18.400 --> 1:51:25.400]  This is from Shukpartan News, Australia
[1:51:25.400 --> 1:51:27.400]  This is from Kentucky
[1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:35.400]  233
[1:51:35.400 --> 1:51:37.400]  Hawaii
[1:51:37.400 --> 1:51:45.400]  So you can gas like this all day, it's not going to work, people see this stuff
[1:51:45.400 --> 1:51:48.400]  Let's see
[1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:50.400]  Iowa
[1:51:50.400 --> 1:51:52.400]  That's just fake BS sweetheart
[1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:55.400]  From the Gazette, California News
[1:51:55.400 --> 1:51:58.400]  Good job though lady, we had a hard as a reporter
[1:51:58.400 --> 1:52:00.400]  233
[1:52:00.400 --> 1:52:02.400]  Tell me
[1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:05.400]  Idaho
[1:52:05.400 --> 1:52:08.400]  Idaho
[1:52:08.400 --> 1:52:11.400]  233 in Idaho
[1:52:11.400 --> 1:52:20.400]  Oregon
[1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:24.400]  Too lazy to even load a new number
[1:52:24.400 --> 1:52:27.400]  See the machines get that part wrong
[1:52:27.400 --> 1:52:30.400]  They'll work that out, don't worry
[1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:32.400]  Trinidad and Tobago
[1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:34.400]  Yep
[1:52:34.400 --> 1:52:36.400]  Lithuania
[1:52:36.400 --> 1:52:41.400]  233
[1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:46.400]  And she asked, is this a Masonic code word to attack that we're all clear? No
[1:52:46.400 --> 1:52:47.400]  Saskatchewan
[1:52:47.400 --> 1:52:49.400]  They do do that too
[1:52:49.400 --> 1:52:52.400]  No, this is a robot, this is fake news
[1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:54.400]  I looked up the country, it's not even true
[1:52:54.400 --> 1:52:56.400]  They just say that, they just load a machine
[1:52:56.400 --> 1:53:03.400]  They know you trust local news, so they've already bought them all off, they just hit them with this
[1:53:03.400 --> 1:53:06.400]  So you can see where the news is coming from
[1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:08.400]  Uh huh, okay
[1:53:08.400 --> 1:53:11.400]  West Virginia, 233
[1:53:11.400 --> 1:53:13.400]  This is in West Virginia
[1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:17.400]  Channel 5 WDTV with that nice eye right there
[1:53:17.400 --> 1:53:19.400]  Uh huh
[1:53:19.400 --> 1:53:21.400]  Okay
[1:53:21.400 --> 1:53:26.400]  Hit pause again, see I'm not saying it's a CIA, the first time I saw this like 10, 15 years ago was
[1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:35.400]  CIA has programs that write articles where you think humans are doing it but they put it out and then it's distributed around the world by the CIA's information warfare system and then
[1:53:35.400 --> 1:53:39.400]  But they're having problems with numbers and that's the thing is people see it
[1:53:39.400 --> 1:53:44.400]  So a lot of articles I see now that are put on local news, they're just told take your news feed
[1:53:44.400 --> 1:53:50.400]  Well the globalists don't want to have to tailor that, so they just say oh there's 233 cases and then it's all over the world
[1:53:50.400 --> 1:53:55.400]  They're always told that's in your town, that's in your city, that's just the number they put in when they wrote it
[1:53:55.400 --> 1:53:57.400]  And then it just repeats it out, it's very simple
[1:53:57.400 --> 1:54:00.400]  Go ahead and finish up
[1:54:00.400 --> 1:54:05.400]  Yeah, this is from there
[1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:07.400]  Asia Plus
[1:54:07.400 --> 1:54:10.400]  Okay, alright
[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:13.400]  Newsbreak
[1:54:13.400 --> 1:54:15.400]  Uh huh, okay
[1:54:15.400 --> 1:54:17.400]  In North Dakota
[1:54:17.400 --> 1:54:21.400]  Alright so we're out of time, she just goes on and on showing us all over the world
[1:54:21.400 --> 1:54:25.400]  This is the globalist fraud, you see it, I see it, but let's just pull back
[1:54:25.400 --> 1:54:29.400]  Fauci said two weeks ago, 99% of those ill and dying took the shot
[1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:33.400]  All the real numbers came out, Israel 95% dead and dying took the shot
[1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:36.400]  Australia's same news, that's the real number
[1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:40.400]  So real doctors reported, it just gets one newspaper, how do they counter that, they go
[1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:46.400]  Let's say 10,000 newspapers with BS and that's what they do
[1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:49.400]  And I've got family that was in South Africa on a cruise last year
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:55.400]  They got delivered at their door an article saying I was bad and fake news
[1:54:55.400 --> 1:54:58.400]  That's the level of this global information network
[1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:02.400]  Attacking those of us to tell the truth, it's put out everywhere
[1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:10.400]  Their answer to our truth is overwhelming us with just thousands of times the firepower
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:18.400]  But if you learn, if you don't recognize the person and you don't recognize the info and you don't know that source, don't believe a damn thing you hear
[1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:22.400]  Don't believe a word they say
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:26.400]  Alright, I got to about half the news I wanted to do tonight, we got a guest host coming up
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:33.400]  We got the lady murdered at the capitol's husband on, we're really sorry for what happened to her
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:41.400]  Ashley Babbitt, we're glad he's coming on, if your local station doesn't carry it, it should in FullWars.com
[1:55:41.400 --> 1:55:48.400]  I'll be back tomorrow absolutely ready to go 110%, I didn't get to all the clips of the CDC admitting
[1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:52.400]  You know what, let's play the CDC admitting, CDC had suddenly says vaccines don't protect you
[1:55:52.400 --> 1:55:58.400]  So again, you took it for no reason, they go oh it makes you a little safer, but the number shows it actually makes you sicker
[1:55:58.400 --> 1:56:04.400]  Let's play that clip going out, then tomorrow I'll get to all the clips, I didn't cover it 11am central, but here it is
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:11.400]  Made in our guidance, so yes they can with the Delta variant, and that was the reason that we changed our guidance last Tuesday
[1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:18.400]  Our vaccines are working exceptionally well, they continue to work well for Delta with regard to severe illness and death, they prevent it
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:22.400]  But what they can't do anymore is prevent transmission
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:29.400]  So if you're going home to somebody who has not been vaccinated, to somebody who can't get vaccinated, somebody who might be immunosuppressable
[1:56:29.400 --> 1:56:36.400]  So you're always dirty, you're always bad, you always gotta have more shots, we're in control, we promise you this will make you free, but it doesn't
[1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:45.400]  I mean this is just, you're seeing evil people, and our weakness and our compliance and our submission has manifested the worst people on earth
[1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:54.400]  It'll be whatever some dirty corporation wants for power and control, but you can overpower them, and remember resistance is victory, resistance is life
[1:56:54.400 --> 1:57:03.400]  Resistance is prosperity and joy, submission is death and enslavement and shame, and we've got to stop complying
[1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:11.400]  They're trying to bring in the world government and the world ID and the forced inoculation and the depopulation and the people running it admit they want to kill you
[1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:15.400]  And the main German doctor group says it's killing people
[1:57:15.400 --> 1:57:22.400]  So let's not just stop these shots, let's take our countries back and let's prosecute Bill Gates and Fauci and all the other criminals
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:30.400]  And Trump, back in these shots, he was ignorant then, he's not ignorant now, he better get on the right side of history, or Donald Trump is going to become our enemy
[1:57:30.400 --> 1:57:37.400]  Alright, that's it for this hour, Sunday Live, coming up now at band.video and infowars.com
[1:57:37.400 --> 1:57:44.400]  Whatever you do, share those links, it's a revolutionary act, thank you all and God bless you, thanks to the crew as well
