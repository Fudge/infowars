[00:00.000 --> 00:06.900]  Alright, folks, we're live. It's Thursday, the 28th of January. I'm cutting into the
[00:06.900 --> 00:11.920]  intro transmission. It's so important. Alex Jones here. We've got Ron Paul, the former
[00:11.920 --> 00:16.400]  congressman on the Martial Law War Powers Act that even a Democratic senator has said
[00:16.400 --> 00:20.960]  it is coming on in about two hours. We're behind the scenes talking to the Trump people
[00:20.960 --> 00:24.080]  right now about things that are happening with the debates tonight. I'll give you the
[00:24.080 --> 00:28.960]  inside baseball after the break. But first here is John Bounds report. Anna reporters
[00:28.960 --> 00:32.560]  are in Oregon right now with huge developments as well. Stay with us.
[00:32.560 --> 00:37.720]  Now that the Bill of Rights have been largely destroyed by our corporatized government,
[00:37.720 --> 00:43.040]  President Obama has decided to go for the meat of the American Constitution. The war powers
[00:43.040 --> 00:50.960]  of the Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 of the United States Constitution
[00:50.960 --> 00:58.880]  sometimes referred to as the War Powers Clause vests in the Congress the power to declare
[00:58.880 --> 01:06.920]  war. This resolution is a total rewrite of the War Powers Clause of the United States
[01:06.920 --> 01:13.920]  Constitution. Let's be clear about that. It is essentially a declaration of international
[01:13.920 --> 01:21.160]  martial law, a sweeping transfer of military power to the president that will allow him
[01:21.160 --> 01:29.680]  or her to send U.S. troops almost anywhere in the world for almost any reason with absolutely
[01:29.680 --> 01:34.160]  no limitations. So while the East Coast was buried under
[01:34.160 --> 01:40.280]  record snowfall, Obama's full Republican minions Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell scuttled
[01:40.280 --> 01:47.520]  another dangerous fast-track bill into the halls of the most hated Congress in U.S. history.
[01:47.520 --> 01:52.520]  The legislation makes the Unconstitutional Iraq War authorization of 2002 look like a
[01:52.520 --> 01:57.960]  walk in the park. It will allow this president and future presidents to wage war against
[01:57.960 --> 02:03.760]  ISIS without restrictions on time, geographic scope or the use of ground troops. It is a
[02:03.760 --> 02:09.040]  completely open-ended authorization for the president to use the military as he wishes
[02:09.040 --> 02:15.320]  for as long as he or she wishes. Even President Obama has expressed concern over how willing
[02:15.320 --> 02:19.640]  Congress is to hand him unlimited power to wage war.
[02:19.640 --> 02:25.640]  The Forum Relations Committee, whose chair, Senator Bob Corker, suggested that a new authorization
[02:25.640 --> 02:31.680]  for use of military force was unlikely to happen and that President Obama currently has the
[02:31.680 --> 02:39.880]  legal authority he needs. Corker's authority was bypassed by McConnell's treasonous fast-track.
[02:39.880 --> 02:44.240]  And Senator Lindsey Graham bleated out to reporters, if the Democrats don't want to
[02:44.240 --> 02:49.440]  give this to Obama, then stand up and tell me why. There may be some people running for
[02:49.440 --> 02:54.840]  president as Republicans who don't want this. I would be astonished that anybody seeking
[02:54.840 --> 03:00.080]  to be commander in chief wouldn't want this power. It would allow the administration to
[03:00.080 --> 03:07.200]  fight the terror group ISIS wherever, whenever and however, as if the real threat of ISIS
[03:07.200 --> 03:12.240]  was a mystery to the American people. Most Americans are fully aware that our greatest
[03:12.240 --> 03:18.600]  threat lies in Obama's policies regarding immigration. The bill isn't even warm yet.
[03:18.600 --> 03:24.360]  And Vice President Joe Biden is in Turkey cheerleading World War III, presenting both
[03:24.360 --> 03:28.240]  sides of the issue to Turkey and the American people.
[03:28.240 --> 03:33.600]  Our allies in the region were our largest problem in Syria. The Turks were great friends
[03:33.600 --> 03:37.800]  and I have a great relationship with Erdogan, which I've just spent a lot of time with.
[03:37.800 --> 03:44.840]  They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens, thousands of tons of weapons into
[03:44.840 --> 03:53.200]  anyone who would fight against Assad, except that the people who were being supplied were
[03:53.200 --> 04:00.400]  Al Nusra and Al Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the
[04:00.400 --> 04:02.280]  world.
[04:02.280 --> 04:07.800]  Following World War II, the United States leadership has continually sought to foment
[04:07.800 --> 04:14.080]  and drive the industrial military complex machine into an unending unconstitutional state of
[04:14.080 --> 04:21.400]  global war, creating the very enemies Obama's dictatorial powers would seek to suppress.
[04:21.400 --> 04:26.400]  We have finally reached the precipice of the total annihilation of the balance of powers
[04:26.400 --> 04:29.960]  that act as the foundation of our republic.
[04:29.960 --> 04:35.600]  Let's not get involved in constitutional arguments.
[04:35.600 --> 04:40.520]  President Obama is desperately attempting to disarm the public and re-engineer the United
[04:40.520 --> 04:48.000]  States into a lawless military state overseen by corrupt politicians on par with the horror
[04:48.000 --> 04:59.240]  south of our border, John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[04:59.240 --> 05:04.080]  The Bernie Sanders campaign is so suspicious of Microsoft's influence in the Iowa caucus
[05:04.080 --> 05:07.920]  that they've built an independent system to check the official results.
[05:07.920 --> 05:13.160]  For the first time this year, Microsoft partnered with the Iowa Democratic and Republican parties
[05:13.160 --> 05:18.280]  to provide a technology platform which officials at hundreds of caucuses across the state will
[05:18.280 --> 05:23.440]  use to report results from individual precincts to party headquarters for tabulation.
[05:23.440 --> 05:27.800]  The arrangement has raised eyebrows of aides to Sanders who regularly warn that corporate
[05:27.800 --> 05:31.680]  power in the billionaire class are trying to hijack democracy.
[05:31.680 --> 05:36.960]  Sanders' Iowa campaign manager questioned Microsoft's motives in an interview with MSNBC
[05:36.960 --> 05:41.600]  saying you'd have to ask yourself why they'd want to give something like that away for
[05:41.600 --> 05:42.600]  free.
[05:42.600 --> 05:47.920]  But the same question could be asked of a presidential candidate promising so many freebies.
[05:47.920 --> 05:51.960]  Be sure to tune in to Infowars.com, we'll be bringing you up-to-date coverage on the
[05:51.960 --> 05:53.440]  ground from Iowa.

[06:13.680 --> 06:38.240]  We'll see you in the next one.
[06:38.240 --> 06:57.280]  We'll see you in the next one.
[07:08.240 --> 07:34.280]  We'll see you in the next one.
[07:34.280 --> 07:39.400]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary

[07:57.400 --> 08:04.400]  We'll see you in the next one.
[08:27.400 --> 08:49.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, the 28th of January, 2016.
[08:49.680 --> 08:53.760]  Really hard to believe that the first month of 2016 is almost bye-bye.
[08:53.760 --> 08:54.760]  Wow!
[08:54.760 --> 08:59.320]  Total information overload, again, I pledge today to go over all this news.
[08:59.320 --> 09:02.240]  I will cover all 200-plus articles.
[09:02.240 --> 09:04.360]  I will get to all five guests.
[09:04.360 --> 09:08.520]  I will, I will, I will, or die trying.
[09:08.520 --> 09:12.360]  We have Harry Dent, who's predicted exactly what's happening with the economy with the
[09:12.360 --> 09:16.400]  last few years with stunning precision, popping in for 30 minutes.
[09:16.400 --> 09:22.200]  David Knight and Joe Biggs from Oregon, where we've got one dead, another was grazed, and
[09:22.200 --> 09:27.400]  now Aiman Bundy has told the folks inside the Wildlife Refuge, please come out, please,
[09:27.400 --> 09:28.960]  you know, give up.
[09:28.960 --> 09:31.280]  And they're saying that they may not charge you.
[09:31.280 --> 09:35.560]  There's a seven-mile perimeter around it, and our crew is approaching that perimeter
[09:35.560 --> 09:36.560]  right now.
[09:36.560 --> 09:41.360]  They got in last night, they've now been driving out of the rural area from Portland since
[09:41.360 --> 09:43.640]  they got in last night, Joe Biggs.
[09:43.640 --> 09:51.520]  And of course, David Knight, former Congressman Ron Paul, is coming on about the huge developments
[09:51.520 --> 09:56.280]  with the unprecedented authorization for military force that is a complete rewrite of the War
[09:56.280 --> 10:02.880]  Powers Act, transferring power from Congress to the presidency for 360 total war with boots
[10:02.880 --> 10:05.240]  on the ground anywhere in the world.
[10:05.240 --> 10:10.480]  No one has ever had a declaration like this, not even Julius Caesar or Adolf Hitler.
[10:10.480 --> 10:11.480]  It is wild.
[10:11.480 --> 10:14.360]  And folks go, well, it probably won't pass.
[10:14.360 --> 10:23.000]  This was written by the leader of the Senate and is sailing through right now, just incredible.
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.080]  It doesn't mean actual martial law is coming.
[10:26.080 --> 10:28.400]  They're just putting it on paper to do whatever they want.
[10:28.400 --> 10:29.400]  It's crazy.
[10:29.400 --> 10:34.280]  By the way, the Pentagon just announced yesterday, last night, we're staying in Afghanistan
[10:34.280 --> 10:35.920]  another decade.
[10:35.920 --> 10:40.720]  They promised eight years ago they'd be out within two years, then they promised another
[10:40.720 --> 10:41.720]  year.
[10:41.720 --> 10:43.240]  I mean, now they just say, no, we're not leaving.
[10:43.240 --> 10:45.720]  Oh, by the way, we're going back into Iraq.
[10:45.720 --> 10:50.520]  And there's not even discussion of it because that's where all this is going as the nation
[10:50.520 --> 10:53.240]  goes bankrupt.
[10:53.240 --> 10:57.240]  And then Richard Reeves from Iowa, we got contacted by the Trump folks.
[10:57.240 --> 11:01.440]  They're so nice and said, hey, we're doing this wounded warrior thing last night.
[11:01.440 --> 11:05.360]  And we were serious about trying to raise them millions of dollars when Trump first
[11:05.360 --> 11:11.480]  said, hey, if I go on Fox, we're staying in, you guys ought to donate the extra money because
[11:11.480 --> 11:15.600]  they admit instead of making $5, $10 million on the debate, they may make $20 million instead
[11:15.600 --> 11:17.200]  of $100,000 a minute.
[11:17.200 --> 11:20.280]  They get up towards of a million dollars a minute.
[11:20.280 --> 11:24.480]  Fox is selling it for $700 plus thousand dollars a minute until Trump dropped out.
[11:24.480 --> 11:28.640]  Now it's gone down like 150,000, despite all the nationwide hype.
[11:28.640 --> 11:29.760]  And so he says, I don't want any money.
[11:29.760 --> 11:34.840]  I wanted to go to veterans and the media lies and says that dirty, greedy scoundrel.
[11:34.840 --> 11:35.840]  Remember this?
[11:35.840 --> 11:38.320]  A few months ago, he just wants the money for himself.
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.960]  He wants it until we played the full video here and others did.
[11:42.960 --> 11:44.960]  That's how they deceive.
[11:44.960 --> 11:46.160]  And so he's brought that up.
[11:46.160 --> 11:47.760]  He said, I don't like Megan Kelly.
[11:47.760 --> 11:49.160]  She's disingenuous.
[11:49.160 --> 11:50.160]  She makes stuff up.
[11:50.160 --> 11:53.200]  They want to set me up and have everybody attack me in a rig deal.
[11:53.200 --> 11:58.560]  I'm going to go over here and I'm going to run a feed and we're going to raise money,
[11:58.560 --> 12:02.120]  forget advertising directly for the veterans.
[12:02.120 --> 12:05.440]  And he's saying, seeing in, you can carry it, but you better give money to the wounded
[12:05.440 --> 12:13.320]  warriors and the media is calling it despicable.
[12:13.320 --> 12:18.200]  Talk to Mr. Stone this morning, one of the main advisors to Trump, and he is going to
[12:18.200 --> 12:21.320]  be on Fox News, Megan Kelly tonight.
[12:21.320 --> 12:22.400]  He's in New York.
[12:22.400 --> 12:23.400]  We're working on it.
[12:23.400 --> 12:27.280]  We'll probably be able to get him on today during the fourth hour of Anthony Uchiarty
[12:27.280 --> 12:33.920]  popping in and on our live coverage that starts from seven o'clock and runs past 10 o'clock
[12:33.920 --> 12:34.920]  tonight.
[12:34.920 --> 12:36.440]  We're going to be here this evening.
[12:36.440 --> 12:43.400]  David Knight normally is the central anchor with Jacari and Leigh Ann and of course, McBreen.
[12:43.400 --> 12:46.920]  So the reporters can run back and forth and track things as they unfold.
[12:46.920 --> 12:51.000]  But because Knight is going to be in Oregon, he'll also be on with us tonight.
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.560]  We are going to, of course, covering it live from here in Austin, Texas with Richard Reeves
[12:56.560 --> 13:01.920]  in Iowa with our own feed with the Trump folks inviting Richard over to run our own
[13:01.920 --> 13:05.320]  in-force feed out of there, knowing CNN will probably try to come over and stop us or something.
[13:05.320 --> 13:10.040]  But notice CNN says they're going to be taking Trump's feed and then commenting on it.
[13:10.040 --> 13:16.200]  Oh, what we do, taking CNN and Fox's feed and MSNBC's feed and commenting on it, see,
[13:16.200 --> 13:18.800]  we do our own feed and then they comment on us.
[13:18.800 --> 13:25.400]  This is what you talk about when you deal with the fall of the mainstream media.
[13:25.400 --> 13:29.680]  Because now the debates aren't about them, it isn't about who they knight, who they
[13:29.680 --> 13:32.360]  king make, who they say the leader is.
[13:32.360 --> 13:36.160]  It's about who the people tune into and what the people think.
[13:36.160 --> 13:39.880]  So it's the democratization of the media.
[13:39.880 --> 13:46.520]  I'm a Republican, not Republican Party, Republican, when it comes to the congressional system,
[13:46.520 --> 13:52.160]  our federalist system, our Americana system, we're a republic, not a democracy.
[13:52.160 --> 13:58.480]  But it is a representative, small D democracy in that there is democratization through the
[13:58.480 --> 14:03.080]  filter of separation of powers, state and federal government, three levels of government
[14:03.080 --> 14:11.200]  per state and federal for a separation of power system to try to stop centralized dictatorships
[14:11.200 --> 14:12.600]  from being formed.
[14:12.600 --> 14:15.040]  Well, it's the same thing with the media.
[14:15.040 --> 14:18.440]  We're now seeing the democratization of it because the mainstream media stopped doing
[14:18.440 --> 14:26.400]  its job, got so openly deceptive, so openly arrogant, so openly imperialist that the people
[14:26.400 --> 14:29.680]  have now turned against them big time.
[14:29.680 --> 14:34.840]  Obviously, I didn't cover the Megyn Kelly situation much the last few days.
[14:34.840 --> 14:38.320]  We talked about it some here, but maybe 5% of our coverage today.
[14:38.320 --> 14:43.360]  I'll be talking maybe 20% about it because it is really important through the lens of
[14:43.360 --> 14:49.280]  Fox and through the lens of what Trump's doing, you see the disintegration of the mainstream
[14:49.280 --> 14:51.520]  media stranglehold.
[14:51.520 --> 14:56.360]  So it's very, very informative to look at what's happening and to look at technological
[14:56.360 --> 15:01.800]  developments that we have now to be able to challenge the dinosaur media, even if they
[15:01.800 --> 15:06.280]  have 50 times, 100 times the funding that we have.
[15:06.280 --> 15:10.760]  I can just turn on an iPhone, shoot a video live to YouTube or Facebook, and the average
[15:10.760 --> 15:17.000]  video gets around a million views, 10 o'clock at night on a Saturday, 7 o'clock in the morning
[15:17.000 --> 15:24.600]  on a Sunday, 3 o'clock in the afternoon on a Sunday, dominating, dominating, dominating.
[15:24.600 --> 15:29.920]  You know how much it freaks out Fox News and CNN that they've got to spend massive amounts
[15:29.920 --> 15:35.960]  of money in advertising and propaganda and decades of investment and talking heads and
[15:35.960 --> 15:42.600]  screenwriters and teleprompters and just, you know, $400, $500 million a year budgets
[15:42.600 --> 15:49.440]  and they can't get, but 200,000 viewers on the average MSNBC show, CNN's about the same.
[15:49.440 --> 15:54.960]  Fox, top shows, 3 million, 4 million, lower level shows, a million, they're declining
[15:54.960 --> 16:02.160]  as well, but they still have big audiences when it comes to a debate and to see Trump
[16:02.160 --> 16:06.640]  say, you know what, I'm going to do my own thing and I bet you, if you add up the YouTube,
[16:06.640 --> 16:12.440]  the live streams, the U streams, Trump's own feeds, CNN picking it up, everyone else covering
[16:12.440 --> 16:15.760]  what's happening, that people aren't going to be able to stand it.
[16:15.760 --> 16:19.480]  They're not going to watch the Fox debate.
[16:19.480 --> 16:28.120]  I predict it's going to have less viewers than the Donald Trump coverage if you add together
[16:28.120 --> 16:34.120]  the different feeds, our feed, CNN, his feed, the wounded warrior program and others.
[16:34.120 --> 16:41.800]  This is beautiful and we'll be here at infowars.com tonight, 7 o'clock and on, breaking every
[16:41.800 --> 16:43.600]  stinking facet of us down.
[16:43.600 --> 16:48.240]  We'll be analyzing CNN, we'll be analyzing Fox, we'll be, because you know, CNN is going
[16:48.240 --> 16:53.080]  to be cutting in with comments and stuff and trying to hijack it.
[16:53.080 --> 16:57.520]  And we're going to be here hijacking them, breaking down exactly what they're doing
[16:57.520 --> 17:03.400]  with commentary and live analysis with the young Turks and with Glenn Beck and everybody
[17:03.400 --> 17:08.480]  else following suit now, copying what we do, covering the debates, the state of the unions
[17:08.480 --> 17:13.440]  and others with analysis, because that's what it's all about, documenting what the
[17:13.440 --> 17:20.120]  trader media is doing, but what a stroke of genius by Donald Trump to come on this show
[17:20.120 --> 17:25.040]  and thumb it in their faces, hoping they'd attack him for coming on the show.
[17:25.040 --> 17:29.520]  They did it for one day and then zero coverage because it blew up in their face again.
[17:29.520 --> 17:34.040]  I mean, you don't think Trump didn't know that was what was happening?
[17:34.040 --> 17:38.240]  And then of course, Trump leaving the debate, knowing he'd be demonized more.
[17:38.240 --> 17:42.400]  You didn't think he knew what he was doing, but they're so arrogant.
[17:42.400 --> 17:48.160]  They still haven't figured out the only way to discredit Alex Jones or Matt Drudge or
[17:48.160 --> 17:53.080]  Joseph Farah or Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin.
[17:53.080 --> 17:57.160]  I mean, anybody they hate, I'm not saying we're all good, bad or perfect or whatever.
[17:57.160 --> 18:02.960]  The only way they could defeat Rush Limbaugh would be to embrace him and endorse him.
[18:02.960 --> 18:05.880]  Like when Rand Paul started getting embraced by the establishment, he went from number
[18:05.880 --> 18:12.120]  one six months ago to now like number eight and I told him off record and I told Politico
[18:12.120 --> 18:18.680]  on record when he got elected to the Kentucky Senate for the federal Senate out of Kentucky.
[18:18.680 --> 18:22.760]  I said, the only thing you got to worry about is you're such a gentleman, I know you won't
[18:22.760 --> 18:23.760]  sell us out.
[18:23.760 --> 18:31.560]  I know you're not going to compromise in deeds, but I said, do not compromise in rhetoric
[18:31.560 --> 18:32.640]  and Rand Paul has done that.
[18:32.640 --> 18:39.320]  He's come out and said that the good riddance to Donald Trump, that's like, you know, declaring
[18:39.320 --> 18:42.840]  that Mark Twain was dead 20 years before he died.
[18:42.840 --> 18:46.880]  He said rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[18:46.880 --> 18:47.880]  This is something people do.
[18:47.880 --> 18:49.440]  I see it a lot in media and culture.
[18:49.440 --> 18:51.760]  They announced someone's over.
[18:51.760 --> 18:53.560]  They announced someone's bankrupt.
[18:53.560 --> 18:56.280]  They announced someone's defeated when they're not.
[18:56.280 --> 18:58.840]  And that used to work when the mainstream media had control.
[18:58.840 --> 18:59.840]  They don't anymore.
[18:59.840 --> 19:01.680]  They're constantly announcing that we're done.
[19:01.680 --> 19:05.600]  They're constantly announcing drudge as it has been every day when his numbers just go
[19:05.600 --> 19:09.160]  up and up and up.
[19:09.160 --> 19:12.160]  This is what they engage in.
[19:12.160 --> 19:13.160]  This is how they operate.
[19:13.160 --> 19:17.600]  It's like when the creator of the X-Files came out, Chris Carter had set his base mainly
[19:17.600 --> 19:20.640]  on Alex Jones and him for worse work than his season.
[19:20.640 --> 19:22.800]  The trolls came out and said, Jones is crazy.
[19:22.800 --> 19:28.840]  Even in some news articles, he's claiming it's based on him.
[19:28.840 --> 19:32.320]  I knew Chris Carter was a listener 10 years ago and one of the stars of the show came
[19:32.320 --> 19:35.320]  and visited me at my house.
[19:35.320 --> 19:39.360]  But I didn't even say it really on air then because it just sounded pompous.
[19:39.360 --> 19:43.160]  I know we've been affecting culture since I started out 21 years ago.
[19:43.160 --> 19:46.440]  But it isn't about the fact, oh, I affected culture, aren't I big?
[19:46.440 --> 19:51.440]  It's that we are dominating and taking the media power away from these people.
[19:51.440 --> 19:55.200]  Like they're Grendel, we're Beowulf, they're trying to get out the door and we got them
[19:55.200 --> 19:56.200]  by the arm.
[19:56.200 --> 19:57.720]  We're pulling it out of the socket.
[19:57.720 --> 19:59.440]  I feel it coming out right now.
[19:59.440 --> 20:02.920]  Winter has just begun and are you already tired of being cold?
[20:02.920 --> 20:05.360]  How would you like to never be cold again?
[20:05.360 --> 20:10.160]  This is Dale with Fortress Clothing and I'm here to tell you, you will never be cold

[20:58.520 --> 21:02.800]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[21:02.800 --> 21:07.520]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[21:07.520 --> 21:10.000]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.680]  But with a trusted big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[21:14.680 --> 21:21.560]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,

[21:57.760 --> 22:00.840]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinewetz.
[22:00.840 --> 22:03.440]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[22:03.440 --> 22:06.360]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic
[22:06.360 --> 22:07.360]  pickpocketing.
[22:07.360 --> 22:10.760]  Ten years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government
[22:10.760 --> 22:14.720]  officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip
[22:14.720 --> 22:15.720]  called RFID.
[22:15.720 --> 22:20.400]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[22:20.400 --> 22:24.680]  Soon after it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, US passports, hotel room
[22:24.680 --> 22:28.760]  keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[22:28.760 --> 22:32.560]  It was then I formed ID Stronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with
[22:32.560 --> 22:33.560]  the world.
[22:33.560 --> 22:36.760]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[22:36.760 --> 22:40.040]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[22:40.040 --> 22:44.240]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you
[22:44.240 --> 22:46.440]  need to protect your personal financial data.
[22:46.440 --> 22:50.160]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more
[22:50.160 --> 22:52.240]  than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[22:52.240 --> 22:55.160]  It is as though the protection is free.
[22:55.160 --> 22:58.440]  Visit idstronghold.com today.
[22:58.440 --> 23:01.200]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[23:01.200 --> 23:06.080]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.
[23:06.080 --> 23:09.360]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[23:09.360 --> 23:13.160]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks and
[23:13.160 --> 23:14.800]  head-to-head fitness tests.
[23:14.800 --> 23:16.440]  How is this even possible?
[23:16.440 --> 23:20.880]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated
[23:20.880 --> 23:24.120]  fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[23:24.120 --> 23:27.520]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made
[23:27.520 --> 23:31.520]  their achy joints, stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[23:31.520 --> 23:36.040]  Previously this drink was only available to elite military units, but for a limited time
[23:36.040 --> 23:41.080]  the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically
[23:41.080 --> 23:42.800]  for our conservative friends.
[23:42.800 --> 23:45.920]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[23:45.920 --> 23:51.760]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens go to green75.com.
[23:51.760 --> 23:53.920]  That's green75.com.
[23:53.920 --> 23:55.920]  Greens75.com.
[23:55.920 --> 24:09.040]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen I'm Alex Jones your host we have a raft of guests
[24:09.040 --> 24:12.680]  joining us today obviously we'll be back tonight seven o'clock central here's how you listen
[24:12.680 --> 24:14.920]  or watch.
[24:14.920 --> 24:20.160]  Many of our radio affiliates I never thought of this are now picking up the nightly news
[24:20.160 --> 24:25.680]  every night at seven o'clock and then running their ads obviously over our ads that's mine.
[24:25.680 --> 24:32.040]  We seem to kind of create a contract on that so folks know where we stand but quite frankly
[24:32.040 --> 24:37.320]  I don't even care I mean I'd say nightly news go ahead and you know carry it and run ads
[24:37.320 --> 24:40.360]  over every block of ads we've got.
[24:40.360 --> 24:46.160]  The contract we've got for TV and VHF, UHF and cable stations is we get like 20% of
[24:46.160 --> 24:50.720]  the ads and it's not very ad heavy but we want the money to go to the local affiliates
[24:50.720 --> 24:55.400]  because we know you know how bad the economy is we just want to get the word out and then
[24:55.400 --> 25:00.600]  we sprinkle obviously some advertising into the show to be able to finance ourselves.
[25:00.600 --> 25:09.040]  But infowars.com forward slash show we'll have the feed that we produce here that is
[25:09.040 --> 25:14.920]  a feed of CNN a feed from Trump a feed of our reporters on the ground a feed of our
[25:14.920 --> 25:21.440]  reporters in Iowa our reporters in Oregon with the ongoing standoffs just all mixed together
[25:21.440 --> 25:26.720]  that's the super feed the nightly news debate coverage feed.
[25:26.720 --> 25:30.240]  And then you'll have the feed from this four hour show that a lot of people want to watch
[25:30.240 --> 25:34.920]  that's restreaming when it ends at three o'clock that'll be a separate feed of the day show
[25:34.920 --> 25:41.120]  and then another YouTube backup feed where we run our nightly news feed over YouTube
[25:41.120 --> 25:46.080]  in live time and that's more important than ever I hope folks start using it because the
[25:46.080 --> 25:50.720]  bandwidth charges when you get 16 million people in a month tuning in to just one of
[25:50.720 --> 25:54.920]  our video feeds that's been a small part of our audience that feed but it's just growing
[25:54.920 --> 25:59.920]  and growing we're 16 million times people log in and watch it they watch like 20 something
[25:59.920 --> 26:03.440]  minutes on average a piece just the bandwidth costs are incredible.
[26:03.440 --> 26:10.280]  So we obviously would love to do a Facebook mentions and send out a three hour show four
[26:10.280 --> 26:15.320]  hour show but they're in their contract it says you basically can't do that YouTube lets
[26:15.320 --> 26:20.680]  us do it so we're going to email out that feed to info wars live Republican debate coverage
[26:20.680 --> 26:26.280]  when you probably to add in the headline copy this link and share it because folks send
[26:26.280 --> 26:30.640]  us constant emails what's this feed I don't see the debate yet the general public out
[26:30.640 --> 26:35.560]  there literally doesn't think well it's a link to the live show needs to be save this live
[26:35.560 --> 26:43.280]  link for the debate and coverage and then we're going to email that out to everybody
[26:43.280 --> 26:48.400]  in multiple emails today for folks that are signed up for the free newsletter at info wars
[26:48.400 --> 26:53.680]  dot com forward slash newsletter you can obviously go to info wars dot com forward slash show
[26:53.680 --> 26:59.120]  and find the free links to all of the different feeds and also the free video cast the podcast
[26:59.120 --> 27:04.280]  all of it for the daytime show if you're a subscriber generally the nightly news at prison

[27:09.160 --> 27:13.920]  special events like the debates and of course the daytime radio slash TV show that you're
[27:13.920 --> 27:19.680]  watching and listening to right now is obviously free as well 24 seven not just when it's live
[27:19.680 --> 27:26.600]  six days a week when we put out shows at info wars dot com forward slash show and I spent
[27:26.600 --> 27:30.280]  some time on that today because we get so many emails so many comments how do I find
[27:30.280 --> 27:38.600]  it last debate a few weeks ago I was at home doing it via video Skype into the studio and
[27:38.600 --> 27:48.000]  I got five text messages from friends within 30 seconds of seven o'clock coming around
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.880]  because they were looking around for the feed of the live nightly news and they were finding
[27:53.880 --> 28:00.600]  the feed of this show that was already over and so these are smart friends and family
[28:00.600 --> 28:04.080]  they just didn't know to go click the top link and you know find the sub feed right there
[28:04.080 --> 28:09.060]  so it's all about making it easy for people making it easy for folks to find it labeling
[28:09.060 --> 28:14.880]  the names right making it clear to people and it's up to you if you want to further help
[28:14.880 --> 28:19.920]  devastate mainstream media further help rip their arms out of their sockets we've had
[28:19.920 --> 28:25.280]  debate coverage before an election coverage before that had three million viewers just
[28:25.280 --> 28:31.320]  on YouTube and our stream in 24 hours now again we have three four five million people
[28:31.320 --> 28:35.480]  a day on terrestrial radio internet feeds video the rest of it but that's taken us years
[28:35.480 --> 28:40.400]  to build up that that audience every day to be able to just a few times a year have a
[28:40.400 --> 28:46.520]  live feed and have three million people tune in is CNN level and beyond it's approaching
[28:46.520 --> 28:53.440]  Fox News and that's why they pay attention and so it shows how the Patriots folks exposing
[28:53.440 --> 29:00.120]  Bilderberg group the vaccines the Zika virus other population control operations electronic
[29:00.120 --> 29:08.320]  hacking of elections all of it we're here hardcore for real getting into the top contending
[29:08.320 --> 29:12.840]  heavyweight championship big leagues I mean we're getting to the point where we're going
[29:12.840 --> 29:16.560]  we're on the field with Goliath we're getting to the point where we're going to take Goliath
[29:16.560 --> 29:21.600]  politically out folks Goliath is scared he's already bloody we just got to chop his head
[29:21.600 --> 29:25.840]  off he's already on the ground we're just an amazement that he's been knocked out we
[29:25.840 --> 29:30.600]  got to finish the deed before he gets back up we got to go in there and just fully discredit
[29:30.600 --> 29:34.360]  these people savage them with the truth and hit them where it hurts and that's in the
[29:34.360 --> 29:38.960]  ratings and take their lusters and viewers and we do that by you emailing and posting

[29:50.240 --> 30:02.800]  on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network US scientists have urged the world health organization
[30:02.800 --> 30:09.360]  to take urgent action over the Zika virus which they say has explosive pandemic potential
[30:09.360 --> 30:14.560]  Zika is linked to shrunken brains and children and it's causing panic in Brazil where thousands
[30:14.560 --> 30:18.920]  of people have already been infected some countries are urging women of childbearing
[30:18.920 --> 30:23.960]  age to wait until more is known about the virus to become pregnant microcephaly can
[30:23.960 --> 30:29.720]  cause brain damage in babies or even death health officials said 23 countries are affected
[30:29.720 --> 30:34.440]  by mosquitoes that are spreading the virus locally while some people are transporting
[30:34.440 --> 30:40.960]  the virus after traveling to affected countries the CDC said the US has 31 confirmed cases
[30:40.960 --> 30:48.480]  in 11 states and DC there is no cure for Zika for now officials urge wearing mosquito repellent

[34:09.960 --> 34:14.600]  demo has a more detailed article info wars dot com in my view that actually goes into
[34:14.600 --> 34:19.560]  the background of this because microsoft is at the top of the pyramid of shadow government
[34:19.560 --> 34:23.960]  i'm going to give you the rest of the story here in a moment but sanders camp suspicious
[34:23.960 --> 34:28.540]  of microsoft influence in iowa caucuses here's the info wars headline sanders campaign worried

[34:40.360 --> 34:46.280]  it's hard to tweet and while you talk on air so they they just take the transcripts constantly
[34:46.280 --> 34:53.160]  i would shoot this out and just basically say sanders is worried about microsoft hacking
[34:53.160 --> 34:58.280]  iowa caucuses i mean that's what it is when you cheat something it's a hack people think
[34:58.280 --> 35:06.680]  it's always breaking in know it's also engaging in a fraud using computers period and microsoft
[35:06.680 --> 35:10.840]  is probably one of the most evil companies in history after i bm i'm going to talk about
[35:10.840 --> 35:16.960]  that in a moment and absolutely that's why you see such weird results in iowa famously
[35:16.960 --> 35:22.440]  is there's been so much uh... black box manipulation they've caught hackers getting in i mean they
[35:22.440 --> 35:35.920]  caught diaboled it's admitted that jfk stole chicago illinois to win the presidency in 1961
[35:35.920 --> 35:40.240]  it's known that lbj stole his first congressional seat in texas that was a stuff in the ballot
[35:40.240 --> 35:47.560]  box it's it's well established there's a lot of hanky panky but it's still kind of geographical
[35:47.560 --> 35:51.160]  because of there's a huge landslide for a candidate i've had many of the top experts
[35:51.160 --> 35:56.480]  on it's hard for them to steal it but if it's close they can steal them and not get caught
[35:56.480 --> 36:00.240]  with the manipulation so we'll break that down in a moment uh... every day i get four
[36:00.240 --> 36:05.480]  or five new videos i mentioned that we don't even get to now uh... of just migrants attack
[36:05.480 --> 36:11.440]  residents throw bricks beat them uh... that just france is collapsing even mainstream
[36:11.440 --> 36:15.680]  news there admits that their roads are now collapsing with the illegals running around
[36:15.680 --> 36:20.840]  raping and robbing and carjacking everything and the french just roll over if they fight
[36:20.840 --> 36:26.360]  back they get arrested uh... this is like some weird socialist france revolution part
[36:26.360 --> 36:36.160]  two part do using islamics i mean it's it's crazy so we're going to be going over all
[36:36.160 --> 36:41.720]  of that the latest on the bundy's amon bundy admits defeat calls on remaining oregon occupiers
[36:41.720 --> 36:48.480]  to stand down and go home and sure enough the so-called militia guys that were his security

[36:53.080 --> 36:57.600]  out of here you say the bundy's are feds we would go joe biggs would go we didn't say

[37:01.960 --> 37:06.880]  come in and tell everybody that alex says that their feds so they don't talk to us so
[37:06.880 --> 37:10.800]  we can't try to protect them and they were successful they did that they speak to ego
[37:10.800 --> 37:15.840]  the feds show up and go sir i'm here to protect you you are the new george washington i'm
[37:15.840 --> 37:21.720]  going to be your right-hand man and then it comes out that their informants so they're
[37:21.720 --> 37:24.720]  connected to the government or they've been threatened to do it and i'm not saying who's
[37:24.720 --> 37:29.760]  who or who's water naming names i'm just saying a couple folks got the word that day and disappeared
[37:29.760 --> 37:33.800]  other people got picked up and then released and i mean look at infiltrations they'll do
[37:33.800 --> 37:39.960]  fake arrest they'll do fake indictments they've even done fake executions before and release
[37:39.960 --> 37:44.000]  people that's been admitted so folks that don't know what the government especially the us
[37:44.000 --> 37:49.240]  government does to infiltrate quote organized crime uh or paramilitary groups or narcotics
[37:49.240 --> 37:55.760]  groups you just don't ever read the newspaper then um and and the weird thing is they'll
[37:55.760 --> 38:00.760]  use the same operatives over and over again burning people and they've got a playbook
[38:00.760 --> 38:07.160]  where they go up and speak to the ego of the people that mean well and then get full control
[38:07.160 --> 38:12.680]  of them and then say i'm now in charge of all media you know going through this group
[38:12.680 --> 38:19.600]  and then it's over it's over you are controlled from the beginning and i've seen them do it
[38:19.600 --> 38:25.080]  with all these muslim groups and radical leftist groups too well they'll get in take them over
[38:25.080 --> 38:34.560]  and then lead them into crimes or lead them right into right into ambushes and i've never
[38:34.560 --> 38:38.360]  seen anything like it and as soon as the people are all locked up and going to prison i get
[38:38.360 --> 38:44.600]  letters going i'm sorry you were right i wish you would have i wish i would have listened

[38:54.960 --> 39:02.320]  of people on how to do this over and over again this is a big victory for the globalist
[39:02.320 --> 39:08.840]  it's very very sad but hopefully we can learn from this and listen i would try to go cover
[39:08.840 --> 39:13.320]  urban warfare drills and my kansan and others are witnesses to this everybody knows i'm

[43:18.000 --> 43:24.400]  and that's a dna force already three to four times less than the nutraceuticals products
[43:24.400 --> 43:31.120]  of similar similar design and that that that medical offices sell now this is not prescription
[43:31.120 --> 43:36.120]  but many similar compounds are sold as prescription because people don't understand why it costs
[43:36.120 --> 43:40.040]  more than regular vitamins and things so as they sell it as prescription people then basically
[43:40.040 --> 43:43.440]  go along with it we're just giving you something that's normally prescription that we can legally
[43:43.440 --> 43:47.880]  give you uh for we're talking three four times less uh the what doctors will sell it to you

[46:23.600 --> 46:28.040]  stuff that went on when i was actually out on the ground reporting on things that nobody
[46:28.040 --> 46:34.880]  knew about i mean soldier of fortune right around that time in like 96 and obviously
[46:34.880 --> 46:40.120]  patriots over at that publication had an article about a delta force helicopter and a drill
[46:40.120 --> 46:44.600]  crashing in houston and then how the news said soldier of fortune was lying about it
[46:44.600 --> 46:48.840]  it didn't exist and they had people that had been in delta force write other articles
[46:48.840 --> 46:52.080]  about it no indeed this is going on so they go on air and say there's no such thing as
[46:52.080 --> 46:55.640]  black helicopters well i was sick of people saying i was lying about it so i went out
[46:55.640 --> 47:01.680]  and caught black helicopters running operations and who they were many times once in san antonio
[47:01.680 --> 47:05.280]  he would have the police chief had thrown them out we were videotaping the aftermath
[47:05.280 --> 47:11.560]  of a drill and they just had a guy get out an mp with a gun walk over pull his gun out
[47:11.560 --> 47:16.600]  and say give me your video camera i said give it to him mike mike said no first amendment
[47:16.600 --> 47:23.800]  takes the gun sticks it to mike's chest takes it away takes the tape drives off says stay
[47:23.800 --> 47:33.160]  here i don't know let's see what they do comes back with the erase tape 20 months later
[47:33.160 --> 47:38.200]  i mean that's the type of stuff we've had to deal with folks and and can you just imagine
[47:38.200 --> 47:43.160]  all the other things that are going on all the other things that are happening i mean
[47:43.160 --> 47:47.880]  you'll realize how evil this government is and what they'll do when you're in the woods
[47:47.880 --> 47:53.080]  trying to cover a military drill at a park next to an airfield and they try to burn
[47:53.080 --> 48:02.520]  stuff down and blame it on we're not in kansas anymore and people need to stop being so incredibly
[48:02.520 --> 48:08.360]  naive people need to stop being so mindless and admit how much trouble we're in and speaking
[48:08.360 --> 48:13.560]  of that let's shift gears to this sanders campaign worried microsoft apple misrepresent
[48:13.560 --> 48:19.800]  iowa caucus votes you got an app for both parties now run quote for the first time
[48:20.840 --> 48:25.400]  that'll tell everybody what's happening and so sanders is smart with his little conny friends
[48:27.400 --> 48:30.840]  because let me tell you we've seen polls out there where he gets double or triple what hillary
[48:30.840 --> 48:34.360]  does i mean i don't believe this stuff that he's neck and neck whether he's way ahead of her i mean
[48:34.360 --> 48:38.360]  i know who the constituents are a bunch of something for nothing people who like her because they
[48:38.360 --> 48:42.280]  thought she was a communist now she they know she's filthy rich sanders has been attacking all that
[48:42.280 --> 48:48.040]  that she's an insider so she's losing her support of course if you give a corporation like microsoft
[48:48.040 --> 48:51.320]  the control of or something they're going to do it they've gotten away with everything
[48:52.520 --> 48:58.920]  microsoft is a spinoff to get around any trust laws of ibm ibm literally created hitler ran the
[48:58.920 --> 49:04.280]  machines with the with the numbers on people the holograph machines just google ibm in the holocaust
[49:05.480 --> 49:11.960]  and thomas watson it's the watson computer the watson's the big deep blue it's the thomas
[49:11.960 --> 49:16.440]  computer named his first name that decides who to kill at the va and not give treatment to
[49:16.440 --> 49:20.040]  it's the thomas computer that's going to decide now if you're on social security whether or not
[49:20.040 --> 49:25.000]  your guns should be taken i mean they just run basically everything and and microsoft is their
[49:25.000 --> 49:31.160]  front company and involved in eugenics and secret vaccine programs and vaccines and food and covert
[49:31.160 --> 49:37.080]  operations and weather control just everything i say google it it's the foremost black op cut out
[49:37.080 --> 49:43.640]  front group and he's absolutely right uh that that's going on on wednesday the bernie sanders
[49:43.640 --> 49:48.440]  campaign said it was concerned software giant microsoft will tamper with caucus's election vote
[49:48.440 --> 49:53.400]  tallies in island next week and that's why they're setting up their own parallel system to track it
[49:53.400 --> 49:57.800]  absolutely you and you always catch these groups cheating but it's like well this tally didn't
[49:57.800 --> 50:02.040]  match up and by then the mainstream media has moved on to the next slide well now there's
[50:02.040 --> 50:06.120]  alternative media that's bigger than mainstream media in many cases so they can't just do this in
[50:06.120 --> 50:12.200]  the dark microsoft has partnered with both establishment parties and will provide a mobile
[50:12.200 --> 50:17.800]  embedded cloud-based platform that will facilitate accuracy and efficiency of the reporting process
[50:17.800 --> 50:22.920]  according to their website you have to ask yourself why they'd want to give something like that away
[50:22.920 --> 50:29.240]  for free said pete d alex randrow who is setting up the sanders campaign in iowa both the sanders
[50:29.240 --> 50:33.480]  and clinton campaigns have built reporting systems based on microsoft app in addition to taking money
[50:33.480 --> 50:38.040]  in the past from city group omen sacks jp morgan's and george soros and it just goes on to clinton's
[50:38.040 --> 50:46.680]  pedigree absolutely do the clinton's reg elections do big old brown bears go poo poo in the woods
[50:46.680 --> 50:55.320]  huh that's like saying to santa claus we're a red and white elf outfit with black boots

[54:13.240 --> 54:19.320]  we are back and i'm really glad that drifts report is linked to this ms nbc article because a lot
[54:19.320 --> 54:25.160]  of other media isn't recovering it and i don't normally even go with ms nbc but they love their
[54:25.160 --> 54:32.040]  little commie sanders and it is bold for sanders to call out the elephant in the room because
[54:32.040 --> 54:38.120]  election fraud is really a big problem and if you don't think hillary isn't going to use that
[54:38.120 --> 54:45.400]  in iowa and if folks don't know that microsoft is as crooked as a dog's back leg and then you
[54:45.400 --> 54:51.640]  need to get educated i'm talking to new listeners out there there's the ms nbc article sanders camp
[54:51.640 --> 55:00.280]  suspicious of microsoft's influence in iowa caucuses and more and more we see the election fraud
[55:01.480 --> 55:06.680]  i personally many years ago when pat buchanan was running went down and volunteered
[55:09.400 --> 55:12.520]  at the election center in the old convention center they tore down in austin
[55:12.520 --> 55:17.480]  and i was there stacking up the ballots in the so-called you know democrat town of austin but
[55:17.480 --> 55:23.960]  it was the republican primary and i mean like 60 70% were for pat buchanan or pat buchanan sides
[55:23.960 --> 55:33.720]  everywhere he was kind of the proto donald trump dark horse that folks wanted they didn't want who
[55:33.720 --> 55:44.280]  was it then bob dole and it came out on the news that night oh we've crossed over 60% of the tallies
[55:44.280 --> 55:49.400]  and it's clear pat buchanan i think was like 9% or something and then the establishment candidate
[55:49.400 --> 55:54.040]  was the vast majority and i walked around and talked to people in there and i said are your stacks
[55:54.040 --> 55:58.040]  the same as mine of different precincts almost all pat buchanan they go yeah it's pat buchanan's
[55:58.040 --> 56:04.040]  winning then we take the stacks of scan drones and stick them in a big machine and they have little
[56:04.040 --> 56:09.320]  data tapes and then somewhere in the data tapes well everybody knows what happens
[56:11.960 --> 56:15.400]  and then i even went and challenged the election results the state board heard it
[56:17.960 --> 56:21.640]  it was on county commissioner's tv you name it on cable
[56:23.640 --> 56:26.760]  and i got up and yelled at them and you know after they came back a week later and said
[56:26.760 --> 56:30.040]  the state board looked at it and agrees their anomalies and problems
[56:30.040 --> 56:36.920]  that we are certifying this they certify it so i yelled at them and said this is all tyranny
[56:36.920 --> 56:41.080]  so then they had the swat team that was in the building next door the next week when i was there
[56:41.080 --> 56:47.400]  come and sit on both sides of me i want to find that footage that's pretty funny anyways and then
[56:48.840 --> 56:52.920]  they're like alex there's no election fraud i go oh yeah so they were here come on over to our
[56:52.920 --> 56:58.040]  office i go over there there's like oklahoma cities and inside job videos on the wall and all the rest
[56:58.040 --> 57:05.160]  of it and i went back met with the head of the swat team and what's in it back and he goes alex
[57:05.160 --> 57:12.520]  there's no delta force coming there's no black helicopters i was a marine in vietnam and and
[57:12.520 --> 57:17.560]  i'm you know on the intelligence group of the state as well and i'm telling and then like i said
[57:17.560 --> 57:23.080]  six months later he calls him goes i gave him my number he goes come on by the office i want to
[57:23.080 --> 57:27.080]  show you something he goes gel to force was here and they did what you said they do i said what was
[57:27.080 --> 57:32.120]  that and he goes what you said they do which is try to buy him off he goes what's going on
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.320]  and then they heard about that and fired him they used some political correctness thing to get rid
[57:37.320 --> 57:41.640]  of him last time i already was working at the airport but but but that's how america operates
[57:41.640 --> 57:47.240]  they just go there are no black helicopters there's no election fraud obama's not a radical
[57:47.240 --> 57:54.280]  muslim there's no ISIS coming into the country they talk to you like you're five years old but
[57:54.840 --> 58:01.960]  it doesn't work like that anymore and so it's going to come down to people that know they're on the
[58:01.960 --> 58:07.080]  side of bad working for the system and those of us that know that the system's been taken over by
[58:07.080 --> 58:14.760]  very very very very criminal interests but the big news is trump is helping put the final nails
[58:14.760 --> 58:22.600]  in the coffin of the dinosaur rotting media helping shovel them into their graves as he says

[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.560]  trump's doing you know you go back a few months ago to that cnbc debate when they demonize and
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:44.200]  attack the candidates into the old school deal of making the media god the media the king makers
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.280]  and everyone just laughed at them disdained them said look what you're doing from from
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:53.160]  donald trump to ted cruz they did great jobs ran paul did i thought pretty much won that debate

[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:16.920]  we'll have our own system and so now cnn's gonna carry it and and trump would have dominated them
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.240]  even if he didn't because everything he said that would have been played more because he's the guy
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.560]  who isn't part of the party he's the guy that said no i'm not going to play by your rules

[01:03:54.280 --> 01:04:00.760]  slights kelly uh and ran paul says maybe trump will show up in a democratic debate he's also
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.720]  said good riddance you know it's not good ridden because you're acting like he was sent to the
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:14.600]  phantom zone with general zod he's going to be right there dominating and controlling the whole
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:21.240]  thing putting out his narrative while raising money for veterans that's like of the uh
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.280]  say broncos when the super bowl or the other team
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.840]  saying saying that they're not football players i mean it's just delusional
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:40.680]  and that doesn't work anymore yes in the past cnn could say no one wants your guns there's no
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.560]  covert military operations in america you know you didn't build your business two plus two equals
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:51.080]  five that worked in the past because there was no one there to call it people were in stock
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.960]  home syndrome and just couldn't believe it was happening they were gaslighted it doesn't work
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:02.920]  the trance is lifting the bernie sanders campaign is so suspicious of microsoft's influence in the
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.880]  iowa caucus that they've built an independent system to check the official results for the
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:12.920]  first time this year microsoft partnered with the iowa democratic and republican parties
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:18.120]  to provide a technology platform which officials at hundreds of caucuses across the state will
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:23.800]  use to report results from individual precincts to party headquarters for tabulation the arrangement
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:28.520]  has raised eyebrows of aids to sanders who regularly warn that corporate power and the
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:33.960]  billionaire class are trying to hijack democracy sanders is iowa campaign manager questioned
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:39.080]  microsoft's motives in an interview with msnbc saying you'd have to ask yourself why they'd
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:44.440]  want to give something like that away for free fair enough but the same question could be asked
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:49.720]  of a presidential candidate promising so many freebies be sure to tune in to info wars dot com

[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:21.960]  cliff it's so important he's offering it to you the cost of shipping uh he's on an advertiser
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:26.520]  i'm just telling you four ninety five that doesn't even pay for what the book cost him so so that he can
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:31.400]  warn you of what's happening and he's predicted pretty much with total precision exactly what
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:35.720]  would happen the last year uh and this went back several years but he comes on every few weeks and
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:39.240]  just tells us the next shoe to drop so there's no need to even have him on for an hour he's
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.920]  having one for like 12 minutes because he's a busy guy as well he just tells what he thinks is coming
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:50.600]  next harry dent dot com uh founder of dent research economic forecasting firm uh mba from harvard and
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:56.200]  i'm gonna go through the rest of his uh rest of his uh ceo jobs and things but mr dent obviously
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:01.320]  you were on two weeks ago since then it's it's it's what you said is happening you said you know
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.880]  stock market going down the next week uh continuing and might might pop back up again but then back
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.440]  down after that you talked about all the technicals uh so update us uh on what you predicted what's
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.000]  now happened and what you say is coming next well you know i tell you just to run through
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.120]  a few quick slides because it's important in the short term you have to get a little technical
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:25.800]  long terms very simple baby bloom spends and then doesn't spend you know internet moves
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:31.000]  mainstream then it peaks out as it has so we've seen the best trends behind us which we predicted
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.880]  20 years ago not just recently but in the near term i am seeing signs number one our first chart
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:47.960]  shows that every bubble we've had since the late 90s has gone higher and every crash has gone lower
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:55.880]  and and the big difference is that the last crash into early 2009 this final bubble was totally
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:02.680]  generated by printing money just just free money um uh companies buying back their stocks you know
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:09.560]  engineering their earnings everything's fake and and and so this bubble is the most dangerous to me
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:14.280]  it's it's all you've been saying that for years i mean you're right and you said microsoft uh you
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.520]  said apple would peak in the next few years apple now admits they've peaked that now they're talking
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.400]  about demographics suddenly a lot of folks are sounding like you but because they were able to
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:28.600]  artificially keep it going a few years longer than they should have and now at devos they admit
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:34.360]  their quote out of bullets what does that signify well they are and again the biggest thing i get
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:39.240]  alex every every media show i get on somebody comes in against me says oh harry this is not a
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:45.480]  bubble because of this i'm like no i lay over this bubble chart with every other bubble chart in
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:50.920]  history including the late 94 to early 2000 bubble which anybody would agree is a bubble
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:56.840]  and it lays over almost perfectly except this bubble's gone an extra year because the stimulus
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:03.480]  which makes it more dangerous so you know the this first chart shows that after each bubble's gone
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:09.000]  higher the next crash which is likely to happen in the next year year and a half or so
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:17.480]  is likely to take us down 70% from the top in last may to like 5500 to 6000 in the doubt now
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:22.680]  but there's a series of how this happens and this is where it gets more short term the next
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:31.960]  chart shows how we had this bubble channel i mean stocks just went straight up from late 2011
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:38.280]  into 2015 in a narrow channel with almost no substantial corrections and that's
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:43.640]  terribly dangerous and that happens and finally in august of last year we broke down below that i
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:50.040]  was warning our newsletter subscribers man if we break below this channel then you got to start
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:56.520]  thinking this thing is over the next chart very simple again shows for the first time
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:02.360]  compared to most bubbles because this has been artificial and stretched so long we have we're
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:09.000]  having a rounded top here you know it's not like it just gets crazier and crazier and then finally
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.200]  blows like china just did or we did in 1929 and you said on the show three years ago you thought it
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:19.880]  would start with china blowing you predicted it exactly yeah i mean and that you said out of all
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:25.560]  of the triggers china was the most likely china and oil which has also been another big trigger
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:31.560]  and i tell you next going to be germany and europe because germany's got the worst demographics
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:37.320]  of any country we've seen since japan in the early 90s and we were the only people that predicted
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:43.480]  japan would go down so but we're having this rounded top because you know it's you know there's
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:48.840]  all this stimulus but the fundamentals keep getting worse so it just keeps bending over
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:55.960]  and we broke another key level um uh recently at 1880 on the s and p 500 and then the final
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:03.400]  charges shows here's the most important thing to me the classic sign of tops like back in 2000
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:10.200]  and 2007 because bubbles just keep going and they're irrational and is it when the smaller
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:15.800]  companies start underperforming a large company significantly and this last chart shows that
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:23.560]  not only uh are the small cap stocks down twice as much as the large cap stocks recently but they've
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:29.000]  broken some very key levels and so sometime in the next couple months we're going to break down
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:35.240]  more substantially but remember the first chart the first chart says this will just be the beginning
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:43.000]  of another 2008 like crash which is going to go deeper and and and and be steeper on the downside
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.240]  just like it was steeper on the upside so i don't know exactly when this is going to happen nobody
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:53.240]  does the short term very hard to predict i'm having a big meeting with my company uh right after
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:58.360]  this call with our shorter term analysts and our longer term to consider where we're at because
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:03.480]  we're at a critical point but i'm telling you in the next year if you're ever going to protect your
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:10.200]  wealth and protect your assets this is the time to do it because i think and i've been predicting
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:18.360]  that that 2016 will likely beginning to end be the worst year for stocks since 1931
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:23.560]  and you said that months and months ago here then we heard almost the exact same headlines
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:28.440]  plagiarized by Soros by the Wall Street Journal by the Financial Times and the World Bank of Scotland
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:34.280]  came out and said sell everything i mean this is really scary uh i mean you've been probably the
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.960]  most accurate person out there i've got to say how bad do you think it's really going to get
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:46.120]  well well again i mean after they have extended a bubble it was already extreme more extreme than
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:51.000]  the 1920s bubble and of course that led to the great depression what people don't understand is
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.480]  when you stretch an economy so far with excessive debt and and the longer an economy does well the
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:04.120]  more everybody speculates and borrows and feels okay when you do that you're going to have a bigger
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:11.320]  downturn so so this is going to be something like the 1930s when it finally cracked and the only
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:17.000]  reason it hasn't cracked thus far is nine trillion dollars and some people estimate much more but
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:24.280]  i'm conservative nine trillion dollars sure in printed money not counting all the oh now you've
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:29.640]  got the giant populations unraveling worse than then you've got this socialist idea more entrenched
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.080]  than it probably was in the 30s this is going to be a move to bring in socialism and wealth
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:37.880]  redistribution that'll only stall things even worse i've got to say i agree with you you've
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:41.960]  been proven right and i think it's going to be far worse because people are more self-sufficient
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:46.920]  in the 30s most of them knew how to grow a garden most i mean i'm not trying to be mean but we got
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:52.680]  a bunch of immoral spoiled brats in this country and i oh my god i'm scared actually well i tell you
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:56.600]  it's worse in china because they've overbuilt they're the big bubble we were the biggest bubble in
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:01.640]  the roaring 20s in the world even though the whole world had a bubble china is the biggest bubble
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:10.280]  today and they've moved a half a billion people population from farms where they were self-sufficient
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.560]  into cities where they have no skills and only dependant sure something for nothing so it's a
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:23.880]  time bomb that and the fuses getting short so let me ask you this time frame is 2016 worse or 2017
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:29.000]  i mean when do you think it really becomes evident that we're screwed and then confidence falls out
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.640]  of the bottom they'll have some new banker bailout plan some new bubble but they're saying they're
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:39.160]  out of bullets do they just admit there's nothing and then let it all stagnate i mean whoa well well
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:44.760]  first yes i think we're getting signs from everything i said earlier that this bubble's
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:49.560]  finally blowing it is really hard to predict i asked me because i've had to do it in the path
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:54.200]  when a bubble's going to blow but we're finally getting the signs when it does it's going to be
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:18:00.600]  dramatic just like we just saw china down 45 percent at stock market in two and a half months
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:07.080]  it'll eventually be down 90 but half the damage of a multi-year downturn was done in two and a
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:11.880]  half months so i always tell people it's better to get out of a bubble a little bit early because
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:19.720]  when it finally does hit reality for everybody in lala land then it happens very rapidly so royal
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:25.160]  bank of scotland is absolutely right when they say sell everything yeah i i really i mean norm
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:30.840]  normally i'd say hey get a little more this or that no this is a time i'd say for the next year
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:37.160]  even though it may not start to bottom until early to mid 2017 and may not ultimately bottom
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:44.280]  for 2020 to 22 in our longer term forecast i think most of the damage can be done in the next year
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:50.040]  so you say depressionary in many areas the world as bad or worse will it be unevenly distributed
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:54.040]  like the last one you say we're not as bad as others will it be a depression here
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:19:01.560]  i yeah well i i think uh alec the most important thing is we triggered the last great recession
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:06.840]  they call it it was it was starting to be a depression 2008 subprime crisis but it only
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:12.680]  triggered a debt crisis that already existed around the world this time after all this stimulus
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:18.520]  six years of endless stimulus if this fails people are going to lose greater confidence
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.760]  and this is going to happen around the world in the chinese or the leading buyers of real
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:27.720]  estate in the leading cities around especially english speaking when they stop buying and they
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:32.440]  already are oh the whole harry dent i'm going to keep you the bottom of the hour so we can come

[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:13.320]  and it involves fema i couldn't believe fema tried this until i saw proof revealing their

[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:26.920]  and he's gotten us in with the feed trump event we're going to have the feed of that cnn's also
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:31.080]  running into the trough i expect to have them they're trying to shove us out it's just what the
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:34.600]  mainstream means to do it does i think they own and run everything they're a joke and trump is
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:39.640]  really killing that i want to just put a minute or so on what people should do also on what our
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:44.440]  guest thinks of what's happening the economy mr dent of dent research dot com but before we do
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:48.920]  that max keiser another smart guy made a lot of accurate predictions predicted the crash that was
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.800]  coming some other things but then you know had made a few mistakes as well but but a smart guy
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:59.080]  outside the box uh international tv host former stockbroker i brought up dent to him and said
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.000]  well look dent's been a little more accurate than you in some ways what do you say to him
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:09.880]  when you think gold's going to come back up here's that clip for mr dent look harry dent has been
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:15.560]  really good in terms of the last five years if he with all the people that he does mention he's
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:21.160]  probably got the hottest hand in terms of calling deflation where everyone else has really been saying
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:26.760]  inflation he was very good to say deflation all commodities have been deflating oils deflating
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:33.480]  and he includes gold in that basket but what i my response would be look at gold outside of just the
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:38.920]  u.s dollar because if you look at it through other currencies it's reacting very very well
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.560]  it's hitting new all-time highs number one so outside of the rigged economy it's doing well
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:49.640]  well in a global basis it's it's responding well and the second point i would make is that
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:57.160]  what one one aspect that mr dent does not get into that i think is worthy of consideration
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:03.160]  that would change the dynamic pretty dramatically is if a country like russia or china decides to
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:10.920]  partially back their currency with gold so gold is once again monetized then then it's
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:17.160]  really a different paradigm at that point all right and you'll see uh i think gold resume it's
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:22.440]  it's long-standing okay let's jump i want to go to more calls but okay that's max keiser from
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:26.600]  russia there in red square tuesday joining us mr dent your response to what he said
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:32.040]  yeah i mean first of all max i've been wrong at times too anybody that makes strong forecast
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:37.320]  is going to be wrong and we did see this deflation everything that's been our big theme is the baby
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:44.040]  boomers slowing down the largest generation history and a deflation from the bubbles of the
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.920]  past and especially from the overexpansion of china so i agree i mean that's what's been
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:54.520]  most hitting gold is that china is one of the biggest buyers of gold in the world not you know
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:59.160]  not just industrial consumers which is saying if their stocks go down in their currencies devalue
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:03.240]  that they'll they'll run to gold whether whether whether you think it's a commodity or real or not
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:08.920]  well well i i i think they're learning the same thing that gold was a bubble i mean i was i was
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:14.200]  debating uh you know many gold bugs and and they always say oh well gold's not a bubble i'm like
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:20.760]  it went up six hundred seventy percent in ten years that's a bubble in any stock any real estate any
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:27.000]  commodity um so i think gold is just coming back down to reality i think long-term gold's
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.480]  going to do well because we're going to have an emerging country led boom okay i think you answered
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.880]  that fairly uh i think you're both very smart people can make their own decisions but obviously
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:40.680]  time will tell and the three months we've got left other key points to look at other info you
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:46.280]  want to impart to folks and uh any other predictions well real quickly for people in gold we've been
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:53.800]  saying it's due for a bounce uh 1150 to 1300 we're almost 1150 uh i would say around april
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:59.880]  reevaluate gold if it's up then i would say stealth i would also say get into the safest
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:05.400]  high quality bonds short term and long term but short term at first because that's the only thing
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:10.840]  that did well in the great depression stocks commodities and real estate all went down and
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:15.960]  we're slow to come back and you've got to get out of stocks on any rallies here i we've already
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:22.280]  violated some major areas and i'm saying every time the stock market bounces and my short-term
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:27.720]  people are telling me we're due for a bounce here well if we bounce in the next couple weeks or so
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:35.240]  or month or whatever sell get out if you're wrong you may miss 5 percent 10 percent at best if i'm
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:40.360]  right you could avoid 50 to 70 percent decline are we going to see when this finally goes belly
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:45.720]  up completely people jumping out of buildings again in mass well that happened uh suicides

[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:35.640]  going to be going to him here in just a moment where the globalist controlling the federal

[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:44.920]  for every victory they have we have 10 bigger victories i can give you scores of victories
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:50.760]  after they leave us i'm going to do that but we need to learn from our mistakes and i have been
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:55.160]  through this so many times watching people get set up and manipulated it makes me want to throw up
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:00.680]  and the exact aftermath of what we predicted and the players and what was going on is now being
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:09.240]  confirmed i just can't believe it i don't know what it is about rural patriot communities listen
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:16.680]  they love the show so many times we put their stories out in the spotlight and then income
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:21.320]  the federal operators and they end up they won't talk to us anymore and then i'll watch them set up
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:29.080]  and thrown in jail and it's because it's it's just very very sad and they convert them in
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.920]  seconds they come to me say alex jones saying bad things about you they never asked to see it
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:36.680]  never asked for the proof they just go he is and there's that moment of brotherhood you care about
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:42.680]  me yes now i'm the commander and i'm going to protect you now you're with me now you do what i
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:49.240]  say i'm your bodyguard and then it's all over they are under the wings of the system and of course
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:53.240]  under the wings of the system they eat you alive but there's still people inside the bunties have
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:58.600]  said let them out you know come out uh i think the bunties are good people they've been manipulated
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:03.240]  it's very very sad and we don't want this to turn in any more of a victory for the globalist
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:08.280]  to take that huge victory we had with the bunties before where the feds were in the wrong had to
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:15.960]  turn back and now boy you you've seen how their psyops work and i've had marine core officers on
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:24.840]  about it yesterday and top cia uh you know field operatives on and and cia commanders on and former
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:30.920]  fbi agents on and all of them telling you it's all a stage it's a setup get out of there
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:38.680]  and people don't listen to them you don't listen to people that have seen it covered it and been
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:46.680]  through it they've got a psychological handbook with sociology on how to manipulate you
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:54.680]  and they think it's funny to chomp the american people now don't worry all those feds and the
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:58.440]  rest of them are going to have the globals take their pension funds you name it they have no future
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:02.680]  they'll be turned on they always are the they think they're running psyops on us their bosses
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:08.280]  are running psyops on them makes me angry so we're going to go to our reporters here in just a
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:14.120]  moment before i do that and then ron paul's coming up on huge developments before we go any further
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:19.800]  though ladies and gentlemen we're offering the best special ever on dna force in fact where
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.960]  did my bottle of dna force go i had a here it is at a bottle of it in here yesterday as they put
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:27.960]  the top on it for me i take one of these at lunch and one of these at dinner they say the best
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:33.000]  time to take it is really at dinner so you digest it all night on more of an empty stomach so none

[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:44.760]  we're competitive with the globalist and their tyranny to stop them we're in a war this is warfare

[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:03.160]  david night veteran of the first bundy siege uh where the feds threatened to shoot him from
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:07.960]  20 feet away and everybody else if they crossed a line they peacefully crossed it with their american
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:12.200]  flags on horseback and it made history and we'll probably roll some of that footage in the background
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:17.400]  for tv viewers radio listeners just type in historical footage feds surrender to citizens
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:23.240]  uh that was of course last year there at the bundy ranch uh in southern nevada but now he's in
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:28.760]  beautiful rural origan uh thank you so much for joining us and going out there so quickly uh david
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:34.040]  night what can you tell us david night info wars dot com alex we're here at the as you can see
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:41.320]  there's the road closed sign about uh four five hundred yards down there is a blockade by the police
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:47.480]  by the fbi we went down to that blockade and surprisingly they were pretty chill today from
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:51.720]  what we've been told from reporters who are here uh covering this and as you if you can turn around
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:56.040]  travis and and show uh all the people that are backed up here there's quite a few reporters here
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:01.480]  we had uh we had several police vehicles that were here earlier uh that have now left but
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:06.840]  there's still a police vehicle maybe about a hundred yards down that way uh we went up and
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:11.400]  talked to them and said look we'd be willing to go in and uh talk to the the people who are
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:16.520]  still in there reports are there's still about five people besides the ones who were arrested at the
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:22.360]  shooting uh lavoi fenicum they had eight people come out yesterday three of them were arrested
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:26.600]  uh the other five were let go we are being told that there's still five people inside
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:29.800]  at this point we said we'd be willing to go in and talk to them we've got a history of covering
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:37.560]  these issues and it really has gone on to a point where it's not about what's the greed the grievances
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:42.280]  of these groups out here it's now become about this military standoff and whether or not these
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:45.880]  guys are going to get out or whether or not they're going to to go down fighting and and that's not
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:50.280]  what this should be about this should be about the grievances that these people have were being
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:54.680]  uh turned out of their farms that they've had for sure sure i mean getting back to the fact that
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:59.880]  i asked you i said uh in the skype just broke up we'll we'll reconnect i mean i said hey if you
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:03.960]  want to go in i don't order people to go into a dangerous situation uh you know go in talk to
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:08.840]  and try to get them to come out saying look this is only going to end bad if you don't uh and that's
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:12.760]  what bundy's asking him to do as well and i want to find out if that message has been relayed
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:18.280]  i mean i'm tempted to just get on the phone myself and call the fbi up uh which i've only done before
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:21.960]  whenever uh you know people call up here saying they're going to carry out violent attacks on
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:26.360]  folks i i have reported that on air uh and to the fbi and secret service before uh because
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:30.120]  we're trying to stop a civil war here ladies and gentlemen uh and definitely there are some
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:34.120]  foundation forces that want this to get violent and are rubbing their hands together the leftist
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:39.240]  media loves it uh they really want to get a civil war going uh what did did the police and the fed
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:44.440]  say they'd relay that message uh to whoever's in charge david they said they said they could not
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:48.120]  make that determination here they said we could go to tactical center and we could talk to them and
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:52.760]  see if they thought that was uh something that was viable to do but as as you point out and as
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:57.880]  we've had guests on we had joel scowson saying look you need to move on he said this many weeks ago
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:02.680]  he said uh you need to move on you've made your point we have uh the congressman here who's sympathetic
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:07.000]  to the issues that are going on here in harnie county sympathetic to the uh injustice that was
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.880]  done to the ham and saying you've made your point go away before any of this you know before anybody
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:16.280]  gets hurt unfortunately that hasn't happened we're also going to try to talk to people we just got
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:21.320]  here this morning alex uh got in uh early in the morning probably about one o'clock and then we had
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:25.400]  a couple hour drive to get here so we haven't had a chance to talk to anybody in town i want to get
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:31.720]  a sense of uh the uh public's uh concerns about this were being told by the governor by the fbi
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:36.840]  that the uh residents were cowering in fear i don't think that's the case they had multiple
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:41.960]  times that they came in here and were talking to people with town meetings both in burns and they
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:48.360]  were on their way to another uh big was there he told me about 60 percent of the people were for
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:52.520]  the bundies but even some of those were like but this has gone on too long so it's probably about
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:58.840]  50 50 right right and part of what was going on and what happened the night that uh lavoi finnequin
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:03.720]  was shot they were going to a meeting in john day's reported to be several hundred uh people
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:08.440]  won the report said about 400 people were waiting there to to talk to them about what's going on
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:13.880]  what can be done about the blm so it was not just a standoff that they had going on here they were
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:19.720]  educating uh the people talking to them about issues uh maybe strategizing about what they were
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:23.320]  going to do we're going to try to talk to some of the people obviously it wasn't terrorism the feds
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:28.520]  have been pushing stealing land civil disobedience is a good thing overall the problem is a lot of
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:32.600]  locals didn't want them they didn't have the grazing rights clearly the hammons had backed off so
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:38.600]  they didn't want them uh and they were opening it up to be infiltrated by organizations and groups to
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:42.600]  misrepresent them they were being set up in a trap and the skype is breaking up we're going to go
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:46.200]  back to him in a moment and we're going to finish up with david night and get a former staff sergeant
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:53.160]  joe biggs's take uh on the whole situation and uh you know joe is really upset that the adl would
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:56.760]  dare to claim that he was part of this and helped take it over and stuff and we showed up you know
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:00.360]  a week into it and covered it and said we thought it was a bad idea but i explained to joe that's
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.960]  just what these liars do uh that's why they have no credibility it's why the government doesn't
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:09.160]  even use the adl or southern probably lost center material anymore at the fbi level officially
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:15.480]  because the lawsuits they've lost the issues with their line i mean they are just real pieces of work
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:20.520]  but i just want to be clear i warned hitari they were infiltrated they ended up they were
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:24.920]  and then our coverage helped the federal judge you know come to the point of saying this is staged
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:28.760]  letting them out and then they spun that in the media that i was against all malicious that's
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:32.680]  what the feds that are inside these groups do when i warn them look out here's the tactics
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:37.080]  people see those tactics and they go don't listen to him he's a fed i'm a fed like i'm an
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:45.960]  easter bunny jet pilot from planet x i am a patriot purebred texan 1776 are committed to
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:52.920]  freedom and the fruit of what we've done is absolutely overwhelming um but i mean it just
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:58.840]  it's it's just absolutely a patriot out in the woods when some guys in camo telling him i'm here
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:04.520]  to protect you i'm your buddy people just fall for it every time versus that fancy pants city
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:12.360]  schlicker alex jones you know don't listen to him uh and it just really really implodes every single
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:17.240]  time i think if they you know like they should do is i think they should go talk to the tactical
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:22.200]  center people and you know this is really to ascertain whether they're been run by the southern
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:27.240]  property law center or not because if it's not a bad batch of feds they're trying to de-escalate
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:32.440]  this uh they would say okay yeah go ahead and go and talk to them uh that's where you know the feds
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.520]  will only get more information that way either way we need to try to get those folks out before
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:41.160]  the feds decide to move in and we have some new wake up i mean only a crazy person will be against
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:45.400]  that if they don't want to send our reporters in like david night with known pedigree of just being
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:50.600]  a calm patriot uh because i'm known as a hothead maybe they could say no to me that's fine uh if
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:55.720]  they don't send in somebody like david night or joe biggs uh then um something's going on here it's
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:48:02.440]  classic to send in reporters uh that are somewhat sympathetic to a group uh and hopefully the folks
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:07.080]  inside will now listen to me they may have a controller in there still though manipulating
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:12.760]  this uh let's go back now with the skype feed to uh david night david uh are you guys going to go
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:16.280]  back to the tactical center and put forward that offer i mean the the feds are obviously watching
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:21.240]  right now yeah yeah we are and as we told them up there the checkpoint of course they didn't have
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:26.040]  the capability making decisions it was a state trooper there he's very cordial very polite the
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:32.120]  fbi guy was a little bit skittish uh didn't want to be on camera but uh you know they were they said
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:36.520]  they could not make that decision but we told them look we're known to these people most likely
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:41.400]  because we've covered these issues a lot uh we want to try to talk them out of this they have now
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:45.880]  made this about something other than the grievances that people had something other than the BLM
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:50.600]  this is all about uh the public perception is we've got crazy men with guns that are going to shoot
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:54.280]  each other shoot anybody to take some out of there that's not going to help anybody it doesn't
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:59.640]  help sure sure do we even know if they know that bundy since last night is telling them come out
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:05.560]  we don't know if they know that or not yes exactly good point amon has told them to leave
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.720]  we've had so many people telling them from the very beginning this was not a good strategy
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:13.800]  that's what we said from the very beginning uh it was very different at the bundy ranch because
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.520]  they had the support of the entire community uh they were very media savvy about the way they were
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:24.760]  going the community had been screwed over 34 of the 35 families since the 1870s had been run out
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:28.520]  they were shooting people on bicycles in the back people were filled out it was actually
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:32.600]  it was actually more than 50 ranchers that had been run out of there alex uh and and
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:36.520]  cliven bundy was the last rancher there and of course very similar situation here from what
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:40.840]  I understand uh the hammons were about the last ranchers that were here the BLM wants
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:46.760]  their land it and it's kind of checkerboarded with uh uh some other area that the BLM uh
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:53.400]  search control over so I understand that commonality there and we need to get back to those issues
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:58.280]  this has become a side issue it's become a distraction and it's really giving the whole

[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:11.160]  something shocking just happened in a coast guard unit in san diego the old guys in the unit
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:15.240]  have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks and head to head fitness tests
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:20.040]  how is this even possible turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:25.000]  group for a doctor formulated fountain of youth drink called patriot power greens patriot power
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.080]  greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:33.960]  stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past previously this drink was only available to
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:39.000]  elite military units but for a limited time the creator of patriot power greens has set
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:44.040]  aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends all they ask is
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:49.720]  that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping to claim your free samples of patriot power greens
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:59.640]  go to green 75.com that's green 75.com greens 75.com something just happened that is explained
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:04.280]  why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the
[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:10.600]  country it caught me totally by surprise and it involves fema i couldn't believe fema tried this
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:15.560]  until i saw proof revealing their secret could land me in hot water but i think you deserve to
[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:21.800]  know exactly what they're doing watch the viral video at fema three dot com before it disappears
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:28.040]  again but be warned it's really disturbing because the fact is they must know something we don't
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:33.800]  go to fema three dot com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:40.520]  critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across america don't miss out
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:45.000]  watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in recent
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:51.320]  days go to fema three dot com and discover the number one most critical item in a crisis
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:54:21.160]  watch the shocking video right now at fema three dot com again that's fema three dot com
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:31.160]  so
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:39.240]  joe biggs is on the ground in oregon about seven miles away from where five people are still
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:44.760]  holed up some of them left in the last 24 hours three of them were arrested several were released
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:51.000]  like the bundy's bodyguard uh so and then other folks left the day it happened magically some of
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:57.320]  the most outspoken people left so we're going to be tracking and watching who gets released down the
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:02.680]  road from the group that was arrested in the car if somebody just quietly gets the charges dropped
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:08.840]  on them later but other people don't we're going to be tracking all of that so we can educate everybody
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:14.040]  how to not get caught in this next time because this is mainly an information war the globalists
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:19.800]  want to make it physical joe biggs obviously covered this for a week a few weeks ago out
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:25.720]  there in the middle of it as it was building up and he joins us now out there where the media is
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:30.040]  at the checkpoint uh joe biggs what are your observations what do you think all this is going
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:36.120]  well at this point in time uh they have pushed this blockade back um to where
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:42.600]  we are i would say at least a few miles away now definitely maybe seven miles away from where the
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:47.640]  actual refuge is and like david said earlier there are some police that are over this way
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:52.360]  watching this it's like the first stop they usually call down i'm i'm assuming to the state
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:56.520]  troopers and fbi and let them know what kind of vehicles are coming how many occupants and then if
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:01.320]  you go down there um they'll stop you and uh talk to you earlier we went up there and approached them
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:05.400]  you know we didn't have any trouble this time but i'm pretty sure their posture changes at night
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:10.120]  time when all they can see are headlights coming at them um but like you said they have released
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:15.640]  some people some people have been uh captured that have left that area um they're saying that
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:20.680]  they believe uh there could be another five people still uh pulled up in that location as well from
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:26.600]  what we do know uh amon bondy and the six other people that were uh captured are being held in
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:34.520]  portland oregon at a uh a prison uh of that way as well and of course in the case of hell turner
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:39.560]  it was a known fbi i said we exposed him first and hackers got into his computer uh once that all
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:43.320]  came out they went ahead and burned him and put him in prison uh so there might be some lessons
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:48.760]  here too for folks that were playing both sides you might get shen up the river we're just speculating
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:53.000]  from past events we're not accusing anyone of anything here well here you got to choose your
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.400]  battles you know you know like david was saying when he broke down the whole thing in uh in nevada
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:01.640]  that was a perfect storm for them you know they were in the right place the right time they had
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:06.440]  the backing they had the people that showed up and uh they really made the uh federal government
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:11.480]  look bad and uh they've i think the federal government's been waiting on something like this
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:16.760]  to happen again and they saw that these guys took this place so then they're in an unknown land
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:21.560]  they're not going to have the backing that they had then and then we had a giant americana victory
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:28.440]  before and now this races a lot of it and that's kind of sad i mean it is sad to see that because
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:32.680]  you know i do believe that amon has some pure intentions in his heart that what he wanted to do
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:38.600]  uh was uh oh yeah you can only admire the courage and i get the feds are out of control and under
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:42.760]  the declaration of independence pretty much anything goes but you got to choose your battles and
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:46.760]  you know it's just you know but they're in a place that they don't know and there's people coming
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:51.720]  up volunteering saying hey i'm here to support the cause you know and you let those people in
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:55.000]  you know they're saying this mcconnell guy just showed up a few weeks ago and didn't really even
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:02.280]  know anybody and all of a sudden he's releasing a statement that's uh different than from the female
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:05.720]  who was actually in the vehicle when the whole thing went down so it makes you wonder what's
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:10.280]  going on the fact this guy you know goes on facebook puts out this testimonial about what he saw
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:14.840]  when he was uh and then he gets released and then he gets released was he the one that ran up to you
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:20.520]  and said quit saying we're feds uh no no that was uh another guy yeah yeah the point is is like
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:25.960]  that they run around saying that we said that the bundies were feds and that they were all feds
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:29.880]  to then make them not listen to us we never said that and and and it's how they get the
[01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:35.240]  confidence of their targets and it's just so sad i've seen this over and over again the little
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:39.240]  chicken sitting right next to the weasel has no idea what's happening to it we're like hey that's
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:44.680]  a weasel the weasel's got glinting eyes little teeth and we're like they're like shut up there's
[01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:49.560]  not a weasel it's my friend the weasel just wrings their neck goes that's right clean pure drinking

[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:14.520]  night as well as travis night are out there in oregon miles away at a checkpoint and when ranchers
[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:20.040]  drive back out that are authorized to be in the area under this little mini marshal law folks run
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:24.200]  up en masse the reporters is a feeding frenzy and ask what they saw inside let's go ahead and aim
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:28.680]  the camera over there while joe bigs narrates joe what are we watching on screen right now
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:35.800]  well we just saw someone actually leave the area where the refuge is they can pass the fbi blockade
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:39.960]  and they're now here at this media corral now david night's actually at the window
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:45.480]  speaking and listening to what they have to say so we can get us up we can probably get an update
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:50.680]  from him when they pull off to find out what it is if they were actually there or maybe they perhaps
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:55.880]  are ranchers who are in that area as well sure but obviously the big issue is you guys are going to
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:01:00.600]  try to get ahead of this go talk to the feds and others and say look you know who we are and you
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:06.200]  know we've thought this is stupid all along but we're also patriots let us go in and try to get
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:10.920]  these people out well it's been collapsing for the past few weeks i mean there there have been
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:15.160]  reports and i've seen pictures on facebook where there have been different groups of like organ
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:19.400]  militias and things like that who have gone and stormed in and they've started fighting and then
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:23.720]  you've got this sumo guy coming out so i mean this whole thing has been collapsing for the past
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:28.600]  you know a couple weeks you know at a high rate of speed and now that they've got a few more people
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:33.880]  in there all avenues of access are blocked off it's only gonna be a matter of time before more
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:39.800]  infighting starts uh they get desperate they leave they get picked up and it's over or they come out
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:43.400]  angry i mean there was a live feed yesterday on youtube where there was two guys and they're
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:47.160]  sitting there saying that they they've got guns and they're ready to go out fighting so that's
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:52.520]  but then there but then there's also two reports saying that there was a live feed going on with
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:57.160]  those same guys and someone runs up in the background saying hey have you guys uh signed your release
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:02.040]  forms like they were actors or something like that so at the same time there could be all the people
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:06.600]  i gotta say it could be five it could be five southern primary law center people in there for
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:09.800]  all we know they could they could be in there doing something right now to help go ahead and
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:14.280]  further demonize what's going on to make it look more yeah they've already waived giant crates of
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:18.760]  sex toys and dressed up in sumo wrestler outfits and people have already run off and stolen federal
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:23.240]  vehicles i mean you can just see the scripting of all of this with the poor bunnies and everybody in
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:28.040]  the middle of it well of course because like you said they had a huge uh victory back in nevada
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:33.560]  and now they're going to use this and do what they can to demonize the rest of the patriot movement
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:38.120]  and uh try to further along prove to the american yeah let's go over and talk to the state police
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:42.280]  guy real quick walk over to him here he's waving people over let's go over there ask him what's
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:50.760]  going on stick your mic in his face again hearing oh and our skype just broke down a loud vehicle
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:55.000]  yeah hey here's david night real quick you want me to have him plug in and uh he can
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.520]  uh tell you what the uh the occupants and the vehicles here what did the state police guy just
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:03.240]  tell you oh he just said to move out of the waste of vehicles can drive in and uh in and out just
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:08.520]  not to block the road okay go ahead night we got about a minute and a half for ron paul uh tell us
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:14.600]  what you just heard uh alex i was there this was a rancher who lives here locally in the area
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:19.960]  he said uh they had to go through multiple checkpoints he said they had uh a spotlight put
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:26.280]  on them last night a speaker telling them stop the car get out of the car raise your hands have your
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:32.440]  id ready uh they had a guy that had uh they approached them with guns drawn he said i feel
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:37.480]  like i'm in africa he says i've been in africa and we had checkpoints he goes they weren't this uh
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:43.400]  the stringent so i recorded what he had to say we'll post that up on uh info wars dot com
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:48.440]  wow so basically he's saying it's like martial law well we need to go into town then and talk to
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:52.280]  some more of those ranchers what they've gone through because i mean imagine now put your
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:57.000]  hands up do all this with all these major highways going through the area they've got them blocked
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.640]  off i mean that is just ridiculous and then how we have two witnesses that they just shot this guy
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:06.600]  when he had his hands up uh that's all very very suspicious but then the guy that says he saw otherwise
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:13.240]  he's released the former bodyguard of the bundes yeah i asked him i i said do you think that the
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:17.720]  law enforcement presence here and what they're doing is a bit heavy handed it goes i i don't
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:21.560]  want to make a statement about anything he didn't want to be committal about that but he did say
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:27.160]  when he was talking to people about what happened to him he was absolutely amazed and we lost david

[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:41.720]  two sides to every story i'm not taking a side on anything i don't want to say that the uh law
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:45.720]  enforcement presence was a bit too was heavy hand but this is worse than african martial law

[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:05.960]  so suspicious of microsoft's influence in the iowa caucus that they've built an independent system
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:11.720]  to check the official results for the first time this year microsoft partnered with the iowa democratic
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:17.080]  and republican parties to provide a technology platform which officials at hundreds of caucuses
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:22.200]  across the state will use to report results from individual precincts to party headquarters for
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:27.640]  tabulation the arrangement has raised eyebrows of aids to sanders who regularly warn that corporate

[02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:18.200]  ladies and gentlemen we're getting former congressman ron paul hooked up
[02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:27.480]  from the heart of the resistance it's alex jones we're getting former congressman ron paul hooked
[02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:36.040]  up via skype right now to get into election 2016 to break down the war powers act that
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:41.080]  they're trying to basically rewrite right now congress is writing the president a blank check
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:48.040]  for war the legislation makes the unconstitutional iraq war authorization of 2002 look like a walk
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:56.760]  in the park is his quote and then last week a u.s senator that is just incredible christ
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:09:02.680]  murphy of connecticut came out and called it worldwide military martial law and it got no
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:07.720]  coverage we're going to talk to the congressman here in just a moment about this and and just
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:13.320]  what's coming next here it is madam president today i want to come down to the floor speak
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:19.720]  very briefly about a resolution that the majority leader introduced i believe earlier today this is
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:26.280]  an authorization for military force resolution that apparently purports to give the president
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:32.200]  legal authority to conduct military operations against isis before we break for the weekend
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:37.640]  madam president i thought it was important to come to the floor to explain why very briefly to my
[02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:50.680]  colleagues excuse me to explain what this resolution really is this resolution is a total rewrite
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:56.440]  of the war powers clause of the united states constitution let's be clear about that it is
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:04.600]  essentially a declaration of international martial law a sweeping transfer of military
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:11.400]  power to the president that will allow him or her to send us troops almost anywhere in the world
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:22.360]  for almost any reason with absolutely no limitations now that is the sitting senator from
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:31.480]  connecticut chris murphy he came out last week with that we came out ron paul came out no coverage
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:37.640]  other than defense one of this and this is by the senate leader so i really appreciate former
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:43.320]  congressman ron paul joining us the video connection today here on the radio tv program
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:49.400]  to talk about this he wrote an article at ron paul dot com and it was also posted of course on the
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:56.120]  countless other liberty sites congress is writing the president a blank check for war the legislation
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:01.640]  makes the unconstitutional iraq or authorization of 2002 look like a walk in the park now when i
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:06.040]  talk about this stuff some people say oh that's alex shows he's an alarmist but what about when a us
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:11.880]  senator does it or someone super respected like ron paul dr paul in the past this would have gotten
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:18.680]  covered the fact that there's crickets chirping in the background tells me something big is going on
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:25.080]  uh former congressman thank you so much for taking time out to join us
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:30.520]  you're welcome it's good to be with you today alex we've got about a three second delay today
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:33.800]  so i'm gonna pretty much try to give you the floor sir let's get into this i mean this is
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:38.200]  everything we've warned of obviously we're not saying it's imminent tanks on the streets but
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:41.320]  it's just part of this soft creeping frog in the pot sir
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:50.760]  yeah this once again is giving more authority to the president and taking it away from the
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:58.280]  congress this is sort of a traditional trend it means that the congress is absent awl because
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:04.920]  they don't want the responsibility this issue came up as we were talking about the authority to go
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:11.480]  into iraq and other places and it was always even when uh we had a republican president republican
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:15.400]  the congress didn't want to go along with it the democrats didn't want to go along with it
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:19.320]  they don't want to assume any responsibility so they'd rather give up their prerogative
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:25.160]  it's one of the main major mysteries of our country why the founders work so hard to allow
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:30.040]  these powers to be put in the hands of the body that's supposed to be closest to the people
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:36.440]  and it hasn't been literally usurped and taken as so much as the congress gives it up but then
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:44.280]  the congress uh you know after a while it becomes a uh a whole a whole almost a uh policy statement
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:49.560]  because presidents you know whether they have the authority or not they they do a lot anyway you
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:54.760]  know they we live in the age of executive orders so this is very very important because it's out
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:59.080]  in the open what they're doing like you say like they're not reporting it and letting the american
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:05.640]  people know but you know they they'll do pretty much what they want remember when we were opposing
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:11.800]  the congress voting on authorizing bombing of syria and the people didn't want it and and uh
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:17.000]  obama backed off yet he went ahead and did the bombing anyway so uh it's out of control it's
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:23.960]  this endorsement and this fanaticism of endorsing this concept that actually was born uh with woodrow
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:29.640]  wilson we're we're responsible for making world safe for democracy now that we are the sole superpower
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:37.080]  and we have the sole control of the uh reserve currency of the world and people do depend on us
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:42.760]  at least for now that we can get away with this but it's very very dangerous as senator was very
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:48.520]  great on that statement i wish he took that same non-interventionist policy with economic issues
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:54.440]  but that's another story but he was exactly right on that and the connecticut must uh
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:59.080]  be uh pretty good because the former senator there voted against uh you know the war going
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:04.840]  into rack and he i think he was the only senator that voted against it uh shafi so this is uh
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:11.320]  another another blatant attack and we're in and then you mentioned alexis this comes from the
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:17.480]  leader of the republican party and he's supposed to be opposing giving power to a democratic president
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:21.160]  but you know what they're thinking about they're thinking about how soon there's going to be a
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:25.320]  republican president and besides i don't think whether you have the republican president at
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:30.840]  least tradition has it or a democratic president they're all the same people so whether they give
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:37.240]  it to obama for a year uh most people assume whether it's uh hillary or a republican they're
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:42.440]  all both are going to both sides will be authoritarian and they're going to make use of this
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:48.440]  but very very dangerous it's an attack on liberty that should alert the american people
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:54.680]  but unfortunately we uh in the liberty movement have a lot of work to do to wake up the american
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:15:02.600]  people dr paul this for those that have read history like yourself is just very obvious it's
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:10.120]  confirmation of the march into uh totalitarianism just like we saw the spending authorization
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:17.800]  that they put through um that gave the president a blank check they're doing all of these unprecedented
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:23.080]  things now when there was months of debating as you know the big iraq war resolution that you said
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:29.880]  was way too broad and opposed and now they're just doing things that would you know turn heads of
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:35.880]  putin did something like this or if the chinese did something like this i mean why do you think
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:41.880]  they're suddenly doing this and why would mitch mcconnell want to put into something
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:46.440]  like this in place and then why would the media not make a big deal out of it
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:56.120]  yes and and it wasn't up up front you know it was done on the friday in the middle of a snow
[02:15:56.120 --> 02:16:01.880]  storm hoping that it wouldn't be covered and it wasn't covered and yet he failed compelled uh
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:08.600]  to do this so yes i think potentially there's always this uh waking up the next morning and a
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:15.160]  major conflict going on but uh it's very suspicious that they're covering their bases because i think
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:22.040]  you know there is talk about expanding the war uh you know uh in in syria and and and even in libya
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:27.720]  again and and everything is breaking down nothing worked in iraq and nothing worked in afghanistan
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:33.240]  and there's a lot of people now uh you know the republicans aren't very good about a constitutional
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:38.680]  foreign policy they want to grant this authority and there's a lot of them that want boots on the
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:43.560]  ground and this authority that we're talking about literally gives the president of power put
[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:49.720]  group uh boots on the ground in any country or even in our own country under martial law it doesn't
[02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:57.720]  limit it to time or space or anything at all it's just an open-ended and uh this this is the reason
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:04.040]  why it it does uh raise the question is do we have we just uh gone along with at least the
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:12.120]  presentation of what would be a military dictatorship and uh they may well have either plans or fears
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:17.880]  that uh we're not all privy to of course those of us who have been concerned are always looking
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:22.440]  for the expansion of presidential powers and that's really the culprit you mentioned the
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:28.360]  economic factors and how they get together and spend that money and you know it's uh just remember
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:34.920]  the pictures of bainer and polosi's uh arm in arm and passing these budget and then our new speaker
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:41.000]  went along and and passed that budget which was atrocious budget and yet it was leadership on
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:48.840]  both sides and uh everybody wants reform uh except uh in the areas that they don't want reform
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:53.160]  because it other than for rand i think he's the only one who's taking the position
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:58.520]  that we don't have to spend another trillion dollars on militarism what we need is a common
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:04.360]  absolutely you know i said i get out of these hot spots and don't go aggravating people
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:08.360]  yes sir dr paul i've i've supported your son i was a president for the last two years and when
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:13.720]  he was still at number one six seven months ago uh and then now the media and all the manipulation
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:19.880]  has helped try to push him out of there but but separately the thing i'm most proud of what he did
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:25.080]  and i wish that he may be doing i don't see it in the media is come back and say you know double down
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:30.440]  on what trump said say look forget just not letting all mussels in the country we are going to end
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:36.520]  what's happening in syria our government started it obama started it with the neocons and the rhinos
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:43.240]  and and name the names of of of gram uh and and the other senators like mccain and say you helped
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:49.080]  fund al-qaeda you helped fund isis that's what your son was saying boldly three years ago then
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:54.600]  crews followed him and said we're not al-qaeda's air force he helped lead the military to say no
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:19:00.520]  and general demsy the chairman to say no that that was an incredible americana moment of stopping
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:06.760]  boots on the ground toppling Assad putting al-qaeda isis in control and then now we haven't heard as
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:10.520]  much about that i think that's something that could bring your son right back to the front of
[02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:15.640]  the race if he comes out and says look i'm not the guy saying you know stop what's happening in syria
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:20.280]  now i'm the one that said three years ago stop it because that is so important what do you say to
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:30.680]  that with election 2016 here sir well the whole thing is is the american taxpayer and american
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:36.360]  people suffer from the consequences of believing that it's necessary for our national security
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:42.600]  which is a complete lie you know lies took us into the iraq war and the lies that continue
[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:49.080]  right now it's created this migration of millions of people europe is much more vulnerable than we
[02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:54.200]  are we have our problems here but the american taxpayer pays for this and we pay for it by
[02:19:54.200 --> 02:20:00.520]  debt and uh you know they claim we have a decent economy and we don't have to worry that much
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:06.120]  and jobs are coming back and all that nonsense but we're paying for it uh the militarism and
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:11.960]  there's a huge debt and europe is breaking out with a major crisis and you're going to see
[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:19.080]  uh throngs of immigrants causing problems and then the taxpayer in our country especially
[02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:24.440]  will be taxed for this see one of my approaches was quit subsidizing something you won't have
[02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:31.320]  so much of it and immigration is totally subsidized and rewarded they come in so i would say that uh
[02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:36.760]  you've got to cut off the subsidies but right now even if you didn't cut off even if you cut
[02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:43.960]  off the the freebies like all free medical care and education that will have to spend money for
[02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:50.520]  maintaining uh you know law and order where people aren't burning our cities down uh but that is
[02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:57.000]  this was this is a predictable event uh because of the foreign policy i i really think that you
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:02.440]  cannot look at our economic problem problems without looking at the foreign policy because the
[02:21:02.440 --> 02:21:07.400]  foreign policy uh so many of them are saying you know what we need more of the past it's sort of
[02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:11.800]  like the feds saying well we have problems so we have to print more money and use more debt
[02:21:11.800 --> 02:21:17.000]  and foreign policy and foreign policy we get involved over there and we precipitate the hatred
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  and the blowback and all these events and then what do they say well kill more muslims and i don't
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:27.640]  think that's going to be the solution we we need a new foreign policy dr paul i wanted in the few
[02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:31.080]  minutes we have left get into the economy that you predicted and a few other issues and get your
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:37.560]  take on election 2016 and and and some other points but looking at europe and the us and others he's
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:42.120]  stabilizing it funding radicals in the arab spring putting the radicals in and libya syria
[02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:47.000]  and uh egypt now bringing them in knowing they're going to shoot and kill people and rape and murder
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.880]  every day i mean i have stacks of headlines and video i know you're a newshound i've you've never
[02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:56.600]  been on the show that you didn't know about a story i mentioned uh so you're informed you know how
[02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:02.680]  crazy it is so it has to be a plan why would the socialist and the elites want to bring in
[02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:09.480]  dark age level anti-female anti-liberty uh crazies not all the middle east is like that but we're
[02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:15.480]  bringing in you know from the really bad areas what is the collective west doing because it's
[02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:20.280]  the same policy as you know from the us to canada to germany to france what is happening dr paul
[02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:28.680]  well this has always bothered me about the uh deliberate policy that seems to be
[02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:35.720]  evil and backfires and stupid and uh it was you know even reading about the history of going
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:41.480]  into world war uh too and and i and i would say that well they they knew what was going to happen
[02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:46.600]  in pro heart but that story i said nobody could savably allow that to happen but when you read
[02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:52.760]  and study it they have ulterior motives they have ulterior motives saying well how are we going to
[02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:59.000]  mobilize the uh the american people to support it how can we use our propaganda to support
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:03.000]  certain policy and they get around to saying well if that's the price you have to pay that's the
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:07.000]  price we have to pay and we've heard it even heard so it's a million also say that five hundred
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:13.960]  thousand children died in uh arbala yeah yeah so so they they do that chaos is a benefit to people
[02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:19.400]  who want a negative revolution i want a peaceful revolution toward liberty but there's others who
[02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:24.760]  would like to see revolution out of fear so that they succumb to saying sure government take care
[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:30.520]  of me economically i want to be the kingpin i want to take take over the world so they actually use
[02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:36.840]  and deliberately cause this chaos but a lot of people don't want to believe that because it's
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:40.760]  hard to you know show the literal proof because what you're doing what we're doing is talking
[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:45.880]  about motivations and sometimes it's just as hard to believe that people like that exist in our
[02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:51.160]  government but it's getting a little easier for me to accept that as the years go on dr ron paul
[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:56.040]  we've only got a few minutes left i want to ask you about a point that ties together and and then
[02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:01.880]  ask you to promote the radio programs you're doing the the syndicated tv shows it's really growing
[02:24:01.880 --> 02:24:06.920]  the real revolution though is the grassroots now not just coming 50 000 and a pop to your rallies
[02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:12.760]  but actually sending your links out your videos out our videos out subscribing to your newsletters
[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:17.320]  really continuing that awakening and that revolution against the socialist offering of
[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:21.240]  bernie sanders and hillary they're going to use the crisis they helped create as you've always
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:26.520]  warned to bring in even more control we've reached that crossroads where donald trump knows he can
[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:32.280]  just go do his own debate get more viewers uh well we can do that too for our message so i think
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:37.400]  we've reached the point where it's an information war can you speak to that and then tie it in
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:42.200]  to the economy royal bank of scotland sell everything george soros sell everything new
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:47.720]  baker bailouts on the horizon the big event you've warned of it appears is is in with sites so media
[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:57.240]  revolution a websites we should visit and then be the economy sir yeah and i think we are moving
[02:24:57.240 --> 02:25:01.880]  rather rapidly i was on an interview yesterday where uh they were trying to pin me down and i
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:06.120]  don't like to do timing so much but i really said by the end of this year it's going to be pretty
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:11.960]  evident to most americans that we really are in a recession depression and we've always been even
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:16.360]  though the government claims all things are okay but they never look at the middle class and half
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:21.000]  of the population who's suffering all the kids are still living at home and all the debt that we
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:25.160]  have so there's a big difference i continue to work on this message you've known me for a long
[02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:30.440]  time and i've used various things whether i'm as a congressman or whether i'm a candidate on a
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:36.200]  national stage or whether i'm writing newsletters but right now i'm spending a lot of time on trying
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:40.440]  to get this message out through the youtube and our youtube youtube channel is growing and i'd
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:46.760]  like people to take a look at it the ron paul liberty report on youtube uh because numbers
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:52.360]  make a difference and uh and it's spreading and it takes well but i think you alluded to the
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:58.120]  fact that when you're in when you're a politician uh or in office you might get a little bit more
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:04.120]  attention and i find that uh to be the case but there's still millions of people out there that
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:10.680]  are looking for information but uh and you've done a great job in finding those people but i know
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:15.880]  that it's a little more difficult that is why i resort to uh getting our program out because the
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:23.080]  use of uh short videos uh in the campaign went very well in spreading a message i'm going to continue
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:30.120]  to do that but most important is trying to alert people to a philosophy of liberty and not for people
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:35.640]  to be despondent over this because i think we're making great inroads we're making inroads on on
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:42.440]  some nullification of federal laws people standing up against these ridiculous uh uh drug laws that
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:47.480]  put people in prison for life or non-violent crime all i agree people are waking up but they have a
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:53.720]  long way to go and they have to realize that we have this obligation uh for our own sake as well
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:58.920]  as for the sake of our country all right well thank you so much uh for joining us and we're
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:02.360]  obviously going to be watching the debates and following everything that's happening a lot
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:08.680]  can happen still as we go into these uh caucuses but uh in the final equation out of all the candidates
[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:13.160]  obviously we'd like you know rand paul to be in there is there is there anybody else that we know
[02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:19.000]  is a constitutionalist uh i mean what about uh hillary do you think the elite in just a quick
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:22.600]  answer is going to have to go to another program do you think that the establishment is getting
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:27.320]  ready to throw her overboard and bring in somebody like sanders or biden because it looks like they
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:36.040]  may indict her yeah i think right now that looks like the case and i thought they never would so
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:42.760]  it must be pretty bad uh i'm still suspecting that it'll be neither uh and either sanders
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:47.400]  or clinton that they'll you know bring in biden or somebody else like that you know and people say
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:54.520]  well it's way way too late but uh you know back when uh johnson was in office and you know said he
[02:27:54.520 --> 02:28:00.680]  wasn't going to run again i think that might have been in march of the election year and they put it
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:06.520]  together so yes there's still time for them to do that but to look for an alternative the only
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:13.160]  one even approaches even talks about and understands what a uh non-interventionist foreign policy
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:20.200]  and an economic policy and anti-fed position is only ran this talking about this but uh then again
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:26.040]  you know that's the message that they don't want to have heard and of course uh we faced that same
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:31.960]  same problem when i i was running uh even when i would do well in election or in polling you know
[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:38.200]  they just refuse it but they are very very fearful of anybody talking about a foreign policy that
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:43.400]  challenges a military industrial complex because they are very very powerful and they're in cahoots
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:49.000]  with the federal reserve and that's how a lot of evil is done in this country uh because of the
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:53.880]  corporatism yes the federal reserve and the banking system and now the medical system
[02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:57.240]  works with them too and that's why they do so well that's trying to take over with the crony
[02:28:57.240 --> 02:29:01.640]  capitals well i just want to say this sir you look great for your age you look even younger
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:05.800]  when i've seen you out there on the trail and in person and on tv then you looked even five years
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:10.920]  ago so i guess it's been good being out of dc uh and and and we're so glad that you know to see
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:18.840]  you looking so healthy and so young sir thank you very much it was nice being with you today all

[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:03.960]  good schools decent court system have a fair shake level playing field don't want to be
[02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:09.720]  run by george soros and offshore banks that are tax exempt trying to teach five-year-olds sex
[02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:15.160]  education and and growing chimeras inside cows and genetically engineering everything and trying
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:20.280]  to force an oculatus with stuff when we know the globalists are out there putting out zoological
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:25.720]  bio weapons through vaccines i mean you know we're all in this together that's all i'm telling you
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:30.040]  and if they can get us fighting with each other they win if we wake up to that and transcend it
[02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:37.160]  they lose and i until about six seven years ago thought we still probably have to have some physical
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:43.320]  deal that still may happen with the feds and the military and the police but the work of the patriots
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:47.640]  the liberty movement and the fact that the globalists then started calling them into their
[02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:52.760]  training sessions and going george washington's bad second amendments bad christians are bad
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:56.600]  and people get up in these and i should tell you about these when nobody knew it but us
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:01.960]  and they would go is this a joke this is not a joke if you don't like it we'll have you
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:08.600]  were you know kicked out of here and so they started sending me the footage of emergency
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:13.720]  management meetings and the rest of it behind closed doors and it's treason so we told the
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:18.120]  police and military this was coming then they were getting the classified briefings being
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:23.080]  sold it and went wait a minute and i tell you the globalists were so weird they would actually
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:28.600]  tell them in all sorts of meetings marine corps army police state police federal marshals when
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:34.120]  folks didn't know who i was they'd go and there's a lot of other people educating them to jack mclam
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:39.960]  and others don't listen to alex jones and we're watching your computers don't use it here at the
[02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:44.520]  station you know the military don't and people said who's alex jones i better look at that
[02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:48.680]  means it's like telling your you know your 14 year old son hypothetically you know don't
[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:53.640]  look at these playboys that i keep in this drawer as soon as you drive off to work we think you're
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:59.080]  14 year olds know and he's needy even playboys i i mean the globalists are smart in ways but
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:03.080]  they're also super arrogant and just think everybody's going to go along with their bull
[02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:10.200]  but people will if we play along with their narrative of how we're supposed to act so
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:15.160]  there's a lot of craziness going on but bottom line world government the new world order is not
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:21.080]  good for the average person or even mid-level folks or even a lot of elites it is only good
[02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:26.360]  for a very tiny percentage of people not even one percent who did not get their money through
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:30.360]  free market but by screwing people over and now they want to pull the ladder up for everybody
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:36.120]  else folks we got to stop it we're going to richard reeves in iowa with big news a lot of
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:42.280]  exciting stuff uh going on and he's been filing reports all day we're going to be live tonight
[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:47.960]  seven right through 10 o'clock i'm going to be here uh not Skyping in from home we're not Skyping
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:53.560]  in uh from you know the road but here uh with the crew we're going to have richard out there in
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:58.680]  iowa covering it all both the trump event and we're going to be covering the fox event we're
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:02.920]  going to be covering how cnn covers trump because they're quote you know now taking his feed that
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:06.520]  means they'll probably try to take control of it and i told richard don't get in the fight with
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:10.440]  them they're trying to do that because trump had called us in to have a feed that's just what they
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:15.720]  do it's their nature at the cia that's what cnn is literally at the mid-level and above uh it
[02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:20.760]  didn't matter we'll get their feed anyways the trump will be transmitted here on our you're just
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:25.800]  one feed to us then it goes out we'll have cnn and it'll be be critiquing that they jack the feed
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:30.360]  from us so we're taking theirs i mean it's it's it's just let them act like they do it's fine
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:36.120]  that's we'll just point out what they don't want the signal getting out uh so it's all unfolding
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:40.680]  ladies and gentlemen and all that matters is we show up on the playing field we've got the right
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:47.800]  on our side our political and cultural and spiritual and economic muscles will grow our minds will
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:53.160]  get more sophisticated our ranchero wavos are going to get better and we're just going to take
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:58.920]  these people down that mean there's some utopia we're not offering utopia liberty and freedom and
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:03.880]  the chance to be a rugged individual and the animating contest now you're going to end up so
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:08.360]  successful and wealthy and strong your kids are going to start getting spoiled that's the only problem
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:14.360]  with liberty is it just makes you so fabulously successful if that dirtbag weirdo bernie sanders
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:20.760]  has his way we're going to be in hell on earth very quickly but americans are so in they thought
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:26.280]  obama cared be free health care was it dummies he's now offering free health care if you just vote
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:32.840]  for him i mean give me a break now let's stop right there before we go to richard i'm going to be
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:37.320]  hosting with anthony uchiati the fourth hour i'm going to go war game when the when the third hour
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:42.920]  ends at two o'clock for 30 minutes with the nightly news crew on how we're going to you know
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:46.600]  basically handle all these feeds and all this news and breaking twitter feeds and everything
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:50.840]  tonight when we kick off the live news at seven o'clock we'll have a news package at first and go
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:56.680]  into live coverage and then i'm going to come back in here to interview roger stone who's the shadow
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:39:03.560]  advisor uh of uh has been the head advisor but the shadow advisor of donald trump he is in new
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:07.400]  york to be on megan kelly tonight you got to love it while they're going to be bashing him
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:13.320]  trump surrogate uh will be uh you know on air on their channel and then trouble be over here on
[02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:18.600]  his own channel taking over all the channels what a stroke of genius so we're going we're going to
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:22.840]  richard reeves here in a moment what a stroke of genius he's asked cnn and others to give money to
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:26.680]  vets because he makes them make 10 times more money on record with the ratings he brings they
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:30.920]  won't do it so he's just there to raise money for the vets tonight and all of it go to him the media
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:36.200]  claimed trump wanted the money for himself before remember they'll probably say it again but that's
[02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:39.880]  why there's so discredited so we're going to richard reeves but first we need to be funded
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:46.360]  and we fund ourselves with hardcore products the best shower filter with four stages uh
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:52.440]  that close so fast ten dollars or excuse me ten percent off promo code water free shipping

[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:16.040]  this is our most advanced product in the m4's lifeline uh this is a nutraceutical comparable
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:20.840]  products cost three hundred six hundred dollars and only doctors sell them or special health clinics
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:26.920]  we just went out got the licensing got it and it's the best stuff you can get at a blow away price
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:32.840]  it's regular price now it's twenty five percent off dna force is loaded with the patented bio pqq
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:38.680]  compound which is back by 175 now plus clinical studies the amazing compounds on the influence
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:42.680]  nerve growth and regeneration you heard that right we can actually say that because it's patented
[02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:47.880]  proven it is known to support the powerhouse of the cell the mitochondria and then we got coq
[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:52.680]  10 of the highest quality uh we've got trans reserve it's all i'm not i'm just going to stop there
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:59.560]  one ingredient when we make a batch of this cost us 14 000 a kilo
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:06.360]  um just give me and then more than two kilos goes into each batch so let me get this straight
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:12.360]  just the bio pqq that we have at each bottle the amount is 40 to 50 dollars in leading competitors
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:20.680]  just the bio pqq just the coq 10 is 35 dollars or more for the proper organic type that we have
[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:26.200]  the the the most absorbable type see i mean see just two of the ingredients the dose we have it
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:31.160]  are what this cost i mean are you understanding why it's such a good deal and we've now brought
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:35.880]  it down to 97 dollars normally 130 something still incredibly inexpensive with all the ingredients
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:43.560]  a total game changer now it's 97 50 it will sell out by saturday at the latest at current sales
[02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:48.360]  rates we're not getting more in for four to five weeks the reorder is in but going slowly
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:51.720]  because you have to triple test everything we have to pass california standards because we
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:56.600]  sell there which are almost unpassable the top labs we use just can't keep believing that we
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:42:00.920]  keep passing these tests over and over again we have those linked up on info or store.com as well
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:13.400]  with many of our products now let's go to richard reeves who is in iowa richard reeves you're going
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:19.240]  to be there tonight popping in off and on covering what's happening at the trump event we'll be
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:26.360]  covering the feeds here with cnn's propaganda over trump we'll be covering fox and their propaganda
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:30.440]  uh so we'll be mixing all these feeds together folks that want to watch other stuff simply can
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:34.360]  have flip back and forth or whatever you want we're going to give a live analysis of it all
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:40.120]  and what trump's doing is revolutionary breaking away doing his own deal and showing the media
[02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:45.080]  it's about personalities and the people and ideas not about you having the platform anymore
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:51.240]  it's about we make the platform this is the true death of the prostitute decepticon globalist
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:56.360]  media in my view we saw the beginning of their fall they were getting ready for it at the cnbc
[02:42:56.360 --> 02:42:59.720]  debate a few months ago where everybody's turned against them and it blew up in their arrogant
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:05.720]  faces uh and and now we see that happening uh as well very exciting giving your take on that
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:11.720]  and uh what you've discovered in iowa and what's coming up well alex thank you we are right out
[02:43:11.720 --> 02:43:16.840]  here outside of the very the veterans memorial auditorium here at the iowa event center this
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:23.000]  is the location of the official fox gop debate tonight and uh this is the one where trump will
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:28.920]  not be and i'll tell you there has just been an exceptional amount of news about this event
[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:34.520]  with trump not showing up uh it's so far at least as far as getting the word out and making this
[02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:40.680]  event bigger than ever trump has successfully navigated that the question will be will trump
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:47.480]  be able to successfully navigate it into a super positive where he can come into iowa and win big
[02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:52.440]  in the coxes and the subsequent new hampshire and south carolina votes so that's the question
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:58.360]  because it's a mixed bag of commentary from the people about whether or not they're happy about
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:03.960]  what trump has done here's snubbing the fox news debate so we are going to find out more about
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:10.920]  that and by the way we are going to be producing our own info wars dot com live feed from the drake
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:17.560]  university event where don trump will be speaking so we will have that tonight and uh barring our
[02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:22.040]  internet not not working because what we have had in the past is you get too many phones in a place
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:27.720]  you can't get out but we should have that feed and there's another thing i don't know if i haven't
[02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:33.160]  been able to stream the whole show alex today but senator ted cruz was on hanity last night
[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:39.800]  and threw down another gauntlet about the debate by saying hey they've got a location in su city
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:45.400]  iowa set up for saturday night one-on-one debate with ted cruz one of ted cruz's
[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:50.920]  packs is putting up $1.5 million for the veterans so they've thrown down the gauntlet and set a
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:56.760]  challenge to don trump show up saturday night in su city for a one-on-one debate absolutely we've
[02:44:56.760 --> 02:45:00.920]  mentioned that and guys get me the latest of trump is accepted that i think at first he was saying
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:07.320]  probably no uh because he obviously is bigger than cruz nationwide only in iowa is he neck and neck
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:12.200]  with him and i like cruz i mean you know let's get that straight uh but at the same time you know
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:17.160]  trump can just go do his own debate and dominate but i would like to see them do their own debate
[02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:21.720]  and then every other network have to tune in just because it savages the old horror media
[02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:26.760]  that things were all trashed with all those arrogant bloodsucking painted up harpies that
[02:45:26.760 --> 02:45:32.840]  read off teleprompters yes alex well you know right before you came in with me you were talking
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:37.000]  about some of the history of you know the long years of slogging it out building the patriot
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:42.920]  community up trying to defeat the fact that the new world order one of the big modus operandi is
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:47.960]  constantly dividing conquerors dividing conquer dividing conquer and uh you know they still
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:53.320]  continue that even now divide and conquer and finally i mean think about it alex a year ago
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:46:00.520]  though we were facing the inevitable hillary we were facing the inevitable bush as the nominees
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:06.920]  for the democrat and republican parties going into the general election and here we are a few
[02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:13.480]  months away from conventions looking at potentially both those big time bill deberg establishment
[02:46:13.480 --> 02:46:19.640]  new world order candidates hillary and jeb bush could be gone through the primary process a year
[02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:26.280]  ago he wouldn't have even been imaginable so we've uh got a cornucopia of pretty good candidates
[02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:32.520]  on the gop side you trump cruise rand paul uh ben carson you know fiorina these are the people
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:36.600]  are hungry for outsiders let me ask you this question because i know you're up there you
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:41.880]  got a camera guy with you but but i i almost don't want to interrupt the trump event so i
[02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:48.280]  think what we should do is get your feet in place right start covering it you know right as it builds
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:53.560]  up right as he comes on we should run an info wars feed that's clean because we can run as many
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:57.160]  pieces we want if our it folks to set that up because we have the daily show feed that's already
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:02.520]  going we're gonna have the nightly news feed that goes live at seven uh that you know covers all the
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:07.640]  debate pre coverage post coverage i'll be there leon mac and jacari jackson darin mcbrane rob
[02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:12.520]  dues on a well-deserved vacation hadn't been on one in six months he's off snowboarding with his
[02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:18.600]  sons uh so all of that's going on uh and i so so i think we should have the fusion feed because
[02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:24.280]  we just didn't carry our own feed and mix that trump feed in with the the fox feed to show both
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:30.200]  side by side with our commentary but also give our viewers the straight trump feed since they've
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:33.720]  asked us to come in obviously they're inviting a bunch of people in but we should provide that
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:39.160]  clean trump feed so let's do that you know start at 30 minutes before run a clean feed to us we'll
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:44.280]  leave it clean just of what trump says but then if you want to get a mixed feed you come to us
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:49.480]  with our live analysis because you know it'll turn into a quite a disaster if we don't because folks
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:55.000]  will think we're talking over trump go ahead right uh well we are obviously we're gonna do everything
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:48:00.280]  we can to set up a great primary feed and then even maybe potentially a secondary feed that we could
[02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:05.880]  have a different shot or angle at so let's just identify what that node's gonna be and get it tested
[02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:09.720]  and then and because we're so fast moving we're actually doing technicals here on air now that
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:14.120]  this is moving this fast and then and then let's just find out the port that we direct that to to
[02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:19.880]  make sure it's on the front of the page so folks can find the trump feed our mixed feed uh of the
[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:25.080]  other enemy transmission very good we will follow up on that because we will be going to the drake
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:30.360]  university event uh right after this to get all set up and geared up for tonight so it's really
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:35.240]  shaping up to be exciting i think fox is really going to be lamenting that they they've crossed
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:41.000]  trump uh you know on this event and well guess what he's double crossing them even better but in a
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:45.720]  patriot way he's now saying he's probably going to bring other people that have been kicked out
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:50.680]  to the debate so he's having his own debate now this is really developing folks i tell you
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:55.400]  trump is quite the showman he knows what he's doing well he is a showman and i know a lot of
[02:48:55.400 --> 02:48:59.800]  folks from iowa uh listen to some of the commentary on some of the mainstream outlets and talking to
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:05.880]  people on the ground that a lot of folks in iowa are disappointed so trump is in a position where
[02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:12.200]  he needs to deliver something extra special he needs to modify the ones that are great folks
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:17.800]  they're great folks but they've gotten the spoil brat thing where hey just fox keeps saying and
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:24.200]  everybody oh he's disrespecting you not being here uh don't you feel better like yeah we're kind of
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:31.240]  mad that he's not tired of it for us this is for the whole country a b it's a setup and c he's doing
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:37.000]  his own debate speech so it's pure bull they ought to vote for who they think can turn the country
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:42.600]  around and who doesn't want to deep six it and and they shouldn't get mad at him making a smart move
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:49.400]  come on iowa they shouldn't buy into the the mind control they're being given and and being lectured
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:53.560]  to by the establishment but you're saying on the ground the people you've talked to it seems like
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:57.720]  and listening to radio because you know they screen those shows richard local radio is pretty much
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:01.960]  totally controlled in most areas the globalists are scared of it the last three years they've
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:07.080]  really killed most local shows that even had high ratings that are patriot that they put democrat
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:13.320]  rat heads in everywhere right well it's a it's a mixed bag you know you've got the trump loyalist
[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:17.400]  that trump can do no wrong it's like the joke that trump said recently where he could shoot
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:21.160]  somebody on fifth avenue and people would still support him be behind him so you've got that
[02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:26.040]  hardcore set but then you you know you do have i mean there are a lot of cruise supporters i was at
[02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:31.320]  a cruise event in waterloo iowa saturday night there was about 1200 people there so there they're
[02:50:31.320 --> 02:50:36.920]  going in that rhetoric if trump is chicken or this or that or whatever so uh oh yeah trump's real
[02:50:36.920 --> 02:50:44.680]  afraid to debate cruise he's already debated cruise like eight times right well richard stay there
[02:50:44.680 --> 02:50:49.800]  stay there okay oh my gosh yeah i mean is this gonna work trump is chicken i mean now you notice
[02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:54.200]  i'm just getting fully behind trump because he's the underdog and i just can't stand watching all
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:58.920]  these people pile on and then call him a chicken when he's lost hundreds of millions of tv money
[02:50:58.920 --> 02:51:03.400]  something just happened that is explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves
[02:51:03.400 --> 02:51:09.240]  and has sold out in many areas of the country it caught me totally by surprise and it involves
[02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:14.840]  fema i couldn't believe fema tried this until i saw proof revealing their secret could land me in
[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:20.600]  hot water but i think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing watch the viral video at fema

[02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:17.160]  started talking about issuing a national id card with a built-in radio chip called rfid i felt having
[02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:22.200]  to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced
[02:52:22.200 --> 02:52:27.400]  that credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon
[02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:33.000]  incorporate rfid it was then i formed id stronghold to share my inventions and blocking rfid signals
[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:38.280]  with the world there are a lot of misconceptions out there today about rfid i encourage everyone to

[02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:13.720]  in san diego the old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:18.920]  and head-to-head fitness tests how is this even possible turns out the old guys in this unit had
[02:53:18.920 --> 02:53:23.480]  been part of a special test group for a doctor formulated fountain of youth drink called patriot
[02:53:23.480 --> 02:53:27.800]  power greens patriot power greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that
[02:53:27.800 --> 02:53:32.680]  it's made their achy joints stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past previously this
[02:53:32.680 --> 02:53:37.880]  drink was only available to elite military units but for a limited time the creator of patriot
[02:53:37.880 --> 02:53:43.320]  power greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends
[02:53:43.320 --> 02:53:48.200]  all they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping to claim your free samples of
[02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:55.720]  patriot power greens go to green seventy five dot com that's green seventy five dot com greens seventy
[02:53:55.720 --> 02:54:09.960]  five dot com now tomorrow we've got a debate
[02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:18.440]  although one of the candidates has chosen not to attend
[02:54:25.320 --> 02:54:33.400]  apparently mr trump considers megan kelly very very scary
[02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:38.360]  and you know donald is a fragile soul
[02:54:40.440 --> 02:54:46.280]  the she might ask a mean question and who knows what could happen i mean his hair could stand on
[02:54:46.280 --> 02:54:52.120]  him all right cruise you know full well he knows he can hog all the attention in iowa the only
[02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:58.120]  state he's not destroying everybody by 15 points 20 points in and so it's somewhat of a gamble if
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:05.240]  the horror media can spin it that it's mean to iowans and it isn't okay so the question is are
[02:55:05.240 --> 02:55:12.280]  iowans stupid and and i don't know uh but uh richard reeves is there i'm gonna have our good buddy
[02:55:12.840 --> 02:55:17.240]  mr stone on in about 30 minutes good shard he's coming in for 30 and i'm coming in for the rest
[02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:21.960]  of the time with stone who's in new york i mean look trump knows what he's doing he's shown he
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:28.440]  knows what he's doing uh what does your gut tell you richard reeves well you know trump has made so
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:33.000]  many correct decisions throughout this whole process over the last seven or eight months
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:38.280]  that it's hard to argue with the decisions he makes and it does look one thing for sure as we
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:45.240]  stated earlier he has made this into the biggest deal so far of the whole campaign so everybody
[02:55:45.240 --> 02:55:49.720]  in the united states unless they're hiding under a rock somewhere or don't have tv or don't have
[02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:55.560]  internet they know about the situation with trump so overall on the national basis i think this is
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:56:00.120]  going to make trump way way way way big so we'll just have to see how it impacts iowa we're going
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:03.720]  to know here pretty soon it's going to we're going to know a lot tonight and we're going to
[02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:08.440]  know a lot more over the weekend and then monday finally we're going to know a heck of a lot when
[02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:13.320]  we see that turnout and by the way matt our cameraman was doing some research about how this
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:18.920]  impacts fox trump not showing up at the debate and it potentially impacts them in a big way
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:25.000]  up to about maybe about a half a dollar half a million dollars per minute difference no i know
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:31.160]  it varies it varies they were getting 750 to a million a few days before this already selling
[02:56:31.160 --> 02:56:36.200]  and people are back it was in the news backing out of the contracts 150 foul is what it's going for
[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:40.120]  now so so they claim they're getting all this hype and foxes like oh great he did this we're
[02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:44.360]  getting all the attention no trump's getting the attention everybody wants to watch trump
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:49.640]  you're screwed you neocon fake bastards that have been trying to bring us down forever as well
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:55.000]  we're sick of you and so people people can watch porn online they don't need to go to playboy
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:59.800]  magazine to look at meghan kelly okay so there'll be more people watching trump tonight than there
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:05.560]  will be watching the porn channel sorry right well and i that's why i think that donald trump's
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:10.040]  going to have basically open source video feeds we're going to have the info wars dot com feed
[02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:15.000]  seeing in will have their feed that they're being fed by from the trump campaign and so it's going

[02:59:59.640 --> 03:00:05.720]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's
[03:00:05.720 --> 03:00:15.240]  a war on for your mind the wave of refugees peppered with isis fighters and isis sympathizers
[03:00:15.240 --> 03:00:21.480]  are invading europe all according to plan and with the blessings of european leaders jihads are
[03:00:21.480 --> 03:00:27.400]  being waged european women are being raped at epidemic levels the french city of calais has
[03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:34.120]  become ground zero for the migrant anarchy flooding the rest of europe and now a wave of 400 000 plus
[03:00:34.120 --> 03:00:40.120]  migrants are entering italy but rather than pushing on to northern europe these migrants will remain
[03:00:40.120 --> 03:00:46.680]  in italy as the schengen treaty intended to guarantee open borders is coming apart at the seams
[03:00:46.680 --> 03:00:53.720]  six countries germany austria sweden norway denmark and slovenia have suspended the treaty for two
[03:00:53.720 --> 03:01:00.520]  years and others appear ready to follow them in many respects schengen no longer exists italy's
[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:05.800]  prime minister has come under fire after ancient nude statues in roam's capital loni museum were
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:11.160]  covered up during a visit by iran's president and this is exactly what the isis leaders had
[03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:18.280]  planned the conquest of roam is one of the islamic states primary goals as isis intends on beheading
[03:01:18.280 --> 03:01:24.520]  the pope on live television in st peters square to be followed by mass beheadings of christians
[03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:32.360]  as roam is converted into a muslim city the isis timeline to achieve all this is by 2020 but europeans
[03:01:32.360 --> 03:01:37.960]  are in a chokehold when it comes to airing their grievances stringent hate speech laws and intimidation
[03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:44.520]  are being used to wage war on european citizens simply asking their leaders to stop the invasion
[03:01:44.520 --> 03:01:49.800]  for the sake of their families a professor who interrupted a speech by german chancellor angela
[03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:55.640]  merkel was quickly escorted out of the room and now faces legal action from mersberg university
[03:01:55.640 --> 03:02:01.240]  which vowed to review his position and take legal action against him for damaging the faculty's
[03:02:01.240 --> 03:02:12.920]  reputation yeah in october top security experts warned merkel that the middle class in germany is
[03:02:12.920 --> 03:02:19.480]  becoming radicalized in response to the migrant influx and that domestic unrest may occur as a
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:25.240]  result the warning was circulated among high-ranking security officials in the federal government
[03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:32.680]  according to the report i believe the challenge is huge and if a challenge is huge usually it
[03:02:32.680 --> 03:02:38.840]  will trigger fears and concerns we'll have to address them the german government is also working
[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:45.000]  with facebook to censor and prosecute people who make anti migrant statements on social media
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:51.640]  meanwhile a dutch man who tweeted that the country's migrant policy was a bad plan received a home
[03:02:51.640 --> 03:02:58.760]  visit from police and was cautioned as to his future conduct under these policies and the initial
[03:02:58.760 --> 03:03:05.640]  half million plus muslims planting roots in italy the outlandish 2020 goal of the isis conquest of
[03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:13.480]  roam doesn't seem as fantastical as previously thought there it is h res 569 condemning violence
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:18.120]  bigotry and hateful rhetoric towards muslims in united states and that is that in the house
[03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:23.080]  judiciary um brought forward by who's that brought forward by who's the sponsor of that
[03:03:24.200 --> 03:03:28.440]  a whole bunch of people i'll have to i'll have to read that for myself what does it say
[03:03:29.160 --> 03:03:37.000]  just a resolution and it's um basically a blatant attack on the first amendment jon bound free force

[03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:26.200]  insight on this americans hate the u.s government more than ever before this is from cbs and we're
[03:04:26.200 --> 03:04:31.160]  going to look at why we hate the united states government and how we're in an abusive relationship
[03:04:31.160 --> 03:04:36.360]  with the government that we can't seem to get out of an abusive relationship and more so than ever
[03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:42.760]  we really need a advice relationship counselor to tell us how abusive the government is
[03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:45.880]  specifically we're also going to talk about the mainstream media unable to control the

[03:08:24.920 --> 03:08:31.480]  bottom of the hour alex jones is coming back with roger stone to talk about some insider information
[03:08:31.480 --> 03:08:37.480]  and a key interview on the whole trump anti debate issue and what's really going on tonight
[03:08:37.480 --> 03:08:43.480]  and also coming up at 7 p.m central time alex and the entire info wars crew will be in covering
[03:08:43.480 --> 03:08:49.720]  not only the debates but what trump is doing on cnn and a lot more but first i wanted to cover a key
[03:08:49.720 --> 03:08:56.760]  issue and it's really funny because what america needs is a relationship counselor because believe
[03:08:56.760 --> 03:09:04.120]  it or not you are in an abusive relationship with your government we all are we are all in an abusive
[03:09:04.120 --> 03:09:08.920]  and controlling relationship with our united states government establishment and the mainstream
[03:09:08.920 --> 03:09:14.520]  media and what happens is when the government and media can't control our narrative and control
[03:09:14.520 --> 03:09:22.520]  us 100% they freak out they just don't know what to do it's in utter chaos right and i'll use an
[03:09:22.520 --> 03:09:28.040]  example so whenever there's a break in the story or or someone actually manages to put independent
[03:09:28.040 --> 03:09:33.000]  analysis out there and it becomes the norm or people embrace it in the public the mainstream
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:40.120]  media and the government both freak out and it brings me to this story from cbs americans hate
[03:09:40.120 --> 03:09:45.560]  the u.s government more than ever a handful of industries are those love to hate type of businesses
[03:09:45.560 --> 03:09:50.520]  such as cable television companies and internet service providers right we all hate a lot of
[03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:55.320]  those but the federal government has joined the ranks of bottom of the barrel industries according
[03:09:55.320 --> 03:10:01.560]  to a new survey from american customer satisfaction index americans satisfaction level in dealing with
[03:10:01.560 --> 03:10:07.560]  federal agencies from the treasury to homeland security has fallen for a third consecutive year
[03:10:07.560 --> 03:10:14.280]  reaching an eight year low people hate the government they can't stand the government
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:18.200]  how terrible is it going through tsa how terrible is it dealing with anything to do with the
[03:10:18.200 --> 03:10:23.080]  government these days it's absolutely terrible and it's hit an eight year low according to these
[03:10:23.080 --> 03:10:29.400]  polls people are tired of it but gee we're still letting it happen aren't we we're still sitting
[03:10:29.400 --> 03:10:35.880]  there and we're in this abusive relationship and i believe it's because not only is the
[03:10:35.880 --> 03:10:42.600]  government abusive but the mainstream media is controlling and what happens is most americans
[03:10:42.600 --> 03:10:48.840]  as we see from these polls are fed up and tired of it but they don't get to express themselves
[03:10:48.840 --> 03:10:53.720]  and they feel like they are kind of the minority and then we have things like this happen dc issues
[03:10:53.720 --> 03:11:00.280]  one million dollars worth of parking tickets after blizzard to cars that are stuck in two feet of
[03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:05.480]  snow okay i'm from philadelphia i know what this is like when it it was a real serious snowstorm
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:10.920]  you don't just say oh well gee i'm gonna go get my car from wherever i am if you're downtown let me
[03:11:10.920 --> 03:11:15.720]  just go get the car and and go out in two feet of snow and get out of that area where i'm not supposed
[03:11:15.720 --> 03:11:19.880]  to park right because how it'll work is you'll be able to park there and then by the next morning
[03:11:19.880 --> 03:11:26.520]  or something if you're still there you get a fine obviously in a rational system where we're not run
[03:11:26.520 --> 03:11:31.160]  by mentally ill people they would say well gee you can't move your car in two feet of snow but
[03:11:31.160 --> 03:11:35.960]  that's not what happened dc snow emergency will remain in effect through wednesday and the city
[03:11:35.960 --> 03:11:41.080]  wants drivers to know it's serious about enforcing parking bans the district has issued one million
[03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:46.200]  seven the eight thousand worth of parking tickets and sixty five thousand dollars of fines so far
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:52.600]  it's even towed six hundred and fifty six cars at owners expense visitors face two hundred fifty
[03:11:52.600 --> 03:11:56.840]  dollars tickets hundred dollar tow tickets and twenty five per day fee until they pick up their
[03:11:56.840 --> 03:12:02.200]  vehicles which you can't do because it's so snowed in no one can even leave but many drivers say they
[03:12:02.200 --> 03:12:06.120]  simply couldn't move their cars from emergency routes after the blizzard dropped two feet of
[03:12:06.120 --> 03:12:10.680]  snow in the district quote they gave me a two hundred and fifty dollar ticket just for being
[03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:17.800]  snowed in i couldn't get no help daniel smith said and then then then people wonder why we
[03:12:17.800 --> 03:12:24.360]  don't trust the government and think it's a complete joke because it is it's completely absurd
[03:12:24.360 --> 03:12:28.600]  it's completely insane and i'll push that a step farther because that's kind of a silly thing
[03:12:28.600 --> 03:12:32.200]  with the million dollars in fines for not moving your car when it's under two feet of snow
[03:12:32.920 --> 03:12:38.120]  that's kind of the silly thing push it further let's talk about this for just a minute michigan
[03:12:38.120 --> 03:12:43.640]  cities beyond flint have concerning lead water levels data shows and this is a story from michigan
[03:12:43.640 --> 03:12:49.080]  live that expands into something much bigger all eyes are fixed on flint as the crisis over led in
[03:12:49.080 --> 03:12:55.160]  the city's drinking water supply has unfolded at an accelerated pace but flint is not the only
[03:12:55.160 --> 03:13:00.040]  municipal or private water supply in michigan where the drinking water is tested at or above
[03:13:00.040 --> 03:13:03.480]  levels that researchers and public health officials considered to be the threshold
[03:13:04.040 --> 03:13:08.520]  goes on to say their environmental quality records show that a bunch of different water supplies
[03:13:09.240 --> 03:13:16.120]  are exceeding the federal limit on lead and copper well g remember i guess a few weeks ago it was
[03:13:16.120 --> 03:13:21.000]  now when i was here last time and i was able to join you guys and we spoke about how it's not just
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:27.480]  flint and i mentioned that water supplies around the united states have led levels that the according
[03:13:27.480 --> 03:13:32.280]  to the world health organization statistics and looking at the levels from different research
[03:13:32.280 --> 03:13:38.760]  pieces are already affecting children and some of the effects were devastating it's making them
[03:13:38.760 --> 03:13:43.720]  anti-social crushing their intelligence even at low levels and the worst part is you aren't going to
[03:13:43.720 --> 03:13:50.920]  see the symptoms but are the government making a big deal about that of course not of course not
[03:13:50.920 --> 03:13:56.120]  and this is one of the pieces i mentioned weeks ago from vox it's not just flint every major
[03:13:56.120 --> 03:14:01.080]  american city has hazardous amounts of lead hurting kids the story of flint michigan's children
[03:14:01.080 --> 03:14:06.360]  being poisoned by lead contaminated drinking water has rightly shocked and scandalized the nation
[03:14:06.360 --> 03:14:11.640]  but while the situation in flint is certainly an extreme case the problem is much more widespread
[03:14:11.640 --> 03:14:16.600]  than people realize children in essentially every city in america are being exposed to
[03:14:16.600 --> 03:14:22.120]  have had hazardous levels of toxic lead and a very little is being done about it at the most
[03:14:22.120 --> 03:14:26.920]  severe levels lead attacks the brain and central nervous system to cause coma convulsions and even
[03:14:26.920 --> 03:14:31.800]  death now it's not that bad throughout the country obviously there's not excessive levels where you're
[03:14:31.800 --> 03:14:38.520]  getting that but it's it goes on to say at least mild versions of these impacts are felt at even
[03:14:38.520 --> 03:14:44.760]  low levels of lead exposure that cause no obvious symptoms and are previously considered safe okay
[03:14:44.760 --> 03:14:50.520]  and it goes on to talk about resulting in reduced IQ behavioral changes shortening of attention span
[03:14:50.520 --> 03:14:56.440]  and increased antisocial behavior and reduced educational attainment all right and then we wonder
[03:14:57.400 --> 03:15:01.400]  why we don't trust the government the mainstream media wonders why aren't they trusting the
[03:15:01.400 --> 03:15:07.800]  government and coming to them for help we can't even have a water supply unless we freak out about
[03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:12.920]  one city that's being addressed not even getting into the sodium fluoride and the antibiotics in
[03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:17.960]  the water supply the other pharmaceutical drugs not even getting into that just the lead issue alone
[03:15:18.920 --> 03:15:25.640]  and they ask why and how about this walmart we talked last time also about walmart and the
[03:15:25.640 --> 03:15:31.480]  truth about walmart and how it's really the epitome of everything that makes america terrible
[03:15:32.120 --> 03:15:37.160]  everything that pulls us down everything that pulls down the hardworking people that actually
[03:15:37.160 --> 03:15:42.600]  want to help others and build the economy walmart is kind of like a big fat leech that just sucks
[03:15:42.600 --> 03:15:47.000]  the blood out of everybody not just a certain class people just kind of sucks the blood out of a
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:54.520]  city right but what happens when walmart goes away from certain towns well walmart shutdown
[03:15:54.520 --> 03:16:01.000]  creates new food deserts according to associated press this is such a powerful article if you
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:07.000]  really read it we'll put it up on info wars dot com if you really read this article it shows
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:14.120]  you just how much we've been swallowed by walmart walmart's decision to shut down 150 stores across
[03:16:14.120 --> 03:16:19.080]  the country means that starting thursday residents without cars in the neighborhood near historically
[03:16:19.080 --> 03:16:25.240]  black college outside alabama will have to cross dangerous roadways on foot to get fresh produce
[03:16:25.240 --> 03:16:31.080]  and meat come friday folks in coal hill arkansas will need to drive 15 miles to get to the nearest
[03:16:31.080 --> 03:16:36.440]  supermarket and pharmacy low-income neighborhoods of wichita state university in kansas will be
[03:16:36.440 --> 03:16:41.880]  losing quick access to fresh groceries so these people actually can't get fresh real food they
[03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:47.560]  could probably buy a snickers bar at a gas station but they can't actually buy food and what's more
[03:16:47.560 --> 03:16:53.240]  sad is walmart was their only source of real food so-called real food the store closings
[03:16:53.240 --> 03:16:57.320]  by the world's largest retailer are creating three new food deserts in these neighborhoods
[03:16:57.320 --> 03:17:05.080]  with nearly 15 000 residents according to ap one of them is in fairfield alabama a hard luck
[03:17:05.080 --> 03:17:11.000]  suburb of 11 000 about eight miles west of birmingham the walmart there sits on a hard highway
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:16.120]  marked by a jury swaths of abandoned commercial buildings fast food restaurants payday lending
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:20.680]  businesses and gas stations by late last week it was already out of fresh food and shoppers who
[03:17:20.680 --> 03:17:25.800]  picked over the remaining items also worried the store shut down could affect competitive prices
[03:17:25.800 --> 03:17:29.480]  that gives the stores the opportunity to raise their prices but you don't have anywhere else to
[03:17:29.480 --> 03:17:35.880]  go according to a local look walmart is a huge leech and look what happens when even they shut
[03:17:35.880 --> 03:17:40.200]  down which in my view is a good thing it just shows how controlling there were over these towns
[03:17:40.200 --> 03:17:45.400]  the only place they had to go was walmart for fresh food for real food that's the only place they
[03:17:45.400 --> 03:17:51.960]  had to go all right and look it's essential to support real operations and real businesses

[03:18:35.880 --> 03:18:41.800]  jones is going to come back in studio and speak with roger stone on what's happening tonight with
[03:18:41.800 --> 03:18:45.560]  donald trump the debates bunch of insider information you won't be hearing anywhere else
[03:18:45.560 --> 03:18:51.320]  but let's crack into a few stories here so this came across my desk and i thought this
[03:18:51.320 --> 03:18:56.680]  was interesting intelligent people are genetically predisposed predisposed to be healthier experts
[03:18:56.680 --> 03:19:01.640]  fine university of edinberg suggests that gene variants linked to thinking skills are also linked
[03:19:01.640 --> 03:19:06.280]  to health for the first time scientists have grown shown that the intelligence is linked to good
[03:19:06.280 --> 03:19:11.000]  health so blood those blessed with the brains are also less likely to become sick develop disease
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:15.880]  or die early the reason they say is down to genes an international team led by the university
[03:19:15.880 --> 03:19:21.240]  discovered the gene variants make people smart also protect them against illness what i would
[03:19:21.240 --> 03:19:25.880]  like to see is that if that means it's lifestyle changes or it's just a genetic thing that protects
[03:19:25.880 --> 03:19:30.200]  you from being sick i also think that super intelligent people sometimes totally forgo
[03:19:30.200 --> 03:19:33.880]  their body and don't care because they're so dedicated to something that they end up getting sick
[03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:38.680]  well we'll be we'll be right back with covering more news and talking more about the interview

[03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:20.840]  interview with roger stone he's going to cover everything that's happening tonight with trump
[03:24:20.840 --> 03:24:26.680]  some insider information the debates and of course he'll be back again at 7 p.m central

[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:41.720]  dot com so you know we're talking about people hating the government cbs says hatred towards the
[03:24:41.720 --> 03:24:45.800]  government is an all-time high people hate the tsa people hate everything about the government
[03:24:45.800 --> 03:24:49.880]  it's horrible it's horrible dealing with the united states government oftentimes they simply
[03:24:49.880 --> 03:24:54.760]  cannot be trusted or pretty much every time and it reminds me of two key videos i wanted
[03:24:54.760 --> 03:24:59.240]  to share with you one of which you know we've always been told we're going to get the troops
[03:24:59.240 --> 03:25:03.800]  out of afghanistan we're going to bring them home we're going to bring them all home but
[03:25:03.800 --> 03:25:09.160]  of course that never happened and in fact report us troops may stay in afghanistan for decades
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:13.320]  apparently he says what we've learned is that you can't really ever leave let's play that video
[03:25:13.320 --> 03:25:21.080]  it's really a striking reversal for president obama who staked his presidency in part on
[03:25:21.080 --> 03:25:25.800]  ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan and it was only in 2014 that we had to stand in the
[03:25:25.800 --> 03:25:31.400]  rose garden and promised to bring the u.s. military role in afghanistan to an end and since then
[03:25:31.400 --> 03:25:38.760]  there's been a series of reversals of changes to the drawdown plan from afghanistan and now
[03:25:38.760 --> 03:25:44.040]  as my colleague greg jeffi and i report today u.s. military leaders are quietly talking about
[03:25:44.040 --> 03:25:49.560]  years or decades long presence in afghanistan they think that's what will be required to help the
[03:25:49.560 --> 03:25:55.880]  afghan forces be able to fend off the taliban and this lingering al-qaeda presence that continue to
[03:25:55.880 --> 03:26:02.200]  threaten not just afghanistan but american national security and of course we're probably never
[03:26:02.200 --> 03:26:07.880]  coming back right and it also reminds me of this one video where we were told again that hillary
[03:26:07.880 --> 03:26:15.240]  clinton would never use any form of unclassified system to transfer classified information but
[03:26:15.240 --> 03:26:19.160]  according to this video actually she used a blackberry to communicate classified information
[03:26:19.160 --> 03:26:27.800]  let's go to this video now i must say since the last time i was here uh over a dozen years ago
[03:26:28.360 --> 03:26:32.920]  things have changed when i first came to the department we had wangs
[03:26:32.920 --> 03:26:43.560]  now we have blackberries and it has changed the way diplomacy is done uh things appear on your
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:48.600]  blackberries that would never be on an unclassified system but you're out traveling you're trying to
[03:26:48.600 --> 03:26:53.720]  negotiate something you want to communicate with people it's the fastest way to do it my favorite
[03:26:53.720 --> 03:27:02.280]  story about this is at the un general assembly um uh two years ago secretary clinton was at the EU
[03:27:02.280 --> 03:27:07.640]  it was then EU 27 meeting uh where all the foreign ministers were arrayed along the long
[03:27:07.640 --> 03:27:11.240]  table she was on one side of the table kathy ashen was on the other side of the table the
[03:27:11.240 --> 03:27:16.840]  high representative for the european union uh they were trying to during that un general assembly
[03:27:16.840 --> 03:27:21.480]  negotiate a quartet statement for middle east peace and so they sat there as they were having
[03:27:21.480 --> 03:27:26.120]  the meeting with their blackberries transferring language back and forth between them and between
[03:27:26.120 --> 03:27:32.600]  their aides to multitask in a quite a new fashion uh to have the meeting and at the same time be
[03:27:32.600 --> 03:27:37.480]  working on the quartet statement so time and time again we're lied to and told you're safe
[03:27:37.480 --> 03:27:42.360]  everything's fine we're going to bring the troops home we would never use an unclassified system
[03:27:42.360 --> 03:27:46.680]  that would be terrible that would be against everything we stand for but over and over and
[03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:50.920]  over again we're lied to just like i mentioned earlier a million dollars in fines put out to
[03:27:50.920 --> 03:27:56.680]  everyone in dc for parking their car in two feet of snow unable to move it but hey you're still
[03:27:56.680 --> 03:28:01.160]  illegally parked so we're going to ticket you anyway and the quotes in there say well my my
[03:28:01.160 --> 03:28:05.560]  car had two feet of snow we're unable to move it we're unable to get on the roads because they're
[03:28:05.560 --> 03:28:10.120]  completely blocked off because of government advisories but they say it doesn't matter we're
[03:28:10.120 --> 03:28:15.000]  going to take your money anyway and by the way flint michigan oh that's a a totally crazy
[03:28:15.560 --> 03:28:20.200]  off the wall outlandish example when in reality there's lead levels across the united states
[03:28:20.200 --> 03:28:24.600]  and other contaminants in the water we don't have to get into that are hitting the hitting the kids
[03:28:24.600 --> 03:28:30.920]  with no symptoms reducing their iq so it's no surprise that we don't trust the united states
[03:28:30.920 --> 03:28:36.280]  government let's hit some news before alex comes back again in this next segment coming up with
[03:28:36.280 --> 03:28:41.080]  roger stone to detail a lot more information on what's happening with trump tonight give you the
[03:28:41.080 --> 03:28:47.000]  full scoop as well as the debates so the zika virus is spreading explosively according to the world
[03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:52.680]  health organization and this is really a tragedy because this is essentially a virus that if you
[03:28:52.680 --> 03:28:58.600]  get it it's not that big of a deal you have some flu like symptoms but of course if you're pregnant

[03:29:03.720 --> 03:29:11.160]  effects that are pretty much really tragic and it says it could expand to about a million and
[03:29:11.160 --> 03:29:17.640]  1.4 million people here's a little bit of a relief article though some similar ones we've

[03:33:31.640 --> 03:33:42.120]  i don't need your prayers it's true save a few for lept into he only did what he had to do
[03:33:42.120 --> 03:33:54.200]  you
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:34:01.160]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live anthony gertiarty is sitting in studio with me he was
[03:34:01.160 --> 03:34:06.520]  just co-hosting we are lining up the skype connection with mr roger stone right now uh to
[03:34:06.520 --> 03:34:15.720]  break down the latest in just the trump uh battles that are happening all over the united states
[03:34:15.720 --> 03:34:22.120]  throughout the media and i tell we really see the beginnings of the collapse of the mainstream media
[03:34:23.240 --> 03:34:28.360]  as people like trump realize and the public realizes the media doesn't run the narrative
[03:34:28.360 --> 03:34:34.440]  anymore the facts and the personalities do because now trump can go and out something and end up
[03:34:34.440 --> 03:34:40.200]  having more tv cameras more alternative media more video feeds more coverage than the stupid
[03:34:40.200 --> 03:34:46.520]  fox debate and i'm not attacking fox but meghan kelly does have it out for him but the reason
[03:34:46.520 --> 03:34:51.080]  he's walking away clearly is they've got all these setup artists there everybody's gonna gang up
[03:34:51.080 --> 03:34:55.480]  they're gonna really try to uh bring him down and why should he do that when he's bringing the audience
[03:34:55.480 --> 03:35:02.760]  why should he bring the rope for them to potentially go after themselves and while we're getting
[03:35:02.760 --> 03:35:07.560]  stone on there was this promo that made green that we've hardly aired it it's so good uh where he
[03:35:07.560 --> 03:35:12.360]  shows all the major media attacking us and what's that done made us bigger but they still don't get
[03:35:12.360 --> 03:35:18.680]  their discredited even though all the polls and numbers show do we find that well we can play
[03:35:18.680 --> 03:35:23.560]  it off youtube it's our facebook featured video actually we can just go play it right off facebook
[03:35:23.560 --> 03:35:29.720]  for everybody uh it's up to alexander emrick jones on facebook uh for folks that want to be able to
[03:35:29.720 --> 03:35:36.840]  to see that because it just illustrates everything that we're facing and dealing with as a culture
[03:35:37.800 --> 03:35:43.000]  now again ladies and gentlemen the fact that info wars could become so successful in the face of the
[03:35:43.000 --> 03:35:47.320]  mainstream media is some of our research our work our hard work but but a lot of it has to do with
[03:35:47.320 --> 03:35:55.000]  just the fact that the system tries to be as nasty as it can to condition us and to prepare us
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:36:01.880]  us that we will just accept evil they're they're trying to turn the world upside down and that's
[03:36:01.880 --> 03:36:07.480]  not working they want to break our will so don't let them break our will by the way we can't get
[03:36:07.480 --> 03:36:10.840]  the most sky but it's cool let's just give them the phone guys thanks let's just stop stop now
[03:36:10.840 --> 03:36:15.160]  trying that uh and i think it's you already you've been hosting the last 30 minutes i mean
[03:36:15.160 --> 03:36:18.600]  just since you've been in info wars three years watching the huge changes that have happened and
[03:36:18.600 --> 03:36:23.960]  we're just a microcosm the mainstream media is a control freak system and we're an abusive
[03:36:23.960 --> 03:36:28.600]  relationship with it and where we allow it to control our narrative and our beliefs and they're
[03:36:28.600 --> 03:36:33.160]  freaking out when things happen like trump saying i'm not going to do the debate i'm going to go do
[03:36:33.160 --> 03:36:38.920]  my own thing anything against their control freak mission totally sends them for a loop notice if
[03:36:38.920 --> 03:36:42.840]  you watch the mainstream media actually they don't know how to respond to that i agree are you guys
[03:36:42.840 --> 03:36:49.160]  said something here what was that oh fantastic thank you i've got low audio here today uh fantastic
[03:36:49.160 --> 03:36:55.640]  well let's go to our guest i appreciate mr stone joining us today mr stone has obviously been on
[03:36:55.640 --> 03:37:00.120]  the show quite a bit the last few months he's the best-selling author researcher and been a major
[03:37:00.120 --> 03:37:06.680]  political strategist an analyst for a whole bunch of different presidents and mr stone thank you so
[03:37:06.680 --> 03:37:10.680]  much for joining us i know that you're reportedly going to be richard reeves was telling me on fox
[03:37:10.680 --> 03:37:15.720]  news tonight while trump is overdoing his own event you'll be basically talking about the campaign
[03:37:15.720 --> 03:37:21.000]  some i think this is really smart what trump's doing but you can give us the inside baseball i
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:26.760]  haven't talked to you since he announced this a few days ago what what's really going on here sir
[03:37:27.720 --> 03:37:32.120]  me alex this is nothing short of brilliant first of all let me say thanks for having me on it's
[03:37:32.120 --> 03:37:38.360]  always great to be among fellow patriots uh don trump has roiled the establishment like never
[03:37:38.360 --> 03:37:43.800]  before and he has grabbed the narrative so the final days in the countdown before iowa is all
[03:37:43.800 --> 03:37:50.600]  about Donald trump will he show up won't he show up why isn't he showing up what are the issues
[03:37:50.600 --> 03:37:57.160]  i spoke to him about an hour ago and uh he is really in great spirit he's predicting a massive
[03:37:57.160 --> 03:38:03.000]  crowd at his counter event he's predicting uh incredible ratings it's now going to be covered
[03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:10.440]  live by both cnn and the sin claire communications network that could reach as many as 40 50 million
[03:38:10.440 --> 03:38:16.200]  people mike huckabee has decided to show up at the trump event rick santorum will be showing up
[03:38:16.200 --> 03:38:22.760]  at the trump event alex very significant because both of them have small but significant pockets
[03:38:22.760 --> 03:38:28.680]  of support in iowa it is conceivable wow because just an hour ago sir sorry to rep you just talked
[03:38:28.680 --> 03:38:33.560]  to trump just an hour ago he was hinting at others are you announcing here or is he already announced
[03:38:33.560 --> 03:38:38.360]  uh that he's going to have them there let me put it this way i know for a certainty that both will
[03:38:38.360 --> 03:38:44.280]  be there wow that is breaking news is this a signal to their voters in iowa that maybe your first
[03:38:44.280 --> 03:38:49.720]  choice a mike huckabee can't make it and therefore you should vote for donald trump since he's
[03:38:49.720 --> 03:38:55.960]  elevating your choice does this even mean that there's an endorsement in the works very hard to
[03:38:55.960 --> 03:39:02.120]  say but uh the there's no question here that he's grabbed the moment that he has stolen the show
[03:39:02.120 --> 03:39:08.840]  yet again and this is to the consternation of ted cruz ted cruz can't get any traction his
[03:39:08.840 --> 03:39:16.280]  attempts to challenge trump to a one-on-one debate fell flat uh and in the meantime voters in iowa
[03:39:16.280 --> 03:39:23.480]  starting to look at the real ted cruz why for example in heidi cruz's wikipedia page is their
[03:39:23.480 --> 03:39:29.960]  service as deputy national security advisor to condoleaf the rice why is that missing why is
[03:39:29.960 --> 03:39:36.200]  her service as deputy trade representative to robert zealock uh handling china specifically
[03:39:36.200 --> 03:39:41.480]  why is that missing from her resume we know she works at goldman we know she's a member on the
[03:39:41.480 --> 03:39:48.440]  council on foreign relations we now know ted cruz got sweetheart secret loans from goldman in city
[03:39:48.440 --> 03:39:53.960]  bank this guy is going to reform wall street he's going to take on wall street i think liberty voters
[03:39:53.960 --> 03:39:59.720]  are beginning to wonder whether he's a trojan horse i agree with you he's been neck and neck in
[03:39:59.720 --> 03:40:04.760]  polls uh lately a few weeks ago a few points behind cruz and some polls cruises ahead and some
[03:40:04.760 --> 03:40:08.920]  polls trumps ahead i know you're a straight shooter i talked to you months ago and you said
[03:40:08.920 --> 03:40:14.760]  trump's got it everywhere but iowa uh but i still think he's gonna you know after that get new hamps
[03:40:14.760 --> 03:40:21.000]  from other states but but but iowa was the big one uh has he narrowed uh that gap or has he surpassed
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:27.320]  it from your political expertise running so many big elections very hard to say because the caucus
[03:40:27.320 --> 03:40:33.240]  is not a primary in a primary you just show up you go into the machine or the or the booth
[03:40:33.240 --> 03:40:38.280]  and you mark about it or you check off the name and you walk out a caucus is very different you've
[03:40:38.280 --> 03:40:43.560]  got to sit and listen to speeches for three hours and then you vote by a shell of hands so this is
[03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:49.560]  very much an organizational exercise i do know and this is incredible last night out of the phone
[03:40:49.560 --> 03:40:58.680]  bank in Des Moines as a random test they called 1000 democrat these are working class white working
[03:40:58.680 --> 03:41:04.920]  class suburban democrat they asked them two questions one did you vote for barack obama
[03:41:04.920 --> 03:41:12.040]  90 said yes when asked them would they come caucus for donald trump over 300 people said yes
[03:41:12.040 --> 03:41:17.240]  now in iowa you can just show up at the polls and change your registration right then and there by
[03:41:17.240 --> 03:41:23.080]  signing a form and then vote for donald trump this proves what i had been saying he has crossed
[03:41:23.080 --> 03:41:29.080]  over appeal in the general election uh and to the extent that iowa is up for grabs and it is
[03:41:29.080 --> 03:41:35.560]  very tight uh it could be swayed by an influx of conservative democrats coming over to uh
[03:41:35.560 --> 03:41:42.600]  make america great again now obviously she tried to make a name for herself even bigger
[03:41:42.600 --> 03:41:48.440]  megan kelly by making stuff about trump by being nasty uh but you've always been really honest with
[03:41:48.440 --> 03:41:52.120]  us i mean really that's just the excuse then is what you're saying or correct me if i'm wrong
[03:41:52.120 --> 03:41:57.480]  trump knows that he makes the debate he now only elevates these other candidates by himself being
[03:41:57.480 --> 03:42:02.280]  there he makes them five ten times the money in advertising he asked cnn to give some of the money
[03:42:02.280 --> 03:42:07.640]  to vets they said no before now he's leaving giving it all to the vets uh how could anybody
[03:42:07.640 --> 03:42:12.200]  say that this isn't just an act of genius it's also a really good thing to do with these greedy
[03:42:12.200 --> 03:42:17.480]  networks don't want to give money to the wounded warriors i mean shame on them especially fox news
[03:42:17.480 --> 03:42:22.040]  that takes so much advertising money from the wounded warriors they should be giving some of
[03:42:22.040 --> 03:42:26.600]  their time for advertising to the wounded warriors and i'm sorry but it's just a fact if you're not
[03:42:26.600 --> 03:42:31.960]  supporting trump and supporting uh the debate he's really having then you're actually trying to steal
[03:42:31.960 --> 03:42:37.240]  money from veterans and then i watched the media spin this and say trump wanted money or he wouldn't
[03:42:37.240 --> 03:42:44.040]  come lying bastards i'm sorry i'm sorry roger but it makes me mad well here here's the factoid
[03:42:44.040 --> 03:42:50.040]  that i think you'll enjoy alex a tv spot during this debate two days ago before trump announced
[03:42:50.040 --> 03:42:57.320]  his pullout was selling for 300 000 that same tv spot for a corporate advertiser is now going for
[03:42:57.320 --> 03:43:08.200]  70 in profit wow so uh you can see why bill o'reilly uh and uh sean hannity and much of the talent uh
[03:43:08.200 --> 03:43:14.600]  at fox that is friendly with trump are beseeching him to come to the debate i mean look watching
[03:43:14.600 --> 03:43:19.960]  the debate without trump would be watching the jackson five without michael i mean you might
[03:43:19.960 --> 03:43:26.440]  want to tune in for tito in germane but i doubt it wow well in the time we have left with you
[03:43:26.440 --> 03:43:30.680]  starting over very busy uh i heard from richard but is that accurate that you will be though on
[03:43:30.680 --> 03:43:37.240]  fox tonight uh and meghan kelly has invited me to come on post debate and give my analysis i must
[03:43:37.240 --> 03:43:42.680]  say she has always been fair to me she has always given me the opportunity to stand up for donald
[03:43:42.680 --> 03:43:48.040]  trump for which i am grateful because i'm just trying to reach the people so yes i will be on
[03:43:48.040 --> 03:43:54.920]  with meghan kelly tonight and you'll be able to hear a debate analysis from the uh from the trump
[03:43:54.920 --> 03:43:59.240]  perspective i mean i'll be honest i like fox news a lot more than the other networks because they
[03:43:59.240 --> 03:44:05.400]  cover more patriot based stuff um but at the same time they kind of want to run the liberty movement
[03:44:05.400 --> 03:44:10.040]  not not grow it uh and then you've got the folks that own it you know involved with hillary and
[03:44:10.040 --> 03:44:14.920]  things so i you know they're trying to keep feet in both camps like the coke brothers and others
[03:44:14.920 --> 03:44:19.800]  and then when she says things about donald trump that aren't true that was fine uh but at the same
[03:44:19.800 --> 03:44:24.040]  time um you know i think she's attractive i do think she's smart i know i don't think it's
[03:44:24.040 --> 03:44:29.240]  meghan kelly at the same time but let's just face it she does have some anti-gunners on
[03:44:29.240 --> 03:44:34.040]  she probably is a closet liberal in my view and that's fine i just think she should be honest
[03:44:34.040 --> 03:44:37.800]  about the fact and i think the fact that she doesn't like trump only makes him that much
[03:44:37.800 --> 03:44:42.040]  stronger i mean i think that's why he continues to rise in the polls separately sir you're the
[03:44:42.040 --> 03:44:46.840]  political expert i i'm just a guy that you know studies globalism in general and what's happening
[03:44:46.840 --> 03:44:52.040]  looking nationally past iowa if he wins by a few points what happens if he loses by a few points
[03:44:52.040 --> 03:44:55.880]  i mean i look at a wide range of scientific polls as you do it just appears he just keeps
[03:44:55.880 --> 03:45:02.840]  widening his lead uh more and more and i know at davos the major globalists were in the news
[03:45:02.840 --> 03:45:07.880]  in the financial times of london the editor saying quote the super elite must stop him
[03:45:07.880 --> 03:45:13.800]  internationally must give money i mean when foreign newspapers are saying the elite need to stop
[03:45:13.800 --> 03:45:18.040]  trump and and do anything that is the biggest endorsement of trump because when a newspaper
[03:45:18.040 --> 03:45:22.920]  endorses somebody and it's establishment i don't like them having the times of london say we must
[03:45:22.920 --> 03:45:28.840]  stop trump i mean that is the biggest endorsement i could imagine well i could pay alex i i know the
[03:45:28.840 --> 03:45:33.800]  dc wall street crowd i've been in american politics 40 years i eat with these people i drink with
[03:45:33.800 --> 03:45:40.040]  these people i prefer it when they pay they are wetting their pants over the prospect of a donald
[03:45:40.040 --> 03:45:45.080]  trump presidency because all their globalist plans for world government and regional government
[03:45:45.080 --> 03:45:51.800]  go out the window uh in trump they have somebody completely unviable and and someone who cannot
[03:45:51.800 --> 03:45:58.120]  and will not be bullied as he is demonstrating to uh fox news at this very moment i think he's the last
[03:45:58.120 --> 03:46:05.080]  best chance to save this country uh in this inextrable march towards one world government uh this is
[03:46:05.080 --> 03:46:11.640]  our best shot now i don't argue as i did in the fox opinion page this week that he's a pure conservative
[03:46:11.640 --> 03:46:19.320]  he's not i do argue he is the best choice for conservatives and liberty minded voters in 2016
[03:46:19.320 --> 03:46:25.080]  there's a difference i don't care about purity i care about integrity uh and somebody's gonna
[03:46:25.080 --> 03:46:30.040]  stand up for the u.s constitution and our sovereignty and the only candidate i see who's really
[03:46:30.040 --> 03:46:37.320]  going to do that who can win is donald trump uh it is uh this national review view this national
[03:46:37.320 --> 03:46:42.600]  review revolt against trump number the fellows who sign that that agreement or friends of mine
[03:46:42.600 --> 03:46:48.120]  or that manifesto are friends of mine uh but they're pure they're intellectual i'm in the business
[03:46:48.120 --> 03:46:53.880]  of getting people elected only trump can be hillary clinton because only trump will get right up in
[03:46:53.880 --> 03:47:00.200]  her grill on on her abuse of women on the master sure that's why the establishment doesn't want
[03:47:00.200 --> 03:47:06.200]  him there and separately with the fbi indictments uh they're reporting the fbi is going to go public
[03:47:06.200 --> 03:47:10.120]  if they the just department doesn't move for indictment they're clearly brought sanders the
[03:47:10.120 --> 03:47:15.640]  white house now uh they've got biden being brought out of deep freeze uh looks like they're starting
[03:47:15.640 --> 03:47:21.560]  to panic or is that hype what's your inside baseball roger stone i think she's in deep
[03:47:21.560 --> 03:47:26.440]  trouble even with her own the democrats have never liked the yoke of the clinton's they accepted
[03:47:26.440 --> 03:47:32.040]  it because they had to we know that there's animosity between obama and bailiary carat and
[03:47:32.040 --> 03:47:38.040]  the clinton's uh comry the fbi director is a straight shooter career law enforcement man
[03:47:38.040 --> 03:47:44.360]  he's going to make his recommendation public i cannot believe that if the justice department
[03:47:44.360 --> 03:47:51.000]  doesn't choose to prosecute hillary for her myriad of crimes that he will resign causing a fire storm
[03:47:51.560 --> 03:47:58.440]  you've now got 125 fbi agents pouring over the clinton foundation ours the clinton foundation
[03:47:58.440 --> 03:48:05.320]  is a flush fund for grifters this is a two billion dollar global fraud and growing every day what the
[03:48:05.320 --> 03:48:10.440]  what they've done now at the club at the clinton foundation is to open subsidiaries in a number
[03:48:10.440 --> 03:48:15.800]  of countries that have no transparency or reporting requirements and their charitable laws so they
[03:48:15.800 --> 03:48:21.400]  can wash millions of dollars to canada for example total racketeering total transparent
[03:48:21.400 --> 03:48:27.400]  absconding with the record i mean it's so naked she's been caught in triplicate in the emails how
[03:48:27.400 --> 03:48:33.560]  to cut off top secret off the top or classified said she didn't have more perjury to congress i mean
[03:48:34.280 --> 03:48:39.400]  why aren't they frying her politically already i mean she makes nixon look like an angel
[03:48:40.200 --> 03:48:45.640]  yeah it's amazing and i i think you've got the scenario exactly right they they knock her out
[03:48:45.640 --> 03:48:49.400]  of the way the establishment types knock her out of the way because they know she cannot beat
[03:48:49.400 --> 03:48:55.400]  trump uh and they substitute this bumbler joe biden well don't think we can't beat him too this
[03:48:55.400 --> 03:48:59.720]  guy's pathetic he's running for president twice before and he didn't even get out of the team
[03:49:00.760 --> 03:49:06.120]  uh so i think that their party is going to be in disarray now you have the question of whether
[03:49:06.120 --> 03:49:10.440]  the american people want four more years of what they've had for eight years and the answer is no
[03:49:11.080 --> 03:49:15.400]  teller he's forced to embrace obama to win the democratic nomination but that's the kiss of
[03:49:15.400 --> 03:49:21.960]  death in a race against down from in what is a change election people want a radical change in
[03:49:21.960 --> 03:49:29.160]  direction in this country they do and i tell you uh i just absolutely love donald trump and i'm
[03:49:29.160 --> 03:49:34.600]  going to be voting for him uh not just in the primary from the general election because he
[03:49:34.600 --> 03:49:38.360]  genuinely has scared the elite it's not theater they're putting all their money against him and
[03:49:38.360 --> 03:49:42.440]  running around like chickens with their heads cut off and if we just keep working in the system
[03:49:42.440 --> 03:49:47.480]  we're going to lose we've got to do the right thing justice be done may the heavens fall
[03:49:47.480 --> 03:49:52.040]  and put trump in there when i like about trump is he said a lot of bad stuff over the years he
[03:49:52.040 --> 03:49:56.280]  admits i was a businessman i was focused on working in the system now they're destroying my country i'm
[03:49:56.280 --> 03:50:00.600]  fighting is the growth curve of his knowledge and when he says something that's wrong he comes back
[03:50:00.600 --> 03:50:05.400]  says no i've changed my view here's why and then it's right and he doesn't back down he's very
[03:50:05.400 --> 03:50:13.400]  presidential uh and uh he's sophisticated and and he wants to make america great he isn't a globalist
[03:50:13.400 --> 03:50:17.880]  that wants to sell out america for international power you know there is no power internationally
[03:50:17.880 --> 03:50:23.640]  it's illusion the whole world is in deep trouble we need america to be strong and and he's the only
[03:50:23.640 --> 03:50:30.680]  one that does that and you know ted Cruz i like ted Cruz on many fronts but his pedigree is globalist
[03:50:30.680 --> 03:50:36.600]  and i'll forgive that we're going to skip this network break i will i will i will i will forgive
[03:50:36.600 --> 03:50:42.440]  that because he has some good votes in the senate but it doesn't mean i still completely trust him
[03:50:42.440 --> 03:50:47.800]  and so that's what i'm getting at is the fact that the system is so scared of trump for real
[03:50:47.800 --> 03:50:52.520]  because i'm a media analyst i know what something's real and when it's not tells me he's the guy to go
[03:50:52.520 --> 03:50:56.200]  for i want to spend a few more minutes with you mr stohn i know you have to go that's why i skip this
[03:50:56.200 --> 03:51:01.160]  break but anthony gucciardi any points you've got any questions for mr stohn because you're digging
[03:51:01.160 --> 03:51:06.440]  into this political analysis as well absolutely i think regardless of what you think it's amazing
[03:51:06.440 --> 03:51:10.440]  that they always say oh you're a flip-flopper when you advance your thinking on something like you're
[03:51:10.440 --> 03:51:14.920]  not allowed to grow and understand something and advance your thought patterns and your political
[03:51:14.920 --> 03:51:19.240]  ideology right so when someone attacks you using your past example of that is of course the issue
[03:51:19.240 --> 03:51:24.280]  with abortion there is no question whatsoever that trump and his wife used to be pro-abortion
[03:51:24.840 --> 03:51:31.000]  then they had a child late in life bearing trump and they cherish that child that changed their
[03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:37.240]  entire world view a movement that doesn't accept converts is doomed exactly i don't care i don't
[03:51:37.240 --> 03:51:42.920]  care what he fought 15 years ago i care what he thinks today today don't trump is a hundred percent
[03:51:42.920 --> 03:51:47.400]  pro-life now the liberals won't give him the benefit of the doubt if he if he had switched
[03:51:47.400 --> 03:51:52.360]  from being pro-abortion to be uh pardon me anti-abortion to pro-abortion he'd be a hero
[03:51:53.000 --> 03:51:57.960]  that's a perfect example well i've got a good feeling for things not just politically but in
[03:51:57.960 --> 03:52:04.200]  my gut watching it and i can literally see that trump has grown a lot all of us grow he says he's
[03:52:04.200 --> 03:52:08.680]  grown uh you know it's like loose fair con you know said i've grown i don't want to be like i was
[03:52:08.680 --> 03:52:12.600]  and i've i've woken up and he listens to my show and i've changed him you know trump sees what's
[03:52:12.600 --> 03:52:16.920]  happening because the internet he's now learning all these political things his stone i mean i mean
[03:52:16.920 --> 03:52:25.080]  i met stone like 10 years ago at at at anti-globalist meetings uh at uh jfk events he's a top jfk
[03:52:25.080 --> 03:52:30.120]  writer and i didn't realize that it was the roger stone that was the famous political guy i knew he
[03:52:30.120 --> 03:52:34.680]  and then i kind of looked at whoa you know it's like this guy is fighting the establishment coming
[03:52:34.680 --> 03:52:40.040]  out of it you know because now there's more of us now we can do it now we can do it outside the
[03:52:40.040 --> 03:52:45.240]  system we can take over the system and so many people mainly because the control of the churches
[03:52:45.240 --> 03:52:50.040]  by the ford foundation and by the rockefeller brothers foundation the world council of churches
[03:52:50.040 --> 03:52:55.160]  teaching them you can't win evil's gonna take over you can never fix anything you're powerless
[03:52:55.160 --> 03:53:00.200]  okay let's just lay down and wait for the rapture i mean give me a break folks my whole life i fought
[03:53:00.200 --> 03:53:04.920]  whether it was bullies or then in radio or whatever it is and i fought i've been just as
[03:53:04.920 --> 03:53:09.720]  smart as the bad guy or smarter i've beat him if you take action you work 18 hours a day you will
[03:53:09.720 --> 03:53:15.000]  win we can kick the globalist butts we can make this country free again we can move away from
[03:53:15.000 --> 03:53:21.160]  dystopia towards liberty not promising some utopia but it takes radical change radical
[03:53:21.160 --> 03:53:26.280]  aggression at the establishment and if trump gets elected and doesn't do what he said he's gonna do
[03:53:26.280 --> 03:53:32.360]  he will be crucified and he knows that so he wants to be george washington not benedict arnold
[03:53:32.360 --> 03:53:37.480]  i'm telling you i believe he wants to try to save this country with our help and stone you've
[03:53:37.480 --> 03:53:44.040]  known him for decades is that what's in your gut as well yeah look i've come a long way alexa i'm a
[03:53:44.040 --> 03:53:49.000]  sentimental republican i worked in the u.s senate i worked in the house i worked for three american
[03:53:49.000 --> 03:53:53.800]  presidents i worked on nine presidential campaigns it took me a while to figure out
[03:53:53.800 --> 03:53:59.080]  that both parties are in it together the two-party duopoly is selling this country down the river
[03:53:59.800 --> 03:54:04.440]  they slap each other on the back and go out to dinner as soon as they turn the tv cameras off
[03:54:04.440 --> 03:54:11.000]  it's a scam and it's all run on corporate money by the global giants down trump is broken up that
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:16.600]  whole narrative there's a lobbyist consultant class who've been running this country are petrified
[03:54:16.600 --> 03:54:21.720]  about the real reform that's it they've hijacked the country they don't know who he is they're not
[03:54:21.720 --> 03:54:26.840]  sure they just know he wants to cut their system off and they don't like it so you want the crooks
