[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.520]  The left-wing lunatics are trying very hard to bring back COVID lockdowns and mandates
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.040]  with all of their sudden fear-mongering about the new variants that are coming.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.040]  But to every COVID tyrant who wants to take away our freedom, hear these words, we will
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.640]  not comply.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.160]  California and New York, two captured states on each end of the country, have officially
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.900]  rolled out new COVID protocols and mandates on their websites and said that indeed they're
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.160]  bringing back the controls.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.280]  But we really caught them with their pants down almost two weeks ago with the whistleblower
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.280]  info.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got a call yesterday, an individual was in town and they are a
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.720]  high level manager in the TSA.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.240]  Tuesday, we got called in, the managers, and told that by the middle of September,
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.200]  you all have to wear a mask again and so will airport employees.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.720]  Then by the middle of October, they are going to say that everyone flying has to
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.720]  wear a mask.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.640]  Well, I mean, why is this happening?
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.600]  They said, well, because of the new variant in Canada.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.440]  What?
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.320]  People who have had the vaccine are more susceptible to BA.2.A6.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.440]  What the actual shit?
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.880]  But I was sent by the whistleblower, a link to the California website, and it says the
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.160]  controls are back and here they are, right there in black and white.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.800]  They're going to roll them out.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.480]  And through the institutions and the corporations and the hospitals and the hotels, through
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.020]  the colleges, through the public schools, all over the country, they are shutting
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.140]  down public schools if there's one COVID case.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.820]  That's creating the lockdown by sending the children back home.
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.180]  That's the beginning of it.
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.900]  My sources, because I called around and confirm what the first source said, said
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.100]  middle of September, Biden is set to start the roll out.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.100]  Now, five, six days later.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.980]  The request for additional funding for a new vaccine does not mean that it's necessary.
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.780]  That works.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.780]  And ultimately, it is recommended that we would like to be recommended that everybody can.
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.100]  Joe Biden literally saying, y'all need to come, they need to come up with a new vaccine
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.980]  and they need to come up with a way that people have to take it no matter what.
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.860]  I'm willing to die about my freedom.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.660]  I'm willing to die about my medical independence.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.180]  So all I got to say to you in that video.
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.900]  Try this, go around and find out.
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.500]  FDA and CDC, they've made an announcement on the new vaccine.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.860]  So currently, they said that they will have and there'll be an updated vaccine in September, mid-September.
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.540]  There never was a COVID pandemic.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.180]  There never was a SARS-CoV-2 novel virus.
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.500]  There was never any of those things.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:06.900]  This was a behavior modification exercise to fulfill the objective of the financial interests that were being served.
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:14.220]  And let's remember that the quote, until a pandemic is at emergency threshold,
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:22.020]  the public doesn't understand the need for medical countermeasures such as a pan-coronavirus or pan-influenced vaccine.
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.900]  We need the media to create the hype.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.300]  We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.100]  Investors will follow if they see profit at the end of the process.
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.500]  That's a quote from Peter Daszak.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.460]  That's a quote that was made at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published in 2015.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.620]  This is the admission of terrorism again.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.940]  Now, what did I say they were told?
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.900]  The beginning of the announcements begins September 15th.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.980]  This was just the warming up and getting ready that just so happened to begin right after I announced it literally six hours later, everywhere.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.740]  They just opened up on the public, every controlled corporate outlet and then the institutions to create the fear.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.700]  You can stop all flights.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.900]  You can lock down entire countries.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.060]  You can actually do that.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:21.380]  And this, I would say, may make us more open to radical ideas about how to deal also with climate change.
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.220]  This has nothing to do with public health.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.140]  It has nothing to do with breaking any waves.
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.700]  It was always about breaking people.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.860]  There's the path of resistance or there is the path of total enslavement.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.500]  Come on, your ancestors were stronger than this.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.380]  You're stronger than this.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:52.660]  You can focus on the New World Order and its activities and you can ask God to lead, guide and direct you with discernment.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.540]  And you do that.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.900]  We're unstoppable together.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:09.060]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good news because it's a great product you love and people want it.
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.700]  And it funds our Operation 360 Win bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, the strongest you're going to find anywhere.
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:23.220]  Jam packed a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation, that empowers your neurological system, you name it.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.220]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.580]  God gave it to us and it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.100]  Other leading brands are like 70% humanoid.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.500]  Most brands are 5% human.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.780]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.700]  This is the strongest anybody makes 95% for humanoid.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.260]  I am so glad this is back.
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.180]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.060]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.

[00:10:03.873 --> 00:10:09.793]  let me just read to you the stacks i mean just the cupboard stack alone today
[00:10:11.713 --> 00:10:18.673]  is about 15 articles and reports and it's just unbelievable unbelievable uh new york is
[00:10:18.673 --> 00:10:23.233]  officially announcing new cover restrictions across the board being rolled out and drones to watch
[00:10:23.233 --> 00:10:31.553]  you um they now admit that the quote new booster for people to quote not get the new variant of
[00:10:31.553 --> 00:10:40.193]  covid was tested on 23 people we also have a big major federal ruling that hospitals and
[00:10:40.193 --> 00:10:47.633]  the fda and all of them are liable for trying to create law on their own something congress does
[00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:53.073]  not them just like when they shut down power plants you know at the epa that's not their
[00:10:54.033 --> 00:10:58.992]  they're right they're not even toxic court ruled two years ago they had to stop that they
[00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:03.873]  haven't stopped but at least the court ruled that it's a long process of the courts to now
[00:11:03.873 --> 00:11:09.073]  enforce that but we're turning the tide remember they said three years ago you can't prescribe
[00:11:09.073 --> 00:11:12.833]  ivermectin even if your doctor wants to doesn't matter how many studies he's got
[00:11:12.833 --> 00:11:20.593]  that's all birdcage liner will fire you or will will come after you if you do with the fbi
[00:11:21.153 --> 00:11:26.673]  no law no nothing just you can't prescribe a well-known antiviral whole bunch of new studies
[00:11:26.673 --> 00:11:31.313]  are out the australian government of all groups came out and said okay it works really
[00:11:31.313 --> 00:11:36.593]  great we're wrong they're now saying all over the world oh nobody ever locked you down nobody
[00:11:36.593 --> 00:11:42.033]  ever made you take a shot got a bunch of compilations of that i mean just this stack alone is
[00:11:43.073 --> 00:11:51.473]  bonkers then i just happened to run in today i did about five hours of research at the house
[00:11:52.752 --> 00:11:56.593]  on just on twitter alone just looking at video clips of the globalists and their statements
[00:11:56.593 --> 00:12:00.433]  they're making so many depopulation statements and so many you will eat the bug statements and
[00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:03.873]  so many we're going to put chips in your statements and so many pedophilia is good
[00:12:03.873 --> 00:12:10.833]  statements i mean i can't even keep track of it i've seen 30 plus clips today that i've never seen
[00:12:13.153 --> 00:12:20.033]  of Sean Penn and Yuval Noah Harari and Jane Goodall and King Charles and just just a whole
[00:12:20.033 --> 00:12:26.353]  list of criminals of just degenerate pigs saying oh the lockdown is just getting you
[00:12:26.353 --> 00:12:32.593]  ready for the climate lockdowns which Biden's getting ready to announce so this is just
[00:12:32.593 --> 00:12:37.793]  whacked out this is just amazing yeah we're going to take the cows we're going to turn
[00:12:37.793 --> 00:12:44.833]  your power off and it's i mean i've got like i looked at it we can't play this 15 minutes of
[00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:54.193]  them saying it that's what should make my job so easy is these bastards are and it's not
[00:12:54.193 --> 00:12:58.513]  somebody's fault if they didn't have a dad in their life bastards way too nice a term for them
[00:12:59.233 --> 00:13:04.193]  some of my best friends are bastards these cockroaches but cockroaches aren't bad
[00:13:04.193 --> 00:13:10.273]  compared to these people these literal demon creatures these these these these succubus
[00:13:11.313 --> 00:13:17.233]  so so i've got that and i'm maybe i'll just play a few of the clubs i've got just i just
[00:13:17.233 --> 00:13:21.553]  i just don't know uh it's an impossible job i mean how do you get ready like probably four
[00:13:21.553 --> 00:13:26.353]  hours yesterday and five hours a day and then try to present an hour before mtg gets in here
[00:13:26.353 --> 00:13:31.713]  but i guess we are presenting it uh but yeah they're official we're bringing back the code
[00:13:31.713 --> 00:13:37.793]  restrictions while they gaslight you'd say but we're not high schools the elementary
[00:13:37.793 --> 00:13:42.752]  shut down all over the country it was like two states two weeks ago you know it's like
[00:13:43.553 --> 00:13:49.313]  15 states this morning um really critical thing i want to get to first we'll come back for break
[00:13:51.153 --> 00:13:58.033]  they've hit the panic alarm the dnc has and said look trump is unstoppable basically
[00:13:58.913 --> 00:14:04.033]  everything we do blows up in our face he's got a powerful political movement donna brazil said
[00:14:04.033 --> 00:14:10.113]  which we don't need her to tell us that we are knowing and we're basically out of bullets
[00:14:11.073 --> 00:14:15.073]  political bullets that's why i said the real bullets come next and i don't set it to be
[00:14:15.073 --> 00:14:21.473]  dramatic it's an easy arc an easy graph like tucker carlson said they're gonna kill them
[00:14:22.193 --> 00:14:27.393]  they're gonna try and and that's where the adl comes in and the southern property law center
[00:14:27.393 --> 00:14:34.673]  and these people and these nazi groups that they've turned on everywhere that i mean are 100
[00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:38.913]  everybody's i mean literally 99 of the comments on instagram twitter i was i feel like an hour

[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:47.899]  starting about two and a half years ago once biden had fully ensconced himself over stealing
[00:20:47.899 --> 00:20:54.620]  the election the cia public coup against the voters of america to seize the republic fully
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:21:00.060]  and turned into a pure engine of evil i saw them brand their opposition as white supremacists
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:07.419]  and then defined a white supremacist as anybody that questions open borders or wars or lockdowns
[00:21:07.419 --> 00:21:14.980]  or forced injections or elections and i said then they're not doing a full branding and
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:20.860]  saying white supremism is this epic threat number one cause of crime number one crime
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.860]  in america when anybody knows that's like number one crime like maybe every six months a white
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:30.020]  supremacist goes and shoots some innocent black people it's terrible it happens just happened
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.939]  a few weeks ago but been like a year maybe since that happened i mean it's it's it's
[00:21:33.939 --> 00:21:40.220]  rare okay still terrible and you can just look at it and there's thousands of other
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:45.699]  data points you're like okay they're gonna blow some stuff up or shoot a bunch of people
[00:21:45.699 --> 00:21:53.620]  black colleges black grocery stores neighborhoods churches and then i even saw this patriot
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:59.379]  front fed group one day when i was down by the park with my daughter i took her to
[00:21:59.379 --> 00:22:03.220]  martin springs about two months ago and we're leaving and i wasn't going to pull my phone
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.219]  out while we were in traffic because it was dangerous pulling out but i saw like five trucks
[00:22:07.219 --> 00:22:11.699]  shoot by with all them in the back of it and i'm just like i later looked it up and they've
[00:22:11.699 --> 00:22:16.340]  been here running around agitating people in east austin messing with the brown people
[00:22:17.139 --> 00:22:22.980]  i mean it's just the feds are disgusting people folks and this new group they've got
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:31.060]  i mean absolute hollywood ridiculous demon devil outfits they wear i mean they're basically
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:36.340]  wearing red pajamas these red and black outfits with huge swastikas saying the most
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:41.460]  ridiculous crap and then i spent an hour researching them and oh this that one guy's
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:47.620]  a cia operative in ukraine and a captain and then another guy is a known you know connected
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:53.139]  to the cia and then another guy and a whole bunch of them are are convicts and they get
[00:22:53.139 --> 00:22:58.659]  told you go sign up you you work under these guys and we will we will not put you back in
[00:22:58.659 --> 00:23:05.060]  jail and that's all this is this is because when you go to prison folks they make you organize
[00:23:05.139 --> 00:23:10.500]  into black gangs hispanic gangs or white gangs and on the east and west coast where they have
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.139]  more asians it's asian gangs they put you on the asian wing the hispanic wing the black
[00:23:15.139 --> 00:23:18.740]  wing the white wing and and if you don't want to join one of those gangs you're black and not
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.179]  racist well they're gonna you know kill your ass probably the same thing with the white
[00:23:22.179 --> 00:23:26.820]  people so you basically have to join these gangs where they put you in solitary confinement
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.940]  and a lot of people say i'm not joining the nazis so they go okay you're in solitary
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.699]  confinement so they've got armies of these lunatics
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:39.460]  just like the black israelites and just in the mecha people it's all the exact crap
[00:23:41.699 --> 00:23:46.020]  it's a rerun of it and then i mean i spent an hour and it's it's
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:52.100]  they're commanders in ukraine highland hitler we have all the video i got like eight videos of
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:24:01.620]  this so the problem is to do a deep dive the public is so ignorant about this it's viral on
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:06.500]  twitter jones claims the adl is the most nazi organization he's ever seen in modern history
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:12.580]  why that's ridiculous so the adl is a leading jewish civil rights organization
[00:24:15.139 --> 00:24:19.219]  man you want the deep dive on that that would take about 10 hours just on the adl
[00:24:22.899 --> 00:24:28.100]  censoring people spying on people the adl southern primary law center particularly have been caught
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:34.020]  funding and creating and running white supremacist groups the southern primary law center ran the
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:40.419]  white supremacist training camp in elohim city that then was with mcveigh as the patsy in
[00:24:40.419 --> 00:24:46.260]  oklahoma city go look it up came out in court they killed police officers that have interviewed
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.179]  killed police officers that have interviewed their families and exposed this murdered them
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.860]  that's a whole that that's like dozens of interviews i did years ago with all the witnesses
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.620]  i've been there i've shown it came out in federal court so the average liberal goes what
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:07.940]  do you mean the adl is working with nazis that's dumb everybody's probably seen episode
[00:25:08.659 --> 00:25:14.899]  three of star wars the prequel where senator palpatine is running the opposition
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:21.940]  military that's attacking them and he's running the resistance to it and he uses that to take
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:28.740]  full control i mean it's in a children's movie how this works and people better get i mean come
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:37.780]  on folks crazy dudes in in in red devil outfits and you remember the famous photos
[00:25:38.419 --> 00:25:42.100]  you know after january 6 of some of the rallies in dc and people would look at them
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.260]  and they'd go oh my god these are all feds and then they face scanned them you can do that
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:53.139]  with google images and found most of them are fbi agents now the fbi agents you can tell they
[00:25:53.139 --> 00:25:57.860]  look yuppie they look like they go on you know 100 mile bike rides they're just told to
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.179]  go out there and quote be a cover as white supremacists that still creates the illusion of
[00:26:02.179 --> 00:26:08.659]  white supremacists being everywhere but with the the patriot front that's feds too all wearing
[00:26:08.659 --> 00:26:13.699]  masks with some useful idiots under them to create the illusion of white supremacy work but this
[00:26:13.699 --> 00:26:22.020]  new group that i'm not going to have a ton of time to get into today i mean one investigation
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:26.740]  of that and i'm telling you and i knew it as soon as i saw him i said i bet they got
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:31.060]  training camps shut up i bet they got massive funding and that's where they're getting the
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:37.940]  lunatics in that are going to be the ones that go after trump slash biden and sure as hell they
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:47.540]  got training camps in maine they got training camps in pennsylvania so i mean okay come on
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.980]  i've been telling you they're gonna have some white supremacists killed by
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:56.899]  and then say all of us are behind it you think january 6 is bad that's just a dress rehearsal
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:04.500]  show everybody better look into this you better research it you better know it and let me tell
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.620]  you one look at these people and i did a little over an hour just watching their videos looking
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:14.740]  up who they were and you have a couple fed psychologists that are controlling it
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.940]  you've got people they're threatening to put in prison that are the leaders if they don't play
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:28.980]  ball with the globalists and then you've got mentally ill prisoners who are trained to be
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.620]  white supremacists in prison and they're going to find the lunatics folks who will be the
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:38.340]  patsies when they in my view detonate a car bomb or truck bomb or something to kill by
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:47.379]  so as soon as i saw this i went that's it it was like the alarms went off i was like oh my
[00:27:47.379 --> 00:27:53.300]  god that that's that's it and this is just the newest group they have pop up like herpes
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:57.379]  it won't go away so
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.139]  i mean i was already sure of it you can see all the pre-preparation all the brainwashing
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:14.419]  it is going down okay and the good news is people across the political spectrum are waking
[00:28:14.419 --> 00:28:18.820]  up and getting this and i noticed today i said it an hour on the side more than an hour just
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:23.699]  because i saw it everywhere else probably an hour and a half recently the black folks completely
[00:28:23.699 --> 00:28:28.100]  see through this i mean i did not see one major black poster that was not just one look at this
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:32.179]  ridiculous crap this is what they've got now is we don't support trump i mean this is all
[00:28:32.179 --> 00:28:39.060]  you can come up with i mean come on man give me a break here this is this is so stupidly
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:45.139]  obvious how stupid do you think we are we're all getting screwed over with poison shots and open

[00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:43.770]  not a game Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[00:33:43.770 --> 00:34:05.490]  of the info war Alright, so here's the bottom line, the globalists are in trouble, they
[00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:09.850]  know they're losing the public, they're losing the people all over the world, they are desperate
[00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:17.170]  for a whole cornucopia of cyber attacks and wars and collapsing borders and famines and
[00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:21.250]  they're running it all, the UN ran three plus years of lockdowns in the third world, mass
[00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:24.810]  starvation 80 plus million died, not even a blip on the radar street, now they say there's
[00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:30.690]  a global food crisis, the third world is descending into hell, the UN's organizing
[00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:38.610]  them all to come into the US, we're being hit from all sides and the perfect way to
[00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:44.290]  energize the left and to go after the less political opposition saying we're all white
[00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:49.670]  supremacists and turn homeland security loose on us, they're being publicly trained to just
[00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:54.390]  say any opposition is illegal, they want to outlaw their political opposition, have
[00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:58.930]  a one party system is to kill Joe Biden, that way they get rid of him, they turn
[00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:04.090]  him into a martyr and then they can put in whoever they want and kill Trump and they
[00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:09.970]  believe that that will basically shut down their opposition and when the Trump people
[00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:14.930]  get mad, the left will just detonate truck bombs and things and say the right wing did
[00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:19.010]  it because of Trump being assassinated and use that as a pretext to bring in absolute
[00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:23.930]  total martial law, total censorship, total control, they're going for broke, all the
[00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:28.450]  lockdowns, all the poison shots, all the censorship, that was a dress rehearsal,
[00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:34.910]  that was nothing, that was nothing. Now the reason I'm saying this even though it
[00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:39.290]  endangers my life is it's true, you can see the writing on the wall, you can see
[00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:45.250]  all the pieces in place but we win by telling the truth either way because if we
[00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.850]  expose them and get out ahead of this like the new lockdowns I told you were coming,
[00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:57.530]  the new controls which are here just like I told you, if they do kill Biden and or
[00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:01.970]  Trump or try because the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray,
[00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:08.930]  people are going to remember this broadcast and no matter what they do,
[00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:12.770]  put it on a thumb drive, show people in person at your church, they're going to be
[00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:17.090]  listening when this goes down and I'd say 50% chance we can stop this,
[00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:21.810]  the very good chance you're going to get front row seats for this, they're going to turn
[00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:25.930]  your power off, they're going to release new bioweapons way worse than COVID,
[00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:30.370]  this is it, this is the takeover of America and the world, this is the new world order,
[00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:35.650]  this is it and I'm not going to back down, I'm not going to cut back my rhetoric
[00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:43.490]  because this is the truth. Now I tried this myself today and we're going to do a
[00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:49.170]  demonstration tomorrow on air, it's true, let me try to reprogram it in the meantime
[00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:54.530]  but Alexa is an AI system and it's programmed by the hundreds of millions or billions,
[00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:58.690]  it's like a billion users, Google's like 4 billion, Apple's like 4 billion,
[00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:06.610]  I think Alexa's over a billion with Amazon, the point is that you ask Alexa as of today,
[00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:14.570]  Alexa what's going to happen with 2024 election and it says there will be no election
[00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:20.530]  and I've had people at the gas station two days ago, I got a bunch of text messages and calls
[00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:23.970]  and my wife asked me about it because her friends and people are asking her,
[00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.770]  and we had some friends over at the house last night, they were asking me about it,
[00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:34.370]  so the buzz is out there that there won't be a 2024 election, now I'm not saying that's going
[00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:39.850]  to happen, I'm saying we're not in normal situation anymore, we're not in Kansas as they
[00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:45.970]  say anymore, truth has never worked. So before I get to DNC chair Donna
[00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:51.210]  Brazil and the rest of this and then MTG coming up at studio, she's arriving very soon,
[00:37:51.210 --> 00:38:01.530]  let's play the clip I just talked about with Alexa, where the man asked the machine
[00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:10.210]  yesterday what's happened with 2024 election. Hey, want to hear some fucked up shit, Alexa?
[00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:18.370]  2024 American election will not take place, there will be no winner.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:37.560]  I'm not sure what the crew's doing with this clip because the clip I sent them, A, we have to bleep stuff, but B, he says it and then it says it. Can we re-download that and then do that again?
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:50.560]  No, no, no problem. I understand. I sent the clip today. Maybe it was not on my list. That's fine.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.560]  Just a moment.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.560]  I have to go rebroadcast for a few minutes.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:17.560]  Yes, play some promos or something, okay? Alright, we can't play promos either.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.560]  Okay.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:16.560]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:22.560]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:32.560]  The left have wised up to this. If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it, the social media giants, and they are.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:38.560]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:43.560]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:50.560]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist...
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:56.560]  ...guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:03.560]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:14.560]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.560]  People know what's true. They can smell it.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.560]  Infowars, the most banned network.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.560]  The Alex Jones Show, there is a war on for your mind.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:34.560]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful, and I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:43.560]  Because I've had chills since last night. This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:55.560]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:03.560]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines and the hell we're already living in.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.560]  This is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.560]  But that story is up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.560]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.560]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:30.560]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.560]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:43.560]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:51.560]  Because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.560]  I know why. Because it's scary.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.560]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.560]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.560]  You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:25.560]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:35.560]  The only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.560]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.560]  It should take over your life.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.560]  I mean, what else? What else could it do?
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:54.560]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the control corporate media has been putting out for decades.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:59.560]  Ahead of their opening of unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.560]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:12.560]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.560]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:20.560]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:28.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:42.560]  The year is 1995 and Infowars launches the last of America's counter globalist probes.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:56.560]  In a freak mishap, Infowars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to earth 25 years later.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.560]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.560]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.560]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:16.560]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic not knowing how to be men and women run around frantic not knowing how to be women.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:26.560]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.560]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:33.770]  This is reality.
[00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:35.770]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:37.770]  We know the government's planning terrorism.
[00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:40.770]  We know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners.
[00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:43.770]  If you do it, we're going to blame you because we know who's up to it.
[00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:45.770]  The truth is out there in front of you.
[00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:47.770]  But they lay out this buffet of lies.
[00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:48.770]  I'm sick of it.
[00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:50.770]  And I'm not going to take a bite out of it.
[00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:51.770]  Do you got me?
[00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:53.770]  It's time to stop submitting to this charity.
[00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:55.770]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved.
[00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.770]  I want freedom.
[00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:58.770]  That's what I want.
[00:45:58.770 --> 00:45:59.770]  That's what you should want.
[00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:01.770]  I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up.
[00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:03.770]  This isn't a game.
[00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:07.770]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:09.770]  If you want to come and take them.
[00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:14.770]  I don't like putting chemicals in the water to turn the friggin' frogs gay.
[00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:23.770]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:50.690]  We are in a crisis.
[00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:53.950]  Admitting it, admitting our government has been seized by corrupt globalist corporations
[00:46:53.950 --> 00:47:00.750]  that our intelligence agencies are fully controlled is the beginning of taking our country back.
[00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:05.030]  And all the numbers, all the facts show a huge global worldwide awakening.
[00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.070]  We're going to break in about 12 minutes.
[00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.190]  Margie Teller Green is going to be in studio with us.
[00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.710]  I was walking right back in the studio, I saw her in there, can't wait to have her
[00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:17.150]  here with us tonight in studio.
[00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:18.990]  So let's start going to these clips.
[00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:23.750]  Former DNC chair Donna Brazile sounds alarm on MAGA movement.
[00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:27.910]  I've never seen anything like this with Donald Trump.
[00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:31.830]  Listen to what she had to say today.
[00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:36.070]  But I have to say something because George, I'm old enough to say this.
[00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:40.870]  I've seen two movements outside of the social justice movements in my life on the political
[00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:41.870]  side.
[00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:43.230]  One was the Reagan movement.
[00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:47.830]  Reagan had a hold on his base, the country at large.
[00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:51.790]  They saw him as someone who was willing to stand up for American values, whatever
[00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:52.790]  that might have meant.
[00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:54.870]  Now, I thought it was reactionary.
[00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:58.710]  The other movement I saw was Barack Obama, hope and change.
[00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:01.750]  That galvanized the American people.
[00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:05.270]  Thing like this with Donald Trump, I mean, what doesn't kill you make you stronger.
[00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:08.750]  I mean, being convicted, I mean, being indicted.
[00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:14.350]  That's making them stronger, raising $10 million, using an ugly mugshot to raise money.
[00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:15.630]  This is a movement.
[00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:19.870]  And anyone who thinks that you can apply the old political rules to try to defeat
[00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:24.870]  this candidate based on he's scary, he's ugly, whatever you might want to call him.
[00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:25.870]  This is a movement.
[00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:29.110]  And we have to respect the fact that it's a movement.
[00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:30.270]  Donna Brazile is wrong.
[00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:31.550]  This is a lot bigger than a movement.
[00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:36.029]  This is a global fourth turning political realignment.
[00:48:36.029 --> 00:48:37.550]  Not just here, but all over the world.
[00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:39.110]  People are sick of BlackRock.
[00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:40.670]  They're sick of State Street.
[00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:41.750]  They're sick of the UN.
[00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:43.210]  They're sick of King Charles.
[00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.550]  They're sick of Klaus Schwab.
[00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:45.870]  They're sick of Bill Gates.
[00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:47.430]  They're sick to death.
[00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:50.990]  And they know they just put us under lockdowns and all these poison shots and all that's
[00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.990]  come out.
[00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.990]  And now they're trying to roll out new lockdowns.
[00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:57.710]  They already got us in a hot war with Russia.
[00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:58.850]  So lady, don't you get it?
[00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:00.390]  You could kill Trump tomorrow.
[00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:02.230]  This isn't going away.
[00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:04.350]  And every day you lose more people.
[00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:09.310]  And there's no amount of election fraud that's going to save you.
[00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:17.310]  The Republican Party has a beachhead in it of populists led by Trump and MTG and Jim
[00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:23.170]  Jordan and Senator Hawley and a few others.
[00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.470]  But that's just a manifestation of our awakening.
[00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.150]  I mean, I look at Joe Rogan on the air we go to dinner.
[00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:29.390]  He's completely awake.
[00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:31.830]  He's as hardcore as I am.
[00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:34.230]  Look at what James Woods is putting out now.
[00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:37.390]  There's a global government wants to enslave us and poison us and kill us.
[00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:40.990]  I mean, that sounds crazy, but it's true.
[00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:48.029]  And I go back just a few years ago when everybody was turning their back on me, but MTG just
[00:49:48.029 --> 00:49:50.630]  got in Congress and she said, Alex Jones is right.
[00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:51.990]  Alex Jones is a great guy.
[00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:54.590]  I don't care what they say about him, it's lies.
[00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:58.150]  She knew it was bigger than me, but they were using me as a symbol to demonize populism
[00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:02.670]  and she knew to stand up for it.
[00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:03.670]  It's the same thing.
[00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:05.230]  Stop running from the truth, everybody.
[00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:10.790]  And I know the general audience isn't doing that, but if you ask Alexa, for some reason
[00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:12.630]  we import the video over and over again, it won't play.
[00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:13.630]  It's got some bug in it.
[00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.470]  We're going to find it later somewhere else to play it or put it in post when it goes
[00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:17.870]  to be in that video.
[00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:20.710]  You ask Alexa, you ask the AI, Hey, is there going to be election?
[00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:24.510]  No, there will not be an election and the democratic party will have war with Russia
[00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:26.750]  and become a dictatorship.
[00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:31.590]  And you go, well, Alexa isn't God, but it's AI and it picks up what is the most
[00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:33.830]  popular thing on the internet.
[00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:40.029]  It samples billions of conversations and texts every day, conservatively, probably more than
[00:50:40.029 --> 00:50:41.029]  that.
[00:50:41.029 --> 00:50:45.790]  I mean, just America's hundreds of millions of people using it a day, thousands of clicks.
[00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:50.830]  I mean, it's gotta be like billions upon billions and billions of things that sampled
[00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:54.150]  and it's saying no election.
[00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:56.070]  Now I'm not saying that's the case.
[00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:58.630]  I'm simply saying these people are done.
[00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:59.870]  They're cornered rats.
[00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:03.590]  It's come out that the prosecutor in Georgia is getting all this out of state, illegal
[00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:05.350]  money to her campaign, millions of dollars.
[00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:07.150]  You're like, well, that's illegal.
[00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:08.570]  They don't care.
[00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:09.830]  They're crooks.
[00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:16.390]  They've gone for broke and it just gets more insane by the minute.
[00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:23.470]  And suddenly there are all these white supremacy groups and these clown outfits running around
[00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.430]  while Biden says the number one threats, white supremacy and all these crazy groups
[00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:30.070]  pop up that are completely federal.
[00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:31.990]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:35.790]  And the deputy head of the group works for the CIA and brags about it and works in Ukraine
[00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:40.590]  and Hiles-Hitler.
[00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:44.310]  So we are vindicated and just like we got ahead in the last few weeks of their attempt
[00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:49.310]  to roll out the new COVID control, we can do this again now.
[00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:51.270]  But again, they can't stop Trump.
[00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:52.630]  So they'll want to assassinate him.
[00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:54.790]  That's always historically the next step.
[00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:56.230]  Follow the graph.
[00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:57.230]  Biden's a liability.
[00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:58.230]  He won't step down.
[00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:59.370]  Jill won't step down.
[00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:01.470]  They want to turn a liability into a plus.
[00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:02.950]  I believe they'll assassinate him.
[00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:05.130]  And I don't want that to happen.
[00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:08.390]  And I don't want violence and I don't endorse violence.
[00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:09.970]  We talk about a war on tyranny.
[00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:10.970]  It's cultural.
[00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:11.970]  It's spiritual.
[00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:12.970]  A war on Anheuser-Busch.
[00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:14.910]  It's pedophile crap.
[00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:16.529]  That means we go attack Anheuser-Busch.
[00:52:16.529 --> 00:52:17.529]  We don't want to.
[00:52:17.529 --> 00:52:20.490]  Or the drivers that drive the beer around, they're innocent.
[00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:26.310]  But we destroy the lie of men invading women's spaces and women's sports and targeting
[00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:31.310]  children with these trainee pedophile people.
[00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:34.910]  They say, oh, you say war against lies or info war.
[00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:37.230]  Yeah, information war is the answer.
[00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:40.590]  The truth is the antidote to the lies.
[00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:44.350]  Look at these headlines.
[00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:45.350]  Good news.
[00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:47.510]  Major federal court says, no, Ivermectin works.
[00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:48.510]  You can't block it.
[00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:52.070]  And the FDA had no power to run around and try to stop that, keeping you from getting
[00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:54.070]  a therapeutic.
[00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:58.310]  New Yorkers told to mask up for Labor Day as new COVID variant sparks fears and drones
[00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:00.190]  are going to be watching them.
[00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:07.510]  They'll be can't watch the border, but you can sure as hell harass the people.
[00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:12.390]  Major movie studios bring back the mask mandates, public schools all over the country canceling
[00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:13.390]  class.
[00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:17.070]  Colleges say you got to take the shot canceling class.
[00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:20.670]  As U.S. publications rise, will mask mandates return?
[00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:21.670]  NPR.
[00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:26.630]  Yes, they're trying to implement it now, but they don't want us to have a discussion
[00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:27.630]  about it.
[00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:32.230]  So in damage control in the U.S. media and the New Zealand media, the Australian media,
[00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:36.550]  the European media, the say, oh, nobody ever tried to make you wear a mask.
[00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.310]  Nobody ever tried to make you have a shot.
[00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:43.710]  I've got clip after clip to play for hours.
[00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:47.390]  Of here in the U.S., all the world's saying you take this shot or you're fired.
[00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:52.090]  They fired 70,000 health care workers in New York alone because they wouldn't take
[00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:56.550]  that experimentally legal shot.
[00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:58.270]  But that's why they want it censored.
[00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:03.050]  So when they tell new lies for old, we can't show them what they said before.
[00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:04.990]  That's what the censorship is about.
[00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:11.270]  It's election meddling, it's election theft, it's fraud.
[00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:13.370]  But I mentioned this earlier, so let's just play a few of these clips.
[00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:15.710]  I've got literally like 30 minutes of them.
[00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:21.670]  Here is Yuval Noah Harari, the head spokesperson for the WEF, saying, oh, the COVID lockdowns
[00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:23.390]  are a good test of things to come.
[00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:25.750]  And then Sean Penn saying the same thing.
[00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:27.830]  And then you read the documents and I've got a whole stack up here.
[00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:32.910]  They say, no, Biden said to announce a climate emergency and cut your resources off and
[00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:36.550]  tell you it's to save the earth is why you can't even get gasoline.
[00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:37.990]  What will that do the economy?
[00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:41.870]  You're like, well, he won't get reelected if he hurts the economy.
[00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:45.750]  He doesn't care, folks, because they're cratering the nation.
[00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:47.069]  This is economic war.
[00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:48.069]  Here's that clip.
[00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:51.090]  You can stop all flights.
[00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:54.210]  You can lock down entire countries.
[00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:56.529]  You can actually do that.
[00:54:56.529 --> 00:55:05.110]  And this, I would say, may make us more open to radical ideas about how to deal also
[00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:11.110]  with climate change that will ultimately get us out of this mess with a vaccine.
[00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:16.470]  But this is also a kind of, you know, we're going to have to take the silver linings
[00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:17.470]  on this.
[00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:23.029]  This is this is a mandatory rehearsal for things to come that we are going to have
[00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:27.930]  to deal with as a society.
[00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:29.870]  This is an introduction to things to come in.
[00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:32.130]  What did what did the WF say three years ago?
[00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:36.250]  They said next or climate lockdowns on their website.
[00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:37.430]  Then they start promoting it.
[00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:38.430]  And it trends.
[00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:39.430]  Alex shows us, right.
[00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:40.430]  He's psychic.
[00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:42.990]  They said they do it.
[00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:46.670]  And that's what's so frustrating is we need all of Congress.
[00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:50.330]  We need the governors, everyone to say, no, you're not cutting our pipelines off.
[00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:51.569]  No, you're not shutting down our refineries.
[00:55:51.569 --> 00:55:53.270]  They just keep blowing up and burning down.
[00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:54.569]  No, you're not shut down our farmland.
[00:55:54.569 --> 00:55:57.090]  No, you're not getting rid of our cows because they're already doing it in Europe and the
[00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:58.090]  Netherlands and Ireland.
[00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:00.569]  You're like, well, that sounds crazy.
[00:56:00.569 --> 00:56:02.350]  It is crazy, folks.
[00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:06.390]  This is economic war because they think you'll forget in a few years why you're so poor
[00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:08.230]  and got to get a universal basic income from them.
[00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:10.190]  By the way, we got the clip to finally work.
[00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:11.390]  It's not not our fault.
[00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:12.390]  Some weird thing with Internet clips.
[00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.390]  Sometimes they go on a computer.
[00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:14.390]  They won't work.
[00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:15.390]  Here's the clip of the guy.
[00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.390]  I did this today.
[00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:17.390]  It's true.
[00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:18.390]  It's true.
[00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:19.390]  It's true.
[00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:20.390]  It's true.
[00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:21.390]  It's true.
[00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:22.390]  It's true.
[00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:23.390]  It's true.
[00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:24.390]  It's true.
[00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:25.390]  It's true.
[00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:26.390]  It's true.
[00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:27.390]  It's true.
[00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:28.390]  It's true.
[00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:29.390]  It's true.
[00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:30.390]  It's true.
[00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:31.390]  It's true.
[00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:32.390]  It's true.
[00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:33.390]  It's true.
[00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:34.390]  It's true.
[00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:35.390]  It's true.
[00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:36.390]  It's true.

[01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:11.150]  the left-wing lunatics are trying very hard to bring back covid lockdowns and mandates with all
[01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:17.550]  of their sudden fear-mongering about the new variants that are coming but to every covid tyrant
[01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:24.430]  who wants to take away our freedom hear these words we will not comply california
[01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:30.750]  and new york two captured states on each end of the country have officially rolled out new covid
[01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:37.550]  protocols and mandates on their websites and said that indeed they're bringing back
[01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:42.430]  the controls but we really caught them with their pants down almost two weeks ago
[01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:48.110]  with the whistleblower info ladies and gentlemen i got a call yesterday an individual was in town
[01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:57.710]  and they are a high level manager in the tsa tuesday we got called in the managers and told
[01:00:57.710 --> 01:01:04.910]  that by the middle of september you all have to wear a mask again and so will airport employees
[01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:11.390]  then by the middle of october they are going to say that everyone flying has to wear a mask
[01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:16.590]  well i mean why is this happening they said well because of the new variant in canada
[01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:27.310]  what people who have had the vaccine are more susceptible to ba.2.a6 what the actual
[01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:33.790]  but i was uh sent by the whistleblower a link to the california website and it says
[01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:37.470]  the controls are back and here they are right there in black and white
[01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:41.230]  they're gonna roll them out and through the institutions of the corporations of the hospitals
[01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:47.790]  to the hotels through the colleges to the public schools all over the country they are
[01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:53.470]  shutting down public schools if there's one covid case that's creating the lockdown by sending
[01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:58.029]  the children back home that's the beginning of it my sources because i called around and
[01:01:58.029 --> 01:02:04.110]  confirmed what the first source said said middle of september biden is set to start the rollout
[01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:06.430]  now five six days later
[01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:23.630]  joe buying literally saying y'all need to come they need to come up with a new vaccine
[01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:28.750]  and they need to come up with a way that people have to take it no matter what i'm willing
[01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:34.590]  to die about my freedom i'm willing to die about my medical independence so all i got to
[01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:42.190]  say to you in that video try this around and find out fda and cdc uh they've made an announcement
[01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:47.390]  on the new vaccine uh so currently uh they said that they will have an there'll be an
[01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:52.350]  updated vaccine september mid-september there never was a covid pandemic there never was a
[01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:57.390]  sarcov-2 novel virus there was never any of those things this was a behavior modification
[01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:05.870]  exercise to fulfill the objective of the financial interests that were being served and let's remember
[01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:14.109]  that the quote until a pandemic is at emergency threshold the public doesn't understand
[01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:19.550]  the need for medical countermeasures such as a pan coronavirus or pain-influenced vaccine
[01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:25.710]  we need the media to create the hype we need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the
[01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:30.670]  real issues investors will follow if they see profit at the end of the process that's a quote
[01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:35.069]  from peter dashik that's a quote that was made at the proceedings of the nash academy of science
[01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:42.270]  is published in 2015 this is the admission of terrorism again now what did i say they were told
[01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:48.109]  the beginning of the announcements began september 15th this was just the warming up and getting
[01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:53.470]  ready that just so happened to begin right after i announced it literally six hours later
[01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:58.510]  everywhere they just opened up on the public every control corporate outlet and then the
[01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:06.990]  institutions to create the fear you can stop all flights you can lock down entire countries
[01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:12.910]  you can actually do that and this i would say may make us more open
[01:04:14.109 --> 01:04:21.550]  to radical ideas about how to deal also with climate change this has nothing to do with public
[01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:27.710]  health it has nothing to do with breaking any waves it was always about breaking people
[01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:32.350]  there's a path of resistance or there is the path of total enslavement
[01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:41.230]  come on your ancestors were stronger than this you're stronger than this you can focus
[01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:48.109]  on the new world order and its activities and you can ask god to lead guide and direct you

[01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:07.870]  months ago it's coming they need to first have some of these hearings investigations but you
[01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:11.230]  wanted to talk about because i just talked to you a few months ago before we went live
[01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:17.790]  what about what's coming next their climate lockdown so mtg you are here thank you so much
[01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:23.390]  thank you alex i really appreciate it well it's always what is the next thing right
[01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:29.550]  and what we see from marxism what we see from the left is is any kind of um movement
[01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:34.670]  that can capture the masses get them wrapped up so they have they put the emoji on their
[01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:39.950]  their their um on their social media so they can share it something they get behind they all
[01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:45.069]  donate their money they all get into the movement we saw it happen with blm we saw it happen
[01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:50.510]  with covid mask vaccines we saw it happen with ukraine they tried it with monkey pox we made
[01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:55.470]  fun of it and it failed they're trying to bring covid back but i really believe the next
[01:07:55.470 --> 01:08:01.230]  thing is going to be this this climate change crisis they're going to create it into an
[01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:06.750]  emergency and alex i want to talk about burning man for a minute we are watching uh you know
[01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:12.670]  from a distance there are approximately like 73 or 75 000 people and in nevada and they're
[01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:17.470]  locked in there from floods and i'm glad i was going to raise that they literally did a mock
[01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:22.270]  sacrifice and all this and then it flooded with these tornadoes and it was sorry go ahead
[01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:26.990]  well you know god has a way of making sure everyone knows who god is i'll say that about
[01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:34.590]  that but let's talk about what is happening these people so there's there's 73 75 000 people
[01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:40.030]  in nevada desert right now they're locked in they're not allowed to leave and they're
[01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:45.790]  basically probably being brainwashed that climate change is the cause of all of it
[01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:51.630]  and it's going to destroy the earth and they're they're feeling the panic and the media is
[01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:54.910]  saying that oh this is because you didn't know about climate change yes so what's going
[01:08:54.910 --> 01:09:00.030]  to happen alex it's the same thing same way they launch any kind of movement after this is
[01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:05.230]  over and burning man and these 75 000 people disperse and they go back home they're going
[01:09:05.230 --> 01:09:10.030]  to have these stories to tell and how terrible is and how we have to do everything possible
[01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:15.630]  to stop climate change it's caused by humans and it's carbon and it's the amount of carbon
[01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:21.309]  that we put out it's manufacturing it's our it's our gas and diesel engines it's it's you
[01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:27.070]  know agriculture i mean aoc wants to get rid of cattle even even population we have too many
[01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:31.309]  humans putting out too much carbon you're going to start hearing all this stuff and this is
[01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:37.710]  going to build and i believe this is the left's new lie they're going to put on the american people
[01:09:37.710 --> 01:09:42.830]  and try to get everyone behind and create it to where remember aoc and the left and many others
[01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:47.150]  said that the earth is going to literally explode in a ball of fire we're going to all
[01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:50.830]  die it's going to be the end of the world 2030 this is what they're brainwashing people
[01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:55.470]  to believe no i totally agree now biden says he's set to announce a new climate emergency
[01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:59.950]  the claw swap said three years ago they do after covet so they literally cut our resources
[01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:06.750]  off and make it fancy well let's be realistic though yes the climate changes it's been changing
[01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:12.110]  since the beginning of time since god created the earth the climate has changed and that is
[01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:18.750]  the reality because we live on our planet is is is moving it's rotating it's moving through
[01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:24.430]  the only constant has changed it always changes it rotates around the sun it moves through
[01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:30.830]  the galaxy our galaxy rotates through the universe of course our climate is going to change
[01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:35.710]  but does that mean people are causing it no does that mean we have to raise taxes just
[01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:40.510]  to stop it no absolutely not does that mean we have to bow down to a globalist government
[01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:47.389]  absolutely they can stop it anyways they can't stop it it's all the sun as you said so
[01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:52.910]  what's happening in congress because i know we're getting close to impeachment movements
[01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:57.309]  we know biden's a puppet but still we need to get them on the defense because that ties into
[01:10:57.309 --> 01:11:03.950]  these insane indictments of trump which even donna brazil admits has totally blown up in their face
[01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:12.910]  well so day one when i entered congress in january of 2021 on joe biden's first day in
[01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:18.990]  office i introduced articles of impeachment and i introduced those against joe biden because of
[01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:24.190]  ukraine because of barisma because we knew the truth we knew the truth a long time ago
[01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:28.430]  and i introduced those articles of impeachment this has been a movement i have been pushing
[01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:33.870]  since the time i came into congress this is why they kicked me off committees
[01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:39.470]  this is this is why they tried to politically destroy me but finally through our oversight
[01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:43.630]  investigations i'm on the oversight committee we have been investigating joe biden
[01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:47.630]  since the beginning of this congress and the amount of evidence we have produced
[01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:54.270]  has become so overwhelming now that even our republicans in congress that don't want to have
[01:11:54.270 --> 01:12:00.270]  anything to do with impeachment they are now we believe i believe we have enough votes to vote
[01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:06.830]  for impeachment inquiry when we go back uh here next week in september amazing elaborate on that
[01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:11.150]  and then what about impeachment of merit garland or i mean these people are a joke and you've
[01:12:11.150 --> 01:12:15.710]  got jack smith meeting secretly at the white house that's right so if everyone wants to
[01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:21.070]  know more information you can go to impeachmentteam.com impeachmentteam.com
[01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:23.950]  by the way i want to hear a record skip sound right now in everybody's mind
[01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:29.070]  slowly give this out because you're on the field you're a champion in the fight
[01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:33.630]  you are quarterbacking this you're getting this done you promised this months ago it's happening
[01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:38.190]  now people need to go to the site they need to tweet it they need to share it they need
[01:12:38.190 --> 01:12:42.190]  to get behind it so explain this to us okay so i've introduced articles of impeachment on
[01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:46.830]  joe biden i've introduced articles of impeachment on merit garland i've introduced articles of
[01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:53.309]  impeachment on christopher ray matthew graves who persecutes january 6 defendants pro-life
[01:12:53.309 --> 01:12:57.870]  protesters parents who hold their school board accountable that's matthew graves and i've
[01:12:57.870 --> 01:13:04.110]  introduced articles of impeachment against secretary alejandro mayorkas here's what's happening the
[01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:09.790]  amount of evidence alex is becoming so overwhelming just like here let me say this this is really
[01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:16.670]  important just like we can truly say at least i can truly say i believe the great awakening
[01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:22.670]  is occurring because because of truth people all over waking up and god is dividing people
[01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:26.830]  by the sheep and goats he is literally dividing us there's people that can't hear
[01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:29.870]  the truth right now and then there's people that are waking up over and over
[01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:37.550]  the amount of truth that is that is basically uh just coming out throughout congress is forcing
[01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:43.230]  the will of congress forcing the will of republicans republicans that wouldn't act before
[01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:49.630]  are now becoming willing to act and so i have a lot of encouragement and hope where we are
[01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:54.990]  going forward but at the same time i caution people at home to please have patience even
[01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:59.630]  though that's the hardest thing to have because i feel the same way as you do i want impeachment
[01:13:59.630 --> 01:14:04.750]  now and i want it on all these people but what we have to do is we have to continue to push
[01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:08.990]  so here's the good thing all of my colleagues that i work with they've been at home in their
[01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:12.910]  districts and they've had to hear from their constituents they've had to hear from the voters
[01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:17.389]  that sent them to washington and i hope to god they have been yelling at them but you
[01:14:17.389 --> 01:14:20.750]  said that most of you said we've got mccarthy about to do it he says now they're doing
[01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:25.389]  they're moving there he said he's ready you delivered again thank you i appreciate that
[01:14:25.389 --> 01:14:29.790]  in a way i get the point you've got to ripen it and have the investigations to show it all
[01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:34.110]  to make sure you have the votes right so here's the process let's explain it out in detail so
[01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:40.590]  everyone knows in the house of representatives we have 435 members of congress let's be clear
[01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:45.470]  in our system of three branches federalism is done to make it slow so a dictator can take
[01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:48.990]  take control so people get frustrated it takes time but that's how our system works
[01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:52.990]  absolutely we don't want it fast because imagine if it was split the other way we've
[01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:59.630]  already seen that they they impeach trump twice by abusing the system and and abusing power
[01:14:59.630 --> 01:15:10.750]  so 435 members of congress we have 222 republican members only 222 we have to have 218 yes votes to
[01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:16.830]  do anything in the house of representatives without 218 we fail on everything so you've
[01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:21.630]  got to overwhelmingly nail it we have to overwhelmingly now and here's kevin mccarthy
[01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:27.070]  has been there he's already been there he has spent time our oversight committee has spent time
[01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:34.270]  judiciary has spent time ways and means ways and means committee has spent time producing evidence
[01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:39.230]  investigating evidence and showing it through our committee work so that we can not only show the
[01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:46.270]  american people we can also show all of our colleagues everyone in congress to convince them
[01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:52.670]  look we have the evidence right now not to impeach literally just to ask the question that's what
[01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:58.990]  an impeachment inquiry is can we just ask the question are we willing to say can we peak
[01:15:58.990 --> 01:16:05.470]  and look for more evidence may we go further may we as congress united states house of
[01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:11.389]  representatives open an investigation every day we learn more every day we learn more and you
[01:16:11.389 --> 01:16:16.030]  will learn more you would not believe how much more there is to learn and we are finally at
[01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:21.550]  the point i can confidently say when we go back we will vote for an impeachment inquiry and
[01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:29.950]  alex i've said if we can't do it i cannot vote to fund this corrupt completely out of control
[01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:35.309]  over bloated 32 trillion dollar government that is in debt in debt by that much money i can't
[01:16:35.309 --> 01:16:41.150]  do it if we are not willing to even ask the question for an impeachment inquiry beautiful so
[01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:47.550]  what are the listeners here to make sure this gets accelerated call your representative the best
[01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:52.830]  thing you don't have to call my office i've been there since joe biden's first day in office
[01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:58.350]  call the other representatives call all of my colleagues call democrats and republicans
[01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:02.910]  and tell them you demand it tell them you demand it and that's what needs to happen
[01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:09.070]  uh shifting gears war gaming the enemy these indictments against trump have made him
[01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:12.990]  you know i played the clip for you to him on donna brazil says this is bigger than obama
[01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:17.150]  it's unstoppable it's not working what are we gonna do they're hitting the panic button which
[01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:20.910]  i kind of don't want because i want them to be arrogant instead they're not they're like
[01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:25.309]  whoa we're screwed looking at all the moving pieces here i know you know trump well how is he
[01:17:25.309 --> 01:17:30.190]  doing what are we going to support trump where do you see this going oh i see this getting a lot
[01:17:30.190 --> 01:17:35.790]  uglier and a lot worse before it ever gets better as a matter of fact i'm expecting um
[01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:39.550]  i don't know what i'm expecting i'm expecting anything at this point i don't even know
[01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:45.070]  we may see a point where they literally put him in jail and do not allow him out until the
[01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:50.190]  election i expect anything from the democrats because they have they have no way to win you
[01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:54.190]  want to know why they're cornered oh they're cornered they are they've ripped open our
[01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:59.070]  border they are successfully partnering with the mexican cartels in the biggest
[01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:03.950]  human trafficking operation in history even i said last week the border in texas is now
[01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:11.150]  run by the cartels they it is i'll tell you why we had the border patrol chief tell us in
[01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:16.910]  our homeland committee hearing uh just earlier this year he said that five out of nine
[01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:22.990]  of the border sectors are under the control of the cartels five out of nine and again the feds
[01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:27.550]  are such control freaks they've given the mexican cartels that have basically overthrown
[01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:32.990]  the mexican government operational control that is insane they they they didn't give it to them
[01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:36.350]  well they took the biden administration gave it to them well they greenlit it they moved out of
[01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:40.510]  the way yes yeah we're not blaming border patrol did that just happen with policies yeah
[01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:45.950]  so yes our border's out of control bidenomics best thing they could have ever done is by
[01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:49.630]  naming it bidenomics now we have a name for it and we'll never forget it
[01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:55.470]  worst inflation in 40 years senior citizens can hardly pay their bills they uh singled
[01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:59.470]  mothers hard-working people i have a bunch of family that have degrees they're professionals
[01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:03.950]  they can't pay their bills no imagine the poor people i mean it's awful people are maxing out
[01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:08.910]  their credit cards just to get by month after month grocery bills have doubled this is what
[01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:13.630]  joe biden's policies have done this is what they've done and i know you pointed this out
[01:19:13.630 --> 01:19:21.710]  when you saw my stack it's viral black folks are pissed this man this man right here this man
[01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:27.470]  i watched his video and i would i watched like eight times it was the best thing is the best
[01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:32.270]  video there is if you haven't seen it i encourage you to watch it what he said is he
[01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:38.350]  literally spoke for joe rogan senator for me he spoke for me he spoke for everyone i know
[01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:44.670]  and and he he laid down the law and i will go further with that i serve on the covid covid uh
[01:19:44.670 --> 01:19:51.389]  select committee here's where i stand with this there is not going to be lockdowns with
[01:19:51.389 --> 01:19:57.870]  covid there will be no force masking there will be no force vaccines that is one of the
[01:19:57.870 --> 01:20:03.469]  red lines i have drawn in the stand i've drawn three weaponized government covid mask and
[01:20:03.469 --> 01:20:10.510]  vaccines and funding for more covid and ukraine those are my three i will not vote for any
[01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:15.389]  appropriation bill that does those things i will not vote for a short-term cr that does
[01:20:15.389 --> 01:20:21.550]  those things and how amazing though has been them trying to roll it out again i mean it's
[01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:27.389]  everywhere they're they're losing they need things to distract people to suck them into fear
[01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:31.790]  that's why they need the climate change crisis that's why they want climate activists and
[01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:38.110]  protesters they're going to be rioters just wait then we may have lockdowns of course they are
[01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:43.150]  then we're going to have more covid to increase mass hysteria and fear they need people
[01:20:43.150 --> 01:20:49.550]  distracted and i'll go back to why the border's wide open bidenomics is is destroying people's
[01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:54.750]  ability to pay their bills they're putting us into a war that may lead to world war three
[01:20:54.750 --> 01:21:02.110]  they cannot win on these policies they're locking up their top political opponent president trump
[01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:06.190]  who we remember four years with president trump as some of the greatest years in america
[01:21:06.190 --> 01:21:10.510]  and now the head of the dnc says this isn't working what what do they think was going to
[01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:19.389]  happen well they did a good job with elections before we know we understand that um but i i truly
[01:21:19.389 --> 01:21:25.630]  i truly see this as they they're so arrogant really alex they're so arrogant they really
[01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:29.950]  believe that their policies are the best that they know what they're doing and that these
[01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:35.630]  little stupid peons and the uneducated people of america you know the deplorables
[01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:40.750]  as they called us once before that they that we don't know what we're doing that they know
[01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:45.550]  better than us and that they can just win and that they'll just and marjorie taylor green that's
[01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:50.510]  the key the black rocks know it's to create an angrier world destroy things and consolidate
[01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:54.750]  power but you're right the democrats actually believe they're creating utopia and they're being
[01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:59.230]  given marching orders are going to destroy everything they are well they they're definitely
[01:21:59.230 --> 01:22:04.350]  doing that they're leading us down to a road of destruction but i'm telling you alex people
[01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:08.830]  are waking up it's the most incredible that's an understatement because i'm not saying you're
[01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:12.430]  wrong i'm saying i don't have a way to describe to people what i see on the street
[01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:17.870]  because i live in liberal communist austin i got hate a year ago no hate ever now like like i
[01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:23.469]  mean it's it's total reversal that's wonderful because people know and they're suffering
[01:22:23.469 --> 01:22:28.030]  under the biden administration or the biden regime they've already been fooled people that
[01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:33.309]  really bought into covet they have come out of this thing so upset and angry like i can't
[01:22:33.309 --> 01:22:37.550]  believe i got these vaccines they didn't even work i can't believe i wore a mask all the time
[01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:41.790]  that didn't help me it didn't stop the spread of covet people that are coming out of this are
[01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:47.630]  coming out and they're waking up and so they have no desire to go back they're also realizing that
[01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:54.110]  oh maybe there's some truth to this this hunter biden laptop oh shoot maybe joe biden has been
[01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:59.389]  doing so that and they see they see uh maui really pissed people off it should piss people
[01:22:59.389 --> 01:23:04.830]  off lahaina was a wonderful town i've been there many times me too yeah it was a one of the
[01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:11.230]  best places to go visit and and maui um my daughter spent nearly every summer out there for
[01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:17.070]  like eight years uh the people there are wonderful it just is a great or it was a great
[01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:23.790]  community but look and he said about the train deal roman he said he's too busy to go there
[01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:29.950]  we have that club just too busy to go to too busy to go well you know joe biden it's
[01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:35.710]  amazing he wants 24 billion more dollars for ukraine but wants to give a 700 one-time payment
[01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:40.750]  to the people of lahaina that lost everything um then when he did go talk to him he talked about
[01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:46.190]  how his kitchen fire and experience there is if somehow that was comparable to what they
[01:23:46.190 --> 01:23:50.350]  went through they lost everything they can't even find neighbors they can't find kids
[01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:55.150]  that their their livelihoods are gone their homes are gone but yet he hasn't gone to visit
[01:23:55.150 --> 01:24:00.830]  east palestine he hasn't gone to the border but you better bet he's been over to ukraine
[01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:06.110]  to see zelinsky countless times and he set his ass on the beach in delaware i don't know
[01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:10.590]  how many times i think that 44 of the time he's on vacation yeah that's a lot of vacation time
[01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:14.910]  you know if you work monday through friday um if you work monday through friday that's about
[01:24:15.469 --> 01:24:20.990]  26 that gives you about 26 of the year vacation time think about that if you work
[01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:24.910]  monday through friday all year long then you saturday and sunday saturday and sunday is
[01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:33.230]  vacation so that's about 26 of the year but joe biden has spent over 40 40 44 it's incredible
[01:24:33.230 --> 01:24:40.110]  well he's also um he's too old to serve well that's my next question what are they gonna do
[01:24:40.110 --> 01:24:43.389]  about him i mean they got newsome kind of getting warmed up they got big mike
[01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:50.910]  i'm not sure i'm not sure actually um oh big mike's got you laughing yeah
[01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:57.389]  i tell you what they're they're gonna save her when they if it hits if it's a real emergency
[01:24:57.389 --> 01:25:00.990]  we'll definitely see her come out they're gonna break in case of emergencies exactly
[01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:06.670]  she's in a case like a big mike she's in a case she is she is there that is that's when
[01:25:06.670 --> 01:25:13.230]  everything is failing donald trump's going to win joe biden is a is a corrupt criminal no one
[01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:18.030]  can deny it gavin newsome can't win because he destroyed california they're gonna run over
[01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:22.350]  there they're gonna pull the hammer break the glass and they're gonna pull her out you think
[01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:29.309]  big mike's handsome man i'm not getting drunk all the time well you know joan rivers might
[01:25:29.309 --> 01:25:37.790]  have said things that could yeah wow keep going man mpg i love her yeah no really though that
[01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:42.430]  would be uh i don't think she wants to run i don't think but we know obama would love it
[01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:46.750]  and actually that'd be their only way to keep going and i think isn't this pretty much
[01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:52.350]  the third administration of biden oh this is totally it's totally the third term absolutely
[01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:56.510]  it's the third term they've got all the same people back in there um uh they're they're
[01:25:56.510 --> 01:26:02.350]  running everything just as if they never skipped a beat a beat uh president trump was like a uh
[01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:06.590]  like a speed bump for them they went right back to it uh pursuing everything they were
[01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:11.630]  trying to pursue before and they want to continue that process and and that's where we're
[01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:17.950]  at and uh yeah michelle obama she's definitely the one that will try to save the day roger
[01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:22.510]  stone talks to trump every day he says the guy's got ice water he says he's known for
[01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:28.190]  some years he says trump's on cloud nine what is your view you talk to trump a lot of this guy is
[01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:34.670]  incredible president trump is remarkable i think i i talk to him a lot and i think what i can
[01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:41.150]  explain to people is number one he is such a real person every time i talk to him he always
[01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:46.270]  asks me how are you doing marjorie he genuinely will ask about me and and me and my wife and
[01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:49.150]  our honeymoon seven years ago like how did you even know this was happening that great
[01:26:49.710 --> 01:26:55.389]  that's the kind of man he is though and i one thing that all or there's several things that
[01:26:55.389 --> 01:27:02.910]  impressed me one of them is the fact that he is such a successful businessman for so many years
[01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:09.870]  and there there is no phd that equals that there is no education there is nothing that
[01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:14.830]  you're a successful businesswoman you know that's the real streets it is that is it if you
[01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:18.110]  that's why you're so successful but you never talk about it but you've been very successful
[01:27:18.670 --> 01:27:22.990]  i i have and it takes hard work to be there it takes a lot of hard work to get there
[01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:28.910]  but you learn you learn real lessons that you cannot learn with any college or university
[01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:36.110]  there is no master's degree or phd program right and so president trump has that and
[01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:40.270]  then if you take how that's how i view government my job in government i only look
[01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:45.630]  at it with a business lens and president trump sees it the same way the other thing i really
[01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:50.910]  appreciate about president trump is um the fact that he plays golf every day makes him extremely
[01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:54.990]  healthy you know i work out a lot i that's something that i'm dedicated to and i love
[01:27:54.990 --> 01:28:00.110]  watching you do the power clean thank you but health and fitness helps your your mental
[01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:07.710]  capacity it keeps you sharp it is there's a whole uh uh just everything around it between
[01:28:07.710 --> 01:28:12.750]  your health your fitness your mental capacity so he's stronger would you say he's stronger now
[01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:19.230]  under attack i would say he is extremely strong because brazil said oh my god this is an echean
[01:28:19.230 --> 01:28:22.910]  she said that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger they're scared don't you get it you're
[01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:27.389]  in a game of chicken with us they should be scared because i i rode down those same streets
[01:28:27.389 --> 01:28:32.030]  i went to the atlanta jail and i rode down there down rice street and i saw all the people
[01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:36.430]  coming out and they were out on the side of the road screeching let's talk about that and

[01:33:07.469 --> 01:33:07.969]  you
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:18.740]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:29.740]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:35.740]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening.
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:40.740]  InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:49.740]  Joe Biden literally saying, y'all need to come, they need to come up with a new vaccine and they need to come up with a way that people have to take it no matter what.
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:54.740]  I'm willing to die about my freedom. I'm willing to die about my medical independence.
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:34:00.740]  So all I got to say to you in that video, try this around and find out.
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:12.740]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:19.740]  Well, the future president of the United States, I'm going to say that to kiss up to her. I feel it.
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:26.740]  I think the first female president of the United States, I think in maybe four or eight years, is going to be MTG.
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:31.740]  And I can't wait to support her for president of the United States if we save this country.
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:35.740]  But MTG, you wanted to get to what's coming next today, so you came into what's coming next.
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:40.740]  This is what InfoWars is all about. All the main numbers show economy and free fall in reality.
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:47.740]  We're going to hit that in a moment. But first, this isn't entertainment seeing Trump being attacked like this.
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:52.740]  This isn't like a boxing match or a train wreck or a soap opera.
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:57.740]  This is our future here. And yeah, he's confident and yeah, it's waking people up.
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:04.740]  But we can't underestimate our enemies and what they may pull because, as Donna Brazile said, they're cornered rats and they're losing gut level.
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:09.740]  And with all your contacts in Congress, MTG, what should we be worried about?
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:12.740]  What should we be focused on? What should we be doing? What should we be praying for?
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:16.740]  Because they now know nothing they've done has worked. What do they do next?
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:20.740]  That's why I've said we don't hope this happens to Biden or Trump.
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:25.740]  But I'm really concerned they could have some white supremacists kill Biden. Blame us.
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:28.740]  They say it's this epidemic that doesn't exist per capita.
[01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:34.740]  And I'm really concerned about them going after Trump because logically, historically, that's the next move of the graph.
[01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:40.740]  Maybe. What I worry about actually is I worry about a hot war.
[01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:47.740]  I worry about a very serious war because historically, if you look at our country,
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:54.740]  historically, whenever America has gone to war, the American people rally around whoever the president is.
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:58.740]  We remember George Bush after 9-11. October surprise. Yes.
[01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:07.740]  So we remember then that's our natural instinct to rally behind our country, behind our flag.
[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:12.740]  So many people will sign up to join the military and they rally behind the president.
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:18.740]  The biggest thing I'm concerned about, Alex, is I'm concerned that they will go to the next level with Ukraine,
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:23.740]  put troops on the ground. Russia will absolutely see it for what it really is.
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:29.740]  They will go to war with us and the United States and Russia will be in a hot war.
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:36.740]  That is my biggest concern. And I think that would be something that the Democrats, the State Department,
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:41.740]  the Biden administration could move towards because they will not back off of Ukraine.
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:44.740]  And that's exactly what Tucker's been saying. And now they're sending F-16s.
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:48.740]  We know U.S. troops are there as advisers and we know Ukraine's losing now.
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:51.740]  So what are you hearing in Congress? My amendment failed on that.
[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:55.740]  I had an amendment to block the F-16s going to Ukraine. It failed on the House floor.
[01:36:55.740 --> 01:37:01.740]  We didn't have enough members of Congress to vote for it. That's the danger we're in, Alex.
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:04.740]  Clear escalation. There's not much levels left.
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:11.740]  No, from day one I voted no for Ukraine. I voted no for the money going there.
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:19.740]  I voted no to sanctions on Russia. I voted no to all of it because the only solution there that makes any rational sense
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:23.740]  is for those two countries to come to peace terms, and that's between them.
[01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:27.740]  That doesn't have to involve the United States. And Trump says it can end overnight. That's true.
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:30.740]  The media says he can't. The U.S. runs it. Of course it can end it.
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:33.740]  Yeah, it can end overnight. You want to know how we cut off the money.
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:38.740]  Zelensky even said it. He won't even have elections unless America funds his elections.
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:44.740]  I'll tell you how bad it is over there. The United States of America, we send Ukraine,
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:54.740]  I'm sorry, you watching, people at home, send $1 billion every single month to Ukraine to fund their government.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:58.740]  That's not the war. That's to keep the lights on for their government.
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:00.740]  But $700 to people in Maui.
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:06.740]  $700 one time for the people in Maui. And that's outrageous. It's unacceptable.
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:13.740]  But I do believe what we could see is we could see them move us into a full-scale war in Ukraine,
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:19.740]  all in the name of protecting Europe. They're always saying that Putin, his goal is to take Europe.
[01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:23.740]  We have seen no evidence of that whatsoever. And I'm not defending Vladimir Putin.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:26.740]  I'm just saying if you look at it black and white.
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:31.740]  If Putin had hundreds of thousands of troops in Canada, I'd say go to war with him. We're there starting this.
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:35.740]  Right. But think about this. I mean, I'm old enough to remember.
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:40.740]  You remember, every time we've ever been at war, didn't we watch it every single night on television?
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:45.740]  Remember how we would watch on television the bombing of Baghdad or the bombings in Afghanistan?
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:46.740]  It was like entertainment.
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:52.740]  It was. It was like thick, disgusting entertainment. But they showed it nonstop on the news.
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:59.740]  Let me ask you, when is the last time anyone has been able to turn on the television and watch the war that America is funding?
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:02.740]  At that point, you don't ever see it.
[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:03.740]  No, you never see it.
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:09.740]  They say it's nothing. It's bigger than Vietnam, Korea. I mean, it's hundreds of three hundred forty thousand dead.
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:10.740]  This is a full war.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:15.740]  Tell me where the CNN war reporters are and why aren't they in a bunker with Ukrainian troops?
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:19.740]  Don't ask. Really, I want to know what they used to do.
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:22.740]  That's what these were. That's what we always saw.
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:24.740]  It's like it's a war on another planet.
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:29.740]  It's an invisible war. You don't get to see it. You're paying for it, but you don't get to see it.
[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:32.740]  You want to know why they're lying. Ukraine is losing this war.
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:36.740]  I'm probably the only member of Congress that will say that out loud.
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:38.740]  No, you are. And I love the meme, how you're not smart.
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:41.740]  You're one of the smartest people I know. You're so smart.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:45.740]  And I love the left claims they're old, empower women, but they go, oh, MTG is dumb.
[01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:49.740]  No, you're saying the truth is complex and sophisticated.
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:51.740]  And it's just it's disgusting.
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:54.740]  And since when do Democrats support World War Three? I guess they do now.
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:56.740]  Absolutely, they do right now.
[01:39:56.740 --> 01:40:03.740]  They have to. They have to support World War Three because it supports their climate change agenda.
[01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:05.740]  It changes the world.
[01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:11.740]  If you support a massive global war, it completely shifts everything.
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:13.740]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:20.740]  They're trying to make a full shift in the way basically the way we live, the way governments work, trade policies.
[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:27.740]  But they're creeping under the most dangerous levels that will hurt all of us. And here's why.
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:32.740]  Because we sanctioned Russia, Russia got smart and they went and made trade deals with China.
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:35.740]  And then they started making trade deals with other countries.
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:38.740]  That was my next point. This is destroying America's soft power.
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:44.740]  And I love our country. I love our empire. But I hate seeing America go way down in the world.
[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:49.740]  Well, look at BRICS. Because of the war in Ukraine, they have created BRICS.
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:53.740]  Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:41:00.740]  They've created this very powerful growing international group where they can do trade, buy and sell goods.
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:02.740]  The Indians just bought billions in oil.
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:07.740]  Yeah, and they're going to tank our dollar because they trade in their own currencies, not the U.S. dollar.
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:09.740]  They can trade in their own currency.
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:12.740]  So what's the bigger 30,000 foot view?
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:22.740]  The 30,000 foot view is war is an option for the Democrats in their minds to win the election because they think it'll rally the people.
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:27.740]  So you're saying what's coming next? And I agree with you. Tucker says it's war, expanded war.
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:32.740]  Absolutely. I see war. I see war because I introduce amendment after amendment on the House floor.
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:38.740]  And I cannot get my amendments passed to stop F-16s, to stop funding to go to Ukraine.
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:42.740]  Even though the American people overwhelmingly do not support the Ukraine war.
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:52.740]  And by the way, the Russians can shoot down a 5,000 mile an hour mock missile the British sold them.
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:58.740]  An F-16 only goes like 1500. They're going to blow those up anyways. So what is the point?
[01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:05.740]  Well, I think if you're to control the American people, number one, you have to make them feel afraid of something or multiple things.
[01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:10.740]  It doesn't have to be just one thing. It can be the continuing threat of Covid. It's continuing.
[01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:15.740]  It'll never go away. That's why they want new vaccines and more mask mandates and more vaccines.
[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:20.740]  And we have to keep fighting. Don't you love that? They're like, yeah, we want new mandates, but you're crazy.
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:23.740]  We don't want new mandates. Right. You've seen that little mind control. Oh, of course.
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:30.740]  And then and now it's climate change and all the poor people in Burning Man and they're going to run out of there and convinced,
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:39.740]  brainwashed that that's what happened to them was because man made climate change nearly killed them in the desert of Nevada.
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:44.740]  They're going to run out there and spread that that it'll be it'll be multiple issues.
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:49.740]  But the ultimate one is a world war. And I believe that's where we're going.
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:55.740]  Wow. Let's talk about impeachment again. You've got a Web site. What do people do there?
[01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:59.740]  How do they get involved? Because we need to put Biden on trial now.
[01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:03.740]  We've got the evidence you promised months ago on the show. You said it's going to happen.
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:07.740]  Everything you said is coming true. What do we do? Thank you. Go to impeachment team dot com.
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:13.740]  And I want to share some numbers with you, Alex. Oh, yeah. Job numbers, too. Well, I have different numbers and then we'll go to jobs.
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:21.740]  I'd like to talk about here's how many people support it. Back in May, I put up a survey through my congressional Web site,
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:26.740]  through my congressional social media and asked how many people support impeachment.
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:33.740]  Now, when you get polling numbers, you look at a poll and it says Trump is beating DeSantis by a gazillion points.
[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:37.740]  Trump is is is beating Biden. You know, and it says all these polling numbers.
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:42.740]  That's usually a poll of around 1000 people. And that's how they get those numbers.
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:47.740]  All polling works like that. You choose your group you want. Yes. You target a group and you poll.
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:52.740]  So my poll has a poll of three thousand thirty. I'm sorry.
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:58.740]  Thirty nine thousand eight hundred and thirty two people have come out in support of impeachment of Joe Biden.
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:03.740]  That has been going on since May. Thirty nine thousand. That's seven.
[01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:08.740]  You don't mind. Send me that. I'll send it to them. There's there's only ten thousand people against it.
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:13.740]  So this is a poll. It's a survey. That's like two thirds one.
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:18.740]  Two thirds one. Seventy nine percent support impeachment. Twenty percent.
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:23.740]  Just over 20 percent are against. That's how big it is. That's how big impeachment is.
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:28.740]  It has to happen. Impeachment team dot com impeachment team dot com.
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:33.740]  Help us. And then expect this. Everybody says, oh, impeach, impeach.
[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:38.740]  It takes work. No, it takes work. And the reason why it takes work is we want to do it the right way.
[01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:42.740]  How they impeach Trump was absolutely wrong. So you're teeing him up.
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:45.740]  You're taking your time. Yes, because we have more power.
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:50.740]  Nancy Pelosi said she just said we're going to start an impeachment inquiry.
[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:55.740]  We didn't vote. She just started one and then they voted to impeach him.
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:58.740]  But this time we're doing it the correct way. We are actually going to vote.
[01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:01.740]  And then have enough evidence in the House to get the conviction of the Senate.
[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:04.740]  For those who don't know, the House indicts the Senate convicts.
[01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:08.740]  So Trump was never officially removed. They just started the impeachment.
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:12.740]  Well, the House impeaches. The Senate holds a trial and convicts.
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:18.740]  President Trump was impeached twice in the House, wrongfully impeached twice in the House.
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:22.740]  And I've introduced resolutions to expunge his impeachments.
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:26.740]  That's another matter. And now the Georgia Peach is going to impeach Biden.
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:30.740]  That's the goal. That's what we're going to do.
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:35.740]  So we'll impeach him in the House and then there'd be a conviction and trial in Senate.
[01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:39.740]  Now, we know the reality there. I'm not going to lie to anyone.
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:43.740]  The Democrats control the Senate. But does that mean that we shouldn't do it anyways?
[01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:48.740]  No, it's a public destruction of him. We've got to get on the offense.
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:51.740]  Where does Trump stand on the impeachment? I know he's been pushing it.
[01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:55.740]  Oh, of course. Trump stands for holding people accountable.
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:46:00.740]  Ours is not political. Ours is because we have absolute evidence,
[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:06.740]  100 percent evidence that we are continually producing
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:11.740]  every single day on our committee investigations that Joe Biden was 100
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:16.740]  percent involved in Hunter Biden's business deals, not only just involved, he was very much an active partner.
[01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:21.740]  And Biden lied about all that. Joe Biden has lied. We've already proven he's lied.
[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:26.740]  He said, I had nothing to do with Hunter Biden, had nothing to do with his business deals, nothing to do with my son's business.
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:30.740]  But we have it proven that a thousand percent, he knew all of it.
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:35.740]  He was meeting his business partners. Hunter flew with Joe Biden, his father,
[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:39.740]  while he was vice president to go have these business meetings.
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:44.740]  And Joe Biden was on the phone with business partners, was at the meetings in person himself.
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:48.740]  Joe Biden is the big guy. So what do you think they do to Joe Biden?
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:52.740]  Because they want to get rid of him. He can barely talk now. He's just grabbing women in public.
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:57.740]  I mean, he's completely out of his mind with serious dementia.
[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:05.740]  I know there's no, like, golden way to know what's happening, but gut level, you're a smart lady.
[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:10.740]  What do they do about him? Alex, you're going to get this very easily from me.
[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:15.740]  It's going to click for you real fast. Joe Biden is the best intelligence
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:20.740]  asset they have. You can't get a better one. You can't get a better president
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:24.740]  for the intelligence community than Joe Biden. Do you want to know why?
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:29.740]  Think about it. He's completely controlled. This is a man that was a Catholic that used to be
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:34.740]  against abortion. Where is he at now? He is for cutting the body parts off of
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:39.740]  children to change their gender. Why is he this way? Because he is controlled.
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:44.740]  Why is he controlled? Because he was he's a criminal and he's caught and they've told him,
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:49.740]  we'll protect you. We got you covered, Joe, as long as you keep going down this trail.
[01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:54.740]  So he gets all the blame and they hide behind him. They don't want to get rid of Joe Biden.
[01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:59.740]  He's the best. Think about it like this. Now, for the mass, the public that doesn't really pay attention to
[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:04.740]  politics, they don't know about the Hunter Biden laptop. They barely they might know about it a little
[01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:09.740]  bit, but they don't really know. They see Joe Biden. He's innocent, sweet grandpa that stumbles
[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:14.740]  his words every now and then, likes to get ice cream and just wants to help America
[01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:19.740]  and he wants to help Ukraine. That's how they see Joe Biden. So they want to continue
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:24.740]  to keep that image of Joe Biden for the masses of people
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:29.740]  that are busy in their lives every single day, busy going to work, working two
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:34.740]  to three jobs, taking care of their children, maybe paying attention to sports
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:39.740]  and enjoying and just enjoying life, the great life we have as Americans. They
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:44.740]  are not in tune to everything about Joe Biden. And for for that
[01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:49.740]  issue alone, the best president that can exist in the White House,
[01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:54.740]  especially for the intelligence community, is Joe Biden. They
[01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:59.740]  keep him looking innocent. They protect him. They allow him to stay in the White House.
[01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:04.740]  They allow him to enjoy all the glory and they cover up his crimes as
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:09.740]  long as he's controlled. He continues their foreign wars. He continues to advance
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:14.740]  their Marxist agenda for America. He's the perfect president for the left
[01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:19.740]  and the intelligence community. He really is. So as
[01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:24.740]  Donna Brazile and others admit that this is exploding Trump, as if they wouldn't know that would happen, what
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:29.740]  do they do as they get increasingly cornered? Here's what they've done. They've
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:34.740]  indicted President Trump too many times. Think about it. The more they indict him,
[01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:39.740]  the more they prove that all of this is political and all of this is a lie. And people pay
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:44.740]  attention more and more and more. And the more people pay attention, they see it
[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:49.740]  for exactly what it is. And it exposes everything they're doing. And so
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:54.740]  the American people are rallying behind President Trump because under President Trump, we had
[01:49:54.740 --> 01:49:59.740]  $1.75 gasoline in November of 2020. That's how
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:04.740]  much gas was in my hometown in Rome, Georgia in the election.
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:09.740]  You talked about this earlier. We saw double black folks voting for Trump. Usually
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:14.740]  10 percent vote Republican, like 20, 30 percent, depending on the demographic. Males, females.
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:19.740]  Now it's just everywhere. All the big rappers, all the big people
[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:24.740]  going against the system. They get it. It's viral everywhere. You live in
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:29.740]  Georgia. I mean, it looks like they're losing the black vote. I think Trump gets 50 percent now. I think he will.
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:34.740]  But we have to pay attention to absentee ballot voter fraud. Look at the case in Mississippi.
[01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:39.740]  There's a Democrat in Mississippi. Oh, I meant to play that video. Explain that to people. Yes. So there's
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:44.740]  a Democrat in Mississippi. He has the text messages. He has the proof, the absolute proof
[01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:49.740]  that his election was stolen with absentee ballot fraud. They were they were coming in
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:54.740]  with thumb drives for the election machines. They stole the election from him
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:59.740]  and he has the proof of it. And he is yelling and screaming about it. And we've known this
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:04.740]  is how they've always done it. It has always been an issue. Elections
[01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:09.740]  get stolen and Democrats even steal them from other Democrats. It's not
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:14.740]  just Republicans they steal elections from. It's absolutely against other Democrats.
[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:19.740]  Look at what happened to Bernie Sanders. Hillary Clinton stole that election from Bernie Sanders.
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:24.740]  So for President Trump to say my election was stolen, regular people are like, hell yeah
[01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:29.740]  it was because everybody knows that we voted and elected him. Exactly. I'm not like a leftist
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:34.740]  that will overstate our position. I'm seeing explosive awakening like you think
[01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:39.740]  of any prominent talk show us now or figure whether it's James Woods or Joe
[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:44.740]  Rogan or Russell Brand or Tulsi Gabbard or R.F.K. Junior or people are all
[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:49.740]  Jimmy Dore. They're all Trump's great. New World Order is bad. The globalists are evil. We're going to
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:54.740]  screw the Democrats. I mean, they've got hardcore liberals joining Trump. This is
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:59.740]  huge. It is huge. But there's a lot of things that are happening that, you know,
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:04.740]  we don't talk about a lot on the news. You got five minutes left. You're awesome. You got the floor.
[01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:09.740]  Address that camera right there. You tell them. OK, I'd love it. You're hosting right now. OK, great. Thank you, Alex.
[01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:14.740]  Thank you for being here. My God. So here's something that I think is a
[01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:19.740]  major issue. So the Friday jobs report comes out. One point two million
[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:24.740]  American. We have those graphics, guys. Put them on screen. Start over. One point two million Americans lost
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:29.740]  their jobs. That was on Friday's jobs report. But at the same time, over
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:34.740]  six hundred thousand foreigners, people from other countries, gained
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:39.740]  American jobs. So put that into perspective. One point two million
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:44.740]  Americans lost their jobs. But we imported foreign workers and
[01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:49.740]  gave them American jobs. And I want to talk about that, Alex, because this is what I see at home
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:54.740]  in my district. But it's happening all over the country. And talk about I'm going to go to the control room. I'm going to put these
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:59.740]  graphs on the screen. OK, so tax credits. We see state
[01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:04.740]  governments, we see county governments, but we see the federal government as well. And the Biden
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:09.740]  administration has done this extensively, especially because of the Green New Deal.
[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:14.740]  They've given tax credits and given a lot of your hard earned tax dollars
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:19.740]  to these foreign countries' businesses to bring them in to give Americans
[01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:24.740]  jobs. So let me explain the danger of that for you. So, for example, you'll
[01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:29.740]  see maybe a battery company, because of course they love green energy.
[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:34.740]  And they'll pay the battery company. They'll pay them by giving them free land. They'll
[01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:39.740]  give them tax credits to move in and build their site,
[01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:44.740]  build their manufacturing plant. They'll bring them in and they'll help them get
[01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:49.740]  completely set up. They'll even spend money. Like in Georgia, they have a job training
[01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:54.740]  program that they will train workers for these companies that
[01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:59.740]  they bring into Georgia. So that's paid for by Georgia taxpayers, which is so
[01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:04.740]  insulting. And here's why it's insulting. When a foreign country's business
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:09.740]  gets to move in to, say, my state or my district or your state or somewhere around where you
[01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:14.740]  live, and they get the help from the federal government and the state government to move
[01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:19.740]  there with tax dollars, they are directly competing with the existing businesses
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:24.740]  that are already there. And here's how they're competing. We have a worker shortage in America.
[01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:29.740]  We don't have enough workers on every level. That goes from doctors, pilots, nurses,
[01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:34.740]  construction workers, plumbers, linemen, you name it, truck drivers.
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:39.740]  We do not have enough workers in America. So our government pays these
[01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:44.740]  foreign countries to bring their businesses into our country. And then
[01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:49.740]  these foreign country businesses get set up and they steal workers
[01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:54.740]  away from the existing American companies. That is the big problem that's
[01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:59.740]  happening right now. So we're seeing job reports where we're seeing 1.2
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:04.740]  million Americans lose their jobs. Why? Because of Bidenomics. Bidenomics
[01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:09.740]  is destroying our economy. It's destroying small businesses. It's destroying
[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:14.740]  many ways for people to keep up. And so you see these American
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:19.740]  companies failing and faltering and Americans are losing their jobs.
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:24.740]  Because of an unfair playing field. That's right. But think about how bad it is. So I have
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:29.740]  the the flooring industry in Dalton, Georgia. It is a massive. By the way, you're not talking
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:34.740]  out of your patootie here. You're a very successful business lady. You're all right. That's right. I've run a construction
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:39.740]  company for over 25 years. I've been in business for a long time. Here's what's happening. So we have
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:44.740]  these massive flooring companies. I'm talking about some of the biggest in the world
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:49.740]  are in Dalton, Georgia. Well, we have Joe Biden bragging because he funded
[01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:54.740]  a solar panel company to be able to expand and build another manufacturing plant.
[01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:59.740]  And they've also funded other companies to move into my district. Well, guess what's happening?
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:04.740]  This battery production plant, the solar... I even saw they're brainwashing employees into
[01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:09.740]  communism at the meetings. Well, let me tell you what they do. There aren't enough workers.
[01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:14.740]  There aren't enough workers, Alex. So they are stealing workers from the flooring
[01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:19.740]  companies manufacturing plants. They're stealing workers from other companies
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:24.740]  and no one can keep workers. Their people just aren't there. So you know what they're doing?
[01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:29.740]  They're importing them from overseas. So in my district, they're
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:34.740]  bringing in thousands of foreign workers because they don't have enough workers.
[01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:39.740]  We're out of time. Anytime you want the show, you can host it or take over. You are awesome. In closing, what do we do about this?
[01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:44.740]  What we do about it is we have to fight like hell to fight for America First policies.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:49.740]  We get President Trump back in the White House. You guys go to impeachmentteam.com.
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:54.740]  We're going to impeach Joe Biden and we're going to we are going to painfully, painfully
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:59.740]  make him go through this. And that's why they're so scared, because administratively, legally, we can end all this very quickly.
[01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:05.740]  Could we end it right now? No, but we had Trump in. Oh, if we had Trump in, none
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:10.740]  of this would be happening. That's why we want him back. What an amazing time. Thank you for coming in studio
