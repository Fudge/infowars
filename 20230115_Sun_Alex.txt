[05:12.560 --> 05:17.120]  that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny now in the last year we've done a very
[05:17.120 --> 05:23.920]  successful fundraiser of silver coins when you buy the coin you know that you are supporting the
[05:23.920 --> 05:29.200]  transmission and you get a historical momento so you can remember the great contribution you made
[05:29.200 --> 05:34.400]  to freedom now despite the fact that the coins are selling out the last of the four coin series

[05:42.160 --> 05:47.760]  coin dot com and just like an npr pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a dvd
[05:47.760 --> 05:53.680]  300 that's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser but despite that we're offering 30
[05:53.680 --> 06:00.400]  dollars off exclusively at 1776 on what coins remain please go to 1776 coin dot com right now
[06:11.120 --> 06:19.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live
[06:19.920 --> 06:29.680]  from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones it was early 2022 about a year ago
[06:30.320 --> 06:34.240]  that the damn broke pertaining to the cover up of what covid vaccines are really doing
[06:34.800 --> 06:42.240]  but now in the last four days the cdc has come out the nih has come out the fda boards have come
[06:42.240 --> 06:47.280]  out and all pointed figures at each other saying they were lied to about secret studies that were
[06:47.280 --> 06:53.760]  done on the experimental shots studies that were done once the injections began but now the cdc is
[06:53.760 --> 06:58.560]  releasing documents confirming massive increases in blood clots myocarditis heart attacks infertility
[06:58.560 --> 07:05.440]  strokes you name it and then today fox news we're about to play the club comes out and says whoa the
[07:05.440 --> 07:10.960]  cdc says it got covered up what happened with strokes increasing and they're so upset they didn't
[07:10.960 --> 07:17.760]  know this is rats leaving the sinking ship this is the establishment that did this on purpose being
[07:17.760 --> 07:24.800]  caught if you go back to 2014-15 obama funded the university of texas galveston my studies
[07:25.760 --> 07:31.600]  and they found with a similar coronavirus mRNA vaccine that was causing massive heart attacks
[07:31.600 --> 07:37.760]  blood clots of the lungs myocarditis and the rats lived about half as long as rats normally do
[07:37.760 --> 07:43.280]  ladies and gentlemen they knew what they were doing is dr michael yedon the former chief scientist
[07:43.280 --> 07:48.480]  and vice president feiser said a week ago they knew it was toxic they knew it was depopulation weapon
[07:48.480 --> 07:54.480]  so here's the clip from fox news the bad news is millions have died hundreds of millions are sick
[07:54.480 --> 08:00.240]  the good news is less than 10 of people are taking these shots compared to what were just a year ago
[08:00.240 --> 08:04.880]  so the public's waking up but now we've got to bring big pharma and these mad scientists led by
[08:04.880 --> 08:10.880]  founcy and bill gates and peter dazik to justice this was premeditated just like i told you three
[08:10.880 --> 08:17.040]  years ago and this all started but remember back in 1976 only three people died from the swine flu
[08:17.040 --> 08:21.440]  vaccine and they suspended the whole program we know hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[08:21.440 --> 08:26.560]  conservatively have died in the us alone all the documents are posted and info wars.com and
[08:26.560 --> 08:31.680]  band dog video all of you that told the truth all the doctors and scientists spoke out all of us as
[08:31.680 --> 08:36.000]  independent journalists that told the truth we are vindicated but it's not about being vindicated
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.360]  it's about bringing the criminals to justice to protect the innocent because now they're coming
[08:39.360 --> 08:44.240]  after not just six months old and up they're coming after newborn babies and pregnant women
[08:44.240 --> 08:50.640]  here's the report so we are just getting word of this now regarding the covid vaccine the cdc is
[08:50.640 --> 08:57.920]  now saying that there has been enough cases of people who have had the vaccine received the
[08:57.920 --> 09:04.320]  vaccine and then suffered a stroke the agency will now be investigating any potential links
[09:04.320 --> 09:10.720]  between the shots and the strokes in some of those patients the globalist criminals are on the run
[09:10.720 --> 09:16.000]  we're really starting to win but we've only won major battles we haven't won the war that's why
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.840]  info wars is so important it's why it's the tip of the spirit's why those that launch this attack
[09:19.840 --> 09:24.640]  are so scared there's not just my sunday show coming up tomorrow four to six p.m with key guests

[11:16.160 --> 11:22.640]  want to get one thing off my chest if you will before we get started here that was i want to
[11:22.640 --> 11:29.360]  reiterate that was already stated by alex jones i can't express my gratitude to this audience enough
[11:29.360 --> 11:36.720]  and i really hope you understand as alex has tried to explain many times without you we don't exist
[11:37.440 --> 11:41.200]  and in case you haven't noticed and i don't want to make a big thing of this tonight
[11:41.840 --> 11:46.160]  but in case you haven't noticed a lot of people are getting their twitter accounts back but you've
[11:46.160 --> 11:51.120]  noticed who's not by now haven't you you've noticed who's not allowed to go back on twitter it's alex
[11:51.120 --> 11:57.600]  jones and it's his great crew myself included harrison smith and others so we are the most
[11:57.600 --> 12:02.800]  censored network in the world we are the most censored individuals that work here at this
[12:02.800 --> 12:09.120]  network in the world it is now completely proven once again and so for me personally if i don't
[12:09.120 --> 12:14.480]  have you supporting us at infowarstore.com i don't know what happens i'm not going to be allowed
[12:14.480 --> 12:20.400]  back by big tech they've already made that very clear and so i am i am eternally grateful for
[12:20.400 --> 12:26.560]  this audience and i am eternally grateful for everything you've done to make info war successful
[12:26.560 --> 12:31.360]  to keep us on the air despite all the attacks against us so that we can come in here every day
[12:31.360 --> 12:37.440]  and do a great job trying to inform the world and as people have started to notice you know we don't
[12:37.440 --> 12:43.840]  claim to be saving lives here like that's what our duty is every day but it is a fact we've
[12:43.840 --> 12:49.120]  probably saved hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives when it comes to this vaccine
[12:49.120 --> 12:52.960]  and that's just by telling the truth that's not even like we have to come out here and think how
[12:52.960 --> 12:59.280]  can we save lives they're telling you a COVID-19 poison injection is safe and effective when we
[12:59.280 --> 13:04.000]  knew the opposite was true so that's all it was was just getting out the information wouldn't
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.160]  you like to know before you bite into that apple if it's poisoned we're just here telling you
[13:08.160 --> 13:13.360]  that's a poisoned apple you might not want to bite into it so once again eternally grateful
[13:13.360 --> 13:18.320]  for you don't take info wars for granted you want to continue to see us on the air every day

[13:46.960 --> 13:58.000]  info wars because all they're doing is selling us a daily diet of useless news and total propaganda
[13:59.040 --> 14:06.080]  on the useless news front do i care that a football player after he got tackled got a heart attack i mean
[14:06.080 --> 14:12.240]  as part of the game or did he get a vaccine i don't care that this is not this is not essential news

[14:19.120 --> 14:25.040]  that's going to help me i'm not in the sixth grade elvis presley's daughter died i've been

[14:43.040 --> 14:50.560]  this morning was telling you that goes back to the second thing i said the propaganda so they
[14:50.560 --> 14:57.840]  they feed you with useless garbage and then they brain dead you with propaganda i'm gonna give you
[14:57.840 --> 15:08.400]  an example this is from the financial times not ancient history january 10th russia's set for

[23:06.480 --> 23:11.040]  the numbers of the viruses were over counted it was exaggerated the masks never worked it looks
[23:11.040 --> 23:16.480]  like the vaccines don't work if you're cnn how do you not feel like a complete idiot i mean
[23:16.480 --> 23:21.600]  this woman either completely fooled you or she's like a spy or something that just went on your

[23:45.760 --> 23:51.520]  that they lied to you about the vaccine they should still be held in a trial and maybe they
[23:51.520 --> 23:55.680]  can be granted mercy if they come out and say it that they were wrong about it now but i mean when
[23:55.680 --> 24:01.520]  did the trials be in an entire window at bbc studio covered in vaccine deaths jerald now they're
[24:01.520 --> 24:05.520]  not they're not gonna have a trial it's they they could lie and do anything that they want

[35:17.200 --> 35:22.960]  all the uh the wealthy the club as you like to call them the club is meeting in davos and you
[35:22.960 --> 35:28.000]  know they hate the people so much they hate the peasants in the surf so much jerald that they've
[35:28.000 --> 35:34.320]  set up a security perimeter that's about two miles away from their hotel i mean so you couldn't even
[35:34.320 --> 35:39.760]  tee up a golf ball and get it anywhere near these guys that's how locked down they have davos with
[35:39.760 --> 35:44.720]  the military and police so they're really telling you we don't want to see the peasants we don't
[35:44.720 --> 35:51.680]  want to smell the peasants we don't want them within an eye shot of us you're right i call us
[35:51.680 --> 35:58.640]  plantation workers of slave landia when i was a young guy there were grocery stores hardware stores
[35:58.640 --> 36:05.600]  stationary stores you know drug stores and now they're all chains they own everything and i have
[36:05.600 --> 36:13.440]  to correct you you said about soros schwaab and and uh hitlery clinton having wet dreams you're
[36:13.440 --> 36:23.760]  all dried up man they don't have wet dreams anymore so the the other thing too i want to
[36:23.760 --> 36:31.040]  mention really briefly the to bring it into the context of listening to the 1776 coin the silver
[36:31.040 --> 36:36.880]  coin why this is so important you know we had forecast by the way back in november october
[36:36.880 --> 36:43.520]  that gold prices had bottomed and that golden silver prices were going to go up from that point and
[36:43.520 --> 36:50.400]  they have and now you're seeing gold now you know what is above 1900 an ounce so i'm not telling
[36:50.400 --> 36:55.360]  people what to do what to invest in but i'm just saying when you're supporting info wars with that
[36:55.360 --> 37:02.880]  1776 coin you're also supporting yourself because our forecast is the price of silver is going to go
[37:02.880 --> 37:13.360]  up and as far as 1776 goes i just turned 76 in november so i'm fighting for the spirit of 1776
[37:13.920 --> 37:18.560]  and that's something those coins that keeps it in your heart because that's what this country was
[37:18.560 --> 37:25.440]  founded upon that spirit that's been robbed from us and so uh you know i'm just saying to people
[37:25.440 --> 37:32.000]  you know the to me you know that's not only you're helping yourself but you're also helping info wars
[37:32.000 --> 37:38.640]  and again we only see the prices going up on this because oh and the the data coming out
[37:39.280 --> 37:45.120]  all of the guesses on wall street is that the federal reserve is only going to raise interest
[37:45.120 --> 37:52.480]  rates 25 basis points when they finalize their meeting on february 1st if they only raise them
[37:52.480 --> 38:00.720]  25 basis points you're going to see gold and silver prices skyrocket if they don't and they raise them
[38:00.720 --> 38:07.680]  50 basis points you're going to see the economy collapse along with the stock market which is also
[38:07.680 --> 38:14.240]  going to drive up gold and silver prices so anyway going back to davos we have lost our freedom in
[38:14.240 --> 38:19.920]  this country and it's just totally disgusting what's happened to us that we had these little
[38:19.920 --> 38:26.960]  clowns running and ruining our lives and when you look at that guy claus schwa boy i'll tell you man
[38:26.960 --> 38:31.680]  if orwell was a cartoonist he couldn't have come up with a more evil looking figure like that cat
[38:32.640 --> 38:38.000]  with those pointy ears and then look it's not like it's not like they can claim that the james bond
[38:38.800 --> 38:44.800]  villains or even dr evil from austin powers is based off claus schwa it's like he based himself
[38:44.800 --> 38:52.320]  off of them he's like a cross between dart vader and dr evil yeah and you know i say to myself man
[38:52.320 --> 39:01.120]  i saw soros could keep his billions man if i look like that cat are you like ember palpatine
[39:01.120 --> 39:07.680]  after he got like oh geez imagine walking around well you know look at me look at these people

[39:48.640 --> 39:55.920]  her last job was a fed head running the federal reserve and wait a minute i said before you know

[49:56.480 --> 50:04.720]  and said that 94 percent of the people that died of covid i think was 2.6 pre-existing comorbidities
[50:04.720 --> 50:16.880]  the people between one to 17 years old they're about 73 million one to 73 year olds in the united
[50:16.880 --> 50:29.040]  states 60 percent of those that were hospitalized according to the cdc were obese oh and how many
[50:29.040 --> 50:38.400]  died well again the numbers it's around under 2000 over a period of almost three years wait a minute
[50:39.040 --> 50:55.840]  2000 people from one uh 73 million died 2000 at a 73 million died and you're injecting them
[50:55.840 --> 51:04.320]  with an operation warp speed genes therapy inoculation yes and if you don't get one you
[51:04.320 --> 51:14.800]  don't have a job yeah hi hitler welcome to america oh my my choice gerald it's my body my choice if i
[51:14.800 --> 51:18.720]  want to kill that baby and then you ask the same people do i have a choice to take a vaccine
[51:18.720 --> 51:25.200]  well that's different oh i see not only is it different not only is it different they spent
[51:25.200 --> 51:33.440]  according to cmdc when that number came out some seven million dollars promoting the vaccination
[51:33.440 --> 51:39.840]  i'm sure you saw this state supreme court in syracuse new york struck down a statewide mandate
[51:39.840 --> 51:47.920]  for medical staff to be vaccinated against covid 19 in a landmark ruling issued january 13th new york
[51:47.920 --> 51:54.640]  state supreme court judge jewellery declared that statewide coveted vaccine mandate the medical
[51:54.640 --> 52:03.840]  staff null void and of no effect neary also found that the mandate was quote arbitrary and capricious
[52:04.720 --> 52:11.840]  citing evidence that cover 19 vaccines do not prevent the spread of viruses undercutting the
[52:11.840 --> 52:21.120]  basis for the mandate quote in true orwellian fashion the respondents acknowledged then current
[52:21.120 --> 52:33.040]  covid 19 shots do not prevent transmission and quote neary wrote goes on he wrote quote a term
[52:33.040 --> 52:42.080]  which is defined at the whim of an entity subject to change without a moment's notice contains all
[52:42.080 --> 52:51.600]  the hallmarks of absurdity and is no definition at all you think this made the mainstream news
[52:52.960 --> 52:59.440]  the one that you wrote about that arrogant person on the cartoon network oh that wasn't big news
[52:59.440 --> 53:05.680]  oh oh my god i wonder how johnny deppen amber heard of doing never heard of a before but only
[53:05.680 --> 53:15.200]  had to hear about it for about a year well and now they are i think some of them are realizing uh-oh
[53:15.200 --> 53:20.880]  we have a little bit of a culpability issue here we promoted these vaccines maybe they feel bad
[53:20.880 --> 53:26.640]  maybe the uh the loving liberal tolerant leftists that used to be anti big pharma they used to
[53:26.640 --> 53:31.680]  be anti big pharma here's a funny one for you are you know who um you know that little pipsqueak
[53:31.680 --> 53:39.440]  nincompoop uh robert third rike you know robert third rike no well uh he's a little he's a little
[53:39.440 --> 53:46.160]  liberal nincompoop he always pops up and uh he's spewing his liberal politics and now after promoting
[53:46.160 --> 53:52.640]  the vaccine for two years he's now publicly going against big pharma and and against them for making
[53:52.640 --> 53:58.400]  all of these profits it's so funny to watch the liberal left be be two three years late to the news
[53:58.400 --> 54:03.840]  i used to thought liberals used to be anti big pharma you know i know i know in my generation
[54:04.400 --> 54:11.120]  they're little cowards look at krozby nil's stashin nashen young look at that arrogant
[54:11.120 --> 54:19.120]  little jimmy kimmel look at that pencilhead guy pechon pencilhead one after another called bear
[54:19.120 --> 54:26.480]  little clowns little boys of nothing little boys of nothing you don't get vaccinated you have no
[54:26.480 --> 54:33.200]  rights oh by the way all of these guys you know i said i'm 76 so i'm at the height of the vietnam
[54:33.200 --> 54:40.640]  war they're drifting everybody and and by the way i was too stupid as a young guy in my early 20s i
[54:40.640 --> 54:47.600]  swallowed the crap i believed i believed that you know if we don't stop those those commies in vietnam

[54:53.040 --> 54:58.960]  little boys that protested the war that are so pro-vax you know why they protested the war
[54:59.840 --> 55:06.080]  because they were getting drafted when the draft ended the protests ended
[55:07.200 --> 55:12.880]  their arrogant little nobodies with bad attitudes yeah actually they all love the war in ukraine now

[56:14.000 --> 56:20.480]  imagination and now the american media is finally like oh well gee it seems like russia's actually

[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:15.360]  ukraine and russia is concerned saying exactly what we said when it began you're not going to defeat
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:22.560]  the russians once upon a time it was a guy named by the name of napoleon bonaparte he left Poland
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:36.160]  with 420 000 troops in 1812 to attack Moscow came back with 10 000 10 000 410 000 young guys murdered
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:44.160]  dead once upon a time not too long ago again i'm born a year after world war two there's a thing
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:54.160]  called Operation Barbarossa launched by Adolf Hitler he killed over 20 million russians
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.640]  destroyed the country who were the first to defeat the germans in world war two nope sorry it wasn't
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:12.960]  the americans it was the russians oh and this is the cover when it used to be a monthly magazine
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:22.800]  the trends journal now it's a weekly we're war or peace we the people should decide an article
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:30.320]  by dr polk reg roberts former assistant treasury secretary under ronald reagan
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:41.520]  Washington is driving the world to the final war world hegemony is not a right america has
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:48.480]  earned and this is a great anthony frida article the nobel piece of crap prize winner obama
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:53.120]  the tank with his face into it i just want to read you just a tiny part here
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:04:00.320]  Washington concluded that russia needed to be confronted with or distracted by
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:05.840]  problems that will leave the russian government less confident or able to counter washington's
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:12.080]  aggression elsewhere ukraine presented the perfect opportunity for washington
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:18.880]  to advance his hegemonic agenda in a speech at the national press club last december
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:28.560]  which was december 2013 assistant secretary of state victoria newland posted that washington
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:38.160]  invested five billion dollars in non-governmental organizations and geos in ukraine for the purpose
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:46.720]  you ready to teach democracy and now that's newland is running the same war it's newland again
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:54.720]  i know the united states over through the the public the people have no idea now the american
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.720]  media is lied to the people of almost everything about what's going on in ukraine but of course they

[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:25.120]  spear it is the alex joneshow with owen shroyer and we're here with jerald solente and and jerald i
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:32.960]  want to go back to something you said earlier about your rally your peace rally that you had
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:38.800]  recently and a phenomenon of stores wanting to close down because i think it tells a bigger story
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:43.840]  i think it tells a bigger story about what's going on in america where not too long ago and
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:49.200]  this is how a free market capitalist society would be functioning healthy uh if it was
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:54.880]  functioning healthily if somebody was coming to town let's say an event or a rally or whatever
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:02.320]  if you're a business owner you embrace that opportunity because you get business whether
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:08.000]  you agree with the politics of the people you're going to be serving or not you understand this
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.800]  is an opportunity to make business so i think it's i think it's an incredible kind of side story
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:17.520]  that when you're about to have your rally instead of embracing this opportunity for business and
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:23.600]  economy they shut down i think that's a telling story that's what happens in communist countries
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:28.560]  that's what happens happens in countries that are going the wrong way economically and and and
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:34.880]  your kind of little pocketed story there i think it just tells that story would you agree absolutely
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:40.800]  i agree with you people don't like a lot of like me but a lot of people can't stand me up here
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:47.360]  because they're little gutless cowards and they hate me because i gerald salenti am an american
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:53.920]  patriot i believe in the constitution and the bill of rights i don't believe in little clowns
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:59.280]  politicians telling me what to do i believe in human rights do what you want to do don't
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:05.360]  tell me what to do again oh and this is the this is the poster you know we put a lot of money into
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:12.000]  this we had again judge angelo palatano scott ridder gary knoll the hot damn band by the way
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.240]  the hot damn band was brought to me by um harry neville's wife who subscribes to the trends journal
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:24.800]  you know there are people that are totally pro piece but you there are more ukrainian flags
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:30.000]  these little boys little nothing little nothing little boys hanging ukrainian flags all over
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.760]  more ukrainian flags in american flags more ukrainian flags in americans 100 ukrain troops
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:45.280]  to train in in oklahoma that's a great story how about this how about 100 iraqi troops
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:52.080]  to train in moscow to defeat americans oh my god how could you do that oh they can play they say
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:58.480]  russia russia is using iranian drones for the war in ukraine oh i know right ukraine wouldn't
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.560]  even have a fighting force if it wasn't for the west if it wasn't for the united states
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:09.200]  and it was obama that it's not iranian drones those are us drones obama gave iran our drone
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:16.000]  technology it's our technology being used again the whole thing is hypocrisy and i want to make
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.960]  this point because i want to make it very clear why people need everything they do they can do to
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:29.920]  support info wars because all you're getting are lies outright lies and propaganda and i'm going to
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:35.600]  give you the proof right now and again with the trends journal you know it's the truth in trends
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:43.040]  we don't tell you what to think it's think for yourself you're ready this is cbs news thursday
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:52.000]  july 12th russia's capture of solidor would allow it to sell a much needed victory back home
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:10:01.680]  after months of humiliating setbacks and shrinking military aims stop wait a minute
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:10.160]  russia controls over 20 percent of the country and it's the strategic it's the most important
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:16.080]  20 percent it's access to the black sea it's uh crimea where a lot of the uh the farming and stuff
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:24.960]  goes on right so so what are you talking about but anyway keeps going ukraine's resolve steeled
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:35.520]  ste led by size of agreement on battle tank deliveries financial times you ready uk and
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:42.800]  poland confirm tanks to ukraine and this is my favorite line ukraine says it needs 300 tanks
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:49.920]  to be able to liberate its territories from russian occupation how about 320 tanks gerald
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:55.440]  are we making up this number four 300 tanks and they repeat this like like you like they
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.600]  thought what they're talking about yeah tanks a lot but hold on it's not even but the tanks the
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:06.080]  tank story is actually even worse so here's how ridiculous this tank situation is we're giving
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:11.360]  ukraine american tank technology which actually the russians have better tank technology because
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.560]  their tanks run on i believe it's some sort of a nuclear fusion energy whereas our tanks
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.960]  are still burning gasoline or it might be it might be reversed that i'm sorry i think it's
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:27.360]  reversed that so in other words russian tanks you cannot see from satellite radar russian tanks
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:33.840]  do not put a heat indicator out on a map they run cold so they can move throughout the territory
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:39.520]  and not be spotted by radar or satellites american tanks not so much they do put out a heat signature
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:45.840]  so as soon as american tanks arrive on the soil and ukraine is using them for the war every single
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:52.400]  russian satellite picks it up and can bomb it with a guided missile immediately and and of course
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:57.280]  of course the military industrial complex doesn't care jerald they're raking in money hand over fist
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:02.160]  and then we give ukraine basically these i mean that's like going into a war wearing a hot pink
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:10.160]  fluorescent yellow costume saying you'll never find me and and the hypocrisy beyond that how come
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:17.920]  they were uncovering the disastrous iraq war like this every day in the media how come they were
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:23.360]  oh because they've embedded reporters or they're in bed with the government you do what we tell
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:29.040]  you to do how come the new york times the toilet paper of record how come they weren't covering
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:36.960]  this day after day after day like they do the ukraine war dbc how about one after how come they
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:43.920]  weren't doing it day after day with the afghan war how come because their prostitutes their
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.360]  media whores they get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and government war masters again
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:54.160]  why the people need to support info wars because you're you know i got info wars every day to get
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.240]  the news that you're putting out there and i got a lot of different places but you guys are really
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:03.360]  on top of it so people have to do everything they can to support this and again we're giving them
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.160]  history before it happens with the trends journal and i want to just keep going on with this to show
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:15.200]  the people why russia's set for rare success with control of key town that was the financial
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:20.640]  size what's again they'll control over 20 for success gerald rare success i mean i look i'm
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.040]  not trying to laugh at the plight of the ukrainians but folks i mean that is a joke the ukrainian
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:32.560]  the ukrainian army is devastated get devastated they're losing you ready for this one russia's
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:42.880]  vladimir putin afraid of coup a source who is close to putin claimed that the president will
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:51.120]  nominate his chosen heir already this year and this goes on this is from the british daily
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:57.280]  according to his former ally putin will want to transfer his power to his chosen
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:04.640]  rather than risk a coup against him and of course we'll be lied to about this too because the real
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.960]  the real situation and this is what the american media is lying about folks you got to understand
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:13.920]  putin actually has a soft spot in his in his makeup for the west he kind of romanticizes
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.880]  the west a little bit the generals and a lot of the people behind putin they despise the west
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:24.240]  the reason why if if the story is true the reason why there might be pressure to get rid of putin
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.560]  is because he hasn't gone hard enough against america the generals and some of these people
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.480]  behind putin are like what are you doing why are we putting up with this crap from these american
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:41.680]  cross-dressing fags again this is another one so now they're saying how putin's ratings are tanking
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:51.520]  right they say that and then i looked it up putin's approval rating ends at in 2022 so a couple of
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:58.960]  weeks ago 81 percent 81 percent of the people's support of yeah but by the end of like 20 percent
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:07.840]  so you combine the two that's 100 oh by the way the more biden goes down in the polls and this
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:13.120]  thing is going to bring them down with him stealing the documents when all else fails they take you
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:17.440]  to war they're going to get the people's mind off it yep and they're going to ramp up the ukraine war
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:22.960]  same with the crashing economy jerald it's the same tactic yep yep when when all else fails
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.560]  they take us to war i let's pick up on that on the other side we're about to go to break here with
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:33.760]  jerald salenti let's pick up on that issue and the latest with the documents uh folks i don't know
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:39.280]  i mean this they tried to cover this up back in november and they did but they're obviously afraid
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:43.120]  of subpoenas coming from the house i don't know why else they would be admitting all these secret
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.920]  documents now uh that's the only thing i can figure we'll get jerald salenti's take on that from

[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:40.160]  transmission 8 a.m all the way through midnight on tuesday the links to share conspiracy fact
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:44.960]  dot info alex was right dot com jerald solente is our guest here on the alex jones show this sunday
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:51.840]  owens shawar filling in here's some of the latest when it comes to the biden documents and it's
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.040]  it's almost like the water is so muddy that i'm a little confused at how many different
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:02.800]  troves of classified documents biden stole now it's at 345 it's hard to even keep track
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:08.160]  more classified documents find it found at biden's delaware home so he's keeping them in his home
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:12.080]  they're not even as safe they're hanging out in the garage they're hanging out above a steakhouse
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:16.880]  aids and lawyers are finding them in files they covered it up when they discovered it in november
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:21.120]  now they're acting like oh we're doing an investigation it's all above board former clinton
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.640]  advisor david gergen says biden risks being creamed by docks case very very big deal
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:33.920]  except he's a democrat and a and a and he's compromised by china and other countries so i
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:37.360]  don't think i don't think he's really going to get burned and i mean i don't think they want
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:42.720]  kamala harris in there there's one winner in the biden documents discovery donald trump
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:47.200]  says the guardian oh that's hilarious so i love this so they're admitting that the whole thing
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:52.320]  against trump was political but now that biden actually committed the crimes they're accusing
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:57.680]  trump of now trumps in the clear isn't that funny admitting the whole thing was political but biden
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:02.640]  blew it for him kentucky democrats suggest joe biden may be impeached for war crimes in ukraine
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:07.040]  yeah starting a war with russia without congressional approval kind of a big deal um and then there's
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:11.520]  the biden family you know they love to tell you how tight-knit of a family they are but uh they never
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:16.400]  invite their granddaughter to the christmas parties and now hunter biden wants total distance
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:20.640]  hunter biden asked court to deny a strange four-year-old daughter taking his surname
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:27.440]  how many kids does hunter biden have and how many grandkids does joe biden have that they never
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:33.200]  allow around the family even worse than bill clinton that's amazing representative matt gates
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:37.760]  downloads on corrupt dc swamp if you think differently you're hunted that's right just like
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:43.760]  elon musk was now facing us fraud trial over a tesla tweet but getting back to the biden documents
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:49.600]  jerald you know i look at this and i really think there's an there's an organic level here i think
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:55.600]  i i don't see how the deep state of the democrats have any advantage in taking biden out right now
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:59.600]  i don't think they want kamala harris she's the the globalist certainly don't want kamala harris
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.400]  joe biden is the compromised one joe biden is the total puppet we all know harris you know that
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:08.800]  she might get a little uppity and she's not compromised i think by foreign interests like
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:14.160]  biden is but with the whole trump thing in the documents now they have to focus on these documents
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:18.160]  because they made a big deal about trump they tried to hide it november now they're having to
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:22.640]  admit it i think because they're afraid of house subpoenas but jerald what's your take on the whole
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.960]  biden stealing classified documents phenomenon do you think it's organic do you think it's a
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:30.560]  controlled thing do you think they want him out what do you think is going on jerald solente
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:35.840]  yeah i don't know i don't know what they're going to do but the thing is no they won't put
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:41.520]  kamala harris in there they'll get somebody else in there running for um you know they keep
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:46.960]  they keep bringing him down so he won't run in uh 2024 but they're saying that he's going to
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:52.080]  announce within several weeks whether or not he's going to be running let's go back to the documents
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:59.600]  they're going to start finding stuff about um hunt the biden again going back to your trends
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:06.000]  journals going back to 2014 after the united states over through the democratically elected
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:15.040]  government of viktor yanukovic all of a sudden hunt the biden and christ heins the stepson
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:23.280]  of another arrogant boy born on third base and thought he had a home run john carrey that's
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:30.720]  right is christ heins of the heins 57 family they get a deal with barisma energy a corrupt
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:37.760]  like the rest of ukraine corporation and they're making millions of dollars sitting on the
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:44.320]  board of directors of barisma energy what does hunt the biden or christie heins know about energy
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:55.200]  nothing it's just one dirty deal that might come out and again as i'm saying when all else fails
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:04.320]  they take you to war let's go back not ancient history 2021 biden pulls all the troops out of
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:12.240]  afghanistan no the canada television ain't gonna take over we'll be in control of cabal they're
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:17.760]  not going to take over and what happens a bunch of american troops get slaughtered oh and on the
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:23.120]  way out the american troops slaughtered a bunch of innocent people that they covered up oh what
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:34.560]  else happened countless scores of billions of dollars of weapons our money left over there for
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:48.000]  the taliban to use oh and biden's plummeting in the polls and then last year just around this time
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.640]  they start heating up with the ukraine war and the more the more biden comes out we're gonna
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:59.280]  punish putin this and that that's a quote punish putin he keeps going up in the polls
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:07.680]  again when all else fails they take you to war what followed what followed world the the great
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:15.920]  depression world war two what followed the dot-com bus the nasdaq it was gone that y2 baloney over
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:25.680]  oh all of a sudden 9 11 the people again 88 percent of the people swallowed little georgie
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:33.200]  bushes crap we're going to get that guy oh some of the blood dead alive you're going to do the same
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:40.080]  thing the deeper biden goes down the more he's going to ramp up this war and the morons that
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:48.320]  know nothing about the facts are going to follow that's the way we see it yeah there's a covering
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:54.000]  god you know in god we trust what god you know i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:01.840]  of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god one nation of no god supports

[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:15.920]  for liberty and justice for all it's only punishment to the fullest and we the people of
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:22.480]  slave landia while the crooks like the jp morgan chase gang that gets five felonies
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:30.240]  rigging the precious metals market gets a slap on the wrist for 900 million dollars in 2019

[01:27:53.360 --> 01:28:02.320]  unless you're in a secured room again i believe that i i'm guessing i don't know this if this has
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:08.720]  to do with ukraine i'm telling you what's gonna happen biden's just gonna ramp up the war people

[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:17.760]  world order it's alex jones
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:25.840]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow and now your
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:34.720]  host olyn shroyer it's actually a mystical phenomenon that everything they accuse donald
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:40.240]  trump of they're guilty of we're talking about the democrats generally speaking colluding with russia
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:46.400]  oh no that was hillary clinton that was joe biden that's right stealing classified documents no that
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:52.880]  was barack obama no that was joe biden no that was hillary clinton and so i could continue to go on
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.440]  i mean do i even need to get into the whole me too thing uh bill clinton compared to donald trump
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:05.760]  i think we get the picture so biden is being exposed uh whether it's organic or part of some
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:10.160]  some other ulterior motive biden is getting exposed for stealing the classified documents
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:14.160]  there's nothing they can really do to cover it up the only thing they can do is to drop the charges
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:19.200]  against donald trump to protect joe biden except uh jail salenta you know one thing they like to do
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:23.440]  to distract when they're about to go down and let me just emphasize this before you respond
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:29.760]  not just about the secret documents being exposed but really jerald it it really comes down to
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:37.200]  they're collapsing the economy and so the the big giant thieves that have stolen all of our money
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:43.040]  collapsing the economy they know their time in the barrel is ahead of them so if they send us to war
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:49.200]  or as classical uh geopolitical criminals do they send us to war hoping that's the big distraction
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:55.120]  so they don't be held accountable for what they've done yep and you know you had that you had that
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:03.920]  you showed that cartoon of biden in his corvette and um they they said uh when he was questioned
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:11.200]  you know by a reporter on thursday they asked biden why he kept such files next to his classic
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:20.160]  corvette in his garage he said by the way my corvette is in a locked garage it's not likely
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:28.320]  they're sitting sitting out on the street that's the response yeah because nobody has a safe in
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:33.360]  their house you know we just leave things in our garage yeah but that that's the arrogant stupidity
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:38.640]  and they get away with it and again what we're talking about is not important because the
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:45.120]  cartoon news network this i just took a look with one of the major stories are right on cnn.com the
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:52.320]  front page university of georgia football player and staff member killed in car crash hours after
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:59.280]  championship celebration that's not news what if your buddy's killed in a car crash your mother your
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:05.360]  father nobody cares oh wait wait a minute a football player we heard about the other football player
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:11.440]  that got tackled in they had a heart condition this is news what i'm saying oh and is they're
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:16.640]  doing this to distract the people from the real issues and we were talking about what
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:23.600]  biden's going to do so now he met with the prime minister of japan you ready for this
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:31.280]  biden hailed what he called quote a remarkable moment in the u.s. japan alliance
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:40.480]  and praised kashida the prime minister of japan's decision last month to double its military budget
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:50.080]  and boost its offensive capacity biden declared that the u.s. you ready was fully thoroughly
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:57.040]  completely committed to the defense defense of japan using all means and you know what other
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:06.640]  means we're going to use nuclear weapons meanwhile the borders wide open what i could give a damn
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:13.680]  about japan oh you mean japan the bomb pearl harbor that's japan to japan that's not supposed to
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:19.920]  build up its military because of the atrocities they committed in world war two and truman doubled
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:27.120]  down on applied bombs away over nosaki and hiroshima killing a couple of hundred thousand innocent
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:35.040]  japanese or that world war two and check this out you ready u.s. defense secretary lord austin
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:46.000]  declared that 2023 was quote an inflection point for our national security and defense strategies
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:59.520]  aligning closer than ever end quote with japan don't every american know that our national security
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:06.880]  and defense strategies depend on aligning with japan we're feeling the but i am an american
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:14.400]  i believe in the founding fathers you little low lives i believe in george washington
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:21.360]  but you're too stupid you clowns to read his farewell address where he warns american people
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:28.240]  not to become involved in foreign entanglements but feeling like whether it's japan concerned about
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:33.440]  america but whether it's japan whether it's ukraine i mean it's it's filling the blank
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:38.160]  whether it's israel or our military interest our foreign interests must be fully committed to
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:44.240]  align with israel or ukraine or japan or i forget what day of the week it is and by the way
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:49.760]  you know they're spreading our military though so thin i think china is acting strategically here
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:56.800]  as is russia you know eventually the the proxy groups and the cia groups and and whatever the
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:01.520]  government is doing in syria is going to come to the front of the picture here too they've been
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:06.400]  stealing oil from syria and now the chinese are saying you better stop that so eventually they're
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:11.040]  going to have to go back into syria too i mean so our military is spread out all over the world
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.640]  doing things that really don't interest the american people at all meanwhile the southern
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:19.760]  border is wide open and now we do we have the same military industrial complex getting rich off the
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:25.440]  backs of of innocent people around the world and now the exact same crooks doing the exact same
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:33.680]  game plan oh we're about to get exposed for crimes let's start a war to distract you got it and then
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:45.520]  the other arrogant guy rama manuel who was under the the the obama administration now he's a us
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:52.240]  ambassador to japan rama manual told the washington post that biden casheeda were working quote
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:40:03.120]  to shrink the distance between the transatlantic and the indopacific into a single strategic sphere
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:11.680]  in what quote is probably one of the biggest developments that the two leaders have produced
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:19.200]  isn't that nice isn't that nice no it's amazing watching the american media ignore this big
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:26.480]  phenomenon totally totally totally ignored and here check this out currently there are 18 000
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:36.400]  u.s marines in okinawa as part of the 54 000 american military personnel stationed on bases
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:45.920]  throughout japan isn't that great our country going down into really yeah yeah but look look
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:52.400]  at the infrastructure this country look how it's going down the toilet look at the 63 percent of
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:58.400]  american people living paycheck to paycheck look at the difficulty people are having with inflation
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:04.640]  going up can't afford to buy food but hey we're going to keep sending more money overseas and
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:14.720]  have strategic alliances and end end the bottom line is look at the clowns the morons the evil
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:24.000]  imbeciles that are telling us what to do well i think that you know eventually the american people
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:30.160]  have got to realize whether it happens in mass or slowly but surely how much the american media has
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:35.680]  disinformed them i mean everything that's come out about the war in ukraine as far as the mainstream
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:41.520]  american media is concerned it's about 95 percent inaccurate and just completely missing the ball
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:45.760]  and i don't know whether that's because they feel loyal to the military industrial complex or
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:50.080]  whether they really believe this crap but it's amazing to watch the geopolitical phenomenon
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:55.840]  happening of russia and china and then and then the phenomenon of bricks coming together and this
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:01.840]  is crushing our strength in the world we're just being crushed we're being crushed we are going to
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:09.360]  go into a socioeconomic downturn the likes of which are unprecedented in this country and again
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:15.200]  they're very happy that you're saying and the raising the interest rates are working because
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:21.920]  wages are going down i'm not making that up they're happy that wages are going down so the
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:28.400]  plantation workers of slave landia don't have to make more money and the figs can make more money
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:33.600]  yeah but joe biden says we've got the lowest unemployment rate oh but it doesn't matter
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:38.880]  because you can't even afford gas you can't even afford eggs that is if you can find eggs on the
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:45.120]  shelf and you can't afford your energy bill your price at the pump is all going up and so
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:51.200]  but the american media hey we got to fight that war in ukraine and russia is losing
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:55.680]  and joe biden is doing a great job zero percent unemployment yeah you know where zero percent

[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:10.160]  let me let's go let's go local for you you've got your new mayor eric adams uh you know i mean he's
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:15.200]  not as bad as de Blasio but that's a pretty low bar so i'm not really sure that's much of an
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:20.560]  accomplishment but you know i find it funny his response to the immigration issues that are hitting
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:26.240]  new york city and he comes out uh mayor eric adams acknowledges biden's immigration policy failure
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:30.080]  he then came out and recently said that the illegal immigration is costing new york city
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:36.000]  over a billion dollars a year now here's what i find ironic so they recognize that the illegal
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.080]  immigration problem is a crisis for new york city but they refuse to recognize how it's an issue
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:47.040]  for the entire country at large it's an amazing thing that they refuse to make that recognition
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:53.760]  jerald again he's just another arrogant guy and people forget about the whole immigration thing
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:50:00.320]  when i was a young kid you know in growing up i remember they wanted to bring my cousin
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:06.000]  constantine over from italy but they couldn't it would do it wasn't allowed they had very strict
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:12.720]  very strict regulations on bringing people in from other countries and then the the low life
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:21.680]  to changed it the beginning of the end was uh lbj and the guy that gave us the vietnam war as well
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:30.320]  you know uh kennedy uh robert kennedy jack kennedy was against the vietnam war and um eight months
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:37.200]  after he's assassinated what's his name uh lbj gets us into vietnam war and then they start
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:42.880]  bringing in all cheap labor and that was the beginning and that's why they did it and it
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:51.040]  kept expanding with the h1b things the visas on and on i wrote about it in detail in my book trends
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:59.680]  2000 which was an international bestseller that came out in 1996 so what they're doing is they don't
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:08.720]  care because the more cheap labor they get in here the big look again when i was a young guy like i
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:15.520]  said earlier there were no chains they were all stores and if you work like in a in a in a drug
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:21.920]  store or a grocery store so you know i think i want to do one of these one day no more every time oh
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:31.520]  and every time i go into a home depot a lows at any time i go into any of these chain stores which
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:38.960]  i try to avoid my heartbreaks when i see the people working there and knowing that they have absolutely
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:47.120]  no future amazon trucks they didn't exist five years ago oh by the way what do we spend a hundred
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:55.040]  and something twenty thousand dollars to educate a person from kindergarten k-12 and so they could
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:52:04.800]  get a job working for amazon or or or fedex look what this country's gone down to so all they do
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:11.520]  is they want to give us nothing and steal everything that's the bottom line and the whole
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:17.360]  the whole umbrella that they put this under is climate change and they say oh you need to limit
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:23.520]  your carbon emissions so just be a good slave live in your pod eat the bugs don't drive a vehicle
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:29.520]  don't get in an airplane and and i think that their plan overall is make life as miserable
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:36.080]  as possible make it as impossible as it possibly as it can be to be financially successful
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:41.440]  and and you see some people already buying into that so instead of saying you know what i recognize
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:47.040]  that it might be harder to live free these days because of economic stress but i'd still rather
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:51.440]  live free than be a slave where you see what i what i just i call it as i see it i just see the
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:57.040]  american left accepting their slavery just saying no i'll save the climate i'll be a good slave no i'd
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:05.120]  much rather have dangerous freedom than safe slavery again as i said to you nightlife is
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:13.520]  dead life there's no these could be bands playing everywhere you know i you know van
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:20.720]  morrison he wanted to meet me and i met him in um september at the um forest hill stadium
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:28.640]  him and it was great they went against van morrison because he condemned when they started
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:34.240]  shutting down every place and destroying the lives and livelihoods of the entertainment
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:39.760]  industry people couldn't go out and play anymore you were banned again and just like they make
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:46.720]  up all this stupid stuff and people swallow it stand six feet apart the wind only blows exactly
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:52.640]  where your mask where that we're in there well no but you could take it off when you're eating
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:58.000]  and drinking in an airplane when you sit down with you because don't you know all in that
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.920]  well you could take it off when you're eating and drinking in an airplane because the covid knows
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:05.920]  you're eating and drinking it won't bother you no that's right jared and and the covid also has
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:10.800]  strict guidelines as far as timing is concerned and so that's why they shut you would oh they'll
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:14.880]  oh you can be open till eight o'clock p.m but then you got to shut down because we all know the
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:20.800]  virus goes crazy after eight and when you walk into a restaurant wear a mask but when you sit down
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:26.240]  you could take it off because the virus does not go with table length it knows this jail the virus
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:33.520]  has respect very very small virus there is a respect about how about all those plexiglass
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:39.680]  shields with the virus never went under it or around it no but but of course of the effort if
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:44.480]  you remember the first science when they were really trying to get the people to be afraid
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:50.080]  they released this video you may recall it was somebody in a grocery store aisle and they're
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:55.200]  walking pushing their cart and they just go and there's a cough and then they have this spray
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:01.280]  from the cough and it travels everywhere it travels over over the aisles and and through
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:07.120]  the counter and through the aisle and up through the the the ventilation of the air conditioning
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:14.400]  oh but the plexiglass will save us Gerald yeah i know and how about all those poor little kids
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:19.840]  that they had in these little tents playing instruments i mean you know what i'm saying
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:25.840]  to you oh and the damage that this is done is incalculable yeah this society's going down big
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:33.040]  time they suck the joy out of life there's no there's no funny like again you know this country
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:40.400]  went from you know music was America's greatest export from ragtime to swing to to rock and roll

[01:55:55.040 --> 01:56:01.280]  a renaissance we have to go back to the true heart and soul of this country when it was the
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:07.520]  land of opportunity start putting the the antitrust laws back in place that prohibited the big
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:14.000]  simoning everything and little clowns like jimmy codd and the peanut farmer allowed interstate
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.480]  banking they weren't allowed to go into state before they were only interest state he did away
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:25.200]  with the usury laws he deregulated the airline industry now the big zone everything bill clinton
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:31.200]  the glass steagle act and they pay me three hundred dollars an hour with golden sacks to bs you could
