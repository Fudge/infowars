[00:47.960 --> 00:52.480]  of all the market turmoil that is only intensifying in Asia Europe and the
[00:52.480 --> 00:57.240]  United States centered in around not just Greece but of course Portugal Spain

[01:25.320 --> 01:30.320]  to go up in about 15 minutes at prisonplanet.com Paul Watson is writing
[01:30.320 --> 01:35.120]  it right now audio has been discovered of Cass Sunstein the White House
[01:35.120 --> 01:40.520]  regulations arm who two years ago wrote white paper for the Chicago law school
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.720]  as well as Harvard in a joint operation calling for the absolute end of free
[01:45.720 --> 01:50.520]  speech and the arrest of anyone the government disagrees with of course
[01:50.520 --> 01:54.600]  there is many as seven others that Watson's posting videos in the article
[01:54.600 --> 02:01.680]  on other czars calling for absolute draconian attacks on free speech and of
[02:01.680 --> 02:05.240]  course we now have gotten more and more of the quotes when she was a law clerk
[02:05.240 --> 02:11.960]  and then a lawyer never been a judge of Kagan the new Supreme Court nominee
[02:11.960 --> 02:17.560]  Elena Kagan and here's the Hill newspaper new GOP argument against Kagan
[02:17.560 --> 02:26.280]  she could ban books that's not an argument if I argue that the other the
[02:26.280 --> 02:30.960]  head of the Manson murders is Charlie Manson he's been convicted of that and
[02:30.960 --> 02:38.640]  he admits he did it he admits he ordered Sharon Tate to be butchered okay
[02:38.640 --> 02:44.800]  that's not arguing that it's not arguing the fact that the Atlantic Ocean is off
[02:44.800 --> 02:48.880]  the coast of New York City it's not arguing the fact that the Gulf of
[02:48.880 --> 02:53.720]  Mexico's got oil all over it it's not arguing that there's a world government
[02:53.720 --> 02:57.320]  that's been set up it's totally illegal and oppressive and unelected it's a
[02:57.320 --> 03:03.320]  public fact okay so I'm sick of it I'm sick of it so I called Watson this
[03:03.320 --> 03:07.560]  morning and said I want it about earlier this morning and I said I want you to
[03:07.560 --> 03:12.240]  write an article with it all because we keep putting out articles every day or
[03:12.240 --> 03:18.280]  two with new things discovered on Kagan where she's an anti-second amendment
[03:18.280 --> 03:25.520]  anti-free speech thug I mean she's too extreme for China communist China now
[03:25.520 --> 03:29.240]  they love her in North Korea Paul Pot would have loved her I mean she's of
[03:29.240 --> 03:38.320]  that bad she's that bad and he goes well okay I'll do that later in the day
[03:38.320 --> 03:43.640]  Alex I'm working on a Cass Sunstein article and we've got the audio and it
[03:43.640 --> 03:48.680]  dovetails with all of the written policy papers he's put out and this gives us a
[03:48.680 --> 03:53.800]  very clear image of how they're going to go after free speech in America and how
[03:53.800 --> 03:59.000]  they're going to phase it in and they do want the fairness doctrine for every
[03:59.000 --> 04:08.760]  website info wars dot com prison planet dot com you will not be able to go to my
[04:08.760 --> 04:12.520]  website and read the news that we link to in the articles we write before it's
[04:12.520 --> 04:16.200]  been approved by the federal government and then after they approve it if they
[04:16.200 --> 04:20.120]  so feel that that's what they should do you have to then post in it what they
[04:20.120 --> 04:24.520]  want quote the other side so I guess if we write an article saying the health
[04:24.520 --> 04:27.680]  care bill was written by the insurance companies which is a public fact now
[04:27.680 --> 04:32.720]  admitted I'd have to then post links and articles by the government and the
[04:32.720 --> 04:39.520]  media lying in our information or if I say page 15 of the bill doesn't let you
[04:39.520 --> 04:43.280]  buy your own private insurance but clearly states you have to buy what the
[04:43.280 --> 04:48.080]  government approves just like FEMA flood insurance which is a fact no I
[04:48.080 --> 04:53.560]  couldn't do that I'd have to mix their lies in look they're in trouble and they
[04:53.560 --> 04:56.400]  know it and they're coming after the internet and your free speech we're

[09:53.880 --> 09:57.120]  fighting the quote criminal banks when she's completely bought and paid for by
[09:57.120 --> 10:00.880]  them but that's because these people are so politically desperate their banker
[10:00.880 --> 10:04.720]  masters have said okay go ahead and play the part of the good guys say we're the
[10:04.720 --> 10:08.240]  bad guys and then basically create a process where you claim you're
[10:08.240 --> 10:12.960]  investigating us and then down the road you can give us a a fine of maybe one
[10:12.960 --> 10:18.360]  one thousandth of what we've stolen and we'll send some mid-level trailer a

[10:30.800 --> 10:35.120]  inventories depleted again panicking a German dealer stage run on Krugerans
[10:35.120 --> 10:40.920]  that is important news we'll talk about that with Max Kaiser coming up also a
[10:40.920 --> 10:46.160]  White House's Volcker joins Merkel and others saying future of the euro is in
[10:46.160 --> 10:49.880]  doubt Europe's debt troubles could undermine its currency White House
[10:49.880 --> 10:54.840]  advisor Paul Verk Volcker said over the weekend a trichette calls for more
[10:54.840 --> 11:02.040]  control in the euro zones Europe's top central banker has rubbish suggestions
[11:02.040 --> 11:05.880]  or thrown away suggestions that the single currency is under attack by
[11:05.880 --> 11:09.560]  speculators oh certainly not they're just publicly doing it
[11:09.560 --> 11:16.440]  despite the euro plummeting to a 19th month low against the dollar and then
[11:16.440 --> 11:22.560]  Merkel a headline times of London battered as Germans lose faith in EU and
[11:22.560 --> 11:28.160]  major German newspapers are calling for a return to a Deutsche Mark based
[11:28.160 --> 11:35.600]  super currency of elite European rich nations France would not even make the
[11:35.600 --> 11:39.920]  cut fact here's a headline from Business Insider with links to the London
[11:39.920 --> 11:46.800]  Telegraph Ambrose Evans Pritchard today Germans fantasize about new Reich nation
[11:46.800 --> 11:52.720]  currency or new land currency block that doesn't even include France tonight's
[11:52.720 --> 11:57.240]  must read comes from Ambrose Evans Pritchard at the Telegraph who offers
[11:57.240 --> 12:03.440]  some clear views on why the EU's big shock and all rescue plan is not having
[12:03.440 --> 12:09.960]  its desired result and why it hasn't fully instilled confidence again it's
[12:09.960 --> 12:16.280]  tonight in Europe this article just came out part of it is this whole
[12:16.280 --> 12:22.560]  insistence on the part of leaders that the goal was to go after the wolf pack
[12:22.560 --> 12:28.640]  of speculators this screams willful ignorance of the real structural
[12:28.640 --> 12:33.920]  problems at hand even if it is just rhetorical yeah I mean the very central
[12:33.920 --> 12:37.280]  bankers that are rating their own European Union I mean that's the European
[12:37.280 --> 12:43.560]  Union was designed to rob Europe are now claiming that this isn't going on then
[12:43.560 --> 12:48.200]  there are the continuing concerns about the bailout mechanism beyond that
[12:48.200 --> 12:53.840]  Europe is losing the Germans the Germans are threatening to pull out
[12:53.840 --> 12:59.440]  Chancellor Merkel has put the best face on a deal that hasn't so damaged her
[12:59.440 --> 13:03.920]  leadership if the euro fails and Europe fails and the idea of the European
[13:03.920 --> 13:10.160]  Union fails she said too late I think the German nation is moving on I was
[13:10.160 --> 13:16.880]  struck by a piece in the Frankfurter Almagente proposing a new hard currency
[13:16.880 --> 13:23.680]  made up of the German Austrian Finland the Czech Republic Poland but without
[13:23.680 --> 13:29.720]  France the piece entitled the alternative says deflation policies may
[13:29.720 --> 13:34.760]  push Greece to the brink of civil war and concludes that Europe would be better
[13:34.760 --> 13:41.760]  off of it abandoned the attempt to hold together two incompatible halves it can
[13:41.760 --> 13:49.000]  be done the prestigious newspaper said and then it goes on with Nicolas
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.040]  Sarkozy the embattled French president almost lost control of their
[13:54.040 --> 13:59.400]  parliament Germany and regional elections they have them staggered
[13:59.400 --> 14:04.320]  Merkel is very close to losing control just like Brown was a month ago and now
[14:04.320 --> 14:08.160]  he's gone I mean the point is the people are gonna throw these people out on
[14:08.160 --> 14:12.440]  their hind ends and they're not drinking fluoride in Germany they're not as
[14:12.440 --> 14:20.320]  dumb down in in Deutschland as we are here and they do not have electronic
[14:20.320 --> 14:24.080]  voting machines in all of their provinces like we do here our states and
[14:24.080 --> 14:32.480]  they actually have some voting so bye bye Merkel bye bye Sarkozy bye bye Greek
[14:32.480 --> 14:38.640]  leaders bye bye anybody bye bye Gordon Brown and look it took people six years
[14:38.640 --> 14:42.000]  to wake up to Bush being a fraud it took them less than a year in polls to wake
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.680]  up to Obama being a fraud eighty plus percent approval ratings now down at 40
[14:45.680 --> 14:53.880]  and when they put in Mr. Cameron and he's now in there it'll take months for
[14:53.880 --> 15:00.080]  the brits to wake up to this being a bait and switch see what took years now
[15:00.080 --> 15:05.080]  takes months the wake up is much much faster now and that's why the globalist
[15:05.080 --> 15:08.760]  are gonna start a big war with Iran as a distraction that's why they'll probably
[15:08.760 --> 15:12.560]  stage terror attacks as a distraction from what they're doing because this is a
[15:12.560 --> 15:19.360]  make-it-or-break-it scenario this is an all-in all chips on the table they've
[15:19.360 --> 15:24.080]  laid their cards on the table they are going all the way they're not backing
[15:24.080 --> 15:28.720]  off they're not gonna stop they're in trouble here's the analogy they are a
[15:28.720 --> 15:35.720]  race car in the final lap they are only about four cars ahead of the anti
[15:35.720 --> 15:42.160]  globalist movements around the planet who are in second place our engine is
[15:42.160 --> 15:46.640]  sputtering it's got a little smoke coming out of it and we're missing a
[15:46.640 --> 15:55.240]  fender but the bankers car is on fire the bankers car has got flames coming out
[15:55.240 --> 16:00.800]  of the engine it's blowing gaskets it is gonna blow any second and they're
[16:00.800 --> 16:05.960]  racing down the final stretch and I don't know if they're gonna make it
[16:05.960 --> 16:10.840]  across if they don't stage terror attacks and start new wars they're not
[16:10.840 --> 16:16.600]  gonna make it across the finish line and they will probably blow up as they
[16:16.600 --> 16:21.160]  cross the finish line engulfing their system in flames even if they start a
[16:21.160 --> 16:25.680]  war but they can't stop it's their nature the reason they're in power is
[16:25.680 --> 16:30.600]  they're so bold they are brave and they're cunning and they're intelligent and
[16:30.600 --> 16:35.800]  they're totally ruthless and evil and so we have just got a focus we've got to
[16:35.800 --> 16:40.120]  get in the zone in our race car and just don't make mistakes don't think we've
[16:40.120 --> 16:44.880]  got it on this final stretch don't let and and there's another thing there's
[16:44.880 --> 16:48.800]  all the confusion the smoke pouring off of the car three or four links ahead of
[16:48.800 --> 16:54.440]  us the flames coming off of it the oil leaking can can can make us go into the
[16:54.440 --> 16:59.120]  wall or can make us spin out and go into all the other cars behind us I mean
[16:59.120 --> 17:04.800]  this is serious ladies and gentlemen their car is on fire right now our
[17:04.800 --> 17:09.600]  engine is is is is hammering and starting to really make some dangerous
[17:09.600 --> 17:14.920]  noises here you know we're pressing on the accelerator and we can notice that
[17:14.920 --> 17:19.560]  we're starting to keep the momentum up but more smoke comes out of our engine
[17:19.560 --> 17:25.680]  when we press down on the pedal and so there's your analogy your NASCAR analogy
[17:25.680 --> 17:31.480]  for the day but this is it okay this is it and it's only gonna get crazier it's
[17:31.480 --> 17:37.400]  a quickening it's an acceleration from this point on the likes of which this
[17:37.400 --> 17:41.960]  planet has never seen the next year the next two years the next three years the
[17:41.960 --> 17:46.760]  next decade is gonna have fireworks that are gonna be off the charts the feds
[17:46.760 --> 17:51.240]  are clearly going with race war here in the United States they decided to make
[17:51.240 --> 17:55.320]  it anglows versus Hispanics we've got to try to stop that they're clearly going
[17:55.320 --> 17:59.200]  with a war with Iran they're clearly going with domestic attacks to blame it
[17:59.200 --> 18:04.840]  on conservatives libertarians and veterans we know the different situation
[18:04.840 --> 18:09.640]  the different you know things they're doing in the situation we're in and it's
[18:09.640 --> 18:14.360]  just gonna get wilder I mean I it gives me chills just to talk about it the
[18:14.360 --> 18:18.040]  situation we're all in together here and we've got to come together as freedom
[18:18.040 --> 18:24.320]  lovers as Americans as patriots people have to choose a side if you've tuned

[18:47.320 --> 18:52.760]  and destroyed yourself in the process for sure it is better to choose the side

[22:02.480 --> 22:05.840]  familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit
[22:05.840 --> 22:09.640]  spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that
[22:09.640 --> 22:13.200]  some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can
[22:13.200 --> 22:17.320]  remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion
[22:17.320 --> 22:20.840]  of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending
[22:20.840 --> 22:24.480]  will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[22:24.480 --> 22:28.160]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[22:28.160 --> 22:32.040]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[22:32.040 --> 22:35.840]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[22:35.840 --> 22:39.840]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability
[22:39.840 --> 22:44.520]  I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned
[22:44.520 --> 22:48.120]  into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been driven
[22:48.120 --> 22:52.800]  by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for more

[24:52.200 --> 24:57.000]  stations for government broadcasting 24-7 and making radio stations take

[25:49.680 --> 25:54.600]  give me a break not even Bush was this bold with his Supreme Court people they
[25:54.600 --> 25:58.440]  they never said we're gonna ban your guns they never said you can't have free
[25:58.440 --> 26:04.480]  speech okay and they even reversed Bush on secret arrest of citizens and wire
[26:04.480 --> 26:10.840]  tapping I mean you because no one is that bold to put people in who are
[26:10.840 --> 26:14.320]  openly anti-free speech but they were just saying six months ago that Cass
[26:14.320 --> 26:19.440]  Sunstein was the number one pick well instead his protege Elena Kagan is the
[26:19.440 --> 26:25.320]  one I can't even believe they're this bold and all of you Democrats out there
[26:25.320 --> 26:30.520]  shame on you you are most of you are so silent on the tyrant that Barack Obama
[26:30.520 --> 26:36.160]  is I mean we have never had a president this bad I'm gonna tell you right now
[26:36.160 --> 26:45.480]  this out on the open with just a crew of a larcenous venomous vicious destroyers
[26:45.480 --> 26:49.280]  of the Bill of Rights out in the open I mean they run their flag up at the top
[26:49.280 --> 26:52.000]  of the flagpole they are so bold I mean it's like it's White House chief of
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.600]  staff video clip after video clip on c-span it's speeches saying arrest you
[26:57.600 --> 27:02.040]  know anyone we want ban anybody from owning guns we want we're gonna make you

[27:06.420 --> 27:12.440]  military everyone must serve I mean it's just incredible but here's the article
[27:12.440 --> 27:17.800]  Obama's are once mandatory government propaganda on political websites yes we
[27:17.800 --> 27:20.720]  know he said he wants to arrest conspiracy theorist and ban free speech
[27:20.720 --> 27:26.960]  but that was in a law review two and a half years ago now we have clearly know
[27:26.960 --> 27:31.600]  how they're planning to carry this out and we have the FCC what a month ago or
[27:31.600 --> 27:35.840]  more saying we want the government to take over the media and we have a whole
[27:35.840 --> 27:39.960]  bunch of senators it's it's more than 10 in the news saying we want fairness
[27:39.960 --> 27:43.520]  doctrine for the internet now we have the FCC claiming they have jurisdiction
[27:43.520 --> 27:48.080]  over the internet because we're here telling the truth they can't compete
[27:48.080 --> 27:53.840]  with the truth they can't compete with reality their lives have been exposed so
[27:53.840 --> 27:57.520]  they're just coming around saying okay we'll just shut down your free speech this
[27:57.520 --> 28:01.080]  article is so important Obama's are once mandatory government propaganda on
[28:01.080 --> 28:04.760]  political websites disturbing audio has emerged of White House informations
[28:04.760 --> 28:09.040]  are cast Sunstein who in a previous white paper called for banning
[28:09.040 --> 28:12.640]  conspiracy theories including after Virginia global warming criticism demanded
[28:12.640 --> 28:17.360]  that websites be mandated by the law to link to opposing information or that
[28:17.360 --> 28:21.280]  pop-ups containing government propaganda could be forcibly included on
[28:21.280 --> 28:26.240]  political blogs well Google already pop-up messages if you're using them as
[28:26.240 --> 28:29.520]  a search engine over websites saying this is questionable they already use
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.000]  these big databases they sell universities high schools corporations
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.960]  where they list info wars comm prison planet comm is as bad you sure you want
[28:37.960 --> 28:43.000]  to look at this this is bad stuff in an audio excerpt yeah it's bad stuff we
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.240]  actually linked to video of these people doing all this and an audio excerpt of
[28:48.240 --> 28:52.520]  an interview which was posted on Brett Bart TV website today Sunstein discusses
[28:52.520 --> 28:57.960]  how conservative websites should provide links to liberal websites and vice versa
[28:57.960 --> 29:02.520]  or even how political blogs should be made to include pop-ups that show a
[29:02.520 --> 29:08.120]  quick argument for a competing view so so now your property your website your
[29:08.120 --> 29:12.920]  newspaper your TV station your radio station has to have government
[29:12.920 --> 29:17.520]  propaganda on it and we've got this being proposed by the New York Times a
[29:17.520 --> 29:22.640]  kindler gentler internet too and this will just be the beginning once they
[29:22.640 --> 29:25.800]  have the camel inside the tent they'll just kick us completely out this is not
[29:25.800 --> 29:30.400]  camel's nose under the tent flat this is camel in the tent Sunstein said that if
[29:30.400 --> 29:33.240]  the system could be implemented voluntarily Congress should hold
[29:33.240 --> 29:37.520]  hearings about mandates which would legally force people to dilute their
[29:37.520 --> 29:41.000]  own free speech the Harvard professor also said the blogs could be forced to

[34:16.880 --> 34:22.240]  for exactly what sunsteen's calling for a month ago he's gonna do another master
[34:22.240 --> 34:28.240]  article coming up with all of the quotes of Elena Kagan saying go after the
[34:28.240 --> 34:32.240]  second amendment ban free speech again this is finally starting to get into
[34:32.240 --> 34:37.120]  mainstream news in the Hill newspaper she could ban books new GOP argument
[34:37.120 --> 34:41.240]  against Kagan and who is she another Goldman Sachs minion other Castine
[34:41.240 --> 34:47.680]  minion so the word is getting out if they can give us a new Supreme Court
[34:47.680 --> 34:53.760]  justice who is openly a tyrant we're in trouble now let's go ahead and play this
[34:53.760 --> 35:00.600]  short clip of Cass Sunstein on talk radio I mean he said this publicly here
[35:00.600 --> 35:06.120]  it is sites of one point of view agree to provide links to other sites so that
[35:06.120 --> 35:10.520]  if you're reading a conservative magazine they would provide a link to a
[35:10.520 --> 35:15.200]  liberal site and vice versa just to make it easy for people to get access to
[35:15.200 --> 35:18.680]  competing views or maybe a pop-up on your screen that would show an
[35:18.680 --> 35:22.760]  advertisement or maybe even a quick argument for a competing view we could
[35:22.760 --> 35:26.280]  get voluntary arrangements in that direction it would be great and if we
[35:26.280 --> 35:30.680]  can't get voluntary arrangements maybe Congress should hold hearings about
[35:30.680 --> 35:35.120]  mandates for Nancy that's that's the kind of thing that I think would inflame
[35:35.120 --> 35:39.920]  people because you know why should I in trying to advance my point of view on
[35:39.920 --> 35:44.480]  my website how can you tell me that I have to direct people's attention to
[35:44.480 --> 35:50.160]  other views that I may find not just not just the views that I don't like but
[35:50.160 --> 35:53.480]  views that I might find repugnant or horrid and and well you know what
[35:53.480 --> 35:56.640]  constitutes an opposing view if I run a site that says you know we should all
[35:56.640 --> 36:00.280]  love each other do I have to have a link to the KKK but one person has
[36:00.280 --> 36:04.880]  suggested we might take the 25 most popular sites in the last month say of
[36:04.880 --> 36:12.200]  any kind and require them to have kind of a random draw links to other sites
[36:12.200 --> 36:15.920]  that are political and it would be random so that if let's say one of the most
[36:15.920 --> 36:22.880]  popular sites is CNN.com then they would have to have a little link to one or
[36:22.880 --> 36:28.240]  more of the randomly selected sites the best would be for this to be done
[36:28.240 --> 36:33.520]  voluntarily but the word voluntary is a little complicated and sometimes people
[36:33.520 --> 36:38.440]  don't do what's best for our society unless Congress holds hearings or unless
[36:38.440 --> 36:43.840]  the public demands it and the idea would be to have a legal mandate as the last
[36:43.840 --> 36:48.560]  resort and to make sure it's as neutral as possible if we have to get there but
[36:48.560 --> 36:53.560]  to have that as you know an ultimate weapon designed to encourage people to
[36:53.560 --> 36:55.000]  do better.
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.340]  Your fan of Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh try reading a few columns on the
[37:00.340 --> 37:07.960]  Huffington Post website. It may make your blood boil your mind may not be
[37:07.960 --> 37:13.360]  changed but the practice of listening to opposing views is essential for
[37:13.360 --> 37:15.640]  effective citizenship.
[37:15.640 --> 37:22.040]  Yes now almost all the top hundred news websites are CNN and other mainstream
[37:22.040 --> 37:26.320]  organs like the New York Times, Washington Post and so for the tens of
[37:26.320 --> 37:30.680]  thousands of alternative sites that together in the aggregate are bigger
[37:30.680 --> 37:34.960]  than the top sites you're now going to have to have their content and their
[37:34.960 --> 37:40.000]  propaganda all over your site and the government the FCC has now proposed this
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.440]  they're going to set up the web server system and then you've got to basically
[37:44.440 --> 37:48.640]  embed that on your site kind of like last year with the Cash for Clunkers
[37:48.640 --> 37:53.680]  program that horrified everyone when you dialed in to check it a message said the
[37:53.680 --> 37:57.280]  federal government is now taking control this is word for word of your
[37:57.280 --> 38:02.320]  computer it is now property of the U.S. government your files are being scanned
[38:02.320 --> 38:08.720]  this is what Internet 2 is where they shut off access to all of the real
[38:08.720 --> 38:13.520]  Internet and force you on to a couple thousand in their own words mainstream
[38:13.520 --> 38:17.200]  websites so in the new Internet they don't let the old Internet be repaired all
[38:17.200 --> 38:21.400]  the grids they phase it over to a new system they've already built the hubs
[38:21.400 --> 38:25.840]  four and the communication lines and the new addressing system and then there
[38:25.840 --> 38:29.560]  will only be they actually said a hundred universities and a hundred
[38:29.560 --> 38:33.280]  corporations seven years ago they proposed 50 corporations and 50
[38:33.280 --> 38:37.280]  universities run by the government controlled through their mandate and
[38:37.280 --> 38:43.960]  then you will be allowed to have a sub domain like on YouTube or Myspace or
[38:43.960 --> 38:49.280]  Facebook and then you have to sign and agree to their rules the New York Times
[38:49.280 --> 38:53.200]  and Time Magazine and Newsweek have all called for this as well and so then oh
[38:53.200 --> 38:58.960]  they can erase any info wars dot com material any prison planet dot com
[38:58.960 --> 39:03.600]  material and so this is just a return to the fairness doctrine of the 60 70s and
[39:03.600 --> 39:06.920]  early 80s that was found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court I mean you
[39:06.920 --> 39:13.440]  couldn't have a real talk show Alex Jones or Rush Limbaugh or Tom Hartman you
[39:13.440 --> 39:19.200]  know a mainline liberal in that paradigm you couldn't have a show with your
[39:19.200 --> 39:23.880]  own editorial views like a newspaper could no you could still own a newspaper
[39:23.880 --> 39:27.760]  and write whatever you want it no and so that's why it was selective enforcement
[39:27.760 --> 39:31.640]  and unconstitutional on so many fronts not just free speech but also it was
[39:31.640 --> 39:37.600]  arbitrary it was selectively enforced it was discriminatory so you had to have
[39:37.600 --> 39:42.000]  both sides they did have talk shows in big cities and I remember listening to
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.080]  them when I was a kid you know driving around listening to WB AP with my dad
[39:45.080 --> 39:49.520]  and they'd say we have the Republican and we have the Democrat on with us notice
[39:49.520 --> 39:53.520]  Cass Sunstein said that too they're gonna limit the paradigm to the Republicans
[39:53.520 --> 39:59.400]  and Democrats to cement that controlled power structure of the one party that
[39:59.400 --> 40:04.520]  simply shares power with each other kind of like Andre the giant and Hulk Hogan
[40:04.520 --> 40:07.840]  who were good friends went out and had dinner together but they at WrestleMania
[40:07.840 --> 40:15.000]  one two and three had big battles in the cage it wasn't real okay so you can
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.680]  have Hulk Hogan and Andre the giant but you can't say hey this whole thing's
[40:18.680 --> 40:22.920]  fake and controlled we want a true populist constitutional movement at the
[40:22.920 --> 40:26.600]  city and county and state level to take our nation back through the Tenth
[40:26.600 --> 40:31.720]  Amendment no you can't have that sorry info wars.com and prison planet.com
[40:31.720 --> 40:38.320]  he said this on WBZ radio on quote internet policy and he's now the
[40:38.320 --> 40:42.600]  regulations are and that's why they're reading from the same sheet of music the
[40:42.600 --> 40:47.000]  FCC and everyone every day they're coming out talking like this and we have
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.760]  all the quotes we read them last week and Watson's doing a big article on it
[40:50.760 --> 40:57.920]  on free speech on the second amendment on just everything this woman is a
[40:57.920 --> 41:04.080]  tyrant but of course she sat at the feet of Cass Sunstein who says it's a
[41:04.080 --> 41:08.840]  conspiracy theory that vitamin D and sunlight are good for you see notice when
[41:08.840 --> 41:14.760]  he gave examples in his white paper what should be banned notice that he gave
[41:14.760 --> 41:17.720]  things that were very broad
[41:20.400 --> 41:25.520]  notice that he used very broad things like if you don't believe in anthropogenic
[41:25.520 --> 41:30.320]  warming we can put a tax on you or ban you or even arrest you he always says it
[41:30.320 --> 41:33.960]  in three parts like and that's the message we're gonna start with the tax
[41:33.960 --> 41:38.960]  and control you and monitor you and create an agency of thought police then
[41:38.960 --> 41:43.320]  we're gonna find you with taxes and then we're going to arrest you see this is
[41:43.320 --> 41:49.520]  how it's phased in this is how liberty dies is in phases so I now want to go to
[41:49.520 --> 41:54.280]  Paul Watson to break this article down because when you dovetail this with
[41:54.280 --> 42:04.840]  Sunstein and Kagan Elena Kagan and all and the bill introduced by John McCain
[42:04.840 --> 42:10.680]  and Lieberman that openly says the Pentagon can arrest any citizens go read
[42:10.680 --> 42:14.160]  the bill but I mean we had a few weeks ago on about the bill if you don't
[42:14.160 --> 42:18.120]  believe me and won't go look it up judge Napolitano former federal judge he said
[42:18.120 --> 42:21.760]  it's worse than that Alex no one knows where you go no one knows why you get
[42:21.760 --> 42:25.760]  arrested for any reason for quote intelligence purposes a citizen can be
[42:25.760 --> 42:29.080]  grabbed secretly stripped by the Pentagon and Justice Department of
[42:29.080 --> 42:33.200]  citizenship and disappear into a black hole I mean that's pole pot that's
[42:33.200 --> 42:38.000]  Mao Zedong that's Hitler that's Stalin that's that's as bad as it gets and
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.360]  these people really mean business they really are criminals it is criminal to
[42:44.360 --> 42:47.560]  be in government and call for these things read the Declaration of
[42:47.560 --> 42:53.280]  Independence read the Bill of Rights read the Constitution this is criminal as
[42:53.280 --> 42:57.160]  private citizens they could call for tyranny and arrest of people for free
[42:57.160 --> 43:03.160]  speech but you can't you can't sit there in a power position if you have a mayor
[43:03.160 --> 43:07.320]  saying we should be able to pass a city law and just arrest you and throw you in
[43:07.320 --> 43:12.240]  a dungeon that's criminal when you have a police chiefs you know saying we ought
[43:12.240 --> 43:15.280]  to get rid of the internet it's bad that's criminal folks they're calling to
[43:15.280 --> 43:20.120]  come and take your property your free speech your website and they're all
[43:20.120 --> 43:24.000]  starting to you know like a bunch of blackbirds in a tree flap their wings
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.840]  and call you know like on a full night when the trees are full of the black
[43:28.840 --> 43:35.160]  birds it's got to be dealt with they are gearing up for this they are they are
[43:35.160 --> 43:39.400]  they are arrogantly pushing it Paul Watson this is shocking shocking
[43:39.400 --> 43:44.280]  article Obama's are once mandatory government propaganda on policy websites
[43:44.280 --> 43:50.960]  break it down for us yeah the key aspect of this is that these statements by
[43:50.960 --> 43:57.040]  Sunstein were made before Obama even got elected just because just like his
[43:57.040 --> 44:03.280]  January 2008 white paper entitled conspiracy theories was written before
[44:03.280 --> 44:09.320]  Obama came into office Sunstein was selected he was selected because of
[44:09.320 --> 44:13.360]  these very views on free speech and now he's trying to implement them I mean
[44:13.360 --> 44:16.960]  that's the big issue here we know they said all this now they're trying it
[44:16.960 --> 44:22.080]  yeah it's not just some not case professor somewhere this is the head of
[44:22.080 --> 44:25.920]  information technology in the white house and his minion is about to be the
[44:25.920 --> 44:29.560]  next Supreme Court justice I mean there's not gonna be any position that's not
[44:29.560 --> 44:35.680]  a former Goldman Sachs person in this country right and something we know what
[44:35.680 --> 44:40.600]  he's a gender is it's not to introduce quote fairness or two sides of the
[44:40.600 --> 44:47.320]  debate which is a complete you know crock within itself we read at length is
[44:47.320 --> 44:54.120]  January 2008 white paper which I printed off and you know and went through it and
[44:54.120 --> 44:59.320]  that's how we were able to get an insight into what he's all about because in
[44:59.320 --> 45:06.400]  that white paper he calls for taxing an outright banning quote conspiracy
[45:06.400 --> 45:11.120]  theories and then when you read into what he defines as conspiracy theories
[45:11.120 --> 45:17.920]  they are beliefs or views that are held by the majority of Americans the view
[45:17.920 --> 45:22.800]  that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone in killing JFK the view that it was a
[45:22.800 --> 45:32.400]  wider conspiracy is one shared by according to a 1998 CBS poll 90% of
[45:32.400 --> 45:37.360]  American people believe that and this is what he describes as an opinion that
[45:37.360 --> 45:43.960]  needs to be taxed or banned he also said that the view that global warming is a
[45:43.960 --> 45:49.560]  deliberate fraud is also similarly something that the government needs to
[45:49.560 --> 45:53.840]  censor when again the majority of Americans the latest poll now show
[45:53.840 --> 45:58.880]  believe that global warming either doesn't exist or if it does that it's
[45:58.880 --> 46:03.560]  natural that's the majority view so they're going directly after free speech
[46:03.560 --> 46:07.840]  it has nothing to do with fairness it has nothing to do with having two sides
[46:07.840 --> 46:14.240]  of the debate something like Kagan is targeting the First Amendment and he
[46:14.240 --> 46:18.680]  wants to censor and have mandatory government propaganda on the internet
[46:18.680 --> 46:25.760]  part of that effort to do so and even if it was on popular speech that is the
[46:25.760 --> 46:31.320]  most protected speech under the First Amendment but the fact that 99% in polls
[46:31.320 --> 46:34.160]  were against the banker bailout he says you shouldn't be able to criticize the
[46:34.160 --> 46:38.840]  central banks behind the scenes most of the feds energy is spent brainwashing
[46:38.840 --> 46:43.320]  police that anybody that wants to audit the Fed is a murdering terrorist the
[46:43.320 --> 46:51.920]  list just goes on and on and on with all of this info and so we know that they're
[46:51.920 --> 46:55.640]  aware of the fact that we're really waking up so they're trying to move in
[46:55.640 --> 47:02.600]  to desperately put handcuffs on free speech to gag free speech but it's not
[47:02.600 --> 47:09.080]  going to work yeah and they're already doing it via these mandatory internet
[47:09.080 --> 47:14.920]  filters in places like university universities cafes trans major
[47:14.920 --> 47:19.440]  international transport hub where you can't even access political websites
[47:19.440 --> 47:25.000]  nevermindprisonplanet.com you can't even get to mildly political liberal
[47:25.000 --> 47:30.440]  websites for example so they're already you know targeting free speech in that
[47:30.440 --> 47:33.760]  way that's right this system of censorship has already been tested out in
[47:33.760 --> 47:37.740]  China New Zealand's testing it out Australia's testing it out
[47:37.740 --> 47:43.000]  Italy's testing it out England is trying to now start to test it out this is
[47:43.000 --> 47:48.720]  now beginning to actually happen and it's all being directed towards licensing
[47:48.720 --> 47:54.280]  to use the internet Microsoft executives have called for it IBM
[47:54.280 --> 48:00.360]  executives have called for it even China rejected individual numbers for
[48:00.360 --> 48:05.680]  bloggers they wanted to give bloggers ID card but it got shot down in China
[48:05.680 --> 48:10.880]  because it was too repressive but this is exactly the system that is now being
[48:10.880 --> 48:15.560]  called for in Britain in America and in the West so they want to give you a
[48:15.560 --> 48:21.080]  license to blog basically and a license to have an opinion because they're scared
[48:21.080 --> 48:26.880]  that that you know establishment information empire is being overturned by
[48:26.880 --> 48:31.640]  individuals and by political bloggers which it is now let's talk about how
[48:31.640 --> 48:35.560]  they plan to implement it we probably need a part to the your story or beef it
[48:35.560 --> 48:39.960]  up a bit because it's so important they've told us how they're gonna do it
[48:39.960 --> 48:44.720]  and it isn't just Alex Jones saying this it's Newsweek it's Mother Jones but
[48:44.720 --> 48:48.320]  Newsweek says it's a good idea it's the New York Times saying it's a good idea
[48:48.320 --> 48:54.840]  the cyber security act makes all IT professionals take a government six
[48:54.840 --> 48:59.480]  month course or semester course five month course and be certified by the
[48:59.480 --> 49:05.400]  government and ISPs are internet service providers and this is just the
[49:05.400 --> 49:09.800]  first round who have more than a hundred customers well I don't know of any ISPs
[49:09.800 --> 49:15.880]  that I mean there's got to be very few maybe a few small towns where the ISP
[49:15.880 --> 49:21.000]  has you know less than a hundred customers so almost all ISPs will then
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.680]  have to put government software and hardware in their chain and this of
[49:26.680 --> 49:30.320]  course is exactly what happened with the Telecommunications Act of 96 making
[49:30.320 --> 49:34.720]  all cell phones being GPS tracking devices audio tracking devices that's
[49:34.720 --> 49:38.680]  now admitted tracking people in real time even when the phone is off by law
[49:38.680 --> 49:43.080]  they're built to those specs by law Europe was also a part of similar
[49:43.080 --> 49:47.560]  legislation and it's the same thing with the EAS alert system previously you
[49:47.560 --> 49:54.680]  had one station in every town and city or region that was rural where the radio
[49:54.680 --> 49:58.920]  stations in an emergency an emergency alert was put out by the by the biggest
[49:58.920 --> 50:05.080]  station in town and by emergency FCC regulations everyone had to tune to that
[50:05.080 --> 50:10.320]  emergency alert if it was a real alert not just a test but in 96 they put in
[50:10.320 --> 50:16.280]  the EAS shortwave controlled literally doomsday system where every radio
[50:16.280 --> 50:22.120]  station at the studio and at the tower as a failsafe the shortwave government
[50:22.120 --> 50:29.160]  system dials in and takes control of radio TV and cable and so this is just
[50:29.160 --> 50:32.680]  an expansion over all communications so they're going to come at it that way
[50:32.680 --> 50:38.560]  and they're going to come at it with the other software taxes and regulations
[50:38.560 --> 50:41.720]  but if they have trouble passing it they've already told us there's going to
[50:41.720 --> 50:45.280]  be big cyber attacks which they're hyping which of course they will launch
[50:45.280 --> 50:50.920]  then crippling some key system nuclear reactors should not be hooked up to the
[50:50.920 --> 50:55.680]  internet and they're not hooked up that's a lie but power grids shouldn't be and
[50:55.680 --> 51:01.840]  they're not what they're saying they are so they're gonna run a false flag on us
[51:02.360 --> 51:08.160]  this is not a drill repeat this is not a drill gun cells are on a staggering
[51:08.160 --> 51:12.240]  pace gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate vicious
[51:12.240 --> 51:16.840]  criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them now a new book

[54:10.040 --> 54:14.560]  I want to underline what I'm about to say I want to highlight it for everyone
[54:14.560 --> 54:18.440]  please listen to me very carefully we've all got to work together on this
[54:18.440 --> 54:25.040]  we've gone the last six years seven years I guess eight years time just flies
[54:25.040 --> 54:29.480]  since I discovered the internet to plan and they had public symposiums in
[54:29.480 --> 54:35.920]  London in Tokyo in Austin Texas every year and it was the big universities the
[54:35.920 --> 54:41.120]  government's meeting the UN and they said in fact they would call it each year
[54:41.120 --> 54:46.600]  the internet is dead and if you google that headline you can find some of the
[54:46.600 --> 54:50.920]  internet to articles and minutes of their meetings these are public I mean
[54:50.920 --> 54:56.480]  anybody can you know buy a ticket to it and go and they openly laid out their
[54:56.480 --> 55:00.200]  plan to take over the internet now we told you how they would do it and people
[55:00.200 --> 55:04.680]  said oh it'll never happen shut up Alex I'm not gonna read your article I'm not
[55:04.680 --> 55:08.120]  gonna read the minutes of internet to meetings and Paul Watson Steve Watson
[55:08.120 --> 55:13.320]  wrote articles about it over and over and over again now we're here and they're
[55:13.320 --> 55:16.760]  openly announcing in the news they want to do it they're putting people into the
[55:16.760 --> 55:20.480]  Supreme Court who openly are calling for it they've got regulations ours in
[55:20.480 --> 55:25.400]  place Europe is passing these laws this is happening okay this is outrageous
[55:25.400 --> 55:30.000]  it's unpopular they've done national polls were over 90% of Americans are
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.360]  against internet censorship they've done national polls were upwards of 70% of
[55:34.360 --> 55:38.200]  Americans trust the internet in alternative news more than mainstream news and
[55:38.200 --> 55:42.520]  that numbers growing they're losing all credibility they are going to try to do
[55:42.520 --> 55:47.280]  this okay this is really happening and we can't live in denial anymore so I'm
[55:47.280 --> 55:51.840]  begging all of the listeners to get these articles that Paul Watson has
[55:51.840 --> 55:57.520]  written on this subject and to send them out to everyone you know okay this is
[55:57.520 --> 56:02.320]  really happening I know it's incredible all right I mean it's one thing to see
[56:02.320 --> 56:05.520]  him talking about it eight years ago it's another thing to see him doing it
[56:05.520 --> 56:09.560]  but they're now moving to do it Paul Watson and closing in the last few
[56:09.560 --> 56:14.240]  minutes of this hour I mean I think that's the number one message is to
[56:14.240 --> 56:18.840]  point out this is really happening yeah it's going on I mean Australia is
[56:18.840 --> 56:25.440]  already introduced their blacklist of censored websites which included things
[56:25.440 --> 56:30.400]  like anti-abortion websites different political websites and the thing the
[56:30.400 --> 56:35.800]  problem with creating blacklist is not just that free speech is censored it's
[56:35.800 --> 56:41.560]  that it completely slows the internet down as a whole if you go to China and
[56:41.560 --> 56:46.960]  you're trying to get onto websites in China everything every URL you type in
[56:46.960 --> 56:51.760]  has to be redirected to a central government blacklist server before
[56:51.760 --> 56:56.200]  you're allowed to visit the website now government websites when they get high
[56:56.200 --> 57:01.160]  traffic routinely crash so if every website that people visit first has to
[57:01.160 --> 57:04.800]  be routed through a government blacklist then it's gonna create
[57:04.800 --> 57:09.040]  infrastructure and server problems for the internet as a whole in fact that's
[57:09.040 --> 57:13.920]  one of the main criticisms of the Australian slash Chinese model by
[57:13.920 --> 57:18.440]  companies is that this is gonna really screw up connectivity and then crash the
[57:18.440 --> 57:23.280]  web on a routine basis exactly so that's gonna affect businesses it's gonna
[57:23.280 --> 57:27.800]  affect everyone not just political website so it's gonna be bad for the
[57:27.800 --> 57:33.200]  economy as well as killing free speech on the internet and I always hear yuppies
[57:33.200 --> 57:37.400]  I was talking to my neighbor the other day and I said you know the stock
[57:37.400 --> 57:40.000]  market's dropped by a thousand points and he said well I'm not in the stock
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.640]  market and I said well neither am I but it's connected to the entire economy and
[57:44.640 --> 57:49.160]  I'm not mad at him it's just that we're automatically programmed to say I don't
[57:49.160 --> 57:52.560]  care I don't have a political website folks do you know why they want to shut
[57:52.560 --> 57:56.160]  down debate they don't want the American people to have a voice so they can rob
[57:56.160 --> 58:00.280]  your pension funds so they can have warrantless blood draws at checkpoints
[58:00.280 --> 58:03.680]  by the way a judge has struck that down we're gonna cover that later I mean don't
[58:03.680 --> 58:08.320]  people know what comes along with street cameras and checkpoints and spies and
[58:08.320 --> 58:14.560]  censorship it's horrible well the ironic thing about some scenes white paper is
[58:14.560 --> 58:20.040]  that he says a large number of conspiracy theories in society indicates
[58:20.040 --> 58:25.360]  that we live in a repressive system which is exactly the case the more
[58:25.360 --> 58:28.920]  repressive the system gets the more people are gonna speak out so what
[58:28.920 --> 58:33.480]  they define as conspiracy theories is merely an opposing viewpoint to
[58:33.480 --> 58:37.240]  establishment propaganda but they want to force us all to listen to

[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:04.200]  controlled by the New World Order and the mainstream media as you know is
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:08.600]  controlled by the New World Order so just just how you read about the news
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:16.840]  about Thailand lots of it are not true and and your organization puts out an
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.920]  article no no sir sir sir first let me just be clear we we link to mainstream

[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.840]  feelings as a Thailand citizen tell us how close to Bangkok you are give us
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.800]  your view of what's really happening okay I'm a real Thai calling from Thailand
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:46.600]  life now the true story is opposite what of them what the mainstream media tells
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:53.600]  you and you say they use slingshots the red shirt protesters use slingshots
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:15:02.000]  yes they have slingshots but they also have M16 guns weapons war weapons and
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:12.080]  grenade launchers you know M79 they the red shirt protesters this is actually
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:18.360]  this is funny you usually the government side is on the wrong but this time the
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:24.160]  Thai government is the legitimate government they are elect elected
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:29.400]  democratically the president prime minister a piece it is a good man but
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:38.440]  the ex-red shirt ex-prime minister called Mr. Taksin Chinawat who is in
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:45.920]  exile and has been a convicted criminal he he went on exile imposed himself on
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:51.960]  exile by himself and he wanted to regain power he's using the red shirt
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:59.360]  protesters to cause violence riot and to pressure the good Thai government well
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.280]  yes I'm aware of some of that backstory but normally even if somebody tried to
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.480]  stir people up they wouldn't get stirred up if they weren't already angry and I
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.320]  remember reading months ago about the the Thai shutting down the airports why are
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:17.960]  the people so upset but that is the the airport group is a different group they
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:23.600]  are the exactly so there's a lot of people mad is when I'm saying why why are
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:30.240]  the people in Thailand so upset okay they are most of them are mercenaries that
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.480]  you see on the pictures the red shirt pictures mercenaries they're paid and
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:42.800]  some are common is okay lots of socialists and lots of of the scum of
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:50.000]  the Thai society I'm 65 years old I'm a retired physician I'm not talking
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  nonsense to you if you believe me it's up to you but I think your these red
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.160]  shirt protesters are violent people they have caused a lot of violence and you
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:08.160]  read that from the article which I just said you put out two days ago the Thai
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:14.320]  military slaughter of red shirt intensified I think the title should be
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:19.800]  changed red shirt change into this tighter okay that the tighter red shirt
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:27.240]  terrorist slaughtered in innocent Thai soldiers well sir sir you're you're on
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:31.400]  air now we didn't screen your call and I do know the globalist do go in and
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:34.800]  finance groups that he stabilized countries to then drive down their
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:38.880]  markets so offshore banks can come in and take over we have the IMF documents
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.640]  about that I just know that you've had a lot of groups protesting a lot of
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:48.080]  anger in Thailand and so I want you to enlighten me I haven't talked a lot about
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.920]  this because I've been trying to read and figure out what's going on and I
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.080]  think there's some truth on both sides but I hear you say you're an intelligent
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:59.920]  retired physician I certainly can't speak Thai you can speak English and so
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:05.200]  don't feel bad calling in and trying to correct me I mean I want the truth and
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.840]  that's why the phones are open and perhaps tomorrow we can open the phones
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:15.520]  up for an hour or two just for Thai callers and get a overall view a diverse
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:20.080]  view from random callers from Thailand because I know we have hundreds of
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.720]  thousands of listeners in every major nation according to the internet Alexa
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.560]  ratings we're very highly rated with our websites in Thailand so we really
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:35.920]  appreciate you choke filling us in on your perspective but any other closing
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:44.760]  comments yes read what insanity says in the reply forum insanity I back him up
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:53.040]  he's not a Thai he's a foreigner but on your on your May 15 article Thai military
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:59.640]  slaughter of Richard intensifies insanity has made good comments he's telling the
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:05.440]  truth he's a foreigner I'm a Thai and I'm backing up every word he says well we
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:09.120]  know our government's trying to get the illegal aliens to revolt here in the
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.560]  United States and then certainly if they revolt the UN it's gonna be saying
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.280]  they're the good guys anybody that tries to stop them as the bad guys and so I
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:20.560]  can see the perspective and I and again I've this won't be the first time I've
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:27.160]  been wrong for about three hours when the NATO backed forces attacked South
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:32.560]  Ossetia and Russia I mean CNN lied so ball-faced and said that Russia had
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.960]  attacked I went on air and said that until I got the facts and then it was
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:40.360]  proven that it was that type of event and then it was really NATO that had done
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:45.600]  it via via the Georgian government it's just that when we put a headline up
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.960]  about the military killing the red shirts that did intensify so that's true
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:54.600]  you know just from the images and I've seen video of the red shirts fighting I
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:59.080]  didn't see any m16s but the media does manipulate so that's a very important

[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:18.200]  that but all I know is people fighting with slingshots those aren't
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.640]  mercenaries there's probably two sides of this we're gonna ferret it out
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:29.440]  Norman in Ohio you're on the air go ahead hi Alex how are you good sir welcome
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:35.440]  well I'd like to make a couple points I heard about the top 25 site idea the
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:40.120]  first time on your show just now and it's immediately struck me that if the
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:46.560]  government puts up a top 25 sites pop-up or banner on top of any website then
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:51.160]  those 25 sites will eventually become the permanent 25 sites and all websites
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:55.140]  will have them on there now it'll create a monopoly absolutely it it will
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:25:02.200]  immediately give them all the power I know it's absolutely despicable the
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:07.560]  previous idea the other alternative idea according to them is to you know give
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:12.120]  up opposing viewpoints and obvious limit of that is going to be two sides of an
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:16.920]  issue are two sides political sides which the government controls both of them
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:21.240]  like they're going to look at a new world order what they're not going to
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:25.320]  say there is no new world order on the opposing viewpoint they're just going
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:28.720]  to disregard it because it doesn't follow within their bureaucratic media
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.800]  outlined viewpoints well of course they're going to go further than what
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:37.640]  they're announcing but what they're announcing is just devastatingly off the
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:42.320]  chart I mean it's absolutely unconstitutional absolutely anti-freedom
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:48.000]  and they can't defeat us in an open market of ideas every day the alternative
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.040]  media gains leaps and bounds and the mainstream media is imploding I mean
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.920]  they are collapsing so they're going to have to move in quickly and that's why
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:01.200]  they're now announcing all this and they're going to launch a fake cyber
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.600]  security attack bottom line and that's even admitted in their own documents as
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:09.240]  a pretext to take it over because they're not going to get away with all
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:14.360]  their other crimes if we have a free open way to communicate I know it's
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:18.280]  absolutely despicable I'd like to make one more point I've been calling you
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.560]  know I've called maybe 20 times to show trying to get on I'd really like to make
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.200]  this point I read a book called and this is a sensitive subject circumcision
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:30.600]  the hidden trauma how an American cultural practice affects
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:36.600]  infants and ultimately us all it's by Ronald Goldman basically in the book he
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:41.240]  correlates positively divorce rates in America rape rates mother son
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.560]  relationship problems emotional trauma prison population etc positively the
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:51.120]  circumcision in America and I never ever hear anything in the news or in the
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:54.800]  alternative news about circumcision in America well many people do see it as a
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:00.640]  form of sexual mutilation and it's something that most Protestants do of
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:05.040]  course picking it up from Jewish religious law and that's not really an
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:11.480]  issue I've gotten into a lot but I appreciate your call Norman let's talk
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:17.960]  to Grady in Alaska you're on the air you're doing good sir oh and I just
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:21.920]  want to know that I support your show and I'm one of those thousands of people
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:27.440]  that have decided to turn to alternative media because I've come to be
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:32.240]  disillusioned with the mainstream news because there's too much either it's one
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:37.520]  sided on how they report certain issues or they they or they don't cover it or
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.880]  they don't cover it or it's fluff yeah that's all it's about to say to you
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.880]  anyway Alex the main issues I want to talk to you about was about the Supreme
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:50.840]  Court justice that the new nominee Kagan I just hope that she is not put on the
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:55.040]  Supreme Court for the views that you mentioned as far as the first and second
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.680]  amendments because that would be devastating and I don't want because
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:03.280]  already the court is tilting towards it are certain way as far as restricting
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:08.640]  rights I think and I don't want another person on there to make a critical
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:12.560]  vote on a certain issue I mean that would just really cut further into our
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:16.800]  Constitution as it's already being attacked yeah Stevens Stevens had some
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:22.560]  problems he had some problems but he is a Thomas Jefferson compared to Elena
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:28.400]  Kagan I mean this woman this woman could only be on a Nazi or Soviet court I
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:35.920]  mean literally she is a dictator wannabe she is a thug and it just shows how far
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:39.960]  we've gone that that she's almost unopposed right now we've got to get
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:43.400]  this out on talk radio we've got to get this out in the newspapers letters to
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:47.840]  the editor we've got to call the Senate we've got to call the Senate Judiciary
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:56.600]  Committee we have got to raise Kane over this issue as you were talking as the
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:00.320]  last call was talking about the as you were speaking about a possible cyber
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:04.560]  attack on the internet and the for to be caused to have a second internet or
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:08.640]  internet to another thing that I'm concerned about is that in addition to
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:14.120]  doing that someone can actually with the media they can say that Iran did it and
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:17.680]  that will there'll be another reason to demonize Iran well they're already
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:20.360]  framing the Chinese they're already framing the Chinese they're saying
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.840]  they're going to do it and Google's had to merge with the NSA they were always
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:28.280]  NSA and but yeah they could say Iran as well but it but right now they're
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:35.360]  pre-framing China for this as if China's involved in it the US companies help
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:42.160]  China build its censorship grid great points Brady John Tim Tom and others
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:46.280]  you're called straight ahead you want to call in from Thailand or Bangkok 800 to

[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:19.080]  encouraged by Colonel Six yesterday it was the happiest thing I've heard in a
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:25.000]  long time then also the any military people on bases at C4 and troops need
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.080]  to go up and counter the engaged them and let them know that they need to go
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.920]  home and to tell their commanders that they want to go home and there's no need
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:37.400]  to be here and it's only going to be dangerous for them and if we need to do

[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:26.600]  awake to what's happening and that's the other thing is have military people
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:30.840]  call their local sheriff at home and say hey sheriff this is what's going on
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:35.280]  here and you're the law of the land and we want to work with you to save this
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.320]  country that we're never letting foreign troops in here we're never letting you
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:44.560]  want troops in here and by the way I wanted to tell you back in 1993 yes
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:49.600]  93 I was in the U.I. National Forest at Robin's sage where you know where they
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:53.840]  do the special forces training and we were the opt for them and we were
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:36:00.680]  searching civilian vehicles on civilian land and we were told there were players
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:05.000]  they may look like civilians but there they could have weapons or bombs and we
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.640]  need to search them and this is all part of a drill I'll tell you right now the
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:13.560]  people we were searching they weren't they were civilians and we all knew I've
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:19.280]  been to the urban warfare drills in California and Florida other areas they
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:25.080]  pull over real people who don't know and this is a huge secret program to
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:29.320]  desensitize the police the military and the general population the civilians
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:35.000]  and now it's coming to a head but I mean look at Obama's people openly saying
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.760]  they want to restrict free speech in America have the military secretly
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:44.560]  arrest citizens and pull their citizenship and all the secret documents
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:48.720]  that we've gotten that have made national news show that the real target is
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:53.760]  the American people that the military is being trained in mass as well as
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:57.920]  Homeland Brigade to take on the American people I mean that's the wake-up call
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:02.360]  the government saying there's no world government the banks aren't robbing you
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:06.880]  and these cooks say the government wants their guns so let's go do gun
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:11.560]  confiscation drills I mean look at the disconnect right there that's what's
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:14.640]  waking the troops up it is that mind control it's like the government saying
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:19.640]  we don't bring drugs in but we do grow the opium and help ship it out I mean
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:25.600]  how bold are these people to think that they can have Fox News announced the
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:29.840]  government's growing opium the troops have to protect it in Afghanistan but
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:35.080]  it's a good thing I mean it's just it's it's mind control yeah it is I would
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.560]  typically one other thing too I have a friend who's a senior non-commissioned
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.760]  officer who I talked to about a month and a half ago and I said what are you
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:46.040]  doing right now and he said well I'm down in Mississippi and we're looking at
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:49.760]  infrastructure I said what on Dodge Green Earth would you be doing looking at
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.240]  infrastructure as an infantry officer down in Mississippi so that was that was
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:58.320]  highly suspect and what it is I think if a lot of these military people was like
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.840]  what's his name brought up about the Manhattan Project a lot of people are
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:06.000]  working on things but they don't exactly know what they're doing well that's it
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.960]  and they call it infrastructure protection the clergy response teams
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:16.520]  in regard all these citizens spy groups are under that and in the first few
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:20.320]  meetings this has been declassified they've been put it on the news they
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:24.280]  tell them okay here's coughing and donuts here's what Al Qaeda looks like you
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:27.560]  know if you see anybody you know doing this call the police and the next
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:31.560]  meeting is watch your neighbors what are they saying do they have guns do they
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:36.000]  have marijuana are they spanking their kids you've got to go tell your flocks
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.840]  to submit the gun confiscation so there's been this huge covert propaganda
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:43.760]  just like they've had Marines run checkpoints all over the country to
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:47.320]  quote stop drunk drivers again it's meant to sound like well you're against
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:51.240]  drunk drivers aren't you it's meant to set that precedent then by the fourth or
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.640]  fifth drill they're doing gun confiscation operations and that's even
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:59.560]  been in mainstream news so this is how they're trying to do a mind warp on the
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:04.960]  troops but the good news is the troops clearly are waking up ahead of the stage
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:08.720]  terror attack and so if the globalists go ahead with the stage terror attack
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:13.240]  it's not going to go well with them God bless you I appreciate your call John
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:20.040]  Jim in California you're on the air Alex hey buddy how you doing today good go
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:24.320]  ahead okay I'm a day trader and you wanted to know where the market's going
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:28.240]  up and doing this for three years I used to work for PPG and I've worked for big
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:33.320]  coding companies in the past my real trade is a corrosion engineer but this
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:39.120]  market is going directly down make peak it's had up here and there but it's
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:46.600]  already lost close to 800 points in the last couple weeks what do you think well
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:53.760]  what they do is they bring the US down 19 months ago then they bring the Euro
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:58.200]  up then they bring the Euro down then they'll bring us down but they stagger
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:03.400]  it where where Europe goes down we go up then Europe goes up we go down but if
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:08.480]  you look at the graph they're really going down in concert together they're
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:13.880]  just staggering it and that way the big brokerage firms that have the insider
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:17.360]  knowledge in the black boxes and the plunge protection team at the federal
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:20.960]  government working for them they basically have rigged the market to a
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:25.480]  mass wealth and power while getting nation states in deeper debt to them and
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:33.080]  I agree I mean the market is even last week with ten years ago now with the
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:39.240]  drop today it's below what it was ten years ago so overall the market is flat
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:44.200]  but when you add an inflation and debt the market is way down right and if you
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:47.880]  don't have gold and silver and if you don't take your money out of the bank
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:51.320]  soon you're gonna be a sorry customer I'm telling you that right now
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:55.720]  everybody needs you know Alex if everybody went to their bank and took
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:02.800]  out their money what would happen there would be a collapse of the big central
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:08.920]  banks and then the people would take control we need to get control back
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:13.200]  away from these banks why doesn't everybody go into the banks withdraw
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:17.960]  their money buy gold and silver wrap hold a little cash and start trading a
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:21.840]  month's ourselves and forget these big banks it's all this whole market is
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:26.160]  focused focus it's going directly into Haiti's and I'm telling you the general
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:30.920]  pump doesn't have a clue they think they're 401ks have come back they think
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:34.680]  this is not the other thing is getting better because mainstream media tells
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:38.920]  them that way they're in Laila then they don't the general look at Europe
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:44.240]  Europe is on the verge of cut total collapse and it won't fully collapse
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:48.360]  it'll just collapse into the bankers hands even more and it'll just be an
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:52.600]  incremental collapse they're going to do this slowly that's what all the
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:59.880]  evidence shows or they could just in completely imploded and then they're
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:04.440]  so so-called life raft or life buoy that that they'll throw us will be total
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:09.160]  banking dictatorship with even more power and control but I agree with you a
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:14.520]  year is a twinkling of the eye and so in the aggregate in the sum total markets
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:18.320]  are going straight down it may go up for a while down for a while up for a while
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:23.760]  down for a while but overall it's all going straight down and governments are
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:28.320]  openly saying we're coming for your pension funds and private corporations
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:32.880]  are already devaluing or looting the pension funds government is talking
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:37.240]  about taking part or all the pension funds companies are creating spin-offs
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:42.000]  and shutting down the old division to not pay pension funds they're engaged in
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.200]  every form of criminal chicanery known to man I appreciate your call Jim Tom in
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:53.000]  Connecticut you're on the air Tom just hung up let's talk to Kip in Georgia
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:07.840]  Kip you're on the air yeah I'm gonna have to let you go your phones having a
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:11.840]  big problem you can get back in on a good phone line we'll have you on again
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:15.760]  we can only take phones that we can actually understand in here if we can
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:19.880]  understand you we're not able to have you on air let's go ahead and talk to Amy
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:27.200]  in Ohio Amy you're on the air hi Alex hi I just found out about you through a
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:32.960]  lot of different things from the 9-11 the conspiracy different things and you
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:38.360]  know you're talking about the one world government and I don't think I guess some
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:43.880]  people are blind to it the one world government happened right back in 2009
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:49.000]  they give a time that when it happened when it was established it's just like
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.760]  you said it's been going on with the Bilderbergs all these different people
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:58.040]  and I like what your last guy just said what would happen if we as Americans
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:03.920]  just went got our money out of the base what would happen because from some of
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:08.880]  the information I found out they're trying to actually take it down to like
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:16.080]  eight banks in the world to where the one world government controls everything
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:22.560]  well it'd be kind of like if a if your leg was sticking out a door and a lion
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:29.760]  grabbed it would you hack off your leg because the lion had a hold of it and if
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:34.400]  you didn't hack off your leg the lion would get your whole body and it is the
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:39.720]  avoidance of crisis the avoidance of a fight it is the avoidance of a struggle
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:45.040]  and the fact that people keep you know wanting to just passively resist this
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:50.200]  that has allowed them to get us to this point and the lion will eat us one piece
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:54.480]  at a time unless we get our leg out of their mouth now instead of having a
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:45:00.680]  hatchet to hack off our own leg I would rather politically again there's a hole
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.120]  in the wall our legs sticking out a lion's got a hold of it trying to pull
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:10.440]  us to the wall I would rather politically have a 357 magnum and shoot
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:13.760]  the lion right between the eyes and I don't mean that in a violent way I mean
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:17.880]  politically have grand juries start indicting these big banks like Iceland's
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:21.480]  doing like Greece is now starting to talk about doing like Merkel's being
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:26.240]  forced to talk about doing because in between her losing political power and
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:32.040]  maybe even going to jail the rats are now starting to jump from the sinking
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:36.800]  ship and so why not just nationalize the big eight banks who are using
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:41.880]  government to nationalize us and take all our wealth and give it to them that's
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:46.200]  why they're nationalizing the car industry health care everything so they
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:50.880]  can control it so it's offshore big banks that are controlling society through
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:56.640]  government so skip the government and use the state government to and grand
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:01.280]  juries to to go after these bankers and we can do that by discrediting them by
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:06.600]  pointing out their bunch of made-off slash can lay type crooks and by
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:12.240]  pointing out that they are going to incrementally drain us if we don't stand
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:15.840]  up against them so I don't know if hacking our leg off to get away from the
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:20.120]  lion is the way to go I mean I think it is good to pull our money out of mega
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:24.920]  banks put it in local banks I've been doing that the last few weeks you know
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:29.440]  from even regional banks to local banks there's a lot of things that need to be
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:35.120]  done so so yes the problem is if you're running a medium-sized business like I
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:39.000]  am with 20 something employees you got to have quite a lot of money just in
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.440]  there just to run things and you know I try to be a good steward and have five
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:50.200]  six months of backup money to run things so we're not running on empty here but
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:55.160]  I have taken any extra money that we have as much as we can out of the
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:59.720]  emergency backup fund and and put it into a local bank but I think it's a
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:04.920]  good idea anything else I just was going to say to that one of the leading
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:10.280]  economists of the world spent on a lot of different different shows not like
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:14.760]  Fox News because I mean you've opened my eyes to a lot of things when you really
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:20.200]  do listen there's an agenda behind all the media that's on TV that's why I
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:26.200]  have pretty much quit watching it a guy you say Larry Bates is his name he's a
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:33.120]  world economist he said we've he had a good friend that tried to even audit the
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:39.120]  Federal Reserve which we know is not a bank and they just laughed like you know
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:48.520]  who cares Amy I appreciate I appreciate your call Ron Paul has been trying to
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:52.360]  audit the Fed and it got up to the Senate and they created a new bill and
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:59.240]  stripped his bill and it was a betrayal by Bernie Sanders and it was a betrayal
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:04.760]  by Grayson when he came out and said we've beaten the Fed well they're
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:12.760]  still there and it's not a real audit so but again we've gone from no co-sponsors
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:19.920]  25 years ago for Ron Paul's legislation to it passing the house so look at how
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:26.560]  much ground we've gained when you first don't succeed try try again John and
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:30.960]  Illinois you're on the air thanks for holding a long time listener first time
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:34.680]  call I'm a member of all we are change Chicago a member of young Americans for
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:38.280]  Liberty campaign for Liberty I'm a freedom fighter I'm a Liberty lover
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:42.580]  and when I see in the front through freedom of speech our most basic
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:48.280]  inalienable right with this Keegan I mean this disgust me as a patriot as a
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:52.960]  sovereign American how can somebody who has no judicial experience who is a
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:59.200]  golden sex member and who has written papers about just getting rid of a
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:04.240]  freedom of speech I mean she might call it disappearance to me that unconstitutional
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:08.760]  in every way well it's not just that quote the mainstream media picked up her
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:13.240]  more mild quotes she I mean there's literally dozens of them Paul Watson's
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:17.400]  doing an article right now on that for prisonplanet.com and her boss
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:23.160]  Cass Sunstein is in white papers and at the White House and in speeches and on
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:29.000]  talk radio saying they are going to ban our free speech what right do they have
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.480]  to tell us what we can and can't say well they have to they're setting up
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:38.640]  well they already set it up they're expanding their banking dictatorship
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:43.920]  it's totally illegal and this is just the cherry on top there is no more room
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:51.560]  for anyone to deny that we have a pack of looting crooks running our society and
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:57.400]  we better reach out to the military and police right now and shake them out of
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:00.640]  the mind control they're under a lot of them have already woken up but I mean
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:06.580]  come on this is the bad guys we're looking at the bad guys at the federal
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:10.640]  level and they're destroying all of our futures together we're all in this
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:13.920]  together even if you think you're part of the New World Order at some mid-level
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:18.480]  you are not part of it okay you are going to be trashed by this you may do
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:22.400]  good for another year or two under their system okay but as tyrannies come in
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:26.680]  they always call the group that brought them to power they will at least fire
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:31.760]  you you're like an IBM engineer who is forced to train his replacements for
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:36.360]  six months then being fired and even being told he's going to be fired after
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:40.760]  he trains them you know why I know a bunch of people here in Austin if it
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:45.800]  company after company factory after factory IBM Dell you name it and they
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:49.480]  even tell them you're gonna take a cut and pay by half and then when you've
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:53.000]  trained these people you're fired and instead of all the engineers and people
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.560]  getting together and saying no they go along with it okay you gotta get your
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:01.880]  fighting spirit folks or they're gonna take everything you've got hi this is

[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:30.040]  give it five-star rating it had a five-star rating then I even saw a
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:33.640]  website just happened to run into it saying go here download it and rate it
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:38.080]  down because very few apps have five stars only has four now you know 40
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:42.480]  something thousand download it only a couple thousand rated and the enemies
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:47.560]  pulled it down to four stars get in there download it email the link to your

[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:18.480]  people anywhere Germany the Netherlands South Africa Brazil Mexico Canada it

[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:53.440]  did some math spent about an hour on YouTube just randomly with a calculator
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:59.440]  going to our eight YouTube channels to my films online just on YouTube I have to
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:09.300]  make a correction 200 million of my videos watched to hundred million in an
[01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:13.980]  hour I got a one of my channels 45 million views go to another one of my
[01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:18.660]  channels 15 million views go to another one of my channels 5 million views go

[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:35.960]  millions of views and I sat there with a calculator up to 200 million 200 million
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:43.360]  of my videos watched 200 million on one platform now that's the power of you
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:48.640]  taking action it's incredible believe me ladies and gentlemen the globalists hate

[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:04.600]  Randy is calling in saying he works with the US military in Germany and he was
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:07.360]  saying they're really waking up we're here in the military calling in mass
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:11.200]  talk about how they're listening to my show all over the bases now we've got
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:15.040]  troops coming out and going public up at info wars.com with oathkeepers about
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:19.320]  how there was a revolt in Katrina refusing to confiscate guns tyranny
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:23.080]  comes to your door in a uniform and if you can educate the people in uniform
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:26.720]  the globalists won't be able to carry this out and I've seen major news
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:31.960]  reports about how the NSA is mainly watching troops and FBI now not just
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:37.040]  citizens like myself because they know there's a huge awakening described for
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:41.480]  us Randy the type of awakening going on over in Germany in the military in the
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:45.240]  government people over there and other key points you you said you wish you had
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:49.120]  time to cover well there's a lot of different things for example I mean I
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:53.880]  have bumper stickers you know in the Fed I support Ron Paul bumper stickers things
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:58.000]  like that and a lot of people you'll come up after what does that mean in the Fed
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:02.600]  and it blows my mind it really does these are you know major's colonels
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:07.880]  lieutenant colonel stuff have no idea and I explain it to them and I tell them
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:12.960]  like go to your websites go to these in the Fed websites check out Ron Paul's
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:17.240]  websites read these books read these tapes and they'll wake up like I had no
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:23.320]  idea I had no idea and by the way I hope they don't try to persecute you and
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:27.080]  others that are spreading the word because in national polls over 80% of
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:32.200]  Americans want to audit or abolish the Fed it was 75% just three months ago and
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:36.800]  so you're with the American people it's your right to be for the auditing this
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:41.880]  private secretive bank that's been robbing us that's right and you know
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:45.320]  you get on the economy and stuff because I live in Germany so I'm kind of you know
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:48.960]  involved in the economy stuff over here I don't know where all this bell that
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:51.720]  money's gonna come from that they're helping grease everything else out a
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:56.600]  lot of people you know in America you know we fight taxes and everything else
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:03:03.720]  for good reason because over here your your sales tax for example is 19% on
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:10.160]  everything you buy the tax your TV the beef you give you a church tax if you go
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:15.120]  down to stay in certain hotels stuff it around the Alps that the tax the air the
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:21.600]  water the tax everything these folks are taxed to death and and now the Germans
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:25.120]  have been told by the way the US is paying for part of it that they've got
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:30.280]  to give up more their pension funds the Greeks have been told this and so the
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:32.960]  trillions are gonna come out of your pocket that's why they're going to
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:38.320]  unify the tax rates globally by raising them that's what the new world order is
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:44.480]  it's a global corporate model where private central banks control the planet
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:48.880]  and set global taxes so there's nowhere to run and that's why the New York
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:53.360]  Times admits record numbers of wealthy Americans are leaving the country
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:57.920]  because this is their last chance to get out with their money there's only six
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:03.120]  months left or so and then you're not getting out with five cents and so but
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:07.800]  so they run to Costa Rica so they run to the Cook Islands they're gonna mop them
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:12.360]  up next we shouldn't be running we should be standing and speaking up and
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:16.200]  identifying this global corporate structure anything else stand up like

[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:37.440]  justice not your corner bank but the Goldman Sachs crooks that are about to

[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:46.440]  Amendment that is a declaration of war against this republic when somebody

[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.440]  segment lay out where we are what's happening what's going on in europe
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:45.320]  what's going on with brown stepping down merkel and in trouble saying the banks
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:49.000]  are criminal what's happening in the markets a trillion's not enough they
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.760]  need more what is happening right now all righty well let's talk first about
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:10:00.760]  greece now george papandreo the leader in greece he made a statement yesterday
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:05.480]  over the weekend that he's now going to investigate what role the wall street
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:11.600]  banks played in destabilizing his country his economy and this is through
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:17.600]  some back channel communication between myself and folks in greece and I've been
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:21.080]  trying to steer them in the right direction telling them this isn't a
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:25.200]  market problem it's not a market failure but it's fraud that's been perpetrated
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:30.760]  primarily by wall street banks and my message got through and he said yesterday
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:36.120]  that he hears words like a need for transparency and there's fraud and now
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:41.560]  he's going to take a stand against the bankers now historically when anybody
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:45.280]  has taken anyone in politics has taken a stand against the bankers they immediately
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:49.440]  put themselves into him you know quite a bit of danger because the track record
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:52.920]  if you go you know even if you read john perkins book at confessions of an
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:57.160]  economic hitman whatever somebody a leader of a country steps up against the
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:00.720]  bankers they put themselves into grave danger now this would be the first time
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:05.760]  really that a major western economy is taking on the wall street banks but the
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:10.280]  people in greece are out in the streets and the leadership is responding so
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:13.480]  they're he's making a statement so we're going to see because there's ample
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:18.720]  proof that the wall street banks purposefully crash the greece economy
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:24.080]  the greek economy for short-term capital gains so that that's that's the
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:27.760]  first thing that's happening what's happening in the iceland you know we made
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:31.800]  a film in iceland about the collapse of the corona the collapse of the iceland
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:35.320]  economy and I've gotten pretty friendly with a lot of the legislators up in
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:42.160]  iceland I'm proposing to them that they introduce some new economic citizenship
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:46.880]  so that anyone in the world who wants to escape for example a u.s. citizen who
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:52.280]  wants to escape the tyranny of the u.s. can buy a passport for iceland and to
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:55.960]  make it competitive so it only cost twenty thousand bucks right now there's
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:59.760]  only two territories or countries that offer economic citizenship never
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:06.120]  same kids and dominica they're both in the in the Bahamas they cost two hundred
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:09.800]  thousand and seventy five thousand dollars respectively respectively I'm
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:13.480]  saying that iceland to be competitive they can offer economic citizenship for
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:18.480]  twenty thousand dollars and they could get if they get two hundred thousand or
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:23.720]  so or half a million citizens from the u.s. to renounce u.s. citizenship and
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:28.040]  iceland they could raise ten billion dollars immediately to help recapitalize
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.760]  their country and they are talking about entry to rewriting their
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:37.280]  constitution in ways that are going to favor free speech and freedom of the
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:40.920]  press on the stop you interested in freedom of the press would immediately
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:46.240]  want to emigrate to iceland max these pockets of resistance and pockets of
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:50.680]  strength from the work that you're doing directly and the work I've been
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:54.880]  doing and now these people are starting to respond to the global insurrection
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:59.320]  against the banking occupation is on okay the global insurrection is on i
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:03.280]  want to interject this and get your take on it and i want to back you up here
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:09.280]  and have you continue this is french news agency bankers jailed sued as iceland
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:13.800]  seeks culprits for crisis then a week ago we saw the merkel headline where she
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:18.520]  called you know it criminal banks causing this though she's bought and paid
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:23.400]  for by them so isn't that the danger with the greek leader and others is that
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:28.080]  they see the headlights of the train coming the global insurrection against
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:32.920]  the banking cartel they know they can't survive unless they put into a process
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:37.120]  and then maybe goldman sacks or jp morgan will flush down the toilet some
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:43.080]  mid-level trader you know on a sub issue like timber wolf with goldman sacks i
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:46.160]  mean isn't there a danger of that because i've been all over a greek radio and
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:50.720]  newspapers as well saying arrest the bankers you know arrest goldman sacks
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:53.560]  and so you've been putting the pressure on many others have been putting the
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:14:00.040]  pressure on shows that's a great idea secondarily how you brought up expatriates
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:03.720]  we have the new york time saying record numbers of wealthy people who aren't
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:07.560]  globalist leaving because they say this is the last year to get your money out
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.960]  just fleeing in mass i'd rather flee to somewhere like iceland but i don't even
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:14.040]  have enough money i don't think like you said if it was two hundred thousand
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:16.800]  dollars i think i'm gonna stay and go down with the ship but for people that
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:20.760]  do want to escape and be about to be around like-minded people but what
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:25.960]  about the arrest that they're reporting in iceland that's right they're one of
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:31.960]  the bankers in london who they they say and mightfully so was responsible for
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:38.760]  a pill for a two billion dollars from the economy is now being prosecuted and
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:44.200]  you know funny because london is where a lot of these guys go to get because the
[02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:47.640]  the hedge fund industry and the banking industry laws are very lenient there and
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:50.200]  you end up with a lot of the international banking crooks end up in
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:53.560]  london which is one of the reasons why the real estate market in london and on
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:55.400]  the high end the very expensive
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:59.920]  uh... residencies hasn't crashed so much because they're supported by all these
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:03.240]  billionaires from these territories that they've
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:09.000]  upsconded with all the wealth so iceland is actively going after uh... this guy and
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:13.800]  it's funny because in the indictment they use a very interesting word alex they
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:19.400]  use the word counterfeiting now this is fascinating because counterfeiting in
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:24.600]  the context of financial crime and financial terrorism it points to what's
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:31.400]  what's what people know as naked short selling naked short selling is
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:35.240]  is really one of the most common incendiary financial devices used to
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:39.560]  blow up an economy and to blow up a country to blow up a company we saw
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:42.840]  the Lehman brothers and Bear Stearns naked short selling you're selling
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:46.440]  something you're selling a security that doesn't exist
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:49.960]  which is the same as counterfeiting so now if they bring this whole naked
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:53.400]  short selling scam to the surface and they call it what it is counterfeiting
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:57.560]  that that would point the finger at a lot of the criminality that's going on in
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:16:01.320]  the last five to ten years and really bring bring in all the banks because
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:04.440]  they're all guilty of this naked short selling to a huge degree
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:07.720]  now getting back to your question about well the leaders
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:12.040]  once they take on wall street are they going to be pressured to back down
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:15.640]  and what we saw last thursday on may six
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:19.240]  was the first unequivocal domestic financial terrorist attack in america
[02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:23.080]  you know there was a bill in washington to break up the big banks
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:28.040]  they dropped the market by a thousand points the lawmakers pulled away they
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:31.640]  decided not to pass the law to break up the big they also dropped the real
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:34.760]  audit the fed and put a fake one in according to ron poll
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:39.080]  yeah so they've got this weapon which is they can crash a market
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:44.680]  and i'm looking at today's news and you see now that the financial terrorists
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:49.800]  are not shy about threatening to blow up people's economies and markets for
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:54.040]  example is in today's news morgan stanley said that
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:58.680]  um if europe doesn't engage in in full-blown quantitative easing
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:02.760]  which means that they would buy back their own their own bonds which basically
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:06.840]  would mean to destroy the europe then morgan stanley
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:12.840]  threatens europe with a 1987 crash look this up morgan stanley full-blown
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:17.400]  quantitative easing may be needed to save europe or else we'll see a 1987 style
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:21.960]  crash so they're threatening europe with a 1987 that's morgan stanley a
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:26.200]  long street bank isn't it's threatening the entire euro zone
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:33.400]  um here's another headline about uh the kpmg and price warhouse cooper
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:37.400]  are now considering whether or not they should get back into the into the
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:42.040]  business of the rating agency you know the moody's s and p and fit those rating
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:45.560]  agencies that gave their blessing to all the structured products and
[02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:48.120]  collateralized debt obligations that turn out to be phony
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:51.560]  well now all these consulting firms who are also equally
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:55.400]  uh culpable in this nightmare to collapse of the economy
[02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:58.600]  to say well you know those guys aren't good enough at it we're going to get into
[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:04.120]  the business so this is like uh really just um exactly the same thing the fact
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:07.160]  that they can with a straight face say that they're going to get into the
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:10.760]  rating agency business when they themselves are some of the most crooked
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:13.480]  organizations in the u.s economy kpmg and price
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:17.800]  waterhouse is is quite laughable uh here you have general motors
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:21.560]  today saying that they want to get back into the financing business
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:25.720]  because of the shortage of subprime lending is holding back sales
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:29.720]  now general motors getting into the financing business is exactly how the
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:32.920]  economy crashed to begin with because they got out of selling cars and they
[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:36.280]  got into the loan sharking business then the economy crashed then the
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:40.840]  government gave them billions and as a as a thank you to the taxpayer for
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:43.640]  getting them out of the hole they're saying now we want to get back to the
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:47.560]  land sharking business that only took 12 months now we're not going to build
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:50.680]  cars we're going to move our factories to asia
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:54.920]  to brazil and to china uh and to uh eastern europe
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:57.960]  and then all we're going to do with your bailout money here is loan it back to
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:01.800]  you the american people that user is right as a loan shark
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:05.160]  and we're trying to get you deeper into debt as we possibly can
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:09.560]  and so they're trying to restart cycle restart the entire
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:14.600]  cycle of again until they blow up and then they'll require more of a bailout
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:17.640]  and of course this just perpetuates this move
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:20.840]  down into what we would call the casino gulag state
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:26.920]  where the value of the purchasing power the wages and the savings
[02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:30.600]  and the purchasing power of everybody in the u.s keeps continuously
[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:34.920]  the degrades and drops and disintegrates and you have this just an enormous
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:41.880]  excess pool uh they use the word where wants a fine country used to uh reside
[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:46.120]  well said i've got a bunch of questions for you in the next short segment and
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:48.920]  we're going to get into other issues you think are important to cover and then
[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:53.880]  take phone calls one of my questions is will the u.s market collapse
[02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:57.560]  when will it collapse if it does and how will it collapse that's all coming up
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:01.720]  with max keiser i'm alex jones in full wars dot com
[02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:05.240]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:09.400]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:13.080]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:16.360]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:19.240]  it's true total government control of electricity
[02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:22.760]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:26.360]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:30.280]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:33.800]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:36.920]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:30.760]  this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:34.040]  to our elected government but has also caused the dollar to lose more than
[02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:37.640]  90 cents of its original value now foreign governments are trying to

[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:15.800]  segment max i talked to one of my neighbors i talked to
[02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:19.480]  other people you know that are somewhat successful in business in austin
[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:22.440]  and they say well i'm not in the stock market so i don't care what these big
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:26.760]  banks are doing and i don't understand this yuppie
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:33.080]  pre-programmed arrogance where you try to warn people that you know
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:37.800]  and they act like it's weak to even care or even be involved in society as long
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:42.120]  as they think they're doing okay i mean everyone is
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:44.920]  connecting to the stock market everyone is connected to the currencies
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:48.840]  everyone is connected through taxes with these trillions of dollars of
[02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:54.200]  quote bailouts used for bonuses i mean what do you call that mindset
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:58.120]  where people don't understand the incredible magnitude
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:02.840]  of what's happening in global markets right now and where this is leading us
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:06.360]  well you can explain it in the following way
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:11.240]  the the average experience of of the average american
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:16.040]  is masked to a large degree by the fact that most people
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:19.240]  in america are unaware of the benefits accrued
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:25.240]  to them because the world reserve currency is the us dollar so there is no
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:29.480]  radical currency risk that you see in other countries and the currency
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:33.400]  collapses that you see in other countries and it also means that
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:37.960]  things like gasoline are incredibly cheap in america relative to other
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:42.280]  countries now what is going to happen what people on your show are talking
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:46.600]  about and what i've been talking about what i see over here in europe
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:51.000]  is that the u.s dollar as reserve currency is going to be replaced with a
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:55.880]  new global currency and that at that moment then americans will
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:59.640]  experience what everyone else in the world experiences which is
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:04.920]  radical currency risk and uh... all kinds of
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:10.680]  bank shenanigans including paying state local federal
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:15.240]  and world tax because of course they will world currency you need a global
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:18.440]  central bank who's going to charge a global tax
[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:21.400]  and then americans will wake up and they'll say oh my god
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:24.440]  you know it all happened it's happening right now because the special drawing
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:28.360]  rights that are on the that are being used right now as part of this huge
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:32.200]  reconfiguration of the european banking system and the trillion dollar
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:39.400]  that the u.s gave europe to unwind their banks risky positions part of that is
[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:43.480]  the introduction of another 300 billion in special drawing rights so the special
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:47.080]  drawing rights are creeping into the global
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:50.600]  currency system at some point they will
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:55.640]  be comparable to other major currencies in terms of the amount traded
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:00.120]  and the scope and the influence and then you'll start to see things quoted in
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:03.480]  special drawing rights and they'll normalize the special drawing right
[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:06.840]  and then it'll be announced that as part of brenton woods
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:10.520]  too uh... they're going to reconfigure the global currency grid
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:13.640]  the u.s dollar will be devalued by fifty percent
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:18.040]  like it was in the thirties gold will be upwardly value to five or ten thousand
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:21.640]  dollars an ounce and then people in the u.s will
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:25.640]  will will have a deferred awakening because since world war two
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:29.880]  they've really had the benefit of that they've had the world war two
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:33.880]  dividend which is stretched out for sixty sixty and they just expect
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:39.640]  incredible period of benefit that the as a result of having this
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:43.160]  incredible system where their government the u.s government can write checks
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:46.680]  that they never have to cash because every time if they the check is due
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:50.280]  they just write another check and since the world runs on dollars there's always
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:53.000]  somebody willing to take a bad american check
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.840]  now as soon as that situation ends as it is happening right now
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:00.280]  you'll have this incredible you know shock
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:05.160]  uh... and and then it'll be way way way too late to do anything about it so
[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:08.200]  i can understand why people are in a coma
[02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:12.520]  when it comes to understanding the position of the u.s relatives of the
[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:15.880]  rest of the world and i can also anticipate that when this
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:20.200]  thing finally makes the break there's going to be an incredible
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:24.920]  uh... gasp of horror that'll just go from coast to coast they will be
[02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:29.560]  absolute shock how did this happen but uh... it's
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:32.440]  happening for all the reasons you've been talking about for the last ten years
[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:35.640]  and the banks will say the big mega banks will say don't worry we're going to
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:40.040]  save you again with s dr's we're transcending
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:43.640]  national currencies and we'll just make up to the power of infinity
[02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:47.000]  whatever amount of fiat money we want and you're going to pay us
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:50.840]  taxes on the right to use this new global
[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:54.360]  cashless society system and they'll just bypass
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:57.800]  the three global regional currencies that the trilateral commission
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:01.960]  talked about in the nineteen seventies correct
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:05.320]  that is basically correct in other words
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:08.840]  with the introduction of the special drawing right they will have
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:13.560]  another way to add another layer to this global ponzi scheme where all of the
[02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:17.240]  u.s dollar denominated debts will be
[02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:21.640]  re-securitized most of the debt will be off the balance sheet
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:25.640]  some of it will be included in the new s dr but the s dr
[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:29.000]  uh... will be loaded up with more debt than even the u.s dollar
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:34.600]  and the result will be this constant downward pressure from above
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:39.880]  where no wages ever go up uh... no savers ever get a return greater than
[02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:43.000]  point oh oh oh one percent on their savings
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:47.240]  and you end up in this casino gulag state where the only way anyone can make
[02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:51.400]  any more money than subsistence stay there gotta break stay there
[02:29:51.400 --> 02:29:55.240]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:55.240 --> 02:30:00.600]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:38.520]  you you basically answered my next question in the last segment but in
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:42.520]  layman's you know simple terms yes uh do you see
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:45.880]  asia plunging next or how far will europe plunge do you think the euro
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:48.280]  zone's going to break up the germans are saying
[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:51.560]  that uh major german newspapers are calling for a
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:57.400]  deutsch reich zone that only has the richest countries uh in europe that are part of it
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:01.160]  so what do you see happening with the euro i know i mean i know you can't
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:03.720]  guess this exactly but you've been very accurate in the past
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:07.160]  how do you see this unfolding who do you see going down next
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:11.640]  uh when does this really start to hit the us
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:16.440]  right well uh as you say i i've been pretty good at
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:20.120]  at framing this and predicting this um
[02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:25.720]  the which i have to understand is he's got a multi trillion dollar hedge fund
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:29.320]  business you know hedge fund is just a fund that
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:33.480]  is not bound by any restrictions in terms of the types of bets that they can
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:36.760]  make and the leverage that they have at their uh
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:40.440]  availability and what they do is they go from
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:45.720]  currency to currency and they and they ferret out which ones are the weakest
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:49.960]  they then scare the bejesus out of the folks they float rumors about
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:54.040]  the economic collapse they crash the economy they make a quick
[02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:57.560]  a hundred billion dollars or so and then they move on
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:03.160]  and um from the euro zone uh i think that they beat up the euro pretty
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:08.280]  pretty good here in the last few weeks i think the next stop is the british pound
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:11.560]  uh the british pound they've got a new government in britain uh they're trying
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:15.400]  to uh bring in some reforms uh they're talking about bringing in banking
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:18.920]  reform so i think that if next time we talk
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:24.200]  we'll be talking about the tragic fall of the british pound
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:28.920]  they'll beat that up for a while and uh then they either will go back to euro
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:33.640]  zone and attack the euro or they may you know come back
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:38.760]  to the u.s because the u.s is always the the currency that these guys know best
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:42.280]  they know how to crash it uh in in the most
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:46.440]  efficient manner and it's always uh in their pocket they could always crash the
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:49.480]  dollar that's something they could always do for a quick buck
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:53.080]  but you can't do it a hundred percent of the time you've got to take terms crashing
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:57.960]  different currencies at different times so i think the way i see it the next
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:02.520]  is the um is the british pound uh the japanese yen
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:07.640]  is kind of a possibility at some point their their economy has been gone now
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:12.360]  20 straight years of deflation and it's still highly problematic
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:17.160]  they import something like you know 100 percent of their energy so it's really
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:21.000]  at the mercy of the global economy economic system
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:24.440]  so that that's always a nice one to go in there occasionally
[02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:28.200]  but they use really the yen really is what's called a funding currency in other
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:31.800]  words they borrow in yen because it's so cheap
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:35.320]  and they use that to go attack a country like the uk
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:39.560]  or the euro zone so it depends on which country has a really weak currency they
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:44.440]  use that to borrow and they go attack another country when i was in Reykjavik
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:47.720]  right before that economy collapsed i sat in the 101
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:51.880]  hotel in the sushi bar and i talked to some bankers from gold from
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:56.040]  Lehman brothers and Bear Stearns and they said look uh
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:39:00.680]  in about six months we're going to attack Iceland and we're going to crash the
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:04.440]  Icelandic chronic and they weren't shy about talking about it
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:08.200]  and uh this is exactly what they did uh now a few years later
[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:10.920]  they're finally getting around to putting some people in jail
[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:15.720]  for counterfeiting and security fraud and all kinds of other crimes
[02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:18.920]  and hopefully they'll put somebody in jail to sit next to Bernie Madoff
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:24.200]  and hopefully Lloyd the blank fine will be there shortly
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:28.280]  and if we just continue to point out the emperors but naked and didn't wear any
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:31.720]  golden outfit like the little three-year-old in the emperors new
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:34.680]  clothes parable in fact guys print me the emperors new
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:37.000]  clothes parable i want to read that next hour on air
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.720]  if we just point out the obvious it's going to implode
[02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:43.480]  max did you see fox news the new york times afp Reuters
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:46.360]  in the last month all come out with a scyop
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:50.280]  and say yes the troops are helping grow the opium
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:53.720]  because if we don't grow it al qaeda will get the money i mean
[02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:56.600]  this had been coming out that our government was there for the opium
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:00.360]  500 billion a year and shipping it in the russians had said this
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:05.240]  but now they're so arrogant they hide it in plain view it's like
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:09.640]  it'd be like president obama being naked at the podium and saying he wasn't naked
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:14.120]  and we're not supposed to point out he's naked so it's some kind of mind control
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:17.000]  thing where they just come out and say yeah we grow the opium
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:21.640]  has never talked to katherine often fits about this yeah the big red button
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:26.280]  um she's got an excellent um a lot of work on the cia
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:30.440]  afghani opium crops and also you know a lot of these hedge funds that you read
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:32.920]  about uh this came out during the savings and loan
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:36.040]  collapse they discovered that many of the hedge funds
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:40.280]  were actually backed by the government and cia and other organizations so
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:45.400]  you and and back in the 2008 crash over that hang and when hang paulson put the
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:48.520]  gun to congress's head and said give us 700 billion dollars we're going to crash
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:51.560]  the economy a lot of people in congress were actually
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:54.520]  short bank stocks they used an exchange traded fund
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:58.200]  which was making negative bets against bank stocks so those congressmen are
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:02.040]  actually making money as those bank stocks were collapsing
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:05.560]  so these guys are just fully invested in the collapse and well that's why i call
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:09.000]  them suicide bankers because they have a fundamentalist
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:12.040]  belief in capitalism as their religion and they're
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:15.320]  willing to blow themselves up in the name of their religious
[02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:19.880]  belief in fanatical capitalism what is this today let me
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:23.800]  forget marith whitney who's a very popular analyst now
[02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:27.640]  she's the one who called out city bank a few years ago right before the crash
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:34.360]  she said this quote financial reform will cause quote tragic
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:39.320]  unemployment levels for an extended period of time
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:43.000]  you see what you see what she's saying if you try to reform us
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:47.640]  then the unemployment levels will be tragic for an extended period of time
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:51.240]  that's an outright threat that's just an outright threat coming from
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:55.240]  lostry if you try to reform us you're never going to get a job again
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:41:59.080]  you know that's just that's just outright tyranny i mean what else can you
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:02.760]  call it you're absolutely right well said max
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:05.640]  keiser and they just continue to threaten let's talk to tom in
[02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:10.360]  kinetica you're on the air hi yeah this is perfect what you're
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:15.000]  talking about but they want to comment on something you said yesterday alex
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:19.720]  and that was you said the it was good that they are arresting the bankers
[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:24.680]  in iceland but then you said it's okay you know we have the great local bankers
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:27.000]  down the street we can get a loan for a car
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.240]  but a private bankers a private bankers a private banker no matter how small
[02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:35.800]  they are how big they are they have the power to factional reserve lending to
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:39.480]  create money out of nothing and what we need
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:44.200]  is public credit directly through our government we need to take the
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:48.840]  responsibility well let me say this i mean i'm all for state banks
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:52.040]  but that's still a bank and it's not going to be able to compete if it
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:56.200]  doesn't have the fractional system and this is a very complex issue
[02:42:56.200 --> 02:42:59.560]  but local banks some are good some are bad the point is
[02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:03.400]  we don't want the mega six banks in the u.s several others globally
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:07.000]  but there's no more than ten anyway you slice it so just for
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:12.040]  simplicity we don't want the mega ten banks to have the regulatory power to
[02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:16.920]  scoop up the smaller banks because then we're really in trouble max keiser
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:22.760]  in north dakota they have a banking system which is sound because they
[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:26.120]  pass some laws to get rid of a lot of the abuses
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:30.680]  and um ellen brown who's a very fine journalist has done a lot of work give
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:35.240]  you type in ellen brown in the search engine and search north dakota banks
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:39.720]  there it is possible to run banks in an equitable fair way
[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:43.960]  and north dakota surprisingly for people probably don't know about this
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:48.200]  they actually have some pretty decent banks because they have decided to
[02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:52.280]  um not try to run with the wolves and to simply
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:56.200]  get in the very simple business though but it's the same thing with texas banks
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:58.440]  they're some of the wealthiest in the country
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:01.560]  and the texas banking association has come out and said
[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:05.720]  we're not selling derivatives we're not the big mega banks they are dangerous
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:09.960]  and so that's important to be friendly with regional banks
[02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:14.280]  uh to be able to defeat the big banks and then later if we want to change
[02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:17.160]  something at that level and and fix abuses at the local level
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:19.720]  i think it's great but tom finish your point
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:23.400]  yeah well that is that is excellent that max brought up ellen brown in her
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:26.120]  book the web of debt in the bank of north dakota
[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:29.960]  no the bank of north dakota is a state owned and operated bank it is
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:34.040]  true sovereign money we need a sovereign monetary system
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:38.360]  not a private debt money system what we have now where they have the power to
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:42.600]  create money they are like a mafia we have to realize that the private bankers
[02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:46.680]  of the world are like a global mafia and we have to stand up to them
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:50.120]  like the people of a village stand up to the mafia and run them out of town
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:55.640]  i agree tom well said absolutely currency should be a symbol of exchange
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:59.960]  not the actual energy you know it it doesn't have the value it's an agreed
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:05.160]  upon mode of exchange and we need to get back to what we had pre-1913
[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:09.240]  let's talk to uh rachel in new york you're on the air
[02:45:09.240 --> 02:45:13.720]  hi um i just wanted to let you know that one of the things that has been going
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:17.320]  on lately um that is not being reported is that many people
[02:45:17.320 --> 02:45:23.400]  appear in new york on wall street are withdrawing there for a one case
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:28.440]  actually i have seen that uh in the news uh the word is getting out but it's not
[02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:31.800]  a big national story uh because of bloomberg and other
[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:35.640]  reports that the federal government is ordering private pension funds to
[02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:38.840]  quote invest in failed banks i mean since when
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:42.920]  can the government order uh because they have regulatory threats if they don't
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:47.080]  see they can selectively enforce max keiser break that down
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:50.600]  right well 401k accounts are the retirement accounts people
[02:45:50.600 --> 02:45:53.560]  squirrel way money every month with their employer now if they're liquidating
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:56.520]  those accounts it could it it what's not being
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:46:00.200]  clear here is either it's because of duress and they need that money
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:03.720]  because they're going bankrupt and they'd have to draw down their savings
[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:09.400]  or two they fear tax hikes coming and the tax advantages of the 401k uh
[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:12.920]  evaporate so why not take that money out and put it somewhere
[02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:15.800]  in another institution that you don't have the same kind of risk
[02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:19.720]  now i think what the caller is referring to is that people are
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:23.240]  removing money from the 401k as an offensive measure
[02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:28.440]  not a defensive measure as a way to uh understand that they need to take more
[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:31.160]  control of their financial well-being and to put
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:34.600]  what they thought was money safely uh put away
[02:46:34.600 --> 02:46:38.200]  into other alternative investments possibly other currencies other countries
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:43.400]  into gold etc well said max keiser uh anything else
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:46.680]  rachel no that's all i just wanted to say many of the people who are speaking
[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:49.160]  to say they rather have their money now
[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:52.840]  than wait there until they're 58 years old when it won't be there anymore
[02:46:52.840 --> 02:46:57.080]  they'll take the tax hit now yeah no that's accelerating good point
[02:46:57.080 --> 02:47:02.120]  let's talk to steven uh in california you're on the air
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:05.880]  mr jones yes sir pleasure to be on your show i'm a
[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:09.480]  first-time caller and kind of a first-time listener and um
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:14.440]  as a young person very living in today uh i've become educated on your show and
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:18.360]  you instill the passion flash interest in government
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:22.280]  and i was wondering if you know how to person in my position my family has no
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:25.400]  legacy and not that uh how do i get into that sort of thing
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:30.200]  well look the in high school in college they make it boring it's government
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:35.480]  it's like it's like alcatraz or something or it's like some you know
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:39.560]  island of dr maru it's it's some imaginary thing far off
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:43.320]  you've got to be involved in government because if you don't it's going to get
[02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:47.000]  taken over by shysters and they're going to rob the hell out of you and hire a
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:51.720]  bunch of uniformed thugs to enforce their corruption it's called tyranny
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:56.040]  and so we've became the wealthiest country in the world because we had a
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:58.280]  small government and we were on top of things
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:00.840]  and we allowed people to keep most of their wealth because it was their god
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:03.880]  given right now we're becoming the center of evil
[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:07.480]  because our wealth has been used to dominate the globe and build an empire
[02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:11.880]  and no one is as is as enslaved as people inside the empire
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:14.840]  and so people are waking up and deciding i better get involved in government
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:18.840]  then they go get involved in government and they find that for those that did
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:22.120]  get involved there's a fake left-right choice which is meant to
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:25.880]  further confuse them okay you know they've they follow the
[02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:29.880]  elebric road they've gotten to the emerald uh you know palace
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:34.040]  they've gone in and there's this big flaming head telling him i am a great
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:37.640]  aas and the next level is going no republicans
[02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:41.640]  and democrats you're not toto pulls the curtain back
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:45.560]  or the two-year-old points out the emperor has no clothes same analogy
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:49.640]  same archetype you pull it back and it's a potbellied little demon goblin
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:53.000]  uh back there that's scared to death of you if we don't pull back the curtain
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:57.080]  and arrest the goblin it's over max keiser
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:00.760]  well if you go back this is a very interesting question because it's a
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:05.560]  very interesting inflection point and um especially for a young person
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:09.560]  now if you remember ronald reagan said
[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:14.280]  government is the problem and he said this under the influence of thinkers like
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:18.440]  milton freedman who believe that the market could solve all problems
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:22.120]  now in 2010 people are saying you know what the market
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:26.360]  is actually the problem and is creating an incredible amount of problems
[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:30.680]  uh on on top of problems so if that's true then
[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:35.320]  does that mean it we're gonna ask ourselves or look at the possibility
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:39.640]  that there might be some saving grace and the idea of having a government but
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:42.600]  here's the next problem max let me comment others of the united states
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:46.120]  created a government that's what they got those countries started on they
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:49.320]  didn't start with a hedge fund they started with a constitution
[02:49:49.320 --> 02:49:53.080]  no i agree with you but it's again to go to expand on that
[02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:57.560]  under the constitution congress controls the issuance of currency and credit
[02:49:57.560 --> 02:50:00.760]  not private bankers so the confusion is going to be with the public
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:04.200]  you're going to have the private bankers pose as a solution
[02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:08.360]  with a type of regulation that is only going to empower them even more
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:13.480]  so how do you get past that well that's the first time so my question is
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:17.560]  and there's a lot of rhetoric and especially in the libertarian camp
[02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:22.760]  that government has nothing to offer and you know i think that that is a
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:27.880]  self-defeating position there has to be some role of government first of all
[02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:32.040]  so the government therefore does not become a dirty word there is a role
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:36.120]  for government that's step number one step number two is as you say
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:39.560]  yeah well it's all in the constitution they recognize gold and silver is the
[02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:43.720]  only constitutionally recognized form of of money and currency
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:47.080]  if that's true that all of the fiat currency fractional reserve
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:50.520]  derivative market scamming that's going on has to be
[02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:54.520]  taken completely out of the yeah we've got to go back to the constitution
[02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:57.720]  that's right stay there stay there i'm gonna talk to ian steve
[02:50:57.720 --> 02:51:01.320]  kevin and others and steve and i'm gonna try to answer your question

[02:54:09.560 --> 02:54:13.880]  what if i say i will never surrender
[02:54:13.880 --> 02:54:16.840]  okay we're gonna continue with calls in this segment the next and then
[02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:20.600]  gary france you ever store the republic with don't tread on me is coming on i
[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:24.680]  want to play miss arizona or miss oklahoma talking
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:27.720]  about arizona says she supports arizona law we're gonna talk
[02:54:27.720 --> 02:54:31.800]  about states rights uh coming up but before i go any
[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:35.000]  further with max keiser i want to simplify this because this gets
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.960]  confusing for people because it is so simple sometimes the simplest things
[02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:41.320]  are confusing i'm against anything big and monolithic
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:44.680]  whether it's government or hedge funds that are bigger than any government
[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:47.960]  money-wise because they just created themselves as thomas jefferson warned
[02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:50.520]  they would a blank check to take over the planet
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:53.960]  you had a paraphrase jefferson he said you know you could take out private
[02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:56.840]  central bankers but if you ever let them back in within one day
[02:54:56.840 --> 02:55:00.760]  they'll buy up the whole world with fake credit they produce so
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:04.200]  the problem is with a quote free market is it's not free market
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:07.480]  when the cia with the inner coterie of private banks
[02:55:07.480 --> 02:55:11.240]  gives themselves unlimited trillions and uses their own regulatory power to
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:14.280]  shut down their competition and so we need government
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:19.320]  to protect the true free market and to have rules against counterfeiting as
[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:22.520]  max keiser said counterfeiting is illegal if i
[02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:26.760]  opened up a fake company started selling stock claiming it was in gold mines i
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:30.680]  didn't own it would be a fraud well it's a it's a step past that
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:34.280]  with the fractional reserve banking with the derivatives with these fake
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:38.040]  insurance companies certifying it and then taxpayers having to bail it out
[02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:42.040]  so that is the issue the quote free markets being demonized
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:44.840]  uh... because by the bankers themselves because they want a global controlled
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:48.360]  market that they control and so it's it's it's until the public becomes
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:51.080]  educated on this it's just going to get worse
[02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:54.520]  again max keiser dot com is his website very informative stuff
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:55:59.960]  and watch him on rt as well as press tv does weekly television shows that are
[02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:04.760]  some of the most popular on those channels uh... but uh... let's go back to
[02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:08.360]  your phone calls uh... briefly answering steve question
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:11.240]  steven i don't know how you get involved quote in government start fighting
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:15.240]  tyranny form your own group go to city council speak out start a blog
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:18.600]  and you'll learn and get better as you go uh... even in england you're on the
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:23.000]  air with questions for max keiser
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:28.680]  hello hello all beyond this is airstrip trip to calling over go ahead
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:34.760]  how you doing alex good i'm good to be on uh... you know it's good to hear max
[02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:38.280]  keiser i've always been uh... an interest
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:41.480]  an interested listener to his opinions and of course your own
[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:45.880]  um... with regards to the the british uh... parliamentary catastrophe that's
[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:49.640]  been going on i mean people think that they can't make a difference but we've
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:54.760]  demonstrated that we've effectively created a constitutional crisis here
[02:56:54.760 --> 02:57:00.360]  that there was nobody who was willing to back up the the parliamentary process
[02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:03.960]  and i think that that's that certainly a statement which which people can take
[02:57:03.960 --> 02:57:09.640]  a little bit of pleasure from if not a great deal of of influence from
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:14.440]  so it did demonstrate the fact that these people don't have any kind of
[02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:18.040]  mandate to to operate the way they have been that's right all three of the big
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:21.720]  parties are hated your take on what's happening in england max
[02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:26.600]  yeah they did they triggered a crisis a constitutional crisis as as your caller
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:32.120]  uh... calls it and because in the uk they become very adept at strategic
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:37.320]  voting so everybody uh... on on the web kind of shares information
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:40.840]  to try to uh... swing the local elections
[02:57:40.840 --> 02:57:44.520]  in a strategic way so they might vote for somebody they don't really want
[02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:48.440]  if it's strategic toward a bigger goal and the people have really organized
[02:57:48.440 --> 02:57:51.000]  themselves in this way now it's interesting when the new coalition
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:54.360]  started this uh... tori liberal democrat coalition
[02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:58.200]  it's very interesting because because they uh... what the coalition government
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:01.400]  didn't have a majority they had a problem because in the house of lords
[02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:05.560]  uh... they didn't have enough lords uh... to back up their proposals so what
[02:58:05.560 --> 02:58:09.480]  they did yesterday is they simply with a stroke of a pen
[02:58:09.480 --> 02:58:13.320]  increased the number of lords in the house of lords by one hundred
[02:58:13.320 --> 02:58:17.400]  now for anyone in the u.s. that would send a chill down your spine
[02:58:17.400 --> 02:58:21.880]  because of course we fought a war to get rid of it to get rid to you know
[02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:25.640]  escape the lords uh... in the house of lords but they're still
[02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:29.320]  active and they're still part of a major government the u.s. ally
[02:58:29.320 --> 02:58:32.840]  that's where the bank of england was established in 1694 which is
[02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:36.360]  plus they're not hereditary lords they're not a red or five more minutes with

[03:00:25.880 --> 03:00:30.360]  the people are saying no to the banking dictatorship there is a global
[03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:35.720]  rebellion insurrection against the new world order right as it's being born
[03:00:35.720 --> 03:00:40.520]  as i've always said dead on arrival a few final calls for max keiser

[03:00:53.560 --> 03:00:57.400]  hello alex how are you good sir thank you for taking my call i'm really glad
[03:00:57.400 --> 03:01:00.840]  you made reference to thomas jefferson a few minutes ago because
[03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:04.040]  my question has to do with two of our root problems one of them is the
[03:01:04.040 --> 03:01:07.640]  dictatorship of the federal reserve and the other happens to be
[03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:11.080]  the way we're decentralized and we don't have a common ground to
[03:01:11.080 --> 03:01:15.240]  make our voices heard what if we drafted a new declaration of independence
[03:01:15.240 --> 03:01:19.000]  against the federal reserve and we're able to be co-signers to it on info
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:22.520]  wars dot com given the fact that you have millions of listeners
[03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:26.040]  what if we actually let our voices and our numbers be heard well i think you
[03:01:26.040 --> 03:01:32.040]  think too much of me but i am for say getting 1520 states who've got true
[03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:35.560]  anti-new world order patriots in it and then having a real constitutional
[03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:40.360]  convention with men of great gravitas and and others there and have it all
[03:01:40.360 --> 03:01:44.760]  televised and then have them meet for a few months so the public
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:47.720]  could you know chime in almost like american idol
[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:51.000]  imagine the ratings this would get you know like to say what they wanted
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.880]  inside the declaration of independence of course swearing allegiance to the
[03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:58.120]  previous system but recodifying our independence against the against not
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:01.480]  king george the third but the banking cartel it'd be a great
[03:02:01.480 --> 03:02:05.080]  illustration and give a uh... uh...
[03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:09.880]  a avenue of resistance and a focal point max keiser
[03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:13.000]  well i have a slightly different opinion i mean because this is
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:18.200]  basically a global problem i think the americans should approach it in that way
[03:02:18.200 --> 03:02:23.240]  and for the corner that just called in what i i would i would think to do
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:27.400]  is to contact the people in iceland in the contact of people in greece
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:30.920]  and tell them you're behind them and we have support in the global
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:36.760]  i totally agree max but if the new world order falls here it falls forever
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:40.280]  this is like this is like lennon grad this is like lennon grad let me tell
[03:02:40.280 --> 03:02:43.640]  you something basically you've already got some momentum
[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:49.480]  going on right now so it'll come to the u.s when it comes to the u.s but in the
[03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:53.400]  meantime you've got iceland greece are now joining they're creating a new joint
[03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:58.120]  flag the war is now it's happening right now so people you know during the
[03:02:58.120 --> 03:03:02.520]  member hemmingway went to fight in the in the in europe during the war
[03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:06.600]  for whom the bell tolls just re-read it going to other places to fight wars
[03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:09.880]  abroad because they believe in a certain way the thing should be done now there's
[03:03:09.880 --> 03:03:14.360]  a war going on right now in greece the americans should be helping the greecs
[03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:18.920]  fight the tyranny in greece and that's the responsibility of every freedom
[03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:24.440]  loving american i agree with you i just re-read for who the bell tolls
[03:03:24.440 --> 03:03:28.040]  as he lays there at the end with his heart beating against the pine needles
[03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:32.280]  what a powerful book okay well even the man is a man of principle
[03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:36.280]  and where there's people out there who are you know that's what the u.s
[03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:39.800]  they used to stand for wherever there's tyranny the u.s went to put out the fire
[03:03:39.800 --> 03:03:44.440]  then along the way came you know the banking nightmare that we now know
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:47.240]  but those people in greece the people in iceland the people in port school the
[03:03:47.240 --> 03:03:51.240]  people in spain they need support and we can help support them i'm already in
[03:03:51.240 --> 03:03:54.600]  europe i'm already supporting all right listen youtube which i did i now
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:04:00.600]  deserve english has been translated into greek it has now 400 000 views you've
[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:03.640]  done well yeah i know you're having a great effect out there now the greek
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:07.560]  government is saying the exact same thing that was said in that video that
[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:11.640]  they want to go investigate the fraud they want to look at the issues of
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:15.560]  transparency and through back channels i can tell you that there's some
[03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:19.480]  communication going on the the revolution's happening no i know i mean
[03:04:19.480 --> 03:04:23.320]  i'm in communication with the griggs as well and we're all working together and

[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:35.240]  what do you think about what's happening in thailand
[03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:39.320]  it's more of the same you know it's just a different flavor the same of the same
[03:04:39.320 --> 03:04:44.680]  ice cream store of of fraud and you know those folks are getting screwed just
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:47.400]  like the other folks from other countries it's just a slightly different
[03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:51.720]  configuration but the issues are the same the those in power want to steal all
[03:04:51.720 --> 03:04:54.760]  the wealth and they don't end the people who are workers and savers are
[03:04:54.760 --> 03:04:58.440]  getting all right we're out of time max talk to you again soon god bless you

[03:08:34.920 --> 03:08:38.360]  re-regulation but the bill was written by the big banks just like the
[03:08:38.360 --> 03:08:40.920]  insurance companies wrote the insurance plan
[03:08:40.920 --> 03:08:44.600]  and so you got obama's people preemptively
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:50.120]  stirring up attacks you know protest on banks
[03:08:50.120 --> 03:08:54.760]  his hired henchmen on record commanded by the white house
[03:08:54.760 --> 03:08:59.080]  are in there saying let's get the banks federal reserve act of 1913 same thing
[03:08:59.080 --> 03:09:02.280]  was done then that'll get them that'll teach them
[03:09:02.280 --> 03:09:05.160]  yeah let them shut down all their competition that the
[03:09:05.160 --> 03:09:09.000]  that are local banks been we've gone over the bill here it's been mainstream

[03:09:11.640 --> 03:09:15.640]  live time controlled by the feds oh that's really good
[03:09:15.640 --> 03:09:19.400]  that's that's another bait and switch by these people and it's the same
[03:09:19.400 --> 03:09:25.080]  type of tricks over and over and over again
[03:09:25.080 --> 03:09:27.960]  why can't people get more sophisticated i guess they are starting to get more
[03:09:27.960 --> 03:09:31.960]  sophisticated but we don't have time for an education curve here folks
[03:09:31.960 --> 03:09:35.720]  this is crash course in brain surgery and i know my general audience is smarter

[03:09:48.680 --> 03:09:53.160]  gracing saying we've defeated the fed oh yeah it's just taken over right now
[03:09:53.160 --> 03:09:56.760]  by changing ron paul's bill in the senate and then telling people
[03:09:56.760 --> 03:10:00.040]  with bernie sanders that it's a defeat of the federal reserve
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:04.120]  bull goldman sacks being investigated by the feds
[03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:07.320]  it's almost completely goldman sacks that run all the federal regulatory
[03:10:07.320 --> 03:10:10.840]  agencies they're going to burn some mid-level trailer on

[03:11:04.600 --> 03:11:08.920]  produced a film with william louis and we are

[03:11:13.320 --> 03:11:15.960]  everything that's happening gary good to have you
[03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:19.880]  alexis a pleasure to be here thanks for having me back well i mean so much is
[03:11:19.880 --> 03:11:23.240]  going on so much is happening the solution is this film
[03:11:23.240 --> 03:11:26.360]  you can hand this to somebody the difference between a republic and a
[03:11:26.360 --> 03:11:30.120]  democracy that i mean break it down for folks why
[03:11:30.120 --> 03:11:32.760]  they need to get and and have viewing parties
[03:11:32.760 --> 03:11:37.720]  and show it to everyone they know rise of the republic don't tread on me
[03:11:37.720 --> 03:11:41.560]  well you know alex the reason we made this film is because so often we're
[03:11:41.560 --> 03:11:45.160]  asked well where are the solutions you know all here is the problem the problem
[03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:48.440]  the problem uh... so that's why we we set out to make
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:52.440]  this film and it's sort of like a it's like an unofficial sequel to camp
[03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:55.400]  fema if you would because if you're watching the end of camp fema we start
[03:11:55.400 --> 03:11:59.960]  to go into states rights and i got the idea one night when i was
[03:11:59.960 --> 03:12:03.880]  watching and screening camp fema once again i said you know we really got to
[03:12:03.880 --> 03:12:07.400]  expound on this issue we got to expound upon the tenth amendment
[03:12:07.400 --> 03:12:11.080]  and really give people the information that they need
[03:12:11.080 --> 03:12:14.760]  so that they can introduce the legislation that we talk about in the
[03:12:14.760 --> 03:12:18.520]  film all that can really put teeth into the tenth amendment
[03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:23.240]  uh... that can rain in the federal government and also expose the different
[03:12:23.240 --> 03:12:26.440]  methods the federal government uses to rain in the states you know that
[03:12:26.440 --> 03:12:30.600]  we call it the choke collar that the that the federal government uses
[03:12:30.600 --> 03:12:34.200]  so not just it's not just about states rights but we also talk about
[03:12:34.200 --> 03:12:38.680]  empowering the individual with the second amendment what that really means and
[03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:43.720]  we we we talked to uh... edwin via about the constitutional militia
[03:12:43.720 --> 03:12:46.840]  uh... we talked to uh... charles key in oklahoma
[03:12:46.840 --> 03:12:49.960]  uh... one of the one of the big proponents of the tenth amendment
[03:12:49.960 --> 03:12:52.120]  spearheading the tenth amendment movement in this country
[03:12:52.120 --> 03:12:55.000]  uh... so it's really interesting and it's an excellent cross section of
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:59.560]  movements action and what people can do to take back this country and history and
[03:12:59.560 --> 03:13:01.640]  history i mean over and over again you explain
[03:13:01.640 --> 03:13:05.400]  the difference between a republic and a democracy break it down for folks
[03:13:05.400 --> 03:13:08.760]  well most folks don't even realize and well you ask the average person on the
[03:13:08.760 --> 03:13:11.480]  street they say well we are a democracy and you say no no no
[03:13:11.480 --> 03:13:14.200]  we are republic we are based on laws democracy
[03:13:14.200 --> 03:13:17.320]  is what we so often refer to is you know two wolves and a sheep
[03:13:17.320 --> 03:13:20.920]  voting on what's for dinner you know majority rules and that's not
[03:13:20.920 --> 03:13:24.920]  necessarily the case here uh... it is the law that is in control the
[03:13:24.920 --> 03:13:27.960]  constitution that is the foundation for this country
[03:13:27.960 --> 03:13:30.680]  and that's what the film's about it's about restoring the constitutional
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:35.000]  values that democracy is very dangerous i mean if you have a democracy
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:38.840]  i want to go back to to greece twenty four hundred years ago
[03:13:38.840 --> 03:13:43.960]  only the elite families had voting and they would go up to the top of a hill
[03:13:43.960 --> 03:13:48.200]  this is on record they had a bucket for black rocks a bucket for white rocks
[03:13:48.200 --> 03:13:51.720]  and a white rock was a yay a black rock was a nay and it was the first
[03:13:51.720 --> 03:13:55.800]  parliamentary procedure and they had a little ample theater and there was a
[03:13:55.800 --> 03:13:59.240]  cliff about a hundred yards away and this is historical fact
[03:13:59.240 --> 03:14:03.240]  and they had different voting centers and routinely they'd have a vote on
[03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:07.400]  we're mad at this philosopher he's calling you know for overthrowing our
[03:14:07.400 --> 03:14:10.840]  corrupt system and they would vote to kill him or not they go throw him off
[03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:15.000]  the cliff uh... or chop his head off so in a democracy
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:20.040]  if you get fifty one percent to vote uh... to steal somebody's ranch or farm
[03:14:20.040 --> 03:14:22.760]  or business or make them pay more taxes
[03:14:22.760 --> 03:14:27.240]  then you can do it in a democracy in a republic everyone is protected by that
[03:14:27.240 --> 03:14:30.440]  bill of rights and nothing nothing can overturn it
[03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:33.560]  and if someone tries to they are a tyrant
[03:14:33.560 --> 03:14:37.640]  right it doesn't matter if you're a minority or majority in the population
[03:14:37.640 --> 03:14:41.720]  it is the law and is the rights that are inherent in the constitution
[03:14:41.720 --> 03:14:45.800]  that allow us to have the freedom let's point out our in
[03:14:45.800 --> 03:14:50.040]  our naval rights absolutely that exists as as the night the amendment states
[03:14:50.040 --> 03:14:54.040]  that exists before this compact this is just a statement of the
[03:14:54.040 --> 03:15:00.200]  already observed liberties of the free humans on this planet
[03:15:00.200 --> 03:15:03.640]  well you're absolutely right alex and you know that the film
[03:15:03.640 --> 03:15:08.360]  the film itself that yeah i love the video you made in any
[03:15:08.360 --> 03:15:11.320]  you kind of smirked in the video and you said the southern poverty law center
[03:15:11.320 --> 03:15:14.360]  is really gonna love this film
[03:15:14.360 --> 03:15:17.400]  camp fema was was was out there for them apparently
[03:15:17.400 --> 03:15:20.200]  uh... but this film is really going to get under their skin and we're going to
[03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:23.560]  send them an autograph copy well they've been deep for those that don't know on
[03:15:23.560 --> 03:15:26.600]  CNN and other channels they've been demonizing camp fema
[03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:30.360]  uh... and the southern poverty law centers been demonizing it so yeah if
[03:15:30.360 --> 03:15:33.000]  they didn't like that they're really not going to like this
[03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:37.560]  no absolutely not i mean look they want to put out you know these rage on the
[03:15:37.560 --> 03:15:42.040]  right and the the rise of the right need these dis dis dis info pieces out there
[03:15:42.040 --> 03:15:45.720]  this is the rise of the republic absolutely this is the rise of the
[03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:49.560]  republic we're documenting it here uh... and i want people to know that they can
[03:15:49.560 --> 03:15:53.240]  make copies of this film they make purchase a copy make copies
[03:15:53.240 --> 03:15:56.440]  pass it out hand to hand it's the viral distribution is going to get this
[03:15:56.440 --> 03:16:00.360]  message to the american people well you've done well gary and so has uh
[03:16:00.360 --> 03:16:04.680]  william louis i want to play a clip here to illustrate the difference between a
[03:16:04.680 --> 03:16:09.000]  mainline moron that doesn't know the bill of rights and constitution
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:12.440]  uh... miss teen south carolina a few years ago
[03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:17.000]  versus miss oklahoma morgan elizabeth wallard
[03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:22.120]  the difference between an informed patriot woman and a dingbat educated in
[03:16:22.120 --> 03:16:25.560]  the public school system uh... let's go to miss teen
[03:16:25.560 --> 03:16:29.960]  south carolina first
[03:16:29.960 --> 03:16:34.840]  a fifth of americans can't locate the u.s on a world map
[03:16:34.840 --> 03:16:41.880]  why do you think this is i personally believe that u.s americans
[03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:48.520]  are unable to do so because uh... some people out there in our nation
[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:53.480]  don't have bounce and uh... i believe that our education like such as
[03:16:53.480 --> 03:16:58.600]  south africa and uh... iraq everywhere like such as and
[03:16:58.600 --> 03:17:02.760]  i believe that they should uh... our education over here
[03:17:02.760 --> 03:17:07.080]  in the u.s should help the u.s or should help south africa
[03:17:07.080 --> 03:17:11.560]  it should help iraq in the asian countries so we will be able to build up
[03:17:11.560 --> 03:17:16.200]  our future for us thank you very much south carolina
[03:17:16.200 --> 03:17:19.560]  listen how did you see just mindlessly spewed a bunch of political
[03:17:19.560 --> 03:17:23.080]  correct words help the children help south africa
[03:17:23.080 --> 03:17:26.200]  you know the the struggle of the eighties or whatever that was the cost of
[03:17:26.200 --> 03:17:30.440]  the lab now let's hear uh... with the u.s a pageant
[03:17:30.440 --> 03:17:34.040]  last night miss oklahoma uh... getting a big cheer
[03:17:34.040 --> 03:17:38.040]  when she talked about states rights uh... this is an intelligent woman
[03:17:38.040 --> 03:17:41.800]  versus uh... the product of the new world order here it is
[03:17:41.800 --> 03:17:45.000]  ask her new answer question please
[03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:48.360]  hello miss oklahoma how are you i'm doing so great thank you
[03:17:48.360 --> 03:17:52.680]  already arizona's new immigration statute authorizes law enforcement
[03:17:52.680 --> 03:17:55.800]  authorities to check the citizenship of anyone
[03:17:55.800 --> 03:17:58.600]  they believe maybe in the country illegally
[03:17:58.600 --> 03:18:01.800]  now listen to the question before you go
[03:18:01.800 --> 03:18:05.560]  critics say this may uh... uh... amount to racial
[03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:10.440]  uh... profiling do you think that this should be mandated by the state or by
[03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:13.560]  the federal government
[03:18:13.560 --> 03:18:17.720]  i'm a huge believer in states rights i think that's what's so wonderful about
[03:18:17.720 --> 03:18:27.640]  america so i think it's personally perfectly
[03:18:27.640 --> 03:18:31.800]  fine for arizona to create that law and i am
[03:18:31.800 --> 03:18:35.000]  against illegal immigration but i'm also against racial profiling
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:39.800]  so i see both sides in this issue thank you very much
[03:18:39.800 --> 03:18:45.400]  okay so there you go he was trying to cue them to boo her don't boo yet
[03:18:45.400 --> 03:18:49.960]  and they didn't boo they cheered her and so again and they've tried to
[03:18:49.960 --> 03:18:54.520]  misconstrue what this law does uh... it only allows after first contact say with
[03:18:54.520 --> 03:18:59.960]  a drunk driver if they're not a citizen of two to enforce the law
[03:18:59.960 --> 03:19:03.720]  and then meanwhile citizens have checkpoints the feds are funding everywhere

[03:24:10.440 --> 03:24:16.440]  calls but for just five minutes historian uh and uh good friend of mine
[03:24:16.440 --> 03:24:21.640]  webster griffin tarpley pops in with us to give us his
[03:24:21.640 --> 03:24:24.280]  take on what's happening in thailand
[03:24:24.280 --> 03:24:29.880]  webster i think uh thailand is basically a mess and and here's what it is you
[03:24:29.880 --> 03:24:32.520]  have these two parties right you have the red shirts
[03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:36.200]  who demand the return of the exiled prime minister thaksin and
[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:41.480]  they've been uh engaging in some some protests but also some violence then
[03:24:41.480 --> 03:24:44.040]  you have the government which is this guy up his
[03:24:44.040 --> 03:24:48.120]  hit uh representing the uh the privileged classes basically
[03:24:48.120 --> 03:24:51.960]  you have to remember that in thailand the army is traditionally a big political
[03:24:51.960 --> 03:24:56.200]  power and you have a monarchy you have king boomi balls who uh is now pretty
[03:24:56.200 --> 03:25:01.640]  old but he was uh quite a firm hand uh over over quite a few decades now
[03:25:01.640 --> 03:25:06.360]  thaksin the exiled guy that the richards want to bring back
[03:25:06.360 --> 03:25:11.640]  when he was in power from 2001 to 2006 he did some good things he uh got the
[03:25:11.640 --> 03:25:14.760]  international monetary fund out of the country always good
[03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:19.960]  he instituted a health care system he also gave farmers a moratorium on debt
[03:25:19.960 --> 03:25:22.440]  they got debt relief from this guy
[03:25:22.440 --> 03:25:26.600]  the problem with this is that the red shirts of today
[03:25:26.600 --> 03:25:30.520]  seem to be less a force for a program in the way that
[03:25:30.520 --> 03:25:35.720]  you might conclude from you know what thaksin did more of a force for chaos
[03:25:35.720 --> 03:25:40.120]  than for anything specific uh you've also got to put this
[03:25:40.120 --> 03:25:44.120]  in the context of uh china right because they're close by
[03:25:44.120 --> 03:25:47.800]  thailand is one of the string of pearls one of the countries that china would
[03:25:47.800 --> 03:25:51.960]  like to have good relations with china wants stability they want
[03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:55.400]  predictability they're willing to compromise with the
[03:25:55.400 --> 03:25:59.720]  with some pretty ugly people so more western encirclement of china
[03:25:59.720 --> 03:26:03.160]  uh i'm not sure look it's a little bit more complicated here's what i would
[03:26:03.160 --> 03:26:06.920]  say right now if you look at the chinese coverage on thailand
[03:26:06.920 --> 03:26:11.000]  they don't seem to choose sides very clearly what they do is
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:15.880]  deplore the fact that the society is breaking down right the democracy has
[03:26:15.880 --> 03:26:20.840]  failed uh that you've got essentially the breakdown of the political system
[03:26:20.840 --> 03:26:24.840]  and you're headed for chaos and i would also stress the world economic
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:29.320]  depression in the background is fueling chaos in many countries
[03:26:29.320 --> 03:26:33.080]  so with this you might say that thailand is on its way to being some kind of a
[03:26:33.080 --> 03:26:37.160]  permanently failed state uh the wall street journal of this morning
[03:26:37.160 --> 03:26:41.160]  wants the existing government to step down to resign so that's clear enough
[03:26:41.160 --> 03:26:45.720]  but i think they they want that with the idea that thailand will descend into
[03:26:45.720 --> 03:26:51.240]  chaos and that will become a problem for china right chaos refugees uh and so
[03:26:51.240 --> 03:26:56.200]  forth so again i think this is really really a mess
[03:26:56.200 --> 03:26:59.560]  all right we've got about two minutes left uh we haven't talked to you in about a
[03:26:59.560 --> 03:27:04.120]  week uh the deterioration with the euro uh with the different
[03:27:04.120 --> 03:27:07.080]  germany's uh now threatening to pull out or
[03:27:07.080 --> 03:27:11.400]  issue a new mark state where do you see that going well it's this is this is also
[03:27:11.400 --> 03:27:15.080]  chaos now but this is this is very clear this is the attack of the hedge funds
[03:27:15.080 --> 03:27:18.920]  the hedge fund iina's using credit default swap derivatives are
[03:27:18.920 --> 03:27:22.840]  continuing to attack greece and the euro and the thing that the europeans have
[03:27:22.840 --> 03:27:27.240]  got to do is pull themselves together kick out the us hedge funds
[03:27:27.240 --> 03:27:30.520]  ban hedge funds uh or as close as they can to that
[03:27:30.520 --> 03:27:34.360]  and do something like ban credit default swaps unless they do this
[03:27:34.360 --> 03:27:38.200]  uh they will indeed collapse into chaos and it won't be an orderly
[03:27:38.200 --> 03:27:41.800]  retreat from the euro it'll be just a chaotic breakdown and that's
[03:27:41.800 --> 03:27:47.800]  that's not good for anybody well said uh are things deteriorating quickly
[03:27:47.800 --> 03:27:51.160]  more quickly than they were last week or any other developments on the economic
[03:27:51.160 --> 03:27:54.680]  front well you know you've you've got um
[03:27:54.680 --> 03:27:58.680]  the the uh continued pressure right and it's it's essentially a bunch of uh
[03:27:58.680 --> 03:28:02.840]  of shorts right people are shorting the euro and again that now nowadays they
[03:28:02.840 --> 03:28:07.080]  don't do a sort of old-fashioned short they do the credit default swap
[03:28:07.080 --> 03:28:10.760]  as a short and they they do that behind the screen of these
[03:28:10.760 --> 03:28:14.920]  hedge funds you can be sure that the main zombie banks uh jp morgan and bank of
[03:28:14.920 --> 03:28:19.000]  america and so forth they're all up to their necks in this and the irony is
[03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:23.480]  that greece is more viable than the bankrupt zombie banks that are attacking
[03:28:23.480 --> 03:28:26.760]  greece uh and that came out that came out with
[03:28:26.760 --> 03:28:30.120]  uh iceland once they had said no the books got opened and it turned out it
[03:28:30.120 --> 03:28:33.400]  was the banks that were in trouble and and then iceland did i didn't know the
[03:28:33.400 --> 03:28:37.240]  money in the last minute a little silly side note but i want to correct it if
[03:28:37.240 --> 03:28:40.200]  it's wrong because i got a few emails and saw a youtube comment
[03:28:40.200 --> 03:28:44.280]  i had read a book that you had uh uh written on history
[03:28:44.280 --> 03:28:48.680]  and i had read that you were uh had a doctorate in history and so i called you
[03:28:48.680 --> 03:28:52.680]  dr tarpley right and i'd read that in other books that were mentioning you
[03:28:52.680 --> 03:28:55.880]  you'd never really talked about it but you are a doctor correct yes right the

[03:37:24.280 --> 03:37:29.640]  this is from w l n s tv news news six this should be police caught lying
[03:37:29.640 --> 03:37:32.520]  because i have the other articles from cnn you name it
[03:37:32.520 --> 03:37:36.040]  where the cops were saying it was an accident that the mother jumped on them
[03:37:36.040 --> 03:37:40.040]  and all these other lies the a and e footage
[03:37:40.040 --> 03:37:45.160]  the crime show the first 48 shows a shot fired
[03:37:45.160 --> 03:37:49.480]  after police threw a flashbang inside the home i have other articles on this
[03:37:49.480 --> 03:37:53.640]  seconds after they flow of flashbang in a cop
[03:37:53.640 --> 03:37:57.080]  i've seen texas cases where they shoot their own cop in the back and then frame
[03:37:57.080 --> 03:38:00.680]  the guy inside the house who didn't even have guns until a swat team guy told the
[03:38:00.680 --> 03:38:04.040]  truth but i mean it's just it's insane
[03:38:04.040 --> 03:38:07.560]  gary franchi your take on this you know why are they going in the house in the
[03:38:07.560 --> 03:38:11.480]  first place do we know oh they claim that they were
[03:38:11.480 --> 03:38:15.320]  serving a murder investigation warrant but it turns out that the person wasn't
[03:38:15.320 --> 03:38:18.760]  there okay so they they obviously didn't
[03:38:18.760 --> 03:38:22.200]  bother to do any proper surveillance or do their homework and said they barge
[03:38:22.200 --> 03:38:25.800]  into the house and and they shoot this young girl is that
[03:38:25.800 --> 03:38:28.520]  is that the story then yeah killed her deader in the hammer shot her in the
[03:38:28.520 --> 03:38:31.960]  neck blew her head off basically oh god
[03:38:31.960 --> 03:38:37.080]  alex is i'm sorry this is a terrible tragedy
[03:38:37.080 --> 03:38:41.960]  i'm sorry it's disgusting and despicable um i know we're talking about states
[03:38:41.960 --> 03:38:49.320]  rights here but this is a local local police right local slash
[03:38:50.840 --> 03:38:54.120]  what's gonna happen to these guys are they gonna get promoted they'll probably
[03:38:54.120 --> 03:38:59.160]  get a medal yeah unbelievable well my issue is we've all seen
[03:38:59.160 --> 03:39:01.960]  them killing dogs and houses for a gram of marijuana
[03:39:01.960 --> 03:39:05.240]  and that's basically i've been corrected that's two marijuana cigarettes
[03:39:05.240 --> 03:39:08.760]  and and they just shoot the corgi and the bulldog
[03:39:08.760 --> 03:39:13.000]  and it's basically funny to them this is the phony drug war which again is another
[03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:16.600]  states rights issue 14 states are trying to decriminalize
[03:39:16.600 --> 03:39:19.560]  do the same thing so we don't collapse like mexico or china
[03:39:19.560 --> 03:39:22.920]  with their past drug wars again let's get into that
[03:39:22.920 --> 03:39:27.800]  along the lines of don't tread on me well what i'm concerned with here is that
[03:39:27.800 --> 03:39:32.120]  the overuse of aggression by police i mean you you're seeing it
[03:39:32.120 --> 03:39:36.360]  there is an upward trend of this i mean they're kicking in people's doors for
[03:39:36.360 --> 03:39:40.680]  you know a couple marijuana cigarettes they're tasering people at police
[03:39:40.680 --> 03:39:44.600]  checkpoints or or just standard traffic stops because somebody doesn't want to
[03:39:44.600 --> 03:39:49.000]  sign their their rights away on a ticket
[03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:55.640]  um it's absurd the amounts of look the american people are fed up
[03:39:55.640 --> 03:39:59.640]  and we document in the film i mean it all comes back to
[03:39:59.640 --> 03:40:03.320]  what's going on at the local level at the state level
[03:40:03.320 --> 03:40:07.400]  and we need to get the american people fired up we need to take this country
[03:40:07.400 --> 03:40:11.240]  back and it's what line what side of the
[03:40:11.240 --> 03:40:15.240]  line you're going to stand on i mean how much abuse are the american people
[03:40:15.240 --> 03:40:18.920]  going to take before we just say enough is enough i mean
[03:40:18.920 --> 03:40:23.480]  the greeks over there i have family in greece right now
[03:40:23.480 --> 03:40:27.240]  who cannot leave greece they're locked in their homes because
[03:40:27.240 --> 03:40:30.440]  because people are are riding in the streets because of the
[03:40:30.440 --> 03:40:33.960]  the socialist tactics of the international bankers that are going on
[03:40:33.960 --> 03:40:37.240]  right now and it's it's going to happen here
[03:40:37.240 --> 03:40:41.160]  well we don't like that to happen it the american people have to rise up
[03:40:41.160 --> 03:40:44.760]  well dealing with states rights dealing with states rights that are covered
[03:40:44.760 --> 03:40:46.920]  in the film don't tread on these people understand
[03:40:46.920 --> 03:40:50.200]  this is the key what's your view on the arizona law
[03:40:50.200 --> 03:40:53.960]  a and b have you seen my coverage of machete
[03:40:53.960 --> 03:40:58.600]  and we've gotten a script and it clearly is trying to invoke a race war again
[03:40:58.600 --> 03:41:02.840]  more divide and conquer well the arizona law
[03:41:02.840 --> 03:41:06.360]  in my opinion it's needed it is needed
[03:41:06.360 --> 03:41:11.160]  uh... as far as the first contact situation with the police
[03:41:11.160 --> 03:41:14.200]  all the rhetoric i'm seeing from the opposing viewpoint is all they're just
[03:41:14.200 --> 03:41:16.600]  gonna start racial profiling they're gonna start
[03:41:16.600 --> 03:41:20.120]  uh... you know a busting down illegals left and right
[03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:23.640]  but there has to have they have to have a reason well that's why the cock fight
[03:41:23.640 --> 03:41:25.240]  with a hundred people at it
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:30.200]  uh... twenty plus illegal aliens are pile arrested them all
[03:41:30.200 --> 03:41:34.920]  well look but that's first contact i mean that's first contact
[03:41:34.920 --> 03:41:38.920]  they were there for illegal gambling to the killing of animals and there was
[03:41:38.920 --> 03:41:43.240]  drug dealing going on well then they should be able to check the status
[03:41:43.240 --> 03:41:47.960]  look my my family came here a couple generations ago they checked in at
[03:41:47.960 --> 03:41:50.200]  else island they did it the right way
[03:41:50.200 --> 03:41:52.520]  you know come on let's have some respect for the border let's have some
[03:41:52.520 --> 03:41:54.840]  respect for the for the american culture
[03:41:54.840 --> 03:41:58.040]  i mean see i'm seeing kids stories about kids being kicked out of schools
[03:41:58.040 --> 03:42:00.920]  because they weren't american flag t-shirts because it's
[03:42:00.920 --> 03:42:04.600]  because it's inflammatory i mean alex's country is
[03:42:04.600 --> 03:42:08.120]  is in a rapid descent and if we don't do something now
[03:42:08.120 --> 03:42:12.360]  we are going to lose it we are going to lose the country we're fighting for
[03:42:12.360 --> 03:42:15.480]  i hardly agree with you and it's all covered and don't tread on me rise of
[03:42:15.480 --> 03:42:19.320]  the republic uh... you've got an organization of hundreds
[03:42:19.320 --> 03:42:21.240]  of thousands of people that are involved
[03:42:21.240 --> 03:42:24.680]  uh... you know one of the you know in the top five or six in the country
[03:42:24.680 --> 03:42:27.640]  uh... with true activists that are really carrying the torch outside the
[03:42:27.640 --> 03:42:30.440]  left-right paradigm of constitutional liberty
[03:42:30.440 --> 03:42:35.400]  i'm seeing exponential awakening of absolutely where you're at

[03:46:03.240 --> 03:46:06.360]  kevin in california you're on the air welcome
[03:46:06.360 --> 03:46:11.560]  hi i just had a quick question my parents are part of a credit union in
[03:46:11.560 --> 03:46:14.760]  this way that their money is safe in the credit union
[03:46:14.760 --> 03:46:18.600]  and i don't know if it is safe in the credit union or
[03:46:18.600 --> 03:46:22.120]  just because it's not a bank it's not safe and i don't know i want to know
[03:46:22.120 --> 03:46:24.600]  what you thought about that
[03:46:24.600 --> 03:46:29.320]  i think uh... hedging your bets if your money is in banks local is the way to go
[03:46:29.320 --> 03:46:32.600]  credit unions are the way to go go look at their state rating not just their
[03:46:32.600 --> 03:46:33.240]  uh...
[03:46:33.240 --> 03:46:37.320]  barons or forbes rating uh... put the name of the bank you know i mean just
[03:46:37.320 --> 03:46:40.680]  just you know google the term research in the term or start page dot com the
[03:46:40.680 --> 03:46:41.960]  term whatever you want
[03:46:41.960 --> 03:46:44.840]  uh... you know bank ratings in your state
[03:46:44.840 --> 03:46:47.880]  and then look at the ratings of local banks and then
[03:46:47.880 --> 03:46:50.840]  uh... split your money into the number one in number two banks if you're giving
[03:46:50.840 --> 03:46:51.560]  any money
[03:46:51.560 --> 03:46:55.560]  and capital in the banking system what we're going into is so dangerous
[03:46:55.560 --> 03:46:58.440]  that i don't even know that's safe for people to have money in the bank but if
[03:46:58.440 --> 03:47:00.520]  you've got a business like mine in operation
[03:47:00.520 --> 03:47:03.720]  where you've got to pay for things and pay employees
[03:47:03.720 --> 03:47:06.680]  you know if you've got an operation with fifteen twenty thirty people
[03:47:06.680 --> 03:47:09.880]  you've got to have a bunch of money in the bank just to pay payroll and taxes
[03:47:09.880 --> 03:47:11.080]  and run the operation
[03:47:11.080 --> 03:47:14.680]  but i appreciate your call kevin let's get a take on that from gary francy
[03:47:14.680 --> 03:47:18.440]  well i think uh... you know precious metals is absolutely crucial at this
[03:47:18.440 --> 03:47:19.240]  time because
[03:47:19.240 --> 03:47:22.440]  you know it in the end at the end of the day when everything goes down
[03:47:22.440 --> 03:47:26.200]  paper is worthless uh... you'll be able to start a fire with it maybe
[03:47:26.200 --> 03:47:29.560]  uh... you know if your water still you know if your water doesn't put it out
[03:47:29.560 --> 03:47:30.280]  right
[03:47:30.280 --> 03:47:31.880]  look it's about
[03:47:31.880 --> 03:47:35.160]  precious metal gold and silver i strongly advocate
[03:47:35.160 --> 03:47:39.480]  investing in that and having tangible not so not a credit slip not
[03:47:39.480 --> 03:47:42.760]  not a certificate we're talking tangible gold and silver that's why that's
[03:47:42.760 --> 03:47:45.640]  what i recommend well that's what the kings and queens did is what the elites
[03:47:45.640 --> 03:47:47.000]  do is what pirates do
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:49.640]  there's nothing like holding it you know in your hand
[03:47:49.640 --> 03:47:54.520]  uh... let's go ahead and talk to debon in texas you're on the air worldwide

[03:49:19.960 --> 03:49:23.240]  the other two uh... what happened is they put them up for sale two weeks ago
[03:49:23.240 --> 03:49:25.320]  and then if they don't get sales
[03:49:25.320 --> 03:49:28.280]  uh... they just ordered a limited amount to ship it it was accepted all our
[03:49:28.280 --> 03:49:29.880]  films are basically accepted
[03:49:29.880 --> 03:49:32.560]  the netflix we just shipped them out last week so you should be getting them

[03:49:36.080 --> 03:49:39.000]  and uh... so what they do is they post it and then you know they see if there's
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:41.120]  a response and if they basically get one order
[03:49:41.120 --> 03:49:42.680]  then they order that from you
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:45.160]  and so they've ordered it and they've got it and should be shipping out to you
[03:49:45.160 --> 03:49:48.360]  netflix is one of the highest ratings out there for customer service
[03:49:48.360 --> 03:49:52.120]  uh... so uh... we're selling videos to them but i think there's that start off
[03:49:52.120 --> 03:49:54.440]  process where there's a few week lag time

[03:50:12.080 --> 03:50:13.400]  david rockefeller

[03:50:36.180 --> 03:50:36.960]  bring about
[03:50:36.960 --> 03:50:40.400]  what they want they want to round us up they want to shut us down
[03:50:40.400 --> 03:50:43.640]  and and they want total police state lockdown and that
[03:50:43.640 --> 03:50:46.680]  violence is what will accomplish that goal
[03:50:46.680 --> 03:50:49.800]  plus it's not one globalist that runs the new world order it's a criminal
[03:50:49.800 --> 03:50:53.040]  system we want david rockefeller to have a trial
[03:50:53.040 --> 03:50:56.200]  we want him to have all the rights that citizens have because if one person

[03:55:40.720 --> 03:55:44.080]  hey alice uh... i just want to say one quick statement here
[03:55:44.080 --> 03:55:47.760]  i agree with most of what you say but i disagree with one major fact that you
[03:55:47.760 --> 03:55:48.960]  keep telling people
[03:55:48.960 --> 03:55:52.080]  and that is this unconstitutional bill rights position
[03:55:52.080 --> 03:55:55.120]  you have to look at this from a legal perspective
[03:55:55.120 --> 03:55:58.000]  most americans and canadians for that matter
[03:55:58.000 --> 03:56:02.640]  are benefit beneficiaries to state beneficiaries federal beneficiary
[03:56:02.640 --> 03:56:06.560]  programs i can't hire you alex and say come cut my
[03:56:06.560 --> 03:56:09.760]  grass i'm going to pay you for that and for you to make a constitutional
[03:56:09.760 --> 03:56:12.720]  challenge or bill rights shown that you're a slave
[03:56:12.720 --> 03:56:16.400]  most people are receiving benefits and they cannot make an argument
[03:56:16.400 --> 03:56:19.120]  subsequently after that they don't want to have to pay
[03:56:19.120 --> 03:56:22.960]  what to do when they're under contract likewise i don't understand what you're
[03:56:22.960 --> 03:56:26.000]  listening you better simplify it what are you talking about
[03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:29.600]  you say the health care system is unconstitutional
[03:56:29.600 --> 03:56:33.760]  that's a beneficiary program for people who are pursuing profit in commerce as
[03:56:33.760 --> 03:56:37.040]  tax no no the commerce clause that's what's covered in this film
[03:56:37.040 --> 03:56:40.400]  that the federal government in two hundred and thirty five years has never
[03:56:40.400 --> 03:56:44.880]  been involved in health care okay it's unconstitutional up one side and down
[03:56:44.880 --> 03:56:48.240]  the other it was written by the insurance companies man
[03:56:48.240 --> 03:56:51.200]  no i understand they haven't been done but they're doing it through the commerce
[03:56:51.200 --> 03:56:54.800]  clause it was the commerce committee hey hey let me stop you the commerce clause
[03:56:54.800 --> 03:56:57.600]  of the federal government was in texas news last week
[03:56:57.600 --> 03:57:01.200]  had a girl kicked out of school for a week a third grader seven years old
[03:57:01.200 --> 03:57:04.800]  for a jolly rancher in her in her lunch pail
[03:57:04.800 --> 03:57:08.160]  and the federal government told the state of texas no candy
[03:57:08.160 --> 03:57:11.600]  kids can't have one piece of candy the federal government of the commerce
[03:57:11.600 --> 03:57:16.320]  clause has no business what guns i own it has no business what i do with my
[03:57:16.320 --> 03:57:19.760]  property it has no business if my daughter has a stinkin jolly
[03:57:19.760 --> 03:57:22.960]  rancher my man you just oh i'm gonna let you
[03:57:22.960 --> 03:57:25.360]  go you can call back later for a bigger debate we're almost out of time
[03:57:25.360 --> 03:57:29.520]  gary francy comments on that i mean the guys the guys not even an american
[03:57:29.520 --> 03:57:33.760]  the commerce clause is what the federal government uses as their excuse
[03:57:33.760 --> 03:57:37.840]  to reign in the states whenever they feel like it we cover that
[03:57:37.840 --> 03:57:42.800]  exclusively in the stone exclusively in fact that's how the back cover starts
[03:57:42.800 --> 03:57:45.200]  out getting into the commerce clause i mean look
[03:57:45.200 --> 03:57:48.320]  i mean if they can tell kids they can't have a jolly rancher
[03:57:48.320 --> 03:57:51.760]  or through the commerce clause or the mcdonald's can't give people
[03:57:51.760 --> 03:57:54.320]  uh happy meal toys it's not what the founders intended
[03:57:54.320 --> 03:57:57.920]  alex it's not what the founders intended you know that they they didn't
[03:57:57.920 --> 03:58:01.760]  they just didn't want terrorists to trade between the states
[03:58:01.760 --> 03:58:05.040]  you know that's what they they didn't want that and they're not gonna
[03:58:05.040 --> 03:58:09.040]  regulating the firearms and jolly ranchers this is news to me that's just
[03:58:09.040 --> 03:58:12.080]  absolutely ludicrous oh no state of texas was told by the
[03:58:12.080 --> 03:58:15.440]  commerce department no jolly ranchers that that was mainstream news
