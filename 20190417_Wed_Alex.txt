[00:00.000 --> 00:18.640]  It's Wednesday, April 17th, 2019, and I am loaded for bear today.
[00:18.640 --> 00:22.760]  There's so much we're going to get to on the other side of this first break.
[00:22.760 --> 00:27.160]  But what I want to roll first is part of a powerful Mark Dice report.
[00:27.160 --> 00:33.560]  It's posted up on infowars.com, newswars.com, and of course markdice.com, because it just lays out
[00:33.560 --> 00:39.880]  the way he does it. It is so perfect. The insane hypocrisy of saying flood our borders with billions
[00:39.880 --> 00:45.160]  of people, potentially the UN wants 600 million to migrate to the US in the next 20 years,
[00:45.960 --> 00:50.280]  let them overrun everything, but then don't send them to Democrat cities. Here it is.
[00:50.280 --> 00:56.920]  Since the Democrat policies are enabling an estimated 100,000 illegal aliens to continue
[00:56.920 --> 01:03.000]  flooding across the border every single month, President Trump has proposed busing them into
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.600]  the heart of sanctuary cities. Those of course are the Democrat controlled cities who are
[01:08.600 --> 01:13.720]  willfully violating federal immigration laws. Instead of Democrats being excited about this
[01:13.720 --> 01:19.640]  extra cultural diversity, they're quite upset about it. Here's California Governor Gavin Newsants.
[01:19.640 --> 01:24.360]  California certainly is always saying, Oh, we want more people. And they want more people in
[01:24.360 --> 01:28.120]  their sanctuary cities. Well, we'll give them more people. We can give them a lot. We can give
[01:28.120 --> 01:33.640]  them an unlimited supply. Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom fired back at the president's plan
[01:33.640 --> 01:45.880]  today. It's illegal. It's immoral. It's unethical. It's sophomoric. It's petulant. And it's par for
[01:45.880 --> 01:50.520]  the course. I think it's fair genius. And it's also proved once again that you Democrats are
[01:50.520 --> 01:56.200]  the biggest hypocrites in the world. Not realizing the irony of her idiocy, singers shared, tweeted,
[01:56.200 --> 02:03.320]  quote, I understand helping struggling immigrants, but my city Los Angeles isn't taking care of its
[02:03.320 --> 02:08.520]  own. What about the 50,000 plus citizens who live on the streets? People who live below the poverty
[02:08.520 --> 02:14.760]  line and are hungry? If my state can't take care of its own, many are veterans. How can it take care
[02:14.760 --> 02:19.400]  of more? Well, you're absolutely right, share. It sounds like a great reason why we need to build
[02:19.400 --> 02:25.240]  the wall and stop another million illegal aliens from coming into the USA this year alone. Mr.
[02:25.240 --> 02:30.600]  Potato Head Cory Booker also inadvertently admitted that the sanctuary cities are making
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.840]  American citizens less safe. Do you think this is an empty threat by the president, though, to talk
[02:34.840 --> 02:39.480]  about busing people from the border into these sanctuary cities? He likes to create friction
[02:39.480 --> 02:43.960]  sometimes to jumpstart. He says a Congress that's not active. You say friction. I say he's trying
[02:43.960 --> 02:47.960]  to pit Americans against each other and make us less safe because what you're seeing now. So you
[02:47.960 --> 02:54.920]  take the threat seriously. I take this. He is injecting fear into our country. And so if he
[02:54.920 --> 02:58.600]  was looking to solve a problem, he wouldn't be doing things to divide this country against itself.
[02:59.960 --> 03:04.920]  Beware of anybody that's trying to tell you to be afraid in the strongest country in the world,
[03:04.920 --> 03:08.440]  as opposed to showing our strength and our courage by pulling people together to find
[03:08.440 --> 03:13.000]  common sense solutions to solve this problem. I don't think that exactly came out the way that
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.840]  he was thinking, but he inadvertently admitted the truth that illegal aliens make us less safe.
[03:18.840 --> 03:23.640]  Rumor has it that the one and only Stephen Miller, President Trump's advisor on immigration,
[03:23.640 --> 03:30.520]  may be the genius behind this idea. And so Jerry the Hut Nadler says he may call Stephen to testify
[03:30.520 --> 03:35.400]  in front of Congress because of it. We heard several weeks ago from whistleblowers that this,
[03:35.400 --> 03:40.200]  that that Steve Miller came up with this and probably Steve Miller, who seems to be
[03:40.200 --> 03:44.040]  the boss of everybody on immigration ought to come before Congress and explain some of these
[03:44.040 --> 03:48.680]  policies. It's not like a fantastic idea because I think that Stephen Miller needs more FaceTime
[03:48.680 --> 03:52.760]  in front of the cameras. I'm sure that'll be the most entertaining congressional hearing since
[03:52.760 --> 03:57.640]  Candace Owens mopped the floor with the Democrats just last week. If you're wondering why you don't
[03:57.640 --> 04:02.440]  see him on TV anymore, it's because every time the liberal media interviews him, something like this
[04:02.440 --> 04:07.400]  happens. Do you think tweets like that help or hurt the cause that the president is stable enough
[04:07.400 --> 04:12.280]  for the job? Not only do I think they help it, but I think in the toxic environment that you've
[04:12.280 --> 04:17.240]  created here and CNN and cable news, which is a real crisis of legitimacy for your network.
[04:17.240 --> 04:23.480]  And we saw it, of course, with the extremely fake news you reported about the Don Jr. and WikiLeaks
[04:23.480 --> 04:27.560]  story. There was a huge embarrassment for your network. Stephen, just like the huge embarrassment
[04:27.560 --> 04:31.480]  you had when you got the Comey testimony wrong, Stephen, I'm trying to get you in the President's
[04:31.480 --> 04:37.880]  business. That's good. That's what I did when I was on Pierce Morgan line band, too. They had Prozac ads
[04:37.880 --> 04:41.640]  during the breaks. The insert says it can make you murder people. They're trying to blame the
[04:41.640 --> 04:46.360]  average gun owner. I said, you're the ones pitching deadly drugs that make people psychotic, become
[04:46.360 --> 04:52.440]  homicidal maniac murderers. You're the ones selling suicide mass murder pills. That's what's the big
[04:52.440 --> 04:57.000]  news here, Pierce. Not that the average gun owners to blame for what some other crazy person does.
[04:57.000 --> 05:04.120]  We'll be back. Living in Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[05:04.120 --> 05:09.160]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania States, but a lot of us on the big island rely
[05:09.160 --> 05:15.400]  on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain
[05:15.400 --> 05:21.640]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find
[05:21.640 --> 05:28.360]  out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was
[05:28.360 --> 05:32.600]  that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[05:33.240 --> 05:38.440]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[05:38.440 --> 05:45.720]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out,
[05:45.720 --> 05:51.320]  the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic
[05:51.320 --> 05:57.400]  ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water
[05:57.400 --> 06:01.320]  filtration system will purify it.
[06:07.480 --> 06:11.320]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Sheldon, for example.
[06:11.320 --> 06:19.800]  Alex Jones. The four-way conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[06:26.920 --> 06:27.800]  Alex Jones.
[06:30.840 --> 06:33.240]  Scott. Russian. Scott.
[06:33.240 --> 06:37.880]  Scott. If a war comes to mind.
[06:37.880 --> 07:00.360]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[07:08.760 --> 07:17.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[07:18.120 --> 07:24.360]  It is Wednesday, April 17, 2019. We're going to be live here for the next four hours,
[07:24.360 --> 07:29.160]  the known shroyer, with the war rooms coming on. We have a former heavyweight champion of the world,
[07:29.160 --> 07:35.240]  a fellow that beat Mike Tyson at one time, who's gotten a lot of heat for defending
[07:35.240 --> 07:41.400]  this nation's sovereignty, its borders, and President Trump. And so David Nino Rodriguez,
[07:41.400 --> 07:45.000]  who's a big critic of what's happening on our borders, will be joining this very well-spoken
[07:45.000 --> 07:50.360]  individual coming up in the third hour today. Mike Adams is going to be in during the fourth
[07:50.360 --> 07:58.680]  hour. Leo Zagami is going to be joining us from Europe to break down the latest on what happened
[07:58.680 --> 08:05.640]  with Notre Dame. Let me do this in this segment. I tend to do this a lot. It's one of the big
[08:05.640 --> 08:11.320]  ways I drop the ball is that I'll say, coming up, I'm going to cover something, probably do it at
[08:11.320 --> 08:16.920]  least once a week, and then I forget to do it. Or I shorten it down to like a couple minutes and
[08:16.920 --> 08:24.760]  cover it at the end of the show. The name of the broadcast yesterday was President Trump handing
[08:24.760 --> 08:32.600]  the Internet over to the UN. And by the way, that's not hyperbole. That's happening. And so I have a
[08:32.600 --> 08:36.520]  huge stack of evidence from yesterday's stack. If you guys will pull that out for me, thank you.
[08:37.560 --> 08:41.960]  Now, I want to be clear, I love President Trump. I'm very, very impressed over all what he's done.
[08:41.960 --> 08:46.520]  But it's kind of like if you got 20 doors on a submarine, as I've said, you leave one of them
[08:46.520 --> 08:55.240]  open, you're still going to flood the boat, and it's going to go to the bottom of the ocean.
[08:56.520 --> 09:00.840]  You can take care of your kid, you know, 364 days out of the year, and then one day
[09:00.840 --> 09:07.480]  throw them off a cliff. You're still a murderer. And I really find it hard to believe the president
[09:07.480 --> 09:11.480]  doesn't know what's going on with the handover of the Internet to the UN that started under
[09:11.480 --> 09:16.440]  Obama, that Congress partially stopped, but two thirds of the authority roughly was transferred
[09:16.440 --> 09:23.400]  over, and now they're killing us. And Zuckerberg and others are in the news going, oh, we love
[09:23.400 --> 09:29.560]  the new EU rules, and we love the new UK rules to stop free speech. And even the Washington Post
[09:29.560 --> 09:40.280]  says, why is Zuckerberg embracing censorship? He's embracing the new immunity to spy on us,
[09:40.280 --> 09:46.120]  to sell our data, and to ban everybody's free speech they don't like. They're creating an
[09:46.120 --> 09:51.880]  oligopoly. That's what top researchers, top scientists are saying. Experts that help build
[09:51.880 --> 09:58.360]  the Internet say they're building something that is destroying the Internet, the open and free system.
[09:58.360 --> 10:03.320]  So at the bottom of the hour, the problem is I'm the producer of the show. We have a producer
[10:03.320 --> 10:06.840]  that sets up gas and kind of directs things back there, but I'm the person that calls the shots.
[10:06.840 --> 10:11.400]  So let me just call the shots. I don't have a teleprompter, but we do have a big TV screen where
[10:11.400 --> 10:17.160]  they put messages up for me, like the guest is ready or things like that, or please come out
[10:17.160 --> 10:23.080]  here during the break and sign a document or something. Please put up there at 11.33. You
[10:23.080 --> 10:29.400]  will cover Trump handing over the Internet to the UN. Just put that on screen, because I'm going to
[10:29.400 --> 10:34.520]  get that stack of papers from yesterday, and I'm going to cover that one way or another,
[10:34.520 --> 10:41.240]  because it's absolutely, totally and completely paramount. Now that said, let me tell you what
[10:41.240 --> 10:46.920]  else is coming up. I decided that I wanted to go back and look at Bernie Sanders and his wealth
[10:47.640 --> 10:52.360]  and also his visits to Cuba and Venezuela and his statements, and it was worse than I thought.
[10:53.160 --> 11:02.040]  I found a whole bunch of just horrible authoritarian supporting garbage out of his
[11:02.040 --> 11:09.080]  mouth that we're going to be getting to a little bit later. Now, we're also going to get into a
[11:09.080 --> 11:14.040]  really important story that if this catches on could save millions and millions of lives,
[11:14.040 --> 11:20.920]  not just in this country, but all over the world. Propose new Texas law would demand safety studies
[11:20.920 --> 11:26.360]  for vaccines. And are you kind of hearing the record skip there or the needle go off the record?
[11:26.360 --> 11:33.240]  Or are you hearing like a car crash? Are you hearing sirens and asking what there's no safety
[11:33.240 --> 11:39.960]  studies? It would take nowadays 10 years for aspirin to get approved. Trump cut back on some
[11:39.960 --> 11:44.360]  of the regulations, so it'd take a couple years. It takes cancer drugs a decade to get approved.
[11:44.360 --> 11:49.160]  It takes most drugs a decade to get approved. But wait a minute, vaccines don't get approved.
[11:49.160 --> 11:56.040]  That's right. They don't get approved. And if you understand this, you understand everything
[11:56.040 --> 12:00.680]  about medical tyranny. So I'm going to cover that coming up in the last segment of this hour.
[12:00.680 --> 12:07.160]  Remember Governor Northam. He said, we don't want courts or law enforcement or men involved.
[12:07.160 --> 12:11.560]  We want women with the hospital and the doctors, that means the medical tyranny,
[12:12.360 --> 12:18.360]  to decide whether to resuscitate a child. We keep them comfortable. And then we decide
[12:18.360 --> 12:23.640]  whether to resuscitate. Well, resuscitate means if someone's heart has stopped to artificially
[12:23.640 --> 12:29.800]  started again, to bring back to life. But their definition in bioethics is not the same. It means
[12:29.800 --> 12:34.040]  whether the bioethics decision, it's got to be two doctors who are trying to change that law,
[12:34.600 --> 12:39.240]  used to be a whole board, decide whether life should be viable and whether this person's
[12:39.240 --> 12:46.440]  going to have a good life. Kind of the Spartan thing of, well, the baby, you know, had three arms,
[12:46.440 --> 12:52.120]  so he threw it off a cliff. But this is just, they're deciding, oh, the parents are poor or
[12:52.840 --> 12:58.520]  this baby's got a bunch of matches for organs we need. Then they convinced the drugged up woman
[12:58.520 --> 13:04.520]  that thinks she's just had a third trimester abortion to sign off and they get to keep that
[13:04.520 --> 13:10.200]  baby alive for up to several weeks while they line up all the companies that want to put bids in
[13:10.200 --> 13:19.160]  for the organs. We keep them comfortable. So that ties into this, how they have two different sets
[13:19.160 --> 13:23.080]  of medical systems, two different railroad tracks running side by side. I'm going to give you the
[13:23.080 --> 13:31.240]  big, deep secret that there's a whole other branch of law in medicine now since the Hippocratic Oath was
[13:31.240 --> 13:37.320]  removed and it is the big Rockefeller Bill and Melinda Gates takeover paradigm. So we're going
[13:37.320 --> 13:41.640]  to go to break and come back with the latest on Muslims all over the world, celebrating Notre
[13:41.640 --> 13:47.240]  Dame and even Lou Dobbs and others saying, when I said, before they even knew the cause of the
[13:47.240 --> 13:52.360]  fire and they still don't, before it was even out one hour in while it's a towering inferno.
[13:55.160 --> 13:59.960]  No Muslims, no Islam, no arson, even though French officials say no, actually we're looking at arson.
[14:01.560 --> 14:03.800]  Lou Dobbs takes them to the woodshed coming up.
[14:03.800 --> 14:09.320]  You'll probably get fired from Fox for this. Other Fox hosts won't even allow French officials,
[14:09.320 --> 14:15.480]  Catholic officials to mention it. Now we're going to go to break, come back with all of that. But
[14:15.480 --> 14:20.600]  first, ladies and gentlemen, I want to just say something real slow and real clear because I know
[14:20.600 --> 14:25.320]  you're awesome and I want to sink in. Thank you. If you're a listener or viewer and you've bought
[14:25.320 --> 14:31.320]  books or films or t-shirts or fish oil, the Thai quality or our coffee that's excellent or any of
[14:31.320 --> 14:36.920]  our great products, without you we wouldn't be here. But I want to expand and we don't have the
[14:36.920 --> 14:42.600]  money to expand right now at current sales rates. I got a few tricks up my sleeve, but I really want
[14:42.600 --> 14:46.920]  to expand. I want to add more shows, more reporters. You see our reporters out in the field getting on
[14:46.920 --> 14:53.560]  average about 25 million views a week. That's more viewers than actual CNN broadcast has. I mean,
[14:53.560 --> 14:58.520]  we are fighting hard here. Okay, yours truly has been restricted, but not our crew, not our
[14:58.520 --> 15:04.360]  reporters, not our probes that are out there. They're doing an amazing job. We need funds.
[15:05.400 --> 15:09.880]  We don't need to be on a shoestring budget. So I'm not bitching. I'm saying you want to win this war?
[15:10.440 --> 15:16.040]  I want to win this war. Pony up. You get t-shirts right now. Biggest sale we only do like once a

[18:30.680 --> 18:36.760]  Gilligan's Island, Idri Magini, Dallas, stuff from the 90s, new stuff. Like when the Olympics was on,
[18:36.760 --> 18:40.600]  I didn't know there were 10 channels of Olympics on TV. I mean, it's like, my God,
[18:40.600 --> 18:46.280]  this is way better than cable. And people don't know that it's free after you buy the antenna.
[18:46.280 --> 18:51.720]  The point is, is that there's so many channels and it's not watching you. It's not tracking you.
[18:51.720 --> 18:55.240]  So we do sell the antennas at the lowest price. You'll find them for store.com.
[19:00.280 --> 19:02.680]  Frank in North Carolina. Thanks for holding so long. Go ahead.
[19:03.240 --> 19:07.640]  I just have to say something, man. It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[19:07.640 --> 19:12.200]  you're bragging. It just gets old, man. I'm going to shut you down right now. Okay.
[19:12.840 --> 19:17.320]  We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you understand they're having congressional
[19:17.320 --> 19:22.920]  hearings trying to shut us down? Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm? If that was
[19:22.920 --> 19:27.640]  happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out. I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[19:27.640 --> 19:32.360]  Is that what you want, Frank? You know what, Alex? I put him on pause again. Hey, Frank,
[19:32.360 --> 19:37.080]  do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear? We're under attack.
[19:37.080 --> 19:42.200]  We need your help. As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of
[19:42.200 --> 19:46.120]  this. I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards. You understand?
[19:46.120 --> 19:54.040]  I need your help, Frank. I need your help, Frank. Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund
[19:54.040 --> 19:59.480]  the info. Do you understand? I need your help, Frank. Free press needs your help, Frank.
[20:03.640 --> 20:06.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:06.360 --> 20:18.600]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[20:18.600 --> 20:24.680]  so does he. Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:24.680 --> 20:39.960]  The great one, the Motor City Madman. Now a transplant to Texas and he's welcome.
[20:40.680 --> 20:45.960]  The great Ted Nugent bringing us in. Okay, let's get right into it.
[20:45.960 --> 20:54.760]  Within 30 minutes of the Notre Dame being on fire, we were covering it when that blaze started
[20:56.440 --> 21:07.480]  on Monday. And when I was first watching CNN and Fox News that we have on on TVs out there
[21:07.480 --> 21:13.560]  and turn the audio up, both channels were saying it's not arson and it's not terrorist.
[21:13.560 --> 21:18.920]  This happened the day after Palm Sunday. The whole week of Easter is when the
[21:18.920 --> 21:24.040]  Islamists burn up and bomb and shoot up churches. I said just a month ago with the Christ Church
[21:25.400 --> 21:31.640]  attack in New Zealand, I said look for them starting Palm Sunday, the Islamists through
[21:32.840 --> 21:37.480]  Easter to blow up and burn a bunch of churches. They always do. And they had media manners and
[21:37.480 --> 21:44.200]  the Daily Beast and mainstream news saying Jones is so horrible, he says Muslims are going to attack
[21:45.240 --> 21:52.600]  this Easter week. Well, that's like saying people put up Christmas trees in December in the US.
[21:53.320 --> 21:58.680]  Christians put up Christmas trees, Muslims go out and blow up churches and shoot people up. I mean,
[21:58.680 --> 22:02.680]  they run over people with trucks. They trim all the hot bar and stab women and children.
[22:02.680 --> 22:11.480]  You know that. Stop pretending that's not reality. You lying left a scum. And so within an hour of
[22:11.480 --> 22:19.080]  the fire starting 30 minutes of news coverage, I'm watching the news and they're saying no arson,
[22:21.080 --> 22:25.960]  no Islam, no terror. And I just sat back and then I actually went to the fine print. It's like
[22:25.960 --> 22:29.800]  authorities don't know what caused it. They won't know till the fire is out and they get it into
[22:29.800 --> 22:35.320]  an investigation. They don't know. I played yesterday Fox News going, well, from Paris,
[22:35.320 --> 22:38.600]  we don't know and they don't know who did it. There'll be an investigation starting in the
[22:38.600 --> 22:43.320]  next few days. It may take months to decide the cause, but it's not terrorism and it's not arson.
[22:44.520 --> 22:49.080]  Like a coroner. Well, the body's not even cold yet, but it's not murder, but we haven't done any
[22:49.080 --> 22:55.880]  tests yet. So we don't know. It's oxymoronic. What the media is telling you is you're not
[22:55.880 --> 22:59.720]  going to say this is terror and you're not going to say this is arson. I don't know if it was
[22:59.720 --> 23:05.560]  Muslims. Probably is. I don't know if it was arson or but I mean, that's what everything points
[23:05.560 --> 23:09.640]  towards. It's been a terrorist target. ISIS was bragging a week ago how they were going to blow
[23:09.640 --> 23:13.560]  it up or burn it up. They're praising it. Muslims are praising it all over the place.
[23:13.560 --> 23:22.760]  Prominent Muslims are. But they politically make the statement that you will not question
[23:22.760 --> 23:29.560]  one of the top Christian monuments in the world. I'd say like the third most important monument
[23:29.560 --> 23:37.880]  after. What? Golgotha? Where Christ was crucified or what? The Vatican?
[23:40.040 --> 23:45.560]  I mean, what else? I mean, Notre Dame's 900 years old. It's a beautiful giant church. It's
[23:45.560 --> 23:52.360]  filled with all these icons. And the thing goes up like a Christmas tree lit on fire and we're
[23:52.360 --> 23:57.000]  not supposed to ask questions. What world do we live in? We're Shep Smith and Neil Caputo.
[23:57.000 --> 24:03.720]  They're now the police dogs. The enforcers cannot ask that question. So, you know, it's super
[24:03.720 --> 24:10.680]  suspicious. I mean, the thing is the biggest target in France for Islamists. And within 30
[24:10.680 --> 24:15.080]  minutes of the thing being on fire, we're told we don't know why it's on fire. But don't say it's
[24:15.080 --> 24:19.160]  Muslims and French officials going and saying, no, we think it's Islam. We've had 800 plus churches
[24:19.160 --> 24:25.320]  firebomb last well months and they go, well, you can't say that you're off air. But on Fox Business,
[24:25.320 --> 24:29.960]  Lou Dobbs, who got fired from singing in for being number one and not telling the line,
[24:29.960 --> 24:31.720]  he tells it like it is. Here it is.
[24:33.000 --> 24:40.680]  Thing authorities are ruling out. However, within just a matter of hours, Arson, perhaps overlooked
[24:40.680 --> 24:51.080]  since yesterday is that 875 Catholic churches in France were vandalized in 2018. 875. In a single
[24:51.080 --> 24:58.840]  week last month, 12 churches were vandalized, including a fire deliberately set and also
[24:58.840 --> 25:07.080]  located in Paris. This is context. This is not speculation. This is the situation right now
[25:07.080 --> 25:15.160]  in France and and the recent history of what has happened to Catholic churches throughout the nation
[25:15.160 --> 25:22.920]  ignored too often by some covering the tragedy. Some who have ruled out speculation about the
[25:22.920 --> 25:31.240]  cause of the Notre Dame fire as they speculate, taking it as gospel that well, Arson was not
[25:31.240 --> 25:36.200]  the cause. That was a decision made within hours. It sounds like a different kind of decision,
[25:36.200 --> 25:42.760]  perhaps a political decision rather than one based on careful investigation of the facts.
[25:42.760 --> 25:47.720]  No kidding. It violates French law and common law and our law to just say before a fire is out,
[25:47.720 --> 25:52.200]  you know what caused it when you don't know. Very suspicious. The default is it was Islamic
[25:52.200 --> 25:56.600]  terror. Now we have to say that the cover up is clear, cover up as many times evidence of the
[25:56.600 --> 26:01.000]  crime itself. Here's Tucker Carlson making a great point. I don't think he's joking.
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.960]  We'll be taught within a generation or so that white supremacist
[26:03.960 --> 26:13.000]  attack this on 9 11 not globalist inspired and funded Islamist. Here's Tucker Carlson. In 1992,
[26:13.000 --> 26:17.800]  Ilhan Omar came to this country from a refugee camp in East Africa, Kenya. Three years later,
[26:17.800 --> 26:22.440]  she and her family applied for and received refugee status in the United States. Five years
[26:22.440 --> 26:26.760]  after that, she became a US citizen and she's been attacking the United States as a racist hell
[26:26.760 --> 26:31.480]  hole pretty much ever since. According to Omar, there's barely a difference between this country
[26:31.480 --> 26:37.000]  and terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. In a 2013 interview, Omar complained that people seem
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.360]  to think there was a big difference between America and Al Qaeda. Watch. When I was in college,
[26:42.360 --> 26:50.520]  I took a terrorism class. Every time the professor said Al Qaeda, he sort of like his shoulders went
[26:50.520 --> 26:57.800]  up and you know, Al Qaeda, you know, you don't say America with an intensity. You don't say
[26:57.800 --> 27:03.160]  England with an intensity. Hey, pause. I don't want to listen to the pig. Just fast forward to the end
[27:03.160 --> 27:09.640]  where he makes the key point. But why do you want to live here, you ugly, stupid pig?
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.640]  And I mean, your soul is ugly. You get run out of your own country, Somalia, where women are lower
[27:17.640 --> 27:25.000]  than slaves, lower than dogs. You go to Kenya that saved your ass that Islam's trying to crush right
[27:25.000 --> 27:32.040]  now. And then you come here to piss in our face constantly and tell us how much we suck. No,
[27:32.040 --> 27:38.920]  you suck dirtbag. Go back to your filthy rat hole. Go back to your, you know what hole and get off
[27:38.920 --> 27:43.800]  our back. You want to come from Africa and embrace America and love it. We love you. You want to piss
[27:43.800 --> 27:48.280]  in our face, go to hell. By the way, a African immigrant who's here legally wearing a mega hat
[27:48.280 --> 27:52.200]  just got beaten half to death in Maryland. We've got that article up on infowars.com.
[27:52.200 --> 27:56.280]  Sorry, let's go back to the end of this clip. Here it is.
[27:57.640 --> 28:04.280]  I swear, in 20 years, every fifth grader will believe 9-11 was committed by white supremacists.
[28:04.280 --> 28:08.920]  Totally true. You watch. You heard it here first. They're the real threat. We need to fear and
[28:08.920 --> 28:13.640]  suppress them. And that's what Booker's saying. And to prove it, he and so many demagogues in
[28:13.640 --> 28:17.640]  the left are forever telling us about the epidemic of hate crimes in this country. But
[28:17.640 --> 28:21.160]  they're lying. There is no epidemic of hate crimes. We check we know what the numbers are.
[28:21.160 --> 28:25.320]  We check for California, the biggest state, the most liberal state. Here are the numbers.
[28:25.320 --> 28:28.280]  And let's stop right there. We're going to get to this later. I got to get to the big Trump story,
[28:28.280 --> 28:32.760]  but they've created new hate crimes. They've created new reporting agencies. Right wingers
[28:32.760 --> 28:36.840]  don't report this stuff. So Tucker's actually wrong in a way. Hate crimes against conservatives
[28:36.840 --> 28:40.840]  and nationalists and Christians that you and admits are at record levels all over the world.
[28:41.480 --> 28:45.160]  We just showed you all the churches getting burned down. Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen,

[32:03.480 --> 32:10.280]  censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most
[32:10.280 --> 32:18.120]  buried, the most suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night
[32:18.120 --> 32:23.800]  all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt-hurt when
[32:23.800 --> 32:29.720]  Trump won. They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political
[32:29.720 --> 32:35.880]  action did and that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[32:35.880 --> 32:41.960]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty
[32:41.960 --> 32:47.400]  away. This country is in a war so again I want to thank you for what you've done but I want to
[32:47.400 --> 32:51.400]  remind you if you don't spread the articles and videos and if you don't financially get the great
[32:51.400 --> 32:56.280]  products we have and fund us and the 360 win, we're dead in the water. I'm in your hands,
[32:56.280 --> 32:59.080]  you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com. Thank you.
[32:59.080 --> 33:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:15.000 --> 33:28.120]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[33:37.720 --> 33:42.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is the verboten broadcast for a reason. We'll tell the truth,
[33:42.600 --> 33:47.880]  no matter how hard and let the chips fall where they may.
[33:49.400 --> 33:54.920]  Did you know that President Trump is engaging in treason? Did you know that President Trump is
[33:54.920 --> 34:04.040]  selling out America, the West, our sovereignty, the Renaissance and the great hope we have to try
[34:04.040 --> 34:08.280]  to lead the planet in a good direction towards a pro-human future that goes beyond the stars?
[34:08.280 --> 34:15.080]  That's right. President Trump is dealing a death blow to not just our country but to free peoples
[34:15.080 --> 34:26.760]  all over the world. President Trump is allowing the destruction of the Internet. In fact, even
[34:26.760 --> 34:31.880]  Mainline News says this will kill the open and free Internet as we know it. I'm going to show you
[34:31.880 --> 34:36.520]  news articles admitting that. I'm going to show you even the head EU bureaucrats admitting it.
[34:36.520 --> 34:40.280]  I'm going to show you Russia talking about it. I'm going to show you the inventor of the Internet
[34:40.280 --> 34:44.680]  talking about it. Now, I want to be clear. I'm not going to sit here and give Trump a bunch of
[34:44.680 --> 34:49.640]  accolades about the great job he's done on 100 fronts. That's good. And I believe Trump means
[34:49.640 --> 34:57.560]  well and has incredible stamina and is amazing. But that's it. Yeah, he signed an executive order
[34:57.560 --> 35:04.280]  a few weeks ago to cut and drive the campuses, the state-funded colleges, public-funded colleges.
[35:04.280 --> 35:08.760]  They're not allowed to discriminate against speech or politics or race or anything. And Trump says
[35:09.720 --> 35:15.240]  we're going to strip your federal funds if you do that. That's good. But let me tell you something.
[35:16.520 --> 35:22.760]  I've been watching this. I've been tracking this, Mr. President. And if you don't do this,
[35:22.760 --> 35:28.360]  everything else goes out with the bathwater. Remember four years ago, seven days before
[35:28.360 --> 35:37.240]  Obama gives away the Internet and national security. That's Forbes. Now, they didn't give total control
[35:37.240 --> 35:43.400]  of ICANN and the domain names and the registries to the UN, but they gave partial control. They made
[35:43.400 --> 35:47.720]  a deal. So see, does Trump know this is happening? Probably not.
[35:50.680 --> 35:55.880]  But see, the deal was made and now they're just going along with the original deal,
[35:55.880 --> 36:00.520]  even though the U.S. didn't completely sign onto it. If you go back and review the deal
[36:00.520 --> 36:07.400]  Obama had four or five years ago, it's the exact plan. And that's why we come
[36:11.240 --> 36:18.360]  to these articles. Why is Zuckerberg, Bloomberg asked, Reuters asked, Washington Post even asked,
[36:19.640 --> 36:25.640]  why is Zuckerberg so relaxed about U.K. online speech rules? And it goes on to say it's going
[36:25.640 --> 36:31.000]  to end free speech, but it's going to give him monopoly control. It's going to give him liability
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.600]  control. He doesn't need section 230 anymore to say he's not a publisher. He can be a publisher
[36:36.600 --> 36:41.400]  and control content and be given liability protection, something all the thousands of
[36:41.400 --> 36:45.320]  newspapers and TV stations, including in full wars, won't have, but he'll have.
[36:47.000 --> 36:53.400]  This is big tech eating journalism. That's even in a headline today. From the establishment is,
[36:53.400 --> 37:01.880]  why are newspapers and TV stations letting big tech eat them? Why is Trump allowing that?
[37:02.440 --> 37:07.880]  Because of the lobbyist and the complexity. And when Trump gets something, he understands it
[37:07.880 --> 37:12.360]  and does the right thing. Like our borders are wide open, 100,000 people every few weeks are coming
[37:12.360 --> 37:16.200]  in. A lot of them are criminals. They're being shipped to mainly red states, turn them blue.
[37:16.920 --> 37:21.400]  Just to make the Democrats stop, ship those people because we don't have any courts left.
[37:21.400 --> 37:24.520]  They're overwhelmed or any jails. That's why people, why is Trump releasing them?
[37:25.160 --> 37:27.480]  Don't have the money. Don't have the funding. Don't have the law.
[37:30.200 --> 37:34.200]  Unless he becomes really the commander-in-chief, he can still do something. Not that other emergency
[37:34.200 --> 37:38.200]  did. It was just a law enforcement emergency, but a real national emergency. You could, but
[37:38.200 --> 37:43.800]  so far he hasn't. And so the courts are ordering them released. Well, let's release them in Cory
[37:43.800 --> 37:50.840]  Booker's district or in California with Governor Newsom. Oh, they're like, oh, that's dangerous.
[37:50.840 --> 37:55.000]  Don't do that. My God, that's terrible. We can't take all these people. Oh, really?
[37:56.040 --> 37:59.000]  But they're coming into the country. You just don't want them targeting you.
[38:00.440 --> 38:07.560]  So I get what Trump's doing, but on this subject, why is Zuckerberg so relaxed?
[38:07.560 --> 38:12.360]  Because Big Tech wrote these rules with the EU. They're like, oh, don't throw me in that briar
[38:12.360 --> 38:18.120]  patch, Merkel. Oh, don't throw me in that briar patch, Theresa May. Oh, don't throw me in that
[38:18.120 --> 38:26.440]  briar patch, Macron. Don't throw me in that briar patch when it's exactly what they want,
[38:26.440 --> 38:31.720]  a merger of Big Tech with governments and others to be the filters and the arbiters
[38:31.720 --> 38:36.360]  of anything and everything that can be done. And it's extra judicial. It's extra lawful.
[38:36.360 --> 38:42.040]  And it's usurping due process. It's usurping the courts. It's usurping everything.
[38:42.040 --> 38:49.240]  And that's what we're seeing in this age of big corporations is take the medical cartel,
[38:49.240 --> 38:52.440]  a lot of great doctors, a lot of great medical breakthroughs, but the corporation's running
[38:52.440 --> 38:58.120]  at one total power. So they got laws passed in the 80s that vaccines don't have to get approved
[38:58.120 --> 39:02.040]  and have no liability and are immune. And so they become nightmarishly poisoned and bad.
[39:04.120 --> 39:08.440]  And it's just like governors all over are passing laws where you can keep a baby alive
[39:08.440 --> 39:12.360]  after it's born and sell its organs because we're saying the baby doesn't count. We're not counting
[39:12.360 --> 39:19.880]  him as alive and some legalese. It's all legalese. So Big Tech's in a power grab. Medical systems
[39:19.880 --> 39:25.720]  are in a power grab. Why is Zuckerberg so relaxed about UK speech online? And you read it. It's
[39:25.720 --> 39:30.600]  because he's been given liability protection for a total takeover. Europe looks to remold internet
[39:30.600 --> 39:35.480]  with new copyright rules or even linking to a story. Is he legal? Memes are illegal.
[39:35.480 --> 39:40.200]  Everything must be pre-approved through Big Tech filters. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait for it.
[39:41.160 --> 39:49.640]  By the Big Five media social networks, they are the filters that decide through government agreement
[39:49.640 --> 39:54.200]  and through government and Southern Property Law Center and media matters interface,
[39:54.200 --> 40:00.280]  they will decide what can go out and what can't. Not just on the big platforms, but on your own
[40:00.280 --> 40:10.680]  website. What did a famous conservative say to Matt Drudge three years ago that made him come
[40:10.680 --> 40:15.480]  to this office and warn you right in the studio? He said it's over. They plan to use copyright in the
[40:15.480 --> 40:20.600]  EU to regulate the internet. And because our government won't regulate it, it creates a vacuum
[40:20.600 --> 40:24.600]  and the EU will regulate it. That's what I keep saying. Mr. President, you're a nationalist,
[40:24.600 --> 40:29.880]  a constitutionalist, a free market purist. I get it. So am I. But if you're a country of 330
[40:29.880 --> 40:37.960]  million next to the EU and others even more in China of a billion 500 million and they're expressing
[40:37.960 --> 40:43.960]  authoritarian control over the internet here and over companies here and making them adopt their
[40:43.960 --> 40:49.960]  systems of control and censorship and arresting dissidents, if you don't come in and prohibit
[40:49.960 --> 40:56.920]  and say you're not going to do that, then it lets those companies standardize that. So again,
[40:56.920 --> 41:04.440]  by standing down by the abdication that's taking place, we're allowing that vacuum that's bringing
[41:04.440 --> 41:12.120]  this in. Here it is. German data privacy commissioner says article 13 inevitably leads to filters
[41:12.120 --> 41:16.200]  which inevitably lead to internet oligopoly, a handful of corporations controlling all
[41:16.200 --> 41:24.280]  information as the filter for government. That's all this is, is big tech being pecked on the head
[41:24.280 --> 41:32.200]  by big government to merge with them in total control. And Zuckerberg is up there ready to get
[41:32.200 --> 41:39.240]  married right now. Who's pitching? Who's catching? I think Zuckerberg's catching, folks. Republicans
[41:39.240 --> 41:42.840]  say Obama administration is giving away the internet. Remember that way back then? Well,
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.080]  that's what President Trump's doing. So do I want to get the president's attention? You're right. I do.
[41:47.800 --> 41:51.400]  This is a live feed. We're going to post this video later at infowars.com.
[41:51.400 --> 41:57.480]  Treason? Question mark? Does President Trump know he's handing control of the internet over to the
[41:57.480 --> 42:08.040]  EU, the UN and China? Because it's really happening and it's all here for everyone to see. It's all
[42:08.040 --> 42:12.760]  confirmed and all the censorship. Remember Zuckerberg two years ago? It's been a hot mic with Merkel
[42:13.800 --> 42:18.040]  of Germany. He says, I don't like people criticizing open borders and Islamic invasion. He goes,
[42:18.040 --> 42:23.240]  relax. We're going to fix that soon. And we know what the fix is. We've seen it. We know what this
[42:23.240 --> 42:29.320]  tyranny looks like. So we have to put pressure on Trump and talk radio and c-span and members of
[42:29.320 --> 42:33.960]  Congress to say, you understand, we get, you can have judges argue all day that our government
[42:33.960 --> 42:38.440]  can't regulate the internet. But if the internet's becoming a regulator for the Chai comms and the
[42:38.440 --> 42:43.480]  UN and the EU and radical Islam and working with all these Islamic countries to arrest Christians
[42:43.480 --> 42:48.680]  and kill them, you're damn right we've got a stake because these big tech companies have become cartels
[42:48.680 --> 42:55.240]  of any mafia that'll pay them that they work for and intelligence crises and national security
[42:55.240 --> 43:01.640]  threats to not just a country, but to the people of the planet. Fueling your body is hard work.

[44:00.040 --> 44:04.920]  I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is. But if you took it
[44:04.920 --> 44:11.160]  with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than it. And that's an example
[44:11.160 --> 44:17.240]  of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best
[44:17.240 --> 44:21.400]  out there. You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil. If you're
[44:21.400 --> 44:24.920]  going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong. They don't give
[44:24.920 --> 44:29.320]  you the burpees, but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm just sorry,
[44:29.320 --> 44:33.240]  you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic,
[44:33.240 --> 44:36.520]  it's so good. In my view, I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[44:36.520 --> 44:41.160]  I eat five capillots of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[44:42.840 --> 44:47.560]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[44:50.360 --> 44:54.440]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best
[44:54.440 --> 44:57.240]  is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[44:57.240 --> 45:04.840]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[45:04.840 --> 45:09.480]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk. Believe me,
[45:09.480 --> 45:14.840]  I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[45:14.840 --> 45:21.320]  But thanks to supermail vitality at infowarstore.com, I still have that energy. There's no way I could

[46:58.040 --> 47:11.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:11.880 --> 47:25.720]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[47:25.720 --> 47:37.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:38.120 --> 47:46.920]  Bertrand Russell won the highest globalist awards you can win. Bertrand Russell won with
[47:46.920 --> 47:55.800]  H.G. Wells called for a world government to be enacted by about 1905 to create atomic weapons
[47:56.840 --> 48:04.600]  to go out and nuke the nation states of the world flying giant black stealth bombers.
[48:08.200 --> 48:13.880]  You're right, none of this had been publicly invented yet and that they would have a nuclear
[48:13.880 --> 48:20.040]  war, an atomic war to bring in world peace. But then you read later, oh, they wanted a League
[48:20.040 --> 48:25.480]  of Nations, they wanted a UN, they wanted a crisis, a threat of world war, a threat
[48:25.480 --> 48:34.200]  of the end of the world so that we would accept their rule. And who was funding Bertrand Russell,
[48:34.200 --> 48:40.840]  the fake liberal, the British royal family that's really the German royal family that's really
[48:40.840 --> 48:49.480]  the Truncel Venue in the world family. And if you don't believe me, just look everything up,
[48:49.480 --> 48:57.880]  I said, things to come, H.G. Wells and an accompanying film. They made this film in the 30s
[48:57.880 --> 49:01.960]  that shows giant stealth bombers that looked just like the stealth bombers they were,
[49:01.960 --> 49:08.360]  they declassified in the 80s, dropping atomic bombs on cities to make nation states submit
[49:08.360 --> 49:14.040]  to Lucifer. Now, why do I raise that? Because anybody listening can search
[49:14.040 --> 49:16.440]  engine that and find mainline documents admitting it.
[49:23.480 --> 49:27.720]  By the way, the globalist warship people like H.G. Wells and Bertrand Russell so much
[49:28.280 --> 49:32.440]  that in the off record conversations I've had with top directors, top producers that try to get me to
[49:32.440 --> 49:39.640]  sell out and top media owners try to get me sell out years ago. They haven't tried many years.
[49:41.240 --> 49:47.000]  And they go, oh, you read Bertrand Russell. Oh, you read. Did you read all the nonfiction?
[49:47.000 --> 49:53.000]  Oh, well, then you know it's what needs to be done. Like just the fact that you read that shows
[49:53.000 --> 50:02.840]  you're one of us. You've read the sacred text. What I've read what Jim Jones wrote or Charlie Manson.
[50:02.840 --> 50:09.800]  You're a crazy person. So what did Bertrand Russell write? This is one of hundreds of quotes I can
[50:09.800 --> 50:21.640]  give you these people, but he said diet, injection and injunction will make the practice of the
[50:21.640 --> 50:28.360]  general population, the proletariat rebelling against the elite as impossible as the practice of
[50:28.360 --> 50:38.360]  sheep revolting against eating mutton. Or sheep rebelling as humans eating sheep. Sheep don't know.
[50:39.800 --> 50:41.320]  Diet, what they're going to feed us.
[50:44.760 --> 50:46.440]  Injections, the vaccines.
[50:46.440 --> 50:56.840]  Diet, injections and injunctions. He wrote a book. I bought the book. I forget the name. You can pull
[50:56.840 --> 51:00.600]  up his quote though. Having Bertrand Russell diet, injection, injunctions. They get the name of the
[51:00.600 --> 51:06.360]  book. I read it like 25 years ago. I forget the name. It's a little book, but it's all his psychotic
[51:06.360 --> 51:10.920]  stuff. Like we'll use atomic bombs. We'll depopulate the planet. We'll do this for the betterment
[51:10.920 --> 51:18.680]  of the left. And the reason I raise all that to you before I hit this news. There it is, 1953.
[51:18.680 --> 51:23.880]  But he wrote it before that. Scientific societies are yet their infancy. It is to be expected that
[51:23.880 --> 51:31.400]  advances in physiology, psychological, will give governments much more control over individual
[51:31.400 --> 51:34.120]  mentality than they have even in totalitarian countries.
[51:34.120 --> 51:40.840]  Layed down educations could aim to destroy free will so that after peoples have left school,
[51:40.840 --> 51:45.720]  they shall be incapable to have the rest of their lives of thinking or acting otherwise than in
[51:45.720 --> 51:51.400]  their school masters would have wished. Diet, injections and injunctions will continue from a
[51:51.400 --> 51:56.280]  very early age to produce the sort of character, the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider
[51:56.280 --> 52:03.080]  desirable. Any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible.
[52:03.080 --> 52:07.640]  Yeah, you found another quote. Like I said, there's multiple quotes from what he said, but what book
[52:07.640 --> 52:11.560]  does it say that's from? Because I've read it in a book with his name on it, but it doesn't matter.
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.320]  That's the scientific manipulation of our reality,
[52:17.320 --> 52:23.960]  53, which is a recodification by the daughter in you, Genesis Nazi, before he died.
[52:23.960 --> 52:29.000]  But I digress. Yeah, that's just when he was already in a hospice, people re-editing what he'd
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.680]  already said before, as I told you. Now, let's move on to the enemy's operations, maybe.
[52:38.120 --> 52:43.640]  Texas, as usual, still has that spirit despite the fact that we're close to collapse and under
[52:43.640 --> 52:48.840]  enemy attack and being flooded by all the vagabonds and vandals of the collapsed left.
[52:49.560 --> 52:54.280]  We're still holding on, I guess, but barely. And I only say that not to lower your spirits,
[52:54.280 --> 53:01.800]  but to raise them to save the state. As goes Texas, so goes the nation. Propose new taxes would demand.
[53:10.520 --> 53:13.800]  You guys go ahead and print me some of those news articles on this, because what I'm going to do is
[53:14.920 --> 53:19.720]  I'm going to go ahead and move this to the next hour because I want to properly cover all this.
[53:19.720 --> 53:27.800]  And then we'll get Leo Zagami on a little bit of after that. But it was in mainstream news
[53:27.800 --> 53:40.040]  two weeks ago. And it's a big deal. It's not just on M4s.com for natural news. It's
[53:40.040 --> 53:52.200]  all over the news here in Texas that they've introduced a bill where vaccines actually
[53:52.200 --> 53:59.720]  have to be tested for safety. Oh, no, they're not tested for safety. They're tested for attacking
[53:59.720 --> 54:07.160]  your cerebral cortex with autoimmune responses that lower your IQ and make you a physical
[54:07.160 --> 54:11.240]  invalid for the rest of your life. But that's only the beginning. Under the rubric of the
[54:11.240 --> 54:18.280]  term vaccines, they're putting live viruses, live bacteria, nanotech, adjuvants in the body.
[54:20.120 --> 54:24.920]  So propose new Texas law would demand safety studies for vaccines.
[54:27.880 --> 54:33.160]  No wonder the entire vaccine industry opposes it. Now, you're probably thinking, wait, all drugs.
[54:33.160 --> 54:38.120]  I mean, it takes a decade to get a drug approved. Certainly a vaccine is approved. Oh, no. It's
[54:38.120 --> 54:43.400]  announced by a state governor or by the president or by the federal government to be an emergency
[54:44.600 --> 54:51.560]  going back to polio. And then it's triggered to give untested liability protected vaccines that
[54:51.560 --> 54:56.920]  have cancer viruses like SV 40, you name it, embedded in them by design.
[54:56.920 --> 55:05.800]  So we have the Democrats openly trying to make it forced inoculation nationwide.
[55:05.800 --> 55:09.960]  They're using beta tests in places like New York City to go target the orthodox Jews
[55:09.960 --> 55:16.360]  and make them take shots. So in America in 2019, orthodox Jews are being forcibly injected by
[55:16.360 --> 55:22.520]  governments at the behest of big pharma makers who have liability protection and who do no safety
[55:22.520 --> 55:29.320]  testing by companies like Bayer that now owns Monsanto when Bayer literally was the main Nazi
[55:29.320 --> 55:34.120]  company. So I'm gonna say it again, Jews are being forcibly injected in New York City
[55:35.880 --> 55:42.520]  by the pharmaceutical companies that ran Hitler's operation. You can't make that up. It's why I get
[55:42.520 --> 55:48.600]  show up chat. But if you read the fine print in New York or California, they admit illegal aliens
[55:48.600 --> 55:52.920]  are bringing in the measles, mumps, rubella and people that have been inoculated are getting it.
[55:52.920 --> 55:59.080]  Oh, so now you need to be forcibly inoculated again with whatever the hell they're secretly
[55:59.080 --> 56:06.600]  putting into the shots. The articles up on infowars.com propose New Texas law would demand
[56:06.600 --> 56:12.040]  safety studies for vaccines because federally they've been given protection and no studies
[56:12.040 --> 56:17.880]  are done. But every other supposed drug is studied but not quote anything that government
[56:17.880 --> 56:26.200]  wants to inject into you. They ship in the illegal aliens, they spread it, then you got to take more
[56:26.200 --> 56:30.760]  shots of experimental secret garbage that has liability protection. But after all,
[56:30.760 --> 56:36.280]  diet, injections and injunctions are going to make you behave like a sheep. So drink your fluoride
[56:36.280 --> 56:41.800]  sheep, eat your GMO sheep, take your deadly vaccine sheep and get ready to have double x's in your
[56:41.800 --> 56:45.640]  eyes and get buried in the ground because it's better for the globalists that you just roll over
[56:45.640 --> 56:50.040]  and die. But we're not doing that, are we? And that's why it's important that listeners take
[56:50.040 --> 56:55.720]  this clip once we post at infowars.com and get it out to everyone they know. Shouldn't these things
[56:55.720 --> 57:00.520]  not have liability protection? Shouldn't they be tested? Shouldn't there be safety studies?
[57:00.520 --> 57:05.080]  Hell, at the store it says on the back of a bottle of shampoo, not tested on animals.
[57:06.120 --> 57:10.760]  But see, they're not testing on animals. They're testing on you and your newborn baby.
[57:10.760 --> 57:15.880]  When your newborn baby dies, they're going to give you some long excuse about why it happened.
[57:15.880 --> 57:19.240]  And the average doctor or nurse is compartmentalized. They don't understand either.
[57:19.240 --> 57:23.640]  That's all part of a larger plan. If you want to hear more of this powerful information that's
[57:23.640 --> 57:29.080]  the globalists absolutely dread, infowarsstore.com. Get Things Mother Nature gave us like DNA Force

[57:49.400 --> 57:54.280]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems,
[57:54.280 --> 57:59.560]  and most of them are funded by the globalist. Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the
[57:59.560 --> 58:03.560]  zeitgeist. That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[58:03.560 --> 58:09.000]  I didn't invent all this. I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.640]  for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back. And lo and behold, it's super popular,
[58:13.640 --> 58:19.000]  like it's always been. That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately,
[58:19.000 --> 58:24.120]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine. So whatever
[58:24.120 --> 58:28.280]  you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars by buying the great products at

[59:58.120 --> 01:00:02.600]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones,
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:11.320]  who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs. I don't know
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:19.320]  what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:30.040]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:35.880]  in the election, and then they began to weaponize them. And they began to have some of their
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:44.920]  allies within the internet world, like Infowars, take out pieces, and began to say the most
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:51.720]  outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine. But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:01:00.920]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:21.560]  After WikiLeaks released the DNC emails, corporate media accused Julian Assange
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:39.720]  of trying to influence an election. After they released the Podesta emails,
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:46.440]  all hell broke loose on the internet. And when President Trump was elected, the
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:53.560]  deep state blamed WikiLeaks and the Russians. Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:02:01.480]  of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off. Julian Assange has denied this.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:16.120]  One month after Ecuador was granted $4.2 billion by the IMF, their embassy in London
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:23.080]  expelled Julian Assange for leaving dirty dishes in the kitchen sink. Assange was charged by the
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:30.680]  United States for conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. While running for president, Donald
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:41.000]  Trump appealed to his base by praising the work of WikiLeaks. But now, President Trump has nothing
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:51.080]  to say about the charges against Julian Assange. Last August, Rand Paul said that Assange should
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:57.240]  be offered immunity and brought to testify about his publication of the Democratic Party documents.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:04.760]  Seth Rich was an employee of the DNC and was murdered just weeks before the DNC emails were
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:12.760]  published. It was reported that he was in contact with WikiLeaks. An investigator now says Seth Rich
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:19.560]  was in contact with WikiLeaks. Not only that, he claims there's been as law enforcement cover-up.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:25.320]  WikiLeaks has hinted in the past that Seth Rich was the source for their DNC emails.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:32.280]  The corporate media have been smearing the name of Julian Assange and ignoring the fact
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.960]  that an actual journalist has been arrested by the United States for reporting the news.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:44.360]  The guardians of speech are now the enemies of speech. The people charged with policing power
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:50.120]  are now colluding with power. We're not saying any of this to defend Julian Assange. We just want
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:57.640]  to be absolutely clear about who hurts this country more and it's not him. Will Julian Assange be
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:04.680]  playing a role towards justice being served in America or has President Trump been compromised
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:13.560]  by the deep state? Patriots and truth-seekers are eagerly awaiting to find out. For Infowars.com,
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:29.480]  this is Greg Rees.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:44.600]  Infowars. Tomorrow's News. Today. Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:05:02.440]  Our grandparents and great grandparents knew that they can't food during the falls they'd have
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:08.680]  it during the winter. And that's what I'm talking about at Infowars.com. With Infowars Select,
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:14.280]  it's the full spectrum of my patriots supply on the top most respected companies out there.

[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:33.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. Live from Austin, Texas,
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:40.920]  broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:49.480]  Seoul, Pais, formerly from Brazil, living in America, supposedly left Florida days ago
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:55.080]  dressed in cano and black and made statements on social media that she was planning something
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:01.880]  associated with the anniversary of Columbine. It just so happens to come on Hitler's birthday
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:06.840]  that so many of these black Prince coat killers attack on. But she'd be the first woman to attack
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:11.080]  on the date. But it's now been reported that law enforcement says she's dead. Just minutes ago,
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:15.400]  we don't know why she's dead or how she's dead. But the FBI speculated that they caught her on
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.680]  the highway. There may have been some type of shootout. She may have killed herself. We don't
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:29.800]  know. But her name in Portuguese means sunshine. So sunshine is dead. Repeat, sunshine is dead.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:35.800]  The chair is against the wall. John has a long mustache and for all forces on or behind enemy
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:43.960]  lines, this song is for you. Seriously, sunshine is dead. And is it interesting how they get to
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:49.560]  bring up Columbine? They get to bring up San Diego, they get to bring up Parkland and and
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:55.880]  retraumatize everybody, including the families constantly lying about yours truly saying that I
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:01.480]  say that Parkland never happened, that I won't stop saying it didn't happen. No, I said the
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:07.160]  police stood down, which is now confirmed. We broke that. But she's deader than a doornail.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:10.760]  They tell us and boy, is it funny just to have the anniversary of Columbine?
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:19.880]  Is it the 20th anniversary? Happened in 1999. And so magically on the 20th anniversary, how do
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:25.960]  you get it back out there? Guns are bad. It's all happening. A crazy woman. I'm not saying it's a
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.400]  false flag. I'm not saying it's staged. But we should, you know, this woman has due process,
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:33.880]  right? She's supposedly dead. We just hear she's dead. There's this woman that left Miami. She's
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:42.200]  coming to hurt kids. 60% of the schools are all closed in Colorado. And now it brings back
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:49.640]  Columbine all over again. Harris and Clybold and their black Prince codes, their devil worship,
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:57.400]  just like Adam Lanza. I forget Adam Lanza from what happened tragically at Sandy Hook because
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:02.600]  I'm the Sandy Hook villain now. And there's no doubt of this. The corporate media are a bunch
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:08.360]  of vampires invoking mass shootings to create mentally ill copycats. So whether this was staged
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:13.880]  completely and some innocent woman got hopped up on drugs by some leftist group in a big Jesse
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:20.360]  Smollett style false flag, which is possible. Or whether she's a schizophrenic crazy so obsessed
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:25.080]  with mass shooting news that the mainstream media won't stop hyping that somehow she had some,
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:28.440]  you know, schizophrenic break that she was going to do this, but she's dead now.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:36.120]  And so 60% of the schools closed in the dreaded fear of one young woman, little sunshine,
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:46.120]  Sol Payees, who's now dead. Let's go ahead and go to part of that Fox News breaking report.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:52.360]  This is the breaking news right now. The FBI saying that the woman you see in the center of
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:59.320]  your screen 18 year old Sol Payees is the person that they have been looking for after getting
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:05.400]  credible threats that they felt had happened from her. She traveled from Miami to the
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:12.200]  men commit 99% of violent crimes. Women sometimes poison people or stuff like that.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.120]  But it's only passive aggressive. Who really believes this woman was going to shoot a bunch
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:24.600]  of kids. But see, now you can't even trust women. Now you can't even trust women.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:33.560]  And it's this credible threat. Remember the guy with no criminal record, the fellow from Australia,
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.240]  Avi Anemone, he caught
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.600]  Comedy Central editing tapes and make him song. He's a Nazi when he's Jewish.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.280]  He said, I'm coming to the US to a media tour to expose this and Comedy Central filed a complaint
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:54.040]  with the FBI and said, we feel scared. It's like when the lawyers for the Sandy Hook families go,
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:58.520]  Alex Jones is arresting our families right now. Take him off Roku right now. Of course,
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:02.520]  none of that's true. But they're claiming it's like calling it a fake bomb threat.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:08.600]  That's what Comedy Central did. So it's this new thing like, well, we felt he was a threat. Well,
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.760]  I mean, who knows, this woman may have been real, may have been a threat, maybe a loon. But how do
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:18.040]  we even know what this is on the anniversary of Columbine? Because the deep state can't get away
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:22.680]  with completely staging stuff anymore. Can they? They've just got to hype things up and give you
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:29.400]  the memory of things. And I'll tell you, Columbine's really suspicious. The Aurora shooting where the
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:33.640]  guy said he was under mind control. He was in a secret DARPA program of mind control and he told
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:37.720]  the police who's under mind control and the witnesses reported multiple shooters. I mean,
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:42.520]  hell, they're telling us no arson at the cathedral, no Tredon, they're telling us no Islam when the
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:47.240]  fire is an hour old. Even Lou Dobbs says there's a cover up. But you're not supposed to question.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:52.200]  I'm sorry. Let's go back to this lady. They just tell us it's dead. Half the state's locked down
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:58.120]  in dread of a woman. Here it is. We don't know the specificity of those threats and what they had
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:02.440]  to do with the high school. But we can tell you that she was quote unquote, according to police,
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:08.440]  infatuated with the mass shooting that happened there, what will be 20 years ago this Saturday.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:12.840]  Infatuated when they admit that all this hype of mass shootings is what's triggering
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:17.160]  many mentally ill people to do it. So what does corporate media do? Hype it, hype it, hype it,
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:23.080]  continue. Alicia, things changing in the last few minutes. What's happening?
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.520]  Hi, Harris. Things are changing very quickly. And we've been in contact with KDBR. This is the
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:32.920]  Fox affiliate here in Denver, who we work very closely with. And the reporter on the scene there
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:38.280]  with the FBI says an agent came up to them and told them there is no one in custody that the
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:43.800]  suspect is dead. Again, that is according to the local Fox affiliate. KDBR, Fox News Channel is
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:50.120]  There is no arson. There is no terrorism. Oh, and by the way, this woman you're looking for,
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:57.080]  she just dead. Just announce it. She just bye bye. Let's continue. Very important information.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:03.240]  But as you did mention, the FBI field office here in Denver has tweeted within the last few minutes
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:10.120]  an update saying in all caps that there is no longer a threat to the community. Earlier, what
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:17.400]  they had said that there was a credible threat in the form of 18 year old soul piece from Miami,
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:23.400]  Florida, who again, they say the Miami field office had warned them on Monday evening that there
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:29.080]  was somebody who was traveling here to Colorado that they might need to know about. Apparently,
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:33.800]  when she landed, according to the FBI here in Denver, once she landed, she managed to make it
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:40.440]  to a store and acquire some sort of shotgun and ammunition and then disappeared into the foothills
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.600]  here, the base of the mountains here in Denver. Whenever you see mountains
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:50.600]  in Denver, the foothills there are like the base of the base. Well, if you go an hour and a half
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:56.840]  west into Mount, the Mount Evans area, that is where the FBI says. I need to get in with what
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:01.560]  we've just confirmed. So this woman that they have been looking for, this 18 year old soul piece,
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:08.280]  has died. She's deceased. We don't have a lot of detail on this, but we can confirm,
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:14.280]  according to authorities there in Denver, per law enforcement source, the Columbine suspect woman
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:21.080]  is dead, unclear if that wound was self-inflicted. We are still on the story. This had dozens of
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:25.960]  schools, Alicia, as we know from our story. 60% of the state. Shutting their doors today.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:29.800]  The credibility of... All right, that's enough. Let's stop right there. So we've got millions
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:33.640]  of illegal aliens pouring in, committing massive crimes everywhere. You got illegal aliens that
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:38.520]  shoot at cops, kill cops. They'll be a manhunt. They don't shut states down. But notice it's just
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:44.200]  total fear shut. 60% of the schools do it all. There's a woman. She's got a shotgun. She's in
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:51.720]  camo. Maybe she's just schizophrenic. Might be true. But this, we're allowed to ask questions
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:56.840]  about Notre Dame, or about Jesse Smollett, or about Gulf of Tonkin, or about babies and incubators
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:02.200]  to get us in the Gulf War, or about Russiagate being a fraud, and as much fraud as we've seen,
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:07.320]  this thing really smells to high heaven. We'll follow this more throughout the day as it unfolds.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:12.680]  Looking at Notre Dame, though, Leo Zygami, investigative journalist, best-selling author,
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.960]  from Rome, who's also an expert, obviously, and lived in Paris, will give us his take on what
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.440]  the inside scoop is in the Vatican. And again, he's exposed the Vatican. He has a lot of inside
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:27.960]  sources on what exactly is going on there while we're told that we should not investigate.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:33.960]  Even though a lot of radical Muslims are all over the world celebrating Notre Dame going up in a
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:40.360]  towering inferno. Please don't forget, we're running a once a year, then over a year now,

[01:19:53.800 --> 01:20:17.720]  now back at infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:53.720]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host Leo Zagami is joining us. Come out in a few minutes.
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:21:01.560]  So, Sol Pais, this former Brazilian woman, Portuguese background,
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:09.560]  living in the capital of Latin America, Miami, supposedly flew to outside Denver,
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:14.760]  went and bought a shotgun, put herself in camo. And they were reporting earlier,
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.800]  they didn't know the cause of death, but the FBI said the threat was over.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:24.040]  With 60% of the school closed in Colorado, that's 180,000 students plus.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.920]  Now, just minutes ago, they're now reporting that they believe she took her own life.
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:35.560]  And this fits more in with the MO of all the media hype around mass shootings that women don't do
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:42.280]  mass shootings, not that we know of other than maybe Bonnie and Clyde. Bonnie being the female
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:49.080]  side of that. It's very, very rare. But to get attention, to be on the news, to be somebody,
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.320]  this would certainly do it. And this is why a lot of people do mass shootings.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:57.640]  That's why in the old days, our government media didn't really promote terrorist attacks in this
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:04.040]  country. They played them down because they didn't want more of them. But they do play up the mass
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:07.480]  shootings. There are a bunch of ghouls, a bunch of vampires, but this whole thing should be
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.560]  investigated. We should skeptically look at it because of the history of things being manipulated
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:17.400]  in the stage. We have to do that. That's why they're telling people within an hour of the Notre
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:22.120]  Dame fire, even starting not Islamic, not terror, not arson, even though the government says, no,
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:27.400]  we're still investigating its cause. They don't want people to ask questions. So here's Fox News
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:33.000]  with the latest of threats from the woman on the right side of your screen, 18 year old soul
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:42.040]  pice. They knew that she traveled from Miami to Denver and they knew that she was infatuated with
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:48.760]  the killing, the mass shooting, nearly 20 years ago at Columbine High School. In the middle of
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:54.280]  the night, we have learned from our reporter, Alicia Acuña, between one and three in the morning,
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:23:01.000]  they were trying to decide what to do with the largest public school system in the state and
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:08.840]  beyond. They made the decision to shut down 60% of the public schools in the state of Colorado.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:17.000]  580,000 students affected by this and they did so because they weren't sure what this woman would
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:23.960]  do. She was armed, she bought ammunition and a weapon after she landed in the Denver area
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:29.880]  and they were looking for her. They found her body a short time ago in an area called Mount
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:36.360]  Evans. That's about 60 miles outside the Denver area. It's a recreational area. As we learn more
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:42.760]  details on what the city apparently has dodged today because of great police work and the FBI
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:48.120]  will bring it to you. A news conference is coming up at 1.30 to cover it. Okay. We're going to
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:54.120]  leo Zagami now and shift gears into Notre Dame. But this whole thing needs to be investigated,
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:59.640]  obviously. Just the hysteria associated with mass shootings and building up the 20th anniversary
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:04.280]  of Columbine that launched the modern age of this young devil worshipers and black trench
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:09.000]  coats that play shoot-em-up video games all day and who love Hitler and love Stalin. This is the MO
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:12.200]  going out to do something evil for their God. Why don't we
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:22.280]  profile these people, but we don't profile these people. Leo Zagami from Italy joins us from Rome.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:27.400]  Obviously, somebody that studies and writes about corruption in the Vatican has been the vanguard
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:33.640]  of exposing it. I want to get his take right off the bat about Notre Dame and within 30 minutes
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:39.800]  of the fire, we're told by corporate media everywhere, no Muslims, no Islam, no terror,
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:44.440]  don't ask questions, which really begs the question, what are they trying to cover up, Leo?
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:25:00.200]  All right, well, we've had some Skype problems really bad lately, and we had Leo working and
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:05.480]  good a minute ago, but we'll talk about that. We'll start over next segment. We'll start over
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:11.880]  next segment. It's not a problem. We're going to go to you, Leo. We're going to do it because it's
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:18.600]  important and it's a good thing to do for everybody here. Let me just compose myself for a moment.
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:26.040]  Leo, I mean, this begs the question here. Why are they up front saying something,
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:30.920]  even Lou Dobbs came out and said, this looks political to say, don't investigate Notre Dame.
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:40.120]  It is more than political. It is something to do with one of the most sacred places
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:47.560]  of not only of Christianity because it predates Christianity. It used to be the Temple of Jupiter
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:53.320]  and we know the close connection between Macron and Jupiter. The Notre Dame was even for a time
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:26:00.360]  taken over during the revolution in 1793 and transformed in the Temple of Reason.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:06.120]  One thing is for sure, Notre Dame belongs for the last 100 years to the French government,
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:13.160]  but they have given us the possibility to the Catholic Church to use it, but it's the Catholic
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:21.560]  Church that theoretically should be responsible for this place, for the security, for the well-being
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:27.000]  of the people who visited, for everything. So there is something missing here. I mean, the Pope
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:35.880]  didn't intervene for a long time. He actually waited the day after to make a final statement
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:44.120]  on this tragic episode, which touches the most visited cathedral after Saint Peter. So, I mean,
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:50.520]  it's very strange that Pope Francis didn't intervene. Of course, we have also the situation
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:57.080]  regarding the possible connections with Islamic attacks. I mean, there had been people that,
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:03.400]  of course, had attempted, Muslims that had attempted some kind of attacks on this church
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:09.560]  prior to this episode. So, of course, there is a lot of suspicion here. And in the mix of all this,
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:19.320]  there was also the sighting of a strange figure on top of the cathedral while the whole place was
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:25.080]  going on fire. There was a very strange figure, and it was caught in front of the cameras of
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:32.440]  TVs worldwide. So, I pointed, I wanted to do a close-up of this figure. And, of course, some
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:36.920]  people can say it looks like the ghost of Osam Bin Laden. No, it's not the ghost of Osam Bin Laden,
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:43.720]  but it is a Knights Templar. That is actually a Knights Templar and how they used to dress back
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:50.280]  in the days. Now, we know there is a lot of stories about ghosts in Notre Dame. And so,
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:57.160]  but this one is pretty weird to see it in front of our eyes. So, I mean, of course, I wanted to
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:02.120]  point out on that. But also, it's the period of time we are focusing on here, from the 15
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:11.720]  of April to the 1st of May. Every year, we have massacres, we have very terrible events happening
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:17.880]  because it coincides with then the culmination, which is, of course, between the 13th of April
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:24.760]  and the 1st of May, this festival of ancient origins where you, of course, set up bonfires,
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:32.600]  set everything on fire, of course. And these special bonfires were made so the ashes could
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:38.280]  have a sort of protective power. And this is very strange in this moment of time in which
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:45.320]  we have Macron's presidency so weak. And of course, we saw the yellow vest marching for months
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:50.920]  against this. Could this be a way to change the subject from the yellow vest and bring France
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:55.960]  together under globalist rule? Let's talk about it with Leo Zagami straight ahead. And who is that
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:02.680]  strange figure? Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:06.600]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state until one day I chose to
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.160]  lead my family to freedom. Today, we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot,
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:15.240]  hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:19.880]  ogres. If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:25.720]  Real Estate team is here to help. Go to blackriflerealestate.com. That's blackriflerealestate.com.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:30:03.240]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems,
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:08.520]  and most of them are funded by the globalist. Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:12.520]  zeitgeist. That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:15.880]  I didn't invent all this. I went and researched the Renaissance,
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:20.680]  Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:25.800]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been. That's why the globalists are trying
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:31.000]  to shut it down so desperately, because we have the light in the dark of the night that
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:36.280]  sends chills at my spine. So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars by
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:40.680]  buying the great products at infoarstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos,
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:45.400]  and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:49.960]  discernment. From myself and the whole Infowars family, I want to thank all of you for what
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:56.440]  you've done, because without you, Infowars is nothing. You are the Infowar, and I salute you.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:03.880]  I want to say BrainForce is great. I want to say TurboForce is amazing. It is. But if you took
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:09.800]  it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than that. And that's an
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:15.880]  example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest,
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:20.200]  the best out there. You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:23.640]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong,
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:27.560]  they don't give you the burpees, but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:32.360]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:35.640]  It's so good. In my view, I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:40.280]  I eat five capillots of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:46.680]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:53.560]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:32:01.640]  is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it. There is a publicly admitted international
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:07.880]  plan to shut down nationalist pro-free market pro-western speech all across the world.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:13.800]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:18.760]  be the platform, then they set the precedent. Now, if you try to tell somebody the dangers of
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:25.400]  vaccines and read off the insert, they take you off the internet. Now, Google announced just today
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:29.720]  that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform,
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:35.720]  because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees. Our country in the world more and more is in the
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:43.720]  grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist, anti-human transhumanists who literally think they own and
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:49.480]  run our lives. And if we keep bowing to these cults, the cancer that is San Francisco and many of
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:54.920]  these big universities is going to be the operating system of the planet. Humanity must awaken and
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:33:04.280]  say no to these control freaks. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:26.520]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:53.560]  Well, Leo Zagami, he's not part of the Vatican. Every time I say he is a Vatican insider,
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.960]  we go, oh my god, you've got the evil Vatican leadership on. Number one, the Vatican is a
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:01.880]  consortium of a bunch of different vying groups. Anybody that studies history knows that.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:10.520]  He's been a whistleblower, someone exposing it. And I used to read his stuff 15 years ago and
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:16.680]  couldn't believe a lot of it. It's all come true. He's very credible and he joins us right now.
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:23.480]  He should visit his website, leozagami, Z-A-G-A-M-I dot com, leozagami dot com. He should get his
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:29.720]  books, all of it. He's really a smart guy, hasn't steered me wrong yet. But notice I said to him
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:34.280]  earlier, I said, what's behind this? It's very suspicious. They're saying, don't look at Islamic
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:38.520]  terror. It's very suspicious. They're saying, don't ask questions when the fire was only an hour old.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:42.680]  You've got Fox News, CNN cutting off French officials saying you're looking at Islam.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:47.800]  You had 800 churches attack torches. You named it last year. Stephen Lou Dobbs,
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:52.360]  his question. You notice he didn't go right to what he thinks. He just went to the historical
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:57.640]  nature. And also this was on multiple cameras. This bizarre person looks like someone been
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:04.120]  lodged in Orinite's Templar, going and hiding behind one of the pillars and then trying to run
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:09.640]  away. Like they didn't want to be videotaped. That just adds to who would want to act like
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:14.840]  that while a building is a towering inferno. There's a lot of sex and different orders,
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:19.000]  I know, hundreds of them that visit these facilities. But for him to have access to
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.240]  those upper areas, this is a pretty big deal. And I'm glad you hone in on that because the
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:28.840]  media spun it. Oh, look, there's a Muslim, you know, up in the top. Well, no, we don't know who
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:34.360]  it is, but it's someone in medieval garb or Middle Eastern garb. Or as you said, it looks,
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:39.160]  you're right, the white with the mailed arms and the top, it looks when you really pause it
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:45.000]  like a Knights Templar outfit, actually. Yes, because the Knights Templar were for a long time
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:51.240]  in the Holy Land. So they used to wear a white carbon, even if they were Christian. And so
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:55.640]  it actually looks like a nice thing because the Knights Templars were the ones who actually financed
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:02.040]  this church, Alex. The church was built by operative masons under the direction of Knights
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:07.720]  Templars. And it kind of took a long time, as we know. But in that time, the Knights Templars
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:13.160]  were in charge. And then the last master of the Knights Templars, Jack Demule, was sentenced to
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:18.360]  death and burned in front of... Friday the 13th. What was that year? I forget. But right after
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:23.400]  they finished the cathedral, they killed it. Well, that was the day they started the persecution.
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:29.160]  And then after they killed them instead in March, on the 18th of March, they celebrated,
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:34.280]  the same thing is that they started celebrating in the actual cathedral in Notre Dame. And I show
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:39.880]  this with a couple of links in my latest article. They have been the Knights Templars for the first
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:49.800]  time in 800 years. Basically, 900 years have gone back to their place. Because for a long time,
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:55.720]  the Catholic Church, of course, had no intentions of letting the Knights Templars inside the church.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:37:02.440]  But now I have showed with a lot of photos and a lot of links that this is happening. Since
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:11.240]  2017, they have been regularly celebrating in Notre Dame, Mass, the Knights Templars. And this
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:19.080]  is kind of strange, of course, also looking at this image that we see that... I tell you, Alex,
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:27.960]  I'm not sure this image is of a terrestrial nature. Because ghosts are real. And in such places,
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:33.560]  they can appear. So... I was about to say, everybody says it looks like been live. But if you look
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:38.360]  closer, it looks like the male hanging down, the male on the arms, it looks like a Templar outfit.
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:43.480]  And then there's another strange thing that happened. While all this was going on,
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:50.520]  for the first time in a long time, Pope Francis was with Pope Ratzinger sitting in front of the TV.
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:57.720]  I showed it in an article posted that this was this rare meeting between the two popes.
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:03.560]  As the cathedral was burning, the two popes were meeting up. And by the way, that's only happened
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:09.400]  a few times. You're right. That's really weird. No, but also Pope Ratzinger was the last pope to
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:19.160]  actually visit and celebrate Mass in Notre Dame. And I showed with a video that was posted by Rome
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:26.040]  reports just after the accident that the approach that Ratzinger had, of course, was much more
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:33.560]  traditional. The video you can find at the bottom of my article shows Ratzinger inside Notre Dame
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:39.640]  Cathedral. And what he was saying and his approach was completely different from a guy who is
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:45.400]  destroying the Catholic faith and the Christian faith. Ratzinger, of course, was not the perfect
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:51.320]  person. We know he had many faults, but he's a more conservative figure. Laterally, we have seen
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:57.400]  how he has attacked the present situation regarding sexual abuse and he has even
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:03.000]  discussed it. I know you don't like to speculate, but obviously them saying, don't say Islamic
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.880]  terror, don't say artson when the flames are 400 feet tall. That says they're covering something up
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:12.120]  or at least wanting to control the narrative. What's your gut level? What's your intel and who
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:16.280]  could be behind this? As you said, Islamists have tried to attack it. They've been celebrating it in
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:22.600]  France. They've been celebrating it in Canada. You've got university heads, you've got political
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:29.960]  people in Canada saying good, burn it down. Well, we have seen also a famous Catholic commentator
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:35.000]  who works for the Jesuits who said immediately after he tweeted a new report that he was talking
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:41.720]  about it. And then he canceled his tweet because the Jesuits knew that something weird was going
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:47.720]  on. Of course, I think that the end purpose of all this is to destroy Christianity so they can
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:52.840]  build a temple that embraces this new religion, which is Chris Lam. By the way, that's on infowars.com.
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:58.920]  Leftists are saying they want a New Age temple built on its place. They want, of course, something
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:04.200]  different. And that's why they are destroying a symbol of Christianity to replace it instead
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:10.840]  with the symbol of one world religion that initially is called Chris Lam because the main
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:17.400]  two religions that are forming this alliance is, of course, the Vatican together with the rich
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:24.280]  oil emirates that are giving the money for this project. So I think that that is the final
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:31.000]  take that I can model. So you're saying evidence points towards insiders burning it down to turn
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:38.440]  into a New Age temple? Telling it in a temple of this new religion. You have to understand that
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:45.800]  Chris Lam is a religion that is unifying more and more Catholicism with Islam, Christianity
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:52.520]  with Islam, because now all forms of Christianity are operating under the pope. So this is really
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:41:00.200]  the eve of the one world religion. And of course, there is a lot of ominous signs. I remember a few
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:08.120]  years back you interviewed the guy who was who made that strange video. I think it was called
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:16.680]  eye pet goat, something like that. And that also has inside it an ominous warning regarding the
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:22.840]  Notre Dame Tratidro that falls down. I don't know if you remember that that weird video. Oh yeah,
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.160]  I had him on like 10 years ago and he made a film about the Illuminati. They were shown to me
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.920]  yesterday and it shows shows the spire falling on Notre Dame but not the rest. Yeah, but the thing
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:41.240]  is that when it goes down at that moment Jesus loses his what he has around his head with his
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:46.920]  stones over and on. And then that is what it was the most precious relic that you have inside
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:54.840]  this cathedral. So it's a very ominous sign definitely. And the synchronicity points out
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:01.480]  to something that it's a melting pot. So what you're saying is all angles point towards a ceremony,
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:05.800]  a ritual of some type and that we're being covered up. We're not being told the truth
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:12.600]  because we are profane. Well, of course, is the period of bonfires. As I said at the beginning
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:20.120]  of the show, we are going towards bell time, this celebration. And so I think that by burning
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:28.440]  this church by destroying it, we are going towards the end times. We are forcing their
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:35.800]  way towards the end times. They want to see if their antichrist is more powerful than the returning
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:41.880]  Messiah. And this is a very big question mark here because of course we know how it's gonna end up
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:48.920]  but the materialistic world that is controlling all this, the people that are putting millions of
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:55.320]  dollars, millions to construct this cathedral, they think that they can get away with it. They

[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:58.680]  we're finishing up with leo zagami right now always on fire joe rogan is under attack by media
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:04.120]  matters and i'm not going to tell you what he probably told me but it's funny but we're going
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:10.200]  to play some of that and and and get into that and then also get into some of the flashbacks
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:19.320]  with bernie sanders ahead of david nino rod regus heavyweight champion of the world joining
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:24.360]  us coming up to get into free speech and his view of trump and so much more and then throughout the
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.480]  week i'm gonna open the phones up the last two days because we've been taking more calls lately
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:33.320]  but i've been bad the last few days with so many guests uh briefly we only do this once a year
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:40.360]  because when you do 50 off on apparel in most cases you lose money i mean clothing is expensive
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:44.680]  and that made america with all the regulations and stuff and then the printing here we have a
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:51.080]  bunch of shirts between 15 and 17 dollars to print to buy and print in america with a you know nice
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:56.760]  rayon real soft you know real comfortable so you do 50 off on those you lose money
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:02.680]  well guess what everything is 50 off so some shirts we buy that are still comfortable but
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:08.440]  are cheap five dollars a piece print on them cost another dollar or so normally sell them for like
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:16.440]  feel 15 bucks right now they're discounted infowarstore.com you can go right there all ball caps all
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:23.320]  t-shirts all apparel are 50 off and you know i thought that people would want to get heat so i
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:29.000]  thought well info wars.com shirts will make a bunch of other shirts that are like trump cutting
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:35.080]  madusa's head off and it's hillary or you know a bunch of other like news war shirts or don't california
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:42.520]  my usa shirt and and those are popular but people want the in-your-face info wars bright red shirt

[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.320]  you wear these in a leftist area it's like we're in a red mega hat and there's there's a tax every
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:50:01.160]  day we know about probably does as we don't it's dangerous that's why i say we're a gold foil women's

[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:27.000]  going back to leo zigami leo why are they saying out of the gates keep asking this you're a smart
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.920]  cookie you never want to speculate you're getting into the background the history you know why on
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:39.160]  god's green earth when the fires are only 30 minutes old 400 feet in the air are they saying no
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:47.240]  terrorism no islam no no arson you see nothing you that makes everyone then think it's that
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:52.120]  and even liberals i know think somebody torched it what is your gut level on this i mean you're
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:56.840]  saying looks like a ritual they admit they want to build some illuminati temple like the louvre on it
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:52:02.600]  but i mean why would they be so obvious about saying it's not an inside job it happened all
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:10.520]  by itself with no evidence well they have already uh had so many attacks in france in the last couple
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:18.280]  of months from february smearing instruments in churches destroying tabernacles and nothing one
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:25.560]  church but many churches including so including the famous dumb brown davinci code one that you
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:32.680]  know everybody knows the same soup is one and always in paris but there's been many attacks against
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:39.160]  churches and they're not exposing of course the perpetrators because here the situation is very
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:44.760]  clear either is the muslims or either is the satanist because there is a lot of satanist that
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:51.160]  will do this kind of thing so both of them are responsible and nobody seems to be tackling the
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:55.720]  problem because still we don't have one person that's been arrested for all these attacks that
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:53:02.920]  started in early february with all these churches so and plus we have an ominous prophecy made by a
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:12.760]  guy called michelle the notary dumb nostradamus who also pointed out on this moment in which of course
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:18.840]  the cathedral will be bent in one of his quatrains he seems to be pointing at a moment in which
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:24.760]  after following a long century evil will return what does it mean this it means that after the first
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:31.560]  world war the second world war we are going inevitably here in europe towards a third world
[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:38.120]  war and it says in this quatra in france and italy what emotions will you under undergo we know that
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:44.040]  at the moment these countries have some great problems now in libya we are losing control
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:49.560]  of the situation and we have been warned that there is hundreds of terrorists waiting to come
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:56.760]  through italy into europe and so i mean the situation is very clear here either we stop these
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:54:02.360]  muslims or either we stop this muslim but the night's tempers where that was their job so the
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:08.040]  fact that these new night's tempers are not the ones that used to stop the muslims but are the ones
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:13.000]  who actually are embracing them and are making sure that they are preparing for them this whole
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:18.760]  big thing so they can make a one world religion where that goes against the very tradition of the
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:26.600]  night's tempers which were fighting with their own lives to protect christians and and and then we
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:34.120]  have the pope that of course is not caring of this church because this church is not even owned by
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:40.440]  the vatican so who cares but i mean the fact is here there is some real evil going on and and there
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:45.960]  is something that is about to happen something very big you you were mentioning columbine earlier
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:51.400]  on and it's one of the episodes that i mentioned during a long list of episodes that i cited in
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:57.400]  april we had the april 15 2013 the boston marathon bombing we had the virginia tech shooting in
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:05.720]  april 16 2007 we have specifically a few months ago said look for columbine i said it a few days
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:13.080]  ago i said columbine is on the list i mean it of course these are events that have put together
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:19.640]  some kind of evil uh aggregate that's what we call it in occult terms aggregate is a
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:26.440]  fault form that puts together faults and then manifest through people and it's it's a very
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:31.240]  powerful force that they occultist of the new world order let's be clear they hype up mass shootings
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:35.880]  to get weak minded people to do it they call it lesser magic they put the idea out trying to get
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:41.720]  others to do it and then they need the right places to do it so the fact that they can destroy this
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:48.840]  this cathedral this symbol of christianity and replace it with another temple well they are going
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:55.000]  back to the roots because that temple was the temple of jupiter jupiter is zeus jupiter is the
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:01.160]  head of all the pagan gods so there is something cooking that is very big here and of course it's
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:07.400]  it's not a coincidence let's be clear her whole joseph watson's article elitist architects want
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:13.080]  Notre Dame rebuilt to reflect new global france it's burning feels like an act of liberation
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:16.600]  so you've got these modern architects want to build something ugly and squat on it
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:19.320]  want to destroy history licking their filthy lips
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:27.080]  they are they are of course going for for for the whole plan you know they want to establish
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:34.040]  this new order and they have to destroy first this last you know symbols of christianity that
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:40.040]  here in europe are you have to understand that france now is completely in the hand of the
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:46.520]  muslims the emirates are pouring in billions not millions billions to construct every day
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:52.280]  new mosques and they openly brag all over the news we have it but just like piss on you piss on
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:59.160]  france piss on you they're just laughing yeah and and the italians even the italians this week
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:05.640]  started to understand that when they saw that in the north of italy a church of the catholic church
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:10.840]  is being transformed in a mosque well that has opened the eyes even of the italians on what is
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:16.040]  happening but of course the islamic community in france is much larger than any other place in
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:23.560]  europe so the the invasion in in france is completed they can now pass to the to the attack
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:30.120]  and in 800 churches blown up or burned last year in a total celebration with our own media helping
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:34.920]  cover it up led by shep smith do five more minutes with us you're in idly see what they're waking up

[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:12.360]  so bottom line leo zegami and you've not really ever steered me wrong you're saying all evidence
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:18.920]  points towards a globalist illuminati ritual to burn down Notre Dame and then build an occultic
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:25.160]  site and that's on infowar's.com elitist architects want Notre Dame rebuilt to reflect new globalist
[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:29.880]  france whatever really happened when it's being covered up because you never before the fires
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:35.560]  were even out say no arson no terror no islam shifting years though to europe in general can it
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:42.280]  be saved or is the fall of Notre Dame emblematic of the fall of christendom it's emblematic that
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:48.440]  this week crosses on graves in an italian cemetery in bologna have been covered by black cloth in
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:54.280]  order not to offend muslims i mean they have installed motorized blackout curtains that goes
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:01:01.240]  like and covered all the crosses of the cemetery when they're celebrating other religions i mean
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:08.520]  this is totally insane i mean to cover the crosses in a cemetery i think we are going one step to
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:12.200]  fend well what's the headline on that i want to see that because i know that grease is pulling
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:17.480]  down crosses that'll offend muslims when they invade and lesbos but you're saying in bologna
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:23.400]  they pulled they covered up crosses for a muslim celebration yes crosses covered in cloth in italian
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:30.520]  cemeteries to avoid offending islam and they're doing it methodically they're doing it with the
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:34.760]  awareness of what they're doing i mean they're doing it of course in a town in north of italy
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:39.400]  which is the presently made up of left-wing communes they're all communists all socialists
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:45.720]  and communists because bologna as we know is the capital of communists in italy so in this area
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:51.960]  where people are really atheist they are but they're still you know in the countryside the
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:57.480]  catholic so they have crosses in cemeteries like everywhere else in italy and they have decided
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:03.800]  though that they didn't want to offend anymore muslims and i think here we have really gone
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:09.640]  one step too further i mean to avoid offending other religions by destroying your own
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:17.480]  destroying the symbol which is the only symbol that survived the fire the great cross that
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:24.760]  was embraced by the fire brigade when they entered this church and not a word for the
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:30.120]  for the person that nearly lost his life one of the members of the fire brigade the pope didn't
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:38.520]  say one word for this courageous hero i think that we are really seeing that this papacy
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:46.040]  is not in line with christianity and at the at the same time the left is beyond fanatism
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:52.600]  they are really into ideological delirium that's what what is happening here and the
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:57.400]  populist interior minister matthew salvini from the league of course is going to have
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:02.760]  a lot of people on the side that when the elections are going to arrive at the end of
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:08.120]  may the european elections so i think the populist are going to win but this is going to also mean
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:14.840]  the end of the european union because once people are going to you know like people who are real
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:19.240]  politicians not just puppets are going to arrive there in brazil they're going to see that this is
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:25.640]  basically a dictatorship a technocracy at that point i think that the the one at the end of may
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:31.720]  is going to be the last european election before the great war that is going to explode inevitably
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:37.560]  between islam and that's right and the globalist whether it's the us or europe are trying to flood
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:42.360]  us with their third world populations they can politically control and detonate to bring us
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:46.760]  to our knees of civil war but i think it's too late i think we're going to actually win long
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:52.440]  term because if we're ideologically awake they're not going to be able to stop us leo we have to
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:59.560]  require like matthew salvini did here in italy to have the crucifixes hung again in all public
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:06.120]  buildings here in the west it's all a ritual we have to bring it out even if even if you don't
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:11.880]  believe in god these devil worshipers they do we have to invoke it don't we yeah well of course
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:18.680]  they want to destroy the signs of christianity because they want to evoke the takeover of the
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:27.800]  antichrist and of course at the moment macron is one of the you know of the people that they think
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:33.320]  is going to be the one of the candidates for being an antichrist but of course he's already out of
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:39.160]  the picture because i think that macron the only way he can stay in power in france is with a
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:46.760]  dictatorship and that's what he's doing but the dictatorships like this will be exposed of course
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:52.120]  that's right great job leo zegami leo zegami.com thank you so much sir get his books at leo

[02:05:50.840 --> 02:06:01.240]  original now back at infowarstore.com we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques
[02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:10.280]  which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude
[02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:19.320]  people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:35.800]  be in trouble i have to better start from the beginning i have to better start from the beginning
[02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:42.200]  too many kids are what's making planet worse a lot of these kids come from bad gene pools
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:49.080]  they don't have stable parents making good decisions mercury containing vaccines may help
[02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:54.600]  not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics these new studies suggest
[02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:59.000]  that the opposite that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:04.120]  and mental performance fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay but could it also
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:09.960]  cause cancer? for now the government had the right under u.s. law to conduct secret testing on the
[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:14.920]  american public under specific conditions we have to work the dark side while we spend time in the
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:21.560]  shadows any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil will join me
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:26.120]  and i'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see there's a need for a new world order
[02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:44.600]  someday in the next few years a solution will emerge
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:36.760]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen welcome back our next guest
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:41.160]  david nino rodriguez who's broken mike tyson's record number of knockouts
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:44.440]  but the big thing i'm proud of him for is being a patriot supporting trump supporting
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:48.040]  the sovereignty of this country and i want to talk to him about the censorship attacks
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:51.800]  he's gone through we appreciate him joining us coming up here in about 10 minutes let me hit
[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:58.520]  this right now it's being a fighting joe rogan started his podcasting career out of what he does
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:07.720]  for the ufc with fight companions and so he basically has a show that is a man cave the show
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:13.640]  is mainly guys and so we've got media matters run by george soros the literal nazi collaborator
[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:21.640]  for tattle tailing for the world that oh look the joe rogan experience disproportionately
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:31.560]  host men over 91 of the guest appearances on apple's most popular podcast are made by men
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:37.880]  and just last week i saw brian skelter brian skelter saying we can't criticize female candidates
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:45.080]  for president that triggers the patriarchal bias so you step into a man's world and if i
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:49.160]  agree with the woman i think she's better than a man i'll vote for but now you can't be criticized
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:55.640]  it's crazy so again this is a show based on the fight companions that grew into a political show
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:59.480]  and a news show and now they're really really jealous of it because you can argue it's the
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:03.720]  biggest podcast in the world definitely the biggest serious podcast in the world i mean putty
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:09.480]  pies bigger but that's more entertainment and so now the sharks are circling joe rogan
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.760]  talking about his sponsors and what he does and all the rest of it because they want
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:19.080]  control of information tucker carlson last night talked about it here's a short clip
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:26.200]  joe rogan is a comedian and television figure and host of a podcast called the joe rogan
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:30.760]  experience you may not know it but it's a big deal it's one of the most downloaded podcasts
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:36.200]  in the world suddenly he has some very angry critics on the left media matters which is a
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:41.480]  character assassination organization benefiting the democratic party but posing as a non-profit
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:47.160]  just went after rogan they're complaining he has too many men on his program doesn't matter
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:51.640]  that it's his program he can invite on whomever he wants doesn't matter that his fans are obviously
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:57.080]  happy with his program more people listen to joe rogan than watch anything on cnr msnbc
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:03.560]  media matters is sending a warning joe rogan had better listen to them or they'll crush him
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:09.080]  they'll find some excuse to start an ad boycott take a show away now if you ask media matters
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:13.800]  they'd say they're upset because rogan doesn't care about diversity but of course the truth is
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:18.760]  exactly the opposite rogan is popular precisely because he welcomes a diversity of opinion
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:25.000]  left right everyone in between milo enopolis elon musk alex jones he's interviewed them all
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.640]  if you got something interesting to say rogan and his fans want to hear it but for the speech
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:36.200]  police on the left that's terrifying because they don't control it so it shouldn't exist at all
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:41.320]  white tolerate freedom when you can have power instead so stay strong joe rogan sure he will
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:47.160]  and that's what this is you have soros is funded media matters in the southern private law center
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:50.840]  that are both under criminal investigation now we told you that a year ago now it's in the news
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:58.280]  these racketeering organizations that set themselves up sanctimoniously arrogantly that
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:04.840]  they decide what you can and can't see or do and they've gone after me and help get media platform
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:09.560]  they're trying to get tucker curl city platform and now it's joe rogan who is more liberal than
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:14.040]  i'd say conservative on many issues because he doesn't have more women on a show you know you
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:21.000]  can have the lesbian uh in tech conference in san francisco good more power to you all women
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:26.760]  that's okay you can have all these women shows and all these women's groups and all these programs
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:32.760]  and have hollywood put out a directive that all the heroes be heroines women but if somebody's
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:38.280]  got a man cave show and then that's popular they want to horn it and control it we have a name
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:42.280]  for people like that they're beyond control freaks because when they become governmental
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:49.880]  they're called tyrants they're called tyrannies they're called clear and present dangers to society
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:54.680]  the media matters is a giant money laundering operation it's been above the law just like
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:58.760]  hillary and all the rest of it shows the southern prairie law center but whistleblowers are exposing
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:04.200]  both groups now now that told you months ago get ready for big political fireworks and developments
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:11.480]  over david brock shop their media matters and over at of course the uh original mothership of
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:18.680]  race baiting and race war the southern poverty loss center headed up by morris d's where you've
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:25.800]  seen basically the entire leadership the last month resigned because the chickens are coming home
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:31.720]  to roost on these organizations but just think about that i know for a fact they started hymn
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:36.440]  pecking joe rogan started telling him don't have people like me on the show joe didn't bow to that
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:41.320]  he had me back on it's his second biggest podcast ever after elon musk with over 30 million viewers
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:46.840]  they're really pissed they're upset they don't want alex jones on a platform like that reaching
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:51.320]  new people they want to be able to lie about me at nauseam like bernie sanders did yesterday
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:55.320]  and said that info wars is a white supremacist organization you'd think that actually show
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:01.160]  a clip of me saying i like hitler but they didn't know the only people that were supported by hitler
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:06.920]  again are people like george soros and again that was a long time ago he worked for hitler
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:11.640]  the point is is that if i worked for hitler you can say i worked for hitler i didn't work for hitler
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:16.440]  and then katlyn bennett they're just jealous the video's now got like what 30 million views
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:21.240]  was 20 million yesterday what is it on twitter alone like 15 million views let's look that up
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:25.880]  last night was 15 million views of them throwing her out of an event for just peacefully covering it
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:30.680]  so what's the response so we're not bullies to a woman no we just threw out the white supremacist
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:39.000]  organization info wars.com oh i'm sorry my eyes don't work anymore how many million is that 20.9
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:45.240]  million so it was 15 last night and the others were i bet 40 million views the the four platforms
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:51.640]  i saw it on so how do they respond to that i mean the super bowls got 80 million viewers well they
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:57.080]  try to ban you but see people have a hunger for this so just more pop up yeah we had 87 million
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:02.120]  views conservatively the month of the election two years ago and they respond about the platforming us
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:05.800]  well that's what we're still on 200 plus stations over a hundred cable and tv stations and huge
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:11.400]  audiences info wars.com and news wars.com but the good news is this matter as you suppress people
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:16.280]  more people stand up and more people speak out and there's no putting the genie back in the bottle
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:23.800]  that's very exciting well david rodriguez is going to be joining us coming up he's a former
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:27.400]  heavyweight champion in the world wrote by tyson's record but he's friends with him for the most

[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:34.520]  then mike adams takes over david nino rodriguez.com i'm familiar with his boxing career though i'm
[02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:39.960]  not a big sports guy that's how to follow boxing i do false with the heavyweight stuff and i've also
[02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:44.920]  seen on some national tv defending trump uh as some ufc fighters have done and gotten a lot of
[02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:52.840]  criticism but he is uniquely able to speak about this because he grew up in el paso and saw the
[02:20:52.840 --> 02:20:59.400]  devastation on the border uh and he's seen firsthand the adorn violence of gangs the sex drug and
[02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:04.440]  organ trafficking and the alarming volume of criminal behavior committed by legals on both
[02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:11.000]  sides of the u.s mexican border a teenage rodriguez uh frequent in juarez mexico well known as one
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:16.600]  of the most violent cities in the world trained as a fighter while there he became privy to the
[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:21.880]  criminal elements obviously as a box top boxery would the tactics and locations for crossing the
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:27.560]  border the message for ambushing the victims the types and styles of perpetrated crimes and even
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:33.800]  the legal recourse that was avoided when the criminals would then retreat back to mexico rodriguez
[02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:40.360]  was also a witness to the effects 2008 advances with the wall did the crime but 2017 rodriguez
[02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:45.320]  busted the border when he along with fellow republicans joe bags and a video demonstrating
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:49.560]  just how easy it is to cross the border to play that next segment rodriguez also grew up on the
[02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:57.720]  same side of the town and said the same circle of friends felt betrayed by robert pedo or roark i'm
[02:21:57.720 --> 02:22:03.640]  sorry beta or roark's actions and i'll pass it recently and pinned his open letter to him which
[02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:09.720]  he shared on facebook and went viral so david rodriguez is our guest thank you so much for
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:14.120]  coming on with us let's let's get into it i mean you live down there and trump says
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:17.960]  really dangerous on one side a lot safer on the other he says walls make people safer
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:22.840]  and the left says oh no there's nothing happening mexico is a wonderful place there's no crime
[02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:29.160]  no yeah i've seen i've seen both sides of it so i was there i grew up i grew up my whole life here
[02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:36.760]  in in el paso texas in juarez so they're the sister cities so i was privy to both sides and i uh i
[02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:41.720]  basically uh was frequent what is just like any high school kid back in the day but what made me
[02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:46.680]  different than a roark and all them see most kids went there to the strip to go party and the uh
[02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:51.400]  you know along the strip which is a lot like six street in austin but in juarez so juarez
[02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:56.280]  we had rows of bars that we would frequent every weekend and every high school kid in el paso would
[02:22:56.280 --> 02:23:02.440]  go to it um the difference with me was i was exposed to the criminal element there in in juarez so
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:07.240]  me being a fighter and going there to train and getting the sparring and the proper training
[02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:13.880]  there in mexico i knew what was going on i i was let's just say it i mean bull fighters bulls and
[02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:19.640]  fighters are like king in mexico yeah yeah i was i was uh you know i got off the hook and a lot of
[02:23:19.640 --> 02:23:25.560]  things due to being a fighter uh you know i was i was part of it you know i was part of the of the
[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:30.520]  shenanigans that they all used to do over there we all used to uh you know the big thing before the
[02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:34.680]  wall i just want to clear this up the big thing before the wall the reason i know the wall worked
[02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:41.560]  is because before the wall um the santa fe train and the uh there's a street that runs parallel to
[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:48.520]  the wall called paisano and paisano basically is right next to mexico it's the it's the street closest
[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:53.960]  to mexico and cars are you know it's it was at one time the most dangerous freeway you know in
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:58.600]  in the nation and what happens is these these kids that i used to grow up with and i knew them
[02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:04.520]  kids i would say you know teenagers and even you know in their 20s would run across the bridge
[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:09.880]  you know uh well run across the river really because there's no river it's just mud and dirt
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:15.560]  and they'd run right over there and put rocks in the street or two by fours with nails and when a car
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:20.520]  would come it would hit the two by four with nails and it would come to a complete stop or it would
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:24.600]  hit the boulders and stop and then they would run out and car jack the people take everything ahead
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:30.360]  and sometimes even murder the people so that was just the lower element of crime or they would go
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:36.600]  in hijack or uh go steal the from the containers of the santa fe train which they took so much
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:40.920]  merchandise off that train and then they'd go sell it in mexico so they would call that a hit
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:44.760]  so they would go there and take a hit off the train took a hit off someone driving their car
[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:49.880]  and this was a this was easy to do this is what they did every weekend every day really if they
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:54.920]  wanted to it was just a it was an ongoing thing and that was just a lower element of criminal
[02:24:54.920 --> 02:25:00.680]  activity uh the higher criminal activity was when 2006 when george bush started building the wall
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:06.200]  and finished it during the obama administration boy did we see uh the cartels take over that city
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:12.040]  i mean the extortion and and the uh the killings of 50 to 100 people a day it was like a war zone
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:17.880]  it was like i racked over there and el paso became you know coincidentally the safest city while
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:24.760]  juarez became the number one murder capital of the world and what's the truth behind that i mean
[02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:29.000]  we know war has one of the most dangerous cities in mexico but is the crime rate you know really
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:35.880]  low in el paso it is low in opa i mean you know there are some there is crime here but listen
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:41.320]  if over you know all the big families from the cartels and like the drug dealing families they
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:45.480]  live here in el paso you know they they don't even live there well yeah i mean they really live in
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:51.480]  what san antonio and austin now yeah you guys are getting your influence too i mean it's crazy
[02:25:51.480 --> 02:25:55.320]  and and uh i see both sides i don't even go to waters anymore you know i don't know if you go to
[02:25:55.320 --> 02:26:02.680]  five star hotel in san diego or austin or anywhere it's like mainly rich rich rich mexicans and some
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:06.840]  of them aren't in the cartels but it's just a fact they'll tell you no we've all left mexico so what
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:11.400]  you said is true yeah absolutely nobody wants to live there you know and when the killings were
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:15.880]  happening it turned into a ghost town they started bringing all their businesses over here because
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:21.000]  everyone in waters was getting extorted so when you're getting extorted so they were having like
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:28.120]  gangs come into places of business or restaurants or bars i i lost nine friends from 2006 to 2013
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:33.080]  wow that had that had restaurants and bars over there so i know how dangerous it is and that's
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:37.160]  not happening even though safe zone like cancun they're robbing restaurants every night shaking
[02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:43.560]  them down i wouldn't even go there i i don't even feel like uh you know i i wouldn't go to
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:48.280]  mexico right now i don't you know right now in the frantera which is what is that was the most
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:52.600]  dangerous place that's like the coveted holy grail of mexico that's what every cartel wants to control
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:58.760]  and basically um you know with trump building the wall i know firsthand it works because
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:03.960]  imagine the bloodshed that would have spilled over into a parcel if that wall wasn't there during
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:07.800]  that period of time when all the killings were happening it would have been horrific and clearly
[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:12.600]  as you said it's exponentially getting worse we have giant caravan slamming in suddenly democrats
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:18.040]  will put the clip when we come back suddenly cori booker and and others say oh no it is a crisis
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:23.240]  don't dump them in our city so latin america not just mexico is collapsing and they're trying to tell
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:28.600]  trump don't stop it yeah it's it's all lies and to see bethler orork who's from a hometown
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:34.760]  sell out to this idea which he knows he knows damn well that that wall has helped and and
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:38.120]  there and let me let me clear up another thing too there are many mexican people when trump came
[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:45.160]  to the rally here in alpaso there was 30 to 40 upside made 45 000 people at his rally when
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:50.120]  bethler orork i know for a fact the media even lied here in alpaso bethler orork maybe have three
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:54.360]  to four thousand people where trump had about we were there maybe maybe two thousand we were there
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:59.240]  and about half the folks coming up for trump were his spanning uh so again this idea that
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:03.880]  trump's a racist i mean he's really popular he like twice as popular with latinos i've read
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:09.160]  another republicans it's just delusions that the media's the the media's spinning and people are
[02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:13.800]  buying into this and feeding off it and propelling this idea that he's racist and i ask people all
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:19.000]  the time g help me understand why you think he's racist they none of them ever have an answer
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:23.880]  none of them ever have an answer except for what cnn spins or what the mainstream media spins to them
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:28.360]  but none of them have any own their own formulated uh you know they've never done any of their own
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:32.840]  research to figure out who this guy really is uh what what his policies really mean none of them
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:37.800]  fact basic fact check anything let's talk about that emotional david rodriguez former heavy

[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:48.680]  in what he breaks down but i wanted to play a clip of the governor of california newson also
[02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:54.680]  mr potato head uh cory booker saying oh no trump you don't take these people that have
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:58.600]  overwhelmed the courts overwhelmed the jails overwhelmed the detention facilities and dump
[02:33:58.600 --> 02:34:04.440]  them here you dump them in in in conservative areas because this is too dangerous so the fact
[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:12.440]  that there's no logic and the hypocrisy is like turned up to 11 here it is it's illegal it's immoral
[02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:21.720]  it's unethical um it's sophomoric uh it's petulant and it's par for the course
[02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:28.040]  and then we have the clip of potato head coming up here in just a moment where he says the same
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:34.600]  thing so look at the straight they advertise there are no illegal aliens no borders no walls no
[02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:39.800]  usa at all you've got central america south america collapsing into mexico more caravans
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:44.200]  breaking over the mexican border violently attacking people even the washington post and the
[02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:49.080]  senate admits that they're shipping kidnapped kids and that are just disappearing but we're
[02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:53.640]  told david rodriguez somebody who's grown up in alpaso texas and witnessed both sides of this
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:58.280]  that it's trump's fault and that if he dares bring some of these people that he's ordered under
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:05.640]  law to release that somehow this is immoral and dangerous what he's doing no let me let me just
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:10.600]  tell you this right now i'm getting intel from uh i have a lot of friends that are border patrol
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:16.760]  agents in this area and you know as you know the checkpoints are all closed down uh because they're
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:21.320]  they're dealing with such an influx of uh of immigrants coming here and these aren't people
[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:25.640]  that are just from from mexico this is you know as you know as well you say it all the time south
[02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:32.760]  america africa um they're all here and and they're getting 1800 to 2000 people a day that's how serious
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:37.000]  this is i mean we're being bombarded right now here at the border and they're having to let
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:42.600]  these people go into general population they're letting anywhere from 200 to 500 people a day
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:46.120]  from what i understand the numbers they're just letting them go into general population
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:51.080]  and these people of you know these aren't just people with kids and you know families these
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:55.800]  are grown men that we don't know what their their objective is to come here we don't know i mean a
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:35:59.160]  lot of these people grew up in crime in the community you got to understand like what is
[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:05.080]  these third world countries these people grow up uh with crime so do you think they're coming here
[02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:09.400]  to america to sack groceries and to to work at albert sins or something like that these people
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:13.400]  are coming here they know one thing they know how to make quick hits i know these people they
[02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:18.040]  know how to make a quick hit do it do a drug deal rob a house do whatever and have money to live on
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:21.640]  for a couple weeks that's what's coming over here so these democrats saying all this stuff
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:27.640]  about it's it's inhumane and unfair the only thing that's inhumane is the is the sex trafficking
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:32.280]  and uh you know the people crossing here that have to go for ranges of miles of miles of miles
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:37.400]  without any food or water and being uh you know the women being assaulted the kids being used
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:42.200]  for like i said sex trafficking and that's what's inhumane the wall will stop all that well it's
[02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:48.360]  like you said uh they claim that none of this is a problem but all the democrats certainly
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:51.800]  don't want to live in mexico they don't live in guatemala they won't live in any of those places
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:57.800]  how do they say a month ago there there are no crises there are no migrants there is no
[02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:02.520]  caravan and now say okay it's here it's a crisis and trump created it don't they know we have
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:07.800]  memories what do you think the democrats are thinking i you know i don't know i have a lot
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:12.920]  of liberal friends here in alpaso and in and all over texas that uh claim that they're now
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:17.080]  socialists and in this and that and and uh i i can't understand their way of thinking to be
[02:37:17.080 --> 02:37:22.840]  honest to you to me this is a completely logical argument and uh our argument is completely logical
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:26.040]  compared to theirs this is completely emotional i don't think they have any experience on the
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:30.600]  border like i do to understand really what's going on and how severe this problem really is
[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:35.960]  this is a national emergency and let's say the the the immigrants are pouring over here in droves
[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:41.960]  and they're coming here well who they can't just be coming in caravans by the thousand someone has
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:46.280]  to be funding this because there's no way that these people are just making their way up by the
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:52.120]  thousands with no food no water and it's on record it's the u.n and george soros you they get us
[02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:56.760]  taxpayer money at the u.n and then and then soros gives them a credit card that the three thousand
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:02.120]  dollars on it their names not even on it that's in royers they just give them free money yeah they
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:07.000]  need people need to understand what's really going on i'm right here in ground zero you know this is
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:10.920]  happening in my backyard i mean i can go just down the street throw a rock and hit mexico i know
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:15.720]  what's going on this is severe and even check this out this is what's crazy even the mexicans in
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:19.960]  mexico and juarez believe it or not you'll be surprised they don't even want them there either
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:23.880]  all the immigrants that are pouring up they don't even want them there in juarez i have friends that
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:27.080]  by the way what you said is very savvy i want to get into that mexico is on the high end of
[02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:31.720]  third world countries it's a heavenly place compared to venezuela and all these other places and
[02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:35.640]  every mexican i talk to is i like mexico and i'm down there just getting too dangerous they all
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:41.960]  agree with me they've i've got to have papers to go down there the you know yeah it's it's it's it's
[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:48.120]  absurd i mean and like i said they just i just think people want a reason to hate trump and they'll
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:52.520]  just do and i think what liberals are doing now is just doing everything in spite of trump if that
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:57.400]  makes sense they don't even you know they're just doing you know they heard what he said his rhetoric
[02:38:57.400 --> 02:39:00.200]  or whatever and he said they're not sending us their best they're sending us their worst the
[02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:03.640]  criminals isn't that well that's you know there are some good families coming here i'm not going
[02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:07.400]  to lie to you there are good families that want to come here and work into that but there's many
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:12.280]  many families or people or grown men that are single and and kids coming here that don't want to work
[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:17.000]  they want to come in and and i know i knew them i knew them back in the day they want to car jack
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:21.560]  they want a house jack they want to steal let's just say the skills they know is going under game
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:28.360]  control and carrying out kidnapping carjacking murder murder for hire uh drug dealing and that's
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:32.760]  why they're fleeing latin america is because it's broken down the society let me ask you this question
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:39.000]  what do you expect gut level if we allow the collapse the border which has already pretty
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.240]  much happened trump's just trying to stabilize it what do you think's going to happen versus
[02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:48.840]  what the democrats thinks going to happen it's i think it's i think it's going to be lawlessness
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:53.240]  i think uh you know if they allow these people to vote i think it's the democrats are going to
[02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:59.320]  win it over i think it's a complete radical agenda i agree with you on that i think that um
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:04.360]  the people that are coming here have really no job skills and and another thing i think of two
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:10.120]  hours i'm sure you're on the same page with this as well as what happens in in in in four to five
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:15.720]  years when the the lower jobs or or uh the jobs are taking getting taken over by ai you know i just
[02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:19.000]  went to mcdonald's the other day i don't eat that often but one of the other day you have
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:23.720]  computer screens now where they don't even you don't even have a no exactly humans are being
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:28.360]  replaced and then we import a giant unskilled population yeah and so what's what are they
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:33.080]  going to be doing they're just robbing people crime is just the influx of crime is going to go up
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:37.400]  that's the smartest thing that's been said in about a year here is all the studies show
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:42.360]  cheap labor is about to become worthless why the hell would we be importing giant amounts of
[02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:48.680]  unskilled labor it makes zero sense to me it makes zero sense and uh and then another thing too that
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:56.360]  that um the the lady here that uh i think her name is bronica eskibar um the the uh the she ran
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:41:00.840]  african congress anyway she shut down some of the facilities here so we can't even house the people
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:05.800]  here and i'll pass on now so the now that that's making them release them into the public well
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:08.920]  that's another point you live down there people are blaming trump and i'll blame trump what he's
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:14.440]  wrong it's federal law they're closing facilities he can't get laws passed that he's under orders
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:19.320]  under law to release these people it's it's insanity what are we gonna do these people
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:24.120]  as he's showing that picture right there they i'm telling you most of them have no job skills
[02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:28.120]  people think that they're going to go into construction and do yard work and this and that
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:32.600]  no they're just sitting around they're homeless they want us to take care of them they want to
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:36.600]  come in and do a get on the government programs and they want to take advantage of the system but
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:41.640]  listen if you were in their situation wouldn't you do the same thing i mean let's be clear this is
[02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:49.160]  the most uneducated lowest iq most criminal most desperate of all of central and south america
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:55.160]  pouring in the very worst not all of them but but but i mean the mexico admits this is the most
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:42:00.200]  criminal element ever coming in even to mexico yeah and and let me tell you my friends that
[02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:04.280]  are down there and why does they call and tell me uh they they own they have businesses down there
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:08.840]  and and and they tell me that they don't want them there they're having a hard time with this uh
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:12.040]  that you know that they're like listen man we don't want them here as much as you guys don't
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:16.200]  want them there so that's an example i started some federalis in cancun last time i was there
[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:20.040]  and they said listen el chopo kept control of things and kept the crime down he said now
[02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:24.520]  we have central american gangs that are fearless and don't care and are shooting everything up
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:28.680]  and killing police every night and they don't care they want to die how do you deal with something
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:33.640]  five times crazier than what's been in mexico you know exactly and you got to remember this too
[02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:38.520]  because the kids that you know i know this from what it's a lot of the kids they become sasadios
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:43.560]  or cicadas when they're young and that means uh killers train stay there tell us about the real

[02:46:29.320 --> 02:46:33.560]  hallucinogenic it's so good in my view i'm not a medical statement here but let me tell you something
[02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:38.280]  i eat five culottes of krill oil before i go to bed i'm seeing santa claus that night
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:49.400]  so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:53.720]  but you notice i just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie to you i just
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:47:11.880]  can't do it you're listening to the alex jones show i know david nino rodriguez
[02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:17.720]  taking joe biggs down the border david nino rodriguez.com's website
[02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:23.880]  nino boxer on twitter but we need to come down there with him thanks for joining us we've got
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:31.240]  coming up mike adams hosting the fourth hour in the war room with oan shroyer but i really
[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:35.880]  appreciate david's courage because he's not making a big deal with this but our people even down in
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:40.280]  that area get harassed now by the cartels and others if they speak out against it we know
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:44.600]  thousands of newspapers been attacked hundreds of reporters killed the last 20 years the numbers
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:49.720]  have admitted dead according to the state department the last decade 200 000 of course there's millions
[02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:54.920]  that are missing some came north some disappeared but when he talks about organ harvesting or child
[02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:59.080]  trafficking that's confirmed but it's back of the newspaper and then the democrats
[02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:07.720]  shit up there and say that trying to control our borders insane but when i fly down to port
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:12.680]  of arta i love mexico great food great people when there's not the criminals around they're
[02:48:12.680 --> 02:48:18.040]  really nice people or the criminals i go down there and they say what hotel you stand at they
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:22.040]  check it you better the day you leave you better be leaving or they find you or arrest you that's
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:28.360]  their country mexico has the strongest border rules in this hemisphere but that's okay that's
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:33.720]  their country why can't we have any but but i was interrupting you sir you've got the floor now
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:38.440]  get into what you talked about the assassins how young they are from what you're saying it's it's
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:42.840]  it's devolving it's getting worse it's spilling over that's why there's a grown-up in el paso lived
[02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:49.640]  it been a heavyweight champion the world but on both sides the border please continue yeah what
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:53.880]  i was going to say is uh and i've i've i've known a lot of these kids and my friends you know the
[02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:59.640]  friends that i grew up around we we circled these we were around these kids growing up and and like
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:05.640]  i said going down there to fight and and you know partying and going on the back streets and the
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:11.240]  mariscal area and the and you know the whole area man and and you meet these kids that are you know
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:15.000]  they get these kids when they're about you know the kids start running the streets when they're
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:19.640]  about in that poverty-stricken area which is most of what is kids start running the streets at about
[02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:26.120]  nine ten eleven years old if not earlier um it's real easy to single out these kids and find them
[02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:34.280]  and start giving them drugs and start showing them a kind of like brotherly love or or fatherly love
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:39.960]  or like a family unit type love that they don't have at home and once you start giving them drugs
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:45.320]  and giving them a little bit of cash here in there they'll eat it's very easy for them to start uh
[02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:50.120]  you know to start pulling strings and have them kill people for you and they'll do it for a hundred
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:54.440]  bucks two hundred bucks it's not a lot of money and i mean if you want and i'm telling you at that
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:58.360]  level over there they'll do it for for a hundred to a hundred fifty two hundred bucks they'll kill
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:03.160]  somebody and or you just feed them with drugs kind of like the prostitution in in america or
[02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:07.560]  something like that it's just as bad in mexico and money goes a lot further over there so
[02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:12.360]  they start these kids out really young to affect their consciousness into where they
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:16.440]  they have no conscience when they're doing this they just they just know that the love they're
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:20.520]  getting from their superiors or the people that are handling them or like you would like to say
[02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:26.920]  like handlers people that uh are controlling them um are giving them you know that uh that uh
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:30.920]  well let me raise this point to you because the us has had its own history of violence people kill
[02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:34.680]  each other everybody does it but there's almost something where they play on the manliness or
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:39.480]  the machoness of latin america where particular people aren't on average afraid to die either
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:43.880]  people are subservient or they're ready to die and it just seems like there's just an endless line
[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:49.640]  of people ready to die ready to kill absolutely over there it's it's it's it's horrific man it's
[02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:54.280]  it's really big over there the whole mochismo thing in in in el paso and in juarez you know that's
[02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:58.120]  half the reason i took up boxing at such a young age it's it's uh you know the biggest sports here
[02:50:58.120 --> 02:51:03.640]  in el paso are soccer and boxing you know so um yeah especially in juarez man everyone goes to the
[02:51:03.640 --> 02:51:06.760]  boxing gym at a young age and starts learning how to box that's how i got acquainted with these
[02:51:06.760 --> 02:51:12.200]  kids that's so young um and uh yeah it's you know they they get this kind of like fatherly or
[02:51:12.200 --> 02:51:16.920]  brotherly love from these older gang members or there's nothing wrong with the masculinity but we
[02:51:16.920 --> 02:51:22.440]  need good men in control of that so where are the good men where's the vacuum now in latin america
[02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:27.720]  are it's hard it's it's hard because you got to understand it's hard to make money over there the
[02:51:27.720 --> 02:51:32.040]  way to make money over there's drugs that's the fastest way and if you have a business you're
[02:51:32.040 --> 02:51:36.520]  most likely gonna get extorted if you're if you're making good money and and and i'm going back to
[02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:40.200]  what i was talking before about the extortion the way that happens is people have businesses
[02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:44.600]  restaurants bars something like that and gangs will come in and say hey listen we'll offer you
[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:48.760]  protection if you give us 20 percent of your profits monthly well then what happened what
[02:51:48.760 --> 02:51:55.080]  started happening in 2006 2013 is multiple gangs started coming into the same businesses and offering
[02:51:55.080 --> 02:51:59.240]  their their protection or whatever and demanding payment so now the people owning the businesses
[02:51:59.240 --> 02:52:03.640]  were just slaves and just paying off gangs so that's why they wanted to come to america so bad
[02:52:03.640 --> 02:52:07.240]  because because they were just basically and that's what collapses tyranny whether it's
[02:52:07.240 --> 02:52:13.160]  communism or radical islam or these drug gangs they make everybody slaves exactly and so that's
[02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:17.320]  what was going on so now you had multiple you had the body was tecas you had the zetas the
[02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:22.280]  personas you had all these different types of gangs coming in demanding payment and so what
[02:52:22.280 --> 02:52:25.320]  you know so what are you supposed to do when you own a business and you're having to pay
[02:52:25.880 --> 02:52:31.400]  you know five or six different gangs to just just make you give up and that's why civilization
[02:52:31.400 --> 02:52:35.240]  collapsed it's not there isn't know-how in industry it's everybody's getting shut down
[02:52:35.240 --> 02:52:39.240]  to the best defense being shaken down is either move or give up right and that's why all the
[02:52:39.240 --> 02:52:43.080]  businesses came to opasso and listen i i have nothing against that they're doing what it's
[02:52:43.080 --> 02:52:47.880]  doing good for the economy but look that's just far and few between that those are the good people
[02:52:47.880 --> 02:52:52.040]  coming here so let me ask you this thing what does trump what does mexico need to do because here's the
[02:52:52.040 --> 02:52:55.800]  deal i don't want to have war with syria i was against that i was against the iraq war i was
[02:52:55.800 --> 02:53:01.800]  against all but you've got venezuela communist run a dictator a thousand people starving a day
[02:53:01.800 --> 02:53:08.200]  of a week it's collapsed into central america the un set up bases to flood us out of venezuela
[02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:13.560]  and that is on our doorstep and they are saying they're doing that brazil's called up its military
[02:53:13.560 --> 02:53:18.440]  columbia has to stop it we haven't i don't want to invade venezuela i'm just saying it's in our
[02:53:18.440 --> 02:53:22.600]  national interest to stop the collapsing border and it goes right back to mexico
[02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:29.960]  a mexico has to take control of what the problem and help us there's no doubt about it and you know
[02:53:29.960 --> 02:53:35.880]  i you know and this is funny that you're saying that because um i i came up with a good idea actually
[02:53:35.880 --> 02:53:41.000]  a friend and i came up with a good idea when you cross over to mexico um they give this called
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:45.720]  crossing fees okay so you got to go there and you got to pay like you know two three dollars to go
[02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:49.400]  over to mexico and then you got to come back here and it's in it's like a dollar fifty two dollars
[02:53:49.400 --> 02:53:53.960]  to come back over right those are called crossing fees well what i don't understand is why doesn't
[02:53:53.960 --> 02:54:00.040]  trump hire the crossing fees for people coming back over to the states or going over there however
[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:04.200]  it works out to where that can actually fund the wall that can build the wall because you've got
[02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:07.880]  hundreds and thousands of people crossing here daily well your way ahead of your way ahead of
[02:54:07.880 --> 02:54:13.880]  that that is actually trump's plan is they do want some type of crossing fee oh okay so there you go
[02:54:13.880 --> 02:54:17.560]  that that would be beautiful that would work because that essentially you're really having
[02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:21.640]  mexico pay for the wall if you do that well think about this you've got all over wherever you live
[02:54:21.640 --> 02:54:25.320]  toll roads to get somewhere quicker you don't have a toll road coming into the country that that's
[02:54:25.320 --> 02:54:30.840]  insane yeah yeah there's free bridges you gotta remember that too there's a free bridge and and
[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:35.720]  the free bridge most people cross through the free bridge uh it's just it's just uh it it's just
[02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:40.920]  and it's like the floodgates are open and everybody and everybody can come here but like i said the
[02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:45.560]  people that are the the miles that are done with the the thousands of miles that have no wall
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:49.160]  and the people that are just flooding over here i'm telling you opasso is getting about
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:53.720]  two thousand a day right now and we're releasing two to five hundred into the general population
[02:54:53.720 --> 02:54:58.520]  right now and i know you earlier but jim acosta went down to opasso and he said oh look there's
[02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:03.000]  a wall no crime see no problem here but the talk to the locals they say no once they built this
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:08.520]  crime went down yeah it did but then you got to remember too tunneling that's a big issue so i
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:12.520]  would like to know the one question i have for trump is how are you going to handle the tunneling
[02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:18.200]  because most drugs are sent are crossed over through tunneling and they have you know an
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:22.760]  elaborate what would you say i'm not a hard-ass but if you put the marines on the border it's
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:27.400]  constitutional to shoot people crossing not women and children but cartels digging under and it's a
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:31.720]  mill that's a mill you start killing them they're probably gonna stop yeah i agree with you on that
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:36.440]  there has to be ways we have to set up these kind of boundaries we got to take a harder road to deal
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:41.080]  with this but mexico has to be responsible for what's happening because they're not cooperating
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:44.840]  they've never had to cooperate because they've had everything so what do we do the same thing
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:48.680]  trump just did cutting the funding those central america tell mexico you better do this
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:53.160]  yeah they they have to man there's no doubt about it i just you know everyone says the
[02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:58.600]  wall doesn't work but i think the statistics on that is like 90 percent lower illegal immigration
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:04.120]  wherever there's a wall so to me it's it's like a no-brainer this works it is gonna at least slow
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:08.840]  down the immigration the legal immigration it creates a big speed bump at least it's a huge
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:13.480]  speed bump you know it's a huge speed bump and you're not gonna have families coming over trying
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:17.400]  to hike up a 30-foot wall you know i mean you're not gonna have you're not gonna be sex trapping
[02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:21.560]  as much now the problem with the sex wrapping is they can do the tunneling systems and that's
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:25.640]  where you know there has to be some kind of technology set forth to where they can intercept
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:29.960]  the time i just think you catch somebody smuggling the kid and it's not your aunt or uncle or mom or
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:34.360]  dad we just have a summary execution which i'm not a for police state but they're the one smuggling
[02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:38.840]  kids in mass they admit are going to sex slavery and i say you catch somebody without a kid that
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:43.640]  isn't their family i say i say they get a quick trial and they get executed and that's huge right
[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:47.880]  now and in fact one of the border patrol agents told me that right now there's so many people
[02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:52.440]  coming here claiming that they have these kids and they're not even their kids they're not their
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:56.760]  kids they're they're basically well i'm gonna come back i'm really impressed with your work
[02:56:56.760 --> 02:57:00.440]  david i want to get you back on soon let's do five more minutes on what you think trump should do
[02:57:00.440 --> 02:57:03.960]  and just other observations and please come back on all the shows and mine as well and listen folks
[02:57:03.960 --> 02:57:08.760]  i'm not a police state guy i believe the constitution bill of rights we got this big fancy egalitarian
[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:15.800]  system you break down civilization you lose law and order and so in between the point of losing
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:20.360]  law and order and civilization once your legs cut off you got to put a tourniquet on it and i was
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:24.520]  telling you the stuff at the border is so out of control even obama's former head of eyes obama's
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:29.880]  had a dhs they both say triple the worst it's ever been totally insane our borders basically
[02:57:29.880 --> 02:57:33.960]  collapsed and then trump's the trader we're trying to block it if anything trump has not enough
[02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:38.040]  forget that law enforcement emergency declare a national emergencies commander in chief put the
[02:57:38.040 --> 02:57:41.640]  military on the border and start killing the cartel leaders just wipe them out
[02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:50.200]  it's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for

[03:01:08.520 --> 03:01:12.920]  i was a hometown hero here when i was fighting i carried a lot of clout in my boxing in the

[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:31.800]  just that in itself me being against the wall people don't understand they think it's like
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:36.600]  their outlook that the the hispanic cultures outlook or the mexican people here their outlook
[03:01:36.600 --> 03:01:42.360]  on the wall is that trump just wants to build something to stamp his name on it and uh and
[03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:47.080]  the things he said about mexican people are disgraceful and and he doesn't care for the mexican
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:51.080]  people they think like beto or work they think it's like cheering for the dalas cowboys i don't a
[03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:55.080]  lot of people to here don't even understand his policies they just know that he's against the
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:02:00.520]  wall and he's against trump and in hurrah hip hip hooray for for beto and let's all go for him
[03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:05.560]  he's the cheerleader we need right now and i'm the guy that's that doesn't follow those footsteps
[03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:10.680]  i i'm completely against it uh everywhere i go people know i'm open about this people don't
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:15.800]  really come from me in person but on facebook oh my gosh i get you know hundreds of emails and and
[03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:20.120]  and direct messages people tell me how much they hate me and and i'm a sellout to the mexican

[03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:29.960]  everybody wants to get to this side of the border the idea that anybody's bad
[03:02:29.960 --> 03:02:34.360]  trump gets it we have to have that symbol and that security that we're a country it's okay to exist
[03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:40.520]  yeah every other country has it and mexico has it i don't understand how white we can't have
[03:02:40.520 --> 03:02:44.280]  we're the greatest nation on earth and we can't protect our borders that's insanity man that's
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:48.600]  just what do you think when you saw the footage of the of the tens of thousands of breaking over
[03:02:48.600 --> 03:02:54.840]  guatemala running over police that's dangerous and they've got Mexico has 25 foot fences it wasn't

[03:06:30.920 --> 03:06:35.560]  by the way roger stone's gonna be joining us tomorrow and i want to speak about this right now
[03:06:35.560 --> 03:06:44.120]  i've gotten a bunch of calls because roger went on xm radio last week and kind of needled me and
[03:06:44.120 --> 03:06:50.600]  said yeah alex didn't sell him a t-shirt alex hadn't really been having me on and i'm a little
[03:06:50.600 --> 03:06:57.160]  disappointed in alex and i just think that's roger and the publicity hounded him uh because
[03:06:57.160 --> 03:07:03.800]  roger knows damn well that as soon as he got that gag order he stopped talking to me and so i sent
[03:07:03.800 --> 03:07:10.440]  him a message over the weekend and i said what the hell is this and he said oh i'm just joking you
[03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:15.080]  know uh i had talked to lawyers for last month and a half and and i think i'm able to actually come
[03:07:15.080 --> 03:07:20.600]  on your show so i'll come on thursday with a bunch of exclusive stuff but not about uh
[03:07:20.600 --> 03:07:24.200]  muller or his trial and i told him roger my listeners want to jump off a cliff
[03:07:24.920 --> 03:07:28.920]  when you talk about muller or russia gate they know it's bull but i said why don't you come on
[03:07:28.920 --> 03:07:32.920]  about jfk you're an expert on that why don't you come on about trump why don't you come on about
[03:07:32.920 --> 03:07:37.800]  the border you're a good political pundit that's why i hired you so i'll make the statement now
[03:07:39.480 --> 03:07:43.720]  i hired roger stone i guess about a year and a half ago or a little longer
[03:07:43.720 --> 03:07:46.920]  to be a political pundit and i like roger as a person he's a smart guy
[03:07:48.200 --> 03:07:52.680]  and even when i wanted to do political stunts that weren't deceptive he'd say that goes too far
[03:07:52.680 --> 03:07:59.240]  so i thought well this must be a dirty trick to say that roger stone is the king of dirty tricks
[03:07:59.240 --> 03:08:02.760]  because compared to other political operatives this guy is as clean as a driven stone
[03:08:02.760 --> 03:08:06.120]  he kind of rebels to them calling him a villain he likes it he thinks it's sexy
[03:08:07.400 --> 03:08:09.160]  but then i saw that clip of him on that show
[03:08:11.240 --> 03:08:14.760]  no one oh alex is so successful he needs to make a donation to my fun blah blah blah
[03:08:14.760 --> 03:08:18.520]  and i just thought mainly as a joke maybe it's roger being a little bit weird
[03:08:18.520 --> 03:08:23.320]  but but but what irritated me about it was i probably sent the guy 20 tax and he'd respond
[03:08:23.320 --> 03:08:28.440]  back to him he just said i can't talk to him under a gag order and then he's on an espn show
[03:08:28.440 --> 03:08:33.720]  talking about me so then the wheels start to turn in the head well what's going on there
[03:08:33.720 --> 03:08:37.880]  why why would you not talk to me but you talk to some other show uh so that's it roger hasn't
[03:08:37.880 --> 03:08:43.320]  worked here in months i think he's overall a good guy i'm overall a good guy none of us are perfect
[03:08:44.040 --> 03:08:50.440]  but i hired him to be a pundit and if he did anything i don't like it was recommend
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:57.240]  Jerome Corsi to work here i've known Corsi for 18 19 years and never did anything but
[03:08:57.240 --> 03:09:02.520]  be nice that guy was all the one way street and uh he and larry claimant have sued me
[03:09:05.960 --> 03:09:11.960]  because roger's telling him getting in the middle of it and then seeing statements by Corsi out there
[03:09:13.320 --> 03:09:20.200]  about how we were all trying to get how we were in contact with assange and all this crap
[03:09:20.200 --> 03:09:25.240]  and and i know i was there assange wouldn't give us the back of his hand he wouldn't
[03:09:25.240 --> 03:09:29.480]  he was the responsive talk to the hand and i'm still not against assange but he was the cutesy
[03:09:29.480 --> 03:09:34.200]  that on the guardian in the new york times the washington post and cnn show so you know the
[03:09:34.200 --> 03:09:39.640]  idea of that all because muller was breathing down of course he's neck that he would then sue me
[03:09:39.640 --> 03:09:46.680]  when i gave the guy severance pay and everything is just creepy so i have a new rule you ever worked
[03:09:46.680 --> 03:09:53.080]  in dc i'm not hiring you i've always been in texas i've never been about la or dc or new york
[03:09:53.080 --> 03:09:56.120]  nothing against you if you come from there but if you come from the power structure
[03:09:56.120 --> 03:10:00.040]  i don't care if you're roger stone or your own course or nobody i'm not working with you how's
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:07.080]  that sound i'm in texas i work with regular normal people not swamp creatures and i'm not involved
[03:10:07.080 --> 03:10:12.360]  in any of this crap i'm having roger on tomorrow look forward to talking to him it's just that you
[03:10:12.360 --> 03:10:18.440]  get you step in this crap you get the smell of it on you and i'm talking about the swamp not roger
[03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:23.720]  because man the only power i got in this world it's not a straight shooter it's all i got
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:29.240]  it's all i came into this world with is i'm a straight shooter there's no subterfuge there's
[03:10:29.240 --> 03:10:35.960]  no macchio valley with me other than i understand macchio valley and crap i'm from texas i'm a real
[03:10:35.960 --> 03:10:41.400]  texan i'm what folks talked about texas used to be and everybody better figure that out that
[03:10:42.360 --> 03:10:46.760]  i'm straight up and i don't screw somebody over just because i've got an advantage over them
[03:10:46.760 --> 03:10:51.480]  them all i do is get people out of my way that are screwing with me and my mission
[03:10:53.080 --> 03:10:57.560]  so uh that's what i have to say about that the young turks put out this huge lying report when
[03:10:57.560 --> 03:11:01.880]  they take gulf war dictator money and all this crap about oh me and roger and our dirty tricks and
[03:11:01.880 --> 03:11:07.160]  how we stormed the young turks show and and i hear watching and i almost played it the other day
[03:11:07.160 --> 03:11:13.640]  my cat was taking over four minutes almost played it i was like why even play it almost every comment
[03:11:13.640 --> 03:11:19.880]  hates them every comment sees through them they they said he stormed our stage broke into our building
[03:11:21.080 --> 03:11:25.480]  they didn't tell you it was the rnc a parking garage with plastic put around it with huge air
[03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:30.200]  conditioners blowing i love those like 60 degrees and we're walking by they go hey come on come on
[03:11:30.200 --> 03:11:34.440]  as producers i go i'll be back in 10 minutes it was a buffet i can do 100 interviews a day if i
[03:11:34.440 --> 03:11:39.320]  want went did a few interviews walk back by steering a break oh hey how you doing they'd
[03:11:39.320 --> 03:11:44.760]  blow up make a deal of it and then point your finger at roger and say he took over he was 30 feet away
[03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:50.360]  he never even gotten near their stage it was stages everywhere it was people milling around
[03:11:50.360 --> 03:11:58.360]  like at a mall imagine you know like mall kiosk but he acts like oh we want on his show oh we want
[03:11:58.360 --> 03:12:03.800]  to be a guy that takes money from gulf war gulf dictators we want to be a guy that takes soros
[03:12:03.800 --> 03:12:08.360]  money we want to take a guy that betrayed bernie sanders and sold out to hillary we we need on
[03:12:08.360 --> 03:12:14.520]  his failed show hey sink and that chicken neck woman on your show you have the stink of failure
[03:12:14.520 --> 03:12:22.280]  about you and dishonor we don't want anywhere near you so your little pipe dream that me and
[03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:27.160]  roger and our dirty tricks have had some falling out there are no dirty tricks by me i never saw
[03:12:27.160 --> 03:12:35.080]  dirty tricks by roger stone and i do think it's a little weird what he said on that xm show uh but
[03:12:35.080 --> 03:12:40.920]  you know i do weird stuff on air as well but it doesn't matter i have a rule it's discriminatory
[03:12:41.800 --> 03:12:47.720]  i don't care if you're black or white jewish or german chinese or japanese or mexican if you've
[03:12:47.720 --> 03:12:52.920]  worked in the swamp in washington dc or you work for hollywood any meaning of a way your ass ain't
[03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:58.120]  getting hired here and not within a thousand yards of me because every time i get crapped on and and
[03:12:58.120 --> 03:13:03.160]  stabbed in the back i don't think people in the swamp can even help it it's like congressman
[03:13:03.160 --> 03:13:08.600]  goman from texas said to sundar pachai a few months ago when i was there when pachai's lying
[03:13:08.600 --> 03:13:12.360]  to their face about citizenship he goes you know i don't think you know the light if you saw it
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:18.760]  because you've never seen it so let me get this straight for dc i don't want your dc i don't want
[03:13:18.760 --> 03:13:24.520]  your power i don't want to be a bureaucrat i don't want to hang around with your so-called elites i

[03:20:24.440 --> 03:20:29.080]  all right everybody thanks for continuing with us here mike adam's stepping in for the fourth
[03:20:29.080 --> 03:20:35.720]  hour of the alex jones show today i'm not in the studio but i'm definitely in the thick of things
[03:20:35.720 --> 03:20:40.600]  in terms of covering the important news as you know i tend to cover health medicine health
[03:20:40.600 --> 03:20:46.360]  freedom nutrition food freedom those kinds of angles some science as well and there's there's a
[03:20:46.360 --> 03:20:50.840]  really important story that came across my desk this morning that i went ahead and wrote up and
[03:20:50.840 --> 03:20:58.280]  posted on my website natural news it's about the fact that or if you're an organ donor you need to
[03:20:58.280 --> 03:21:03.480]  know that new science has shown that even after you're pronounced dead you're actually still alive
[03:21:03.480 --> 03:21:10.200]  and still conscious and this science this was covered by fox news by the way dr sam parnia
[03:21:10.200 --> 03:21:16.280]  is a researcher he studies consciousness after official death what happens is when you're an
[03:21:16.280 --> 03:21:22.200]  organ donor these surgeons they want your organs because that's the profit center for the hospital
[03:21:22.200 --> 03:21:27.400]  so the minute your heart stops beating they pronounce you dead boom i guess what your brain
[03:21:27.400 --> 03:21:34.680]  is conscious alive aware for several minutes after your heart stops beating you are feeling
[03:21:34.680 --> 03:21:40.840]  things you just can't move you can't scream as these surgeons cut into your body and start
[03:21:40.840 --> 03:21:45.640]  ripping your organs out of your torso i don't i'm not trying to be the graphic here but this is
[03:21:45.640 --> 03:21:52.840]  what they do okay and you you can feel everything you are aware you are awake you are alive even
[03:21:52.840 --> 03:21:58.840]  though they've pronounced you dead and the way that these scientists know this is because they've
[03:21:58.840 --> 03:22:04.200]  had they've documented numerous cases of heart attack patients whose hearts stopped beating
[03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:10.040]  and then they were saved a couple of minutes later you know that the heart came back they
[03:22:10.040 --> 03:22:14.840]  were given cpr what have you different things they came back and those patients were able to
[03:22:14.840 --> 03:22:21.400]  accurately describe exactly what was said in the room by the doctors they were able to describe
[03:22:21.400 --> 03:22:27.800]  everything that was happening around them they had accurate memories of of the feeling what was you
[03:22:27.800 --> 03:22:32.600]  know how they were being poked how what was happening with the cpr for example they knew
[03:22:32.600 --> 03:22:36.920]  exactly what was going on and they were able to relate that accurately to researchers after their
[03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:45.880]  official quote death what this means is that if you are an organ donor and i understand that maybe
[03:22:45.880 --> 03:22:50.920]  you want to help people you you've told you've been told that this is the compassionate thing to do
[03:22:50.920 --> 03:22:56.840]  you want to give up your organs to save someone else's life well i'm here to tell you you need to
[03:22:56.840 --> 03:23:02.920]  rethink exactly that organ harvesting industry because i guarantee you the surgeons and the
[03:23:02.920 --> 03:23:07.480]  doctors and the hospitals are not doing that for free they're taking your organs and they're not
[03:23:07.480 --> 03:23:12.120]  paying you a dime and then they're making potentially millions of dollars off of your
[03:23:12.120 --> 03:23:18.120]  tissue in your organs and they're even motivated to harvest your organs out of your body before
[03:23:18.120 --> 03:23:22.840]  you're actually unconscious before you're actually dead and they actually have a financial motivation
[03:23:22.840 --> 03:23:29.640]  to declare you dead before you're naturally dead there's a motivation and they don't want your organs
[03:23:30.280 --> 03:23:36.120]  to not have oxygen so the minute your heart stops beating or sometimes according to some
[03:23:36.120 --> 03:23:41.720]  accusations even before your heart stops beating they start harvesting they cut right into you they
[03:23:41.720 --> 03:23:46.520]  crack your sternum open and they rip your heart out literally this is literally what they do
[03:23:46.520 --> 03:23:52.600]  because there's money in it for them and they make millions of dollars off the off the the
[03:23:52.600 --> 03:23:58.280]  pharmaceuticals the lifelong doctor visits all the emergency surgery the transportation of your
[03:23:58.280 --> 03:24:05.480]  organ all of this they make all of this money and and don't pay your family a dime and they might
[03:24:05.480 --> 03:24:10.760]  make you suffer as they're pulling organs out of your body while you're conscious and aware
[03:24:10.760 --> 03:24:15.720]  this is a big scam by the medical industry they claim that you're dead the minute your heart
[03:24:15.720 --> 03:24:20.680]  beat stops even though your consciousness continues to exist and they're covering this up because it
[03:24:20.680 --> 03:24:26.840]  feeds into their organ harvesting industry note that there are hospitals and universities across
[03:24:26.840 --> 03:24:33.320]  america who have been caught in the black market organ trade there's a book that i've shown before
[03:24:33.320 --> 03:24:39.720]  i think it's called the red market and it's about blood farming and child trafficking and organ
[03:24:39.720 --> 03:24:46.440]  harvesting and the black market of organ trade and how they they get kidneys and they get livers
[03:24:46.440 --> 03:24:51.160]  and they get other body parts through the black market and this is a global trade and there's
[03:24:51.160 --> 03:24:56.600]  almost no mention of it in the medical system it's the dirty little secret of big medicine
[03:24:57.240 --> 03:25:02.760]  and the organ harvesting that happens when you're not really dead is part of this that's how they
[03:25:02.760 --> 03:25:10.120]  get the organs from you i mean i mean look if you thought that abortion was the only evil thing
[03:25:10.120 --> 03:25:15.480]  that the medical industry does you're you know you're your way off base that there's so much
[03:25:15.480 --> 03:25:21.160]  more evil that they do but remember we know this has been openly admitted by the abortion industry
[03:25:21.160 --> 03:25:28.120]  that they harvest organs from babies that are partially born right it's called partial birth
[03:25:28.120 --> 03:25:33.800]  abortions and again i'm not trying to be graphic here but to accurately describe this they they have
[03:25:33.800 --> 03:25:40.520]  this baby partially born the head emerges and then they murder that baby with a scalpel at the back
[03:25:41.400 --> 03:25:46.680]  of the skull excuse me almost makes me sick talking about this they they murder that baby
[03:25:46.680 --> 03:25:51.880]  and they harvest the organs they harvest the skull the the brain tissue neurological tissue
[03:25:51.880 --> 03:25:56.840]  they harvest other tissues they chop that baby up and then they sell that off to biotech companies
[03:25:56.840 --> 03:26:03.160]  and vaccine companies to do research and to grow tissue and organs that can be used to put into
[03:26:03.160 --> 03:26:09.160]  other vaccines that's why vaccines contain aborted human fetal tissue this is openly admitted
[03:26:09.160 --> 03:26:14.200]  it's listed as an ingredient by the cdc in the fda it's well documented the only people who don't
[03:26:14.200 --> 03:26:19.080]  know that are just people who are ignorant it's not debated there is no debate it's listed on
[03:26:19.080 --> 03:26:23.800]  the ingredients okay it's right on the insert sheets aborted human fetal tissue strains
[03:26:23.800 --> 03:26:33.800]  cell lines from aborted human babies and now there's a new story here uh this is even incredible
[03:26:33.800 --> 03:26:42.200]  so in um you know how how we have the heartbeat bill that was passed in i believe this was in
[03:26:42.200 --> 03:26:49.800]  iowa and the heartbeat bill oh i'm sorry it's ohio excuse me heartbeat bill makes it so that you can't
[03:26:49.800 --> 03:26:56.280]  abort babies after they have a heartbeat that's detectable because they're alive and so this
[03:26:56.280 --> 03:27:03.560]  heartbeat bill has been passed into law but a democrat named representative janine boyd
[03:27:04.360 --> 03:27:11.400]  tried to push an amendment to this bill that would exempt black babies from the protections of the
[03:27:11.400 --> 03:27:17.080]  heartbeat bill because they want to murder more black babies so that what this amendment was
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:22.760]  trying to say is that okay you can't you can't abort white babies and other color other races
[03:27:22.760 --> 03:27:30.040]  of babies but you can selectively abort black babies up to the the next limit of however long
[03:27:30.040 --> 03:27:35.800]  that is i think it was 20 weeks that the black babies in particular should not be protected
[03:27:35.800 --> 03:27:41.000]  when they have a heartbeat in other words these democrat lawmakers they want to murder black
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:46.920]  babies that have heartbeats and now i mean step back for a minute let's put all this together
[03:27:46.920 --> 03:27:51.240]  we're talking about an organ harvesting industry that's that rifts the organs out of your body
[03:27:51.240 --> 03:27:57.640]  while you're conscious we're talking about an abortion industry that feeds on dead black babies
[03:27:57.640 --> 03:28:04.520]  who's who are ripped apart even after they have a heartbeat and lawmakers in ohio saying that
[03:28:04.520 --> 03:28:08.600]  they should have a special amendment to make sure that black babies can be killed even after they
[03:28:08.600 --> 03:28:16.520]  have a heartbeat this is sick stuff people we're talking about the rise of intense demonic evil
[03:28:16.520 --> 03:28:23.240]  across the medical industry evil has infested our culture our civilization at every level
[03:28:23.240 --> 03:28:28.200]  and these people aren't even hiding it anymore the pedophiles the child traffickers the murderers the
[03:28:28.200 --> 03:28:33.320]  eugenesis the organ harvesters and organ trade traffickers they're not hiding it anymore it's
[03:28:33.320 --> 03:28:40.120]  out in the open and that's why we speak out here on info wars because we have to sound the alarm
[03:28:40.120 --> 03:28:46.360]  we have to stop this evil from sacrificing even more lives of all babies of all colors and races

[03:31:07.560 --> 03:31:13.000]  to have been chosen first last year to be platformed then they set the precedent now if you try to
[03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:18.600]  tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert they take you off the internet
[03:31:18.600 --> 03:31:24.120]  now google announced just today that they're not going to take christian advertising of
[03:31:24.120 --> 03:31:28.520]  most types on their platform because it upsets the san francisco google employees
[03:31:29.320 --> 03:31:35.160]  our country in the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech hyper leftist
[03:31:35.160 --> 03:31:41.240]  anti-human transhumanists who literally think they own and run our lives and if we keep bowing
[03:31:41.240 --> 03:31:47.160]  to these cults the cancer that is san francisco and many of these big universities is going to be
[03:31:47.160 --> 03:31:52.600]  the operating system of the planet humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks
[03:31:53.960 --> 03:32:00.360]  i've been doing a lot of research into google and youtube censorship and i've noticed that there's
[03:32:00.360 --> 03:32:08.280]  one type of video that is the most censored the most buried the most suppressed and that's the
[03:32:08.280 --> 03:32:15.560]  videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young
[03:32:15.560 --> 03:32:22.120]  turds and others get so butt hurt when trump won they don't want us to have that victory they don't
[03:32:22.120 --> 03:32:28.360]  want us to remember what political action did and that's why the globalist hillary and others
[03:32:28.360 --> 03:32:34.360]  are trying to shut in for us now this is a fight about taking your speech away not just my speech
[03:32:34.360 --> 03:32:40.520]  about taking your very sovereignty away this country is in a war so again i want to thank you for
[03:32:40.520 --> 03:32:44.280]  what you've done but i want to remind you if you don't spread the articles and videos and if you
[03:32:44.280 --> 03:32:49.560]  don't financially get the great products we have and fund us and the 360 win we're dead in the water
[03:32:49.560 --> 03:32:53.320]  i'm in your hands you're in my hands info war store dot com thank you
[03:32:57.080 --> 03:32:59.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:32:59.720 --> 03:33:16.840]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance
[03:33:16.840 --> 03:33:25.400]  it's mike adams you're listening to the alex jones show i know that was a pretty heavy segment
[03:33:25.400 --> 03:33:31.880]  that i just presented there about organ harvesting it's all true it's perhaps more graphic than what
[03:33:31.880 --> 03:33:39.560]  you wanted to get into but i'm not here to protect you from reality i'm here to show you what's
[03:33:39.560 --> 03:33:45.880]  actually happening and how you want to deal with that is of course your choice but i assume
[03:33:45.880 --> 03:33:52.600]  that everybody listening to the show is not a snowflake you're not some cry bully fragile person
[03:33:52.600 --> 03:33:56.440]  otherwise you wouldn't be watching this you want to be informed you want to know the truth
[03:33:56.440 --> 03:34:01.480]  so that's why we present this to you just straight out unfiltered uncensored and that's why i'm here
[03:34:01.480 --> 03:34:06.600]  and that's why i think alex continues to invite me to host the show from time to time seems like
[03:34:07.320 --> 03:34:12.200]  every week on the current schedule which is great i really enjoy doing it but just a bit of a positive
[03:34:12.200 --> 03:34:17.880]  note in all of this if you want to keep your organs healthy and never need an organ transplant
[03:34:17.880 --> 03:34:23.080]  yourself you should know that most people but not all people most people who are on organ
[03:34:23.080 --> 03:34:30.520]  transplant lists they need a transplant because they led a lifestyle that destroyed the organs
[03:34:30.520 --> 03:34:36.360]  that god gave them i know it's not politically correct to say that but it's true and if you want
[03:34:36.360 --> 03:34:42.280]  to avoid ever needing an organ transplant protect the organs you were born with protect what you
[03:34:42.280 --> 03:34:49.480]  have and how do you do that well you avoid exposure to toxins and you know you use nutrition and
[03:34:49.480 --> 03:34:56.200]  superfoods i mean infowarstore.com no joke many of the molecules found in many of the supplements
[03:34:56.200 --> 03:35:00.680]  that are offered there you know various specials from time to time i don't know what the current
[03:35:00.680 --> 03:35:06.360]  specials are but they've always got something on special there those molecules are protective
[03:35:07.080 --> 03:35:11.880]  it's incredible just turmeric alone is one of the most in my view one of the most miraculous
[03:35:11.880 --> 03:35:17.160]  substances that's ever been found in nature i drink turmeric every day i actually put a big
[03:35:17.160 --> 03:35:23.080]  heaping spoon of turmeric powder in my smoothie and you know a lot of people can't handle that
[03:35:23.080 --> 03:35:27.800]  taste like whoa that's strong that's this weird orange powder well take it in a capsule take it
[03:35:27.800 --> 03:35:33.000]  in a in a liquid format i think info wars has bodies lots of different formats you can choose
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:39.960]  from i think so you know protect the organs you have protect your health use nutrition god put
[03:35:39.960 --> 03:35:46.600]  molecules all over this earth in the plants in the rainforest in the oceans the molecules that
[03:35:46.600 --> 03:35:52.840]  your body needs to avoid disease avoid heart attacks avoid strokes avoid liver damage you just
[03:35:52.840 --> 03:35:58.440]  have to take advantage of those molecules that are out there really and you're not going to get that
[03:35:58.440 --> 03:36:02.920]  i mean pharmaceuticals aren't your solution trust me pharmaceuticals are going to damage your liver
[03:36:02.920 --> 03:36:07.560]  damage your heart they're going to damage your kidneys you know why people need kidney transplants
[03:36:07.560 --> 03:36:13.640]  in many cases because they were damaged by the mercury in vaccines mercury damages kidneys if
[03:36:13.640 --> 03:36:19.480]  not for vaccines the dialysis centers across america would practically collapse from a lack of
[03:36:19.480 --> 03:36:25.000]  customers it's the vaccines that keep the repeat business going for the kidney dialysis centers
[03:36:25.720 --> 03:36:30.920]  you know it's the it's the diabetes drugs that cause the liver damage that promotes the liver
[03:36:30.920 --> 03:36:35.960]  transplant industry it's the statin drugs that cause the metabolic disorders that lead to type
[03:36:35.960 --> 03:36:41.320]  two diabetes that promote the diabetes industry just goes on and on and on it's the it's the toxic
[03:36:41.320 --> 03:36:46.840]  chemicals in the cosmetic products out there that cause cancer that promote the cancer industry
[03:36:46.840 --> 03:36:53.880]  and the cancer industry all of its treatments spread cancer surgery radiation and chemotherapy
[03:36:53.880 --> 03:36:59.320]  well surgery spreads the tumors physically radiation causes cancer because it's ionizing
[03:36:59.320 --> 03:37:05.240]  radiation and chemotherapy causes cancer to spread because it doesn't kill the actual stem
[03:37:05.240 --> 03:37:09.880]  cells of the cancer through tumors it shrinks tumors temporarily and then they come back stronger
[03:37:09.880 --> 03:37:14.760]  than ever chemotherapy causes cancer it's the number one side effect of chemotherapy if you
[03:37:14.760 --> 03:37:21.560]  want to stop that cycle of toxic pharmaceuticals turn to nutrition and superfoods and stop eating
[03:37:21.560 --> 03:37:27.480]  poison you know it's really it's it's actually very simple and stop exposing yourself to toxic
[03:37:27.480 --> 03:37:31.560]  heavy metals and toxic pesticides herbicides glyphosate all of that i just want to give you
[03:37:31.560 --> 03:37:35.880]  that important note you have control over your health more than anybody else
[03:37:37.160 --> 03:37:40.440]  and you know bernie sanders can go out there and push socialized medicine and say the government
[03:37:40.440 --> 03:37:45.880]  should be in charge of your health it's nonsense no one is in charge of your health other than you
[03:37:45.880 --> 03:37:51.800]  not even your doctor your doctor can't control what you eat what you choose not to eat what level
[03:37:51.800 --> 03:37:56.120]  of exercise you have versus a sedentary lifestyle whether you choose to have some sunshine and some
[03:37:56.120 --> 03:38:00.440]  vitamin d or you want to live a life deficient in vitamin d and just grow cancer tumors all
[03:38:00.440 --> 03:38:06.680]  day long that's your choice doctor can't control you it's your choice it's your body protected
[03:38:06.680 --> 03:38:13.160]  it's the one god gave you in fact i wish that i don't know why churches don't teach this more
[03:38:14.040 --> 03:38:19.720]  you know so many of our churches have just lost their way on so many issues you've seen that they
[03:38:19.720 --> 03:38:24.120]  they're just preaching obedience now you should be obedient to government you know what is it
[03:38:24.120 --> 03:38:30.600]  roman's 13 and the churches are way off base so they'll have the sermon about how you're a divine
[03:38:30.600 --> 03:38:37.000]  being and then they'll serve you know donuts and soda like you know what god doesn't want you to eat
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:42.200]  junk food and kill your body if your body is divine you should treat it like a temple you
[03:38:42.200 --> 03:38:47.480]  should protect it and that's with good nutrition and good exercise and avoiding toxic chemicals
[03:38:47.480 --> 03:38:52.440]  all these things just i just wanted to put that note out there because this is important churches
[03:38:52.440 --> 03:38:59.720]  should improve their nutrition all right i just finished a counterthink episode that's going to air
[03:38:59.720 --> 03:39:05.320]  this sunday at info wars dot com six p.m central and as you know i do one counterthink episode
[03:39:05.320 --> 03:39:10.040]  every week this week in particular it's a really important episode it's called the annihilation
[03:39:10.040 --> 03:39:16.680]  agenda this is one of the last counterthink episodes that i'm doing i'm only doing three more
[03:39:16.680 --> 03:39:21.800]  i'm ending counterthink after three more episodes because i'm launching something new
[03:39:22.440 --> 03:39:29.880]  about forensic food science that's going to replace it but this episode the annihilation agenda
[03:39:30.440 --> 03:39:38.600]  details how everything now everything every institution medicine science government every
[03:39:38.600 --> 03:39:46.440]  institution is now focused on the mass depopulation of the planet the mass murder of human beings
[03:39:46.440 --> 03:39:52.040]  and eliminating six billion people from this planet this is the goal everything that you hear
[03:39:52.040 --> 03:39:57.640]  in the news now you can trace it back to this agenda they want people to fight with each other
[03:39:57.640 --> 03:40:04.440]  they want whites and blacks to have a civil war they want to unleash mass hatred this is the the
[03:40:04.440 --> 03:40:09.960]  whole job of msnbc and cnn you might as well just call them the hate media now because their job is
[03:40:09.960 --> 03:40:16.760]  to spread hate and cause social chaos and cause a civil war and cause fighting and killing and murder
[03:40:17.720 --> 03:40:22.440]  while the food is also intentionally poisoned and the medicine is incredibly toxic and they're
[03:40:22.440 --> 03:40:26.680]  polluting the skies and the atmosphere and they're trying to destroy the rule of law and destroy
[03:40:26.680 --> 03:40:33.480]  logic and reason and attacking human biology by saying that men are not men that men are women too
[03:40:33.480 --> 03:40:41.320]  this is an attack on creation and it's an attack on human beings it's an attack on everything
[03:40:42.040 --> 03:40:46.520]  that our culture that our civilization has been built on but it's all about annihilation
[03:40:46.520 --> 03:40:52.920]  it is annihilation that is the agenda now it's beyond depopulation it's that they hate humans
[03:40:52.920 --> 03:40:57.800]  they hate humanity and they can't wait to destroy humanity so be sure to catch that
[03:40:57.800 --> 03:41:03.080]  counter fake episode it's again one of the last well there are only three more coming so it's one
[03:41:03.080 --> 03:41:09.320]  of the last four episodes of counterthink next item important to mention those of you who are long
[03:41:09.320 --> 03:41:19.400]  range target shooters those of you who are swat snipers police officers or active duty military
[03:41:20.280 --> 03:41:24.040]  i have a major announcement coming up i'll probably make this via counterthink
[03:41:25.320 --> 03:41:30.120]  i you know i'm a scientist i run a science lab i've got a couple of patents in my name
[03:41:30.120 --> 03:41:36.200]  i'm a published scientist in science papers and so on i found a major algorithmic error
[03:41:36.920 --> 03:41:42.840]  in all ballistic software and this is causing people to miss shots at longer ranges especially
[03:41:42.840 --> 03:41:50.280]  a thousand yards and beyond and i'm going to issue a scientific report and a video
[03:41:51.160 --> 03:41:57.960]  that explains the correction for this ballistics error and this error has been repeated everywhere
[03:41:57.960 --> 03:42:03.560]  everybody that teaches long range shooting every ballistics book every ballistics software
[03:42:03.560 --> 03:42:09.960]  application wrist device that does ballistics calculations they're all wrong they're wrong
[03:42:09.960 --> 03:42:14.760]  in a significant way that will make you miss shots i'm going to issue the correction on this
[03:42:14.760 --> 03:42:18.280]  that's going to be coming up in a few weeks i have to film the video i have to write the
[03:42:18.280 --> 03:42:23.320]  science paper i have to prove the math to show people why they're wrong it's such a huge glaring
[03:42:23.320 --> 03:42:28.760]  error i can't believe nobody caught it before now and once you make this correction you'll be able
[03:42:28.760 --> 03:42:34.120]  to make your shots and that's the important thing our soldiers overseas are missing shots
[03:42:34.120 --> 03:42:39.000]  because the ballistics software has the wrong algorithm bad math they don't understand the
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:43.560]  pythagorean theorem it turns out we're going to correct that i'm going to bring that to you here
[03:42:43.560 --> 03:42:52.920]  on info wars and counter think much more straight ahead mike adams here info wars.com stay with us

[03:46:01.880 --> 03:46:06.600]  wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist that's why the globalists are obsessed with it
[03:46:06.600 --> 03:46:12.040]  trying to shut it down i didn't invent all this i went and researched the renaissance americana
[03:46:12.040 --> 03:46:17.000]  and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's
[03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:23.320]  super popular like it's always been that's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately

[03:46:59.320 --> 03:47:09.320]  you
[03:47:13.480 --> 03:47:21.320]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with mike adams
[03:47:21.320 --> 03:47:28.360]  what do notradam sandy hook 9 11 oklahoma city
[03:47:29.160 --> 03:47:35.720]  waco texas what do these all have in common the answer is there's only one official narrative
[03:47:35.720 --> 03:47:43.320]  that is allowed to be talked about that official narrative is enforced through silencing those
[03:47:43.320 --> 03:47:49.640]  who dissent from that point of view you saw that with uh on fox news how people were being shut down
[03:47:49.640 --> 03:47:56.680]  when they tried to talk about maybe there might be arson involved with the burning of noche dom
[03:47:56.680 --> 03:48:07.960]  in in paris there is an official narrative on everything now when 9 11 happened a lot of us
[03:48:07.960 --> 03:48:13.640]  asks questions we asked reasonable questions questions that any journalists would ask we
[03:48:13.640 --> 03:48:20.280]  tried to do the physics do the math we talked to architects and engineers right we looked at
[03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:27.480]  what hit the pentagon why was all the video footage confiscated by the fbi which we now
[03:48:27.480 --> 03:48:34.120]  know is utterly corrupt and dishonest isn't that interesting in retrospect you know what we know
[03:48:34.120 --> 03:48:40.760]  now about the fbi we should revisit 9 11 big time because we know the fbi has been a deep state
[03:48:40.760 --> 03:48:46.840]  deceptive operation for all these years more than two decades actually you know even through the
[03:48:46.840 --> 03:48:54.360]  clinton years as well but i'm not going to go into all the theories about 9 11 here but just to say
[03:48:54.360 --> 03:49:00.360]  that when any event takes place that is so important that the official narrative must
[03:49:00.360 --> 03:49:06.600]  be enforced at all costs you're now starting to see this where the media says we're not going to
[03:49:06.600 --> 03:49:12.040]  even entertain comments or questions anymore so journalism in the mainstream media has become
[03:49:12.040 --> 03:49:18.440]  now the practice of not asking questions isn't that interesting because i thought journalism
[03:49:18.440 --> 03:49:24.040]  was about being curious about the world asking questions documenting information you get putting
[03:49:24.040 --> 03:49:29.240]  together the story of what you found i mean that's journalism and that's also science as well
[03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:37.080]  but when it comes to hey why did building seven collapse on 9 11 in 2001 when it wasn't hit by
[03:49:37.080 --> 03:49:43.160]  an airplane how can a building collapse completely collapse almost perfectly pancake style
[03:49:44.120 --> 03:49:48.200]  when it wasn't hit by an airplane you know there were three buildings that collapsed that day not
[03:49:48.200 --> 03:49:52.520]  two the average american doesn't even know that and tucker carlson just said i think last night he
[03:49:52.520 --> 03:49:57.320]  said it won't be long he's talking about all the propaganda and the brainwashing i think he said
[03:49:57.320 --> 03:50:03.160]  actually in 20 years most americans will be taught that it was white supremacist that that took down
[03:50:03.160 --> 03:50:11.240]  the twin towers on 9 11 they won't even know that it was terrorism combined with a complicit deep
[03:50:11.240 --> 03:50:16.440]  state that ordered the military to stand down because they needed to pass the patriot act
[03:50:16.440 --> 03:50:22.360]  they needed to have surveillance on the american people precisely the surveillance that was used
[03:50:22.360 --> 03:50:30.200]  by the obama administration to spy on trump campaign officials illegal spy so see understand this
[03:50:31.400 --> 03:50:38.120]  the powers that obama used to abuse the liberties and privacy rights of trump campaign officials
[03:50:38.120 --> 03:50:47.000]  and president trump himself those powers were created by bush the bush regime and the attacks on
[03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:55.560]  9 11 were necessary to get the the advocacy of that law to sign that patriot act that was already
[03:50:55.560 --> 03:51:00.280]  pre-written and ready to go to spy on the american people and do you remember what we were told at
[03:51:00.280 --> 03:51:07.400]  that time oh these powers will only be used to spy on terrorists never americans remember that
[03:51:08.040 --> 03:51:12.520]  americans will never be spied on by their government remember that oh your email isn't
[03:51:12.520 --> 03:51:19.480]  being recorded red your phone calls aren't being recorded your tv isn't watching you your mobile
[03:51:19.480 --> 03:51:26.200]  phone isn't tracking you all these lies lie after lie after lie you know what all these lies have
[03:51:26.200 --> 03:51:34.920]  in common by the way is that they were exposed by alex jones they were exposed by info wars
[03:51:36.120 --> 03:51:41.960]  years ahead of them actually emerging as we learn from edward snowden and julia nissange and
[03:51:41.960 --> 03:51:47.240]  other you know breaking news over the years isn't that interesting the attack alex jones
[03:51:47.240 --> 03:51:53.000]  because he has been right again and again and again about 9 11 about the patriot act about all
[03:51:53.000 --> 03:52:01.160]  these events throughout history where we dare to ask questions we dare to challenge the official
[03:52:01.160 --> 03:52:07.960]  narrative that is what info wars is really all about and this is why info wars it's so important
[03:52:07.960 --> 03:52:13.640]  that info wars survives this onslaught and that info wars continues to exist with your support
[03:52:13.640 --> 03:52:21.480]  because info wars is the platform that dares to engage in real journalism there are very few
[03:52:21.480 --> 03:52:28.280]  platforms like that in existence today very few a project veritas james oakief is a real
[03:52:28.280 --> 03:52:33.720]  investigative journalist he dares to ask questions sean hanity to his credit is a real journalist
[03:52:33.720 --> 03:52:39.560]  he dares to ask questions my own platform as well natural news and all the sites that we run same
[03:52:39.560 --> 03:52:47.560]  thing we built these platforms because we are not just day to day engage in the activity of
[03:52:47.560 --> 03:52:53.640]  journalism but because we are in heart and spirit real journalists who dare to ask questions who
[03:52:53.640 --> 03:53:00.200]  dare to challenge the establishment i mean we are the ones who actually are working in the spirit
[03:53:00.200 --> 03:53:05.720]  of what the left says watergate was all about you know speaking truth to power well the media today
[03:53:05.720 --> 03:53:10.760]  isn't speaking truth to power they're covering up truth and consolidating power and lying to
[03:53:10.760 --> 03:53:15.320]  their people that's what cnn does every day and there are a lot of signs that fox news is going
[03:53:15.320 --> 03:53:20.920]  in that direction a certain part of fox news you know not the sean hanity part but not the
[03:53:20.920 --> 03:53:28.920]  not tucker carlson but other parts of fox news like shep is becoming really a dishonest propagandist
[03:53:28.920 --> 03:53:35.080]  and in my opinion he needs to go but with that said i wanted to want to add something that
[03:53:35.080 --> 03:53:39.960]  alex said earlier before you know in the opening segment of this hour alex said that he's not
[03:53:39.960 --> 03:53:45.080]  going to hire people anymore who work in the swamp nobody out of washington dc anymore
[03:53:45.080 --> 03:53:51.160]  and i agree with them i think for both our organizations we have to focus on attracting
[03:53:51.160 --> 03:53:57.160]  and hiring real people real people who live in the real world not these you know these fake
[03:53:57.160 --> 03:54:03.960]  artificial constructs that they have in washington dc and just it is honest to god truth what i did
[03:54:03.960 --> 03:54:09.640]  this morning is what a real person living in central texas done uh does on a day-to-day basis
[03:54:10.200 --> 03:54:16.680]  i uh this morning i was walking out to my barn i found a rat snake crawling across the hay that i
[03:54:16.680 --> 03:54:21.400]  have there trying to get some eggs so i captured the rat rat snake relocated that snake did that
[03:54:21.400 --> 03:54:27.720]  this morning ran my john deere tractor this morning i had to move a giant barrel of some dirt around
[03:54:28.680 --> 03:54:31.960]  so i was out running the tractor i was out catching snakes i have a sick chicken right now that i'm
[03:54:31.960 --> 03:54:36.920]  taking care of the sick chicken is doing better i treated that chicken with colloidal silver and
[03:54:36.920 --> 03:54:42.040]  essential oils in the water and gave it some good food separated it from the rest of the flock
[03:54:42.040 --> 03:54:47.240]  i take care of animals you know i take care of i take care of donkeys and goats and we are real
[03:54:47.240 --> 03:54:53.320]  people who deal with the real world was siding in a rifle i think it was two days ago 300 wind
[03:54:53.320 --> 03:55:00.200]  mag rifle sided that in entered all the ballistics got the muzzle velocity uh on my radar system uh
[03:55:00.200 --> 03:55:04.600]  got the ballistics solution for that for long range shooting you know i'm a real guy just like
[03:55:04.600 --> 03:55:11.400]  alex jones is a real guy we live in the real world we we do stuff with with our hands and our minds
[03:55:11.400 --> 03:55:18.040]  this is why we dare to be real journalists because we see we see the reality out here we see how
[03:55:18.040 --> 03:55:22.280]  people are hurting out here in texas because they're being ordered what to do by the federal
[03:55:22.280 --> 03:55:28.680]  government we see the the open borders problem how it's affecting people out here in the real world
[03:55:28.680 --> 03:55:33.560]  we see the opioid problem the drug addiction problem that happens because of the open borders
[03:55:33.560 --> 03:55:39.560]  and how they're bringing in all these illegal drugs we see it face to face we talk to people
[03:55:39.560 --> 03:55:45.560]  you know i hire a lot of people like alex does we we talk to our employees and their family members
[03:55:45.560 --> 03:55:50.680]  and we see what's happening and we hear the stories people are suffering out here in real america it's
[03:55:50.680 --> 03:55:56.760]  the part of america that the elitist in washington want to forget and this is why we elected trump
[03:55:56.760 --> 03:56:02.520]  and this is why we're going to reelect trump in 2020 because real america is tired of being ruled
[03:56:02.520 --> 03:56:08.040]  over by a bunch of elitist snobs who have never got their hands dirty who have never done anything
[03:56:08.040 --> 03:56:13.400]  in the real world never changed a tire never changed the oil on a vehicle never took care of a real
[03:56:13.400 --> 03:56:20.360]  living animal before they're afraid of grass and pasture they're afraid of the real world
[03:56:20.360 --> 03:56:25.800]  because they're in their palaces in washington dc living as parasites off the american people
[03:56:25.800 --> 03:56:30.520]  confiscating your money and wanting to take away your guns so that they can rule over you with an
[03:56:30.520 --> 03:56:37.640]  iron fist with their authoritarian regimes enough of that i say we the american people
[03:56:37.640 --> 03:56:42.680]  are going to stand up for real america we're going to protect our borders we're going to protect
[03:56:42.680 --> 03:56:46.920]  our individual liberties we're going to keep our guns we're not turning in our magazines we're not

[03:58:49.160 --> 03:58:55.400]  but if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil is better than that
[03:58:55.400 --> 03:59:01.480]  and that's an example of what i'm talking about fish oil is liquid energy brain body heart the
[03:59:01.480 --> 03:59:06.280]  cleanest the best out there you've got the children's you've got the adults you've got the krill oil

[03:59:09.800 --> 03:59:13.960]  don't give you the burpees but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and i'm
[03:59:13.960 --> 03:59:18.680]  sorry you want something like this you don't get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic it's so
[03:59:18.680 --> 03:59:22.600]  good in my view i'm not a medical statement here but let me tell you something i eat five
[03:59:22.600 --> 03:59:29.720]  capitalets of krill oil before i go to bed i'm seeing santa claus that night so your brain is
[03:59:29.720 --> 03:59:37.880]  made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice
[03:59:37.880 --> 03:59:42.440]  i just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie to you i just can't do it
