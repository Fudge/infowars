[00:00:12.782 --> 00:00:13.202]  We're good to go.
[00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.513]  Of saying flood our borders with billions of people, potentially.
[00:00:41.513 --> 00:00:46.136]  The UN wants 600 million to migrate to the US in the next 20 years.
[00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:49.959]  Let them overrun everything, but then don't send them to Democrat cities.
[00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:50.300]  Here it is.
[00:00:51.724 --> 00:01:06.009]  Since the Democrats' policies are enabling an estimated 100,000 illegal aliens to continue flooding across the border every single month, President Trump has proposed busing them into the heart of sanctuary cities.
[00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.610]  Those, of course, are the Democrat-controlled cities who are willfully violating federal immigration laws.
[00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.352]  Instead of Democrats being excited about this extracultural diversity, they're quite upset about it.
[00:01:17.352 --> 00:01:19.333]  Here's California Governor Gavin Newsom.
[00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:23.535]  California certainly is always saying, oh, we want more people.
[00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:25.677]  And they want more people in their sanctuary cities.
[00:01:25.677 --> 00:01:27.078]  Well, we'll give them more people.
[00:01:27.078 --> 00:01:27.798]  We can give them a lot.
[00:01:27.798 --> 00:01:30.160]  We can give them an unlimited supply.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.642]  Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom fired back at the president's plan today.
[00:01:34.642 --> 00:01:36.303]  It's illegal.
[00:01:36.303 --> 00:01:37.164]  It's immoral.
[00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:39.626]  It's unethical.
[00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:42.207]  It's sophomoric.
[00:01:42.207 --> 00:01:44.088]  It's petulant.
[00:01:44.088 --> 00:01:46.430]  And it's par for the course.
[00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.535]  I think it's pure genius and it's also proved once again that you Democrats are the biggest immigrants in the world!
[00:01:52.535 --> 00:02:04.185]  Not realizing the irony of her idiocy, singer Cher tweeted, quote, I understand helping struggling immigrants, but my city, Los Angeles, isn't taking care of its own.
[00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:07.448]  What about the 50,000 plus citizens who live on the streets?
[00:02:07.448 --> 00:02:09.990]  People who live below the poverty line and are hungry?
[00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.954]  If my state can't take care of its own, many are veterans, how can it take care of
[00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.435]  Well, you're absolutely right, Cher.
[00:02:17.435 --> 00:02:25.060]  It sounds like a great reason why we need to build a wall and stop another million illegal aliens from coming into the USA this year alone.
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.525]  Mr. Potato Head Cory Booker also inadvertently admitted that the sanctuary cities are making American citizens less safe.
[00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:38.408]  Do you think this is an empty threat by the president, though, to talk about busing people from the border into these sanctuary cities?
[00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:42.551]  He likes to create friction sometimes to jumpstart, he says, a Congress that's not active.
[00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:50.034]  You say friction, I say he's trying to pit Americans against each other and make us less safe, because what you're seeing now... So you take the threat seriously?
[00:02:50.034 --> 00:02:51.115]  I take this.
[00:02:51.115 --> 00:02:54.336]  He's injecting fear into our country.
[00:02:54.336 --> 00:03:00.118]  And so if he was looking to solve a problem, he wouldn't be doing things to divide this country against itself.
[00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:11.183]  Beware of anybody that's trying to tell you to be afraid in the strongest country in the world, as opposed to showing our strength and our courage by pulling people together to find common sense solutions to solve this problem.
[00:03:11.383 --> 00:03:19.030]  I don't think that exactly came out the way that he was thinking, but he inadvertently admitted the truth that illegal aliens make us less safe.
[00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.437]  Rumor has it the one and only Stephen Miller, President Trump's advisor on immigration, may be the genius behind this idea.
[00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:32.303]  And so Jerry the Hunt Nadler says he may call Stephen to testify in front of Congress because of it.
[00:03:32.563 --> 00:03:44.828]  We heard several weeks ago from whistleblowers that this, that Steve Miller came up with this, and probably Steve Miller, who seems to be the boss of everybody on immigration, ought to come before Congress and explain some of these policies.
[00:03:44.828 --> 00:03:50.050]  That sounds like a fantastic idea, because I think that Stephen Miller needs more FaceTime in front of the cameras!
[00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.653]  I'm sure that'll be the most entertaining congressional hearing since Candace Owens mopped the floor with the Democrats just last week!
[00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:01.315]  If you're wondering why you don't see him on TV anymore, it's because every time the liberal media interviews him,
[00:04:01.815 --> 00:04:03.276]  Something like this happens.
[00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:08.380]  Do you think tweets like that help or hurt the cause that the president is stable enough for the job?
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:17.487]  Not only do I think they help it, but I think in the toxic environment that you've created here in CNN and cable news, which is a real crisis of legitimacy for your network.
[00:04:17.487 --> 00:04:22.971]  And we saw it, of course, with the extremely fake news you reported about the Don Jr.
[00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.232]  and WikiLeaks story.
[00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:25.913]  There was a huge embarrassment for your network.
[00:04:26.473 --> 00:04:29.935]  Just like the huge embarrassment you had when you got the Comey testimony wrong.
[00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:30.235]  That's good.
[00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:32.076]  That's what I did when I was on the Piers Morgan line being too.
[00:04:36.874 --> 00:04:38.596]  They had Prozac ads during the breaks.
[00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:40.658]  The insert says it can make you murder people.
[00:04:40.658 --> 00:04:42.480]  They're trying to blame the average gun owner.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.646]  I said, you're the ones pitching deadly drugs that make people psychotic, become homicidal maniac murderers.
[00:04:48.646 --> 00:04:51.849]  You're the ones selling suicide mask murder pills.
[00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.931]  That's what's the big news here, Pierce.
[00:04:53.931 --> 00:04:57.234]  Not that the average gun owner is to blame for what some other crazy person does.
[00:04:57.234 --> 00:04:57.655]  We'll be back.
[00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:04.317]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:05:04.317 --> 00:05:07.098]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:13.880]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.661]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:21.226]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:05:21.226 --> 00:05:27.694]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:32.659]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:05:33.396 --> 00:05:37.319]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:44.523]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:05:44.523 --> 00:05:49.747]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:05:49.747 --> 00:05:55.430]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.393]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:06:07.632 --> 00:06:18.196]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:27.939]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.780]  Scum!
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.481]  Russian scum!
[00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:43.840]  Reputation's amazing.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.341]  I will not let you down.
[00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:48.182]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:06:59.963 --> 00:07:00.865]  Good to see you!
[00:07:15.174 --> 00:07:18.376]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:07:18.376 --> 00:07:19.977]  It is Wednesday, April 17th, 2019.
[00:07:19.977 --> 00:07:24.540]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.421]  The Knowens-Troyer with the War Rooms coming on.
[00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:38.288]  We have a former heavyweight champion of the world, a fellow that beat Mike Tyson at one time, who's gotten a lot of heat for defending this nation's sovereignty, its borders, and President Trump.
[00:07:38.968 --> 00:07:48.275]  And so, David Nino Rodriguez, who's a big critic of what's happening on our borders, will be joining us, a very well-spoken individual, coming up in the third hour today.
[00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:50.696]  Mike Adams is going to be in during the fourth hour.
[00:07:50.696 --> 00:08:01.604]  Leo Zegami is going to be joining us from Europe to break down the latest on what happened with Notre Dame.
[00:08:01.604 --> 00:08:03.926]  Let me do this in this segment.
[00:08:03.926 --> 00:08:05.227]  I tend to do this a lot.
[00:08:05.227 --> 00:08:06.748]  It's one of the big ways I drop the ball.
[00:08:07.867 --> 00:08:14.632]  Is that I'll say, coming up I'm going to cover something, probably do it at least once a week, and then I forget to do it.
[00:08:14.632 --> 00:08:19.756]  Or I shorten it down to like a couple minutes and cover it at the end of the show.
[00:08:19.756 --> 00:08:28.002]  The name of the broadcast yesterday was President Trump handing the internet over to the UN.
[00:08:28.002 --> 00:08:32.366]  And by the way, that's not hyperbole, that's happening.
[00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:36.589]  And so I have a huge stack of evidence from yesterday's stack, if you guys will pull that out for me, thank you.
[00:08:37.756 --> 00:08:38.497]  Now I want to be clear.
[00:08:38.497 --> 00:08:40.158]  I love President Trump.
[00:08:40.158 --> 00:08:42.120]  I'm very, very impressed overall what he's done.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:50.146]  But it's kind of like if you've got 20 doors on a submarine, as I've said, and you leave one of them open, you're still going to flood the boat.
[00:08:50.146 --> 00:08:56.812]  And it's going to go to the bottom of the ocean.
[00:08:56.812 --> 00:09:01.976]  You can take care of your kid, you know, 364 days out of the year, and then one day throw him off a cliff.
[00:09:01.976 --> 00:09:02.897]  You're still a murderer.
[00:09:04.964 --> 00:09:20.449]  And I really find it hard to believe the President doesn't know what's going on with the handover of the Internet to the UN that started under Obama, that Congress partially stopped, but two-thirds of the authority, roughly, was transferred over, and now they're killing us.
[00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:28.252]  And Zuckerberg and others are in the news going, oh, we love the new EU rules, and we love the new UK rules to stop free speech.
[00:09:28.252 --> 00:09:34.214]  And even the Washington Post says, why is Zuckerberg embracing censorship?
[00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:45.625]  He's embracing the new immunity to spy on us, to sell our data, and to ban everybody's free speech they don't like.
[00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:47.647]  They're creating an oligopoly.
[00:09:47.647 --> 00:09:50.949]  That's what top researchers, top scientists are saying.
[00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:58.573]  Experts that help build the Internet say they're building something that is destroying the Internet, the open and free system.
[00:09:58.573 --> 00:09:59.654]  So at the bottom of the hour,
[00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:02.931]  The problem is I'm the producer of the show.
[00:10:02.931 --> 00:10:07.092]  We have a producer that sets up guests and kind of directs things back there, but I'm the person that calls the shots.
[00:10:07.092 --> 00:10:08.213]  So let me just call the shots.
[00:10:08.213 --> 00:10:16.675]  I don't have a teleprompter, but we do have a big TV screen where they put messages up for me, like the guest is ready or things like that.
[00:10:16.675 --> 00:10:19.555]  Or please come out here during the break and sign a document or something.
[00:10:19.555 --> 00:10:23.116]  Please put up there at 1133.
[00:10:23.116 --> 00:10:25.397]  You will cover Trump handing over the Internet to the UN.
[00:10:25.397 --> 00:10:26.617]  Just put that on screen.
[00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:36.111]  Because I'm going to get that stack of papers from yesterday, and I'm going to cover that one way or another.
[00:10:36.111 --> 00:10:40.292]  Because it's absolutely, totally, and completely paramount.
[00:10:40.292 --> 00:10:43.713]  Now that said, let me tell you what else is coming up.
[00:10:43.713 --> 00:10:53.355]  I decided that I wanted to go back and look at Bernie Sanders and his wealth, and also his visits to Cuba and Venezuela and his statements, and it was worse than I thought.
[00:10:53.355 --> 00:10:58.016]  I found a whole bunch of just horrible authoritarian-supporting
[00:11:00.037 --> 00:11:06.320]  Garbage out of his mouth that we're going to be getting to a little bit later.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:18.184]  Now, we're also going to get into a really important story that if this catches on, could save millions and millions of lives, not just in this country, but all over the world.
[00:11:18.184 --> 00:11:23.166]  Proposed new Texas law would demand safety studies for vaccines.
[00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:26.428]  And are you kind of hearing the record skip there or the needle go off the record?
[00:11:27.341 --> 00:11:29.182]  Or are you hearing like a car crash?
[00:11:29.182 --> 00:11:31.662]  Or are you hearing sirens?
[00:11:31.662 --> 00:11:32.583]  And asking, what?
[00:11:32.583 --> 00:11:34.683]  There's no safety studies?
[00:11:34.683 --> 00:11:38.644]  It would take, nowadays, 10 years for aspirin to get approved.
[00:11:38.644 --> 00:11:42.406]  Trump cut back on some of the regulations, so it would take a couple years.
[00:11:42.406 --> 00:11:44.486]  It takes cancer drugs a decade to get approved.
[00:11:44.486 --> 00:11:46.907]  It takes most drugs a decade to get approved.
[00:11:46.907 --> 00:11:47.647]  But wait a minute!
[00:11:47.647 --> 00:11:49.948]  Vaccines don't get approved!
[00:11:49.948 --> 00:11:50.428]  That's right!
[00:11:51.735 --> 00:11:53.976]  They don't get approved.
[00:11:53.976 --> 00:11:57.677]  And if you understand this, you understand everything about medical tyranny.
[00:11:57.677 --> 00:12:01.438]  So I'm going to cover that coming up in the last segment of this hour.
[00:12:01.438 --> 00:12:04.478]  Remember Governor Northam.
[00:12:04.478 --> 00:12:08.560]  He said, we don't want courts or law enforcement or men involved.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:16.402]  We want women with the hospital and the doctors, that means the medical tyranny, to decide whether to resuscitate a child.
[00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.342]  We keep them comfortable.
[00:12:18.424 --> 00:12:19.925]  And then we decide whether to resuscitate.
[00:12:19.925 --> 00:12:25.890]  Well, resuscitate means if someone's heart has stopped, to artificially start it again.
[00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:26.970]  To bring back to life.
[00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.333]  But their definition in bioethics is not the same.
[00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:40.861]  It means whether the bioethics decision, it's got to be two doctors, they're trying to change that law, used to be a whole board, decide whether life should be viable and whether this person is going to have a good life.
[00:12:43.715 --> 00:12:49.238]  Kind of the Spartan thing of, well, the baby, you know, had three arms, so we threw it off a cliff.
[00:12:49.238 --> 00:12:56.942]  But this is just, they're deciding, oh, the parents are poor, or this baby's got a bunch of matches for organs we need.
[00:12:56.942 --> 00:13:12.049]  Then they convince the drugged up woman that thinks she's just had a third trimester abortion to sign off, and they get to keep that baby alive for up to several weeks while they line up all the companies that want to put bids in for the organs.
[00:13:12.049 --> 00:13:13.390]  We keep them comfortable.
[00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:22.541]  So that ties into this, how they have two different sets of medical systems, two different railroad tracks, running side by side.
[00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:26.184]  I'm going to give you the big, deep secret.
[00:13:26.184 --> 00:13:33.471]  There's a whole other branch of law in medicine now, since the Hippocratic Oath was removed, and it is the big Rockefeller
[00:13:35.011 --> 00:13:37.212]  Bill and Melinda Gates takeover paradigm.
[00:13:37.212 --> 00:13:55.318]  So we're gonna go to break and come back with the latest on Muslims all over the world celebrating Notre Dame and even Lou Dobbs and others saying what I said before they even knew the cause of the fire and they still don't before it was even out one hour in while it's a towering inferno.
[00:13:55.318 --> 00:13:57.839]  No Muslims, no Islam, no arson.
[00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:01.740]  Even though French officials say no actually we're looking at arson.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.841]  Lou Dobbs takes them to the woodshed coming up.
[00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:07.280]  You'll probably get fired from Fox for this.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.363]  Other Fox hosts won't even allow French officials, Catholic officials to mention it.
[00:14:11.363 --> 00:14:14.546]  Now we're going to go to break.
[00:14:14.546 --> 00:14:22.772]  Come back with all of that, but first, ladies and gentlemen, I want to just say something real slow and real clear because I know you're awesome and I want to sink in.
[00:14:22.772 --> 00:14:32.279]  Thank you if you're a listener or viewer and you bought books or films or t-shirts or fish oil that's high quality or our coffee that's excellent or any of our great products.
[00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:33.300]  Without you, we wouldn't be here.
[00:14:34.298 --> 00:14:39.822]  But I want to expand, and we don't have the money to expand right now at current sales rates.
[00:14:39.822 --> 00:14:43.245]  I got a few tricks up my sleeve, but I really want to expand.
[00:14:43.245 --> 00:14:45.347]  I want to add more shows, more reporters.
[00:14:45.347 --> 00:14:49.811]  You see our reporters out in the field getting on average about 25 million views a week.
[00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:52.653]  That's more viewers than actual CNN broadcast has.
[00:14:52.653 --> 00:14:56.136]  I mean, we are fighting hard here, okay?
[00:14:56.136 --> 00:14:59.678]  Yours truly has been restricted, but not our crew, not our reporters, not our...
[00:15:01.394 --> 00:15:03.655]  Probes that are out there, they're doing an amazing job.
[00:15:03.655 --> 00:15:05.556]  We need funds.
[00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:07.276]  We don't need to be on a shoestring budget.
[00:15:07.276 --> 00:15:10.658]  So I'm not bitching, I'm saying, you want to win this war?
[00:15:10.658 --> 00:15:12.218]  I want to win this war.

[00:15:44.887 --> 00:15:46.248]  They're so high quality.
[00:15:46.248 --> 00:15:49.531]  And after the printing, we sell them for $29 normally.

[00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:00.655]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.655 --> 00:16:04.578]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:04.578 --> 00:16:06.099]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:06.099 --> 00:16:09.062]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:09.062 --> 00:16:14.626]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:14.626 --> 00:16:15.827]  I can help you, too.
[00:16:15.827 --> 00:16:18.769]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.322]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:16:38.322 --> 00:16:44.245]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:16:44.245 --> 00:16:48.026]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:16:48.026 --> 00:16:48.967]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:16:49.287 --> 00:16:50.288]  Who do we fight for?

[00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:08.930]  Remember when TV didn't watch you, you watched television?
[00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.551]  There's no reviews yet for it, but it's at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:13.412]  We bought the best-selling antenna.
[00:18:13.412 --> 00:18:16.293]  We sell it for, what is it, $5 less than Amazon does.
[00:18:16.293 --> 00:18:18.774]  InfoWars HD Digital TV Antenna.
[00:18:18.774 --> 00:18:24.777]  And, I mean, look, you're talking like 100-plus digital channels, and then they'll have four or five sub-channels.
[00:18:24.997 --> 00:18:29.338]  Of every old cool TV show, old movies, it's like way better than cable.
[00:18:29.338 --> 00:18:35.579]  And it's like Hawaii Five-O, Gilligan's Island, I Dream of Jeannie, Dallas, stuff from the 90s, new stuff.
[00:18:35.579 --> 00:18:39.700]  Like when the Olympics was on, I didn't know there were 10 channels of Olympics on TV.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.261]  I mean, it's like, my God, this is way better than cable.
[00:18:42.261 --> 00:18:46.322]  And people don't know that it's free after you buy the antenna.
[00:18:46.462 --> 00:18:50.664]  The point is, is that there's so many channels, and it's not watching you.
[00:18:50.664 --> 00:18:51.884]  It's not tracking you.
[00:18:51.884 --> 00:19:00.388]  So we do sell the antennas at the lowest price you'll find at nimbleworkstore.com.
[00:19:00.388 --> 00:19:02.469]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:19:02.469 --> 00:19:03.089]  Go ahead.
[00:19:03.089 --> 00:19:05.290]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.332]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:19:09.156 --> 00:19:10.577]  It just gets old, man.
[00:19:10.577 --> 00:19:13.019]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:15.321]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:19.384]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:19:19.384 --> 00:19:22.647]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:19:22.647 --> 00:19:25.329]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:19:25.329 --> 00:19:26.690]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.811]  Us being shut down?
[00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:28.832]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:19:29.272 --> 00:19:30.353]  You know what, Alex?
[00:19:30.353 --> 00:19:31.434]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[00:19:31.434 --> 00:19:32.554]  Hey, Frank!
[00:19:32.554 --> 00:19:38.218]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:42.741]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:19:42.741 --> 00:19:45.883]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:19:45.883 --> 00:19:46.344]  You understand?
[00:19:46.344 --> 00:19:47.985]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:47.985 --> 00:19:49.105]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:50.086 --> 00:19:55.670]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars!
[00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.430]  Do you understand?
[00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.051]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:58.051 --> 00:20:03.815]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[00:20:03.815 --> 00:20:06.457]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:11.907 --> 00:20:16.715]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:18.417]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:20.060]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:24.747]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:35.393 --> 00:20:40.897]  The great one, the Motor City Madman, now a transplant to Texas, and he's welcome.
[00:20:40.897 --> 00:20:44.679]  The great Ted Nugent bringing us in.
[00:20:44.679 --> 00:20:49.262]  Okay, let's get right into it.
[00:20:49.262 --> 00:21:00.010]  Within 30 minutes of the Notre Dame being on fire, we were covering it when that blaze started on Monday.
[00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:00.170]  And
[00:21:03.015 --> 00:21:14.380]  When I was first watching CNN and Fox News, that we have on on TVs out there, and turned the audio up, both channels were saying, it's not arson and it's not terrorists.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.321]  This happened the day after Palm Sunday.
[00:21:17.321 --> 00:21:22.283]  The whole week of Easter is when the Islamists burn up and bomb and shoot up churches.
[00:21:22.283 --> 00:21:29.446]  I said just a month ago with the Christchurch attack in New Zealand, I said look for them starting Palm Sunday,
[00:21:30.626 --> 00:21:35.052]  The Islamicists threw Easter to blow up and burn a bunch of churches.
[00:21:35.052 --> 00:21:36.113]  They always do!
[00:21:36.113 --> 00:21:46.806]  And they had media manners, and the Daily Beast, and mainstream news saying Jones is so horrible, he says Muslims are going to attack this Easter week.
[00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:47.888]  Well, that's like saying
[00:21:49.144 --> 00:21:53.426]  People put up Christmas trees in December in the U.S.
[00:21:53.426 --> 00:21:55.487]  Christians put up Christmas trees.
[00:21:55.487 --> 00:21:58.348]  Muslims go out and blow up churches and shoot people up.
[00:21:58.348 --> 00:22:00.009]  I mean, they run over people with trucks.
[00:22:00.009 --> 00:22:02.830]  They scream Allah Akbar and stab women and children.
[00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.870]  You know that!
[00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.691]  Stop pretending that's not reality!
[00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:09.513]  You lying, leftist scum!
[00:22:09.513 --> 00:22:13.835]  And so, within an hour of the fire starting, 30 minutes of news coverage,
[00:22:16.266 --> 00:22:23.172]  I'm watching the news and they're saying, no arson, no Islam, no terror.
[00:22:23.172 --> 00:22:25.854]  And I just sat back and then I actually went to the fine print.
[00:22:25.854 --> 00:22:27.776]  It's like authorities don't know what caused it.
[00:22:27.776 --> 00:22:30.878]  They won't know until the fire is out and they get it into an investigation.
[00:22:30.878 --> 00:22:32.460]  They don't know!
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.184]  I played yesterday, Fox News going, well from Paris, we don't know and they don't know who did it.
[00:22:37.184 --> 00:22:39.566]  There'll be an investigation starting in the next few days.
[00:22:39.566 --> 00:22:43.329]  It may take months to decide the cause, but it's not terrorism and it's not arson.
[00:22:44.724 --> 00:22:45.325]  Like a coroner.
[00:22:45.325 --> 00:22:48.107]  Well, the body's not even cold yet, but it's not murder.
[00:22:48.107 --> 00:22:50.489]  But we haven't done any tests yet, so we don't know.
[00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:53.600]  It's oxymoronic.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:59.062]  What the media is telling you is, you're not going to say this is terror, and you're not going to say this is arson.
[00:22:59.062 --> 00:23:00.623]  I don't know if it was Muslims.
[00:23:00.623 --> 00:23:02.104]  Probably is.
[00:23:02.104 --> 00:23:06.165]  I don't know if it was arson, but I mean, that's what everything points towards.
[00:23:06.165 --> 00:23:07.766]  It's been a terrorist target.
[00:23:07.766 --> 00:23:10.867]  ISIS was bragging a week ago how they were going to blow it up or burn it up.
[00:23:10.867 --> 00:23:11.768]  They're praising it.
[00:23:11.768 --> 00:23:13.668]  Muslims are praising it all over the place.
[00:23:13.668 --> 00:23:14.669]  Prominent Muslims are.
[00:23:16.752 --> 00:23:27.183]  But they politically make the statement that you will not question one of the top Christian monuments in the world.
[00:23:27.183 --> 00:23:34.590]  I'd say like the third most important monument after, what, Golgotha?
[00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.753]  Where Christ was crucified?
[00:23:36.753 --> 00:23:37.874]  Or what, the Vatican?
[00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:40.950]  I mean, what else?
[00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.772]  I mean, Notre Dame's 900 years old.
[00:23:43.772 --> 00:23:45.212]  It's a beautiful giant church.
[00:23:45.212 --> 00:23:49.875]  It's filled with all these icons.
[00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:53.837]  And the thing goes up like a Christmas tree lit on fire, and we're not supposed to ask questions?
[00:23:53.837 --> 00:23:55.217]  What world do we live in?
[00:23:55.217 --> 00:24:02.501]  Where Shep Smith and Neil Caputo, they're now the police dogs, the enforcers, to not ask that question.
[00:24:02.501 --> 00:24:05.862]  So you know it's super suspicious.
[00:24:05.862 --> 00:24:08.844]  I mean, the thing is the biggest target in France for Islamists.
[00:24:10.137 --> 00:24:14.478]  And within 30 minutes of the thing being on fire, we're told, we don't know why it's on fire.
[00:24:14.478 --> 00:24:15.538]  But don't say it's Muslims.
[00:24:15.538 --> 00:24:18.039]  Then French officials go on and say, no, we think it's Islam.
[00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:20.739]  We've had 800 plus churches firebombed in the last 12 months.
[00:24:20.739 --> 00:24:22.720]  And they go, well, you can't say that.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.640]  You're off air.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:31.382]  But on Fox Business, Lou Dobbs, who got fired from CNN for being number one and not toeing the line, he tells it like it is.
[00:24:31.382 --> 00:24:31.682]  Here it is.
[00:24:33.183 --> 00:24:33.323]  I think?
[00:24:52.879 --> 00:25:01.809]  Twelve churches were vandalized, including a fire deliberately set, also located in Paris.
[00:25:01.809 --> 00:25:02.951]  This is context.
[00:25:02.951 --> 00:25:04.552]  This is not speculation.
[00:25:04.552 --> 00:25:08.597]  This is the situation right now in France.
[00:25:08.597 --> 00:25:08.817]  And, and,
[00:25:10.459 --> 00:25:15.322]  The recent history of what has happened to Catholic churches throughout the nation.
[00:25:15.322 --> 00:25:19.624]  Ignored too often by some covering the tragedy.
[00:25:19.624 --> 00:25:29.109]  Some who have ruled out speculation about the cause of the Notre Dame fire as they speculate, taking it as gospel that, well...
[00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.210]  Arson was not the cause.
[00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.271]  That was a decision made within hours.
[00:25:34.271 --> 00:25:42.912]  It sounds like a different kind of decision, perhaps a political decision, rather than one based on careful investigation of the facts.
[00:25:42.912 --> 00:25:43.452]  No kidding!
[00:25:43.452 --> 00:25:49.793]  It violates French law, and common law, and our law, to just say before a fire is out, you know what caused it when you don't know.
[00:25:49.793 --> 00:25:50.974]  Very suspicious.
[00:25:50.974 --> 00:25:52.574]  The default is, it was Islamic terror.
[00:25:52.574 --> 00:25:53.854]  Now, we have to say that.
[00:25:53.854 --> 00:25:55.134]  The cover-up is clear.
[00:25:55.134 --> 00:25:57.615]  Cover-up is, many times, evidence of the crime itself.
[00:25:57.615 --> 00:25:59.215]  Here's Tucker Carlson making a great point.
[00:26:00.031 --> 00:26:01.152]  I don't think he's joking.
[00:26:01.152 --> 00:26:09.161]  We'll be taught in a generation or so that white supremacists attacked us on 9-11, not globalist inspired and funded islamicists.
[00:26:09.161 --> 00:26:09.882]  Here's Tucker Carlson.
[00:26:12.123 --> 00:26:17.265]  In 1992, Ilhan Omar came to this country from a refugee camp in East Africa, Kenya.
[00:26:17.265 --> 00:26:22.167]  Three years later, she and her family applied for and received refugee status in the United States.
[00:26:22.167 --> 00:26:23.767]  Five years after that, she became a U.S.
[00:26:23.767 --> 00:26:28.249]  citizen, and she's been attacking the United States as a racist hellhole pretty much ever since.
[00:26:28.249 --> 00:26:33.951]  According to Omar, there's barely a difference between this country and terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:39.693]  In a 2013 interview, Omar complained that people seemed to think there was a big difference between America and Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:39.693 --> 00:26:39.933]  Watch.
[00:26:41.554 --> 00:26:44.675]  When I was in college, I took a terrorism class.
[00:26:44.675 --> 00:26:51.456]  Every time the professor said Al-Qaeda, he sort of, like, his shoulders went up and, you know.
[00:26:51.456 --> 00:26:52.716]  Yeah, he's in command here.
[00:26:52.716 --> 00:26:54.557]  Al-Qaeda, you know, hospital.
[00:26:54.557 --> 00:26:56.977]  You don't say America with an intensity.
[00:26:56.977 --> 00:26:59.138]  You don't say England with an intensity.
[00:26:59.138 --> 00:26:59.738]  Hey, pause.
[00:26:59.738 --> 00:27:01.738]  I don't want to listen to the pig.
[00:27:01.738 --> 00:27:09.740]  Just fast forward to the end, where he makes the key point, but... Why do you want to live here, you ugly, stupid pig?
[00:27:11.209 --> 00:27:14.011]  And I mean ugly, your soul is ugly.
[00:27:14.011 --> 00:27:19.897]  You get run out of your own country, Somalia, where women are lower than slaves.
[00:27:19.897 --> 00:27:21.458]  Lower than dogs.
[00:27:21.458 --> 00:27:31.567]  You go to Kenya that saved your ass, that Islam's trying to crush right now, and then you come here to piss in our face constantly and tell us how much we suck.
[00:27:31.567 --> 00:27:34.089]  No, you suck, dirtbag!
[00:27:34.089 --> 00:27:35.770]  Go back to your filthy rattle!
[00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:39.672]  Go back to your you-know-what hole, and get off our back!
[00:27:39.672 --> 00:27:42.193]  You want to come here from Africa and embrace America and love it?
[00:27:42.193 --> 00:27:43.273]  We love you!
[00:27:43.273 --> 00:27:44.474]  You want to piss in our face?
[00:27:44.474 --> 00:27:45.154]  Go to hell!
[00:27:45.154 --> 00:27:50.377]  By the way, an African immigrant who's here legally, wearing a mega hat, just got beaten half to death in Maryland.
[00:27:50.377 --> 00:27:54.559]  We've got that article up on Infowars.com.
[00:27:54.559 --> 00:27:55.980]  Sorry, let's go back to the end of this clip.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.881]  Here it is.
[00:27:57.881 --> 00:28:03.764]  I swear, in 20 years, every 5th grader will believe 9-11 was committed by white supremacists.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.321]  Totally true.
[00:28:05.321 --> 00:28:07.443]  You watch, you heard it here first.
[00:28:07.443 --> 00:28:08.364]  They're the real threat.
[00:28:08.364 --> 00:28:10.526]  We need to fear and suppress them.
[00:28:10.526 --> 00:28:11.767]  And that's what Booker's saying.
[00:28:11.767 --> 00:28:17.673]  And to prove it, he and so many demagogues on the left are forever telling us about the epidemic of hate crimes in this country.
[00:28:17.673 --> 00:28:18.393]  But they're lying.
[00:28:18.393 --> 00:28:19.995]  There is no epidemic of hate crimes.
[00:28:19.995 --> 00:28:20.355]  We check.
[00:28:20.355 --> 00:28:22.017]  We know what the numbers are.
[00:28:22.017 --> 00:28:24.839]  We check for California, the biggest state, the most liberal state.
[00:28:24.839 --> 00:28:25.420]  Here are the numbers.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.401]  And let's stop right there.
[00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:27.222]  We're going to get to this later.
[00:28:27.222 --> 00:28:28.363]  I've got to get to the big Trump story.
[00:28:29.781 --> 00:28:31.081]  They've created new hate crimes.
[00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:32.422]  They've created new reporting agencies.
[00:28:32.422 --> 00:28:34.042]  Right-wingers don't report this stuff.
[00:28:34.042 --> 00:28:35.642]  So Tucker's actually wrong in a way.
[00:28:35.642 --> 00:28:38.403]  Hate crimes against conservatives and nationalists and Christians, the U.N.
[00:28:38.403 --> 00:28:41.684]  admits, are at record levels all over the world.
[00:28:41.684 --> 00:28:44.285]  We just showed you all the churches getting burned down.
[00:28:44.285 --> 00:28:46.505]  Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, we're Lister-supported.

[00:28:59.554 --> 00:29:01.516]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.516 --> 00:29:06.841]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.841 --> 00:29:08.423]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.423 --> 00:29:16.791]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:30:03.579 --> 00:30:05.100]  During the fall, they'd have it during the winter.
[00:30:06.497 --> 00:30:09.440]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.

[00:31:59.957 --> 00:32:13.387]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most oppressed.
[00:32:13.387 --> 00:32:24.435]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[00:32:25.743 --> 00:32:27.671]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[00:32:27.671 --> 00:32:30.342]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[00:32:31.732 --> 00:32:36.035]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[00:32:36.035 --> 00:32:40.299]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[00:32:40.299 --> 00:32:42.581]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[00:32:42.581 --> 00:32:44.902]  This country is in a war!
[00:32:44.902 --> 00:32:55.611]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[00:32:55.611 --> 00:32:59.194]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:22.309]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.309 --> 00:33:26.773]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:26.773 --> 00:33:28.195]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:37.947 --> 00:33:41.769]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Verboten Broadcast for a reason.
[00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:49.594]  We'll tell the truth, no matter how hard, and let the chips fall where they may.
[00:33:49.594 --> 00:33:53.557]  Did you know that President Trump is engaging in treason?
[00:33:53.557 --> 00:33:57.319]  Did you know that President Trump is selling out America, the West,
[00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:09.294]  Our sovereignty, the Renaissance, and the great hope we have to try to lead the planet in a good direction towards a pro-human future that goes beyond the stars.
[00:34:09.294 --> 00:34:16.716]  That's right, President Trump is dealing a death blow to not just our country, but to free peoples all over the world.
[00:34:16.716 --> 00:34:26.399]  President Trump is allowing the destruction of the Internet.
[00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:28.360]  In fact, even Mainline News says this will kill
[00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.371]  The open and free internet as we know it.
[00:34:31.371 --> 00:34:33.752]  I'm going to show you news articles admitting that.
[00:34:33.752 --> 00:34:36.634]  I'm going to show you even the head EU bureaucrats admitting it.
[00:34:36.634 --> 00:34:38.415]  I'm going to show you Russia talking about it.
[00:34:38.415 --> 00:34:41.977]  I'm going to show you the inventor of the internet talking about it.
[00:34:41.977 --> 00:34:42.997]  Now I want to be clear.
[00:34:42.997 --> 00:34:47.259]  I'm not going to sit here and give Trump a bunch of accolades about the great job he's done on a hundred fronts.
[00:34:47.259 --> 00:34:47.760]  That's good.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.061]  And I believe Trump means well.
[00:34:51.061 --> 00:34:52.282]  And has incredible stamina.
[00:34:52.282 --> 00:34:54.803]  And is amazing.
[00:34:54.803 --> 00:34:55.404]  But that said.
[00:34:56.474 --> 00:35:04.437]  Yeah, he signed an executive order a few weeks ago to cut and drive the campuses, the state funded colleges, public funded colleges.
[00:35:04.437 --> 00:35:08.278]  They're not allowed to discriminate against speech or politics or race or anything.
[00:35:08.278 --> 00:35:12.500]  And Trump says, we're going to strip your federal funds if you do that.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.580]  That's good.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.701]  But let me tell you something.
[00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:17.642]  I've been watching this.
[00:35:17.642 --> 00:35:20.863]  I've been tracking this, Mr. President.
[00:35:20.863 --> 00:35:24.424]  And if you don't do this, everything else goes out with the bathwater.
[00:35:25.598 --> 00:35:32.722]  Remember four years ago, seven days before Obama gives away the internet and national security.
[00:35:32.722 --> 00:35:35.824]  That's Forbes.
[00:35:35.824 --> 00:35:43.149]  Now they didn't give total control of ICANN and the domain names and the registries to the UN, but they gave partial control.
[00:35:43.149 --> 00:35:45.110]  They made a deal.
[00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:47.232]  So see, does Trump know this is happening?
[00:35:47.232 --> 00:35:47.772]  Probably not.
[00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:57.142]  But see, the deal was made, and now they're just going along with the original deal, even though the U.S.
[00:35:57.142 --> 00:35:59.323]  didn't completely sign on to it.
[00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:05.726]  If you go back and review the deal Obama had four or five years ago, it's the exact plan.
[00:36:05.726 --> 00:36:13.490]  And that's why we come to these articles.
[00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:18.332]  Why is Zuckerberg, Bloomberg ask, Reuters ask, Washington Post even ask?
[00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:24.811]  Why is Zuckerberg so relaxed about UK online speech rules?
[00:36:24.811 --> 00:36:29.473]  And it goes on to say it's going to end free speech, but it's going to give him monopoly control.
[00:36:29.473 --> 00:36:31.793]  It's going to give him liability control.
[00:36:31.793 --> 00:36:35.794]  He doesn't need Section 230 anymore to say he's not a publisher.
[00:36:35.794 --> 00:36:39.835]  He can be a publisher and control content and be given liability protection.
[00:36:39.835 --> 00:36:45.357]  Something all the thousands of newspapers and TV stations, including InfoWars, won't have, but he'll have.
[00:36:47.128 --> 00:36:49.773]  This is big tech eating journalism.
[00:36:49.773 --> 00:36:52.518]  That's even in a headline today.
[00:36:52.518 --> 00:36:59.431]  From the establishment, it's, why are newspapers and TV stations letting big tech eat them?
[00:37:00.779 --> 00:37:02.600]  Why is Trump allowing that?
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.363]  Because of the lobbyist and the complexity.
[00:37:05.363 --> 00:37:08.725]  And when Trump gets something, he understands it and does the right thing.
[00:37:08.725 --> 00:37:11.368]  Like, our borders are wide open.
[00:37:11.368 --> 00:37:12.569]  100,000 people every few weeks are coming in.
[00:37:12.569 --> 00:37:14.250]  A lot of them are criminals.
[00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:17.132]  They're being shipped to mainly red states to turn them blue.
[00:37:17.132 --> 00:37:21.536]  Just to make the Democrats stop, ship those people because we don't have any courts left.
[00:37:21.536 --> 00:37:22.897]  They're overwhelmed or any jails.
[00:37:22.897 --> 00:37:25.339]  That's why people, why is Trump releasing them?
[00:37:25.339 --> 00:37:26.060]  Don't have the money.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:26.920]  Don't have the funding.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.581]  Don't have the law.
[00:37:30.452 --> 00:37:33.212]  Unless he becomes really the Commander-in-Chief, he could still do something.
[00:37:33.212 --> 00:37:37.593]  Not that other emergency he did that was just a law enforcement emergency, but a real national emergency.
[00:37:37.593 --> 00:37:40.474]  He could, but so far he hasn't.
[00:37:40.474 --> 00:37:41.814]  And so the courts are ordering him released.
[00:37:41.814 --> 00:37:45.435]  Well, let's release him in Cory Booker's district.
[00:37:45.435 --> 00:37:48.715]  Or in California.
[00:37:48.715 --> 00:37:49.855]  With Governor Newsom.
[00:37:49.855 --> 00:37:50.976]  Oh, they're like, oh, that's dangerous.
[00:37:50.976 --> 00:37:51.676]  Don't do that.
[00:37:51.676 --> 00:37:52.816]  My God, that's terrible.
[00:37:52.816 --> 00:37:54.576]  We can't take all these people.
[00:37:54.576 --> 00:37:56.276]  Oh, really?
[00:37:56.276 --> 00:37:57.697]  But they're coming into the country.
[00:37:57.697 --> 00:37:59.077]  You just don't want them targeting you.
[00:38:00.786 --> 00:38:07.688]  So I get what Trump's doing, but on this subject, why is Zuckerberg so relaxed?
[00:38:07.688 --> 00:38:10.909]  Because Big Tech wrote these rules with the EU.
[00:38:10.909 --> 00:38:13.950]  They're like, oh, don't throw me in that briar patch, Merkel.
[00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:17.331]  Oh, don't throw me in that briar patch, Theresa May.
[00:38:17.331 --> 00:38:20.852]  Oh, don't throw me in that briar patch, Macron.
[00:38:23.442 --> 00:38:34.286]  Don't throw in that bar patch when it's exactly what they want, a merger of big tech with governments and others to be the filters and the arbiters of anything and everything that can be done.
[00:38:34.286 --> 00:38:42.089]  And it's extra judicial, it's extra lawful, and it's usurping due process, it's usurping the courts, it's usurping everything.
[00:38:44.113 --> 00:38:48.997]  That's what we're seeing in this age of big corporations is take the medical cartel.
[00:38:48.997 --> 00:38:54.983]  A lot of great doctors, a lot of great medical breakthroughs, but the corporations running it want total power.
[00:38:54.983 --> 00:39:00.127]  So they got laws passed in the 80s that vaccines don't have to get approved and have no liability and are immune.
[00:39:00.127 --> 00:39:02.069]  And so they become nightmarishly poisoned and bad.
[00:39:04.318 --> 00:39:10.165]  And it's just like governors all over are passing laws where you can keep a baby alive after it's born and sell its organs.
[00:39:10.165 --> 00:39:11.867]  Because we're saying the baby doesn't count.
[00:39:11.867 --> 00:39:14.370]  We're not counting it as alive in some legalese.
[00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.793]  It's all legalese.
[00:39:16.793 --> 00:39:19.296]  So big tech's in a power grab.
[00:39:19.296 --> 00:39:20.778]  Medical systems are in a power grab.
[00:39:22.011 --> 00:39:25.254]  Why is Zuckerberg so relaxed about UK speech online?
[00:39:25.254 --> 00:39:29.057]  And you read it, it's because he's being given liability protection for total takeover.
[00:39:29.057 --> 00:39:34.501]  Europe looks to remold internet with new copyright rules where even linking to a story is illegal.
[00:39:34.501 --> 00:39:35.662]  Memes are illegal.
[00:39:35.662 --> 00:39:38.665]  Everything must be pre-approved through big tech filters.
[00:39:38.665 --> 00:39:40.226]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait for it!
[00:39:41.343 --> 00:39:45.045]  by the big five media social networks.
[00:39:45.045 --> 00:39:57.592]  They are the filters that decide through government agreement and through government and Southern Poverty Law Center and Media Matters Interface, they will decide what can go out and what can't.
[00:39:57.592 --> 00:40:02.715]  Not just on the big platforms, but on your own website.
[00:40:02.715 --> 00:40:05.457]  What did a famous conservative
[00:40:08.562 --> 00:40:13.606]  Say to Matt Drudge three years ago that made him come to this office and warn you right in the studio.
[00:40:13.606 --> 00:40:14.387]  He said it's over.
[00:40:14.387 --> 00:40:17.449]  They plan to use copyright in the EU to regulate the Internet.
[00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:22.092]  And because our government won't regulate it, it creates a vacuum and the EU will regulate it.
[00:40:22.092 --> 00:40:23.033]  That's what I keep saying.
[00:40:23.033 --> 00:40:27.036]  Mr. President, you're a nationalist, a constitutionalist, a free market purist.
[00:40:27.036 --> 00:40:27.437]  I get it.
[00:40:27.437 --> 00:40:36.003]  So am I. But if you're a country of 330 million next to the EU and others even more in China of a billion five hundred million and their
[00:40:37.384 --> 00:40:48.588]  Pressing authoritarian control over the internet here and over companies here and making them adopt their systems of control and censorship and arresting dissidents.
[00:40:48.588 --> 00:40:56.630]  If you don't come in and prohibit and say you're not going to do that, then it lets those companies standardize that.
[00:40:56.630 --> 00:41:04.853]  So again, by standing down, by the advocation that's taking place, we're allowing that vacuum that's bringing us in.
[00:41:06.724 --> 00:41:14.729]  Here it is, German Data Privacy Commissioner, says Article 13, inevitably leads to filters which inevitably lead to internet oligopoly.
[00:41:14.729 --> 00:41:20.312]  A handful of corporations controlling all information as the filter for government.
[00:41:20.312 --> 00:41:29.957]  That's all this is, is big tech being pecked on the head by big government to merge with them in total control.
[00:41:29.957 --> 00:41:33.419]  And Zuckerberg is up there ready to get married right now.
[00:41:33.419 --> 00:41:34.019]  Who's pitching?
[00:41:34.019 --> 00:41:34.560]  Who's catching?
[00:41:35.287 --> 00:41:38.829]  I think Zuckerberg's catching, folks.
[00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:41.531]  Republicans say Obama administration is giving away the Internet.
[00:41:41.531 --> 00:41:42.812]  Remember that way back then?
[00:41:42.812 --> 00:41:44.913]  Well, that's what President Trump's doing.
[00:41:44.913 --> 00:41:46.394]  So do I want to get the President's attention?
[00:41:46.394 --> 00:41:48.015]  You're right, I do.
[00:41:48.015 --> 00:41:49.016]  This is a live feed.
[00:41:49.016 --> 00:41:51.518]  We're going to post this video later to Infowars.com.
[00:41:51.518 --> 00:41:52.458]  Treason?
[00:41:52.458 --> 00:41:54.660]  Question mark?
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:59.863]  Does President Trump know he's handing control of the Internet over to the EU, the UN, and China?
[00:41:59.863 --> 00:42:02.565]  Because it's really happening, and it's all here.
[00:42:04.295 --> 00:42:07.299]  For everyone to see.
[00:42:07.299 --> 00:42:09.021]  It's all confirmed.
[00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:10.403]  And all the censorship.
[00:42:10.403 --> 00:42:15.390]  Remember Zuckerberg two years ago sent a hot mic with Merkel of Germany?
[00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.893]  She says, I don't like people criticizing open borders and Islamic invasion.
[00:42:17.893 --> 00:42:18.794]  He goes, relax.
[00:42:18.794 --> 00:42:19.695]  We're going to fix that soon.
[00:42:20.632 --> 00:42:21.914]  And we know what the fix is.
[00:42:21.914 --> 00:42:22.455]  We've seen it.
[00:42:22.455 --> 00:42:24.037]  We know what this journey looks like.
[00:42:24.037 --> 00:42:34.991]  So, we have to put pressure on Trump and talk radio and C-SPAN and members of Congress to say, you understand, we get, you can have judges argue all day that our government can't regulate the internet.
[00:42:35.572 --> 00:42:58.420]  But if the Internet's becoming a regulator for the CHICOMS and the UN and the EU and radical Islam and working with all these Islamic countries to arrest Christians and kill them, you're damn right we've got a stake because these big tech companies have become cartels of any mafia that'll pay them that they work for and are intelligence crises and national security threats to not just a country but to the people of the planet!
[00:42:59.462 --> 00:43:01.783]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:43:57.478 --> 00:44:01.721]  I want to say BrainForce is great.
[00:44:01.721 --> 00:44:03.622]  I want to say TurboForce is amazing.
[00:44:03.622 --> 00:44:04.222]  It is!
[00:44:04.222 --> 00:44:05.783]  But if you took it with fish oil...
[00:44:07.063 --> 00:44:09.085]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[00:44:09.085 --> 00:44:10.427]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:44:10.427 --> 00:44:12.249]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:14.751]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:44:14.751 --> 00:44:16.373]  Brain, body, heart.
[00:44:16.373 --> 00:44:17.834]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[00:44:17.834 --> 00:44:19.216]  You've got the children's.
[00:44:19.216 --> 00:44:20.257]  You've got the adults.
[00:44:20.257 --> 00:44:21.318]  You've got the krill oil.
[00:44:21.318 --> 00:44:24.721]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[00:44:24.721 --> 00:44:27.064]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[00:44:27.284 --> 00:44:28.625]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[00:44:28.625 --> 00:44:29.385]  And I'm sorry.
[00:44:29.385 --> 00:44:30.486]  You want something like this?
[00:44:30.486 --> 00:44:31.466]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:44:31.466 --> 00:44:33.387]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:44:33.387 --> 00:44:33.988]  It's so good.
[00:44:33.988 --> 00:44:34.588]  In my view.
[00:44:34.588 --> 00:44:36.629]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:44:36.629 --> 00:44:43.012]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:44:43.012 --> 00:44:47.575]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:44:50.538 --> 00:44:56.561]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:44:56.561 --> 00:45:00.482]  I just can't do it!
[00:45:00.482 --> 00:45:08.866]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:45:08.866 --> 00:45:10.327]  Believe me, I know.
[00:45:10.327 --> 00:45:15.029]  I spend hours in front of a screen, and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:45:15.029 --> 00:45:18.090]  But thanks to Supermail Vitality at Infowarstore.com,
[00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.271]  I still have that energy.
[00:45:20.271 --> 00:45:40.422]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[00:47:03.281 --> 00:47:05.923]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:29.224]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones!
[00:47:29.224 --> 00:47:31.886]  Bertrand Russell!
[00:47:41.457 --> 00:47:45.220]  Won the highest globalist awards you can win.
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.442]  Bertrand Russell, along with H.G.
[00:47:47.442 --> 00:48:08.398]  Wells, called for a world government to be enacted, by about 1905, to create atomic weapons, to go out and nuke the nation states of the world, flying giant black stealth bombers.
[00:48:08.398 --> 00:48:11.020]  You're right, none of this had been publicly invented yet.
[00:48:12.745 --> 00:48:17.647]  And that they would have a nuclear war, an atomic war, to bring in world peace.
[00:48:17.647 --> 00:48:32.994]  But then you read later, oh, they wanted a League of Nations, they wanted a UN, they wanted a crisis, a threat of world war, a threat of the end of the world, so that we would accept their rule.
[00:48:32.994 --> 00:48:37.255]  And who was funding Bertrand Russell, the fake liberal?
[00:48:37.255 --> 00:48:40.877]  The British royal family, that's really... The German royal family, that's really...
[00:48:42.478 --> 00:48:46.040]  The Transylvanian World Family.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:50.443]  And if you don't believe me, just look everything up I said.
[00:48:50.443 --> 00:48:51.663]  Things to Come, H.G.
[00:48:51.663 --> 00:48:55.426]  Wells and an accompanying film.
[00:48:55.426 --> 00:49:09.274]  They made this film in the 30s that shows giant stealth bombers that look just like the stealth bombers they declassified in the 80s, dropping atomic bombs on cities to make nation states submit to Lucifer.
[00:49:11.189 --> 00:49:12.290]  Now why do I raise that?
[00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:23.636]  Because anybody listening can search engine that and find mainline documents admitting it.
[00:49:23.636 --> 00:49:35.723]  By the way, the globalists worship people like HG Wells and Bertrand Russell so much that in the off-record conversations I've had with top directors, top producers that try to get me to sell out, and top media owners try to get me to sell out.
[00:49:35.723 --> 00:49:37.024]  Years ago, they haven't tried in many years.
[00:49:41.463 --> 00:49:44.585]  And they go, oh, you read Bertrand Russell.
[00:49:44.585 --> 00:49:45.665]  Oh, you read.
[00:49:45.665 --> 00:49:47.266]  Did you read all the nonfiction?
[00:49:47.266 --> 00:49:51.169]  Oh, well, then, you know, it's what needs to be done.
[00:49:51.169 --> 00:49:54.411]  Like, just the fact that you read that shows you're one of us.
[00:49:54.411 --> 00:49:59.313]  You've read the sacred text.
[00:49:59.313 --> 00:50:02.895]  What, I've read what Jim Jones wrote or Charlie Manson?
[00:50:02.895 --> 00:50:03.756]  You're a crazy person.
[00:50:06.556 --> 00:50:08.437]  So, what did Bertrand Russell write?
[00:50:08.437 --> 00:50:31.274]  This is one of hundreds of quotes I could give you of these people, but he said, diet, injection, and injunctions will make the practice of the general population, the proletariat, rebelling against the elite as impossible as the practice of sheep revolting against eating mutton.
[00:50:34.662 --> 00:50:37.806]  Or sheep rebelling against humans eating sheep?
[00:50:37.806 --> 00:50:39.949]  Sheep don't know.
[00:50:39.949 --> 00:50:44.875]  Diet, what they're gonna feed us?
[00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:49.141]  Injections, the vaccines.
[00:50:49.141 --> 00:50:50.743]  Diet?
[00:50:50.743 --> 00:50:51.604]  Injections?
[00:50:52.853 --> 00:50:53.994]  And injunctions.
[00:50:53.994 --> 00:50:54.974]  He wrote a book.
[00:50:54.974 --> 00:50:55.754]  I bought the book.
[00:50:55.754 --> 00:50:56.515]  I forget the name.
[00:50:56.515 --> 00:51:01.117]  You can pull up his quote though.
[00:51:01.117 --> 00:51:04.438]  It's a little book.
[00:51:04.438 --> 00:51:11.462]  But it's all his psychotic stuff like we'll use atomic bombs, we'll depopulate the planet, we'll do this for the betterment of the left.
[00:51:13.271 --> 00:51:22.755]  The reason I raise all that to you before I hit this news, there it is, 1953, but he wrote it before that, scientific societies are yet in their infancy.
[00:51:22.755 --> 00:51:34.140]  It is to be expected that advances in physiology, psychological, will give governments much more control over individual mentality than they have even in totalitarian countries.
[00:51:36.144 --> 00:51:48.192]  Laid-down education could aim to destroy free will, so that after pupils have left school, they shall be incapable for the rest of their lives of thinking or acting otherwise than their schoolmasters would have wished.
[00:51:48.192 --> 00:51:57.578]  Diet, injections and injunctions will continue from a very early age to produce the sort of character, the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable.
[00:51:57.578 --> 00:52:00.841]  Any serious criticism of the powers that be will become
[00:52:01.701 --> 00:52:03.261]  Psychologically impossible.
[00:52:03.261 --> 00:52:04.322]  Yeah, you found another quote.
[00:52:04.322 --> 00:52:08.623]  Like I said, there's multiple quotes from what he said, but what book does it say that's from?
[00:52:08.623 --> 00:52:13.164]  Because I've read it in a book with his name on it, but it doesn't matter.
[00:52:13.164 --> 00:52:17.906]  That's the scientific manipulation of our reality.
[00:52:17.906 --> 00:52:19.506]  53.
[00:52:19.506 --> 00:52:24.147]  Which is a recodification by the daughtering eugenicist Nazi before he died.
[00:52:24.147 --> 00:52:25.208]  But I digress.
[00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:30.289]  Yeah, that's just when he was already in a hospice, people re-editing what he'd already said before, as I told you.
[00:52:31.914 --> 00:52:38.198]  Now, let's move on to the enemy's operations, may we?
[00:52:38.198 --> 00:52:49.725]  Texas, as usual, still has that spirit, despite the fact that we're close to collapse and under enemy attack and being flooded by all the vagabonds and vandals of the collapsed left.
[00:52:49.725 --> 00:52:52.186]  We're still holding on, I guess, but barely.
[00:52:52.186 --> 00:52:56.589]  And I only say that not to lower your spirits, but to raise them to save the state.
[00:52:56.589 --> 00:52:58.010]  As goes Texas, so goes the nation.
[00:52:59.335 --> 00:53:16.847]  Proposed new taxes would demand... You guys go ahead and print me some of those news articles on this, because what I'm going to do is... I'm going to go ahead and move this to the next hour.
[00:53:16.847 --> 00:53:22.771]  Because I want to properly cover all this.
[00:53:22.771 --> 00:53:26.133]  And then we'll get Leo Zagami on a little bit after that.
[00:53:26.133 --> 00:53:28.395]  It was in mainstream news two weeks ago.
[00:53:30.965 --> 00:53:37.527]  And it's a big deal.
[00:53:37.527 --> 00:53:39.948]  It's not just on Infowars.com from Natural News.
[00:53:39.948 --> 00:53:55.994]  It's all over the news here in Texas that they've introduced a bill where vaccines actually have to be tested for safety.
[00:53:57.037 --> 00:53:58.618]  Oh no, they're not tested for safety.
[00:53:58.618 --> 00:54:08.482]  They're tested for attacking your cerebral cortex with autoimmune responses that lower your IQ and make you a physical invalid for the rest of your life.
[00:54:08.482 --> 00:54:10.363]  But that's only the beginning.
[00:54:10.363 --> 00:54:20.268]  Under the rubric of the term vaccines, they're putting live viruses, live bacteria, nanotech, adjuvants into the body.
[00:54:20.268 --> 00:54:24.970]  So proposed new Texas law would demand safety studies for vaccines.
[00:54:28.038 --> 00:54:31.621]  No wonder the entire vaccine industry opposes it.
[00:54:31.621 --> 00:54:33.262]  Now you're probably thinking, wait, all drugs?
[00:54:33.262 --> 00:54:35.303]  I mean, it takes a decade to get a drug approved.
[00:54:35.303 --> 00:54:36.904]  Certainly a vaccine is approved.
[00:54:36.904 --> 00:54:38.085]  Oh, no.
[00:54:38.085 --> 00:54:56.959]  It's announced by a state governor or by the president or by the federal government to be an emergency, going back to polio, and then it's triggered to give untested, liability-protected vaccines that have cancer viruses like SV40, you name it, embedded in them by design.
[00:55:01.058 --> 00:55:05.960]  So we have the Democrats openly trying to make it forced inoculation nationwide.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:11.523]  They're using beta tests in places like New York City to go target the Orthodox Jews and make them take shots.
[00:55:11.523 --> 00:55:29.711]  So in America in 2019, Orthodox Jews are being forcibly injected by governments at the behest of big pharma makers who have liability protection and who do no safety testing by companies like Bayer that now owns Monsanto when Bayer literally was the main Nazi company.
[00:55:30.851 --> 00:55:31.912]  So I'll say it again.
[00:55:31.912 --> 00:55:39.238]  Jews are being forcibly injected in New York City by the pharmaceutical companies that ran Hitler's operation.
[00:55:39.238 --> 00:55:41.559]  You can't make that up.
[00:55:41.559 --> 00:55:43.281]  That's why I get show up shat.
[00:55:45.213 --> 00:55:50.841]  But if you read the fine print in New York or California, they admit illegal aliens are bringing in the measles, mumps, rubella.
[00:55:50.841 --> 00:55:53.224]  And people that have been inoculated are getting it!
[00:55:53.224 --> 00:55:53.805]  Oh!
[00:55:53.805 --> 00:56:00.654]  So now you need to be forcibly inoculated again with whatever the hell they're secretly putting into the shots.
[00:56:02.128 --> 00:56:04.671]  The article's up on Infowars.com.
[00:56:04.671 --> 00:56:08.876]  Proposed new Texas law would demand safety studies for vaccines.
[00:56:08.876 --> 00:56:12.880]  Because federally, they've been given protection and no studies are done.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:19.888]  But every other supposed drug is studied, but not quote, anything the government wants to inject into you.
[00:56:22.825 --> 00:56:29.952]  They ship in the illegal aliens, they spread it, then you gotta take more shots of experimental secret garbage that has liability protection.
[00:56:29.952 --> 00:56:35.277]  But after all, diet, injections, and injunctions are gonna make you behave like a sheep.
[00:56:35.277 --> 00:56:46.067]  So drink your fluoride, sheep, eat your GMO, sheep, take your deadly vaccine, sheep, and get ready to have double X's in your eyes and get buried in the ground, because it's better for the globalist that you just roll over and die.
[00:56:46.547 --> 00:56:48.148]  But we're not doing that, are we?
[00:56:48.148 --> 00:56:54.912]  And that's why it's important that listeners take this clip once we post it to Infowars.com and get it out to everyone they know.
[00:56:54.912 --> 00:56:57.673]  Shouldn't these things not have liability protection?
[00:56:57.673 --> 00:56:59.134]  Shouldn't they be tested?
[00:56:59.134 --> 00:57:00.675]  Shouldn't there be safety studies?
[00:57:00.675 --> 00:57:06.298]  Hell, at the store it says on the back of a bottle of shampoo, not tested on animals.
[00:57:06.298 --> 00:57:08.159]  But see, they're not testing on animals.
[00:57:08.159 --> 00:57:10.781]  They're testing on you and your newborn baby.
[00:57:11.715 --> 00:57:16.104]  When your newborn baby dies, they're gonna give you some long excuse about why it happened.
[00:57:16.104 --> 00:57:18.209]  And the average doctor or nurse is compartmentalized.
[00:57:18.209 --> 00:57:19.512]  They don't understand either.
[00:57:19.512 --> 00:57:20.454]  It's all part of a larger plan.
[00:57:21.357 --> 00:57:26.880]  If you want to hear more of this powerful information that the globalists absolutely dread, InfoWareStore.com.

[00:57:46.669 --> 00:57:47.009]  Stay with us.
[00:57:49.554 --> 00:57:57.377]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[00:57:57.377 --> 00:58:00.719]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[00:58:00.719 --> 00:58:03.800]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.361]  I didn't invent all this.
[00:58:05.361 --> 00:58:11.924]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[00:58:11.924 --> 00:58:14.725]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[00:58:15.782 --> 00:58:19.123]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[00:58:19.123 --> 00:58:22.044]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[00:58:22.044 --> 00:58:23.745]  That sends chills up my spine.
[00:58:23.745 --> 00:58:37.289]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[00:58:37.289 --> 00:58:39.230]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:45.145]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[00:58:45.145 --> 00:58:47.592]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[00:58:50.743 --> 00:58:55.587]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:58:55.587 --> 00:59:05.054]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[00:59:05.054 --> 00:59:09.837]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[00:59:09.837 --> 00:59:20.105]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support
[00:59:20.165 --> 00:59:20.645]  I think so.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:58.290]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:02.678]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:00:05.441 --> 01:00:10.925]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:00:10.925 --> 01:00:19.452]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:00:19.452 --> 01:00:30.921]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[01:00:30.921 --> 01:00:32.443]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[01:00:33.223 --> 01:00:49.169]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:00:49.169 --> 01:00:51.890]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:58.272]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[01:01:00.976 --> 01:01:03.617]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:01:03.617 --> 01:01:14.841]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:24.284]  After Wikileaks released the DNC emails, corporate media accused Julian Assange of trying to influence an election.
[01:01:24.284 --> 01:01:26.865]  Are you trying to influence the election results in the US?
[01:01:29.182 --> 01:01:30.903]  We're doing as we've always done.
[01:01:30.903 --> 01:01:37.545]  We're trying to educate our audience to understand how the world works in practice.
[01:01:37.545 --> 01:01:44.028]  After they released the Podesta emails, all hell broke loose on the internet.
[01:01:44.028 --> 01:01:50.170]  And when President Trump was elected, the Deep State blamed Wikileaks and the Russians.
[01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:58.173]  Russian Wikileaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me, but got scared off.
[01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:02.111]  Julian Assange has denied this.
[01:02:02.111 --> 01:02:08.615]  Our source is not the Russian government and it is not the state party.
[01:02:08.615 --> 01:02:21.743]  One month after Ecuador was granted 4.2 billion dollars by the IMF, their embassy in London expelled Julian Assange for leaving dirty dishes in the kitchen sink.
[01:02:21.743 --> 01:02:27.086]  Assange was charged by the United States for conspiracy to commit computer intrusion
[01:02:28.573 --> 01:02:35.138]  While running for president, Donald Trump appealed to his base by praising the work of WikiLeaks.
[01:02:35.138 --> 01:02:35.979]  WikiLeaks!
[01:02:35.979 --> 01:02:38.261]  I love WikiLeaks!
[01:02:38.261 --> 01:02:44.546]  But now, President Trump has nothing to say about the charges against Julian Assange.
[01:02:44.546 --> 01:02:46.128]  I know nothing about WikiLeaks.
[01:02:46.128 --> 01:02:47.509]  It's not my thing.
[01:02:47.509 --> 01:02:57.297]  Last August, Rand Paul said that Assange should be offered immunity and brought to testify about his publication of the Democratic Party documents.
[01:02:58.744 --> 01:03:07.090]  Seth Rich was an employee of the DNC and was murdered just weeks before the DNC emails were published.
[01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:10.632]  It was reported that he was in contact with WikiLeaks.
[01:03:10.632 --> 01:03:14.835]  An investigator now says Seth Rich was in contact with WikiLeaks.
[01:03:14.835 --> 01:03:19.718]  Not only that, he claims there's been a law enforcement cover-up.
[01:03:19.718 --> 01:03:25.362]  WikiLeaks has hinted in the past that Seth Rich was the source for their DNC emails.
[01:03:26.835 --> 01:03:38.724]  The corporate media have been smearing the name of Julian Assange and ignoring the fact that an actual journalist has been arrested by the United States for reporting the news.
[01:03:38.724 --> 01:03:42.167]  The guardians of speech are now the enemies of speech.
[01:03:42.167 --> 01:03:46.430]  The people charged with policing power are now colluding with power.
[01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:49.853]  We're not saying any of this to defend Julian Assange.
[01:03:49.853 --> 01:03:55.518]  We just want to be absolutely clear about who hurts this country more, and it's not him.
[01:03:56.491 --> 01:04:00.775]  Will Julian Assange be playing a role towards justice being served in America?
[01:04:00.775 --> 01:04:07.141]  Or has President Trump been compromised by the deep state?
[01:04:07.141 --> 01:04:12.086]  Patriots and truth seekers are eagerly awaiting to find out.
[01:04:12.086 --> 01:04:14.589]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:04:29.582 --> 01:04:30.722]  InfoWars.
[01:04:30.722 --> 01:04:31.903]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:04:31.903 --> 01:04:40.545]  Today.
[01:04:40.545 --> 01:04:45.426]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:04:45.426 --> 01:04:46.887]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:04:58.490 --> 01:05:04.496]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:05:04.496 --> 01:05:07.460]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.

[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.090]  Another time in the Age of Wonder.
[01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:31.311]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:31.311 --> 01:06:40.513]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:40.513 --> 01:06:50.815]  Sol Pais, formerly from Brazil, living in America, supposedly left Florida days ago dressed in canoe and black,
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:07:04.850]  And made statements on social media that she was planning something associated with the anniversary of Columbine that just so happens to come on Hitler's birthday that so many of these black prince coat killers attack on.
[01:07:04.850 --> 01:07:07.312]  But she'd be the first woman to attack on that date.
[01:07:07.312 --> 01:07:10.414]  But it's now been reported that law enforcement says she's dead.
[01:07:10.414 --> 01:07:15.898]  Just minutes ago, we don't know why she's dead or how she's dead, but the FBI speculating that they caught her on the highway.
[01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:17.440]  There may have been some type of shootout.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.360]  She may have killed herself.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:18.921]  We don't know.
[01:07:20.367 --> 01:07:25.031]  But her name in Portuguese means sunshine.
[01:07:25.031 --> 01:07:27.173]  So sunshine is dead.
[01:07:27.173 --> 01:07:28.374]  Repeat.
[01:07:28.374 --> 01:07:29.955]  Sunshine is dead.
[01:07:29.955 --> 01:07:32.077]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:07:32.077 --> 01:07:33.618]  John has a long mustache.
[01:07:33.618 --> 01:07:39.023]  And for all forces on or behind enemy lines, this song is for you.
[01:07:39.023 --> 01:07:40.644]  Seriously, sunshine is dead.
[01:07:40.644 --> 01:07:46.529]  And isn't it interesting how they get to bring up Columbine, they get to bring up San Diego, they get to bring up
[01:07:47.944 --> 01:08:01.226]  Parkland, and re-traumatize everybody, including the families, constantly lying about yours truly, saying that I say that Parkland never happened, that I won't stop saying it didn't happen.
[01:08:01.226 --> 01:08:03.347]  No, I said the police stood down, which is now confirmed.
[01:08:03.347 --> 01:08:05.427]  We broke that.
[01:08:05.427 --> 01:08:08.268]  But she's deader than a doornail, they tell us.
[01:08:08.268 --> 01:08:12.048]  And boy, is it funny, just to have the anniversary of Columbine.
[01:08:12.048 --> 01:08:14.809]  Is it the 20th anniversary?
[01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:15.149]  Happened in 1999.
[01:08:17.765 --> 01:08:21.086]  And so magically, on the 20th anniversary, how do you get it back out there?
[01:08:21.086 --> 01:08:21.786]  Guns are bad.
[01:08:21.786 --> 01:08:23.607]  It's all happening.
[01:08:23.607 --> 01:08:25.447]  A crazy woman.
[01:08:25.447 --> 01:08:26.547]  I'm not saying it's a false flag.
[01:08:26.547 --> 01:08:27.308]  I'm not saying it's staged.
[01:08:27.308 --> 01:08:29.748]  But we should... This woman has due process, right?
[01:08:29.748 --> 01:08:30.528]  She's supposedly dead.
[01:08:30.528 --> 01:08:32.389]  We just hear she's dead.
[01:08:32.389 --> 01:08:33.769]  There's this woman that left Miami.
[01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:35.910]  She's coming to her kids.
[01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:39.831]  60% of the schools are all closed in Colorado.
[01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:46.295]  And now it brings back Columbine all over again.
[01:08:46.295 --> 01:08:52.462]  Harris and Kleibold and their black prince coats and their devil worship just like Adam Lanza.
[01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:58.730]  Probably forget Adam Lanza from what happened tragically at Sandy Hook because I'm the Sandy Hook villain now.
[01:08:59.963 --> 01:09:07.225]  And there's no doubt of this, the corporate media are a bunch of vampires invoking mass shootings to create mentally ill copycats.
[01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:28.451]  So, whether this was staged completely and some innocent woman got hopped up on drugs by some leftist group in a big Jussie Smollett-style false flag, which is possible, or whether she's a schizophrenic crazy so obsessed with mass shooting news that the mainstream media won't stop hyping that somehow she had some, you know, schizophrenic break that she was gonna do this, but she's dead now!
[01:09:30.083 --> 01:09:43.319]  And so 60% of the schools closed in the dreaded fear of one young woman, Little Sunshine, Sol Pais, who's now dead.
[01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:46.103]  Let's go ahead and go to part of that Fox News breaking report.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.881]  This is the breaking news right now.
[01:09:48.881 --> 01:10:02.894]  The FBI is saying that the woman you see in the center of your screen, 18-year-old Sol Pais, is the person that they have been looking for after getting credible threats that they felt had happened from her.
[01:10:02.894 --> 01:10:04.916]  She traveled from Miami... You know, hit pause again.
[01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:09.632]  Men commit 99% of violent crimes.
[01:10:09.632 --> 01:10:14.216]  Women sometimes poison people or stuff like that, but it's only passive-aggressive.
[01:10:14.216 --> 01:10:16.838]  Who really believes this woman was going to shoot a bunch of kids?
[01:10:16.838 --> 01:10:20.501]  But see, now you can't even trust women.
[01:10:20.501 --> 01:10:28.467]  Now you can't even trust women.
[01:10:28.467 --> 01:10:30.048]  And it's this credible threat.
[01:10:30.048 --> 01:10:33.551]  Remember the guy with no criminal record, the fellow from Australia?
[01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:35.110]  I think?
[01:11:05.592 --> 01:11:08.653]  So it's this new saying, like, well, we felt he was a threat.
[01:11:08.653 --> 01:11:09.154]  Well, I mean, who knows?
[01:11:09.154 --> 01:11:16.577]  This woman may have been real, may have been a threat, maybe a loon, but how do we even know what this is on the anniversary of Columbine?
[01:11:16.577 --> 01:11:21.059]  Because the deep state can't get away with completely staging stuff anymore, can they?
[01:11:21.059 --> 01:11:23.820]  They've just got to hype things up and give you the memory of things.
[01:11:24.758 --> 01:11:28.219]  And I'll tell you, Columbine's really suspicious.
[01:11:28.219 --> 01:11:37.682]  The Aurora shooting, where the guy said he was under mind control, and he was in a secret DARPA program of mind control, and he told the police he was under mind control, and the witnesses reported multiple shooters.
[01:11:37.682 --> 01:11:40.742]  I mean, hell, they're telling us no arson at the cathedral, Notre Dame.
[01:11:40.742 --> 01:11:44.343]  They're telling us no Islam, when the fire's an hour old.
[01:11:44.343 --> 01:11:46.164]  Even Lou Dobbs says there's a cover-up.
[01:11:46.164 --> 01:11:47.384]  But you're not supposed to question.
[01:11:47.384 --> 01:11:48.104]  I'm sorry.
[01:11:48.104 --> 01:11:49.185]  Let's go back to this lady.
[01:11:49.185 --> 01:11:51.265]  They just tell us it's dead.
[01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:53.646]  Half the state's locked down in dread of a woman.
[01:11:53.646 --> 01:11:54.006]  Here it is.
[01:11:54.565 --> 01:12:08.556]  We don't know the specificity of those threats and what they had to do with the high school, but we can tell you that she was quote-unquote, according to police, infatuated with the mass shooting that happened there, what will be 20 years ago this Saturday.
[01:12:08.556 --> 01:12:14.901]  Infatuated when they admit that all this hype of mass shootings is what's triggering many mentally ill people to do it.
[01:12:14.901 --> 01:12:16.141]  So what does corporate media do?
[01:12:16.141 --> 01:12:19.964]  Hype it, hype it, hype it, continue.
[01:12:19.964 --> 01:12:22.586]  Alicia, things changing in the last few minutes.
[01:12:22.586 --> 01:12:23.167]  What's happening?
[01:12:24.395 --> 01:12:28.258]  Hi Harris, things are changing very quickly and we've been in contact with KDVR.
[01:12:28.258 --> 01:12:39.866]  This is the Fox affiliate here in Denver who we work very closely with and the reporter on the scene there with the FBI says an agent came up to them and told them there is no one in custody that the suspect is dead.
[01:12:39.866 --> 01:12:42.948]  Again, that is according to the local Fox affiliate KDVR.
[01:12:42.948 --> 01:12:46.391]  Fox News Channel is... Hit pause again!
[01:12:46.391 --> 01:12:47.872]  There is no arson.
[01:12:47.872 --> 01:12:48.932]  There is no terrorism.
[01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:51.394]  Oh, and by the way, this woman you're looking for, she's just dead.
[01:12:51.394 --> 01:12:52.035]  Just announced it.
[01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:53.095]  She's just bye-bye.
[01:12:53.095 --> 01:12:53.616]  Let's continue.
[01:12:55.742 --> 01:13:09.618]  Very important information but as you did mention the FBI field office here in Denver has tweeted within the last few minutes an update saying in all caps that there is no longer a threat to the community.
[01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:15.965]  Earlier what they had said that there was a credible threat in the form of 18 year old Sol Pais
[01:13:16.565 --> 01:13:28.718]  From Miami, Florida, who again, they say the Miami field office had warned them on Monday evening that there was somebody who was traveling here to Colorado that they might need to know about.
[01:13:28.718 --> 01:13:38.828]  Apparently when she landed, according to the FBI here in Denver, once she landed she managed to make it to a store and acquire some sort of shotgun and ammunition and then disappeared.
[01:13:39.469 --> 01:13:39.849]  We're good to go.
[01:14:02.486 --> 01:14:03.947]  ...has died.
[01:14:03.947 --> 01:14:05.229]  She's deceased.
[01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:15.057]  We don't have a lot of detail on this, but we can confirm, according to authorities there in Denver, per law enforcement source, the Columbine suspect woman is dead.
[01:14:15.057 --> 01:14:18.260]  Unclear if that wound was self-inflicted.
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.841]  We are still on the story.
[01:14:19.841 --> 01:14:24.665]  This had dozens of schools, Alicia, as we know from our own reporting... 60% of the state.
[01:14:24.665 --> 01:14:25.987]  ...shutting their doors today.
[01:14:26.687 --> 01:14:28.049]  All right, that's enough.
[01:14:28.049 --> 01:14:28.910]  Let's stop right there.
[01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:32.433]  So we've got millions of illegal aliens pouring in, committing massive crimes everywhere.
[01:14:32.433 --> 01:14:35.036]  You've got illegal aliens that shoot at cops, kill cops.
[01:14:35.036 --> 01:14:35.857]  There'll be a manhunt.
[01:14:35.857 --> 01:14:37.599]  They don't shut states down.
[01:14:37.599 --> 01:14:39.521]  But notice, it's just total fear.
[01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:41.403]  Shut 60% of the schools.
[01:14:41.403 --> 01:14:41.884]  Do it all.
[01:14:41.884 --> 01:14:42.905]  There's a woman.
[01:14:42.905 --> 01:14:43.966]  She's got a shotgun.
[01:14:43.966 --> 01:14:45.007]  She's in camo.
[01:14:45.007 --> 01:14:47.750]  Maybe she's just schizophrenic.
[01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:48.310]  Might be true.
[01:14:49.616 --> 01:14:59.742]  But just, we're allowed to ask questions about Notre Dame, or about Jussie Smollett, or about Gulf of Tonkin, or about babies and incubators against the Gulf War, or about Russiagate being a fraud.
[01:15:01.027 --> 01:15:05.491]  And as much fraud as we've seen, this thing really smells to high heaven.
[01:15:05.491 --> 01:15:08.253]  We'll follow this more throughout the day as it unfolds.
[01:15:08.253 --> 01:15:20.463]  Looking at Notre Dame though, Leo Zagami, investigative journalist, best-selling author from Rome, who's also an expert obviously and lived in Paris, will give us his take on what the inside scoop is in the Vatican.
[01:15:20.463 --> 01:15:28.029]  And again, he's exposed the Vatican because a lot of inside sources on what exactly is going on there while we're told that we should not investigate.
[01:15:29.093 --> 01:15:36.616]  You know, a lot of radical Muslims are all over the world celebrating Notre Dame going up in a towering inferno.
[01:15:36.616 --> 01:15:44.299]  Please don't forget, we're running a once a year, been over a year now, mega sale, all InfoWars apparel.

[01:17:02.395 --> 01:17:07.459]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[01:17:07.459 --> 01:17:14.644]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[01:17:14.644 --> 01:17:19.208]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[01:17:19.793 --> 01:17:23.434]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[01:17:23.434 --> 01:17:26.555]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[01:17:26.555 --> 01:17:29.176]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[01:17:29.176 --> 01:17:30.696]  Get sober now.

[01:18:05.067 --> 01:18:07.547]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:18:07.547 --> 01:18:11.189]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late-term abortion and all great it is.
[01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:13.970]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:15.050]  What is the top tumor?
[01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:17.191]  It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:18:17.191 --> 01:18:19.212]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[01:18:19.212 --> 01:18:20.272]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[01:18:20.272 --> 01:18:22.093]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:18:22.213 --> 01:18:25.937]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in a bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:18:25.937 --> 01:18:29.001]  I'm like, uh, what's the highest you could do a month later?
[01:18:29.001 --> 01:18:29.241]  Uh, 90, 95%.
[01:18:29.241 --> 01:18:30.683]  No one's ever done that.
[01:18:30.683 --> 01:18:32.625]  I said, how much does that cost for a bottle?
[01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:33.366]  It costs $10.
[01:18:33.366 --> 01:18:35.068]  No one's ever done that.
[01:18:35.068 --> 01:18:36.850]  Sir, the average competitor's 3 to 5%.
[01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:37.550]  The top brand's 50%.
[01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:39.212]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:18:41.735 --> 01:18:44.659]  I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information's explosive?
[01:18:44.659 --> 01:18:45.259]  Our fish oil.
[01:18:45.259 --> 01:18:47.803]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[01:18:47.803 --> 01:18:48.864]  My children take it.
[01:18:48.864 --> 01:18:53.209]  You think I'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:56.213]  You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[01:18:56.213 --> 01:18:56.553]  Never!
[01:18:58.291 --> 01:19:01.552]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[01:19:01.552 --> 01:19:04.774]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:11.417]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[01:19:11.417 --> 01:19:12.557]  X2 is back.
[01:19:12.557 --> 01:19:13.338]  We got it.
[01:19:13.338 --> 01:19:15.018]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[01:19:15.018 --> 01:19:16.619]  We rushed it into production.
[01:19:16.619 --> 01:19:17.399]  It's been bottled.
[01:19:17.399 --> 01:19:19.400]  The labels are being put on today.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.142]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the
[01:19:23.302 --> 01:19:23.402]  Yeah.
[01:19:40.447 --> 01:19:41.947]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:09.344 --> 01:20:09.545]  Yeah.
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.282]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:50.282 --> 01:20:54.705]  Leo Zagami is joining us, coming up in a few minutes.
[01:20:54.705 --> 01:21:13.100]  So, Sol Pais, this former Brazilian woman, Portuguese background, living in the capital of Latin America, Miami, supposedly flew to outside Denver, went and bought a shotgun, put herself in camo,
[01:21:13.991 --> 01:21:17.992]  And they were reporting earlier they didn't know the cause of death, but the FBI said the threat was over.
[01:21:17.992 --> 01:21:25.295]  With 60% of the schools closed in Colorado, that's 180,000 students plus.
[01:21:25.295 --> 01:21:30.657]  Now, just minutes ago, they're now reporting that they believe she took her own life.
[01:21:30.657 --> 01:21:36.799]  And this fits more in with the MO of all the media hype around mass shootings, that women don't do mass shootings.
[01:21:36.799 --> 01:21:37.560]  Not that we know of.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.381]  Other than maybe Bonnie and Clyde.
[01:21:41.485 --> 01:21:42.866]  Bonnie being the female side of that.
[01:21:42.866 --> 01:21:44.308]  It's very, very rare.
[01:21:44.308 --> 01:21:51.194]  But to get attention, to be on the news, to be somebody, this would certainly do it.
[01:21:51.194 --> 01:21:54.057]  And this is why a lot of people do mass shootings.
[01:21:54.057 --> 01:21:58.401]  That's why in the old days, our government media didn't really promote terrorist attacks in this country.
[01:21:58.401 --> 01:22:00.383]  They played them down because they didn't want more of them.
[01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:04.500]  But they do play up the mass shootings.
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.261]  They're a bunch of ghouls, a bunch of vampires.
[01:22:06.261 --> 01:22:08.263]  But this whole thing should be investigated.
[01:22:08.263 --> 01:22:09.444]  We should skeptically look at it.
[01:22:09.444 --> 01:22:15.008]  Because of the history of things being manipulated and staged, we have to do that.
[01:22:15.008 --> 01:22:19.112]  That's why they're telling people within an hour of the Notre Dame fire even starting.
[01:22:19.112 --> 01:22:20.893]  Not Islamic, not terror, not arson.
[01:22:20.893 --> 01:22:23.975]  Even though the government says no, we're still investigating its cause.
[01:22:23.975 --> 01:22:26.377]  They don't want people to ask questions.
[01:22:26.377 --> 01:22:28.039]  So here's Fox News with the latest.
[01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:31.052]  They knew that she traveled from Miami to Denver.
[01:22:39.284 --> 01:22:48.390]  And they knew that she was infatuated with the killing, the mass shooting, nearly 20 years ago at Columbine High School.
[01:22:48.390 --> 01:23:02.298]  In the middle of the night, we have learned from our reporter Alicia Acuna, between 1 and 3 in the morning, they were trying to decide what to do with the largest public school system in the state and beyond.
[01:23:02.298 --> 01:23:05.140]  They made the decision to shut down 60% of the public schools
[01:23:07.412 --> 01:23:08.893]  In the state of Colorado.
[01:23:08.893 --> 01:23:13.878]  580,000 students affected by this.
[01:23:13.878 --> 01:23:18.321]  And they did so because they weren't sure what this woman would do.
[01:23:18.321 --> 01:23:19.062]  She was armed.
[01:23:19.062 --> 01:23:24.927]  She bought ammunition and a weapon after she landed in the Denver area.
[01:23:24.927 --> 01:23:26.748]  And they were looking for her.
[01:23:26.748 --> 01:23:30.451]  They found her body a short time ago in an area called Mount Evans.
[01:23:30.451 --> 01:23:33.094]  That's about 60 miles outside the Denver area.
[01:23:33.094 --> 01:23:34.395]  It's a recreational area.
[01:23:35.751 --> 01:23:44.763]  As we learn more details on what the city apparently has dodged today because of great police work and the FBI, we'll bring it to you.
[01:23:44.763 --> 01:23:46.386]  A news conference is coming up at 1.30.
[01:23:46.386 --> 01:23:47.587]  We'll cover it.
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:55.363]  But this whole thing needs to be investigated, obviously.
[01:23:55.363 --> 01:24:02.808]  Just the hysteria associated with mass shootings and building up the 20th anniversary of Columbine that launched the modern age of this.
[01:24:02.808 --> 01:24:11.834]  Young devil worshippers in black trench coats that play shoot-em-up video games all day and who love Hitler and love Stalin, this is the MO, going out to do something evil for their God.
[01:24:11.834 --> 01:24:16.117]  Why don't we profile these people?
[01:24:16.117 --> 01:24:18.019]  But we don't profile these people.
[01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:19.059]  Leo Zagami from
[01:24:20.163 --> 01:24:22.425]  Italy joins us from Rome.
[01:24:22.425 --> 01:24:28.711]  Obviously, he is somebody that studies and writes about corruption in the Vatican, has been the vanguard of exposing it.
[01:24:28.711 --> 01:24:41.382]  I want to get his take right off the bat about Notre Dame, and within 30 minutes of the fire, we're told by corporate media everywhere, no Muslims, no Islam, no terror, don't ask questions.
[01:24:41.382 --> 01:24:44.345]  Which really begs the question, what are they trying to cover up, Leo?
[01:24:55.177 --> 01:25:04.162]  Alright, well we've had some Skype problems really bad lately and we had Leo working and good a minute ago, but we'll talk about that.
[01:25:04.162 --> 01:25:06.964]  We're going to start our next segment.
[01:25:06.964 --> 01:25:08.605]  It's not a problem.
[01:25:08.605 --> 01:25:09.425]  We're going to go to you, Leo.
[01:25:09.425 --> 01:25:16.149]  We're going to do it because it's important and it's a good thing to do for everybody here.
[01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:18.631]  Let me just compose myself for a moment.
[01:25:21.451 --> 01:25:24.453]  I mean, this begs the question here.
[01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:26.215]  Why are they up front saying something?
[01:25:26.215 --> 01:25:33.641]  Even Lou Dobbs came out and said this looks political to say don't investigate Notre Dame.
[01:25:33.641 --> 01:25:35.602]  It is more than political.
[01:25:35.602 --> 01:25:45.750]  It is something to do with one of the most sacred places not only of Christianity, because it predates Christianity.
[01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:50.314]  It used to be the Temple of Jupiter, and we know the close connection between Macron and Jupiter.
[01:25:51.174 --> 01:26:00.624]  Notre Dame was even for a time taken over during the revolution in 1793 and transformed into the Temple of Reason.
[01:26:00.624 --> 01:26:15.278]  One thing is for sure, Notre Dame belongs for the last hundred years to the French government, but they have given a sort of possibility to the Catholic Church to use it, but it's the Catholic Church that theoretically
[01:26:15.578 --> 01:26:15.758]  I think
[01:26:34.877 --> 01:26:43.683]  Final statement on this tragic episode, which touches the most visited cathedral after Saint Peter.
[01:26:43.683 --> 01:26:48.426]  So, I mean, it's very strange that Pope Francis didn't intervene.
[01:26:48.426 --> 01:26:55.611]  Of course, we have also the situation regarding the possible connections with Islamic attacks.
[01:26:55.611 --> 01:26:57.632]  I mean, there have been people that, of course,
[01:26:58.873 --> 01:27:04.998]  Muslims had attempted some kind of attacks on this church prior to this episode.
[01:27:04.998 --> 01:27:08.081]  So, of course, there is a lot of suspicion here.
[01:27:08.081 --> 01:27:20.252]  And in the mix of all this, there was also the sighting of a strange figure on top of the cathedral while the whole place was going on fire.
[01:27:20.782 --> 01:27:27.083]  There was a very strange figure and it was caught in front of the cameras of TVs worldwide.
[01:27:27.083 --> 01:27:31.484]  So I pointed, I wanted to do a close up of this figure.
[01:27:31.484 --> 01:27:35.045]  And of course, some people can say it looks like the ghost of Osama Bin Laden.
[01:27:35.045 --> 01:27:39.786]  No, it's not the ghost of Osama Bin Laden, but it is a Knights Templar.
[01:27:39.786 --> 01:27:44.447]  That is actually a Knights Templar and how they used to dress back in the days.
[01:27:45.678 --> 01:27:55.343]  Now, we know there is a lot of stories about ghosts in Notre Dame, but this one is pretty weird to see it in front of our eyes.
[01:27:55.343 --> 01:28:04.407]  So, I mean, of course, I wanted to point out on that, but also is the period of time we are focusing on here from the 15th of April to the 1st of May.
[01:28:05.564 --> 01:28:26.799]  Every year we have massacres, we have very terrible events happening, because it coincides with then the culmination, which is of course between the 1st of April and the 1st of May, Beltane, this festival of ancient origins, where you of course set a bonfire, you set everything on fire.
[01:28:26.799 --> 01:28:28.420]  And these special bonfires
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:37.024]  Could this be a way to change the subject from the yellow vest and bring France together under globalist rule?
[01:28:37.024 --> 01:28:39.866]  Let's talk about it with Leo Zegami straight ahead.
[01:28:39.866 --> 01:28:42.927]  And who is that strange figure?
[01:28:57.759 --> 01:29:02.820]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:08.182]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[01:29:08.182 --> 01:29:16.224]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[01:29:16.224 --> 01:29:21.666]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[01:29:21.666 --> 01:29:23.666]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[01:29:27.154 --> 01:29:31.016]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:31.016 --> 01:29:35.998]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:35.998 --> 01:29:40.820]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:42.180]  Don't just take my word for it.

[01:29:47.302 --> 01:29:47.862]  HBExtract.com.
[01:29:47.862 --> 01:29:50.163]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:58.510 --> 01:30:01.391]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[01:30:01.391 --> 01:30:03.391]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[01:30:03.391 --> 01:30:06.312]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[01:30:06.312 --> 01:30:09.632]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:30:09.632 --> 01:30:12.733]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:30:12.733 --> 01:30:14.293]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:30:14.293 --> 01:30:20.854]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:30:20.854 --> 01:30:23.655]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[01:30:24.707 --> 01:30:28.068]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[01:30:28.068 --> 01:30:32.689]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:46.211]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:30:46.211 --> 01:30:48.152]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[01:30:48.792 --> 01:30:54.075]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[01:30:54.075 --> 01:30:59.379]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[01:30:59.379 --> 01:31:00.800]  I want to say BrainForce is great.
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.741]  I want to say TurboForce is amazing.
[01:31:02.741 --> 01:31:03.322]  It is!
[01:31:03.322 --> 01:31:04.903]  But if you took it with fish oil...
[01:31:06.162 --> 01:31:08.185]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[01:31:08.185 --> 01:31:09.346]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:31:09.346 --> 01:31:11.349]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:31:11.349 --> 01:31:13.852]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:31:13.852 --> 01:31:15.474]  Brain, body, heart.
[01:31:15.474 --> 01:31:16.936]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[01:31:16.936 --> 01:31:18.318]  You've got the children's.
[01:31:18.318 --> 01:31:19.419]  You've got the adults.
[01:31:19.419 --> 01:31:20.420]  You've got the krill oil.
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:23.745]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[01:31:24.025 --> 01:31:26.386]  I'll give you the burpees, but krill oils is the best.
[01:31:26.386 --> 01:31:27.746]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:31:27.746 --> 01:31:28.486]  And I'm just sorry.
[01:31:28.486 --> 01:31:29.586]  You want something like this?
[01:31:29.586 --> 01:31:30.566]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:31:30.566 --> 01:31:32.467]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:31:32.467 --> 01:31:33.087]  It's so good.
[01:31:33.087 --> 01:31:33.707]  In my view.
[01:31:33.707 --> 01:31:35.748]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:31:35.748 --> 01:31:42.109]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:31:42.109 --> 01:31:46.670]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:31:49.636 --> 01:31:55.663]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:31:55.663 --> 01:31:56.384]  I just can't do it!
[01:31:59.116 --> 01:32:08.782]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[01:32:08.782 --> 01:32:15.266]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[01:32:15.266 --> 01:32:16.767]  Then they set the precedent.
[01:32:16.767 --> 01:32:20.890]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[01:32:21.630 --> 01:32:23.090]  They take you off the internet.
[01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:33.893]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform, because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[01:32:33.893 --> 01:32:44.716]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist, anti-human, transhumanist, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[01:32:44.716 --> 01:32:46.377]  And if we keep bowing to these cults,
[01:32:46.977 --> 01:32:53.483]  The cancer that is San Francisco and many of these big universities is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[01:32:53.483 --> 01:33:01.730]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks!
[01:33:01.730 --> 01:33:04.373]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:20.362 --> 01:33:27.104]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.104 --> 01:33:28.545]  Well, Leo Zagami,
[01:33:49.881 --> 01:33:51.482]  He's not part of the Vatican.
[01:33:51.482 --> 01:33:55.906]  Every time I say he is a Vatican insider, people go, oh my god, you've got the evil Vatican leadership on.
[01:33:55.906 --> 01:34:00.389]  Number one, the Vatican is a consortium of a bunch of different vying groups.
[01:34:00.389 --> 01:34:02.951]  Anybody that studies history knows that.
[01:34:02.951 --> 01:34:05.133]  Like any other big historic organization.
[01:34:05.133 --> 01:34:08.456]  He's been a whistleblower, someone exposing it.
[01:34:08.456 --> 01:34:11.598]  And I used to read his stuff 15 years ago and couldn't believe a lot of it.
[01:34:11.598 --> 01:34:12.619]  It's all come true.
[01:34:12.619 --> 01:34:13.420]  He's very credible.
[01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:21.834]  When he joins us right now, you should visit his website, LeoZagami.com.
[01:34:21.834 --> 01:34:22.974]  LeoZagami.com.
[01:34:22.974 --> 01:34:25.075]  You should get his books, all of it.
[01:34:25.075 --> 01:34:26.136]  He's really a smart guy.
[01:34:26.136 --> 01:34:28.817]  Hasn't steered me wrong yet.
[01:34:28.817 --> 01:34:30.038]  But notice I said to him earlier,
[01:34:31.277 --> 01:34:32.418]  I said, what's behind this?
[01:34:32.418 --> 01:34:34.699]  It's very suspicious they're saying don't look at Islamic terror.
[01:34:34.699 --> 01:34:39.243]  It's very suspicious they're saying don't ask questions when the fire was only an hour old.
[01:34:39.243 --> 01:34:42.865]  You've got Fox News, CNN, cutting off French officials saying they're looking at Islam.
[01:34:42.865 --> 01:34:47.288]  You had 800 churches attacked, torched, you name it, in the last year.
[01:34:47.288 --> 01:34:53.653]  Steven Lou Dobbs' question, you notice he didn't go right to what he thinks, he just went to the historical nature.
[01:34:53.653 --> 01:34:58.777]  And also, this was on multiple cameras, this bizarre person looks like Osama Bin Laden or a Knights Templar.
[01:34:59.853 --> 01:35:07.399]  Uh, going and hiding behind one of the pillars and then trying to run away like they didn't want to be videotaped.
[01:35:07.399 --> 01:35:11.742]  Um, that just adds to who would want to act like that while a building is a towering inferno.
[01:35:11.742 --> 01:35:18.026]  There's a lot of sects and different orders, I know, hundreds of them that, you know, visit these facilities.
[01:35:18.026 --> 01:35:21.709]  But for him to have access to those upper areas, uh, this is a pretty big deal.
[01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:24.331]  And I'm glad you hone in on that because the media spun it.
[01:35:24.331 --> 01:35:25.412]  Oh, look, there's a Muslim.
[01:35:26.112 --> 01:35:41.043]  You know, up at the top, well, no, we don't know who it is, but it's someone in medieval garb, or Middle Eastern garb, or as you said, it looks, you're right, the white with the mailed arms, and the top, it looks, when you really pause it, like a Knights Templar outfit, actually.
[01:35:42.591 --> 01:35:50.954]  Yes, because the Knights Templar were, for a long time, in the Holy Land, so they used to wear a white turban, even if they were Christian.
[01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:57.357]  And so, it actually looks like a Knights Templar, because the Knights Templars were the ones who actually financed this church, Alex.
[01:35:57.357 --> 01:36:02.919]  The church was built by operative masons under the direction of Knights Templars.
[01:36:02.919 --> 01:36:08.701]  And it kind of took a long time, as we know, but in that time, the Knights Templars were in charge.
[01:36:08.701 --> 01:36:11.842]  And then the last Grand Master of the Knights Templars, Jacques de Molay,
[01:36:14.367 --> 01:36:16.572]  Friday the 13th?
[01:36:16.572 --> 01:36:17.214]  What was that year?
[01:36:17.214 --> 01:36:19.820]  I forget, but right after they finished the cathedral, they killed him.
[01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:29.355]  Well, that was the day they started the persecution, and then after they killed them instead in March, on the 18th of March, they celebrated.
[01:36:29.355 --> 01:36:37.740]  The strange thing is that they started celebrating in the actual Cathedral of Notre Dame, and I show this with a couple of links in my latest article.
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:45.465]  They have been, the Knights Templars, for the first time in 800 years, basically, 900 years, have gone back
[01:36:46.485 --> 01:36:55.807]  to their place, because for a long time the Catholic Church, of course, had no intentions of letting the Knights Templars inside the church.
[01:36:55.807 --> 01:37:02.308]  But now, I have shown with a lot of photos and a lot of links that this is happening.
[01:37:02.308 --> 01:37:09.430]  Since 2017, they have been regularly celebrating in Notre Dame, Mass,
[01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:30.077]  I'm not sure this image is of a terrestrial nature, because ghosts are real, and in such places, they can appear.
[01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:38.380]  I was about to say, everybody says it looks like Ben Lideman, but if you look closer, it looks like the male hanging down, the male on the arms, it looks like a Templar outfit.
[01:37:39.488 --> 01:37:42.070]  And then there's another strange thing that happened.
[01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:51.398]  While all this was going on, for the first time in a long time, Pope Francis was with Pope Ratzinger, sitting in front of the TV.
[01:37:51.398 --> 01:37:58.604]  I showed it in an article, that this was this rare meeting between the two popes.
[01:37:58.604 --> 01:38:02.807]  As the cathedral was burning, the two popes were meeting up.
[01:38:02.807 --> 01:38:05.369]  By the way, that's only happened a few times.
[01:38:05.369 --> 01:38:06.450]  You're right, that's really weird.
[01:38:07.597 --> 01:38:14.382]  No, but also Pope Ratzinger was the last Pope to actually visit and celebrate Mass in Notre Dame.
[01:38:14.382 --> 01:38:28.574]  And I showed with a video that was posted by Rome Reports just after the accident that the approach that Ratzinger had, of course, was much more traditional.
[01:38:28.574 --> 01:38:35.019]  The video you can find at the bottom of my article shows Ratzinger inside Notre Dame Cathedral.
[01:38:35.419 --> 01:38:43.644]  And what he was saying and his approach was completely different from a guy who is destroying the Catholic faith and the Christian faith.
[01:38:43.644 --> 01:38:46.566]  Ratzinger, of course, was not the perfect person.
[01:38:46.566 --> 01:38:50.428]  We know he had many faults, but he's a more conservative figure.
[01:38:50.428 --> 01:39:01.194]  Lately, we have seen how he has attacked the present situation regarding sexual abuse, and he has even discussed it in... I know you don't like to speculate.
[01:39:01.294 --> 01:39:10.363]  But obviously, them saying, don't say Islamic terror, don't say arson, when the flames are 400 feet tall, that says they're covering something up, or at least wanting to control the narrative.
[01:39:10.363 --> 01:39:11.324]  What's your gut level?
[01:39:11.324 --> 01:39:12.105]  What's your intel?
[01:39:12.105 --> 01:39:13.166]  Who could be behind this?
[01:39:13.166 --> 01:39:15.308]  As you said, Islamists have tried to attack it.
[01:39:15.308 --> 01:39:16.730]  They've been celebrating it in France.
[01:39:16.730 --> 01:39:18.892]  They've been celebrating it in Canada.
[01:39:18.892 --> 01:39:21.615]  You've got university heads.
[01:39:21.615 --> 01:39:24.458]  You've got political people in Canada saying, good, burn it down.
[01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:42.240]  Well, we have seen also a famous Catholic commentator who works for the Jesuits who said immediately after he tweeted, and you reported with Paul Joseph Watson about it, and then he cancelled his tweet because the Jesuits knew that something weird was going on.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:51.086]  Of course, I think that the end purpose of all this is to destroy Christianity so they can build a temple that embraces this new religion, which is free love.
[01:39:51.086 --> 01:39:52.967]  By the way, that's on Infowars.com.
[01:39:52.967 --> 01:39:55.909]  Leftists are saying they want a New Age temple built on its place.
[01:39:57.209 --> 01:40:21.141]  They want, of course, something different, and that's why they are destroying a symbol of Christianity, to replace it instead with the symbol of a one-word religion that initially is called Chrislam, because the main two religions that are forming this alliance is, of course, the Vatican, together with the rich oil emirates that are giving the money for this project.
[01:40:22.427 --> 01:40:26.832]  I think that that is the final take that I can modestly speak to.
[01:40:26.832 --> 01:40:32.058]  So what you're saying, evidence points towards insiders burning it down to turn it into a New Age temple?
[01:40:33.578 --> 01:40:37.361]  Telling it in a temple of this new religion.
[01:40:37.361 --> 01:40:50.914]  You have to understand that Chrislam is a religion that is unifying more and more Catholicism with Islam, Christianity with Islam, because now all forms of Christianity are operating under the Pope.
[01:40:50.914 --> 01:40:54.737]  So this is really the eve of the one-word religion.
[01:40:54.737 --> 01:40:57.760]  And of course there is a lot of ominous signs.
[01:40:59.082 --> 01:41:07.097]  I remember a few years back you interviewed the guy who made that strange video.
[01:41:07.097 --> 01:41:10.222]  I think it was called I Pet Goat, something like that.
[01:41:11.016 --> 01:41:19.180]  And that also has inside it an ominous wording regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral that falls down.
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:22.702]  I don't know if you remember that weird video.
[01:41:22.702 --> 01:41:26.684]  Oh yeah, I had him on like 10 years ago and he made a film about the Illuminati.
[01:41:26.684 --> 01:41:30.926]  They were showing it to me yesterday and it shows the spire falling on Notre Dame but not the rest.
[01:41:32.059 --> 01:41:42.613]  Yeah, but the thing is that when it goes down, at that moment, Jesus loses what he has around his head, these stones, you know?
[01:41:42.613 --> 01:41:46.999]  And then that is what was the most precious relic that you have inside.
[01:41:48.301 --> 01:42:07.294]  What you're saying is all angles point towards a ceremony, a ritual of some type, and that we're being covered up, we're not being told the truth, because we are profane.
[01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:13.305]  Well, of course, it's the period of bonfires, as I said at the beginning of the show.
[01:42:13.305 --> 01:42:24.016]  We are going towards Beltane, this celebration, and so I think that by burning this church, by destroying it,
[01:42:24.817 --> 01:42:26.859]  We are going towards the end times.
[01:42:26.859 --> 01:42:29.922]  They are forcing their way towards the end times.
[01:42:29.922 --> 01:42:37.208]  They want to see if their Antichrist is more powerful than the returning Messiah.
[01:42:37.208 --> 01:42:41.512]  And this is a very big question mark here because of course we know how it's going to end up.
[01:42:42.012 --> 01:42:55.223]  But the materialistic world that is controlling all this, the people that are putting millions of dollars, millions to reconstruct this cathedral, they think that they can get away with it.
[01:42:55.223 --> 01:42:56.885]  They think... Stay there until I capture the flag.
[01:42:58.075 --> 01:43:02.378]  Getting your protein has never been easier with InfoWars Life Protein Bars.

[01:44:02.513 --> 01:44:11.078]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:14.059]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:44:14.059 --> 01:44:15.800]  How can I solve that problem?

[01:44:58.395 --> 01:45:03.818]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[01:45:03.818 --> 01:45:05.619]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[01:45:05.619 --> 01:45:07.380]  Now I can be there for my children.
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:09.201]  Now I can make them strong.
[01:45:09.201 --> 01:45:10.861]  Now I can instruct them.

[01:45:13.683 --> 01:45:14.724]  You think it was digital age?
[01:45:14.724 --> 01:45:18.806]  Your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:45:18.806 --> 01:45:24.390]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:28.033]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:45:28.033 --> 01:45:33.016]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[01:45:33.016 --> 01:45:39.921]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[01:45:39.921 --> 01:45:43.563]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.

[01:47:24.458 --> 01:47:29.602]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:44.930]  David Nino Rodriguez, former heavy champion of the world, who beat Mike Tyson, will be joining us.
[01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:49.153]  He's a patriot, getting a lot of heat for supporting Trump and defending our borders.
[01:47:49.153 --> 01:47:52.615]  He'll be on the last 45 minutes of the next hour, about 15 minutes behind, as you've noticed.
[01:47:52.615 --> 01:47:56.198]  We're finishing up with Leo Zegami right now, always on fire.
[01:47:56.198 --> 01:47:59.080]  Joe Rogan is under attack by Media Matters.
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:03.882]  I'm not going to tell you what he probably told me, but it's funny.
[01:48:03.882 --> 01:48:23.558]  But we're going to play some of that and get into that, and then also get into some of the flashbacks with Bernie Sanders ahead of David Nino Rodriguez, heavyweight champion of the world, joining us coming up to get into free speech and his view of Trump and so much more.
[01:48:23.558 --> 01:48:29.723]  And then throughout the week, I'm going to open the phones up the last two days, because we've been taking more calls lately, but I've been bad the last few days with so many guests.
[01:48:32.418 --> 01:48:38.741]  We only do this once a year, because when you do 50% off on apparel, in most cases you lose money.
[01:48:38.741 --> 01:48:44.563]  I mean, clothing is expensive, and made in America with all the regulations and stuff, and then the printing here.
[01:48:44.563 --> 01:48:55.067]  We have a bunch of shirts for between $15 and $17 to print, to buy and print in America with a nice rayon, real soft, real comfortable.
[01:48:55.067 --> 01:48:56.748]  So you do 50% off on those, you lose money.
[01:48:58.186 --> 01:48:59.207]  Well, guess what?
[01:48:59.207 --> 01:49:00.348]  Everything is 50% off.
[01:49:00.348 --> 01:49:05.332]  So some shirts we buy that are still comfortable but are cheap, $5 a piece.
[01:49:05.332 --> 01:49:07.754]  Print on them cost another dollar or so.
[01:49:07.754 --> 01:49:09.515]  Normally sell them for like, you know, 15 bucks.
[01:49:09.515 --> 01:49:11.016]  Right now they're discounted.
[01:49:11.016 --> 01:49:13.218]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:49:13.218 --> 01:49:14.119]  You can go right there.
[01:49:14.119 --> 01:49:20.204]  All ball caps, all t-shirts, all apparel are 50% off.
[01:49:20.204 --> 01:49:23.226]  And you know, I thought that people wouldn't want to get heat.
[01:49:23.226 --> 01:49:25.888]  So I thought, well, Infowars.com shirts.
[01:49:25.888 --> 01:49:27.189]  We'll make a bunch of other shirts.
[01:49:28.069 --> 01:49:38.017]  That are like Trump cutting Medusa's head off and it's Hillary or you know a bunch of other like news war shirts or don't California my USA shirt and those are popular.
[01:49:38.017 --> 01:49:42.720]  But people want the in your face Infowars bright red shirt.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:47.504]  They want to go out and look in red areas you're going to get loved and patted on and maybe meet your next husband or wife.
[01:49:48.064 --> 01:49:49.705]  Or your next, you know, golfing buddy.
[01:49:49.705 --> 01:49:50.826]  Or hunting buddy.
[01:49:50.826 --> 01:49:54.628]  But let me tell you, you wear these in a leftist area, it's like wearing a red mega hat.
[01:49:54.628 --> 01:49:56.609]  There's attacks every day we know about.
[01:49:56.609 --> 01:49:57.710]  Probably dozens we don't.
[01:49:57.710 --> 01:49:59.031]  It's dangerous.
[01:49:59.031 --> 01:50:02.773]  That's why I say, wear a gold foil women's Molon Labe shirt.
[01:50:02.773 --> 01:50:06.536]  We've got a bunch of women's designs coming out, but that's one of the few we have just for women.
[01:50:06.536 --> 01:50:08.417]  The shirts are all unisex, we have some that are just for women.
[01:50:09.773 --> 01:50:20.482]  And they're great, but just go there and get some shirts, and sign up for auto-ship on things like the Wake Up America Coffee, the 4-Hour Free Toothpaste, Super Blue.
[01:50:20.482 --> 01:50:27.588]  The things you're going to want to reorder, things like the high-quality protein bars, because that's what we need every month, is that support to continue on the face of the globe.
[01:50:27.588 --> 01:50:31.191]  Unless you've done a great job supporting us, I want to thank you all, but those of you on the fence,
[01:50:32.062 --> 01:50:34.225]  At least spread the word, pray for the broadcast, that's great.
[01:50:34.225 --> 01:50:36.207]  I'm thanking you, I'm not complaining.
[01:50:36.207 --> 01:50:40.952]  But get to the site, InfoWarsTore.com, and get a book, get a video, get a t-shirt.
[01:50:40.952 --> 01:50:49.743]  Got a bunch of other big specials running right now on storable foods, on air filtration systems, on DNA force, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:50:51.058 --> 01:50:54.061]  And Infowarslife.com takes you right to the sub-page with the supplements.
[01:50:54.061 --> 01:50:55.622]  You can also call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:50:55.622 --> 01:50:59.265]  We'll answer any of your questions there.
[01:50:59.265 --> 01:51:04.670]  There's also a mailing address on the site, or you can always call and get the mailing address if you missed it.
[01:51:04.670 --> 01:51:07.512]  But because I didn't give it out, it's 877-789-2539, ladies and gentlemen, or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:23.525]  Going back to Leo Zegami.
[01:51:23.525 --> 01:51:26.051]  Leo, why are they saying out of the gates?
[01:51:26.051 --> 01:51:26.692]  I keep asking this.
[01:51:26.692 --> 01:51:27.874]  You're a smart cookie.
[01:51:27.874 --> 01:51:28.716]  You never want to speculate.
[01:51:28.716 --> 01:51:31.502]  You're getting into the background, the history, you know.
[01:51:31.502 --> 01:51:31.763]  Why?
[01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:44.838]  On God's green earth, when the fires are only 30 minutes old, 400 feet in the air, are they saying, no terrorism, no Islam, no arson, you see nothing!
[01:51:44.838 --> 01:51:50.701]  That makes everyone then think it's that, and even liberals I know think somebody torched it.
[01:51:50.701 --> 01:51:52.082]  What is your gut level on this?
[01:51:52.082 --> 01:52:00.888]  You're saying it looks like a ritual, they admit they want to build some Illuminati temple like the Louvre on it, but I mean, why would they be so obvious about saying it's not
[01:52:01.409 --> 01:52:02.273]  An inside job.
[01:52:02.273 --> 01:52:03.981]  It happened all by itself with no evidence.
[01:52:05.899 --> 01:52:27.896]  Well, they have already had so many attacks in France in the last couple of months, from February, smearing excrements in churches, destroying tabernacles, and not in one church, but many churches, including the famous Dan Brown Da Vinci Code one that, you know, everybody knows, the St.
[01:52:27.896 --> 01:52:30.438]  Sulpice one, always in Paris.
[01:52:30.438 --> 01:52:35.562]  But there's been many attacks against churches, and they're not exposing, of course,
[01:52:36.042 --> 01:52:39.892]  The perpetrators, because here the situation is very clear.
[01:52:39.892 --> 01:52:42.539]  Either it's the Muslims or either it's the Satanists.
[01:52:43.197 --> 01:52:46.559]  Because there is a lot of Satanists that will do this kind of thing.
[01:52:46.559 --> 01:52:58.944]  So, both of them are responsible and nobody seems to be tackling the problem because still we don't have one person that's been arrested for all these attacks that started in early February with all these churches.
[01:52:58.944 --> 01:53:07.128]  So, and plus we have an ominous prophecy made by a guy called Michel de Notre Dame, Nostradamus.
[01:53:07.728 --> 01:53:22.533]  Who also pointed out on this moment in which, of course, the cathedral will be burnt in one of his quatrains, he seems to be pointing at a moment in which, after following a long century, evil will return.
[01:53:22.533 --> 01:53:23.433]  What does he mean this?
[01:53:23.433 --> 01:53:32.116]  He means that after the First World War, the Second World War, we are going inevitably, here in Europe, towards a Third World War.
[01:53:32.116 --> 01:53:36.498]  And he says in this quatrain, France and Italy, what emotions will you undergo?
[01:53:37.498 --> 01:53:42.080]  We know that at the moment these countries have some great problems.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:52.265]  Now in Libya we are losing control of the situation and we have been warned that there is hundreds of terrorists waiting to come through Italy into Europe.
[01:53:52.265 --> 01:53:55.407]  And so, I mean, the situation is very clear here.
[01:53:55.407 --> 01:53:59.268]  Either we stop these Muslims or either we stop these Muslims.
[01:53:59.268 --> 01:54:02.110]  But the Night Stampers, that was their job.
[01:54:02.110 --> 01:54:04.351]  So the fact that these new Night Stampers
[01:54:04.711 --> 01:54:05.012]  I think?
[01:54:23.692 --> 01:54:23.832]  Yes.
[01:54:40.030 --> 01:54:43.554]  And there is something that is about to happen, something very big.
[01:54:43.554 --> 01:54:46.257]  You were mentioning Columbine earlier on.
[01:54:46.257 --> 01:54:51.922]  It is one of the episodes that I mentioned during a long list of episodes that I cited in April.
[01:54:51.922 --> 01:54:55.846]  We had on April 15, 2013, the Boston Marathon bombing.
[01:54:55.846 --> 01:54:58.569]  We had the Virginia Tech shooting on April 16, 2007.
[01:54:58.569 --> 01:55:00.071]  That's right.
[01:55:00.071 --> 01:55:03.034]  You specifically a few months ago said, look for Columbine.
[01:55:04.581 --> 01:55:06.103]  I said it a few days ago.
[01:55:06.103 --> 01:55:07.805]  I said Columbine is on the list.
[01:55:07.805 --> 01:55:16.573]  I mean, of course, these are events that have put together some kind of evil egregore.
[01:55:16.573 --> 01:55:18.956]  That's what we call it in occult terms.
[01:55:18.956 --> 01:55:24.121]  Egregore is a thought form that puts together thoughts and then manifests
[01:55:24.381 --> 01:55:33.007]  Through people, and it's a very powerful force that the occultists of the New World Order... Let's be clear, they hype up mass shootings to get weak-minded people to do it.
[01:55:33.007 --> 01:55:34.648]  They call it lesser magic.
[01:55:34.648 --> 01:55:37.830]  They put the idea out trying to get others to do it.
[01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:39.652]  And then they need the right places to do it.
[01:55:39.652 --> 01:55:47.177]  So the fact that they can destroy this cathedral, this symbol of Christianity, and replace it with another temple
[01:55:47.882 --> 01:55:50.184]  Well, they are going back to their roots.
[01:55:50.184 --> 01:55:52.806]  Because that temple was the temple of Jupiter.
[01:55:52.806 --> 01:55:54.267]  Jupiter is Zeus.
[01:55:54.267 --> 01:55:57.289]  Jupiter is the head of all the pagan gods.
[01:55:57.289 --> 01:56:00.311]  So there is something cooking that is very big here.
[01:56:00.311 --> 01:56:02.493]  And, of course, it's not a coincidence.
[01:56:02.493 --> 01:56:06.016]  And let's be clear, Paul Joseph Watson's article, elitist...
[01:56:06.838 --> 01:56:10.562]  Architects want Notre Dame rebuilt to reflect new global France.
[01:56:10.562 --> 01:56:12.884]  It's burning feels like an act of liberation.
[01:56:12.884 --> 01:56:19.350]  So you've got these modern architects who want to build something ugly and squat on it, want to destroy history, licking their filthy lips.
[01:56:21.812 --> 01:56:41.537]  They are of course going for the whole plan, you know, they want to establish this new order and they have to destroy first this last, you know, symbols of Christianity that here in Europe are... You have to understand that France now is completely in the hands of the Muslims.
[01:56:41.537 --> 01:56:47.259]  The Emirates are pouring in billions, not millions, billions to construct everyday new mosques
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:50.427]  And they openly brag all over the news.
[01:56:50.427 --> 01:56:53.335]  We have it just like piss on you, piss on France, piss on you.
[01:56:53.335 --> 01:56:53.937]  They're just laughing.
[01:56:55.219 --> 01:57:11.689]  Yeah, and the Italians, even the Italians this week started to understand that when they saw that in the north of Italy a church, the Catholic Church, is being transformed in a mosque, well that has opened the eyes even of the Italians on what is happening.
[01:57:11.689 --> 01:57:16.992]  But of course the Islamic community in France is much larger than any other place in Europe.
[01:57:16.992 --> 01:57:21.055]  So the invasion in France is completed.
[01:57:21.055 --> 01:57:23.216]  They can now pass to the attack.
[01:57:25.136 --> 01:57:32.098]  800 churches blown up or burned last year in a total celebration with our own media helping cover it up, led by Shep Smith.
[01:57:32.098 --> 01:57:33.139]  We have five more minutes with us.
[01:57:33.139 --> 01:57:34.179]  You're in Italy.
[01:57:34.179 --> 01:57:38.600]  Chiefs are waking up big-time to the Islamic invasion run by the UN, so is Austria and others.
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:42.721]  Can you link up with Eastern Europe to save Europe before it falls?
[01:57:42.721 --> 01:57:45.502]  Or is the cancer of France going to destroy all of Europe?

[01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:53.912]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:57.832 --> 02:00:02.856]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:02.856 --> 02:00:08.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:19.329]  So, bottom line, Leo Zegami, and you've not really ever steered me wrong, you're saying all evidence points towards a globalist Illuminati ritual to burn down Notre Dame and then build an occultic site.
[02:00:19.329 --> 02:00:20.630]  And that's on Infowars.com.
[02:00:20.630 --> 02:00:22.931]  Elitist architects want Notre Dame.
[02:00:23.732 --> 02:00:26.955]  Rebuilt to reflect new globalist France.
[02:00:26.955 --> 02:00:33.320]  Whatever really happened, it's being covered up because you never, before the fires are even out, say no arson, no terror, no Islam.
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:35.342]  Shifting gears though to Europe in general.
[02:00:35.342 --> 02:00:36.983]  Can it be saved?
[02:00:36.983 --> 02:00:39.706]  Or is the fall of Notre Dame emblematic of the fall of Christendom?
[02:00:40.987 --> 02:00:50.710]  It's emblematic that this week crosses on graves in an Italian cemetery in Bologna have been covered by black cloth in order not to offend Muslims.
[02:00:50.710 --> 02:01:01.014]  I mean, they have installed motorized blackout curtains that goes like and covered all the crosses of the cemetery when they're celebrating other religions.
[02:01:01.014 --> 02:01:04.015]  I mean, this is totally insane.
[02:01:04.015 --> 02:01:08.356]  I mean, to cover the crosses in a cemetery, I think we are going one step
[02:01:08.496 --> 02:01:10.159]  Well, what's the headline on that?
[02:01:10.159 --> 02:01:15.951]  I want to see that because I know that Greece is pulling down crosses that will offend Muslims when they invade in Lesbos.
[02:01:15.951 --> 02:01:20.280]  But you're saying in Bologna they pulled, they covered up crosses for a Muslim celebration?
[02:01:20.902 --> 02:01:26.765]  Yes, crosses covered in cloth in Italian cemeteries to avoid offending Islam.
[02:01:26.765 --> 02:01:28.987]  And they're doing it methodically.
[02:01:28.987 --> 02:01:32.169]  They're doing it with awareness of what they're doing.
[02:01:32.169 --> 02:01:38.092]  I mean, they're doing it, of course, in a town in north of Italy, which is presently made up of left-wing communists.
[02:01:38.092 --> 02:01:44.255]  They're all communists, all socialist and communists, because Bologna, as we know, is the capital of communists in Italy.
[02:01:44.255 --> 02:01:46.737]  So in this area where people are
[02:01:47.297 --> 02:01:49.358]  I think here we have really gone one step too far.
[02:01:49.358 --> 02:01:55.159]  I mean, to avoid offending other religions by destroying your own, destroying the symbol which is the only symbol that survived the fire, the great cross
[02:02:17.046 --> 02:02:23.055]  That was embraced by the Fire Brigade when they entered this church.
[02:02:23.055 --> 02:02:29.524]  And not a word for the person that nearly lost his life, one of the members of the Fire Brigade.
[02:02:29.524 --> 02:02:32.769]  The Pope didn't say one word for this courageous hero.
[02:02:33.630 --> 02:02:41.255]  I think that we are really seeing that this papacy is not in line with Christianity.
[02:02:41.255 --> 02:02:46.179]  And at the same time, the left is beyond fanaticism.
[02:02:46.179 --> 02:02:49.461]  They are really into ideological delirium.
[02:02:49.461 --> 02:02:51.803]  That's what is happening here.
[02:02:51.803 --> 02:02:57.527]  And the Populist Interior Minister Matteo Salvini from the League, of course, is going to have
[02:02:58.207 --> 02:02:58.908]  I think so.
[02:03:14.168 --> 02:03:18.033]  People who are real politicians, not just puppets, are going to arrive there in Brussels.
[02:03:18.033 --> 02:03:22.138]  They're going to see that this is basically a dictatorship, a technocracy.
[02:03:22.138 --> 02:03:32.590]  At that point, I think that the one at the end of May is going to be the last European election before the great war that is going to explode inevitably between Islam and
[02:03:34.252 --> 02:03:36.514]  That's right, and the globalists, whether it's the U.S.
[02:03:36.514 --> 02:03:44.920]  or Europe, are trying to flood us with their third-world populations they can politically control and detonate to bring us to our knees in civil war, but I think it's too late.
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:51.925]  I think we're going to actually win long-term, because if we're ideologically awake, they're not going to be able to stop us, Leo.
[02:03:51.925 --> 02:04:00.252]  We have to require, like Matteo Salvini did here in Italy, to have the crucifixes hung again in all public buildings.
[02:04:01.218 --> 02:04:02.841]  Here in the West.
[02:04:02.841 --> 02:04:03.643]  It's all a ritual.
[02:04:03.643 --> 02:04:05.066]  We have to bring it out.
[02:04:05.066 --> 02:04:08.452]  Even if you don't believe in God, these devil worshippers, they do.
[02:04:08.452 --> 02:04:09.535]  We have to invoke it, don't we?
[02:04:11.127 --> 02:04:21.374]  Yeah, well of course they want to destroy the signs of Christianity because they want to evoke the takeover of the Antichrist.
[02:04:21.374 --> 02:04:31.601]  And of course, at the moment, Macron is one of the people that they think is going to be one of the candidates for being an Antichrist.
[02:04:31.601 --> 02:04:38.145]  But of course, he's already out of the picture because I think that Macron, the only way he can stay in power in France,
[02:04:38.505 --> 02:04:38.945]  That's right.
[02:04:38.945 --> 02:04:39.706]  Great job Leo Zegami.
[02:04:39.706 --> 02:04:40.146]  LeoZegami.com.
[02:04:40.146 --> 02:04:40.947]  Thank you so much sir.
[02:04:40.947 --> 02:04:42.708]  Get his books at LeoZegami.com.
[02:04:42.708 --> 02:04:43.629]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.301 --> 02:04:59.562]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[02:04:59.562 --> 02:05:02.563]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[02:05:02.563 --> 02:05:09.425]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[02:05:09.425 --> 02:05:10.565]  X2 is back.
[02:05:10.565 --> 02:05:11.345]  We got it.
[02:05:11.345 --> 02:05:13.026]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[02:05:13.026 --> 02:05:14.626]  We rushed it into production.
[02:05:14.626 --> 02:05:15.406]  It's been bottled.
[02:05:15.406 --> 02:05:21.148]  The labels are being put on today, and then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the
[02:05:21.368 --> 02:05:24.492]  Plant in the Rockies and it's going to be shipped out to you.
[02:05:24.492 --> 02:05:27.815]  Be sure to sign up for AutoShip and an additional 10% off.
[02:05:27.815 --> 02:05:32.440]  The 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:34.343]  Research the iodine conspiracy.
[02:05:34.343 --> 02:05:36.145]  Find out why it's so important.
[02:05:36.145 --> 02:05:37.967]  Find out what the globalists don't want you to have.
[02:05:38.647 --> 02:05:42.771]  The good halogens and the bad halogens at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:42.771 --> 02:05:44.012]  That's the umbrella site.
[02:05:44.012 --> 02:05:46.794]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the supplements.
[02:05:46.794 --> 02:05:49.977]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:49.977 --> 02:05:51.899]  It is X2 Original.
[02:05:51.899 --> 02:05:54.220]  Now back at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:56.195 --> 02:06:10.961]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[02:06:10.961 --> 02:06:20.005]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[02:06:20.005 --> 02:06:22.326]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:06:26.954 --> 02:06:39.980]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:42.322]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[02:06:42.322 --> 02:06:44.783]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[02:06:46.894 --> 02:06:52.916]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[02:06:52.916 --> 02:07:00.199]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:07:00.199 --> 02:07:05.181]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[02:07:05.181 --> 02:07:08.122]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[02:07:08.122 --> 02:07:12.424]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[02:07:12.424 --> 02:07:15.365]  We have to work the dark side, or we're going to spend time in the shadows.
[02:07:16.699 --> 02:07:20.763]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[02:07:20.763 --> 02:07:22.024]  Well, join me.
[02:07:22.024 --> 02:07:24.407]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[02:07:24.407 --> 02:07:27.770]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:07:27.770 --> 02:07:33.916]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:08:34.119 --> 02:08:35.540]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:36.120]  Welcome back.
[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:41.343]  Our next guest, David Nino Rodriguez, who's broken Mike Tyson's record number of knockouts.
[02:08:41.343 --> 02:08:46.166]  But the big thing I'm proud of him for is being a patriot, supporting Trump, supporting the sovereignty of this country.
[02:08:46.166 --> 02:08:48.907]  And I want to talk about the censorship attacks he's gone through.
[02:08:48.907 --> 02:08:51.489]  We appreciate him joining us, coming up here in about 10 minutes.
[02:08:51.489 --> 02:08:52.850]  Let me hit this right now.
[02:08:52.850 --> 02:09:00.334]  Speaking of fighting, Joe Rogan started his podcasting career out of what he does for the UFC with Fight Companions.
[02:09:02.116 --> 02:09:07.280]  And so he basically has a show that is a man cave.
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:09.522]  The show is mainly guys.
[02:09:09.522 --> 02:09:22.512]  And so we've got Media Matters, run by George Soros, the literal Nazi collaborator, tattletailing to the world that, oh look, the Joe Rogan Experience disproportionately hosts men.
[02:09:24.238 --> 02:09:32.581]  Over 91% of the guest appearances on Apple's most popular podcast are made by men.
[02:09:32.581 --> 02:09:34.241]  And just last week I saw Brian Skelter.
[02:09:34.241 --> 02:09:39.243]  Brian Skelter saying, we can't criticize female candidates for president.
[02:09:39.243 --> 02:09:42.184]  That triggers the patriarchal bias.
[02:09:42.184 --> 02:09:47.726]  So you step into a man's world, and if I agree with a woman and think she's better than a man, I'll vote for her.
[02:09:47.726 --> 02:09:50.307]  But now you can't be criticized.
[02:09:50.307 --> 02:09:50.747]  It's crazy.
[02:09:52.045 --> 02:09:57.309]  So again, this is a show based on fight companions that grew into a political show and a news show.
[02:09:57.309 --> 02:09:58.750]  And now they're really, really jealous of it.
[02:09:58.750 --> 02:10:00.852]  As you can argue, it's the biggest podcast in the world.
[02:10:00.852 --> 02:10:03.394]  Definitely the biggest serious podcast in the world.
[02:10:03.394 --> 02:10:06.516]  I mean, PewDiePie's bigger, but that's more entertainment.
[02:10:06.516 --> 02:10:16.764]  And so now the sharks are circling Joe Rogan, talking about his sponsors and what he does and all the rest of it, because they want control of information.
[02:10:16.764 --> 02:10:18.525]  Tucker Carlson last night talked about it.
[02:10:18.525 --> 02:10:19.066]  Here's a short clip.
[02:10:21.121 --> 02:10:26.826]  Joe Rogan is a comedian and television figure and host of a podcast called The Joe Rogan Experience.
[02:10:26.826 --> 02:10:29.068]  You may not know it, but it's a big deal.
[02:10:29.068 --> 02:10:32.231]  It's one of the most downloaded podcasts in the world.
[02:10:32.231 --> 02:10:34.933]  Suddenly, he has some very angry critics on the left.
[02:10:34.933 --> 02:10:42.579]  Media Matters, which is a character assassination organization benefiting the Democratic Party but posing as a non-profit, just went after Rogan.
[02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:44.061]  Their complaint?
[02:10:44.061 --> 02:10:46.824]  He has too many men on his program.
[02:10:46.824 --> 02:10:48.505]  Doesn't matter that it's his program.
[02:10:48.505 --> 02:10:50.107]  He can invite on whomever he wants.
[02:10:50.107 --> 02:10:53.510]  Doesn't matter that his fans are obviously happy with his program.
[02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:57.854]  More people listen to Joe Rogan than watch anything on CNN or MSNBC.
[02:10:57.854 --> 02:10:59.976]  Media Matters is sending a warning.
[02:10:59.976 --> 02:11:03.700]  Joe Rogan had better listen to them or they'll crush him.
[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:06.383]  They'll find some excuse to start an ad boycott.
[02:11:06.383 --> 02:11:07.163]  Take his show away.
[02:11:07.964 --> 02:11:13.026]  If you ask Media Matters, they'd say they're upset because Rogan doesn't care about diversity.
[02:11:13.026 --> 02:11:14.986]  But of course, the truth is exactly the opposite.
[02:11:14.986 --> 02:11:18.867]  Rogan is popular precisely because he welcomes a diversity of opinion.
[02:11:18.867 --> 02:11:20.728]  Left, right, everyone in between.
[02:11:20.728 --> 02:11:24.129]  Milo Yiannopoulos, Elon Musk, Alex Jones.
[02:11:24.129 --> 02:11:24.909]  He's interviewed them all.
[02:11:24.909 --> 02:11:28.971]  If you've got something interesting to say, Rogan and his fans want to hear it.
[02:11:28.971 --> 02:11:33.332]  But for the speech police on the left, that's terrifying because they don't control it.
[02:11:34.855 --> 02:11:36.376]  So it shouldn't exist at all.
[02:11:36.376 --> 02:11:39.319]  Why tolerate freedom when you can have power instead?
[02:11:39.319 --> 02:11:40.419]  So stay strong, Joe Rogan.
[02:11:40.419 --> 02:11:41.500]  I'm sure you will.
[02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:42.961]  And that's what this is.
[02:11:42.961 --> 02:11:49.306]  You have Soros' funded Media Matters and the Southern Poverty Law Center that are both under criminal investigation now.
[02:11:49.306 --> 02:11:51.868]  We told you that a year ago, now it's in the news.
[02:11:51.868 --> 02:12:01.676]  These racketeering organizations that set themselves up sanctimoniously, arrogantly, that they decide what you can and can't see or do.
[02:12:03.052 --> 02:12:04.953]  And they've gone after me and helped get me de-platformed.
[02:12:04.953 --> 02:12:06.434]  They're trying to get Tucker Carlson de-platformed.
[02:12:06.434 --> 02:12:13.898]  And now it's Joe Rogan, who is more liberal than I'd say conservative on many issues, because he doesn't have more women on his show.
[02:12:13.898 --> 02:12:18.740]  You know, you could have the lesbian, uh, in tech conference in San Francisco.
[02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:20.581]  Good, more power to you.
[02:12:20.581 --> 02:12:22.342]  All women.
[02:12:22.342 --> 02:12:23.063]  That's okay.
[02:12:23.063 --> 02:12:31.027]  You can have all these women's shows and all these women's groups and all these programs and have Hollywood put out a directive that all the heroes be heroines.
[02:12:31.027 --> 02:12:31.267]  Women.
[02:12:32.196 --> 02:12:37.802]  But if somebody's got a man cave show, and then that's popular, they want to horn in and control it.
[02:12:37.802 --> 02:12:39.203]  We have a name for people like that.
[02:12:39.203 --> 02:12:40.705]  They're beyond control freaks.
[02:12:40.705 --> 02:12:44.128]  Because when they become governmental, they're called tyrants.
[02:12:44.128 --> 02:12:46.151]  They're called tyrannies.
[02:12:46.151 --> 02:12:49.874]  They're called clear and present dangers to society.
[02:12:50.911 --> 02:12:53.332]  Media Matters is a giant money laundering operation.
[02:12:53.332 --> 02:12:56.074]  It's been above the law, just like Hillary and all the rest of it.
[02:12:56.074 --> 02:12:57.275]  So is the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:12:57.275 --> 02:13:00.217]  But whistleblowers are exposing both groups now.
[02:13:00.217 --> 02:13:06.520]  As I told you months ago, get ready for big political fireworks and developments over at David Brock's shop.
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:13.324]  They're at Media Matters and over at, of course, the original mothership of race baiting and race war.
[02:13:13.324 --> 02:13:15.806]  The Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:13:17.335 --> 02:13:28.073]  Headed up by Morris Dees, where you've seen basically the entire leadership last month resign because the chickens are coming home to roost on these organizations.
[02:13:28.073 --> 02:13:29.015]  But just think about that.
[02:13:30.512 --> 02:13:35.576]  I know for a fact they started hen-pecking Joe Rogan, started telling him don't have people like me on the show.
[02:13:35.576 --> 02:13:36.556]  Joe didn't bow to that.
[02:13:36.556 --> 02:13:37.597]  He had me back on.
[02:13:37.597 --> 02:13:41.560]  It's his second biggest podcast ever after Elon Musk with over 30 million viewers.
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:43.361]  They're really pissed.
[02:13:43.361 --> 02:13:44.102]  They're upset.
[02:13:44.102 --> 02:13:47.705]  They don't want Alex Jones on a platform like that reaching new people.
[02:13:47.705 --> 02:13:54.650]  They want to be able to lie about me ad nauseam like Bernie Sanders did yesterday and said that Infowars is a white supremacist organization.
[02:13:54.650 --> 02:13:57.912]  You'd think they'd actually show a clip of me saying I like Hitler, but they didn't.
[02:13:59.414 --> 02:14:04.438]  No, the only people that were supported by Hitler again are people like George Soros.
[02:14:04.438 --> 02:14:07.161]  And again, that was a long time ago he worked for Hitler.
[02:14:07.161 --> 02:14:10.683]  The point is, is that if I worked for Hitler, you could say I worked for Hitler.
[02:14:10.683 --> 02:14:11.804]  I didn't work for Hitler.
[02:14:11.804 --> 02:14:16.689]  And then Caitlin Bennett, they're just jealous the video's now got like what, 30 million views?
[02:14:16.689 --> 02:14:18.410]  It was 20 million yesterday.
[02:14:18.410 --> 02:14:20.372]  What is it on Twitter alone, like 15 million views?
[02:14:20.372 --> 02:14:21.453]  Let's look that up.
[02:14:21.453 --> 02:14:22.533]  Last night it was 15 million views.
[02:14:23.434 --> 02:14:26.096]  Of them throwing her out of an event for just peacefully covering it.
[02:14:26.096 --> 02:14:26.856]  So what's the response?
[02:14:26.856 --> 02:14:28.597]  Oh, we're not bullies to a woman.
[02:14:28.597 --> 02:14:33.240]  No, we just threw out the white supremacist organization, InfoWars.com.
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:33.821]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:14:33.821 --> 02:14:35.482]  My eyes don't work anymore.
[02:14:35.482 --> 02:14:39.064]  How many million is that?
[02:14:39.064 --> 02:14:40.405]  20.9 million.
[02:14:40.405 --> 02:14:46.149]  So it was 15 last night and the others were, I bet it's 40 million views, the four platforms I saw it on.
[02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:48.550]  So how do they respond to that?
[02:14:48.550 --> 02:14:50.692]  I mean, the Super Bowl's got 80 million viewers.
[02:14:51.377 --> 02:14:52.798]  Well, they try to ban you.
[02:14:52.798 --> 02:14:55.239]  But see, people have a hunger for this, so just more pop up.
[02:14:55.239 --> 02:14:56.100]  Yeah.
[02:14:56.100 --> 02:15:00.543]  We had 87 million views conservatively the month of the election, two years ago.
[02:15:00.543 --> 02:15:02.324]  And they respond about deplatforming us.
[02:15:02.324 --> 02:15:02.664]  Well, guess what?
[02:15:02.664 --> 02:15:08.508]  We're still on 200-plus stations, over 100 cable and TV stations, and huge audiences at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:15:08.508 --> 02:15:10.489]  But the good news is, it doesn't matter.
[02:15:10.489 --> 02:15:14.312]  As you suppress people, more people stand up and more people speak out.
[02:15:14.312 --> 02:15:16.373]  And there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[02:15:16.373 --> 02:15:18.554]  That's very exciting.
[02:15:18.554 --> 02:15:19.275]  Well, David,
[02:15:20.711 --> 02:15:23.274]  Rodriguez is going to be joining us coming up.
[02:15:23.274 --> 02:15:25.377]  He's a former heavyweight champion in the world.
[02:15:25.377 --> 02:15:29.042]  Broke Mike Tyson's record, but he's friends with him for the most amount of knockouts.
[02:15:29.042 --> 02:15:33.267]  But while he's really joining us, ladies and gentlemen, is to talk about
[02:15:34.284 --> 02:15:39.050]  The border, Trump, sovereignty, free speech, the attacks, and more.
[02:15:39.050 --> 02:15:42.834]  So, DavidNinoRodriguez.com is his website.
[02:15:42.834 --> 02:15:45.237]  Nino Boxer on Twitter, at Nino Boxer.

[02:15:55.166 --> 02:16:00.127]  Number one international best-selling author, Matthew David Hurtado's pain was simple.
[02:16:00.127 --> 02:16:05.429]  Lyme disease bankrupt him in 2009, watching bankers take everything from his family.
[02:16:05.429 --> 02:16:14.271]  After building a seven-figure business from his couch, God called him to ministry to teach prosperity based on pain he could not tolerate in others' lives.
[02:16:14.711 --> 02:16:17.353]  IRS, creditors, car loans, debt.

[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:56.321]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.321 --> 02:17:00.224]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.224 --> 02:17:01.765]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.765 --> 02:17:04.727]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.727 --> 02:17:10.291]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.291 --> 02:17:11.492]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.492 --> 02:17:14.435]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:14.435 --> 02:17:16.656]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:17:24.582 --> 02:17:30.924]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:30.924 --> 02:17:33.964]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:33.964 --> 02:17:39.886]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:39.886 --> 02:17:43.687]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.687 --> 02:17:44.947]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:44.947 --> 02:17:46.287]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.287 --> 02:17:52.489]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:52.489 --> 02:17:53.909]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:56.363 --> 02:18:02.387]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew they canned food during the fall, so you have it during the winter.

[02:18:55.896 --> 02:18:58.138]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[02:18:58.138 --> 02:18:59.879]  There is no set stasis.
[02:18:59.879 --> 02:19:01.120]  There is no managed system.
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:02.781]  There is no un-continuum.
[02:19:02.781 --> 02:19:06.003]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[02:19:06.003 --> 02:19:09.345]  So, you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:19:09.345 --> 02:19:10.586]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[02:19:10.586 --> 02:19:11.307]  We'll be here forever.
[02:19:11.307 --> 02:19:12.648]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:19:12.648 --> 02:19:20.093]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[02:19:20.093 --> 02:19:21.854]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:19:21.854 --> 02:19:24.076]  I tell you, God's got a big war for you ready.
[02:19:24.076 --> 02:19:24.436]  And so,
[02:19:24.636 --> 02:19:31.243]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[02:19:31.243 --> 02:19:36.168]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[02:19:36.168 --> 02:19:39.031]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:19:39.031 --> 02:19:41.433]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[02:19:41.433 --> 02:19:44.937]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[02:19:44.937 --> 02:19:45.958]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:19:46.198 --> 02:19:49.321]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[02:19:49.321 --> 02:19:50.482]  Not these devil worshippers.
[02:19:50.482 --> 02:19:53.364]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[02:19:53.364 --> 02:19:54.445]  I want life!
[02:19:54.445 --> 02:19:59.168]  I want Jesus!
[02:19:59.168 --> 02:20:07.175]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:07.175 --> 02:20:10.618]  Peter, my Frankenstein!
[02:20:24.286 --> 02:20:27.747]  David Nino Rodriguez is our guest for the Balance of the Hour.
[02:20:27.747 --> 02:20:29.168]  Then Mike Adams takes over.
[02:20:29.168 --> 02:20:32.529]  DavidNinoRodriguez.com.
[02:20:32.529 --> 02:20:37.191]  I'm familiar with his boxing career, even though I'm not a big sports guy that has time to follow boxing.
[02:20:38.419 --> 02:20:46.082]  I do false for the heavyweight stuff and I've also seen on some national TV defending Trump as some UFC fighters have done and gotten a lot of criticism.
[02:20:46.082 --> 02:21:05.148]  But he is uniquely able to speak about this because he grew up in El Paso and saw the devastation on the border and he's seen firsthand the inhorrent violence of gangs, the sex, drug and organ trafficking and the alarming volume of criminal behavior committed by illegals on both sides of the U.S.
[02:21:06.007 --> 02:21:07.408]  Mexican border.
[02:21:07.408 --> 02:21:14.290]  A teenage Rodriguez, frequented Juarez, Mexico, one of the most violent cities in the world, trained as a fighter.
[02:21:14.290 --> 02:21:33.417]  While there he became privy to the criminal elements, obviously as a top boxer he would, the tactics and locations for crossing the border, the message for ambushing the victims, the types and styles of perpetrated crimes, and even the legal recourse that was avoided when the criminals would then retreat back to Mexico.
[02:21:33.417 --> 02:21:34.077]  Rodriguez was
[02:21:35.194 --> 02:21:39.057]  Also a witness to the effects, 2008 advances with the wall did the crime.
[02:21:39.057 --> 02:21:47.042]  But in 2017, Rodriguez busted the border when he, along with fellow Republicans Joe Biggs, in a video demonstrating just how easy it is to cross the border.
[02:21:47.042 --> 02:21:48.543]  We're going to play that next segment.
[02:21:48.543 --> 02:21:55.808]  Rodriguez also grew up on the same side of the town and said the same circle of friends felt betrayed by Robert.
[02:21:56.806 --> 02:22:05.351]  Peto O'Rourke, I'm sorry, Beto O'Rourke's actions in El Paso recently and pinned his open letter to him, which he shared on Facebook and went viral.
[02:22:05.351 --> 02:22:09.093]  So David Rodriguez is our guest.
[02:22:09.093 --> 02:22:11.134]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:22:11.134 --> 02:22:11.854]  Let's get into it.
[02:22:11.854 --> 02:22:16.797]  I mean, you live down there and Trump says, really dangerous on one side, a lot safer on the other.
[02:22:16.797 --> 02:22:18.738]  He says walls make people safer.
[02:22:18.738 --> 02:22:21.139]  And the left says, oh no, there's nothing happening.
[02:22:21.139 --> 02:22:22.360]  Mexico is a wonderful place.
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:22.880]  There's no crime.
[02:22:23.968 --> 02:22:27.610]  No, yeah, I've seen both sides of it.
[02:22:27.610 --> 02:22:32.353]  I grew up my whole life here in El Paso, Texas, in Juarez.
[02:22:32.353 --> 02:22:35.995]  They're the sister cities, so I was privy to both sides.
[02:22:35.995 --> 02:22:41.138]  And I basically would frequent Juarez just like any high school kid back in the day.
[02:22:41.138 --> 02:22:49.603]  But what made me different than O'Rourke and all them... See, most kids went there to the Strip to go party along the Strip, which is a lot like 6th Street in Austin.
[02:22:50.223 --> 02:22:53.085]  Let's just say it, bullfighters, bulls and fighters are like king in Mexico.
[02:23:16.129 --> 02:23:21.771]  Yeah, yeah, I was, I was, uh, you know, I got off the hook on a lot of things due to being a fighter.
[02:23:21.771 --> 02:23:27.512]  Uh, you know, I was, I was part of it, you know, I was part of the, of the shenanigans that they all used to do over there.
[02:23:27.512 --> 02:23:31.894]  We all used to, uh, you know, the big thing before the wall, I just want to clear this up.
[02:23:31.894 --> 02:23:42.937]  The big thing before the wall, the reason I know the wall worked is because before the wall, um, the Santa Fe train and the, uh, there's a street that runs parallel to the wall called Paisano.
[02:23:44.364 --> 02:23:47.287]  And Paisano, basically, is right next to Mexico.
[02:23:47.287 --> 02:23:49.529]  It's the street closest to Mexico.
[02:23:49.529 --> 02:23:55.355]  And cars are, you know, it was at one time the most dangerous freeway, you know, in the nation.
[02:23:55.355 --> 02:24:08.427]  And what happens is these kids that I used to grow up with, and I knew them, kids, I would say, you know, teenagers and even, you know, in their 20s, would run across the bridge, you know, well, run across the river, really, because there's no river.
[02:24:08.427 --> 02:24:09.388]  It's just mud and dirt.
[02:24:10.086 --> 02:24:15.032]  And they'd run right over there and put rocks in the street or two-by-fours with nails.
[02:24:15.032 --> 02:24:26.786]  And when a car would come, it would hit the two-by-four with nails and it would come to a complete stop or it would hit the boulders and stop and then they would run out and carjack the people, take everything they had and sometimes even murder the people.
[02:24:26.786 --> 02:24:27.547]  So that was just...
[02:24:28.067 --> 02:24:39.617]  The lower element of crime, or they would go and hijack or go steal from the containers of the Santa Fe train, which they took so much merchandise off that train, and then they'd go sell it in Mexico.
[02:24:39.617 --> 02:24:41.118]  So they would call that a hit.
[02:24:41.118 --> 02:24:44.902]  So they would go there and take a hit off the train, take a hit off someone driving their car.
[02:24:44.902 --> 02:24:46.883]  And this was easy to do.
[02:24:46.883 --> 02:24:50.567]  This is what they did every weekend, every day, really, if they wanted to.
[02:24:50.567 --> 02:24:52.488]  It was just an ongoing thing.
[02:24:52.488 --> 02:24:55.471]  And that was just the lower element of criminal activity.
[02:24:56.252 --> 02:25:02.635]  Uh, the higher criminal activity was when 2006 when George Bush started building the wall and finished it during the Obama administration.
[02:25:02.635 --> 02:25:06.316]  Boy, did we see, uh, the cartels take over that city.
[02:25:06.316 --> 02:25:11.338]  I mean, the extortion and, and the, uh, the killings of 50 to a hundred people a day.
[02:25:11.338 --> 02:25:12.098]  It was like a war zone.
[02:25:12.098 --> 02:25:13.659]  It was like Iraq over there.
[02:25:13.659 --> 02:25:21.162]  And El Paso became, you know, coincidentally the safest city while Juarez became the number one murder capital of the world.
[02:25:23.416 --> 02:25:24.716]  And what's the truth behind that?
[02:25:24.716 --> 02:25:31.078]  I mean, we know Juarez is one of the most dangerous cities in Mexico, but is the crime rate, you know, really low in El Paso?
[02:25:31.078 --> 02:25:32.078]  It is low in El Paso.
[02:25:32.078 --> 02:25:42.960]  I mean, you know, there are some, there is crime here, but listen, if over, you know, all the big families from the cartels and like the drug dealing families, they live here in El Paso.
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:44.520]  You know, they, they don't even live there.
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:44.820]  Well, yeah.
[02:25:44.820 --> 02:25:47.161]  I mean, they really live in San Antonio and Austin now.
[02:25:48.092 --> 02:25:50.475]  Yeah, you guys are getting your influx, too.
[02:25:50.475 --> 02:25:51.736]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:25:51.736 --> 02:25:53.278]  And I see both sides.
[02:25:53.278 --> 02:25:54.799]  I don't even go to Juarez anymore, you know.
[02:25:54.799 --> 02:26:02.568]  Well, no, if you go to a five-star hotel in San Diego or Austin or anywhere, it's like mainly rich, rich, rich Mexicans.
[02:26:02.568 --> 02:26:04.770]  And some of them aren't in the cartels, but it's just a fact.
[02:26:04.770 --> 02:26:06.772]  They'll tell you, no, we've all left Mexico.
[02:26:06.772 --> 02:26:07.533]  So what you said is true.
[02:26:08.462 --> 02:26:09.242]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:09.242 --> 02:26:10.622]  Nobody wants to live there, you know?
[02:26:10.622 --> 02:26:14.083]  And when the killings were happening, it turned into a ghost town.
[02:26:14.083 --> 02:26:18.984]  They started bringing all their businesses over here because everyone in Juarez was getting extorted.
[02:26:18.984 --> 02:26:25.065]  So when you're getting extorted, so they were having, like, gangs come into places of business or restaurants or bars.
[02:26:25.065 --> 02:26:31.686]  I lost nine friends from 2006 to 2013 that had restaurants and bars over there.
[02:26:31.686 --> 02:26:32.906]  So I know how dangerous it is.
[02:26:32.906 --> 02:26:35.467]  And that's not happening even in a safe zone like Cancun.
[02:26:35.467 --> 02:26:37.587]  They're robbing restaurants every night, shaking them down.
[02:26:38.484 --> 02:26:39.565]  I wouldn't even go there.
[02:26:39.565 --> 02:26:44.489]  I don't even feel like, you know, I wouldn't go to Mexico right now.
[02:26:44.489 --> 02:26:48.932]  I don't, you know, right now in the frontera, which is Juarez, that was the most dangerous place.
[02:26:48.932 --> 02:26:50.954]  That's like the coveted Holy Grail of Mexico.
[02:26:50.954 --> 02:26:52.635]  That's what every cartel wants to control.
[02:26:53.497 --> 02:26:58.541]  And basically, you know, with Trump building the wall, I know firsthand it works.
[02:26:58.541 --> 02:27:06.147]  Because imagine the bloodshed that would have spilled over into El Paso if that wall wasn't there during that period of time when all the killings were happening.
[02:27:06.147 --> 02:27:07.588]  It would have been horrific.
[02:27:07.588 --> 02:27:10.270]  And clearly, as you said, it's exponentially getting worse.
[02:27:10.270 --> 02:27:11.851]  We have giant caravans slamming in.
[02:27:11.851 --> 02:27:13.633]  Suddenly, Democrats will put the equipment back.
[02:27:14.233 --> 02:27:18.157]  Suddenly, Cory Booker and others say, oh no, it is a crisis.
[02:27:18.157 --> 02:27:19.678]  Don't dump them in our city.
[02:27:19.678 --> 02:27:25.523]  So Latin America, not just Mexico, is collapsing, and they're trying to tell Trump, don't stop it.
[02:27:25.523 --> 02:27:26.644]  Yeah, it's all lies.
[02:27:26.644 --> 02:27:34.771]  And to see Beto O'Rourke, who's from my hometown, sell out to this idea, which he knows damn well that that wall has helped.
[02:27:34.771 --> 02:27:36.592]  And let me clear up another thing, too.
[02:27:36.592 --> 02:27:39.475]  There are many Mexican people, when Trump came to the rally here in El Paso,
[02:27:40.143 --> 02:27:45.145]  There was 30 to 40, upside me, 45,000 people at his rally.
[02:27:45.145 --> 02:27:51.508]  When Beto O'Rourke, I know for a fact the media even live here in El Paso, Beto O'Rourke maybe had 3 to 4,000 people.
[02:27:51.508 --> 02:27:52.448]  Trump had about 30,000.
[02:27:52.448 --> 02:27:54.069]  We were there, maybe 2,000.
[02:27:54.069 --> 02:27:54.489]  We were there.
[02:27:54.489 --> 02:27:58.491]  And about half the folks who came out for Trump were Hispanic.
[02:27:58.491 --> 02:28:01.512]  So again, this idea that Trump's a racist, I mean, he's really popular.
[02:28:01.512 --> 02:28:04.754]  He's like twice as popular with Latinos, I've read, than other Republicans.
[02:28:05.487 --> 02:28:13.274]  It's just delusions that the media is spinning and people are buying into this and feeding off it and propelling this idea that he's racist.
[02:28:13.274 --> 02:28:17.637]  And I ask people all the time, help me understand why you think he's racist.
[02:28:17.637 --> 02:28:19.239]  None of them ever have an answer.
[02:28:19.239 --> 02:28:24.083]  None of them ever have an answer except for what CNN spins or what the mainstream media spins to them.
[02:28:24.083 --> 02:28:32.169]  But none of them have any own, their own formulated, you know, they've never done any of their own research to figure out who this guy really is, what his policies really mean.
[02:28:34.551 --> 02:28:36.532]  Let's talk about that.
[02:28:36.532 --> 02:28:41.234]  David Rodriguez, a former heavyweight champion in the world, broke Mike Tyson's record for most KOs.
[02:28:41.234 --> 02:28:47.937]  We're going to get your view on why they hate Trump so much and what their endgame is and what you've gone through standing up for the president.
[02:28:47.937 --> 02:28:50.198]  Straight ahead, everybody tell folks, this is an important interview.

[02:29:00.311 --> 02:29:05.395]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:29:05.395 --> 02:29:12.582]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.582 --> 02:29:17.126]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:29:17.711 --> 02:29:21.352]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:21.352 --> 02:29:24.473]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.473 --> 02:29:27.114]  It hit me when I was arrested.

[02:32:58.665 --> 02:33:01.307]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:15.955]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.042 --> 02:33:29.925]  David Nino Rodriguez, former heavyweight champion of the world, is our guest.
[02:33:29.925 --> 02:33:33.568]  Also beat Mike Tyson's record in most knockouts.
[02:33:33.568 --> 02:33:42.575]  But the big thing is, he grew up in El Paso, Texas, and has witnessed both sides of the border, decades of the carnage, and is very eloquent in what he breaks down.
[02:33:43.616 --> 02:33:59.662]  I wanted to play a clip of the governor of California, Newsom, also Mr. Potato Head, Cory Booker, saying, oh no, Trump, you don't take these people that have overwhelmed the courts, overwhelmed the jails, overwhelmed the detention facilities and dump them here.
[02:33:59.662 --> 02:34:04.084]  You dump them in conservative areas because this is too dangerous.
[02:34:04.084 --> 02:34:08.025]  So the fact that there's no logic and the hypocrisy is like turned up to 11.
[02:34:08.025 --> 02:34:08.646]  Here it is.
[02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:21.823]  It's illegal, it's immoral, it's unethical, it's sophomoric, it's petulant, and it's par for the course.
[02:34:32.287 --> 02:34:33.528]  Illegal aliens.
[02:34:33.528 --> 02:34:35.829]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[02:34:35.829 --> 02:34:39.091]  You've got Central America, South America collapsing into Mexico.
[02:34:39.091 --> 02:34:42.854]  More caravans breaking over the Mexican border, violently attacking people.
[02:34:42.854 --> 02:34:48.877]  Even the Washington Post and the Senate admits that they're shipping kidnapped kids in that are just disappearing.
[02:34:48.877 --> 02:34:59.244]  But we're told, David Rodriguez, somebody who's grown up in El Paso, Texas and witnessed both sides of this, that it's Trump's fault and that if he dares bring some of these people that he's ordered under law to release,
[02:35:00.330 --> 02:35:04.674]  That somehow this is immoral and dangerous what he's doing.
[02:35:04.674 --> 02:35:06.535]  No, let me let me just tell you this right now.
[02:35:06.535 --> 02:35:12.740]  I'm getting Intel from I have a lot of friends that are Border Patrol agents in this area.
[02:35:12.740 --> 02:35:15.062]  And you know, as you know, the checkpoints are all closed down.
[02:35:16.310 --> 02:35:20.596]  Because they're dealing with such an influx of immigrants coming here.
[02:35:20.596 --> 02:35:23.139]  And these aren't people that are just from Mexico.
[02:35:23.139 --> 02:35:32.111]  This is, you know, as you know as well, you say it all the time, South America, Africa, they're all here and they're getting 1,800 to 2,000 people a day.
[02:35:32.111 --> 02:35:33.213]  That's how serious this is.
[02:35:33.773 --> 02:35:38.936]  I mean, we're being bombarded right now here at the border, and they're having to let these people go into general population.
[02:35:38.936 --> 02:35:43.938]  They're letting anywhere from 200 to 500 people a day, from what I understand the numbers.
[02:35:43.938 --> 02:35:46.299]  They're just letting them go into general population.
[02:35:46.299 --> 02:35:51.002]  And these people, you know, these aren't just people with kids and, you know, families.
[02:35:51.002 --> 02:35:55.144]  These are grown men that we don't know what their objective is to come here.
[02:35:55.144 --> 02:35:55.624]  We don't know.
[02:35:55.624 --> 02:35:57.905]  I mean, a lot of these people grew up in crime in the community.
[02:35:57.905 --> 02:36:01.267]  You got to understand, like, what is these third world countries?
[02:36:01.267 --> 02:36:02.067]  These people grow up.
[02:36:02.842 --> 02:36:03.343]  We're good.
[02:36:22.578 --> 02:36:23.318]  Well, it's like you said.
[02:36:45.307 --> 02:36:49.769]  They claim that none of this is a problem, but all the Democrats certainly don't want to live in Mexico.
[02:36:49.769 --> 02:36:50.549]  They don't live in Guatemala.
[02:36:50.549 --> 02:36:52.710]  They don't want to live in any of those places.
[02:36:52.710 --> 02:37:01.715]  How do they say a month ago there are no crises, there are no migrants, there is no caravan, and now say, okay, it's here, it's a crisis, and Trump created it.
[02:37:01.715 --> 02:37:03.075]  Don't they know we have memories?
[02:37:03.075 --> 02:37:04.376]  What do you think the Democrats are thinking?
[02:37:07.072 --> 02:37:07.493]  I don't know.
[02:37:07.493 --> 02:37:15.620]  I have a lot of liberal friends here in El Paso and all over Texas that claim that they're now socialist and this and that.
[02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:17.702]  I can't understand their way of thinking, to be honest with you.
[02:37:17.702 --> 02:37:21.325]  To me, this is a completely logical argument.
[02:37:21.325 --> 02:37:24.628]  Our argument is completely logical compared to theirs, which is completely emotional.
[02:37:24.628 --> 02:37:26.850]  I don't think they have any experience on the border like I do.
[02:37:27.210 --> 02:37:30.798]  To understand really what's going on and how severe this problem really is.
[02:37:30.798 --> 02:37:36.632]  This is a national emergency and let's say the immigrants are pouring over here in droves and they're coming here.
[02:37:37.506 --> 02:37:38.306]  Who?
[02:37:38.306 --> 02:37:41.568]  They can't just be coming in caravans by the thousands.
[02:37:41.568 --> 02:37:43.669]  Someone has to be funding this.
[02:37:43.669 --> 02:37:48.672]  Because there's no way that these people are just making their way up by the thousands with no food, no water.
[02:37:48.672 --> 02:37:49.312]  And it's on record.
[02:37:49.312 --> 02:37:49.792]  It's the U.N.
[02:37:49.792 --> 02:37:51.593]  and George Soros.
[02:37:51.593 --> 02:37:52.294]  They get U.S.
[02:37:52.294 --> 02:37:53.394]  taxpayer money at the U.N.
[02:37:53.394 --> 02:37:57.636]  and then Soros gives them a credit card with $3,000 on it.
[02:37:57.636 --> 02:37:58.877]  Their name's not even on it.
[02:37:58.877 --> 02:37:59.797]  That's in Reuters.
[02:37:59.797 --> 02:38:00.938]  They just give them free money.
[02:38:01.815 --> 02:38:04.919]  Yeah, they need, people need to understand what's really going on.
[02:38:04.919 --> 02:38:06.601]  I'm right here in Ground Zero.
[02:38:06.601 --> 02:38:08.203]  You know, this is happening in my backyard.
[02:38:08.203 --> 02:38:10.766]  I mean, I can go just down the street and throw a rock and hit Mexico.
[02:38:10.766 --> 02:38:11.727]  I know what's going on.
[02:38:11.727 --> 02:38:12.528]  This is severe.
[02:38:12.528 --> 02:38:17.374]  And even, check this out, this is what's crazy, even the Mexicans in Mexico and Juarez, believe it or not,
[02:38:17.934 --> 02:38:18.755]  You'll be surprised.
[02:38:18.755 --> 02:38:20.076]  They don't even want them there either.
[02:38:20.076 --> 02:38:23.198]  All the immigrants that are pouring up, they don't even want them there in Juarez.
[02:38:23.198 --> 02:38:25.199]  By the way, what you said is very savvy.
[02:38:25.199 --> 02:38:26.020]  I want you to get into that.
[02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:28.221]  Mexico is on the high end of third world countries.
[02:38:28.221 --> 02:38:31.584]  It's a heavenly place compared to Venezuela and all these other places.
[02:38:31.584 --> 02:38:33.966]  And every Mexican I talk to, because I like Mexico when I'm down there.
[02:38:33.966 --> 02:38:35.387]  It's just getting too dangerous.
[02:38:35.387 --> 02:38:37.028]  They all agree with me.
[02:38:37.028 --> 02:38:38.549]  I've got to have papers to go down there?
[02:38:38.549 --> 02:38:41.071]  Yeah.
[02:38:41.071 --> 02:38:42.972]  It's absurd.
[02:38:42.972 --> 02:38:47.095]  I mean, like I said, I just think people want a reason to hate Trump.
[02:38:47.857 --> 02:38:53.481]  And they'll just do, and I think what liberals are doing now is just doing everything in spite of Trump, if that makes sense.
[02:38:53.481 --> 02:38:57.964]  They don't even, you know, they're just doing, you know, they heard what he said, his rhetoric or whatever.
[02:38:57.964 --> 02:38:59.385]  And he said, they're not sending us their best.
[02:38:59.385 --> 02:39:01.266]  They're sending us the worst of criminals, isn't that?
[02:39:01.266 --> 02:39:03.528]  Well, that's, you know, there are some good families coming here.
[02:39:03.528 --> 02:39:04.148]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[02:39:04.148 --> 02:39:12.434]  There are good families that want to come here and work and do that, but there's many, many families or people or grown men that are single and, and kids coming here that don't want to work.
[02:39:12.434 --> 02:39:15.175]  They want to come in and, and I know I knew them.
[02:39:15.175 --> 02:39:16.296]  I knew them back in the day.
[02:39:16.296 --> 02:39:17.137]  They want to carjack.
[02:39:17.137 --> 02:39:17.477]  They want to.
[02:39:17.857 --> 02:39:31.903]  Let's just say the skills they know is going under gang control and carrying out kidnapping, carjacking, murder, murder for hire, drug dealing, and that's why they're fleeing Latin America is because it's broken down the society.
[02:39:31.903 --> 02:39:35.265]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:39:35.265 --> 02:39:39.887]  What do you expect gut level if we allow the collapse of the border, which has already pretty much happened?
[02:39:39.887 --> 02:39:41.928]  Trump's just trying to stabilize it.
[02:39:41.928 --> 02:39:44.769]  What do you think is going to happen versus what the Democrats think is going to happen?
[02:39:46.514 --> 02:39:49.037]  It's I think it's I think it's going to be lawlessness.
[02:39:49.037 --> 02:39:53.863]  I think you know, if they allow these people to vote, I think it's the Democrats are going to win it over.
[02:39:53.863 --> 02:39:56.706]  I think it's a complete radical agenda.
[02:39:56.706 --> 02:39:58.388]  I agree with you on that.
[02:39:58.388 --> 02:40:04.875]  I think that the people that are coming here have really no job skills and another thing I think of to Alex.
[02:40:04.875 --> 02:40:07.078]  I'm sure you're on the same page with this as well as
[02:40:07.614 --> 02:40:15.419]  What happens in four to five years when the lower jobs or the jobs start getting taken over by AI?
[02:40:15.419 --> 02:40:17.221]  You know, I just went to McDonald's the other day.
[02:40:17.221 --> 02:40:23.205]  I don't eat there often, but I went there the other day and they have computer screens now where they don't even, you don't even have a... No, exactly.
[02:40:23.205 --> 02:40:27.348]  Humans are being replaced and then we import a giant unskilled population.
[02:40:27.348 --> 02:40:29.029]  Yeah, and so what are they going to be doing?
[02:40:30.015 --> 02:40:30.935]  Just robbing people?
[02:40:30.935 --> 02:40:33.196]  Crime is just, the influx of crime is going to go up.
[02:40:33.196 --> 02:40:39.578]  That's the smartest thing that's been said in about a year here, is all the studies show cheap labor is about to become workless.
[02:40:39.578 --> 02:40:43.959]  Why the hell would we be importing giant amounts of unskilled labor?
[02:40:43.959 --> 02:40:45.579]  It makes zero sense to me.
[02:40:45.579 --> 02:40:46.920]  It makes zero sense.
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:57.783]  And then another thing too, that the lady here that, I think her name is Veronica Escobar, that she ran for Congress anyway, she sat down
[02:40:58.524 --> 02:40:59.945]  Some of the facilities here.
[02:40:59.945 --> 02:41:02.067]  We can't even house the people here in El Paso now.
[02:41:02.067 --> 02:41:05.809]  So now that's making them release them into the public.
[02:41:05.809 --> 02:41:06.690]  Well that's another point.
[02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:07.290]  You live down there.
[02:41:07.290 --> 02:41:08.231]  People are blaming Trump.
[02:41:08.231 --> 02:41:09.772]  And I'll blame Trump when he's wrong.
[02:41:09.772 --> 02:41:10.653]  It's federal law.
[02:41:10.653 --> 02:41:11.974]  They're closing facilities.
[02:41:11.974 --> 02:41:13.195]  He can't get laws passed.
[02:41:13.195 --> 02:41:16.077]  He's under orders, under law, to release these people.
[02:41:17.365 --> 02:41:18.085]  It's insanity.
[02:41:18.085 --> 02:41:18.885]  What are we going to do?
[02:41:18.885 --> 02:41:24.267]  These people, as he's showing that picture right there, I'm telling you, most of them have no job skills.
[02:41:24.267 --> 02:41:28.268]  People think that they're going to go into construction and do yard work and this and that.
[02:41:28.268 --> 02:41:28.748]  No!
[02:41:28.748 --> 02:41:29.628]  They're just sitting around.
[02:41:29.628 --> 02:41:31.188]  They're homeless.
[02:41:31.188 --> 02:41:32.389]  They want us to take care of them.
[02:41:32.389 --> 02:41:36.610]  They want to come in and get on the government programs, and they want to take advantage of the system.
[02:41:36.610 --> 02:41:38.110]  But listen, if you were in their situation,
[02:41:38.770 --> 02:41:39.871]  Wouldn't you do the same thing?
[02:41:39.871 --> 02:41:49.280]  I mean... And let's be clear, this is the most uneducated, lowest IQ, most criminal, most desperate of all of Central and South America.
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:51.322]  Pouring in the very worst.
[02:41:51.322 --> 02:41:57.488]  Not all of them, but, I mean, Mexico admits this is the most criminal element ever coming in even to Mexico.
[02:41:58.294 --> 02:42:06.902]  Yeah, and let me tell you, my friends that are down there in Juarez, they call and tell me they have businesses down there and they tell me that they don't want them there.
[02:42:06.902 --> 02:42:09.764]  They're having a hard time with this.
[02:42:09.764 --> 02:42:12.687]  They're like, listen man, we don't want them here as much as you guys don't want them there.
[02:42:13.573 --> 02:42:14.354]  So that's an example.
[02:42:14.354 --> 02:42:19.298]  I was talking to some federales in Cancun last time I was there and they said, listen, El Chapo kept control of things and kept the crime down.
[02:42:19.298 --> 02:42:26.304]  He said, now we have Central American gangs that are fearless and don't care and are shooting everything up and killing police every night and they don't care.
[02:42:26.304 --> 02:42:27.265]  They want to die.
[02:42:27.265 --> 02:42:30.548]  How do you deal with something five times crazier than what's been in Mexico?
[02:42:31.673 --> 02:42:32.633]  You know, exactly.
[02:42:32.633 --> 02:42:40.496]  And you gotta remember this too because the kids that, you know, I know this from Juarez, a lot of the kids, they become sicarios or sicarios when they're young.
[02:42:40.496 --> 02:42:42.457]  And that means killers, trained killers.
[02:42:42.457 --> 02:42:42.717]  Stay there.
[02:42:42.717 --> 02:42:48.539]  Tell us about the real sicarios straight ahead with our amazing guest, David Rodriguez.
[02:42:48.539 --> 02:42:49.399]  David is our guest.
[02:42:49.399 --> 02:42:55.161]  We'll give you his website when we come back on the other side.
[02:42:55.161 --> 02:42:56.161]  Frank in North Carolina.
[02:42:56.161 --> 02:42:57.242]  Thanks for holding so long.
[02:42:57.242 --> 02:42:57.542]  Go ahead.
[02:42:58.190 --> 02:43:00.052]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:00.052 --> 02:43:03.936]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:03.936 --> 02:43:05.358]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:05.358 --> 02:43:07.780]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:07.780 --> 02:43:10.103]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:10.103 --> 02:43:14.127]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:14.127 --> 02:43:16.549]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:17.410 --> 02:43:20.091]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:20.091 --> 02:43:21.452]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:21.452 --> 02:43:22.572]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:22.572 --> 02:43:24.053]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:24.053 --> 02:43:25.113]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:25.113 --> 02:43:26.494]  Put him on pause again.
[02:43:26.494 --> 02:43:27.334]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:27.334 --> 02:43:32.976]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:32.976 --> 02:43:37.498]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:37.498 --> 02:43:40.639]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:40.639 --> 02:43:41.100]  You understand?
[02:43:41.100 --> 02:43:42.740]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:42.740 --> 02:43:43.861]  I need your help, Frank!

[02:45:57.302 --> 02:45:58.742]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[02:45:58.742 --> 02:46:00.643]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[02:46:00.643 --> 02:46:01.243]  It is!
[02:46:01.243 --> 02:46:02.804]  But if you took it with Bish Oil...
[02:46:03.914 --> 02:46:06.115]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[02:46:06.115 --> 02:46:07.455]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:46:07.455 --> 02:46:09.276]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:46:09.276 --> 02:46:11.776]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[02:46:11.776 --> 02:46:13.397]  Brain, body, heart.
[02:46:13.397 --> 02:46:14.857]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[02:46:14.857 --> 02:46:16.238]  You've got the children's.
[02:46:16.238 --> 02:46:17.358]  You've got the adults.
[02:46:17.358 --> 02:46:18.358]  You've got the krill oil.
[02:46:18.358 --> 02:46:20.759]  If you're gonna get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's
[02:46:20.839 --> 02:46:22.560]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:46:47.574 --> 02:46:53.458]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:46:53.458 --> 02:46:59.682]  I just can't do it!
[02:46:59.682 --> 02:47:09.989]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:09.989 --> 02:47:11.910]  I know David Nino Rodriguez.
[02:47:14.062 --> 02:47:15.645]  Take a Joe Biggs down to the border.
[02:47:15.645 --> 02:47:17.848]  David Nino Rodriguez.com is his website.
[02:47:17.848 --> 02:47:20.172]  Nino Boxer on Twitter.
[02:47:20.172 --> 02:47:22.335]  But we need to come down there with him.
[02:47:22.335 --> 02:47:23.617]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:47:23.617 --> 02:47:27.142]  We've got, coming up, Mike Adams.
[02:47:28.621 --> 02:47:39.944]  Hosting the 4th Hour in the War Room with Owen Schroer, but I really appreciate David's courage, because he's not making a big deal out of this, but I heard people even down in that area get harassed now by the cartels and others that they speak out against.
[02:47:39.944 --> 02:47:44.305]  We know thousands of newspapers have been attacked, hundreds of reporters killed in the last 20 years.
[02:47:44.305 --> 02:47:47.846]  The numbers have admitted dead, according to the State Department, in the last decade, are 200,000.
[02:47:47.846 --> 02:47:50.566]  Of course, there's millions that are missing.
[02:47:50.566 --> 02:47:52.107]  Some came north, some disappeared.
[02:47:53.007 --> 02:47:56.955]  When he talks about organ harvesting or child trafficking, that's confirmed.
[02:47:56.955 --> 02:47:59.159]  But it's back of the newspaper and then the Democrats...
[02:48:00.928 --> 02:48:09.954]  Sit up there and say that trying to control our border is insane, but when I fly down to Puerto Vallarta, I love Mexico.
[02:48:09.954 --> 02:48:12.215]  Great food, great people, when there's not the criminals around.
[02:48:12.215 --> 02:48:16.077]  It's either really nice people or the criminals.
[02:48:16.077 --> 02:48:17.958]  I go down there and they say, what hotel are you staying at?
[02:48:17.958 --> 02:48:18.419]  They check it.
[02:48:18.419 --> 02:48:21.961]  You better, the day you leave, you better be leaving or they fine you or arrest you.
[02:48:21.961 --> 02:48:23.302]  That's their country.
[02:48:23.302 --> 02:48:28.305]  Mexico has the strongest border rules in this hemisphere, but that's okay.
[02:48:28.305 --> 02:48:29.185]  That's their country.
[02:48:29.185 --> 02:48:30.146]  Why can't we have any?
[02:48:31.178 --> 02:48:32.659]  But I was interrupting you, sir.
[02:48:32.659 --> 02:48:33.860]  You've got the floor now.
[02:48:33.860 --> 02:48:36.502]  Get into what you talked about, the assassins, how young they are.
[02:48:36.502 --> 02:48:41.125]  From what you're saying, it's devolving, it's getting worse, it's spilling over.
[02:48:41.125 --> 02:48:47.650]  As somebody that's grown up in El Paso, lived it, been a heavyweight champion of the world, been on both sides of the border, please continue.
[02:48:49.437 --> 02:49:09.216]  Yeah, what I was going to say is, and I've known a lot of these kids and my friends, you know, the friends that I grew up around, we, man, we circled these, we were around these kids growing up and, like I said, going down there to fight and, you know, partying and going in the back streets and the Mariscal area and, you know, the whole area, man.
[02:49:09.216 --> 02:49:12.920]  And you meet these kids that are, you know, they get these kids when they're about,
[02:49:13.607 --> 02:49:18.390]  You know, the kids start running the streets when they're about in that poverty stricken area, which is most of Juarez.
[02:49:18.390 --> 02:49:21.893]  Kids start running the streets at about 9, 10, 11 years old, if not earlier.
[02:49:22.820 --> 02:49:38.012]  It's real easy to single out these kids and find them and start giving them drugs and start showing them a kind of like brotherly love or fatherly love or like a family unit type love that they don't have at home.
[02:49:38.012 --> 02:49:47.700]  And once you start giving them drugs and giving them a little bit of cashier in there, it's very easy for them to start, you know, to start pulling strings and have them
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:49.021]  We're good to go.
[02:50:04.201 --> 02:50:07.243]  It's just as bad in Mexico and money goes a lot further over there.
[02:50:07.243 --> 02:50:15.128]  So they start these kids out really young to affect their consciousness into where they have no conscience when they're doing this.
[02:50:15.128 --> 02:50:26.175]  They just know that the love they're getting from their superiors or the people that are handling them, or like you would like to say, like handlers, people that are controlling them, are giving them, you know, that
[02:50:27.056 --> 02:50:29.257]  Well, let me raise this point to you, because the U.S.
[02:50:29.257 --> 02:50:39.359]  has had its own history of violence, people killing each other, everybody does it, but there's almost something where they play on the manliness or the macho-ness of Latin America, where particularly people aren't, on average, afraid to die.
[02:50:39.359 --> 02:50:45.681]  Either people are subservient or they're ready to die, and it just seems like there's just an endless line of people ready to die, ready to kill.
[02:50:46.818 --> 02:50:47.379]  Absolutely.
[02:50:47.379 --> 02:50:49.600]  Over there, it's horrific, man.
[02:50:49.600 --> 02:50:50.541]  It's really big over there.
[02:50:50.541 --> 02:50:56.706]  The whole muchismo thing in El Paso and Juarez, you know, that's half the reason I took up boxing at such a young age.
[02:50:56.706 --> 02:51:00.909]  It's, you know, the biggest sports here in El Paso are soccer and boxing, you know.
[02:51:00.909 --> 02:51:05.673]  So, especially in Juarez, man, everyone goes to the boxing gym at a young age and starts learning how to box.
[02:51:05.673 --> 02:51:07.575]  That's how I got acquainted with these kids at so young.
[02:51:09.335 --> 02:51:14.497]  Yeah, they get this kind of fatherly or brotherly love from these older gang members.
[02:51:14.497 --> 02:51:19.759]  There's nothing wrong with masculinity, but we need good men in control of that.
[02:51:19.759 --> 02:51:20.819]  So where are the good men?
[02:51:20.819 --> 02:51:24.420]  Where's the vacuum now in Latin America?
[02:51:24.420 --> 02:51:27.761]  It's hard, because you've got to understand, it's hard to make money over there.
[02:51:27.761 --> 02:51:29.202]  The way to make money over there is drugs.
[02:51:29.818 --> 02:51:30.838]  That's the fastest way.
[02:51:30.838 --> 02:51:35.280]  And if you have a business, you're most likely going to get extorted if you're making good money.
[02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:47.883]  And going back to what I was talking before about the extortion, the way that happens is people have businesses, restaurants, bars, something like that, and gangs will come in and say, hey, listen, we'll offer you protection if you give us 20% of your profits monthly.
[02:51:48.163 --> 02:51:57.909]  Well then what started happening in 2006-2013 is multiple gangs started coming into the same businesses and offering their protection or whatever and demanding payment.
[02:51:57.909 --> 02:52:01.752]  So now the people owning the businesses were just slaves and just paying off gangs.
[02:52:01.752 --> 02:52:07.015]  So that's why they wanted to come to America so bad because they were just basically... Sure, and that's what collapses tyranny.
[02:52:07.015 --> 02:52:11.258]  Whether it's communism or radical Islam or these drug gangs, they make everybody slaves.
[02:52:12.188 --> 02:52:14.269]  Exactly, and so that's what was going on.
[02:52:14.269 --> 02:52:21.471]  So now you had multiple, you had the Barrio Aztecas, you had the Zetas, the Pasanos, you had all these different types of gangs coming in demanding payment.
[02:52:21.471 --> 02:52:31.913]  And so, what are you supposed to do when you own a business and you're having to pay, you know, five or six different gangs to just... It just makes you give up, and that's why civilization collapsed.
[02:52:31.913 --> 02:52:37.735]  It's not that there isn't know-how in the industry, it's that everybody's getting shook down, so the best defense against being shaken down is either move or give up.
[02:52:38.556 --> 02:52:38.796]  Right.
[02:52:38.796 --> 02:52:40.919]  And that's why all the businesses came to El Paso.
[02:52:40.919 --> 02:52:42.861]  And listen, I have nothing against that.
[02:52:42.861 --> 02:52:44.663]  It's doing good for the economy.
[02:52:44.663 --> 02:52:47.186]  But look, that's just far and few between.
[02:52:47.186 --> 02:52:48.588]  Those are the good people coming here.
[02:52:48.588 --> 02:52:49.489]  So let me ask you this then.
[02:52:49.489 --> 02:52:51.731]  What does Trump, what does Mexico need to do?
[02:52:51.731 --> 02:52:53.033]  Because here's the deal.
[02:52:53.033 --> 02:52:54.174]  I don't want to have war with Syria.
[02:52:54.174 --> 02:52:54.795]  I was against that.
[02:52:54.795 --> 02:52:55.776]  I was against the Iraq War.
[02:52:55.776 --> 02:52:56.256]  I was against it all.
[02:52:57.130 --> 02:53:02.991]  But you've got Venezuela, communist run, a dictator, a thousand people starving a day, a week.
[02:53:02.991 --> 02:53:05.932]  It's collapsed into Central America.
[02:53:05.932 --> 02:53:09.053]  The UN set up bases to flood us out of Venezuela.
[02:53:09.053 --> 02:53:12.294]  And that is on our doorstep and they are saying they're doing that.
[02:53:12.294 --> 02:53:13.694]  Brazil's called up its military.
[02:53:13.694 --> 02:53:14.854]  Colombia has to stop it.
[02:53:14.854 --> 02:53:15.814]  We haven't.
[02:53:15.814 --> 02:53:17.635]  I don't want to invade Venezuela.
[02:53:17.635 --> 02:53:21.196]  I'm just saying it's in our national interest to stop the collapsing border.
[02:53:21.196 --> 02:53:22.556]  And it goes right back to Mexico.
[02:53:24.236 --> 02:53:28.118]  Mexico has to take control of the problem and help us.
[02:53:28.118 --> 02:53:29.538]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:53:29.538 --> 02:53:35.661]  And you know, this is funny that you're saying that because I came up with a good idea.
[02:53:35.661 --> 02:53:37.281]  Actually, a friend and I came up with a good idea.
[02:53:37.281 --> 02:53:38.582]  When you cross over to Mexico,
[02:53:39.640 --> 02:53:40.301]  I don't
[02:53:57.085 --> 02:54:02.748]  For people coming back over to the States or going over there, however it works out, to where that can actually fund the wall.
[02:54:02.748 --> 02:54:03.909]  That can build the wall.
[02:54:03.909 --> 02:54:06.570]  Because you've got hundreds and thousands of people crossing here daily.
[02:54:06.570 --> 02:54:08.131]  Well, you're way ahead of that.
[02:54:08.131 --> 02:54:09.832]  That is actually Trump's plan is.
[02:54:09.832 --> 02:54:12.233]  They do want some type of crossing fee.
[02:54:12.233 --> 02:54:12.894]  Oh, okay.
[02:54:12.894 --> 02:54:13.954]  So, there you go.
[02:54:13.954 --> 02:54:14.955]  That would be beautiful.
[02:54:14.955 --> 02:54:15.615]  That would work.
[02:54:15.615 --> 02:54:19.297]  Because that, essentially, you're really having Mexico pay for the wall if you do that.
[02:54:19.297 --> 02:54:20.058]  Well, think about this.
[02:54:20.058 --> 02:54:22.999]  You've got all over wherever you live toll roads to get somewhere quicker.
[02:54:22.999 --> 02:54:25.060]  You don't have a toll road coming into the country.
[02:54:25.060 --> 02:54:25.821]  That's insane.
[02:54:26.587 --> 02:54:28.272]  Yeah, yeah, there's free bridges.
[02:54:28.272 --> 02:54:29.054]  You gotta remember that, too.
[02:54:29.054 --> 02:54:30.357]  There's a free bridge.
[02:54:30.357 --> 02:54:33.585]  And in the free bridge, most people cross through the free bridge.
[02:54:33.585 --> 02:54:34.407]  It's just, it's just...
[02:54:35.442 --> 02:54:38.023]  It's just, it's like the floodgates are open.
[02:54:38.023 --> 02:54:40.264]  And anybody and everybody can come here.
[02:54:40.264 --> 02:54:50.888]  But like I said, the people that are, the miles that are done with, the thousands of miles that have no wall, and the people that are just flooding over here, I'm telling you, El Paso's getting about 2,000 a day right now.
[02:54:50.888 --> 02:54:54.249]  And we're releasing two to five hundred into the general population right now.
[02:54:54.249 --> 02:55:00.872]  And I interrupted you earlier, but Jim Acosta went down to El Paso, and he said, oh look, there's a wall, no crime, see no problem here.
[02:55:00.872 --> 02:55:03.653]  But the talk to the locals, they say, no, once they built this, crime went down.
[02:55:04.574 --> 02:55:05.515]  Yeah, it did.
[02:55:05.515 --> 02:55:07.356]  But then you've got to remember, too, tunneling.
[02:55:07.356 --> 02:55:08.117]  That's a big issue.
[02:55:08.117 --> 02:55:12.640]  So I would like to know, the one question I have for Trump is how are you going to handle the tunneling?
[02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:16.583]  Because most drugs are sent, are crossed over through tunneling.
[02:55:16.583 --> 02:55:18.985]  And they have, you know, an elaborate tunnel system.
[02:55:18.985 --> 02:55:27.072]  Let me just say it, I'm not a hard ass, but if you put the Marines on the border, it's constitutional to shoot people crossing, not women and children, but cartels digging under.
[02:55:27.072 --> 02:55:29.794]  That's a military, you start killing them, they're probably going to stop.
[02:55:30.683 --> 02:55:31.864]  Yeah, I agree with you on that.
[02:55:31.864 --> 02:55:33.246]  There has to be ways.
[02:55:33.246 --> 02:55:34.788]  We have to set up these kind of boundaries.
[02:55:34.788 --> 02:55:37.171]  We've got to take a harder road to deal with this.
[02:55:37.171 --> 02:55:41.256]  But Mexico has to be responsible for what's happening because they're not cooperating.
[02:55:41.256 --> 02:55:44.460]  They've never had to cooperate because they've had everything... So what do we do?
[02:55:44.460 --> 02:55:45.621]  The same thing Trump just did?
[02:55:45.621 --> 02:55:47.443]  Cut the funding to Central America?
[02:55:47.443 --> 02:55:48.725]  Tell Mexico you better do this?
[02:55:49.542 --> 02:55:51.024]  Yeah, they have to, man.
[02:55:51.024 --> 02:55:51.964]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:55:51.964 --> 02:55:59.832]  I just, you know, everyone says the wall doesn't work, but I think the statistics on that is like 90% lower illegal immigration wherever there's a wall.
[02:55:59.832 --> 02:56:02.094]  So, to me, it's like a no-brainer.
[02:56:02.094 --> 02:56:03.075]  This works.
[02:56:03.075 --> 02:56:05.998]  And it's going to at least slow down the immigration, the legal immigration.
[02:56:05.998 --> 02:56:07.620]  Oh, it creates a big speed bump, at least.
[02:56:08.420 --> 02:56:08.520]  It's
[02:56:26.118 --> 02:56:32.201]  I just think you catch somebody smuggling a kid that's not your aunt or uncle or mom or dad, we just have a summary execution.
[02:56:32.201 --> 02:56:35.283]  Which I'm not in for police state, but they're the ones smuggling kids in mass.
[02:56:35.283 --> 02:56:36.523]  They admit are going to sex slavery.
[02:56:36.523 --> 02:56:42.747]  And I say you catch somebody without a kid that isn't their family, I say they get a quick trial and they get executed.
[02:56:42.747 --> 02:56:44.127]  And that's huge right now.
[02:56:44.127 --> 02:56:50.951]  And in fact one of the border patrol agents told me that right now there's so many people coming here claiming that they have these kids and they're not even their kids.
[02:56:51.929 --> 02:56:53.029]  They're not their kids.
[02:56:53.029 --> 02:56:55.691]  They're basically- I want to come back.
[02:56:55.691 --> 02:56:57.211]  I'm really impressed with your work, David.
[02:56:57.211 --> 02:56:58.232]  I want to get you back on soon.
[02:56:58.232 --> 02:57:01.593]  Let's do five more minutes on what you think Trump should do and just other observations.
[02:57:01.593 --> 02:57:03.594]  And please come back on all the shows and mine as well.
[02:57:03.594 --> 02:57:05.315]  And listen, folks, I'm not a police state guy.
[02:57:05.315 --> 02:57:06.895]  I believe the Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[02:57:06.895 --> 02:57:09.576]  We got this big, fancy egalitarian system.
[02:57:09.576 --> 02:57:10.937]  You break down civilization.
[02:57:12.822 --> 02:57:14.623]  You lose law and order.
[02:57:14.623 --> 02:57:20.167]  And so in between the point of losing law and order and civilization, once your leg's cut off, you gotta put a tourniquet on it.
[02:57:20.167 --> 02:57:29.212]  And I'm just telling you, the stuff at the border is so out of control, even Obama's former head of ICE, Obama's head of DHS, they both say, triple the worst it's ever been, totally insane.
[02:57:29.212 --> 02:57:30.753]  Our border's basically collapsed.
[02:57:30.753 --> 02:57:32.714]  And then Trump's the traitor for trying to block it.
[02:57:32.714 --> 02:57:34.115]  If anything, Trump hasn't done enough.
[02:57:34.115 --> 02:57:35.836]  Forget that law enforcement emergency.
[02:57:35.836 --> 02:57:40.959]  Declare a national emergency as commander-in-chief, put the military on the border, and start killing the cartel leaders.
[02:57:40.959 --> 02:57:41.680]  Just wipe them out.
[02:57:45.266 --> 02:57:53.656]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:57:53.656 --> 02:57:55.118]  Believe me, I know.
[02:57:55.118 --> 02:57:59.423]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:57:59.423 --> 02:58:02.888]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.

[02:58:05.049 --> 02:58:25.223]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:01:01.479 --> 03:01:05.542]  So this, everyone here is for Beto O'Rourke and I'm the only, I'm like, I speak out against him openly.
[03:01:05.542 --> 03:01:07.023]  I don't care.
[03:01:07.023 --> 03:01:11.107]  You know, to me it's like, you know, I was a hometown hero here when I was fighting.
[03:01:11.107 --> 03:01:19.134]  I carried a lot of clout in my boxing, in the heavyweight boxing division and I brought a lot of, I brought the spotlight to El Paso, Texas and I did a lot of good things for this town.
[03:01:19.934 --> 03:01:20.815]  I think so.
[03:01:32.566 --> 03:01:47.473]  Look, their outlook, the Hispanic culture's outlook, or the Mexican people here, their outlook on the wall is that Trump just wants to build something to stamp his name on it, and the things he said about Mexican people are disgraceful, and he doesn't care for the Mexican people.
[03:01:47.473 --> 03:01:50.514]  They think Beto O'Rourke, they think it's like cheering for the Dallas Cowboys.
[03:01:50.874 --> 03:01:51.054]  I don't
[03:02:13.741 --> 03:02:15.683]  Yeah, every other country has it, and Mexico has it.
[03:02:38.411 --> 03:02:42.995]  I don't understand why we can't have, we're the greatest nation on earth and we can't protect our borders?
[03:02:42.995 --> 03:02:44.236]  That's insanity, man.
[03:02:44.236 --> 03:02:50.741]  That's just... What did you think when you saw the footage of the tens of thousands breaking over Guatemala, running over police?
[03:02:50.741 --> 03:02:51.622]  That's dangerous.
[03:02:51.622 --> 03:02:54.584]  And they've got Mexico has 25 foot fences.
[03:02:54.584 --> 03:02:55.445]  It wasn't strong enough.
[03:02:56.297 --> 03:02:58.659]  No, I'm telling you what, that's going to happen here.
[03:02:58.659 --> 03:02:59.780]  Get ready for it.
[03:02:59.780 --> 03:03:06.926]  Because I'm telling you, I think Soros and all of them are coordinating something big and I'm sure you're on top of it.
[03:03:06.926 --> 03:03:09.308]  You have your fingers on the pulse and this is going to be ground zero.
[03:03:09.308 --> 03:03:11.210]  El Paso is going to be ground zero.
[03:03:11.210 --> 03:03:13.812]  So, you know, I just recently moved back to El Paso.
[03:03:13.812 --> 03:03:18.856]  I was living in Vegas and I've come back and I've just been reminded about how severe this problem really is.
[03:03:18.856 --> 03:03:20.778]  And Border Patrol people are reaching out to me.
[03:03:22.316 --> 03:03:28.779]  And contacting me and giving me the problem and saying, David, you're the voice out here for, you know, you back Trump, everyone knows you do.
[03:03:28.779 --> 03:03:32.060]  Do something, get on some programs, do something and talk about this.
[03:03:32.060 --> 03:03:35.521]  And you're the first one that's giving me the platform to talk about this and I greatly appreciate it.
[03:03:35.521 --> 03:03:37.282]  Sir, we really appreciate your leadership, David.
[03:03:37.282 --> 03:03:40.783]  You're very well spoken, a smart guy and a patriot.
[03:03:40.783 --> 03:03:42.403]  And we salute, the Border Patrol's right.
[03:03:42.403 --> 03:03:44.124]  Thank you for taking on the leadership role.
[03:03:44.124 --> 03:03:46.845]  We know you're not getting paid for doing it, but thanks for doing it for the country.
[03:03:47.540 --> 03:03:59.367]  You know what else, Alex, is that there's some big news coming to this area that I can't tell you on air, but I can tell you off air that what's getting ready to happen here in the next couple weeks is enormous.
[03:04:01.798 --> 03:04:05.101]  And it's patriots coming together to do something big.
[03:04:05.101 --> 03:04:07.022]  Let me tell the producer, please.
[03:04:07.022 --> 03:04:07.843]  I'll get your number.
[03:04:07.843 --> 03:04:09.224]  I'll have Daria give you mine.
[03:04:09.224 --> 03:04:10.025]  Let's talk this evening.
[03:04:10.025 --> 03:04:11.446]  I'm going to continue on to the next hour.
[03:04:11.446 --> 03:04:12.307]  But let's talk soon.
[03:04:12.307 --> 03:04:14.088]  And I know you're at the tip of the spear.
[03:04:14.088 --> 03:04:14.889]  We salute you, sir.
[03:04:14.889 --> 03:04:16.310]  And thank you so much for the time.
[03:04:16.310 --> 03:04:18.012]  Is that the best website?
[03:04:18.012 --> 03:04:19.533]  DavidNinoRodriguez.com?
[03:04:20.379 --> 03:04:22.681]  Yeah, I mean, that's my website, David Nino Rodriguez.
[03:04:22.681 --> 03:04:24.102]  My Twitter is NinoBoxer.
[03:04:24.102 --> 03:04:25.904]  My Instagram is NinoBoxing.
[03:04:25.904 --> 03:04:31.268]  And soon I'm going to be uploading videos to IndieStream, because I don't trust YouTube anymore.
[03:04:31.268 --> 03:04:36.953]  And I know I want to be really voiced about what I'm saying, so I'm going to be going on IndieStream to put all my videos on.
[03:04:36.953 --> 03:04:40.175]  And my friend owns that, and that's what we're going to be doing, because we need a platform.
[03:04:40.175 --> 03:04:44.699]  Well, David, thanks for being a modern Paul Revere and trying to save the country and our futures.
[03:04:44.699 --> 03:04:45.320]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:45.780 --> 03:04:46.780]  You've got us so much, Alex.
[03:04:46.780 --> 03:04:47.440]  Thank you very much.
[03:04:47.440 --> 03:04:48.001]  Let's talk soon.
[03:04:48.001 --> 03:04:49.061]  Get him back on next week if we can.
[03:04:49.061 --> 03:04:50.761]  I'm going to come right back up with Mike Adam.
[03:04:50.761 --> 03:04:54.222]  Stay with us.
[03:04:54.222 --> 03:04:57.483]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[03:04:57.483 --> 03:05:00.484]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[03:05:00.484 --> 03:05:07.365]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[03:05:07.365 --> 03:05:08.485]  X2 is back.
[03:05:08.485 --> 03:05:09.286]  We got it.
[03:05:09.286 --> 03:05:10.966]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[03:05:10.966 --> 03:05:12.546]  We rushed it into production.
[03:05:12.546 --> 03:05:13.327]  It's been bottled.
[03:05:13.327 --> 03:05:15.007]  The labels are being put on today.
[03:05:15.327 --> 03:05:22.431]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler, right here to Austin, from the plant in the Rockies, and it's going to be shipped out to you.
[03:05:22.431 --> 03:05:23.912]  Be sure to sign up for auto-ship.
[03:05:23.912 --> 03:05:25.753]  An additional 10% off.
[03:05:25.753 --> 03:05:30.376]  The 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[03:05:30.376 --> 03:05:32.277]  Research the iodine conspiracy.
[03:05:32.277 --> 03:05:34.059]  Find out why it's so important.
[03:05:34.059 --> 03:05:35.880]  Find out what the globalists don't want you to have.
[03:05:36.580 --> 03:05:40.706]  The good halogens, you have the bad halogens at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:40.706 --> 03:05:41.948]  That's the umbrella site.
[03:05:41.948 --> 03:05:43.169]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:05:43.169 --> 03:05:44.731]  They should write the supplements.
[03:05:44.731 --> 03:05:47.916]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:05:47.916 --> 03:05:49.838]  It is X2 Original.
[03:05:49.838 --> 03:05:52.161]  Now back at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:11.032 --> 03:06:15.853]  We're fighting hard, standing up for common sense, not selling out to the globalists.
[03:06:15.853 --> 03:06:19.334]  We're here, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m.
[03:06:19.334 --> 03:06:19.975]  to 6 p.m.
[03:06:19.975 --> 03:06:23.175]  Central Standard Time.
[03:06:23.175 --> 03:06:28.237]  That's right, David Knight in the morning, myself right here, and then 6 o'clock, 3 to 6 o'clock p.m.
[03:06:28.237 --> 03:06:31.118]  Central, you've got Owen Schroer in the war room.
[03:06:31.118 --> 03:06:35.579]  By the way, Roger Stone's gonna be joining us tomorrow, and I want to speak about this right now.
[03:06:37.355 --> 03:06:40.640]  I've gotten a bunch of calls because Roger went on XM Radio.
[03:06:41.730 --> 03:06:47.093]  Last week and kind of needled me and said, yeah, Alex didn't sell him a T-shirt.
[03:06:47.093 --> 03:06:52.815]  Alex hadn't really been having me on and I'm a little disappointed in Alex.
[03:06:52.815 --> 03:07:02.120]  And I just think that's Roger and the publicity hounded him because Roger knows damn well that as soon as he got that gag order, he stopped talking to me.
[03:07:02.120 --> 03:07:09.063]  And so I sent him a message over the weekend and I said, what the hell is this?
[03:07:09.063 --> 03:07:10.704]  And he said, oh, I'm just joking, you know.
[03:07:11.912 --> 03:07:16.634]  I had to talk to lawyers for the last month and a half, and they think I'm able to actually come on your show.
[03:07:16.634 --> 03:07:21.916]  So I'll come on Thursday with a bunch of exclusive stuff, but not about Mueller or his trial.
[03:07:21.916 --> 03:07:26.878]  And I told them, Roger, my listeners want to jump off a cliff when you talk about Mueller or Russiagate.
[03:07:26.878 --> 03:07:28.259]  They know it's bull.
[03:07:28.259 --> 03:07:29.840]  But I said, why don't you come on about JFK?
[03:07:29.840 --> 03:07:30.560]  You're an expert on that.
[03:07:30.560 --> 03:07:32.121]  Why don't you come on about Trump?
[03:07:32.121 --> 03:07:33.941]  Why don't you come on about the border?
[03:07:33.941 --> 03:07:35.062]  You're a good political pundit.
[03:07:35.062 --> 03:07:36.822]  It's why I hired you.
[03:07:36.822 --> 03:07:37.743]  So I'll make the statement now.
[03:07:39.688 --> 03:07:45.151]  I hired Roger Stone, I guess about a year and a half ago, or a little longer, to be a political pundit.
[03:07:45.151 --> 03:07:46.292]  And I like Roger as a person.
[03:07:46.292 --> 03:07:48.393]  He's a smart guy.
[03:07:48.393 --> 03:07:52.796]  And even when I wanted to do political stunts that weren't deceptive, he'd say that goes too far.
[03:07:52.796 --> 03:07:58.759]  So I thought, well, this must be a dirty trick to say that Roger Stone is the king of dirty tricks.
[03:07:58.759 --> 03:08:02.882]  Because compared to other political operatives, this guy is as clean as a driven stone.
[03:08:02.882 --> 03:08:04.803]  He kind of revels in them calling him a villain.
[03:08:04.803 --> 03:08:05.323]  He likes it.
[03:08:05.323 --> 03:08:06.104]  He thinks it's sexy.
[03:08:07.342 --> 03:08:11.405]  Uh, but then I saw that clip of him on that show.
[03:08:11.405 --> 03:08:14.887]  No, I know Alex is so successful, he needs to make a donation to my fund, blah, blah, blah.
[03:08:14.887 --> 03:08:16.688]  And I just thought mainly it was a joke.
[03:08:16.688 --> 03:08:18.689]  Maybe it was Roger being a little bit weird.
[03:08:18.689 --> 03:08:24.853]  But what irritated me about it was, I probably sent the guy 20 texts and he didn't respond back to them.
[03:08:24.853 --> 03:08:27.254]  He just said, I can't talk to you, I'm under a gag order.
[03:08:27.254 --> 03:08:29.596]  And then he's on an ESPN show talking about me.
[03:08:29.596 --> 03:08:31.217]  So then the wheels start to turn in the head.
[03:08:32.827 --> 03:08:33.887]  What's going on there?
[03:08:33.887 --> 03:08:36.848]  Why would you not talk to me when you talk to some other show?
[03:08:36.848 --> 03:08:37.448]  So that's it.
[03:08:37.448 --> 03:08:39.888]  Roger hasn't worked here in months.
[03:08:39.888 --> 03:08:41.729]  I think he's overall a good guy.
[03:08:41.729 --> 03:08:42.589]  I'm overall a good guy.
[03:08:42.589 --> 03:08:44.189]  None of us are perfect.
[03:08:44.189 --> 03:08:47.210]  But I hired him to be a pundit.
[03:08:47.210 --> 03:08:53.611]  And if he did anything I don't like, it was recommend Jerome Corsi to work here.
[03:08:53.611 --> 03:08:58.072]  I've known Corsi for 18, 19 years and never did anything but be nice to that guy.
[03:08:58.072 --> 03:09:00.092]  It was all a one-way street.
[03:09:00.092 --> 03:09:02.553]  And he and Larry Klayman have sued me
[03:09:06.141 --> 03:09:21.946]  Because Roger Stone and him getting in the middle of it, and then seeing statements by Corsi out there about how we were all trying to get, how we were in contact with Assange and all this crap, and I know, I was there.
[03:09:21.946 --> 03:09:24.267]  Assange wouldn't give us the back of his hand.
[03:09:25.219 --> 03:09:27.241]  He was the responsive talk to the hand.
[03:09:27.241 --> 03:09:33.528]  I'm still not against Assange, but he was the cutesy then on the Guardian and the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN.
[03:09:33.528 --> 03:09:43.199]  So, you know, the idea of that, all because Mueller was breathing down Corsi's neck, that he would then sue me when I gave the guy severance pay and everything is just creepy.
[03:09:43.199 --> 03:09:44.080]  So I have a new rule.
[03:09:46.305 --> 03:09:47.726]  You ever worked in D.C.?
[03:09:47.726 --> 03:09:48.807]  I'm not hiring you.
[03:09:48.807 --> 03:09:50.448]  I've always been in Texas.
[03:09:50.448 --> 03:09:51.749]  I've never been about L.A.
[03:09:51.749 --> 03:09:52.209]  or D.C.
[03:09:52.209 --> 03:09:53.270]  or New York.
[03:09:53.270 --> 03:10:00.015]  Nothing against you if you come from there, but if you come from the power structure, I don't care if you're Roger Stone or Jerome Corsi or nobody, I'm not working with you!
[03:10:00.015 --> 03:10:01.296]  How's that sound?
[03:10:01.296 --> 03:10:06.080]  I'm in Texas, I work with regular, normal people, not swamp creatures.
[03:10:06.080 --> 03:10:08.542]  And I'm not involved in any of this crap.
[03:10:08.542 --> 03:10:11.424]  I'm having Roger on tomorrow, look forward to talking to him.
[03:10:11.424 --> 03:10:14.066]  It's just that you get, you step in this crap,
[03:10:15.259 --> 03:10:17.040]  You get the smell of it on you.
[03:10:17.040 --> 03:10:19.600]  And I'm talking about The Swamp, not Roger.
[03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:23.081]  Because man, the only power I got in this world is I'm a straight shooter.
[03:10:23.081 --> 03:10:23.781]  That's all I got.
[03:10:23.781 --> 03:10:27.703]  That's all I came into this world with is I'm a straight shooter.
[03:10:27.703 --> 03:10:29.163]  There's no subterfuge.
[03:10:29.163 --> 03:10:31.444]  There's no Machiavelli with me.
[03:10:31.444 --> 03:10:34.665]  Other than I understand Machiavelli and crap.
[03:10:34.665 --> 03:10:35.545]  I'm from Texas.
[03:10:35.545 --> 03:10:37.085]  I'm a real Texan.
[03:10:37.085 --> 03:10:39.726]  I'm what folks talked about Texas used to be.
[03:10:39.726 --> 03:10:41.266]  And everybody better figure that out.
[03:10:41.266 --> 03:10:43.167]  That I'm straight up.
[03:10:44.102 --> 03:10:48.063]  And I don't screw somebody over just because I've got an advantage over them.
[03:10:48.063 --> 03:10:53.205]  All I do is get people out of my way that are screwing with me and my mission.
[03:10:53.205 --> 03:10:55.326]  So, that's what I have to say about that.
[03:10:55.326 --> 03:11:04.589]  The Young Turks put out this huge lying report when they took Gulf War dictator money and all this crap about me and Roger and our dirty tricks and how we stormed the Young Turks show.
[03:11:04.589 --> 03:11:08.551]  And I hear watching, and I almost played it the other day, Mike Adams taking over four minutes.
[03:11:10.026 --> 03:11:10.706]  I almost played it.
[03:11:10.706 --> 03:11:12.888]  I was like, why even play it?
[03:11:12.888 --> 03:11:14.869]  Almost every comment hates him.
[03:11:14.869 --> 03:11:16.890]  Every comment sees through him.
[03:11:16.890 --> 03:11:21.253]  They said he stormed our stage, broke into our building.
[03:11:21.253 --> 03:11:27.076]  They didn't tell you it was the RNC, a parking garage with plastic put around it with huge air conditioners blowing.
[03:11:27.076 --> 03:11:28.517]  I love it, it was like 60 degrees.
[03:11:28.517 --> 03:11:30.858]  And we're walking by, they go, hey, come on, come on, it's producers.
[03:11:30.858 --> 03:11:32.259]  I go, I'll be back in 10 minutes.
[03:11:32.259 --> 03:11:33.260]  It was a buffet.
[03:11:33.260 --> 03:11:35.241]  I could do 100 interviews a day if I wanted.
[03:11:35.241 --> 03:11:38.203]  Went and did a few interviews, walked back by, steering a brake, go, hey, how you doing?
[03:11:39.178 --> 03:11:43.605]  They blow up, make a deal of it, and then point their finger at Roger and say he took over.
[03:11:43.605 --> 03:11:46.148]  He was 30 feet away.
[03:11:46.148 --> 03:11:47.951]  He never even got near their stage.
[03:11:47.951 --> 03:11:49.633]  It was stages everywhere.
[03:11:49.633 --> 03:11:51.576]  It was people milling around like at a mall.
[03:11:51.576 --> 03:11:53.099]  Imagine, you know, like mall kiosk.
[03:11:55.199 --> 03:12:02.442]  But he acts like, oh, we want on his show, oh, we want to be a guy that takes money from Gulf War, Gulf dictators.
[03:12:02.442 --> 03:12:04.603]  We want to be a guy that takes Soros money.
[03:12:04.603 --> 03:12:07.585]  We want to take a guy that betrayed Bernie Sanders and sold out to Hillary.
[03:12:07.585 --> 03:12:09.606]  We need on his failed show.
[03:12:09.606 --> 03:12:16.829]  Hey, Sink and that chicken neck woman on your show, you have the stink of failure about you and dishonor.
[03:12:16.829 --> 03:12:18.790]  We don't want anywhere near you.
[03:12:20.137 --> 03:12:24.619]  So your little pipe dream that me and Roger and our dirty tricks have had some falling out.
[03:12:24.619 --> 03:12:26.759]  There are no dirty tricks by me.
[03:12:26.759 --> 03:12:30.040]  I never saw dirty tricks by Roger Stone.
[03:12:30.040 --> 03:12:35.102]  And I do think it's a little weird what he said on that XM show.
[03:12:35.102 --> 03:12:39.323]  But you know, I do weird stuff on there as well, but it doesn't matter.
[03:12:39.323 --> 03:12:40.124]  I have a rule.
[03:12:40.124 --> 03:12:42.024]  It's discriminatory.
[03:12:42.024 --> 03:12:46.446]  I don't care if you're black or white, Jewish or German, Chinese or Japanese or Mexican.
[03:12:47.483 --> 03:12:49.765]  If you've worked in the swamp in Washington D.C.
[03:12:49.765 --> 03:12:55.549]  or you work for Hollywood in any meaningful way, your ass ain't getting hired here and not within a thousand yards of me.
[03:12:55.549 --> 03:13:02.254]  Because every time I get crapped on and stabbed in the back, I don't think people in the swamp can even help it.
[03:13:02.254 --> 03:13:07.798]  It's like Congressman Gohmert from Texas said to Sundar Pichai a few months ago when I was there.
[03:13:07.798 --> 03:13:13.182]  When Pichai's lying to their face about censorship, he goes, you know, I don't think you know the light if you saw it because you've never seen it.
[03:13:14.161 --> 03:13:16.842]  So let me get this straight for D.C.
[03:13:16.842 --> 03:13:18.443]  I don't want your D.C.
[03:13:18.443 --> 03:13:20.063]  I don't want your power.
[03:13:20.063 --> 03:13:21.904]  I don't want to be a bureaucrat.
[03:13:21.904 --> 03:13:24.225]  I don't want to hang around with your so-called elites.
[03:13:24.225 --> 03:13:26.586]  I don't like you.
[03:13:26.586 --> 03:13:28.886]  I don't like you.
[03:13:28.886 --> 03:13:31.167]  I don't want to be around you.
[03:13:31.167 --> 03:13:33.168]  I wanted to hire people to set up a D.C.
[03:13:33.168 --> 03:13:36.769]  bureau to ask real questions and do real things to save the country.
[03:13:36.769 --> 03:13:41.591]  But again, you can't save the swamp with the swamp.
[03:13:41.591 --> 03:13:43.452]  So I piss on the swamp.
[03:13:44.537 --> 03:13:49.161]  Venting the swamp is only good to be a toilet.
[03:13:49.161 --> 03:13:50.242]  And our crew understands that.
[03:13:50.242 --> 03:13:51.163]  I love the Midwest.
[03:13:51.163 --> 03:13:52.084]  I love the Southwest.
[03:13:52.084 --> 03:13:52.784]  I love the South.
[03:13:52.784 --> 03:13:56.568]  I love the good people in Michigan and New York and all the hard-working farmers.
[03:13:56.568 --> 03:14:00.011]  When I say New York or D.C., I mean people from the swamp.
[03:14:00.011 --> 03:14:01.312]  Insiders that come from that world.
[03:14:01.312 --> 03:14:08.078]  Because they're so used to the betrayal and the betraying that they don't know the light when they see it.
[03:14:08.078 --> 03:14:09.740]  So come out of Babylon, my children.
[03:14:11.343 --> 03:14:14.566]  I'm saying to myself, all right, we're going to go to break, my cab's taking over.
[03:14:14.566 --> 03:14:18.209]  Without your financial support, I got so tied up in the last interview, you didn't plug once last hour.
[03:14:18.209 --> 03:14:20.110]  Without you, we're done.
[03:14:20.110 --> 03:14:29.658]  50% off all the apparel, all the ball caps, all the t-shirts, all the great Molon Labe, come and take it, tyranny of response, Alex Jones is forbidden information.

[03:15:53.305 --> 03:15:54.526]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.526 --> 03:15:58.449]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.449 --> 03:15:59.990]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:02.953]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:02.953 --> 03:16:08.517]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.517 --> 03:16:09.718]  I can help you, too.

[03:16:22.868 --> 03:16:29.212]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.212 --> 03:16:32.253]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.253 --> 03:16:38.177]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.177 --> 03:16:41.959]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:41.959 --> 03:16:43.240]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.240 --> 03:16:44.580]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.580 --> 03:16:50.784]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[03:20:13.669 --> 03:20:19.234]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:19.234 --> 03:20:22.538]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[03:20:24.668 --> 03:20:26.929]  Alright everybody, thanks for continuing with us here.
[03:20:26.929 --> 03:20:31.332]  Mike Adams stepping in for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show today.
[03:20:31.332 --> 03:20:37.915]  I'm not in the studio, but I'm definitely in the thick of things in terms of covering the important news.
[03:20:37.915 --> 03:20:44.819]  As you know, I tend to cover health, medicine, health freedom, nutrition, food freedom, those kinds of angles, some science as well.
[03:20:45.619 --> 03:20:53.980]  And there's a really important story that came across my desk this morning that I went ahead and wrote up and posted on my website, Natural News.
[03:20:53.980 --> 03:21:05.382]  It's about the fact that if you're an organ donor, you need to know that new science has shown that even after you're pronounced dead, you're actually still alive and still conscious.
[03:21:05.382 --> 03:21:08.283]  And this science, and this was covered by Fox News, by the way.
[03:21:08.283 --> 03:21:11.203]  Dr. Sam Parnia is a researcher.
[03:21:11.203 --> 03:21:14.604]  He studies consciousness after official death.
[03:21:15.242 --> 03:21:22.331]  What happens is, when you're an organ donor, these surgeons, they want your organs because that's the profit center for the hospital.
[03:21:22.331 --> 03:21:25.294]  So, the minute your heart stops beating, they pronounce you dead.
[03:21:25.294 --> 03:21:26.015]  Boom.
[03:21:26.015 --> 03:21:26.856]  But guess what?
[03:21:26.856 --> 03:21:33.244]  Your brain is conscious, alive, aware, for several minutes after your heart stops beating.
[03:21:33.954 --> 03:21:35.154]  You are feeling things.
[03:21:35.154 --> 03:21:36.275]  You just can't move.
[03:21:36.275 --> 03:21:42.837]  You can't scream as these surgeons cut into your body and start ripping your organs out of your torso.
[03:21:42.837 --> 03:21:47.379]  I don't, I'm not trying to be graphic here, but this is what they do, okay?
[03:21:47.379 --> 03:21:49.799]  And you, you can feel everything.
[03:21:49.799 --> 03:21:54.041]  You are aware, you are awake, you are alive, even though they pronounce you dead.
[03:21:54.716 --> 03:22:08.107]  And the way that these scientists know this is because they've had, they've documented numerous cases of heart attack patients whose hearts stopped beating and then they were saved a couple of minutes later.
[03:22:08.107 --> 03:22:12.010]  You know, the heart came back, they were given CPR, what have you, different things.
[03:22:12.699 --> 03:22:20.285]  They came back, and those patients were able to accurately describe exactly what was said in the room by the doctors.
[03:22:20.285 --> 03:22:23.207]  They were able to describe everything that was happening around them.
[03:22:23.207 --> 03:22:32.434]  They had accurate memories of the feeling, what was, you know, how they were being poked, what was happening with the CPR, for example.
[03:22:32.434 --> 03:22:38.438]  They knew exactly what was going on, and they were able to relate that accurately to researchers after their official, quote, death.
[03:22:39.346 --> 03:22:47.748]  What this means is that if you are an organ donor, and I understand that maybe you want to help people.
[03:22:47.748 --> 03:22:51.088]  You've been told that this is the compassionate thing to do.
[03:22:51.088 --> 03:22:54.449]  You want to give up your organs to save someone else's life.
[03:22:54.449 --> 03:23:01.290]  Well, I'm here to tell you, you need to rethink exactly that organ harvesting industry.
[03:23:01.290 --> 03:23:05.471]  Because I guarantee you, the surgeons and the doctors and the hospitals are not doing that for free.
[03:23:05.471 --> 03:23:08.552]  They're taking your organs and they're not paying you a dime.
[03:23:09.252 --> 03:23:21.218]  And then they're making potentially millions of dollars off of your tissue and your organs, and they're even motivated to harvest your organs out of your body before you're actually unconscious, before you're actually dead.
[03:23:21.218 --> 03:23:26.921]  And they actually have a financial motivation to declare you dead before you're naturally dead.
[03:23:26.921 --> 03:23:28.322]  There's a motivation.
[03:23:28.322 --> 03:23:32.064]  And they don't want your organs to not have oxygen.
[03:23:33.064 --> 03:23:40.890]  So the minute your heart stops beating, or sometimes, according to some accusations, even before your heart stops beating, they start harvesting.
[03:23:40.890 --> 03:23:44.513]  They cut right into you, they crack your sternum open, and they rip your heart out, literally.
[03:23:44.513 --> 03:23:48.836]  This is literally what they do, because there's money in it for them.
[03:23:49.719 --> 03:24:00.288]  And they make millions of dollars off the pharmaceuticals, the lifelong doctor visits, all the emergency surgery, the transportation of your organ, all of this.
[03:24:00.288 --> 03:24:10.477]  They make all of this money and don't pay your family a dime and they might make you suffer as they're pulling organs out of your body while you're conscious and aware.
[03:24:10.477 --> 03:24:13.920]  This is a big scam by the medical industry.
[03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:16.343]  They claim that you're dead the minute your heartbeat stops.
[03:24:17.026 --> 03:24:24.270]  Even though your consciousness continues to exist, and they're covering this up because it feeds into their organ harvesting industry.
[03:24:24.270 --> 03:24:32.314]  Note that there are hospitals and universities across America who have been caught in the black market organ trade.
[03:24:32.314 --> 03:24:43.259]  There's a book that I've shown before, I think it's called The Red Market, and it's about blood farming and child trafficking and organ harvesting and the black market of organ trade.
[03:24:44.053 --> 03:24:49.217]  And how they get kidneys and they get livers and they get other body parts through the black market.
[03:24:49.217 --> 03:24:54.140]  And this is a global trade and there's almost no mention of it in the medical system.
[03:24:54.140 --> 03:24:57.422]  It's the dirty little secret of big medicine.
[03:24:57.422 --> 03:25:02.346]  And the organ harvesting that happens when you're not really dead is part of this.
[03:25:02.346 --> 03:25:03.947]  That's how they get the organs from you.
[03:25:03.947 --> 03:25:11.432]  I mean, look, if you thought that abortion was the only evil thing that the medical industry does,
[03:25:12.256 --> 03:25:14.858]  You're way off base.
[03:25:14.858 --> 03:25:17.040]  There's so much more evil that they do.
[03:25:17.040 --> 03:25:26.668]  But remember, we know, this has been openly admitted by the abortion industry, that they harvest organs from babies that are partially born, right?
[03:25:26.668 --> 03:25:29.411]  It's called partial birth abortions.
[03:25:29.411 --> 03:25:32.934]  And again, I'm not trying to be graphic here, but to accurately describe this, they
[03:25:33.604 --> 03:25:42.151]  They have this baby, partially born, the head emerges, and then they murder that baby with a scalpel at the back of the skull.
[03:25:42.151 --> 03:25:46.054]  Excuse me, it almost makes me sick talking about this.
[03:25:46.054 --> 03:25:48.816]  They murder that baby and then they harvest the organs.
[03:25:48.816 --> 03:25:53.820]  They harvest the skull, the brain tissue, neurological tissue, they harvest other tissues.
[03:25:53.820 --> 03:25:57.983]  They chop that baby up and then they sell that off to biotech companies and vaccine companies.
[03:25:58.829 --> 03:26:04.611]  To do research and to grow tissue and organs that can be used to put into other vaccines.
[03:26:04.611 --> 03:26:07.852]  That's why vaccines contain aborted human fetal tissue.
[03:26:07.852 --> 03:26:09.352]  This is openly admitted.
[03:26:09.352 --> 03:26:12.393]  It's listed as an ingredient by the CDC and the FDA.
[03:26:12.393 --> 03:26:13.493]  It's well documented.
[03:26:13.493 --> 03:26:16.474]  The only people who don't know that are just people who are ignorant.
[03:26:16.474 --> 03:26:17.775]  It's not debated.
[03:26:17.775 --> 03:26:18.615]  There is no debate.
[03:26:18.615 --> 03:26:20.095]  It's listed on the ingredients, okay?
[03:26:20.095 --> 03:26:21.956]  It's right on the insert sheets.
[03:26:21.956 --> 03:26:23.937]  Aborted human fetal tissue strains.
[03:26:23.937 --> 03:26:25.177]  Cell lines.
[03:26:25.177 --> 03:26:27.998]  From aborted human babies.
[03:26:27.998 --> 03:26:28.258]  And now,
[03:26:30.520 --> 03:26:32.841]  There's a new story here.
[03:26:32.841 --> 03:26:33.921]  This is even incredible.
[03:26:33.921 --> 03:26:55.110]  So in, you know how we have the heartbeat bill that was passed in, I believe this was in Iowa, and the heartbeat bill, oh, I'm sorry, it's Ohio, excuse me, heartbeat bill makes it so that you can't abort babies after they have a heartbeat that's detectable because they're alive.
[03:26:55.896 --> 03:27:15.530]  And so this heartbeat bill has been passed into law, but a Democrat named Representative Janine Boyd tried to push an amendment to this bill that would exempt black babies from the protections of the heartbeat bill because they want to murder more black babies.
[03:27:15.530 --> 03:27:23.516]  So that what this amendment was trying to say is that, okay, you can't, you can't abort white babies and other color, other races of babies, but
[03:27:24.122 --> 03:27:30.445]  You can selectively abort black babies up to the next limit of however long that is.
[03:27:30.445 --> 03:27:32.006]  I think it was 20 weeks.
[03:27:32.006 --> 03:27:37.029]  But black babies in particular should not be protected when they have a heartbeat.
[03:27:37.029 --> 03:27:44.153]  In other words, these Democrat lawmakers, they want to murder black babies that have heartbeats.
[03:27:44.153 --> 03:27:45.613]  And now, I mean, step back for a minute.
[03:27:45.613 --> 03:27:47.094]  Let's put all this together.
[03:27:47.094 --> 03:27:52.097]  We're talking about an organ harvesting industry that rips the organs out of your body while you're conscious.
[03:27:52.639 --> 03:28:01.226]  We're talking about an abortion industry that feeds on dead black babies who are ripped apart even after they have a heartbeat.
[03:28:01.226 --> 03:28:10.054]  And lawmakers in Ohio saying that they should have a special amendment to make sure that black babies can be killed even after they have a heartbeat.
[03:28:10.054 --> 03:28:11.976]  This is sick stuff, people!
[03:28:11.976 --> 03:28:18.201]  We're talking about the rise of intense demonic evil across the medical industry.
[03:28:18.201 --> 03:28:19.322]  Evil has infested
[03:28:20.322 --> 03:28:25.844]  Our culture, our civilization, at every level, and these people aren't even hiding it anymore.
[03:28:25.844 --> 03:28:33.286]  The pedophiles, the child traffickers, the murderers, the eugenicists, the organ harvesters and organ trade traffickers, they're not hiding it anymore.
[03:28:33.286 --> 03:28:34.887]  It's out in the open.
[03:28:34.887 --> 03:28:38.488]  And that's why we speak out here on InfoWars.
[03:28:38.488 --> 03:28:40.288]  Because we have to sound the alarm.
[03:28:40.288 --> 03:28:46.130]  We have to stop this evil from sacrificing even more lives of all babies of all colors and races.
[03:28:46.130 --> 03:28:47.190]  Stay with us.
[03:28:47.190 --> 03:28:48.711]  We'll have more straight ahead here on InfoWars.
[03:28:53.131 --> 03:28:56.713]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.713 --> 03:29:00.294]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.294 --> 03:29:02.415]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:29:54.435 --> 03:29:57.516]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[03:29:57.516 --> 03:30:00.437]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:30:00.437 --> 03:30:03.397]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[03:30:03.397 --> 03:30:07.518]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of MyPatriot Supply.
[03:30:07.518 --> 03:30:07.958]  We're the top
[03:30:09.011 --> 03:30:18.155]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[03:30:34.763 --> 03:30:36.964]  They've got so many great products there.

[03:30:38.525 --> 03:30:40.506]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[03:30:40.506 --> 03:30:43.027]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.

[03:30:54.721 --> 03:31:04.411]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[03:31:04.411 --> 03:31:10.878]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[03:31:10.878 --> 03:31:12.380]  Then they set the precedent.
[03:31:12.380 --> 03:31:16.524]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[03:31:17.245 --> 03:31:18.706]  They take you off the Internet.
[03:31:18.706 --> 03:31:29.515]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform, because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[03:31:29.515 --> 03:31:40.344]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist, anti-human, transhumanists, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[03:31:40.344 --> 03:31:42.026]  And if we keep bowing to these cults,
[03:31:42.606 --> 03:31:49.068]  The cancer that is San Francisco and many of these big universities is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[03:31:49.068 --> 03:31:54.209]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks!
[03:31:54.209 --> 03:32:06.472]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most oppressed.
[03:32:07.597 --> 03:32:19.966]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[03:32:19.966 --> 03:32:21.887]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:32:21.887 --> 03:32:24.569]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:32:25.913 --> 03:32:30.255]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:32:30.255 --> 03:32:36.797]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:32:36.797 --> 03:32:39.118]  This country is in a war!
[03:32:39.118 --> 03:32:49.822]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:32:49.822 --> 03:32:53.403]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[03:32:57.217 --> 03:33:10.342]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:10.342 --> 03:33:17.045]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:17.045 --> 03:33:19.366]  It's Mike Adams.
[03:33:19.366 --> 03:33:24.187]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.187 --> 03:33:25.428]  I know that was a pretty heavy segment.
[03:33:26.306 --> 03:33:28.507]  I just presented there about organ harvesting.
[03:33:28.507 --> 03:33:30.369]  It's all true.
[03:33:30.369 --> 03:33:38.154]  It's perhaps more graphic than what you wanted to get into, but I'm not here to protect you from reality.
[03:33:38.154 --> 03:33:44.798]  I'm here to show you what's actually happening and how you want to deal with that is, of course, your choice.
[03:33:44.798 --> 03:33:49.601]  But I assume that everybody listening to the show is not a snowflake.
[03:33:50.171 --> 03:33:52.733]  You're not some cry bully, fragile person.
[03:33:52.733 --> 03:33:54.415]  Otherwise, you wouldn't be watching this.
[03:33:54.415 --> 03:33:55.335]  You want to be informed.
[03:33:55.335 --> 03:33:56.677]  You want to know the truth.
[03:33:56.677 --> 03:34:00.680]  So that's why we present this to you just straight out, unfiltered, uncensored.
[03:34:00.680 --> 03:34:01.661]  And that's why I'm here.
[03:34:01.661 --> 03:34:06.325]  That's why I think Alex continues to invite me to host the show from time to time.
[03:34:06.325 --> 03:34:09.667]  Seems like every week on the current schedule, which is great.
[03:34:09.667 --> 03:34:11.109]  I really enjoy doing it.
[03:34:11.109 --> 03:34:13.351]  But just a bit of a positive note in all of this.
[03:34:13.351 --> 03:34:18.495]  If you want to keep your organs healthy and never need an organ transplant yourself,
[03:34:19.218 --> 03:34:32.805]  You should know that most people, but not all people, most people who are on organ transplant lists, they need a transplant because they led a lifestyle that destroyed the organs that God gave them.
[03:34:32.805 --> 03:34:35.206]  I know it's not politically correct to say that, but it's true.
[03:34:35.206 --> 03:34:41.730]  And if you want to avoid ever needing an organ transplant, protect the organs you were born with.
[03:34:41.730 --> 03:34:42.690]  Protect what you have.
[03:34:42.690 --> 03:34:43.591]  And how do you do that?
[03:34:43.591 --> 03:34:45.832]  Well, you avoid exposure to toxins.
[03:34:46.776 --> 03:34:50.379]  And, you know, you use nutrition and superfoods.
[03:34:50.379 --> 03:34:53.781]  I mean, InfowarStore.com, no joke.
[03:34:53.781 --> 03:34:59.665]  Many of the molecules found in many of the supplements that are offered there, you know, various specials from time to time.
[03:34:59.665 --> 03:35:04.468]  I don't know what the current specials are, but they've always got something on special there.
[03:35:04.468 --> 03:35:06.470]  Those molecules are protective.
[03:35:07.245 --> 03:35:08.066]  It's incredible.
[03:35:08.066 --> 03:35:14.412]  Just turmeric alone is one of the most, in my view, one of the most miraculous substances that's ever been found in nature.
[03:35:14.412 --> 03:35:16.594]  I drink turmeric every day.
[03:35:16.594 --> 03:35:20.798]  I actually put a big heaping spoon of turmeric powder in my smoothie.
[03:35:21.841 --> 03:35:23.362]  And, you know, a lot of people can't handle that taste.
[03:35:23.362 --> 03:35:24.563]  It's like, whoa, that's strong.
[03:35:24.563 --> 03:35:26.324]  That's this weird orange powder.
[03:35:26.324 --> 03:35:27.625]  Well, take it in a capsule.
[03:35:27.625 --> 03:35:29.306]  Take it in a liquid format.
[03:35:29.306 --> 03:35:34.110]  I think InfoWars has bodies, lots of different formats you can choose from, I think.
[03:35:34.110 --> 03:35:36.591]  So, you know, protect the organs you have.
[03:35:36.591 --> 03:35:37.952]  Protect your health.
[03:35:37.952 --> 03:35:38.613]  Use nutrition.
[03:35:39.193 --> 03:35:45.816]  God put molecules all over this earth, in the plants, in the rainforest, in the oceans.
[03:35:45.816 --> 03:35:52.759]  The molecules that your body needs to avoid disease, avoid heart attacks, avoid strokes, avoid liver damage.
[03:35:52.759 --> 03:35:55.460]  You just have to take advantage of those molecules that are out there, really.
[03:35:55.460 --> 03:35:58.021]  And you're not going to get that.
[03:35:58.021 --> 03:36:00.562]  I mean, pharmaceuticals aren't your solution.
[03:36:00.562 --> 03:36:01.242]  Trust me.
[03:36:01.242 --> 03:36:03.723]  Pharmaceuticals are going to damage your liver, damage your heart.
[03:36:03.723 --> 03:36:05.184]  They're going to damage your kidneys.
[03:36:05.871 --> 03:36:08.313]  You know why people need kidney transplants in many cases?
[03:36:08.313 --> 03:36:11.637]  Because they were damaged by the mercury in vaccines.
[03:36:11.637 --> 03:36:13.599]  Mercury damages kidneys.
[03:36:13.599 --> 03:36:20.585]  If not for vaccines, the dialysis centers across America would practically collapse from a lack of customers.
[03:36:20.585 --> 03:36:25.030]  It's the vaccines that keep the repeat business going for the kidney dialysis centers.
[03:36:25.888 --> 03:36:32.512]  You know, it's the diabetes drugs that cause the liver damage that promotes the liver transplant industry.
[03:36:32.512 --> 03:36:38.595]  It's the statin drugs that cause the metabolic disorders that lead to type 2 diabetes that promote the diabetes industry.
[03:36:38.595 --> 03:36:40.676]  It just goes on and on and on.
[03:36:40.676 --> 03:36:47.039]  It's the toxic chemicals in the cosmetic products out there that cause cancer, that promote the cancer industry.
[03:36:47.039 --> 03:36:50.221]  And the cancer industry, all of its treatments spread cancer.
[03:36:50.954 --> 03:36:54.035]  Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.
[03:36:54.035 --> 03:36:56.676]  Well, surgery spreads the tumors physically.
[03:36:56.676 --> 03:37:00.497]  Radiation causes cancer because it's ionizing radiation.
[03:37:00.497 --> 03:37:07.419]  And chemotherapy causes cancer to spread because it doesn't kill the actual stem cells of the cancer tumors.
[03:37:07.419 --> 03:37:10.780]  It shrinks tumors temporarily, and then they come back stronger than ever.
[03:37:10.780 --> 03:37:12.500]  Chemotherapy causes cancer.
[03:37:12.500 --> 03:37:14.061]  It's the number one side effect of chemotherapy.
[03:37:14.764 --> 03:37:22.665]  If you want to stop that cycle of toxic pharmaceuticals, turn to nutrition and superfoods and stop eating poison.
[03:37:22.665 --> 03:37:25.266]  You know, it's really, it's actually very simple.
[03:37:25.266 --> 03:37:31.087]  And stop exposing yourself to toxic heavy metals and toxic pesticides, herbicides, glyphosate, all of that.
[03:37:31.087 --> 03:37:33.147]  I just want to give you that important note.
[03:37:33.147 --> 03:37:37.388]  You have control over your health more than anybody else.
[03:37:37.388 --> 03:37:41.609]  And, you know, Bernie Sanders can go out there and push socialized medicine and say the government should be in charge of your health.
[03:37:42.412 --> 03:37:43.352]  Nonsense.
[03:37:43.352 --> 03:37:46.033]  No one is in charge of your health other than you.
[03:37:46.033 --> 03:37:47.294]  Not even your doctor.
[03:37:47.294 --> 03:38:01.439]  Your doctor can't control what you eat, what you choose not to eat, what level of exercise you have versus a sedentary lifestyle, whether you choose to have some sunshine and some vitamin D or you want to live a life deficient in vitamin D and just grow cancer tumors all day long.
[03:38:01.439 --> 03:38:02.640]  That's your choice.
[03:38:02.640 --> 03:38:03.780]  Doctor can't control you.
[03:38:03.780 --> 03:38:05.381]  It's your choice.
[03:38:05.381 --> 03:38:06.101]  It's your body.
[03:38:06.101 --> 03:38:06.862]  Protect it.
[03:38:06.862 --> 03:38:09.563]  It's the one God gave you.
[03:38:09.563 --> 03:38:10.343]  In fact, I wish that
[03:38:11.328 --> 03:38:14.129]  I don't know why churches don't teach this more.
[03:38:14.129 --> 03:38:18.570]  You know, so many of our churches have just lost their way on so many issues.
[03:38:18.570 --> 03:38:19.210]  You've seen that.
[03:38:19.210 --> 03:38:21.290]  They're just preaching obedience now.
[03:38:21.290 --> 03:38:23.851]  You should be obedient to government, you know.
[03:38:23.851 --> 03:38:24.511]  What is it, Romans 13?
[03:38:24.511 --> 03:38:27.912]  The churches are way off base.
[03:38:27.912 --> 03:38:33.693]  So they'll have this sermon about how you're a divine being and then they'll serve, you know, donuts and soda.
[03:38:35.222 --> 03:38:35.882]  You know what?
[03:38:35.882 --> 03:38:39.265]  God doesn't want you to eat junk food and kill your body.
[03:38:39.265 --> 03:38:42.187]  If your body is divine, you should treat it like a temple.
[03:38:42.187 --> 03:38:43.568]  You should protect it.
[03:38:43.568 --> 03:38:48.131]  And that's with good nutrition and good exercise and avoiding toxic chemicals, all these things.
[03:38:48.131 --> 03:38:52.154]  I just wanted to put that note out there because this is important.
[03:38:52.154 --> 03:38:53.695]  Churches should improve their nutrition.
[03:38:53.695 --> 03:38:55.436]  All right.
[03:38:55.436 --> 03:39:02.381]  I just finished a CounterThink episode that's going to air this Sunday at InfoWars.com, 6 p.m.
[03:39:02.381 --> 03:39:02.661]  Central.
[03:39:03.425 --> 03:39:05.846]  And as you know, I do one CounterThink episode every week.
[03:39:05.846 --> 03:39:08.546]  This week, in particular, is a really important episode.
[03:39:08.546 --> 03:39:11.967]  It's called the Annihilation Agenda.
[03:39:11.967 --> 03:39:14.888]  This is one of the last CounterThink episodes that I'm doing.
[03:39:14.888 --> 03:39:17.649]  I'm only doing three more.
[03:39:17.649 --> 03:39:27.472]  I'm ending CounterThink after three more episodes because I'm launching something new about forensic food science that's going to replace it.
[03:39:27.472 --> 03:39:31.173]  But this episode, the Annihilation Agenda, details
[03:39:32.085 --> 03:39:50.140]  How everything now, everything, every institution, medicine, science, government, every institution is now focused on the mass depopulation of the planet, the mass murder of human beings, and eliminating six billion people from this planet.
[03:39:50.140 --> 03:39:51.441]  This is the goal.
[03:39:51.441 --> 03:39:55.985]  Everything that you hear in the news now, you can trace it back to this agenda.
[03:39:55.985 --> 03:39:57.807]  They want people to fight with each other.
[03:39:57.807 --> 03:39:58.267]  They want
[03:39:59.418 --> 03:40:01.520]  Whites and blacks to have a civil war.
[03:40:01.520 --> 03:40:03.981]  They want to unleash mass hatred.
[03:40:03.981 --> 03:40:06.763]  This is the whole job of MSNBC and CNN.
[03:40:06.763 --> 03:40:17.911]  You might as well just call them the hate media now because their job is to spread hate and cause social chaos and cause a civil war and cause fighting and killing and murder.
[03:40:17.911 --> 03:40:24.055]  While the food is also intentionally poisoned and the medicine is incredibly toxic and they're polluting the skies and the atmosphere.
[03:40:24.918 --> 03:40:34.488]  And they're trying to destroy the rule of law and destroy logic and reason and attacking human biology by saying that men are not men, that men are women too.
[03:40:34.488 --> 03:40:41.376]  This is an attack on creation and it's an attack on human beings, it's an attack on everything.
[03:40:42.205 --> 03:40:44.706]  That our culture, that our civilization has been built on.
[03:40:44.706 --> 03:40:46.706]  But it's all about annihilation.
[03:40:46.706 --> 03:40:47.807]  It is annihilation.
[03:40:47.807 --> 03:40:49.367]  That is the agenda now.
[03:40:49.367 --> 03:40:50.968]  It's beyond depopulation.
[03:40:50.968 --> 03:40:53.048]  It's that they hate humans.
[03:40:53.048 --> 03:40:56.149]  They hate humanity, and they can't wait to destroy humanity.
[03:40:56.149 --> 03:40:58.890]  So, be sure to catch that CounterThink episode.
[03:40:58.890 --> 03:41:05.852]  It's, again, one of the last... Well, there are only three more coming, so it's one of the last four episodes of CounterThink.
[03:41:05.852 --> 03:41:06.833]  Next item.
[03:41:06.833 --> 03:41:07.853]  Important to mention.
[03:41:07.853 --> 03:41:11.014]  Those of you who are long-range target shooters.
[03:41:11.710 --> 03:41:22.475]  Those of you who are SWAT snipers, police officers, or active duty military, I have a major announcement coming up.
[03:41:22.475 --> 03:41:24.075]  I'll probably make this via counterthink.
[03:41:24.075 --> 03:41:26.697]  I, you know, I'm a scientist.
[03:41:26.697 --> 03:41:28.057]  I run a science lab.
[03:41:28.057 --> 03:41:30.298]  I've got a couple of patents in my name.
[03:41:30.298 --> 03:41:32.899]  I'm a published scientist in science papers and so on.
[03:41:32.899 --> 03:41:38.722]  I found a major algorithmic error in all ballistic software.
[03:41:39.514 --> 03:41:45.697]  And this is causing people to miss shots at longer ranges, especially 1,000 yards and beyond.
[03:41:45.697 --> 03:41:54.943]  And I'm going to issue a scientific report and a video that explains the correction for this ballistics error.
[03:41:54.943 --> 03:41:58.124]  And this error has been repeated everywhere.
[03:41:58.124 --> 03:42:08.310]  Everybody that teaches long-range shooting, every ballistics book, every ballistics software, application, wrist device that does ballistics calculations, they're all wrong.
[03:42:09.252 --> 03:42:13.133]  They're wrong in a significant way that will make you miss shots.
[03:42:13.133 --> 03:42:14.893]  I'm going to issue the correction on this.
[03:42:14.893 --> 03:42:17.034]  That's going to be coming up in a few weeks.
[03:42:17.034 --> 03:42:17.834]  I have to film the video.
[03:42:17.834 --> 03:42:18.934]  I have to write the science paper.
[03:42:18.934 --> 03:42:22.055]  I have to prove the math to show people why they're wrong.
[03:42:22.055 --> 03:42:23.695]  It's such a huge, glaring error.
[03:42:23.695 --> 03:42:26.916]  I can't believe nobody caught it before now.
[03:42:26.916 --> 03:42:29.557]  And once you make this correction, you'll be able to make your shots.
[03:42:30.160 --> 03:42:31.361]  And that's the important thing.
[03:42:31.361 --> 03:42:37.346]  Our soldiers overseas are missing shots because the ballistic software has the wrong algorithm.
[03:42:37.346 --> 03:42:38.367]  Bad math.
[03:42:38.367 --> 03:42:41.789]  They don't understand the Pythagorean theorem, it turns out.
[03:42:41.789 --> 03:42:42.690]  We're going to correct that.
[03:42:42.690 --> 03:42:45.612]  I'm going to bring that to you here on InfoWars and CounterThink.
[03:42:45.612 --> 03:42:46.433]  Much more straight ahead.
[03:42:46.433 --> 03:42:47.554]  Mike Adams here.
[03:42:47.554 --> 03:42:48.474]  InfoWars.com.

[03:45:53.871 --> 03:45:56.753]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[03:45:56.753 --> 03:45:58.774]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[03:45:58.774 --> 03:46:01.695]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[03:46:01.695 --> 03:46:05.017]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[03:46:05.017 --> 03:46:08.119]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[03:46:08.119 --> 03:46:09.660]  I didn't invent all this.
[03:46:09.660 --> 03:46:16.223]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[03:46:16.223 --> 03:46:19.025]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[03:46:20.083 --> 03:46:23.426]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[03:46:23.426 --> 03:46:28.051]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[03:46:28.051 --> 03:46:41.605]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[03:46:41.605 --> 03:46:43.546]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[03:46:44.187 --> 03:46:49.449]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[03:46:49.449 --> 03:46:56.692]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[03:46:56.692 --> 03:46:59.333]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.573 --> 03:47:16.856]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:47:16.856 --> 03:47:23.601]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:47:23.601 --> 03:47:32.788]  What do Notre Dame, Sandy Hook, 9-11, Oklahoma City, Waco, Texas, what do these all have in common?
[03:47:32.788 --> 03:47:37.892]  The answer is there's only one official narrative that is allowed to be talked about.
[03:47:38.863 --> 03:47:45.147]  That official narrative is enforced through silencing those who dissent from that point of view.
[03:47:45.147 --> 03:47:59.037]  You saw that on Fox News, how people were being shut down when they tried to talk about maybe there might be arson involved with the burning of Notre Dame in Paris.
[03:47:59.037 --> 03:48:05.001]  There is an official narrative on everything.
[03:48:05.001 --> 03:48:05.141]  Now,
[03:48:05.876 --> 03:48:09.860]  When 9-11 happened, a lot of us asked questions.
[03:48:09.860 --> 03:48:13.583]  We asked reasonable questions, questions that any journalist would ask.
[03:48:13.583 --> 03:48:16.265]  We tried to do the physics, do the math.
[03:48:16.265 --> 03:48:19.008]  We talked to architects and engineers, right?
[03:48:19.008 --> 03:48:22.711]  We looked at what hit the Pentagon.
[03:48:22.711 --> 03:48:30.338]  Why was all the video footage confiscated by the FBI, which we now know is utterly corrupt and dishonest?
[03:48:31.711 --> 03:48:32.512]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:48:32.512 --> 03:48:44.340]  In retrospect, you know, what we know now about the FBI, we should revisit 9-11 big time because we know the FBI has been a deep state, deceptive operation for all these years.
[03:48:44.340 --> 03:48:46.282]  More than two decades, actually.
[03:48:46.282 --> 03:48:49.144]  You know, even through the Clinton years as well.
[03:48:49.144 --> 03:48:57.810]  But I'm not going to go into all the theories about 9-11 here, but just to say that when any event takes place that is so important,
[03:48:58.439 --> 03:49:03.083]  That the official narrative must be enforced at all costs.
[03:49:03.083 --> 03:49:09.368]  You're now starting to see this where the media says we're not going to even entertain comments or questions anymore.
[03:49:09.368 --> 03:49:15.572]  So journalism in the mainstream media has become now the practice of not asking questions.
[03:49:15.572 --> 03:49:16.353]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:49:17.358 --> 03:49:26.085]  Because I thought journalism was about being curious about the world, asking questions, documenting information you get, putting together the story of what you found.
[03:49:26.085 --> 03:49:29.468]  I mean, that's journalism, and that's also science as well.
[03:49:29.468 --> 03:49:38.115]  But when it comes to, hey, why did Building 7 collapse on 9-11 in 2001 when it wasn't hit by an airplane?
[03:49:38.115 --> 03:49:40.477]  How can a building collapse?
[03:49:40.477 --> 03:49:43.239]  Completely collapse, almost perfectly, pancake style.
[03:49:44.338 --> 03:49:45.680]  When it wasn't hit by an airplane.
[03:49:45.680 --> 03:49:48.062]  You know, there were three buildings that collapsed that day.
[03:49:48.062 --> 03:49:49.364]  Not two.
[03:49:49.364 --> 03:49:50.785]  The average American doesn't even know that.
[03:49:50.785 --> 03:49:54.209]  And Tucker Carlson just said, I think last night, he said, it won't be long.
[03:49:54.209 --> 03:49:56.311]  He's talking about all the propaganda and the brainwashing.
[03:49:56.311 --> 03:50:04.721]  I think he said, actually, in 20 years, most Americans will be taught that it was white supremacists that took down the Twin Towers on 9-11.
[03:50:04.721 --> 03:50:05.582]  They won't even know.
[03:50:07.071 --> 03:50:16.616]  That it was terrorism combined with a complicit deep state that ordered the military to stand down because they needed to pass the Patriot Act.
[03:50:16.616 --> 03:50:19.918]  They needed to have surveillance on the American people.
[03:50:19.918 --> 03:50:27.381]  Precisely the surveillance that was used by the Obama administration to spy on Trump campaign officials.
[03:50:27.381 --> 03:50:29.082]  Illegal spying.
[03:50:29.082 --> 03:50:31.563]  So see, understand this.
[03:50:31.563 --> 03:50:34.245]  The powers that Obama used to abuse
[03:50:35.003 --> 03:50:44.811]  The liberties and privacy rights of Trump campaign officials and President Trump himself, those powers were created by Bush, the Bush regime.
[03:50:45.883 --> 03:50:58.888]  And the attacks on 9-11 were necessary to get the advocacy of that law, to sign that Patriot Act that was already pre-written and ready to go to spy on the American people.
[03:50:58.888 --> 03:51:01.429]  And do you remember what we were told at that time?
[03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:06.951]  Oh, these powers will only be used to spy on terrorists, never Americans.
[03:51:06.951 --> 03:51:07.391]  Remember that?
[03:51:08.203 --> 03:51:10.604]  Americans will never be spied on by the government.
[03:51:10.604 --> 03:51:11.324]  Remember that?
[03:51:11.324 --> 03:51:21.088]  Oh, your email isn't being recorded, read, your phone calls aren't being recorded, your TV isn't watching you, your mobile phone isn't tracking you.
[03:51:21.088 --> 03:51:25.269]  All these lies, lie after lie after lie.
[03:51:25.269 --> 03:51:28.851]  You know what all these lies have in common, by the way?
[03:51:28.851 --> 03:51:32.872]  It's that they were exposed by Alex Jones.
[03:51:32.872 --> 03:51:34.813]  They were exposed by InfoWars
[03:51:36.212 --> 03:51:44.115]  Years ahead of them actually emerging as we learn from Edward Snowden and Julian Assange and other, you know, breaking news over the years.
[03:51:44.115 --> 03:51:45.895]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:51:45.895 --> 03:51:58.580]  They attack Alex Jones because he has been right again and again and again about 9-11, about the Patriot Act, about all these events throughout history where we dare to ask questions.
[03:51:58.580 --> 03:52:01.741]  We dare to challenge the official narrative.
[03:52:01.741 --> 03:52:04.302]  That is what InfoWars is really all about.
[03:52:05.228 --> 03:52:10.591]  And this is why InfoWars, it's so important that InfoWars survives this onslaught.
[03:52:10.591 --> 03:52:13.793]  And that InfoWars continues to exist with your support.
[03:52:13.793 --> 03:52:20.777]  Because InfoWars is the platform that dares to engage in real journalism.
[03:52:20.777 --> 03:52:23.919]  There are very few platforms like that in existence today.
[03:52:23.919 --> 03:52:24.640]  Very few.
[03:52:25.672 --> 03:52:29.355]  Project Veritas, James O'Keefe, is a real investigative journalist.
[03:52:29.355 --> 03:52:30.996]  He dares to ask questions.
[03:52:30.996 --> 03:52:33.838]  Sean Hannity, to his credit, is a real journalist.
[03:52:33.838 --> 03:52:36.099]  He dares to ask questions.
[03:52:36.099 --> 03:52:40.643]  My own platform as well, Natural News and all the sites that we run, same thing.
[03:52:40.643 --> 03:52:55.233]  We built these platforms because we are not just day-to-day engaged in the activity of journalism, but because we are, in heart and spirit, real journalists who dare to ask questions, who dare to challenge the establishment.
[03:52:56.303 --> 03:53:04.969]  I mean, we are the ones who actually are working in the spirit of what the left says Watergate was all about, you know, speaking truth to power.
[03:53:04.969 --> 03:53:07.050]  Well, the media today isn't speaking truth to power.
[03:53:07.050 --> 03:53:11.673]  They're covering up truth and consolidating power and lying to their people.
[03:53:11.673 --> 03:53:13.114]  That's what CNN does every day.
[03:53:13.114 --> 03:53:16.096]  And there are a lot of signs that Fox News is going in that direction.
[03:53:16.096 --> 03:53:24.621]  A certain part of Fox News, you know, not the Sean Hannity part, but not Tucker Carlson, but other parts of Fox News, like Shep,
[03:53:25.476 --> 03:53:31.460]  As becoming really a dishonest propagandist, and in my opinion, he needs to go.
[03:53:31.460 --> 03:53:39.265]  But with that said, I wanted to add something that Alex said earlier before, you know, in the opening segment of this hour.
[03:53:39.265 --> 03:53:42.987]  Alex said that he's not going to hire people anymore who work in the swamp.
[03:53:42.987 --> 03:53:44.388]  Nobody out of Washington, D.C.
[03:53:44.388 --> 03:53:45.249]  anymore.
[03:53:45.249 --> 03:53:46.990]  And I agree with him.
[03:53:46.990 --> 03:53:53.254]  I think for both our organizations, we have to focus on attracting and hiring real people.
[03:53:53.254 --> 03:53:54.695]  Real people who live in the real world.
[03:53:55.330 --> 03:54:01.256]  Not these fake artificial constructs that they have in Washington, D.C.
[03:54:01.256 --> 03:54:03.638]  It is honest-to-God truth.
[03:54:03.638 --> 03:54:11.066]  What I did this morning is what a real person living in Central Texas does on a day-to-day basis.
[03:54:11.066 --> 03:54:12.888]  This morning, I was walking out to my barn.
[03:54:13.974 --> 03:54:17.877]  I found a rat snake crawling across the hay that I have there trying to get some eggs.
[03:54:17.877 --> 03:54:21.200]  So I captured the rat snake, relocated that snake.
[03:54:21.200 --> 03:54:22.301]  Did that this morning.
[03:54:22.301 --> 03:54:23.922]  Ran my John Deere tractor this morning.
[03:54:23.922 --> 03:54:28.867]  I had to move a giant barrel of some dirt around.
[03:54:28.867 --> 03:54:30.048]  So I was out running the tractor.
[03:54:30.048 --> 03:54:30.848]  I was out capturing snakes.
[03:54:30.848 --> 03:54:32.730]  I have a sick chicken right now that I'm taking care of.
[03:54:33.422 --> 03:54:34.642]  The sick chicken's doing better.
[03:54:34.642 --> 03:54:42.225]  I treated that chicken with colloidal silver and essential oils in the water and gave it some good food, separated it from the rest of the flock.
[03:54:42.225 --> 03:54:49.527]  I take care of animals, you know, I take care of donkeys and goats and we are real people who deal with the real world.
[03:54:49.527 --> 03:54:59.350]  I was sighting in a rifle, I think it was two days ago, 300 Win Mag rifle, sighted that in, entered all the ballistics, got the muzzle velocity on my radar system.
[03:55:00.431 --> 03:55:02.973]  Got the ballistic solution for that for long-range shooting.
[03:55:02.973 --> 03:55:06.276]  You know, I'm a real guy just like Alex Jones is a real guy.
[03:55:06.276 --> 03:55:07.797]  We live in the real world.
[03:55:07.797 --> 03:55:11.580]  We do stuff with our hands and our minds.
[03:55:11.580 --> 03:55:17.726]  This is why we dare to be real journalists because we see the reality out here.
[03:55:17.726 --> 03:55:22.710]  We see how people are hurting out here in Texas because they're being ordered what to do by the federal government.
[03:55:23.419 --> 03:55:28.863]  We see the open borders problem, how it's affecting people out here in the real world.
[03:55:28.863 --> 03:55:36.848]  We see the opioid problem, the drug addiction problem that happens because of the open borders and how they're bringing in all these illegal drugs.
[03:55:36.848 --> 03:55:38.309]  We see it face-to-face.
[03:55:38.309 --> 03:55:39.810]  We talk to people.
[03:55:39.810 --> 03:55:41.971]  You know, I hire a lot of people like Alex does.
[03:55:41.971 --> 03:55:47.855]  We talk to our employees and their family members and we see what's happening and we hear the stories.
[03:55:47.855 --> 03:55:48.876]  People are suffering out here.
[03:55:49.685 --> 03:55:54.928]  In real America, it's the part of America that the elitists in Washington want to forget.
[03:55:54.928 --> 03:55:57.029]  And this is why we elected Trump.
[03:55:57.029 --> 03:56:14.638]  And this is why we're going to reelect Trump in 2020, because real America is tired of being ruled over by a bunch of elitist snobs who have never got their hands dirty, who have never done anything in the real world, never changed a tire, never changed the oil on a vehicle, never took care of a real living animal before.
[03:56:15.615 --> 03:56:17.716]  They're afraid of grass and pasture.
[03:56:17.716 --> 03:56:23.397]  They're afraid of the real world because they're in their palaces in Washington, D.C.
[03:56:23.397 --> 03:56:34.500]  living as parasites off the American people, confiscating your money and wanting to take away your guns so that they can rule over you with an iron fist with their authoritarian regimes.
[03:56:34.500 --> 03:56:36.701]  Enough of that, I say.
[03:56:36.701 --> 03:56:40.002]  We, the American people, are going to stand up for real America.
[03:56:40.002 --> 03:56:41.142]  We're going to protect our borders.
[03:56:42.216 --> 03:56:43.797]  We're going to protect our individual liberties.
[03:56:43.797 --> 03:56:44.998]  We're going to keep our guns.
[03:56:44.998 --> 03:56:46.619]  We're not turning in our magazines.
[03:56:46.619 --> 03:56:49.501]  We're not turning in our rifles and our ARs.
[03:56:49.501 --> 03:56:49.922]  No way.
[03:56:49.922 --> 03:56:52.103]  We're not turning them in to you ever.
[03:56:52.103 --> 03:56:52.604]  Ever.
[03:56:52.604 --> 03:56:57.287]  All you bureaucrats in New Jersey and Oregon and Washington and California and Colorado.
[03:56:57.287 --> 03:56:58.648]  You can pass all the laws you want.
[03:56:58.648 --> 03:56:59.489]  Guess what?
[03:56:59.489 --> 03:57:01.170]  Your laws are unconstitutional.
[03:57:01.170 --> 03:57:02.271]  We're not giving you our guns.
[03:57:02.271 --> 03:57:03.872]  We're not giving you our magazines.
[03:57:03.872 --> 03:57:05.333]  And we're not giving up our country.
[03:57:05.333 --> 03:57:10.137]  Just because you want open borders and you hate America, that means you need to leave.
[03:57:10.137 --> 03:57:11.378]  You need to be removed from power.
[03:57:12.250 --> 03:57:16.754]  You need to be defeated politically in every way possible.
[03:57:16.754 --> 03:57:22.518]  That's the truth that you're going to continue to get here at InfoWars.com and on my website, NaturalNews.com.
[03:57:22.518 --> 03:57:30.704]  From all of us who are real Americans, and in my case, you know, real Texan here, we're fighting for America, we're fighting for individual liberty, and we're doing it with this platform.
[03:57:30.704 --> 03:57:31.605]  We need your support.

[03:58:45.379 --> 03:58:46.820]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[03:58:46.820 --> 03:58:48.722]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[03:58:48.722 --> 03:58:49.322]  It is!
[03:58:49.322 --> 03:58:50.904]  But if you took it with fish oil...
[03:58:52.152 --> 03:58:53.693]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[03:59:11.544 --> 03:59:12.385]  He's the best.
[03:59:12.385 --> 03:59:13.746]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:59:13.746 --> 03:59:14.607]  And I'm sorry.
[03:59:14.607 --> 03:59:15.588]  You want something like this?
[03:59:15.588 --> 03:59:16.568]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:59:16.568 --> 03:59:18.490]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:59:18.490 --> 03:59:19.091]  It's so good.
[03:59:19.091 --> 03:59:19.711]  In my view.
[03:59:19.711 --> 03:59:21.933]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:59:21.933 --> 03:59:28.139]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:59:28.139 --> 03:59:32.683]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:59:35.646 --> 03:59:41.671]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:59:41.671 --> 03:59:47.696]  I just can't do it!
[03:59:47.696 --> 03:59:50.299]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
