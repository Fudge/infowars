[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Remember a few years ago, the New York Times said Agenda 21 doesn't exist.
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.800]  Agenda 2030 doesn't exist.
[00:14.800 --> 00:20.840]  So Trudeau goes out in a governmental announcement and says we're implementing Agenda 2030.
[00:20.840 --> 00:21.840]  Here it is.
[00:21.840 --> 00:26.120]  Building back better means getting support to the most vulnerable while maintaining
[00:26.120 --> 00:32.360]  our momentum on reaching the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and the SDGs.
[00:32.360 --> 00:35.240]  Canada is here to listen and to help.
[00:35.240 --> 00:39.240]  This pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset.
[00:39.240 --> 00:44.680]  This is our chance to accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems that
[00:44.680 --> 00:50.840]  actually address global challenges like extreme poverty, inequality and climate change.
[00:50.840 --> 00:56.640]  Build back better and I'm looking forward to getting started as soon as we can.
[00:56.640 --> 01:05.640]  At the end what the forced industrial revolution will lead to is a fusion of our physical,
[01:05.640 --> 01:11.920]  our digital and our biological identities.
[01:11.920 --> 01:15.920]  All these different UN combines and agreements don't exist.
[01:15.920 --> 01:25.400]  We can go look them up and find out they do exist.
[01:25.400 --> 01:31.160]  In the year 2015, the world agreed on the ambitious, inclusive and universal sustainable
[01:31.160 --> 01:35.560]  development goals, making a commitment to leave no one behind.
[01:35.560 --> 01:43.040]  It is so exciting.
[01:43.040 --> 01:48.800]  Just a few months later, we are already seeing those promises transform into first concrete
[01:48.800 --> 01:50.800]  steps for action.
[01:50.800 --> 01:55.600]  On 21st of April, presidents, prime ministers and other high-level representatives from
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.120]  around the world gathered at the UN headquarters in New York for a high-level debate on achieving
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.120]  the SDGs, now that the goals and targets have been set.
[02:05.120 --> 02:07.840]  We have no time to waste.
[02:07.840 --> 02:13.840]  We need first to take seriously the goals because these are the world's goals, they're
[02:13.840 --> 02:16.680]  the only goals we're going to have for our generation.
[02:16.680 --> 02:21.240]  The agenda 2030 is going a step further because it recognizes that things need to change here
[02:21.240 --> 02:23.080]  in the rich countries as well.
[02:23.080 --> 02:28.680]  There's obligations for rich countries, too, in terms of environmental pollution, you know,
[02:28.680 --> 02:34.680]  our production and consumption patterns that are destructive for the planet, tax policies
[02:34.680 --> 02:40.600]  that are creating inequalities, illicit financial flows, all these things, and finally some
[02:40.600 --> 02:45.840]  very concrete language on governance, on democracy and all that.
[02:45.840 --> 02:53.240]  We will now start a quite high number of task forces to look at all the different issues
[02:53.240 --> 02:59.320]  and we will present all those ideas to the people assembled in Davos, but at the same
[02:59.320 --> 03:06.760]  time we will make Davos very different, very open to ensure that we do not fall back to
[03:06.760 --> 03:13.680]  old recipes, but that we really look at forward-oriented solutions.
[03:13.680 --> 03:18.600]  We have a unique but rapidly shrinking window of opportunity to learn lessons and reset
[03:18.600 --> 03:21.520]  ourselves on a more sustainable path.
[03:21.520 --> 03:27.640]  It is an opportunity we have never had before or may never have again, so we must use all
[03:27.640 --> 03:31.800]  the levers we have at our disposal knowing that each and every one of us has a vital
[03:31.800 --> 03:33.360]  role to play.
[03:33.360 --> 03:42.600]  Now is the time to think what history would say about this crisis, and now is the time
[03:42.600 --> 03:47.360]  for all of us to define our own role.
[03:47.360 --> 03:55.240]  What is it that would make it so that history would look at this crisis as the great opportunity?
[03:55.240 --> 04:01.280]  But it is a big corporation saying we are going to shut down the world economy, consolidate
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.880]  it for the ultra-wretch and tell people we are doing it to save the earth because carbon
[04:06.880 --> 04:12.720]  is evil, even though all life on this planet is carbon-based.
[04:12.720 --> 04:20.760]  So agenda 21 has been going on for 30-something years, since 1992 in Rio de Janeiro when it
[04:20.760 --> 04:27.080]  became world law under George Herbert Walker Bush, and then five years ago they passed
[04:27.080 --> 04:31.200]  at the UN, we didn't agree to it but they still did it.
[04:31.200 --> 04:39.280]  In just two months the world has an opportunity to unite around a strong global agreement.
[04:39.280 --> 04:43.920]  Obama said he agreed it, the Senate didn't go along with it, agenda 2030 you should go
[04:43.920 --> 04:49.480]  read it for yourself, and then everything they say that they are doing, they are doing
[04:49.480 --> 04:51.160]  the opposite.
[05:19.480 --> 05:46.280]  I want to thank you all for your support, I want to ask you to re-double your ever to
[05:46.280 --> 05:50.320]  spread the word, I want to ask you to buy the products, then forestore.com today, because
[05:50.320 --> 05:51.320]  without you won't be on the air.
[05:51.320 --> 05:56.280]  Again, I salute you and thank you all, the toll-free numbers, triple A, 253-3139, please
[05:56.280 --> 06:09.360]  take action today in our emergency cellar.
[06:09.360 --> 06:16.440]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny?
[06:16.440 --> 06:22.720]  Well so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:22.720 --> 06:33.600]  It is now day 64 of the 79 days of hell, communist China and its new world allies are desperately
[06:33.600 --> 06:38.000]  trying to overthrow the election of President Trump.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.720]  Joe Biden has illegally declared himself the victor in violation of federal law and his
[06:41.720 --> 06:43.220]  own promises.
[06:43.220 --> 06:47.680]  The enemy of the American people, the corporate establishment press is in total panic mode
[06:47.680 --> 06:51.720]  because almost no one is buying their lies and disinformation.
[06:51.720 --> 06:55.800]  And now, the main line Republican party has awoken to the truth of the new world order
[06:55.800 --> 07:03.760]  and world government, and Tucker Carlson is a fancier, more well-produced version of Infowars.
[07:03.760 --> 07:08.880]  Not because Tucker Carlson is copying yours truly, but because the world has awoken.
[07:08.880 --> 07:13.640]  Yes, the enemy is striking back hard, but my friends, when it comes to the culture war,
[07:13.640 --> 07:18.520]  when it comes to recognizing the UN and its true aim of world government depopulation,
[07:18.520 --> 07:20.640]  we are winning.
[07:20.640 --> 07:26.400]  This pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset.
[07:26.400 --> 07:31.800]  This is our chance to accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems that
[07:31.800 --> 07:37.800]  actually address global challenges like extreme poverty, inequality, and climate change.
[07:37.800 --> 07:42.200]  Oh, this is our chance, says Justin Trudeau.
[07:42.200 --> 07:47.680]  Not our chance to save you from a virus with a 99% survival rate, you'll almost certainly
[07:47.680 --> 07:50.680]  be fine, and they're fully aware of that.
[07:50.680 --> 07:56.160]  This is our chance to impose totally unprecedented social controls on the population in order
[07:56.160 --> 08:00.920]  to bypass democracy and change everything to conform with their weird academic theories
[08:00.920 --> 08:05.000]  that have never been tested in the real world, and by the way, don't actually make sense.
[08:05.000 --> 08:06.160]  This is their chance.
[08:06.160 --> 08:12.320]  Quote, this pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset, end quote.
[08:12.320 --> 08:17.480]  Keep in mind that's not from QAnon, that is a head of state talking.
[08:17.480 --> 08:18.920]  And he's not alone.
[08:18.920 --> 08:21.480]  Klaus Schwab is the founder of the World Economic Forum.
[08:21.480 --> 08:25.800]  Schwab has written a book called COVID-19, The Great Reset.
[08:25.800 --> 08:28.920]  The book isn't really about science or medicine.
[08:28.920 --> 08:29.920]  No.
[08:29.920 --> 08:34.800]  But it describes, quote, what changes will be needed to create a more inclusive, resilient,
[08:34.800 --> 08:38.360]  and sustainable world going forward, end quote.
[08:38.360 --> 08:41.360]  What changes is Schwab talking about?
[08:41.360 --> 08:42.720]  We don't know.
[08:42.720 --> 08:46.200]  What we're certain of is that you're going to pay for them, and the people in charge
[08:46.200 --> 08:47.920]  will benefit from them.
[08:47.920 --> 08:50.000]  You can bet on that.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.280]  What's telling is how different this is now from the way our leaders were talking back
[08:54.280 --> 08:56.440]  when the pandemic began.
[08:56.440 --> 08:59.880]  So statewide coronavirus lockdowns in this country started about eight months ago in
[08:59.880 --> 09:01.200]  mid-March.
[09:01.200 --> 09:06.080]  At the time, California's governor Gavin Newsom predicted that 56% of his state's population
[09:06.080 --> 09:11.960]  that's more than 25 million people would become infected with the virus within eight weeks.
[09:11.960 --> 09:15.240]  Businesses would need to shut down, Newsom acknowledged, but he also promised it would
[09:15.240 --> 09:20.920]  all be over soon, quote, this is not a permanent state, Newsom assured us.
[09:20.920 --> 09:24.880]  It is a moment in time, and that should have made us nervous.
[09:24.880 --> 09:28.040]  Because in the end, that moment continued indefinitely.
[09:28.040 --> 09:32.280]  Pretty soon, Gavin Newsom was telling us who we were allowed to be around, and who we were
[09:32.280 --> 09:33.520]  allowed to talk to.
[09:33.520 --> 09:38.240]  As always, I want to remind you, limit your mixing with people outside of your household.
[09:38.240 --> 09:44.640]  It's just common sense, but the data suggests not everybody's practicing common sense.
[09:44.640 --> 09:50.680]  Okay, so that was in July when Gavin Newsom told the data suggest.
[09:50.680 --> 09:52.760]  What have we learned from the data since then?
[09:52.760 --> 09:58.560]  Well, as of November 15th, about 2.6% of the total state of California has been infected.
[09:58.560 --> 10:04.800]  That's roughly 20 million fewer people than Gavin Newsom predicted to be infected by May.
[10:04.800 --> 10:06.360]  So in some ways, that looks like a victory.
[10:06.360 --> 10:07.680]  Can we declare victory?
[10:07.680 --> 10:09.840]  No, just the opposite.
[10:09.840 --> 10:14.040]  Today, Newsom announced that more lockdowns are underway.
[10:14.040 --> 10:17.120]  California, he said, is pulling the emergency break.
[10:17.120 --> 10:19.520]  The emergency break on life itself.
[10:19.520 --> 10:24.800]  Tonight, 41 counties in our biggest state are under the most restrictive form of lockdown.
[10:24.800 --> 10:30.760]  Churches, gyms, restaurants, etc. cannot conduct any kind of indoor operations.
[10:30.760 --> 10:34.320]  So on what grounds is Gavin Newsom declaring this?
[10:34.320 --> 10:35.920]  Well, scientific grounds, of course.
[10:35.920 --> 10:40.000]  Gavin Newsom believes in science, but he doesn't believe in it for himself.
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.400]  Because personally, as a man, Gavin Newsom is exempt from the laws of epidemiology.
[10:45.400 --> 10:50.480]  And we know this because nine days ago, the governor was caught violating his own guidelines,
[10:50.480 --> 10:54.160]  eating at one of the state's most expensive restaurants with a dozen other people.
[10:54.160 --> 10:56.600]  And by the way, he's fine.
[10:56.600 --> 10:57.920]  He didn't die from it.
[10:57.920 --> 11:00.920]  When you're God, you don't fear viruses.
[11:00.920 --> 11:01.920]  Lockdowns are for mortals.
[11:01.920 --> 11:06.360]  So you'd think getting caught would hurt Newsom.
[11:06.360 --> 11:11.440]  Getting caught ignoring your own rules used to be a major problem for politicians.
[11:11.440 --> 11:12.440]  But it's not anymore.
[11:12.440 --> 11:15.800]  They are no longer humiliated by their own hypocrisy.
[11:15.800 --> 11:21.600]  The point of the exercise is to humiliate the rest of us by forcing us to obey transparently
[11:21.600 --> 11:22.600]  absurd orders.
[11:22.600 --> 11:24.760]  Let's see what we can make them do next.
[11:24.760 --> 11:30.000]  OK, for health reasons, everyone has to wear a Viking hat with horns every Wednesday.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  It's the law, Dr. Fauci's orders.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  By the way, people would do that.
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.000]  They would.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.760]  They'd follow the order seen and would scream at them if they didn't.
[11:39.760 --> 11:46.200]  In an environment like this, dominated by completely unreasonable demands from the people
[11:46.200 --> 11:51.520]  on top, mediocrities like Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago thrive.
[11:51.520 --> 11:54.640]  This is a moment created for her and people like her.
[11:54.640 --> 11:59.520]  Watch Lightfoot explain on MSNBC how she has no personal obligation to follow the lockdown
[11:59.520 --> 12:03.920]  restrictions that you could be arrested for ignoring.
[12:03.920 --> 12:09.720]  What do you say to those who are criticizing you less than a week ago, you went out and
[12:09.720 --> 12:15.440]  stood before a massive crowd who was celebrating Joe Biden's victory.
[12:15.440 --> 12:17.480]  And now you're saying your city has to shut down.
[12:17.480 --> 12:19.040]  How do you have one and not the other?
[12:19.040 --> 12:23.680]  There are times when we actually do need to have a relief and come together, and I felt
[12:23.680 --> 12:30.400]  like that was one of those times that crowd was gathered, whether I was there or not.
[12:30.400 --> 12:34.080]  Notice the complete lack of embarrassment.
[12:34.080 --> 12:40.120]  No shame whatsoever, inflection in the voice doesn't move.
[12:40.120 --> 12:43.400]  There are times when the rules just don't apply to me.
[12:43.400 --> 12:44.600]  Okay.
[12:44.600 --> 12:46.160]  And no one says anything.
[12:46.160 --> 12:47.800]  So when specifically are those times?
[12:47.800 --> 12:51.280]  When don't the rules apply to the people making the rules?
[12:51.280 --> 12:56.360]  Well, in Washington D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser decided that her rules did not apply to Joe
[12:56.360 --> 12:59.160]  Biden's victory party in Delaware.
[12:59.160 --> 13:00.600]  So she went.
[13:00.600 --> 13:04.320]  According to the party, she explained was quote, absolutely essential, and it was, and
[13:04.320 --> 13:07.520]  you would have guessed this, official business.
[13:07.520 --> 13:11.920]  So Muriel Bowser didn't have to quarantine or restrict her travel in any way because
[13:11.920 --> 13:15.160]  it was on behalf of the Democratic Party.
[13:15.160 --> 13:17.960]  What does the great reset look like?
[13:17.960 --> 13:22.080]  That's what it looks like where the people in charge can do whatever they want because
[13:22.080 --> 13:24.160]  they're in charge.
[13:24.160 --> 13:26.040]  No principle is universal.
[13:26.040 --> 13:29.680]  No standard is evenly applied.
[13:29.680 --> 13:33.120]  No one's enjoying this more than the governor of Washington State, Jay Inslee.
[13:33.120 --> 13:34.440]  Inslee is not a man of science.
[13:34.440 --> 13:36.880]  He's a lawyer like the rest of them.
[13:36.880 --> 13:43.160]  But watch him explain what you're not going to be allowed to do anymore in his state.
[13:43.160 --> 13:48.800]  Indoor social gatherings with people from outside your home are prohibited unless they
[13:48.800 --> 13:52.320]  quarantine for 14 days prior to the social gathering.
[13:52.320 --> 13:55.880]  Outdoor gatherings are limited to no more than five people.
[13:55.880 --> 13:59.600]  The restaurants and bars are closed for indoor service.
[13:59.600 --> 14:05.160]  Religious services will be limited to 25% of indoor capacity, or 200 people, whichever
[14:05.160 --> 14:06.160]  you want.
[14:06.160 --> 14:07.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[14:07.680 --> 14:09.480]  I've got plenty of important stuff to cover.
[14:09.480 --> 14:13.880]  I don't normally start the broadcast with five minutes or six minutes of Tucker Carlson,
[14:13.880 --> 14:16.000]  but he knocked it out of the park.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.840]  And the full 30-minute monologue, usually there's a five-minute monologue, is solid gold.
[14:19.840 --> 14:23.520]  It's posted at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[14:23.520 --> 14:30.400]  I hope you share it, but here's the final equation.
[14:30.400 --> 14:32.680]  This is about unjust weights and measures.
[14:32.680 --> 14:36.680]  That's why behind us we have the goddess of justice.
[14:36.680 --> 14:43.280]  She's supposedly blind, but in this case, it isn't the goddess justice with the scales
[14:43.280 --> 14:44.960]  in her hands.
[14:44.960 --> 14:48.360]  It is the globalist.
[14:48.360 --> 14:52.760]  Here with their psychological warfare chiefs trying to overthrow logic and trying to overthrow
[14:52.760 --> 14:57.960]  the Western traditions because they sit in contravention to their absolute total despotic
[14:57.960 --> 15:01.800]  power, and that's what this is about.
[15:01.800 --> 15:03.320]  It's what this has always been about.
[15:03.320 --> 15:04.760]  So Tucker said something the first.
[15:04.760 --> 15:10.240]  He said, we don't know what this agenda 2030 is all about, but it's a UN run by the richest
[15:10.240 --> 15:15.200]  people in the world, and it's a power grab, and we know that it's dictatorial.
[15:15.200 --> 15:19.240]  No, Tucker, I know you know.
[15:19.240 --> 15:25.160]  I was sending you great reset videos in March saying this is their plan.
[15:25.160 --> 15:27.800]  We made a bunch of reports about it, so did Greg Reese.
[15:27.800 --> 15:31.760]  They're at Band-Aid video, but Tucker is spoon feeding, which is fine.
[15:31.760 --> 15:36.400]  His audience to get him ready for what this is, tyrannical world government, total shutdown
[15:36.400 --> 15:40.520]  of society and civilization by design, and we got to get out of it now.
[15:40.520 --> 15:42.240]  You can't wait.
[15:42.240 --> 15:45.920]  They're putting the chains on now, so we're going to come through and lay all this out
[15:45.920 --> 15:49.440]  in Ali Alexander's in studio, we're about to go to Georgia with how to stop the steel
[15:49.440 --> 15:51.720]  in the next big leg of the fight.
[15:51.720 --> 15:52.720]  This is a critical transmission.
[15:52.720 --> 15:57.360]  You'll want to stay with us at infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[15:57.360 --> 15:59.600]  Talk about tomorrow's news today.
[15:59.600 --> 16:02.800]  This is all very transparent when you war game it out.
[16:02.800 --> 16:07.080]  Six months ago, info wars predicted that the mail-in ballots would be used to steal the
[16:07.080 --> 16:08.080]  election from Trump.
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.680]  They would simply pause the voting at night and then have an unlimited number that they
[16:12.680 --> 16:16.480]  had in reserve to bring forward in battleground states to secure the victory.
[16:16.480 --> 16:17.480]  And now that happened.
[16:17.480 --> 16:21.440]  Now, what else did I predict a few months ago and again last week and again last night
[16:21.440 --> 16:22.440]  all on record?
[16:22.440 --> 16:27.480]  That when Joe Biden was president-elect, via fraud, Trump would challenge it.
[16:27.480 --> 16:32.040]  But Biden's next move would be to form his own COVID task force, say that Trump is in
[16:32.040 --> 16:37.360] ept and has killed 267,000 Americans, which is a true and demand Trump's removal via
[16:37.360 --> 16:42.120]  the 25th Amendment if he doesn't let Joe Biden's new COVID task force give all the
[16:42.120 --> 16:43.120]  new orders.
[16:43.120 --> 16:46.640]  They'll tell Trump that if he backs down and follows their orders and steps down, they
[16:46.640 --> 16:47.640]  won't blame him for COVID.
[16:47.640 --> 16:49.640]  But if he does it, they're going to blame him for COVID.
[16:49.640 --> 16:52.280]  But then if he does do what they say, he's still going to blame him anyways.
[16:52.280 --> 16:54.760]  Plus, this has meant for martial law to destroy the economy.
[16:54.760 --> 16:56.640]  I warned you all.
[16:56.640 --> 17:00.080]  When President Trump said that the mainstream corporate media was the enemy of America,
[17:00.080 --> 17:02.000]  he really was telling the truth.
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.200]  They don't just work for the Communist Chinese and the globalists and the EU and the whole
[17:05.200 --> 17:08.240]  Hollywood, America hating, God hating crew.
[17:08.240 --> 17:13.480]  They literally say that they are in control of our minds and believe that they do own
[17:13.480 --> 17:17.680]  us and tell us who the president is, even though that's not in law.
[17:17.680 --> 17:22.680]  And they're just gaslighting the whole public over and over again saying, Joe Biden is president-elect,
[17:22.680 --> 17:27.440]  repeating it over and over again like a brainwashing mantra, when it's up again to the state government
[17:27.440 --> 17:30.800]  to certify those votes, and those votes for being challenged, there's massive evidence
[17:30.800 --> 17:31.800]  of fraud.
[17:31.800 --> 17:34.680]  Again, this is so incredibly clear.
[17:34.680 --> 17:38.360]  Joe Biden said, because he thought he was going to lose up front, that, oh, we're going
[17:38.360 --> 17:41.360]  to challenge the vote, no matter what, until every vote's counted.
[17:41.360 --> 17:44.760]  Well, a lot of votes haven't been counted and there's massive fraud being discovered,
[17:44.760 --> 17:48.800]  so we're going to hold the course here because Joe Biden is a Communist Chinese agent.
[17:48.800 --> 17:49.800]  He's a globalist.
[17:49.800 --> 17:50.800]  He wants carbon taxes.
[17:50.800 --> 17:54.960]  He will destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us.
[17:54.960 --> 18:00.360]  This is war.
[18:00.360 --> 18:14.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:14.240 --> 18:20.640]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[18:20.640 --> 18:34.280]  front lines of the Info War.
[18:34.280 --> 18:35.280]  Welcome back.
[18:35.280 --> 18:36.280]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[18:36.280 --> 18:42.720]  We have a lot of exciting news all across Mainline Radio, Mainline TV from Australia to Germany
[18:42.720 --> 18:45.640]  to the United Kingdom to Canada.
[18:45.640 --> 18:50.760]  Human hosts are now covering the Great Reset and how it is designed to trigger a worldwide
[18:50.760 --> 18:56.560]  financial collapse to, quote, lower our carbon footprint and consolidate power for the financial
[18:56.560 --> 18:59.880]  interest that control the IMF and World Bank.
[18:59.880 --> 19:06.180]  That's what Klaus Schwab, the head of the Davos Group, and Bill Gates are pushing.
[19:06.180 --> 19:13.240]  This is fundamentally super evil and preplanned these very exploitive corporations using
[19:13.240 --> 19:20.720]  governmental power go into all of these countries, buy off their leaders for a few million dollars
[19:20.720 --> 19:24.880]  in those cases, and then put them into debt for tens of millions of dollars over decades
[19:24.880 --> 19:28.440]  and decades and decades and decades, exploiting their populations.
[19:28.440 --> 19:30.200]  It is extremely vicious.
[19:30.200 --> 19:32.000]  It is extremely oppressive.
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.080]  The only thing protecting us somewhat has been our Bill of Rights, our Constitution,
[19:36.080 --> 19:42.000]  the Magna Carta, the rule of law, and practiced tradition of freedom that we wouldn't comply
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.680]  with living in third world type political atmosphere.
[19:46.680 --> 19:54.960]  But COVID-19 is the great chance or the great opportunity in the words of all these globalists
[19:54.960 --> 19:57.600]  to bring in authoritarian UN rule.
[19:57.600 --> 20:05.240]  The UN murders and child traffics and slaughters and sex traffics everywhere they are in control
[20:05.240 --> 20:07.200]  around the world.
[20:07.200 --> 20:13.040]  If you just look into UN child sex trafficking, it's industrial level, millions of children
[20:13.040 --> 20:16.120]  a year, many of them killed.
[20:16.120 --> 20:19.280]  It was set up by the Rockefellers.
[20:19.280 --> 20:24.920]  So Tucker Carlson, everybody's now talking about the great reset and the admissions that
[20:24.920 --> 20:28.720]  they said years ago they'd used the threat of a virus to bring in world government and
[20:28.720 --> 20:29.720]  the breakdown of society.
[20:29.720 --> 20:34.120]  But let's just look at some of the evidence right here today.
[20:34.120 --> 20:42.320]  Paul Joseph Watson tweeted out a quote, Paul Joseph Watson tweeted out a quote of Klaus
[20:42.320 --> 20:46.640]  Schwab in the head of the Davos group, that's the public Bilderberg group.
[20:46.640 --> 20:50.640]  Globalist Klaus Schwab made it clear that transhumanism is an integral part of the quote
[20:50.640 --> 20:55.840]  great reset when he said that the fourth industrial revolution would lead to a fusion of our physical,
[20:55.840 --> 20:57.840]  digital, and biological identity.
[20:57.840 --> 21:03.120]  And when I was in Phoenix last week, they had buses driving around everywhere, I got
[21:03.120 --> 21:07.480]  some video of it, I need to play it on the show, I need to download it off my phone.
[21:07.480 --> 21:11.800]  Of the buses driving by saying nanotech will cure your cancer, nanotech will cure your
[21:11.800 --> 21:12.800]  COVID-19.
[21:12.800 --> 21:17.000]  What it is is a bunch of microchips they inject into you and that's how they get microchips
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.920]  into you is by calling it nanotech.
[21:19.920 --> 21:28.040]  And then a lot of the quote microchips are digital viruses, digital viruses that go in
[21:28.040 --> 21:30.800]  and actually reprogram the cells themselves.
[21:30.800 --> 21:32.000]  These aren't vaccines.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.920]  These are deadly super drugs.
[21:35.920 --> 21:39.480]  And we are the guinea pigs and the great testing is now starting.
[21:39.480 --> 21:43.400]  Globalist Klaus Schwab made it clear, the great reset.
[21:43.400 --> 21:50.600]  Here is a map we can actually punch it up for you, where Klaus Schwab in his big great
[21:50.600 --> 21:57.000]  reset book explains global governance, right here, global government, and he says because
[21:57.000 --> 22:02.920]  that failed and we failed to address the climate action that now we're going to have to have
[22:02.920 --> 22:08.360]  food crises, extreme weather, human-made environmental disasters, meaning viruses.
[22:08.360 --> 22:13.240]  And of course those are magically appearing, he predicted they would but now they are.
[22:13.240 --> 22:17.040]  And then the national governance failures, the global government is going to take over
[22:17.040 --> 22:21.480]  like the New York Times is calling for, social instability, unemployment, adverse technological
[22:21.480 --> 22:24.920]  advances.
[22:24.920 --> 22:29.200]  And all of this of course is the things that they're engineering and that they're exacerbating
[22:29.200 --> 22:34.600]  and then they offer you a solution where they're all tax exempt and they all fly around in jumbo
[22:34.600 --> 22:38.920]  jets and they live on mountaintops, you know, Leonardo DiCaprio and everybody always goes
[22:38.920 --> 22:45.160]  to Davos and they fly in for $10,000 a night hotel rooms and all the masseuses and all the
[22:45.160 --> 22:50.080]  high end prostitutes on a mountaintop and they land in their huge jets and their huge
[22:50.080 --> 22:53.400]  helicopters and all the world leaders are there.
[22:53.400 --> 22:58.000]  And then they lecture us that we shouldn't have children or have a car or have air conditioning
[22:58.000 --> 23:04.320]  and Obama told Africans from Davos seven years ago, you can't have a car, you can't
[23:04.320 --> 23:05.320]  ever have air conditioning.
[23:05.320 --> 23:09.160]  You have to live in a mud hut as if all technology is dirty and bad.
[23:09.160 --> 23:13.880]  But again, these are the ultimate hypocrites, let's continue.
[23:13.880 --> 23:18.800]  Millions of businesses facing ruin, hundreds of millions projected to die in poverty at
[23:18.800 --> 23:24.640]  the economic cost of lockdown hits, compare this to explosion in profits enjoyed by Amazon,
[23:24.640 --> 23:27.960]  Microsoft and big pharma.
[23:27.960 --> 23:30.880]  So as you implode, they all consolidate the power.
[23:30.880 --> 23:34.240]  It's a vertical integration takeover.
[23:34.240 --> 23:39.520]  Did you know the enzyme called luciferous is what makes Bill Gates implantable quantum
[23:39.520 --> 23:43.160]  dot micro needle vaccine delivery system work?
[23:43.160 --> 23:46.800]  How cute.
[23:46.800 --> 23:53.800]  And it goes on and on and on in order to have the great reset to change the world economies
[23:53.800 --> 24:00.360]  and listen to us carefully in order to have the great reset to change world economies
[24:00.360 --> 24:01.740]  to steal from the citizens.
[24:01.740 --> 24:06.160]  You need two things, a puppet leader and a media that convinces people that it's for
[24:06.160 --> 24:07.160]  their own benefit.
[24:07.160 --> 24:09.160]  Energy of Biden, CNN, Facebook, Google, Twitter.
[24:09.160 --> 24:14.000]  It's a great point that folks are making online.
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.040]  Another commenter on Twitter said half the PM and the future head of the state of our
[24:19.040 --> 24:23.880]  country have been openly promoting the globalist world economic forum, great recent initiative
[24:23.880 --> 24:29.440]  for months already, but I cannot find a single mainstream media article in Canada that has
[24:29.440 --> 24:32.040]  mentioned or discussed it because you're a slave.
[24:32.040 --> 24:35.600]  You're not supposed to see all that info.
[24:35.600 --> 24:41.760]  You're supposed to be preconditioned to the UN world government takeover slogans before
[24:41.760 --> 24:45.120]  you ever consciously understand what it is.
[24:45.120 --> 24:46.280]  Build back better.
[24:46.280 --> 24:50.000]  Eric Weinstein put a great graphic together, so did Mark Jeffery.
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.920]  I know it's odd, but when I hear a bunch of powerful people spread out all over the world
[24:53.920 --> 25:01.000]  suddenly use the same totally improbable lame phrase, invariant phrase, my hand involuntarily
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.560]  claps down over my wallet, almost like they need to chant before taking my stuff.
[25:08.560 --> 25:15.360]  And it's Horace Johnson of the UK, Joe Biden of the former US, and all these globalist
[25:15.360 --> 25:21.160]  world leaders saying build back better, which is a UN program to collapse the world, make
[25:21.160 --> 25:25.600]  you all poor, and make you sign over your life to corporate systems that will then keep
[25:25.600 --> 25:30.560]  you at a subsistence level with corporate welfare and governmental welfare.
[25:30.560 --> 25:36.480]  And then the good news is all over Twitter, members of the UK parliament, the parliament
[25:36.480 --> 25:43.200]  in Ottawa, Canada, the parliament in Australia, they are all going public and pointing out
[25:43.200 --> 25:47.640]  that this is world government and showing the actual documents of what's unfolding.
[25:47.640 --> 25:49.600]  Now this all ties into COVID-19.
[25:49.600 --> 25:55.760]  It's the cover for the whole thing, and Justin Trudeau and all of them have admitted this.
[25:55.760 --> 26:03.880]  I mean, super creepy stuff where you're sitting there and you're watching whether it's the
[26:03.880 --> 26:07.480]  British Prime Minister or whether it's Merkel or any of them, they're saying, oh, sorry,
[26:07.480 --> 26:08.840]  the last lockdown didn't work.
[26:08.840 --> 26:12.480]  This one's going to be four to six months long, and then we're never going to totally
[26:12.480 --> 26:13.480]  let it off after that.
[26:13.480 --> 26:16.080]  And by the way, you'll always wear a mask for the rest of your life.
[26:16.080 --> 26:18.760]  And by the way, there's going to be like five shots a year you've got to take, but that
[26:18.760 --> 26:19.760]  won't protect you.
[26:19.760 --> 26:22.400]  You have to have a passport to leave your house, and we're going to have to track your
[26:22.400 --> 26:26.600]  phone at all times, and you'll be arrested, and your neighbors are watching you.
[26:26.600 --> 26:30.680]  Oh, but by the way, you can't leave or go anywhere, but the Democrats in the state of
[26:30.680 --> 26:35.960]  California on taxpayer money are going to Maui to rent out a five-star hotel for themselves
[26:35.960 --> 26:40.080]  to party for a week and a half to celebrate their conquering of you and your family because
[26:40.080 --> 26:41.080]  you put up with it.
[26:41.080 --> 26:46.520]  Now, coming up on the ground, fighting Georgia, a key domino that the globalists want to knock
[26:46.520 --> 26:50.200]  down to take down Trump, I'm about to go on a plane and go through this afternoon, Ollie
[26:50.200 --> 27:19.200]  Alexander's in studio with Key Intel, stay with us.
[27:19.200 --> 27:22.000]  And then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had.
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  This is completely transparent.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.080]  So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not.
[27:26.080 --> 27:27.080]  Trump is not conceded.
[27:27.080 --> 27:30.280]  None of the states have certified the vote, and now all these investigations have been
[27:30.280 --> 27:35.520]  opened up, and avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come out and already
[27:35.520 --> 27:36.520]  been documented.
[27:36.520 --> 27:40.640]  And in Georgia, officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[27:40.640 --> 27:42.960]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[27:42.960 --> 27:46.880]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax failed.
[27:46.880 --> 27:50.400]  But now, this is the mother of all hoaxes, and if they get away with this, it's the end
[27:50.400 --> 27:55.200]  of America as we know it, we will be Venezuela in FullWars.com.
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.600]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed, and why is that?
[28:00.600 --> 28:05.200]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree like bush grows from it that
[28:05.200 --> 28:08.720]  produces more mustard seeds.
[28:08.720 --> 28:12.840]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[28:12.840 --> 28:13.840]  They didn't know why.
[28:13.840 --> 28:19.000]  Well, with modern science, we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.500]  selenium.
[28:20.500 --> 28:28.760]  We have bio-true selenium sold out for months back in stock at infowarsstore.com at 50% off,
[28:28.760 --> 28:32.320]  store-wide free shipping, and triple Patriot points.
[28:32.320 --> 28:39.200]  Bio-true selenium at infowarsstore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing
[28:39.200 --> 28:40.960]  in that it funds our operation.
[28:40.960 --> 28:44.000]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.120]  It is an essential nutrient in the body that you actually have to have.
[28:48.120 --> 29:05.760]  It's back in stock 50% off, triple Patriot points at infowarsstore.com and with free shipping.
[29:05.760 --> 29:10.240]  Now it's easier than ever to have Bandot video on your iPhone.
[29:10.240 --> 29:13.640]  Simply go to Bandot video with your Safari browser.
[29:13.640 --> 29:16.880]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[29:16.880 --> 29:20.360]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[29:20.360 --> 29:22.480]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[29:22.480 --> 29:24.740]  I suggest Bandot video.
[29:24.740 --> 29:29.160]  You will now have Bandot video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook
[29:29.160 --> 29:30.160]  tried to stop it.
[29:30.160 --> 29:34.440]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[29:34.440 --> 29:38.680]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[29:38.680 --> 29:42.800]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below.
[29:42.800 --> 29:47.280]  On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure and share
[29:47.280 --> 29:58.200]  Bandot video.
[29:58.200 --> 30:08.400]  Thanks for listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:08.400 --> 30:10.720]  Waging war on corruption.
[30:10.720 --> 30:17.560]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[30:17.560 --> 30:20.880]  The enemy of the American people, the controlled corporate press, have fought hard to say just
[30:20.880 --> 30:23.440]  a few thousand people showed up in D.C.
[30:23.440 --> 30:29.960]  He had hired senior current D.C. police, and they estimated it was 800,000 up to a million
[30:29.960 --> 30:34.480]  from what they saw because the march stretched for over three miles, cramming up to four
[30:34.480 --> 30:35.920]  streets wide.
[30:35.920 --> 30:37.520]  It was incredible.
[30:37.520 --> 30:41.200]  There were helicopters above, but the news helicopters never showed you the footage that
[30:41.200 --> 30:43.640]  you are about to see that we shot on the ground.
[30:43.640 --> 30:45.560]  Here it is.
[30:45.560 --> 30:48.120]  To be decided by the international world.
[30:48.120 --> 30:53.920]  And comprehensive footage from the historic million-maga march held in Washington, D.C.
[30:53.920 --> 30:56.200]  on November 14th, 2020.
[30:56.200 --> 31:01.680]  The corporate press is desperately trying to suppress this information.
[31:01.680 --> 31:07.840]  Using deceptive headlines and cropped photos, just as they had done at the 2016 inauguration,
[31:07.840 --> 31:12.480]  mainstream media attempted to deceive the American people and hide the massive magnitude
[31:12.480 --> 31:14.800]  of this historic march.
[31:14.800 --> 31:20.160]  Most of the establishment media refused to show the amazing rooftop shots of the beginning
[31:20.160 --> 31:26.360]  of the rally at Freedom Plaza, where police estimated over 100,000 people met.
[31:26.360 --> 31:30.880]  This shot was taken from the middle of Freedom Plaza at 11.30 before the event even began.
[31:30.880 --> 31:52.840]  Over the next three hours, marchers continued to congregate, march down Pennsylvania Avenue,
[31:52.840 --> 31:58.720]  down Constitution Avenue, to the Supreme Court, where the final protest was held.
[31:58.720 --> 32:03.560]  We are unified by our spirit that God made, and our connection to the creator of the universe
[32:03.560 --> 32:04.840]  and our children.
[32:04.840 --> 32:13.360]  And we are unified, and this is the genesis point of the new revolution of information.
[32:13.360 --> 32:18.000]  Our crew walked all the way back to Freedom Plaza, where people were still congregating
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.840]  en masse and marching towards the Supreme Court building.
[32:22.840 --> 32:27.320]  Our contacts inside the D.C. police, who we had contracted for security, estimated that
[32:27.320 --> 32:31.360]  this march was bigger than Lewis Farrakhan's million man march and could have easily topped
[32:31.360 --> 32:33.880]  over one million.
[32:33.880 --> 32:37.880]  This information is vital to the future of the Republic, and the establishment corporate
[32:37.880 --> 32:39.800]  media is fighting to suppress it.
[32:39.800 --> 32:43.560]  Only you can take this video and re-upload it everywhere you know and spread it to your
[32:43.560 --> 32:47.440]  friends, your family, your neighbors to get the truth out and save the Republic.
[32:47.440 --> 33:05.240]  I declare that Donald J. Trump won re-election in 2012.
[33:05.240 --> 33:06.880]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[33:06.880 --> 33:08.520]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[33:08.520 --> 33:14.480]  Ali Alexander, political analyst, and of course, publisher is here with us, and he's been doing
[33:14.480 --> 33:19.040]  a great job flying around the country trying to analyze exactly what's happening with their
[33:19.040 --> 33:23.240]  attempts to steal this election, and he's been trying to stop the steal going back over
[33:23.240 --> 33:24.240]  six months.
[33:24.240 --> 33:28.040]  Of course, collaborating with Roger Stone that first developed to stop the steal, operations
[33:28.040 --> 33:29.680]  more than two years ago.
[33:29.680 --> 33:34.680]  We're coming off that huge successful rally you just saw some exclusive excerpts of from
[33:34.680 --> 33:38.400]  Saturday that the media is trying to block, but the big battles right now are obviously
[33:38.400 --> 33:44.240]  in Georgia, are in Pennsylvania, are in Michigan, are in Arizona, Nevada, and they say the big
[33:44.240 --> 33:48.960]  domino right now is Georgia because they want to falsely certify that election as they find
[33:48.960 --> 33:52.560]  with just spot checks, massive evidence of election fraud.
[33:52.560 --> 33:57.240]  Almost all the votes they're finding, by two thirds or more, are going to Trump as we predicted,
[33:57.240 --> 34:01.360]  and he will win Georgia if we're allowed to have a real process, we need an emergency
[34:01.360 --> 34:03.240]  legislative session called by the governor.
[34:03.240 --> 34:07.200]  I'm going to go on a plane this evening to travel to Georgia with Ali and others, and
[34:07.200 --> 34:12.800]  we're going to be there tomorrow and on Thursday and on Friday and on Saturday at noon around
[34:12.800 --> 34:16.960]  the Capitol demanding that they protect voting integrity in this nation.
[34:16.960 --> 34:18.520]  Ali, give us the latest around the country.
[34:18.520 --> 34:19.520]  Well, that's the latest.
[34:19.520 --> 34:21.440]  First, Alex, let me thank you for your patriotism.
[34:21.440 --> 34:26.440]  If you did not marshal the forces, DC would have been a fraction of what it was.
[34:26.440 --> 34:31.040]  I walked through the crowd and it was something out of the Bible.
[34:31.040 --> 34:33.720]  People just wanted to touch my garment or something like that.
[34:33.720 --> 34:35.400]  And I said, well, where'd you hear about this?
[34:35.400 --> 34:36.840]  And they said, info wars.
[34:36.840 --> 34:37.920]  I saw you with Alex.
[34:37.920 --> 34:39.920]  I had to come from Oregon, from California.
[34:39.920 --> 34:43.080]  I just want to thank them for coming and they need to come to Georgia now.
[34:43.080 --> 34:44.240]  They need to come to Georgia now.
[34:44.240 --> 34:47.680]  I think if you're in any of the surrounding states come to Georgia, but we're still going
[34:47.680 --> 34:49.120]  to need you in other places.
[34:49.120 --> 34:50.120]  So sit tight.
[34:50.120 --> 34:56.960]  This is a race to December 14th to get Trump, Donald Trump, 270 electoral votes or deprive
[34:56.960 --> 35:01.280]  both candidates of 270 electoral votes and then send it to the House of Representatives
[35:01.280 --> 35:02.980]  that then becomes a House of States.
[35:02.980 --> 35:04.280]  And then he wins there.
[35:04.280 --> 35:08.720]  But what we're hearing on the ground in Georgia is that they need the boots there, that if
[35:08.720 --> 35:14.120]  the Secretary of State finishes the canvassing and the recount today, that he will certify
[35:14.120 --> 35:17.040]  the election by Thursday at 5 p.m.
[35:17.040 --> 35:21.160]  That gives the governor, Brian Kemp, who has been wobbly on this issue, the only person
[35:21.160 --> 35:26.520]  though that we can influence Friday, 5 p.m., it gives him a deadline of Friday at 5 p.m.
[35:26.520 --> 35:27.960]  to then certify the election.
[35:27.960 --> 35:33.440]  And if he certifies the election, that sends Democrat electors to the Electoral College.
[35:33.440 --> 35:39.000]  So what we want is a special session to re-engage the constitutional process that allows the
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.280]  State House, the State Senate to say we choose the electors, dubbed to us by the U.S. Constitution.
[35:44.280 --> 35:47.120]  And let's be clear, we didn't just pull this out of a hat.
[35:47.120 --> 35:52.880]  Judges just ruled in California, Newsom illegally said that they could take ballots and order
[35:52.880 --> 35:57.840]  counties to do mail-in ballots mainly and to count things that were post-dated after.
[35:57.840 --> 36:00.360]  We also have judges saying the same thing in other states.
[36:00.360 --> 36:04.240]  And again, let's explain who these Democrat operatives are, who some of these rhinos are
[36:04.240 --> 36:09.240]  that met with Hillary Clinton's consigliari to make an illegal deal outside of legislative
[36:09.240 --> 36:13.680]  law between the governor's office to allow the illegal counting of these ballots that
[36:13.680 --> 36:15.240]  came in later and properly.
[36:15.240 --> 36:16.240]  This is the key.
[36:16.240 --> 36:17.240]  This is illegal.
[36:17.240 --> 36:18.720]  This is extra legislative.
[36:18.720 --> 36:23.560]  This is why the legislature must come back into session to override this power grab.
[36:23.560 --> 36:25.000]  They have to override this power grab.
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.360]  What people need to understand is dominion, dominion, dominion, and I've got to tell you
[36:28.360 --> 36:34.440]  I've seen the case, Sidney Powell has a great case, but it can't all be about dominion.
[36:34.440 --> 36:39.040]  Democrats have found a way to cheat, Alex, for decades and decades and decades.
[36:39.040 --> 36:43.960]  In fact, JFK stole the election from Richard Nixon, and Richard Nixon thought for the good
[36:43.960 --> 36:47.200]  of the country that he should concede so he conceded.
[36:47.200 --> 36:48.920]  No more conceding.
[36:48.920 --> 36:50.320]  It's the mail-in ballot.
[36:50.320 --> 36:51.320]  It's the absentee ballot.
[36:51.320 --> 36:56.520]  By the way, even PBS brags that they stole Illinois and other key states.
[36:56.520 --> 36:59.560]  States in Illinois were stole by the unions and the mobs.
[36:59.560 --> 37:03.720]  The mobs run the unions, and the FBI lets the mob do whatever they do.
[37:03.720 --> 37:04.720]  We know this.
[37:04.720 --> 37:05.720]  We know this.
[37:05.720 --> 37:07.520]  What they're doing now is very much the same.
[37:07.520 --> 37:12.080]  Laura Loomer caught the union thug in Broward County in 2018 when I was running Stop the
[37:12.080 --> 37:14.560]  Steel to save Rick Scott's U.S. Senate seat.
[37:14.560 --> 37:18.880]  If we never would have got Rick Scott up to the Senate, then the impeachment rules would
[37:18.880 --> 37:20.880]  have been different.
[37:20.880 --> 37:21.880]  Chief Justice John Robbins.
[37:21.880 --> 37:23.160]  Well, you're not taking credit.
[37:23.160 --> 37:24.160]  You did that.
[37:24.160 --> 37:25.160]  You marched.
[37:25.160 --> 37:26.160]  You organized it.
[37:26.160 --> 37:27.160]  You were able to do it.
[37:27.160 --> 37:29.840]  That shows how listeners are just as important as you are or as I am.
[37:29.840 --> 37:30.840]  They look at the numbers.
[37:30.840 --> 37:31.840]  They know.
[37:31.840 --> 37:32.840]  We need the governor to know.
[37:32.840 --> 37:34.080]  We know your chief of staff.
[37:34.080 --> 37:35.880]  We know your people are Democrat operatives.
[37:35.880 --> 37:37.920]  We know they're on the Dominion payroll.
[37:37.920 --> 37:43.040]  We know that this other, you know, the Secretary of State and all them are really Democrats.
[37:43.040 --> 37:48.100]  And you will have put around your neck the stealing of the 2020 election and delivering
[37:48.100 --> 37:53.120]  us in the hands of the Chai-Com operative, Sleepy Joe, Pervert Joe, Creepy Joe Biden,
[37:53.120 --> 37:55.720]  and you will be an enemy of America, period, Governor.
[37:55.720 --> 37:57.080]  You will burn in hell.
[37:57.080 --> 37:58.080]  Yeah.
[37:58.080 --> 38:03.840]  If you take away our God-given right to self-govern, to vote, to find consensus and debate and
[38:03.840 --> 38:06.760]  do rhetoric, then you will burn in hell.
[38:06.760 --> 38:08.280]  And not only that, but this is China.
[38:08.280 --> 38:11.120]  Again, that information is going to come out soon.
[38:11.120 --> 38:15.640]  And Sidney Powell, we're telling you to release that today, today, Rudy, today, today, because
[38:15.640 --> 38:20.480]  I just talked to somebody who talked to the president last night and he's a well-known
[38:20.480 --> 38:21.480]  talk show host.
[38:21.480 --> 38:22.480]  I'll leave it at that.
[38:22.480 --> 38:24.280]  And he said, no, Trump's getting ready to announce it's China.
[38:24.280 --> 38:25.440]  They have all the proof.
[38:25.440 --> 38:26.440]  Everything is China.
[38:26.440 --> 38:27.440]  We got it.
[38:27.440 --> 38:29.020]  This is a foreign power doing this.
[38:29.020 --> 38:33.680]  Even if Biden won, which clearly, Trump won the original battleground states by more points
[38:33.680 --> 38:34.680]  when they closed the polls.
[38:34.680 --> 38:36.760]  I mean, there was a bigger landslide.
[38:36.760 --> 38:38.880]  Even if he won, he's ineligible.
[38:38.880 --> 38:43.160]  This is everything they said about Trump with Russia is true about Biden with China in spades.
[38:43.160 --> 38:44.160]  Yeah.
[38:44.160 --> 38:45.160]  It's just so fishery.
[38:45.160 --> 38:48.520]  I mean, they, they're gaslighting us with their own accusations.
[38:48.520 --> 38:51.960]  And what can we expect from the children of Olensky, the children of Satan?
[38:51.960 --> 38:53.360]  What else can we expect?
[38:53.360 --> 38:56.960]  But those who don't know, he pledged his book, rules for radicals, elucifer.
[38:56.960 --> 38:57.960]  He did.
[38:57.960 --> 38:58.960]  That's the opening.
[38:58.960 --> 39:02.080]  And he said, he went, he went later and he said, I did that so conservatives wouldn't
[39:02.080 --> 39:03.600]  read the manual.
[39:03.600 --> 39:07.880]  And so we, we can't, we can't underestimate the evil of these people.
[39:07.880 --> 39:08.880]  They're willing to steal the election.
[39:08.880 --> 39:11.440]  And we're going to Georgia because people need to understand this.
[39:11.440 --> 39:14.880]  It's not just about the electoral college or Trump or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[39:14.880 --> 39:16.720]  They will then steal the runoff.
[39:16.720 --> 39:17.720]  Yeah.
[39:17.720 --> 39:20.040]  They will steal two U.S. Senate seats.
[39:20.040 --> 39:21.040]  And it's not a coincidence.
[39:21.040 --> 39:23.840]  It's the deep state on both sides.
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.320]  We'll maybe get into that later, but there's a reason why both of those seats are up for
[39:27.320 --> 39:28.920]  grabs at the same time.
[39:28.920 --> 39:30.960]  There's a reason why that would tip the Senate over.
[39:30.960 --> 39:31.960]  That's right.
[39:31.960 --> 39:33.040]  They bet all their money on just a few states.
[39:33.040 --> 39:34.040]  All of their money.
[39:34.040 --> 39:37.040]  There's a reason why the staffing is the way it is at the governor's office.
[39:37.040 --> 39:38.040]  I'm trying to be polite because.
[39:38.040 --> 39:39.040]  No, let's not do it.
[39:39.040 --> 39:40.040]  Let's just go ahead and attack.
[39:40.040 --> 39:42.560]  The governor, the governor may be a Chycom agent.
[39:42.560 --> 39:43.560]  Stay with us.
[39:43.560 --> 39:44.560]  We'll be right back.
[39:44.560 --> 39:45.560]  Yep.
[39:45.560 --> 39:46.560]  That's right, Georgia.
[39:46.560 --> 39:49.400]  If your governor doesn't do this, he's a Chycom dirty agent and just as bad as Biden.
[39:49.400 --> 39:50.400]  You understand that?
[39:50.400 --> 39:51.400]  Yeah.
[39:51.400 --> 39:52.400]  We'll be right back.
[39:52.400 --> 39:58.040]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful

[40:45.240 --> 40:54.680]  Head to InfowarsStore.com today.
[40:54.680 --> 40:58.720]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes
[40:58.720 --> 40:59.720]  of the two.
[40:59.720 --> 41:02.800]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[41:02.800 --> 41:08.440]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture
[41:08.440 --> 41:11.840]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[41:11.840 --> 41:17.120]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above
[41:17.120 --> 41:18.120]  it.
[41:18.120 --> 41:23.400]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[41:23.400 --> 41:25.840]  of total mass, high-tech slavery.
[41:25.840 --> 41:29.920]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[41:29.920 --> 41:33.720]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave
[41:33.720 --> 41:34.720]  masters.
[41:34.720 --> 41:38.680]  A global permanent lockdown is here and it is already causing millions and millions of
[41:38.680 --> 41:42.160]  starve to death when they're done, billions will starve to death.
[41:42.160 --> 41:45.800]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out
[41:45.800 --> 41:50.040]  and said the coming lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[41:50.040 --> 41:51.040]  That's the facts.
[41:51.040 --> 41:55.000]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.

[42:51.880 --> 42:52.880]  3, 9.
[42:52.880 --> 42:55.080]  Please take action today in our emergency cell.
[42:55.080 --> 42:56.080]  Election 2020 is here.
[42:56.080 --> 43:01.680]  And whether Trump wins or loses, we have all won by exposing the Communist Chinese, by
[43:01.680 --> 43:06.960]  exposing the globalists, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing the fact this is really
[43:06.960 --> 43:09.280]  a fight between good versus evil.
[43:09.280 --> 43:13.320]  Now, I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God, and I know God's real and I've experienced
[43:13.320 --> 43:14.320]  it in my life.
[43:14.320 --> 43:18.040]  But even if you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is good
[43:18.040 --> 43:19.360]  in this world, there is evil.
[43:19.360 --> 43:24.040]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing that.
[43:24.040 --> 43:29.400]  And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally
[43:29.400 --> 43:34.000]  get that, they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore.
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.840]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what
[43:39.840 --> 43:43.120]  they stand for and who they are, or you're going to get hurt.
[43:43.120 --> 43:46.400]  But those of you out there who have done your own research and discovered who's good and
[43:46.400 --> 43:50.520]  who is faithful will then come together with those organizations and support them like
[43:50.520 --> 44:00.720]  Info Wars, because without your support, Info Wars would not exist.
[27:38.520 --> 44:40.200]  world.
[44:40.200 --> 44:41.200]  None of it's true.
[44:41.200 --> 44:45.080]  A replay of what they did eight months ago totally exaggerated hundreds of times over
[44:45.080 --> 44:51.280]  blown, but Ali Alexander leaves at the bottom of the next hour, I am going to get into the
[44:51.280 --> 44:55.160]  global reset lockdown to and how we stop it.
[44:55.160 --> 45:00.960]  As the president's own head of his covered task force said, that's President Trump.
[45:00.960 --> 45:03.280]  He said, you've got to rise up against this.
[45:03.280 --> 45:04.880]  This is martial law.
[45:04.880 --> 45:08.480]  This is who the left really is wanting total enslavement.
[45:08.480 --> 45:11.800]  Now it takes a lot of money to be able to travel around the country to be able to fight
[45:11.800 --> 45:15.560]  the new world order to have this crew and to go what we go through and I'm not complaining.
[45:15.560 --> 45:18.680]  I'm just asking for your support, ladies and gentlemen.
[45:18.680 --> 45:22.880]  And so we've got a sale that's been going to stop the steel cell for the last week or

[46:26.520 --> 46:28.880]  We're not financed by George Soros, the new world order.
[46:28.880 --> 46:32.040]  We are financed by people like you.
[46:32.040 --> 46:35.920]  So Ali Alexander, let's continue getting into why Georgia is so important and how we saw
[46:35.920 --> 46:37.320]  this.
[46:37.320 --> 46:39.680]  Our police escort said 800,000 to a million people.
[46:39.680 --> 46:42.360]  I had no idea it was that big till we went back and reviewed the footage.
[46:42.360 --> 46:45.600]  So it took three hours for everybody to even finish the March and get to one spot.
[46:45.600 --> 46:49.120]  Then it was too big leave and helicopters to see where all the people were.
[46:49.120 --> 46:50.600]  That really scared the system.
[46:50.600 --> 46:53.520]  I've got a clip next hour of CNN going, we're scared.
[46:53.520 --> 46:54.520]  They're crazy.
[46:54.520 --> 46:55.680]  They're in an alternate universe.
[46:55.680 --> 46:57.240]  They didn't believe Joe Biden one.
[46:57.240 --> 47:00.120]  Joe Biden said he'd wait till it was all independently certified.
[47:00.120 --> 47:01.120]  He lied.
[47:01.120 --> 47:02.120]  They lied.
[47:02.120 --> 47:03.120]  Another giant hoax.
[47:03.120 --> 47:04.360]  Another attempted coup.
[47:04.360 --> 47:07.360]  And they are really starting to get scared that Trump's called their bluff in this game
[47:07.360 --> 47:08.360]  of chicken.
[47:08.360 --> 47:09.360]  Yeah.
[47:09.360 --> 47:13.960]  Has your crew set up a video where Joe Biden said we're going to wait till the Electoral
[47:13.960 --> 47:14.960]  College meets?
[47:14.960 --> 47:15.960]  We're not going to listen to the media.
[47:15.960 --> 47:16.960]  We're not going to listen to this.
[47:16.960 --> 47:17.960]  Red Mirage this.
[47:17.960 --> 47:18.960]  Red Mirage that.
[47:18.960 --> 47:20.080]  Have you guys put together a video?
[47:20.080 --> 47:21.080]  We have.
[47:21.080 --> 47:22.080]  We have.
[47:22.080 --> 47:24.080]  We were playing those before it happened and we've been playing it since the election.
[47:24.080 --> 47:25.080]  Yes, a lot.
[47:25.080 --> 47:26.080]  Yeah.
[47:26.080 --> 47:27.080]  Yeah.
[47:27.080 --> 47:29.280]  It's very important for people not to forget because they are moving us at a pace of
[47:29.280 --> 47:30.880]  chaos and hysteria.
[47:30.880 --> 47:33.400]  And what they need to know is that we won't let them.
[47:33.400 --> 47:35.440]  That's why we've taken this movement offline.
[47:35.440 --> 47:39.200]  That's why people are calling each other and text messaging each other and emailing each
[47:39.200 --> 47:40.200]  other and showing up.
[47:40.200 --> 47:45.280]  And Alex, when you and I and Owen, we were all in Austin, Texas, 3,000 patriots showed
[47:45.280 --> 47:46.280]  up.
[47:46.280 --> 47:47.960]  I thought 300 to 500 would show up.
[47:47.960 --> 47:50.440]  I didn't promo that I was coming until the night before.
[47:50.440 --> 47:52.960]  I don't know if you promo that you were coming.
[47:52.960 --> 47:53.960]  Patriots everywhere.
[47:53.960 --> 47:57.920]  We took over the streets and I just was so elated when I was leaving at two or three
[47:57.920 --> 48:04.840]  p.m., I said, we're marching on D.C. six and a half days later, we have all of these patriots
[48:04.840 --> 48:05.840]  walking out.
[48:05.840 --> 48:09.640]  And, you know, when I was surveying the crowd, a third of these people were info warriors.
[48:09.640 --> 48:16.440]  A third of these people in Washington, D.C. that are terrifying the American oligarchs
[48:16.440 --> 48:17.440]  are info warriors.
[48:17.440 --> 48:19.240]  And so I'm like, I'm like you.
[48:19.240 --> 48:20.240]  I'm a bridge builder.
[48:20.240 --> 48:21.360]  I'm a coalition builder.
[48:21.360 --> 48:27.160]  I want everybody and anybody who believes their vote should matter to show up in Georgia.
[48:27.160 --> 48:32.320]  Because if we lose Georgia, then the Republicans in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania,
[48:32.320 --> 48:33.320]  they'll lose their spot.
[48:33.320 --> 48:35.400]  They're going to have cover.
[48:35.400 --> 48:36.400]  I hope so.
[48:36.400 --> 48:39.160]  We're going to provide them cover and then Georgia got to provide cover for the rest
[48:39.160 --> 48:40.960]  of the nation or it's over.
[48:40.960 --> 48:44.280]  So we can lose this race on Friday.
[48:44.280 --> 48:49.280]  If patriots do not show up at the Capitol, we've we're working with the Atlanta police.
[48:49.280 --> 48:51.440]  They're like, Hey, we're not issuing permits to anyone.
[48:51.440 --> 48:53.400]  And I said, Hey, we're showing up anyway.
[48:53.400 --> 48:54.520]  They said, we'll keep you safe.
[48:54.520 --> 48:55.920]  And I said, I hope so.
[48:55.920 --> 48:56.920]  Don't worry.
[48:56.920 --> 48:57.920]  We're bringing the boys.
[48:57.920 --> 48:58.920]  That's right.
[48:58.920 --> 48:59.920]  The proud boys are coming.
[48:59.920 --> 49:05.720]  A lot of a lot of boys are coming now again, tell people about your Twitter account where
[49:05.720 --> 49:06.720]  they find it all.
[49:06.720 --> 49:07.720]  Yeah.
[49:07.720 --> 49:10.760]  We don't want to talk trash, but I really do want to expose what happened at the March
[49:10.760 --> 49:13.840]  and why we went ahead and just took over our own event back from those that did.
[49:13.840 --> 49:17.120]  I'm not an infighter, but from what I've talked about, these particular people that have
[49:17.120 --> 49:19.960]  been involved trying to hijack our movements need to be stopped.
[49:19.960 --> 49:23.200]  Well, look, you can go to stop this deal.us.
[49:23.200 --> 49:28.160]  That is the only official authorized stop the seal website out there.
[49:28.160 --> 49:33.280]  We're really appreciative of all the grassroots work out there, but stop the seal.us features
[49:33.280 --> 49:36.360]  our coalition partners and we're always willing to work with anyone.
[49:36.360 --> 49:37.360]  Okay.
[49:37.360 --> 49:40.600]  But there is a phenomenon where then people go get permits, right?
[49:40.600 --> 49:43.120]  And then they take over and then say it's their event.
[49:43.120 --> 49:44.120]  Exactly.
[49:44.120 --> 49:45.360]  We don't care about the event or our name.
[49:45.360 --> 49:46.360]  We care about winning.
[49:46.360 --> 49:50.520]  We care about winning in the Electoral College and getting Donald Trump above 270.
[49:50.520 --> 49:54.320]  I happen to be a strategist, so I'm working with all of these folks, but yeah, we did
[49:54.320 --> 50:00.040]  have a vendor who secured the permit and then decided, oh, well, Alex can't speak and this
[50:00.040 --> 50:03.400]  person can't speak and that person can't speak and then this seal should speak and this
[50:03.400 --> 50:08.280]  rhino should speak and then made lies about the Trump family and that's going to come
[50:08.280 --> 50:12.240]  out later, but we're not going to tolerate our movement being hijacked.
[50:12.240 --> 50:13.240]  Well, that's right.
[50:13.240 --> 50:14.240]  I mean, I talked to the White House.
[50:14.240 --> 50:15.240]  Trump, you did too.
[50:15.240 --> 50:16.240]  Trump was going to come.
[50:16.240 --> 50:17.440]  We found out these people were running it.
[50:17.440 --> 50:19.240]  So that's the reason these ladies are a problem.
[50:19.240 --> 50:20.240]  Right.
[50:20.240 --> 50:23.200]  In the Georgia event, I announced that now they're coming to take it off.
[50:23.200 --> 50:26.400]  So now they put out a flyer that they're going to Georgia and they had Georgia featured
[50:26.400 --> 50:29.760]  as a blue state and they misspelled Georgia.
[50:29.760 --> 50:33.600]  So you, you and I were first to announce on our independent channels, remarking to Georgia
[50:33.600 --> 50:37.080]  and again, it's not about, we don't give a damn about credit is that these people come
[50:37.080 --> 50:38.440]  take over to block us.
[50:38.440 --> 50:39.440]  Right.
[50:39.440 --> 50:42.680]  And then they do media and their media says, oh, look at these disgusting freaks because
[50:42.680 --> 50:44.040]  you know, they don't present well.
[50:44.040 --> 50:45.160]  Look at these disgusting freaks.
[50:45.160 --> 50:46.480]  They're responsible for all they did.
[50:46.480 --> 50:48.960]  They told you not to talk about a stolen election.
[50:48.960 --> 50:52.400]  But no employer got up to speak and everybody, he's saying four more years, Trump on the
[50:52.400 --> 50:53.960]  election, they tried to jerk him off the stage.
[50:53.960 --> 50:54.960]  Yeah.
[50:54.960 --> 50:56.640]  He didn't even want us saying that he really won.
[50:56.640 --> 50:58.480]  Trump knew it was a rally about how he was the winner.
[50:58.480 --> 50:59.480]  Yeah.
[50:59.480 --> 51:00.480]  They didn't even want that.
[51:00.480 --> 51:01.480]  Yeah.
[51:01.480 --> 51:03.640]  It's all going to come out, you know, we, you know, we know the behind the scenes drama,
[51:03.640 --> 51:05.560]  Rogers involved in, in how we're going to correct it.
[51:05.560 --> 51:07.440]  My lawyers are involved in how we're going to correct it.
[51:07.440 --> 51:09.840]  I'm not going to tolerate any bull crap of anyone.
[51:09.840 --> 51:12.200]  I just want those folks to know that we're not going to take it.
[51:12.200 --> 51:13.200]  No.
[51:13.200 --> 51:14.200]  And guess what?
[51:14.200 --> 51:15.200]  They were sued out of the Tea Party movement.
[51:15.200 --> 51:16.440]  They were sued by the Trump campaign.
[51:16.440 --> 51:19.160]  And this was their way of trying to say, oh, look, we'll play nice.
[51:19.160 --> 51:21.360]  No, no, Trump was coming until he learned that they'd hijacked it.
[51:21.360 --> 51:22.360]  Good job, ladies.
[51:22.360 --> 51:23.360]  Yeah.
[51:23.360 --> 51:24.360]  Yeah.
[51:24.360 --> 51:25.360]  So, but we're focused.
[51:25.360 --> 51:29.480]  Look, 99% of the movement is focused on not denouncing each other, not disavowing each
[51:29.480 --> 51:31.480]  other, not distancing themselves from each other.
[51:31.480 --> 51:32.480]  I never do this either.
[51:32.480 --> 51:33.480]  I just had to throw that out there.
[51:33.480 --> 51:34.480]  Yeah.
[51:34.480 --> 51:37.560]  And, and, you know, thank God you did because we don't want the media to be confused.
[51:37.560 --> 51:40.920]  They're taking advantage, Alex, of the fact that I don't have time to do media.
[51:40.920 --> 51:41.920]  Okay.
[51:41.920 --> 51:45.200]  They're taking advantage of the fact that your deep platform, that Rogers deep platform,
[51:45.200 --> 51:49.960]  they're taking advantage of our movement and what we've done and we put bodies in the streets.
[51:49.960 --> 51:50.960]  That's all I care about.
[51:50.960 --> 51:52.120]  I don't want to get paid.
[51:52.120 --> 51:53.440]  I don't want anything else.
[51:53.440 --> 51:54.520]  I don't need the credit.
[51:54.520 --> 51:56.240]  My face isn't even on the website.
[51:56.240 --> 51:57.960]  It's about bodies in the street.
[51:57.960 --> 52:00.560]  Let's shift gears now and get into that.
[52:00.560 --> 52:01.560]  Well, let me say this.
[52:01.560 --> 52:04.480]  You have to scare the American oligarchs with our physical presence.
[52:04.480 --> 52:09.680]  I'll tell you, imagine what would have happened with 800,000 people if we wanted to do something.
[52:09.680 --> 52:10.880]  The oligarchs got scared by that.
[52:10.880 --> 52:13.680]  That's why they played it down and tried to suppress it because they're scared of you.
[52:13.680 --> 52:17.120]  And what did Thomas Jefferson say, when the government is scared of the people, there's
[52:17.120 --> 52:19.120]  liberty when people are scared of the government, there's caring.
[52:19.120 --> 52:20.120]  Amen.
[52:20.120 --> 52:23.320]  So they're the ones threatening us, telling us stay in our houses under martial law if
[52:23.320 --> 52:28.880]  Biden steals his way in, permanent lockdown, Bill Gates and Fauci say mask forever, social
[52:28.880 --> 52:30.120]  distancing forever.
[52:30.120 --> 52:31.520]  This is a takeover, folks.
[52:31.520 --> 52:33.120]  They're making us third world slaves.
[52:33.120 --> 52:34.120]  Damn them.
[52:34.120 --> 52:35.120]  We will not take it.
[52:35.120 --> 52:36.120]  I won't take it.
[52:36.120 --> 52:37.120]  I would rather die.
[52:37.120 --> 52:38.120]  I would rather die.
[52:38.120 --> 52:40.200]  Now, recap why George is so key.
[52:40.200 --> 52:41.800]  Robert Barnes is there.
[52:41.800 --> 52:44.200]  I know that Smart has been telling me for weeks, and you're absolutely right, the White House
[52:44.200 --> 52:45.200]  agrees.
[52:45.200 --> 52:47.640]  George is key because they want to certify the fraud there first.
[52:47.640 --> 52:50.880]  Remember, Trump was way ahead until they froze it.
[52:50.880 --> 52:51.880]  And now they're going back.
[52:51.880 --> 52:52.880]  They do spot recounts.
[52:52.880 --> 52:56.720]  They're finding two to one Trump ballots, and it's always the same algorithm number.
[52:56.720 --> 52:57.720]  Same thing in Michigan.
[52:57.720 --> 52:58.880]  I mean, this is all coming out.
[52:58.880 --> 53:02.040]  We have to not let them fraudulently certify this.
[53:02.040 --> 53:03.920]  We have to put pressure on the governor.
[53:03.920 --> 53:05.120]  What does the governor need to do?
[53:05.120 --> 53:06.520]  He needs to call a special session.
[53:06.520 --> 53:08.240]  He needs to call a special session.
[53:08.240 --> 53:12.600]  My recommendation, Governor Kemp, is that you keep it open through January 9th and then
[53:12.600 --> 53:16.440]  give them the broad oversight over the certification of the election.
[53:16.440 --> 53:17.440]  And that's in the Constitution.
[53:17.440 --> 53:20.360]  If there's a problem with the election, then it goes to legislature.
[53:20.360 --> 53:21.880]  They look at the evidence, and they decide.
[53:21.880 --> 53:22.880]  Right.
[53:22.880 --> 53:27.120]  And so while we could be in constitutional limbo, state constitutional limbo, with the
[53:27.120 --> 53:31.480]  governor not signing his certification, it is good for the country.
[53:31.480 --> 53:33.080]  It is good for Georgia.
[53:33.080 --> 53:37.000]  We have to settle the legal cases before we choose who the electors are.
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.640]  We can't send electors and then have a federal judge come back with a decision saying, well,
[53:41.640 --> 53:43.920]  you guys were right, but there's no legal remedy.
[53:43.920 --> 53:46.080]  So this gets into a lot of legal theory.
[53:46.080 --> 53:47.760]  We've got to have the legislatures.
[53:47.760 --> 53:51.640]  We have to show the privilege fraud, have legislatures in session to then go with the
[53:51.640 --> 53:52.640]  actual vote.
[53:52.640 --> 53:53.640]  Right.
[53:53.640 --> 53:54.640]  Exactly.
[53:54.640 --> 53:55.640]  Day of votes.
[53:55.640 --> 53:56.640]  Day of votes.
[53:56.640 --> 53:57.640]  Day of votes.
[53:57.640 --> 53:58.640]  This is what the Constitutional Convention was about.
[53:58.640 --> 53:59.640]  We are in revolutionary times.
[53:59.640 --> 54:00.640]  We are in constitutional times.
[54:00.640 --> 54:05.360]  And the state legislator deserves its constitutional rights, not some bureaucratic mess, statutory
[54:05.360 --> 54:06.360]  mess.
[54:06.360 --> 54:10.480]  Her lawyer, her chief lawyer, went and made the deal illegally outside the legislature
[54:10.480 --> 54:15.160]  to have the governor chief of staff who's on the payroll of these voting machine companies
[54:15.160 --> 54:17.440]  like Dominion to make this deal.
[54:17.440 --> 54:18.440]  That's illegal.
[54:18.440 --> 54:20.440]  And the courts have ruled in other states it's illegal.
[54:20.440 --> 54:21.440]  It's illegal.
[54:21.440 --> 54:22.440]  It's illegal.
[54:22.440 --> 54:23.440]  It's illegal.
[54:23.440 --> 54:24.440]  It's illegal.
[54:24.440 --> 54:25.440]  The governor doesn't make law.
[54:25.440 --> 54:26.440]  The legislature does.
[54:26.440 --> 54:28.320]  So the legislature must override that governor.
[54:28.320 --> 54:29.400]  He wants to get with the program.
[54:29.400 --> 54:30.400]  That's fine.
[54:30.400 --> 54:32.720]  If he doesn't, again, he's an enemy of America.
[54:32.720 --> 54:39.720]  We're both coming to Atlanta tonight, tonight, I'll be out there tonight, stay with us.
[55:02.720 --> 55:09.720]  And I'm going to be out there tonight, tonight, I'll be out there tonight, tonight, tonight,
[55:32.720 --> 55:40.040]  I'll be out there tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight.
[56:02.720 --> 56:07.040]  our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position
[56:07.040 --> 56:08.040]  us into debt.
[56:08.040 --> 56:13.080]  Well, now China owns the debt, now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals.
[56:13.080 --> 56:15.620]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on.
[56:15.620 --> 56:20.000]  But again, it wasn't that hard to see if foreign others admitted what they were doing.
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.360]  But still, others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[56:23.360 --> 56:24.360]  We did.
[56:24.360 --> 56:27.440]  And you focused on it by supporting us at InfoWars.
[56:27.440 --> 56:31.840]  So when you go to infowarsstore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts,
[56:31.840 --> 56:35.960]  films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that
[56:35.960 --> 56:38.560]  literally helped make up the world what's really happening.
[56:38.560 --> 56:40.560]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[56:40.560 --> 56:48.080]  I want to thank you for your support.
[56:48.080 --> 57:14.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:14.480 --> 57:16.060]  You're all in the military.
[57:16.060 --> 57:17.960]  They all had the name Trump on them.
[57:17.960 --> 57:21.680]  Vice President Biden, final question for you.
[57:21.680 --> 57:27.080]  Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted and will you pledge
[57:27.080 --> 57:31.480]  not to declare victory until the election is independently.
[57:31.480 --> 57:37.480]  I won't get to get what I'm after till the day I die.
[57:42.480 --> 57:44.480]  People tend to hate men.
[57:44.480 --> 57:46.480]  They're not equipped to...
[57:46.480 --> 57:48.480]  These people aren't equipped to handle it.
[57:48.480 --> 57:50.480]  Number one, number two, they cheat.
[57:50.480 --> 57:51.480]  They cheat.
[57:51.480 --> 57:56.480]  Hey, they found ballots in a waste paper basket three days ago,
[57:56.480 --> 57:58.480]  and they all had the name military ballots.
[57:58.480 --> 57:59.480]  They were military.
[57:59.480 --> 58:01.480]  They all had the name Trump on them.
[58:01.480 --> 58:02.480]  You think that's good?
[58:02.480 --> 58:04.480]  Vice President Biden, final question for you.
[58:04.480 --> 58:07.480]  Will you urge your supporters to stay calm
[58:07.480 --> 58:10.480]  while the vote is counted, and will you pledge
[58:10.480 --> 58:14.480]  not to declare victory until the election is independent and service?
[58:18.480 --> 58:19.480]  They heard him say yes.
[58:19.480 --> 58:21.480]  And he said that many, many other times.
[58:21.480 --> 58:24.480]  I mean, Trump needs to keep raising money
[58:24.480 --> 58:26.480]  and keep fighting to run ads, exposing these frauds.
[58:26.480 --> 58:27.480]  Yep.
[58:27.480 --> 58:29.480]  Because they're censoring him so bad everywhere else, isn't...
[58:29.480 --> 58:31.480]  I don't want to count two here, because I'm not proud of this,
[58:31.480 --> 58:32.480]  and I'm sad.
[58:32.480 --> 58:34.480]  But Trump and everybody else, they screwed the pooch
[58:34.480 --> 58:37.480]  letting the censorship go on and letting all of his amplifiers
[58:37.480 --> 58:39.480]  and influencers be cut off at the knees.
[58:39.480 --> 58:41.480]  Yeah, you know, and I don't want to do, I told you so either.
[58:41.480 --> 58:45.480]  But if the campaign in the RNC had listened to me after 2018,
[58:45.480 --> 58:49.480]  when we did Stop the Seal 2018 in Broward County,
[58:49.480 --> 58:52.480]  and we did Stop the Seal, and I told Ron and Ron and me Daniel.
[58:52.480 --> 58:54.480]  I said, this is coming for the country.
[58:54.480 --> 58:56.480]  And when they do it in four or five states,
[58:56.480 --> 58:59.480]  I was on your show, Alex, saying this will be worse than Al Vigore,
[58:59.480 --> 59:01.480]  because the states run the election,
[59:01.480 --> 59:04.480]  so the Supreme Court will have to take five or six different cases,
[59:04.480 --> 59:06.480]  and they can't cluster them together.
[59:06.480 --> 59:09.480]  I was on your show saying that in August, okay?
[59:09.480 --> 59:13.480]  And so if they had done that and they could solve the big tech issue,
[59:13.480 --> 59:15.480]  then we wouldn't be going through this.
[59:15.480 --> 59:17.480]  But because they can steal our elections
[59:17.480 --> 59:19.480]  and then tell most of the American public
[59:19.480 --> 59:23.480]  that we're conspiracy theorists, that we're just making stuff up,
[59:23.480 --> 59:27.480]  we can't get our message out, so Trump does need money for his legal battle
[59:27.480 --> 59:29.480]  and for advertising.
[59:29.480 --> 59:31.480]  You do need money for advertising,
[59:31.480 --> 59:33.480]  getting out the words and putting the boots on the ground.
[59:33.480 --> 59:34.480]  Let me ask you this question.
[59:34.480 --> 59:36.480]  Why aren't we seeing a lot of Trump?
[59:36.480 --> 59:38.480]  Because that's his bully pulpit power.
[59:38.480 --> 59:39.480]  He still has.
[59:39.480 --> 59:40.480]  Why has he been so...
[59:40.480 --> 59:42.480]  We saw a tweeting and saying, I won the election yesterday.
[59:42.480 --> 59:43.480]  That's not enough.
[59:43.480 --> 59:44.480]  I mean, he should be in Georgia.
[59:44.480 --> 59:45.480]  He should be having rallies.
[59:45.480 --> 59:47.480]  I keep hearing he's going to have these rallies.
[59:47.480 --> 59:48.480]  When do those come?
[59:48.480 --> 59:49.480]  So the rallies were going to come,
[59:49.480 --> 59:52.480]  and then there was a compromise reached inside the White House.
[59:52.480 --> 59:54.480]  So it's my first time talking about it.
[59:54.480 --> 59:57.480]  And what they decided was until these cases
[59:57.480 --> 1:00:00.480]  start making their way through the courts,
[1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:02.480]  Trump does not want to position himself
[1:00:02.480 --> 1:00:04.480]  where the courts can hold a tweet against him
[1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:06.480]  or a rally against him.
[1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:08.480]  And so his tweets are very concentrated.
[1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:10.480]  So the Democrats are everywhere declaring victory fraudulently,
[1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:13.480]  calling him a dictator, but he's afraid to speak out.
[1:00:13.480 --> 1:00:14.480]  That's ridiculous.
[1:00:14.480 --> 1:00:17.480]  It is ridiculous, but you'll notice that the courts held
[1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:21.480]  during the terrorism ban that was described as the Muslim ban,
[1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:23.480]  they held a tweet against him.
[1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:25.480]  DACA, they held a tweet against him.
[1:00:25.480 --> 1:00:28.480]  So Trump is trying to play the legal strategy smart.
[1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:31.480]  And it's torture, but he wants to get out there.
[1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:32.480]  He wants to do his rallies.
[1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:34.480]  There's plans to do rallies.
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:36.480]  And in the meantime, stop the steal.us.
[1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:39.480]  We will keep posting rallies every state capital.
[1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:41.480]  You're new in your local time
[1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:43.480]  until the Electoral College meets.
[1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:45.480]  And maybe after that, maybe after that,
[1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:47.480]  maybe we never give this country back to them.
[1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:49.480]  Well, let's explain this.
[1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:50.480]  They're globalists that want to end the country.
[1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:52.480]  They're trying to put us under permanent lockdown
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:54.480]  to economically bankrupt us
[1:00:54.480 --> 1:00:56.480]  so they can put us on universal income to control us
[1:00:56.480 --> 1:00:58.480]  in their own UN words.
[1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:01.480]  This is a UN takeover, Chaycom takeover.
[1:01:01.480 --> 1:01:02.480]  I mean, this is biblical.
[1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:05.480]  Ali, I wake up at night and feeling good.
[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:06.480]  And I go, oh my gosh.
[1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:08.480]  And I remember the mask and the tyranny and the lockdown,
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:09.480]  the new world order.
[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:11.480]  And I just wake up even though I knew all this was coming.
[1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:13.480]  I just, we're in it now.
[1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:14.480]  It's a totally different ballgame.
[1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:15.480]  We're in it.
[1:01:15.480 --> 1:01:16.480]  We're in it.
[1:01:16.480 --> 1:01:17.480]  We're in it.
[1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:18.480]  We're in it.
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:19.480]  And it's a nightmare.
[1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:20.480]  And it's just like you create a dream
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:21.480]  or we're living in my nightmare.
[1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:22.480]  And this is going to happen.
[1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:24.480]  As they take the resources away,
[1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:25.480]  more and more people are going to do more and more
[1:01:25.480 --> 1:01:26.480]  saying it's our fault.
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:28.480]  They'll just turn the economy back on
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:29.480]  if you take the shot.
[1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:30.480]  Or if you wouldn't criticize
[1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:31.480]  or if you'd send your kids for reeducation,
[1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:33.480]  I won't, I, I'm going bankrupt.
[1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:34.480]  And they're going to,
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:35.480]  and they're the ones that did it
[1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:37.480]  using the COVID lockdown to make you a slave.

[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:26.920]  A foreigner it's he rested as he went along his way
[1:03:26.920 --> 1:03:32.480]  What an incredible time to be alive when all it wants a mighty bunch. Yeah, I
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:37.440]  Predicted the 79 days of hell once they contest the election
[1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:42.800]  And they contested it by freezing it when Trump was winning then claiming that Biden won fraudulently
[1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:48.120]  And then when Trump tried to contest legally and lawfully they said that is illegitimate that is a dictator
[1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:54.120]  That's what Obama has now said Ali Alexander a great political analyst and also publisher is here with us
[1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:56.120]  He's been a tireless fighter
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:04:01.680]  With Roger Stone starting to start to steal a few years ago with Roger and then Roger's hand in the baton to him
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:04.880]  Roger's gonna be in Atlanta, Georgia tomorrow. I'm gonna be there tonight
[1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:09.440]  There's gonna be rallies around the governor's mansion first around the Capitol every day at noon
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:13.640]  And all that is available at the stop the steel website again
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:17.800]  I'm Alex Jones your host with news wars.com info wars.com and banned out video
[1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:22.680]  Remember big techs working around the clock to suppress all the articles and videos and evidence of fraud
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:27.880]  So Brian Stelter can go. There's no fraud, but it's they're making it up to you
[1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:33.720]  But we should shut down the media now Brian Stelter who has no viewers, but is the voice of Jeff Zucker
[1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:37.880]  Is saying shut down Newsmax shut down OEN
[1:04:37.960 --> 1:04:42.720]  We're a threat to democracy and then they say that we're the ones trying to shut down the press
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:48.440]  No, we're saying you're not the press your liars your anti-American your corporate PR hacks for the chai comms
[1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:54.000]  And then they turn around and say we're trying to shut them down when they're calling for it. Talk about gaslighting
[1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:59.240]  Gaslighting up the butt. I mean, it's just so dumb. They are
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.200]  Corporate
[1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:05.160]  Propagandists for China for the DNC. They don't care about viewers
[1:05:05.160 --> 1:05:11.680]  They don't care about money and it's all subsidized by big defense and big pharma and they're you know, Alex
[1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:12.680]  If they could kick us all off
[1:05:12.680 --> 1:05:17.840]  I'll tell you why Twitter and the rest of these companies now have labels because so many people have woken up
[1:05:17.840 --> 1:05:21.880]  So many people have woken up that now they have to resort to. Oh, well, we got to do labels
[1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:26.760]  I mean, they're let's say it in the authoritarian regime before it starts arresting everybody puts a label on a mix of more
[1:05:26.760 --> 1:05:30.840]  Yeah star. Oh, they mark us and I'm gonna tell you I got stickers that they stopped the steel
[1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:36.840]  And I'll gladly die with one on me because I believe in self-governing. I believe that God gave us Christian liberty
[1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:41.760]  I believe that Christianity was the magic potion that stabilize Western civilization
[1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:44.640]  Don't you agree they've bitten off more than they can share they may be able to even steal
[1:05:44.640 --> 1:05:47.800]  I hope not but man the awakening they've caused has been seismic
[1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:51.640]  It's been seismic and they're talking about and I'm gonna just leak out our plan Alex
[1:05:51.640 --> 1:05:56.480]  They've talked about doing. Oh, we're gonna elect Joe Biden and do a virtual inauguration
[1:05:56.840 --> 1:06:00.760]  Good, then Alex and I will fill the street with five million
[1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:06.000]  Patriots and Trump will be there will inaugurate president will inaugurate Donald because the Democrats said they were gonna do that
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:09.560]  Of Trump won. Yeah, if they would just break the country up. Well, we're not gonna break it up
[1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:13.440]  We're gonna reconstitute it. Yeah, if you guys want to act as insurrectionist
[1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:18.320]  Well, then we know how to deal with that, but we will bring tents. We will bring trucks. We will bring cars
[1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:22.960]  I agree. I think now is the time after Georgia to start occupying DC period
[1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:28.480]  I mean, I just think everybody should just go there spend a week more reinforcements come and we just we just occupy DC now
[1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:31.800]  Well, look if they try to treat us differently. We have
[1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:37.800]  Discrimination cases so I have in what in the wing in the way try to occupy with their homeless and their antifa
[1:06:37.800 --> 1:06:42.640]  We're just gonna occupy occupy movement and I told people they said what's your vision for stop the seal?
[1:06:42.640 --> 1:06:48.120]  I'll leave I said the tea party meets occupy. I'm one pissed off conservative now
[1:06:48.120 --> 1:06:52.120]  That's it. We occupy the mall. We occupy the grass in front of the Capitol. We just move in. I'll move in
[1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:59.040]  Let's do it Alex. I mean, I'm gonna go around Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan to lobby these state legislators
[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:05.600]  But we've got to occupy everywhere. It's our country. We are the majority Donald Trump probably won 80 million votes
[1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:11.040]  But we know of at least 70 3 million votes. That's right. Who believes buying more who believes buying up more than Obama?
[1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:14.680]  Nobody all we have a stacks of fraud. In fact, let's go over some of the stacks of fraud. Yes
[1:07:15.240 --> 1:07:19.000]  Don't forget how Obama was able to do this how he kept control the propaganda network
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:23.840]  Trump never got control of US repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news to Americans
[1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:27.120]  That's what Obama did. That's a foreign policy of the Washington Post
[1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:29.480]  Reporting that is to remind you of that
[1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:32.800]  Ban on domestic propaganda overturned by Obama
[1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:37.760]  New government propaganda bill a positive step for First Amendment. That's hilarious
[1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:44.320]  Now let's get to the actual news president Trump announces. He won the election as evidence of voter fraud pours in
[1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:51.240]  In if gambling sites have not called the presidential election. Why should we red state? Absolutely?
[1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:57.360]  It's not just legally not done. Biden team begs for 30 million to fight Trump lawsuits despite claiming election victory
[1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:01.040]  I mean, there's no way they're gonna win. Why does like Obama said? Why do they need money?
[1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:09.320]  Georgia County that use Dominion voting systems finds 2,500 votes after hand count almost all of them for you guys did Alex
[1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:15.320]  Trump Alex Dominion was the lowest bidder in most of these states in these 30 states where Dominion is
[1:08:15.320 --> 1:08:17.320]  They just magically were the lowest bidder and
[1:08:18.040 --> 1:08:22.360]  Venezuela was involved in the county and they were desertified on those other states, right?
[1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:30.320]  And in the Venezuela says a magic 1 million votes appeared in the Venezuela election of 2012 through the software that runs on
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:35.680]  Dominion, we know this is rigged. They're trying to run out the clock on us. It really pisses me off
[1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:44.640]  It's crazy. No, this is Trump. Georgia recount auditor claims multiple Trump ballots fraudulently called for Biden continuing breaking top lawyer releases
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.600]  Archive of 2020 fraud evidence. That's Bob Barnes
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:54.400]  Continuing ladies and gentlemen, it goes on and on election hacking software exposed by ex-military whistleblower
[1:08:54.400 --> 1:09:02.200]  We caught them part 5 competitive states once Biden gained the lead with massive vote dumps the remainder of all votes
[1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:08.640]  Possessed same Biden to Trump ratio. This is inconceivable. This is the most important article gateway pun
[1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:15.120]  I've looked this up. They they just did the same ratio over two to one for Biden because it was too hard to keep programming and doing
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:19.240]  The math they were lazy about it. They really and so it's the same algorithm. It's the same number
[1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:24.880]  It's it'd be like we got a card deck. You kept resheveling and a thousand times in a row. You pull the same card
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:32.360]  It's impossible God acts through math and math tells us that the Democrats cheated. I heard about this story before it went to print
[1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:34.800]  Joe Hoffed
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:39.880]  Did great work on this they hired a whole team to do it. Okay, this statistical analysis
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:42.560]  What Hoff does is a managerial statistical analysis, right?
[1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:49.200]  Corporate guy and they and and I'll tell you this, you know, Joe Hoff is a brother of Jim Hoff. He's an auditor. It's what he does. Yep, and and they got him dead
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:54.400]  Right, but I got to tell y'all Sidney Powell has this times a hundred
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:10:00.680]  It's going to shock the consciousness. He said we have the algorithm. We know what we can look at the out what are we waiting on?
[1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:02.760]  Yeah
[1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:08.960]  They need to because what they don't understand what they're not thinking about is judges still have to come up with a legal remedy
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:13.560]  And we have what's called a safe harbor date by December 6th or December 8th
[1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:19.200]  So it's not just December 14th when the Electoral College meets. We have to assign them by December
[1:10:19.200 --> 1:10:21.480]  So we need a decisive victory now and not now
[1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:28.720]  Absolutely videos project Veritas Georgia recount honor is called multiple ballots for Joe Biden
[1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:33.760]  They're actually marked for president reply that in a moment. Get that ready guys. Very powerful gateway pundit
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:40.760]  Ask DOJ to investigate Michigan Attorney General suppression of vote fraud news threatening to arrest the media that had all the proof
[1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:46.200]  And recorded her people engaging in in how to engage in fraud. This looks like something out of Eastern Europe
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:51.440]  They're gonna. They're gonna sell her goes. There's no evidence and they have none and they should be on air
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:57.080]  Don't go watch them because we have hours and hours of evidence a day. It's ridiculous
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:00.080]  Mark Geist would be proud of that impression
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:05.480]  Well, I mean, I'm not saying Mark ripped me off. He's done a great job, but I was already doing it. I believe that
[1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:11.880]  But I mean, he's the first one to sink the voice at the same time where it's actually what he said
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:16.880]  But he does it. It's the funniest thing ever the courts will likely overturn the election results in numerous jurisdictions
[1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:22.480]  To devote fraud in the data where the amount of election fraud can be quantified and estimated
[1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:25.440]  Well, yeah, when you have a straight-up line like that, you know, it's a fraud
[1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:32.200]  You know human behavior mass psychology or sciences, are the Democrats gonna tell us they don't believe in science anymore science?
[1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:37.520]  Well, they told us 2.5 million will be dead from COVID six months ago. None of that was true
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:39.520]  So that they just go science science
[1:11:40.920 --> 1:11:42.480]  Murderous liars
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:44.480]  And it keeps going from here whistleblower
[1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:50.600]  Democrats stole votes for Joe Biden from every developmentally disabled person in Milwaukee homes
[1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:56.960]  She spoke with and that's how it works. Who are most the sex changes the four sex changes a little boys autistic
[1:11:57.520 --> 1:11:59.840]  Breaking Trump gains at least 1,600 votes
[1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:06.760]  Biden and 800 in Georgia recount at her Floyd County finds 2,600 ballots not counted. That's one County
[1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:13.600]  What happened Georgia has 159 counties? I want to check the signatures check them all we won Georgia
[1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:20.080]  Look at this since election day over 100 of the 243 dominion employees on LinkedIn had deleted their profiles
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:24.280]  Wow, don't want to hear that that doesn't look guilty at all
[1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:29.120]  Wisconsin elections Commission refuses to do a recount let's Trump pay 7.5 million. All right
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:36.320]  I haven't gotten to the tip of the iceberg on this. It's all coming up with Ali Alexander and the man that runs the Eagle Forum for the great
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:40.600]  Phyllis Schlafly who God rest her amazing soul will be joining us Ed
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:48.600]  Martin straight ahead on what comes next then after Ali leaves us the great reset latest intel a lockdown to how to fight it and your phone
[1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:50.600]  Calls stay with us America
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:55.960]  Talk about tomorrow's news today. This is all very transparent when you wore game it out
[1:12:56.600 --> 1:13:02.200]  Six months ago in four wars predicted the mail-in ballots would be used to steal the election from Trump
[1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:09.360]  They would simply pause the voting at night and that have an unlimited number that they had in reserve to bring forward in battleground states
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:11.360]  To secure the victory and now that happened
[1:13:11.360 --> 1:13:17.320]  Now what else did I predict a few months ago and again last week and again last night all on record that when Joe Biden
[1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:19.320]  Was president-elect?
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:21.240]  Via fraud Trump would challenge it
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:26.920]  But Biden's next move would be to form his own COVID task force say that Trump is inept and has killed
[1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:33.640]  267,000 Americans which isn't true and demand Trump's removal via the 25th amendment if he doesn't let
[1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:36.920]  Joe Biden's new COVID task force give all the new orders
[1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:40.720]  They'll tell Trump that if he backs down and follows their orders and steps down
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:41.720]  They won't blame it for COVID
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:45.000]  But if he does that they're gonna blame it for cove but then if he does do what they say
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:49.640]  He's talking about many ways plus. This has meant for martial law destroy the economy. I warned you all
[1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:52.520]  You know something very sad is happening
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:58.040]  It's very sad because it was all avoidable two and a half years ago when info wars got banned off of more than 60 major
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:14:03.480]  Platforms I warned everybody that was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election
[1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:11.520]  And that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until effectively there was a total internet kill switch in
[1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:15.560]  Place against conservatives nationals and populace and now that's happened
[1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:22.160]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that demonstrate and protests using a second
[1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:27.160]  COVID-19 lockdown and that Trump need to get out front and fully repudiate
[1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:29.680]  COVID-19 is basically an overblown hoax
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:33.080]  He started to do that the last few months of the campaign
[1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:39.320]  But we have to understand that that's the pincer attack. They're going to use they're going to use black lives matter and race war
[1:14:39.320 --> 1:14:45.160]  To stir up the American people and divide us and they're going to use economic warfare shredding down the economy to try to control us
[1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:50.200]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air. Tell me what's coming next
[1:14:50.200 --> 1:15:14.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show he never gives up
[1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:20.040]  He's Alex Jones broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas
[1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:32.320]  One of the greatest pleasures I have in the fighting against tyranny is all the great people I get to meet and I just think about the amazing job
[1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:38.480]  Project Veritas does how amazing it we pundit is how amazing all the you the listeners of viewers are how amazing info wars is and
[1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:45.480]  Ali Alexander and Ed Martin everybody else and just how we're this great coalition of Americans fighting for justice and freedom against incredible odds
[1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:49.880]  But we keep fighting back and most of the time winning thanks to God's good graces and providence
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:53.600]  But I want to project Veritas this morning. I was already there last night and I spent like an hour
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:16:01.440]  Just bombshell after bombshell after bombshell they've proven the elections of fraud with admittedly paying people for votes in Texas
[1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:04.760]  to just whistleblowers at the USPS
[1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:07.440]  hundreds of whistleblowers
[1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:11.240]  Breaking project Veritas Georgia recount auditors called multiple ballots
[1:16:11.920 --> 1:16:14.480]  For Joe Biden that were actually marked for president
[1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:17.960]  Trump and this is just one of the many witnesses. Here's the video
[1:16:19.640 --> 1:16:23.680]  Project Veritas has insiders in the Georgia recount that are catching votes
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:26.360]  wrongly attributed to Biden
[1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:38.360]  Check this out
[1:16:56.360 --> 1:17:00.440]  The only reason I left that table is because there was one where the first person is reading it off handing it to her
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:05.440]  She's not even looking at she's just putting it at putting it in which set what I won the first person set
[1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:12.320]  So table 17 was the first one where the woman got it wrong three times on table 18
[1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:16.600]  Was where the first person's call outside in her trunk
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:20.840]  Passed across the table the other person did not even look at it
[1:17:20.840 --> 1:17:27.720]  Just put it wherever the first person said that person is supposed to be auditing and checking the second one and so here's what happened after that
[1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:31.320]  So I go and report it. They say, oh, we'll talk to the election officials
[1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:35.680]  They tell her hey, I guess they talked to her and
[1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:40.720]  So I come back by again in a few minutes. She's not doing it after they've talked to her
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:43.120]  So I come stand next to her and she goes like this
[1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:49.600]  Like being all cutie about being exactly snarky. Yeah, so I keep walking I turn around
[1:17:49.600 --> 1:17:54.320]  And she's looking at me walking away. I she's getting hammered more balanced. She's watching me
[1:17:54.440 --> 1:17:55.840]  That's when things start going
[1:17:55.840 --> 1:18:00.680]  There are hours and hours on the veritas side of stuff like this and it's all on the spot
[1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:05.480]  They've gone and checked it. It's happening. The media tries to deny it or there's a whistleblower
[1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:12.760]  That's usp as they go that person recanted and the person releases audio of the FBI or the postal service inspector general
[1:18:12.840 --> 1:18:17.400]  Operative threatening them and saying yeah, we're here to threaten you. I mean this is gangster stuff
[1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:24.240]  They're going for broke Ed Martin's been coming on the show for probably 16 17 years. It's been too long been a few years
[1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:30.920]  He is the president of Phyllis Schafer. He's amazing Eagle forum. He's also attorney works in the Republican National Committee
[1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:35.400]  I can't go over so bio would take hours Twitter at you at Eagle Ed Martin
[1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:42.920]  Parlor at Ed Martin Ed Martin alive calm and we got a few minutes of this segment long was longer segment coming up
[1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:48.520]  But what would you describe this moment in history that we're in right now? It's just so epic with
[1:18:48.680 --> 1:18:53.880]  CNN everybody gaslighting saying there's no evidence of fraud and now not just info wars, but
[1:18:54.880 --> 1:19:01.320]  OAN and and Newsmax need to be silenced. I mean these people are the bad guys. It's it's unbelievable
[1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:05.680]  No, it is Alex and I got to tell you I'm excited to be back on with it has been too long
[1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:10.760]  You know my old mentor the late Phyllis Schlafly. She enjoyed being on with you your program
[1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:15.920]  She also thought you were fighting so often exactly the way we needed it. So thanks for doing that look
[1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:20.800]  It's a battle for the Republic what we know now Alex and you've been talking about it for decades
[1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:26.240]  I mean really the corruption in this country the rot in our institutions
[1:19:26.240 --> 1:19:29.840]  Well first we thought it was just you know sort of the corporate control over us
[1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:32.600]  Then we thought it was the media then we thought it was the deep state now
[1:19:32.600 --> 1:19:36.600]  We see it's the elections and if we don't save this election
[1:19:36.600 --> 1:19:43.400]  You can't say the Republic advances the same way because we quite literally we then are really
[1:19:43.600 --> 1:19:47.200]  Ruled by the people who game the system who are corrupt in the system
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:53.000]  So, you know Ali and I stood down there you were there with us half a million people at least in DC that understand
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:58.680]  What we the people want, but I gotta tell you all your listeners all your viewers all the people that hear this on on whatever
[1:19:58.680 --> 1:20:01.920]  You know secondary media. They've got to understand the moment
[1:20:01.920 --> 1:20:09.440]  It's it truly is a get to the get to the the vanguard moment because we lose this one and we're losing something
[1:20:09.440 --> 1:20:11.200]  We won't be able to get back
[1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:14.720]  Let me ask you both this fix it was a question. I was thinking about asking you before he came on
[1:20:15.360 --> 1:20:17.200]  Is this the end of the Republic? No
[1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:22.440]  I think it's a crippling and then we have to fight truly as a rebel force and they're gonna come after all of us
[1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:25.080]  Which I know we will surmount and win it'll make us stronger
[1:20:25.080 --> 1:20:31.800]  But we really need to mobilize now because the enemy has taken the gloves off and they are really coming for our blood
[1:20:31.880 --> 1:20:36.000]  What would you describe this moment of their able to steal this election that shy come back?
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:41.280]  I mean, I think this is a foreign occupation force of China with MSM and the Liberals
[1:20:41.280 --> 1:20:46.160]  I mean, I think it's a legal occupation force Ali. I think it's a refounding of America
[1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:51.280]  That's the opportunity if they do steal this and they take over the infrastructure in the institution
[1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:57.880]  There is an opportunity to call forth those moral arguments the same one. We're gonna have to execute
[1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:01.080]  1776 it'll have to commence again
[1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:08.480]  Well, I don't know but what I do know is that smart men Newt Gringrich ourselves other people are gonna get together and say
[1:21:08.520 --> 1:21:13.840]  What are our options endowed to us by God and those are the legitimate options?
[1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:18.760]  And then we will find our legal options and I'm telling you I'm not gonna live under oppression and of
[1:21:18.760 --> 1:21:24.200]  End of story. That's right. We the compliance and submission is is
[1:21:25.200 --> 1:21:26.640]  basically
[1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:31.960]  Supporting it but Alex and here's the thing before before you had is we're the majority
[1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:39.520]  Spoiler alert, we're the majority and now we've demonstrated that how come we've had two consecutive weeks have stopped the steel rallies in 50 state capitals
[1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:43.040]  And how come on the house back? How come we kept the Senate to spot all the fraud?
[1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:44.960]  We're the Biden rallies. We're the Biden
[1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:49.800]  They're in there. They're in their death rows. We'll talk about next segment edge. Go ahead. Well, what I want to say though
[1:21:49.800 --> 1:21:53.560]  Is this I want to be a little bit less optimistic and Ali if we lose this right now?
[1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:59.360]  What the what the powers that be have done is look for a way to take us down for about four years
[1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:03.400]  They tried the Russia hoax. They tried silencing Alex and everybody else now
[1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:06.240]  They got COVID they're gonna put us under martial law exactly
[1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:10.760]  They got COVID they're trying the Ukraine tried and if they can break us this way
[1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:16.640]  Don't think that Susan Rice and the guys that get back in control are gonna go softer this time
[1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:21.520]  I don't care Tom cotton Tom cotton went on TV and said we'll never confirm Susan Rice
[1:22:21.560 --> 1:22:26.080]  Who the hell cares who's confirmed by the Senate if they're sitting in the Oval Office
[1:22:26.920 --> 1:22:31.080]  Unmasking Americans and frankly Alex all we've ever heard is unmasking
[1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:37.040]  Do you really think Obama and the Oval Office the folks hatching that plan stopped it unmasking?
[1:22:37.040 --> 1:22:42.060]  Or do you think they were destroying Americans? Of course, they were using all the force and unleash
[1:22:42.480 --> 1:22:47.160]  Biden in his bunker and Camilla and the gang and yeah, we'll fight back
[1:22:47.240 --> 1:22:51.320]  But it's a much more daunting than just oh we got banned on Twitter
[1:22:51.320 --> 1:22:58.240]  No, no, they're coming with a force of government and they'll come in for you and me Ali and every other person who puts their head up
[1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:00.760]  And there's such arrogant crazy
[1:23:00.760 --> 1:23:06.520]  Daughtering people led by by Biden. They're they're gonna go for Brooke and stay there
[1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:08.240]  I want to talk about this because
[1:23:08.240 --> 1:23:13.000]  They are saying they want to burn us down. They want to level the Trump supporters. They want seeds
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:15.840]  They want to break the American people. They want to make us go on welfare
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:22.280]  They want to control us and this is that process of breaking that they say they're about to do with the great reset
[1:23:22.880 --> 1:23:27.480]  It's worked everywhere else. So why shouldn't they try it here? This is the great moment of truth
[1:23:27.480 --> 1:23:30.920]  I'm optimistic on one side, but I'm also very very dire on the other
[1:23:30.920 --> 1:23:33.760]  That's why everybody must mobilize in these key states straight ahead
[1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:40.200]  So let's talk about what's about to happen if they win and how we stopped that with Ed Martin Ali Alexander and your host Alex Jones
[1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:45.960]  info wars.com news wars.com tomorrow's news today, and don't forget to share the links to band on video
[1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:54.560]  Remember Hillary Clinton remember Pelosi remember Bill Clinton remember Obama all of them said
[1:23:54.560 --> 1:23:57.560]  We are not gonna concede if there's a red mirage
[1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:03.320]  We believe it's gonna look like Trump's gonna win in the landslide because they had the internal polls and indeed Trump won
[1:24:03.840 --> 1:24:09.400]  Most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin and we was set to win the other ones they froze
[1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:11.880]  the seven states on
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:17.080]  Election night and then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had this is completely transparent
[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:19.280]  So when they say that he is president elect
[1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:25.120]  He's not Trump is not conceded none of the states have certified the vote and now all these investigations have been opened up and
[1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:31.640]  Avalanche's mountains oceans of election fraud has come out and already been documented in Georgia
[1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:38.960]  Officials are on record saying we've already found fraud. So ladies and gentlemen the fixes in they've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:43.840]  Because the last hoax failed but now this is the mother of all hoaxes and if they get away with this
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:48.360]  It's the end of America as we know it. We will be Venezuela info wars.com

[1:25:56.400 --> 1:26:00.680]  I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors deviant against their own species
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:03.320]  Deviant against the order of nature
[1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:06.040]  Even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous
[1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:13.200]  They still do it because they want to play God everything they touch they destroy their their sacrament is aborting babies and then
[1:26:13.560 --> 1:26:19.080]  Using their body parts their their religion is not taking care of the old but euthanizing them
[1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:24.360]  Their whole system is designed for the UN to keep their world countries in serious poverty and poor
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:29.680]  Ballooning populations and then watching all that new fruit down the vine to continually
[1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:36.240]  Reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again. They truly are the children of Satan. They are the children of the devil
[1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:42.720]  Have you look at the slaves that serve the bite and the Kamala Harris it really is manifested being a slave of Satan is not profitable
[1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:47.320]  Sin is not profitable. I'm Alex Jones, and this is the info war
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:55.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:26:55.080 --> 1:27:13.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:27:26.040 --> 1:27:32.760]  Back at the start of the war in 1776. I'm already very accomplished naval captain who'd
[1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:35.680]  fought for the British and others
[1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:38.200]  John Paul Jones
[1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:41.440]  It's really a Scott. He changed his name to Jones. How does it any?
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:44.120]  was off the coast and
[1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:51.440]  Was fighting a frigate about three times his size and he was beginning to sink and the British soldier yelled over his bullhorn
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:53.840]  not not a mechanical one, but a
[1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:58.480]  Hailing device and said give up. We'll give you quarter and he said quarter
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:03.000]  Surrender I've only begun to fight. We were in a much better position than John Paul Jones
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:07.280]  He ended up taking over the other ship even though his ship sunk. That's the founder of the US Navy
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:10.440]  We've only begun to fight Ed Martin get into the big picture
[1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:15.320]  I know Trump is set to come out and expose that this is a chai-kong blood operation
[1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:20.440]  This is literally the takeover of our country and then Biden means to put us under permanent martial law
[1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:23.280]  Bill Gates the UN
[1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:24.240]  a
[1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:26.520]  Schwab of the deboss group
[1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:29.480]  Have all said this is a permanent lockdown
[1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:35.480]  Clough Schwab. I mean, this is so draconian people are really starting to freak out. They're really starting to get it
[1:28:35.480 --> 1:28:38.600]  This is a UN corporate world government chai-kong takeover
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:45.080]  You're a smart lawyer have the Eagle Forum on the Republican National Committee highest levels Tucker Carlson sounds like Alex Jones now
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:47.480]  It's not us making this up
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:52.160]  This is in the shadows before we were worried the UN habits on the drawing board now
[1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:55.480]  The New York Times says the UN should intervene and run our elections
[1:28:55.480 --> 1:29:01.600]  I mean dear they're really making their move using the virus as the fear to control us and they is the good guys
[1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:05.480]  Even though Fauci and Gates are involved with the virus at the Wuhan lab
[1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:09.520]  So give us the inside, you know intel from your sources about what we're really facing
[1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:15.680]  Well, listen first of all, you know the late fellow Schlafly. She was the first person in 1964
[1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:21.800]  She wrote a book a choice not an echo in which she said the corruption in the Republican Party is being dominated by the East
[1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:29.200]  Coast elites and she referred to the Bilderbergers for the first time she like you Alex recognize the globalist movement
[1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:35.140]  It's world communism, but it's also world globalist wealth and control is on the move and again
[1:29:35.440 --> 1:29:39.640]  Sometimes when you have the most progress Donald Trump has given us the most progress
[1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:46.160]  He's exposed how the globalist movement wanted to control our media. They wanted to control our jobs
[1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:51.880]  They wanted to control our deep state. There you go all these things that you that are being controlled by the globalist
[1:29:52.160 --> 1:29:57.560]  Covid kicks in and you see the health care is going to be run out of the UN and other world organizations
[1:29:57.560 --> 1:30:03.080]  We make all this progress with Trump and now they're saying watch us undercut that and we'll take you back
[1:30:03.480 --> 1:30:09.920]  Faster to the dark ages that you have never recognized and we almost like you took one step forward and ten back because if
[1:30:10.040 --> 1:30:13.360]  Trump doesn't hold the line here and we don't expose the corruption
[1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:18.600]  Look what people are saying about this Alex is that this election was hacked and when I say hacked
[1:30:18.600 --> 1:30:23.720]  It wasn't give me a break with CNN. It wasn't widespread. You don't rob all the banks in a city
[1:30:23.720 --> 1:30:26.320]  You rob the bank that has the money where you can get away
[1:30:26.520 --> 1:30:28.760]  They didn't rob all the election systems
[1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:34.420]  They hacked the ones that would swing the election and that's what they're trying to do so look you got to fight back on this
[1:30:34.420 --> 1:30:36.520]  But you're right to put it in context. It's
[1:30:37.480 --> 1:30:38.680]  1776 right now
[1:30:38.680 --> 1:30:43.920]  We've lost a lot of battles and we're sitting in Valley Forge looking over at Trenton and people are saying damn
[1:30:43.920 --> 1:30:49.240]  It's cold, but you know what you got to get in you got to go because either we're gonna come out the other side
[1:30:49.520 --> 1:30:56.320]  Shining forth and free or you're gonna be broken and we're gonna be talking about how to send secret signals to each other
[1:30:56.320 --> 1:31:00.520]  You know because we can't be communicating other ways and I don't think that's an exaggeration
[1:31:00.520 --> 1:31:07.120]  I think we're on the brink of a dark age or we're on the brink of a golden age and right now it's up for grabs and
[1:31:07.120 --> 1:31:13.120]  They admit that that they say at Davos. We're creating a new feudalist system. We're gonna make you poor for your own good
[1:31:13.120 --> 1:31:18.960]  We're gonna depopulate you but they have jumbo jets and live on top mountain tops and at 50,000 acre palatial
[1:31:19.320 --> 1:31:21.320]  Manners I mean these people are crazy
[1:31:21.520 --> 1:31:27.420]  Yeah, yeah, and look again you do you say something there follow the money Alex. It's always about the money you watch
[1:31:27.420 --> 1:31:29.420]  You know two days ago
[1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:35.200]  Carl Roeva announces he's gonna raise a hundred million dollars to fight for Georgia Senate seats
[1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:38.000]  And if you're normal you say what the hell does that mean?
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:44.160]  We got a presidential fight on our hands and you know why because the hundred million dollars that's raised by Carl Roeva Alex
[1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:48.280]  It gets spent a hundred million dollars worth on media buys on
[1:31:48.680 --> 1:31:55.280]  Consultants on employees and we the people here saying we're about to lose our president because no one will stand up and fight
[1:31:55.480 --> 1:32:01.440]  Carl Roeva or anybody else who cares about we the people would be in the trenches and stop the steel
[1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:07.120]  They'd be in the trenches right now calling for the impeachment of the governor of Georgia or the secretary
[1:32:08.640 --> 1:32:10.640]  Thanks
[1:32:11.320 --> 1:32:16.400]  Historian has said this is the end of the country potentially and this is the worst thing he's seen in his life
[1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:20.600]  I mean that's what this is and we should see Carl Roeva standing up
[1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:26.280]  But instead he's like George W. Bush and the rest of them they're all sitting on the sidelines laughing because they're globalist
[1:32:26.280 --> 1:32:33.680]  Yeah, well and but importantly Alex one of the great gifts of this time is we're sort of seeing everybody come out from behind the curtain
[1:32:33.680 --> 1:32:38.560]  Right, I mean I even you and I could have sat down and we would have said is the media this bad
[1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:43.440]  And we you and I would have said we think Fox News is bad too, but but well, I don't know now
[1:32:43.440 --> 1:32:49.760]  We see it right there. I totally agree. It's worse than I thought it would be the total alignment of disinfo is shocking
[1:32:49.760 --> 1:32:56.720]  They're discipline of fraud is unprecedented and also the exposure for example of the of the deep state, right?
[1:32:56.720 --> 1:32:59.280]  For five years ago, you and I would have talked about the deep state
[1:32:59.280 --> 1:33:02.640]  We would have had all these assert now we see the FBI was broken, right?
[1:33:02.640 --> 1:33:08.080]  We see the Department of Justice totally broken people are we should be devastated by these institutions
[1:33:08.080 --> 1:33:14.800]  But the point is one guy's been at the head of the spear. It's not his movement. You know, there was one Washington
[1:33:14.800 --> 1:33:15.520]  There's one Trump
[1:33:15.520 --> 1:33:21.440]  It's not the end of the army, but we've got to realize if we walk away from Washington if you walk away from Trump
[1:33:21.440 --> 1:33:28.240]  You're walking away from the future from Washington on we had America from Trump on if he walked away from him
[1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:35.320]  What do we get and and we have to rally for Trump and ourselves in this bulwark and and the enemy knows you just a week ago
[1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:38.160]  They thought they were invincible. They're scared now. They're freaking out
[1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:44.520]  They know we're gonna win these cases, but we've just got to hit the streets all 50 capitals starting Georgia tomorrow
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:50.160]  Add other key battleground areas with your Eagle form analysis. You think we need to be it?
[1:33:50.360 --> 1:33:54.920]  Well, I think Pennsylvania. I think it's a big five, right? Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania
[1:33:55.120 --> 1:33:57.120]  You mentioned Georgia also, Arizona
[1:33:57.120 --> 1:34:03.440]  Look, you know when you look at this election when they realized again the plan was not one facet
[1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:06.440]  They the globalists all these people they got multiple ways. They do it
[1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:11.560]  They were looking at the election. They're stealing absentees. They're stealing mail and they're stealing this then they looked and they said
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:14.760]  Oh, we might still get beat they went to five big cities
[1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:20.240]  They said Atlanta, Philadelphia, Michigan, Milwaukee, Detroit, Milwaukee and Maricopa County
[1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:25.560]  Flip the steel turn it on baby crank it up and they did it. So we got to be focused like a laser
[1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:30.120]  I'll take California. We could do that another year. We'll take them back right now. It's Pennsylvania
[1:34:30.120 --> 1:34:38.120]  It's a big one Michigan's a big one Wisconsin right now and Maricopa where the illegals and the leftists have tried to change the whole
[1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:43.760]  Country in one County. I've got reports Alex of planes landing in the morning of November 4th
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:50.560]  I see the manifest from Seoul, South Korea into Maricopa County and whistleblowers with eyes on
[1:34:51.160 --> 1:34:55.040]  Ballots in bags. I'm telling you this isn't hard to figure out
[1:34:55.040 --> 1:35:01.360]  This game is on and we got to stick to those five places and be on our game because we got five
[1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:08.200]  Legislatures that can be heroic. They can be the founding fathers of the next American Golden Age
[1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:14.960]  Or we can make them traders for the rest of their lives and history if they walk away totally agree Ed Martin

[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:54.200]  We get there and just try to recognize the situation, but what are we gonna cover in this final segment coming up?
[1:35:55.440 --> 1:35:57.240]  You know that's in chills through my spine
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:02.440]  There's an opportunity right now to be a part of the recommitment to Christian liberty
[1:36:02.480 --> 1:36:09.560]  That shining city on the hill that protects the most vulnerable around the world with us first them second or
[1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:17.120]  We assign ourselves a slavery to the chai comms. It's just that simple and so all of these guys
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:19.320]  I'm so proud to be working with you Alex and you Ed
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:26.400]  We've got to rush the gates. We've got to be the barbarians that rush the gates in the castle or we're all dead
[1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:34.200]  It's really that simple. So I'm signing my death warrant. It's liberty or it's death Alex. I think you're in the same boat
[1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:38.880]  Oh, I'm way past. I'm total commitment every cell of my body is commanding me to take action
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:41.720]  Oh, I'm not in control. Well, they're right back stay weathers
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:45.240]  The Intel straight ahead in a whole hour your calls and the very recent news
[1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:51.440]  When President Trump said that the mainstream corporate media was the enemy of America
[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:57.000]  He really was telling the truth. They don't just work for the Communist Chinese and the globalist in the EU and the whole Hollywood
[1:36:57.560 --> 1:37:04.000]  America hating God hating crude they literally say that they are in control of our minds and believe they do
[1:37:04.440 --> 1:37:08.320]  Own us and tell us who the president is even though that's not in law
[1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:13.320]  And they're just gaslighting the whole public over and over again saying Joe Biden's president-elect
[1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:19.920]  Repeating it over and over you know like a brainwashing mantra when it's up again to the state government to certify those votes
[1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:23.480]  And those votes for being challenged. There's massive evidence of fraud again
[1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:25.680]  This is so incredibly clear
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:32.600]  Biden said because he thought he was gonna lose up front that oh, we're gonna challenge the vote no matter what until every votes counted
[1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:36.160]  Well, a lot of those have been counted and there's massive fraud being discovered
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:40.920]  So we're gonna hold the course here because Joe Biden is a Communist Chinese agent. He's a globalist
[1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:46.880]  He wants carbon taxes people destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us. This is war
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:51.880]  It's all on record Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford
[1:37:51.880 --> 1:37:57.120]  They were all hired a year ago and then against six months ago to war game
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:02.520]  How to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic and how to get the public to take
[1:38:02.800 --> 1:38:10.840]  Anoculations and they talk about calling people heroes that do it. They talk about shaming those that don't this is all been psychologically tested
[1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:18.760]  It's all been psychologically prepared and once they get you to lock down for 15 days, you notice now. They say it's permanent
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:25.680]  That's how it works. Oh, just put these handcuffs on the serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be alright
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:27.200]  No
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:33.040]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killers fan. He's taking us to his
[1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:38.960]  Shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death. That's the allegory. We got a bust out of this thing now
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:41.600]  We got to say no now. We got to make a run for it now
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:47.320]  We still can once he gets us in that basement. It's gonna get a lot a lot worse folks. So stop submitting

[1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:00.800]  Meanwhile, Biden says he's getting classified material

[1:42:15.840 --> 1:42:17.840]  but front and center
[1:42:18.760 --> 1:42:23.600]  You you I was already talking to some whiteout sources last night that Trump's getting ready to go public with China
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:27.280]  Now China's behind this which is true. It's the right thing to plan to Americans
[1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:30.720]  They have common sense though with us. We have the evidence don't listen to the gas lighters
[1:42:30.720 --> 1:42:37.160]  But you separately when you got on the air brought up big China stuffs about to come out and the Sydney Powell has these giant bomb shells
[1:42:37.160 --> 1:42:42.320]  Give give us some of I know you I know you talk to these folks. They tell me they do. Tell me what you got for us
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:44.800]  So I'll just say Mongolia
[1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:47.760]  2012
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:50.600]  Dominion we caught you bastards and
[1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:57.960]  They brought it over here and they made sure that they were the lowest bid in many of these 30 states that are using this
[1:42:58.200 --> 1:43:04.080]  Crap machine and using rig software and we caught you and in 2012
[1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:10.000]  Also, Venezuela 1 million magic votes for the authoritarian left
[1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:14.800]  We caught you and so what they're trying to do is run out the clock because I get it
[1:43:14.800 --> 1:43:21.600]  This is gonna be a stressful time for our Republic. It's how do you know what I talked about this on your show in September or August?
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:23.480]  How do you know what you know?
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:27.480]  You know, this is what I think that Stanley Kubrick met behind the monolith
[1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:32.160]  How do you know what you know, you know the story of the Bible tells us the Apple?
[1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:38.840]  It's it's knowledge the media is what we've come to rely on to tell us news and events they're liars
[1:43:38.840 --> 1:43:43.480]  It's propaganda. It's conditioning. We don't actually have a free press
[1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:49.920]  We don't actually have an institution that a hundred and fifty to three hundred million Americans are participating in that has
[1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:51.680]  Universal
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:58.200]  Chronological order of events and so America's gonna find out very soon. Hopefully today at latest tomorrow that
[1:43:58.200 --> 1:44:04.240]  Well, if they're not telling the truth and these this is the truth, who are we gonna continue to get the truth from and that's gonna
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:07.600]  Be a very scary moment for the American public as they get their first red pill
[1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:11.600]  And I'll tell you first big red pill is you guys put that back on screen, please
[1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:18.880]  His whole transition team are anti free speech people euthanasia people pro-China people
[1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:25.200]  I mean folks that want quote reparations, which just means literally saying whites are slaves now to somebody else
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:30.680]  When they never committed that crime. I mean this is a legion of crazy control freaks
[1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:37.520]  Just trying to split this country down the middle. They're trying to split apart this country, you know, maybe the info wards episode
[1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:39.760]  Info wars should play it tonight
[1:44:39.760 --> 1:44:44.440]  You and I did a great segment when I came back in July or something. We talked about inversion, right?
[1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:47.400]  We talked about the spiritual nature of this Alex is right
[1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:52.520]  They don't mean to take power necessarily or prestige or position
[1:44:52.520 --> 1:44:59.840]  They mean to deprive us of power and self-defense so that China can swoop in and take over the world
[1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:03.840]  That's right. Their job is to take us down. You're like, well, they're gonna run us
[1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:07.520]  Why wouldn't they want they run to be powerful? No, they're minions. They're compromised, right?
[1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:13.400]  They were brought in as as saboteurs. It's why they're so hunchback why they're so ugly why they're so stupid because they're the scum
[1:45:13.400 --> 1:45:18.920]  You don't think that Hunter Biden has a little chateau in China overseeing a hill of slaves
[1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:24.680]  You don't think that some of these people Chelsea Clinton and the rest these people have bought their children
[1:45:25.320 --> 1:45:33.560]  Into the rise of China and China means to occupy humanity and the council on farm relations admits that they say it's the Chinese century
[1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:38.720]  We're Lloyd Blank plant says I'm Chinese. I'm invested in China to hell with that to hell with that
[1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:41.240]  I'm not going to let them take away my liberty
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:47.620]  So the Clinton grandchildren and the Biden grandchildren who are apparently having sexual relationships with the the Biden uncle
[1:45:47.620 --> 1:45:53.500]  Uh, can can have their little chateaus in China or be vassal states of China
[1:45:53.500 --> 1:45:57.300]  Show the footage of Hunter being brought out on quote the celebration night last night
[1:45:57.300 --> 1:46:04.260]  Oh, and Alex this pisses me off. He did that. He did that to demonstrate his control of the media
[1:46:04.500 --> 1:46:10.660]  He hid Hunter Biden for five to seven days and said oh, it's a liability from the American public
[1:46:10.660 --> 1:46:13.460]  But look what I can do when I declare victory
[1:46:13.460 --> 1:46:17.860]  I can shove it in your face and you can't do a damn thing about it by the way he turns around
[1:46:17.860 --> 1:46:24.060]  He says where's Hunter and they bring he wanted that and they've got a child in his hands. It's it's really sick
[1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:26.060]  Well, they're saying we've got your future
[1:46:26.580 --> 1:46:33.380]  It's it's it's emotional and sick what they're doing and it's spellcasting right in front of us and it's taunting us
[1:46:33.380 --> 1:46:37.060]  It's haunting of us of us who know and they want to distract us
[1:46:37.060 --> 1:46:39.820]  But we're stopping the steal we're getting out in the streets
[1:46:39.820 --> 1:46:45.300]  We're mad if you have paid time off take it if your job won't let you off take it
[1:46:45.300 --> 1:46:50.940]  I'm not gonna give them back the country to govern if they're gonna steal it from there already locking you down permanently anyway
[1:46:50.940 --> 1:46:56.420]  Hell no fight no right and and we can't resist the lockdowns and let's stop the seal is successful
[1:46:56.420 --> 1:47:02.540]  So we have to go to stop the seal regardless of the outcome of the election because what will be the movement to say?
[1:47:02.540 --> 1:47:09.140]  No, I will not go what will be the movement that says we don't give a damn about permits, right?

[1:47:42.420 --> 1:47:44.420]  Biden brings Hunter out on stage

[1:47:54.900 --> 1:47:59.500]  They're gonna bring hunter Biden out on stage. They're all in their silk black mask
[1:48:00.140 --> 1:48:04.460]  And he comes out with this woman, you know, who knows I don't even know which woman this is
[1:48:04.460 --> 1:48:06.460]  you know, he's had so many women and

[1:48:44.020 --> 1:48:45.340]  peacefully
[1:48:45.340 --> 1:48:48.180]  peacefully and say to our American oligarchs

[1:49:17.460 --> 1:49:22.460]  We want humanity back. Let's play that video again and like let's slow it. Let's let's play the video where Hunter comes out
[1:49:23.100 --> 1:49:25.100]  Joe Biden

[1:52:31.660 --> 1:52:33.660]  I
[1:52:38.820 --> 1:52:45.500]  Warning warning warning there is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover
[1:52:46.020 --> 1:52:51.540]  The giant third world collapse and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new COVID lockdown
[1:52:52.060 --> 1:52:56.820]  Announced by globalist systems in Europe in Asia and now in the United States
[1:52:56.820 --> 1:53:02.580]  Joe Biden is set to announce today that he has a new COVID task force
[1:53:02.580 --> 1:53:06.100]  It is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude
[1:53:06.780 --> 1:53:12.500]  Contact tracing forced inoculations coming but most importantly a new lockdown
[1:53:12.980 --> 1:53:19.180]  That way he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID and claim that only a new lockdown will stop
[1:53:19.420 --> 1:53:26.460]  COVID then of course when that new lockdown doesn't work those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are gonna be blamed for it
[1:53:26.460 --> 1:53:30.220]  And that's when all the mass arrest start sometime towards the end of next year
[1:53:30.420 --> 1:53:32.740]  This is a permanent martial law plan
[1:53:33.180 --> 1:53:38.300]  Trump must be putiated exposed Fauci engaged and the UN takeover not play games with it
[1:53:38.300 --> 1:53:53.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:53:53.700 --> 1:53:55.700]  You
[1:54:08.380 --> 1:54:10.380]  Take him all the man
[1:54:14.700 --> 1:54:16.700]  And put him in control
[1:54:16.700 --> 1:54:23.660]  I've looked at Biden's policies and he means that the one area he's been honest is what he's gonna carry out because he says all that
[1:54:23.660 --> 1:54:29.220]  Don't his constituents are idiots and he knows they'll follow orders and the chai comms. No, he needs to say what he's gonna do
[1:54:29.620 --> 1:54:31.620]  I'd like to
[1:54:31.660 --> 1:54:33.660]  make a toast and
[1:54:34.460 --> 1:54:36.460]  To the hope and expectation
[1:54:37.180 --> 1:54:39.180]  That 50 years from now
[1:54:39.180 --> 1:54:45.700]  Our great-grandson will look back and say what a beautiful history we wrote together
[1:54:48.540 --> 1:54:52.940]  His ending of fossil fuels would would starve the whole planet
[1:54:52.940 --> 1:54:54.940]  He is shutting down a frack. He would cause a depression
[1:54:55.460 --> 1:55:01.740]  He's shutting down the coal part power plants would destroy the country and then bringing back Obamacare and
[1:55:02.580 --> 1:55:07.980]  Getting rid of companies being able to match 401ks will end 401ks
[1:55:07.980 --> 1:55:10.700]  And then to get the young people to vote for them
[1:55:10.700 --> 1:55:17.100]  Oh and free healthcare and free education and free cars and a guaranteed universal income. None of it's true
[1:55:17.220 --> 1:55:21.660]  Now we have total evidence of election fraud coming out all across the country
[1:55:22.300 --> 1:55:27.500]  No, we are not allowed to do routine updates without having to go through a recertification effort
[1:55:27.820 --> 1:55:29.580]  but we do
[1:55:29.580 --> 1:55:38.700]  Routinely give guidance on how to best secure systems and also going back again to the the the final
[1:55:39.300 --> 1:55:43.180]  Mitigation against all of this is a robust audit in the canvassing process
[1:55:48.460 --> 1:55:54.100]  Comer said no updates can be done without recertification as you heard mr
[1:55:54.100 --> 1:56:01.940]  Comer's assurances of a secure system. However are contradicted by the fact that various vendors election officials and others
[1:56:02.940 --> 1:56:08.740]  Reportedly can access the voting machine code without an update being required
[1:56:08.740 --> 1:56:14.820]  And we know that there were updates on those machines a day before the election
[1:56:14.820 --> 1:56:19.980]  I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence. We have collected on dominion
[1:56:19.980 --> 1:56:27.020]  and starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela
[1:56:27.660 --> 1:56:29.660]  for Hugo Chavez
[1:56:30.060 --> 1:56:37.820]  And then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries including this one
[1:56:38.220 --> 1:56:43.820]  It was funded by money from Venezuela and Cuba and and China has a role in it also
[1:56:44.220 --> 1:56:48.380]  So if you want to talk about foreign election interference, we certainly have it now
[1:56:48.380 --> 1:56:55.420]  It it wasn't our company in the terrorist's report, but we do have components in our products that come from China
[1:56:55.820 --> 1:57:00.140]  You know Google has a big article that's up on info wars.com Google
[1:57:00.580 --> 1:57:02.380]  analytics and
[1:57:02.380 --> 1:57:09.700]  They had a record search in the days before the election and the days after the election that no one ever searches
[1:57:10.340 --> 1:57:12.340]  What is the penalty?
[1:57:12.340 --> 1:57:19.220]  It was one of the searches and what is the consequences and what is the prison time and what is the jail time these are searches?
[1:57:19.220 --> 1:57:21.220]  No one's ever done
[1:57:21.380 --> 1:57:24.500]  That they ever but now it was by the thousands per state
[1:57:25.300 --> 1:57:29.300]  in Pennsylvania in Georgia in Minnesota in
[1:57:30.340 --> 1:57:31.780]  Wisconsin in
[1:57:31.780 --> 1:57:40.060]  Michigan the search was for what is the consequences? What is the penalty? What is the prison time for election fraud?
[1:57:40.060 --> 1:57:43.900]  Wow, because that's election officials in fraud not voter fraud
[1:57:44.460 --> 1:57:48.540]  That is people checking to see what's gonna happen to them
[1:57:49.020 --> 1:57:53.660]  You think these control freaks are ever gonna turn loose once this dog has you in its jaws?
[1:57:54.140 --> 1:58:00.060]  Once this great white shark's got you in its mouth. Come on. Oh Joe Biden wants peace and love and wants us all to heal
[1:58:00.300 --> 1:58:05.500]  Everything he says is a lie. But when it comes to following orders from the UN and Bill Gates and the chai comms
[1:58:05.500 --> 1:58:10.140]  He a hundred percent follows those orders
[1:58:10.140 --> 1:58:18.300]  They were chosen to hate America. They were chosen to betray it. They were bred and tested from city to state to federal
[1:58:18.300 --> 1:58:24.140]  International government to prove it. You ask, why are they such a legion of trash? Why are they pedophiles? Why do they hate us?
[1:58:24.540 --> 1:58:32.540]  They are the unscrupulous pieces of garbage found by other authoritarian regimes and ruthless corporations to be put in charge above us
[1:58:32.540 --> 1:58:37.260]  And they will never stop until they're dealt with until they're stood up to their bullies
[1:58:37.260 --> 1:58:43.260]  And now they're putting us under martial law again through their blue cities and blue states
[1:58:46.860 --> 1:58:49.980]  DNA force plus if you did one thing for your immune system
[1:58:50.460 --> 1:58:55.980]  You would be get all the essential things and that's the clean iodine x2 or x3. That's the bio tricillinium
[1:58:55.980 --> 1:59:03.260]  That is the vitamin D3. That is the C. That is the zinc. There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential without them. You die and studies show you really need the other ones too
[1:59:03.260 --> 1:59:07.180]  But DNA force goes beyond that it helps get all that in the cells and out the cells
[1:59:07.500 --> 1:59:12.700]  With pqq and coq 10 of the highest quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells
[1:59:13.180 --> 1:59:19.580]  That unclog them so all that stuff can get in viruses don't get in the good stuff gets in as the NIH website says
[1:59:19.660 --> 1:59:25.100]  And if you have all the proper things they can't replicate like they could but I do this because it's essential like oxygen like water

[1:59:43.260 --> 1:59:46.620]  Or triple eight two five three three one three nine. I want to thank you all for tuning in
[1:59:48.620 --> 1:59:52.700]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups

[2:00:09.900 --> 2:00:12.540]  But man, if you type in the great reset into twitter
[2:00:13.420 --> 2:00:15.420]  as a search term, it's just
[2:00:15.420 --> 2:00:22.300]  All these members of the canadian parliament all these members of the australian parliament all these members of the uk parliament
[2:00:22.700 --> 2:00:28.940]  The german parliament the french parliament just like bam world government you and takeover bankrupt you to make you poor

[2:00:34.620 --> 2:00:39.180]  COVID-19 they admit being used for this and then it's all these globalists admitting it
[2:00:39.180 --> 2:00:48.460]  But what's crazy is it's barely on us tv, you know, we've been harping on the great reset as they first announced it three years ago
[2:00:48.860 --> 2:00:54.460]  And then hammering it all year long for the last 11 months, but let me tell you I do get satisfaction
[2:00:55.180 --> 2:00:57.660]  Even though we don't get credit the enemy gives us credit. They hate us
[2:00:58.620 --> 2:01:01.500]  That it's on tucker carlson now, and it's on shan hannity
[2:01:01.500 --> 2:01:09.500]  Jenda 2030 is now mainstream news, which it's a real thing. Remember the new york times all jones claims. There's a thing called agenda 21
[2:01:10.620 --> 2:01:12.940]  Agenda 2030 made my first film on agenda 21
[2:01:13.900 --> 2:01:15.660]  my first film
[2:01:15.660 --> 2:01:19.100]  Before they ever called it jenny 21, then it was the biodiversity
[2:01:19.580 --> 2:01:21.580]  UN operation 1997
[2:01:22.300 --> 2:01:26.220]  Uh, so so here's a few clips off of australian tv. I got some off british tv, too
[2:01:26.220 --> 2:01:30.940]  Let's play clip 15 with sky news host gary hardgrave bringing it down
[2:01:32.460 --> 2:01:39.420]  Well, what another week and the language is starting now to creep in isn't it you turn on the tv news right across all the networks
[2:01:39.420 --> 2:01:41.900]  You're picking up the papers you turn on the radio stations
[2:01:42.300 --> 2:01:47.180]  You hear the words the words that are meant to create some sort of comfort for us
[2:01:47.580 --> 2:01:52.540]  But don't be conned the great reset the great reset
[2:01:52.540 --> 2:01:58.140]  It sounds like everything that was bad is going to go and everything that's in front of us is going to be good
[2:01:58.460 --> 2:02:01.100]  It's been sanctioned by the royal family. I mean
[2:02:01.820 --> 2:02:04.620]  Prince charles has said let's have a great reset
[2:02:05.100 --> 2:02:07.100]  It's been promoted by the world
[2:02:07.740 --> 2:02:09.900]  Left or left the left worldwide. I mean
[2:02:10.460 --> 2:02:14.860]  He did this big great reset is actually going to be a bigger virus than covid
[2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:18.380]  It's going to have more of an impact on your lifestyle than you could imagine
[2:02:18.380 --> 2:02:23.020]  It's been publicized by the social media elite and you've got lines like build back better
[2:02:23.020 --> 2:02:27.820]  I think just in her adorn you is that as her line when she received
[2:02:28.300 --> 2:02:30.940]  the the the government here in New Zealand that
[2:02:31.420 --> 2:02:37.740]  Joe Biden's talking about build back better and then we've got this sort of post covid world the new normal all this mantra
[2:02:38.620 --> 2:02:43.180]  Don't let it con you. What does it actually mean and do we actually get to say well the bottom line is we bite
[2:02:43.180 --> 2:02:50.860]  This is a deal that is being done by the elites and is being foisted upon the weak the weak governments of the world
[2:02:53.900 --> 2:02:57.020]  Key word from that very smart gentleman on national australian tv
[2:02:59.100 --> 2:03:02.860]  The elites against the weak countries and america is seen as weak now
[2:03:03.340 --> 2:03:06.700]  I mean, this is sanctions. This is you try to trade war with china
[2:03:07.100 --> 2:03:10.380]  We were already taking your jobs slowly. We were already deindustrializing you slowly
[2:03:10.380 --> 2:03:14.300]  We gave you service jobs now. We're taking those away now. We're going to bankrupt you forever
[2:03:14.700 --> 2:03:19.420]  And and your people are so stock home syndrome. They're so weak. They're going to beg for it
[2:03:19.500 --> 2:03:21.900]  Here's part of a larger clip that's at info wars.com
[2:03:22.380 --> 2:03:29.260]  Take a 10 minute report great reset in devos at the forefront of great deception in the free world sky news as well
[2:03:29.340 --> 2:03:30.860]  Here it is
[2:03:30.860 --> 2:03:38.700]  This year's Davos is very very different to all the previous ones the world economic forum along with the united nations
[2:03:38.700 --> 2:03:44.780]  Along with the international monetary fund and along with any number of prominent globalist organizations
[2:03:45.420 --> 2:03:54.060]  And powerful individuals including prince charles together have jointly promised that the 2021 world economic forum
[2:03:54.300 --> 2:04:00.620]  Will be used to introduce via a vast network of connected big tech corporations
[2:04:01.020 --> 2:04:05.020]  Online activist movements and compliant local and national governments
[2:04:05.020 --> 2:04:12.860]  Something they call the great reset. This isn't summer sky after dark fantasy conspiracy theory jackie
[2:04:13.020 --> 2:04:14.700]  It is a global commitment
[2:04:14.860 --> 2:04:22.460]  They have made to use the panic and fear generated by the coronavirus as a means to reshape
[2:04:22.700 --> 2:04:29.900]  All our economies and laws and move to a new form of capitalism that focuses on net zero emissions
[2:04:29.900 --> 2:04:36.460]  To use all the tools of covet to tackle climate change. You might think this is a great thing
[2:04:36.940 --> 2:04:38.940]  You might think this is a terrible thing
[2:04:38.940 --> 2:04:42.940]  But what is unforgivable miss lambie is for you not to think about it at all
[2:04:43.500 --> 2:04:53.180]  If implemented successfully the great reset will undeniably and deliberately have extreme and possibly dire repercussions for every single one of your constituents
[2:04:54.060 --> 2:04:56.060]  Ignorance senator is no excuse
[2:04:56.060 --> 2:05:05.820]  Already the great reset is being widely advertised on posters and in ads across the uk and europe and no doubt will be here before too long
[2:05:06.380 --> 2:05:11.420]  You'll own nothing and you'll be happy is just one of their marketing slogans
[2:05:11.740 --> 2:05:16.220]  I'm sure there are plenty of Tasmanians jackie who might beg to differ with that proposition
[2:05:16.620 --> 2:05:22.860]  So let me fill in the blanks for you jackie the plan involves replacing shareholders of big companies with
[2:05:22.860 --> 2:05:27.740]  Stakeholders who happen to be left-wing bureaucrats and climate change zealots
[2:05:28.140 --> 2:05:33.180]  Replacing mum and dad small businesses and private enterprises with big tech and big business
[2:05:33.500 --> 2:05:38.140]  Mrs. Kefoops sharepole portfolios out Greta Thunberg zero emissions are in
[2:05:38.700 --> 2:05:40.700]  Democracy and free enterprise go out the window
[2:05:41.260 --> 2:05:46.780]  Totalitarian government control slides in through the back door, but remember it's not only a great reset
[2:05:46.780 --> 2:05:52.940]  It's a great deception because in order to get everyday people like you and me jackie to surrender
[2:05:53.180 --> 2:06:00.380]  Many of the rights and freedoms we currently take for granted that repeatedly stated aim of these organizations
[2:06:00.620 --> 2:06:02.620]  Is to deliberately use
[2:06:03.180 --> 2:06:07.260]  Covid as an excuse to use all the political and authoritarian
[2:06:07.660 --> 2:06:13.580]  Tools as prince child's puts it that are currently being used around the world to eradicate the virus
[2:06:13.580 --> 2:06:21.020]  Such as lockdowns exclusion zones forced closure of businesses heavy fines making protesting illegal and so on
[2:06:21.740 --> 2:06:24.380]  But now to eradicate carbon emissions
[2:06:25.100 --> 2:06:31.500]  Those behind this scheme are adamant that there can be and never will be a return to normal
[2:06:31.900 --> 2:06:33.900]  That life will never again
[2:06:35.180 --> 2:06:37.820]  Extremely powerful information
[2:06:37.820 --> 2:06:43.020]  And the full video is at info wars.com
[2:06:45.500 --> 2:06:47.500]  And that is Rowan Dean
[2:06:47.980 --> 2:06:53.740]  Now he's a father. He's a man. He's a patriot for his own family. He knows what's going on. Let me show you
[2:06:54.700 --> 2:06:55.900]  this
[2:06:55.900 --> 2:06:58.400]  This is an article published at info wars.com
[2:06:59.260 --> 2:07:01.260]  in 2002
[2:07:01.260 --> 2:07:03.260]  And
[2:07:07.820 --> 2:07:09.820]  It deals with
[2:07:10.620 --> 2:07:15.500]  What we said the BBC back what was still halfway decent with Greg Paulus at the helm
[2:07:16.380 --> 2:07:22.620]  But their head investigative reporter got a secret group of thousands of pages of documents from the IMF and world bank
[2:07:24.060 --> 2:07:25.900]  The article was called
[2:07:25.900 --> 2:07:32.540]  World bankers feed off crumbling economies. This book is out of print, but it's online for free 9 11 descent into tyranny Alex Jones
[2:07:34.540 --> 2:07:39.980]  And it's an interview of Greg Paulus journals for BBC Observer London March 4th, 2002
[2:07:41.340 --> 2:07:46.860]  They got the documents where they planned after they'd imploded the third world to flood us with the third world
[2:07:48.620 --> 2:07:51.420]  And then to use a global crisis to implode our currencies
[2:07:51.420 --> 2:07:58.140]  And make us debt slaves permanently and have lockdowns and try to trigger a race war to be able to cause martial law
[2:07:59.660 --> 2:08:01.660]  Now later they decided
[2:08:02.300 --> 2:08:04.300]  to just use a virus
[2:08:04.860 --> 2:08:06.860]  And they even tell us that an operation lockstep
[2:08:08.620 --> 2:08:10.620]  2010 from the Rockefellers
[2:08:11.740 --> 2:08:13.500]  Rockefeller Foundation
[2:08:13.500 --> 2:08:15.500]  so
[2:08:15.900 --> 2:08:19.980]  That's what we do here. We study the enemy and we know what we're talking about
[2:08:19.980 --> 2:08:21.980]  And now
[2:08:22.700 --> 2:08:26.140]  They think none of you have memories remember 15 days will be the lockdown now
[2:08:26.140 --> 2:08:32.700]  We're 11 months in and they're oh a new total lockdowns here and all the leftist cities of the world and leftist states are doing it
[2:08:33.180 --> 2:08:35.740]  As they hold the rest of the areas that are capitalist hostage
[2:08:36.300 --> 2:08:40.780]  This is fascism at the top communism at the bottom for us in a nightmare scenario
[2:08:41.260 --> 2:08:42.780]  This is making people so dependent
[2:08:42.780 --> 2:08:47.740]  They've got to go to the government and the government uses the poor as a weapon to be pointed at the people for a takeover
[2:08:47.740 --> 2:08:50.780]  It's a communist playbook run by fascist on top
[2:08:51.340 --> 2:08:55.340]  And if we don't start rising up as president trump's head of the coveted task force said
[2:08:56.060 --> 2:09:00.300]  We deserve what we get. This is it. Well, I'm fighting back. I'm getting on a plane today to go to georgia
[2:09:00.860 --> 2:09:05.340]  To try to get a special emergency legislative session to dig in not just have spot checks
[2:09:05.340 --> 2:09:11.580]  The spot checks have already found thousands of votes for trump. He will win that state. We will reverse this. We will route the enemy
[2:09:12.540 --> 2:09:15.500]  But it comes down to you taking action the toll-free number to join us
[2:09:15.500 --> 2:09:19.100]  I want to take your calls on the great reset and on their recounts and all of it

[2:09:27.820 --> 2:09:33.420]  We're taking your phone calls longtime callers first-time callers agree disagree 877-789-2539
[2:09:33.660 --> 2:09:37.740]  Unlike mainstream media if you got a good clean phone and the point you're ready to make we'll get you on
[2:09:37.980 --> 2:09:41.420]  We do discriminate against bad phones where we can't hear you though. That's true
[2:09:41.420 --> 2:09:45.020]  Some discrimination is good, isn't it? We'll be right back. Stay with us
[2:09:46.140 --> 2:09:52.380]  It really is simple the left are into being deviant and I don't mean sexually deviant that goes to the territory
[2:09:52.940 --> 2:09:56.940]  I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors deviant against their own species
[2:09:57.580 --> 2:09:59.580]  Deviant against the order of nature
[2:09:59.980 --> 2:10:02.300]  Even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous
[2:10:02.300 --> 2:10:09.420]  They still do it because they want to play god everything they touch they destroy their their sacrament is aborting babies and then
[2:10:09.420 --> 2:10:15.340]  Using their body parts their their religion is not taking care of the old but euthanizing them
[2:10:15.740 --> 2:10:20.620]  Their whole system is designed for the un to keep their world countries in serious poverty and poor
[2:10:21.020 --> 2:10:25.900]  Ballooning populations have been watching all that new fruit down the vine to continually
[2:10:26.460 --> 2:10:31.500]  Reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again. They truly are the children of satan
[2:10:31.500 --> 2:10:35.660]  They are the children of the devil have you look at the slaves that serve them byton and kamala harris
[2:10:35.660 --> 2:10:43.580]  It really is manifested being a slave of satan is not probable. Sin is not profitable. I'm alex jones, and this is the info war
[2:10:45.180 --> 2:10:48.540]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left
[2:10:48.780 --> 2:10:55.580]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you have a family member suffering from this
[2:10:55.980 --> 2:11:01.660]  Degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store dot com
[2:11:01.660 --> 2:11:07.980]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure
[2:11:08.380 --> 2:11:14.460]  Decrease triglyceride levels decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in
[2:11:15.020 --> 2:11:23.420]  inflammatory responses and joints and the digestive system recent studies have suggested that high epa and dha fish oil
[2:11:23.660 --> 2:11:29.660]  Can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells
[2:11:29.660 --> 2:11:38.380]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality
[2:11:38.620 --> 2:11:44.620]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend family member or yourself at info wars store dot com
[2:11:44.620 --> 2:11:56.620]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:03.980 --> 2:12:05.820]  The party's over
[2:12:05.820 --> 2:12:08.460]  The globalists have annihilated almost every nation state on earth
[2:12:09.500 --> 2:12:11.500]  They've got a total surveillance grid in place
[2:12:11.820 --> 2:12:13.820]  They've investigated most of the populations
[2:12:13.820 --> 2:12:20.380]  And they've gotten away with massive crimes. They've committed across the planet. And so why shouldn't they make their move
[2:12:20.940 --> 2:12:26.860]  Against humanity. I am your host alex jones. Here's some of the new articles up on info wars dot com the von mis institute says
[2:12:27.340 --> 2:12:31.100]  It is topian fourth industrial revolution of the u.n. And
[2:12:31.580 --> 2:12:33.340]  clow swab
[2:12:33.340 --> 2:12:38.700]  That means bill gates will be very different from the first one and swab is a frontman for gates and the globalist
[2:12:39.420 --> 2:12:40.860]  that's why
[2:12:40.860 --> 2:12:46.140]  The british prime minister has turned out to be a total trojan horse piece of filth, which I predicted former liberal mayor
[2:12:46.540 --> 2:12:49.020]  Who became this patriot of london?
[2:12:50.140 --> 2:12:56.540]  Boris johnson will play that clip next segment saying you're going to take nanotech chips. It's it's a genetic takeover
[2:12:57.180 --> 2:12:59.180]  Well, clow swab is now saying that
[2:13:00.540 --> 2:13:04.860]  Boris johnson says the g7 is held this year under uk control
[2:13:06.620 --> 2:13:08.860]  And then he's going to follow bill gates is every order
[2:13:08.860 --> 2:13:16.220]  They're like, who's bill gates? He's not my doctor. He's not my military leader. Why is he running everything? Because it's a corporate takeover
[2:13:16.300 --> 2:13:18.300]  Oh, and they want to force things in your body
[2:13:18.780 --> 2:13:21.660]  Like let's just play the boris johnson clip from a few months ago at the u.n.
[2:13:22.060 --> 2:13:25.100]  About nanotech in your body, which is genetically rewriting yourselves
[2:13:25.660 --> 2:13:30.380]  Forget monsanto and franken foods. You're the franken food now. Here is boris johnson
[2:13:31.980 --> 2:13:35.660]  And there are today people who are still actually anti science
[2:13:35.660 --> 2:13:37.660]  A whole movement
[2:13:38.540 --> 2:13:40.540]  Called the anti-vaxxers
[2:13:40.700 --> 2:13:48.620]  Who refuse to acknowledge the evidence that vaccinations have eradicated smallpox and who by their prejudices are actually
[2:13:49.100 --> 2:13:52.780]  Endangering the very children they want to protect
[2:13:53.420 --> 2:14:00.460]  And I totally reject this anti scientific pessimism. I'm profoundly optimistic
[2:14:00.460 --> 2:14:07.900]  About the ability of new technology to serve as a liberator and to remake the world remake the world
[2:14:08.140 --> 2:14:09.580]  remake the world
[2:14:09.580 --> 2:14:11.260]  wondrously and
[2:14:11.260 --> 2:14:13.740]  Benignly indeed in countless respects
[2:14:14.300 --> 2:14:19.180]  Technology is already doing just that nanotechnology. I mentioned earlier
[2:14:19.820 --> 2:14:28.540]  Revolutionizing medicine by designing robot robots a fraction of the size of a red blood cell capable of swimming through our bodies
[2:14:28.540 --> 2:14:35.660]  Dispensing medicine and attacking malignant cells like some star wars are Marder neural interface technology

[2:24:48.700 --> 2:24:52.860]  They told us 2.5 million would be dead now. It's 260,000 most of them died of something else
[2:24:53.660 --> 2:24:56.860]  This is all a giant fraud the cdc admitted yesterday
[2:24:57.420 --> 2:25:03.260]  94 of people again died of heart attacks or cancer or something else and most of the tests are false positive
[2:25:03.260 --> 2:25:09.980]  But are they going to get in trouble? Oh, no, they're going to keep doubling down with hysteria because so many americans are weak followers

[2:25:28.380 --> 2:25:31.820]  That's it's so hard to watch them up there giving a speech in a freaking mask too
[2:25:31.820 --> 2:25:37.100]  You knew a month ago before the election. They started wearing masks on tv like, you know, seeing it in host
[2:25:37.900 --> 2:25:41.980]  I mean, it's just it's such a it's it's such a cult. It's like a face sucker

[2:26:14.380 --> 2:26:17.260]  I want to have your clean phone you want to tell what you're calling in about it's great
[2:26:17.500 --> 2:26:22.140]  Once you get on air you tell us what you want to cover. You don't have to ask permission, sir
[2:26:22.140 --> 2:26:28.700]  If you ask for permission, I will hang up on you. That's the one rule is no censorship and no screening
[2:26:29.180 --> 2:26:33.180]  Well, try again, Dave. I love you. Go ahead. You're free man, brother. Go ahead
[2:26:34.140 --> 2:26:36.460]  Okay, this is gonna sound like numerology, but uh, okay

[2:26:43.100 --> 2:26:44.700]  All right, I'm gonna tell you through it
[2:26:44.700 --> 2:26:47.980]  All right, the word coronal and the number 21 agenda 21
[2:26:47.980 --> 2:26:53.340]  COVID-21 a coronal mass ejection is predicted to occur on December 21
[2:26:56.060 --> 2:26:59.260]  Is the coronal mass ejection a cover story for an EMP?
[2:27:01.020 --> 2:27:06.780]  Will the EMP only hit the western hemisphere only affecting north and south america while sparing africa europe asia and australia
[2:27:07.900 --> 2:27:14.140]  Uh, who predicts a mass coronal ejection? It's very hard for even NASA to predict when we're going to see sunspots
[2:27:14.140 --> 2:27:16.140]  Oh
[2:27:16.140 --> 2:27:20.540]  No, no, I was referring to a caller that he uh hit your show on uh on friday

[2:27:33.340 --> 2:27:37.820]  Sure, uh, let's see. So the fallen domino that leads to brand chips is the destruction of our immune system
[2:27:37.820 --> 2:27:39.820]  Otherwise, the brands will reject the chips
[2:27:39.820 --> 2:27:43.820]  A big tech will host the singularity to scare us into taking brand chips
[2:27:43.820 --> 2:27:49.500]  The pre-planned fiction is that brand chips will turn humanity into a giant cloud computer to overpower the ai
[2:27:50.940 --> 2:27:52.940]  I appreciate your call
[2:27:53.100 --> 2:27:59.660]  It's not going to be brand chips. It's injectables that go into your brain and then just take over. It's a bunch of micro micro chips
[2:28:00.060 --> 2:28:04.060]  So we're all thinking of like a micro chip. It's nano tech. It's on all the buses everywhere
[2:28:04.060 --> 2:28:09.340]  Even in austin. I saw it now. Oh take your nano tech nano tech will save you. It's the new wealth

[2:28:26.780 --> 2:28:30.940]  Thank you, Alex. I appreciate it very much and as you well can imagine
[2:28:30.940 --> 2:28:37.740]  I feel we have reached the the crossroads. We're at that critical point in defining history
[2:28:38.140 --> 2:28:42.780]  Where I think it's time for clarity. It's time for keeping things simple
[2:28:43.260 --> 2:28:48.940]  Uh, the the evil forces always try to make it look like a bondugal and get everybody confused
[2:28:49.100 --> 2:28:52.300]  But it's simple the I call the age of inversion
[2:28:52.380 --> 2:28:57.740]  As you know, and I think it's important that people right now should remember my dictum
[2:28:58.380 --> 2:29:00.380]  when you are in doubt
[2:29:00.380 --> 2:29:06.220]  Always check the ultimate word, which is the constitution. That's the material world
[2:29:07.180 --> 2:29:08.620]  the ultimate
[2:29:08.620 --> 2:29:11.660]  world control you want to call it a collective
[2:29:12.540 --> 2:29:19.340]  Understanding of wisdom is in the american constitution even the french constitution recognizes liberty and freedom in the american sense
[2:29:19.740 --> 2:29:21.340]  So and are canadian as well
[2:29:21.340 --> 2:29:25.900]  So I want to I want to draw your attention to the fact that in the age of inversion
[2:29:25.900 --> 2:29:30.700]  You must go to the source the jeffersonian brigade is what I call it
[2:29:31.020 --> 2:29:37.500]  And this is the 1776 time for the jeffersonian brigade to come together and keep things simple
[2:29:37.900 --> 2:29:44.700]  The freedom of the individual the sovereignty of the individual and the power of the constitution to direct
[2:29:45.020 --> 2:29:48.300]  Now I asked you once before who the hell elected
[2:29:49.020 --> 2:29:51.420]  international financiers to rule the world
[2:29:51.420 --> 2:29:58.460]  This is an inversion and we must put these are the robber barons that are tax exempt that bankrupt countries
[2:29:58.700 --> 2:30:01.580]  That that bankrupt currencies that are known villains
[2:30:02.060 --> 2:30:05.660]  Telling us they're using a virus to keep us locked down because they love us when they admit
[2:30:05.740 --> 2:30:10.140]  They want to make us poor and control us their total frauds and we must go back to the constitution
[2:30:10.460 --> 2:30:17.740]  Back to common sense and reject these monsters now and start calling for nurenberg style trials start calling for their prosecution
[2:30:17.740 --> 2:30:22.220]  Call them out as the criminals. They are because you're absolutely right. That's what they are
[2:30:22.460 --> 2:30:28.860]  What do we do to put them on notice of their crimes against humanity and the mass starvation their lockdown not covid-19 is already triggered
[2:30:29.740 --> 2:30:36.220]  We just remind everybody as i'm doing right now alex that there are leaders all over the world not necessarily my canadian leader
[2:30:36.540 --> 2:30:40.700]  Who is uh, unfortunately influenced by george soros and his sycophants
[2:30:40.860 --> 2:30:46.220]  But at this stage of the game what we must do is understand that the constitution of united states
[2:30:46.220 --> 2:30:48.940]  Is where the president is looking if we
[2:30:49.580 --> 2:30:54.620]  Don't succeed at this stage in restoring the treasury of united states
[2:30:54.940 --> 2:30:57.100]  You are going to be in a game in a game playing
[2:30:57.820 --> 2:31:03.100]  In a poker game playing with somebody that prints money out of thin air no matter how many times you win
[2:31:03.260 --> 2:31:08.860]  No, exactly they have the unlimited fiat currency and they are making their move to destroy our real economies
[2:31:09.180 --> 2:31:15.260]  So we have to bow to them to get their fiat currency. This is slaver. You're a genius carlos. We love you. Thank you so much
[2:31:15.260 --> 2:31:18.940]  Let's take a call from thomas in pennsylvania. You're on the air. Go ahead
[2:31:19.660 --> 2:31:23.900]  Hey, what's up alex? Welcome. I just wanted to kind of draw a little attention to the fact
[2:31:24.220 --> 2:31:31.180]  Nobody seems to be talking about like pennsylvania on election night. Just just stopped counting the votes
[2:31:31.740 --> 2:31:35.500]  But what what are you guys in high school? You have to go to sleep at ten or up
[2:31:35.580 --> 2:31:40.380]  But bryans, but they actually kept counting we now know but bryan stelter said there's no fraud
[2:31:40.380 --> 2:31:43.500]  He said so i mean he didn't show evidence, but he is the boss
[2:31:43.500 --> 2:31:48.460]  It's just it's crazy where it's like four years ago when trump got elected
[2:31:48.860 --> 2:31:53.100]  They had all the results in no problem and this time around
[2:31:53.500 --> 2:31:59.740]  This is two weeks later and the states still aren't uncounting like and remember they said they were going to contest forever
[2:32:00.220 --> 2:32:05.500]  If they what and they pledged to but now oh you can't contest that's dictator behavior
[2:32:05.500 --> 2:32:13.740]  Yeah, it's just it's honestly insanity that nobody is asking these questions though like they haven't even given even a
[2:32:14.780 --> 2:32:20.140]  Can I say bullshit on there? They haven't even given just a you can say it once that we gotta delay out
[2:32:20.140 --> 2:32:26.060]  We gotta let you go. Sorry. How the f-60 works. Thank you thomas. All right. Let's go to uh jake in illinois. Go ahead jake
[2:32:28.140 --> 2:32:34.780]  Hey, how's it going alex? Uh, love your show. Love you. I love what you do for our uh american liberty and what you do for our country
[2:32:34.780 --> 2:32:37.660]  Also, I just want to give a big shout out to your product. Um
[2:32:38.220 --> 2:32:43.180]  Turbo force is awesome. Uh, it's better than for uh energy drinks combined clean energy
[2:32:43.740 --> 2:32:44.940]  Good stuff
[2:32:44.940 --> 2:32:49.020]  Oh, by the way, the amount of money we put into it of five forms of clean caffeine
[2:32:49.260 --> 2:32:54.540]  Then a bunch of other co-factors amino acids delivered into your brain and it lasts like 10 hours. It's an incredible product
[2:32:54.940 --> 2:32:57.180]  I'm gonna hold you over as you can finish your political statement
[2:32:57.180 --> 2:33:01.500]  But tell folks more about that because I mean we we got a top developer to develop turbo force
[2:33:01.500 --> 2:33:05.100]  The one of the top guys in the country didn't put his name on it for political reasons
[2:33:05.100 --> 2:33:07.180]  But we had to pay him like 10 grand to develop it
[2:33:07.420 --> 2:33:11.980]  He believed at the time it was developed two years ago that is the strongest cleanest best one in the market
[2:33:12.060 --> 2:33:14.060]  What what has been your experience?
[2:33:14.700 --> 2:33:19.900]  Um, mostly I just run off caffeine. I work overnight. So uh, I run on coffee
[2:33:20.620 --> 2:33:24.460]  Um, but when I do take um energy drinks that kind of crashes me
[2:33:25.020 --> 2:33:27.420]  So with uh turbo force, I'm able to keep going
[2:33:27.420 --> 2:33:33.180]  Um, I have clean energy, but if I do feel the need to fall asleep because people do need to sleep
[2:33:33.340 --> 2:33:36.300]  Um, I could fall asleep when I wake up totally revitalized
[2:33:36.780 --> 2:33:41.420]  Not groggy or anything like that deprived try to come from really high quality sources. We'll be right back
[2:33:42.380 --> 2:33:45.820]  When president trump said that the mainstream corporate media was the enemy of america
[2:33:45.900 --> 2:33:47.740]  He really was telling the truth
[2:33:47.740 --> 2:33:51.660]  They don't just work for the communist chinese and the globalist and the eu and the whole hollywood
[2:33:51.980 --> 2:33:53.980]  america hating god hating crude
[2:33:53.980 --> 2:33:58.540]  They literally say that they are in control of our minds and believe they do
[2:33:59.180 --> 2:34:02.780]  Own us and tell us who the president is even though that's not in law
[2:34:03.420 --> 2:34:07.740]  And they're just gaslighting the whole public over and over again saying joe bite his president elect
[2:34:08.460 --> 2:34:14.300]  Repeating it over and over you know like a brainwashing mantra when it's up again to the state government to certify those votes
[2:34:14.620 --> 2:34:18.460]  And those votes are being challenged. There's massive evidence of fraud again. That's just so
[2:34:18.460 --> 2:34:24.460]  Incredibly clear biden said because he thought he was gonna lose up front that oh, we're gonna challenge the vote
[2:34:24.780 --> 2:34:30.540]  No matter what until every votes counted. Well, a lot of those have been counted and there's massive fraud being discovered
[2:34:30.540 --> 2:34:35.260]  So we're gonna hold the course here because joe biden is a communist chinese agent. He's a globalist
[2:34:35.260 --> 2:34:41.340]  He wants carbon taxes. He will destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us. This is war
[2:34:42.300 --> 2:34:47.660]  The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites the most cunning smart
[2:34:47.660 --> 2:34:49.660]  inventive people
[2:34:50.300 --> 2:34:51.900]  believe that
[2:34:51.900 --> 2:34:54.700]  Chivalry doesn't exist anymore. They don't believe in being aristocrats
[2:34:55.260 --> 2:34:57.260]  Turn to hold up civilization and power the people
[2:34:58.060 --> 2:35:00.300]  And once the establishment has that predatory idea
[2:35:00.940 --> 2:35:04.220]  Civilization collapses very very quickly. You can't treat the least of us
[2:35:05.020 --> 2:35:07.100]  Like garbage and not treat your own family like that
[2:35:07.900 --> 2:35:10.460]  And so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us
[2:35:11.660 --> 2:35:17.420]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil worshipers that can commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crimes
[2:35:17.420 --> 2:35:22.620]  Try to get away from humanity. But really they can't escape the laws of the universe. They may train themselves to
[2:35:23.260 --> 2:35:26.220]  Commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves. But
[2:35:26.940 --> 2:35:31.900]  The repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the very structure itself
[2:35:32.460 --> 2:35:36.380]  Well, it's created by loving god. Well, it's created by having a connection to god
[2:35:36.860 --> 2:35:41.660]  God is the source of all creation all success all power. We deny that you'll be destroyed
[2:35:41.660 --> 2:35:48.700]  There are many references in the holy bible to the mustard seed and why is that?
[2:35:49.020 --> 2:35:56.140]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds
[2:35:56.860 --> 2:36:02.220]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects. They didn't know why
[2:36:02.620 --> 2:36:08.540]  Well with modern science, we know it's one of the purest cleanest organic forms of selenium
[2:36:08.540 --> 2:36:14.460]  We have bio true selenium sold out for months back in stock at info wars store

[2:36:20.540 --> 2:36:24.620]  Bio true selenium at info wars store.com

[2:36:43.900 --> 2:36:48.540]  Talk about tomorrow's news today. This is all very transparent when you war game it out
[2:36:49.340 --> 2:36:54.700]  Six months ago info wars predicted the mail-in ballots would be used to steal the election from prompt
[2:36:55.020 --> 2:37:01.900]  They would simply pause the voting at night and then have an unlimited number that they had in reserve to bring forward in battleground states
[2:37:02.060 --> 2:37:04.060]  To secure the victory and now that happened
[2:37:04.060 --> 2:37:10.140]  Now what else did I predict a few months ago and again last week and again last night all on record that when joe biden
[2:37:10.460 --> 2:37:12.140]  was president-elect
[2:37:12.140 --> 2:37:13.980]  Via fraud trump would challenge it
[2:37:13.980 --> 2:37:19.420]  But biden's next move would be to form his own covet task force say that trump is inept and has killed
[2:37:19.900 --> 2:37:21.420]  267 thousand americans
[2:37:21.420 --> 2:37:26.140]  Which is it true and demand trump's removal via the 25th amendment if he doesn't let
[2:37:26.620 --> 2:37:29.500]  Joe biden's new covet task force give all the new orders
[2:37:29.500 --> 2:37:34.300]  They'll tell trump that if he backs down and follows their orders and steps down they won't blame him for coven
[2:37:34.460 --> 2:37:36.140]  But if he does that they're gonna blame him for coven
[2:37:36.140 --> 2:37:41.340]  But then if he does do what they say he's talking about him anyways plus this is meant for martial law destroy the economy
[2:37:41.420 --> 2:37:43.420]  I warned you all
[2:37:43.420 --> 2:37:56.780]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:59.980 --> 2:38:00.860]  All right
[2:38:00.860 --> 2:38:04.860]  We had a lot of calls to get to in a short time to get there and I got biden saying is our new cult leader
[2:38:05.420 --> 2:38:11.020]  Wear your mask only five people at thanksgiving just all random crap like who is this dude like your daddy
[2:38:11.020 --> 2:38:14.540]  And everything he said was a lie and it's all a fraud and china's totally open
[2:38:15.740 --> 2:38:18.460]  What did the white house head of the covet task force say?
[2:38:19.500 --> 2:38:25.580]  Our real president trump. He said rise up against it stop acting like a bunch of stock home syndrome dumbasses
[2:38:26.220 --> 2:38:27.580]  Your schmucks
[2:38:27.580 --> 2:38:30.380]  He's not your friend. He's a chi-com agent. You dumbasses
[2:38:31.340 --> 2:38:34.700]  Let's talk to uh jake and olinoy finish up your point about what trump should do
[2:38:35.420 --> 2:38:37.420]  In georgia and more go ahead
[2:38:37.420 --> 2:38:41.820]  All right, so um, I know you guys are going down to georgia. I appreciate it
[2:38:41.900 --> 2:38:46.220]  I I know you guys are being there for those who can't uh, but I also wanted to let you know
[2:38:46.220 --> 2:38:48.940]  You should keep a close eye on pennsylvania certified tomorrow
[2:38:49.740 --> 2:38:52.780]  Um, just big big watch out there. I know it's a big key state
[2:38:53.420 --> 2:38:59.420]  Um, but for trump. I think he really should do something as polarizing as uh, like an emergency broadcast system
[2:38:59.740 --> 2:39:04.380]  You know everything on the radios to your broadcast. I'll tell you I don't think trump's giving up
[2:39:04.380 --> 2:39:10.060]  But the advice he's getting of don't anger the courts is is more bs. He needs to be
[2:39:11.180 --> 2:39:15.980]  Resolute desk. I am the president. This is a fraud. The courts are going to stab him in the back
[2:39:16.060 --> 2:39:18.060]  I predict this is a big miscalculation
[2:39:18.460 --> 2:39:22.300]  Uh, and he needs to be out there saying this a chi-com takeover. I totally agree
[2:39:23.900 --> 2:39:28.380]  Yeah, he's been dealt with something unprecedented and I think he really needs to throw that right back in their faces
[2:39:29.100 --> 2:39:34.060]  Um, do something that no president's done before just you know, even if he uh is wrong about it
[2:39:34.060 --> 2:39:36.940]  You know, he could just go out there give it one last good shot
[2:39:37.980 --> 2:39:42.140]  Um, and not only that maybe exploit their plan. I'm not sure if it's his plan
[2:39:42.220 --> 2:39:46.620]  But I'm going to go along with what you said on uh, just talk about what you want to talk about without permission
[2:39:47.260 --> 2:39:52.700]  Um, I noticed that there's no talk about the amazon fires. Uh at all this year since they were on fire
[2:39:53.420 --> 2:39:55.980]  Uh in the beginning of the year and it was a big trendy thing
[2:39:56.700 --> 2:40:01.420]  um, and there was a lot of stuff going on with the venezuela election and a lot of uh
[2:40:01.420 --> 2:40:05.660]  Uh gas lines and all that stuff. Um, I'm just kind of questioning
[2:40:06.140 --> 2:40:12.140]  Are they going to use the amazon rainforest for pharmaceutical research and then make venezuela the bill pushers or what?
[2:40:12.860 --> 2:40:17.020]  Who knows they always just talk about fires down there people burn part of the forest every year
[2:40:17.340 --> 2:40:21.900]  To put nitrogen in the soil with good crops and so they just point out say look the earth's burning. You're bad
[2:40:21.980 --> 2:40:27.180]  Let us run your life. But now it's oh the virus is bad. Let us run your life. I appreciate your call brother. Thank you
[2:40:27.180 --> 2:40:31.660]  Let's keep moving quick here g a in vegas. You're on the air. Welcome

[2:42:01.340 --> 2:42:05.820]  Just to kind of get him up to speed and he's finally starting to see things that don't make sense to him and uh
[2:42:06.700 --> 2:42:08.460]  I told him watch end game
[2:42:08.460 --> 2:42:12.780]  Watch the obama deception and that that will kind of put things in context after told that
[2:42:12.780 --> 2:42:18.940]  So to watch them myself then I gotta say not only did you lay out their plans, but really they laid it out for us
[2:42:19.500 --> 2:42:22.940]  Uh, well, that's it. No, no, that's it. I didn't do all this people. How did you know this?
[2:42:23.020 --> 2:42:28.700]  They tell you what they're gonna do. It's like that's the it's like cloth swabs like you're gonna starve to death
[2:42:28.700 --> 2:42:30.060]  We're gonna
[2:42:30.060 --> 2:42:33.100]  Make you pour and make you merge with machines. It's like what?
[2:42:34.140 --> 2:42:37.260]  That's the crazy part about it. Well last night. I'm listening to Schumer
[2:42:37.980 --> 2:42:39.260]  and uh
[2:42:39.260 --> 2:42:43.420]  He's talking about the installation of the next president. I mean so, you know first
[2:42:43.500 --> 2:42:48.860]  It's the the broad organization and now they have the uh the president to be installed, which is I know
[2:42:49.100 --> 2:42:54.300]  I saw that Pelosi said it a month ago. He just said it last night. They use the word install
[2:42:54.700 --> 2:42:59.420]  They're pissing. Why do you think they love to brag to show off for their criminal base, right?
[2:42:59.580 --> 2:43:03.100]  To to encourage them that commit crime, you know be confident
[2:43:04.140 --> 2:43:08.060]  Yep, so um last point I want to make uh, I watched you
[2:43:08.060 --> 2:43:13.260]  Uh out in dc with the uh the mega march, which I could have been there really
[2:43:14.540 --> 2:43:18.220]  It just lit me up and I just see uh Americans being patriotic
[2:43:19.180 --> 2:43:21.020]  and uh
[2:43:21.020 --> 2:43:23.020]  the little pissed off
[2:43:23.420 --> 2:43:25.420]  Group of antifa people kind of in the corner
[2:43:25.980 --> 2:43:27.980]  Being little hecklers, you know
[2:43:27.980 --> 2:43:34.140]  They're just like this tiny little group and you know, it's just kind of a perfect example of what we have kind of going across the country
[2:43:34.140 --> 2:43:39.340]  And uh the more this goes on and the more people start seeing the more even like our local governments
[2:43:39.340 --> 2:43:41.500]  Let me see what they kind of scum that's running our cities
[2:43:41.980 --> 2:43:48.140]  And it's how they now take total control, you know, and it's taking years and years and it's just like exactly what you've been saying
[2:43:49.180 --> 2:43:52.460]  The uh the left not even left you can recall them that
[2:43:52.780 --> 2:43:55.980]  Traditionally the left is not for the kind of stuff that they're doing brother
[2:43:56.060 --> 2:43:59.420]  I remember like 20 years ago reading un documents that were public with their like
[2:43:59.420 --> 2:44:05.740]  We'll devalue human life and bring back human sacrifice. We'll break up the families and sterilize young children
[2:44:05.980 --> 2:44:09.820]  And I'm like this is scary now. They're doing it. I appreciate your call Daniel
[2:44:10.300 --> 2:44:17.420]  All right, just keep jamming in more calls here ahead of paul joseph watson taking over the no one shroyer norim david in hawaii the beautiful islands of hawaii
[2:44:17.660 --> 2:44:19.660]  I've been under martial law
[2:44:20.140 --> 2:44:22.140]  The globalists are all flying there
[2:44:22.220 --> 2:44:25.900]  Tax-free, you know the californian government while everybody else is locked down
[2:44:25.900 --> 2:44:30.300]  But he wants to talk with the RNA vaccine the coming tyranny that's already here. Go ahead david
[2:44:31.500 --> 2:44:37.340]  Hey, alexis david in hawaii. I hope you're doing well. Thank you for uh, what you're doing out there and all the patriots
[2:44:37.420 --> 2:44:43.980]  So do not under any circumstances take that vaccine everybody listens you if you're in the government out of the government
[2:44:44.540 --> 2:44:48.620]  You're just everyday person. Don't take it because I believe that that vaccine
[2:44:49.020 --> 2:44:53.500]  Is uh is is something that's going to isolate the patriot spirit at the genetic level
[2:44:53.500 --> 2:44:56.940]  We're under siege here a hundred percent financially
[2:44:57.660 --> 2:44:59.660]  educationally medically
[2:44:59.740 --> 2:45:02.540]  Spiritually even at churches that communicable. I mean here's the bottom line
[2:45:02.620 --> 2:45:07.740]  They want the power to put a dangerous vaccine in our body whenever they want to track and trace where we go
[2:45:07.820 --> 2:45:12.940]  This is beyond 1984. It's happening now. They've thrown down the gauntlet. They've made their move
[2:45:14.060 --> 2:45:17.260]  That's absolutely true. Uh science of coercion printed, you know
[2:45:17.660 --> 2:45:22.220]  Talked about the war fighters back after world war two how they were going to achieve outcome
[2:45:22.220 --> 2:45:28.780]  With uh keystroke and that's where we're at. They can dial up the radiation. They can inject you with anything they want to
[2:45:29.420 --> 2:45:34.620]  You got to make sure that you don't take anything that that that they're pushing out and don't
[2:45:35.020 --> 2:45:38.860]  Don't feel and here's the deal they can spray it on you but metaphysically they get the bad karma
[2:45:38.940 --> 2:45:44.140]  They believe from it. They need you to agree. They can pressure you but they need you to agree
[2:45:44.540 --> 2:45:49.660]  So they don't get at least the the instant karma. It's how the dimensions work. I don't understand at all
[2:45:49.660 --> 2:45:53.500]  They know it's a loss. So do I you make somebody do something you get instant karma
[2:45:53.740 --> 2:45:58.460]  You get interdimensional karma when you die for sins. Even if you manipulated the
[2:45:59.500 --> 2:46:04.780]  The field or however it works, but they need to trick us to go along with it and at least acquiesce
[2:46:04.860 --> 2:46:10.220]  That's their satanic operation. They need us like in the garden to agree to it. Does that make sense?
[2:46:11.500 --> 2:46:16.780]  Really hosea of four sticks my people would perish for a lack of knowledge because you have rejected knowledge
[2:46:16.780 --> 2:46:20.220]  God's going to reject you you have to open up your mind to open up your heart
[2:46:20.380 --> 2:46:25.020]  You got to listen all the patriots out there. You know what to be true. Keep up to fight out. We love you
[2:46:25.100 --> 2:46:27.900]  God bless you. I love you brother. All right. I hate to do this to you
[2:46:27.980 --> 2:46:30.380]  But let's hear the degenerate joe biden the fake president
[2:46:31.020 --> 2:46:34.460]  uh saying the cult leader imagine a cult imagine jim jones or
[2:46:34.700 --> 2:46:38.620]  You know any famous cult leader saying you can only have five people in your house and wear a mask
[2:46:38.780 --> 2:46:43.340]  Imagine if kim jong-un that north korea was doing it you laugh at him, but here it is in america 2020
[2:46:43.340 --> 2:46:50.780]  Would you what is your message to people who are considering for example getting together with their families and others for Thanksgiving?
[2:46:50.860 --> 2:46:54.780]  Would you consider would you urge people to reconsider their plans? Well, here's what I do
[2:46:54.860 --> 2:46:57.820]  Let me tell you what the health experts have said to me
[2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:00.460]  um
[2:47:00.460 --> 2:47:03.820]  And it's not because i'm unique and present elect. It's because of my family
[2:47:04.780 --> 2:47:07.580]  They strongly urge that if in fact, uh
[2:47:08.380 --> 2:47:10.860]  We're going to have Thanksgiving with anyone
[2:47:10.860 --> 2:47:13.980]  That we limited to a maximum
[2:47:15.020 --> 2:47:16.060]  maximum
[2:47:16.060 --> 2:47:17.820]  They suggest five people
[2:47:17.820 --> 2:47:19.420]  maximum ten people
[2:47:19.420 --> 2:47:21.420]  socially distance wearing masks
[2:47:21.660 --> 2:47:23.660]  and people who have quarantined
[2:47:23.980 --> 2:47:25.260]  so
[2:47:25.260 --> 2:47:27.260]  Jill and I spent this morning
[2:47:27.580 --> 2:47:30.620]  Like many of you trying to figure out what are we going to do for Thanksgiving?
[2:47:31.180 --> 2:47:32.700]  How are we going to do it?
[2:47:32.700 --> 2:47:36.300]  And we've narrowed down which family members and that they were tested
[2:47:36.860 --> 2:47:38.860]  Recently tested in 24 hours
[2:47:38.860 --> 2:47:41.900]  And so I would strongly urge
[2:47:42.380 --> 2:47:46.380]  For the sake not just your sake for the sake of your children your mother your father
[2:47:47.020 --> 2:47:52.220]  Your sisters your brothers. We're gonna get together and thank you for shutting them up. Think about other new t-shirts are out
[2:47:52.220 --> 2:47:57.340]  We haven't made one yet, but others have come and take it with a turkey. I mean they're they want everything
[2:47:57.980 --> 2:48:01.740]  Okay, they want and they want this logic and fraud
[2:48:04.380 --> 2:48:07.100]  All right, I got Jeff I got email. I got julian. I got rick

[2:49:25.980 --> 2:49:36.140]  Come in China has been fully open for business for more than six months
[2:49:36.700 --> 2:49:41.580]  But the european union at every other major western nation is still under some form of lockdown
[2:49:41.820 --> 2:49:47.180]  And the lockdowns are getting more intense and people are being told they're gonna be arrested if they leave their houses
[2:49:47.260 --> 2:49:49.260]  Just like we've seen in australia
[2:49:49.820 --> 2:49:52.700]  You see the authoritarians want total control
[2:49:52.700 --> 2:49:58.540]  And because they don't respect this because the general public puts up with so much abuse. They're going for broke
[2:49:59.340 --> 2:50:03.100]  Why shouldn't they they never get in trouble for the big illegal wars and never get in trouble
[2:50:03.420 --> 2:50:07.820]  The chinese slave camps and never get in trouble for all the terrible exploitation in africa
[2:50:08.220 --> 2:50:11.820]  They never get in trouble for shipping fentanyl and other deadly drugs into our country
[2:50:12.460 --> 2:50:19.500]  And so why shouldn't they go for broke because so many people are domesticated and they're soft and they have scotcom syndrome
[2:50:19.500 --> 2:50:25.020]  They love their abusers. They can't believe they're being lied to they can't believe they're being conned
[2:50:25.500 --> 2:50:27.500]  And so they're going into bondage
[2:50:27.500 --> 2:50:31.340]  You see there's always a minority that says no and info wars is that minority
[2:50:36.300 --> 2:50:38.940]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:38.940 --> 2:50:51.660]  Our number four paul joes of watson set to take over i'm alex jones your host i'll be the co-host of going shroyer
[2:50:51.980 --> 2:50:56.620]  From georgia tomorrow on the ground with a big stop still demonstration at key domino
[2:50:56.620 --> 2:51:01.340]  We've got to stop from falling. Let's go to jeff in the great country of canada where their own
[2:51:01.980 --> 2:51:07.260]  Dictator basically through fraud uh has announced that covet is meant to make you poor by design
[2:51:07.260 --> 2:51:09.580]  And it's a good thing for you and your family
[2:51:10.220 --> 2:51:12.220]  So go ahead jeff welcome
[2:51:13.180 --> 2:51:19.180]  Thanks, sir. I take my call brother. Yes, sir. Say alex. I just wanted to uh to reiterate a dream
[2:51:19.180 --> 2:51:22.460]  I had approximately 16 years ago a dream goes like this
[2:51:22.940 --> 2:51:26.860]  I had crossed a gigantic cavern. I don't don't know how I crossed it
[2:51:26.860 --> 2:51:29.420]  I didn't know where to go and I laid down on my back
[2:51:29.500 --> 2:51:31.260]  I looked up to heaven
[2:51:31.260 --> 2:51:36.620]  And I saw a blue spiraling light and this blue spiraling light turned into like a a tornado
[2:51:36.620 --> 2:51:41.340]  And out of that blue spiraling light a dove formed a blue dove
[2:51:42.220 --> 2:51:47.100]  And I felt liquid love raindrops going entirely through me
[2:51:47.660 --> 2:51:52.300]  And a voice like a trumpet spoke to me and said a moment is only for a moment
[2:51:52.620 --> 2:51:54.620]  But a moment lasts forever
[2:51:54.620 --> 2:51:57.340]  And alex this is america's moment to stand up
[2:51:58.060 --> 2:52:03.420]  If if this moment is missed this moment will pass forever. There's a shelf life on it
[2:52:03.420 --> 2:52:07.180]  And I kudos for you for going to georgia today. They're right
[2:52:07.180 --> 2:52:13.660]  It's a dimensional jump point where they've liquefied the energy field for the future and we have to remold things now
[2:52:14.140 --> 2:52:18.620]  So our hands are in the mix the enemy's hands are in the mix. We have to be engaged right now is what you're saying
[2:52:19.820 --> 2:52:23.420]  Right and they they tell us what we're doing because they want to be the prophet
[2:52:23.580 --> 2:52:26.940]  And they want us the the main battle is for your faith
[2:52:27.100 --> 2:52:31.420]  What you believe is what you will act on and we need to resist by faith
[2:52:31.420 --> 2:52:37.180]  And follow the actions that god gives each one of us to do and in order to win this battle
[2:52:38.060 --> 2:52:41.180]  Well said jeff. Thank you so much for that great word emo in virginia
[2:52:42.380 --> 2:52:49.340]  Hey, how you doing alex? I'm pretty freaked out and fighting hard right on so that that last color was a real powerful
[2:52:49.340 --> 2:52:55.180]  Tully agree with them. So I just wanted to talk about uh, the compartmentalization of our uh, military
[2:52:56.300 --> 2:52:58.940]  Launching on a mission and the elections were going on
[2:52:58.940 --> 2:53:05.340]  And literally the guys i'm flying with were like, oh, no, you know, you know, president trump's gonna lose etc, etc
[2:53:05.660 --> 2:53:08.060]  And immediately i'm like, no, you gotta look at like
[2:53:09.100 --> 2:53:14.940]  Infowars.com band off video and look like gateway pundit and they're started opening their eyes. We're like, oh my god
[2:53:14.940 --> 2:53:18.860]  This is what's actually going on and it's uh, they're just like lacking it
[2:53:18.940 --> 2:53:20.940]  A lot of people are lacking a lot of information
[2:53:21.420 --> 2:53:26.060]  In that regard, uh, and that's why your human intelligence can override the ai
[2:53:26.060 --> 2:53:30.220]  Just your word of mouth will checkmate their entire operation. Beautifully done
[2:53:31.180 --> 2:53:35.500]  Agreed and then also even even our intelligence agencies and the personnel within it
[2:53:35.660 --> 2:53:40.860]  You know, you even mentioned on the show that they're highly restricted and the information they can receive on base
[2:53:40.940 --> 2:53:45.180]  that is uh, I can't really confirm or deny it because uh, mr. Esper put out
[2:53:45.900 --> 2:53:47.900]  a statement or a uh
[2:53:48.300 --> 2:53:50.300]  An order that basically said
[2:53:50.300 --> 2:53:58.060]  Uh, with last month is we can't talk about anything basically, uh in regards to operations. Um, but we, uh
[2:53:59.020 --> 2:54:06.140]  Um, yeah, so that you are on on track you're hitting the nail right on the head in regards to uh, covet
[2:54:06.780 --> 2:54:13.820]  Um, my father-in-law is a senator over in cambodia. Where's that stupid face mask and everything and uh,
[2:54:14.300 --> 2:54:17.980]  My wife getting you know, his daughter get an argument on the phone with them
[2:54:17.980 --> 2:54:23.900]  You know, it's a bunch of taboo theater, but he has his perceptions. What you also nailed it on the head is
[2:54:24.860 --> 2:54:28.620]  Their perception is because we have all these tests and we're testing them getting all these cases
[2:54:29.260 --> 2:54:34.460]  They think that we are the progenitors of covet not oh, yeah, because because oh, we've got to have the most tests
[2:54:34.460 --> 2:54:37.100]  We've had hundreds of times the test of any other country
[2:54:37.100 --> 2:54:41.420]  So again, if you look at a graph covet in the last 10 months goes straight up in the united states
[2:54:41.900 --> 2:54:43.900]  China does a testing more so they've stopped
[2:54:44.140 --> 2:54:46.620]  Europe stopped they want it's only where they want to do it
[2:54:46.620 --> 2:54:48.620]  But death is right here death is down
[2:54:49.260 --> 2:54:53.420]  So so so again infections are what they obsessed with never death numbers

[2:56:58.140 --> 2:57:01.420]  The devil went down to georgia. He was looking for a soul to steal
[2:57:01.420 --> 2:57:04.620]  He was in a bank because he was way behind and he was willing to make a deal
[2:57:05.020 --> 2:57:08.220]  When he came across this young man sewing on a fiddle and playing it hot
[2:57:08.540 --> 2:57:11.500]  And the devil jumped up on a hickory stumps and boy, let me tell you what
[2:57:12.140 --> 2:57:15.100]  I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player too
[2:57:15.660 --> 2:57:18.620]  And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you

[2:57:48.780 --> 2:57:50.780]  Well, I'm on my way and I'm not the devil
[2:57:52.300 --> 2:57:54.300]  Just a little bit, but I love jesus
[2:57:54.300 --> 2:57:56.300]  And so I'm on my way to georgia
[2:57:58.300 --> 2:58:01.980]  And I'm gonna be with roger stone ollie alexander and so many others fighting the steel
[2:58:02.300 --> 2:58:07.180]  What an epic time to be alive. They were already killing babies. They were already genetically engineering with clones
[2:58:07.180 --> 2:58:11.100]  They were already getting away with so much. So now they're making their full move now the fight's out in the open
[2:58:12.540 --> 2:58:18.380]  The lockdowns the marshal law the u.m. The world government the chi-com rule. I'm sad about it. It was already going on
[2:58:18.940 --> 2:58:20.940]  Now it's out in the open. Thanks to president trump

[2:58:46.060 --> 2:58:48.060]  it's it's actually
[2:58:48.060 --> 2:58:56.060]  Five times stronger it's ever been. I have just been energized by the holy spirit and my evil body and my fallen state cannot even handle it
[2:58:56.220 --> 2:58:57.420]  it's like a
[2:58:57.420 --> 2:58:59.420]  atomic fire inside a
[2:58:59.980 --> 2:59:02.380]  side of a brick building it did or
[2:59:03.340 --> 2:59:06.940]  A wood building it's I mean I'm burning down physically, but this is incredible

[3:00:32.860 --> 3:00:37.980]  An incredible time to be alive big stuff in Georgia where they want to falsely certify things
[3:00:37.980 --> 3:00:41.020]  We want the governor to call an emergency session of the legislature
[3:00:41.020 --> 3:00:44.060]  Which is supposed to happen, which he should do. I'll see you in Georgia
[3:00:44.060 --> 3:00:49.980]  Paul Joseph Watson from her britannic majesties england from summit.news takes over now
[3:00:51.980 --> 3:00:55.420]  Thanks Alex. Yeah, we're gonna be talking about once again the great reset
[3:00:55.420 --> 3:00:59.180]  But we're gonna be talking about some aspects of the great reset
[3:00:59.180 --> 3:01:02.300]  Which is this rebranding of the new world order
[3:01:02.300 --> 3:01:05.100]  Which haven't been made in public statements
[3:01:05.100 --> 3:01:09.660]  Which haven't come out so far online an actual summary that I read
[3:01:09.660 --> 3:01:16.300]  The detailed essay-length summary of what call Schwab the founder of the world economic forum
[3:01:16.300 --> 3:01:19.900]  Is actually proposing beyond covid
[3:01:19.900 --> 3:01:23.100]  Beyond what they're gonna do with the vaccination agenda
[3:01:23.100 --> 3:01:30.380]  And to the point of literal implantable microchips not just to track you but to read your mind
[3:01:30.380 --> 3:01:34.780]  And now they're talking about brain scans to cross borders
[3:01:34.780 --> 3:01:40.060]  Brain scans to travel and it's all wide open. It's out there. It's not conspiracy theory.
[3:01:40.060 --> 3:01:45.020]  It's what these globalists are saying themselves. We're gonna get into that in the next segment
[3:01:45.020 --> 3:01:47.020]  First off though
[3:01:47.020 --> 3:01:51.980]  Once again everything that we warned you about from the very start is happening in real time
[3:01:51.980 --> 3:01:55.180]  Headline this went up about 20 minutes ago on summit.news
[3:01:55.180 --> 3:01:56.780]  Paul
[3:01:56.780 --> 3:02:02.380]  Majority of brits support government making coronavirus vaccine mandatory
[3:02:02.380 --> 3:02:06.700]  And here in the United Kingdom where we're currently under lockdown too
[3:02:06.700 --> 3:02:12.780]  They're promising us that there will probably be a coronavirus vaccine available
[3:02:12.780 --> 3:02:15.660]  Before the end of the year
[3:02:15.660 --> 3:02:19.180]  Now obviously first that's gonna go out to health care workers
[3:02:19.180 --> 3:02:22.620]  But they're gonna say they're saying it's gonna be available pretty quickly
[3:02:22.620 --> 3:02:26.060]  For the general public and in preparation for that
[3:02:26.060 --> 3:02:29.260]  They're already already running polls saying that the
[3:02:29.260 --> 3:02:33.820]  Majority of the general public supports making it mandatory
[3:02:33.820 --> 3:02:36.620]  Now as I point out in this article
[3:02:36.620 --> 3:02:40.220]  And as we've learned generally over the past four years
[3:02:40.220 --> 3:02:46.460]  Polls can't be trusted because people tend to tell pollsters what they think they want to hear
[3:02:46.460 --> 3:02:49.260]  And I make the example in the article
[3:02:49.260 --> 3:02:55.020]  There's been mass support from the general public for the lockdown measures in the United Kingdom
[3:02:55.020 --> 3:03:01.340]  Generally the polls show that 70% plus of the British population support the lockdowns
[3:03:01.340 --> 3:03:07.180]  And many of them within that 70% don't think the government has gone far enough
[3:03:07.180 --> 3:03:10.140]  De facto house arrest is not far enough
[3:03:10.140 --> 3:03:13.740]  They don't even want you venturing out to do exercise for example
[3:03:13.740 --> 3:03:16.220]  But then we have other polls
[3:03:16.220 --> 3:03:22.220]  Where these same people amidst these protests which are getting bigger and more violent
[3:03:22.220 --> 3:03:26.220]  Thanks to the Metropolitan Police cracking heads
[3:03:26.220 --> 3:03:30.620]  Of course they bowed down Neil to Black Lives Matter just a matter of months ago
[3:03:30.620 --> 3:03:34.460]  But they had separate polls where they asked people to be honest
[3:03:34.460 --> 3:03:40.460]  About whether they personally abided by coronavirus lockdown restrictions
[3:03:40.460 --> 3:03:43.420]  And when people were actually honest in answering the polls
[3:03:43.420 --> 3:03:46.460]  Only 18% said they had
[3:03:46.460 --> 3:03:48.860]  So again it's this selfish thing where
[3:03:48.860 --> 3:03:53.020]  Oh yeah, obviously the draconian forefront of this imposition
[3:03:53.020 --> 3:03:57.260]  The biggest imposition on civil liberties in our generation easily
[3:03:57.260 --> 3:03:59.260]  That can be inflicted on everyone else
[3:03:59.260 --> 3:04:02.700]  But when it comes to me, I shouldn't have to abide by it
[3:04:02.700 --> 3:04:05.820]  Only 18% in the polls said they did
[3:04:05.820 --> 3:04:08.460]  But now a new YouGov poll
[3:04:08.460 --> 3:04:14.300]  Reveals that a majority of Brits support the government making the coronavirus vaccine mandatory
[3:04:14.300 --> 3:04:17.420]  By the way, the only way to make it is to make it a better vaccine
[3:04:17.420 --> 3:04:21.180]  By the way, the only way to make it mandatory for those who refuse to take it
[3:04:21.180 --> 3:04:26.700]  Is to use the police in concert with government socialised health care, the NHS
[3:04:26.700 --> 3:04:30.540]  To literally go door to door, go to people's houses, hold them down
[3:04:30.540 --> 3:04:31.980]  And forcibly inject them
[3:04:31.980 --> 3:04:34.460]  That's the only way you're making it mandatory
[3:04:34.460 --> 3:04:37.100]  Unless of course what they're actually going to do
[3:04:37.820 --> 3:04:42.540]  Is to make life a living hell if you don't take it
[3:04:42.540 --> 3:04:44.060]  And then they can still say
[3:04:44.060 --> 3:04:48.460]  Oh, but it's not mandatory, you just can't ride in a taxi
[3:04:48.460 --> 3:04:50.460]  You can't travel on an airplane
[3:04:50.460 --> 3:04:52.540]  You can't go to a concert venue
[3:04:52.540 --> 3:04:54.700]  You can't go to a sports stadium
[3:04:54.700 --> 3:04:57.820]  You can't go to a football match
[3:04:58.700 --> 3:05:01.660]  You can't have a social life
[3:05:01.660 --> 3:05:04.380]  And now they're saying, well, maybe you can't have a job
[3:05:05.020 --> 3:05:07.420]  Oh, but it's not mandatory
[3:05:07.420 --> 3:05:12.220]  You just on privilege to have any kind of normal human existence whatsoever
[3:05:12.220 --> 3:05:14.220]  But it's not mandatory
[3:05:14.220 --> 3:05:15.900]  Participants rest
[3:05:15.900 --> 3:05:19.660]  Once the coronavirus vaccine is available, would you support or oppose the government
[3:05:19.660 --> 3:05:23.260]  Making it legally compulsory for all people in Britain to be vaccinated?
[3:05:23.900 --> 3:05:26.060]  49% said yes
[3:05:26.620 --> 3:05:28.620]  34% said no
[3:05:28.620 --> 3:05:30.460]  17% said they don't know
[3:05:30.460 --> 3:05:33.420]  So the majority say the government should make it mandatory
[3:05:34.220 --> 3:05:39.500]  And then when you break it down along age, gender and political party affiliation
[3:05:39.500 --> 3:05:44.860]  It's actually interesting more men than women support making it mandatory
[3:05:44.860 --> 3:05:49.020]  And in fact, more conservative party affiliated people
[3:05:49.020 --> 3:05:52.300]  Compared to Labour, which is the left-wing party in Britain
[3:05:52.300 --> 3:05:54.300]  Support making it mandatory
[3:05:54.300 --> 3:05:59.020]  So even the party that's supposed to be more at the forefront of protecting liberties
[3:05:59.580 --> 3:06:03.420]  More of their supporters support making this mandatory
[3:06:03.420 --> 3:06:07.580]  And in the next segment, we're going to get on to how that's going to be enforced
[3:06:07.580 --> 3:06:09.820]  We're going to talk about what's happening in Denmark
[3:06:10.780 --> 3:06:15.260]  Where their government had a similar law to forcibly inject people
[3:06:15.260 --> 3:06:19.260]  They had nine straight days of protests and the government back down
[3:06:19.260 --> 3:06:23.420]  But then again, just because they don't make it mandatory in law
[3:06:23.420 --> 3:06:26.940]  Doesn't mean that they're not going to make your life a living hell
[3:06:26.940 --> 3:06:28.860]  If you refuse to take it
[3:06:28.860 --> 3:06:31.660]  And I think that's way more likely to happen
[3:06:31.660 --> 3:06:35.100]  Than having police literally hold people down and inject them
[3:06:35.100 --> 3:06:38.300]  We'll talk about that and the great reset and a lot more in the next segment
[3:06:38.300 --> 3:06:39.660]  Summit.News
[3:06:39.660 --> 3:06:41.500]  Don't go away
[3:06:41.500 --> 3:06:42.620]  It really is simple
[3:06:42.620 --> 3:06:44.460]  The left are into being deviant
[3:06:44.460 --> 3:06:46.220]  And I don't mean sexually deviant
[3:06:46.220 --> 3:06:47.660]  That goes the territory
[3:06:48.220 --> 3:06:50.540]  I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors
[3:06:50.540 --> 3:06:52.220]  Deviant against their own species
[3:06:52.860 --> 3:06:54.620]  Deviant against the order of nature
[3:06:55.180 --> 3:06:57.580]  Even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous
[3:06:57.580 --> 3:07:00.060]  They still do it because they want to play God
[3:07:00.060 --> 3:07:02.220]  Everything they touch, they destroy
[3:07:02.220 --> 3:07:06.300]  Their sacrament is aborting babies and then using their body parts
[3:07:06.300 --> 3:07:11.020]  Their religion is not taking care of the old but euthanizing them
[3:07:11.020 --> 3:07:14.460]  Their whole system is designed for the UN to keep their world countries
[3:07:14.460 --> 3:07:17.260]  In serious poverty and poor ballooning populations
[3:07:17.260 --> 3:07:20.300]  And then watching all that new fruit down the vine
[3:07:20.300 --> 3:07:23.660]  To continually reproduce the same nightmares
[3:07:23.660 --> 3:07:24.940]  Over and over and over again
[3:07:24.940 --> 3:07:26.700]  They truly are the children of Satan
[3:07:26.700 --> 3:07:27.980]  They are the children of the devil
[3:07:27.980 --> 3:07:29.660]  And if you look at the slaves that serve them
[3:07:29.660 --> 3:07:31.180]  Byton and Kamala Harris
[3:07:31.180 --> 3:07:32.700]  It really is manifested
[3:07:32.700 --> 3:07:34.940]  Being a slave of Satan is not profitable
[3:07:34.940 --> 3:07:36.540]  Sin is not profitable
[3:07:36.540 --> 3:08:06.460]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWare
[3:08:06.460 --> 3:08:07.740]  They are gaining ground
[3:08:07.740 --> 3:08:10.140]  That is President Trump, Republican Party
[3:08:10.140 --> 3:08:12.540]  The American people, the populace, the patriots
[3:08:12.540 --> 3:08:13.260]  The enemy
[3:08:13.260 --> 3:08:15.340]  The Democrats, backed by the shy comms
[3:08:15.340 --> 3:08:17.420]  Backed by the European Union, backed by Hollywood
[3:08:17.420 --> 3:08:18.300]  Backed by the left
[3:08:18.300 --> 3:08:19.900]  The blue cities, the blue states
[3:08:19.900 --> 3:08:22.700]  They are in a rage trying to gaslight us
[3:08:22.700 --> 3:08:24.540]  Keep calling Biden President-elect
[3:08:24.540 --> 3:08:25.180]  He's not
[3:08:25.180 --> 3:08:28.540]  President has to concede and or all of the states
[3:08:28.540 --> 3:08:30.700]  Have to certify the vote, which hasn't happened yet
[3:08:30.700 --> 3:08:33.180]  And then you have to have the electors seek
[3:08:33.180 --> 3:08:35.020]  Who is going to be the president
[3:08:35.020 --> 3:08:37.180]  And this may be a dispute that goes back to the states
[3:08:37.180 --> 3:08:38.620]  That's why it's in the Constitution
[3:08:38.620 --> 3:09:05.740]  And the Constitution's kicking in
[3:09:05.740 --> 3:09:07.500]  So we have this big misdirection
[3:09:07.500 --> 3:09:10.300]  Taking place currently in many Western countries
[3:09:10.300 --> 3:09:12.060]  Over this sphere of governments
[3:09:12.060 --> 3:09:14.860]  Making the coronavirus vaccine mandatory
[3:09:15.420 --> 3:09:18.060]  They're not going to make it mandatory in America
[3:09:18.060 --> 3:09:20.540]  Because you have a little something called the Second Amendment
[3:09:20.540 --> 3:09:23.020]  And what, 75 million gun owners
[3:09:23.020 --> 3:09:24.300]  Good luck with that
[3:09:24.300 --> 3:09:25.900]  But even in Europe
[3:09:25.900 --> 3:09:27.660]  The governments aren't going to put this into law
[3:09:27.660 --> 3:09:29.340]  In fact, they tried to put it into law
[3:09:29.980 --> 3:09:31.020]  In Denmark
[3:09:32.060 --> 3:09:33.740]  And we have a headline here
[3:09:33.740 --> 3:09:35.100]  Out of Denmark
[3:09:35.100 --> 3:09:36.060]  Where they had
[3:09:36.060 --> 3:09:38.620]  Nine straight days of protests
[3:09:38.620 --> 3:09:40.620]  Forced vaccination law in Denmark
[3:09:40.620 --> 3:09:42.940]  Abandoned after public protests
[3:09:42.940 --> 3:09:45.500]  A law in Denmark that would have given authorities the power
[3:09:46.220 --> 3:09:49.100]  To forcibly inject people with the coronavirus vaccine
[3:09:49.100 --> 3:09:52.380]  Has been abandoned after nine days of public protests
[3:09:52.380 --> 3:09:55.660]  So they had what they called an epidemic law
[3:09:55.660 --> 3:09:58.060]  Which would have handed the Danish government the power
[3:09:58.060 --> 3:09:59.900]  To enact mandatory quarantine measures
[3:09:59.900 --> 3:10:02.380]  Against anyone infected with a dangerous disease
[3:10:02.380 --> 3:10:04.060]  Which, by the way, they already put through
[3:10:04.060 --> 3:10:06.060]  In New Zealand and Canada
[3:10:06.060 --> 3:10:08.300]  Where the Prime Minister of New Zealand
[3:10:08.300 --> 3:10:11.580]  Literally said they'd intern people in quarantine camps
[3:10:11.580 --> 3:10:13.420]  Until they tested negative
[3:10:13.420 --> 3:10:15.100]  And that happened in some cases
[3:10:16.940 --> 3:10:18.620]  But it was the part about vaccinations
[3:10:18.620 --> 3:10:20.620]  That caused the biggest uproar for Danes
[3:10:21.580 --> 3:10:24.220]  The local reporter that the Danish Health Authority
[3:10:24.220 --> 3:10:25.980]  Would be able to define groups of people
[3:10:25.980 --> 3:10:27.660]  Who must be vaccinated
[3:10:27.660 --> 3:10:30.540]  In order to contain and eliminate a dangerous disease
[3:10:31.100 --> 3:10:33.820]  Said people refused the above can in some situations
[3:10:33.820 --> 3:10:37.660]  Be coerced through physical detainment
[3:10:37.660 --> 3:10:40.060]  With police allowed to assist
[3:10:40.060 --> 3:10:43.100]  That means them grabbing you with the cops
[3:10:43.660 --> 3:10:46.380]  Forcing you down on the ground and injecting you with a syringe
[3:10:46.380 --> 3:10:48.620]  That sounds very safe, doesn't it?
[3:10:49.180 --> 3:10:53.740]  That sounds very medically within guidelines
[3:10:54.300 --> 3:10:56.780]  However, after nine straight days of protests
[3:10:56.780 --> 3:10:58.780]  Against a new law, it has now been scrapped
[3:11:00.540 --> 3:11:02.620]  So again, you can protest against it
[3:11:02.620 --> 3:11:04.060]  Being put into law
[3:11:04.060 --> 3:11:05.980]  But does that really matter
[3:11:05.980 --> 3:11:08.380]  When they don't even need to put it into law
[3:11:08.380 --> 3:11:10.380]  Because they've got all the corporations
[3:11:10.380 --> 3:11:11.980]  Including all the airline industry
[3:11:11.980 --> 3:11:13.500]  Which I'm going to get on to
[3:11:13.500 --> 3:11:14.940]  And even down to Uber
[3:11:15.660 --> 3:11:18.380]  Saying if you don't abide by coronavirus restrictions
[3:11:18.380 --> 3:11:20.380]  In that case, mask wearing
[3:11:21.020 --> 3:11:23.980]  You're going to be banned from using their service
[3:11:23.980 --> 3:11:25.820]  They don't have to put it into law
[3:11:26.460 --> 3:11:27.740]  Headline out of the sun
[3:11:28.780 --> 3:11:31.660]  Matt Hancock refuses to rule out making COVID vaccine
[3:11:31.660 --> 3:11:33.740]  Mandatory again, this is in the UK
[3:11:33.740 --> 3:11:36.220]  Health Secretary Matt Hancock has refused to rule out
[3:11:36.220 --> 3:11:38.140]  Making the COVID vaccine mandatory
[3:11:38.140 --> 3:11:39.500]  As ministers state
[3:11:39.500 --> 3:11:43.020]  The public needs to be persuaded that the jab is safe
[3:11:44.060 --> 3:11:45.020]  Last night was revealed
[3:11:45.020 --> 3:11:47.500]  That the government has secured five million doses
[3:11:48.380 --> 3:11:49.660]  Of the Moderna vaccine
[3:11:49.660 --> 3:11:51.260]  After trials showed the jab
[3:11:51.260 --> 3:11:53.900]  Is 94.5% effective
[3:11:53.900 --> 3:11:56.140]  Of course, if you're under the age of 70
[3:11:56.140 --> 3:11:57.180]  And you're healthy
[3:11:57.180 --> 3:12:03.420]  Your 99.1% was it 89% protected from coronavirus anyway
[3:12:03.420 --> 3:12:04.620]  But take the shot
[3:12:05.500 --> 3:12:06.780]  This is the key article though
[3:12:06.780 --> 3:12:08.460]  Again, exemplifying the point
[3:12:08.460 --> 3:12:10.140]  They don't need to put it into law
[3:12:10.700 --> 3:12:13.500]  UKMP suggests people who shouldn't be allowed
[3:12:13.500 --> 3:12:16.620]  Shouldn't be allowed to work without COVID vaccine
[3:12:17.500 --> 3:12:20.540]  Now, of course, we saw during the lockdown in Australia
[3:12:20.540 --> 3:12:23.980]  They literally had police and national guard on the highways
[3:12:23.980 --> 3:12:26.220]  Checking people's work permits
[3:12:26.220 --> 3:12:29.260]  To see if they were allowed to go to work during the lockdown
[3:12:29.260 --> 3:12:33.580]  And now we have, once again, a conservative MP
[3:12:33.580 --> 3:12:35.340]  Because this is really conservative
[3:12:35.900 --> 3:12:37.020]  Coming out once again
[3:12:37.020 --> 3:12:38.700]  This is Tom Cuggenhatt
[3:12:39.580 --> 3:12:42.940]  Saying that people won't be allowed to have employment
[3:12:42.940 --> 3:12:44.940]  If they don't take the vaccine
[3:12:44.940 --> 3:12:47.340]  Oh, but it's not going to be mandatory
[3:12:47.340 --> 3:12:49.020]  You're just not allowed to have a job
[3:12:49.660 --> 3:12:50.940]  You're not allowed to have a home
[3:12:50.940 --> 3:12:52.620]  You're not allowed to pay your bills
[3:12:52.620 --> 3:12:54.060]  You're going to be out on the street
[3:12:54.060 --> 3:12:55.820]  Destitute and homeless
[3:12:55.820 --> 3:12:57.340]  But it's not mandatory
[3:12:58.060 --> 3:13:00.060]  British MP faced backlash Monday
[3:13:00.060 --> 3:13:03.180]  After suggesting that employees in the UK
[3:13:03.180 --> 3:13:04.860]  Should not be allowed to go to work
[3:13:05.580 --> 3:13:06.380]  Unless they...
[3:13:06.380 --> 3:13:09.340]  Bearing in mind the economy is basically on its knees at this point
[3:13:10.060 --> 3:13:11.820]  There are no jobs anyway
[3:13:11.820 --> 3:13:12.940]  But now you're not going to get one
[3:13:12.940 --> 3:13:14.940]  If you don't have the vaccine certificate
[3:13:15.740 --> 3:13:19.180]  Unless they can prove that they have been vaccinated against COVID-19
[3:13:19.900 --> 3:13:21.820]  He said, quote, if vaccination works
[3:13:21.820 --> 3:13:25.820]  And if we're confident it's safe and all indications so far are good
[3:13:25.820 --> 3:13:28.380]  Then I can certainly see the day when businesses say, look
[3:13:28.380 --> 3:13:29.740]  You've got to return to the office
[3:13:29.740 --> 3:13:32.860]  And if you're not vaccinated, you're not coming in
[3:13:32.860 --> 3:13:34.860]  And by the way, when he says businesses
[3:13:34.860 --> 3:13:38.060]  That's not just businesses that people work for
[3:13:38.060 --> 3:13:41.340]  That's businesses that you go in to buy products from
[3:13:42.140 --> 3:13:43.660]  That's supermarkets
[3:13:44.300 --> 3:13:46.140]  No going into the supermarket
[3:13:46.140 --> 3:13:48.620]  No buying food if you don't have the vaccine
[3:13:48.620 --> 3:13:52.220]  This is how it started with mandatory mask rules
[3:13:52.220 --> 3:13:54.860]  This is how it started with NHS track and trace
[3:13:54.860 --> 3:13:56.060]  You can't go into the pub
[3:13:56.620 --> 3:13:59.260]  In some cases, if you don't have this government tracking app
[3:13:59.260 --> 3:14:00.860]  Downloaded on your phone
[3:14:00.860 --> 3:14:03.420]  And then it moves on to the vaccine
[3:14:04.220 --> 3:14:07.260]  So once again, they don't need to put it into law
[3:14:07.260 --> 3:14:09.580]  They just need to make your life a living hell
[3:14:09.580 --> 3:14:11.660]  For you to comply and submit
[3:14:12.380 --> 3:14:13.660]  And people will submit
[3:14:13.660 --> 3:14:15.420]  And this is exemplified in this headline
[3:14:15.980 --> 3:14:17.180]  Inject me now
[3:14:17.180 --> 3:14:20.460]  Now, concert goers demand mandatory vaccination
[3:14:20.460 --> 3:14:22.860]  So they're allowed to see live music again
[3:14:22.860 --> 3:14:26.700]  So because people are desperate to see some crap band
[3:14:27.820 --> 3:14:28.540]  They're begging
[3:14:29.100 --> 3:14:31.980]  They're begging for the government to inject them
[3:14:31.980 --> 3:14:34.540]  With this untested COVID vaccine
[3:14:35.340 --> 3:14:38.860]  And of course, this arose out of a ticketmaster
[3:14:39.580 --> 3:14:41.420]  Who came out a couple of weeks ago
[3:14:42.060 --> 3:14:45.900]  And said that they're not going to allow people to buy
[3:14:45.900 --> 3:14:48.140]  concert tickets on their website
[3:14:48.140 --> 3:14:52.700]  Unless they first proved that they've taken the vaccine
[3:14:52.700 --> 3:14:56.620]  Or at least had a negative test within the past few days
[3:14:57.340 --> 3:14:59.180]  There's a report in Billboard magazine
[3:14:59.180 --> 3:15:02.060]  Plamed that the ticketing company would mandate customers
[3:15:02.060 --> 3:15:04.140]  To prove they'd had a negative COVID test
[3:15:04.140 --> 3:15:08.860]  Or had taken the vaccine before their purchase was approved
[3:15:09.820 --> 3:15:11.820]  Now, it came out a couple of days later
[3:15:11.820 --> 3:15:13.580]  After somewhat of a backlash
[3:15:13.580 --> 3:15:15.900]  They kind of tried to walk it back a bit
[3:15:15.900 --> 3:15:19.500]  And said that they were just exploring the idea
[3:15:19.500 --> 3:15:22.300]  And that there would be absolutely no requirement
[3:15:22.300 --> 3:15:24.300]  For mandated vaccines
[3:15:25.020 --> 3:15:28.860]  But then they said that such a decision would be in the hands
[3:15:28.860 --> 3:15:30.380]  Of the event organizer
[3:15:30.380 --> 3:15:33.900]  So again, shifting the book, shifting the blame
[3:15:33.900 --> 3:15:35.260]  To the event organizers
[3:15:35.260 --> 3:15:38.060]  So they don't have to take the heat for the policy
[3:15:38.060 --> 3:15:42.300]  But of course it will be coordinated with the concert venues
[3:15:42.300 --> 3:15:44.300]  So when you try to go to the music concert
[3:15:44.300 --> 3:15:46.780]  When you try to go to the sports game
[3:15:47.420 --> 3:15:50.300]  You won't even be allowed to buy the ticket in the first place
[3:15:50.300 --> 3:15:53.180]  If you haven't first proved that you're a good citizen
[3:15:53.180 --> 3:15:55.980]  And you've taken the mandatory injection
[3:15:56.780 --> 3:15:58.780]  It was interesting though in this article
[3:15:58.780 --> 3:16:02.780]  Because it was based on a BBC news report
[3:16:02.780 --> 3:16:04.780]  And they claimed, quote,
[3:16:04.780 --> 3:16:08.540]  The majority of fans welcomed the move
[3:16:08.540 --> 3:16:12.780]  If it would mean the resumption of live music
[3:16:12.780 --> 3:16:15.260]  And that's where this headline was derived from
[3:16:15.260 --> 3:16:17.020]  Because one individual on Twitter
[3:16:18.140 --> 3:16:19.980]  Called Stacey, said, quote,
[3:16:19.980 --> 3:16:20.940]  Inject me now
[3:16:21.740 --> 3:16:23.180]  Another one said, honestly,
[3:16:23.180 --> 3:16:26.140]  I would do anything to go to a concert right now
[3:16:26.140 --> 3:16:30.460]  But they claimed that this was the majority of the consensus
[3:16:30.460 --> 3:16:31.980]  The majority opinion
[3:16:31.980 --> 3:16:35.100]  That people were begging to be injected with the vaccine
[3:16:35.100 --> 3:16:38.140]  Because they were that desperate to go out and see live music
[3:16:38.140 --> 3:16:39.900]  I went on this Twitter thread
[3:16:39.900 --> 3:16:41.740]  When I wrote this article
[3:16:41.740 --> 3:16:44.300]  This official billboard magazine tweet
[3:16:44.860 --> 3:16:48.940]  Which said, how ticketmaster plans to check your vaccine status for concerts
[3:16:48.940 --> 3:16:51.180]  The majority of the people on the thread
[3:16:52.300 --> 3:16:53.820]  Didn't welcome the move
[3:16:54.460 --> 3:16:58.860]  The majority of the people that I saw, 80-90%, said
[3:16:58.860 --> 3:17:01.740]  God forbid, no, I will never submit to this
[3:17:02.300 --> 3:17:06.460]  That didn't stop the BBC from literally reporting the opposite
[3:17:06.460 --> 3:17:09.740]  Because again, they're trying to create this fake consensus
[3:17:09.740 --> 3:17:13.180]  That the vast majority of people don't have a problem with this
[3:17:13.180 --> 3:17:14.620]  And that they will go along with it
[3:17:14.620 --> 3:17:18.940]  Which is why you had the poll a couple of hours ago
[3:17:18.940 --> 3:17:20.540]  Which I started the broadcast with
[3:17:21.100 --> 3:17:24.460]  Where they say that 49% of the public support it
[3:17:24.460 --> 3:17:27.500]  But again, a lot of that is based on the fact that
[3:17:27.500 --> 3:17:31.420]  People tell pollsters because they're so cowed into submission
[3:17:31.420 --> 3:17:33.980]  And parroting what they think is the consensus
[3:17:33.980 --> 3:17:35.980]  Into telling them what they think
[3:17:35.980 --> 3:17:37.420]  What will happen? Will there be resistance?
[3:17:37.420 --> 3:17:38.460]  It remains to be seen
[3:17:38.460 --> 3:17:39.260]  Don't go away with this
[3:17:39.260 --> 3:17:39.980]  Look it up for yourself
[3:17:39.980 --> 3:17:43.020]  The head of the Davos group issued a report more than six months ago
[3:17:43.020 --> 3:17:47.100]  Calling for world government to be openly established
[3:17:47.100 --> 3:17:48.860]  To respond to COVID-19
[3:17:48.860 --> 3:17:53.340]  And the COVID-19 was a blessing to lower the planet's carbon footprint
[3:17:53.340 --> 3:17:56.220]  Since then, Prince Charles and countless others
[3:17:56.220 --> 3:17:59.020]  Have come out and said the exact same thing
[3:17:59.020 --> 3:18:02.780]  The most ancient form of total war is called
[3:18:02.780 --> 3:18:04.220]  Siege
[3:18:04.220 --> 3:18:07.260]  And that's when you cut people off from their resources
[3:18:07.260 --> 3:18:08.780]  That's when you lock them down
[3:18:09.580 --> 3:18:12.060]  And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalist
[3:18:12.060 --> 3:18:13.260]  Or just get rid of Donald Trump
[3:18:13.260 --> 3:18:14.060]  That's only part of it
[3:18:14.060 --> 3:18:16.860]  This is siege to literally train us to be poor
[3:18:16.860 --> 3:18:18.380]  And to get us into deep debt
[3:18:18.380 --> 3:18:21.820]  So then the globalist social engineers can dictate
[3:18:21.820 --> 3:18:23.260]  How we live our lives
[3:18:23.260 --> 3:18:26.620]  With the social credit score surveillance threat
[3:18:26.620 --> 3:18:28.380]  So you've heard the US Army saying
[3:18:28.380 --> 3:18:30.380]  Our job is to kill people and break things
[3:18:30.380 --> 3:18:32.860]  Well, that's what the lockdown's doing
[3:18:32.860 --> 3:18:34.060]  It's starving the third world
[3:18:34.060 --> 3:18:35.100]  Millions and millions of debt
[3:18:35.100 --> 3:18:37.260]  It's breaking down the supply chain in society
[3:18:37.260 --> 3:18:38.380]  It's their mission
[3:18:39.660 --> 3:18:41.980]  Warning, warning, warning
[3:18:41.980 --> 3:18:46.700]  There is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover
[3:18:46.700 --> 3:18:49.020]  The giant third world collapse
[3:18:49.020 --> 3:18:51.260]  And a new world war that is going to be triggered
[3:18:51.260 --> 3:18:52.860]  By the new COVID lockdown
[3:18:52.860 --> 3:18:58.060]  Announced by globalist systems in Europe, in Asia, and now in the United States
[3:18:58.060 --> 3:19:00.940]  Joe Biden is set to announce today
[3:19:00.940 --> 3:19:03.500]  That he has a new COVID task force
[3:19:03.500 --> 3:19:05.900]  That is calling for a national mask mandate
[3:19:05.900 --> 3:19:10.540]  To prove your servitude, contact tracing, forced inoculations coming
[3:19:10.540 --> 3:19:13.420]  But most importantly, a new lockdown
[3:19:13.420 --> 3:19:16.860]  That way he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID
[3:19:16.860 --> 3:19:20.860]  And claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID
[3:19:20.860 --> 3:19:23.660]  Then of course, when that new lockdown doesn't work
[3:19:23.660 --> 3:19:26.060]  Those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown
[3:19:26.060 --> 3:19:28.140]  Are going to be blamed for it
[3:19:28.140 --> 3:19:30.060]  And that's when all the mass arrests start
[3:19:30.060 --> 3:19:32.300]  Sometime towards the end of next year
[3:19:32.300 --> 3:19:34.940]  This is a permanent martial law plan
[3:19:34.940 --> 3:19:37.580]  Trump must be impudiated, exposed to how she engaged
[3:19:37.580 --> 3:20:06.860]  And the UN takeover, not play games with it
[3:20:06.860 --> 3:20:08.860]  So both these are amazing products
[3:20:08.860 --> 3:20:10.300]  And they fund the Info War
[3:20:10.300 --> 3:20:11.900]  Which is a 360 win
[3:20:11.900 --> 3:20:14.220]  On top of it, despite the factory demand
[3:20:14.220 --> 3:20:15.580]  They've been sold out for months
[3:20:15.580 --> 3:20:18.140]  They're both 50% off
[3:20:18.140 --> 3:20:19.900]  Triple Patriot points
[3:20:19.900 --> 3:20:22.620]  And free shipping at infowarstore.com
[3:20:22.620 --> 3:20:24.620]  That's bio, true selenium
[3:20:24.620 --> 3:20:27.020]  From the mustard seed, it's amazing
[3:20:27.020 --> 3:20:29.180]  And on top of it, we also have bodies
[3:20:29.180 --> 3:20:30.620]  Ultimate turmeric formula
[3:20:30.620 --> 3:20:32.700]  At infowarstore.com
[3:20:32.700 --> 3:20:34.540]  This sale will not last long
[3:20:34.540 --> 3:20:35.740]  I want to thank you all for your support
[3:20:35.740 --> 3:20:37.180]  And really to try these products
[3:20:37.180 --> 3:20:38.060]  People absolutely love them

[3:20:39.180 --> 3:21:06.140]  In infowarstore.com
[3:21:06.140 --> 3:21:08.380]  It will then ask you to name the app
[3:21:08.380 --> 3:21:10.540]  I suggest band.video
[3:21:10.540 --> 3:21:12.860]  You will now have band.video app
[3:21:12.860 --> 3:21:13.900]  On your home screen
[3:21:13.900 --> 3:21:15.980]  Despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it
[3:21:15.980 --> 3:21:17.500]  The globalists think you're lazy
[3:21:17.500 --> 3:21:18.940]  But by taking a little bit of action
[3:21:18.940 --> 3:21:21.340]  You can override them, have the app
[3:21:21.340 --> 3:21:22.940]  And then tell others about it
[3:21:22.940 --> 3:21:24.460]  So they can get the app
[3:21:24.460 --> 3:21:26.860]  So it's up to you whether you wanted to find big tech
[3:21:26.860 --> 3:21:28.620]  And click the share buttons below

[3:21:32.300 --> 3:21:43.420]  Be sure and share band.video
[3:21:43.420 --> 3:21:53.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:21:53.420 --> 3:22:03.420]  You're listening to the summit.news radio hour
[3:22:03.420 --> 3:22:04.540]  Of course the global elite
[3:22:04.540 --> 3:22:05.740]  Over the past four years
[3:22:05.740 --> 3:22:07.260]  This has particularly come to prominence
[3:22:07.260 --> 3:22:08.380]  Over the past few weeks
[3:22:08.380 --> 3:22:10.860]  And openly announced that their rebranding
[3:22:10.860 --> 3:22:11.980]  Of the new world order
[3:22:11.980 --> 3:22:14.700]  Is called the great reset
[3:22:14.700 --> 3:22:15.820]  And in his books
[3:22:15.820 --> 3:22:17.660]  Klaus Schwab
[3:22:17.660 --> 3:22:20.460]  The originator of the great reset
[3:22:20.460 --> 3:22:22.860]  Literally admits that there's been mass resistance
[3:22:22.860 --> 3:22:25.260]  The new world order to the global centralization
[3:22:25.260 --> 3:22:27.260]  Of power over the past 20 years
[3:22:27.260 --> 3:22:30.540]  And that they need a new excuse
[3:22:30.540 --> 3:22:31.580]  To rebrand it
[3:22:31.580 --> 3:22:33.740]  And in the words of Justin Trudeau
[3:22:33.740 --> 3:22:35.980]  They need to exploit the quote
[3:22:35.980 --> 3:22:39.740]  Opportunity that COVID-19 has provided
[3:22:39.740 --> 3:22:42.300]  For them to reinitiate that agenda
[3:22:42.300 --> 3:22:43.740]  And in fact
[3:22:43.740 --> 3:22:45.500]  The great reset was trending
[3:22:45.500 --> 3:22:48.620]  For hours and hours on Twitter yesterday
[3:22:48.620 --> 3:22:50.860]  Basically half the trend was a bunch of people
[3:22:50.860 --> 3:22:52.540]  Claiming it was a conspiracy theory
[3:22:52.540 --> 3:22:55.340]  It's literally in the world economic forum's documents
[3:22:55.340 --> 3:22:58.380]  Time magazine has giant sections on their website
[3:22:58.380 --> 3:22:59.740]  Boasting about it
[3:22:59.740 --> 3:23:01.420]  But it's still a conspiracy theory
[3:23:02.300 --> 3:23:03.740]  What most people don't realize though
[3:23:03.740 --> 3:23:07.260]  Is that it goes far deeper than just restructuring
[3:23:07.260 --> 3:23:08.460]  The economic system
[3:23:08.460 --> 3:23:10.300]  Which is how it was introduced
[3:23:10.300 --> 3:23:12.060]  At least in the public eye
[3:23:12.060 --> 3:23:14.300]  By our friend Klaus Schwab
[3:23:14.940 --> 3:23:16.540]  We had this headline yesterday
[3:23:17.500 --> 3:23:18.220]  Klaus Schwab
[3:23:18.220 --> 3:23:19.900]  The great reset will lead to a fusion
[3:23:19.900 --> 3:23:23.660]  Of our physical, digital and biological identity
[3:23:24.620 --> 3:23:27.020]  And he's made it clear that transhumanism
[3:23:27.020 --> 3:23:28.940]  Is an integral part of the great reset
[3:23:28.940 --> 3:23:31.020]  When he said the fourth industrial revolution
[3:23:31.020 --> 3:23:32.860]  Would lead to a fusion of our physical,
[3:23:32.860 --> 3:23:35.420]  Digital and biological identity
[3:23:35.420 --> 3:23:38.220]  Which in his book he clarifies is implantable
[3:23:38.220 --> 3:23:41.740]  Microchips that can read your thoughts
[3:23:41.740 --> 3:23:44.300]  And I did another article on this today
[3:23:44.300 --> 3:23:45.900]  Because there's so much information
[3:23:46.860 --> 3:23:48.780]  In these three books that he has written
[3:23:48.780 --> 3:23:50.140]  Over the past four years
[3:23:51.660 --> 3:23:54.060]  One of them called the fourth industrial revolution
[3:23:54.060 --> 3:23:56.300]  The second one was called shaping the future
[3:23:56.300 --> 3:23:58.220]  Of the fourth industrial revolution
[3:23:58.220 --> 3:24:00.220]  And the most recent one of course was called
[3:24:01.020 --> 3:24:03.500]  COVID-19 The Great Reset
[3:24:03.500 --> 3:24:05.420]  And in these three books he lays out
[3:24:05.420 --> 3:24:06.700]  How this is a plan
[3:24:06.700 --> 3:24:10.460]  Not just for total draconian techno-crap-crap
[3:24:10.460 --> 3:24:13.340]  Tracking and control of the global population
[3:24:13.340 --> 3:24:17.020]  But it's literally about creating their favorite thing
[3:24:17.020 --> 3:24:20.780]  Which Ray Kurzweil talked about back in the late 90s
[3:24:20.780 --> 3:24:22.940]  In the age of spiritual machines
[3:24:22.940 --> 3:24:26.060]  Which is merging man with machine
[3:24:26.060 --> 3:24:28.700]  Literally creating human cyborgs
[3:24:29.340 --> 3:24:32.140]  And those people who refuse to become a human cyborg
[3:24:32.140 --> 3:24:35.580]  Well they'll be left on the dumpster heap of history
[3:24:36.300 --> 3:24:38.620]  They'll be a lower caste race basically
[3:24:39.180 --> 3:24:40.140]  They'll be ignored
[3:24:40.140 --> 3:24:41.500]  They won't be able to travel
[3:24:41.500 --> 3:24:43.420]  They won't be able to buy train tickets
[3:24:43.420 --> 3:24:45.900]  They won't be able to go to pop concerts
[3:24:45.900 --> 3:24:48.060]  And as we talked about earlier
[3:24:48.060 --> 3:24:50.380]  They won't be able to get jobs
[3:24:51.020 --> 3:24:52.540]  Now there's a lengthy article
[3:24:53.660 --> 3:24:57.820]  On a website called winteroak.org.uk
[3:24:58.700 --> 3:24:59.660]  And the headline is
[3:24:59.660 --> 3:25:02.620]  Klaus Schwab and his great fascist reset
[3:25:03.420 --> 3:25:05.580]  And this is a guy who's read all three books
[3:25:05.580 --> 3:25:06.540]  And this is basically
[3:25:06.540 --> 3:25:09.020]  It's probably a 25 page article
[3:25:09.980 --> 3:25:12.540]  Outlining the great reset agenda
[3:25:12.540 --> 3:25:14.620]  That goes way beyond public statements
[3:25:14.620 --> 3:25:15.820]  Video statements
[3:25:15.820 --> 3:25:19.020]  What you saw Trudeau saying to the UN conference there
[3:25:19.020 --> 3:25:23.420]  And it talks about the actual fully fleshed agenda
[3:25:24.060 --> 3:25:25.900]  And I'm going to get into some of it now
[3:25:25.900 --> 3:25:28.460]  Because it goes way beyond the economic factors
[3:25:28.460 --> 3:25:29.420]  That they're trying to introduce
[3:25:29.420 --> 3:25:31.900]  They're trying to dismantle the global capitalist system
[3:25:31.900 --> 3:25:32.300]  Of course
[3:25:32.860 --> 3:25:34.620]  To redistribute the wealth
[3:25:34.620 --> 3:25:35.740]  But of course that only means
[3:25:36.380 --> 3:25:38.940]  Distributing it to an increasing concentration
[3:25:38.940 --> 3:25:40.460]  Amongst themselves
[3:25:41.580 --> 3:25:42.780]  And in this article
[3:25:42.780 --> 3:25:46.700]  The writer points out that in his 2016 book
[3:25:46.700 --> 3:25:48.380]  The Fourth Industrial Revolution
[3:25:48.380 --> 3:25:49.500]  This was the first one
[3:25:50.380 --> 3:25:51.660]  Klaus Schwab
[3:25:51.660 --> 3:25:53.740]  Who sounds like Dr. Strangelove by the way
[3:25:53.740 --> 3:25:54.780]  If you've seen his videos
[3:25:54.780 --> 3:25:55.660]  Very appropriate
[3:25:56.300 --> 3:25:58.460]  Writes about the uberization of work
[3:25:58.460 --> 3:26:01.100]  And the consequent advantages for companies
[3:26:01.100 --> 3:26:04.140]  Particularly fast growing stops in the digital economy
[3:26:04.620 --> 3:26:06.460]  He says as human cloud platforms
[3:26:06.460 --> 3:26:08.380]  Classify workers as self-employed
[3:26:08.380 --> 3:26:11.020]  They are for the moment free of the requirement
[3:26:11.020 --> 3:26:13.900]  To pay minimum wages, employer taxes
[3:26:13.900 --> 3:26:16.060]  And social benefits
[3:26:16.060 --> 3:26:18.940]  So again this is all about concentrating wealth
[3:26:18.940 --> 3:26:21.660]  Into the giant transnational corporations
[3:26:21.660 --> 3:26:24.700]  It has nothing to do with solving wealth inequality
[3:26:24.700 --> 3:26:27.500]  Or raising the standard of living generally
[3:26:27.500 --> 3:26:30.620]  It has to do with the exact opposite
[3:26:30.620 --> 3:26:32.620]  And that's borne out in this article
[3:26:33.580 --> 3:26:34.460]  And he talks about
[3:26:36.700 --> 3:26:39.020]  Automating jobs to the point where basically
[3:26:39.020 --> 3:26:41.900]  Everything's automated and then they'll give everyone else
[3:26:41.900 --> 3:26:43.900]  A basic universal income
[3:26:43.900 --> 3:26:46.380]  Which will be a minimum wage income
[3:26:46.380 --> 3:26:49.180]  And of course this will coincide with rolling lockdowns
[3:26:49.180 --> 3:26:51.500]  Where you're not even allowed outside your house
[3:26:51.500 --> 3:26:53.340]  But they'll just provide enough
[3:26:53.900 --> 3:26:55.740]  To basically have you on the bread line
[3:26:56.540 --> 3:26:58.940]  While they have robots doing jobs
[3:26:58.940 --> 3:27:00.620]  While people don't have dignity
[3:27:00.620 --> 3:27:04.060]  While people have no incentive to strive to build businesses
[3:27:04.060 --> 3:27:05.740]  Because it's all done by robots
[3:27:05.740 --> 3:27:07.740]  And it's all done by algorithms
[3:27:07.740 --> 3:27:11.740]  But then he gets into the true undercurrent of this
[3:27:11.740 --> 3:27:13.740]  Which again is transhumanism
[3:27:13.740 --> 3:27:15.740]  And he waxes lyrical
[3:27:15.740 --> 3:27:17.740]  About the fourth industrial revolution
[3:27:17.740 --> 3:27:21.740]  Which he insists is, quote, unlike anything humankind has experienced before
[3:27:21.740 --> 3:27:25.740]  Again, this isn't just dry, globalist rhetoric
[3:27:25.740 --> 3:27:27.740]  About economic restructuring
[3:27:27.740 --> 3:27:29.740]  He gushes, quote
[3:27:29.740 --> 3:27:35.740]  Consider the unlimited possibilities of having billions of people connected by mobile devices
[3:27:35.740 --> 3:27:39.740]  Giving rise to unprecedented processing power
[3:27:39.740 --> 3:27:41.740]  He talks about online education
[3:27:41.740 --> 3:27:45.740]  Involving the use of virtual and augmented reality
[3:27:45.740 --> 3:27:49.740]  To drastically improve educational outcomes
[3:27:49.740 --> 3:27:55.740]  To sensors installed in homes, clothes, accessories, cities, transport and energy networks
[3:27:55.740 --> 3:27:59.740]  This of course is the energy of things
[3:27:59.740 --> 3:28:01.740]  This is about Google
[3:28:01.740 --> 3:28:03.740]  Which we talked about, what, 10, 15 years ago
[3:28:03.740 --> 3:28:07.740]  Literally having audio sensors installed in every room in your home
[3:28:07.740 --> 3:28:11.740]  So you don't need to say, hey Siri anymore
[3:28:11.740 --> 3:28:13.740]  You just need to say, hey Google
[3:28:13.740 --> 3:28:15.740]  You can be anywhere in your house
[3:28:15.740 --> 3:28:19.740]  You can be anywhere outside because it's all connected via 5G
[3:28:19.740 --> 3:28:23.740]  And he talks about them not even needing to have that audio input
[3:28:23.740 --> 3:28:25.740]  That they will literally read your mind
[3:28:25.740 --> 3:28:29.740]  Know what you want to search for on the internet
[3:28:29.740 --> 3:28:31.740]  Because you'll have an implantable microchip
[3:28:31.740 --> 3:28:35.740]  That will literally give them access to your mind
[3:28:35.740 --> 3:28:37.740]  What could possibly go wrong
[3:28:37.740 --> 3:28:39.740]  He talks about sensors
[3:28:39.740 --> 3:28:41.740]  Wired
[3:28:41.740 --> 3:28:43.740]  Which can communicate to each other through a mobile phone network
[3:28:43.740 --> 3:28:45.740]  Which of course is 5G
[3:28:45.740 --> 3:28:49.740]  He even talks about people
[3:28:49.740 --> 3:28:53.740]  Giving permission for this obscure network
[3:28:53.740 --> 3:28:55.740]  This technocrat network to have access to read their thoughts
[3:28:55.740 --> 3:28:59.740]  So people don't even need to type out their own tweets
[3:28:59.740 --> 3:29:03.740]  Because the technocrat network will guess what they want to tweet in advance
[3:29:03.740 --> 3:29:05.740]  And tweet it for them
[3:29:05.740 --> 3:29:11.740]  So literally taking away the very right to possess your own thoughts
[3:29:11.740 --> 3:29:13.740]  Says the tools of the fourth industrial revolution
[3:29:13.740 --> 3:29:16.740]  Enable new forms of surveillance and other means of control
[3:29:16.740 --> 3:29:18.740]  That run counter to healthy open societies
[3:29:18.740 --> 3:29:21.740]  But then he goes on to advocate all of them
[3:29:21.740 --> 3:29:24.740]  And present them in a positive light
[3:29:24.740 --> 3:29:26.740]  He says public crime is likely to decrease
[3:29:26.740 --> 3:29:30.740]  Due to the convergence of sensors, cameras, facial recognition software
[3:29:30.740 --> 3:29:34.740]  And he then describes with some relish
[3:29:34.740 --> 3:29:39.740]  How these technologies can intrude into the hitherto private space of our minds
[3:29:39.740 --> 3:29:44.740]  Reading our thoughts and influencing our behavior
[3:29:44.740 --> 3:29:49.740]  So literally having microchips which interact with this network
[3:29:49.740 --> 3:29:53.740]  With this 5G network that allows them the technocratic elite
[3:29:53.740 --> 3:29:56.740]  To read your thoughts and influence your behavior
[3:29:56.740 --> 3:29:58.740]  This is in his own book
[3:29:58.740 --> 3:30:01.740]  This is not Alex Jones from 20 years ago
[3:30:01.740 --> 3:30:04.740]  This is not Minority Report from 20 years ago
[3:30:04.740 --> 3:30:11.740]  Although he does directly endorse Minority Report pre-crime policing
[3:30:11.740 --> 3:30:14.740]  He predicts in his own book
[3:30:14.740 --> 3:30:18.740]  As capabilities in this area improve the temptation for law enforcement agencies
[3:30:18.740 --> 3:30:24.740]  And courts to use techniques to determine the likelihood of criminal activity
[3:30:24.740 --> 3:30:29.740]  Assess guilt or even possibly retrieve memories directly from people's brains
[3:30:29.740 --> 3:30:31.740]  Will increase
[3:30:31.740 --> 3:30:34.740]  So he's literally talking about having these mind reading sensors
[3:30:34.740 --> 3:30:37.740]  Which are linked to your implantable microchip
[3:30:37.740 --> 3:30:39.740]  Knowing whether you're guilty or not
[3:30:39.740 --> 3:30:41.740]  Whether you've committed the crime
[3:30:41.740 --> 3:30:45.740]  And indeed whether you plan to commit the crime
[3:30:45.740 --> 3:30:49.740]  Literal Minority Report pre-crime policing
[3:30:49.740 --> 3:30:52.740]  And of course that would never be open to abuse would it
[3:30:52.740 --> 3:30:55.740]  They would never frame people for doing anything would they
[3:30:55.740 --> 3:30:58.740]  Because you can trust them
[3:30:58.740 --> 3:31:04.740]  He goes on to advocate a situation where somebody who is crossing a national border
[3:31:04.740 --> 3:31:10.740]  Might one day involve a detailed brain scan to assess an individual's security risk
[3:31:10.740 --> 3:31:13.740]  Now this is the point he talks about in his books
[3:31:13.740 --> 3:31:16.740]  The fact that they tried to get all this through after 9-11
[3:31:16.740 --> 3:31:19.740]  But there was mass public resistance against it
[3:31:19.740 --> 3:31:22.740]  Of course they took a big buyout of the apple after 9-11
[3:31:22.740 --> 3:31:26.740]  We got a lot of this police state facial recognition cameras
[3:31:26.740 --> 3:31:28.740]  Basically accepted by the general public
[3:31:28.740 --> 3:31:30.740]  But they didn't accept everything
[3:31:30.740 --> 3:31:33.740]  So now coronavirus will be that new excuse
[3:31:33.740 --> 3:31:36.740]  To get the rest of the program through
[3:31:36.740 --> 3:31:37.740]  And it's frightening
[3:31:37.740 --> 3:31:39.740]  Don't go away we'll be right back
[3:31:39.740 --> 3:31:41.740]  You know something very sad is happening
[3:31:41.740 --> 3:31:43.740]  It's sad because it was all avoidable
[3:31:43.740 --> 3:31:47.740]  Two and a half years ago an info wars got banned off of more than 60 major platforms
[3:31:47.740 --> 3:31:52.740]  I warn everybody that it was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election
[3:31:52.740 --> 3:31:56.740]  And that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship
[3:31:56.740 --> 3:32:01.740]  Until effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place
[3:32:01.740 --> 3:32:03.740]  Against conservatives, nationals, the populace
[3:32:03.740 --> 3:32:04.740]  And now that's happened
[3:32:04.740 --> 3:32:08.740]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals
[3:32:08.740 --> 3:32:12.740]  That demonstrate in protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown
[3:32:12.740 --> 3:32:15.740]  And that Trump needed to get out front and fully repudiate
[3:32:15.740 --> 3:32:18.740]  COVID-19 is basically an overblown hoax
[3:32:18.740 --> 3:32:21.740]  He started to do that in the last few months of the campaign
[3:32:21.740 --> 3:32:25.740]  But we have to understand that that's the pincer attack they're going to use
[3:32:25.740 --> 3:32:27.740]  They're going to use black lives matter and race war
[3:32:27.740 --> 3:32:29.740]  To stir up the American people and divide us
[3:32:29.740 --> 3:32:32.740]  And they're going to use economic warfare, shutting down the economy
[3:32:32.740 --> 3:32:33.740]  To try to control us
[3:32:33.740 --> 3:32:36.740]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings
[3:32:36.740 --> 3:32:38.740]  Because I'm on air, tell me what's coming next
[3:32:38.740 --> 3:32:41.740]  Remember Hillary Clinton, remember Pelosi, remember Bill Clinton
[3:32:41.740 --> 3:32:44.740]  Remember Obama, all of them said
[3:32:44.740 --> 3:32:47.740]  We are not going to concede if there's a red mirage
[3:32:47.740 --> 3:32:50.740]  We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win a landslide
[3:32:50.740 --> 3:32:51.740]  Because they had the internal polls
[3:32:51.740 --> 3:32:56.740]  And indeed, Trump won most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin
[3:32:56.740 --> 3:32:58.740]  And when he was set to win the other ones
[3:32:58.740 --> 3:33:03.740]  They froze the seven states on election night
[3:33:03.740 --> 3:33:06.740]  And then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had
[3:33:06.740 --> 3:33:07.740]  This is completely transparent
[3:33:07.740 --> 3:33:10.740]  So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not
[3:33:10.740 --> 3:33:13.740]  Trump has not conceded, none of the states have certified the vote
[3:33:13.740 --> 3:33:15.740]  And now all these investigations have been opened up
[3:33:15.740 --> 3:33:18.740]  And avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud
[3:33:18.740 --> 3:33:21.740]  Has come out and already been documented
[3:33:21.740 --> 3:33:24.740]  And in Georgia, officials are on record saying we've already found fraud
[3:33:24.740 --> 3:33:27.740]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in
[3:33:27.740 --> 3:33:29.740]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time
[3:33:29.740 --> 3:33:31.740]  Because the last hoax failed
[3:33:31.740 --> 3:33:33.740]  This is the mother of all hoaxes
[3:33:33.740 --> 3:33:35.740]  And if they get away with this, it's the end of America
[3:33:35.740 --> 3:33:37.740]  As we know it, we will be Venezuela
[3:33:37.740 --> 3:34:05.740]  InfoWars.com
[3:34:07.740 --> 3:34:20.740]  These are things that are absolutely elemental to what you and your body have to have to live
[3:34:20.740 --> 3:34:24.740]  But regardless, buying these products from us funds the InfoWars
[3:34:24.740 --> 3:34:25.740]  So it's a 360 win
[3:34:25.740 --> 3:34:26.740]  I want to thank you all for your support
[3:34:26.740 --> 3:34:28.740]  I want to ask you to redouble your average to spread the word
[3:34:28.740 --> 3:34:30.740]  I want to ask you to buy the products
[3:34:30.740 --> 3:34:31.740]  InfoWars.com today
[3:34:31.740 --> 3:34:33.740]  Because without you, it won't be on the air
[3:34:33.740 --> 3:34:34.740]  Again, I salute you and thank you all
[3:34:34.740 --> 3:34:37.740]  The toll-free numbers, triple-eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine
[3:34:37.740 --> 3:35:05.740]  Please take action today in our emergency cell
[3:35:08.740 --> 3:35:12.740]  And what I see happening across the spectrum
[3:35:12.740 --> 3:35:15.740]  Of different political views is people finally get that
[3:35:15.740 --> 3:35:18.740]  They finally understand that they're not being naive anymore
[3:35:18.740 --> 3:35:23.740]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people
[3:35:23.740 --> 3:35:26.740]  Until they've proven what they stand for and who they are
[3:35:26.740 --> 3:35:28.740]  Or you're gonna get hurt
[3:35:28.740 --> 3:35:30.740]  But those of you out there that have done your own research
[3:35:30.740 --> 3:35:32.740]  And discovered who's good and who is faithful
[3:35:32.740 --> 3:35:34.740]  Will then come together with those organizations
[3:35:34.740 --> 3:35:36.740]  And support them like InfoWars
[3:35:36.740 --> 3:35:39.740]  Without your support, InfoWars would not exist
[3:35:42.740 --> 3:35:45.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:35:55.740 --> 3:36:00.740]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters
[3:36:00.740 --> 3:36:06.740]  In the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson
[3:36:06.740 --> 3:36:10.740]  So today, of course, we have Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg up again
[3:36:10.740 --> 3:36:14.740]  In front of a panel basically soft-soaping what they've been doing
[3:36:14.740 --> 3:36:16.740]  Over the past four years
[3:36:16.740 --> 3:36:20.740]  Gaming their own algorithms, manipulating their own social media platforms
[3:36:20.740 --> 3:36:24.740]  To censor silence conservatives, to swing elections
[3:36:24.740 --> 3:36:27.740]  We have this headline out of zero hedge
[3:36:27.740 --> 3:36:31.740]  Dorsey hints Trump will lose his special treatment on Twitter
[3:36:31.740 --> 3:36:34.740]  And this is a prediction that I've made before
[3:36:34.740 --> 3:36:38.740]  If the recounts, if the lawsuits fail
[3:36:38.740 --> 3:36:42.740]  As soon as Donald Trump is out of office on Joe Biden's inauguration day
[3:36:42.740 --> 3:36:46.740]  They will ban President Donald Trump on Twitter
[3:36:46.740 --> 3:36:49.740]  And he spoke to that effect today
[3:36:49.740 --> 3:36:52.740]  Says Dorsey has just delivered perhaps the greatest hint yet
[3:36:52.740 --> 3:36:55.740]  The President Trump's days on Twitter might be numbered
[3:36:55.740 --> 3:36:58.740]  Passed by Hawaii Senator Maisie Hirono
[3:36:58.740 --> 3:37:01.740]  What the companies are doing to stop President Trump's lies
[3:37:01.740 --> 3:37:04.740]  Dorsey replied that special treatment enjoyed by Trump as an election official
[3:37:04.740 --> 3:37:07.740]  Goes away once an individual leaves office
[3:37:07.740 --> 3:37:10.740]  In other words, if Trump tweets any claims about the election being stolen
[3:37:10.740 --> 3:37:13.740]  After leaving office, he could see his account suspended
[3:37:13.740 --> 3:37:17.740]  By the way, he tweeted a Twitter account
[3:37:17.740 --> 3:37:22.740]  Trump retweeted or quote-tweeted a Twitter account called Stonewall Jackson
[3:37:22.740 --> 3:37:25.740]  Which had over 300,000 followers
[3:37:25.740 --> 3:37:28.740]  That account was suspended within hours
[3:37:28.740 --> 3:37:32.740]  And now basically that happens to 50% of Twitter accounts
[3:37:32.740 --> 3:37:35.740]  That Trump retweets, they're suspended within hours
[3:37:35.740 --> 3:37:38.740]  We also had Ted Cruz, and in fact we've got a couple of clips
[3:37:38.740 --> 3:37:40.740]  We're going to play on this now
[3:37:40.740 --> 3:37:43.740]  Ted Cruz once again confronted Jack Dorsey again
[3:37:43.740 --> 3:37:45.740]  Is all of this once again futile?
[3:37:45.740 --> 3:37:48.740]  Are they actually going to amend section 230?
[3:37:48.740 --> 3:37:50.740]  Or is this just talk?
[3:37:50.740 --> 3:37:53.740]  So far, so it remains to be seen if anything will happen after this
[3:37:53.740 --> 3:37:56.740]  But Cruz and Dorsey faced off once again
[3:37:56.740 --> 3:37:59.740]  As the senator prodded Dorsey to take responsibility
[3:37:59.740 --> 3:38:02.740]  For censoring conservative voices
[3:38:02.740 --> 3:38:07.740]  Here is the clip of Ted Cruz confronting Jack Dorsey
[3:38:07.740 --> 3:38:10.740]  Once again in front of this committee
[3:38:10.740 --> 3:38:12.740]  Here it is
[3:38:12.740 --> 3:38:14.740]  Let me shift to a different topic
[3:38:14.740 --> 3:38:18.740]  Mr. Dorsey, does voter fraud exist?
[3:38:18.740 --> 3:38:21.740]  I don't know for certain
[3:38:21.740 --> 3:38:23.740]  Are you an expert in voter fraud?
[3:38:23.740 --> 3:38:25.740]  No, I'm not
[3:38:25.740 --> 3:38:29.740]  Well, why then is Twitter right now putting
[3:38:29.740 --> 3:38:34.740]  Proported warnings on virtually any statement about voter fraud?
[3:38:34.740 --> 3:38:38.740]  We're simply linking to a broader conversation
[3:38:38.740 --> 3:38:40.740]  So that people have more information
[3:38:40.740 --> 3:38:42.740]  No, you're not, you put up a page that says
[3:38:42.740 --> 3:38:46.740]  Quote, voter fraud of any kind is exceedingly rare in the United States
[3:38:46.740 --> 3:38:48.740]  That's not linking to a broader conversation
[3:38:48.740 --> 3:38:51.740]  That's taking a disputed policy position
[3:38:51.740 --> 3:38:53.740]  And you're a publisher when you're doing that
[3:38:53.740 --> 3:38:55.740]  You're entitled to take a policy position
[3:38:55.740 --> 3:38:57.740]  But you don't get to pretend you're not a publisher
[3:38:57.740 --> 3:39:01.740]  And get a special benefit under section 230 as a result
[3:39:01.740 --> 3:39:05.740]  That link is pointing to a broader conversation with tweets
[3:39:05.740 --> 3:39:09.740]  From publishers and people all around the country
[3:39:09.740 --> 3:39:12.740]  Mr. Dorsey, would the following statement violate Twitter's policies?
[3:39:12.740 --> 3:39:15.740]  Quote, absentee ballots remain the largest source
[3:39:15.740 --> 3:39:18.740]  Of potential voter fraud
[3:39:18.740 --> 3:39:21.740]  I imagine that we would label it
[3:39:21.740 --> 3:39:23.740]  So that people can have more context
[3:39:23.740 --> 3:39:31.740]  How about this quote? Quote, third-party organizations, candidates, and political activists
[3:39:31.740 --> 3:39:37.740]  Voter fraud is particularly possible where, quote, third-party organizations, candidates, and political party activists
[3:39:37.740 --> 3:39:39.740]  Are involved in, quote, handling absentee ballots
[3:39:39.740 --> 3:39:43.740]  Would you flag that as potentially misleading?
[3:39:43.740 --> 3:39:48.740]  I don't know the specifics of how we might enforce that
[3:39:48.740 --> 3:39:52.740]  But I imagine a lot of these would have a label
[3:39:52.740 --> 3:39:54.740]  Pointing people to a bigger conversation
[3:39:54.740 --> 3:39:56.740]  Well, you're right, you would label them
[3:39:56.740 --> 3:40:00.740]  Because you've taken the political position right now that voter fraud doesn't exist
[3:40:00.740 --> 3:40:05.740]  I would note both of those quotes come from the Carter Baker Commission on Federal Election Reform
[3:40:05.740 --> 3:40:10.740]  That is Democratic President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker
[3:40:10.740 --> 3:40:14.740]  In Twitter's position he is essentially, voter fraud does not exist
[3:40:14.740 --> 3:40:18.740]  Are you aware that just two weeks ago in the state of Texas
[3:40:18.740 --> 3:40:24.740]  A woman was charged with 134 counts of election fraud, are you aware of that?
[3:40:24.740 --> 3:40:25.740]  I'm not aware of that
[3:40:25.740 --> 3:40:28.740]  If I tweeted that statement with a link to the indictment
[3:40:28.740 --> 3:40:35.740]  Would you put a warning on it that says, well, the Democratic Party position right now as voter fraud doesn't exist?
[3:40:35.740 --> 3:40:40.740]  I don't think it's useful to get in the hypotheticals, but I don't believe so
[3:40:40.740 --> 3:40:43.740]  You don't believe so? Well, we're going to test that because I'm going to tweet that
[3:40:43.740 --> 3:40:46.740]  And we'll see what you put on it
[3:40:46.740 --> 3:40:49.740]  So now Cruz has tweeted that, he's tweeted a couple of other things
[3:40:49.740 --> 3:40:52.740]  So it remains to be seen if they don't put the warnings on
[3:40:52.740 --> 3:40:55.740]  They probably won't simply because they had this confrontation
[3:40:55.740 --> 3:40:57.740]  But we also had Mark Zuckerberg up there
[3:40:57.740 --> 3:41:01.740]  Now again, bear in mind that Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook was
[3:41:01.740 --> 3:41:06.740]  Basically blamed for Trump's election back in 2016 and for the past four years
[3:41:06.740 --> 3:41:08.740]  They've been threatening Zuckerberg
[3:41:08.740 --> 3:41:13.740]  They've been saying that Facebook is the biggest threat to democracy that we've seen in a generation
[3:41:13.740 --> 3:41:18.740]  As a threat to Zuckerberg to make him relegate banned censor conservative content
[3:41:18.740 --> 3:41:20.740]  Which is exactly what he did
[3:41:20.740 --> 3:41:25.740]  So now lo and behold, since Biden claimed victory a couple of weeks ago
[3:41:25.740 --> 3:41:28.740]  Facebook is no longer a threat to democracy
[3:41:28.740 --> 3:41:33.740]  And guess what? The Biden transition team is hiring Facebook officials
[3:41:33.740 --> 3:41:36.740]  What a quick turnaround, Politico
[3:41:36.740 --> 3:41:40.740]  Former Facebook leaders are now transition insiders
[3:41:40.740 --> 3:41:43.740]  Some on the Biden campaign thought they had two opponents to beat
[3:41:43.740 --> 3:41:45.740]  First Donald Trump and then Facebook
[3:41:45.740 --> 3:41:48.740]  But people with close ties to Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg
[3:41:48.740 --> 3:41:52.740]  Have already become inside players in the Biden transition
[3:41:52.740 --> 3:41:58.740]  So of course they handed the election to him through their gaming and censoring of their algorithms
[3:41:58.740 --> 3:42:03.740]  Because we've had studies that show that can shift millions and millions of votes on election day
[3:42:03.740 --> 3:42:05.740]  Mark Zuckerberg came through
[3:42:05.740 --> 3:42:08.740]  Mark Zuckerberg announced that the election was over that Trump had lost
[3:42:08.740 --> 3:42:13.740]  Despite previously saying that nobody could prematurely announce the result of the election
[3:42:13.740 --> 3:42:19.740]  And now as a reward, a bunch of Facebook insiders are getting juicy, prominent positions
[3:42:19.740 --> 3:42:24.740]  On Biden's transition team and Facebook is no longer a threat to democracy
[3:42:24.740 --> 3:42:26.740]  Well, what do you know?
[3:42:26.740 --> 3:42:30.740]  Michael Tracy tweets in 2008 and 2012
[3:42:30.740 --> 3:42:36.740]  The Obama campaign's prowess at utilizing internet resources to achieve victory was widely celebrated
[3:42:36.740 --> 3:42:39.740]  Trump utilized similar resources in 2016
[3:42:39.740 --> 3:42:42.740]  And suddenly the internet became a dystopian hellscape
[3:42:42.740 --> 3:42:45.740]  Requiring crackdowns and censorship
[3:42:45.740 --> 3:42:50.740]  But now everything seems to be tickety-boo, given that Facebook helped deliver
[3:42:50.740 --> 3:42:54.740]  Totally legitimately the election to Biden
[3:42:54.740 --> 3:42:58.740]  Somebody else tweeted, whenever somebody says our democracy
[3:42:58.740 --> 3:43:03.740]  They really mean our uncontested stranglehold on power and information
[3:43:03.740 --> 3:43:07.740]  And yet the calls for censorship have not ended
[3:43:07.740 --> 3:43:10.740]  Despite them declaring Biden to be the victor
[3:43:10.740 --> 3:43:17.740]  Headline out of Breitbart, Mark Zuckerberg Facebook censored Stop the Steel to stop violence or civil unrest
[3:43:17.740 --> 3:43:24.740]  Now for the past six months they did absolutely nothing to stop actual violence and civil unrest
[3:43:24.740 --> 3:43:28.740]  As Antifa and BLM burned down American cities across the nation
[3:43:28.740 --> 3:43:30.740]  They did nothing to stop that
[3:43:30.740 --> 3:43:34.740]  But the hashtag Stop the Steel, they clamped down on that hard
[3:43:34.740 --> 3:43:39.740]  And sudden, during a hearing today before the Committee on the Judiciary
[3:43:39.740 --> 3:43:44.740]  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the Stop the Steel group was censored
[3:43:44.740 --> 3:43:47.740]  In order to prevent violence or civil unrest
[3:43:47.740 --> 3:43:50.740]  The reason, which they name in this article
[3:43:50.740 --> 3:43:55.740]  Was that a few people turned up to some vote counting protests with arms
[3:43:55.740 --> 3:43:58.740]  Completely legally open carry in many states
[3:43:58.740 --> 3:44:02.740]  And that's why they banned a Facebook group called Stop the Steel
[3:44:02.740 --> 3:44:06.740]  That grew to 300,000 users in less than a day
[3:44:06.740 --> 3:44:09.740]  Making it one of the fastest growing groups on Facebook
[3:44:09.740 --> 3:44:11.740]  It was shut down almost immediately
[3:44:11.740 --> 3:44:15.740]  Because we can't have people talking about vote fraud
[3:44:15.740 --> 3:44:18.740]  Because of course that's going to cause violence and civil unrest
[3:44:18.740 --> 3:44:23.740]  Forget about the actual violence and civil unrest that's plagued America for the past six months
[3:44:23.740 --> 3:44:27.740]  Insighted by the likes of Twitter and Facebook
[3:44:27.740 --> 3:44:29.740]  They did nothing about it
[3:44:29.740 --> 3:44:31.740]  Gateway Pundit reports
[3:44:31.740 --> 3:44:35.740]  Senator Blumenthal urged Zuckerberg to remove Breitbart
[3:44:35.740 --> 3:44:40.740]  Gateway Pundit, Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and Steve Bannon from Facebook
[3:44:40.740 --> 3:44:43.740]  So as they did with Alex Jones and InfoWars back in 2018
[3:44:43.740 --> 3:44:45.740]  You've now literally got senators
[3:44:45.740 --> 3:44:47.740]  Oh, but it's just a private company
[3:44:47.740 --> 3:44:52.740]  You've literally got people in government politicians demanding Zuckerberg
[3:44:52.740 --> 3:44:57.740]  Delete, ban, censor, websites and individuals on Facebook
[3:44:57.740 --> 3:44:59.740]  Meanwhile
[3:44:59.740 --> 3:45:03.740]  Study ones that knew work from home trend is making people more racist
[3:45:03.740 --> 3:45:07.740]  Of course now we have huge numbers of people forcibly working from home
[3:45:07.740 --> 3:45:09.740]  Because they're not allowed to go into the office
[3:45:09.740 --> 3:45:12.740]  In fact that's 44% of the workforce in the United Kingdom
[3:45:12.740 --> 3:45:15.740]  Well now those people are racist
[3:45:15.740 --> 3:45:20.740]  A new study being promoted by the mass media claims that working from home makes people more racist
[3:45:20.740 --> 3:45:24.740]  Because they're less exposed to diversity in the workplace
[3:45:24.740 --> 3:45:28.740]  The study found that 76% of those who shared offices in the UK
[3:45:28.740 --> 3:45:31.740]  Are exposed to ethnic diversity
[3:45:31.740 --> 3:45:34.740]  Meaning those who work from home are isolated from such a setting
[3:45:34.740 --> 3:45:38.740]  And as a result are more likely to be prejudiced
[3:45:38.740 --> 3:45:40.740]  But in this study
[3:45:40.740 --> 3:45:42.740]  They actually admitted
[3:45:42.740 --> 3:45:45.740]  That people who live in more diverse communities
[3:45:45.740 --> 3:45:49.740]  Were more likely to be negative towards ethnic diversity
[3:45:49.740 --> 3:45:51.740]  Almost as if
[3:45:51.740 --> 3:45:53.740]  Almost as if
[3:45:53.740 --> 3:45:55.740]  What we've been told is not true
[3:45:55.740 --> 3:45:58.740]  That diversity is in fact not a strength
[3:45:58.740 --> 3:46:00.740]  Could you believe it?
[3:46:00.740 --> 3:46:05.740]  That in fact correlates with a 2019 peer reviewed study by Danish academics
[3:46:05.740 --> 3:46:09.740]  Which found that ethnic diversity has a negative impact on communities
[3:46:09.740 --> 3:46:11.740]  Because it erodes trust
[3:46:11.740 --> 3:46:14.740]  They asked whether continued immigration and ethnic diversity
[3:46:14.740 --> 3:46:17.740]  Was having a positive impact on community cohesion
[3:46:17.740 --> 3:46:20.740]  The study found the opposite to be the case
[3:46:20.740 --> 3:46:30.740]  Diversity in fact is not a strength
