[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening
[00:12.400 --> 00:41.800]  to Alex Jones it's already the 12th day of January 2014 I am your host Alex Jones
[00:41.800 --> 00:47.200]  we're going to be live here for the next three hours two hours as we are
[00:47.200 --> 00:53.040]  weekdays three hours every Sunday four to six p.m. central and then of course
[00:53.040 --> 00:56.720]  back with a weekday transmission from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central that is the
[00:56.720 --> 01:01.400]  three-hour broadcast there's obviously a lot of news and information to go over
[01:01.400 --> 01:08.240]  today we're going to get into Obama turning the presidency into a
[01:08.240 --> 01:14.080]  dictatorship and that's in the Washington Times today year of action
[01:14.080 --> 01:19.280]  Obama vows to act on his own those are both quotes year of action and act on
[01:19.280 --> 01:26.240]  his own when necessary for your own good of course to circumvent the states the
[01:26.240 --> 01:32.840]  law Congress the Bill of Rights Constitution just means nothing and
[01:32.840 --> 01:38.560]  then meanwhile Obama approval rating continues to drop at record low and they
[01:38.560 --> 01:44.520]  don't care because now they've got their system in place the dismantling of this
[01:44.520 --> 01:48.600]  country accelerates and that ties into what I covered so much on Friday Ted
[01:48.600 --> 01:53.080]  Cruz calls president dangerous and terrifying that's the answer here is to
[01:53.080 --> 01:56.960]  call these guys out for what they are that's a stack we're going to get into
[01:56.960 --> 02:03.400]  another stack that's really well known by this audience and well known by
[02:03.400 --> 02:06.720]  anybody who studies what's happening with screen time and adults and children
[02:06.720 --> 02:12.600]  alike but there's a new study out just confirming what we already knew children
[02:12.600 --> 02:20.480]  who watch too much TV may have damaged brain structures damaged brain
[02:20.480 --> 02:26.480]  structures and then it goes through the studies showing that it depletes certain
[02:26.480 --> 02:32.120]  areas of the brain's development and then in the area of imagination in other
[02:32.120 --> 02:38.000]  areas it basically calcifies it or turns it into a big unimaginative blob
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.960]  zombification is what I call it and we're going to be breaking that down in
[02:41.960 --> 02:45.720]  fact as you print me just type in Alzheimer's television and you'll get
[02:45.720 --> 02:49.160]  like BBC articles and others about it giving people Alzheimer's as well because
[02:49.160 --> 02:51.640]  I don't want to just talk about the young when we do this I want to show people a
[02:51.640 --> 02:56.960]  few other exhibits just to break down the fact this is consciously known also the
[02:56.960 --> 03:01.440]  US military is looking at building real transformers I'm not making that up
[03:01.440 --> 03:06.840]  helicopters that then land and drive around like cars and are pilotless
[03:06.840 --> 03:15.880]  automated autonomous so that's coming up also this year's flu getting the young
[03:15.880 --> 03:20.960]  and the healthy that's in the ABC News health site and the breakdown my take
[03:20.960 --> 03:26.960]  on what's happening with the flu this year that is killing a lot of people and
[03:26.960 --> 03:30.920]  what that ties into with all the superbugs from the medical doctors I've
[03:30.920 --> 03:34.480]  talked to that after you get the flu the superbugs come in and then colonize the
[03:34.480 --> 03:40.320]  areas that the viruses have damaged and then coming up we're going to be looking
[03:40.320 --> 03:46.400]  at the really big news the latest on Obamacare and the scams that are being
[03:46.400 --> 03:54.400]  run on that front also big banks say no to marijuana money legal or not they
[03:54.400 --> 04:00.120]  will not take medical dispensary money any of it that's being used by cancer
[04:00.120 --> 04:07.360]  patients and again this is all just 20 20 support of the drug war because the
[04:07.360 --> 04:10.920]  big banks are the biggest recipients of the 500 billion in North America alone
[04:10.920 --> 04:17.440]  every year in laundered cocaine heroin and other narcotics money and they
[04:17.440 --> 04:20.680]  lobby to keep drugs illegal look if I was the biggest drug dealer out there I
[04:20.680 --> 04:25.160]  was totally immoral and an evil would I lobby to decriminalize and take the
[04:25.160 --> 04:31.800]  profit out and open it up to competition no I would lobby to keep it
[04:31.800 --> 04:37.800]  illegal because I'm the big mega banks fellow reserve far and owned and if I
[04:37.800 --> 04:41.520]  was the establishment I would want to keep it illegal at a black market so
[04:41.520 --> 04:45.240]  they can control it and jack up prices we're gonna go to break in about 15
[04:45.240 --> 04:50.520]  seconds and then when we come back we are going to get into all of the other
[04:50.520 --> 04:56.880]  news as well on Chris Christie DHS and more I am your host Alex Jones info

[06:20.280 --> 06:25.560]  unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial
[06:25.560 --> 06:35.160]  complex
[06:35.160 --> 06:39.600]  it's a military mission in north st. Louis heavily armored vehicles are

[06:56.720 --> 07:01.120]  brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way enough
[07:01.120 --> 07:05.640]  enough enough enough enough the department of homeland security is
[07:05.640 --> 07:11.280]  apparently on a huge ammo buying spree it comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds
[07:11.280 --> 07:16.000]  of ammunition and it's case late news 12 Jeff ferrell discover that clergy would
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.560]  help the government with potentially their biggest problem us so part of it
[07:20.560 --> 07:23.920]  is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their
[07:23.920 --> 07:27.360]  parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole
[07:27.360 --> 07:32.800]  communities if you got a business that you didn't build that somebody else made
[07:32.800 --> 07:38.200]  that happen mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two
[07:38.200 --> 07:42.440]  new studies in the journal pediatrics blackhawk choppers soaring to the night
[07:42.440 --> 07:48.000]  sky but this is only a drill heavily armed officers in water town search for
[07:48.000 --> 08:01.280]  suspect house it's a joint military training exercise involving local police
[08:01.280 --> 08:09.280]  also military I am inside I have two words for you
[08:09.280 --> 08:20.480]  the dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras parents grabbing their
[08:20.480 --> 08:24.280]  children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and
[08:24.280 --> 08:28.600]  then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officers rifle
[08:28.600 --> 08:31.240]  they let them in the area they told them they could come in and now they're
[08:31.240 --> 08:36.000]  coming in like their trespassers punching and shoving people
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.000]  and we're not running and we're not backing down if you want to come and take
[08:41.000 --> 08:51.600]  home the Empire is on the run live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex
[08:51.600 --> 09:07.400]  Jones
[09:07.400 --> 09:13.560]  the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
[09:13.560 --> 09:22.320]  ladies and gentlemen we are live thank you so much for joining us as we
[09:22.320 --> 09:28.920]  broadcast worldwide on this Sunday already the 12th day of January 2014
[09:28.920 --> 09:34.920]  we'll be here live for the next two hours tonight we're gonna look at the
[09:34.920 --> 09:45.000]  dictator Obama and how dictatorships of the executive branch come into place
[09:45.000 --> 09:51.880]  historically and the modern dictatorship 2.0 that we're witnessing also we're
[09:51.880 --> 09:55.640]  gonna look at children who watch television may have damaged brain
[09:55.640 --> 09:58.880]  structures no kidding look at the general public television has been the
[09:58.880 --> 10:05.040]  bane of the last 60 years of our culture and here I am talking on modern
[10:05.040 --> 10:11.000]  television simulcasting the radio show at info wars.com forward slash show or
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.680]  prisonplanet.tv you can see the video feeds but the study already basically
[10:17.680 --> 10:22.320]  restates what I've told you thousands of times talk radio or interactive internet
[10:22.320 --> 10:26.280]  television where you're in control and you're making choices and you're
[10:26.280 --> 10:31.640]  clicking and following links and checking out news articles actually boost
[10:31.640 --> 10:38.040]  brain connections actually boost cognitive ability like reading a book
[10:38.040 --> 10:40.760]  does because you have to image everything that you're reading the
[10:40.760 --> 10:45.920]  descriptions it connects different parts of your brain watching inactive
[10:45.920 --> 10:52.920]  passive broadcast mainline entertainment television is brain damaging
[10:52.920 --> 10:58.120]  people you can just type in Alzheimer's television viewing and see all the major
[10:58.120 --> 11:09.640]  studies on that front so that is going to be coming up here today now we are
[11:09.640 --> 11:14.760]  also going to be breaking down what's happening with the economy and we're
[11:14.760 --> 11:20.640]  going to be looking at the latest Obamacare news the latest marijuana
[11:20.640 --> 11:25.280]  legalization news also the London Telegraph reports meet Al Qaeda's new
[11:25.280 --> 11:30.160]  poster boy for the Middle East Al Qaeda has taken large parts of Western Iraq
[11:30.160 --> 11:38.960]  and Central Iraq like Fallujah and is being backed next door in Syria and
[11:38.960 --> 11:45.960]  other areas by NATO and our criminal government while taking over areas of
[11:45.960 --> 11:50.680]  Iraq and while being used as the threat to take the liberties of the average
[11:50.680 --> 11:56.320]  American away in the name of battling terrorism and you can see how that is
[11:56.320 --> 12:02.160]  unfolding as well plus I've told you for many years that all cars really made
[12:02.160 --> 12:06.040]  the last 15 years but it's very high-tech now in the last four years have
[12:06.040 --> 12:09.360]  boxes in them that you pay for at the time of purchase you pay for all this
[12:09.360 --> 12:13.840]  Trojan horse treason that they're tracking everywhere you go everything
[12:13.840 --> 12:16.760]  you do you're giving it to police insurance companies you name it it's
[12:16.760 --> 12:19.720]  all being database all the big corporations are involved they get
[12:19.720 --> 12:24.520]  paid money to do it it's it's a mass criminal movement by government and
[12:24.520 --> 12:31.000]  elite corporations to overthrow due process and privacy and convert us to
[12:31.000 --> 12:38.240]  their own term technocracy and that's why the head spokesman for Ford head of
[12:38.240 --> 12:43.160]  marketing Jim Farley came out last week and said kind of like the head of
[12:43.160 --> 12:47.320]  Facebook said our users are dumb efforts they trust us and you see these
[12:47.320 --> 12:50.720]  other similar statements where all these big executives are always calling their
[12:50.720 --> 12:57.080]  users and supporters and customers more on scum this guy who looks like he's
[12:57.080 --> 13:00.880]  auditioning in his photographs for the next American psycho movie has that same
[13:00.880 --> 13:06.560]  craze look in his eyes now apologizes and says they don't track you and don't
[13:06.560 --> 13:14.040]  sell your data which is a total and complete lie you can go research what
[13:14.040 --> 13:18.000]  these boxes do it's been on record for years so he brags and throws it in the
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.600]  broken American people's faces they believe we're broke back put up with
[13:21.600 --> 13:25.960]  anything we're done in their minds and we kind of get upset oh well oh there's
[13:25.960 --> 13:29.880]  nothing there never mind I said that was there there's no NSA the government
[13:29.880 --> 13:33.560]  doesn't ship in drugs the big banks don't want to the money everything's fine
[13:33.560 --> 13:36.520]  there's no corruption there's no revolving door between industry and
[13:36.520 --> 13:40.160]  government there's no insider deals there's nothing going on everything's
[13:40.160 --> 13:46.120]  fine everything's wonderful everything's good we're gonna look at Chris
[13:46.120 --> 13:50.400]  Christie and the latest look look I followed this one at first broke middle
[13:50.400 --> 13:55.680]  the week and it was very very simple his top aids his cabinet members gave the
[13:55.680 --> 13:59.600]  orders it turned out they knew he said a few days before this broke big with the
[13:59.600 --> 14:04.200]  emails and the leaked info that none of his cabinet or top people knew and that
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.000]  he didn't know they turned out he didn't know so he's been caught lying and
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.520]  that's what they're saying bridge scandal papers point to cover up by Chris
[14:12.520 --> 14:18.120]  Christie and his allies Christie cabinet member told of bridge lane closures is
[14:18.120 --> 14:24.960]  already known Chris Christie could be impeached is the next headline it goes
[14:24.960 --> 14:32.040]  on and on and my issue is I don't like Chris Christie open border promoting
[14:32.040 --> 14:39.880]  globalist he only shut down a few government projects so that he could
[14:39.880 --> 14:44.280]  actually give more bank or bailout money to globalist I mean he's the perfect
[14:44.280 --> 14:50.360]  fascist crony capitalist anti-free market neocon and he's obviously a big
[14:50.360 --> 14:55.080]  bloated gangster like job of the hut meets Baron Harkin and type individual
[14:55.080 --> 15:02.520]  and so I don't like him but compared to Obama targeting the key party veterans
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.840]  groups gun owner groups gun manufacturers you name it with the IRS the
[15:07.840 --> 15:12.200]  NSA pro-life groups being targeted I mean that's real oppression and I think
[15:12.200 --> 15:15.760]  Christie should get in trouble and I don't like Chris Christie he's a globalist
[15:15.760 --> 15:20.520]  he's a rhino Republican name only he's the opposite of a constitutionalist but
[15:20.520 --> 15:25.560]  this this is just an example of how something simple like shutting down a
[15:25.560 --> 15:29.200]  bridge to get back at your political enemies across the water is something
[15:29.200 --> 15:35.400]  that can capture the public's mind and this could be used to basically you know
[15:35.400 --> 15:39.400]  burn down his political career and I believe it will hurt him but what about
[15:39.400 --> 15:44.020]  what about fast and furious Benghazi what about all these giant issues
[15:44.020 --> 15:48.360]  cilantro salindra all the energy scams all the shutting down our power plants
[15:48.360 --> 15:53.760]  Obama acting as a dictator all of it that's the big issue why is he still
[15:53.760 --> 15:58.360]  Teflon I'll break that down and give you the latest Obama dictatorship news on
[15:58.360 --> 16:03.560]  the other side Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the
[16:03.560 --> 16:08.160]  prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse

[19:58.520 --> 20:01.360]  wars life.com
[20:01.360 --> 20:06.800]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[20:06.800 --> 20:09.160]  Broadcasting Network
[20:09.160 --> 20:20.040]  we are on the march the empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[20:20.040 --> 20:36.680]  network
[20:36.680 --> 20:42.720]  if you go back to the first executive orders by George Washington when he was
[20:42.720 --> 20:49.640]  president they had offered him to be king but he said no way and served out his
[20:49.640 --> 20:57.880]  two terms and went back to his farm went back to his ranch but if you go and look
[20:57.880 --> 21:00.840]  at the first executive orders you can look at him at the Library of Congress
[21:00.840 --> 21:06.160]  actual scans of the handwritten letters by George Washington it was taking the
[21:06.160 --> 21:11.200]  amount of money that Congress had appropriated for the executive to put in
[21:11.200 --> 21:19.720]  drapes and to pay for pottery and cutlery at the White House for Martha Washington
[21:19.720 --> 21:32.200]  that's it that's all now since then since around the 60s really presidents began
[21:32.200 --> 21:36.760]  to use executive orders to do more and more outside of Congress but it wasn't
[21:36.760 --> 21:41.080]  one one hundredth of what Obama is doing right now I have interviewed
[21:41.080 --> 21:46.560]  constitutional lawyers on the left on the right constitutionalist libertarians
[21:46.560 --> 21:50.480]  you name it all of them agree they had congressional hearings a month ago we
[21:50.480 --> 21:56.760]  covered them here played clips that this is the precedent-setting event for the
[21:56.760 --> 22:04.000]  presidency to be a dictatorial office I know that sounds like an oxymoron how
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.840]  are you elected dictator well Hitler was elected but the office of the
[22:09.840 --> 22:13.080]  presidency is not supposed to be dictatorial there's a separation of
[22:13.080 --> 22:17.200]  powers and quite frankly the presidency is to be the weakest of the three powers
[22:17.200 --> 22:21.080]  they introduced the last hundred years co-equal saying all three branches
[22:21.080 --> 22:25.600]  executive legislative judicial were co-equal that's a fraud if you read the
[22:25.600 --> 22:29.560]  Federalist Papers the anti-Federalist paper showed at the time Congress has
[22:29.560 --> 22:34.400]  the most power because it's the most diverse 500 plus members today it
[22:34.400 --> 22:38.680]  represents the states they're fearful of a dictator they have the main power they
[22:38.680 --> 22:43.360]  make the laws and control the money then courts are to judge the laws of their
[22:43.360 --> 22:48.560]  constitutional off-the-bill of rights constitution declaration of independence
[22:48.560 --> 22:53.720]  and common law precedent and the executive is like the quarterback who
[22:53.720 --> 23:00.920]  gets told what plays to use international relations war borders state
[23:00.920 --> 23:07.960]  disputes stuff like that this would be like the quarterback let's say of the
[23:07.960 --> 23:14.440]  49ers telling the coaches up in the box and the coaches on the sidelines what
[23:14.440 --> 23:20.720]  plays to call I mean it's that big of a no-brainer I mean why even have
[23:20.720 --> 23:24.800]  coaches why even have a coaching staff why even have an athletics program
[23:24.800 --> 23:28.000]  other than the quarterback why he can just run everything he can decide who
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.960]  to recruit he can decide I mean I'm gonna use a football analogy here he can
[23:32.960 --> 23:37.320]  decide what type of shoes to buy he he can run it all no the Congress does that
[23:37.320 --> 23:43.920]  and then there's referees off the rules of the game that are the courts and then
[23:43.920 --> 23:47.240]  you've got the quarterback that's the president and I'm telling you folks we
[23:47.240 --> 23:50.880]  don't have a Napoleon Bonaparte the quarterback running things we don't have
[23:50.880 --> 23:54.880]  an Adolf Alois Hitler as our quarterback running things you're not
[23:54.880 --> 24:01.400]  supposed to have one guy doing all this and that's what's going on that's what's
[24:01.400 --> 24:05.120]  happening and and I'm not saying Obama's gonna stay in office let's get that
[24:05.120 --> 24:08.800]  straight they've had countless national news stories saying Alex Jones says
[24:08.800 --> 24:12.800]  Obama is gonna be a dictator now I'm not saying he's going to be a dictator I'm
[24:12.800 --> 24:19.320]  saying he's a 2.0 modern corporate dictator through fraud and all this
[24:19.320 --> 24:23.640]  other absconding with the law just getting away with anything but let me
[24:23.640 --> 24:26.240]  tell you what the constitutional law scholars like Jonathan Turley and others
[24:26.240 --> 24:29.200]  said before Congress a month ago we played the clips they said the
[24:29.200 --> 24:34.000]  president's being set for a total overthrow you put in a homeland security
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.840]  above the law militarized fifth branch the military the Pentagon calls them
[24:37.840 --> 24:43.720]  Northcom surveillance grids secret police spy grids for al-Qaeda and then
[24:43.720 --> 24:46.840]  meanwhile oh it's for the Tea Party now we told you that all along it's for the
[24:46.840 --> 24:52.000]  real Americans it's for the resistance they're like the V.C. French who
[24:52.000 --> 25:01.200]  occupied they're like the V.C. French who who occupied France during World War
[25:01.200 --> 25:05.720]  II and ran the government for the Nazis that's what our government is is a
[25:05.720 --> 25:11.200]  client government a trader government for the occupying foreign globalist you
[25:11.200 --> 25:14.480]  know the French didn't even fight the French stood down under orders by their
[25:14.480 --> 25:19.360]  general staff only the British expeditionary force about 120th the size
[25:19.360 --> 25:23.400]  of the German force fought and then got driven to Dunkirk the reason I raised
[25:23.400 --> 25:27.080]  that as people say the French lost to the Nazis they didn't lose they had an
[25:27.080 --> 25:33.840]  internal government coup to invite the Nazis in and three days after the week
[25:33.840 --> 25:37.320]  and a half long battle for France with the British Hitler was able to tour
[25:37.320 --> 25:42.800]  Paris and the police stood out there and blocked the crowds many of which were
[25:42.800 --> 25:47.920]  hiling Hitler and loving him Hitler was popular in France with over 50%
[25:47.920 --> 25:54.320]  approval ratings when he invaded France and went over the marginal line and all
[25:54.320 --> 25:58.480]  that and the reason I raised this the reason I bring up stuff from the early
[25:58.480 --> 26:04.320]  1940s is you've got to understand we have a corporate trader government that
[26:04.320 --> 26:10.480]  get jobs in revolving doors to fortune 500 who in most cases are bigger GDPs
[26:10.480 --> 26:16.120]  than than than foreign countries half the biggest GDPs of the top 100 gross
[26:16.120 --> 26:20.640]  domestic products in the world are corporate they're not government
[26:20.640 --> 26:27.400]  government is just the legitimizing factor for the corporate fascism that
[26:27.400 --> 26:34.480]  has a small icing at the bottom of socialism chicken feed to make you
[26:34.480 --> 26:38.360]  dependent they take your job away they ship it overseas they set up regulations
[26:38.360 --> 26:41.680]  to shut down competition they own the only stuff is allowed to operate
[26:41.680 --> 26:46.600]  centralizing control while impoverishing you but making you totally dependent on
[26:46.600 --> 26:51.360]  them like a prisoner in a cage who has Stockholm syndrome worshipping your
[26:51.360 --> 26:55.720]  abusers this is what abusers do they take you they capture you they get you
[26:55.720 --> 27:01.120]  under their control and then they brainwash you that you couldn't survive
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.360]  without me and I'll leave you in this cage and let you starve to death unless
[27:05.360 --> 27:10.040]  you love me and most people will actually love the abuser after a few weeks of
[27:10.040 --> 27:17.680]  this programming this is what's going on and this goes on in relationships this
[27:17.680 --> 27:24.600]  goes on in culture this goes on everywhere this is what these abusers do
[27:24.600 --> 27:29.600]  this is not an economy based on ideas based on merit based on competition
[27:29.600 --> 27:34.000]  based on free will free association voting with your dollars that's a
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.760]  renaissance culture this is a culture based on fraud and deceit and lies and
[27:40.760 --> 27:43.920]  what happens is the public starts picking up on that and they start
[27:43.920 --> 27:48.000]  cheating and then pretty soon you're a banana republic pretty soon you're
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.520]  Guatemala pretty soon you're Nigeria pretty soon you're Russia pretty soon
[27:52.520 --> 27:57.800]  you're in deep you know what and so I've got these articles here today it's up
[27:57.800 --> 28:03.880]  on infowars.com to Washington Times article year of action Obama vows to
[28:03.880 --> 28:09.920]  act on his own when necessary and you saw the ground being prepared for this
[28:09.920 --> 28:14.200]  when he'd say six years ago I'm a constitutional lawyer I may want to do
[28:14.200 --> 28:17.800]  stuff that'll help you but if Congress won't I can't act alone and then he's
[28:17.800 --> 28:21.960]  sort of saying I'd like to act alone but I can't you know I don't want to but I
[28:21.960 --> 28:27.880]  may have to act alone and then now this year I'm gonna act alone and he's got
[28:27.880 --> 28:33.280]  all his pundits on CNN MSNBC ABC NBC going he needs to just get the job done
[28:33.280 --> 28:38.400]  because Congress is broken why they won't he's launching military operations
[28:38.400 --> 28:41.560]  without Congress shut down power plants without Congress opening the borders up
[28:41.560 --> 28:46.200]  legalizing illegals by fiat without Congress implementing whatever portions
[28:46.200 --> 28:50.520]  of Obamacare he wants that's law that he helped put together whenever he feels
[28:50.520 --> 28:53.880]  like that's called dick day towards ship so let me tell you

[33:18.800 --> 33:24.720]  gcm radio network
[33:36.080 --> 33:40.880]  why do you think it is the mainstream media and the dominant corporations are
[33:40.880 --> 33:45.280]  still defending Obama even though he has the lowest approval rating of any
[33:45.280 --> 33:52.280]  president in history including Richard Nixon it's because he's their man do you
[33:52.280 --> 33:55.440]  think a bank robber that walks into a bank and says everybody puts your hands
[33:55.440 --> 34:00.640]  up and ties people up and kicks the clerk in the guts is is popular with the
[34:00.640 --> 34:04.360]  people being robbed you think a woman being grabbed in an alleyway and being
[34:04.360 --> 34:11.200]  raped by a gang of thugs you think they care if she doesn't like them no they
[34:11.200 --> 34:15.640]  don't care they know what they're doing but they have to create the illusion in
[34:15.640 --> 34:20.040]  mass politics and mass movements that you're all alone you're the only one
[34:20.040 --> 34:23.240]  that doesn't like Obama you're the only one that doesn't like Obama care
[34:23.240 --> 34:27.240]  doesn't matter of the number show 80 plus percenter now again said it was 70
[34:27.240 --> 34:32.320]  percent is a few months ago it doesn't matter if you can go read the bill and
[34:32.320 --> 34:36.240]  it's a total scam fraud to rip everybody off and implode the economy it
[34:36.240 --> 34:42.360]  doesn't matter they've just got to make you feel like you're alone and you're
[34:42.360 --> 34:46.400]  the only person who thinks like this even though the vast majority do and
[34:46.400 --> 34:49.960]  even though it's all illegal and Congress has a six percent approval rating
[34:49.960 --> 34:53.040]  I've never heard of a government with approval rating that low even though
[34:53.040 --> 34:59.720]  you've got a total collapse of confidence in the system we're all
[34:59.720 --> 35:04.320]  individuals so they use that against us that we don't know that almost everyone
[35:04.320 --> 35:10.640]  around us is upset as well we could change this very very quickly we have
[35:10.640 --> 35:14.400]  the hearts and minds of the people on average they know that things are going
[35:14.400 --> 35:17.280]  in a bad direction but I want to say something for the folks out there that
[35:17.280 --> 35:20.040]  aren't aren't really concerned about this that you know if they could it's
[35:20.040 --> 35:26.560]  gonna work itself out there's never been cases in history where governments
[35:26.560 --> 35:30.760]  started acting this dictatorial and doing the things they're doing and arming
[35:30.760 --> 35:34.680]  domestically against the domestic population and setting up secret police
[35:34.680 --> 35:40.160]  networks on record as they're doing there's never been a time that this was
[35:40.160 --> 35:46.600]  done and I'm a history buff I challenge you to show me a time there's never been
[35:46.600 --> 35:51.280]  a time that it wasn't done by a criminal group or groups as a looting
[35:51.280 --> 35:57.040]  operation to go after their domestic enemies and to lay waste and to take over
[35:57.040 --> 36:03.000]  society and to socially re-engineer you saw the red terror that went on for 20
[36:03.000 --> 36:10.360]  years from 1917 up until 1930 or so that killed 25 million people in the first
[36:10.360 --> 36:16.760]  round in Russia and then spilt into Ukraine Poland other areas after that
[36:16.760 --> 36:25.760]  and then the Warsaw Pact looking at this what's coming out of the ocean what
[36:25.760 --> 36:33.000]  we're up against is is so consciously evil and it has all these camp
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.480]  followers that are into the corruption and part of it who think that everything's
[36:36.480 --> 36:40.360]  going to be okay and think they're winners opening the drawbridge letting
[36:40.360 --> 36:46.400]  the evil in I mean they have no idea what the end game of this thing is if
[36:46.400 --> 36:50.000]  they get it through and I'm telling you they want to put a Republican in like
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.160]  Chris Christie after Obama leaves who will take the dictatorial reigns see
[36:54.160 --> 36:58.680]  they're making the office dictatorial and so the corporate and private and
[36:58.680 --> 37:02.440]  governmental interests that control that office in the future they are the
[37:02.440 --> 37:08.080]  dictators it's a bunch of special interest working through a dictatorial
[37:08.080 --> 37:14.480]  executive it's a dictatorship of the executive and the bureaucracy that is
[37:14.480 --> 37:23.120]  manned the bureaucracy by a revolving door of bureaucrats who revolve into
[37:23.120 --> 37:28.880]  government into the courts into the top of Monsanto into the government into the
[37:28.880 --> 37:34.800]  courts into Ford Motor Company into the government into the courts into Toyota
[37:34.800 --> 37:39.120]  into the government into the courts into the foreign owned Federal Reserve run
[37:39.120 --> 37:44.160]  now by what six different foreigners that run the Federal Reserve I mean our
[37:44.160 --> 37:48.280]  country is run by not just a private Federal Reserve it's run on record go
[37:48.280 --> 37:55.840]  look it up the board of governors almost half of them aren't even Americans and
[37:55.840 --> 38:01.920]  Obama's head economist is a French socialist woman who lives in France
[38:01.920 --> 38:10.120]  most the time we're run by a French socialist communist and see if you're
[38:10.120 --> 38:16.360]  informed you know about the VT French and you know about you know about
[38:16.360 --> 38:20.880]  reconstruction and you know about Napoleon Bonaparte and and then I'm
[38:20.880 --> 38:25.760]  sitting here watching this come down on us realizing that even intelligent
[38:25.760 --> 38:31.160]  people don't know the history and they have no idea the peril we're in so now
[38:31.160 --> 38:35.040]  they're moving to harass alternative media bloggers cock radio restrict
[38:35.040 --> 38:37.560]  internet freedom now they're going after the free speech folks not just the
[38:37.560 --> 38:40.800]  second amendment they're one of the first amendment they've annihilated the
[38:40.800 --> 38:43.880]  fourth amendment the 10th amendment the 9th amendment the 7th amendment they
[38:43.880 --> 38:50.080]  are gutting everything right now in focused military precision bringing
[38:50.080 --> 38:53.600]  down the checks and balances then acclimating I've got articles here
[38:53.600 --> 38:59.920]  today well yeah we arrested the blogger he he wrote bad things about the judge
[38:59.920 --> 39:07.200]  and who the judge was taking money from so that judge put him in jail and yeah
[39:07.200 --> 39:12.200]  they're using the NSA on Fox News and the Associated Press and and on the rest
[39:12.200 --> 39:15.400]  the media to make sure they do what they're told I mean you can't have the
[39:15.400 --> 39:19.520]  media criticizing the leader I mean we need to arrest people I mean what's
[39:19.520 --> 39:23.160]  wrong with the resting reporters and even the New York Times says it's scary
[39:23.160 --> 39:28.800]  and authoritarian and they're arresting the press I mean again ladies and
[39:28.800 --> 39:34.880]  gentlemen this this is the norm in the world is living under tyranny we've had
[39:34.880 --> 39:40.000]  this precious Eden of a little bit of freedom so we were wealthy notice as the
[39:40.000 --> 39:46.200]  freedom leaves like oxygen leaving a room as the liberty departs the prosperity
[39:46.200 --> 39:52.960]  departs and it's so frustrating to see this unfolding so how do you counter it
[39:52.960 --> 39:58.480]  you counter it by recognizing what it is calling it out and being a leader at the
[39:58.480 --> 40:02.600]  PTA at the city council at the county commissioners at your business at your
[40:02.600 --> 40:06.960]  work at your church you hear a bunch of pro-tyranny garbage you hear a bunch of
[40:06.960 --> 40:10.880]  anti-liberty garbage you hear a bunch of anti-American garbage you hear any
[40:10.880 --> 40:17.560]  type of authoritarianism you need to call these people out and speak out
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.360]  against them and and run against them or politically expose them do whatever you
[40:22.360 --> 40:28.240]  have to record them put it on YouTube get whatever get serious get aggressive
[40:28.240 --> 40:32.560]  these are aggressive criminals that are coming down on us ladies and gentlemen
[40:32.560 --> 40:36.840]  that's not rhetoric I mean look at what Ted Cruz said in Houston three days ago
[40:36.840 --> 40:40.000]  that made national news they're like how dare the senator from Texas talk like
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.280]  this it's so radical no he's reporting on what he saw if I was reporting on
[40:44.280 --> 40:48.040]  Nazi Germany watching piles of dead bodies like my grandfather said he saw
[40:48.040 --> 40:51.240]  you know just tens of thousands of dead bodies I talked to old dear hunters and
[40:51.240 --> 40:54.640]  folks I knew who were in tank battalions going into Germany as well and they just
[40:54.640 --> 41:00.080]  saw the mass graves the mass dead that's how I know that stuff went on if they
[41:00.080 --> 41:03.800]  reported on the mass graves the mass death they wouldn't be radicals they
[41:03.800 --> 41:09.800]  wouldn't be extreme they're reporting on what the extreme situation is so the
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.640]  media saying Ted Cruz is extreme well who cares what they say he only gets
[41:13.640 --> 41:18.600]  more popular as the discredited collaborator occupier media for the
[41:18.600 --> 41:24.480]  globalist the Tokyo roses put out and he says president is dangerous and
[41:24.480 --> 41:30.080]  terrifying and becoming dictatorial what did Camille Paglia call them she's been
[41:30.080 --> 41:34.000]  a big liberal a real liberal for more freedom that's what liberal means not
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.160]  not tyranny calling itself liberal she said this administration and what
[41:39.160 --> 41:49.120]  they're doing and their camp followers are fascist ultra Stalinist you know a
[41:49.120 --> 41:51.760]  once communist once fascist is all the same at the end of the day just
[41:51.760 --> 41:55.480]  different flavors of cyanide lace kool-aid folks once cherry once grape
[41:55.480 --> 42:01.480]  still does the same thing to you and we are in so much trouble ladies and
[42:01.480 --> 42:05.960]  gentlemen I cannot I cannot even describe to you how freaked out I am
[42:05.960 --> 42:12.720]  about this and Ted Cruz comes out and says that Obama is dangerous and
[42:12.720 --> 42:19.640]  terrifying and power-grabbing and becoming a dictator and they go oh he's
[42:19.640 --> 42:23.480]  discredited he he's the guy that was against Obama care yeah he's discredited
[42:23.480 --> 42:26.480]  actually say that as a talking point when it's the opposite he said it's a
[42:26.480 --> 42:30.840]  train wreck it was a train wreck so it's like you call the lottery ticket it
[42:30.840 --> 42:35.720]  comes up right and they go he's discredited he was right and they just put
[42:35.720 --> 42:39.320]  that out to make the general public think well he's discredited he's been
[42:39.320 --> 42:44.240]  exactly on target yeah that's discrediting I like Obamacare doubling or

[47:27.920 --> 47:32.080]  GCN radio network
[47:44.320 --> 47:48.800]  remember those conspiracy theorists they said all your cars were tracking you by
[47:48.800 --> 47:54.200]  the mile getting ready for a global tax it was gonna be paid to the UN the IMF
[47:54.200 --> 47:59.760]  the World Bank of course now they've globally proposed it and so has the
[47:59.760 --> 48:03.760]  Obama administration and the boxes magically have been putting all the
[48:03.760 --> 48:08.540]  new cars the last four years oh magically boxes fell right in that you
[48:08.540 --> 48:14.040]  paid for in the purchase price to tax you by the mile that's exactly what all
[48:14.040 --> 48:18.920]  the conspiracy theorists said you know the informed weirdos that actually read
[48:18.920 --> 48:25.320]  MIT and government and UN white papers that were public oh we follow what the
[48:25.320 --> 48:32.240]  global rulers do we think it's important to know what they're up to even if
[48:32.240 --> 48:35.760]  you're an evil person you'd want to know what the globalist are up to because
[48:35.760 --> 48:40.760]  then in business you can hijack everything they're doing if I wanted to in
[48:40.760 --> 48:45.080]  private business and I've already done that funding my operation in fact I'm
[48:45.080 --> 48:47.720]  getting ready to do this I'm sick of talking I've already been showing
[48:47.720 --> 48:51.280]  everybody around here what I can do and I actually try to be successful if I
[48:51.280 --> 48:55.360]  wanted to in private business knowing what they're up to I can dominate the
[48:55.360 --> 48:59.560]  insider information because they act like you're all blind all you stock
[48:59.560 --> 49:03.880]  traders I don't need inside information I can watch these people and watch what's
[49:03.880 --> 49:07.600]  going on at Davos and all their little tells and signs they give each other I
[49:07.600 --> 49:10.680]  can go into the stock market make incredible amounts of money I've tried
[49:10.680 --> 49:14.720]  it out every time I've done it nothing but making money in fact I mean I'm
[49:14.720 --> 49:19.000]  really starting to realize how dumb the general public is you people have no
[49:19.000 --> 49:26.960]  idea what's going on here a lot of you think a lot of you think that this whole
[49:26.960 --> 49:29.960]  new world order is going to be fine you're going to find a position and it's
[49:29.960 --> 49:34.240]  going to be nice to you blah blah blah you know why charities always screw up
[49:34.240 --> 49:37.920]  the economy you know why charities always create poverty you know why
[49:37.920 --> 49:42.720]  charities aren't fun why they're not cool why you avoid them like brain cancer
[49:42.720 --> 49:47.600]  because the tyrants and their camp followers will shut down all their
[49:47.600 --> 49:53.120]  competition to consolidate the market and then why should they put out a good
[49:53.120 --> 49:57.360]  product if there's no competition against them and that's why in every
[49:57.360 --> 50:02.400]  authoritarian regime within a decade on average they can take the biggest,
[50:02.400 --> 50:07.320]  fattest, most wealthy economies like Argentina was just 50 years ago more
[50:07.320 --> 50:13.920]  wealthy than the US they were the richest country in this hemisphere now
[50:13.920 --> 50:18.240]  they're one of the poorest because they let a political class of crooks come in
[50:18.240 --> 50:22.360]  and loot everything but they all wore big suits and had red carpets and had
[50:22.360 --> 50:26.320]  the newspapers bought off seeing how great it was it didn't matter because
[50:26.320 --> 50:31.920]  all they're doing is pushing BS and then at the end of the day they're done and
[50:31.920 --> 50:36.880]  they've eaten the bones off the culture the economy everything else they move
[50:36.880 --> 50:42.240]  on to the next country that kicked them out 50 a hundred years ago that kicked
[50:42.240 --> 50:46.400]  their own tyrants out that kicked their own corrupt establishment out and they
[50:46.400 --> 50:50.360]  move on to some other country that got out from under tyranny and is productive
[50:50.360 --> 50:54.520]  but it's always a generation or two later and everybody's gullible and doesn't
[50:54.520 --> 50:58.360]  recognize what a crook is and doesn't recognize what a flim flam con artist is
[50:58.360 --> 51:03.440]  and that's really what the new ruler is it's ruled by frauds and con artist and
[51:03.440 --> 51:10.880]  scum and liars and that's why I want to throw up because I'm strong folks okay
[51:10.880 --> 51:16.600]  and I've tried to broadcast 24 hours before I couldn't do it I went about 18
[51:16.600 --> 51:20.000]  hours and got such a headache I had to have somebody come in and cover for me
[51:20.000 --> 51:27.200]  I've done on-air fellowbuster before Ted Cruz went what 28 20 29 hours standing
[51:27.200 --> 51:32.520]  up and was eloquent the entire time not even going to the bathroom that that's
[51:32.520 --> 51:37.680]  I had breaks and I couldn't do it imagine not being able to urinate and he
[51:37.680 --> 51:42.320]  sat there and was fluent the entire time reading the bill and what it would do the
[51:42.320 --> 51:48.160]  day before it went into place it it goes in all hell breaks loose worse than
[51:48.160 --> 51:52.760]  what he said and then they run constant news articles saying Ted Cruz is
[51:52.760 --> 51:56.880]  discredited when he's been absolutely empowered his poll numbers are up and
[51:56.880 --> 52:01.480]  that shows their fraud doesn't work it's like saying George Washington's a loser
[52:01.480 --> 52:06.040]  seven years into the war when the British surrendered it's like saying
[52:06.040 --> 52:09.360]  whoever wins the Super Bowl this year five minutes after they win saying
[52:09.360 --> 52:14.120]  they're losers but that's how their propaganda works we're in the face of
[52:14.120 --> 52:21.240]  stinking corrupt tyranny Ted Cruz who I'm not saying is is you know Jesus or
[52:21.240 --> 52:24.960]  something the point is is that he has courage he's calling Obama a dictator a
[52:24.960 --> 52:30.160]  tyrant dangerous terrifying and he had the will to tell people something was
[52:30.160 --> 52:34.600]  bad before it happened and the media said he's discredited after that yeah
[52:34.600 --> 52:39.160]  thinking you're weak minded that would go repeat to everyone yeah he that's
[52:39.160 --> 52:42.440]  that discredited guy because you know one word like a parrot discredited

[53:37.200 --> 53:42.360]  right now I don't hate Ted Cruz because he's more eloquent than me I could speak
[53:42.360 --> 53:48.200]  longer than I can I admire him I wish I could be like that I'm not a loser I'm a
[53:48.200 --> 53:53.760]  winner big difference I'm a Liberty lover I'm a freedom lover I like private
[53:53.760 --> 53:57.480]  property I like men that are men women that are women I like I like

[54:02.040 --> 54:06.760]  don't like fraud and scams and trendiness and all the rest the garbage that
[54:06.760 --> 54:14.760]  brings down civilizations and brings down societies they get up there on their
[54:14.760 --> 54:19.000]  little establishment television screens and then their little websites and they
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.680]  should say we're just credited we have no audience we're we're done it's over
[54:23.680 --> 54:29.080]  there over if we just understand they're already over the only shoe to drop is
[54:29.080 --> 54:32.920]  that we are the majority and these people are a fraud with a 6% approval
[54:32.920 --> 54:37.840]  rating the only final domino to go over is the fact that these people are
[54:37.840 --> 54:42.880]  con artists total criminals who know their losers Ted Cruz's numbers are
[54:42.880 --> 54:47.200]  going straight up my numbers are going straight up on every metric visitors
[54:47.200 --> 54:56.200]  listeners support viral everything you could imagine because everyone in the
[54:56.200 --> 55:00.880]  system is not a criminal most of them made it of their own accord they were
[55:00.880 --> 55:03.920]  nice to the system trying to play ball but now they realize the system isn't
[55:03.920 --> 55:09.640]  playing ball with them and there is a full societal turning against this scam
[55:09.640 --> 55:13.240]  the truth is Ted Cruz is a hero for having the courage to stand up and say
[55:13.240 --> 55:17.920]  the truth and was proven right and the numbers show that the truth is we're
[55:17.920 --> 55:21.640]  exploding the truth is drudges exploding the truth is all the real media
[55:21.640 --> 55:25.720]  left right center I don't care who's real is exploding and everyone that's
[55:25.720 --> 55:29.960]  selling out in a world where everybody sells out what's the value I use the
[55:29.960 --> 55:34.200]  porn analogy of where people in porn 30 years ago could make a million dollars
[55:34.200 --> 55:39.160]  two million dollars a year making a few movies actresses actors as they call
[55:39.160 --> 55:46.120]  them really their prostitutes on film but when everybody got into the act top
[55:46.120 --> 55:50.880]  porn stars that look like Marilyn Monroe can't get $2,000 for a so-called
[55:50.880 --> 55:55.920]  scene now and see that's because there's a glut all of you people sold out and

[1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:18.440]  radio network you know I go on a rant like that one when I think about the
[1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:21.840]  difference between people like myself and my listeners and viewers who love
[1:00:21.840 --> 1:00:26.440]  liberty love the animating contest versus our collectivist control freak
[1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:33.480]  mobster enemies I mean I am just a fan of people that have great literature great
[1:00:33.480 --> 1:00:39.120]  art great minds who understand what's a big story what isn't I don't get mad at
[1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:43.640]  people that are more successful than me if they didn't steal it I just
[1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:49.560]  absolutely admire them and that's what you call progress and then I look at
[1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:53.360]  these people that are running things they want to dump people down and screw
[1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:58.280]  things up so they can cheat and run it all man that's the ultimate sin and
[1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:02.360]  these people need to be run off a planet earth put them on a spaceship

[1:01:06.440 --> 1:01:12.800]  figure it out send them to the Phantom Zone I've had enough of it I'm not your
[1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:17.560]  slave I'm done and most people that work for the system corporate government
[1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:22.280]  private you name it you're not bad you know you've gotten where you are because
[1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:26.960]  you you know you compromise some that's usually normal in a tribe where there's
[1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:30.320]  not truly evil people there's some you know guys that are thugs and guys that
[1:01:30.320 --> 1:01:33.520]  are out of control and this and that but live and let live try to work together
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:38.000]  you can't work together with scientific criminals you can't compromise with them
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.800]  I've said this over and over again I would compromise with the boss hog
[1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:45.200]  government because boss hog doesn't want to see everybody completely bankrupt and
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:48.240]  poor he just wants to be able to selectively rob a few people here in
[1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:55.920]  there and that's bad enough this is like scientific evil I mean let me tell you
[1:01:55.920 --> 1:02:01.160]  something I physically get ill whenever I run into people that are working two
[1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:04.080]  three jobs and have a couple college degrees that were rip offs and were
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:07.760]  meant to never pay off and who are hard-working smart folks that try to work
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:13.400]  in the system and they can't pay for the Obamacare insurance everyone I know
[1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:17.000]  that's middle-class or blue collar is going bankrupt right now because of
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:22.920]  Obamacare we are we are losing employees that can't afford the insurance
[1:02:22.920 --> 1:02:30.480]  because of Obamacare it is hurting family of mine and it's meant to
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:37.320]  impoverish America I mean I really care about people I don't have this cold
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:42.040]  bloodedness where I get off on seeing other people in trouble or I don't care
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:48.240]  it's the opposite I absolutely have feelings it's like that white snake
[1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:55.480]  song who knows where the cold one blows I asked my friends but nobody knows who
[1:02:55.480 --> 1:03:04.760]  am I to believe in love and he goes Lord have mercy I ain't no stranger to love
[1:03:04.760 --> 1:03:08.760]  and these psychopaths and control freaks and sociopaths think we're weak
[1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:14.000]  because we have love no you guys can mathematically see the numbers and see
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:19.680]  other people as meat to be fed on you can mathematically see how dumb down
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:25.400]  people are through your own system in great measure and then say well they
[1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:30.160]  deserve to be meat on the table because they're not even human and you revel in
[1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:34.480]  people's weakness and then you think those of us because I've been told this by
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:40.320]  a globalist those of us that care those of us that won't abuse people even if
[1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:44.920]  they're stupid and deserve it even when a stupid person does something to me it's
[1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:47.920]  like I'm too honorable to crush them unless I have two of their if they're
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:52.760]  trying to really hurt me you know the difference is I know who I am I know I'm
[1:03:52.760 --> 1:03:56.360]  more vicious more cunning and quite frankly if I want to put on an evil hat
[1:03:56.360 --> 1:03:59.920]  these so-called psychopaths and sociopaths they think they're evil and
[1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:05.160]  they're limited mathematical extraction of the data and how they think they're
[1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:09.680]  winning but if you are really good and have an understanding of the nature of
[1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:13.400]  good then it gives you an even greater understanding of the nature of evil I
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:17.600]  mean I see the stuff you guys are doing and I know of much more effective ways
[1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:23.040]  to do evil stuff sometimes I've got to really watch it when I get up here on
[1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:26.560]  air and start explaining what I would do if I was the new water because I've
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:29.920]  confirmed sometimes they actually pick up on the ideas I've actually learned some

[1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:44.200]  Geiger counters found 500 percent higher with Geiger counters 500 percent higher
[1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:49.800]  than normal and then the local health department went out and this is in the
[1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:53.880]  local news and said yes it's 500 times you're right all over the beach multiple
[1:07:53.880 --> 1:07:59.560]  locations then a professional radiology factory that makes all sorts of stuff
[1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:03.520]  x-ray machines you name it out in California including Geiger counters
[1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:08.400]  went out and said no we found 1400% with our more expensive units stuff that
[1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:10.800]  costs you know a couple thousand dollars not seven hundred dollars that the
[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:17.480]  units we have so I said that's it I said last Tuesday I said let's send
[1:08:17.480 --> 1:08:24.920]  Jacare Jackson Adon Salazar and others out to northern California where they're
[1:08:24.920 --> 1:08:28.840]  finding these really high levels that mainline radiation experts say you
[1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:32.840]  don't want to be around too long just 20 years ago they said you don't want to
[1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:36.160]  be around it now they're like oh it's fine no big deal then they had local
[1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:39.000]  newspapers that we covered Friday come out and say yes Alex Jones has been
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:43.360]  talking about it yes the radiation is increased but still it's a conspiracy
[1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:49.240]  theory to think it's a problem look I'm glad that most areas and they've gone
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:53.120]  all the way up into Oregon up to the edge of Washington and back down I'm
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:58.120]  glad that it's only 20 30 40 percent increased in most areas in some areas
[1:08:58.120 --> 1:09:04.760]  it's it's it's the you know 20 30 Miller ads like it should be not 200 300
[1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:09.160]  400 500 and now they're going to be traveling back into San Francisco tomorrow
[1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:13.120]  to talk to folks on the street are they aware of the San Francisco Bay with
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:16.440]  much higher levels of radiation then they're going to travel all the way down
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:24.120]  their central area effector in Monterey right now Monterey Bay in Monterey
[1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:28.880]  California and they're going to travel to Los Angeles San Diego Long Beach right
[1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:33.560]  down to the Mexican border checking the levels of radiation but again when I
[1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:37.520]  hear big radiation wave coming in it's going to hit in early January then
[1:09:37.520 --> 1:09:41.520]  suddenly radiation level spike I'm going to send reporters that's what you're
[1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:48.120]  supposed to do that's what real media does and I've got to say I'm very glad
[1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:51.600]  that it wasn't a thousand fourteen hundred percent what it should be all
[1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:56.000]  over the West Coast it was only in select areas the redwoods were double
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.640]  what they should be or more than double in fact we've got all the numbers on
[1:09:59.640 --> 1:10:03.480]  infoworks.com on prisonblended.com adan Salazar's reporting out they're
[1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:07.640]  having mutated whales baby whales that have two heads that's in the news massive
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:11.880]  starfish die-offs leaving us today's been covering and they've been just
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:16.280]  chronicling the levels that are being picked up out there we've been
[1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:19.880]  interviewing top physicists radiologists on air to confirm our numbers they've
[1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:24.280]  been confirming it jacari is going to be with us till 45 after riding shotgun
[1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:27.160]  with him at the bottom of the hour Anthony Gucci art is coming in with
[1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:30.800]  breaking numbers and facts with us but joining us from Monterey Bay if you're
[1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:35.560]  watching us at info wars.com forward slash show on the free feeds
[1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:39.320]  radio listeners can see how beautiful that is if it wasn't for the gun
[1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:42.680]  confiscations and the socialism and teaching five-year-olds how to wear
[1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:46.120]  dresses and have anal sex I would probably live somewhere like Santa Cruz
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:50.360]  it is so beautiful but unfortunately anything beautiful is captured by the
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:55.840]  kleptocrats but I believe California has fallen but is now globalist territory
[1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:00.000]  but regardless jacari Jackson is there jacari thank you for braving the
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:04.720]  radiation I don't even know the numbers yet on Monterey I I hope it's low or
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:09.360]  normal unlike other areas of central and northern California what are you
[1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:16.360]  finding what is about double what's considered normal as far as half moon
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:20.200]  bay where we started our search Alex you know of the viral YouTube video where
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:24.000]  citizen journalists went out and others went out and confirmed it researchers
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.600]  people who make Geiger counters went out there and found radiation levels in
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:31.800]  excess of 1400 percent of what consider what's considered normal for that
[1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:35.480]  location we went out there with our equipment we found radiation levels in
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:39.040]  excess of 10 times of what's considered to be normal now to explain this to our
[1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:43.400]  viewers we're using a Geiger counter in what's called counts per minute that is
[1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:47.400]  the number number of the number of radiation that's considered normal for
[1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:50.800]  that location for example in half moon bay at surface beach where we started
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:55.840]  our search the normal is considered to be around 30 we found over 370 that's
[1:11:55.840 --> 1:11:59.360]  what we found that's what we started our search now Alex we've been traveling all
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:02.760]  up and down the west coast we went as far as Portland Oregon we've come back
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:06.920]  down and now we're here at Monterey Bay now this is the location Alex where the
[1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:10.520]  starfish have been dying in droves you've heard about the starfish illness
[1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:14.120]  the disintegrating starfish there's a high concentration of this going out
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:17.920]  right here at this location now a lot of that's going on underwater so we can't
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:21.120]  show that to our viewers but we're very much concerned if we've been talking to
[1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:24.680]  the locals and you said Alex there's a lot of socialism there's a lot of you
[1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:28.880]  know stupid stuff going on in California we found some very awake very educated
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:32.280]  people right here on this beach we found listeners we found listeners at half
[1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:36.440]  moon bay we talked to people who were aware of the situation they knew about
[1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:40.200]  the situation they're trying to figure out how to express this to other people
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:43.520]  I talked to one woman last night back in half moon bay she said she is willing
[1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:47.480]  to strip down to her skibbies and run down the street to educate people about
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:50.600]  these about these numbers about this high level of radiation I was about
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:55.800]  ready to do it with her but I want to a scandal on my hand so so we want to stay
[1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:59.120]  on the mission Alex and now we're out here we're testing we're looking for
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:02.200]  starfish we haven't found any on the rocks we were braving the rocks probably
[1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:05.040]  got a little too close to the water to be quite honest with you but now we're
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:08.080]  back up here to share this information with our viewers and our listeners sure
[1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:11.960]  it's a great job jacarian crew it's the surfers that have been reporting it and
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:15.200]  the marine biologist oh let me tell you about a surfer Alex we talked to a
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:19.160]  lady last night half moon bay near surfers beach she says her friend one
[1:13:19.160 --> 1:13:22.840]  of her best friends surfs in surfers beach pretty much every day and he's
[1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:26.280]  going bald and I said you know when people go bald she said no it's since
[1:13:26.280 --> 1:13:29.400]  Fukushima he's like his hair has been falling out and he won't stop swimming
[1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:32.520]  in it and I said where's your friend as she said he ran around the corner when
[1:13:32.520 --> 1:13:35.520]  I came over here because he doesn't want to be on camera the surfers are being
[1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:38.800]  affected by this Alex well that's the next issue and I want to talk about all
[1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:43.800]  the different angles when we come back but the it's the bio accumulation that
[1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:47.640]  even if it's only increased maybe twenty thirty percent some areas ten times
[1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:54.000]  that builds up in mammal cells that builds up in whales dolphins humans but
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.200]  also in non mammals like fish who are at the top of the food chain we eat the
[1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:02.520]  smaller creatures that have small amounts but then it builds builds up that's
[1:14:02.520 --> 1:14:08.360]  the big issue but I'd say overall I'm just happy that it's not ten times the
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:12.600]  radiation all over the area only in certain areas of California jacari
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:16.360]  that's right likes when we were going Alex we were going further north we
[1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:20.280]  found lower levels but still double of what considered to be normal and half
[1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:25.040]  moon bay down here we found an excess of 100 counts per minute keeping in mind
[1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:27.920]  that at surfers beach the norm was around 30 so we've been hitting higher
[1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:31.840]  numbers as we've been going further south oh wait a minute your skype was
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:35.120]  cutting out at the very beginning I misunderstood I thought Monterey Bay was
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:39.320]  it 20 or 30 that's normal you're getting levels of a hundred there that's not
[1:14:39.320 --> 1:14:42.120]  good a little a little bit north of there a little bit north of here around
[1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:46.880]  here we've been hitting around 70 or so that's still not good because I was
[1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:51.040]  reading just 30 years ago it was more like 15 was the normal than 20 than 30
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:55.600]  you know they're gonna do jacar there's gonna say a hundred micro rads is gonna
[1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:59.320]  be the new normal it'll it'll just be and then it'll be 200 and 500 and then
[1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:02.880]  glowing in the dark and having three heads is gonna be normal yeah just they
[1:15:02.880 --> 1:15:07.640]  like on 9-11 they said the EPA said that the dust around the World Trade
[1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:10.520]  Center was safe to breathe they'll just do whatever they have to do to get their
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:13.400]  story out and get people not to panic about these issues and I'm not saying
[1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:16.840]  you have to run naked down the streets but do things educate yourself talk to
[1:15:16.840 --> 1:15:20.040]  other people get informed about these issues and make the best decision well
[1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:23.120]  that's the larger issue and I'm glad you reminded me of this your car when come
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:27.560]  back and talk about that we as a Austin Texas based international media system
[1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:31.160]  that's much smaller than most mainstream media we had to send a four-man crew
[1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:34.720]  that our budget doesn't even really have out there because none of them would
[1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:38.800]  cover it and the goal was a find the truth which we're finding with four
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:43.520]  different scientific Geiger counters but be get the media to cover it and
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:46.640]  finally they had local papers cover it and they admitted yeah it's higher
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:51.040]  radiation like Alex Jones said but it's not bad so it's like where's the self
[1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:54.800]  preservation of these people we'll talk to Jacarie Jackson and the rest of the
[1:15:54.800 --> 1:16:01.400]  crew when we come back as we investigate the West Coast radiation wave Alex Jones
[1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:05.320]  here with a message to fellow freedom lovers a prognosis for the entire
[1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:10.360]  planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is to
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:15.560]  shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global

[1:20:22.720 --> 1:20:26.480]  ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt raising the debt ceiling which
[1:20:26.480 --> 1:20:29.920]  has done been done over a hundred times does not
[1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:33.520]  increase our debt it does not somehow promote
[1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:37.280]  proflicacy all it does is it says you got to pay the bills that you've already
[1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:41.120]  racked up congress
[1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:44.800]  there you go obama always promoting more spending
[1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:50.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:54.400]  it's blows me away
[1:20:54.400 --> 1:20:58.240]  by the way i gotta say something about denis robin right now
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:02.720]  i didn't play a lot of that on air i haven't gotten off into it i haven't
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:06.720]  asked you cari's take on it i should have because it's interesting
[1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:09.360]  but they've got all these basketball players that are coming back to the us
[1:21:09.360 --> 1:21:13.280]  now not just rodman saying they have quote no regrets and
[1:21:13.280 --> 1:21:16.640]  smith no regrets on north korea trap and the argument is well
[1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:21.840]  we're reaching out like jimmy carter or we're reaching out like bill clinton
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:24.880]  to try to get north korea to give up weapons or something no you're not
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:28.480]  these guys all went over there and grovel to kim jong-un
[1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:32.720]  who is an absolute mass murdering dictator of the worst type
[1:21:32.720 --> 1:21:38.080]  and then denis rodman sounds like sauron i wouldn't solve the new hobbit it's
[1:21:38.080 --> 1:21:40.480]  excellent and and that's how sauron talks is
[1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:47.040]  tune style gun bull style and that's how he sounds literally
[1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:52.240]  like sauron
[1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:57.120]  i don't know what's going on here but it just shows how
[1:21:57.120 --> 1:22:00.960]  in the past if somebody went and groveled to one of the slimmiest dictators
[1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:05.120]  in the world everyone would ostracize them and hate them but but he's being
[1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:08.640]  halfway to defend it and it's like well any publicity is good publicity
[1:22:08.640 --> 1:22:11.200]  and look i wouldn't be against them traveling there if they said you're a
[1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:14.880]  dictator why don't you you know free market stop having
[1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:18.960]  giant slave camps i wouldn't be an enemy of kim jong-un
[1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:22.720]  then if he would you know try to reform and i wouldn't be an enemy of
[1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:26.160]  denis rodman the point is it's not that he went there it's that he's there
[1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:29.120]  defending him well why did why was this student
[1:22:29.120 --> 1:22:32.240]  grabbed years ago and disappeared do you know
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:38.880]  you know what he did in in mordor talk yeah he took a bible in the north korea
[1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:42.160]  now he's disappeared and rodman's like that's terrible
[1:22:42.160 --> 1:22:47.040]  i mean this just shows the disconnect of a decadent society
[1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:50.800]  disconnected from reality not caring that it's just a spectacle
[1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:54.560]  meanwhile cnn's talking about staying place for dictators and how bad it is
[1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:57.760]  and it is but cnn's been caught being paid hundreds of
[1:22:57.760 --> 1:23:00.560]  thousands of dollars to do puff pieces when they're doing investigative
[1:23:00.560 --> 1:23:05.200]  reports they get payoffs in the case of amber lyon three-time
[1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:08.400]  emmy award winner payoffs to shut down reports so they're
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:12.560]  even worse because they're not some drughead moron denis rodman
[1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:15.920]  they're seeing in they know premeditatedly what they're doing
[1:23:15.920 --> 1:23:19.120]  we're going to keep jacari into the next segment because i got a lot of stuff to
[1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:23.280]  talk to him about but i just saw that on cnn on one of the studio tv's we keep
[1:23:23.280 --> 1:23:27.120]  on in there and it made me absolutely flip out watching it no more i can't look
[1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:30.160]  at it but i just wanted to comment on that and you know what tomorrow will
[1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:32.880]  play some of him talking because i'm telling you and then play it next to
[1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:36.240]  soran talking and i'm telling you i think he may be
[1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:40.400]  soran uh now shifting gears jacari for me
[1:23:40.400 --> 1:23:43.440]  the issue here is about how the mainstream media even though the alternative
[1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:47.440]  media was getting millions of youtube views millions of uh you know articles
[1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:50.880]  getting being read by millions no one would cover this they're finally
[1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:54.960]  starting to cover it but for me it's an issue of it's a real issue of
[1:23:54.960 --> 1:24:00.240]  radiation goes up 10 but if it goes up a thousand percent and the
[1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:05.120]  media won't cover it it just shows an attitude of having no instincts to be
[1:24:05.120 --> 1:24:08.400]  in the press no instincts for a story no instincts of
[1:24:08.400 --> 1:24:13.360]  self-preservation and it shows what lapdog groups they are
[1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:17.760]  that fukushima happened three years ago the radiation waves are coming in
[1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:21.200]  and it's been in a few articles that radiation waves are hitting but nobody's
[1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:25.520]  asking is it is it safe what's happening with it jacari jackson
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:28.800]  you're exactly right alex people are more concerned about who's working on
[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:32.800]  stage and what they looked as opposed to real issues that are going on out here
[1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:36.000]  about these high levels of radiation i believe you said a few days ago on your
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:39.280]  show that if this happened 30 years ago this would be national news
[1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:42.720]  international news overnight but nobody wants to talk about this but we
[1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:45.680]  encountered some people uh very thankful people like we talked to
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:49.120]  friday on your show a gentleman who was a fisherman he said i'm glad you guys
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:52.240]  are out here covering this we saw the same thing here today and also when we
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:56.320]  went back to half moon bay right outside surface beach and they said you know
[1:24:56.320 --> 1:24:58.880]  nobody's covering this why isn't anybody talking about why so we're talking
[1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:01.920]  about this and you can go to info wars dot com and find out more about it and
[1:25:01.920 --> 1:25:04.320]  that's what you have to do you just have to hit the streets you know you can't
[1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:07.280]  sit at the computer all day you can't watch football all day you have to get
[1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:10.640]  out in the streets and find out what's going on and just educate people
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:13.920]  jacari i bet you're feeling really bad even though it's about three or four
[1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:17.280]  times the radiation background it should be there uh still it's very
[1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:20.640]  beautiful would you rather be watching the playoff games tonight or looking at
[1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:24.400]  that beautiful water be honest looking at this beautiful water you know as much
[1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:28.000]  as i love the playoffs which i really don't uh this is what this is what it
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.960]  is you know maybe one of our guys can get a shot of this this is beautiful out
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:35.280]  here may have a tinge or two of some unpleasant things in it but this is
[1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:38.320]  what life's about alex it's not about sitting on the couch and eat a potato
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:41.040]  chips it's out here being in the real world why would you want to watch this
[1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:44.320]  on a tv screen if you could actually be here this is what it is it's like it's
[1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:48.160]  a movie set out here we've been living a movie sometimes a horror movie at times
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:51.520]  on our trip but a movie nonetheless and i'm very thankful and happy to be out
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:53.680]  here sharing this information with our viewers
[1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:57.680]  well sure absolutely and we're just there so californians
[1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:01.120]  folks on the west coast can have a debate about hey
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:04.800]  maybe nobody told you but there's 10 times the regular
[1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:09.200]  radiation at all these points confirmed by health departments
[1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:12.240]  like san francisco the county that san francisco is in
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:16.880]  but still they laugh at those of us that care it's crazy
[1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:19.360]  i mean do these health department people think
[1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:24.080]  their children are radium proof do they think they're plutonium proof do they
[1:26:24.080 --> 1:26:27.600]  think they're bulletproof i don't know alex i'm not sure
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:31.280]  what exactly drives some of these people to put out these
[1:26:31.280 --> 1:26:35.200]  very uh iffy flaky reports because you know we can go out there
[1:26:35.200 --> 1:26:38.640]  with a geiger counter and check these look radiation levels just as good as
[1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:42.080]  anybody else but you know when they they won't even say this stuff
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:45.200]  it's very uh it's very disheartening and it's very concerning to me that they
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:47.920]  would do this to the own people in their own neighborhoods
[1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:50.560]  well i agree with your car look i've been asking most of the questions here
[1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:52.400]  you've been out there now for three or four days
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:56.480]  i guess since wednesday what else is important to impart to the
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:27:00.480]  listeners and viewers out there well the most important thing to do
[1:27:00.480 --> 1:27:03.680]  is to educate yourself on these issues because we talked to some people
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:06.480]  doing a man on the street just a few minutes ago and they said you know i
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:08.800]  listen to what you guys say we met some viewers out here to say we listening
[1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:11.840]  what you guys say they even watch mainstream news if you have to watch
[1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:15.280]  our show the alternative news and watch the mainstream news and find the truth
[1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:18.640]  in between at least do that but try to educate yourself on these issues it's
[1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:21.280]  very important and then once you educate yourself on this
[1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:23.440]  you know what's the next step what's the next step for you how are you going to
[1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:26.960]  protect your family ask these real questions not
[1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:30.560]  that's right that's right we're getting some break up okay i'm sorry no no no
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:33.280]  it's not your fault it's great technology but it's not perfect i'm going
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:35.760]  to go back and let you restate that in a moment we're going to break and come
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:38.720]  back with some of anthony gucciardi's questions for you and
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:42.240]  and final points that we're going to report on a larger issue about fukushima
[1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:45.440]  that could increase its meltdown at any time
[1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:49.200]  dwarfing what happened in 86 at share noble but but the big issue is
[1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:54.560]  you were live with me friday right and then today you're out there and i know
[1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:58.960]  the day before it happened everywhere you go on deserted beaches where maybe
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:02.400]  five people walk by in an hour you were telling me on the phone today
[1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:06.400]  it's listeners and that's an idea of how big the show is and not bragging hey i've
[1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:10.800]  got a big show hey i'm cool no the fact the truth's getting out
[1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:14.400]  we have a lot of listeners that's a very positive thing jacari
[1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:17.680]  it is and just as we've been talking here just uh talking to you live people
[1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:20.560]  have been walking by hey i'll show and show you know they're very appreciative

[1:31:16.880 --> 1:31:21.200]  the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to
[1:31:21.200 --> 1:31:25.280]  add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table
[1:31:25.280 --> 1:31:30.880]  and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in

[1:33:12.560 --> 1:33:16.080]  crashing through the lies and disinformation
[1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:45.920]  it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:52.560]  jacarie jackson joins us from the west coast of the united states
[1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:57.360]  where we have gotten readings 10 times or 1000 percent higher
[1:33:57.360 --> 1:34:00.480]  than safe normal background radiation levels the health department's confirmed
[1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:04.800]  our readings other professionals the actual radiologists
[1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:09.280]  with even more expensive ones um digercounters have found 1400
[1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:13.680]  times at the beaches we visited so that's 400
[1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:20.000]  percent higher than the thousand percent that we found
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:23.600]  so uh this is a very very serious situation and
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:28.320]  you know i'm here i am just being glad that monoray bay only has a thousand
[1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:31.600]  micro rads when it's supposed to be 25 or whatever
[1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:35.040]  and it's like well compared to a thousand jacarie that's great news
[1:34:35.040 --> 1:34:38.800]  let me tell you how they get away with this here's a daily mail article bbc
[1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:43.280]  six-year cover-up of secret green propaganda training for top executives of
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:46.560]  the bbc one of the biggest media organizations worldwide
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:49.920]  has the largest staff of any organization in media worldwide
[1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:54.000]  over 10 000 and they have been meeting on how to lie
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:57.440]  how to put out a unified message about carbon dioxide carbon dioxide's what
[1:34:57.440 --> 1:35:00.800]  plants live off of they put off oxygen they've done the ice core samples
[1:35:00.800 --> 1:35:04.640]  carbon dioxide's the lowest level ever recorded in the aggregate in the last
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:07.200]  200 years i mean it's like a godsend that the
[1:35:07.200 --> 1:35:11.360]  industrial revolution came to do this plants stop growing without it you can
[1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:14.480]  double triple co2 it's only a few percentage of the atmosphere
[1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:18.560]  and trees grow faster there's more oxygen people are more healthy
[1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:23.040]  the earth's losing its atmosphere like mars i've had top astrophysicists on
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:28.720]  geologists on atmospheric experts on uh meteorologists on and the truth is you
[1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:32.560]  can look this up the earth is losing its atmosphere
[1:35:32.560 --> 1:35:36.320]  and if this continues another 100 000 years we could lose our atmosphere
[1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:39.920]  and lose our oceans that that's being looked at right now
[1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:47.760]  just just search engine and my issue is we're running out of co2
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:50.720]  and i'm not defending petrochemicals get rid of it get rid of the oil based
[1:35:50.720 --> 1:35:55.200]  economy they're super toxic they're toxic to me and my family
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:35:58.000]  all the derivatives of the oil they can't sell to you they end up putting
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:01.520]  another stuff and putting the fertilizer i mean i'm not for that i want
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:05.840]  alternative energy my issue is that compared
[1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:11.280]  uh to radiation and gmo and all this it's nothing jacari jackson we've got our
[1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:15.600]  real in-house expert anthony gutiarty of story leak dot com
[1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:19.440]  in studio with us to ask you a few questions and then to basically sum up
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:23.280]  the latest breaking news of what's happening not just here but fukushima
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:27.200]  but for me jacari again this is about forcing
[1:36:27.200 --> 1:36:31.280]  the dinosaur media to report this or to show they won't report it in a few
[1:36:31.280 --> 1:36:35.360]  newspapers have reported and talked about us forcing it out in the open
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:39.520]  that was my goal what do you think you're going to see traveling down now
[1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:42.720]  next uh maybe go back to san francisco or maybe other cities ask them about the
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:45.200]  increased radiation what they think about it
[1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:47.600]  you're going to go to los angeles uh i know you're talking about going out to
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:50.320]  the old air force space it's got radioactive dumps set it
[1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:54.240]  they're in sacramento what is the itinerary then we've got some questions
[1:36:54.240 --> 1:36:58.000]  from anthony gutiarty here well we're going to finish up around this area
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:01.120]  alex will may do a few more men on the streets talk to a few more people then
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:04.320]  we'll go ahead north back to the san francisco area
[1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:06.720]  let's talk to the people around there because that seems to be the highest
[1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:09.920]  concentration a little bit southwest of san francisco so we definitely want to
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:13.440]  warn those people and let them know what's going on
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:16.880]  what are some of the radiation numbers you've gotten in other areas i know you
[1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:20.720]  don't have the sheet in front of you i've actually got it uh here in my stack
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:23.760]  uh but you got all sorts of readings all over the place
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:27.840]  yes alex the highest reading we got outside of surface beach was about one
[1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:31.280]  twelve that's probably about an hour north of here on a beach
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:33.680]  but those were the pretty pretty much the highest concentration was right
[1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:36.880]  around the area of surface beach near half moon bay
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:41.920]  but you've got a 90 or was it 100 uh just north of monoray bay
[1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:45.680]  yes around this area we got about a 90 or so but the highest level was a one
[1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:48.960]  12 outside of uh outside of surface beach south of surface which is nothing
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:51.920]  compared to a thousand which you have a youtube video
[1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:57.200]  up on info wars dot com a thousand on a beach outside san francisco at half
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:01.680]  moon bay yes about 78 yes a little bit around here
[1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:05.920]  yes sir that's right so so so a a a thousand percent
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:09.200]  but that would be 10 times than the normal level
[1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:11.760]  that's exactly right i'm just going through my head of all the numbers we've
[1:38:11.760 --> 1:38:15.520]  encountered and those are the numbers around here but up in uh surface beach
[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:18.400]  we had the very high numbers around seven three seventy two
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:22.160]  on the cpm's counts per minute and again the question is why is it going up
[1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:25.920]  well we can pull up the fox news or ap articles from november
[1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:28.640]  out of the major universities and government studies saying we're picking
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:32.880]  up large radiation waves uh from the ongoing meltdowns in the water they
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:38.160]  dump on the five reactors that blew up uh that comes right across the water
[1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:41.360]  the the currents the air all of it comes right at the west coast
[1:38:41.360 --> 1:38:44.160]  and they're saying it would start hitting in january and suddenly they admit
[1:38:44.160 --> 1:38:48.080]  the levels are going up but then they're saying a lot of the isotopes
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:52.400]  show that it's right on and and and other things that are naturally occurring
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:54.800]  so they're saying they don't know where that's coming from well is it from
[1:38:54.800 --> 1:38:59.120]  volcanoes is it from the super caldera in yellowstone they admit
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:02.560]  that is releasing so many different types of radioactive isotopes
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:06.800]  jacari do you have any ideas well i think fukushima is definitely uh
[1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:10.800]  definitely a big culprit in this also the super volcano that you mentioned
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:14.640]  also various toxic toxic waste we talked to a woman near surface beach he said
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:17.760]  they were dumping toxic waste out there several years ago she thinks that it
[1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:22.240]  has something to do with it pollution debris coming in from the tsunami and
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:24.960]  various things over there in japan and that's one of the big questions i kept
[1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:27.760]  posing to people who were a little skeptical to say that this could have
[1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:31.120]  something to do with fukushima and we talked to several people uh as far
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:35.600]  north as alaska people from alaska they said they saw debris from japan
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:38.320]  near alaska and i said well how did you know it's from japan she said it had
[1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:41.360]  japanese writing oh no they admit the rubble from all those houses and the
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:43.680]  rest of us been floating in we've got a few minutes for a break we're coming
[1:39:43.680 --> 1:39:47.120]  back with gucciardi and and his breakdown of this but antony
[1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:51.440]  any questions you've got that i haven't covered uh with jacari and the crew that
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:54.000]  are out there i do we're going to break down specifically
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:57.760]  how we knew in 2011 all this would happen and how 78 percent of all the
[1:39:57.760 --> 1:40:01.440]  radioactive waste from fukushima went into the pacific ocean
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:06.080]  my question is why is there any doubt that fukushima has already hit the west
[1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:08.960]  coast we have the experts saying in 2011 but we know
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:12.320]  sure they found it in tuna three months after 78 percent of the radioactive
[1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:15.600]  waste went into the pacific ocean it is on the west coast doesn't matter if
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:18.960]  these certain instances are fukushima which they most likely are
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:22.800]  every single thing is pointing to the fact that this radiation is here and all
[1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:25.680]  the experts were warning about it but for me the bigger issue is the media
[1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:28.800]  doesn't want to investigate because it turns out this radioactive waste being
[1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:31.840]  dumped everywhere it's part of a culture of don't look
[1:40:31.840 --> 1:40:36.320]  and then it won't be there and it like you said it bio accumulates
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:39.760]  so there's little hot pockets all around and maybe some's from fukushima some
[1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:42.800]  is from illegal dumping you know whatever there's hot pockets around
[1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:45.600]  there are thousands of times percentage wise higher than they
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:49.520]  should be and the government is just saying oh it's fine you know as they
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:53.280]  quietly stockpile 14 million doses of potassium iodide
[1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:57.680]  i want to ask jacari what he thinks i mean do people realize what's going on
[1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:01.920]  are they still in denial on average are they waking up and and if you want to
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:04.240]  ask him why they think the government's stockpiling on that that's a good
[1:41:04.240 --> 1:41:07.920]  question yeah that's a good question on average people are at least receptive to
[1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:11.600]  the information anthony some people are convinced that's global warming even
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:15.840]  though we have record number numbers of ice and geologists and uh various people
[1:41:15.840 --> 1:41:19.440]  so radiation is from global warming so the radiation on the beaches is from
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:21.680]  global warming that's what that's what people are convinced
[1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:24.160]  even though it has nothing to do with it i mean well what is that even
[1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:27.920]  well they they read it in the newspaper they saw it on some website uh with a
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:31.600]  big fancy uh government funded website and they believe that's the cause of it
[1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:35.360]  well i'd like to know what website says that in increased radiation pockets
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:37.920]  around the west coast has to do with global warming
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:40.880]  well you know that's a very good he got hemorrhoids global warming get it but
[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:44.240]  i'm sorry go ahead yeah just like you said i mean we've seen uh the science
[1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:47.040]  is getting stuck in ice and all the record numbers of ice and the low
[1:41:47.040 --> 1:41:50.240]  temperatures around the united states but some people are convinced that if
[1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:53.680]  anything happens it's uh it's global warming can't be figured out if we
[1:41:53.680 --> 1:41:56.960]  just record global warming if we just pay money
[1:41:56.960 --> 1:42:02.160]  to george soros and al gore al gore that's right then it will make the earth
[1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:05.120]  it will make the earth cold again and i guess we've been paying the money with
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:09.600]  bailout so they made it colder yeah you know you know what i want to talk to the
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:13.200]  crew but we'll do that tomorrow jacari don't let me forget
[1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:16.880]  to talk to the camera guys and get their take and also our writer adan
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:20.560]  salazar who's out there uh tomorrow on the show you're gonna be
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:23.520]  on during the weekday show i want to get their take on all this and get their
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:26.320]  angles as well great sounds great
[1:42:26.320 --> 1:42:29.200]  all right so next tomorrow where are you going to be tomorrow
[1:42:29.200 --> 1:42:33.200]  say at noon on the weekday show we plan to be in san francisco possibly at the
[1:42:33.200 --> 1:42:36.320]  golden gate i think that'd be a good location to broadcast from
[1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:40.640]  yeah let's do that uh let's broadcast from down there and talk to folks if they
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:42.320]  know that hey right down the road from here
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:46.960]  thousand fourteen hundred times uh or fourteen hundred percent to be technical
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:49.680]  uh increase in radiation are you concerned about that they'll probably
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:53.520]  say yeah i want to slit my throat and spray the blood into al gore's mouth
[1:42:53.520 --> 1:42:56.640]  and give my children to him and give him my bank account he will save me the
[1:42:56.640 --> 1:43:00.560]  man bear pig oh we praise you oh my gosh

[1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:10.560]  bromine a practice now banned in nations around the
[1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:13.200]  world guess what else is in a halogen family

[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:21.440]  the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to
[1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:25.520]  add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:31.120]  and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:33.840]  areas that had previously been deficient in iodine

[1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:32.080]  the way this is a plug to funder operation it's also a great product
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:34.640]  about six eight months ago i was trying to figure out
[1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:39.440]  iodine's i could give myself my wife my children
[1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:43.760]  they didn't have all the mercury and stuff of seaweed and of uh sushi though i
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:47.440]  love sushi by the way that's the last night and i was interviewing all these
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:50.160]  scientists medical doctors they said well it's nason iodine but they said
[1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:53.600]  nobody's really got it there's one little laboratory that's got a patent
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:58.080]  and puts it out and certified by the national academy of sciences so i got
[1:47:58.080 --> 1:48:03.520]  it started using it had great effects on my clarity my thyroid my body so i said
[1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:07.440]  well just buy you i mean i'm going to put this out and it's been very successful
[1:48:07.440 --> 1:48:11.440]  it's survival shield we're the exclusive distributor nason iodine dietary
[1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:15.360]  supplement it's blue on paper blue purple like the pure iodine crystal
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:19.760]  not red or black like the oxidized bound stuff they call nascent
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:23.600]  we have the only real nascent iodine in the world
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:26.400]  and it makes me so nervous we're trying to like get it and move it to and have
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:29.440]  another facility to make it right now and have gotten the crystals
[1:48:29.440 --> 1:48:32.880]  to be able to do that but the point is this is a big deal
[1:48:32.880 --> 1:48:35.680]  this is a very powerful thing on the halogen group
[1:48:35.680 --> 1:48:39.120]  it fills up your glands your thyroid so the bad radiation the
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:43.360]  the fluoride can't go into it and we sell it at info wars
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:50.400]  life.com or you can call 888-253-3139 and it's sold out last week another
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:54.400]  truck is going to arrive at our distribution center in texas
[1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:58.560]  on tuesday now so we'll have more but that's a limited supply there was a big
[1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:02.720]  spike and the stockpile we had sold out so we'll have a limited supply
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:04.720]  coming that'll get out so get your order in now
[1:49:04.720 --> 1:49:10.320]  info wars life.com or 888-253-3139 and i wasn't even going to plug this talking
[1:49:10.320 --> 1:49:12.320]  about Fukushima i realized in the last segment
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:17.120]  that i've only taken it this morning i take it twice a day as recommended
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:21.040]  consult your physician yourself before you take it but people thought i was like
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:25.200]  a crazy man to take iodine because that's real normal iodine is like rocket fuel
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:29.200]  it's like worse than diesel to taste it no no this is real iodine this is pure
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:34.240]  not all bound and toxic tasting and the government won't tell you they bought
[1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:37.040]  14 million dosages just two weeks ago big national
[1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:40.720]  news story when they did but they won't tell you that you should go out
[1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:44.160]  and that you should try to protect your body and there's ways
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:46.880]  when you have this background radiation increasing all over the country not just
[1:49:46.880 --> 1:49:50.800]  west coast to protect yourself anthony gucciardi get into all the other points
[1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:53.280]  appreciate you coming in today to talk about this and now we're at the end of
[1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:57.680]  the show because i ran over with jacari well i've always said a smart real good
[1:49:57.680 --> 1:50:01.840]  government would buy iodine for its citizens well they did that in the 20s
[1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:05.120]  yeah exactly they made you take it that added it to the salt and iq went up
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:09.440]  20 points over the decade or so but a smart government would say hey get a
[1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:12.400]  hold of some iodine or even potassium iodide which is
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:16.160]  i wouldn't take it it's in an emergency scenario you would but the key thing
[1:50:16.160 --> 1:50:19.520]  here is that government has known since 2011 even a little bit before that
[1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:22.400]  potassium iodide is is a different from the nation
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:26.240]  yes exactly you take that only in the event that you're literally staring at a
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:29.920]  nuclear reactor blowing up but anyway the next time you can take
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:35.040]  deli but the key here is that we've known for years now
[1:50:35.040 --> 1:50:41.760]  that not only did fukushima blow up and exceed Chernobyl levels specifically
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:45.760]  tepco had to admit chando 100 times yes tepco had to admit
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:50.640]  this that 42 percent of Chernobyl's amount of radiation was released in the
[1:50:50.640 --> 1:50:55.440]  initial release of fukushima this is admitted now they had to admit it
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:50:58.640]  after the study came out and it exceeded two and a half times the amount they
[1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:02.960]  announced which was already fixed by them and said oh yeah you know it's a
[1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:05.360]  little bit more than that it was over and over and over again now it's a hundred
[1:51:05.360 --> 1:51:08.560]  times but 42 percent of that for that was in
[1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:12.160]  chernobyl was released in the first initial emission and they admit to cover
[1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:14.960]  up in japan now the question is why is there a cover up here
[1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:20.480]  no exactly and then what also happened is everything that was released
[1:51:20.480 --> 1:51:23.760]  20 percent of it fell on the japanese land and that's why they're all getting
[1:51:23.760 --> 1:51:27.440]  cancers two percent uh landed outside the country wasn't
[1:51:27.440 --> 1:51:33.200]  that much but 78 percent went into the pacific ocean
[1:51:33.200 --> 1:51:36.560]  that's according to the international atomic energy agency yep and it's all
[1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:38.960]  coming over here now here's the secret though
[1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:42.320]  this is how we've known about this and that's out of the guardian yes
[1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:45.920]  and we've known about this for a while but listen to that that was the initial
[1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:49.440]  release right what it was a huge deal that when it first blew up and it it
[1:51:49.440 --> 1:51:53.520]  meant chernobyl's killed over a million people and it matched 42 of that from
[1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:56.560]  chernobyl in the first initial blast now get this
[1:51:56.560 --> 1:52:00.160]  this is from the guardian fukushima radiation leaks
[1:52:00.160 --> 1:52:04.160]  reached deadly new high and that's from september 2013
[1:52:04.160 --> 1:52:09.040]  it recently reached the highest amount of radiation emission
[1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:13.040]  not even the initial explosion came close to it so it's now leaking
[1:52:13.040 --> 1:52:17.360]  more and that means that more is going into the this is an ongoing meltdown
[1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:20.880]  it's going on forever it's called fukushima forever by top
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:24.320]  i believe it was stanford or Yale professor well the top physicist up in
[1:52:24.320 --> 1:52:28.000]  canada what susuki uh said that uh if it continues to melt
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:31.680]  down bye bye japan was the quote japan will be gone he says and then everyone
[1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:34.480]  will have to evacuate the west coast but instead the government says nothing
[1:52:34.480 --> 1:52:38.480]  and here's another quote this is from last year
[1:52:38.480 --> 1:52:42.320]  here's a quote from a nuclear policy lecture at the university of california
[1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:45.760]  and i'm showing everyone this because they're asking how we knew all the
[1:52:45.760 --> 1:52:48.800]  radio listeners where we've got a video feed it in fours dot com
[1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:52.000]  yeah exactly i'm gonna read it obviously says look at what's going on now
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:55.840]  they're dumping huge amounts of radio activity into the ocean no one expected
[1:52:55.840 --> 1:52:59.200]  that in 2011 we told you about it he says we could have
[1:52:59.200 --> 1:53:04.160]  have we could have large numbers of cancer from ingestion of fish
[1:53:04.160 --> 1:53:09.040]  that's a university nuclear policy lecture at the university of santa cruz
[1:53:09.040 --> 1:53:11.600]  so he's saying we could have large amounts of cancer from fish and he's
[1:53:11.600 --> 1:53:15.200]  saying how could we have known we should go interview him the guys are
[1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:17.360]  near santa cruz no we shouldn't he's actually a good
[1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:21.360]  guy for saying this i'm not making fun of him but you know he's saying how
[1:53:21.360 --> 1:53:25.520]  could we possibly have known this in 2011 we knew in 2011 they were dumping it
[1:53:25.520 --> 1:53:28.400]  all into the ocean it's right on the ocean they're dumping water on it to
[1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:32.160]  cool it it's running out in the ocean yeah there's dead fish all across across
[1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:35.760]  the west coast and unfocused sheen and everything i mean we knew this in 2011
[1:53:35.760 --> 1:53:39.440]  and it's hitting new highs so it's not just the initial blast now
[1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:43.280]  what we're getting across is that there's no debate it's it's happening
[1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:46.720]  let's be clear the fish continue to eat and eat and eat and build it up
[1:53:46.720 --> 1:53:51.360]  yeah they're like sponges or magnets for it
[1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:55.200]  yeah the very nature of our biology is a magnet for radiation that's why it's
[1:53:55.200 --> 1:53:57.840]  so pervasive and deadly and also you have to think about the
[1:53:57.840 --> 1:54:00.560]  fact that it's so much radiation is dispersing throughout the ocean in
[1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:03.120]  different hot pockets so there may be certain radiation
[1:54:03.120 --> 1:54:06.480]  readings along the coast that are different than other areas but overall
[1:54:06.480 --> 1:54:10.560]  is kind of like dropping like black ink into a pool you know
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:14.960]  it's going to infiltrate it overall but there will be larger areas of the
[1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:18.000]  ink you know throughout the pool system so basically
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:21.600]  the key thing is the media likes to pretend that oh you know
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:25.040]  maybe Fukushima is coming over here it's it's slightly possible
[1:54:25.040 --> 1:54:29.040]  there's no debate it is here everything else is just beyond that
[1:54:29.040 --> 1:54:33.760]  it's just all the every major reactor gets caught dumping it locally just
[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:37.520]  burying it on county or city land again i'm all for nuclear power if they
[1:54:37.520 --> 1:54:40.480]  would have done it right but the answer is you can't be for it
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:43.360]  because all these companies individuals are a bunch of crooks
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:46.720]  who'd rather claim they stored it properly and keep the money mafia
[1:54:46.720 --> 1:54:50.320]  connected idiots who hire homeless people with duct tape to put up the
[1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:54.160]  red that's tepco on record bbc ap Reuters reporting
[1:54:54.160 --> 1:54:58.240]  are hiring drunken homeless people to remove the thousands of rods
[1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:02.160]  if one of them touches new explosion and they ended up using duct tape the real
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:05.040]  workers in the beginning to fix the melting down
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:09.600]  rods the reactors and everything the vancouver sun also tested fish imports
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:13.520]  from japan found ccm 137 at alarming rates contaminating
[1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:18.960]  30 73 of mackerel 91 of halibut 92 of sardines 93
[1:55:18.960 --> 1:55:23.040]  of tuna 94 of cod 100 of carp seaweed shark and
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:26.240]  monkfish and by the way the fda and epa
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:29.760]  that happened three months after they covered up and are still covering up
[1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:32.880]  and later went yes we knew but we don't think it's a problem so we didn't tell
[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:35.440]  you when that came out by private groups few years ago
[1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:38.000]  they said well we decided not to tell you and they turn their camera and these
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:41.520]  people the russians told people once your noble blew up better than this
[1:55:41.520 --> 1:55:46.240]  it's like what type of dirtbag government do we have and listen to this too
[1:55:46.240 --> 1:55:51.040]  radioactive plume expected to reach us coastal waters soon and it says our
[1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:54.320]  large plume of radiation is expected to begin flowing into the
[1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:57.520]  coastal waters in the beginning of 2014 and continue through
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:56:00.960]  throughout 2006 that's the fox news thing i mean
[1:56:00.960 --> 1:56:04.880]  every how does that professor and he's great for exposing it but how is he
[1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:08.400]  like we had no idea of course it's happening we already knew that
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:11.040]  2000 yeah it's not like it's not like the current goes
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:14.480]  south from japan it goes right across at us yeah that's why they would launch
[1:56:14.480 --> 1:56:17.200]  hot air balloons and with bombs and i'm
[1:56:17.200 --> 1:56:19.680]  knowing unguided they would rain down on america
[1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:23.280]  because it goes right over the u.s and drops and bombs i also want to say that
[1:56:23.280 --> 1:56:26.720]  jicari's out there those guys are out there no one else is doing this
[1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:31.200]  no one no one else and again that's the bigger issue why not exactly in the
[1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:34.720]  media needs to come if it wasn't for drudgereport.com covering our story
[1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:37.280]  it wouldn't even probably be in the newspapers in the west coast now we
[1:56:37.280 --> 1:56:40.880]  force that but we're literally on the forefront fighting against this and if
[1:56:40.880 --> 1:56:44.640]  we don't do something about it even the top professors say of the 1400
[1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:47.920]  plus rods that are in there if just too hit
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:52.160]  it's it's a complete meltdown and susuki says it's bye bye japan
[1:56:52.160 --> 1:56:55.440]  and there's so statistically it's almost impossible for it not to happen
[1:56:55.440 --> 1:56:58.480]  because the the rods are so complex they have homeless people and they're
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:00.960]  cleaning it i mean it is like another thing
[1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:04.160]  it's homeless people but i saw the videos and photos these are obviously
[1:57:04.160 --> 1:57:07.280]  like 70 year old drunks i mean it's like a joke
[1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:10.720]  you should have guys in spacesuits in there instead they bring homeless people
[1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:13.840]  in to do work that i wouldn't do i'm not skilled enough
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:16.800]  yeah exactly there's no nobody skilled will go do it it's not that even that
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:19.040]  they're homeless is that they don't know what they're doing
[1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:22.880]  no that's my point is that is that yeah yeah of course and they don't they don't
[1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:25.600]  even have like the nuclear councils around the world are saying hey we'll
[1:57:25.600 --> 1:57:28.320]  come help we need to globally well it's like hiring a homeless person to do
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:30.320]  brain surgery exactly yeah and they're they're coming
[1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:32.960]  and saying hey we need to do something about this and japan's like we'll know
[1:57:32.960 --> 1:57:35.920]  it's okay you know tepco's on it everything's fine
[1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:38.640]  and tepco's going yeah you know it did actually hit the newest high in
