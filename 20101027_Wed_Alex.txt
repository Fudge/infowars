[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:30.160]  feels like a Monday because I've been out of town we did do the show live from
[00:30.160 --> 00:34.680]  KSCO Allen Santa Cruz on Monday we had a retransmission for part of the
[00:34.680 --> 00:39.160]  broadcast Paul Watson filled in yesterday on Tuesday it is the 27th day of
[00:39.160 --> 00:44.720]  October 2010 we're gonna be live here for at least the next three hours now
[00:44.720 --> 00:52.600]  we've got some huge breaking news today some huge breaking news today we
[00:52.600 --> 00:58.200]  reared an interview from two weeks ago with Jesse Ventura but he's gonna be
[00:58.200 --> 01:02.360]  live again today with us for a little more than an hour coming up in about
[01:02.360 --> 01:09.640]  60 minutes because Jesse has gone a lot of national television shows on live
[01:09.640 --> 01:15.160]  TV and off air and gotten in the host face about the fact that Gulf of Tonkin
[01:15.160 --> 01:19.320]  was staged 9-11 was staged we've got all the election news coming up the open
[01:19.320 --> 01:24.760]  border news Obama on Mexican TV in Mexico saying the Republicans your enemy you
[01:24.760 --> 01:29.400]  know vote for the Democrats this is sedition that's all coming up but I
[01:29.400 --> 01:34.800]  wanted to get Jesse Ventura on because he is the most vocal spokesman for 911
[01:34.800 --> 01:39.040]  truth because he gets on more national television than anybody else and he's
[01:39.040 --> 01:43.120]  obviously a powerful media figure and well-spoken but I wanted to have Ventura
[01:43.120 --> 01:46.840]  on not so much about the TV show and other things that are happening but
[01:46.840 --> 01:51.840]  specifically 9-11 and go over all the new 9-11 news that's come out now I
[01:51.840 --> 01:55.560]  talked to him about a week and a half ago and he knew I was going out of town
[01:55.560 --> 02:00.680]  so he said come on after he said I'll come on after I get back you know after
[02:00.680 --> 02:05.800]  I had returned to Austin so I called him yesterday he's coming on today and just
[02:05.800 --> 02:10.680]  since I talked to him even more evidence of what he's specifically coming on
[02:10.680 --> 02:15.920]  concerning 9-11 even more of that information on that specific area has
[02:15.920 --> 02:21.480]  come out and that's the control demolition of Tower one two and seven
[02:21.480 --> 02:30.240]  nine years ago on September 11th 2001 in the last month there has been five
[02:30.240 --> 02:37.720]  terabytes thousands of videos and in audio clips released by NIST by the
[02:37.720 --> 02:44.040]  federal government now the CIA going back for decades will classify millions
[02:44.040 --> 02:49.120]  of news articles a year because once the government looks at something it
[02:49.120 --> 02:51.680]  doesn't want other people in the government looking at it they will
[02:51.680 --> 02:56.080]  classify it the news article is still out there publicly available but the CIA
[02:56.080 --> 02:59.640]  itself classifies it so that their investigators and people in other
[02:59.640 --> 03:04.680]  branches of government don't have access to it their databases now most of what
[03:04.680 --> 03:10.280]  NIST has has never been seen before because it was shot by FBI CIA local
[03:10.280 --> 03:15.440]  police port authority firefighters and other agencies that got their cameras
[03:15.440 --> 03:19.480]  out even 10 years ago you know already most agencies had their own cameras to
[03:19.480 --> 03:22.840]  document everything if you go out to any type of event or city council member
[03:22.840 --> 03:27.560]  city council event you'll see police there video taping things and so NIST
[03:27.560 --> 03:32.640]  classified these thousands of videos no one's even chronicled them all we know
[03:32.640 --> 03:39.440]  there's thousands a organization sued the International Center for 9-11
[03:39.440 --> 03:42.920]  studies spent years getting these they've got an incredible job I want to get
[03:42.920 --> 03:46.680]  them on sometime this week or next week to thank them and to talk about the
[03:46.680 --> 03:49.880]  process of getting these I want the International Center for 9-11 studies on
[03:49.880 --> 03:53.320]  as soon as possible thank you a note to the producers because we think on our
[03:53.320 --> 03:57.800]  feet here it's all part of a live interactive you see what happens here
[03:57.800 --> 04:01.160]  you know inside our office it's all completely transparent I want to get
[04:01.160 --> 04:07.080]  them on but every day people going through these videos are finding new
[04:07.080 --> 04:14.480]  incredible bombshells the new one today the new one that's come out today is so
[04:14.480 --> 04:19.880]  incredible and it only backs up the hundreds and hundreds of videos that
[04:19.880 --> 04:24.800]  people taped off the news that confirmed bombs in tower one two and seven the
[04:24.800 --> 04:27.760]  firefighters and police saying they were told to get back building seven was
[04:27.760 --> 04:32.040]  going to be blown up with a controlled demolition now NIST has released stuff
[04:32.040 --> 04:37.440]  confirming that and the newest info just out today is at prisonplana.com and
[04:37.440 --> 04:43.000]  infowars.com and it's one of the biggest pieces of evidence yet and Jesse
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.080]  Ventura coming up in about 55 minutes from now will join us to go over all of
[04:48.080 --> 04:52.000]  this but I'll tell you about this info on the other side of the break get into

[07:03.000 --> 07:07.000]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.240]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[07:11.240 --> 07:15.520]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:15.520 --> 07:19.880]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:19.880 --> 07:23.960]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:23.960 --> 07:28.520]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.520 --> 07:32.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:32.640 --> 07:36.600]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:36.600 --> 07:40.440]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.440 --> 07:43.120]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.120 --> 07:49.120]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[07:49.120 --> 07:53.800]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to
[07:53.800 --> 08:02.600]  my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 he's the t-rex of political talk
[08:02.600 --> 08:08.040]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:13.160 --> 08:18.880]  awful talking incident never happened well fifty thousand of my generation died
[08:18.880 --> 08:23.080]  and over something that was a lie and I didn't I didn't touch that that's not
[08:23.080 --> 08:28.280]  where I was going this one's a lie too well that exchange took place after my
[08:28.280 --> 08:32.200]  interview with Jesse Ventura that was just a preview now here's the entire
[08:32.200 --> 08:36.040]  interview with the shy guy the retiring former wrestler former governor
[08:36.040 --> 08:42.280]  okay former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura will be joining us live it is
[08:42.280 --> 08:49.400]  Wednesday October 27th 2010 and going back a few weeks ago I noticed that Jesse
[08:49.400 --> 08:52.520]  was going on a lot of national television shows and talking about the fact
[08:52.520 --> 08:57.320]  that Gulf of Tonkin was staged and was a lie to get us into Vietnam and so was
[08:57.320 --> 09:01.520]  the destruction of the World Trade Center towers and I agree with the Jesse
[09:01.520 --> 09:07.400]  when he focuses in on the control demolition of Tower 1 2 and 7 now I
[09:07.400 --> 09:11.160]  wanted to get Jesse on today and he's coming up in about 51 minutes from now
[09:11.160 --> 09:17.600]  to specifically talk about the fact that the International Center for 9-11
[09:17.600 --> 09:24.840]  Studies has sued in the last two years and was able to get because NIST for
[09:24.840 --> 09:28.880]  many years was refusing under four year request Freedom of Information Act
[09:28.880 --> 09:35.240]  request to release the thousands and thousands of videos and in an audio
[09:35.240 --> 09:42.560]  from police and fire and emergency management transmissions well now in
[09:42.560 --> 09:46.440]  the last two and a half three weeks people been culling through the thousands
[09:46.440 --> 09:53.120]  of videos and every day huge bombshell information comes out remember this
[09:53.120 --> 09:57.960]  video a few weeks ago 911 firefighters reveal huge explosions before towers
[09:57.960 --> 10:02.760]  collapse and that cooperates all the other mainstream newscast that showed
[10:02.760 --> 10:10.200]  firemen police medical workers FBI others saying bombs are going off there
[10:10.200 --> 10:14.520]  were bombs going off there were bombs going off before the planes even hit
[10:14.520 --> 10:21.960]  about 20 seconds before and then right before this is just incredible as they
[10:21.960 --> 10:26.800]  were staging this control demolition in phases so that it didn't become too
[10:26.800 --> 10:31.280]  obvious for the public part of other NIST videos that have been released show
[10:31.280 --> 10:35.920]  amateur shooting video of seven and before it collapses you hear boom boom
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.240]  boom boom then a few minutes later boom boom boom boom and then boom boom boom
[10:41.240 --> 10:47.800]  boom it falls and NIST was also caught because they released some videos again
[10:47.800 --> 10:52.320]  in the last three weeks that were already publicly released by other
[10:52.320 --> 10:59.080]  agencies or that we have a newscast of and NIST edited out the audio of the
[10:59.080 --> 11:05.040]  explosions going off I mean why are they trying to hide this information now
[11:05.040 --> 11:09.200]  remember separately we have CNN and local news stations with police saying
[11:09.200 --> 11:13.160]  get back they're about to bring down building seven we have BBC false
[11:13.160 --> 11:18.280]  starting and announcing that building seven had fallen 25 minutes before it
[11:18.280 --> 11:23.040]  did saying it had fallen in its own footprint three modern steel buildings
[11:23.040 --> 11:28.600]  falling on the same day never before happened anywhere in history hotels not
[11:28.600 --> 11:33.400]  even built as well have burned for days and not collapsed and then you have
[11:33.400 --> 11:37.240]  Barry Jennings the deputy head of emergency management inside the World
[11:37.240 --> 11:44.480]  Trade Center seven building and saying that you know their building hadn't been
[11:44.480 --> 11:48.160]  hit by a plane but there was a huge explosion blowing out several floors
[11:48.160 --> 11:55.160]  dead bodies everywhere that's on record and then he mysteriously died right as
[11:55.160 --> 11:59.560]  people talked about basically deposing him for lawsuits so that a new
[11:59.560 --> 12:05.240]  investigation could be forcibly opened so all of that is coming up but but what
[12:05.240 --> 12:14.200]  is the what is the latest big news and information coming out of NIST today
[12:14.200 --> 12:23.920]  exclusive uncovered 911 footage shows FBI director asking firefighters about
[12:23.920 --> 12:30.760]  secondary hits on WTC and its firefighters with their cameras at their
[12:30.760 --> 12:37.080]  side the FBI director of New York comes over and identifies himself as Barry
[12:37.080 --> 12:43.000]  Ma he comes over and identifies himself and the firefighters talk about bombs
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.640]  in the buildings and bombs going off after the planes had hit and he says
[12:47.640 --> 12:52.200]  yes I know I saw it I saw the whole side of the building blow out down on the
[12:52.200 --> 12:58.040]  bottom floor exactly what people like William Rodriguez the janitor said he
[12:58.040 --> 13:02.960]  saw and the media tried to demonize him when we have all these other witnesses
[13:02.960 --> 13:07.560]  and here's the problem haven't been turned on I have probably a hundred plus
[13:07.560 --> 13:12.440]  old newscast videos and eyewitnesses reporting bombs going off in Tower one
[13:12.440 --> 13:17.120]  two and seven the North Tower the South Tower and building seven the 47 story
[13:17.120 --> 13:21.280]  building that nobody talks about bigger than most the largest high rises in
[13:21.280 --> 13:25.040]  major cities I know bigger than any building in Austin where I live it'd be
[13:25.040 --> 13:30.520]  one of the biggest buildings in Dallas Texas the problem is we have all these
[13:30.520 --> 13:36.280]  new videos it's very hard to put all this on in a short sound bite fashion and
[13:36.280 --> 13:41.240]  that's why I wanted to get Ventura on because he's always on these shows and
[13:41.240 --> 13:44.560]  they try to interrupt him he only gets a minute or two to talk about it but what
[13:44.560 --> 13:48.920]  Jesse covers gets more attention than most and so by having him on and going
[13:48.920 --> 13:53.000]  over all this evidence with him we'll have a one-hour radio show slash video
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.320]  presentation that'll be uploaded later this afternoon at prisonplanet.tv for
[13:57.320 --> 14:04.200]  members that'll stream live today as well in fact IT folks this is so important
[14:04.200 --> 14:09.240]  today I know we can't afford it every day can we start streaming live on video
[14:09.240 --> 14:15.240]  for free and put a link up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com during
[14:15.240 --> 14:22.200]  the second hour only today we can do that let's in fact just so it's already
[14:22.200 --> 14:25.400]  streaming we know it's there make the link live as soon as you can whether it's
[14:25.400 --> 14:28.920]  five minutes from now or 20 minutes from now let's get that up on info wars.com
[14:28.920 --> 14:33.800]  and prisonplanet.com you'll go to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and it'll
[14:33.800 --> 14:40.000]  say live video link for 9-11 special report live video link or live
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.960]  special report live 9-11 video link report something like that we'll we'll
[14:44.960 --> 14:49.560]  get that up the next 10-15 minutes and send it to everyone you know if you're a
[14:49.560 --> 14:56.840]  radio listener or a prisonplanet.tv member it cost us $3,000 and we've got
[14:56.840 --> 15:00.120]  cheap bandwidth for most of you it'd be more than that but we buy so much it's
[15:00.120 --> 15:07.320]  it's more inexpensive to stream to over 200,000 people but the computer
[15:07.320 --> 15:12.760]  calculates it's over 150,000 individuals in the 27 hour live broadcast we did a
[15:12.760 --> 15:18.400]  few weeks ago for the money bomb that cost us over $3,000 and so I would do
[15:18.400 --> 15:23.720]  this every day I'd have a free video link for everyone every day if we had the
[15:23.720 --> 15:27.480]  funds but you can do the math if we streamed thousands of dollars a free
[15:27.480 --> 15:33.520]  video a day that would turn into what what's two times 300 shows or so a year
[15:33.520 --> 15:40.800]  you know six hundred nine hundred thousand dollars so we and that's a rough
[15:40.800 --> 15:45.400]  estimation so we can't afford this every day but this is so important and I want
[15:45.400 --> 15:49.320]  us to get out to the full internet now especially all of you folks that are on
[15:49.320 --> 15:54.160]  YouTube and the other video sites like Daily Motion and the rest of them we're
[15:54.160 --> 15:58.640]  gonna go live at prisonplanet.tv we're already live at prisonplanet.tv for
[15:58.640 --> 16:02.960]  members you can go there right now 15 cents a day and watch the show but I
[16:02.960 --> 16:08.440]  just now had this idea to put up a free link for everyone for the balance of the
[16:08.440 --> 16:13.400]  broadcast as soon as we can get it up because it's one thing to hear the FBI
[16:13.400 --> 16:16.920]  director of New York saying yes I saw the bomb you know blow out the side of
[16:16.920 --> 16:20.800]  the building and to hear firefighters talking about it it's another thing to
[16:20.800 --> 16:26.480]  see the video I mean a lot of the people trying to debunk 9-11 truth they
[16:26.480 --> 16:29.120]  just say these videos are fake even though the government admits they're
[16:29.120 --> 16:34.760]  real now that I see neocon operation still saying operation Northwoods isn't
[16:34.760 --> 16:40.320]  real even though ABC news associated press Baltimore Sun you can go to the
[16:40.320 --> 16:44.360]  National Archives online read operation Northwoods the plan to stop to stage
[16:44.360 --> 16:51.400]  9-11 style attacks and they still just say it isn't real so it's kind of like
[16:51.400 --> 16:55.600]  11 years ago I went to Operation Urban Warrior and other training drills and
[16:55.600 --> 17:00.680]  showed Marines on video training to take American citizens guns you've now seen
[17:00.680 --> 17:03.600]  it in Katrina you've now see them admitting on the news they're training
[17:03.600 --> 17:08.760]  for it 11 years later I got hundreds of calls emails and letters saying it was
[17:08.760 --> 17:14.680]  all fake that I had hired the Coronado amphibious aircraft carrier to land that
[17:14.680 --> 17:18.400]  I had hired hovercraft and warrior fighting vehicles land thousands of
[17:18.400 --> 17:22.840]  Marines trips from at least eight other nations the giant groups of role
[17:22.840 --> 17:27.440]  players they had to play the part of Americans people said I'd hired those
[17:27.440 --> 17:31.040]  role players because they got confused by the fact that the military had hired
[17:31.040 --> 17:36.120]  actors to play the part I mean it was incredible people cannot believe this
[17:36.120 --> 17:41.760]  stuff but by seeing it we may be able to make them understand we wish 9-11
[17:41.760 --> 17:46.240]  wasn't an inside job it's a lot less scary if a but if a rag tag groups of
[17:46.240 --> 17:50.560]  people you know wearing turbans on their heads had done this but I got the news
[17:50.560 --> 17:55.400]  flash for you they didn't and we're only focusing in on the bombs and the
[17:55.400 --> 17:58.840]  buildings because we know we relied to about that and if that's a lie of
[17:58.840 --> 18:04.240]  building sevens a lie everything is a lie if that's a lie everything's a lie
[18:04.240 --> 18:08.800]  and it is then you study every other area of 9-11 I mean here's Fox News a
[18:08.800 --> 18:13.560]  week and a half ago I was on man cowl this morning you know big we're kind of

[18:37.200 --> 18:41.080]  mean I mean you think I like this you think I am glad I've been proven right

[18:44.760 --> 18:49.160]  U.S. military bases I mean you think it's fun to interview the embassy head

[18:53.960 --> 18:56.520]  into the U.S. even though they were flagged as terrorists you think it's

[24:16.540 --> 24:21.360]  be joining us for a 9-11 breakdown of the latest incredible information New
[24:21.360 --> 24:25.680]  York FBI director on the day of 9-11 saying he witnessed one of the big
[24:25.680 --> 24:30.000]  bombs going off after the planes had hit other witnesses reporting bombs going
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.480]  off seconds before the planes hit this is all incredible and the government
[24:34.480 --> 24:40.080]  tried to suppress these videos and imagine as the Center for 9-11 studies
[24:40.080 --> 24:45.920]  tries to go through the five terabytes five terabytes even with high quality
[24:45.920 --> 24:52.800]  video five terabytes is is just depending on how you compress it 20 30 40 50
[24:52.800 --> 24:57.360]  hours these are cruddy compressed web videos they have reported that they have
[24:57.360 --> 25:01.600]  just thousands of them they're trying to go through and it's just and this is all
[25:01.600 --> 25:05.400]  the stuff NIST wouldn't release they released everything else and every
[25:05.400 --> 25:09.720]  video they pull up is bombs going off police talking about it firemen talking
[25:09.720 --> 25:15.040]  about it FBI people don't you know why they don't want this information out
[25:15.040 --> 25:19.000]  because they blew those towers all three of them right in front of all of us and
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.640]  they think we're stupid enough to bind to their official story okay my head is
[25:23.640 --> 25:28.640]  spinning here we've got all of Jack Conway's dirty tricks in Kentucky that
[25:28.640 --> 25:32.760]  are just off the chart and the media is ignoring the fact that his brother
[25:32.760 --> 25:37.160]  basically resigned as a deputy prosecutor in another county and then that the
[25:37.160 --> 25:40.880]  state Attorney General warned him through detectives in the department that
[25:40.880 --> 25:47.600]  he was being investigated for narcotics trafficking hmm a deputy prosecutor
[25:47.600 --> 25:51.520]  accused of narcotics use in trafficking and then his brother protecting him
[25:51.520 --> 25:56.960]  yeah and we're surprised he questions Rand Paul's religion and implies he's
[25:56.960 --> 26:00.440]  kidnapping women and they've got these clearly staged events with people
[26:00.440 --> 26:05.960]  scuffling and the media running with it but then when the big Democrat unions
[26:05.960 --> 26:11.280]  beat people up all over the country it gets ignored we've got that information
[26:11.280 --> 26:17.840]  we've got election fraud and electronic voting scams going on massively right
[26:17.840 --> 26:21.160]  now I don't want to get Bev Harris on the next few days a black box voting
[26:21.160 --> 26:26.400]  immediately that's a note to producers immediately as soon as we can about
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.040]  tomorrow preferably art and she's one of the best experts out there she's
[26:30.040 --> 26:33.800]  chronicling all this and I've got all the mainstream news on that here in
[26:33.800 --> 26:36.920]  front of me we've got Democrats defecting to the Republicans at the
[26:36.920 --> 26:40.800]  federal and state level all over the map they are in free fall they are
[26:40.800 --> 26:44.520]  running against their own president Obama now and I've seen Democratic
[26:44.520 --> 26:49.120]  operatives on MSNBC say this is a good thing Obama's unpopular they should be
[26:49.120 --> 26:53.760]  deceptive and claim that they don't like him to win I mean I mean and we still
[26:53.760 --> 27:00.240]  got what five six days seven days how many is it till Super Tuesday how many
[27:00.240 --> 27:05.760]  days is that five six days I mean I'll I'll expect for them to say Rand Paul
[27:05.760 --> 27:11.240]  murdered Kennedy tomorrow I mean they'll probably say he's got you know women in
[27:11.240 --> 27:15.000]  his basement I mean they'll probably say he killed the Easter Bunny they'll
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.120]  probably say he's a Chinese jet pilot from Pluto they'll probably say that you
[27:19.120 --> 27:24.000]  know he caused the banking crisis none of it true but they don't care that's
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.680]  how desperate these people are we're gonna get into that after the break but
[27:27.680 --> 27:34.240]  here's just the news today lawmakers may probe late military ballots that's out

[34:33.080 --> 34:36.680]  an article out later this evening about all these revelations it'll be the
[34:36.680 --> 34:40.200]  number one story on the web and we'll reach hundreds of thousands if not
[34:40.200 --> 34:46.360]  millions of new people so the search term is nine slash one one cover-up nine
[34:46.360 --> 34:52.960]  slash one one cover-up three words basically or you know the 911 and then
[34:52.960 --> 35:00.400]  the two words cover-up 911 cover-up is the Google search term another key weapon
[35:00.400 --> 35:10.080]  in the info war arsenal that we all use here together I spoke off and on for eight
[35:10.080 --> 35:15.200]  hours and a lot of it screaming out there on Sunday and Monday night in
[35:15.200 --> 35:20.280]  beautiful Santa Cruz with the great K SEO crowd it was amazing Aaron Dykes was
[35:20.280 --> 35:24.320]  with me he's been there the last five years for most of my speeches and he
[35:24.320 --> 35:27.760]  said it was the most powerful speech has ever seen me make there's some low
[35:27.760 --> 35:31.000]  quality versions of it out there on the web or pieces of it but we're gonna race
[35:31.000 --> 35:36.640]  this week to get much of the eight hours of speeches I gave Richard Mack just
[35:36.640 --> 35:40.240]  showed up because he was in the area Joe Bannister and post that at prison
[35:40.240 --> 35:46.360]  planet dot TV for viewers in fact I may even take part of the first speech I
[35:46.360 --> 35:49.200]  think was the more powerful the second was powerful as well but a little bit
[35:49.200 --> 35:56.360]  more subdued and play part of that on Friday or even on the Sunday radio slash
[35:56.360 --> 36:01.040]  TV transmission now before I get into all the election fraud going into this
[36:01.040 --> 36:07.400]  oh ten election that's coming out of the demonization in ultra high gear as
[36:07.400 --> 36:11.320]  they head towards the finish line here with Rand Paul depending on the pole
[36:11.320 --> 36:16.360]  five to nine points ahead he's lost a little bit of his lead because some
[36:16.360 --> 36:20.000]  people are stupid and believe the incredible demonization that's going on
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.840]  so this is very very close with most polls with a margin of error to three to
[36:23.840 --> 36:27.680]  five points but in every poll even with a margin of error against him he's two to
[36:27.680 --> 36:31.640]  three points ahead some polls five points ahead with margin of error added in
[36:31.640 --> 36:38.880]  for the enemy Jack Conway so that is all coming up as well but I do just want to
[36:38.880 --> 36:43.040]  ask listeners to put nine slash one one one cover up into Google over and over
[36:43.040 --> 36:49.240]  again to make that the number one search term today I just want to get plugs out

[39:02.960 --> 39:07.120]  just looking at the control demolitions today and this NIST suit with these
[39:07.120 --> 39:10.800]  thousands of videos released and I just imagine what's already come out what is
[39:10.800 --> 39:16.640]  going to be coming out okay I want to recap this before I get into the new
[39:16.640 --> 39:19.880]  information on the election of what we just briefly covered in the last segment
[39:19.880 --> 39:24.320]  lawmakers made probe late military battle it's Springfield Illinois and I'm
[39:24.320 --> 39:29.120]  seeing these reports all over the country Florida California New York State
[39:29.120 --> 39:34.000]  it's always the same thing we lost your ballots your absentee ballots if you're
[39:34.000 --> 39:42.640]  overseas in 60 plus countries sorry and it just continues from there Illinois
[39:42.640 --> 39:46.320]  may not be finished investigating those late military ballots members of the
[39:46.320 --> 39:50.560]  House of Election Committee so they're considering formal hearings in to how
[39:50.560 --> 39:56.000]  the 36 counties miss the deadline to send ballots they didn't even send them
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.280]  and then they've got the other problem of getting them and losing them and not
[39:58.280 --> 40:01.600]  counting them so there's a bunch of problems to deployed service when another
[40:01.600 --> 40:06.440]  overseas voters state rep Dan Brady of Bloomington said there is clearly
[40:06.440 --> 40:10.040]  something wrong when one-third of local election officials missed a federal
[40:10.040 --> 40:16.280]  deadline to ensure soldiers and sailors have their votes counted at least let's
[40:16.280 --> 40:19.480]  have some kind of inquiry and let's review find out what happened for sure
[40:19.480 --> 40:22.560]  and then take steps to make sure it doesn't happen in the future we hear
[40:22.560 --> 40:27.440]  this every election every two years when they lose the ballots or don't deliver
[40:27.440 --> 40:31.280]  the ballots or disqualify the ballots that oh let's have an investigation and
[40:31.280 --> 40:35.920]  then it gets worse each time and it's the same thing with the electronic
[40:35.920 --> 40:42.160]  voting machines this is Fox 5 Vegas County says touch screens are sensitive
[40:42.160 --> 40:46.680]  and then they go and talk to people it's the same problems over a hundred and
[40:46.680 --> 40:51.720]  sixty thousand people that vote early in Clark County have been reporting to the
[40:51.720 --> 40:58.760]  media that they're not allowed to click share an angle against Harry Reid in the
[40:58.760 --> 41:02.960]  Senate race so it doesn't matter if Harry reads five to ten points spending on
[41:02.960 --> 41:07.640]  which poll you look at will he magically win and then will there be an
[41:07.640 --> 41:12.560]  investigation it's incredible the system is scared of real constitutional is
[41:12.560 --> 41:16.280]  getting elected when you see election fraud when you see the media claiming
[41:16.280 --> 41:20.920]  that people are kidnapping women and hate black people when you see stuff like
[41:20.920 --> 41:28.560]  that you better know they're good but then meanwhile Jack Conway very serious
[41:28.560 --> 41:32.080]  corruption cover-up that's been proven I don't know the allegations of drug
[41:32.080 --> 41:37.280]  trafficking are true but the police blocked it and worked with the attorney
[41:37.280 --> 41:44.480]  general whose brother whose baby brother is and this is in the Kentucky
[41:44.480 --> 41:49.760]  newspapers but it's not on Kentucky TV that I've seen I've done searches I've
[41:49.760 --> 41:55.040]  done web searches there's a couple news articles a big detailed five page article
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.160]  that I read as I was getting on the airplane at 7 o'clock on the morning
[41:59.160 --> 42:02.840]  yesterday stuck on the tarmac for 20 minutes I read the whole five page
[42:02.840 --> 42:07.480]  report it's detailed it's powerful it should have a more powerful headline
[42:07.480 --> 42:11.280]  though it's got a weak headline you don't find the last two pages what Conway
[42:11.280 --> 42:16.800]  admittedly did for his brother so that's all going on but but when you get
[42:16.800 --> 42:23.400]  some real corruption true absconding an investigation true obstruction of
[42:23.400 --> 42:29.640]  justice nothing happens because he's the attorney general and notice how ran in
[42:29.640 --> 42:33.600]  the primary had to run against the head of elections the people pointed out the
[42:33.600 --> 42:37.920]  corruption there so he's still one handling in the primary about what more
[42:37.920 --> 42:42.320]  than 10 points this time it's the attorney general he's running against but
[42:42.320 --> 42:45.640]  lawmakers may probe late military ballots you know about that voter reports
[42:45.640 --> 42:51.520]  problems with ballot machines I mean this is just coming in from all over the
[42:51.520 --> 42:55.480]  country Nevada voting machines automatically check Harry Reid's name
[42:55.480 --> 43:00.320]  voting machine technicians or SEI you members so the people running the
[43:00.320 --> 43:04.320]  voting machines are members of SEI you the mega union that's openly
[43:04.320 --> 43:08.600]  communistic and their members have been caught beating people up in Missouri
[43:08.600 --> 43:12.440]  Florida you name it and they never get in trouble and it never becomes a
[43:12.440 --> 43:16.440]  national news story groups of thugs beating people bloody but then a
[43:16.440 --> 43:21.280]  supposed Rand Paul supporter kind of steps on a woman's shoulder cop style to
[43:21.280 --> 43:24.880]  keep her keep her down on the ground he didn't I'm not defending what he did but
[43:24.880 --> 43:28.800]  you can see he lightly puts his foot on her to hold her down he didn't jump on
[43:28.800 --> 43:33.520]  her like the cops would but the point is and and what they did to her was wrong
[43:33.520 --> 43:37.480]  but they thought they see a woman with a fake wig looking crazy running towards
[43:37.480 --> 43:41.200]  Rand Paul when he gets out of his car they were scared that maybe she was
[43:41.200 --> 43:44.200]  gonna do something and that's what they said but once they got her to the ground
[43:44.200 --> 43:47.080]  they this guy didn't need to put his foot on her head and I don't know if this
[43:47.080 --> 43:51.960]  was staged but move on.org I mean George Soros openly funds them you you've
[43:51.960 --> 43:56.560]  had in Kentucky three separate cases in the last two months of Jack Conway
[43:56.560 --> 44:01.040]  supporters who worked for him and and volunteer for his campaign on record
[44:01.040 --> 44:06.560]  dressed up in clownish outfits saying racist things so if you've been caught
[44:06.560 --> 44:11.360]  over and over doing something you got to look at him doing it again but I don't
[44:11.360 --> 44:15.280]  know it looks staged to me but regardless it's being hyped up it's all
[44:15.280 --> 44:21.680]  over ABC CBS NBC they're acting like it is the end of the world that this lady
[44:21.680 --> 44:25.440]  wouldn't stop rushing towards Rand Paul so they grabbed her she fought you can
[44:25.440 --> 44:29.880]  see her smiling while it's happening she is really pleased she's getting what she
[44:29.880 --> 44:34.120]  wants the camera with one of her people is on her and then she gets on the
[44:34.120 --> 44:41.640]  ground they wrestle her down with limited force and boom boom this guy puts
[44:41.640 --> 44:48.480]  his foot on her shoulder okay so the issue is my gut tells me it's staged
[44:48.480 --> 44:54.400]  either well I'm a point as we got to move forward because there's so much so
[44:54.400 --> 44:57.880]  much going on here but Nevada voting machines automatically checked Harry
[44:57.880 --> 45:02.760]  Reid's name voting machine technicians are SEIU members Clark County is where
[45:02.760 --> 45:05.520]  three-quarters of Nevada's residents live and we're Senate Majority Leader
[45:05.520 --> 45:10.840]  Harry Reid's son Rory is a county commissioner Rory is also a Democratic
[45:10.840 --> 45:14.560]  candidate for governor since early voting started there have been credible
[45:14.560 --> 45:18.440]  reports that voting machines in Clark County Nevada are automatically checking
[45:18.440 --> 45:23.440]  Harry Reid's name on the ballot and then it goes through all the evidence but
[45:23.440 --> 45:27.520]  don't worry Obama is rallying the illegal aliens to vote all over the
[45:27.520 --> 45:30.840]  Southwest saying basically the Republicans are their enemies and
[45:30.840 --> 45:35.040]  racists so you've got the president working with a foreign group of people
[45:35.040 --> 45:39.720]  to have them illegally vote but you'd say well don't worry they've got to show
[45:39.720 --> 45:44.600]  their driver's license that they're citizen no they don't know they don't
[45:44.600 --> 45:54.920]  Arizona voter ID law overturned politico.com a six-year-old Arizona law
[45:54.920 --> 45:58.040]  requiring that voters prove their citizenship in order to register to
[45:58.040 --> 46:02.720]  vote was struck down Tuesday the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
[46:02.720 --> 46:05.280]  portion of the law and notice all of the country they give you legal driver's
[46:05.280 --> 46:08.680]  license anyways that voters present identification before casting their
[46:08.680 --> 46:12.920]  ballot but part of a proposition passed on 04 and concerns illegal immigrants
[46:12.920 --> 46:16.640]  may try to vote in the state and federal elections opponents the law argue it
[46:16.640 --> 46:19.160]  would lead to thousands of residents being turned away at their polling
[46:19.160 --> 46:21.640]  places and there's all these other articles about Democratic Party
[46:21.640 --> 46:26.560]  operatives admittedly being caught on tape at events talking about vote vote
[46:26.560 --> 46:33.160]  early vote often yes we're engaged in fraud and it goes on to say that they'd
[46:33.160 --> 46:39.560]  have to show a driver's license but not any more no sir you don't have to show
[46:39.560 --> 46:45.580]  a driver's license any more no you don't of course in Mexico they shoot
[46:45.580 --> 46:49.000]  illegals coming across their southern border from Guatemala I think that's a
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.920]  bad thing to do but there's no weeping and wailing of gnashing of teeth about
[46:52.920 --> 46:56.800]  what's happening to Central and South Americans no there's no weeping and
[46:56.800 --> 47:00.000]  wailing of gnashing of teeth whenever citizens get killed in the Texas border
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.840]  trying to ride around on a jet ski but oh my gosh the illegal aliens they need
[47:04.840 --> 47:09.240]  to vote and meanies are trying to stop them this is the globalist North
[47:09.240 --> 47:15.880]  American Union SPP takeover this is how they're doing it okay continuing here
[47:15.880 --> 47:22.400]  with election news that I have here in front of me Lieutenant Governor Scott
[47:22.400 --> 47:27.240]  and gel switches political parties says Obama does not represent him and is
[47:27.240 --> 47:32.280]  becoming a Republican Democrats are now running as being anti-Obama anti-Obama
[47:32.280 --> 47:36.600]  health care Democratic candidate I voted for John McCain Democratic candidate
[47:36.600 --> 47:40.120]  Mississippi has said he voted for Republican John McCain in the election
[47:40.120 --> 47:46.400]  the most extreme example the current midterm campaign of an obstensible ally
[47:46.400 --> 47:51.560]  of a rock Obama districts themselves from the president here's another one
[47:51.560 --> 47:55.480]  Obama administration to halt invisible fence first they built a fence that
[47:55.480 --> 47:58.640]  didn't work never really built the whole thing now they're halting it
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.920]  Obama tells Latino voters he can't pass immigration reform alone he means illegal
[48:03.920 --> 48:11.240]  alien voters and it just continues on from that point now looking at the
[48:11.240 --> 48:19.720]  Kentucky situation here is the article that you want to read it is five pages
[48:19.720 --> 48:25.720]  long we linked a boy posted a boil down from the daily poll.com up at info
[48:25.720 --> 48:32.360]  wars.com and prison planet.com LMPD probes detectives who tipped off
[48:32.360 --> 48:37.600]  prosecutor under investigation now when you read the article you don't find out
[48:37.600 --> 48:46.840]  till a page in that it's Jack Conway's brother who was the assistant or deputy
[48:46.840 --> 48:52.320]  prosecutor in Jefferson County you don't learn that till page two it's a good
[48:52.320 --> 49:01.600]  report but it should be the headline should be Jack Conway gets inside info
[49:01.600 --> 49:08.200]  warns brother about drug rape and you learn that Conway the attorney general
[49:08.200 --> 49:12.920]  this is the top cop of Kentucky gets word that if this is all in the article
[49:12.920 --> 49:19.640]  five pages long he learns that his brother that the number two cop in his
[49:19.640 --> 49:27.200]  county prosecutor he learns that Conway from detectives that illegally told him
[49:27.200 --> 49:33.800]  at meetings this has now been admitted Conway admits this told them that your
[49:33.800 --> 49:38.760]  brother there is an investigation for narcotics trafficking and usage and we
[49:38.760 --> 49:43.040]  have this from directly from inside someone that was in his home and directly
[49:43.040 --> 49:48.520]  from sources and they're going to raid him and then the detectives went
[49:48.520 --> 49:54.800]  separately two of them no three excuse me and met with Conway the attorney
[49:54.800 --> 49:59.560]  general and his brother and said the raid is coming in two days and they're
[49:59.560 --> 50:03.840]  all in here saying well I thought he was innocent so I told him the drug raid
[50:03.840 --> 50:10.240]  was coming and of course when they had the raid Conway the brother of the
[50:10.240 --> 50:15.160]  attorney general who himself is a prosecutor first lied when it came out
[50:15.160 --> 50:18.120]  because other cops blew the whistle other detectives blew the whistle they're
[50:18.120 --> 50:22.480]  like we're not gonna be part of this and it's all in the article word for word
[50:22.480 --> 50:28.280]  I mean they're being interviewed by the newspaper that they lied and said we
[50:28.280 --> 50:34.880]  didn't warn Conway's brother I mean you look here's the deal even if he didn't
[50:34.880 --> 50:39.440]  have drugs in his house and now we'll never know even if he's not a narcotics
[50:39.440 --> 50:44.960]  trafficker even if that's not the case and that's why prosecutors get so
[50:44.960 --> 50:47.120]  corrupt as they're always dealing with drug dealers a lot of times they make a
[50:47.120 --> 50:51.760]  deal their dealer says 100,000 you let me off most people are corrupt and do it
[50:51.760 --> 50:56.480]  but the issue is crimes have now been committed of inside job cover-ups

[55:08.640 --> 55:14.320]  brother of the attorney general or that the brother the attorney general had
[55:14.320 --> 55:19.120]  met with the police met with the detectives and then they held off the
[55:19.120 --> 55:25.200]  raid and said we're coming in two days and another detective's quoted is
[55:25.200 --> 55:28.840]  saying whatever you're doing you better get cleaned up and get ready I mean this
[55:28.840 --> 55:34.360]  is completely illegal there is not a grand jury in the country if they're not
[55:34.360 --> 55:40.480]  corrupt that would not indict the the attorney general that would not indict
[55:40.480 --> 55:45.960]  his brother Matt Conway that would not indict at least two of these three
[55:45.960 --> 55:55.680]  detectives imagine jack Conway in Kentucky is going after Rand Paul claiming
[55:55.680 --> 56:01.880]  he kidnaps women not true claiming that he is is is a racist not true that he's
[56:01.880 --> 56:07.640]  against the civil rights act not true all of that disproven okay meanwhile for
[56:07.640 --> 56:12.440]  three days it has been in the two biggest papers in Kentucky that the deputy
[56:12.440 --> 56:16.560]  prosecutor Matt Conway was under investigation for narcotics trafficking
[56:16.560 --> 56:21.920]  and usage and his brother finds out about it from the police has secret
[56:21.920 --> 56:25.960]  meetings with them they warn him to get ready for the raid two days later then
[56:25.960 --> 56:29.720]  they lie and say they didn't warn him and didn't have prior knowledge now they
[56:29.720 --> 56:35.280]  admit they lied they're quoted in the article is saying I'm sorry I lied you've
[56:35.280 --> 56:39.640]  got the top cop of the state of Kentucky running for Senate against Rand Paul is
[56:39.640 --> 56:45.040]  this on CBS news is this on NBC is this on Fox News it's nowhere except in the
[56:45.040 --> 56:49.840]  local news and it's barely even being reported there the headline should say
[56:49.840 --> 56:53.280]  will there be criminal indictments of the attorney general and his brother the
[56:53.280 --> 56:58.760]  prosecutor they've absconded they've had obstruction of justice they've lied to
[56:58.760 --> 57:02.040]  other investigators when they first came to them it's all admitted where they
[57:02.040 --> 57:06.400]  lied and said no no we didn't get a warning we didn't warn Matt Conway the
[57:06.400 --> 57:12.080]  brother Conway told investigators he had tried to protect Russ because I just
[57:12.080 --> 57:17.880]  didn't want to see him lose his job over this and it was foolish I'm sorry it's
[57:17.880 --> 57:22.200]  wrong and you know I'm paying for it now the record show these are from the
[57:22.200 --> 57:28.200]  police reports they're caught red-handed covering up a narcotics investigation
[57:28.200 --> 57:33.240]  of his brother who's a prosecutor and he is the attorney general but instead
[57:33.240 --> 57:36.760]  there's a fight where a Rand Paul supporter gets hurt a woman in a wig
[57:36.760 --> 57:41.480]  rushes Rand Paul they tackle her one guy puts his foot on her head and that's
[57:41.480 --> 57:45.680]  all over the news today one of the top stories in the country oh we better not
[57:45.680 --> 57:49.800]  vote for Rand Paul who's five to ten points ahead we better vote for Jack
[57:49.800 --> 57:54.280]  Conway meanwhile he's covered up an narcotics investigation dealing
[57:54.280 --> 57:59.160]  directly with his brother who's another prosecutor now we've got to get this
[57:59.160 --> 58:03.240]  story out that maybe we should write an article about it and call it Jack Conway
[58:03.240 --> 58:10.440]  narcotics cover-up and make that a top search term Jack Conway cover-up that

[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:01.920]  director Barry Ma and we've got that NIST tried to block this in the last nine
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:07.880]  years finally the international journal of 9-11 studies sued because they were
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.880]  blocking their four-year request for the open records and got five terabytes of
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:17.160]  videos they're coming out every day with these videos talking about bombs in the
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:21.040]  buildings firefighters witnesses the bombs going off explosions the
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:26.320]  explosions before seven falls at 5 25 in the afternoon and governor Jesse
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.160]  Ventura is here with us I before I introduce him I want to play this clip
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.320]  where he's about to go live on Fox and they shot video of this and aired it of
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.680]  Ventura getting in the guy's face his name is Eric Boling and saying look they
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:44.400]  staged Gulf of Tonkin they staged this too here's Governor Ventura the Gulf of
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:50.040]  Tonkin incident never happened well 58,000 of my generation died and over
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.880]  something that was a lie and I didn't I didn't touch that that's not where I was
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:59.960]  going well that exchange took place after my interview with Jesse Ventura
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.080]  that was just a preview now here's the entire interview with the shy guy the
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.240]  retiring former wrestler former guy okay gov thank you for joining us I know
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.640]  you're basically done with doing media for the TV show but 9-11's important so
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:18.280]  you're here well no I'm not done yet you know we had to delay one week because we
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.440]  didn't want to go cut the head with the New York Yankees because everybody knows
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:28.320]  that what's the most important thing to watch out there I guess is sports and so
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.000]  they showed just a montage of other shows so it's almost this Friday is like a
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.400]  new premiere again and we'll be kicking off with area 51 and then we'll
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:42.880]  progress forward with the remaining six or seven shows. Governor and before you
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.680]  leave us we'll talk about some of the shows coming up with conspiracy theory
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.520]  or hit show and the great ratings it's getting show people will have a hunger
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:54.160]  for the truth you have always questioned the official story of 9-11 and as the
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.600]  year Alex I didn't always question it I'm in the last few years yeah my big
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:03.480]  give my background on it quickly I I believed it like everyone else you know
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:08.400]  I felt that you know we were also stunned and we were frozen and we go almost
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:13.960]  into a automated mode almost and you know everything we were being told and
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:19.920]  said then and I went along with it didn't really my antenna didn't truly
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:25.480]  spike and you know pressure being a governor you're busy you don't have
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.960]  time to be investigating things and looking at stuff like that you got to
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:34.360]  take care of your state and what caused it for me was right after I got out of
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:39.360]  office when George Bush announced we were going to invade Iraq and that's
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:45.000]  when I sat back and I went Iraq I mean they told us these 19 guys attacked us
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.120]  and there wasn't one Iraqi amongst them there was no ties that anyone knew to
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.560]  Saddam Hussein and Iraq and so it was at that point that I stepped back and said
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.640]  wait a minute what's the big picture here and it was at that point that my
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.560]  doubts started really to enter in and then it was a few months later that I
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:08.800]  happened my son kept badgering me to watch this thing on the internet called
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:13.520]  loose change and then I watched that and that's when I started to tear it all
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.640]  apart and started focusing on it starting truly trying to use what resources I
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:24.280]  have to learn the truth because I'm a sucker for the truth and I just am tired
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.240]  you know after the Gulf of Tonkin incident and you read about all these
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.200]  things in our history and you start doubting well can any of this even be
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:37.800]  true because you know when mainstream media reports something is being
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.760]  factual in my lifetime I've been able to see that no that's not true that they

[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.760]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:08.520]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:13.040]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.600]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:21.040]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:25.320]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:29.080]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:33.200]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:37.160]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.960]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:05.360]  this is communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:17.800]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:23.480]  we are live my friends Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura host of the hit TV
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:28.560]  show conspiracy theory premiering a new episode coming up this Friday evening on
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.360]  true TV joins us up for five minutes into the next hour we've got a lot of
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:39.320]  information 11 different video audio clips we're gonna be playing and so
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.000]  folks can actually see this who are radio listeners we're shooting video of
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.280]  all this live you can go to prisonplanet.com and the top featured story
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:52.320]  is special 911 cover-up simulcast with Jesse Ventura and we're doing two
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:58.000]  different Google number one search terms today 9-1-1 cover-up that you put into
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.440]  Google over and over again and Conway cover-up dealing with the narcotics
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:07.080]  investigation of his brother who's also in law enforcement a cover-up that's
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.440]  admitted to that and so we're going to be really exposing all of this today and
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:15.040]  this is key ahead of this Kentucky election now some stations don't carry
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.720]  the last the first five minutes the governor and I were discussing his
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:23.480]  awakening in the last you know six seven years the lies about WMD's the
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:29.520]  Gulf of Tonkin being declassified shortly after in 2004 really really adding
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:33.840]  to his concern about being lied to and we were getting up to loose change and
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:37.200]  all the footage of the bombs going off and the rest of it but it's great to
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.520]  have governor Ventura here because when he's on national television he's got
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.400]  five to ten minutes and they'll attack him for this and he always says
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:48.060]  Gulf of Tonkin was a lie look at building seven you know I was in
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:52.280]  demolitions UDT that's what founded the SEALs you can watch that on the history
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.160]  channel in World War two the underwater demolition teams you know training
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:59.780]  explosives that was you know the first group that the SEALs grew out of he's
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:03.600]  an expert in that and he says this is a load of baloney so in your own words
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:08.280]  continue with your awakening your questions and then it's great to have
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.880]  you here now not just in a sound bite because we're gonna go over the group
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.720]  that sued and got this footage that the government nixed didn't want the people
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.120]  to see and now we know why they didn't want us to see this because here's the
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:27.160]  headline at prisonplanet.com exclusive uncovered 9-1-1 footage shows FBI
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:31.800]  director of New York asking firefighters about secondary hits and saying he
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.600]  agreed he saw the explosions in the bottom floors and we've got a bunch of
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:39.160]  other videos NIST suppressed they didn't suppress stuff that didn't matter they
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.040]  wouldn't release this stuff because it's firefighters police all of them so we
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.960]  got to get out of here there could be bombs in other buildings it's bombs it's
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:50.040]  bombs so that's coming up and with the governor talking about it and challenging
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:54.080]  the media he said he was gonna do today to look at the info and to be honest
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:58.080]  governor Ventura thank you for joining us thanks Alex always a pleasure to join
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.440]  you okay so recapping what you were getting into in the short segment
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:05.640]  you're awakening to 9-11 and and the fact that I've heard you talk about you
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:10.120]  know more and more serious questions you've got that's pretty bold
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:15.440]  well Alex when you start truly looking at it and you start asking questions and
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.480]  you start looking at things like the first thing you always want to judge
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:25.000]  if governments involved in any any type of misbehavior or conspiracy is we're
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.680]  standard operating procedures violated did anything go from the norm because
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:35.880]  military and government runs on standard operating procedures they have sets of
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.520]  procedures that they follow whenever anything happens and when you start
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:45.720]  delving into 9-11 you start seeing that 9-11 procedures were violated and then
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:50.320]  you start digging in the more documents one of one of the documents that really
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:56.120]  troubles me the most is the fact that on June 1st of 2001 how they changed the
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:01.000]  NORAD interception that up until that point in time it was left to base
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.600]  commanders to make the call if the FAA called them with a problem in the air
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:11.440]  they had the ability to scramble airplanes and send them up well June 1st of
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.080]  that year that was changed by an executive order by George Bush and now any
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:19.720]  planes that were scrambled had to be cleared through the Department of
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:24.240]  Defense well why this change in procedure what would be the reasoning
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.560]  behind that you know the old way was working fine and people don't realize
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:34.520]  that jets get scrambled much more often than they know you know it goes on you
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:40.560]  know a weekly daily sometimes occurrence it happens a lot and yet on that day
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:46.760]  everything was just so far up in our multi-billion dollar air defense system
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:52.280]  they behaved like there was a standout and then of course you then look at
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:58.120]  situations I started watching how I've performed a 9-11 Commission the president
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:02.560]  of the administration totally blocked it there was gonna be no investigation of
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:07.800]  9-11 if the government had their way they weren't gonna investigate anything
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:12.800]  they told us what they their version of what happened and we're expected to
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:18.920]  solely believe that no matter what evidence then surfaces and so you look
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.800]  at the fact that they didn't want a commission to be formed and when pressure
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:28.280]  came from the families and and they demanded the commission well who is the
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:34.200]  first person they come up with to run it Henry Kissinger well there was outcry
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:39.680]  and outrage over that because of all of his contacts and everything he's into so
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:44.040]  they had to remove him and then they came up with keen and the other guy and
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:48.960]  and you know then you looked at it from a logical point of view did they really
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:54.180]  and truly want to investigate what when you learn that they spent a hundred
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:59.200]  million dollars to investigate whitewater a hundred million we're
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.720]  ultimately in the end I guess they learned the president cheated on his
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:07.000]  wife maybe there's more to it maybe not but the point I'm getting to is the
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.840]  hundred million and then initially for the murder of 3,000 people at 9-11 they
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:20.160]  allocate four million four now it ended up I think going to 12 or 13 million in
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:25.640]  the end but that alone should cause you to say there wasn't a real investigation
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:30.080]  going to be done here you know when they're gonna spend money like that and
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.240]  on our show we talk we actually get caught to one of the one a pretty main
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.960]  person that functioned in a certain department of the 9-11 Commission and
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.040]  you know when they start saying they were put under pressure to move quickly
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:49.640]  and anything that they that they all didn't uniformly agree on was left out
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:55.560]  so that the whole report had to be a slam dunk well governor back then Alex
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.880]  you go to other things like we're a country that's supposed to be a rule of
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:04.400]  law we're supposed to follow that this was murder they've had nine years now to
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.400]  indict bin Laden why hasn't that been done that's the procedure yet they're
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:15.360]  creating all this other stuff like all the handling with the military no you
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:21.120]  wait a minute here Al Qaeda and bin Laden all them are not a military they
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:27.360]  don't represent a country they represent a band of outlaws out there much like
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:31.320]  yes if you wanted to say like the hell's angels you know using something that
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:35.400]  there's groups of them throughout the world they get established in certain
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:40.200]  countries where they can get away with what they do but the point of the matter
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.840]  is this was a murder that took place Alex and you have to go through procedures
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:49.240]  that have happened inside the United States in Manhattan why hasn't he been
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:54.440]  indicted and then you go to the fact that you go to the FBI website and you
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:16:00.360]  pull up bin Laden and in his resume it doesn't even include 9-11 because then
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:05.920]  the FBI's final response to that is well we don't have enough evidence then you
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:11.080]  start looking at who's profited from all this stuff that's going on who because
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:16.240]  whenever things like this happen there are profiteers that things are happen
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:21.840]  for a reason and the reason is generally money power and all of that so who
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:26.800]  profited the most I go with the military industrial we're now in two
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:31.960]  layers because of 9-11 they've batted down the hatch on our country and taken
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:37.840]  our freedoms away all over this event that there's so many so much evidence
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.440]  that says the possibility that this turns out to be a false flag operation
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:47.480]  just like the Gulf of Tonkin just like when they said the Japanese attacked the
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:52.200]  people in China to start off there in the world war two just like the Rook's dog
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:57.160]  fired and what becomes so frustrating about it Alex is that these are not new
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:02.000]  ideas and just because other countries did them and our own country has done
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.960]  them before why would we suddenly now turn a blind eye to really understanding
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:14.240]  history and seeing that the majority of all wars are complete setups unbelievably
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.800]  well said and I want you to continue on a backup though what governor Jesse
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:22.120]  Ventura said because he's being very conservative and it's much worse than he
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:26.720]  just said it is declassified it's in my films it's on the Pentagon's website
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:32.600]  that two months before 9-11 Dick Cheney changed the procedure that had been in
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:37.440]  place since 1957 of the automatic default of the admirals and generals in
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:42.560]  NORAD to shoot down a plane after it didn't follow orders over a populated
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:49.320]  area and he took the order and said only Dick Cheney the president or Rumsfeld
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:55.040]  could give that order and then two weeks after 9-11 he rescinded the order and
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:59.200]  it's on the government letterhead with the Pentagon symbol Dick Cheney's order
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:06.920]  to Rumsfeld then you talked about some of the other things that happened and
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:14.360]  you talked about the fact that they you haven't indicted bin Laden and I mean if
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:18.080]  they've got the supposed proof they should indict and put it on record but I
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.920]  wanted to bring this up before we get into other reasons you question 9-11 and
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:25.720]  the latest control demolition info in these clips these new big developments
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.000]  that I want to get your take on here's Fox News it was also an AP in other places
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.160]  but here's Fox News October 20th so this is seven days ago exclusive Al Qaeda
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:42.040]  leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11 and war alalaki may be the
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:45.880]  first American on the CIA's killer capture list but he was also a lunch
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.640]  guest of the military brass at the Pentagon within months of September 11th
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.960]  it has now been declassified documents exclusively obtained by Fox News
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.160]  including an FBI interview conducted at the Fort Hood shooting in November state
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.000]  that and war alalaki was taken to the Pentagon as part of a military outreach
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.120]  he met with the secretary of the army and others now this is two months after
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:13.280]  he was the number three guy of Al Qaeda on the news then you've got the hijackers
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:18.160]  trained at US military bases Newsweek AP you've got and more alalaki on record
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.320]  running the Fort Hood shooter and the government's blocked those documents
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:25.000]  running the Christmas Day underwear bomber they block that running the
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.960]  Times Square bomber they block that and in the case of the underwear bomber I
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.880]  had Kurt Haskell and other witnesses who were on the plane from Amsterdam here
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.960]  they said a sharp dressed guy in a suit came up and got this guy who looked
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:45.280]  drug mutalib on the plane governor this is all on record and then there was a
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.160]  pop and all this happened and they told us to shut up about it then the
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:52.120]  government said he was a liar then it came out that the state department
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:56.880]  deputy head the head of the visas mr. Kennedy said I was told by an unnamed
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:01.440]  u.s. intelligence agency to help him get on the plane now governor you got
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.960]  anwar alalaki who runs all these operations all these patsies and he is
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:09.720]  on record two months after he's on the news as the number three of Al Qaeda
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:14.520]  carrying out 9-11 and he is at the Pentagon in a cloak what does that sound
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:19.920]  like only seven days ago that's why you missed it
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:26.880]  no kidding see that's all new to me that's interesting about this stuff as
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:31.880]  as the puzzle gets put together more pieces start to assemble and more
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:36.720]  information comes forward all the time I mean at what point are the American
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:40.360]  people gonna say enough is enough you know another thing I want to touch on
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:44.640]  to Alex is the fact that you know you've got the people out there like 9-11
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.440]  truth that is now multiplied in the many areas you've got our detection
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.960]  engineers you've got airline pilots and the thing people need to understand about
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:59.160]  that is the mainstream media portrays 9-11 truthers as being some fringe
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:04.320]  element some wild crazy liberals or whatever they are out there you know
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:09.360]  leftover hippies whatever they may say and they don't realize that the 9-11
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.720]  truth movement the great majority of it is professionals these are not people
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:18.720]  that are crazies they're not people that in fact they're courageous because
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:22.400]  they're putting the professional integrity on the line to ask the
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:26.680]  questions by the way did I tell you that I had my showdown with Ariana
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:30.520]  Huffington in the dressing room no I didn't know that oh yeah when I was
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:35.520]  out doing that the show tour Ariana was there for something and here and I had
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:38.680]  it out pretty good in the dressing room where I questioned and wanted to know
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:44.320]  why she practiced censorship on me and of course she she got a little huffy at
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.200]  the end and walked out wouldn't talk to me anymore but she still stands by that
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:52.600]  they don't do conspiracy theories and I explained what I was writing about was
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:56.720]  not a theory of anything it was an event that took place in San Francisco or
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:01.000]  thousands of architects and engineers signed a petition demanding a new
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.640]  investigation that's not a conspiracy theory that's an event that took place
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:10.520]  but she would hear none of it and so we of course left each other on pretty bad
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:15.360]  terms I would guess I mean not bad terms to where we never speak again but she
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:20.000]  clearly knows that I will never write for her censoring Huffington post anymore
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.760]  well George Starles doesn't like the truth coming out he's gotten a lot of
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:25.520]  power out of what's happened in the shift in this country as well just to
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:28.680]  back you up let me mention a few of the people that have gone public the number
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:33.960]  three man in the Japanese government went public on this show the former
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:39.680]  president of and this is all over BBC Reuters but not in the US two years ago
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:45.760]  the former president of Italy he also happened to be the former head of their
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:50.840]  CIA and he said that he knew in 1980 our government was staging bombings to
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:54.720]  blame the left and that's now been declassified Operation Gladio over a
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.080]  hundred bombings the former German defense minister has been on this show
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:02.480]  the former head of German intelligence has been on this show to say 9-11's an
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:08.080]  inside job and break down the evidence we have literally now one of the most
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:13.960]  powerful people in the Labor Party of Australia went public last week and said
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.680]  it was an inside job he happens to be an engineer and they told him how dare you
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:21.400]  and he said look I'm not a coward and you cowards don't run things anymore and
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.960]  I'm not going to retract what I said and he went over building seven so
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.640]  something's happening we're seeing a second or third wave of 9-11 truth the
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:32.880]  biggest ever I thought it would subdue after Bush left it's gotten bigger
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:38.480]  governor I mean well well it should because the most policies are still
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:44.000]  in place aren't they yes nothing has changed we're still fighting in two
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.240]  years we still are being in a lockdown mode in this country like I always tell
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:53.840]  you that when I leave and when I return I always laughingly tell my friends I'm
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:59.840]  heading back to East Berlin now you know and things like that so I can
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:04.040]  understand to where it's not going away because they're not going away
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:09.280]  everything is still the same we're you know notice how focus isn't on the
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:13.600]  wars anymore we got kids over there dying and all this I did an interview the
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:17.600]  other day where you know as a young kid on the internet he wanted to compare
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:22.240]  how he's wrestling to politics and I was gonna have none of that I said look I
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:28.160]  said wrestling is entertainment it's it's sport that sports athleticism I said
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:33.280]  politics is serious I said we got kids still dying in Iraq and Afghanistan
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.720]  people didn't kill them where is over there which in this country now we
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.520]  seem to have taken some laws a fair attitude about them that oh well they
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:47.520]  signed up that's their job and away we go life goes on why worry about these
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:52.320]  wars that were involved in well governor I had Colonel Anthony Schaefer on last
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:56.520]  Friday before I went to Cal California and I had had General Hameed Ghoul the
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:00.360]  former head of Pakistani intelligence who beat the Russians on and he said
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.400]  we've already lost over there we're going to lose now the entire population of
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:08.400]  Pakistan is starting to rise up and that we will be run out within a year if we
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.640]  don't leave now and I asked Colonel Schaefer who'd been there for years and
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.880]  was you know part of Stratocivy and you know commanded of course able danger and
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.840]  he agreed he said we've got to leave in the next six months or we will lose but
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:26.360]  the system doesn't care and you know many of these experts agreed it's all
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:32.000]  about opium and lithium and those oil and gas pipelines just as you have said
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.320]  previously oh yeah no if you look if you look at Afghanistan that where our
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:41.280]  bases are set up our bases are completely set up to go along that pipeline
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:46.560]  and protect it and now if that's our real purpose over there then just be
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.320]  truthful with me Alex don't give me these other stories and all this other nonsense
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:56.600]  you know I got in big trouble you know when I was on Fox when I said that you
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:01.000]  know we've been practicing terrorism for 50 years we just call it foreign policy
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.640]  and people need to understand that's we've done a lot of awful things out in
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.720]  the world and we've instigated a lot of terrible things out in the world and then
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:16.120]  we wonder why we need this huge defense to protect ourselves from the rest of
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:20.160]  the world I think if we would start behaving our country a little more
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:24.520]  humanely and start looking at helping people rather than killing and
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:29.440]  destroying them everywhere we might not need the military that we seem to
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:35.800]  require in this country why do we require this massive largest military by I
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:41.280]  don't know 10 fold it's bigger military in the world it's bigger than all of
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:47.280]  their militaries combined yeah why what is the root of the problem we're supposed
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:51.760]  to be the best freedom we're supposed to be the country that all these other
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:58.120]  countries look up to and want to emulate you know and yet clearly they don't
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:04.240]  because of obviously our international behavior throughout the world and just
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:09.240]  because we have the biggest army and military in the world we couldn't fall
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:15.480]  down that shallow ignorant path that it's our way or the highway and that might
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:20.600]  is right well anything we do is okay because we got bigger bombs than you
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:25.560]  got well yeah that works for a while but if you go down through history you'll
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:29.520]  see that every military power throughout the world that have the power over the
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:35.040]  world eventually crumbled and fell well governor you're absolutely right and the
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:38.560]  big danger throughout history whether it was Rome and the time of Caesar over
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:43.160]  2,000 years ago or what happens in third world countries every month when you
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.960]  build up a giant police state military domestic grid which they've turned
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:52.360]  loose on us after 9-11 your nation always falls to a police state because why
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:55.800]  shouldn't the elite use that police state to take everybody's liberty and
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:00.040]  their freedoms when I was with you in Atlanta you know watching them want you
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:05.200]  and search you because you have a prosthetic hip had a hip replacement you
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:08.120]  know you talked about I can't wait to get out of here and get back to Mexico I
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:12.560]  can't wait to get out of East Germany I flew out of San Jose yesterday morning
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:16.120]  they had naked body scanners everywhere thank God they didn't try to put me into
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:19.880]  one because I wouldn't have done it I refuse to do and tell everybody refused
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:25.200]  to go in those things you don't have to be forced into them you can you can I
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.920]  refuse to they don't like it but I just tell them and not only that for health
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:34.840]  reasons Alex think about it for a minute when you go in and get a regular x-ray
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:40.680]  they covered they cover your private areas with lead the person that does it
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:45.120]  goes in another room and now they're gonna tell you that yes these x-rays are
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:50.240]  much more minor they're not to the level yeah that may be but if you were like me
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:55.240]  sometimes where you fly and you do Alex three and four times a week and you start
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:59.960]  getting microwave three to four times a week going into these things and then
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:04.240]  ten years from now you get some brain tumor or something and everyone's gonna
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.720]  go cheap how did that happen well gov let me stop you again I have the New
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:12.080]  York Times LA Times top scientists on record saying it's 20 to 50 times the
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:16.160]  radiation they'd previously said and that it is a serious cancer risk and now
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:22.040]  Forbes reports 500 mobile x-ray vans that are so powerful they look through your
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:27.720]  walls and they're beaming our houses with things 10 times more powerful than a
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:30.960]  chest x-ray we'll talk about that when we come back there's the headline
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:35.120]  airport body scanners could give you cancer warrants expert daily mail we

[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:44.440]  thousands already logged on get up there watch it capture this video we're gonna
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:48.200]  archive it later today at prismplanet.tv we got a big report coming up
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:52.680]  about this because Jesse's here as he's done many times but calling for a new
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:57.040]  investigation and challenging the mainstream media now we've got a bunch
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:00.640]  of different clips some of these were already on the news I'm gonna play some
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:05.080]  of the old clips first there's hundreds of these okay and we've written countless
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:09.120]  articles about them and put them in my films and Jesse's gone into a 9-11
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:12.200]  special report last year for his TV show and interviewed many of these same
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:17.520]  heroes police and people like Willie Rodriguez the janitor all confirming
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:21.520]  this because you look at the whole area of 9-11 you dig in anywhere and you find
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:25.680]  lies obstruction six of the ten commissioners saying you know a criminal
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:29.920]  cover-up by the Pentagon that's a Washington Post headline but but Jesse I
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:32.400]  don't want to paraphrase you but I've heard you many times and I agree with
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.920]  your statement that the collapse of the towers building seven that you think
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:40.080]  that's the biggest smoking gun is that correct well I don't know if it's the
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:46.920]  biggest one but it defies Newton's law of gravity it defies physics and it gets
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:53.240]  pretty serious when you defy when you're defying physics and physics tells you
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:58.800]  that those buildings could not fall and collapse at that rate of speed and you
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:03.360]  hit the ground you know the way that they did and then you look at them and
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:08.840]  you apply common sense all the cement is pulverized it's not collapsed it's
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:14.840]  blown to dust well that takes huge energy and if those buildings that truly
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:20.920]  collapse like they said the debris would have been way way more you would have
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:27.120]  had debris piled up probably a third of the height of the trade centers and by
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:31.960]  the way you're not saying this is a plumber or a doctor you're you are an
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:36.520]  expert in explosives explain that you know I was trained by the Navy's best I
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:41.240]  went to Bud's basic underwater demolition seal training and as you said
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:45.400]  earlier Alex you know underwater demolition and seals are synonymous in
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:49.880]  fact it was president John F. Kennedy that created the seals when he took the
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:55.040]  UDT swimmers and he wrote an executive order allowing the Navy to go beyond the
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:59.360]  high water mark which way they weren't allowed to do before and essentially that
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:04.320]  took the Navy frog man and made him a third element now the Navy frog man could
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:08.600]  not only be in the air and in the water but he would also be on land and so that
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:14.200]  the acronym is seals the air land teams and not you know when you look at the
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:18.880]  you look at the destruction of these buildings in order for them to collapse
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:24.960]  they would have to have uniformly collapsed together all at the same time
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.960]  but which is impossible and then you look at the fact that
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:36.040]  metal was found underneath in multiple places masses of it well does anyone
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:41.760]  realize that yes you can heat metal up to a structurally the weekend but you
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:48.200]  have to go over 3,000 degrees to melt metal and there's there's melted metal
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.880]  here and sir we have video clips of the firefighters on the news that day
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:58.000]  saying it was like a foundry and we have the NASA aircraft photos of months
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.440]  later close to 3,000 degrees incredible heat and that goes to the thermite
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:07.720]  continuing though talking about seven then we're going to start going to these
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:12.160]  clips well then you got building seven of course which you know there's the
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:16.640]  infamous BBC film where the reporter reports on the building falling and
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.280]  talks about it for seven minutes and is doing this 30 minutes before the actual
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:26.640]  building falls and the building is actually right behind her and and then
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:33.320]  you've got all the other contradictory statements you know that the mayor said
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:37.240]  we're going to pull the building the owner and said that we all agreed to pull
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:41.520]  the building and then they're trying to say that in demolition terms pulling it
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:46.080]  doesn't mean exploding it now you know they always come back after the fact and
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:49.680]  say well no what they meant was something else when we meant pull the
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:53.600]  building it meant we were going to evacuate it well I've never ever heard
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:57.760]  the term pull a building meeting to evacuate it out of people that's a new
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:03.480]  term to me well we better get started because you just reminded me of the
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:07.120]  Silverstein clip and now I've got limited time and I'm thinking of all
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:13.520]  these no no but everything you say is just backed up by so much proof I
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:17.360]  don't want to listen because I caught myself saying get that clip too we'll
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:20.380]  never have time to get to them all but we'll try to get to it all with
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:24.880]  Governor Jesse Ventura here is the first clip here is a New York fire
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:30.720]  department hours after it collapses with commanders talking about the floors
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:35.120]  popping out and it being a controlled demolition it was as if they had
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:39.360]  detonators as the quote and the beeps you hear are cuss words none of this has
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.600]  been edited except for the cuss words under FCC rules let's go ahead and play
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:50.520]  we made it we made it about a block we made it at least two blocks and we
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:39:03.640]  started all the way down I was watching it just ran up and then you just sort of
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:17.920]  this now let's go to another clip you heard the governor you heard me
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.840]  mention lava molten steel but we don't just have these firefighters on video
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:27.600]  to local television talking about molten steel like a foundry when you hear
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.880]  foundry that's where they make the steel okay you know big giant containers of
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:37.120]  molten steel you don't just hear them talking about that we have video from
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:44.600]  the news of the molten steel pouring out like lava Governor Ventura again this
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:49.440]  is powerful info absolutely because what temperature does it have to go for
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:55.040]  3,000 degrees to melt steel and here you've got a great deal of melted steel
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:01.960]  how could a plane crashing into a building cause steel to melt we're pulling up
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.920]  some of these other clips here we're having a computer hiccup but we'll get
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:12.320]  to that in a moment but I mean again the media says well steel could weaken and
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:18.280]  it could fall does it does it weaken and then turn into lava Alex I can even
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:22.480]  give you a personal story on that it was like two to three weeks after the
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:27.760]  event that that my wife and I were accompanied by Governor Pataki and we
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:31.480]  were allowed to go right into the ground zero when the workers were there
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:36.560]  attempting to clean up shortly thereafter and it didn't really dawn on me
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:40.400]  that day because again you're kind of numb when you go there and it's you
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.000]  know it's like walking into where a hurricane is hit after the fact and you
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.080]  see all the destruction and devastation but I remember that day they had to
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:53.360]  suspend digging because they were running into pockets of molten metal and
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:57.800]  heat that was so dangerous that they were they weren't allowed to dig into it
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:02.400]  and it didn't it didn't register with me that day but now when I think back to
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:07.040]  it I go wait a minute how could there be on the ground everything happened a
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:11.760]  hundred floors up in the air how could there possibly be molten metal down
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:15.720]  under the ground giant pools of it it's not just Governor Ventura saying that
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:19.920]  here's the firefighters here's that clip
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:27.080]  I think you just did it to who knew I to be honest with you I think it he might
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:32.960]  have thought that was it for us to get down below and you'd see molten steel
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:40.080]  molten steel running down the channel rails like you're in a foundry
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:48.480]  all right now governor here's the key before we get to the new clips there
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:53.480]  are literally five terabytes thousands of these clips and it's not somebody
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:59.280]  who's hurt or it's not a fire the clips that nixed for nine years has blocked
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:03.560]  but under a lawsuit by the International's group on 9-11 studies
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:08.400]  they've been able to get these videos and all the videos are firemen talking
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:14.120]  about molten steel bombs are firemen talking about all this incredible stuff
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:19.720]  I mean is that not evidence of a cover-up right there well obviously it is
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:24.080]  because you notice that they they don't include that in their report at all do
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:30.000]  they know they they weren't comes out nistas nistas all this information in
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.560]  their possession and yet their report chooses to ignore it to not even mention
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:41.720]  it and spend nine years blocking lawsuits to get it yeah and now how much
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:46.800]  more simple can it be for someone out there to look at that go something's
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:51.360]  rotten in Denmark here yeah they didn't release a bunch in nonsensical video the
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:55.680]  stuff they released is the FBI director of New York talking to firemen who say
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:58.920]  bombs were going off and he said yeah I saw the bottom of the building blowout
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:03.120]  and why in their report wouldn't they write something to say that these people
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:09.320]  were crazy and wrong and shouldn't they have at least addressed it and said
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:14.160]  well we had many reports of firemen and officials saying bombs were going off and
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.840]  then give an explanation as to why these people were wrong well we not only have
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:21.640]  this new video that just came out yesterday as they called for the video
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:27.080]  of the FBI director in New York saying this we have the local newscast that
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:32.720]  day saying the FBI director of the city said they're looking at bombs so we have
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:36.560]  it from both angles this is all new ladies and gentlemen here's the first new
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:40.840]  clip that they released two weeks ago culling through these this is a group of
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:45.000]  firemen with blood pouring out of their faces who have been seriously hurt one
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.200]  guy's got his face all smashed in and he looks up and they're talking about how
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:53.440]  after the plane set they were going in getting ready to go up and there were
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:57.840]  explosions in the lobby and then one fireman looks up and says we got to get
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:01.560]  out of here there could be bombs in all these buildings here's this new video
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:05.800]  that NIST didn't want any of you including Governor Jesse Ventura to see
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:07.560]  here it is
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:08.560]  what happened?
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:09.560]  there was an explosion
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:14.560]  there was an explosion in the lobby and the whole lobby collapsed on us
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:16.560]  what was it like? what was it like?
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:17.560]  horrible
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:18.560]  it's like hell
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:19.560]  you don't want to know
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.560]  the whole building just collapsed on us inside the lobby
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.560]  was that a secondary explosion?
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:24.560]  yes it was
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:25.560]  that was the plan from you
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:26.560]  yeah definitely secondary explosion
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:30.560]  it was inside waiting to go upstairs and on the way upstairs the whole
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.560]  complete blue
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.560]  we just collapsed on everybody inside the lobby
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:35.560]  so look at the first car coming down second
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:38.560]  I don't know about the first one but I know the second was terrible
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.560]  then there was a third one too after that one
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:42.560]  there was an explosion after that?
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:43.560]  yes
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:47.560]  everybody was inside the building waiting to go upstairs and they just let loose
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.560]  everything just let loose inside the building
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:53.560]  so what you told me is that there was a plane or whatever hit the building
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:54.560]  then the secondary explosion
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:56.560]  it was like three explosives after that
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:59.560]  we came in after the fire we came when the fire was going on already
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:02.560]  we was in the staging area inside the building
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.560]  waiting to go upstairs
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:07.560]  the whole lobby collapsed on the lobby inside
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.560]  and is this damn after that?
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:12.560]  no just man everybody tried to break their way out
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:14.560]  just trying to help all the brothers
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:16.560]  a lot of people were chatting inside and everything
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.560]  sitting in front of the neighbor
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:21.560]  we watched the first explosion as we were watching the buildings
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:25.560]  a sort of black, very large airplane fly right into the second building
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:26.560]  came out of the south
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.560]  right in front of our eyes
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:30.560]  it was just
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.560]  it was so surreal like a movie scene
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:34.560]  second, second and third explosion
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:36.560]  we were in the building for a third one
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:38.560]  it collapsed
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.560]  it was on this drive here for the other one
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.560]  people that understand there may be more
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:44.560]  any one of these f***ing buildings could blow up
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:46.560]  this ain't done yet
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:48.560]  this is going to top that
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:49.560]  alright
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:51.560]  now there he is saying this ain't done yet
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:54.560]  and that was shot at about 12 noon
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:57.560]  he was right five and a half hours later
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.560]  they weren't done yet
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.560]  governor you just heard three firefighters
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.560]  one of them senior saying bombs going off
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:06.560]  explosions in the south and north tower
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.560]  and what's unique about it
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.560]  you also heard them say they were in the
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:14.560]  prepared area getting ready to go up
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:16.560]  so that clearly lets you know
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:21.560]  this is before any of the buildings collapsed at all
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.560]  that these other explosions were going on
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:26.560]  now how can the government
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:30.560]  sit and say that they ignore this type of testimony
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.560]  well there's nothing written about this
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.560]  in any of the reports clearly that shows
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:40.560]  that what they've told us is just plain BS
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.560]  well here's my problem
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.560]  we only got about 20 men that's left with you
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.560]  and I haven't even gotten into a tenth of these
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:49.560]  I literally sir have hundreds
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:51.560]  let's play some more of that
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:52.560]  ok this next one
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:54.560]  and again people can watch this at infowars.com
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:56.560]  we've got a video stream there
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:58.560]  and this is another NIST video
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.560]  that they tried to suppress
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:03.560]  and it shows building seven before it collapses
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:06.560]  in cascading explosion noises
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:09.560]  that go on and on and on and on
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:11.560]  let's go ahead and just play a short part of that
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:35.560]  here it is
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.560]  oh yeah that's enough
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.560]  it goes on for like 10 minutes
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:41.560]  yeah you could definitely know that that took place
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:43.560]  before seven collapse
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.560]  you definitely could hear an explosion
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:48.560]  and it was even identified as one on the tape
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:50.560]  and then we have local news
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:52.560]  out there with their cameras
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.560]  before the first plane hits
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.560]  you hear it coming in and then you hear
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:57.560]  boom boom boom boom
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:59.560]  and then the plane hits and that's what
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:01.560]  the other witnesses like Willie Rodriguez said
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.560]  about 10 seconds before
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560]  explosions then the plane hits
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.560]  this is incredible
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:10.560]  Governor your take on this
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:13.560]  well again this is the evidence
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:15.560]  I guess that we're all supposed to say
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.560]  don't believe our lying eyes
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:19.560]  and don't believe our lying ears
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.560]  let's play another clip
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.560]  that was on CNN that day
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:25.560]  this is and I've interviewed
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.560]  the police and firemen that were there
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.560]  and it was on a local news station
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.560]  Craig Bartmer and others were told
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.560]  there was a countdown get back
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.560]  and then they said run for your lives
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:37.560]  2978654321
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.560]  and here you see
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.560]  policemen saying get back
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.560]  that building's about to come down
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.560]  get back that building's about to come down
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:47.560]  and that's what Silverstein tells us
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:49.560]  and what building are they referring to
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:51.560]  seven they're referring to building seven
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:49:17.560]  music
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.560]  just in the last few seconds
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.560]  another building
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.560]  building number seven one of the buildings
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:25.560]  in support of the real trade center
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:27.560]  tower
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.560]  Governor Ventura
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.560]  you know again I've read about all that
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.560]  now you get a chance to hear it
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:35.560]  you know and again clearly
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:37.560]  they knew the building was coming down ahead of time
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.560]  and you know you look at
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:41.560]  the 9-11 commission
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:43.560]  they didn't even address building seven
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.560]  there isn't one word in their entire report
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:47.560]  that even deals
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:49.560]  with building number seven
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:51.560]  and this didn't even bring out the report
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:53.560]  until two or three years after
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:55.560]  you know they waited until
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.560]  you know the storm
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.560]  had already left sight from everyone
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:01.560]  because you know we in the United States
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.560]  most people
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.560]  they have about a six month attention span
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.560]  well most Americans don't even know about building seven
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.560]  but in most cities it'd be the biggest
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:11.560]  building in the town
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.560]  it was 49 stories high
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:15.560]  which is not a small building
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:17.560]  it's a big stretch of the imagination
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:19.560]  now it is small when you put it
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:21.560]  next to the World Trade Center towers
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:23.560]  but as you said Alex
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.560]  in an average city it would be a major major building
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:27.560]  and for this thing to collapse
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:29.560]  in seven seconds
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.560]  having not been hit by anything
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:33.560]  other than some debris
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:35.560]  and stuff and the fires
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.560]  were not that bad on it
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.560]  and yet we've never received a proper
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.560]  explanation as to
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.560]  why this building collapsed
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.560]  and again you look on the flip side
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:47.560]  this building got repaired
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:49.560]  and replaced in record time
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.560]  stay there sir we're going to break
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:53.560]  the big new clip the FBI director
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.560]  talking about explosions and bombs
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:57.560]  they tried to suppress this video
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:25.560]  Stay with us
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:29.560]  and here's the best part
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.560]  these seeds have not been genetically modified
[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:33.560]  in any way
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:35.560]  and you actually get enough seeds
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:37.560]  to plant a full acre crisis garden

[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:15.560]  but we're going through all these clips
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:17.560]  this is only the tip of the iceberg
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:19.560]  before I go into the big news
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:23.700]  New York saying the same thing you just heard police and firemen say governor we
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:27.360]  talked this morning about a new investigation what's your statement on
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:31.720]  having all of this conclusively proving a cover-up what do you think we should
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:35.240]  do as a nation because clearly everything that was done under Bush is just
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:39.480]  continuing we have no future you know Tyrell and your daughter and none of us
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:43.320]  have any future if we don't stand up they're gonna stage more terror if we
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:48.920]  don't expose it well that's just it what do we do you know when they control the
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:54.000]  power and they control who gets to investigate it basically then to be
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.800]  stripped down to the most basic essential of all the only thing we have in our
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:04.040]  power that is the power of the vote if we can still trust that and I like I've
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:09.320]  been advocating people need to stop voting for Democrats and Republicans and
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:15.680]  that doesn't mean the answer is is the the Tea Party because I find the Tea
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:19.920]  Party to be a bit of a fraud too because they're supposed to stand up for the
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:24.600]  Constitution and they amazingly just showed up when Barack Obama became
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:28.220]  president they weren't around prior to that yeah where's their problem with the
[01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:31.760]  wars and the naked-body scanners and the Patriot Act the grassroots are good
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:35.600]  it's the Republicans trying to take it over that are bad but specifically what
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:39.280]  about state investigations grand jury investigations more people are going
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:44.320]  public well again if you can get a local official to do it but the problem is
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:48.880]  they're all generally Democrats and Republicans and you have the power
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:53.160]  structure that goes all the way to Washington you're not when I was way
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:57.840]  back when I was mayor of Brooklyn Park Minnesota we had it we had this golf
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:04.400]  club house that was so dirty that the audit firm of Deloitte came in and went
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:08.960]  through and their official reports that their books were unauditable they
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:14.480]  could not audit their books we took it to Democratic current Democratic
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:19.040]  governor candidate Mark Dayton who is the state auditor at the time we showed
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:23.240]  him all our facts and everything and he wouldn't touch it because the power
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:27.080]  structure happened to be his party the Democrats absolutely we got a shift
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:31.120]  gears now into the top story that you're here to discuss exclusive uncovered
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:35.520]  9-11 footage shows FBI director asking firefighters about secondary hits on
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:41.320]  WTC this is shot by firefighters we bleeped out any cussing he addresses
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:47.240]  them as FBI director Barry Maughan and then he's there with Giuliani and they
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:53.160]  walk away as this was happening this is huge 9-11 cover-up ladies and gentlemen
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:56.920]  here is the FBI director agreeing with the firefighters that he saw the bomb go
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:09.760]  off and the and the bottom of the North Tower blowout here it is
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:51.560]  okay and then there he goes with Mayor Giuliani Jesse Ventura governor Ventura
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:55.000]  there is the FBI director of New York saying yeah no I saw the bottom of the
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.760]  building blowout yeah I mean you know you've got all this evidence but clearly
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:04.080]  it when you look at what happened and the results of all of it it shows
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:09.200]  clearly that these commissions of these official government investigations are
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:14.800]  frauds there you know they don't seek the truth they're there to simply push
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:19.240]  the the government story of whatever that may be of what they want said and
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:22.720]  what happened and not you know for you know when you look at the whole
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:27.240]  commission I mean it got run by Zellicow who comes right out of the
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:32.840]  White House he was the guy in charge if they didn't unanimously agree on
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:36.840]  something it wasn't even entered into it governor back in 70 seconds let's talk
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:40.840]  about how we get a new investigation straight ahead more clips

[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:12.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:20.040]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:25.920]  Alex Jones alright we're into hour number three we've got a long way to go in a
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:30.800]  short time to get there the governor's gone here about 14 minutes with us this
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:35.240]  incredible information coming out from next and it's all bombshell you know why
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:38.880]  they covered it up there's the evidence of the criminality right there this is
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:43.280]  just so incredible I want to get to Jack Kelly a news reporter on the ground
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:49.400]  also talking about bombs and explosions this was on a CNN but going back to
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:54.300]  Governor Ventura briefly where does this start for a new investigation how do we
[02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:58.360]  expose this big line it's difficult because you know you saw the new
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:02.400]  administration come in and you know with Obama and they won't touch it you know
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:07.160]  they won't look at it at all so that clearly shows you that you know it isn't
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:12.080]  Democrat against Republican here you know because if the Democrats had any
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:16.840]  way if they truly were at war with the Republicans and they could expose the
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:23.320]  Republicans for an atrocity as large as this you don't think they would so that
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:28.200]  clearly shows that they're both in it that the parties don't really matter
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:32.560]  and I guess where do we go from here I would tell people that you know any
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:37.000]  grassroots thing starts at its lowest level that's why it's called grassroots
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:42.920]  even in your local elections stop voting for Democrats and Republicans that's a
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:49.520]  very simple thing we all can do November 2nd is just next week vote for
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:54.040]  Democrats or Republicans well said before you leave us you'll briefly talk
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:58.560]  about Tom Horner there running for governor he's got a shot at it let's
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:04.560]  go to this next clip Jack Kelly bombs in the buildings on CNN here it is joining
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:10.200]  me is Jack Kelly now he is a foreign correspondent war correspondent and
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:14.520]  just came back from Israel he has some information about these attacks Jack
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:19.240]  what can you tell us happened first in New York I'm apparently what appears to
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:22.480]  happen was that at the same time two planes hit the building that they're
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:26.760]  that the FBI most likely thinks that there was a car or truck packed with
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:30.200]  explosives underneath the buildings which also exploded at the same time and
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:33.680]  brought both of them down now that's the first time we're hearing that so two
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:38.320]  planes and explosives that were in the building is that correct that is the
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:41.760]  working theory at this point okay one confirmed that it's so they never
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:46.120]  discredited the working theory they just said it didn't exist and then this is
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:53.800]  done Alex yes they just ignored it that's what they do with anything that
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:58.960]  doesn't fit into their scenario they simply ignore now here's another clip
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:01.920]  we're just gonna play you know what I'm not gonna have time to I've got all the
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:06.280]  local newscast with witnesses saying bombs going off and firefighters and
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:09.680]  people and then I've got another newscast before the plane hits seconds
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:13.720]  before you hear the clear explosion then the plane hits it just goes on and on
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:20.000]  I want to come back from this quick break and get into you know the classic
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:23.560]  stuff building seven on BBC where they say it's already fallen when it's right
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:28.160]  behind them I want to get into Larry Silverstein saying we gave the order to
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:30.920]  pull it and watch it come down but we got about a minute and a half left in
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:35.160]  this segment what about more marches for 9-11 truth what about more people going
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:39.960]  public grassroots that might work but you have to remember the mainstream media
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:45.400]  is not the ally you can march all you want but if they don't cover it then the
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:49.120]  only people that know a march took place are the locals well that's why you're
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:52.960]  right why do you think what do you think happened prior to the invasion of
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:58.440]  Iraq there was a great deal of anti-war protests and marching but you never
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:03.520]  thought on TV because the TV stations mainstream refused to cover any
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:08.160]  negative about the invasion of Iraq because they wanted to portray to the
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:13.360]  public that nobody was against this how could you possibly be against this and
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:17.080]  if you were you were on patriotic and that's exactly what they're able to pull
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:20.520]  off well that's why you're so important you're one of the few national figures
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:24.720]  who's got the courage and the profile to be able to punch through mainstream
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:27.760]  media and you you tell it like it is when you're on television and it has a
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:31.520]  big effect and we see 9-11 truth only growing bigger and more people coming
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:35.520]  out governor yeah that's true Alex but if you notice I'm getting censored more
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:41.000]  and more the access that I had two years ago I had way more two years ago than
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:46.400]  what I'm getting now I'm being cut back to I can't get on all the shows I'd
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:50.600]  like to get on anymore especially the big Fox shows we're gonna come back and
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:54.560]  play a few more of these key key clubs with governor Jesse Ventura this is
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:57.920]  incredible new developments folks get it out to everyone you know 9-11 search
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:03.000]  term 9-11 cover up this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.440]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:11.480]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:15.360]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:19.400]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:23.960]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:28.560]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:32.320]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:35.800]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:39.720]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:42.920]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:29.400]  and Conway cover up we'll talk about the Kentucky situation it is big
[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:33.080]  after governor Jesse Ventura leaves us I'm gonna finish up those some of these
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:36.440]  clips we didn't have time to play while he was with us there are hundreds and
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:39.760]  hundreds and hundreds others that's what's so frustrating governor is it's
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:44.960]  hidden in plain view and and we've got to expose these people I mean you agree
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:47.640]  that if we don't expose the system that's doing this that they're gonna
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:52.520]  continue to use fake terror as a pretext to enslave us absolutely absolutely and
[02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:57.120]  you know and the thing that's most frustrating is mainstream media I mean I
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:01.600]  guess you know when I do my publicity for my show I've been taking a different
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:06.600]  tact I've been going on and thanking them because I thank them for covering
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:10.960]  whether pro athlete feet on their wives the death of Anna Nicole Smith and all
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:15.760]  that important stuff because I said if you covered the things we covered me my
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:20.600]  crew and production company wouldn't have jobs I guess I always make sure to
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:26.280]  thank them for providing jobs for us because I'm just a baffled Alex it's
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:31.200]  beyond words how our mainstream media which was designed to be the fourth
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:36.040]  branch of government the unwritten fourth branch by our forefathers their
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:41.560]  job was to be the check to be the watchdog and watch the other three branches
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:46.280]  of government to keep them honest and now that they have sold us out we are in
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:51.360]  dire straits Alex because with mainstream media ignoring things like this
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:57.920]  these stories should be the lead stories on TV right now and yet where are they
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:02.760]  hearing them not to downgrade you and I but the only place they're hearing that
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:08.160]  is on your radio show and a few other non-mainstream outlets well the ruling
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:12.880]  class the elite the social engineers wouldn't have staged 9-11 if they weren't
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:17.160]  confident in their superiority over the mainstream media but we do see the
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:21.560]  mainstream media losing ratings viewers and a national polls the public trust
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:25.400]  the alternative media a lot more than they do the mainstream media well and
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:30.920]  that's clearly shown when the most trusted man hands down above all others
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:38.040]  with double-digit win is John Stewart and he's making a joke about things John
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:43.080]  Stewart shows comedy yet it's serious comedy because he you know he does it
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:47.640]  with the comedic intent but what he talks about the position he takes are
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:53.240]  very good and that's why when I was at Harvard Alex I asked all the Harvard
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:57.280]  students where they get their nose from and it was like 90% of them all said
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:00.760]  John Stewart yeah he's better than son the problem is it's kind of a liberal
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:04.080]  perspective but he will cover topics others won't we're almost out of time I
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:07.720]  want to play two final clips and then talk about the TV show and also the
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:12.400]  governor's race up in Minnesota that you're involved in supporting Tom
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:17.120]  Horner but first let's go because you mentioned this earlier we're pulling
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:21.160]  this up let's go to Jane Stanley of the BBC and they did on the on their other
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:26.600]  BBC channel the same time live this is BBC World was also in BBC 24 another
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:31.440]  reporter being fed and they now admit Reuters gave them this that building 7
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:35.680]  had fallen perfectly in its own footprint the Solomon Brothers building
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:41.640]  before it actually fell here it is well trade center as you can see behind me
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:47.160]  the trade center appears to be still burning we see these huge clouds of
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:52.600]  smoke and ash and we know that behind that there's an empty piece of what was
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:58.680]  a very familiar New York skyline a symbol of the financial prosperity of
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:04.400]  this city but so so meanwhile right behind her is building 7 and she's
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:08.600]  saying it's fallen Jesse yeah that's correct he talks about it for over 7
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:13.000]  minutes about the third building that has collapsed that wasn't struck by an
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.720]  aircraft and the entire time she's talking building 7's right behind her
[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:23.480]  because she actually did this 30 minutes before the building actually fell
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:28.820]  and the same thing was on CNN there with Aaron Brown but just like with NIST
[02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:33.200]  suppressing their internal videos that show the same thing BBC for a year said
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:37.200]  that was fake and then they said okay it's true but we lost the tapes now
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:39.640]  they've done a special and have admitted it but just say it was a
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:43.960]  coincidence last clip with Governor Jesse Ventura because he mentioned here's
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:47.880]  the owner of the World Trade Center lease Larry Silverstein saying they gave
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:52.000]  the order on building 7 to pull it demolition term for control demolition
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.880]  and they watched the building come down here it is allowing occupants to
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:13:01.200]  evacuate to safety I remember getting a call from the fight upon a commander
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:04.240]  telling me that they were not sure they're gonna be able to contain the
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:10.680]  fire as you know we've had such terrible loss of life if this one thing goes is
[02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:15.720]  pulled and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:20.440]  collapse did you know a Fox News reporter wrote an article three months ago
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:23.620]  and admitted he was with Silverstein and they made the decision to pull but then
[02:13:23.620 --> 02:13:26.880]  decided not to so now they admit they were planning to blow it up but white
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:30.320]  Silverstein gave this interview a year after and said they pulled it I mean
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:33.960]  Jesse you know you know what I liked about it Alex is they now use the
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:40.120]  terminology pull it meant to pull the firefighters out that's the excuse they
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:44.360]  use for it but you notice he says pull it and then ties it right into the
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:48.160]  bringing the building down because that wasn't the intent of what he was
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:52.280]  talking about he was talking about bringing the building down but in order
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:57.360]  to cover themselves they've now stated that Silverstein was simply stating the
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:01.320]  fire captain when he used the term pull it meant that they were gonna pull all
[02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:05.240]  the firefighters out that it was a lost cause well there's just one problem and
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:08.640]  we happen to have the New York City Lodge the firefighters were pulled at
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:13.200]  11 23 in the morning more than five hours before the building fell there
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:19.800]  you go unbelievable governor so this information I mean we just presented
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:23.000]  here it's only the tip of the iceberg that's pretty darn powerful isn't it
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:28.600]  it's very powerful and again Alex if it amazes me that how mainstream media can
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:32.120]  possibly say that they're they're the ones that provide us with our knowledge
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:36.720]  when all of this is out there and none of them will touch it in any way shape or
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:41.280]  form I mean did you see how quickly George Stephanopoulos got me off good
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:46.160]  morning America or whatever it was yes the minute he said that I responded that
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:50.480]  I felt that our government certainly if they didn't participate in it they do
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:55.220]  about it they've covered it up he could get me off there quicker I bet you my
[02:14:55.220 --> 02:15:00.520]  segment ended up about a minute 25 yeah he had to bail and pull the plug as you
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:04.680]  had the courage to tell the truth in closing tell us a little bit about the
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:11.680]  TV show and also you're involved politically up there for the third party
[02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:16.080]  candidate Tom Horner running for governor and he's polling about like you
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:21.520]  were yeah he's got a shot at it you know I don't know he's right about where I
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:26.880]  was a week before my election now does he have the momentum that I had I don't
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:33.680]  know but we will not stop trying up here because Minnesota proved in 1998 that
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:37.520]  they would elect an independent governor and we've had great candidates
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:41.200]  since then we haven't elected another one but we'll still keep trying and I'll
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:45.680]  still keep trying because again we're not gonna get our country back until we
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:50.280]  stop electing Democrats and Republicans and follow John Adams's suggestion and
[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:54.240]  get rid of these political parties because they are not the solution they
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:57.760]  are the problem that's right you've talked about that I'll just say the
[02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:03.200]  biggest thing to me on the TV show this fall is the confession we have to the
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:09.360]  murder of John Kennedy extremely powerful and this episode's area 51
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:13.560]  coming up Friday night yeah area 51 will be Friday night then we're gonna do
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:20.760]  clean water we do the police state we do the Wall Street we do JFK and there's a
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:24.960]  couple more thrown in there that I can't think of right now all right well
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:29.600]  Governor Jesse Ventura I appreciate you joining us and I know in the next month
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:33.640]  you're going back down to Mexico so have fun down there get some rest it's well
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:38.160]  deserved say hi to Terry and Tyrell and everybody I look forward to seeing you
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:43.440]  back again if we're still here in 2011 well hopefully we'll still be here Alex
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:46.640]  and again keep up the good work I'll leave you to handle the collateral
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:52.320]  damage it's time for me to go on R&R God bless you sir take care of you too Alex
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:57.200]  take care and best of your family and keep up the fight boing by Oz Governor
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:02.960]  all right there goes Governor Jesse Ventura ladies and gentlemen and he was
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:06.000]  done doing radio interviews last week but he did this one just especially but
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.840]  now they're filming another interview for the water special he'll do a little
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:13.960]  bit more radio next week and then he's gone a few weeks after that back down to
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:22.400]  Mexico but look they blew up the towers in front of everybody you have the
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:26.760]  fireman the police talking about the bombs the molten steel you've got it all
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:30.720]  right there and I didn't even get to all the clips I'm gonna have Paul Watson
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:37.920]  today basically take this Jesse Ventura calls for new 9-11 investigation or
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:43.560]  Jesse Ventura calls for investigation in light of explosive evidence and get
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:47.040]  that out to everyone because people are like well we already know all this no
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:51.640]  your friends your family your neighbors don't they've heard 9-11's an inside job
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:56.240]  they know about the lies about WMD's or Northwood's or Gulf of Tonkin but then
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:59.440]  they kind of have the attitude of well it's up to me to decide if it's an
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:02.320]  inside job or not you know I make the decision it's not because it's too
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:07.560]  scary none of us have any future if you don't face the elephant in the room and
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:11.280]  I just played you the FBI director of New York with the mayor walk along beside
[02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:14.440]  him coming over to firefighters and he's going yeah I saw the bottom of the
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:20.000]  building blowout I just played you the firefighters talking about bombs I just
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:24.440]  went over and this is what NIST tried to block this is what NIST all these years
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:30.800]  hasn't wanted released I mean don't you see how incredible that is so we're
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:36.200]  searching the term search it right now and search it after the show 9 slash 1
[02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:44.440]  1 cover-up 9 slash 1 1 1 cover-up I just added a 1 there and we'll put that up on

[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:26.720]  you make it the number one search term it'll force mainstream media to look at

[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:31.160]  very carefully right now I'm not mincing words about this Rand Paul could
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:36.960]  lose in Kentucky and that will send a message against hardcore patriot
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:43.240]  candidates nationwide and will serve as a blueprint to encourage the dirtiest
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:51.120]  nastiest tricks we have ever seen in modern politics in this country so I
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:54.400]  want to reach out to everyone to understand they lied and said he wanted
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:57.240]  to get rid of the civil rights act we know that wasn't true that he kidnapped
[02:24:57.240 --> 02:25:00.840]  a woman made her do drugs wasn't true that he wasn't a medical doctor wasn't
[02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:05.320]  true that he had racist at his events turned out they worked with Conway and
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:10.880]  the Democrats they've been caught but Conway is throwing everything he can in
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:16.160]  the next five and a half days coming up on Super Tuesday he is throwing
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:23.360]  everything he has got right now against Rand Paul it's a national story about
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:27.600]  some woman with a wig rushing towards Rand Paul so they kind of tackler and a
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:31.000]  guy puts his foot on her meanwhile they don't show in the national news though
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.720]  it's on YouTube that same event Rand Paul supporters being beat up this stuff
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:47.240]  happens meanwhile this came out on this actually came out on the 23rd so this
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:54.080]  actually came out on some on Saturday I didn't learn about it until the 26th
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:59.960]  yesterday when I went to prison planet calm and saw the link to the Daily Paul
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:06.160]  article then I went and read the article they linked to courier journal then I
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:10.760]  found a couple other newspaper articles and I searched last night nothing else
[02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:16.560]  maybe one TV station mentioned it listen to me this is a huge cover-up of real
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:22.280]  corruption they have been caught red-handed we can confidently say that
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:31.400]  Jack Conway and his brother have committed a crime multiple crimes we
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:34.840]  don't know if they're really involved in narcotics trafficking his brother we
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:38.560]  don't know if he had drugs at his house what we know is there was going to be a
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:44.720]  drug raid on his house detectives in the same county where Jack Conway's brother
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:50.400]  is the deputy prosecutor he's also a lawyer his brother is the attorney general
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:56.360]  running against Rand Paul we know Jack Conway this is all admitted in police
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:01.840]  reports okay this is admitted in police reports it's a five-page lengthy
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:07.440]  article in the courier journal the headline says LMPD probes detectives
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:16.040]  who tipped off prosecutors under investigation and it doesn't tell you
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:23.120]  till deep in the article that this Matthew C. Conway is the brother of the
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:29.080]  attorney general of Kentucky and they admit the detectives met with the
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:34.560]  attorney general they told him they met with others they went and met with his
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:40.360]  brother they went and met with attorney Matt Conway his brother the the
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:46.600]  prosecutor and they told them you better get yourself clean these are quotes
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:50.200]  and whatever's going on you better get ready for a raid in two days and they
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:55.240]  blocked the raid to give him time to do whatever he did now we don't know and it
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:59.720]  says it was for narcotics trafficking and use we don't know it was cocaine
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:04.320]  heroin we don't know we don't know if he's guilty you're innocent until proven
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:09.960]  guilty but they are in here in this article all of them making admissions of
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:13.840]  guilt this is enough for a grand jury to indict the attorney general and I'm
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:19.840]  calling for that and his prosecutor brother they are all in here admitting
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:24.520]  they met secretly with detectives and the detectives warned him and blocked
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:29.480]  the service of the search warrant and the raid for two days and then when this
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:34.280]  first came out because they overheard the detectives a couple weeks ago this
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:40.240]  happened weeks ago talking about the case at a restaurant that's how other
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:44.320]  police got tipped off about it and then when the police went and talked to them
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:49.320]  they lied the other detectives admit they apologize they say I lied because
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:57.080]  because I like Matt Conway and I don't think it's true they warned him and then
[02:28:57.080 --> 02:29:02.880]  they lied and said we didn't warn him we didn't meet with him they lied to the
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:09.960]  investigating detectives the detectives did Conway is in here lying saying he
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:15.680]  wasn't warned Matt Conway his brother is on record meeting with these people they
[02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:22.440]  have absolutely obstructed justice they have tried to escape the law that's
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:30.360]  called absconding and a criminal investigation they have lied they are
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:37.080]  guilty Jack Conway his brother Matt Conway are guilty of trying to frustrate
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:41.280]  a criminal investigation and they're all a bunch of top prosecutors are a bunch
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:47.200]  of cops now that's who Jack Conway is do I think there were narcotics in that

[02:32:20.920 --> 02:32:25.000]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:29.560]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:33.680]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:00.760]  newspapers from the police files red-handed the attorney general his
[02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:05.240]  prosecutor brother and three police detectives two of them admitting they
[02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:09.640]  lied when they said they hadn't warned Conway about the narcotics trafficking
[02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:14.880]  and use investigation now whether that narcotics investigation would have ever
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:20.280]  turned up drugs his brother did resign it now turns out you know this happened
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:26.640]  months ago and this has been quietly covered up okay his brother left as a
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:31.000]  prosecutor he's gone the cops are quoted saying I guess my career is over
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:34.000]  well yeah there should be a criminal investigation of this and there is a
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:39.640]  criminal investigation but the election is now Rand Paul has to take all these
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:45.480]  lies from this slime ball Jack Conway and put up with all this so I'm telling

[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:52.760]  absconding a criminal investigation in fact in fact I wasn't gonna take phone
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:55.320]  calls and I haven't had time to pull up Kentucky law but I was the same everywhere
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:59.560]  in the country can any Kentucky police officers or prosecutors that we ought to
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:04.800]  search I mean what are the other charges I know there's a bunch of others I
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:09.880]  mean am I I mean I know those are correct crimes and charges I'm talking
[02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:15.520]  about but there's others as well official corruption I mean what's it called
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:19.320]  when when people in government are protecting themselves and giving each
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:25.880]  other for warning it's a conspiracy to obstruct justice there you go sounds
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:28.880]  like racketeering to me you got a whole bunch of people involved I mean how many

[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:53.880]  people are like well I don't live in Kentucky why do I care if Rand Paul wins
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:58.120]  if they get away with lying about him and smearing him it's gonna be the play
[02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:02.040]  book for all other patriot candidates trying to take this country back you got
[02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:06.000]  election fraud and every other close election in Arizona and Nevada and New
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.560]  York and Illinois the American people are angry they're taking action and the
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:16.040]  systems using dirty tricks and Conway has been narrowing his lead against Rand
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:24.120]  Paul and here's the 64 million dollar question and answer if if we are able
[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:29.960]  to force this Jack Conway cover-up story out in the mainstream news because we
[02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:32.960]  don't know if there were narcotics in his brother's house the prosecutor we
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:36.880]  don't know of all this is true because because he got warned because the
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:41.000]  police couldn't rate his house and he's a prosecutor it makes it even more
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:45.240]  imperative we know about corruption in high places and here's the 64 million
[02:38:45.240 --> 02:38:50.520]  dollar answer if you can force this out in the next two three days and that's
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:55.120]  why they hate this radio show because our audience can do it if you can call
[02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:58.400]  Fox News Fox radio they're one of the more app groups to do it but I haven't I
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:02.040]  did a search and haven't seen him cover it if you can get this out this is real
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:05.920]  corruption we don't know about the drugs but we know they covered it up and we
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:10.520]  know they did things that are illegal this is big this could get Rand Paul in
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:15.440]  there okay because anytime you use you you you investigate these globalists
[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:19.560]  there's always corruption I mean they're just so corrupt I mean who else would
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:25.600]  vote for Obamacare and banker bailouts but corrupt politicians so this is so
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:32.480]  hardcore important that you make Conway cover up the number one search term it
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:36.000]  may be number one it may be number two we'll find out soon nine slash one one
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:42.440]  cover up and number two search Conway cover up and Paul Watson and Kurt
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:46.560]  Nemo but but here's the deal when this goes number one in the next hour or two
[02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:50.720]  we got to have the articles up and so we're working on getting those up so
[02:39:50.720 --> 02:39:55.720]  that when it's the number one search term they get led back to Conway cover up and
[02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:59.360]  I'm sure there's other listeners that have websites why don't you go write a
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:04.440]  Conway cover up article and it'll be you up there I don't care I don't care I
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:09.720]  don't want this corrupt attorney general caught protecting and covering up and
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:13.960]  blocking and warning his brother of criminal investigations using his police
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:17.400]  connections to do it I don't want him winning I don't want all the dirty
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:21.600]  tricks he's pulled out of his black bag against Rand Paul and our movement for
[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:28.600]  liberty and restore the Constitution to be successful ah man I'm mad and you
[02:40:28.600 --> 02:40:36.200]  should get mad about it too let me go look at my IM's here from John and of

[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:58.680]  on the subject 1-800-259-9231 this is this is so important what's going on in
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:05.760]  my IM doesn't work so we'll try to we'll try to launch that right now but it's
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:11.560]  absolutely incredible and it makes my blood boil to know that the media the
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:15.680]  mainstream media in fact reading back over the article this stuff went on
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:18.920]  earlier in the year with his brother and it's been covered up ever since and now
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:25.160]  it finally came out five days ago in the courier dash journal dot com the
[02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:28.480]  courier journal newspaper and several other newspapers and it's all direct
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:33.520]  quotes and the police reports and all of it admitted in the article LMPD probes
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:37.320]  detectives who tipped off prosecutor under investigation that's why it's a
[02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:45.440]  Conway cover-up it's a Conway cover-up because Conway is involved in a
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:49.640]  cover-up of what was going on with his brother and the media is covering it up
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:55.360]  this is newsworthy this information is newsworthy I mean it's just shows you

[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:54.320]  whether he is an narcotics trafficker or not the issue is he got a heads up to
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:42:57.840]  get ready for the raid and his brother the attorney general was involved in it
[02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:02.840]  then they lied to the other county investigators and state investigators and
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:05.920]  said they didn't give him a warning now they admit they gave him a warning
[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:09.560]  because one of the detectives came out and told the truth do you understand how
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:14.760]  big that is listen I appreciate your call Chris and Kentucky you're on the

[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:13.200]  have a press conference and highlight the Courier General that has the police
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:17.920]  reports and say Jack Conway met secretly with police Jack Conway
[02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:21.800]  protected his brother then the police and others lied to investigators and said
[02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:26.000]  they didn't give him a warning now they admit they lied they say I lied I'm
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:33.000]  sorry sorry doesn't cut it we have them we're Rand Paul this is not dirty

[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:16.040]  going up in the next hour at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:20.600]  when these articles go live with all this information we need you to make a
[02:45:20.600 --> 02:45:26.440]  thousand copies at FedEx kinkos and hand them out at street corners we need you
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:30.600]  to email it to all the media nationwide not just Kentucky and say after I mean
[02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:34.320]  look turn about fair play and we have the truth after all they've done to ran

[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:41.520]  after all they've done with their lives this is admitted cover-up and
[02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:47.520]  instruction of justice we have them if we ram this out now it's up to you
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:53.640]  listeners ram this sucker out let's get going listeners and start praying them
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:56.520]  get out there and get them on car windshields and by the way I'll tell
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:46:00.360]  you move on dot org who's out there and all these other people they're listening
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:03.760]  to the show right now and they're gonna come out with their own Conway cover-up
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:07.320]  stuff to try to like Conway cover-up isn't true or Conway you know it's a
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:11.400]  there's a cover-up how great he is I've seen him do similar things before we've
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:15.480]  got to have all the Patriot media the Daily Paul everybody write your own
[02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:21.280]  articles excising out you know or take adding to your article all the
[02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:25.800]  admissions in the courier journal from the police reports because it's the weak
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:31.080]  headline of LMPD probes detectives who tipped off prosecutor under investigation
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:34.840]  and then later in the article they tell you it's Jack Conway and they've all
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:39.160]  admitted to his brother and the police to lying and Conway covering it up I
[02:46:39.160 --> 02:46:43.680]  mean we have these people I don't think folks realize how big this is you know
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:48.800]  we have real corruption open and shut lying and went tip-offs to narcotics
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:53.960]  investigations ladies and gentlemen if I know that the police are gonna raid my
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:47:00.400]  neighbor for a cocaine investigation and I find out about it and I go tell my
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:03.880]  neighbor and later he gets busted and tells them that I'm gonna go to prison
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:09.600]  for oh it's aiding and abetting it's not just obstruction of justice it's not
[02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:16.200]  just absconding it's not just official corruption it's not just a conspiracy to
[02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:25.080]  obstruct justice it is aiding and abetting someone in the evasion of a
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:29.520]  criminal investigation you have to pull up the exact Kentucky code on that but I
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:36.320]  know the states it's guaranteed aiding and abetting the evasion of a criminal
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:41.240]  investigation and if you and if you know there's a criminal investigation for
[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:46.160]  drugs it's just flat out aiding and abetting aiding and abetting aiding abet
[02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:52.520]  aiding abet Jack Conway aides and abets his brother to warns him of drug
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:59.280]  raid boom boom boom I mean we can just smash this guy right into the ground
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:03.400]  right now and I'm willing to fight these corrupt thugs I'm willing to stand up
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:06.960]  here put my name everything on the line I'm willing to get up here and tell it
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:11.200]  like it is I've studied the law the common law the state laws I know what
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:15.960]  this is it's all admitted in this article yeah you can just get the career
[02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:18.640]  journal article and say it out to folks that write the line hey read the whole
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:22.200]  article they admit obstruction of justice they admit a cover-up they admit
[02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:27.840]  lying to police all right here all right here this is the biggest fattest juiciest
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:32.320]  torpedo to bring down that slime bag and even if he doesn't get indicted for all
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:36.080]  of this the fact that this comes out something real this will stick to him
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:40.520]  this will stick to him like black paint thrown up against the side of a white
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:46.120]  wall okay this is going to stand out like a sore thumb this information is
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:51.480]  absolutely key Jeremy in Kentucky you're on the air what's your take on this yeah
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:56.840]  yeah and I'm on the air yes you are yeah I was just think this is kind of odd
[02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:03.560]  because a few weeks ago during a debate with the Ram Paul and Jack Conway Jack
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:08.160]  Conway made it out like that Ram Paul wanted to sell drugs to children because
[02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:12.360]  he said that victim was crying suppose who do you think for the drug war the
[02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:16.120]  people that ship it in they want to keep making the big cash we don't want to
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:21.080]  legalize it we want to decriminalize it cut the money out of it yeah but I think
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:25.320]  this is kind of ironic since this whole deal with his brother and everything and
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:29.760]  now he's accused in Ram Paul and you remember Ron Paul was just talking about
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:34.520]  this a few months ago and you had him on air when he said that people in Texas
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:38.280]  was acting like I wanted to sell drugs to kids and they're trying to yeah that's
[02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:42.920]  another great that's another great point Jeremy does anybody know about the
[02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:47.080]  obstruction of justice situation with Conway in Kentucky no I haven't heard
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:51.160]  anything about it all I can hear is the lies you know they're trying to say that
[02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:56.160]  he wants a 2000 deductible Medicare and they keep continuing these lies on him
[02:49:56.160 --> 02:50:01.920]  and everything it's just I guess it's just open season for him well we're
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:06.000]  gonna we're gonna turn the tables the Cavalry's coming Jeremy Doug is a
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:09.320]  Texas cop we're gonna talk to Doug let's just start going to him now we'll
[02:50:09.320 --> 02:50:11.560]  hold him over Doug in Texas you're on the air
[02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:15.240]  Mr. Jones how you doing today good what do you think of what I'm saying do you
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:21.960]  agree with it oh it's good you know the level I work at in the realm that I work
[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:27.800]  at it this just goes over my head I just I don't understand how this is
[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:32.880]  happening it's just beyond me honestly but am I right I mean this I mean
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:37.240]  clearly obstruction what else is it this is beyond obstruction I mean this goes
[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:41.920]  up and supersedes federal and state level beyond stay there yeah it looks
[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:44.600]  like racketeering because there's so many crimes being committed by a group
[02:50:44.600 --> 02:50:48.320]  stay there we'll come right back to you Doug don't hang up final segment of the
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:52.880]  sour search term Conway cover up I know they're not gonna stop you keep
[02:50:52.880 --> 02:51:01.040]  searching it all day tomorrow the next day push it out there Conway cover up is
[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:05.120]  it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys 18
[02:51:05.120 --> 02:51:09.000]  years ago we developed a program that has made thousands debt free in just 90
[02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:13.520]  days it's called zero debt in 90 days and it works for all credit card debt
[02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:18.360]  medical bills even collection lawsuits when I first joins I was being sued so I
[02:51:18.360 --> 02:51:23.080]  use the program methods and after filing one piece of paper the collection

[02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:40.400]  top link on drudge WFTV it says Daytona Beach Commissioner arrested on fraud
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:44.800]  charges for election fraud at on a beach City Commissioner Derek Henry and his
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:48.720]  campaign managers Genesee's Robinson were arrested Wednesday charged with
[02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:53.280]  committing absentee ballot fraud during Henry's 2010 re-election campaign I
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:57.480]  mean and these stories are just pouring in the vets can't get their ballots and
[02:54:57.480 --> 02:55:03.320]  can't vote voting machines are flipping for Democrats everywhere Doug as a police
[02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:06.840]  officer we're pulling up Kentucky law but it's similar to Texas you know if you
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:10.960]  are a police officer and you warn the Attorney General brother that his
[02:55:10.960 --> 02:55:15.520]  prosecutor brother is about to be raided you warn him and his quotes get your
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:19.200]  house in order get me we're coming in two days then they lied to other
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:22.800]  investigators and said they didn't then they came back said okay we did lie lie
[02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:28.200]  I mean that's obstruction of justice open and shut but what else is it oh that's
[02:55:28.200 --> 02:55:33.200]  uh... this goes on beyond uh... even obstruction this is what we call a
[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:38.520]  federal recall laws which goes from state to state you know even country to
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:43.000]  country so you talking something major and big right here this is something
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:47.640]  that supersedes anything that I'm even on the level of not even knowing quite
[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:54.560]  where to go with it because I I deal with local things uh... you know as is
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:55:59.440]  you know I'm a local undercutting narcotics agent so this is something
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:04.200]  that's just let me ask you this way yeah okay in your town or county of the
[02:56:04.200 --> 02:56:10.320]  prosecutor you've got reports he's dealing drugs and using drugs and if you
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:15.080]  went and warned him that a SWAT raid was coming in two days and then it came out
[02:56:15.080 --> 02:56:19.720]  that you've done that what happened to him all I would be in federal penitentiary
[02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:20.920]  absolutely
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:25.640]  and it would be a quick entry into the fact that country system trust me
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:27.600]  this is just uh...
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:30.160]  all of this this is not going to rest trust me
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:32.720]  uh... you got keep on the bullhorn
[02:56:32.720 --> 02:56:34.640]  this is not going to rest
[02:56:34.640 --> 02:56:38.360]  but when you add to his brother the attorney general and when it's state
[02:56:38.360 --> 02:56:42.600]  level corruption then the feds come in but who are the feds obama
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:45.040]  uh... i'll tell you what uh...
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:48.360]  she goes around the world circles uh... i'm telling you
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:49.960]  i'm sorry i can't be is
[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:53.320]  sharp as i can i've been up on my work in a course
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:55.720]  doing what i do but i'm telling you uh...
[02:56:55.720 --> 02:56:57.840]  this is not going to rest
[02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:01.320]  this is not the end well i agree with you that's what it shows is a racketeering
[02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:03.880]  uh... riko and uh...
[02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:07.480]  it's it's just amazing dog thank you for the call folks this is so big
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:10.560]  and this could make or break i mean you're seeing the attacks on ran get
[02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:11.720]  crazier
[02:57:11.720 --> 02:57:12.840]  every day
[02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:14.880]  and they're always a baloney

[02:57:30.040 --> 02:57:32.600]  of wanting to give kids drugs ran paul
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:35.560]  the fact that he tried to imply he kidnapped some woman thirty years ago
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:36.960]  turned out to not be true
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:38.480]  that he's not a doctor
[02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:41.640]  all the things they've done and then here he is
[02:57:41.640 --> 02:57:42.840]  admittedly
[02:57:42.840 --> 02:57:44.880]  involved with police
[02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:48.880]  warning his brother and then the police getting caught lying and saying we
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:50.280]  didn't do that
[02:57:50.280 --> 02:57:53.680]  and the cops are quoted in here going i just hope i keep my job

[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:00.000]  job

[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.960]  doing things like this it's a higher standard
[02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:10.720]  it's a higher standard because the public thinks you're all corrupt
