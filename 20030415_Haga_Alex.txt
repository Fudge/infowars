[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  ...best-selling, written by six best-sellers. He is an economist, he is, of course, a former prosecutor,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000]  and so he's very well-rounded, and we really appreciate him joining us for the balance of this hour, the next 49 minutes.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  Michael Haga, good to have you on the broadcast with us, sir.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]  Well, I enjoyed... I appreciate you asking me, Alex.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  Is that a right-wing attack dog out here in the background?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]  We'll have to... I'm just joking.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]  There we go.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  You know, I have those two myself. What type of dog is that?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  It's a young Labrador.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]  Oh, how sweet!
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  I'm at home right now. I ran home to do this.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000]  Oh, I appreciate you.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  And so...
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  Oh, no, we're not mad at them barking. We always have dogs barking in the background here on the studio.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  I'm serious. We've got chihuahuas, little creatures.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]  Michael Haga, tell us, for those that don't know, a little bit about yourself,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  and then launch into what we see developing and some of the latest numbers.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000]  About myself, Alex, you're right. I've published six books on economics, basically.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]  Two more are coming out pretty shortly here. One is a novel. Another one is an economics book.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]  Gosh, I graduated from Baylor University Law School while I was working on my MBA down there as well.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000]  Prosecuted for a while in Colorado and then went into healthcare and was with Columbia HCA.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  Still am, basically.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]  So you know all about the scams of the new Senate leader.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]  Oh, yeah.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  And for those that don't know, they had to pay a big fine. That was admitted.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]  Right. The Frisk family founded Columbia HCA.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]  I was their financial administrator, and now it's just HCA.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]  But yeah, the whole thing was a setup. I don't want to get too deeply into it,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.000]  but we will never see our seniors being given the things they deserve.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  Now, I heard you today on The Privacy Factor, a great show that comes on before this one,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  Michael, and I heard you talking about, and I've seen this,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  the airlines got $25 billion pay off by the government, which they could run for two or three years off of.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]  Right.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  And with a total loss, they're really using this economy as an excuse to rip people off, to lay off,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]  and they're saying, okay, we'll keep you on, just give us your pension funds.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  That is huge. Go ahead.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  Yeah, $1.6 billion they want.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]  American Airlines wants their employees to give up their pensions.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]  Can you imagine?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000]  And they're saying basically it's sort of an ax over their heads on the chopping block,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]  and the ax is over their necks, and the airlines is now telling the employees,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  number one, the pensions aren't funded.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]  There's no money in the pension fund for basically 90% of all corporate employees.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]  This is what you said last time, and they made it official.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  They said they're going to cash balance accounts, quote, this is what the White House said,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]  you will no longer own your funds, there will be no liability for them to pay,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]  and now we see the shift coming, and some people, Michael, are still in denial about this.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  Oh, yeah. It was interesting.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000]  My brother-in-law works for American Airlines in the Tulsa facility where they do maintenance on all the big jets,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000]  and we've gotten into arguments about this for years over whether the airline industry would become a casualty in this economy,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  and he laughed.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]  Now he's not laughing.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  Scared to death.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  He doesn't know what he's going to do.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  Can't believe it's happening, but it's happening to everybody, Alex.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  So his brother's writing books about this, and he just laughed at Bubba, didn't he?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  It's real funny.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]  Yeah, I've been the butt of many jokes, but now they're all asking, how did you know?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]  Well, you know, Alex, you're more radical, I think.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]  That's a poor choice of terminology than I am.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]  No, I mean, Jews that fought back in Germany were radical.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]  Yeah. Well, there are signs that things are perhaps, we've been set up and sold out in this country.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  We have.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000]  And if people, have you ever talked about Carol Quigley's book, Tragedy and Hope, a history of the world in our time?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]  Yeah, it's an 800-page book written where he says it's the new world order, we're going to rape you up one side and down the other, ha, ha, ha.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]  Yeah, and that was Dr. Carol Quigley.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]  He was, back when it first came out, he was professor of history at Foreign Service School of Georgetown University, Clinton's mentor.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  Clinton's big mentor.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  Clinton thanked him in the first State of the Union.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  Yeah.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:04.000]  But this whole thing, Alex, look, the plan basically is to have all of us working once again for the general store, for the company store.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]  And we're all going to have our little national ID card, totally surveilled, can be secretly arrested.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]  This is a great new system.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]  Well, you know, that's what's coming.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  People don't understand it, don't believe it.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  But the wealth of what was once the middle class is being eroded right before our eyes.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  We are becoming a nation of either extremely wealthy or super rich people.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]  You're either in one class or the other.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]  You're a have-not or you're super rich.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]  The middle class is shrinking every year.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.000]  They are slowly becoming part of the non-existent, what, serf class, slave class?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]  They're losing everything.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  And yet they still don't seem to understand what's happening to them.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:04.000]  You know, if the great masses would ever wake up and we'd get honest people in Congress by people voting, maybe we'd have a chance, but I don't see it coming.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]  People are too, what, dumbed down?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]  Well, we see a federal move, too, to put in these touch screen systems, which are guaranteed to be fraud.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]  When we've proven that in many states that have done it, federally funded, federally controlled, no record.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]  They've got federal money to take over the churches.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]  They're federalizing local police departments through control and regulation.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]  I mean, they're going down the line of everything you do to set up a dictatorship.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  Oh, you bet.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  Look at this.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]  We hear the argument over and over again about separation of church and state.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]  No religious monuments in any public building.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000]  And yet every church, well, I shouldn't say every church, but probably 99.9% of all churches are 501C3 corporations.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]  They share their information.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.000]  If you tithe to a 501C3 church, nonprofit church, they share your tithing information with the IRS every year.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]  So talk about separation of church and state.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]  They own the churches.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  And they did this just 50 years ago going, oh, yeah, you get your tax exempt.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]  Just sign this little form.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]  It's a formality.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]  We're all trusting now that you can't say anything about the government.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]  You work for us, by the way.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]  And that's what's happened.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  So it's just a process.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]  We're being domesticated.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  We are being prepared to become a third world country in which we really have very few rights.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]  And you see it through the economy, Alex.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  We were taught, our generation and the current generation, debt is good.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  Go into debt.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  They push credit cards off on young kids and, you know, home mortgages.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  If you own something free and clear in America, it's anti-American.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]  You should owe money on it.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]  Also, with the property tax, it's almost impossible.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]  You don't even really own it anyways.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  No, you don't.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]  They can take it any time that you don't pay that tax.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:15.000]  But we have been slowly dumbed down to accept all of these encroachments in our personal freedoms and liberties.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]  And Congress has done it.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  We've gotten the professionals in Congress that will strip our military bases and do whatever it takes, like the war right now.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  We sent our troops in harm's way while we're cutting VA benefits.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]  Yeah, and then I talk about how the federal court ruled they're taking all benefits from 65 and older,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]  and people deny it when I'm reading the federal ruling.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  Stay there.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]  I mean, folks, you're going to find out real soon.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]  We're not making this up.
[00:08:45.344 --> 00:09:01.384]  Thanks for listening to the M2K talk archives and we are a listener supported with the honors
[00:09:01.384 --> 00:09:02.384]  system.
[00:09:02.384 --> 00:09:03.984]  We ask that you wait.
[00:09:03.984 --> 00:09:10.204]  Don't donate a dollar at a time PayPal charges a 35 cent surcharge on anything of a dollar
[00:09:10.204 --> 00:09:11.204]  or less.
[00:09:11.204 --> 00:09:14.824]  Wait till you listen to five or ten and then donate please.
[00:09:14.824 --> 00:09:17.184]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[00:09:17.184 --> 00:09:18.184]  Don't worry.
[00:09:18.184 --> 00:09:19.184]  This show is documented.
[00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.184]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:21.184]  I fell into a burning red hot fire.
[00:09:21.184 --> 00:09:22.184]  A level of smoke.
[00:09:22.184 --> 00:09:23.184]  We've seen them do it in hundreds of thermal countries.
[00:09:23.184 --> 00:09:39.544]  Is it really any surprise that powerful people want total control and more power and more
[00:09:39.544 --> 00:09:40.544]  control?
[00:09:41.264 --> 00:09:45.584]  But somehow they've engineered it into the average American's mind or psyche that oh
[00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:48.784]  no corruption in government doesn't exist or you can't fight it or oh that's just the
[00:09:48.784 --> 00:09:49.784]  way it is.
[00:09:49.784 --> 00:09:53.904]  Folks that's a recipe for it to go right to the bottom as quickly as possible for tyranny
[00:09:53.904 --> 00:09:56.224]  to wax greater and greater.
[00:09:56.224 --> 00:10:00.524]  We've got to have a renaissance or the globalists will take everything you've got blame it on
[00:10:00.524 --> 00:10:08.184]  some foreign enemy and then have you cheering them as they economically suck you dry.
[00:10:08.184 --> 00:10:10.384]  Michael Hague how do we stop this thing?
[00:10:10.384 --> 00:10:16.944]  How do we educate people and more importantly as importantly who are the globalists and
[00:10:16.944 --> 00:10:18.184]  what are their main mechanisms?
[00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:22.184]  We know it's debt but how does this whole scam work?
[00:10:22.184 --> 00:10:29.664]  Well the whole scam Alex comes through the International Monetary Fund and you've got
[00:10:29.664 --> 00:10:38.264]  world central bankers that belong to the fund that all create wealth based on debt and think
[00:10:38.264 --> 00:10:48.344]  about if you hawk your home to the bank you're basically living in something that's owned
[00:10:48.344 --> 00:10:54.584]  by someone else right?
[00:10:54.584 --> 00:11:04.264]  We've been taught and we're being taught worldwide as globalism continues in all of these countries
[00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:13.584]  to take on debt to get what you want now but in the end it comes back to bite you because
[00:11:13.584 --> 00:11:19.444]  by the time you realize you've been had you're owned.
[00:11:19.444 --> 00:11:21.704]  You have no wiggle room.
[00:11:21.704 --> 00:11:30.784]  They tell you what to do they being the powerful money people and you know you can get into
[00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:34.664]  the Rockefellers and go you know the Goldmans and...
[00:11:34.664 --> 00:11:39.944]  Well I just know this while we're all busy debating Hillary and George Bush these are
[00:11:39.944 --> 00:11:45.144]  puppets the globalists own the economy own the intelligence agencies own the universities
[00:11:45.144 --> 00:11:49.904]  they set up the system and it's a joke while we all debate mindless petty issues they're
[00:11:49.904 --> 00:11:54.944]  just setting up this new casual society slave pen for us.
[00:11:54.944 --> 00:12:01.744]  They are and basically we complain about privacy and lack of privacy nothing's private
[00:12:01.744 --> 00:12:09.584]  anymore if you've got the power you can find out anything you want power today information
[00:12:09.584 --> 00:12:17.944]  is power and the wealthy people control the information and they disperse it through media
[00:12:17.944 --> 00:12:25.464]  outlets you know like the Today Show and all these sitcoms that we're told what to
[00:12:25.464 --> 00:12:26.464]  think.
[00:12:26.464 --> 00:12:31.104]  Yeah and that's a good point the sitcoms the dramas we just heard about a Keebler you know
[00:12:31.104 --> 00:12:36.784]  ad with the elf retina scans to get into the tree I mean our kids are being totally brainwashed
[00:12:36.784 --> 00:12:41.064]  sure that they're setting up this horrible system laughing at us and people don't even
[00:12:41.064 --> 00:12:43.224]  know they're being propagandized.
[00:12:43.224 --> 00:12:49.704]  We're referred to as Joe and Jane six-pack we have a six-pack of beer and the TV and
[00:12:49.704 --> 00:12:57.144]  we're happy that's that's what the wealthy refer to the working class in America as being
[00:12:57.144 --> 00:13:03.304]  and unfortunately for the most part it's true because we're down in the trenches trying
[00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:08.744]  to make a living don't see the big picture above us and it will incrementally let them
[00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:12.184]  tell us what to do I mean it's just going to get worse and worse you know how many lives
[00:13:12.184 --> 00:13:16.544]  we can have where we can live sure no more bill of rights as we were never taught what
[00:13:16.544 --> 00:13:21.544]  our bill of rights was well we've got to get the guns away from them though to finally
[00:13:21.544 --> 00:13:26.544]  have the final takeover and that's the whole second amendment battle and I'm sure you heard
[00:13:26.544 --> 00:13:33.344]  Bush backs renewing ban on assault weapons oh yeah but but oh he's conservative actually
[00:13:33.344 --> 00:13:41.504]  more inroads have been made into the loss of our rights through the conservative parties
[00:13:41.504 --> 00:13:47.304]  than the liberal party isn't that amazing we always blame the liberals but that the
[00:13:47.304 --> 00:13:53.344]  republicans and I've always been a conservative I used to be a republican now I'm independent
[00:13:53.344 --> 00:13:59.704]  but they actually get through the legislation that takes our right many many times more
[00:13:59.704 --> 00:14:04.544]  often nothing's said about it but then well it's like Bush he took all controls off supercomputers
[00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:09.144]  in China ten times what Clinton did and it's asked so what Clinton it's incredible it's
[00:14:09.184 --> 00:14:15.384]  evil these neocons they're really the commies if you want to use that paradigm term but
[00:14:15.384 --> 00:14:21.064]  but so so I mean take Michael Savage I mean he's an admitted beatnik uh you know wants
[00:14:21.064 --> 00:14:24.904]  to put people quoting camps if they criticize the government I got him on tape now saying
[00:14:24.904 --> 00:14:30.744]  and he calls that conservative yeah yeah well that's unfortunately if we don't wake up Alex
[00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:36.504]  that's what's coming I mean we're already in debt we're owned right now our country
[00:14:37.064 --> 00:14:44.904]  the wealthiest nation as far as resources in the history of mankind has been auctioned off to the
[00:14:44.904 --> 00:14:49.944]  highest bidders and that's everybody but Americans all right we get back let's talk about some of
[00:14:49.944 --> 00:14:55.064]  the numbers the p-e ratios the debt public private and real solutions and then take some
[00:14:55.064 --> 00:15:00.424]  calls folks you want to talk to Michael Higa we'll take a lot of calls early in this next segment
[00:15:00.424 --> 00:15:09.064]  1-800-259-9231 stay with me we're on the march the empire's on the run
[00:15:09.944 --> 00:15:17.224]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network nuclear reactors provide
[00:15:17.756 --> 00:15:30.076]  The genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[00:15:30.076 --> 00:15:38.675]  a war on for your mind all right we're about to get a friend Mike Marie Casey and others
[00:15:38.675 --> 00:15:45.795]  the number to join us on air talk to Michael Haga 1-800-259-9231 Michael back in March
[00:15:45.795 --> 00:15:49.915]  of last year I interviewed Greg Palast big BBC reporter he talked about Lord
[00:15:49.915 --> 00:15:53.555]  Wacom the head of NM Rothschild who regulates the media over there trying to
[00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:57.476]  stop his reports on this and he got calls from Henry Kissinger trying to
[00:15:57.476 --> 00:16:01.856]  stop him being able to go on American television I mean you've got the you
[00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:05.396]  know a big media guy talking about NM Rothschild hits trying to stop him and
[00:16:05.396 --> 00:16:09.596]  it really is the players and in that interview which a listener transcribed
[00:16:09.596 --> 00:16:12.996]  which subsequently was published in over 400 newspapers that's what Greg even
[00:16:12.996 --> 00:16:16.356]  said here on the air is best-selling book out he was shocked because our
[00:16:16.356 --> 00:16:20.915]  listeners were so active and email that out and got that folks involved but the
[00:16:20.915 --> 00:16:25.636]  point is the World Bank documents said and the head of it the chief economist
[00:16:25.636 --> 00:16:28.716]  quit Joseph Sickles said I'm gonna be part of this but they want to implode
[00:16:28.716 --> 00:16:32.956]  economies they want to quote create riots then use federalized riot police
[00:16:32.956 --> 00:16:36.596]  to crack down instead of a police state it's really a recipe for total
[00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:41.435]  dehumanization and domination and then we have these documents and the average
[00:16:41.435 --> 00:16:45.435]  American just has no idea they plan to do that to the American people and have
[00:16:45.435 --> 00:16:49.476]  been setting it up number one did you hear about those World Bank documents
[00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:54.036]  and number two what would you do to try to stop this in solutions yeah I've
[00:16:54.036 --> 00:16:57.836]  heard about the World Bank documents and it's true I mean I can go through a
[00:16:57.836 --> 00:17:02.316]  whole history of the Federal Reserve System it's not federal it has no
[00:17:02.316 --> 00:17:08.636]  reserves it's a private entity it consists of 12 national banks now this
[00:17:08.636 --> 00:17:13.116]  is just the American system system but the only one of any significance is the
[00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:17.876]  the National Bank in New York and that's the New York Bank it's always been
[00:17:17.876 --> 00:17:21.116]  managed by somebody completely congenial to the interest of the
[00:17:21.116 --> 00:17:27.196]  international bankers but it's important that folks understand in America that
[00:17:27.196 --> 00:17:32.636]  the Federal Reserve System is not a bona fide government agency technically the
[00:17:32.636 --> 00:17:37.116]  stock is owned by 12 national banks which received a dividend of 6% each
[00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:41.916]  year any profits from the system are supposed to be turned over to the US
[00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:48.475]  Treasury but in fact and the president appoints seven members of the board of
[00:17:48.475 --> 00:17:53.396]  the Federal Reserve Board for 14 year terms well the shareholders are private
[00:17:53.396 --> 00:18:00.516]  yeah so it's the money it is it's the Rothschild the Rockefellers the
[00:18:00.516 --> 00:18:05.956]  Warbirds you know the list goes on and on and these are the same folks or the
[00:18:05.956 --> 00:18:10.996]  ancestors of the same folks who had the secret meeting in 1910 on Jekyll Island
[00:18:10.996 --> 00:18:19.436]  and then got finally through Congress with the aid of oh who was that Woodrow
[00:18:19.436 --> 00:18:24.076]  Wilson well Wilson realized at the end he'd been had got killed yeah but it was
[00:18:24.076 --> 00:18:32.516]  Senator Aldrich yeah and but the stage was set and so in December 22nd 1913 the
[00:18:32.516 --> 00:18:36.116]  Federal Reserve Act was passed by the house to represent we got the income
[00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:40.316]  tax to pay into the private banks right and and so we got the tax and spend
[00:18:40.316 --> 00:18:45.676]  legislation we got the control we got everything and Woodrow Wilson it's
[00:18:45.676 --> 00:18:55.116]  amazing when you read his history he said in his in his memoirs there's
[00:18:55.116 --> 00:18:59.916]  something phony about the smokescreen of offer of opposition the bankers appeared
[00:18:59.916 --> 00:19:04.316]  to be opposing the Federal Reserve but he said quote these interviews with
[00:19:04.316 --> 00:19:09.076]  bankers led me to an interesting conclusion I perceived gradually through
[00:19:09.076 --> 00:19:14.516]  the haze and smoke of controversy that the banking world was not really as much
[00:19:14.516 --> 00:19:21.596]  opposed to the bill as it pretended to be and in fact wanted it and and that's
[00:19:21.596 --> 00:19:26.596]  what their masters of is Bush acts like oh the UN did not for our war and the
[00:19:26.596 --> 00:19:30.475]  UN's gonna get all the oil and run it and play the part of the good cop it's
[00:19:30.475 --> 00:19:34.676]  the same thing it's totally staged this Republican Democrat thing it's totally
[00:19:34.676 --> 00:19:39.396]  staged yeah there are no Republicans or Democrats they're both working for the
[00:19:39.396 --> 00:19:43.796]  same cause you have to understand that and all of these guys in Congress well
[00:19:43.796 --> 00:19:49.636]  with the exception of a few have sold out and they sold out because there's so
[00:19:49.636 --> 00:19:58.636]  much money behind the scenes imagine Alex if you had suddenly access to
[00:19:58.636 --> 00:20:04.636]  indescribable wealth what you would do if you would just simply sell out your
[00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:09.876]  people very few people would say no to that and see a lot of it just a lot of
[00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:12.516]  them see it as just a good ol boy network and oh that's the way it's always
[00:20:12.516 --> 00:20:16.156]  been might as well go along the problem is the real globalists are a bunch of
[00:20:16.156 --> 00:20:21.235]  eugenics Nazi control freaks they really want to dehumanize this they say this
[00:20:21.235 --> 00:20:24.916]  in their policy papers I wish the good old boys that are part of this would
[00:20:24.916 --> 00:20:28.996]  read what the globalists are really doing I mean it is Michael Hager it is
[00:20:28.996 --> 00:20:33.556]  scary I've really looked at it it is the humanization it is technocracy it is
[00:20:33.556 --> 00:20:38.716]  enslavement well look at stars where did it come from all of a sudden we have
[00:20:38.716 --> 00:20:44.316]  another quote virus appearance like communist China is the model for them
[00:20:44.316 --> 00:20:47.596]  for the UN and the world government sure they have mobile death vans and
[00:20:47.596 --> 00:20:51.316]  the globalists give them all the awards and let them into the WTO and give them
[00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:56.556]  all the that's what they want to set up folks in China if you don't work you
[00:20:56.556 --> 00:21:03.196]  don't eat if you don't produce you don't live and that's what's coming you know
[00:21:03.196 --> 00:21:09.275]  we're looked upon as useless eaters or the Chinese look upon their people
[00:21:09.275 --> 00:21:12.796]  Turner called us that yeah I mean he can get away with Hitler quotes and they
[00:21:12.796 --> 00:21:17.036]  call him a liberal and then he's running this Armageddon show on PBS and the
[00:21:17.036 --> 00:21:22.396]  answer is world government biometrics that'll save us lots of police state
[00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:30.436]  movie say yeah and think about control issues as the population expands the
[00:21:30.436 --> 00:21:35.956]  globalists know that they have to keep the population in check so we're going
[00:21:35.956 --> 00:21:40.996]  to be having some big plagues arise all over the world that'll kill off hundreds
[00:21:40.996 --> 00:21:44.596]  of millions of people maybe a couple of billion of course you'll have a big
[00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:50.476]  police state while that happens sure look at our prisons today when we were
[00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:56.196]  locking people up especially in the federal system attached to each federal
[00:21:56.196 --> 00:22:03.916]  facility is a big building that really doesn't have any identifying marks but
[00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:11.596]  inmates or what they call them residents now I believe they work for 20 cents on
[00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:17.275]  the dollar an hour maybe more maybe less but they manufacture things that compete
[00:22:17.275 --> 00:22:21.235]  with the private sector they get government contracts so we're paying to
[00:22:21.235 --> 00:22:26.396]  house the residents the inmates and so they can take our jobs yeah and they're
[00:22:26.396 --> 00:22:36.036]  taking our jobs so it's crazy but we the people I don't know how you wake people
[00:22:36.036 --> 00:22:44.676]  up Alex I know so many people that are still in denial but it's just I suppose
[00:22:44.676 --> 00:22:51.716]  when it happens to you then you know you understand but until that point people
[00:22:51.716 --> 00:22:54.796]  are just oblivious and then and then by then it's too late because your
[00:22:54.796 --> 00:22:57.836]  neighbors not going to listen either right and that's what happened in in
[00:22:57.836 --> 00:23:05.356]  Germany to the Jewish people right even the churches were silent today our
[00:23:05.356 --> 00:23:13.156]  churches are silent because they are corporations controlled by the taxing
[00:23:13.156 --> 00:23:16.556]  authorities and now that controls increasing with a faith-based initiative
[00:23:16.556 --> 00:23:20.596]  you take some calls Fred in South Dakota you're on with Alex Jones and our guest
[00:23:20.596 --> 00:23:25.556]  Michael Hagan best-selling offer go ahead hello there Alex yes Fred welcome
[00:23:25.556 --> 00:23:31.235]  to a lovely day I'd like to ask you yes a few brutally honest questions and
[00:23:31.235 --> 00:23:34.836]  understand these are questions from the heart you know they're brutally honest
[00:23:34.836 --> 00:23:39.716]  mr. Hagan there's a member of the bar Association and at one time a
[00:23:39.716 --> 00:23:46.356]  prosecuting attorney you cannot deny I don't believe that there was a private
[00:23:46.356 --> 00:23:49.716]  franchise this still is private franchise on the heritage called our
[00:23:49.716 --> 00:23:56.676]  laws nobody understands them except a gilded few and as a prosecuting attorney
[00:23:56.676 --> 00:24:03.275]  when these people came in with their IRS personnel with their loaded weapons how
[00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:07.275]  come you didn't have your state police and your sheriff's and then rest at the
[00:24:07.275 --> 00:24:12.916]  border let me let me say one thing I am no longer a member of the bar I realize
[00:24:12.916 --> 00:24:17.755]  that I I quit I got out of it it's corrupt beyond belief well it's a
[00:24:17.755 --> 00:24:23.516]  franchise you know what I said yes it is and you know the laws today are so
[00:24:23.516 --> 00:24:29.156]  complex because the lawyers don't want the populace to understand how simple it
[00:24:29.156 --> 00:24:33.556]  really is yes exactly it's it's a job it's like
[00:24:33.556 --> 00:24:41.196]  security most of Congress our lawyers we just simply abrogated our authority or
[00:24:41.196 --> 00:24:45.036]  our desire to go outside carrying a weapon take care of our own thing and
[00:24:45.036 --> 00:24:50.636]  hired a few people to do that for us that's right hey like petroleum guard
[00:24:50.636 --> 00:24:55.116]  didn't roam let's just go ahead and take over make ourselves King when I went to
[00:24:55.116 --> 00:25:01.636]  law school I was proud I didn't realize at that point how corrupt our system is
[00:25:01.636 --> 00:25:04.556]  mm-hmm well there was a federal judge of the
[00:25:04.556 --> 00:25:08.916]  articles about a month ago hang out and said the country's gone the laws are
[00:25:08.916 --> 00:25:12.676]  gone there is no justice this thing's a fraud it's true that is absolutely
[00:25:12.676 --> 00:25:16.795]  true there is justice if you have money to pay for it what you're saying is
[00:25:16.795 --> 00:25:20.275]  ordered you've got a lawyer who's family you didn't know that you didn't know
[00:25:20.275 --> 00:25:25.716]  well think about it why is it that the average person doesn't have access to
[00:25:25.716 --> 00:25:31.636]  statutes and rules and regulations and you know people say I got right but they
[00:25:31.636 --> 00:25:35.315]  don't know what the bill of rights is it wasn't taught in school no and then all
[00:25:35.315 --> 00:25:40.156]  of our laws are based upon based upon precedent our court cases well I used to
[00:25:40.156 --> 00:25:44.396]  train police officers and I used to get mad if they couldn't tell me what the
[00:25:44.396 --> 00:25:48.956]  Ninth Amendment was yeah that's what I trained that's what I produced most
[00:25:48.956 --> 00:25:54.356]  lawyers cannot even tell you what the amendments are and they're not a favor
[00:25:54.356 --> 00:26:02.956]  they are absolutes well they don't want to know because for them the the
[00:26:02.956 --> 00:26:07.876]  fine-tuning that continues daily under what's called precedent law setting
[00:26:07.876 --> 00:26:11.956]  precedent you know the law changes it yeah I mean what they're saying now as
[00:26:11.956 --> 00:26:17.716]  well in World War two we executed nine Nazis secretly so now if anyone
[00:26:17.716 --> 00:26:21.996]  commits a terrorist act we can execute citizens but then they didn't expand the
[00:26:21.996 --> 00:26:25.676]  definition of terrorists any action that endangers human life it's a violation of
[00:26:25.676 --> 00:26:29.356]  any federal or state law and then that's not good enough in Patriot Act one
[00:26:29.356 --> 00:26:31.996]  Patriot Act two which they're already implementing despite they haven't passed
[00:26:31.996 --> 00:26:35.916]  it says any reason you don't have to commit a crime Michael I've read the
[00:26:35.916 --> 00:26:39.956]  bill twice it says you don't have to commit a crime to fall in as a
[00:26:39.956 --> 00:26:44.356]  terrorist that's true and the subsection says they can execute you thanks for the
[00:26:44.356 --> 00:26:49.196]  call Fred comments on on the Patriot Act I mean this thing is Hitler didn't have
[00:26:49.196 --> 00:26:53.876]  the nerve to put this down on paper Mike no and and it's scary that the majority
[00:26:53.876 --> 00:26:59.315]  of the people in the country seem to be behind it here in the newspaper that oh
[00:26:59.315 --> 00:27:03.156]  it's a new security thing for your safety yeah anything for safety today
[00:27:03.156 --> 00:27:08.315]  you know we have more laws on the books today than ever and we have less
[00:27:08.315 --> 00:27:12.116]  security than we've ever had hey the bigger the drug war gets the more drugs
[00:27:12.116 --> 00:27:15.196]  on the street that's right the more school funding the dumber the kids Mike
[00:27:15.196 --> 00:27:21.036]  well go ahead well one thing you stated in the beginning about wars in the last
[00:27:21.036 --> 00:27:26.876]  three thousand four hundred and twenty one years we've only had 248 years when
[00:27:26.876 --> 00:27:32.476]  there was wasn't a war somewhere in the world but the globalists call it and
[00:27:32.476 --> 00:27:39.196]  quickly talks about this in his book perpetual war for perpetual peace think
[00:27:39.196 --> 00:27:44.556]  about that well that's 1984 talk yeah because you're creating number one you're
[00:27:44.556 --> 00:27:53.795]  liquidating people you are creating work debt debt and you know and control and a
[00:27:53.795 --> 00:27:57.295]  unifying distraction and a unifying distraction let's talk to Mike in
[00:27:57.295 --> 00:28:00.235]  Tennessee Mike you're on the air welcome go ahead sir
[00:28:00.235 --> 00:28:05.196]  hey greetings in the name of our Savior Lord Jesus Christ I've got a question

[00:28:09.275 --> 00:28:13.836]  you provided stock this issue I can go research the policy of Ike what's the
[00:28:13.836 --> 00:28:17.516]  best thing to do to protect your pension plan can't do anything at all thank
[00:28:17.516 --> 00:28:20.596]  yourselves cut down a little I'm sorry I forgot I told me you were on cell Mike
[00:28:20.636 --> 00:28:25.156]  say it again what's your question or comment okay I was just quickly I was
[00:28:25.156 --> 00:28:29.596]  just want to know can we do to take our pension plan I work for a foreign
[00:28:29.596 --> 00:28:35.396]  company and other than putting my job in city fire for what cashed out
[00:28:35.396 --> 00:28:40.795]  anything any other alternative what can he do to protect his pension fund yes he
[00:28:40.795 --> 00:28:45.275]  works for a foreign company is it is it oil security give us a vague idea they're
[00:28:45.275 --> 00:28:49.636]  migrating tell us the name of the company there is a new there's a new
[00:28:49.636 --> 00:28:55.516]  regulation that allows you to shift your 401k into a plan that you can
[00:28:55.516 --> 00:29:00.716]  control Midas resources has that information I would call them and get
[00:29:00.716 --> 00:29:07.795]  you know that's a good point dad gives that out for free at 800-686-2237 and
[00:29:07.795 --> 00:29:11.996]  you can move it into something you can control personally what about two years
[00:29:11.996 --> 00:29:16.556]  ago Michael actually about about six months ago okay well then I guess it was
[00:29:16.556 --> 00:29:22.396]  another regulatory change right now it's not so the globalists can move
[00:29:22.396 --> 00:29:24.755]  their money around because I don't see a lot of people taking advantage of that
[00:29:24.755 --> 00:29:30.275]  new system you know it's it's it's a loophole and it's something that people
[00:29:30.275 --> 00:29:35.956]  should take advantage of periodically these guys test the waters to see how
[00:29:35.956 --> 00:29:40.556]  frightened people are so they'll pass legislation like this to see if people
[00:29:40.556 --> 00:29:46.356]  are panicking out of the system or not so far nobody seems to care all right so
[00:29:46.356 --> 00:29:52.356]  they know they really got him thanks for the call Mike let's talk to Marie in
[00:29:52.356 --> 00:29:55.235]  Pennsylvania you're on the air with Michael Hagar our guest go ahead Marie
[00:29:55.235 --> 00:29:59.596]  hello I'm having a terrible time picking up your station today I just picked up
[00:29:59.596 --> 00:30:08.795]  about 20 minutes ago okay okay last night our local Green Party was with the
[00:30:08.795 --> 00:30:14.476]  backing of the Berks community here has put forth a resolution to City Council
[00:30:14.476 --> 00:30:23.876]  to not enforce the Patriot Bill and we were supposed to go over it and pass it
[00:30:23.876 --> 00:30:31.556]  last night and we were told that it was on the docket but when over 35 people
[00:30:31.556 --> 00:30:36.596]  from our peace committee came they told us no it wasn't on the docket it'll be there
[00:30:36.596 --> 00:30:41.755]  two weeks from then but what they also did is they added a third page which
[00:30:41.755 --> 00:30:48.596]  watered down quite a bit of the other two pages just joined us hundreds of
[00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:52.556]  cities and now a lot of conservative cities as well are opposing the Patriot
[00:30:52.556 --> 00:30:54.836]  Act and that's good to have it bipartisan because it gives them when a
[00:30:54.836 --> 00:30:58.876]  Democrat gets in the Democrats will still opposed anybody violate the Bill
[00:30:58.876 --> 00:31:05.676]  of Rights that's a good thing but I hope your town in Pennsylvania will pass it
[00:31:05.676 --> 00:31:10.916]  and just keep the pressure on them well then we we will go to Cassie and and
[00:31:10.916 --> 00:31:16.956]  finally to the state smart Michael Hagan that's exciting that people are
[00:31:16.956 --> 00:31:20.716]  trying to take control locally isn't that a key place to kick the feds out
[00:31:20.716 --> 00:31:24.836]  that we announced that this is not our legitimate government that's right that
[00:31:24.836 --> 00:31:32.036]  everything has to be at the local level you know the feds actually only control
[00:31:32.036 --> 00:31:36.795]  that strip of land there that we call Washington DC that's it but through
[00:31:36.795 --> 00:31:40.275]  their federal funding they're contractually getting control right now
[00:31:40.275 --> 00:31:44.795]  they're racing to to maintain their control is that because the system's in
[00:31:44.795 --> 00:31:48.516]  danger of rattling apart they've got to be very careful during this transition
[00:31:48.516 --> 00:31:52.356]  in the total slavery or they could lose control they're worried about it you
[00:31:52.356 --> 00:31:58.315]  bet and it scares me sometimes Alex that people like yourself you know will they
[00:31:58.315 --> 00:32:01.836]  they've tried to take control of the airwaves but there's enough pressure
[00:32:01.836 --> 00:32:08.396]  that keeps them from doing it but it is the local level if people get involved
[00:32:08.396 --> 00:32:11.916]  we can take our country back but we are locked in a death struggle with these
[00:32:11.916 --> 00:32:15.996]  people oh yeah somebody's got to win I mean they're not gonna stop we're not
[00:32:15.996 --> 00:32:19.356]  gonna stop even if you try to stop they're gonna keep feeding on you you've
[00:32:19.356 --> 00:32:25.795]  got to get hardcore as Haga said radical you know I mean I mean what did Mary
[00:32:25.795 --> 00:32:30.636]  Goldwater say extremism and defensive liberties no vice we we've got the
[00:32:30.636 --> 00:32:35.076]  globalists are radical scum they're radically raping you and your family
[00:32:35.076 --> 00:32:39.275]  you've got to radically stand up and tell them you know stop namby-pambying
[00:32:39.275 --> 00:32:43.196]  around you see what I'm saying Michael oh yeah but remember one thing now in
[00:32:43.196 --> 00:32:49.775]  the Great Depression of the 30s was caused by the banking industry they got
[00:32:49.775 --> 00:32:53.315]  everybody deeply in debt and pulled the plug and they shrunk the money supply
[00:32:53.315 --> 00:32:58.036]  and then the banks foreclosed on everything and what happened Roosevelt
[00:32:58.036 --> 00:33:01.956]  stepped up with his new deal with her they're gonna pose as our saviors as
[00:33:01.956 --> 00:33:06.636]  they set the change tighter just like Roosevelt did and we got more
[00:33:06.636 --> 00:33:11.436]  legislation we got Social Security and all this but today people don't realize
[00:33:11.436 --> 00:33:15.476]  you don't own anything in Social Security it can be cut off tomorrow yeah
[00:33:15.476 --> 00:33:19.196]  that it's the next phase of total enslavement stay there we'll talk to
[00:33:19.196 --> 00:33:21.996]  Casey when we get back

[00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:30.430]  selling author Michael Haga we'll tell you about some of the titles of some of his books that are
[00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:34.670]  out there in print here in a second one last caller Casey in Texas you're on the air go ahead
[00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:42.670]  Casey hey uh I'm a high school student right now a senior actually and I just took uh my economics
[00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:47.710]  class last semester and I was taught all the trash about Federal Reserve and everything
[00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:51.790]  I remember my teacher telling us about how it just is and stuff and he wouldn't let us
[00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:55.310]  like there was no way we could really question it we were taught things that didn't make sense
[00:34:56.430 --> 00:35:02.670]  uh it just is yeah it's like uh you know the world is flat and the sea monsters are out there
[00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:09.069]  at the edge and the world is the center of the universe it just is don't ask it's like a literal
[00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:15.549]  false reality of this mindless grueling sports fans but um Mr. Haga any comments to what this
[00:35:15.549 --> 00:35:24.910]  high school students saying we don't fault your teacher or your professor so badly because they
[00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:30.910]  were taught the same thing when I first got into all of this I was amazed I didn't believe it I
[00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:37.630]  thought this is crazy stuff because we're not taught this economists today are simply taught
[00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:45.470]  what I call econometrics computer aided um you punch in numbers garbage in garbage out that's
[00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:56.590]  what economics is today historical economics which is what I went into is a dying field
[00:35:56.590 --> 00:36:02.029]  because you study history along with economics and we begin asking lots of questions and I'm
[00:36:02.029 --> 00:36:07.390]  going to tell you the answers amaze you absolutely uh I mean they're getting rid of
[00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:12.990]  history itself the average person just has no understanding of of what all this means
[00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:17.870]  of political systems it's just literally they're dumbing us down to a level where people don't
[00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:22.830]  even know how to look at the world and make decisions no they don't and and think about
[00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:29.790]  it if you want to control people that's what you want to do you want them to understand
[00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:36.990]  very little and actually know even less yeah it's like in sock in 1984 that they just start
[00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:43.390]  making the language smaller and smaller i mean i you can't even i'm not even that smart now this
[00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:48.830]  is all common sense just ancient feudalism with high-tech manipulation with the same old strongman
[00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:53.870]  same old macavelian tactics 500 years old and you try to explain it and they go what the government
[00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:59.710]  did something wrong once well it's perfect that that's impossible you go well no actually it's the
[00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:05.310]  other way around uh uh thanks for the uh anything else casey actually i was just i was going to

[00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:22.590]  yeah and uh something struck me thinking about george bush and his uh hydrogen car
[00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:30.990]  how that's very similar to hitler ran almost all of nazi activities and was convicted of that
[00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:34.350]  thanks thanks for the call we're supposed to forget about that you know much does go after

[00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:46.270]  except maybe been lying himself well if you look at at world war ii we funded most of our
