[00:00.000 --> 00:09.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Monday, January 3, 2022, and the globalist House of Cards
[00:09.520 --> 00:10.520]  is coming down.
[00:10.520 --> 00:15.520]  This year is history happening now.
[00:15.520 --> 00:22.280]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:22.280 --> 00:32.760]  The other thing for me has been the personal journey of coming to terms with what the World
[00:32.760 --> 00:40.920]  Economic Forum really represents, and I really resisted that people initially were coming
[00:40.920 --> 00:58.440]  to me talking about the great reset, and then you see it being deployed, and a group of
[00:58.440 --> 01:05.160]  Canadians on a podcast the other day sent me some links from WEF to a site, this is one
[01:05.160 --> 01:16.360]  of the last things I tweeted before, and it had an extremely detailed map of all of the
[01:16.360 --> 01:24.120]  policy positions and the actions that the WEF was taking for a huge range of topics, not
[01:24.120 --> 01:32.160]  least of which is COVID-19, and it's a public document that clearly states everybody that's
[01:32.160 --> 01:36.360]  in our little clique, in our club, these are the things that we will think, these are the
[01:36.360 --> 01:41.840]  things that we will say, this is how we will act, and that one was kind of like the icing
[01:41.840 --> 01:48.120]  on the cake, that was, oh, here it is, you know, this is, they're proud of it, they don't
[01:48.120 --> 01:57.680]  hide it, this is the vision, it is a full on globalist totalitarian vision with the money
[01:57.680 --> 02:06.120]  in control, and the whole, I did a lot of political science when I was an undergraduate
[02:06.120 --> 02:13.280]  in the early 80s, and I had read things like about books about transnationalism in the
[02:13.280 --> 02:20.200]  new world order, I found it fascinating but confusing, how could this possibly happen,
[02:20.200 --> 02:26.960]  and now to see it playing out in real time, and in a way in which national sovereignty
[02:26.960 --> 02:35.880]  governments are increasingly irrelevant, yeah, that's the thing that folks got to wake
[02:35.880 --> 02:41.480]  up about, this is not about the vaccine, this is from basically European intellectual
[02:41.480 --> 02:47.360]  inquiry into what the heck happened in Germany in the 20s and 30s, very intelligent, highly
[02:47.360 --> 02:55.560]  educated population, and they went barking mad, and how did that happen, the answer is
[02:55.560 --> 03:00.600]  mass formation psychosis, when you have a society that has become decoupled from each
[03:00.600 --> 03:07.640]  other and has free floating anxiety in a sense that things don't make sense, we can't understand
[03:07.640 --> 03:13.140]  it, and then their attention gets focused by a leader or a series of events on one small
[03:13.140 --> 03:20.480]  point just like hypnosis, they literally become hypnotized and can be led anywhere, and one
[03:20.480 --> 03:25.360]  of the aspects of that phenomena is the people that they identify as their leaders, the ones
[03:25.360 --> 03:31.200]  typically that come in and say, you have this pain and I can solve it for you, I and I alone,
[03:31.200 --> 03:35.560]  okay, can fix this problem for you, okay, then they will lead, they will follow that
[03:35.560 --> 03:41.840]  person, it doesn't matter whether they lie to them or whatever, the data are irrelevant,
[03:41.840 --> 03:46.880]  and furthermore anybody who questions that narrative is to be immediately attacked, they
[03:46.880 --> 03:54.240]  are the other, this is central to mass formation psychosis, and this is what has happened,
[03:54.240 --> 04:00.080]  we had all those conditions, if you remember back before 2019, everybody was complaining,
[04:00.080 --> 04:05.480]  the world doesn't make sense, blah blah blah, and we're all isolated from each other, we're
[04:05.480 --> 04:11.880]  all on our little tools, we're not connected socially anymore, except through social media,
[04:11.880 --> 04:16.360]  and then this thing happened and everybody focused on it, that is how mass formation
[04:16.360 --> 04:19.840]  psychosis happens, and that is what's happened here.
[04:19.840 --> 04:25.680]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, when we come back, Paul Watson has written a very important
[04:25.680 --> 04:31.600]  article with yours truly this morning, that just went live at infowars.com five minutes
[04:31.600 --> 04:38.000]  ago with the Pentagon and the British Ministry of Defense admitting that they are quote creating
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.200]  mass formation psychosis, then when I and Dr. Malone and others point that out, they
[04:43.200 --> 04:48.320]  then use big tech to say it doesn't exist and censor or ban you if you do, we have them
[04:48.320 --> 04:54.320]  red handed in criminal activity using mind control in the public, we could defeat the
[04:54.320 --> 05:01.320]  enemies that have seized control of our governments together.
[05:01.320 --> 05:06.200]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up for what
[05:06.200 --> 05:11.320]  the globalists are doing right now, this is their big offensive, this is their takeover,
[05:11.320 --> 05:15.320]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves,
[05:15.320 --> 05:19.320]  now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[05:19.320 --> 05:24.400]  in the open, their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate
[05:24.400 --> 05:29.120]  power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[05:29.120 --> 05:32.560]  So listen Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for
[05:32.560 --> 05:37.000]  the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear, and when you buy products at infowarsstore.com

[05:55.560 --> 06:25.000]  it keeps us on the air, only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[06:25.000 --> 06:31.880]  Hello my friends, it is happening, the world is waking up to the new world order, it levels
[06:31.880 --> 06:38.480]  never before seen, Dr. Robert Malone sat down with Christy Lee Friday morning, fresh off
[06:38.480 --> 06:45.760]  the Joe Rogan podcast, and said, look, I'm a scientist, I've got medical degrees, but
[06:45.760 --> 06:52.800]  I study a lot of political science as my minor, and I read all these books by historians and
[06:52.800 --> 06:57.800]  individuals saying their world government was being built, and I just couldn't see
[06:57.800 --> 07:02.000]  how they'd have a worldwide technocracy the way they were planning in the 80s, but now
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.880]  we're living it, and what's incredible is you go to the Debo scripts on the website,
[07:05.880 --> 07:10.640]  they say we're authoritarian, they say we're taking over, they have a worldwide globalist
[07:10.640 --> 07:17.200]  authoritarian vision, and that's what it is, and they create the standard plan, and then
[07:17.200 --> 07:24.040]  they roll it out to all the politicians they're bankrolling, many of which over 45 years, how
[07:24.040 --> 07:30.520]  long it's been around, Klaus Schwab has paid and flown them out to the most fancy hotels
[07:30.520 --> 07:36.200]  with the most fancy prostitutes, business deals, everything, the most promising college
[07:36.200 --> 07:41.280]  students, and that's why, whether it's the Governor of California, or whether it's the
[07:41.280 --> 07:48.000]  Prime Minister of England, or whether it is the Prime Minister of New Zealand, it doesn't
[07:48.000 --> 07:58.200]  matter, almost all of them swear allegiance to Klaus Schwab, and why is Klaus Schwab so
[07:58.200 --> 08:07.600]  important? You know who the head of the Bilderberg group has been since the mid-1990s, right?
[08:07.600 --> 08:20.120]  You know who it was before, right? Prince Bernhard, the husband of the Queen of the
[08:20.120 --> 08:28.960]  Netherlands, founder of the Bilderberg group, and when he handed the baton off, who'd he
[08:28.960 --> 08:38.960]  give it to? Klaus Schwab. So now you know why I was crawling over hedge rows in Europe
[08:38.960 --> 08:48.280]  and in the UK and in Germany and in Virginia to get video of these individuals when they
[08:48.280 --> 08:53.800]  would say 20 years ago, even 15 years ago, until Drudge Report linked our videos and
[08:53.800 --> 09:00.160]  articles about 13 years ago, he'd forced them to admit it existed. They said it didn't exist,
[09:00.160 --> 09:06.160]  so talk about vindication. We say Bilderberg group's the most powerful globalist group
[09:06.160 --> 09:10.600]  running the planet and attempting a total takeover very fast in our lives. And then
[09:10.600 --> 09:20.520]  the head of it, while he's the head, going back 40-plus years of the Bilderberg group,
[09:20.520 --> 09:26.000]  he's already gone out and set up the Davos group that is the public PR arm to then go
[09:26.000 --> 09:38.920]  buy and recruit everybody. You have to understand when you see the head of the nation of New
[09:38.920 --> 09:45.560]  Zealand saying, unvaccinated may not leave your homes, and soon we're going to start
[09:45.560 --> 09:51.560]  putting you in camps. But if you're vaccinated, you may have an orgy with 25 people. If you're
[09:51.560 --> 09:55.200]  a new listener and you think that didn't happen, just type in New Zealand, Prime Minister
[09:55.200 --> 10:03.080]  talks about orgies of the vaccinated up to 25. She's not joking. This is a pervert revolution
[10:03.080 --> 10:08.280]  as well to end the family and to have no real connections and no real deep roots. Because
[10:08.280 --> 10:13.200]  let me tell you, you can say orgies are great all day. They're the most dehumanizing thing
[10:13.200 --> 10:20.840]  ever. I've never been in a full blow with like 10 people, but I've been in, I've done
[10:20.840 --> 10:25.280]  it, and it never feels good. That's why I didn't do it very many times. But when you
[10:25.280 --> 10:28.640]  do it, you literally lose your connection because you're supposed to be having sex with
[10:28.640 --> 10:32.560]  somebody you really love, you really care about, not just treating humans like pieces
[10:32.560 --> 10:37.720]  of meat. And that's why that's how their religion operates. Orgies, pedophilia, and then that's
[10:37.720 --> 10:45.000]  just the beginning of it, ladies and gentlemen. I don't know what it was the most empty feeling
[10:45.000 --> 10:51.560]  I ever had when I would have sex with three or four women at a time. And I didn't know
[10:51.560 --> 10:57.760]  why I was like, why was that so, so horrible? And that's when I repented when I was about
[10:57.760 --> 11:03.880]  18 and got on my knees because I was a good person overall. But the sex was evil, folks.
[11:03.880 --> 11:12.560]  I mean, it wasn't some church telling me that. I could feel it. It wasn't good. I mean, I
[11:12.560 --> 11:19.560]  look like, you know, Ryan Gosling or something when I was 18, and I'd literally just go and
[11:19.560 --> 11:24.560]  boom, pick up any women I wanted. And it was so incredibly soulless. And I don't mean to
[11:24.560 --> 11:28.200]  go off on a jag about this. And I'm not telling those stories to act tough or cool. It's like
[11:28.200 --> 11:32.640]  I've said I've paid for abortions because I'm ashamed of it. And yeah, I've had sex
[11:32.640 --> 11:36.040]  with the three, four women at once. And most guys are like, Oh, that sounds incredibly
[11:36.040 --> 11:42.440]  studly and great. I wish I could do it. Well, if you enjoy that, you don't have a soul.
[11:42.440 --> 11:47.680]  Because it's the most empty feeling in the world to sit there and do that because you're
[11:47.680 --> 11:55.920]  not designed to do that. If you're doing that, it means something is fundamentally wrong
[11:55.920 --> 12:02.600]  with your civilization. Because humans are like eagles. They mate for life. It doesn't
[12:02.600 --> 12:06.400]  mean we don't get divorces. It doesn't mean we don't cheat sometimes and that's not good.
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.920]  And we repent of that. The point is, is that we are meant to make big, deep connections
[12:11.920 --> 12:17.480]  with our mates. This is a big deal. So one of the most important rituals before childbirth
[12:17.480 --> 12:21.560]  and childrearing, those are the rituals. The number one thing is having children and raising
[12:21.560 --> 12:25.560]  them up and loving them and being good and sacrificing for them. That is the most powerful
[12:25.560 --> 12:32.960]  ritual there is of humans. Sex is the next one. Fighting and combat is below that. These
[12:32.960 --> 12:38.440]  are the secrets of the universe. Anyways, I went off on a jag about globalists. The
[12:38.440 --> 12:45.600]  point is, is that we were covering Bilderberg in, what was it, Denmark one year. And we got
[12:45.600 --> 12:53.200]  the footage of all this. And all these men came up in the big glass windows laughing
[12:53.200 --> 12:59.400]  at us, giggling at us with their arms around each other, all wearing towels. And the whole
[12:59.400 --> 13:05.040]  joke was, they were inside having sex with a bunch of people and using drugs and it was
[13:05.040 --> 13:09.560]  all, they were just making fun of us. In fact, we got to find that footage somewhere. Because
[13:09.560 --> 13:17.640]  I want to say Klaus Schwab's in the group, folks. I know once he came out on a window
[13:17.640 --> 13:21.400]  in Canada and it was Klaus Schwab at the window looking down when I was bullhorning. We zoomed
[13:21.400 --> 13:28.400]  in, it was him up there. But that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen, is we
[13:28.400 --> 13:35.840]  are identifying the real people, the real people running the show. And they want to
[13:35.840 --> 13:43.200]  dehumanize you and they want to take your humanity away from you. But I remember the
[13:43.200 --> 13:47.360]  times, you know, I mean, I've probably been with multiple women 30, 40 times and I've
[13:47.360 --> 13:51.560]  been with more than two, five, six times. And the first few times you're like, God,
[13:51.560 --> 13:55.480]  that feels incredibly empty. Why does it feel so empty? Well, let me just do it again and
[13:55.480 --> 14:03.000]  see if it doesn't feel empty that time. But again, they want you to be in that emptiness,
[14:03.000 --> 14:09.720]  ladies and gentlemen. They want you to be in that soullessness and that destructiveness
[14:09.720 --> 14:15.840]  and it's not good. And then once you've given your soul up, doing that kind of stuff, because
[14:15.840 --> 14:22.720]  sex is a powerful ritual, then you don't even have any energy until you go do it again and
[14:22.720 --> 14:27.920]  again and do worse things. And thank God, I never went down that path. I've repented
[14:27.920 --> 14:39.440]  here and I have admitted my crimes against humanity. I mean, group sex with women is
[14:39.440 --> 14:43.960]  not good, but killing your kids is on the list way higher. And people say, why do you
[14:43.960 --> 14:48.760]  say that? Because I'm not going to sit up here and say I'm high and mighty. I'm not
[14:48.760 --> 14:52.880]  going to sit up here and say I'm this great person, but I love Jesus and I love God and
[14:52.880 --> 14:56.920]  I went out of this and I've been there and I don't do any of that stuff now. None of
[14:56.920 --> 15:05.760]  it. For a long time, decades, but I know it. And so I'm not going to sit here and tell
[15:05.760 --> 15:09.520]  you that things like that are destructive just because I read it in the book or some
[15:09.520 --> 15:14.480]  preacher told me, who's probably a pervert. I've experienced it. I've lived it. I've
[15:14.480 --> 15:19.480]  done what the globalists do. I've seen it. I've been around it and I can tell you it's
[15:19.480 --> 15:25.240]  nothing but pure death, but I'm going to stop right there. We have such huge news today
[15:25.240 --> 15:33.320]  and I really need to just cover it all here and do the best job I can. But we have just
[15:33.320 --> 15:41.400]  some massive, massive news that is so important. Breaking mass formation psychosis admittedly
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.200]  used by governments as tool of population control and they're using mass formation
[15:46.200 --> 15:51.840]  psychosis to shut everybody down while it's all coming out. That's why they're so scared
[15:51.840 --> 15:55.480]  of you learning what Dr. Malone talked about. I just call it mass psychosis or mass Stockholm
[15:55.480 --> 16:03.240]  syndrome, but they technically call it this Christmas 2021 is over, but she's still got
[16:03.240 --> 16:08.400]  a really great chance to give yourself the gift of free speech and liberty and freedom

[16:59.820 --> 17:03.760]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate
[17:03.760 --> 17:08.840]  world government whose end game once they get control is forced depopulation of the
[17:08.840 --> 17:14.160]  planet. That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging
[17:14.160 --> 17:17.920]  all of you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much
[17:17.920 --> 17:22.820]  danger you and your family are in. The globalists are coming after everybody. They are setting
[17:22.820 --> 17:29.840]  up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist. Ladies and
[17:29.840 --> 17:33.840]  gentlemen, Info Wars is the tip of the spear. Your investment in us over the years buying
[17:33.840 --> 17:37.400]  our products, spreading the word and praying for us has been incredible, but I'm telling

[17:41.520 --> 17:46.040]  world to tyranny. So now everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today

[18:05.760 --> 18:10.960]  this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get online. Alex, I have to promote one
[18:10.960 --> 18:17.120]  thing from one of your cohost Owen Shroyer, Super Metal Violatality and Brain Force Plus.
[18:17.120 --> 18:21.240]  What's those two together? You're an unstoppable tank. Super Metal Violatality really, really
[18:21.240 --> 18:26.600]  works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[18:26.600 --> 18:32.280]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well,
[18:32.280 --> 18:37.560]  but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different.
[18:37.560 --> 18:40.640]  Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay. People are like, why are you selling
[18:40.640 --> 18:43.960]  something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong? That's just how it is. It's
[18:43.960 --> 18:49.720]  how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But yeah,
[18:49.720 --> 19:18.720]  if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[19:19.840 --> 19:27.800]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists. They must first play God. They must first prove
[19:27.800 --> 19:34.480]  that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system. And in a way, they're right. If we let
[19:34.480 --> 19:39.800]  them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures, the
[19:39.800 --> 19:45.240]  evidence is overwhelming and out in the open. We really deserve what's happened to us. So
[19:45.240 --> 19:52.040]  I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the new order even more? I know I'm
[19:52.040 --> 20:18.240]  pledging to step up and redouble my efforts. The front lines of the fight is info wars.com.
[20:22.040 --> 20:45.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to ask all of you listening to this live January
[20:45.240 --> 20:53.440]  3rd, Monday Transmission, the first Alex Jones show of 2022. Wow, an incredible year. We're
[20:53.440 --> 20:59.320]  already in what a nightmare year we just left. There are so many angles to hit so much huge
[20:59.320 --> 21:05.880]  things to say. But the first thing I want to tell you is all you need to do is read the
[21:05.880 --> 21:18.400]  government documents. And there is a extremely important article on info wars.com by Paul
[21:18.400 --> 21:25.800]  Joseph Watson that needs to get maximum readership and maximum shares. And I'm covering it next
[21:25.800 --> 21:35.520]  segment. You know, I had to have them add this morning to the headline that it's exclusive
[21:35.520 --> 21:42.120]  and that it's breaking because people don't pay attention. Let's see, understand this
[21:42.120 --> 21:50.920]  is new. Now imagine Dr. Peter Malone interview with Joe Rogan gets dropped onto the web on
[21:50.920 --> 21:57.440]  Friday. Our interview goes out Friday as well with him. And Joe's goes super viral, ours
[21:57.440 --> 22:02.800]  goes viral. Thank God you're sharing the links. And in it, he talks about mass formation
[22:02.800 --> 22:09.080]  psychosis. Now again, I'm going to cover this in detail next segment. And it gets just on
[22:09.080 --> 22:13.400]  Twitter that I saw more than 15 million views, the different clips. This one had 3 million,
[22:13.400 --> 22:18.880]  this one had 2 million. I sat there and counted it up with pleasure. And I saw the left flipping
[22:18.880 --> 22:24.160]  out saying it doesn't exist. Google in real time editing it and blocking the links and
[22:24.160 --> 22:28.160]  sending it to links of critics that were shooting videos saying it doesn't exist in
[22:28.160 --> 22:32.040]  live time. All the leftist paid YouTubers, you know who they are, the same folks that
[22:32.040 --> 22:39.040]  are on the Pfizer payroll. So the new Pfizer talking points were going out by Friday afternoon.
[22:39.040 --> 22:44.400]  By Saturday, they were blocking the interview everywhere. There it is, Google quickly reset
[22:44.400 --> 22:51.560]  screens results for mass formation psychosis after Bombshell, Dr. Malone, Joe Rogan interview.
[22:51.560 --> 23:01.920]  You can see right there a shot of the M4s interview. So they totally and completely flipped out.
[23:01.920 --> 23:05.520]  Now why did they do that? And again, this is why Alex Jones is different. And I'm not
[23:05.520 --> 23:10.120]  saying I'm that special. I think everybody else should be like me in that I don't think
[23:10.120 --> 23:14.880]  this is that special. I just have a memory. I'm sitting there last night going to bed
[23:14.880 --> 23:24.680]  at about 10pm. Just put my daughter down to sleep my four year old. And my wife's off
[23:24.680 --> 23:37.680]  at rehab. And I'm sitting there. And it clicks and I go wait a minute. I said let me get
[23:37.680 --> 23:41.600]  out of bed. Let me go research for a little while. I went a little bit about an hour research.
[23:41.600 --> 23:51.240]  I went wait a minute. That exact term is used in UK government and US documents about what
[23:51.240 --> 23:54.280]  they're doing with Syops against the American people where they admit they're trying to
[23:54.280 --> 24:04.960]  quote brainwashes. These are quotes and create mass hysteria and fear to control the population.
[24:04.960 --> 24:11.120]  So here's the big takeaway. We just saw Google and Twitter and Facebook and the subsidiaries
[24:11.120 --> 24:18.520]  of YouTube and Instagram and Apple news and all of them all hands on deck to shut down
[24:18.520 --> 24:24.880]  the covert tactics coming out in the news that the military Syops are being used and
[24:24.880 --> 24:36.800]  that technology is being given to major media to brainwash the public. And they even then
[24:36.800 --> 24:41.320]  give interviews later and say the way we've used fear is dystopian. Is it good? We did
[24:41.320 --> 24:46.720]  it. The very people doing it then later write articles admitting they did it. And then when
[24:46.720 --> 24:53.160]  we come out and we say we don't want this. This is evil. This is wrong. There are paid
[24:53.160 --> 24:59.640]  minions everywhere come out and say Dr. Malone's a kook. They don't show proof. They don't show
[24:59.640 --> 25:06.240]  a link. He's nuts. And then just mass psychosis. You see the talking point. He's crazy. It
[25:06.240 --> 25:13.320]  doesn't exist. And you say why do they do that? Because now we're not debating the term
[25:13.320 --> 25:17.800]  they're trying to suppress mass formation psychosis. Really just mass psychosis in the
[25:17.800 --> 25:23.320]  Carl Jung type term. We're debating whether it's real or not. See how they change the
[25:23.320 --> 25:27.720]  subject with the same gaslighting. Yeah, we're going to make everybody take shots to buy
[25:27.720 --> 25:31.960]  and sell leave their houses. Well, hey, we're not for that. Nobody's trying to make you
[25:31.960 --> 25:38.360]  take a shot. They never validate you because they think you're childlike. But as soon as
[25:38.360 --> 25:43.760]  you don't care about validation by them, in fact, you don't want praise from them. As
[25:43.760 --> 25:50.280]  soon as you see attacks and punishment is victory, you're now a winner. The moment you
[25:50.280 --> 25:56.760]  step into you expect to be Christlike and persecuted and that you want the enemy 100%
[25:56.760 --> 26:02.520]  against you, that's when you step into victory. Do the opposite of what they say and you'll
[26:02.520 --> 26:09.240]  be in great step because the one thing these arrogant people can't do is ever admit they're
[26:09.240 --> 26:15.000]  wrong. And they also like to brag how they screwed you over later to themselves so they
[26:15.000 --> 26:23.080]  brag about it. So that's coming up next segment. It's just incredible. Absolutely incredible
[26:23.080 --> 26:31.760]  that I have you see the stat. This is undoubtedly 4050 articles right here. Mainline news Pentagon
[26:31.760 --> 26:43.920]  press releases BBC Forbes, New York Times, Washington Post telling you that they're brainwashing
[26:43.920 --> 26:48.320]  you and creating mass psychosis and using that term and then you go, Hey, I don't want
[26:48.320 --> 26:53.720]  to be under mass psychosis. They go, sweetheart, it don't exist. That's the definition of
[26:53.720 --> 26:58.680]  gaslighting where the man beats up his girlfriend and that's five people say, honey, nobody
[26:58.680 --> 27:03.520]  beat you up. You made it up and she breaks down and cries and goes into a psychosis because
[27:03.520 --> 27:09.000]  she cares too much about their validation. She cares too much about what they said.
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.800]  Look, if I told you I was wearing a pink shirt right now and you see you're watching on TV.
[27:14.800 --> 27:21.240]  I'm wearing a black sweater. No, I'm wearing pink. I'm wearing pink. This microphone's
[27:21.240 --> 27:26.680]  purple. You're like, no, it's not as black to my background is red. No, it's green.
[27:26.680 --> 27:31.320]  Go with your spirit. Go with your eyes. Go with what you know and they know you're doing
[27:31.320 --> 27:35.600]  that. That's why they want to force you in the metaverse where they control things and
[27:35.600 --> 27:40.400]  can start flipping it back and forth to brainwash you. It's all behavioral psychologists that
[27:40.400 --> 27:46.640]  are criminals and are evil and most of them are pedophiles. The orgy cults just the, you
[27:46.640 --> 27:53.840]  know, the, the, the entrance to the door to get you to file yourself and, and, and, and
[27:53.840 --> 27:58.440]  piss God off. So God separates himself from you.
[27:58.440 --> 28:01.560]  So that's all that's going on here, ladies and gentlemen. There's a bunch of sick mental
[28:01.560 --> 28:05.440]  patients that went and got psychology degrees that have pumped all these drugs out and come
[28:05.440 --> 28:09.960]  after our kids and committed all these crimes. And now they're trying to gaslight us and
[28:09.960 --> 28:15.800]  tell us what they've done to us doesn't exist. While they brag in psychology today, how they
[28:15.800 --> 28:23.560]  did it to us for our own good, how they scared us, how they brainwashed us in the noble lie.
[28:23.560 --> 28:27.240]  So the people that kind of halfway wake up to it and get upset, but are still in hypnosis
[28:27.240 --> 28:32.400]  go, well, it's noble. I don't like being a wakeup. They're out of the matrix. Let me
[28:32.400 --> 28:38.120]  sink back down into oblivion.
[28:38.120 --> 28:43.080]  Canadian military saw COVID-19 pandemic as unique opportunity to deploy propaganda on
[28:43.080 --> 28:50.760]  her own population, including brainwashing and fear and mass hysteria, which is the
[28:50.760 --> 28:56.640]  same thing that Dr. Malone is talking about with the mass grouping psychosis. We'll talk
[28:56.640 --> 29:25.640]  about what they don't want you to know straight ahead.

[30:16.040 --> 30:22.240]  mind from the matrix, but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut
[30:22.240 --> 30:29.240]  down American infrastructure and American jobs. It is the true digital economy. It's
[30:29.240 --> 30:36.080]  the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent or control. I've been on air 28 years and
[30:36.080 --> 30:42.440]  all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[30:42.440 --> 30:46.680]  But I got to tell you out of everything I've done, reset wars is the most important and

[30:53.400 --> 30:59.960]  journey to the next level today at resetwars.com. The globalist fear this information.
[30:59.960 --> 31:04.600]  Not just across the United States, but across the world. You see it on the sides of barns
[31:04.600 --> 31:09.280]  and on bumper stickers, on cars and written on the side of bathroom walls. Alex Jones
[31:09.280 --> 31:14.480]  was right. That's become a maximum of people to communicate to others that they see through
[31:14.480 --> 31:18.240]  the fraud of the new world order, that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates and
[31:18.240 --> 31:23.840]  the Great Reset. And so now info wars credibility is stronger than it's ever been. And the globalist
[31:23.840 --> 31:27.920]  are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks and we can't let them
[31:27.920 --> 31:32.880]  do that. So you've invested in info wars over the years. I'm asking you to redouble those

[33:01.800 --> 33:07.640]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[33:07.640 --> 33:26.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance live from Austin, Texas.
[33:26.560 --> 33:35.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Alright, what you get from me is always 100% real.
[33:35.880 --> 33:41.240]  That's my superpower. Is that I tell you straight up what I know and what's going down before
[33:41.240 --> 33:47.600]  I hit mass formation psychosis and why the term is so important for you to understand
[33:47.600 --> 33:53.400]  and grasp and why the system so scared of it. I want to tell you something else. I have
[33:53.400 --> 34:00.560]  been aware of things for a few months that I've not covered on air because I'm very
[34:00.560 --> 34:06.280]  torn by them and I'm usually very, very clear on things when it deals with me. If something's
[34:06.280 --> 34:09.960]  moral for me to do, I'm very clear about what I should do. And I'm most of the time I do
[34:09.960 --> 34:21.120]  the right thing almost always that I get older. I don't know what to do about what I know.
[34:21.120 --> 34:24.960]  I'm very serious about that when I said I know that's not a good trade of talk radio
[34:24.960 --> 34:35.920]  to be indecisive, but I know of training camps around the country where the feds are luring
[34:35.920 --> 34:41.960]  in patriots for they believe the second American revolution that the feds, the globalists want
[34:41.960 --> 34:54.640]  to be violent and they are planning terror attacks ahead of the midterms to bring in
[34:54.640 --> 34:59.000]  martial law. Now, we've known that's coming, but now I've had enough chatter and enough
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.840]  connections and enough people obviously that are useful idiots, but also working for the
[35:02.840 --> 35:10.400]  enemy, some of them trying to rope us into it to where whatever I do, I'm going to make
[35:10.400 --> 35:14.120]  a decision on it, but I'm going to talk about it because I got to warn people just like
[35:14.120 --> 35:27.320]  I warn you about Q and the rest of it. And this is such a big subject that I already
[35:27.320 --> 35:31.640]  got sucked in on January 6, just because every other Trump event had been peaceful.
[35:31.640 --> 35:35.200]  I didn't think to try to check security myself and see what was going down. Once I got the
[35:35.200 --> 35:40.040]  capital, there was no security there, nothing set up, supposedly a stage, we had the permit,
[35:40.040 --> 35:47.560]  all of it, and then all hell broke loose. We're walking into that very fast with 309
[35:47.560 --> 35:52.560]  days of the election and they're going to pull this takeover and this crap well before
[35:52.560 --> 36:11.840]  that. See, here's the deal. Do I just talk about this all on air or do I call the FBI
[36:11.840 --> 36:16.400]  and tell them about their own operation to try to stop it? Because I mean, we even know
[36:16.400 --> 36:21.560]  where this stuff is going on and we know the feds are running and folks are like, well,
[36:21.560 --> 36:28.160]  expose it. I understand that. I just want the listeners to understand that most people
[36:28.160 --> 36:32.720]  would not get in the way of an FBI provocateur operation. If you want to get killed, this
[36:32.720 --> 36:37.920]  is the way to do it. So I'm going to go ahead and do the right thing and I'm not going to
[36:37.920 --> 36:41.920]  wait long to do it, but we need your prayers right now, folks, because we're like I told
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.520]  you 2022 is going to be hell. I'm going to try to stop them from provocaturing Patriot
[36:46.520 --> 36:51.000]  terror attacks and I'm going to try to stop the lockdowns and I'm going to try to stop
[36:51.000 --> 37:03.000]  the whole New World Order and their mass formation psychosis. And I don't feel sorry for myself,
[37:03.000 --> 37:17.480]  but I do feel inadequate because we're here on air covering exactly how everything operates.
[37:17.480 --> 37:25.880]  I mean, here's my problem. It's why I almost didn't do the show today and it's not a drama
[37:25.880 --> 37:31.200]  queen thing. I really gut level feel like I should just leave for a few weeks and like
[37:31.200 --> 37:36.800]  go sit in the woods and my family sees Texas property where my ancestors are from and just
[37:36.800 --> 37:45.320]  really pray for weeks before. Imagine giving a super powerful speech that you know hundreds
[37:45.320 --> 37:49.360]  of millions of people are going to watch and listen to and you know presidents have five
[37:49.360 --> 37:53.440]  or six speech writers. They spend weeks or months writing it and it's all rehearsed over
[37:53.440 --> 37:58.680]  and over again. They deliver these speeches I give are that important and I don't say
[37:58.680 --> 38:04.560]  that from a power trip perspective. It's the opposite in that I don't have a way to get
[38:04.560 --> 38:11.400]  across to you the gravity of the situation I'm in and you're in because I'm somebody
[38:11.400 --> 38:18.600]  that's already made a friend of death. And with that, I mean, I guess the system destroying
[38:18.600 --> 38:23.160]  my family and I pledged a long time ago to do whatever happened no matter what happened
[38:23.160 --> 38:29.400]  and now I'm it's happening. But all I can tell you is this is 100% real folks and you
[38:29.400 --> 38:34.960]  know it now and I know it now and it's just crazy to hear the old timers talk about this
[38:34.960 --> 38:43.200]  and say this was coming and to now actually be inside of it. And then to see other people
[38:43.200 --> 38:50.320]  that don't get how much danger they're in. That's the most frustrating part because if
[38:50.320 --> 38:59.400]  we could just wake people up, we'd be out of this just like that. Just a snap of the fingers.
[38:59.400 --> 39:02.680]  I know I said this segment, I've covered this, I'll cover it next next segment is 11 minutes
[39:02.680 --> 39:07.920]  long, it's the longest segment of the hour. But let me just say what I'm really thinking
[39:07.920 --> 39:12.240]  about here. They're getting ready to stage terror attacks and blaming on all of us. That
[39:12.240 --> 39:15.840]  means you collectively all of us that love freedom and love God and love justice. And
[39:15.840 --> 39:20.880]  that it hoped Trump would be the one. They're already imploded the border. They're killing
[39:20.880 --> 39:23.880]  the dollar. They're devaluing everything. They're making their move. They're starting
[39:23.880 --> 39:33.040]  wars with Russia. They're letting China take over. And they are literally abusing our children
[39:33.040 --> 39:37.640]  in public schools with all sorts of masks and social distancing and brainwashing that
[39:37.640 --> 39:46.120]  they're dirty and they're evil. And they've ramped up all the abortion garbage and all
[39:46.120 --> 39:50.880]  the race war garbage and the defunding the police and the crime waves and all the rest
[39:50.880 --> 39:55.840]  of it. And I'm just sitting here frustrated watching all this happening. And it's just,
[39:55.840 --> 40:03.800]  it's just, it's just incredible. So I really wet the appetite of the establishment last
[40:03.800 --> 40:10.280]  week when I was very clear on what I said, they misrepresented, they misrepresented
[40:10.280 --> 40:16.080]  and said, Jones is going to dish the dirt on Trump's corruption. If he doesn't get
[40:16.080 --> 40:20.640]  straight on vaccines. What I really said was I'm pissed off about Trump going along
[40:20.640 --> 40:29.400]  with these poison shots and doubling down. And that if he continues joining the enemy,
[40:29.400 --> 40:33.520]  he puts himself in their column, and then I've got to go after him. That, that's what
[40:33.520 --> 40:37.920]  I said, not do what I want or I'm going to get you. They misrepresented that. That's
[40:37.920 --> 40:43.280]  not how I operate. And he came out this weekend in a big speech to a big crowd and doubled
[40:43.280 --> 40:47.360]  down and said, take your shots. They're wonderful. They saved lives. There's no side effects.
[40:47.360 --> 40:55.720]  There's the best things. It's mother's milk, all a complete lie. So when I said dish the
[40:55.720 --> 41:07.040]  dirt on Trump, I said not that he's bad or corrupt, but that he is surrounded by corrupt
[41:07.040 --> 41:15.240]  people and that he is getting worse and that he isn't playing 40 or three D chess. He's
[41:15.240 --> 41:20.080]  not even playing checkers because I know the inside baseball. I don't come out and attack
[41:20.080 --> 41:25.200]  his social network because I want it to fail. Hell, I want independent systems that we need
[41:25.200 --> 41:30.240]  that. We got to have that. I'm mad because I know the insiders and the people involved
[41:30.240 --> 41:36.400]  in the SEC investigations and how it doesn't work and how it's a scam and how it's just
[41:36.400 --> 41:41.960]  so pathetic that evil can get organized to build a Twitter or a Facebook or an Instagram
[41:41.960 --> 41:51.160]  or a TikTok, but we can't do it. You know, the World Economic Forum, they can figure
[41:51.160 --> 41:56.280]  it all out, but that's good guys. We just can't ever seem to get it done. You know,
[41:56.280 --> 42:00.640]  M4 Wars had to set up its own systems, its own sites, its own programs, its own streaming,
[42:00.640 --> 42:04.560]  its own satellites, and that may not sound like a lot nowadays when everything's built
[42:04.560 --> 42:09.840]  in, but I've got articles here today. We're major phone carriers and we told you this was
[42:09.840 --> 42:14.000]  the next shoot-a-drop.
[42:14.000 --> 42:22.840]  Are now blocking text from hundreds, including M4 Wars and Gateway Pundit, of sites, not
[42:22.840 --> 42:27.400]  letting you text message people articles. That's the next level and we knew it was coming.
[42:27.400 --> 42:32.120]  They said it was coming and now it's here. So every day you can share articles. Every
[42:32.120 --> 42:36.600]  day you can share videos. Every day you can go to Band-Aught Video and share a report.
[42:36.600 --> 42:41.320]  Every day you can text message or email somebody something. You better do it now because as
[42:41.320 --> 42:44.960]  I told you, they were going to censor Trump off the internet months before the election
[42:44.960 --> 42:51.920]  last year or the year before last now, 2020. This is coming. This is here. This is incrementally
[42:51.920 --> 42:56.120]  being done and we're watching the takeover happen now. We need to wake up to it and use
[42:56.120 --> 43:00.280]  our human intelligence to shut it down.
[43:00.280 --> 43:06.960]  Christmas 2021 is gone. It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of

[46:16.280 --> 46:21.000]  to count the cost and to realize how much danger you and your family are in. The globalist
[46:21.000 --> 46:27.320]  are coming after everybody. They are setting up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy,
[46:27.320 --> 46:32.360]  a dictatorship of the globalist. Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars is the tip of the spear.

[46:43.880 --> 46:48.440]  done in the past needs to be redoubled today. And InfoWarsStore.com is one of the most important
[46:48.440 --> 46:52.680]  places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip of the spear. I will go down
[46:52.680 --> 46:55.880]  with the ship. I'm not going to back down. I'm getting even more hardcore in their face.
[46:55.880 --> 47:12.000]  But I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless you support us. So please go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[47:12.000 --> 47:25.560]  Welcome back to the Unshown Show. Mass Formation Psychosis. A term Dr. Robert Malone last week
[47:25.560 --> 47:30.840]  talked about with Joe Rogan and with InfoWars, two different powerful podcasts. You can find
[47:30.840 --> 47:37.280]  the full interview with Christie Lee and Robert Malone at InfoWars.com or by going to freeworldnews.tv
[47:37.280 --> 47:43.440]  or bandodvideo. And the system is fighting around the clock to suppress this information.
[47:43.440 --> 47:49.480]  And yeah, it's got a million, seven, five thousand views. It needs to have 20 million
[47:49.480 --> 47:55.760]  views we're going to win. But it's gotten that over on Joe's platform. And so that's
[47:55.760 --> 48:03.520]  really what matters. One way or another, we're going to get the globalists. One way or another,
[48:03.520 --> 48:08.240]  I'm going to get you, get you, get you. So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:08.240 --> 48:13.840]  But here he is talking about it before I actually cover it in the documents because they're
[48:13.840 --> 48:20.520]  so scared of this. I mean, no exaggeration on Twitter, at least 15 million views of this
[48:20.520 --> 48:23.040]  clip you're about to see here it is.
[48:23.040 --> 48:29.960]  It's from basically European intellectual inquiry into what the heck happened in Germany
[48:29.960 --> 48:34.640]  in the 20s and 30s. Very intelligent, highly educated population, and they went barking
[48:34.640 --> 48:42.800]  mad. And how did that happen? The answer is mass formation psychosis. When you have a
[48:42.800 --> 48:49.600]  society that has become decoupled from each other and has free floating anxiety in a sense
[48:49.600 --> 48:55.600]  that things don't make sense, we can't understand it. And then their attention gets focused by
[48:55.600 --> 49:02.440]  a leader or a series of events on one small point just like hypnosis. They literally become
[49:02.440 --> 49:08.120]  hypnotized and can be led anywhere. And one of the aspects of that phenomena is the people
[49:08.120 --> 49:13.360]  that they identify as their leaders, the ones typically that come in and say, you have this
[49:13.360 --> 49:20.120]  pain and I can solve it for you. I and I alone can fix this problem for you. Then they will
[49:20.120 --> 49:25.560]  follow that person. It doesn't matter whether they lie to them or whatever. The data are
[49:25.560 --> 49:31.960]  irrelevant. And furthermore, anybody who questions that narrative is to be immediately attacked.
[49:31.960 --> 49:39.360]  They are the other. This is central to mass formation psychosis and this is what has happened.
[49:39.360 --> 49:45.120]  We had all those conditions. If you remember back before 2019, everybody was complaining
[49:45.120 --> 49:50.160]  the world doesn't make sense, blah, blah, blah. And we're all isolated from each other.
[49:50.160 --> 49:57.000]  We're all in our little tools. We're not connected socially anymore, except through social media.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.480]  And then this thing happened and everybody focused on it. That is how mass formation
[50:01.480 --> 50:05.600]  psychosis happens. And that is what's happened here.
[50:05.600 --> 50:12.320]  And that is what's happened here. And then it turns out I have at least 20, 30 mainstream
[50:12.320 --> 50:19.560]  news articles bragging how they quote brainwashed and created mass fear and hysteria to control
[50:19.560 --> 50:26.200]  the public during COVID-19 all over the world. But oh, now Twitter and Google and Facebook
[50:26.200 --> 50:32.480]  and all of them are censoring that term and don't want people to know about mass formation
[50:32.480 --> 50:38.400]  psychosis, which is just mass psychology, mass psychosis, mob rule, what I call mass
[50:38.400 --> 50:45.360]  Stockholm syndrome. That's my term. So here it is. What is mass formation psychosis?
[50:45.360 --> 50:51.320]  Arm alone makes COVID-19 vaccine claim on Joe Rogan. Well, I mean, it is mass psychosis
[50:51.320 --> 50:54.920]  that a mask doesn't protect you, but you think it does. And the system admits they're using
[50:54.920 --> 51:01.000]  it as a fear symbol. I mean, they admit that. I'm going to show you that. But that's the
[51:01.000 --> 51:06.280]  thing that they don't want you to be analytical and know the facts. They want to scare you
[51:06.280 --> 51:15.200]  into submission. Here's another one. Opinion. How have we gotten here mass formation psychosis?
[51:15.200 --> 51:20.000]  Take article out before the Joe Rogan interview, laying that out. Now, here's some from a year
[51:20.000 --> 51:28.040]  ago. One in Telegraph. Use of fear to control behavior in COVID crisis was totalitarian.
[51:28.040 --> 51:35.160]  Admit scientists who were part of the program. Here's another one. Military leaders saw pandemic
[51:35.160 --> 51:39.440]  as a unique opportunity to test propaganda techniques of Canadians. The forces report
[51:39.440 --> 51:43.920]  says to lock you in your homes, to keep you in total fear, and to make you submit to the
[51:43.920 --> 51:52.000]  system. That is out of the Ottawa citizen, the major paper there in the capital of Canada.
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.860]  What is mass formation psychosis? Robert Malone. Again, it breaks it now. Here's the
[51:56.860 --> 52:06.160]  Daily Mail from April of last year. Now, the covert tactics used to scare Britain's into
[52:06.160 --> 52:13.280]  staying at home. How SAGE document called for increase in perceived threat of COVID using
[52:13.280 --> 52:23.320]  hard hitting emotional messages. And it goes into the terms mind control and brainwashing.
[52:23.320 --> 52:27.720]  In the UK government document, I'm going to show you in a moment. That is how you invoke
[52:27.720 --> 52:37.120]  mass psychosis. Telegraph. State of fear. How ministers use covert tactics. Covert tactics.
[52:37.120 --> 52:40.400]  No, it's all out in the open. You know what you're looking for. To keep scared public
[52:40.400 --> 52:46.160]  in home. Chicken little scenario to break down the economy, lock down the world to bring
[52:46.160 --> 52:49.840]  in the post-industrial world. There's a whole article how they're using psychological terms
[52:49.840 --> 52:56.520]  to control you. Propaganda expert words of global COVID sigh up. Citizen journal. Excellent
[52:56.520 --> 53:02.920]  report. Here's one out of CBC. That's the government channel in Canada. Military campaign
[53:02.920 --> 53:08.920]  to influence public opinion continued after defense chief shut it down. The defense chief
[53:08.920 --> 53:13.360]  shut it down, said it was illegal, later resigned. They didn't care. They're the rogue government.
[53:13.360 --> 53:18.200]  They engaged in lies. They engaged in fear to bring in a permanent martial law system
[53:18.200 --> 53:23.360]  which we're now entering. I've got a stack on that coming up. Here's the actual report
[53:23.360 --> 53:28.480]  out of the British government. Options for increase adherence to social distancing measures
[53:28.480 --> 53:35.480]  put out on how to brainwash and create fear and mass conditioning. Exactly what we're
[53:35.480 --> 53:43.200]  talking about. COVID coercion. Boris Johnson's psychological attack on the UK public. COVID
[53:43.200 --> 53:50.040]  19. The brainwashing techniques used are identical to those of the sex. Serious brainwashing
[53:50.040 --> 54:02.640]  sex. That's mainline news. COVID 19, a psychological military operation. And it goes on and on.
[54:02.640 --> 54:07.880]  Stop now is the world's biggest psychological experiment. And we are going to pay the price.
[54:07.880 --> 54:13.480]  You have brainwashed children, lower IQs, mass suicide. The globalists are killing us.
[54:13.480 --> 54:17.560]  Not to protect us from a virus that they cooked up at Llan and released. The biggest psychological
[54:17.560 --> 54:25.680]  experiment history is running now. Scientific American. They admit they're doing it. Canadian
[54:25.680 --> 54:32.600]  military saw COVID 19 pandemic as a unique opportunity to deploy propaganda on own population.
[54:32.600 --> 54:37.920]  And the military attacking its own population. They've had top Pentagon officials that have
[54:37.920 --> 54:42.040]  retired come out and say they were ordered to use techniques that were banned against
[54:42.040 --> 54:52.680]  Al Qaeda against the American people. Remember that OEN report? COVID hit Canadian provinces.
[54:52.680 --> 54:57.280]  Insinuates vaccine passport system as healthcare leaders call for aggressive action in military
[54:57.280 --> 55:06.160]  aid. Now the military is taking over the hospitals here in the U.S. It's all there. Canada military
[55:06.160 --> 55:15.920]  conducted a sigh up against Canadians. See? New details emerge of Canadian military's plan
[55:15.920 --> 55:20.960]  to suppress popular opposition of COVID 19 pandemic with Trudeau talking about how he's
[55:20.960 --> 55:26.560]  a dictator and bragging about it and saying, yeah, we're taking your basic freedoms. And
[55:26.560 --> 55:29.600]  Canada's the worst. They're the place where they're just, they think they have the most
[55:29.600 --> 55:35.160]  subservient population. So they are just throwing it all out of the open. And then I've got
[55:35.160 --> 55:40.160]  this report. Lockdown. Psyops propaganda. This is from months ago. This has even got
[55:40.160 --> 55:48.200]  more articles in it. So stop pretending you're part of the power structure and start realizing
[55:48.200 --> 55:53.480]  this is mind control they're using against you and the people you see under it. The mask
[55:53.480 --> 55:58.040]  is the symbol of their fear, the symbol of their subservience, the symbol that they're
[55:58.040 --> 56:02.240]  scared and they just think give the abusers what they want. And they'll be nice to us
[56:02.240 --> 56:06.440]  and they'll leave us alone. I'm going to close out this hour letting you know that we're
[56:06.440 --> 56:10.600]  going to hit the plan to stage terror attacks in the next 300 days. And blame the American
[56:10.600 --> 56:14.200]  people to bring in permanent martial law. Couldn't be more critical. The massive censorship
[56:14.200 --> 56:19.560]  taking place and how to fight back against that and more. We go to the live show feed
[56:19.560 --> 56:24.480]  into the broadcast today. You'll see that Getter is a great social media network that's
[56:24.480 --> 56:28.640]  exploding right now. And Joe Rogan joined it and it's getting even bigger. We hope you
[56:28.640 --> 56:33.280]  all follow us there. We'll have a lot of exclusive content there on the Alex Jones channel there.
[56:33.280 --> 56:38.560]  But if you put up the live show feed, global exclusive, Pentagon documents confirm. Government's
[56:38.560 --> 56:45.320]  using mass formation psychosis to brainwash the population. If you scroll down, you can

[57:50.440 --> 57:55.320]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up for what
[57:55.320 --> 58:00.440]  the globalists are doing right now. This is their big offensive. This is their takeover.
[58:00.440 --> 58:03.680]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed
[58:03.680 --> 58:07.880]  themselves. Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny
[58:07.880 --> 58:13.080]  is out in the open. Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their
[58:13.080 --> 58:17.320]  corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the
[58:17.320 --> 58:21.200]  truth. So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when
[58:21.200 --> 58:24.680]  you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear. And when you buy products at

[58:49.760 --> 58:55.360]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia to
[58:55.360 --> 58:59.400]  the United States, from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you
[58:59.400 --> 59:03.880]  do everywhere you go, then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[59:03.880 --> 59:09.120]  taking people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next
[59:09.120 --> 59:14.000]  year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people
[59:14.000 --> 59:17.880]  away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial
[59:17.880 --> 59:22.720]  law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[59:22.720 --> 59:26.600]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government
[59:26.600 --> 59:32.160]  military grade at Infowarsstore.com. We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to

[59:52.440 --> 1:00:02.720]  Using a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:02.720 --> 1:00:22.920]  All right, my friends, I'm going to cover a lot of huge news in the next segment because
[1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:28.360]  I got to get this stuff out now. I don't know how long we're going to be on here. I mean,
[1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:35.480]  you can feel the evil. You can feel the good rising against it. Cut the suspense with a
[1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:40.800]  knife right now. And I just see the person still just into TV and into culture like,
[1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:44.440]  yeah, New World Order them, but hey, I'm going to go watch a movie and I'm going to go eat
[1:00:44.440 --> 1:00:49.000]  some steak tonight. And I'm not blaming you for wanting to do that, but I'm also pointing
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:54.560]  out it's all burning down. The globalists are taking over now. They're coming out to
[1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:58.960]  the children. The lockdowns are happening. I'm going to cover that next segment. Here's
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:03.400]  a special report, though, by Greg Reese that, okay, it's got a half million views and each
[1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:15.320]  10 million views. This is total proof they're murdering you with the so-called vaccine.
[1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:25.760]  We recognize leading pathologist Dr. Arne Burkhart, a renowned expert in the fields of microbiology
[1:01:25.760 --> 1:01:30.880]  and infectious diseases. Recently published irrefutable evidence that the mRNA shots are
[1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:38.320]  killing at least 40% of recipients. First, they explain why the experimental agents cannot
[1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:44.120]  protect against a viral infection, which we already know to be true by the overwhelming
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:49.560]  evidence and admissions that the more waxed up a person is, the more likely they are to
[1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:56.240]  get COVID. Doctors Burkhart and Bakhti explain that this is due to the fact that the so-called
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:03.520]  vaccines sway the body into producing antibodies in the blood, but not within the mucus membranes
[1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:08.840]  that normally protect our respiratory tract. This is why the vaccinated are suffering what
[1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:15.280]  they call breakthrough infections. The COVID vaccines are turning off lymphocyte production
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:20.640]  where they need it the most, while amping it up in the bloodstream, which is where it
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:27.880]  gets much worse. For those without the vaccine, a natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 will in
[1:02:27.880 --> 1:02:34.400]  most cases remain localized to the respiratory tract. But for those who have been vaccinated,
[1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:40.080]  unrelated cells deep inside the body react to the respiratory infection by creating a
[1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:45.880]  new spike protein, which then causes the cell that created it to be attacked by the immune
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:53.280]  system. Experts warned us of this last year, and now it is clearly seen in the evidence.
[1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:59.960]  Doctors Burkhart and Bakhti found this autoimmune disease present in most organs, but mostly
[1:02:59.960 --> 1:03:06.400]  in the heart, which helps explain why we are seeing so many cases of myocarditis and cardiac
[1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:13.960]  arrest. The vaccines trigger self-destruction. Analysis has now been performed on the organs
[1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:21.120]  of over 70 people who died after vaccination and who died for reasons officially unrelated
[1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:27.200]  to the vaccines. In most cases, rhythmogenic heart failure was postulated as the cause
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:33.640]  of death, a mystery which has now been solved. What they found was inflammatory events in
[1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:41.040]  small blood vessels characterized by an overabundance of T lymphocytes and dead cells, usually
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:48.240]  accompanied by tissue destruction. In other words, immunological self-attack. The evidence
[1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:56.640]  clearly shows that both mRNA and vector-based vaccines from all four manufacturers are inducing
[1:03:56.640 --> 1:04:04.120]  autoimmune disease in multiple organs, mostly the heart followed by the lung, liver, thyroid,
[1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:10.960]  and brain. These data are so damning that you don't have to start looking for other
[1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:19.760]  data to know that these vaccines are killing the young and the old, so the children are
[1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:27.840]  set up against the wall and they shoot. These damn people are shooting and they're killing
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:33.760]  our children. I can't stand it. We have a four-year-old son and we're going to flee
[1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:39.960]  this damn country because we are not going to let himself be shot.
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:05:03.140]  Coming for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees. Christmas 2021 is over, but you've still got a really
[1:05:03.140 --> 1:05:08.200]  great chance to give yourself the gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the

[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:14.160]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex
[1:06:14.160 --> 1:06:15.160]  Jones.
[1:06:15.160 --> 1:06:22.680]  You want answers? You want to get out of this tyranny? So do I, my friends. And I know how
[1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:28.120]  to get out of it. Identify the globalist and how they are psychologically weakening
[1:06:28.120 --> 1:06:33.160]  us, how they are dumbing us down, how they are rolling out their great reset and say
[1:06:33.160 --> 1:06:42.200]  no to them and stop them. Submission is death to these tyrants. Resistance is victory. And
[1:06:42.200 --> 1:06:52.880]  all over the world, in Germany, in Italy particularly, they told them, don't go out on New Year's,
[1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:58.880]  our fireworks will be arrested. And so they're reporting dozens and dozens of times what would
[1:06:58.880 --> 1:07:08.280]  normally be fired off or fired off as a symbol of people in places like Naples and places
[1:07:08.280 --> 1:07:15.920]  like Rome saying no and millions marching in Germany and millions marching in France
[1:07:15.920 --> 1:07:22.240]  and millions in Spain and places like Madrid. They said over a million people on the streets
[1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:29.360]  of Madrid, people are not submitting to this, they're being told to stay indoors because
[1:07:29.360 --> 1:07:36.240]  of a virus. It's all martial law training and then shocking footage of riot police running
[1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:41.480]  over men, women and children to try to route people and create intimidation. What happens
[1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:45.080]  when they turn on the government and actually take over the palaces and things? Well, the
[1:07:45.080 --> 1:07:48.920]  globalists want that, then that will plunge the stock markets, consolidate control and
[1:07:48.920 --> 1:07:52.520]  the globalists will come in and buy the country up for a penny a dollar. That's why they have
[1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:57.360]  German shepherds literally attacking and ripping open people's bodies. As you're watching
[1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:01.920]  right now all over Europe, the police have been hired because they're subservient. They've
[1:08:01.920 --> 1:08:07.280]  been hired because they follow orders. And now there is the detonator to carry out these
[1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:15.080]  illegal orders that cause a mass uprising that in the documents that came out in 2002,
[1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:20.280]  the secret IMF documents that Greg Palos to BBC got back when they still had good reporters
[1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:25.480]  there, was they order the police to do things and carry out policies that will break the
[1:08:25.480 --> 1:08:32.560]  social construct, that will break the social contract and will make the public see the
[1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:35.960]  government as the enemy because the globalists of the bank sitting back, they can change
[1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:41.360]  governments. So have the people because they're under attack, attack back and crush the government.
[1:08:41.360 --> 1:08:46.640]  It falls, they come in and that's where they cook the virus, released it, created a so
[1:08:46.640 --> 1:08:53.760]  called vaccine that gives you cancer and heart attacks and death. That was the plan. That
[1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:59.080]  was the program. You've got these childlike populations in Europe, in the U.S. that have
[1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:03.400]  lived in liberty so long and haven't been in a big war in 70, 80 years that they don't
[1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:08.280]  know what tyranny is. But now they're realizing being locked up in your house, being told
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:12.160]  you've got to take a poison, a shot to have a job. All of this sets the precedent of
[1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:19.200]  total control and then you've got big pharma paying people billions a month. It's billions
[1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:26.120]  a month total in the world. Look it up. To lie and say it, no side effects. It works great.
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:29.520]  Don't listen to those that say it doesn't protect you even though they're saying you've
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:33.920]  got to have your fourth or fifth shot now because it doesn't work. And Robert F. Kennedy
[1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:40.880]  Jr. did a full interview. It's up on infowars.com. RFK Jr. smashes COVID narrative. Nobody has
[1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:47.440]  ever complied their way out of totalitarianism, which equates to resistance is victory. Here's
[1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:49.560]  what he had to say.
[1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:55.720]  It's time we started standing up to all of these mandates. You remember when the government
[1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:01.680]  told us when Tony Fauci told us that we were going to lock down. He said it was for two
[1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:08.120]  weeks and now it's been almost two years. And I'm going to tell you three things that
[1:10:08.120 --> 1:10:17.720]  you need to remember in this critical day and age. One is that once government acquires
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:25.560]  a power, it never lets it go voluntarily. The second thing that we need to know is that
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:33.520]  every power that government acquires using this pandemic as a pretense, it will ultimately
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:42.320]  abuse to the maximum effect possible. And this is just a rule that is as certain as gravity.
[1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:51.520]  The third thing that you need to know is that nobody has ever complied their way out of totalitarianism.
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:59.560]  Every time you comply, the demands will get greater and greater. We need to resolve here
[1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:06.800]  and now this is the hill that we need to die on. They have come for our jobs. They've come
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:13.000]  for our transport. Now they're coming for our children. And we have an obligation as
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:21.400]  parents to protect them. There has never been a government history that has told its people.
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:28.680]  We are going to demand that children sacrifice themselves and take risks to save old people.
[1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:36.360]  It's always the other way around. The old, the mature, the adults always put themselves
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:44.320]  at risk to protect their children. This is an ethical issue. It's a moral issue. It's
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:50.720]  an issue of character for each of us. And it's an issue about the preservation of democracy
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:58.000]  and public health. We all need to stand up now and do everything that we can to block
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  these power plays by authoritarian powers that are trying to steal from us the health
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  of our children.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:14.040]  Absolutely beautiful. And when he says we've never put adults above children, in the last
[1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:19.440]  500 years of the Renaissance and Christianity really finally taken over, all before that
[1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:24.640]  the pagans always tortured and killed kids. That was their religion. This is paganism
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:31.800]  that we see taken over right now. So Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is absolutely the very blood
[1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:38.240]  of truth when he says all that. And you notice I boil it down very simply. Compliance is
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:52.360]  death. Compliance is death. Resistance is victory. Compliance is death. Resistance is
[1:12:52.360 --> 1:13:00.880]  victory. Compliance is death. Resistance is victory. Victory. You see that? You know
[1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:06.720]  where that comes from? To the Welsh Longbowman a thousand years ago and then even after that
[1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:10.240]  when the English were able to take over France several times, it was that they had the long
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:16.280]  bows and if the Norman ever got you, they'd cut your fingers off, your index and your
[1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:28.720]  middle so you couldn't pull that bow. That's why they tell them, you see that? Got my fingers.
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:35.000]  I can fight back. I'm going to kill you back then physically. And right now they're killing
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:39.880]  our children physically. We're going to destroy them psychologically and then they're going
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:43.560]  to be arrested in Nuremberg too in their jail. But criminals can't help it. They cook up
[1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:48.760]  schemes and they make their moves and they've done it now. We're going to break in a few
[1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:51.680]  minutes. I'm going to come back though and hit the bad news. You just saw some of the
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:56.280]  good news. Humanity waking up and saying no. Need to know about the latest enemy attacks
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:14:04.920]  and they're unprecedented. It just gets unprecedented every day as this stuff gets more intense.
[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:10.880]  Currently I cannot impart enough on you the amazing job you've done, all of you. You know
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:14.000]  who you are that have listened to us, that have prayed for us, that have bought the products
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:19.560]  over the years, have supported our sponsors. You really are the tip of the spear. And now
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:23.800]  all that investment, all that time and all that energy you've put into promoting liberty

[1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:36.120]  the articles, take the videos from infowars.com and newswars.com and freeworldnews.tv. And
[1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:39.680]  take clips of them and share them and change the name and put your name on it. I don't
[1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:44.040]  care what you do, you have full permission. In fact, I'm on my knees asking you to share

[1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:54.920]  support, let me tell you. In fact, for some reason we ran out of my house a month ago
[1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:59.400]  and I started noticing energy levels. So I finally last night came to work and got a
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:04.840]  bottle of X2 and took it home because it had been sold out and I hadn't got another bottle.

[1:15:18.520 --> 1:15:23.120]  of the iodine that's out there. It's usually bound to stuff because it's so active. It's
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:27.160]  such a, I mean, pure iodine, you put a drop of it on a table. It's like, I dream of genie.
[1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:32.000]  It like turns into a purple cloud. It just aerosolizes. This is bound up in this palm
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:39.840]  oil. Your cells just gobble it up like ambrosia. It's 50% off sold out for months back in stock.

[1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:22.720]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:30.000]  and American jobs. It is the true digital economy. It's the spiritual economy of the mind
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:36.400]  and transcendent control. I've been on air 28 years and all of our work has been amazing thanks
[1:17:36.400 --> 1:17:42.080]  to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing. But I got to tell you out of everything I've done,
[1:17:42.080 --> 1:17:49.040]  reset wars is the most important and it is now available now the month of December 2021 is here
[1:17:49.040 --> 1:17:56.640]  at resetwars.com. Start your journey to the next level today at resetwars.com, the globalist fear
[1:17:56.640 --> 1:18:01.680]  this information. Not just across the United States, but across the world. You see it on the
[1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:06.560]  sides of barns and on bumper stickers on cars and written on the side of bathroom walls.
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:12.240]  Alex Jones was right. That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see
[1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:16.000]  through the fraud of the new world order that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates,
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:20.560]  and the great reset. And so now in four words credibility is stronger than it's ever been.
[1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:25.040]  And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks.
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:28.560]  And we can't let them do that. So you've invested in four words over the years.
[1:18:28.560 --> 1:18:33.600]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture or everything you've done
[1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:39.600]  in the past is for nothing. You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace.
[1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:46.640]  You have done incredible things. And I'm telling you now going in 2022 info wars has major underages

[1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:14.720]  stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:21.040]  So in the future under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down protecting your privacy,

[1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:14.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:22.160]  Remember the Buddhist monks that were sick of the Vietnam war and the millions of people
[1:20:22.160 --> 1:20:26.720]  dying, including hundreds of thousands of children who would just set themselves on fire.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.480]  They're not going to be violent to you. They're not going to say what you're doing is wrong.
[1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:34.560]  They're just going to go tell both sides that this is what you're doing to humanity and set
[1:20:34.560 --> 1:20:39.200]  themselves on fire. That takes a lot of will, a lot of courage. It just happened in Australia
[1:20:39.200 --> 1:20:46.160]  with a protester against the ongoing lockdowns and the left is calling him a firebomber. See,
[1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:52.880]  how do you spin it when somebody kills themselves to protest peacefully? Well, you call him a firebomber.
[1:20:55.440 --> 1:21:01.360]  Horror. Australian man set himself on fire over covid vaccine passports, but you read deeper
[1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:04.320]  because he did just set himself on fire. They're calling himself a bomber.
[1:21:04.320 --> 1:21:09.280]  That's how the sick freaks spin everything. They think living in a world where you screw people
[1:21:09.280 --> 1:21:15.280]  over makes their life better. They don't know the hell they've created. That's coming up next
[1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:20.480]  segment, but let's look at this right now. Look, there's video of this. I forget what number it
[1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:30.240]  is, guys, but get it ready. Thanks. Video. Fauci decries and decrees because he's God. Fauci decrees
[1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:36.960]  Fauci decrees with his crown on that vaccine boosts Americans should not leave home.
[1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:46.320]  So even if you've had all the shots and you're a booster, you can't leave your house.
[1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:52.080]  But if you say the vaccine isn't a vaccine, it doesn't work and lowers your immunity,
[1:21:52.080 --> 1:21:59.440]  which they admit is true. Then if you're like Marjorie Taylor Green or Dr. Robert Malone
[1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:09.680]  or Alex Jones, you get banned. Fauci, though, is allowed to say it. You're not allowed to say
[1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:16.160]  that it doesn't work. Here's the clip. How should vaccinated and boosted people behave?
[1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:20.240]  Can they go into a restaurant, eat safely indoors right now?
[1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:29.360]  You know, when you're having such a, I call it a tsunami of infections, Dana,
[1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:36.800]  we are seeing people who are vaccinated and boosted who are getting breakthrough infections.
[1:22:36.800 --> 1:22:41.440]  So when you're in a situation where you have so many infections going out, the thing that
[1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:47.120]  you want to say is that if you want to do things like that, better do them in a setting where you
[1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:53.200]  know the people around you are vaccinated and boosted. And that's the reason why I've been saying
[1:22:53.760 --> 1:23:01.040]  when asked about the holiday season, the safest thing to do is to be in a home setting, friends,
[1:23:01.040 --> 1:23:07.840]  relatives who you know are vaccinated and boosted. If you want to go the extra step of safety,
[1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:13.360]  then get a quick antigen test, which will give you an extra degree of safety. What you want to
[1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:20.400]  avoid are places where you have 20, 30, 40, 50 people, many of whom you have no idea of whether
[1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:27.600]  or not they're vaccinated or boosted. That's more risky than the home setting. That sounds like a yes.
[1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:32.240]  So the authoritarians know they've taken over the planet through fraud. They know they're
[1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:36.160]  imploding the currencies and they know if we get together, we're going to overthrow them.
[1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:39.840]  So they're just saying getting together causes death and then the police come and attack you,
[1:23:39.840 --> 1:23:43.760]  but you get together. And then meanwhile, statistically, it's the places where they're
[1:23:44.480 --> 1:23:49.680]  extremely injected and locked down where they have the highest levels of disease and death
[1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:56.800]  that are now taking place. See how that works? See how they figured all that out?
[1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:03.280]  They've done a great job of it, haven't they? But notice, oh, you're not safe when you took
[1:24:03.280 --> 1:24:08.240]  all the shots even boosted because the other people didn't take it. Oh, I get it.
[1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:13.680]  But letting you know that it didn't work, but blame those that didn't take the shot for the
[1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:19.280]  fact you're sick. And that's how they set up this whole plan to roll this out. It's how I told you
[1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:28.400]  20, three months ago now in February of the year before last that this was coming. And I told you
[1:24:28.400 --> 1:24:32.240]  it's not 15 days to flatten the curve. It's going to be years and years and years until they get
[1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:37.920]  out its permit. Hence the statement that I coined the worst part of the first 15 days.
[1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:44.240]  The worst part of 15 days of flatten the curve is the first two years.
[1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:48.800]  And somebody else said it, nobody knows who.
[1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:57.280]  But it's absolutely true that what are the vaxxed and unvaxxed have in common?
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:08.480]  They're both never fully vaxxed. Video Fauci decries that vaccinated and boosted Americans should not
[1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:14.160]  leave home. Oh, and I remember talking to NYPD cops that are listeners. They said, well,
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:19.920]  this guy's a Democrat, Eric Adams, but he claims he'll in the little lock downs of the mandates.
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:28.000]  Oh, sorry. New York City Mayor Eric Adams will keep the Blasio's private sector vaccine mandate
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:35.280]  plans potential expansions. Yeah. The big guys one control showed you this video earlier video
[1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:42.400]  Dutch police sick attack dogs on anti lockdown protesters. How dare you go outside? You're
[1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:48.640]  not essential. You got to go bankrupt and let us control you. Wow. Infection experts, we will never
[1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:52.240]  see the end of the coronavirus. Told you two years ago, they announced that in year three.
[1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:56.320]  They're already doing it. Elites exploit COVID-19 to erase free speech.
[1:25:58.480 --> 1:26:06.320]  A OCC partying maskless at Miami drag bar amid controversy. Oh, but it's a drag bar. So it's
[1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:13.040]  okay. She breaks her own rules because the rules aren't for her. The rules are for you.
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:20.720]  Denmark 90% of Omicron infections found in fully vaccinated are boosted individuals,
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:29.920]  the same numbers from around the world. England imposes new COVID measures on schoolchildren.
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:36.560]  They'll be required to test negative recovery before the new term begins as UK government
[1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:41.200]  seeks to limit the spread. Oh, but it doesn't matter that they count the common cold or having
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:48.320]  it in the last year as COVID. Oh, and I've got that club for you next segment. Technocrats go on
[1:26:48.320 --> 1:26:55.360]  censorship rampage in desperate attempt to prevent total narrative collapse. That was the Sunday
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:27:03.200]  night live showhead live, but I wanted to read that because it's so incredibly dead on what
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:10.800]  Harrison Smith had to say last night in the 68 p.m. Sunday show. And we're gonna come back and talk
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:16.720]  about all of that and why they're so scared of Dr. Robert Malone talking about mass formation
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:22.480]  psychosis. You realize how big a deal it is that that's a term they use to control us. And then he
[1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:28.000]  points it out. I show you all the military documents in Europe and the US admitting they're doing the
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:34.400]  exact thing to us, creating mass hysteria and fear and psychosis. And then the Google tries to block
[1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:41.600]  it while they have separate articles with Google bragging about how wonderful
[1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:50.320]  it is they're controlling us. I just showed you that last hour. Please go to info wars.com.
[1:27:50.320 --> 1:27:55.840]  Please take it, put it on your website, put it on your share it however you want. I don't care.
[1:27:56.400 --> 1:28:00.640]  Copy it, plagiarize it, do whatever you want. Because it's not plagiarism if I tell you I
[1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:06.080]  don't care about the credit. All I care about is you warning people.
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:15.520]  See the mass formation psychosis term censored by Google following bombshell Dr. Malone interview.
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:22.320]  That's an article we put out yesterday. And then the new article is on info wars.com.
[1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:32.240]  Specifically dealing with breaking information. Here it is right here. Breaking information.
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:38.400]  Mass formation psychosis admittedly used by governments as tool of population control.
[1:28:38.400 --> 1:28:43.920]  And they don't want you to even know the trick they're using on you because when you know about
[1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:47.440]  the trick of the magician, when you're three years old, see a magician pull a rabbit out,
[1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:52.000]  you think it's real. When you're six year old, your dad shows you it's in a hidden box underneath
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:55.040]  the hat, you go oh my gosh, why didn't I see it before?
[1:28:57.440 --> 1:29:01.440]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up
[1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:07.760]  for what the globalists are doing right now. This is their big offensive. This is their takeover.
[1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:11.760]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:16.000]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out in
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:21.360]  the open. Their depopulation agenda has been exposed. But they're using their corporate power
[1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:26.320]  and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth. So listen, Paul
[1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:29.920]  Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for the broadcast,
[1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:34.640]  you're the tip of the sphere. And when you buy products at infoarstore.com, you keep us on air.

[1:30:59.520 --> 1:31:05.280]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico,
[1:31:05.280 --> 1:31:10.080]  the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[1:31:10.080 --> 1:31:14.800]  above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah, we buy it from the
[1:31:14.800 --> 1:31:18.400]  little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really, they're just a commune.
[1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:22.240]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't
[1:31:22.240 --> 1:31:25.360]  let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels,
[1:31:25.360 --> 1:31:28.960]  and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff sold at
[1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:33.440]  Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of the best
[1:31:33.440 --> 1:31:37.920]  coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels,
[1:31:37.920 --> 1:31:49.200]  literally. In fact, I'm going to tell you a little story. Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[1:31:49.200 --> 1:31:52.880]  and that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't fund us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[1:31:57.200 --> 1:32:03.360]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with
[1:32:03.360 --> 1:32:09.120]  facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental
[1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:15.920]  condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com. Studies have suggested that
[1:32:15.920 --> 1:32:22.000]  fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:27.680]  levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory
[1:32:27.680 --> 1:32:34.240]  responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA
[1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:41.040]  and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of
[1:32:41.040 --> 1:32:47.840]  immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about
[1:32:47.840 --> 1:32:53.920]  actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member,
[1:32:53.920 --> 1:33:02.880]  or yourself at infowarstore.com Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[1:33:02.880 --> 1:33:05.840]  New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:05.840 --> 1:33:21.120]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:21.120 --> 1:33:41.680]  The horror Australian man sets self on fire over COVID vaccine passports.
[1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:47.520]  The articles on infowarstore.com he gave his life, we wish he wouldn't have,
[1:33:47.520 --> 1:33:54.800]  to expose what was happening, set himself on fire inside of his car and the media spun it
[1:33:54.800 --> 1:34:01.280]  that he tried to fire bomb people. A Melbourne man emulated himself, he would have run over a
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:05.120]  couple hundred people, he'd been a hero in the news, according to the left, they were white.
[1:34:05.120 --> 1:34:09.120]  A Melbourne man emulated himself in front of a horrified onlookers and protested the nation's
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:14.000]  draconian COVID vaccine passport system. One of the bystanders captured footage of the
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:18.080]  heart breaking incident over the weekend, explaining the man had been screaming about
[1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:23.360]  vaccine passports and digital ID. He just effing blew up a car.
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:32.400]  Is how they're spinning it. Again, if he had just run over 60, 70 people and killed six people,
[1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:38.400]  like Waukesha, it would have been the car that did it. Car blows up killing man.
[1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:44.560]  But because he self emulated himself inside of his car, well now he's a terrorist,
[1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:50.000]  even though nobody got hurt. See how the liberal spin, the behavioral psychology works,
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:54.800]  where they've got all the corporate media and all the banks and all the propaganda and the police
[1:34:54.800 --> 1:35:00.240]  and the military behind them, they can pose as the left and claim they're fighting the establishment.
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:06.400]  But if we go back to Vietnam, you had the Buddhist that were neutral, but just sick of the bombing
[1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:10.640]  and the murdering and the killing and they're like, you know what, you guys are all so into death.
[1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:14.560]  I'm going to pour a gallon of gasoline on myself and meditate for two minutes while I die.
[1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:16.960]  This is my protest.
[1:35:21.680 --> 1:35:25.920]  And of course nowadays they'd say, terrorist tries to burn people on street.
[1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:30.400]  But when you actually kill a bunch of people on purpose because they're white,
[1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:36.480]  well then they cover it up and say, oh, it was just an SUV kills six, runs over 50 plus.
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:42.160]  And that's how the technocrats think they're going to control things and then further insert us to
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:47.760]  go to school or go to our jobs or go to court. Oh, it's not just going to be a zoom trial you've
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:52.480]  got to have. It's a metaverse trial where the judge is there and everyone's there and now they
[1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:58.480]  can put in whatever data or info they want to fully confuse your brain. This is the next level of this
[1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:07.360]  sick scientific cults attack. Glenn Greenwald slams dystopian M.T.G. Marjorie Taylor Green
[1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:13.760]  Twitter ban in epic thread exposing she exposed truth about COVID-19 and truth how it's not a
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:18.880]  vaccine and truth how it doesn't work and truth how they're suppressing it. And so she joined the
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:24.480]  ranks of Alex Jones and Donald Trump. And I know she criticized her and insisted to try to fight it,
[1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:30.080]  but where was Trump? He would speak out against it, but he could have stopped it. He would add
[1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:35.200]  control the first few years of the House and Senate. It's the same thing today. Where is Trump?
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:43.760]  Half measures yet again. Joe Rogan joins Gitter, G-E-T-T-R in anticipation of censorship on Twitter
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:49.680]  getting even dumber. And I love Joe and people should follow him and it's great. I actually texted
[1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:54.080]  a bunch of my crew at like 5 a.m. this morning woke up. I said, hey, Gitter's getting really big
[1:36:54.080 --> 1:36:58.960]  and Joe's promoting it. Can we do articles to come join Info Wars on there? But of course,
[1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:03.280]  it's an article about Joe Rogan and how you should go join him. Because I love my crew and I'm the
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:07.680]  same way. We don't see ourselves as important. Info Wars isn't important. Everybody else is.
[1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:12.880]  And so never promote Info Wars. Never push Info Wars. And I'm like, hey, if I sent them text
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:16.480]  messages and said, promote Joe all you want, that's great. But Info Wars is kind of the Joe
[1:37:16.480 --> 1:37:21.680]  Rogan channel, which is fine. I love Joe. We hang out all the time. But Joe's not being censored
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:26.800]  as much. We're being censored. We have to promote Info Wars or we won't be here. And you know,
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:31.760]  I kind of had to remind myself about that. But if you go into the article, we've now updated with
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:36.400]  a link at the top to follow Info Wars on there. And I'm going to be using that more and more.
[1:37:36.400 --> 1:37:41.760]  A lot of key postings there daily. But I'm going to take over my Gitter account and start using it
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:48.320]  myself today. If you want to find it, it's in the article about Joe Rogan on infowars.com.
[1:37:48.320 --> 1:37:51.920]  Because, you know, Joe's great. And Joe's kicking ass has a lot of courage. We love him. But he's
[1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:55.280]  got hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank. I don't. We're barely on air. So I'm like, tell
[1:37:55.280 --> 1:37:59.920]  my crew, I'm like, we probably want to promote ourselves occasionally. Or we probably, when we
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:04.000]  do a Dr. Robert Malone interview, we probably want to put one of our bugs on or maybe mention
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:09.040]  ourselves just maybe. Or this building will shut down. The lights will turn off. But it doesn't
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:13.360]  matter. That won't happen. Because people net profits not known in their own country. I don't
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:18.000]  mean that about myself. My own wonderful crew doesn't realize how important they are. That's
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:23.280]  why Drudge was always so smart. When he would say, a person with a blog is just as important as
[1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:26.720]  the New York Times. Because you have an opinion. You can see things. You can write things. You
[1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:33.360]  can take photos. You can shoot videos. Just people want you. And yes, we are just as valuable
[1:38:34.080 --> 1:38:39.840]  as Joe Rogan. And I love my crew. I'm just doing this out in the open. Because even when I get on
[1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:47.200]  my muse and just say, hey, this is a great platform exploding. Can we get a link up? Can we,
[1:38:47.200 --> 1:38:52.560]  can we talk about it? It's like, no, no, we're not talking about ourselves. And I get it. In fact,
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:56.480]  I can do the ultimate not talking about myself, which again, I told you, I'm not going to do it.
[1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:00.480]  I'm strongly considering quitting. Not because of the lawsuits or the attacks of January 6th
[1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:05.440]  committee, just because I'm sick of this man. I've been doing this so long. And you maybe once
[1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:10.080]  I'm gone, people will care. Maybe when info wars is going bankrupt and shutting down, if I just
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:14.000]  walk out here, I bet there'll be some out of Jones articles then. I bet there'll be some articles
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:18.160]  about the videos we're doing. There's an interview. I mean, I bet we might actually hear about
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:25.120]  ourselves. But see, you don't know what you got till it's gone, right? That's how it works.
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:36.560]  But I have a responsibility to try to stay on air. It's just weird to learn the algorithms
[1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:42.800]  of how people operate and how things go. And just like, when we celebrate an interview we've done
[1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:46.320]  and make a big deal about it, the listeners care and they think it must be important and they
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:51.040]  share it. We're supposed to do something. We did hide that back here, put it right over here. You
[1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:59.440]  can't see it. And then, and then maybe, I mean, I mean, ladies and gentlemen, we have the documents
[1:39:59.440 --> 1:40:10.400]  and the big article on info wars.com. We have it. We have it all right there where they launched
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:17.680]  the mass formation psychosis and militaries are using it against us and admitting they're doing it.
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:22.560]  And then we've got Google and everybody censoring it saying it doesn't exist. How powerful is it
[1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:27.840]  to go, here's the military Psyop, use the brainwash you, people are like, I'm on cruise like,
[1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:34.160]  that's us, screw it. Hell, pour gasoline on that. Hell, I want to burn that article.
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:39.440]  Print me the article. I'm burning it on air. Bring me a lighter. I'm burning on air. They'll
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:43.360]  care about it. Seriously, I'll burn that damn article on air. Print it for me again. I'll
[1:40:43.360 --> 1:40:48.080]  piss on it. I'll bury it. I'll take that article outside and I will dig a two foot hole and I
[1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:53.680]  will bury it. People are like, that's where info wars goes buried. That's where articles go is in
[1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:58.640]  the dirt because we're pathetic because we're nobody because we never did anything and we don't
[1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:07.360]  matter. Seriously. Oh, let us fall over ourselves over, you know, half wits like, oh, look, somebody
[1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:12.000]  discovered there's a new world order. Somebody discovered there's a great reset. Here, let's
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  fall over ourselves about that. Not venting at anybody. I just, that's why I just want to go.
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:28.720]  It's, maybe it's time. Seriously, just time for me to go and you guys can handle it yourselves.
[1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:37.360]  Because again, I asked 5 a.m. Hey, hey, can we write an article about, you know,
[1:41:37.360 --> 1:41:40.800]  Joe's on getter and we need to get on getter people to follow us on there because we need to
[1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:44.960]  have a way to reach people outside our own system. No, you don't get that Jones.
[1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:57.760]  You get nothing because we haven't trailblazed. We haven't been successful. We haven't changed
[1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:03.360]  the whole paradigm. I mean, it's all the major leaders. We woke up, but still we're in Austin
[1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:10.880]  and you are Texans and, you know, Jones has got a redneck accent. So he's not a Californian.
[1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:15.200]  We can't promote it. You know how it works. Yeah, we just, we're not going to talk about it.
[1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:18.720]  We're not going to talk about ourselves. We're not going to post our own videos.
[1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:26.560]  We're going to post videos about what Rachel Maddow is doing and what CNN said with no viewers.
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:30.560]  We're going to have info wars be all about that. We'll just talk all day about what the
[1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:34.560]  left is doing, not about how they're criminals, not about other pedophiles, not about how they're
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:41.360]  devil worshipers. No, we'll just talk about fantasy land all day because that's what we do.
[1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:48.960]  And that's why we'll fail. That's okay. It's liberal. I understand. Liberal, liberal, liberal,
[1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:54.240]  liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal.
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:43:01.040]  As long as it's liberal. Not just across the United States, but across the world.
[1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:04.480]  You see it on the sides of barns and on bumper stickers on cars and
[1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:10.240]  written on the side of bathroom walls. Alex Jones was right. That's become a maxim of people
[1:43:10.240 --> 1:43:14.000]  to communicate to others that they see through the fraud of the new world order, that they're
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:19.120]  saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates and the great reset. And so now info wars credibility is
[1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:24.080]  stronger than it's ever been. And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after all
[1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:28.560]  their other attacks. And we can't let them do that. So you've invested info wars over the years.
[1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:34.160]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture or everything you've done
[1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:40.320]  in the past is for nothing. You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace.
[1:43:40.320 --> 1:43:46.560]  You have done incredible things. And I'm telling you now going into 2022 info wars has major
[1:43:46.560 --> 1:43:51.920]  underages to run an operation and we need more funds in. So it's a 360 win. Get great products
[1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:55.280]  that are great for you and your family, your immune system and so much more. So please go
[1:43:55.280 --> 1:44:02.960]  to info wars.com. The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the
[1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:11.120]  vaccines are working for quote dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who
[1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:16.960]  these evil groups are. They know that all over the world, their poison shot is being banned by
[1:44:16.960 --> 1:44:23.040]  major governments. And Moderna's in trouble as well. They know that the people are starting to get
[1:44:23.040 --> 1:44:28.560]  wise this depopulation agenda. In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed
[1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:34.320]  to be soft kill weapons, but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front.
[1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:41.760]  And so people are waking up. The weapons work a little too good. They're supposed to be silent
[1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:46.960]  weapons for quiet wars. But instead, they're making too big of a noise. But it's too late for
[1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:52.800]  return back now. They're coming after our children. So it's up to us to protect our little children,
[1:44:52.800 --> 1:44:57.360]  or God will not look favorably on us. Remember, God is watching.
[1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:04.240]  Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead. Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:09.760]  Good. Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement. It's basically
[1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:14.960]  the only way I get sleep anymore. With all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity. It's
[1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:19.200]  like we're living in a twilight zone, man. All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for
[1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:22.720]  calling. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick
[1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:27.280]  plug out for the phone of the product. The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody.

[1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:05.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:38.240]  All right, folks. I threw a little bit of a fit last segment. That's probably why I shouldn't be
[1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:42.960]  here because I'm going to get mad. I'm just sick of it all. I'm sick of everybody going along to
[1:47:42.960 --> 1:47:47.760]  get along. I'm sick of everybody just behaving like we're watching a football game and you've got
[1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:57.600]  Team New World Order and you've got Team America. I guess my mind, my brain knows I'm about to burn
[1:47:57.600 --> 1:48:02.720]  this. And it's preemptively telling me not to do it because I started just hacking and coughing
[1:48:02.720 --> 1:48:17.360]  during the break. I'm not sure why. So, imagine if you had UK Ministry of Defense, Pentagon documents
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:26.400]  from the US, European Union documents, Australian documents, New Zealand documents, admitting,
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  admitting to the world that the military was using PSYOP disinformation illegally against
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:43.920]  their own people to scare them into submission in the name of the noble lie to save them from COVID,
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:48.400]  which had actually been cooked up by them and released and was actually a global takeover plan.
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:52.080]  But that's what's happening.
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:00.560]  And so, we had Dr. Robert Malone make a big deal about this and talk about this
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:07.920]  in a big viral interview last week, which we were already playing clips of. He talked about
[1:49:07.920 --> 1:49:13.920]  mass formation psychosis, which is a technical term for mass psychosis or what I call mass Stockholm
[1:49:13.920 --> 1:49:21.040]  syndrome when they submit to the tyranny. And how it's admittedly used by governments in the
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:26.960]  Paul Joseph Watson article today on infowars.com links to all these sites, but who cares? I mean,
[1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:32.080]  who cares is premeditated? Who cares is admittedly real? Who cares they're now censoring you learning
[1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:39.600]  about it? It must not be a big deal if they're fighting to suppress it. Imagine people read how
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:44.000]  they're being controlled. They read how they're criminally being screwed over. It'd be like if
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:48.480]  you found your neighbor's diary because it fell out of their car in the road and was open and it said,
[1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:54.000]  I screwed Mr. Johnson's wife almost every night when he works in the late shift. He's such a dumb
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:58.880]  ass. I had him over last week to play poker. He had no idea. I just had sex with his wife five
[1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:04.560]  times the last week and how much she hates him and how she wishes he didn't snore. I tell you,
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:12.000]  my neighbor's a punk. Imagine the diary's open on the street. You see your name of your wife.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:18.800]  You pick it up. You talk to your neighbor. He just says, I don't think about your wife. I haven't
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:24.000]  anything to your wife. This is your diary. This is your diary. Some of the stuff I was on vacation
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:28.720]  with you. I know this is yours. No, it's not. You're a racist. You're a conspiracy theorist.
[1:50:28.720 --> 1:50:34.720]  I mean, we have them committing the crimes. We have the Davos group. We have the admissions.
[1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:42.400]  We have it all. And it becomes obscene to sit up here and talk about this like Robert Malone said.
[1:50:42.400 --> 1:50:48.480]  It's obscene that they're doing this. It is disgusting that they publicly meet and discuss
[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:52.720]  how they're going to screw us over all day. And then I'm supposed to just sit here every
[1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:57.840]  day and chronicle how they're screwing us. I wasn't even mad at the crew. The crew's great
[1:50:57.840 --> 1:51:01.920]  right on the show. And Steve Watts is great. My whole point was, oh, look, Joe got millions
[1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:06.080]  of followers on Getter in one day. We could get on Getter. We're already on Getter. We should
[1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:10.720]  promote that and ask them to promote us because I want to be able to talk to people and warn them.
[1:51:10.720 --> 1:51:15.120]  And it's like, yeah, we'll write another article about Joe Rogan. Because I get,
[1:51:15.120 --> 1:51:20.640]  nothing seems like success except in full wars is the fount of getting the analysis of what's
[1:51:20.640 --> 1:51:24.880]  happening now. And I don't, that's another frustrating part. I don't think people are stupid.
[1:51:24.880 --> 1:51:29.600]  Why did no one else know they had government documents calling it mass psychosis and mass
[1:51:29.600 --> 1:51:36.080]  fear paranoia hysteria? I mean, they admit that's what they're doing.
[1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:42.640]  It'd be like if the police saw a guy driving erratically, they pull him over and there's a
[1:51:42.640 --> 1:51:49.280]  dead kid in the trunk. And the police find videotapes of him killing the kid. You think you'd use
[1:51:49.280 --> 1:51:53.680]  that in court right? No, the police are like, well, we've got the video of him killing her,
[1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:59.360]  but we're not going to do anything with it. They wouldn't do that. We have them. We have them. We
[1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:05.760]  have them. And people have to get out of their damn trances now.
[1:52:10.480 --> 1:52:16.320]  But what got me is watching the man burn himself up in front of the police station in Australia
[1:52:16.320 --> 1:52:20.720]  protesting that his business had been shut down because he wouldn't take the deadly injections.
[1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:24.800]  And then they called him a firebomber because he burned himself up. How those
[1:52:24.800 --> 1:52:33.520]  scumbags spun that makes me sick. So here, people love stunts. Here it is. People will
[1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:38.400]  like this better because your freedoms are being burned up. We got the article breaking mass
[1:52:38.400 --> 1:52:42.320]  formations psychosis has been used by governments as a tool of population control.
[1:52:43.200 --> 1:52:45.600]  And notice how they do it. Those of us they know are awake.
[1:52:45.600 --> 1:52:51.920]  They spend it like, oh, a little sensory of you tell people too much. Try to wake people up. If
[1:52:51.920 --> 1:52:56.800]  you try to tell people they're being screwed, that censors too. It's anything that gets you
[1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:01.040]  out of your comfort zone. It's all about getting you to comfortably destroy yourself,
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:05.680]  comfortably go along with the annihilation of humanity and all the evil. So here, I'll do it.
[1:53:06.800 --> 1:53:14.480]  I'll do it for everybody. Since it needs to be done, let's just burn the truth. You know,
[1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:21.280]  it's absolutely true. Let's forget mass formation psychosis. I agree with Google. Don't talk about
[1:53:21.280 --> 1:53:28.960]  it. You'll get your social credit score shut down. Shut your filthy mouths. Good. Get rid of
[1:53:28.960 --> 1:53:35.440]  your population right now scum. Shut your mouth up. They probably love their product. Good job.
[1:53:35.440 --> 1:53:44.160]  He burned himself to death. Now shut his dirty pie hole up. There you go. Screw that info or
[1:53:44.160 --> 1:53:51.280]  a story. Shut up, those people. Too many of you anyways. And the globalists will say that. They're
[1:53:51.280 --> 1:53:56.320]  like, Jones, I haven't told me. You know, private conversations haven't had them in years with them.
[1:53:56.880 --> 1:54:00.960]  Jones, these people are going to eat you alive. You think we're bad? They're way worse than us.
[1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:05.440]  They're just not conscious. You need to join us. You can protect yourself and your family in the
[1:54:05.440 --> 1:54:10.240]  future and be your rifle place. You'll never be able to help these animals. You watch, you try to
[1:54:10.240 --> 1:54:14.080]  help them. They'll try to destroy you. Well, you know what? There's a lot of children out there that
[1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:17.280]  are good people. There's a lot of good people that aren't scum. There are a lot of scum out
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:22.000]  there in the general public as well. But the worst scum I've ever seen and the worst people I've
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:28.400]  ever seen are these new world order people. And you've got the worst feeling too. My spirit feels
[1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:35.600]  dead around you people. So I'd rather be frustrated out here battling you guys than be on the winning
[1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:40.720]  team. Cutesy facing around and everybody kiss your ass and going to all your little globalist
[1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:45.840]  Hollywood trash meetings. You people are losers and you're all going where Jeffrey Epstein and
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:51.360]  his disgusting pedophile associate are going. You understand that? I don't care who you are,
[1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:58.400]  what new world order scumbag you are. I don't care who you are. I don't care if you're Piers Morgan.
[1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:07.360]  I don't care if you are Anderson Cooper. I don't care if you're David Rockefeller.
[1:55:07.920 --> 1:55:12.000]  I don't care if you're Bill Gates. I don't care if you're Klaus Schwab. I don't care if you're
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:18.640]  Leonardo DiCaprio. I don't care if you're Tom Hanks. I don't care who you are. You are sacks of
[1:55:18.640 --> 1:55:28.880]  cowardly, filthy, predatory, anti-human, satanic collaborator garbage and you will be destroyed.
[1:55:31.760 --> 1:55:37.360]  Here's a whole other report. It was up Saturday on InfoWars.com. We checked the websites. We
[1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:41.680]  looked at the federal government. It's true. They're counting a 20-plus-year-old cold mutation
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:46.320]  as COVID-19 and telling those people to stay locked down are being intubated. Here's a clip
[1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:52.400]  of that, full videos on InfoWars.com. So my brother's been sick for a few days and the place he works
[1:55:52.400 --> 1:55:57.280]  makes him go get a COVID test. Hey, fine, great. He calls me and says, hey, I tested positive for
[1:55:57.280 --> 1:56:01.440]  COVID. They're sending me home for about five to seven days. I'm like, okay, are you all right? He
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:07.040]  goes, yeah. He goes, actually told me that it's a real mild case of COVID. I'm like, that's weird.
[1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:11.040]  So you have Omicron. He goes, no, they said it wasn't Omicron. Like, did they give you anything
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:15.440]  to keep? He goes, yeah, I said, send it to me. I want to see what this is. This is what they,
[1:56:15.440 --> 1:56:19.040]  this is what he sent me. So you look at everything that's not detected. And you see the one thing
[1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:26.640]  that is detected, coronavirus 229E. And I didn't know what that was. So I looked it up. Coronavirus
[1:56:26.640 --> 1:56:35.360]  229E is the cold. My brother got sent home from work because he has a cold. Now, if you extrapolate
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:39.680]  this out across the country and all the positive COVID tests that are coming back,
[1:56:39.680 --> 1:56:46.800]  are they counting the cold as COVID positives? If they are, it explains a lot, explains why cases
[1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:53.600]  are jumping everywhere. But also, what's really behind them wanting to count the cold as a COVID
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:59.040]  positive test? There's something kind of crazy going on to me. I'm not the exact epitome of
[1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:02.960]  conspiracy theorists, but this one, this one smells a little bit right. Anyway, that's all I got.
[1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:08.080]  Talk to y'all later. Bye. Yes, they're counting any coronavirus as a virus. Yes, they're counting
[1:57:08.080 --> 1:57:12.320]  all colds as it. That's why they're like, oh, you don't get sick from it, but you all got it. So we
[1:57:12.320 --> 1:57:17.520]  got to shut your company down. It's to collapse civilization. Then the big banks have unlimited
[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:21.680]  money to prop up their companies that don't go bankrupt. And then they take over. Then they
[1:57:21.680 --> 1:57:26.960]  dictate the terms of your surrender through the social credit score. It's not coming. It's here.
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:33.120]  And it's a total nightmare. We've got to get the general public organized and fight it. And we
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:37.680]  got to realize the average Republican leader knows this, but it's too cowardly to cover it.
[1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:40.640]  That's why we're in so much trouble. Our problem in the Democrats,
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:44.880]  our problem is the so-called conservative opposition of the red blood.
[1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:52.160]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup
[1:57:53.040 --> 1:57:58.400]  for what the globalists are doing right now. This is their big offensive. This is their takeover.
[1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:02.480]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:07.440]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out in the open.
[1:58:07.440 --> 1:58:12.640]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and trillions
[1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:17.680]  to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth. So listen, Paul Revere's,
[1:58:17.680 --> 1:58:20.640]  when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for the broadcast,
[1:58:20.640 --> 1:58:24.080]  you're the tip of the spear. And when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[1:58:24.080 --> 1:58:27.600]  you keep us on air. Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months
[1:58:27.600 --> 1:58:34.000]  that are back in stock 50% off, X2 and Winter Sun. Both of these are on our top five best
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:37.920]  sellers. They are so good for your body. And if there's two things you do for your body,
[1:58:37.920 --> 1:58:41.600]  it's these two products. They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com,
[1:58:41.600 --> 1:58:45.680]  50% off, and it keeps us on the air. Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[1:58:47.760 --> 1:58:54.640]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity. Everything I promote is about standing up against
[1:58:54.640 --> 1:58:59.760]  a new world order by empowering humanity. Well, that's why resetwars.com is so important. Not
[1:58:59.760 --> 1:59:05.360]  only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[1:59:05.360 --> 1:59:12.720]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[1:59:12.720 --> 1:59:19.440]  and American jobs. It is the true digital economy. It's the spiritual economy of the mind
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:26.400]  and transcendent control. I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing thanks
[1:59:26.400 --> 1:59:32.080]  to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing. But I got to tell you out of everything I've done,
[1:59:32.080 --> 1:59:39.040]  resetwars is the most important and it is now available now the month of December 2021 is here
[1:59:39.040 --> 1:59:45.040]  at resetwars.com. Start your journey to the next level today at resetwars.com,
[1:59:45.040 --> 1:59:57.520]  the globalist fear this information. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:00:15.040 --> 2:00:38.640]  All right, folks, I'm going to hear some of these Dr. Robert Malone clips. They're so scared of
[2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:43.680]  their sensory right now. In the next segment, I'm going to plunge into all the other news we've not
[2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:50.640]  hit yet. Stay with us. We'll be right back. From basically European intellectual inquiry into the
[2:00:50.640 --> 2:00:56.320]  heck happened in Germany in the 20s and 30s, very intelligent, highly educated population,
[2:00:56.320 --> 2:01:04.400]  and they went barking mad. And how did that happen? The answer is mass formation psychosis.
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:11.520]  When you have a society that has become decoupled from each other and has free floating anxiety
[2:01:11.520 --> 2:01:18.160]  in a sense that things don't make sense, we can't understand it. And then their attention gets focused
[2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:25.120]  by a leader or series of events on one small point, just like hypnosis. They literally become
[2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:30.880]  hypnotized and can be led anywhere. And one of the aspects of that phenomena is the people that
[2:01:30.880 --> 2:01:36.640]  they identify as their leaders, the ones typically that come in and say, you have this pain and
[2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:42.320]  can solve it for you. I and I alone can fix this problem for you. Then they will lead,
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:47.920]  they will follow that person. It doesn't matter whether they lie to them or whatever. The data
[2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:54.000]  are irrelevant. And furthermore, anybody who questions that narrative is to be immediately
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:02:00.800]  attacked. They are the other. This is central to mass formation psychosis. And this is what has
[2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:07.360]  happened. We had all those conditions. If you remember back before 2019, everybody was complaining
[2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:13.040]  the world doesn't make sense, blah, blah, blah. And we're all isolated from each other. We're all
[2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:19.600]  on our little tools. We're not connected socially anymore, except through social media. And then
[2:02:19.600 --> 2:02:25.200]  this thing happened and everybody focused on it. That is how mass formation psychosis happens.
[2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:30.960]  And that is what's happened here. And that's a really hopeful message going into the new year,
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:43.520]  is that there's a growing cohort of people that are increasingly aware of how thoroughly we've
[2:02:43.520 --> 2:02:50.400]  been manipulated. So you'd say you've been red-pilled? Like multi-dimensional red-pilled.
[2:02:50.400 --> 2:03:02.960]  I thought I was red-pilled. I've been on the inside for so long and seen Tony Fauci's
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:12.720]  machinations for so long. That's my origin story, was the initial AIDS crisis starting in 83
[2:03:12.720 --> 2:03:24.080]  when I was in Davis. And so I saw the hardball politics. The other thing for me has been the
[2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:33.040]  personal journey of coming to terms with what the World Economic Forum really represents.
[2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:41.520]  And I really resisted that. People initially were coming to me talking about the great reset.
[2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:47.120]  And I was like, oh, this crazy talk. That sounds like a conspiracy theory.
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:57.760]  Yeah, but then it's all documented. And then you see it being deployed. And a group of Canadians
[2:03:57.760 --> 2:04:04.400]  on a podcast the other day sent me some links from WEF to a site. This is one of the last things I
[2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:17.920]  tweeted before. And it had an extremely detailed map of all of the policy positions and the actions
[2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:24.000]  that the WEF was taking for a huge range of topics, not least the witches COVID-19.
[2:04:24.640 --> 2:04:31.200]  And it's a public document that clearly states everybody that's in our little
[2:04:31.200 --> 2:04:35.520]  click in our club. These are the things that we will think. These are the things that we will
[2:04:35.520 --> 2:04:41.280]  say. This is how we will act. And that one was kind of like the icing on the cake. That was,
[2:04:41.280 --> 2:04:48.160]  that was a, oh, here it is. You know, this is, they're proud of it. They don't hide it. This is,
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:56.720]  this is the vision. It is a full on globalist totalitarian vision with the money in control.
[2:04:56.720 --> 2:05:05.920]  Christmas 2021 is gone. It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas

[2:06:20.720 --> 2:06:23.040]  Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:25.040 --> 2:06:29.200]  We're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless you start giving it.
[2:06:29.200 --> 2:06:30.800]  Yeah, that's just the way it goes.
[2:06:42.160 --> 2:06:45.760]  I got sent this video last night, the Derrimit Green made about a month ago
[2:06:45.760 --> 2:06:52.640]  that I have a vaccine sensitivity. And whoever never uploaded it cut our bugs off and that's
[2:06:52.640 --> 2:06:58.000]  fine. That's all I care about. Because to me, that's success. Is that our stuff's out there and
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:02.080]  it's sent back to us and our bugs are cut off? Who doesn't get censored? What matters is it gets
[2:07:02.080 --> 2:07:24.320]  out there and warns people. And again, if you're a radio listener and don't have to see all these
[2:07:24.320 --> 2:07:28.160]  people getting sick and even some of them dying out of the shots, you're a blessed person. But
[2:07:28.160 --> 2:07:33.520]  this is the reality of what's happening. We can't ignore the neurological problems it's causing
[2:07:33.520 --> 2:07:49.280]  and even death. We're joined by John Henry Weston, who I really appreciate coming on of
[2:07:49.280 --> 2:08:00.080]  LifesiteNews.com. John Henry is the co-founder and editor-in-chief of LifesiteNews.com.
[2:08:00.880 --> 2:08:07.040]  He and his wife, Diana, and their eight children live in Ottawa Valley in Ontario, Canada.
[2:08:08.400 --> 2:08:11.760]  And he's a very, very well-known speaker. And I feel like I know him as I watch so many of his
[2:08:11.760 --> 2:08:20.320]  videos. But he joins us now to talk about the crazy world we're living in and what's currently
[2:08:20.320 --> 2:08:26.080]  unfolding and also the attack of the leftist public, conservative Catholics, and the 2,000
[2:08:26.080 --> 2:08:31.520]  years of teaching, the incredible hypocrisy of pushing the minority rights except while crushing
[2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:37.680]  the unvaxxed, woke politics ignores the greatest social injustice of history in all of history,
[2:08:37.680 --> 2:08:42.720]  that the mass slaughter of children in the womb, the answer to the rape and incest argument,
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:50.640]  and how to confront the LGBT attack on our young people. And he joins us. But I got to say,
[2:08:51.520 --> 2:08:59.120]  some of the interviews I've seen with some of the Catholic bishops from Italy and Germany and
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:05.680]  other places are just absolutely amazing. And I've seen it's been John Henry Weston that's
[2:09:05.680 --> 2:09:13.920]  interviewed him. These guys sound as awake as Dr. Malone or myself or, or any of these people.
[2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:18.560]  I mean, they're talking about the great reset, the New World Order, how it's a satanic takeover,
[2:09:18.560 --> 2:09:23.040]  a plan for the mark of the beast, the global vaccine passport. And so that's really exciting.
[2:09:23.600 --> 2:09:29.200]  And we're very also blessed to have Lifesight News having a very popular page on band.video.
[2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:36.080]  So John Henry Weston, LifesightNews.com. Thank you for coming on with us today. So much to talk about.
[2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:38.720]  Great to be with you, Alex. Thanks for having us on.
[2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:40.880]  Well, where do you want to start? What about that amazing
[2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:48.480]  bishop out of Italy and the work he's doing? I mean, this is, this is amazing. I guess there's
[2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:53.280]  a civil war going on inside the Catholic Church like there is in every other institution or what's
[2:09:53.280 --> 2:10:00.400]  happening? Well, definitely so. Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who is a really a great hero in
[2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:05.600]  the church today, not only for the Catholic Church, it really speaks to the whole wide world.
[2:10:06.160 --> 2:10:11.520]  As, as you've said many times, the Catholic Church has had an influence on the whole wide world for
[2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:18.160]  well the last 2000 years. But at this time, we've experienced a time of crisis like none other.
[2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:26.240]  And very interestingly, just at this time, God chooses to raise up someone who will speak the
[2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:33.520]  truth despite the not only obfuscation, but error coming from the top, which by the way is unique
[2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:39.120]  in the history of the Catholic Church. Yes, there have been folks who've been corrupt and had children
[2:10:39.120 --> 2:10:43.920]  out of and then not even in wedlock and all sorts of things. Yes, that's always gone on.
[2:10:43.920 --> 2:10:49.840]  But to try and attempt to change the moral teachings of the church has never happened.
[2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:58.480]  And so we have really a lightning rod in Archbishop Vigano, who has been very prolific in calling
[2:10:58.480 --> 2:11:04.480]  his faith a state, speaking the truth despite its politically incorrectness, and daring to do so
[2:11:05.120 --> 2:11:10.480]  while knowing that his life could be in danger. Before he even came on the public scene that he's
[2:11:10.480 --> 2:11:17.760]  on, he was in the Vatican working in the background pointing out financial irregularities, knowing
[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:22.480]  full well that this could have cost him his life. He was then moved to the United States as the
[2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:27.600]  Nuncia, the papal representative to the United States and operated there under Pope Benedict,
[2:11:28.400 --> 2:11:35.120]  always fine and good. Bergoglio becomes Pope and then problems start to happen, especially when
[2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:42.400]  Kim Davis, if you recall, and I know you covered her as well, Kim Davis, a heroic marriage registrar
[2:11:42.400 --> 2:11:48.560]  refused to put her name to homosexual marriages. Archbishop Vigano, when the Pope came to visit
[2:11:48.560 --> 2:11:54.480]  the United States, arranged for Kim Davis to meet with the Pope. And really that was his undoing
[2:11:54.480 --> 2:12:00.160]  because he wanted to show this great Christian lady to not only the Pope, but to the whole wide
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:05.840]  world so that they could see her heroic act in terms of defending God's definition of marriage.
[2:12:06.400 --> 2:12:13.440]  And it's that we learn later that really was the undoing of Archbishop Vigano because Pope
[2:12:13.440 --> 2:12:21.040]  Francis, as we heard from his own collaborators, was so ticked off by Archbishop Vigano bringing
[2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:26.240]  forward Kim Davis that that was really his acts in terms of what's been going on. So there's
[2:12:26.240 --> 2:12:31.920]  great intrigue going on right now inside the Catholic Church, very much what people might have
[2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:35.680]  considered conspiracy theory before, but it's all out in the open right now.
[2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:41.600]  I'm glad you want to get into Vigano first because, I mean, I've been aware of him for a long time
[2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:46.560]  since the case you talked about, you know, watching that. And the way I think he probably did it on
[2:12:46.560 --> 2:12:52.640]  purpose to like point out that this false Pope would obviously reject this good woman. And I
[2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:58.240]  don't hate anybody. I'm a sinner. I'm not perfect. I've admitted to that. But as soon as quote gay
[2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:03.760]  marriage was legalized, the dam broke, and now it's pedophilia and now it's a sexualization
[2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:09.120]  of children. And it just made it 50 times more crazy. So this wasn't people wanting equal rights,
[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:14.160]  the people that run this agenda. And it was really a takeover. And that was seen as almost a
[2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:20.720]  capturing of the flag. And then once that got legalized, it doesn't seem we've seen the dam break.
[2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:26.800]  Yeah. Well, you know what, Alex, you've been around long enough to know that the same folks
[2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:32.240]  who were pushing that agenda always had as part of their club, the Man Boy Love Association,
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:37.040]  all these pedophile organizations, they shunned them for a time so that they could appear to the
[2:13:37.040 --> 2:13:43.200]  public like something, you know, copacetic, like something above board. And now, now that their
[2:13:43.200 --> 2:13:49.120]  agenda is through, lo and behold, what's coming right back to the table. But this whole, now
[2:13:49.120 --> 2:13:54.560]  they call it intergenerational sex. So they're coming up with new euphemisms to hide this agenda,
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:14:00.640]  which has always been part of the program from the beginning. You've, you studied the spiritual
[2:14:00.640 --> 2:14:05.600]  side in depth. There really is, though, a desire by evil throughout history to target children.
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:08.480]  Where do you think that comes from? I mean, from evil's perspective.
[2:14:11.280 --> 2:14:18.800]  The corruption of the innocence has always been the program of Satan. Satan hated mankind
[2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:25.120]  for, in the beginning, he wanted to corrupt Adam and Eve with sin. And so offered them
[2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:31.680]  first through Eve and then through Adam, the forbidden fruit. And this is Satan's end game
[2:14:31.680 --> 2:14:37.920]  all the time. Because he himself fell from grace. He was, of course, you know, Lucifer, an angel of
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:44.560]  light. And he rebelled against God with his, I will not serve. And really, that's what it's about.
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:50.960]  And that's how he tempts us as well. All the time in our lives, when we choose to go our own way,
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:55.440]  it's about, I will not serve. I will not serve the Lord, because we all know what God wants.
[2:14:55.440 --> 2:15:00.880]  He wants us to be good, to be holy, to follow his commandments. And that's tough, because here we
[2:15:00.880 --> 2:15:05.200]  are on earth, tempted by God knows what, and with the advent of the internet, we have all those
[2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:09.760]  temptations, not only just at the story, you have to go to them, they come right to your front door.
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:15.120]  In fact, they're shoved in your face. And so to deny yourself, as the scripture says,
[2:15:16.160 --> 2:15:20.640]  is a challenge. But it's something that we can do with the grace of Christ. But it's
[2:15:20.640 --> 2:15:26.800]  relying on that grace. It's staying in touch with God all day, every day, in order to be able to
[2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:32.000]  do what God wants us to do. And yes, it's a challenge. Everybody knows that. In fact, that's
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:38.320]  why the great lie of the LGBT movement, I was born this way, you just want to deny me all my fun.
[2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:47.440]  You hate me, is exactly the opposite. In fact, all of us, all of us who are straight, as they say.
[2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:51.280]  Hold on, John Henry Weston, this is important. We'll come back in a few minutes and go right
[2:15:51.280 --> 2:15:53.840]  back to this larger discussion. Stay with us.
[2:15:57.600 --> 2:16:02.080]  Since the end of World War Two, the globalist have been building their private corporate world
[2:16:02.080 --> 2:16:07.760]  government, whose endgame, once they get control, is forced depopulation of the planet. That's why
[2:16:07.760 --> 2:16:13.280]  as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of you out there watching
[2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:18.080]  and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger you and your family are in.
[2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:22.960]  The globalists are coming after everybody. They are setting up a dystopic, planetary,
[2:16:22.960 --> 2:16:28.240]  authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist. Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:16:28.240 --> 2:16:32.560]  M4 Wars is the tip of the spear. Your investment in us over the years, buying our products,
[2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:36.240]  spreading the word and praying for us has been incredible. But I'm telling you right now,
[2:16:36.240 --> 2:16:40.480]  we're about to lose not just M4 Wars, but the entire country and the world to tyranny.
[2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:45.360]  So now everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today. And M4WarsStore.com is
[2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:49.680]  one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip of the spear.
[2:16:49.680 --> 2:16:53.120]  I will go down with the ship. I'm not going to back down. I'm getting even more hardcore in
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:17:08.000]  their face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless you support us. So please go to M4WarsStore.com.
[2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:29.840]  This is just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm 55 years old. And I was already taking
[2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:33.840]  your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do,
[2:17:33.840 --> 2:17:37.680]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it,
[2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:43.040]  I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing,
[2:17:43.040 --> 2:17:47.440]  okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know, I don't
[2:17:47.440 --> 2:17:54.320]  have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really
[2:17:54.320 --> 2:18:00.720]  has totally cleared up my skin. Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in
[2:18:00.720 --> 2:18:05.360]  Tennessee. Welcome. Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real short
[2:18:05.360 --> 2:18:10.080]  where the other patrons can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:16.160]  your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer. Supermail volatility and brain force plus. Mix those two together.
[2:18:16.160 --> 2:18:21.520]  You're an unstoppable tank. Supermail volatility really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs
[2:18:21.520 --> 2:18:28.000]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:32.640]  powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine
[2:18:32.640 --> 2:18:37.600]  wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[2:18:37.600 --> 2:18:40.960]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:46.400]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like
[2:18:46.400 --> 2:19:11.760]  super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[2:19:16.400 --> 2:19:22.160]  High quality chicken broth protein, turmeric root that's so amazing, chaga musher, bee pollen,
[2:19:22.160 --> 2:19:27.840]  goji berry, alfalfa herb powder. Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[2:19:27.840 --> 2:19:34.400]  It's got a real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.

[2:19:57.440 --> 2:20:16.800]  Okay. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:16.800 --> 2:20:29.200]  John Henry Weston is our guest. He runs probably the biggest pro life site in the world.
[2:20:29.200 --> 2:20:33.840]  Life site news.com. They do huge conferences. They do daily shows. They do so much more.
[2:20:33.840 --> 2:20:38.240]  Really blessed and honored to have them reposting the material over at Band-Aut.
[2:20:38.240 --> 2:20:42.080]  Video is our main mission is to take censored information to get out to a wider audience.
[2:20:42.080 --> 2:20:49.040]  But this is really a battle versus good and evil. And I remember when I was a child growing up and
[2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:52.880]  going to church and hearing all this, my parents told me a lot of different Christian churches
[2:20:52.880 --> 2:20:57.200]  to give me a wider perspective, you know, thinking, okay, yeah, this is pretty wild,
[2:20:57.200 --> 2:21:02.320]  but it touches me at my heart. But now that I've grown up and seen it unfold and seen it manifest,
[2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:07.760]  it's all real. And it turns out the enemy are not a bunch of agnostics or not a bunch of atheists.
[2:21:07.760 --> 2:21:11.280]  They say that because they don't want you knowing about God. Nine times out of 10,
[2:21:11.280 --> 2:21:17.840]  they're actually a cultist. And it's just running rampant. So you got cut off, John Henry Weston
[2:21:18.560 --> 2:21:22.640]  of life site news.com by the break. You were saying something really important.
[2:21:24.400 --> 2:21:30.080]  So we're talking about really the ultimate battle. And it's so funny that it revolves
[2:21:30.080 --> 2:21:34.960]  around sexuality. Think about it. And this is not my insight, by the way,
[2:21:34.960 --> 2:21:42.080]  Peter creeped a great philosopher, theologian abortion, homosexuality, in vitro fertilization,
[2:21:42.080 --> 2:21:48.400]  divorce, contraception, all of these things that form the whole of the culture war today,
[2:21:48.400 --> 2:21:55.600]  pornography, masturbation, all of it. They all seem to revolve around this one thing. In fact,
[2:21:55.600 --> 2:22:01.680]  when for Catholics, especially the crowd will know that our lady of Fatima came 100 years ago to
[2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:07.760]  mourn about the times you're living in. And she said, you know, the devil uses impurity,
[2:22:07.760 --> 2:22:12.480]  sins of the flesh, more than any other to bring people to hell. And it's very, very interesting.
[2:22:12.480 --> 2:22:18.720]  Why that? Well, in one of your clips during the break, you mentioned about our relationship with
[2:22:18.720 --> 2:22:25.440]  God. Funny enough, the scriptures tell us St. Paul, he writes, he says, you know, and when a man
[2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:30.320]  leaves his family and joins himself to the wife, the two become one flesh. And all the teenagers
[2:22:30.320 --> 2:22:34.880]  in the crowd go, oh, I know what he's talking about. But as we mature and grow, we understand,
[2:22:34.880 --> 2:22:39.200]  wait a minute, the next verse there says, but I'm not talking about the marriage relationship,
[2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:43.600]  I'm talking about the relationship between Christ and his church. And that is so key.
[2:22:44.640 --> 2:22:51.360]  Because Jesus, that relationship between Jesus and his church between us and our Lord
[2:22:51.360 --> 2:22:56.080]  is compared in the scriptures to the relationship between a husband and wife. And so that's the
[2:22:56.080 --> 2:23:01.680]  key. We see it every day. God stamped in our all eternity, right from the beginning, that you'd
[2:23:01.680 --> 2:23:04.880]  have this relationship between a husband and wife. And we'd all understand what that is.
[2:23:04.880 --> 2:23:10.000]  This is the family we grow in. And so this is what we know and what we're called to. So if you're
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:16.480]  Satan, and you want to destroy the relationship between God and men, especially between Christ
[2:23:16.480 --> 2:23:23.120]  and us, you want to attack the primary example that the scriptures use. And so he attacks
[2:23:23.120 --> 2:23:31.520]  the marriage relationship. And that's why this LGBT craze, the pornography craze, the even
[2:23:31.520 --> 2:23:36.400]  in vitriol fertilization, which undoes the marriage relationship as the key to procreation,
[2:23:36.400 --> 2:23:43.120]  that's why this is now flooding the earth, because Satan is using it to attack the most
[2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:48.240]  important reality. And so what we were saying before the break about how to resist these things,
[2:23:48.240 --> 2:23:56.080]  no one hates LGBT persons, persons who have this disorder. And it is a disorder of loving someone
[2:23:56.080 --> 2:23:59.440]  or wanting to have sexual relationships with someone of the same sex. No one hates them.
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:06.880]  They just like us are all tempted to sin of all kinds of all sorts of things. And yet,
[2:24:07.520 --> 2:24:12.560]  when they struggle against these temptations to do wrong, to do evil, to harm their own bodies,
[2:24:12.560 --> 2:24:18.560]  and those whom they're with, we too can learn from them and also not do that. We know that it's tough
[2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:24.240]  as a married man to not even look with lust at another woman, but we tend to do it every day.
[2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:30.400]  And so there's strength in stealing yourself in, as the scriptures say, deny yourself,
[2:24:30.400 --> 2:24:34.720]  taking up your cross and following our Lord. It's really the key. It's the key to fighting
[2:24:34.720 --> 2:24:41.600]  Satan and getting right with God. Well, John, expanding on that, there is no doubt that there
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:47.200]  is a governmental corporate attack on human biology and an attempt to separate men and women
[2:24:47.200 --> 2:24:52.400]  and make humans be basically controlled by big pharma. They admit that's their plan,
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:56.880]  the transhumanist plan. So they use all our lust and all our desire to make it look like,
[2:24:56.880 --> 2:25:00.960]  oh, Satan wants you to have this great party. But really, they admit from CIA documents that
[2:25:00.960 --> 2:25:05.120]  were released back in the 70s from the 60s, they wanted to end mothers and fathers of the nuclear
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:09.440]  family because they were strong. They wanted to isolate people and have relationships be empty
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:13.520]  and only about pleasure, not about long-term relationships with your children and really
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:18.640]  things that are so much more valuable than sex. And I like sex. The point is, is that they want
[2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:23.600]  to keep people from maturing and basically arrest their development where there are young fools
[2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:28.560]  that can then be misled, have their sexuality twisted. And then the political system of
[2:25:28.560 --> 2:25:34.480]  Satanism and Aleister Crowley and ritual magic becomes their new religion because they're
[2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:38.480]  looking for the fulfilling sex of a man and a woman together in marriage. So they keep doing
[2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:43.600]  more and more perverted things thinking they're finally going to find the satisfaction when it
[2:25:43.600 --> 2:25:48.960]  was always there in that union of man and woman under God, which is an incredible ritual because
[2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:53.840]  it merges us and creates a new human gift given to us by God. And it's the Satanist that want to
[2:25:53.840 --> 2:26:03.520]  take over that incredible process. Exactly so. And you have right in that is also the separation
[2:26:03.520 --> 2:26:09.520]  of man himself from God because even apart from the marriage relationship, which not everybody
[2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:14.320]  enters for whatever reason, all sorts of them. But even apart from that, we all live in families,
[2:26:14.320 --> 2:26:19.280]  we all have a mother and father, both as an example and hopefully our mentors, but we also have
[2:26:19.280 --> 2:26:24.880]  that understanding of what it should be and therefore that relationship. And so that's wanted
[2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:30.960]  to be destroyed for from the beginning. And now that the sort of government, if you want to call
[2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:37.200]  it that or the global government has taken on this satanic agenda as its own, you can see this push
[2:26:37.200 --> 2:26:41.920]  and we have to fight it with everything we are. Now, the forces already against us
[2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:47.920]  are huge, but they always have been. They were demonic before they were governmental. And so
[2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:54.320]  we might feel like we're little Davids, but little Davids beat Goliath every time.
[2:26:54.320 --> 2:26:59.200]  Rely on our Lord, rely on him. First of all, in your own heart, that's the biggest battle.
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:03.520]  The biggest battle is fighting evil in your own heart and getting yourself right before and with
[2:27:03.520 --> 2:27:09.200]  God because you know what? Ultimately, what you're alive for is one thing. Yes, we might be around
[2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:15.680]  for let's say 70 years, maybe 100 years, but compared to all eternity, millennia upon millennia
[2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:20.880]  upon millennia without even that's not even a blink of the rest of your existence in eternity.
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:27.360]  That 75 or 100 years you live will be but a blip. And in that short blip, you're going to decide
[2:27:27.360 --> 2:27:30.240]  where you're going to spend the rest of eternity. That's what it's all about.
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:35.040]  And the enemy knows that and they want to claw us down into this system with them.
[2:27:35.760 --> 2:27:39.440]  As it becomes more and more obvious, what do you expect to happen in society?
[2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:43.520]  I already see a great separation happening and biblically we're told that's going to happen.
[2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:52.320]  Well, absolutely. In Matthew 24, 24, where our Lord speaks really about what is to come.
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:56.000]  He says something very interesting. He talks about wars and rumors of wars,
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:59.680]  great earthquakes happening and all sorts of things, a lot of which we've already seen.
[2:28:00.240 --> 2:28:04.000]  But he mentions over and over and over again Antichrist, a religious figure. And you alerted
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:09.680]  to it just earlier when you said about how the powers that be aren't really atheists. They're
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:15.520]  really occultists. And this is what we're heading for. The human heart is made for faith. We can't
[2:28:15.520 --> 2:28:20.160]  have this vacuum of everybody pretending to be atheists because they're not. They make a God
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:24.400]  of something. We've made a God of money. We've made a God of now. The new vaccine has become a
[2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:31.040]  sacrament in this new world order type of religion. But interestingly, that will always come. So
[2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:35.520]  Antichrist is coming who will be a religious figure because we can't be a religious. We're
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:41.840]  going to be religious. And whether we choose God or anti God or anti Christ will be the question.
[2:28:41.840 --> 2:28:48.240]  And so I believe that that's coming. And it's already here a lot of ways. We are going to go
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:53.200]  west and stay there. Let's come back and talk about that. I agree. The Antichrist spirit is here
[2:28:53.200 --> 2:29:01.280]  with us now. Where is it going next? Christmas 2021 is over. But you still got a really great
[2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:06.960]  chance to give yourself the gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year all the
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:12.400]  same time making yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser by boosting your immune system.

[2:29:56.240 --> 2:30:03.440]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the
[2:30:03.440 --> 2:30:10.400]  globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial
[2:30:10.400 --> 2:30:15.280]  collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's
[2:30:15.280 --> 2:30:19.520]  important to have. It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with

[2:31:22.000 --> 2:31:25.360]  The Mexican government takeover. So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying
[2:31:25.360 --> 2:31:29.120]  it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under
[2:31:29.120 --> 2:31:33.440]  another name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're
[2:31:33.440 --> 2:31:37.920]  going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[2:31:38.800 --> 2:31:40.400]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[2:31:43.360 --> 2:31:49.280]  We had like that. Okay, you won't believe it. Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how
[2:31:49.280 --> 2:31:52.400]  we fund this operation. And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[2:31:57.120 --> 2:32:02.000]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in-game blueprint for global
[2:32:02.000 --> 2:32:07.680]  enslavement. And in that documentary, I predicted the globalist would establish world government
[2:32:07.680 --> 2:32:13.680]  of releasing a virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a collapse
[2:32:13.680 --> 2:32:18.880]  of our industrial society. And now they've done it. How did I know they would do it? Because
[2:32:18.880 --> 2:32:24.000]  they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked.
[2:32:24.960 --> 2:32:28.240]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group, who's head at the time,
[2:32:28.240 --> 2:32:32.880]  was Klaus Schwab. And our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning
[2:32:32.880 --> 2:32:37.760]  to launch this great reset. Well, we're now living in it. The purposeful collapse of the
[2:32:37.760 --> 2:32:42.560]  third world and the first world on its ass is a tyrannical corporate world government.
[2:32:42.560 --> 2:32:48.400]  The total censorship, no due process, destruction of the family, and then incrementally more and
[2:32:48.400 --> 2:32:54.160]  more deadly injections of poison mass creating as vaccines to poisonous in the populace.
[2:32:54.160 --> 2:33:23.040]  This is what Info Wars is fighting. We're fighting for the future.
[2:33:23.040 --> 2:33:28.240]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:29.600 --> 2:33:33.840]  I mean, I look at some of the headlines. They're now announcing after the past,
[2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:39.600]  what we told you about six months ago, the stimulus bill and the transportation bill,
[2:33:40.640 --> 2:33:46.000]  the infrastructure bill, both had legislation and about tracker chips to track everywhere you go
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:52.880]  and what you do inside of your cars and to kill switch your cars. And now we've got these headlines.
[2:33:52.880 --> 2:34:00.400]  UK government greases kids for fleets of surveillance drones over cities to force compliance with all
[2:34:00.400 --> 2:34:06.560]  the new rules. And Klaus Schwab says there will be a lot of the robots soon. All cars sold in
[2:34:06.560 --> 2:34:12.560]  EU to be fitted with data recording black box. It's all breaking. Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:34:12.560 --> 2:34:17.360]  that's why John Henry Weston is here. I've watched so many his interviews, so many his shows
[2:34:17.360 --> 2:34:22.960]  three or four times a week. I end up, you know, watching lengthy interviews he does
[2:34:22.960 --> 2:34:27.600]  with so many great awake people. And what I know is they're followers of Christ. I don't
[2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:32.480]  get into Baptist or Catholic or any of this. I'm not a Pharisee up here judging people. God does
[2:34:32.480 --> 2:34:37.760]  that. I judge a tree by its fruits. And I just see a lot of great people that call themselves.
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:44.160]  Baptist call themselves. Catholic call themselves. We love Jesus. We don't want the anti Christ
[2:34:44.160 --> 2:34:48.560]  system. And we're trying to stand up and say no. And I talk about bad things I've done because I
[2:34:48.560 --> 2:34:54.160]  love God, but I'm not perfect. I'm not a hypocrite. And so you call me non-denominational, whatever.
[2:34:54.160 --> 2:35:00.640]  I just want to oppose the anti Christ system. And at the end of the day, that's why you can
[2:35:00.640 --> 2:35:06.480]  see some of the most ardent opponents of this current Pope or Catholics, because they can point
[2:35:06.480 --> 2:35:10.240]  out what's happening in their own house. Are we pointing out what our own preachers and other
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:15.040]  groups are doing? So you were getting into the anti Christ. I mean, I see this Pope, I'm not
[2:35:15.040 --> 2:35:20.480]  saying he's the anti Christ, but the things he's promoting is the exact Klaus Schwab agenda. So
[2:35:20.480 --> 2:35:25.760]  is Klaus Schwab promoting anti Christ agenda? Yes. Is this current Pope pushing it? Absolutely.
[2:35:25.760 --> 2:35:29.680]  What do you think of this? Or what's your view of this? And because you were at break,
[2:35:29.680 --> 2:35:33.120]  you were getting into this anti Christ spirit. It's clearly getting really strong.
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:41.680]  Yes, it is. It is. And probably the most severe sign that it's getting strong is, in fact,
[2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:50.240]  the Pope. In fact, the Masons had an agenda to bring the Pope on site. That was already 500
[2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:54.960]  years ago. And it appears we've already got that now. They were first saying, we're going to bring
[2:35:54.960 --> 2:35:59.680]  one of our own to be public. No, no, no, we don't have to do that. We just have to bring on site.
[2:35:59.680 --> 2:36:07.520]  It's one of the greatest signs of the end times that we see the Pope now taking on an anti
[2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:12.880]  Christ agenda. And what is that agenda? That agenda is the same one that says that same-sex
[2:36:12.880 --> 2:36:17.920]  civil unions are okay to do when the church is always opposed. It says that in great circumstances
[2:36:17.920 --> 2:36:23.120]  you can just use contraception, which the church is always opposed. It says that, you know,
[2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:27.920]  cohabitation is real marriage and has the grace of real marriage. All of these things,
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:34.640]  this Pope has done. It so flies in the face of 2,000 years of consistent church teaching.
[2:36:34.640 --> 2:36:39.680]  It's unbelievable. But it's not only him. It's also those who call themselves Catholic. For
[2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:45.440]  instance, in Canada, we have Justin Trudeau who calls himself a Catholic. Now, you always know
[2:36:45.440 --> 2:36:52.240]  the anti-Catholic agenda by following what these fake Catholics do. So Justin Trudeau just called
[2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:59.040]  those who oppose the vaccine, the so-called vaccine, racist and misogynist. Now, this is hilarious
[2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:02.800]  coming from a person who himself has done blackface and there's video of him, of course,
[2:37:02.800 --> 2:37:06.640]  is all censored, doing blackface. But not only that, that's a woke agenda that I don't think is
[2:37:06.640 --> 2:37:11.520]  really racist anyway. But nonetheless, he did it, still calls those of us who oppose the vaccine,
[2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:16.240]  racist and misogynist. This is the same prime minister that during one of the debates,
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:22.640]  went and elbowed a woman in Parliament. This isn't in the chest, by the way. This,
[2:37:22.640 --> 2:37:30.240]  this is absolute insanity. The hypocrisy coming from here is just mind boggling. But we see that
[2:37:30.240 --> 2:37:33.600]  everywhere. Well, since you raised Trudeau because I know you live in Canada, let me ask you a few
[2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:38.480]  questions. Because I look at the crazy prime minister saying, orgy 25 people in New Zealand and
[2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:42.320]  don't look at the sunset and don't talk to your neighbors. You think, okay, it can't get much
[2:37:42.320 --> 2:37:48.000]  worse than he, Trudeau, as you know, says, I like communism like Gigi Ping. It's my favorite system.
[2:37:48.560 --> 2:37:54.080]  And then yeah, elbows the woman runs around like a maniac says last week. Yeah, we're attacking
[2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:59.520]  and getting rid of your basic freedoms, including the provinces. I mean, he's like a cartoon character,
[2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:05.200]  like a money python skit of tyranny. So out of all these horrible people, he's one of the worst.
[2:38:05.200 --> 2:38:09.360]  I mean, he's almost as bad as Kim Jong-un. What is who is this maniac?
[2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:19.440]  This maniac is the son of one of the first maniacs. It was actually his dad, Pierre Trudeau,
[2:38:19.440 --> 2:38:25.360]  who actually first brought into Canada legalization, both first contraception, then abortion,
[2:38:25.360 --> 2:38:32.240]  homosexuality, and really opening the floodgates to immorality. And this is just the natural
[2:38:32.240 --> 2:38:39.120]  progression of that opening to the satanic of that opening to flouting of God's law.
[2:38:39.120 --> 2:38:46.400]  And all in the name of faith, it's so funny, the corruption of Catholicism, particularly,
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:52.480]  is so evident here when you see it. And if you really want to find out, I said, as the anti-Catholic
[2:38:52.480 --> 2:38:58.240]  agenda, you always watch the leftist faith Catholics who are really the most anti-Catholic people,
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:05.680]  in a way, also because they know exactly what buttons to push to go perfectly against the faith
[2:39:05.680 --> 2:39:09.920]  and against the will of God. Well, let's expand on that. Take the pedophile rings that infiltrated
[2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:14.720]  the Catholic Church. Now we see it's in the Boy Scouts. It's in major universities. It's in
[2:39:14.720 --> 2:39:19.280]  everywhere. It's in the public schools. This is a group that knows how to bring these groups in
[2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:28.640]  and take over. Indeed, it is. This is an agenda which seeks to attack and work its way in. And it
[2:39:28.640 --> 2:39:33.760]  is demonic. And when you arrive, you know, the scripture says something interesting. It says,
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:38.880]  when you see the abomination of desolation in the holy place, that's when to know things are really
[2:39:38.880 --> 2:39:45.360]  bad. And it's very interesting because we do have a holy place. All the holy places marked by Christ,
[2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:51.360]  the place of His resurrection, the place of His birth, and Rome, where St. Peter was the first
[2:39:51.360 --> 2:39:58.000]  pope and was crucified. Yeah, built the church. The marks of Christianity are all over the place.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:05.280]  You ever go to Rome, you go and witness all the places where the apostles themselves suffered
[2:40:05.280 --> 2:40:09.520]  martyrdom and everything else. All of the history of Christianity is all right there.
[2:40:10.240 --> 2:40:17.120]  And that's right now where you see this pope taking on this agenda. The abomination of desolation
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:20.240]  has hit the holy place. I think we need to wake up and look at what's going on.
[2:40:21.280 --> 2:40:25.840]  So is it fair to say that, I mean, this guy is fully conscious of what he's doing because,
[2:40:25.840 --> 2:40:31.600]  I mean, obviously, he could just be blackmailed. Or is he consciously 100% behind the agenda?
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:36.960]  Because you look at him, like I said, it's lockstep with the UN lockstep with Klaus Schwab.
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:45.600]  It's a very interesting question. He has a history of being leftist. So perhaps when I did ask one
[2:40:45.600 --> 2:40:51.280]  of the Cardinals this once, you know, who was close to him, if he really believes what he's saying,
[2:40:51.280 --> 2:40:56.160]  or if he's just putting this on for an act for power or maybe he's being manipulated or what.
[2:40:57.360 --> 2:41:03.360]  The Cardinals seem to think, yeah, he actually believes it. What we know is one very interesting
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:10.000]  thing. And this is where the little people, as I would count myself in, and all of us have real
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:17.600]  power. You see, the demons are convicted. They're convinced. But with the other side, who are still
[2:41:17.600 --> 2:41:23.920]  in human form, they have the opportunity of conversion. Saint Paul was a monster. Saint Paul
[2:41:23.920 --> 2:41:30.480]  went and dragged Christians out of their homes and killed them. And so he was feared by everyone at
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:36.240]  the time. And yet he converted. We have the opportunity to pray for the conversion of people
[2:41:36.240 --> 2:41:42.640]  like Pierre Trudeau, excuse me, Justin Trudeau, but also Pope Francis. And you know, if these people
[2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:46.960]  converted had a Pauline conversion, our Lord would knock them off their horses, if you will,
[2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:51.920]  and show them the truth. They could become the greatest evangelists. And so we still have
[2:41:51.920 --> 2:41:58.480]  that opportunity because among Satan's cohorts, he has all these human actors that need to play
[2:41:58.480 --> 2:42:03.440]  their part. And they're susceptible to change. They're susceptible to the grace of Christ. And
[2:42:03.440 --> 2:42:07.840]  we got to pray for them, pray for the conversions. And here's a Catholic asking you, begging you
[2:42:07.840 --> 2:42:10.320]  to pray along with me for the conversion of Pope Francis.
[2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:18.080]  Well, Christ told us to pray for our enemies. Absolutely. Because of Saint Paul said that
[2:42:18.080 --> 2:42:22.320]  we're keeping close upon their heads. We're going to come back in a final segment and know
[2:42:22.320 --> 2:42:27.200]  why I got John Henry Weston, he's a smart guy, lifestylenews.com. And they are fighting the
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:30.400]  poison shots. They're fighting the market of the beast. They're fighting the whole global.
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:34.000]  So, you know, we'll talk some about the big interviews. I mean, you see interviews on there.
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:39.120]  You're going to see anywhere else that are banned everywhere at Banda video. They are alive and well.
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:42.400]  And that's why all you keep on us on here is so important because you're not just
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:47.200]  keeping info wars on there. You're keeping all these other great voices like lifestylenews.com
[2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:49.200]  with another place where they get the truth out. Stay with us.
[2:42:57.200 --> 2:43:01.280]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup
[2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:07.520]  for what the globalists are doing right now. This is their big offensive. This is their takeover.
[2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:11.600]  And this is the point that they're very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[2:43:11.600 --> 2:43:15.840]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out in
[2:43:15.840 --> 2:43:20.800]  the open. Their depopulation agenda has been exposed. But they're using their corporate
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:25.360]  power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:29.040]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for the
[2:43:29.040 --> 2:43:33.360]  broadcast, you're the tip of the spear. And when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[2:43:33.360 --> 2:43:36.880]  you keep us on air. Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months
[2:43:36.880 --> 2:43:43.280]  that are back in stock, 50% off, X2 and Winter Sun. Both of these are on our top five best
[2:43:43.280 --> 2:43:47.200]  sellers. They are so good for your body. And if there's two things you do for your body,
[2:43:47.200 --> 2:43:51.760]  it's these two products. They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off,
[2:43:51.760 --> 2:44:18.240]  and it keeps us on the air. Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[2:44:21.760 --> 2:44:28.000]  Program after collapsing us of build back better. This is nothing more than a top down
[2:44:28.640 --> 2:44:33.600]  vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns because
[2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:38.400]  we wouldn't bow because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system,
[2:44:38.400 --> 2:44:44.880]  couldn't win. They released a biological weapon on us. Now we know two years ago,
[2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:49.200]  we learned about it about 20 months ago. It's that simple. They can't maybe because of our
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:54.320]  free speech and our guns. So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:45:00.960]  of history. Expose this paradigm and we win. I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years
[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:06.480]  against the globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop
[2:45:06.480 --> 2:45:11.440]  them dead in their tracks before they went operational, but we failed. Yes, a lot of people
[2:45:11.440 --> 2:45:16.960]  are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full
[2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:22.000]  operational deindustrialization, great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:27.040]  that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready
[2:45:27.040 --> 2:45:31.120]  to wake up and ready to hear the truth. So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying
[2:45:31.120 --> 2:45:35.200]  to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one
[2:45:35.200 --> 2:45:39.200]  things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food ready to ship at very
[2:45:39.200 --> 2:45:44.480]  affordable prices at infowarstore.com. So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply

[2:46:05.520 --> 2:46:10.800]  never get the ingredients again until now. And we have reformulated and not just use the same
[2:46:10.800 --> 2:46:16.160]  ingredients. We've boosted it and made them even stronger. So out of all the bone broths out there,

[2:46:55.760 --> 2:47:15.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones to the town of
[2:47:15.200 --> 2:47:23.200]  our free road is straight to one fine day. Well, I'm a big fan of John Henry Weston and
[2:47:23.200 --> 2:47:27.920]  following his work for more than 15 years plus. I don't know how long life sight news has been
[2:47:27.920 --> 2:47:33.200]  there. Maybe 20 years. I don't remember so long. And he just does great work and to see the huge
[2:47:33.200 --> 2:47:37.360]  conferences they have and how they bring everybody together. It's so beautiful. And he's absolutely
[2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:41.280]  right. You know, you've got a Catholic person here calling out this corrupt pope, not to bash
[2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:45.760]  Catholics, but to tell the truth, just like we could do all day long. Those of us that are in
[2:47:45.760 --> 2:47:50.720]  a different denomination. The point is we love Christ, judge, Christ judges the heart. I think
[2:47:50.720 --> 2:47:54.880]  it's really important for all of us to come together around the teachings of Christ and the
[2:47:54.880 --> 2:48:00.160]  Bible, especially as we go into these very, very dark times ahead. And it's a lot of great
[2:48:00.160 --> 2:48:04.400]  conservative Catholics like him that I see at the front lines actually opposing this evil. So
[2:48:05.120 --> 2:48:11.680]  I just want to ask you here, if you feel comfortable doing it, just to lead us all in a prayer to God
[2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:20.160]  for awakening and just whatever touches your heart. Oh, absolutely. In the name of the Father, and of
[2:48:20.160 --> 2:48:30.960]  the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen. Eternal Father, in the most holy name of Jesus, by the
[2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:39.440]  infinite merits of his most precious blood, we beg thee to send thy Holy Spirit with his graces,
[2:48:39.440 --> 2:48:46.320]  his healing powers upon us, that we might know and do thy will, that we might spread thy truth
[2:48:47.440 --> 2:48:54.240]  through the ends of the earth. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
[2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:59.840]  Amen. Amen. All right, powerful. Well, in closing the time we have, I want you to come
[2:48:59.840 --> 2:49:03.920]  co-sometimes be like or come to town to be like, but you can also just big picture what else you
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:06.960]  want to get out there, folks, and also tell us what the amazing stuff you're doing over at
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:11.440]  Lifesight News, because to me, I see other great organizations out there that makes me feel stronger
[2:49:11.440 --> 2:49:19.120]  and better during these dark times. Well, Lifesight News, we've been around nearly 25 years now.
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:26.080]  We cover life, faith, family freedom. We've got just an incredible team. I can't say enough about
[2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:31.280]  the incredible reporters, the videographers, the video reporters that are there. We're putting out
[2:49:31.280 --> 2:49:37.040]  shows more and more. We're doing really well, and then got banned on YouTube, which is no surprise.
[2:49:37.040 --> 2:49:43.280]  We got kicked off Twitter, and so we're very much, you can always go to LifesightNews.com
[2:49:43.280 --> 2:49:46.720]  at the top right hand side. You'll find the watch button. We'll always be there,
[2:49:46.720 --> 2:49:55.120]  and thanks to you, we're on banned.video as well. We're basically there to offer the truth and to
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:50:01.200]  give many people what they need to know in order to live in our times, and really to live lives
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:07.680]  of faith and fidelity to Christ. We have great, great guests. One of the
[2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:13.520]  people that I spoke to about this insanity that we're living in today is Dr. Peter McCullough,
[2:50:13.520 --> 2:50:18.720]  and I know you've had him on before as well. He's just an absolute genius. Who's also being banned
[2:50:18.720 --> 2:50:24.320]  everywhere? Baylor's trying to go after him, and they booted him out already of everything.
[2:50:24.880 --> 2:50:30.320]  It's incredible, yet one of the most published researchers, scientists on this whole question,
[2:50:30.320 --> 2:50:36.080]  like nobody else is, yet banned from the public square being taken out of this conversation,
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:43.760]  where he is the number one expert. We also have had many people who have brought forward the truth,
[2:50:43.760 --> 2:50:47.200]  and some brought forward the truth on life. That's one of the most important things we're
[2:50:47.200 --> 2:50:53.680]  facing. We always think of ourselves today as such a civilized society, not like the
[2:50:53.680 --> 2:50:58.080]  barbarism from before, and yet we have a barbarism now more than any-
[2:50:58.080 --> 2:51:02.320]  Oh, it's all hidden. The old barbarism was out in the open. Now it's all hidden.
[2:51:03.680 --> 2:51:10.480]  Exactly. It's all done under white lab coats. In fact, if you add up the number of deaths from
[2:51:10.480 --> 2:51:17.280]  all the world wars ever, all the wars of all the world, you will still never come to the number
[2:51:17.280 --> 2:51:23.040]  of unborn children killed in the womb that we have done since the 1960s. It's an unbelievable
[2:51:23.040 --> 2:51:27.520]  slaughter, like never before, like nothing else. And not the way you know this, but I want you to
[2:51:27.520 --> 2:51:31.920]  elaborate on this. The Satanists aren't stupid. They know when they get us to commit that the
[2:51:31.920 --> 2:51:35.760]  hedge of protection goes away, which lets them take over. That's why they try to get us to
[2:51:35.760 --> 2:51:42.000]  commit crimes against children, correct? Yeah, well, this is, we knew this going in.
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:49.120]  When they were doing the child sacrifices back in South America, this was the great, you know,
[2:51:49.120 --> 2:51:54.240]  conversion of the South America, that when this is how our native Guadalupe appeared,
[2:51:54.240 --> 2:52:01.600]  you had millions of pagans convert to the faith. At the same time, by the way, that things were
[2:52:01.600 --> 2:52:06.640]  going on in Europe where the faith was being abandoned by many, many, you had this incredible
[2:52:06.640 --> 2:52:11.440]  conversion. Why? Because they saw their eyes were opened to the slaughter of the innocents.
[2:52:11.440 --> 2:52:17.280]  And yet today we see it as women's rights, as safe procedures, safer than what it's always-
[2:52:17.280 --> 2:52:22.960]  But explain how like 400 guys took over all of Mexico and Guatemala today because they said
[2:52:22.960 --> 2:52:27.440]  it's wrong to kill kids and their hearts already knew it was wrong. They were doing child sacrifice.
[2:52:27.440 --> 2:52:31.440]  That's what caused the conversion and the collapse of the Aztec empire. That's actually
[2:52:31.440 --> 2:52:33.680]  in the history. That's just not taught. Explain that to people.
[2:52:35.280 --> 2:52:42.400]  Yeah, it is, it is very evident from history. Everybody wonders why in Mexico you have this
[2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:49.520]  great outpouring of faith back in the 1500s. What's going on? Well, it was because of the
[2:52:49.520 --> 2:52:55.440]  recognition of the harm that they were doing and the great visions of what happened. There's a story
[2:52:55.440 --> 2:52:59.840]  of what happened. I'd ask your listeners to look it up of our native Guadalupe. They can find that
[2:52:59.840 --> 2:53:05.280]  out very easily from the history books. But it's an incredible thing that people were convicted
[2:53:05.280 --> 2:53:10.560]  of the killing of the innocent that they were doing. And we talked already about earlier how
[2:53:10.560 --> 2:53:17.040]  that's satanic. We've got to recognize that today that we are doing this. We are guilty of this like
[2:53:17.040 --> 2:53:22.480]  it no other time in history. But there's one interesting fact. Romans 828. Look it up because
[2:53:22.480 --> 2:53:28.880]  it says where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more. Remember Alex said earlier in this program,
[2:53:28.880 --> 2:53:34.240]  you were born to live today. And that means our Lord will provide you with the grace you need
[2:53:34.240 --> 2:53:40.160]  today to not only survive but to thrive. And when I say thrive, I don't mean necessarily thrive in
[2:53:40.160 --> 2:53:45.680]  business or whatever. I need to thrive into eternal life. And so yes, we're living at probably some
[2:53:45.680 --> 2:53:51.200]  of the most horrible times ever. But we will have more grace than ever before to deal with.
[2:53:51.200 --> 2:53:55.280]  And please allow me to tell the story of being like 18 years old and I'd been involved in some
[2:53:55.280 --> 2:53:59.600]  abortions. And I wasn't getting from preachers to feel bad. I literally felt convicted empathetic
[2:53:59.600 --> 2:54:04.480]  and dirty. And then I literally got touched by the Holy Spirit. I said, I'm sorry. Help me.
[2:54:04.480 --> 2:54:09.600]  And my whole journey politically, the big awakening happened with God saying, I'm going to
[2:54:09.600 --> 2:54:14.480]  fix you. But here's what you did. And it was that conviction was so strong. And you're saying
[2:54:14.480 --> 2:54:20.400]  that's the archetype of what woke Mexico up. That's powerful. It is absolutely. And for all
[2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:24.640]  those people who are interested in it, I know everybody comes with the same story. Oh, what
[2:54:24.640 --> 2:54:30.240]  about rape and incest? You know what? There was a young lady who was taken up with that question
[2:54:30.240 --> 2:54:34.960]  herself. She was sitting on an abortion picket line. And she was asked, what about rape and
[2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:40.880]  incest? And you know what the response was? If you're going to kill somebody, why don't you
[2:54:40.880 --> 2:54:48.960]  start with the guilty rapist before the innocent child? And that answer really focuses us on what
[2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:54.800]  abortion really is. It is the taking of an innocent child's life for the sin of the dad when you're
[2:54:54.800 --> 2:55:00.480]  talking about rape or incest or whatever. So we really got to wake up. We got to see this greatest
[2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:06.160]  atrocity for what it is. We got to repent because the blood of these innocents cries to heaven
[2:55:06.160 --> 2:55:10.160]  for vengeance. And God only knows the sufferings that we're all enduring right now might be for
[2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:15.680]  that very blood. Well, I totally agree with you. So what is from your religious research or spiritual
[2:55:15.680 --> 2:55:20.080]  research? Because because I knew that story out of Mexico, but I never really thought about it.
[2:55:20.080 --> 2:55:24.880]  For me personally, it was being convicted for what I'd done by the Holy Spirit really strong
[2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:29.120]  that then gave me my mission. Not as some atonement. It was like, well, just follow me to what I say
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:33.440]  that's going to happen that came out of all this in my love of life. Because I'd like, oh, lie to
[2:55:33.440 --> 2:55:38.000]  myself, this isn't really killing a human. It's whatever that God touched my heart. And you're
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:43.280]  saying that that's a big event in Mexico as well. What do you call that process? Because
[2:55:43.280 --> 2:55:47.200]  because that's what a lot of people are involved in abortion. Then they just sign on to evil and
[2:55:47.200 --> 2:55:52.720]  harden their heart instead of softening their heart the other direction. That's right. And so you
[2:55:52.720 --> 2:55:59.120]  always have two choices when confronted with evil, it smacks you in the face, and you either decide
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:06.320]  for God or against him. And that is that final decision we have to make. Everybody comes to
[2:56:06.320 --> 2:56:10.560]  it differently. I came to it myself. But one of the things that helped me over that hump,
[2:56:10.560 --> 2:56:14.720]  because you come to a crisis of faith, right when you're presented with the truth, the ultimate truth,
[2:56:14.720 --> 2:56:19.200]  whether that is the killing of the innocence or whatever it is, you're confronted with one thing.
[2:56:19.200 --> 2:56:24.880]  Do I believe in God or not? That's ultimately the question it comes down to. And you know,
[2:56:24.880 --> 2:56:31.440]  for me, it was an amazing thing because I had a dad who was very holy. I always dismissed him as
[2:56:32.320 --> 2:56:37.040]  sometimes conspiracy theorist, but a real holy wacko because he went to mass every day. He prayed
[2:56:37.040 --> 2:56:41.360]  his rosary every day. And I thought, ah, whatever, what a silly old man. I come home from clubbing
[2:56:41.360 --> 2:56:46.560]  and he'd be there praying at two in the morning. But you know what? When I had my crisis of faith,
[2:56:46.560 --> 2:56:52.080]  and I realized that the forces of evil had control over me and I had to decide what to do,
[2:56:54.160 --> 2:56:57.760]  I wanted to ask him, dad, is it true? Just tell me if it's true. But you know what?
[2:56:57.760 --> 2:57:02.800]  When I got to him to ask him the question, it was his life that spoke to me. He was made fun of for
[2:57:02.800 --> 2:57:07.680]  being such a hardcore, you know, daily mass, daily rosary type of Catholic. But you know,
[2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:14.560]  that witness of faith is what convinced me it's all true. I know it's true because of the
[2:57:14.560 --> 2:57:19.520]  sufferings he endured for living it. And if he was going to endure that suffering,
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:24.320]  not for nothing, just like all the apostles, all the apostles were killed, except for John.
[2:57:24.320 --> 2:57:27.680]  They tried to kill him. They tried to boil him in oil. It didn't work.
[2:57:27.680 --> 2:57:33.600]  All right, John, this is powerful. Do five more minutes with us then. Gerald Salente takes over

[2:59:48.720 --> 2:59:54.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:03.200 --> 3:00:07.360]  There are a lot of people that are so close to God, they end up basically locking themselves up in
[3:00:07.360 --> 3:00:11.680]  their houses for most of their life because they can see the evil so clear. And they do a great
[3:00:11.680 --> 3:00:16.720]  job raising sons and daughters that end up fighting evil. But in my experience, it's going to be the
[3:00:16.720 --> 3:00:20.000]  sons or daughters actually go out in the world and see the corruption and come back with the
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:24.240]  prodigal sons that end up being some of the greatest leaders. So John Henry Weston, who just
[3:00:24.240 --> 3:00:29.280]  joined us, is the founder and CEO and head go over life site news.com doing a great job.
[3:00:29.840 --> 3:00:34.240]  And he was talking about his father intense. But as a maturity, he saw what a great example
[3:00:34.240 --> 3:00:39.520]  his father was. And now think about your father's success through what you do, reaching millions
[3:00:39.520 --> 3:00:44.400]  of people a day. I don't know if your father's still alive, but if he is, or obviously in heaven,
[3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:52.080]  he's probably very, very proud of you, John. It's a great grace. He passed now about 10 years ago.
[3:00:52.080 --> 3:00:58.880]  And what a witness of faith. And really, it is for all of us to be that same witness of faith,
[3:00:58.880 --> 3:01:05.600]  both work children and to those who we know, because when we can live out our faith, also with
[3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:11.840]  great love and great humility, I think that's what really gets to people. Yes, sometimes we wear our
[3:01:11.840 --> 3:01:16.400]  hearts on our sleeves and we get beat up for it. You know what? So what Jesus said, take up your
[3:01:16.400 --> 3:01:22.640]  cross and follow me. And he got beat up a lot. And tell me about your awakening. How happy
[3:01:22.640 --> 3:01:29.120]  was it? Was it a process or overnight? And how happy did that make your father? Yeah, so it was,
[3:01:29.120 --> 3:01:35.280]  it was a process because at first I got in trouble because I was doing really bad stuff, both with,
[3:01:35.280 --> 3:01:40.960]  originally with pornography, then got involved with like illegal activity at school stealing
[3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:47.440]  things and so on. Then when I was about 17, 18, got in trouble with the law driving with a license
[3:01:47.440 --> 3:01:51.440]  because I had too many times speeding tickets. And really, when I got in trouble, that's when I
[3:01:51.440 --> 3:01:57.120]  sort of went, oh no, what do I do now? I tried to turn back to God for kind of a Catholic lucky
[3:01:57.120 --> 3:02:02.400]  term so that I could carry, I can do Sundays for an hour, no problem. But it was reading a book
[3:02:03.200 --> 3:02:08.720]  about the faith. It was called Tritivation of Mary. It was, it's actually a book about giving your
[3:02:08.720 --> 3:02:15.120]  whole life over to Christ the same way Mary did in saying, you know, I'm all on the handmaid of
[3:02:15.120 --> 3:02:21.600]  Lord, that kind of slavery to God. And I thought, oh boy, I can't, that's all day every day. That's no
[3:02:21.600 --> 3:02:28.640]  lucky charm for an hour a week. But if it's true, I'll do it. And that's when I actually took the
[3:02:28.640 --> 3:02:32.320]  book, put it under my arm and had this whole little speech for Dad, Dad, tell me one thing,
[3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:36.000]  because you love me because I know you put up with all my crap. So tell me this one thing,
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:40.880]  is this true? If it's true, I'll do it. But it means giving away my whole life. I don't want to do
[3:02:40.880 --> 3:02:46.400]  that if it's not true. So just tell me, is this true? Because you love me, tell me. And I actually
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:53.200]  couldn't ask him the question. His whole life, especially the persecutions, I watched family
[3:02:53.200 --> 3:02:59.200]  members tell myself, say silly old man, I watched family members smack him in the head for being,
[3:02:59.200 --> 3:03:06.880]  you know, too religious. I watched his colleagues at work call him a nut and crazy. He endured
[3:03:06.880 --> 3:03:13.120]  all of that happily in a way, because he was so happy to suffer something for Christ. I knew
[3:03:13.120 --> 3:03:17.840]  when he was dying, I actually couldn't get to him. I was trying to get to him so that I could be
[3:03:17.840 --> 3:03:23.760]  with him there for his last few moments. But I knew when I was going there, I was going there
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:30.800]  for my own consolation, not for his. He had lived all his life to be able to meet Jesus.
[3:03:30.800 --> 3:03:40.400]  And he was meeting him. He was a real winner. He was, he was, he was the most. Anyway, I owe my
[3:03:40.400 --> 3:03:45.040]  dad my faith and therefore my relationship with God, which is absolutely everything.
[3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:51.920]  Well, that's a beautiful interview. Well, John Henry, thank you so much for the time.
[3:03:51.920 --> 3:03:56.000]  But watch what you do over at Live Sight News and join us again very, very soon. We really
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:04:00.480]  appreciate you joining us in all the great work you do fighting this poison. They're
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:05.600]  pushing on us. Thanks so much for letting me come on. God bless you and all of your listeners.
[3:04:05.600 --> 3:04:11.360]  You too. Well, John Henry Weston is not a coward. He's gotten banned everywhere with his huge site
[3:04:11.360 --> 3:04:15.200]  25 years up and running to tell the truth about the shots. At the end of the day,
[3:04:15.200 --> 3:04:18.640]  you're going to choose what side you're on, folks. You better choose widely because this
[3:04:18.640 --> 3:04:23.040]  isn't a game. It's not a joke. God's watching everything we do. I'm going to come back with
[3:04:23.040 --> 3:04:28.480]  a few more stories and then we're going to have, we're going to have Gerald Salente take over.
[3:04:28.480 --> 3:04:33.600]  But I really appreciate Mr. Weston on the show. And I covered a lot of stuff and I blew up some
[3:04:33.600 --> 3:04:37.920]  today because this is a very painful time because they're attacking our children. But at the end
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:42.160]  of the day, we're not supposed to be comfortable. We're supposed to be upset and engaged with what's
[3:04:42.160 --> 3:04:46.160]  going on and trying to be Christlike. Lord knows I need to be more like that. All right,
[3:04:46.160 --> 3:04:52.320]  we'll be right back in 60 seconds. Introduce Gerald Salente and Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[3:04:52.320 --> 3:05:02.160]  New and run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia
[3:05:02.160 --> 3:05:06.800]  to the United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you do
[3:05:06.800 --> 3:05:11.280]  everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually taking
[3:05:11.280 --> 3:05:17.360]  people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next year to expand
[3:05:17.360 --> 3:05:22.560]  their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities
[3:05:22.560 --> 3:05:27.280]  for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back
[3:05:27.280 --> 3:05:32.480]  is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant,
[3:05:32.480 --> 3:05:38.560]  meaning US government military grade at infowarstore.com. We have the entire line of silent
[3:05:38.560 --> 3:05:44.080]  pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com. Again, we have big backpacks,
[3:05:44.080 --> 3:05:48.560]  we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones, we've got them for laptops,
[3:05:48.560 --> 3:05:53.920]  we've got them for iPads. It's all there at infowarstore.com. So protect your privacy today
[3:05:53.920 --> 3:06:20.960]  and support the infowar at infowarstore.com. Well, I just got hit by the truth during that
[3:06:20.960 --> 3:06:27.680]  60 second break. And it's this, I apologize to the listeners and I apologize to the crew and I
[3:06:27.680 --> 3:06:33.840]  apologized to God and everybody else watching for shooting my mouth off about quitting last Friday
[3:06:33.840 --> 3:06:40.160]  and a little bit today. I'm not going to do that. It's not that I want to quit because I'm scared
[3:06:40.160 --> 3:06:45.680]  of the new world order. It's not that I want to quit because I don't care about all of you. I'm just
[3:06:45.680 --> 3:06:52.960]  sick of focusing on these people and I get why the general public ignores all the evil and just
[3:06:52.960 --> 3:06:59.280]  lets them take over because it's so disgusting to engage with it. But at the end of the day,
[3:06:59.280 --> 3:07:04.240]  we've got to do it and we've got to defeat it. And that's why I get mad at their talk show hosts
[3:07:04.240 --> 3:07:10.560]  that I know. I'm not talking about Tucker Carlson or Joe Rogan. They've really stepped up and are
[3:07:10.560 --> 3:07:14.560]  doing a great job. And I'm not up here judging them like I'm the grandpa or something. I'm just
[3:07:14.560 --> 3:07:19.360]  telling you like it is. From my perspective, you can judge me too. I got my own problems. Lord knows
[3:07:20.160 --> 3:07:26.560]  they're welcome to judge me. But people like Dan Bongino, you know, that we had on so many times
[3:07:26.560 --> 3:07:31.440]  where he got his Fox News contract and he wouldn't even give us the time of day once he got, oh,
[3:07:31.440 --> 3:07:37.760]  the Fox job, the cool kid job, you know, not that many viewers. And I like Dan. He's a good guy.
[3:07:37.760 --> 3:07:44.160]  But I see clips of him and I even had family this week when I was each Texas going, yeah,
[3:07:44.160 --> 3:07:49.120]  we like you. I took Carlson. We like Dan Bongino. A bunch of family came over to our family cabin
[3:07:49.120 --> 3:07:57.920]  there in the woods. And why doesn't Dan Bongino, one of my family members, why didn't Dan Bongino
[3:07:57.920 --> 3:08:03.520]  know it's a great reset? And then it's Klaus Schwab like you talk about, because Dan all the time
[3:08:03.520 --> 3:08:09.120]  is up there saying he doesn't know why they do this. They know damn well why they do all this.
[3:08:09.120 --> 3:08:13.520]  Gerald Salente knows why they're doing it. He'll tell you in a minute. It's a corporate globalist
[3:08:13.520 --> 3:08:21.040]  takeover. It's a big club and we ain't in it. We'll play that clip from a famous comedian at
[3:08:21.040 --> 3:08:28.960]  the bottom of the hour. So I'm going to hand the baton over to him. It's just this is an insane
[3:08:28.960 --> 3:08:33.920]  time to be gaslit and propagandizing a lot about like this. I know Gerald's going to talk about it.
[3:08:33.920 --> 3:08:40.080]  We got that big article where we have the British Ministry of Defense. We have the Australian,
[3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:46.000]  you know, we have the US military admitting at the top they've been ordered to engage
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  in brainwashing in the public. And then that becomes the number one term over the weekend
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:55.680]  and Google and all them and go and block it because they don't want mass psychosis,
[3:08:56.400 --> 3:09:03.120]  mass formation psychosis looked into. And it's because if all that comes out, it's game over
[3:09:03.120 --> 3:09:11.040]  for them. So I don't feel sorry for myself, but I'm a prideful person. And I shouldn't do accounting
[3:09:11.040 --> 3:09:14.960]  or business meetings before the show. It's what I did last Friday. It's what I did today for two
[3:09:14.960 --> 3:09:23.280]  hours each day. And I'm in there looking at supply chain breakdowns. I'm in there looking at all
[3:09:23.280 --> 3:09:26.560]  this stuff we got to pay. And I'm sitting there looking at my employees and great crew and every
[3:09:26.560 --> 3:09:32.080]  one of them I think about I want to I want to keep on. And I just think about the globalists
[3:09:32.080 --> 3:09:36.640]  with their unlimited trillions of stolen money. And I don't feel sorry for myself. I get pissed off.
[3:09:37.360 --> 3:09:41.200]  So instead of getting ready for my show for two hours, I march over here and get ready for about
[3:09:41.200 --> 3:09:45.440]  45 minutes. And I'm looking at all this news and all these things are doing to us.
[3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:52.320]  And I'm like, does it the public have self preservation in their bones? I mean,
[3:09:52.320 --> 3:09:57.120]  don't you know, it's like Jimmy Dorsey said last week, he said, racial matter on record,
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:10:04.720]  they disclose this. It's $30,000 a day herself. The network gets for her show 100,000 a day,
[3:10:04.720 --> 3:10:14.320]  700,000 a week. And $30,000 of that goes in her pocket five nights a week to say the vaccine works.
[3:10:14.320 --> 3:10:19.440]  Nobody ever got sick from it. Sends her anybody that says so. That doesn't agree.
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:26.080]  I mean, imagine if I was here every day, thank you, Pfizer, $30,000. You'd be like,
[3:10:26.080 --> 3:10:30.800]  I don't believe a damn thing this guy says. That's what they're doing. And you don't think
[3:10:30.800 --> 3:10:34.240]  Gerald Salente had been offered the money. I know Gerald. Well, he never told me this,
[3:10:34.240 --> 3:10:38.560]  but I guarantee you that guy goes way back. You know, when he comes on, he'll tell you,
[3:10:38.560 --> 3:10:42.320]  I know he's been offered money because I've been offered money putting at times. And listen,
[3:10:42.320 --> 3:10:45.920]  if you offer me money to sell something good, I'll take it in five seconds.
[3:10:48.800 --> 3:10:53.120]  I'll take your money all damn day. I'm not against money. I like being comfortable.
[3:10:53.120 --> 3:10:56.800]  The point is, is I'm not going to take money that screws anybody over,
[3:10:56.800 --> 3:11:01.280]  and I'm not going to take money that's part of a scam and cheats people. Not going to happen.
[3:11:01.280 --> 3:11:07.680]  In fact, I'll fight you to keep you from doing to the people. And that's not the attitude of some
[3:11:07.680 --> 3:11:13.040]  perfect person. I don't want to live in a world where scammers are having their way with innocent
[3:11:13.040 --> 3:11:20.240]  people all day. As if that isn't going to come back on me. I want people to deal with each other
[3:11:20.240 --> 3:11:25.200]  upfront with the facts and to have their own research. And if we had an open free internet,
[3:11:25.200 --> 3:11:28.960]  you know, all these big globalist companies would be getting away with this. So instead,
[3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:34.640]  we have this big degenerate lockdown corrupt system that we're dealing with right now
[3:11:34.640 --> 3:11:41.520]  that just gets away with whatever it wants. And that's a recipe for disaster. That's a recipe
[3:11:41.520 --> 3:11:46.960]  for collapse. So Gerald Salente, the great trends forecaster, is about to take over
[3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:52.960]  on the other side, trendsresearch.com. And on Twitter, Gerald Salente here in just a few minutes,
[3:11:52.960 --> 3:11:58.800]  but I'm just going to throw this out there. We have great products you already need.
[3:11:59.920 --> 3:12:04.960]  And the sickening part is we were out of the red into the black a year and a half ago. In fact,
[3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:10.160]  we were into the black nicely. I was able to pay off some debts and things we had hanging over us
[3:12:10.160 --> 3:12:15.200]  because we did that. And then the supply chains broke down. And I've got so many products that
[3:12:15.200 --> 3:12:22.560]  we're able to keep them in stock like X to like DNA Force Plus. There's a bunch of them. I'm able
[3:12:22.560 --> 3:12:28.080]  to pay the bills. You guys came through. You've done great. Thank you. We will be able to expand
[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:33.680]  a year and a half ago that continued. But we're not able to because I won't sell you Chinese
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:39.600]  adulterated crap. We sell decent supplements and vitamins that are high quality. And let me give
[3:12:39.600 --> 3:12:47.920]  you a newsflash. You've seen stuff sold out for up to a year because we can't get decent product
[3:12:47.920 --> 3:12:53.600]  and we won't scrimp on it and give you garbage. And it's the same thing everywhere. It's a design
[3:12:53.600 --> 3:12:59.920]  collapse of our complex economy. If we were a 90% farmer economy, we would be fine because we're on
[3:12:59.920 --> 3:13:04.640]  the land. But they took us off the land, told us we were a service economy, and now we're using that
[3:13:04.640 --> 3:13:12.160]  to dominate and enslave and destroy us. So whatever the product is we got in stock, a shortwave radio,
[3:13:12.160 --> 3:13:17.280]  a water filter, storeable food, an air filter, a turmeric formula, bodies, ultimate turmeric
[3:13:17.280 --> 3:13:25.680]  formula, X2, Deeper crystal iodine. It's back in stock. Thank God. 50% off. Ultimate turmeric,
[3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:31.360]  liquid formula, 50% off. It's all there. Whatever we've got there, it's great products. But I can
[3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:37.120]  just tell you, watch in this country, get butchered up one side and down the other is frustrating
[3:13:37.120 --> 3:13:42.240]  and then sitting up here every day spending hours trying to figure out how to keep this
[3:13:42.240 --> 3:13:46.800]  place open and keep our crew and everything in position because we're having bigger effects
[3:13:46.800 --> 3:13:53.440]  and more success than we've ever had on air. Despite all the censorship, we have millions
[3:13:53.440 --> 3:13:59.040]  of new people a week tuning into infowars.com and the sites. That's wonderful. That's success.
[3:13:59.040 --> 3:14:05.360]  And then there's my frustration of spending our time scrounging around trying to get product
[3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:09.920]  that's quality because you're going to buy it. So you're not the problem. It's that we can't get
[3:14:09.920 --> 3:14:15.040]  all the things you regularly want. Bone broth sold out for over a year. Finally got it back in.
[3:14:15.040 --> 3:14:19.360]  It's available discount infowars.com. So I want to thank you all. Gerald Salente is going to take
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:24.240]  over trendsresearch.com. Gerald Salente is an American trend forecaster, publisher of the
[3:14:24.240 --> 3:14:28.560]  Trends Journal, business consultant and author who makes predictions about the global financial

[3:14:49.440 --> 3:14:57.360]  his take on what's going to happen in 2022 because we're here. We're now three days into 2022 and
[3:14:57.360 --> 3:15:03.040]  all I can tell you is and I'm not being a wimp here. I'm just being honest. Last year was the
[3:15:03.040 --> 3:15:09.200]  worst year of my life. It was hell. It was horrible. Everybody else I know absolutely got drugged the
[3:15:09.200 --> 3:15:14.240]  mud and I got to be honest with you. I think 2022 is going to be even worse. Now are there some
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:20.000]  silver linings? I'm sure Gerald Salente is a smart guy, smarter than a lot of us, me in many ways,
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  will give us his take and I'll be listening in my office as soon as he takes over on the other
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:29.280]  side of this quick break. So Gerald Salente again, mark it down, trendsresearch.com is straight

[3:18:57.520 --> 3:19:02.400]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this
[3:19:02.400 --> 3:19:07.440]  quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line. Uh, Alex, I have to promote one
[3:19:07.440 --> 3:19:13.200]  thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMail Vial Paility and Brain Force Plus.
[3:19:13.200 --> 3:19:18.160]  Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank. SuperMail Viality really, really works. It's
[3:19:18.160 --> 3:19:25.120]  cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic
[3:19:25.120 --> 3:19:29.840]  effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is
[3:19:29.840 --> 3:19:34.480]  like a very fine wine. It's, it's, it's, in fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super
[3:19:34.480 --> 3:19:37.840]  strong. Sometimes it's just okay. People are like, why are you selling something and admitting
[3:19:37.840 --> 3:19:43.040]  sometimes the batch isn't strong? That's just how it is. It's how it works. Uh, so it's always
[3:19:43.040 --> 3:19:47.680]  good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a
[3:19:47.680 --> 3:19:49.440]  decent price, then this is it.
[3:19:49.440 --> 3:20:05.360]  Yeah, leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[3:20:19.760 --> 3:20:29.920]  To 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:20:34.560 --> 3:20:40.800]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show and happy 2022. Nope, not allowed to be happy. I forgot.
[3:20:41.760 --> 3:20:44.800]  Happiness isn't allowed. It was a declaration of independence
[3:20:44.800 --> 3:20:51.520]  that said actually use the word happiness. Could you imagine? We are endowed by our creator
[3:20:51.520 --> 3:21:00.160]  with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. You won't be happy.
[3:21:01.200 --> 3:21:08.080]  Let's go back. Let's go back. Let's go back to March of 2020. You had these little dictators
[3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:14.880]  over there. Little arrogant, little arrogant Gavin gruesome Newsome in California. Lockdown.
[3:21:14.880 --> 3:21:21.600]  Lockdown. Oh, the arrogant little daddy's boy who renamed the Tappancy Bridge. If there's daddy,
[3:21:21.600 --> 3:21:32.160]  Mario Cuomo, arrogant Andy Cuomo. Locking down, locking down. Yep. Look at the little freaks
[3:21:32.160 --> 3:21:38.720]  that we have running and ruining our lives. Does Alex Jones get angry? Does he go off? So do I.
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:50.160]  So do I am. I am angry. Oh, don't be angry. Swallow the crap like the rest of us little more on
[3:21:50.160 --> 3:22:03.040]  Salete. Don't fight. Don't be a man. Woke up. Be dead. Yeah. Woke you. That's all it is. Every
[3:22:03.040 --> 3:22:09.520]  right to be angry. Oh, there was this. What was his name? Saint Thomas Aquinas. Yeah.
[3:22:10.480 --> 3:22:16.080]  That if anyone isn't angry at the proper time, basically, you have no passion and no desire.
[3:22:16.080 --> 3:22:26.080]  Yeah. Look how dumb people are. You're not going to get the masses. 88% of the people supported
[3:22:26.080 --> 3:22:32.640]  George W. Bush, another little daddy's boy born on third base and 30 at a home run,
[3:22:32.640 --> 3:22:39.920]  an Alfred E. Newman comic book mad character, little piece of arrogant crap. We're going to get
[3:22:39.920 --> 3:22:50.400]  that guy. Oh, yeah. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yeah. Oh, you see that article just came out in the
[3:22:50.400 --> 3:22:59.120]  Wall Street Journal areas about how all our dough went to the military contractors in Afghanistan.
[3:23:00.000 --> 3:23:06.320]  You're like three times the amount of military contractors over there than than troops.
[3:23:06.320 --> 3:23:13.600]  That's right. I would go. Oh, who's that guy? Oh, mission accomplished. Remember that one?
[3:23:13.600 --> 3:23:19.120]  Great job. Mission accomplished. Oh, yeah. The Iraq war that only stole a couple of trillion
[3:23:19.120 --> 3:23:26.640]  dollars of our money, gave it to the military industrial complex only killed about a little
[3:23:26.640 --> 3:23:34.000]  over a million Iraqis, destroyed the country based on lies, owned a toilet paper record
[3:23:34.000 --> 3:23:39.920]  the New York Slime Times. Yeah. Oh, that Osama bin Laden got them aluminum tubes. Yeah, shoved
[3:23:39.920 --> 3:23:47.280]  that aluminum toe up here. You know what? You made that line crap up. And people believe it.
[3:23:48.160 --> 3:23:55.200]  You have to support info wars. You have to support the crew. These people do everything
[3:23:55.200 --> 3:24:02.160]  they can to fight for freedom. You know, I'm on from info wars to progressive radio network
[3:24:02.160 --> 3:24:08.240]  with Gary. No, you want to see two opposites. But guess what? The passion is the same.
[3:24:09.760 --> 3:24:12.160]  Freedom, peace and justice.
[3:24:14.880 --> 3:24:20.880]  And that's what we have to fight for. So in this new year, do you care to support info wars?
[3:24:20.880 --> 3:24:26.960]  They got great products. I believe in them. I buy them. And my favorite, my favorites,
[3:24:26.960 --> 3:24:33.680]  Superville Vitality. And I had that vitality. Yeah.
[3:24:35.280 --> 3:24:41.200]  I can tell you a story. Another time about how outside some big bully comes after me because
[3:24:41.200 --> 3:24:49.920]  I was on info wars. So it's calling me a racist and a white privilege boy. And I try to make it
[3:24:49.920 --> 3:24:55.360]  nice and calm down. I was with a lady outside sitting down from the building chicken espresso
[3:24:55.360 --> 3:25:02.000]  having a nice Sunday morning. And I had to get my Superville Vitality into action.
[3:25:02.720 --> 3:25:08.640]  He didn't expect an old guy to get up and get in his face. And I had enough of your effing crap,
[3:25:08.640 --> 3:25:14.240]  man. Yeah, I got called out for being on info war. You know, many people tell me,
[3:25:14.240 --> 3:25:20.240]  I get lost. I said, I go on Alex Jones. I say what I want to say. Am I in the same page as him?
[3:25:20.240 --> 3:25:29.200]  No. A lot of things. Yes. That's not what this is about. If I'm infactual about something, let me know.
[3:25:32.880 --> 3:25:35.680]  I wouldn't be a trend forecast if I had a closed mind.
[3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:42.320]  I have to look at everything. I'm a political atheist. I look at things to the way they are,
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:50.800]  not the way I want them to be. And the way they are now is we're going into a hell of a 2022.
[3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:56.960]  And Alex Jones mentioned, you know, about the door is somebody about the money that a
[3:25:57.600 --> 3:26:03.840]  Rachel Maddow. Here's my Rachel Maddow story. I used to be on Tucker Carlson years ago when
[3:26:03.840 --> 3:26:09.920]  he was with MSNBC. And it was like about nine o'clock at night or something. They picked me
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:13.760]  up. I was living in Reinebeck and they had to go down to Seacawks in New Jersey. Seacawks,
[3:26:13.760 --> 3:26:20.640]  by the way, used to be famous, was big slaughterhouses, abattoirs. Yeah. So MSNBC was in the perfect
[3:26:20.640 --> 3:26:30.000]  place. So I'm waiting to go on. They had a little green room. And I'm hearing this woman going on
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:36.880]  and on. And after she leaves, I go, he goes, oh, Gerald, how are you? Nice to see you. You know,
[3:26:36.880 --> 3:26:42.000]  Tucker Carlson. I said to Tucker Carlson, I said, this is my like 2000, I'll make
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:49.200]  guess like 2006, 2007 around that time. I said, who is that woman? I should choose intolerable.
[3:26:49.200 --> 3:26:54.560]  She just kept going on and on. He said, oh, her name is Rachel Maddow and they're grooming her.
[3:26:55.360 --> 3:27:04.800]  That's my Rachel Maddow story. Maddow one. How about little Donnie Lemon, huh?
[3:27:04.800 --> 3:27:09.120]  Saying people don't like him because he's black. I don't like to give a crap about your color.
[3:27:09.120 --> 3:27:11.680]  I don't like you because you're an arrogant little moron.
[3:27:13.680 --> 3:27:23.520]  Deprestitudes, the immediate whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps. Got it?
[3:27:25.680 --> 3:27:32.240]  I used to be on everybody. And look at this little jerk off over there in CNN. You heard
[3:27:32.240 --> 3:27:42.640]  him over the weekend. Yeah. Look at him. This is just telling you what's going on in the world.
[3:27:43.520 --> 3:27:49.600]  They're telling you crap, their prostitutes, their media whores to get paid to put out
[3:27:49.600 --> 3:27:56.480]  by their corporate pimps and their government whore masters. Go back. Look at fairness and accuracy
[3:27:56.480 --> 3:28:05.440]  in reporting. Look what they did during the wars, the Iraq war.
[3:28:08.560 --> 3:28:13.040]  They only brought people on that supported it. The facts are there. Oh, is that guy filled
[3:28:13.040 --> 3:28:21.440]  down on you? Yeah, got thrown off the air. That's right. Deprestitudes. And that's why
[3:28:21.440 --> 3:28:26.480]  you need to support in forwards. And of course, the Trends Journal, if you want to read history
[3:28:26.480 --> 3:28:31.600]  before it happens. So the new year has begun. And we're going to talk when we come back about
[3:28:31.600 --> 3:28:36.320]  some of the trends that are going to shape it and what you can do to prepare, prevail and
[3:28:36.320 --> 3:28:43.840]  prosper. You look at the media and all they're doing is talking about making sense of 2021.
[3:28:44.640 --> 3:28:50.080]  All right, 2021 is gone. What do I care? Well, we can't talk about 2022 because we don't know how
[3:28:50.080 --> 3:29:00.080]  to do trends. We're prostitutes. Christmas 2021 is gone. It's in the rearview mirror,
[3:29:00.080 --> 3:29:06.160]  but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to the new year at infowarstore.com.

[3:31:56.080 --> 3:32:00.160]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up
[3:32:00.160 --> 3:32:06.400]  for what the globalists are doing right now. This is their big offensive. This is their takeover.
[3:32:06.400 --> 3:32:10.480]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[3:32:10.480 --> 3:32:13.600]  Now they're a world government. They're permanent martial law. Their medical
[3:32:13.600 --> 3:32:19.360]  tyranny is out in the open. Their depopulation agenda has been exposed. But they're using their
[3:32:19.360 --> 3:32:24.240]  corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[3:32:24.240 --> 3:32:27.920]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for the
[3:32:27.920 --> 3:32:32.720]  broadcast, you're the tip of the spear. And when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you keep us

[3:32:52.960 --> 3:33:03.680]  don't take action. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:10.160 --> 3:33:14.000]  It's never going to get any better. Don't look for it. Be happy with what you got.
[3:33:15.120 --> 3:33:20.720]  Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now.
[3:33:20.720 --> 3:33:25.520]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the
[3:33:25.520 --> 3:33:30.240]  important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea
[3:33:30.240 --> 3:33:37.840]  that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you.
[3:33:39.120 --> 3:33:44.640]  They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They've
[3:33:44.640 --> 3:33:48.080]  long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, and city halls. They
[3:33:48.080 --> 3:33:52.400]  got the judges in their back pockets, and they own all the big media companies, so they control
[3:33:52.400 --> 3:33:56.560]  just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:04.560]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines
[3:34:04.560 --> 3:34:09.280]  and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with a lower pay,
[3:34:09.280 --> 3:34:13.600]  the longer hours to reduce benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that
[3:34:13.600 --> 3:34:18.800]  disappears the minute you go to collect it. And now they're coming for your social security money
[3:34:18.800 --> 3:34:25.840]  so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street. It's a big club, and you ain't in it.
[3:34:25.840 --> 3:34:31.520]  And you said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[3:34:31.520 --> 3:34:36.400]  You better believe it. So what specifically did they do? If I ask them, if I need them,
[3:34:36.400 --> 3:34:40.880]  you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand, a lot of money.
[3:34:40.880 --> 3:34:46.480]  You and I are not in the big club. The owners of this country know the truth.
[3:34:47.040 --> 3:34:50.880]  It's called the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[3:34:52.160 --> 3:34:56.800]  But I'll tell you what, they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens capable
[3:34:56.800 --> 3:35:01.200]  of critical thinking. They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical
[3:35:01.200 --> 3:35:05.920]  thinking. They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their interest.
[3:35:05.920 --> 3:35:11.680]  Okay, from the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[3:35:25.680 --> 3:35:32.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:35:32.960 --> 3:35:41.520]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show with George Fallon. What a guy, man. I saw him live,
[3:35:41.520 --> 3:35:46.480]  by the way, up here in Kingston at the Ulster County Performing Arts Center back, I think it was
[3:35:46.480 --> 3:35:52.400]  in the late 80s, early 90s. I can't go there anymore, though. You got to have your vaccine
[3:35:52.400 --> 3:35:58.160]  passport. Yeah. And I know his brother, Patrick Collin. Patrick used to do work for me. George
[3:35:58.160 --> 3:36:04.560]  Collin's older brother. So George Collin's my kind of guy. Got that Bronx attitude, you know?
[3:36:05.360 --> 3:36:12.640]  And the New York City cat. And you say it the way it is. And it's what Alex Jones was saying
[3:36:12.640 --> 3:36:18.960]  before about the media, the mainstream media, what George Collin was saying. And I call him
[3:36:18.960 --> 3:36:24.800]  Prestitudes. And you could look it up, put that in. I'm the guy that came up with that word,
[3:36:24.800 --> 3:36:31.520]  media whores. The American people don't believe anything until they see it on television.
[3:36:32.560 --> 3:36:41.440]  That's right. They'll believe a stupid little lemon head. A mad mad owl. The view. Screw you,
[3:36:41.440 --> 3:36:48.560]  the view. What view? You view a crap. The crap that you're throwing out is your view. You don't
[3:36:48.560 --> 3:36:57.920]  have a view. Again. Think about it. Yeah. Headlines, New York Times, Afghanistan, COVID variants,
[3:36:57.920 --> 3:37:06.000]  gas, space tourism, the news that define 2021. What the hell do I care what happened in 2021?
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:10.880]  What's going to happen in 2022? Oh, shut up, Salenti. We don't want to know what's going on
[3:37:10.880 --> 3:37:18.880]  in 2022. We're too damn stupid. We just follow orders. We can't see anything that's ahead. But
[3:37:18.880 --> 3:37:26.080]  pay $3 for my newspaper or a date in New York Times or $5 for the Wall Street Journal. And you
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:32.800]  get what we tell you about what happened, not what's going forward. History before it happens is
[3:37:32.800 --> 3:37:42.320]  way off their base. And that's who they are. And Collins says it perfectly. Again. We've been
[3:37:42.320 --> 3:37:46.400]  one of the sections we have in the trends journal for the last several months,
[3:37:46.400 --> 3:37:57.920]  the big's getting bigger. Last year, 2021, almost $6 trillion in deal make.
[3:37:57.920 --> 3:38:06.480]  $6 trillion. Buying up the other companies. The big's getting bigger. They're they're essential.
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:14.480]  Why? Walmart's is essential. Essential. It's an ugly piece of garbage going into a factory.
[3:38:14.480 --> 3:38:20.000]  Oh, but they're essential. Costco is essential. Home depot is essential.
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:29.280]  Home depot is essential. You mom and pop, you're not essential. Shut your place down.
[3:38:29.280 --> 3:38:36.880]  I'm little Gavin Newsom. I'm little Andy Cuomo. I'll tell you what to do.
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:44.720]  Like Trump said, he pays off all these people. Morons and imbeciles call it campaign contributions.
[3:38:44.720 --> 3:38:50.000]  Grow the hell up. It's bribes and payoffs.
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:58.000]  Where do you think they got this $6 trillion from? The big's borrow the money for nothing.
[3:38:58.640 --> 3:39:03.920]  Once upon a time, boys and girls doing things called when you put your money in a bank,
[3:39:05.680 --> 3:39:11.440]  you got interest for it. Now you put it in a bank and they do nothing with it other than
[3:39:11.440 --> 3:39:18.080]  loan it back and make money on it. And the big's borrowed for nothing. It's one big club and you
[3:39:18.080 --> 3:39:26.240]  ain't in it. And that big club is getting bigger. Again, record breaking, six trillion dollars
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:32.560]  worth of deals, the big's buying up everything. Oh, this will make you happy. Apple becomes first
[3:39:32.560 --> 3:39:41.040]  U.S. company to reach a three trillion dollar market cap and get all their crap made overseas
[3:39:41.040 --> 3:39:48.960]  by cheap slave labor. Look at that little creepy cook. They give back crap to society,
[3:39:48.960 --> 3:39:57.200]  the buffets, the bezos, the musks. They give crap back. The pennies that they give back.
[3:39:57.200 --> 3:40:06.160]  Look at that little jerk off over there. Look at them cook, cook. Yeah, cook that crap because
[3:40:06.160 --> 3:40:11.920]  that's all that comes out of your mouth. You people give nothing back to society. Oh, there was a
[3:40:11.920 --> 3:40:18.640]  guy named Carnegie. Oh, people hated him. Yeah, he was one of the big guys back in the day. Oh,
[3:40:18.640 --> 3:40:27.200]  what did he create? The public library system? You mean those beautiful buildings built all
[3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:33.360]  around the country? Look at these little jerks off over there to tell us what to do. Big tech,
[3:40:33.360 --> 3:40:40.480]  little pecker heads, and maybe peckers throughout there where they have taken it from.
[3:40:43.760 --> 3:40:50.560]  U.S. billionaires grew the wealth by three hundred and forty billion dollars in 2021
[3:40:50.560 --> 3:40:59.360]  as middle class shrinks. This was the year of the super billionaire with one trillion dollars in
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:09.280]  gains. Oh, that's some Bloomberg. Another billionaire bullshit crap head. Oh, I can't
[3:41:09.280 --> 3:41:16.720]  say that word. Excuse me. Spent a billion dollars to go run for president in the United States.
[3:41:17.520 --> 3:41:25.920]  A billion bucks. What do they give back? They give back pennies. They give back nothing.
[3:41:25.920 --> 3:41:30.160]  They steal it from us.
[3:41:32.640 --> 3:41:39.600]  Look what Trump did with the tax breaks for the rich. The one percent got 82 percent of it.
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:45.760]  And you know what they did with it? Stock buybacks. Oh, stock buybacks hit a record this year.
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:51.680]  Hit a record this year. Yeah, they buy back their stocks supply and demand less stocks out.
[3:41:51.680 --> 3:41:56.480]  Their price keeps going up. Got it. The bigs keep getting bigger.
[3:41:58.480 --> 3:42:03.040]  And look at the crap. Yeah, look at them. She got those fake boobs over there.
[3:42:03.040 --> 3:42:07.360]  How much silicon you got pumped into that? Did that come from Silicon Valley?
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:19.040]  Look at that arrogance. Look at a give back. Nothing. Nothing. Pennies. Pennies to the public.
[3:42:21.760 --> 3:42:28.480]  And it's global. Look at the jerky got up there in Canada. Trudeau.
[3:42:29.200 --> 3:42:33.920]  He calls the unvaccinated racist and misogynist extremists.
[3:42:33.920 --> 3:42:38.960]  Another little daddy's boy. Another little boy that would be nobody nowhere.
[3:42:38.960 --> 3:42:44.080]  If daddy wasn't here before him, like little Andy Cromwell, like little Georgie Bush,
[3:42:45.200 --> 3:42:55.120]  like one little crap head after another. It's one big club and you ain't in it. And we'll be back.
[3:42:55.120 --> 3:43:02.000]  Christmas 2021 is over, but she's still got a really great chance to give yourself the gift
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:08.240]  of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time, making yourself

[3:43:38.880 --> 3:43:44.880]  gets back in stock 50% off. So that's the new year special. And that's Christmas comes early
[3:43:44.880 --> 3:43:49.680]  in 2022, ladies and gentlemen, give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with
[3:43:49.680 --> 3:43:56.800]  X2 and Winter Sun at infowarstore.com. 50% off for a limited time. Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[3:43:56.800 --> 3:44:01.840]  We've all heard about the pastor in his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[3:44:01.840 --> 3:44:06.400]  in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group so he didn't
[3:44:06.400 --> 3:44:09.840]  stand up. And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group so he didn't
[3:44:09.840 --> 3:44:14.800]  stand up. And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[3:44:14.800 --> 3:44:18.720]  Oh, the global social credit score that China is putting in that's banning people the three hours
[3:44:18.720 --> 3:44:22.800]  of video games a week and if you criticize the government, you can never buy or sell again.
[3:44:22.800 --> 3:44:27.120]  Well, that's, that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID
[3:44:27.760 --> 3:44:32.480]  vaccine passports. They even admit it. Now there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it. They're
[3:44:32.480 --> 3:44:36.720]  going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do.
[3:44:36.720 --> 3:44:41.840]  That's what the lockdowns are about. You'll accept that. You'll accept anything. So again,
[3:44:41.840 --> 3:44:45.760]  the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're
[3:44:45.760 --> 3:44:49.600]  part of the power structure, but they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well.
[3:44:49.600 --> 3:44:53.680]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by
[3:44:53.680 --> 3:44:59.440]  this horrible technocracy run by the globalists. Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades
[3:44:59.440 --> 3:45:05.600]  has only been the buildup for what the globalists are doing right now. This is their big offensive.
[3:45:05.600 --> 3:45:09.760]  This is their takeover. And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now
[3:45:09.760 --> 3:45:13.600]  they've revealed themselves. Now their world government, their permanent martial law,
[3:45:13.600 --> 3:45:18.560]  their medical tyranny is out in the open. Their depopulation agenda has been exposed,
[3:45:18.560 --> 3:45:22.720]  but they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet
[3:45:22.720 --> 3:45:27.280]  and shut down people telling the truth. So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about
[3:45:27.280 --> 3:45:30.880]  the broadcast, when you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear. And when you buy
[3:45:30.880 --> 3:45:35.680]  products at infowarstore.com, you keep us on air. Plus we've got great products that have been sold
[3:45:35.680 --> 3:45:42.320]  out for months that are back in stock, 50% off, X2 and Winter Sun. Both of these are on our top
[3:45:42.320 --> 3:45:46.720]  five best sellers. They are so good for your body. And if there's two things you do for your body,
[3:45:46.720 --> 3:45:50.400]  it's these two products. They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com,
[3:45:50.400 --> 3:45:54.480]  50% off and it keeps us on the air. Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[3:45:56.480 --> 3:46:02.480]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop
[3:46:02.480 --> 3:46:07.920]  their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went
[3:46:07.920 --> 3:46:13.520]  operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[3:46:13.520 --> 3:46:19.520]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[3:46:19.520 --> 3:46:24.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:28.400]  they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:46:28.400 --> 3:46:32.400]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda. We've also got to
[3:46:32.400 --> 3:46:36.480]  get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[3:46:36.480 --> 3:46:41.840]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com. So whether
[3:46:41.840 --> 3:46:46.880]  it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.

[3:48:53.520 --> 3:49:00.160]  Better time we have left. I want to talk about the equity markets. If you go to the Gerald
[3:49:00.160 --> 3:49:06.880]  Salenti on YouTube, Gerald Salenti is a great interview I did last Friday with Gregory Manarino
[3:49:07.520 --> 3:49:11.440]  and especially essentially this, they're going to keep pumping in cheap money into the system.
[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:14.880]  They're going to do everything they can to artificially keep propping it up.
[3:49:16.160 --> 3:49:24.560]  I have a for one of my forecasts is that this COVID war is going to end by late March, mid April.
[3:49:24.560 --> 3:49:30.000]  I'm going to say later in April, as I think more about it, because they are destroying the lives
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:37.680]  and livelihoods of billions of people. The World Bank shows about another 150 million people
[3:49:37.680 --> 3:49:44.160]  entered into poverty. So equities are going to keep going up. There he is. Gregory Manarino,
[3:49:44.160 --> 3:49:52.960]  he knows his stuff and he's into it. So he could go to Gerald Salenti and check that one out.
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:50:00.480]  And on the broader scale, as I just showed you, the billionaires are getting richer.
[3:50:01.840 --> 3:50:08.320]  And this is global, by the way. And you're going to see it off with their heads to 0.0 movement
[3:50:08.320 --> 3:50:14.800]  at some point because all we become are plantation workers on the global plantation of slave landia.
[3:50:14.800 --> 3:50:21.680]  Again, in trend forecasting, you make connections between different fields. I noted how, for example,
[3:50:21.680 --> 3:50:27.360]  merger and acquisition activities at an all-time high. When I was a young man that had grocery
[3:50:27.360 --> 3:50:34.960]  stores, grocery stores, drug stores, stationary stores, hardware stores, grocery stores,
[3:50:34.960 --> 3:50:41.920]  you know, they were stores. Now they're drug chains, grocery chains, hardware chains,
[3:50:42.480 --> 3:50:47.520]  stationary chains. When they had the stores, you went to work in these places and you say,
[3:50:47.520 --> 3:50:50.800]  you know, I'm going to open up one of these when I grow up. I'm going to do this one.
[3:50:50.800 --> 3:50:57.840]  And you moved up the ladder. There's no ladder to move up in Starbucks. There's no ladder to climb
[3:50:57.840 --> 3:51:06.000]  in Walmots. There's no ladder in Home Depot. You might sell them, but you're not going to climb them.
[3:51:06.960 --> 3:51:15.840]  This is better than slavery because when they had slavery in the plantations,
[3:51:15.840 --> 3:51:22.000]  you had to house and feed the plantation workers. Now you just give them enough
[3:51:22.880 --> 3:51:27.040]  to get in and out. Yeah, you're on your own here. Work here. Go home. Now get out of here.
[3:51:27.040 --> 3:51:31.520]  Go on. Here's a little bit of money. Go on. Go out and buy crap. Eat crap.
[3:51:34.160 --> 3:51:39.440]  It's a plantation system. There's no climbing the corporate ladder anymore.
[3:51:40.560 --> 3:51:45.600]  The bigs have taken over the world. The great reset isn't going to happen. It's happened.
[3:51:45.600 --> 3:51:54.000]  It's in front of everybody's eyes. So I'm still positive on GSB, Gold, Silver and Bitcoin.
[3:51:55.200 --> 3:52:02.560]  I see them going up. Or at least to me, they're safe haven assets compared to the trillions of
[3:52:02.560 --> 3:52:07.840]  dollars that have been dumped into the system to artificially prop it up with the interest rates.
[3:52:08.480 --> 3:52:15.040]  Interest rates are actually in negative territory because when you put a 6.8% inflation rate,
[3:52:15.040 --> 3:52:20.560]  and according to John Williams and Shadow Stats, it's 15%. But even if you go by the
[3:52:20.560 --> 3:52:26.800]  fake number by the feds at 6.8%, and you have zero interest rate policy, wait a minute,
[3:52:26.800 --> 3:52:32.960]  inflation is at 6.8. Our rate is near zero. That means you have negative interest rates.
[3:52:32.960 --> 3:52:37.760]  And that's why the bigs are buying up everything. You don't get interest on anything so they can
[3:52:37.760 --> 3:52:43.920]  keep getting cheap money gambling in the markets. They need a monetary methadone and they banked
[3:52:43.920 --> 3:52:50.800]  as other drug dealers, they give it to them for nothing. And there's one of them. And all the
[3:52:50.800 --> 3:52:56.320]  dirty dealings that they do behind the scenes like that crapplin' you got down there in Texas over
[3:52:56.320 --> 3:53:03.120]  there. Yeah. A former fed guy. Another little rose and gran up here in mascotoshits over here. Yeah.
[3:53:04.720 --> 3:53:10.640]  Oh, I'm resigning because I don't feel good now. You're resigning because you got caught doing dirty
[3:53:10.640 --> 3:53:16.720]  deals. Play in the markets just before the feds are going to come out and say what they're doing.
[3:53:16.720 --> 3:53:24.960]  It's one big club and you ain't in it. It's morons and imbeciles call it a government.
[3:53:24.960 --> 3:53:31.520]  It's a crime syndicate. Grow up. How many more wars do they have to start and kill people?
[3:53:32.560 --> 3:53:36.640]  How many more money do they have to steal from us to name it too big to fail? You're just a piece
[3:53:36.640 --> 3:53:42.160]  of crap. You're not Jamie Dimon. Jamie Dimon. What diamond?
[3:53:46.400 --> 3:53:46.960]  Diamond.
[3:53:50.720 --> 3:53:56.880]  Get caught for fraud. None of them go to jail. Pay a little fine slap on the wrist.
[3:53:57.600 --> 3:54:02.080]  Matter of fact, I got an article just here in Deutsche Bank. One of them, you know, for the
[3:54:02.080 --> 3:54:10.080]  trends journal. Where is it here? Deutsche Bank, fine over rate rigging safeguards.
[3:54:11.200 --> 3:54:17.760]  They get fine. Nobody goes to jail. Oh, that's fine. Rig the markets. It's one big club and you
[3:54:17.760 --> 3:54:26.960]  ain't in it. Again, vaccinating. This is from financial times. Omicron heats up debate over
[3:54:26.960 --> 3:54:31.360]  jabs of children, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You got to read the whole article, three pages,
[3:54:31.360 --> 3:54:37.200]  you get down to the bottom. This is out of German of France. There are 5.8 million French
[3:54:37.200 --> 3:54:42.560]  children age five to 11. All right, 6 million kids five to 11, right?
[3:54:46.480 --> 3:54:54.000]  How many debts since March 2020 when the COVID War began to mid December this year?
[3:54:54.000 --> 3:55:08.320]  How many? Six million. Three deaths. Three deaths out of six million. What the hell are you
[3:55:08.320 --> 3:55:13.280]  telling me this for? Oh, what else? Maybe they died or something else, but three. Oh, yeah,
[3:55:13.280 --> 3:55:19.280]  if we save the life of one, get out of here. Oh, so lengthy, calm down and swallow the crap.
[3:55:19.280 --> 3:55:28.960]  Again, Britain got it wrong on COVID. Long lockdown did more harm than good. This is out
[3:55:28.960 --> 3:55:35.600]  of the Guardian. What we've been saying forever. We did serious harm with our children, young
[3:55:35.600 --> 3:55:41.600]  adults, the rub of their education, jobs, normal existence, as well as suffering damage to the
[3:55:41.600 --> 3:55:48.080]  future prospects. While they were left to inherit a record breaking mountain of public debt,
[3:55:48.080 --> 3:55:55.520]  this is according to Professor Woolhouse. And he's writing a book the year the world went mad,
[3:55:55.520 --> 3:56:09.840]  a scientific memoir. We said this back in your trends journal, July 28, 2020 edition.
[3:56:10.640 --> 3:56:16.880]  Stay at home, get sick. Following the lockdowns with a number of Chinese cities when the coronavirus
[3:56:16.880 --> 3:56:23.040]  first struck in February on nine March, Italy was the first major Western nation to lockdown.
[3:56:23.040 --> 3:56:28.720]  Shortly after nations across the globe from rich to poor, blah, blah, blah. In America, Dr. Anthony
[3:56:28.720 --> 3:56:36.480]  Fraud Fauci, exalted by prostitutes as the nation's leading infectious disease expert, recommended
[3:56:36.480 --> 3:56:43.760]  federally enforced nationwide stay at home policy. He said, I just don't understand why they're not
[3:56:43.760 --> 3:56:49.280]  doing that. Well, they're not doing that because it doesn't work. And we go on to cite a study from
[3:56:49.280 --> 3:56:55.440]  South Korea, and it was reported by Reuters that the epidemiologists has found that people who are
[3:56:55.440 --> 3:57:01.280]  more likely to contract the new coronavirus to members of their own household than from contacts
[3:57:01.280 --> 3:57:10.080]  outside the home. The findings showed that less than 2% of patients, non household contacts,
[3:57:10.080 --> 3:57:18.800]  had caught the virus. And then we write the same arrogant or executive order by King Cuomo,
[3:57:19.440 --> 3:57:26.880]  who was astounded on 6 May when he said it was shocking that most new coronavirus hospitalizations
[3:57:26.880 --> 3:57:33.680]  were people who had been staying home. So there you got it. If you notice 60% of people were at
[3:57:33.680 --> 3:57:43.520]  home, they're lying about this stuff. Crew ships vaccinated COVID. You got to go. See you next week
[3:57:43.520 --> 3:57:48.800]  doing your cancer support info wars. I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put
[3:57:48.800 --> 3:57:52.880]  in info wars live products. And that's why for more than two years, we've been sold out of ultimate
[3:57:52.880 --> 3:57:58.800]  bone broth. And we could never get the ingredients again. Until now, and we have reformulated and
[3:57:58.800 --> 3:58:04.240]  not just use the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger. So out of all the
[3:58:04.240 --> 3:58:08.720]  bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level. Listen to what it's got in it. Cutting
[3:58:08.720 --> 3:58:14.000]  edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability. It's got
[3:58:14.000 --> 3:58:19.520]  turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and a bunch of other
[3:58:19.520 --> 3:58:23.920]  amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants. And then it's got a bunch of
[3:58:23.920 --> 3:58:28.320]  other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium added. I mean, this sucker has got
[3:58:28.320 --> 3:58:33.520]  everything for your electrolytes. It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate
[3:58:33.520 --> 3:58:38.640]  flavor and a touch of sea salt. And it just goes on and on. It is now back in stock ultimate bone
[3:58:38.640 --> 3:58:44.800]  broth plus available at 20% off and free shipping out of the gates at info wars store.com.
[3:58:46.400 --> 3:58:52.560]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class,
[3:58:52.560 --> 3:59:00.560]  not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere. Is there a real study
[3:59:01.200 --> 3:59:06.160]  of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by design. The large central banks that basically
[3:59:06.160 --> 3:59:12.480]  control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into say the Anglo American
[3:59:12.480 --> 3:59:17.040]  establishment, the sound of the Bilderberg group, the trilateral commission, the United Nations,
[3:59:17.040 --> 3:59:22.720]  the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers. Until 10 years ago, the media said
[3:59:22.720 --> 3:59:27.440]  the control corporate media, the Bilderberg group didn't exist. Well, now the Bilderberg group is
[3:59:27.440 --> 3:59:33.440]  public in its former head. So the steering committee is called Schwab, and he has set up the great
[3:59:33.440 --> 3:59:38.720]  reset in global government. And if as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist
[3:59:38.720 --> 3:59:43.520]  head on about the fact that they are worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have
[3:59:43.520 --> 3:59:51.680]  a shot. Can you expose them? We can beat them easily. If you are receiving this transmission,
[3:59:51.680 --> 4:00:15.760]  you are the resistance.
