[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  Well, you may have noticed, it's not so subtle anymore.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  The American left has taken off its mask and exposed itself for what it really is.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]  Whether it's the continued weaponization of government against their opposition,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  including their biggest opposition, Donald Trump.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]  But of course, you, me, everybody else that stands in their way.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  Everybody else that's willing to tell the truth.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000]  But it's also their violence with incidents like the Black Lives Matter summer of rage.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]  They have also expressed now their blatant anti-white bigotry.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]  When it comes to the situation with a black judge now,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]  they're hoping will put Donald Trump in jail the rest of his life.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]  And they just say it. They say, what poetic justice.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]  It's a black woman that will destroy the white man, Donald Trump.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]  Maybe it's the celebration of murder, abortion,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]  that was the moment you realized what the American left really is.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]  But now, folks, it's their own representative.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  It's Democrats in Congress. It's their media.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]  This is the evil.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  They are now deciding we are just choosing the role of being the bad guy consciously.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]  We will fully corrupt ourselves to evil because the ends justify the means.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]  Because they believe you really are a racist, bigot, homophobe.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]  And you really are a cancer and a parasite on this planet.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  And your existence is torturous to them.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]  So they have to destroy you.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]  And so now here is Democrat Representative Jasmine Crockett.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]  They're one step away, folks, from just routing us all up or chopping off our heads.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]  Listen to this Democrat in clip seven.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  What do you have to say to your colleagues across the aisle
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  who are clamoring to defend the indefensible charges against Defendant Trump?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  First of all, good morning.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000]  Your commentary about the speaker finding his spine is hilarious to me because, yeah, he is definitely spineless.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.000]  Listen, the idea that the biggest scandal that I remember when Obama was in office was his tan suit.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  Right. They were all up in arms about the tan suit.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000]  And now there's nothing to see with three separate indictments in multiple states on multiple levels.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]  It's absolutely ridiculous. And no one is being prosecuted for their thoughts.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  They're being prosecuted or he is being prosecuted for his actions,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]  along with his co-conspirators in the various indictments that he has.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000]  We have seen Jack lay out in multiple pages of indictments as what has been described on y'all's network as a shouting indictment.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000]  In this last indictment, he has clearly laid out the actions of not only Trump, but his co-conspirators.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  And honestly, anyone who was paying attention on January 6th, we saw what his actions led to.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]  And so, no, it's not his thoughts, it's his actions.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  It's absolutely ridiculous that we have these actions that are playing out by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  You know, they are really getting dangerously close, in my opinion, to criminal culpability in and of themselves as well.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  And so if I were them, I would stop taking so many actions and continue to express my thoughts.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000]  But they are the ones that are weaponizing government when they are taking our committees and they are running these sham seemingly trials on behalf of Trump.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:28.000]  We have said over and over and over that in a minute they are going to have to turn in FEC filings because of all of the contributions that they are giving to the Trump campaign.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]  So there you have it. You're now criminally culpable if you defend Trump's innocence.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]  No such thing as innocent until proven guilty now.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]  And speech is now action.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  But folks, forget about the Trump derangement syndrome and the just genuine low IQ individual that you just heard on the screen there.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  This is what they're really thinking. This is what they've been thinking. And they're ready to move.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]  They really want all of you arrested and or dead.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  If you stand up for Donald Trump, these Democrats want you dead or in jail.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:17.000]  I beg you to think about how important your word of mouth is and you sharing the articles and sharing the videos and telling people get the forbidden truth you're not supposed to find at Infowars.com forward slash show and getting products at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  What an opportunity we have as freedom-loving American patriots.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]  What an opportunity we have as God-fearing Christians.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  What an opportunity you have.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]  You're just a human that likes life.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  You just like life.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]  What an opportunity you have because we are facing total evil.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]  We are facing total tyranny, totalitarian criminal government.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]  And we have a chance to stand up against it, rise up against it with righteous indignation.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]  Fully justified, vindicated in our ideologies.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  And we have an opportunity to truly defeat and dispel even evil.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]  At least for a moment, in this country and in this planet.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  And so, when I hear Donald Trump talking like this at a campaign event in Alabama,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]  it just feels good.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  This is long overdue.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  Here's Donald Trump addressing the wickedness, the criminality we face in the halls of our government
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  in clip one in Alabama this weekend.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]  Election day 2024, we're going to evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000]  We're going to expel the criminals and thugs from the halls of power in Washington, D.C.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  And we are going to make America great again.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]  So here we are.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:15.000]  And anybody that still is sound of mind, even from the American left, liberals, democrats, progressives,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  you're seeing it now like Alan Dershowitz, Tulsi Gabbard, even Joe Rogan, others,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  they see what's going on here, whether they like Donald Trump, voted for Donald Trump, doesn't matter.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]  The people trying to destroy Donald Trump, the people lying about Donald Trump,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  the media obsessed with Donald Trump, the deep state persecution of Donald Trump,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]  that's the sign for what you really need to be focused on.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:43.000]  The criminal totalitarians that run Washington, D.C. and will not accept any opposition or any dissidence.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]  And if you really want to know politically what the democrats have planned, and they'll end up losing as well,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]  but the globalists, the World Economic Forum, the World Health Organization, behind the democrats,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000]  the Chinese Communist Party that runs the democrats, they will love it when the democrats reach their goal
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  of one-party control over this country.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]  They'll cancel elections, they'll make being a conservative, republican, whatever, they'll just make it illegal.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]  If you're in Congress as a republican, they'll boot you.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]  If you're on the Supreme Court as a republican, or you were appointed by a republican, they'll boot you.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]  This is politically what the democrats want, this is politically their vision.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]  And the Chinese communists love that because then if you have a one-party totalitarian system here,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]  then it's a lot easier for them to control that party, like Joe Biden.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]  And then for the World Health Organization, the World Economic Forum,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  they just have to lobby and convince their democrat penetrators, their democrat operatives,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]  that hey, this is what we're all doing now, get behind it, we're all in.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]  And so that's where all this is going.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000]  Alan Dershowitz, Trump indictment makes America look like a banana republic, everybody sees it.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]  Except still these American liberals, but it's not even fair to say that anymore,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]  because a lot of liberals have come around, a lot of liberals see what's going on here.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]  So it's really just deranged leftists.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]  It's really just fully deranged leftists, communists, socialists, Marxists,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  that have just completely lost their humanity, completely lost their minds.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  Everybody else sees through this.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]  But it's funny because you could ask anybody, somehow pull Trump out of the equation,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  pull Trump out of the consciousness, and you ask anybody,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  is Washington DC corrupt? Absolutely. Is politics corrupt? Absolutely.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]  And here's the top populist politician, Donald Trump, who's saying how corrupt it is,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  who's saying he wants to fight the corruption,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]  and the very people that would say how corrupt it is and want to fight it hate him for it.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]  Now that's just psychological mind control warfare,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]  the likes of which has never been seen probably ever before.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000]  Maybe Nazi Germany 1942, but you're living through a lot of that now with the American left.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]  And it's even worse when you look at the team that is handling Donald Trump's persecution.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000]  Surprise, DOJ prosecutor working on Jack Smith's team is a Biden donor.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]  All the judges, their husbands, their wives, Biden donors,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]  worked for the Biden campaign, worked for the Democrat campaign,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]  worked for Barack Obama, donated to Barack Obama, got jobs with Barack Obama.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]  And it's all the same people.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  And then they scrape the bottom of the barrel to find Jack Smith.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  That is the bottom of the barrel, folks.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  This is a loser prosecutor.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]  And, I mean, look, obviously the guy's just something's off, okay?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  Something's off about the guy.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]  I don't know if it's something that's been done to him in the past or something he's done in the past,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]  but there's something off about that man.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]  Maybe he was bullied his entire life, and now finally he's got power to destroy people,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  and that makes him feel big.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]  Something else is going on here, because something is off with that man.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]  You can see it every time he steps to the podium.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  But his whole team, and they will indict Donald Trump a fourth time.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  It'll probably happen maybe after, if Devin Archer does a public testimony
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]  or something else big breaks for the public to see that the mainstream media can't bury
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]  when it comes to the Biden crime family, they'll do the fourth indictment.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  It is inevitable.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]  They will arrest him.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]  They'll get the mugshot.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  They'll probably throw him in jail.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.000]  Now, there's a rumor that the people in charge of that down in Georgia are really licking their chops.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  I mean, like hyenas or vultures with a carcass sitting there is how they look at this.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:57.000]  So these are deranged lunatics that are really, really animalistic in their approach.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  And we're just about to experience it all.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]  And the average American that doesn't want anything to do with this is starting to learn about it too.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]  And they might not have to deal with the political persecution
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]  and the Democrats weaponizing the government against you to destroy your life,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  but your grocery bill is like, I went grocery shopping last night.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]  I pretty much get the same thing every time I go.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]  My once-a-week trip to the grocery store, pretty much get the exact same thing,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]  give or take a couple items, give or take maybe $50 on the grocery bill.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  Highest grocery bill I've ever had.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  Highest grocery bill I've ever had.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  And I'm just curious because, I mean, I can speak for myself.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  Are you guys in the crew experiencing the same thing?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]  Are your grocery bills bigger than ever before?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]  Everybody in the crew just echoed yes.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]  So everybody's seeing this.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000]  Your energy bill has probably doubled.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000]  Of course, you've seen now price of the pump is starting to once again approach record highs.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  Everybody's now talking about the housing market, which is a complete disaster.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  Mortgage rates up over 7%.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]  So whether you are even politically trying to fight these people or culturally
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  or just in the arena with these people, they're now coming to crush you.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]  And what has been the ultimate power of the American individual?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000]  It's been the fact that we are independent enough and we have a strong enough economy in the free market,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:36.000]  truly a free market republic, that we have capital, we have assets, we have breathing room
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]  to actually take a stand if we need to, to actually coalesce if we need to.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  That's all being ripped away.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]  Now the average American has less than $1,000 in savings.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  Americans that are making six figures a year, $100,000 and up, 40% of them live paycheck to paycheck.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]  And so that's what they have to do.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  They have to bleed you out.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  They have to bleed you out to such an extent that you can't afford to live anymore
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]  and then you have to go into their smart cities and you have to go into their super smart cities
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]  and go into their air conditioning controlled units if you want any food or any water
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  because you're just totally cut off.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  Your energy has to be rationed.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]  Your food has to be rationed.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  And that's what's really behind the leftist movement.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  Now the average Democrat, liberal voter, they don't have a clue.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]  They're morons.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]  I've got proof of that.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]  They go into the Amazon store or the Whole Foods store.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]  They've got a microchip and they're saying look at how cool this is.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  Yeah, look at how cool it is.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  You're about to get digital shackles.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]  You're about to get digital shackles on your body for the rest of your life.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]  And you're so naive, you think it's cool.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]  You probably think the vaccine is cool.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  You probably think the mask is cool.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]  You probably think electric cars are cool.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]  You have fully bought in.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  And in five years, if you win, you will be a slave.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  But it's cool now, they think.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]  and the big event coming up.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]  Well, yeah, the first one, you obviously can go to MyPillow.com,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]  use that promo code Alex, and you can get all these great discounts
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]  on all of our products.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  And just by visiting this site, you're going to get a $20 free gift
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]  emailed to you immediately.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]  And there's the biggest special we have right now,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000]  the 20-year anniversary MyPillow for 1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing best,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]  producing and making the MyPillow.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]  using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]  That's what the debanking is about.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  That's why we've got to rush to support MyPillow.com and InfoWars.com,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]  plus their great products at both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]  and they've got our children drinking that.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]  They went out and hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]  best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  for half the price of a leading competitor.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]  The point is you get the filters at m4store.com.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]  They're discounted right now.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  Finally back in stock.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]  which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000]  derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands-down the best.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]  Pure, nascent iodine.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]  Stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]  A lot of people have asked me,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000]  why has InfoWars Store and InfoWars Life not had a probiotic for more than three years?
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  The answer is simple.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]  We had a top-maker, top-certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]  They got bought by a libtard company and said,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]  we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]  Finally, we've got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]  We're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula.

[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]  and it funds our entire operation.

[00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:37.510]  What's craziest about the current political battles is you see the American left embracing
[00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:43.230]  their own demise, embracing their own destruction, biting the hand that feeds them hell, trying
[00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.630]  to chop it off.
[00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.710]  And they just can't see it.
[00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.590]  And the truth is, the reason they can't see it is because they're filled with so much
[00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.890]  hatred.
[00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:57.550]  Hatred for you, hatred for the country, a million different things they hate.
[00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.870]  And when you're that blind by hatred, you can't see the true enemies in front of you.
[00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.110]  You can't even see the next level.
[00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.310]  You can't even see the next move.
[00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:10.990]  And so that's why you see this being celebrated.
[00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:18.150]  Now with the microchips in your hand, it can open your car and open your apartment
[00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.910]  door and now you can pay for groceries in it.
[00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:25.750]  And look at the NPC here thinking this is the salvation, thinking this is the freedom
[00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:44.390]  when it's really the shackles here in clip eight.
[00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:45.390]  Coolest thing ever.
[00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.630]  Now, let's be clear about something here.
[00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.390]  I'm not a Luddite.
[00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.190]  I'm not against technological advancements.
[00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.630]  In fact, I really like them.
[00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.390]  I think it has made our life easier.
[00:21:55.390 --> 00:22:01.350]  It's made things more accessible, abundant, highest standard of living probably than most
[00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.870]  other humans that have ever walked this planet.
[00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.350]  And we're about to sell it all down the drain because of that exactly.
[00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.510]  So oh, you might think, well, yeah, okay, a microchip in the hand to access all my stuff
[00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.950]  or have all my information.
[00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:14.950]  Maybe that is convenient.
[00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:19.670]  Maybe that can be used to empower us and advance us.
[00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:24.470]  But to not understand what looks behind us, to not understand what looks behind this is
[00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.990]  just to be a fool.
[00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.390]  And we've already seen a taste of it.
[00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.390]  Oh, sure.
[00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.150]  That's a nice microchip you have in your arm.
[00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:35.590]  Makes it real easy to get access to your car and apartment.
[00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:39.550]  You don't have to worry about losing your keys or your wallet or your ID.
[00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:44.430]  It's all right there in your wrist.
[00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.430]  Sounds great.
[00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:52.270]  But what happens when all of a sudden you don't get access to it anymore?
[00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:56.070]  Did you consume too much meat?
[00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.710]  Did you consume too much energy?
[00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.550]  Did you share the wrong social media posts?
[00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.150]  Did you say the wrong thing?
[00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.150]  Who knows?
[00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.470]  At some point, they might be able to read your thoughts.
[00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.430]  Did you think the wrong thing?
[00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:12.110]  On all the sudden, that access is gone.
[00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.310]  And then what do you become?
[00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.110]  A slave.
[00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:26.190]  But see, that's why they deflect and they want you to think about racism or global warming
[00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:33.030]  or a virus so that you don't see the real tyranny, the real global enslavement that
[00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:43.310]  is standing right in front of you, a demonic entity drooling through its gnashing fangs,
[00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:48.550]  blood dripping out of its eyeballs, ready to consume you.
[00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:52.070]  And that's what this is.
[00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.390]  And that's why you see the vitriol to any that oppose it.
[00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:57.270]  That's why you see the political persecution.
[00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:01.630]  That's why you see the weaponized government, the censorship.
[00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:06.870]  Because this is a beast we face.
[00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:12.750]  And to not see it is to live in ignorance, to be a fool.
[00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.230]  And there are many among us, no doubt.
[00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.870]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, let me do something real quick here.
[00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.470]  Let me tell you what's coming up tonight.
[00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.910]  Kind of abandoned my host duties and just started waxing and getting into the content
[00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.190]  here, but not even telling you what's coming up.
[00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.630]  We've got a lot of great stuff all night long here at InfoWars.
[00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:36.590]  We got Alex Jones and the America Shaman getting real deep into beyond the political world.
[00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.550]  But what does the future have for us?
[00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:46.030]  And then Alex gets deep into the geopolitical situations, the wars, what's going on with
[00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:49.630]  Biden in the White House with Scott Bennett.
[00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:55.030]  And so these are two very powerful and exhilarating Alex Jones interviews that we're going to
[00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.550]  be having coming up for you the rest of the night.
[00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.470]  So I'm going to be with you here till five o'clock central.
[00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.470]  So we got just over 30 minutes together.
[00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.370]  And then Alex is going to be taking over with these amazing interviews.
[00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:08.230]  So stay tuned for that.
[00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:12.430]  I do have some other news that I will cover before then, but I wanted to let you know
[00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:13.430]  that's coming up.
[00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:18.090]  And also, just so we can pay some bills around here, folks, because Alex is going to be really
[00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:22.430]  busy the next three hours with these interviews, InfoWarsStore.com is how everything we do
[00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:23.990]  here is possible.
[00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:30.870]  I'm a product of the product at InfoWarsStore.com, but right now we have Christmas in August.
[00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.790]  What innovation will we come up with next?
[00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:39.190]  This Christmas in August, huge sales and discounts on top selling top rated products
[00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:44.630]  like Vitamin Mineral Fusion, which is back in stock and 25% off right now.

[00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.550]  This sells out fast.

[00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:58.350]  I start every day with Vitamin Mineral Fusion because it has more than 100% daily value
[00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:05.190]  of Vitamin A, Vitamin B6, B12, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and so much more.
[00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:09.250]  Right when I start my day, I like to mix it with juice to enhance the flavor, but it already
[00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.250]  tastes great.
[00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:15.590]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 25% off InfoWarsStore.com, and it's your support there that keeps us
[00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.590]  on the air.
[00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:20.830]  And remember, Christmas savings in August happening right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:25.790]  All right, you want to talk about poetic justice.
[00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.550]  This is actually sad, but I mean, it is what it is.
[00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:33.350]  I'm not going to shed a tear because the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team is an embarrassment
[00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.350]  to us.
[00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:39.710]  But nonetheless, there's no Mia Hams out there.
[00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:46.390]  There's no World Cup champions anymore out there because they lost.
[00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.630]  I guess, was that last night or this morning?
[00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.630]  I don't know.
[00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:53.310]  I've lost interest in this team because they hate us so much.
[00:26:53.310 --> 00:27:00.870]  And with a leader like Megan Rapinoe, she's no leader.
[00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.670]  But when that's your leadership, you're pretty much doomed to fail.
[00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:07.670]  Now I just want to show you this.
[00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:12.110]  So here's Megan Rapinoe with the game on the line.
[00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:17.550]  Megan Rapinoe with the game on the line, the World Cup game, first round of elimination.
[00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:24.430]  Here's Megan Rapinoe, clip five with the game on the line, with her blue man haircut.
[00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:29.430]  Biff's it, and then a little meme for you.
[00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.030]  But so, that's fine guys.
[00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.150]  So there you go.
[00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.230]  She completely blew the game.
[00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.710]  Now I don't think Megan Rapinoe blew it on purpose.
[00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.270]  She's way too selfish for that.
[00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:44.550]  However, her hatred of country may have overwhelmed her selfishness and subconsciously she may
[00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.270]  have missed it on purpose.
[00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.190]  And then she was asked, because she's finished playing now, she was asked what her favorite
[00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.590]  memory was.
[00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.430]  And this is what she said in clip four.
[00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:58.990]  Is there a memory that stands out to you right now in this moment?
[00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:09.310]  Oh, um, I mean, probably equal pay chance after the final.
[00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.450]  Gross.
[00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:14.430]  And I think, you know, they're saying equal pay, but could have been saying a lot of things.
[00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:18.430]  I think this team has always fought for something.
[00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:22.270]  So equal pay, even though you don't earn it, a total commie.
[00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.950]  And then you choke with the game on the line.
[00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.390]  And that's all because of affirmative action.
[00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:26.390]  She didn't belong on the field.
[00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.230]  She played like crap the whole time.
[00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.990]  But you know, they just had to have her out there for a political statement in those hideous
[00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.990]  uniforms.
[00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.390]  I hope this though, I hope that we don't have to endure this anymore from the women's national
[00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:37.390]  soccer team.
[00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.830]  And I hope they make it fun and exhilarating to cheer for them again, like when Mia Hamm
[00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:46.470]  and the rest beat China in the world cup, I don't know if it'll, it might take four
[00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:50.870]  years to remove the cancer that was Megan Rapinoe and her politics and liberalism, but
[00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:55.070]  maybe in four years we can have a proud women's national team of women that want to be women
[00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:59.430]  look like women and represent women and our country proudly.
[00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.870]  For everything, the globalists hit us with God through mother nature has given us the
[00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:04.870]  answer.
[00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:09.070]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it

[00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:17.390]  Everybody knows it's incredible.
[00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:18.390]  It works.

[00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.290]  or four CBD makers in the country.

[00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.010]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:55.730]  So this is the highest rated already at the lowest price, not even a lower price rebels

[00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.830]  book that documents the globalists in their own words plan for our future.
[00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:08.830]  That is a hellish future.
[00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:12.830]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:16.830]  be able to get an unsigned copy of the great reset and the war for the world at bookstores,
[00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:20.990]  Amazon, or info or store.com but you will never be able to get another signed copy of
[00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:25.750]  the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them
[00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:26.750]  right now.
[00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:31.350]  So get your copy of the great reset and the war for the world, a signed copy at info or
[00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:36.190]  store.com and there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:39.190]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.670]  You'll also know that you help keep employers on the air.
[00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.270]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:50.230]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to info or store.com
[00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:54.070]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library
[00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.350]  or give them to the local school.
[00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:57.350]  This is an info war.
[00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.430]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.830]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic five
[00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.870]  G or the GMO crops.
[00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:10.710]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.270]  industry to use.
[00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.610]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:19.270]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:24.870]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:25.990]  Look it up.
[00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.230]  Don't let them do this to your family.

[00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:07.810]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:27.300]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar, and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:33.300]  Donald Trump actually had something to say about ol' Megan Rapinoe.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:38.300]  I guess he knew this was coming. Here was Trump talking about Rapinoe.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:48.300]  I got in a little trouble. I said that our women's soccer team was supposed to easily win, but they went woke.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:55.300]  Except for a few of them. I love those women that stood up and they saluted our flag. There were some of them.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:02.300]  But the one with the purple hair, she didn't play too well.
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:11.300]  She went woke. You can have her. And they didn't do too well. Unfortunately. We want them to do well, but they didn't.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:19.300]  But it's true about woke. You just take a look. Everything goes bad. It's really, it's a shortcut to losing everything.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:25.300]  There's really no excuse why the women's national team would get bumped with zero goals.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:30.300]  They barely even made it to the elimination round. But we all know what it is. Once you go woke, you go broke.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:44.300]  When Megan Rapinoe, a despicable human being, a grotesque individual, a cancer politically, ideologically, culturally, a cancer to your spirit,
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.300]  when that's your leader, you're doomed. You're doomed.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:58.300]  And so all the success, all the momentum that women in the United States had to be, I mean, by far the best women's soccer program in the world.
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:07.300]  It wasn't even close. The female domination of the United States women of soccer has all been destroyed.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:14.300]  It's not fair to put it completely on Megan Rapinoe's shoulders, but it's her ideology. It's her culture. It's her spirit.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:23.300]  It's her attitude that was a cancer on that team. And now they exit in an abysmal, probably the worst performance for the U.S. women's national team ever.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:29.300]  Let's just hope, I don't know, four years is enough. It might take eight. A cancer like Megan Rapinoe might take eight years.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:37.300]  You need to have like an exorcism. But let's hope four years from now, when the women get back in there, it's a team that we can be proud of.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:44.300]  It's a team that puts country over politics. It's a team that puts pride over politics.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:54.300]  And doesn't obsess with pay over everything else like Megan Rapinoe stated so clearly in the last segment.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:59.300]  So I don't know if four years is enough to remove the cancer that Megan Rapinoe will leave behind.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:08.300]  But let's hope in four years there's a women's national team that make one a cheer from instead of laughing and cheering sadly at their demise.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.300]  Let's just hope. Let's just hope.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:18.300]  You know, Donald Trump is really taking the gloves off here.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:24.300]  Trump gives Nancy Pelosi the what for calls her a wicked witch who will someday live in hell.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:30.300]  Well, do you disagree? I mean, I don't know. Not so sure if I disagree with that.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.300]  Now, I want to do we need to give a little advice to Trump here.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:47.300]  I want to give a little advice to Trump and his legal team here, because people have started to mention a trend, perhaps, that Donald Trump has with some of his legal representation.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:37:01.300]  And obviously, it's not all. But Elena Haba kind of takes center stage at times when it comes to the media getting a representation of Trump's legal team, even though I'm not even sure what case she's on right now.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:07.300]  And so. People are mentioning, they're saying, oh, well, you know, Trump's got a type, doesn't he?
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:13.300]  Trump's got a legal type. Yeah. Yeah. Elena Haba has really strong legal assets.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:19.300]  She's got very noticeable, strong legal assets. Now. I think we need to actually embrace this.
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:24.300]  And Trump is understand has understood optics his whole life.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:32.300]  But see, it's not just about having a a beautiful woman out there to try to get him on TV and to get his message out there, though, though that is effective.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:47.300]  I think what Donald Trump needs to do, especially if he if he expects any of this to get in front of a jury, Donald Trump needs to load up his legal team with with every optical advantage possible.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:53.300]  So I'm talking beautiful woman like that. I'm talking big, strong alpha man.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:38:02.300]  I'm talking like stereotypical Jewish lawyer. I'm talking get like a butch lesbian up there. Get a trans lawyer up there.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:07.300]  I'm dead serious. I would I would hire every different type of unique individual.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:14.300]  You can that that looks like something that looks like a physical representation of something that you can understand.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:19.300]  And I would put all of them on the legal team and I'd have all of them doing arguments in front of the jury.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:26.300]  Do you know how much that will screw up the left's mind? Do you have any idea the rewiring that would do to a liberal jury pool?
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:31.300]  They don't know what to think. A trans lawyer protecting Donald Trump.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:38.300]  Oh, what a butch lesbian here. I have a flamboyant gay man. I mean, running around like hopping around.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:47.300]  I'm serious. I hire every every stereotypical type of person clearly and proud to represent that optically.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:52.300]  And I'd put them all in that courtroom and I would cross I would cross all the wires of the liberal ideology.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.300]  They want to know I have a big have a big black man in there, have a big loud black woman in there.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:06.300]  I'm serious. I would I would 10 lawyers all looking differently and just screw with all the liberals wires in their head.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:12.300]  The jury pool won't know what to do. A black woman defending Donald Trump, a black man defending Donald Trump,
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:20.300]  a lesbian defending Donald Trump, a gay man defending Donald Trump, a trans person defending Donald Trump.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.300]  They won't know what to do. Their brains will just melt.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:28.300]  And then imagine the media coverage. Oh, it'd be too beautiful.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:38.300]  I'm serious, Donald Trump. Do it. Just make them go into fits of rage and fury.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:42.300]  Have them in a complete tizzy fit that they can't control the optics of this case.
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:49.300]  Put put put some girl up there dressed just like Barbie. Hire hire legally blonde.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:54.300]  I'm serious, because you got to understand this is your only chance up against a leftist army
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:59.300]  in a jury pool is to try to cross their wires and get them doubting their own ideologies,
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.300]  get them doubting their own politics. It's the only way to do it.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:12.300]  So, no, I don't think you should just have Elena Haba out there, you know, letting you know Donald Trump has good taste.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:20.300]  I'd go I'd just go full stereotypical at every single way you possibly can.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:26.300]  That's what I would do if I was Donald Trump and put them all on TV, have them all out in front of the media.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:30.300]  And if you do think this thing is going to be in a courtroom where you're going to be presenting to a jury,
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:36.300]  that's when it's really going to cash in. That's when it's really going to cash in.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:41.300]  And then, you know, it just gets more ridiculous. And James Comey is running around right now.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:46.300]  We confronted him when he came to Austin about this. He's saying, oh, I was the one that got Epstein.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.300]  I was the one that got Epstein. And now his daughter is the one protecting Epstein.
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:54.300]  Feds fight to keep Jeffrey Epstein's trove of documents secret.
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:59.300]  They don't want you to know who was involved in raping all of Epstein's sex slaves.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.300]  They don't want you to know that it was Donald Trump.
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.300]  They would, though, guarantee you that it was Donald Trump.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:12.300]  If it was Donald Trump, they would gladly sacrifice every single one of their operatives if it brought down Donald Trump, folks.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:17.300]  Comey's daughter, Maureen Comey, James Comey's daughter, Maureen Comey,
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:26.300]  is the prosecutor asking for categorical withholding to keep from influencing Ghislaine Maxwell's possible retrial.
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:36.300]  So now it's young Comey in there keeping the Epstein documents secret so that you don't know who was raping Epstein's sex slaves.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:42.300]  But mark my words, if it was Donald Trump, they'd release the whole list tomorrow.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.300]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen, they would, and you know it.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:51.300]  Meanwhile, Ron DeSantis' political career is coming to a slow halt.
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.300]  His events are barely getting 100 people at him anymore.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:59.300]  It's sad, but he chose to go with the establishment conservatives.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:03.300]  He chose to go with the Bush wing of the Republican Party, and so he dug his own grave, sadly.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.300]  I believe he's a good man. I believe he was a great governor of Florida.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:12.300]  But now he's slept with the wrong people, and so he basically has political herpes, and it's all over him.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.300]  It's really sad. You hate to see it.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:18.300]  And then there's Justin Trudeau, who comes out as gay over the weekend.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:24.300]  I'm sorry, never mind. He's just really excited to go to the Barbie movie with his straight friend.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:33.300]  I mean, he divorces his wife, and then he's out here with, well, I don't know what that is exactly, but he's on Team Barbie.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.300]  And then it's just sad because that's really what the West is.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:43.300]  It's people that look like clowns, and then whatever you think about the politics of the East or Putin or Xi Jinping,
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:46.300]  at least they're serious men, and they look like serious men.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:53.300]  All right. Alex Jones coming up on the other side of this break with America's Shaman and Scott Bennett.
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.300]  And can't miss interviews here on this Sunday night.

[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.300]  you must find a way.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.300]  We have entered the fray and we will not obey.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.300]  We must find a way
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.300]  and find faith.
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.300]  We won't let them divide.
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.300]  We will never abide.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.300]  We will find a way.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.300]  Infowars.com
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.300]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth,
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:05.300]  hands down this is the most concentrated, high quality bone broth there is.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:09.300]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.300]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom,
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.300]  a massive dose of bee pollen,

[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.300]  and then it just gets crazier from there.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.300]  It's about to sell out.

[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:55.300]  We're selling out ultimate bone broth at infowarsstore.com.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.300]  40% off, about to sell out.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.300]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:05.300]  highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.300]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:13.300]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.300]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid,
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.300]  still highly toxic but containable.
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.300]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.300]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:30.300]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.300]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:37.300]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic,
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:42.300]  untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:47.300]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:51.300]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.300]  and a remedy to this madness.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:57.300]  Available now at infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:17.050]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:23.050]  And it's time for you men to stand up in the infowars and say, I don't know what's going
[00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:28.050]  on, but if you want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:33.050]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:54.050 --> 00:48:05.050]  Dr. Charles Morgan, former CIA and consultant for the U.S. military on neurological sciences,
[00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:11.050]  spoke to cadets at West Point in 2018 about the current state of technology.
[00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:18.050]  He briefed the cadets on experiments from 2013, where humans were given neural implants
[00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:22.050]  that allowed them to control prosthetic arms with their thoughts.
[00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:29.050]  Experiments where one person can control another person's hands by just wearing an EEG cap.
[00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:33.050]  The person on the receiving end described the sensation as rather odd.
[00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:37.050]  He said, I didn't know anything until I saw my hand beginning to move.
[00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:44.050]  But the really fun part was that you're taking over somebody else's physical body with the mind of another human.
[00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:46.050]  So what do you think would be the next step?
[00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:51.050]  Experiments where information is transmitted from one mind to another.
[00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:55.050]  And experiments where memories are erased.
[00:48:55.050 --> 00:49:00.050]  Dr. Morgan admits they have the technology to target an individual person.
[00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:01.050]  But you can engineer anything.
[00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:05.050]  You can engineer a unique thing that would only kill one person in the world.
[00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:10.050]  And are working on the ability to erase the memories of any human they choose.
[00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:16.050]  Their biggest challenge five years ago was being able to interface with the hippocampus
[00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:18.050]  without the use of physical wires.
[00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:25.050]  And this is most likely one of the motivating factors for the deployment of the experimental COVID shots.
[00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:32.050]  Using dark field microscopy, Dr. Ana Maria Mijalcea has captured in great detail
[00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:38.050]  what the scientific literature describes as effective technologies that exist today.
[00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:41.050]  Technology such as quantum dots.
[00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:47.050]  Quantum dots are nanotechnology with the ability to organize, operate, communicate,
[00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:50.050]  and build structures within the blood.
[00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:59.050]  They do so with a tunable photoluminescence that can be programmed to dictate various tasks via optical communication.
[00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:03.050]  The description and images displayed in the scientific literature
[00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:10.050]  compared to what Mijalcea's dark field microscopy has captured are the same.
[00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:13.050]  You can see the quantum dots blinking in different colors,
[00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:18.050]  acting as the artificial intelligence directing the self-assembly around them.
[00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:23.050]  Bubbles are created within the blood that act as construction sites.
[00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:30.050]  Within these construction bubbles, the quantum dots organize the various materials into self-assembly.
[00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:37.050]  These technologies are being found in both the blood of the vaccinated and in the blood of the unvaccinated.
[00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:43.050]  Depending on what materials are needed, the quantum dots will trigger them into self-assembly.
[00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:50.050]  The COVID vaccines are full of rare and heavy metals to make all manner of nanotechnology.
[00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:55.050]  But it seems as if almost everyone is infected with some sort of nanotech.
[00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.050]  According to several research teams,
[00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:06.050]  everyone's blood seems to contain the materials required to produce the filaments and the latticework for this technology.
[00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:10.050]  Blood samples that appear to be healthy have been completely transformed
[00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:15.050]  by applying a mere 10 milliamps of electric current for two hours.
[00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:19.050]  And it looks as if we may have been infected by the chemtrails.
[00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:23.050]  Morgellons disease was first reported in 2002.
[00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:28.050]  It's when synthetic fibers or filaments are growing in a person's body.
[00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:33.050]  It has been theorized for decades that this was being spread via chemtrails.
[00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:39.050]  And under a microscope, it appears to be the same filaments that people today are calling blood clots
[00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:44.050]  and what the scientific journals call self-assembled hydrogels.
[00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:49.050]  According to Dane Wigington from geoengineeringwatch.org,
[00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:53.050]  nanoparticles are being sprayed worldwide.
[00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:58.050]  The good news is that Dr. Mielcia's research has found a remedy.
[00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:03.050]  The iron in the infected blood has been oxidized to a 3-plus state.
[00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:08.050]  And by taking antioxidants, one is able to dissolve these filament clots.
[00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:15.050]  She has found that EDTA chelation therapy will remedy infected blood within three days.
[00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:20.050]  And megadosing vitamin C also seems to work.
[00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:23.050]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:48.050]  ...conspiracy theorist.
[00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:56.050]  Alex Jones.
[00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:00.050]  Stop!
[00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:02.050]  Ruslan, stop!
[00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:12.050]  Your reputation is amazing.
[00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:14.050]  I will not let you down.
[00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:17.050]  I'm very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:30.050]  Jake, wonderful having you on with us yesterday for that hour,
[00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:33.050]  but with commercial breaks we only had about 50 minutes.
[00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:39.050]  So now I'd like to have you go wherever you want on The New World Order,
[00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:42.050]  on The Nature of Reality, on The Globalist, on where you think they're going,
[00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:46.050]  on the Ukraine war, on the Casual Society, on Trump,
[00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:49.050]  but then interspersed between your hosting here,
[00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:52.050]  because I'm going to just be riding shotgun with you for the next hour and a half or so.
[00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:58.050]  I will also bring up some topics and play some Trump clips and things of what he's been saying
[00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:01.050]  and give my take on that.
[00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:03.050]  But thank you for joining us.
[00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:07.050]  Do you want to comment on this poison shot news I just rolled out,
[00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.050]  or just move on to other topics?
[00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:15.050]  Well, actually, I could bring it all around as soon as I kind of lay some groundwork, if you like.
[00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:17.050]  You've got the floor, go ahead.
[00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:18.050]  Okay, cool.
[00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:22.050]  All right, so according to the HeartMath Institute,
[00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:27.050]  our DNA acts almost like antenna, kind of like our brain acts like antenna
[00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:32.050]  for what something quantum physicists call as non-local consciousness.
[00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:38.050]  They say that consciousness is not an emergent property of complex neural activity in the brain,
[00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:42.050]  but rather consciousness is kind of like the laws of physics.
[00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:44.050]  It's embedded in the universe.
[00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:50.050]  So consciousness is very intricately and tightly knit into the fabric of reality itself.
[00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:53.050]  And they call this non-local consciousness.
[00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:58.050]  And they say that our DNA and our brains are like antenna for this non-local consciousness.
[00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:04.050]  We are sending and receiving light and information or electromagnetic signals through our DNA
[00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:09.050]  and through these antenna on our DNA and through our brain and brain activity.
[00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:18.050]  So what ends up activating this DNA is the emotions that we feel.
[00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:22.050]  So if we have a low-frequency emotion, if we have a low-frequency thought,
[00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:28.050]  then this creates a wave of fear in the electromagnetic field around the body.
[00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:33.050]  And when you do that, it activates far less of the antenna on the DNA.
[00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:37.050]  So when you then have a feeling of love,
[00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:41.050]  then what ends up happening is that it's a much higher-frequency emotion,
[00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:47.050]  a higher-frequency thought, and far more antenna are activated on the DNA.
[00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:51.050]  Now, the other thing that happens is that the electromagnetic field around the body
[00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:54.050]  actually during fear-based thoughts and emotions, it constricts,
[00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.050]  and it gets tighter around the body.
[00:55:56.050 --> 00:56:00.050]  The DNA also really constricts, and it tightens up, and it degrades faster.
[00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:05.050]  Whereas in the case of love, the DNA actually expands, and it relaxes,
[00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:08.050]  and all of these antenna get activated on it,
[00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:11.050]  and the electromagnetic field around the body expands,
[00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:14.050]  and it expands further and further beyond the body.
[00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:19.050]  So our thoughts and our emotions are electromagnetic frequencies.
[00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:25.050]  And we are creating a feedback loop of light and information or electromagnetic activity
[00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:29.050]  with non-local consciousness through our brains, through our hearts,
[00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:30.050]  through our DNA.
[00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:33.050]  And by the way, what you're saying, I just want to interrupt briefly.
[00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:35.050]  The quantum physicists all know this.
[00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:36.050]  This is not debated.
[00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:38.050]  When they observe neutrons or other particles,
[00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:40.050]  they do different things when they don't observe them.
[00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:43.050]  When people pray and look at a neutron, they've now learned it does different things.
[00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:49.050]  We are definitely having an effect like the force in Star Wars is a simple way of saying it.
[00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:51.050]  This is a real thing.
[00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:53.050]  Keep going.
[00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:56.050]  Yes, and that's why I practice shamanism.
[00:56:56.050 --> 00:57:01.050]  So let's talk about cymatics for a second.
[00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:03.050]  I'm sure you're familiar with cymatics, Alex.
[00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:04.050]  Yes.
[00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:05.050]  For those that aren't, though,
[00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:11.050]  cymatics is basically the use of sound and frequencies to create certain patterns within mediums.
[00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:14.050]  So I'm sure many people have seen the video where somebody puts, like,
[00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:18.050]  grains of sand or grains of rice on, like, a metal plate or a speaker,
[00:57:18.050 --> 00:57:23.050]  and then what they do is they plug a sound into the speaker, they turn a frequency on,
[00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:29.050]  and then the frequency ends up causing the grains of rice to manifest in a pattern of sorts
[00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:33.050]  because of the vibration that is being channeled through the speaker.
[00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:38.050]  Now, the higher the frequency, the more complex the pattern.
[00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:41.050]  The lower the frequency, the less complex the pattern.
[00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:55.610]  The Globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots, or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[00:57:55.610 --> 00:58:01.610]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:05.610]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:10.610]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you
[00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:14.610]  and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:16.610]  Look it up. Don't let them do this to your family.
[00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:19.610]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:22.610]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:25.610]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:27.610]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:29.610]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:32.610]  It is amazing. It's great for your home, your business.
[00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:35.610]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:36.610]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:40.610]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the Globalist onslaught.
[00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:42.610]  Get yours today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:44.610]  For a limited time, we're running a 10% discount.

[00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:47.610]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:48.610]  You need this filter.
[00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:52.610]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:57.610]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:57.610 --> 00:59:04.610]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement maker
[00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:05.610]  that are Lister's and Patriot's.
[00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:10.610]  They're allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[00:59:10.610 --> 00:59:14.610]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:19.610]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain
[00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:22.610]  and to also make your nerves healthier,
[00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:27.610]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:29.610]  There's major research behind this all.
[00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:32.610]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD
[00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:39.610]  and Nerve Renew from InfoWarsMD exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:42.610]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:46.610]  You'll find them exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com, and they fund our operation.
[00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:55.610]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:07.610]  Now, if we look at Earth like it is the speaker,
[01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:12.610]  and we look at the electromagnetic field around the Earth like it is the frequency,
[01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:18.610]  then we as human beings, our civilizations, all life forms on the planet
[01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:22.610]  end up basically being the grains of rice that are on the speaker
[01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:25.610]  and being moved by the frequency.
[01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:30.610]  Now, this is really profound because if our thoughts and our emotions
[01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:35.610]  are electromagnetic frequencies that are tied into the electromagnetic field of the Earth itself,
[01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:42.610]  then it would make sense that our, like we were saying about moon cycles
[01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:46.610]  and what people say about moon cycles and how certain people have,
[01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:52.610]  women have their periods or women give birth at a higher percentage rate
[01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:57.610]  during full moon cycles, or emergency rooms are more full during full moon cycles
[01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:58.610]  and stuff like that.
[01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:03.610]  And they've also done studies with mammals that even if women are between a wall
[01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:07.610]  and pheromones aren't able to go over, still the women's periods will sync up
[01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:11.610]  just because they're in proximity, showing that there is an interdimensional frequency.
[01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:13.610]  Yes, exactly.
[01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:17.610]  So, like I said, the Earth is the speaker,
[01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:20.610]  the electromagnetic field around the planet is the frequency,
[01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:24.610]  and the people and our civilizations are the grains of rice.
[01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:29.610]  Now, each and every new age, from say the age of Pisces to the age of Aquarius
[01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:34.610]  or something like that, see here we're inexorably linked to the sacred geometry
[01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:35.610]  of the universe itself.
[01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:39.610]  Everything is a fractal in its pattern and in its structure.
[01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:43.610]  So, because we are a manifestation of the universe itself,
[01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:47.610]  because we are the universe looking at itself, we are made in the image of God,
[01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:53.610]  we are inexorably linked to this frequency that is creating all of reality.
[01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:56.610]  All of reality is based on cymatics.
[01:01:56.610 --> 01:02:00.610]  God was the word, the word was with God, right?
[01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:01.610]  Let there be light.
[01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:02.610]  What is a word?
[01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:04.610]  A word is sound.
[01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:07.610]  So, all of reality is basically based on this notion of cymatics
[01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:11.610]  and energy being channeled through this feedback loop of light and information
[01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:14.610]  that isn't just going through our bodies,
[01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:18.610]  but it's also going through the planet, through the vortexes on the planet,
[01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.610]  through the ley lines on the planet.
[01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:23.610]  It's also going through the sun and all of the planets in the solar system.
[01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:26.610]  It's going through the stars in the galaxy.
[01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:27.610]  It's going through the galaxy.
[01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.610]  It's going through all the galaxy and galaxy fields.
[01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:31.610]  It's going through the whole universe itself,
[01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:34.610]  because everything is made up of energy.
[01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:37.610]  So, each and every single new age, you see here,
[01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:39.610]  human beings are kind of like in the middle.
[01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:43.610]  Human beings are in the middle of all this infinitely complex
[01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:46.610]  sacred geometric resonance frequencies.
[01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:49.610]  Everything is based on harmonics and mathematics.
[01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:52.610]  So, all the way down to the atomic and the quantum,
[01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:54.610]  all the way out to the universal and multiversal,
[01:02:54.610 --> 01:02:56.610]  it's all based on the same sacred geometry.
[01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:58.610]  It's all based on the same pattern.
[01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:01.610]  It's all based on cymatics, right?
[01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:05.610]  And based on the cymatic frequency of the universe,
[01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:10.610]  that will determine what our thoughts, what our emotions are, etc.
[01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:14.610]  And there are cycles to this energy moving through the cosmos and our bodies.
[01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:17.610]  And this is why each and every new age,
[01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:23.610]  we are going to see a different pattern of energy manifest itself on the planet.
[01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:27.610]  And that is going to manifest as different species in the ecosystems.
[01:03:27.610 --> 01:03:31.610]  It's also going to manifest as different versions of human civilization.
[01:03:31.610 --> 01:03:38.610]  It's going to manifest as different thoughts and views of reality.
[01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:42.610]  It's going to manifest in different cultural behaviors, etc.
[01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.610]  So, what's really interesting to note, though,
[01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:49.610]  is that when you look at the cymatic patterns and when they change,
[01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:53.610]  when they have a phase transition from, say, a low frequency to a high frequency,
[01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:57.610]  what ends up happening is that in between that phase transition,
[01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:59.610]  in between one frequency and another,
[01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:03.610]  as the frequency changes, there is a period of chaos
[01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:06.610]  where there is no discernible pattern whatsoever.
[01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:11.610]  And then all of a sudden, boom, the pattern then reemerges.
[01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:13.610]  A new pattern emerges.
[01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:18.610]  So this is why we are living through the time that we are living in
[01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:21.610]  because we are kind of moving through this phase transition period
[01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:23.610]  where we are moving into a new frequency
[01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:27.610]  because we have just gone from the age of Pisces into the age of Aquarius.
[01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:29.610]  And I want to be clear here, Jake.
[01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:32.610]  I want to be clear just to say I am a Christian, Holy Spirit, God.
[01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:35.610]  But God made the universe and made all these energies.
[01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:38.610]  And then the mainline churches don't want people to know about these energies.
[01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:40.610]  And that goes into the Masons and other groups
[01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:42.610]  that have been suppressing this information
[01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:46.610]  while claiming that they are bringing forward the light,
[01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:49.610]  but really they are bringing forth, in my research, a false light.
[01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:55.610]  This is really proof of God's handiwork in the universe.
[01:04:55.610 --> 01:04:57.610]  The signature is everywhere.
[01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:28.610]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[01:05:28.610 --> 01:05:31.610]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:33.610]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:36.610]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:39.610]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:47.610]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.610]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess
[01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:53.610]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:54.610]  I just can't do it.
[01:05:54.610 --> 01:06:05.610]  If you look into the phi ratio or the golden mean,
[01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:09.610]  the phi ratio, the Fibonacci sequence, and the sacred spiral and all that stuff,
[01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:11.610]  then this is God's signature.
[01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:18.610]  The double torus field, the toroidal field, what's called the vector equilibrium,
[01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:22.610]  all of these things are sacred geometric patterns that are fractal in nature.
[01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:27.610]  And because they are mathematically sound, because they are mathematically stable,
[01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:30.610]  and because they are harmonically stable, they are able to be built upon
[01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:33.610]  in size and scale infinitely large and infinitely small.
[01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:38.610]  Did you see that French physicist, I forget the name, they can pull it up,
[01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:43.610]  type in sacred geometry Saturn, and he predicted over 100 years ago
[01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:47.610]  that if we were able to look at the poles of Saturn,
[01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:53.610]  that it would have a hexagon on it, that an interdimensional field,
[01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:56.610]  because it was a big enough gas giant, would manifest that,
[01:06:56.610 --> 01:06:59.610]  and when Voyager finally flew over it, there it was.
[01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:02.610]  Yes, and that's where we get into the Saturnian cube,
[01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:05.610]  and that's why we see all these cubes and stuff and corporate logos
[01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:06.610]  and things of that nature.
[01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:11.610]  Now what's really interesting about that is that it's been discovered that,
[01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:13.610]  yeah, see, there it is.
[01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:20.610]  It's been discovered that when a human being looks at a pattern,
[01:07:20.610 --> 01:07:24.610]  what ends up happening is the multidimensional neurological structure within the brain,
[01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:28.610]  because our brain has several dimensions of neurological connections.
[01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:33.610]  The multidimensional neurological structure in the brain
[01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:37.610]  actually mirrors the symbol that people are looking at.
[01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:41.610]  So if we're all looking at cubes, or we're all looking at the evil eye of Saturn,
[01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:44.610]  like in the CBS logo or something like that,
[01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:47.610]  then those patterns are going to manifest in our psyche,
[01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:49.610]  and in one way or another affect our subconscious brain,
[01:07:49.610 --> 01:07:51.610]  and therefore our conscious brain.
[01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:54.610]  I was about to ask you, why are the dark magicians suppressing this,
[01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:57.610]  and why are they obsessed with the cube of Saturn?
[01:07:57.610 --> 01:08:00.610]  Well, actually, I was just about to get into that.
[01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:09.610]  The reason why we are seeing the old systems falling apart
[01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:12.610]  and the corruption becoming so apparent,
[01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:16.610]  and the reason why ideology is playing a really big role,
[01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:22.610]  is because the pattern and the frequency of our thoughts and our emotions,
[01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:25.610]  electromagnetic frequencies here on the planet, is changing.
[01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:28.610]  But this is also why these corrupt individuals,
[01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:30.610]  these globalist less-than-one-percenters,
[01:08:30.610 --> 01:08:35.610]  are creating a society that is based on controlling our collective consciousness,
[01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:39.610]  because they understand it's about controlling the electromagnetic field
[01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:43.610]  in the ley lines of the planet, and we'll get into that in just a little bit.
[01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:47.610]  But they're trying to control the collective consciousness of humanity,
[01:08:47.610 --> 01:08:50.610]  and they're doing so through psychological warfare techniques.
[01:08:50.610 --> 01:08:54.610]  They're trying to keep us in a low-frequency state of thought and emotion,
[01:08:54.610 --> 01:08:57.610]  so that we don't expand our consciousness beyond the physical body,
[01:08:57.610 --> 01:09:01.610]  so that we are living in an illusion of separation.
[01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:03.610]  Now, in the Amazonian tradition,
[01:09:03.610 --> 01:09:10.610]  they believe that the root of all evil is rooted in the illusion of separation.
[01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:12.610]  That's right. Let me interrupt you. I said you'd have the floor, but this is so key.
[01:09:12.610 --> 01:09:16.610]  I had a top psychiatrist, medical doctor, on two days ago,
[01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:19.610]  and she said, reading the Tabastock Institute that created the whole trans movement,
[01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:23.610]  is disembodiment is their religion separating us from our bodies
[01:09:23.610 --> 01:09:25.610]  and from the connection of the universe.
[01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:29.610]  So they're literally trying to capture us in a false reality they're creating.
[01:09:29.610 --> 01:09:32.610]  That is 100% correct.
[01:09:32.610 --> 01:09:35.610]  So once again, it's psychological warfare techniques.
[01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:38.610]  It's about enslaving and controlling our minds
[01:09:38.610 --> 01:09:42.610]  to maintain and reinforce this illusion of separation,
[01:09:42.610 --> 01:09:48.610]  and in turn—see, this is the frequencies of love and frequencies of fear here,
[01:09:48.610 --> 01:09:51.610]  based on, like, if you map these frequencies on the DNA,
[01:09:51.610 --> 01:09:54.610]  then you end up activating less DNA with a fear-based emotion,
[01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:58.610]  and every one of these dots that is on the DNA is an antenna that is activated
[01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:00.610]  to send and receive light and information,
[01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:05.610]  send and receive electromagnetic activity or electromagnetic signals with non-local consciousness.
[01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:08.610]  So they're trying to keep us in this low-frequency state of fear
[01:10:08.610 --> 01:10:11.610]  so that they can control our thoughts, so they can control our emotions,
[01:10:11.610 --> 01:10:13.610]  so that they can control our behavior,
[01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:19.610]  and they're doing this to maintain and reinforce a system of global enslavement
[01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:22.610]  to a socioeconomic and geopolitical system
[01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:26.610]  that is entirely based on corruption and their control.
[01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:29.610]  Now, we are in the apocalypse right now.
[01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:31.610]  The apocalypse isn't a bad thing.
[01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:36.610]  It just means a revealing or a lifting of the veil during a time of mass deception.
[01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:40.610]  So it's not that things in the world are getting worse,
[01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.610]  because they've always been this bad.
[01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:45.610]  The thing is that things in the world and the truth of global corruption
[01:10:45.610 --> 01:10:50.610]  is becoming more and more and more obvious to the average individual.
[01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:53.610]  And that's why we see the Great Awakening, and that's why the system is so scared,
[01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:56.610]  and why they try to terrorize the leaders and pin us down
[01:10:56.610 --> 01:11:02.610]  so that we get in a space of fear so that we stop resonating as leaders in a chain reaction.
[01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:04.610]  That is correct.
[01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:07.610]  So with this whole thing regarding Saturn, right,
[01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:11.610]  if we understand the patterns that they're trying to implant in people's brains
[01:11:11.610 --> 01:11:14.610]  and therefore affect the collective consciousness of humanity,
[01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:18.610]  because I heard you saying earlier something about all we need is like 10 million people to learn this
[01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:20.610]  and then everything changes, right?
[01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:24.610]  So they are trying to keep the lid on human consciousness.
[01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:27.610]  They are trying to scare people that are leaders,
[01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:32.610]  that are trying to basically escape this matrix of subversion and control.
[01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:35.610]  They're trying to create fear in their hearts and in their minds
[01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:40.610]  so that these individuals will not act like a beacon of light for the rest of humanity.
[01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:46.610]  So that they won't reveal the nature to this what I call death matrix because that's what it is.
[01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:50.610]  The system that we're talking about is maintained by things like warfare,
[01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:53.610]  things like famine, things like disease, things like pollution,
[01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:57.610]  things like chaos, pain, suffering, right, death.
[01:11:57.610 --> 01:12:00.610]  That's what is maintaining this system that we're talking about.
[01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:02.610]  And what did Kerry say in the last three months?
[01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:05.610]  He said we must cut the food to save the earth.
[01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:07.610]  He means their globalist control of earth.
[01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:09.610]  So they must have war, they must have famine.
[01:12:09.610 --> 01:12:12.610]  He's literally saying we must cut down trees to save the earth.
[01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:13.610]  They're now bad.
[01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:16.610]  We must stop organic farming.
[01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:17.610]  It's bad.
[01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:19.610]  We must cut the food.
[01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:22.610]  I mean it's openly evil.
[01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:26.610]  Well, and they're trying to maintain their system of full spectrum dominance.
[01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:31.610]  You see, a lot of these elites believe that the greatest threat to the planet
[01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:34.610]  and to humanity is overpopulation.
[01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:38.610]  So because they believe that the greatest threat to the planet and humanity is overpopulation,
[01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:42.610]  they're trying to figure out strategic ways to depopulate the earth.
[01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:45.610]  But in the process, whether it be through things like geoengineering,
[01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:49.610]  the jab, mRNA injections, whether it be through pollution
[01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:54.610]  or not allowing people treatments for cancer that are going to cure their cancer,
[01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:59.610]  whether it be things like childhood leukemia and glyphosate and all sorts of stuff.
[01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:00.610]  5G.
[01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:02.610]  Regardless of what's that?
[01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:03.610]  Oh, yeah, 5G.
[01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:06.610]  Well, yeah, and what's really interesting about that is that
[01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:13.610]  let's talk about this death matrix for a second because it is what the death matrix is actually trying to cover up
[01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:16.610]  the divine matrix, what I call the divine matrix,
[01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:19.610]  which is based on understanding of sacred geometry,
[01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:24.610]  understanding of the nature of cymatics in the universe,
[01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:30.610]  the nature of our bodies and how they are interconnected or quantum entangled to all of creation.
[01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:32.610]  So that's the divine matrix.
[01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:34.610]  And we could go into that a little more deeply later.
[01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:43.610]  But the point is that these less than 1 percenters are trying to use their death matrix of anthropogenic chemicals,
[01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:45.610]  which are man-made chemicals that don't biodegrade,
[01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:49.610]  but instead they bioaccumulate in the ecosystem to toxic levels
[01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:53.610]  and they destroy the microbiological life in the water, the air and the soil.
[01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:56.610]  And they basically make ecosystems unlivable.
[01:13:56.610 --> 01:13:59.610]  It creates what's called ecocide and mass extinctions.
[01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:02.610]  They are also using propaganda.
[01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:04.610]  They are also to control the minds.
[01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:07.610]  They are also using electromagnetic frequencies, 5G.
[01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:08.610]  They are using Wi-Fi.
[01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:14.610]  They are using all sorts of invisible frequencies,
[01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:19.610]  piggybacking in pop culture music or movies,
[01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:23.610]  back masking, subliminal messaging, these kinds of things.
[01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:28.610]  They are also using things like the child and human trafficking networks,
[01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:32.610]  40 million slaves to keep the consciousness suppressed,
[01:14:32.610 --> 01:14:36.610]  to keep enough fear, pain, suffering in the grid,
[01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:39.610]  in the electromagnetic grid system of the planet itself.
[01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:41.610]  What they are doing to these kids.
[01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:43.610]  We've talked about – I'm sure you know about Ronald Bernard,
[01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:48.610]  the Dutch international banker that blew the whistle on the satanic rings of child sacrifice.
[01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:51.610]  I'm sure you know about the Franklin cover-up and Lawrence King.
[01:14:51.610 --> 01:14:55.610]  I'm sure you know about Michael Aquino, the lieutenant colonel who was a satanist
[01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:57.610]  and the founder of Temple of Set and all the things he was accused of.
[01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:59.610]  I'm sure you know about Barney Frank.
[01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:01.610]  I'm sure you know about Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:06.610]  I'm sure you know about the Finders and the FBI and everything that happened there
[01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:12.610]  and the UN and DynCorp and how they are all connected to child and human trafficking.
[01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:17.610]  All of these things are interconnected, and this is all part of the death matrix.
[01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:21.610]  The idea here is to use the pollution, to use the propaganda,
[01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:26.610]  to use the electromagnetic frequencies, to use this slave trade
[01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:31.610]  and to use the financial system to cover up this divine matrix
[01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:36.610]  and create a matrix of full-spectrum dominance for these less-than-one-percenters
[01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:42.610]  in which they can play God, in which they can essentially control our minds
[01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:47.610]  and therefore control the land, the waters, the seas, the air and the airspace,
[01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:52.610]  the subterranean, deep underground military bases, extraterrestrial or like space and satellites,
[01:15:53.610 --> 01:15:57.610]  chemical and biological agents and technology.
[01:15:58.610 --> 01:16:05.610]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:16:05.610 --> 01:16:08.610]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:13.610]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:19.610]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:25.610]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:30.610]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury
[01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:33.610]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:40.610]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:42.610]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:16:42.610 --> 01:16:47.610]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:16:47.610 --> 01:16:53.610]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.

[01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:09.610]  the incredible things it does for your nerves, your brain,
[01:18:09.610 --> 01:18:13.610]  your entire physiological system, for your nervous system particularly.
[01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:15.610]  Everybody knows it's incredible it works.

[01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:39.610]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:42.610]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[01:18:42.610 --> 01:18:46.610]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:49.610]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:53.610]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.

[01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:27.610]  Normally $69.98.
[01:19:27.610 --> 01:19:34.610]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing best, producing and making the MyPillow.
[01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:39.610]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how,
[01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:44.610]  using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:45.610]  That's what the debanking is about.
[01:19:45.610 --> 01:19:47.610]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:51.610]  That's why we've got a rush to support MyPillow.com and Infowars.com,
[01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:55.610]  plus they're great products in both places because we are the tip of the spear.
[01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:14.610]  So through the creation of this death matrix,
[01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:18.610]  through the creation of full spectrum dominance within this system that they control,
[01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:20.610]  they've monopolized all of our resources.
[01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:22.610]  They have monopolized our currency systems.
[01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:25.610]  They have monopolized all of our labor.
[01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:30.610]  And in this way, they've acted like our global enslavers in one way or another.
[01:20:30.610 --> 01:20:35.610]  But you can't enslave a mind that's already free.
[01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:39.610]  You can't take the trousers off of a bare ass.
[01:20:39.610 --> 01:20:40.610]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:45.610]  So they can't take from us what is given to us by God.
[01:20:45.610 --> 01:20:46.610]  We can only surrender it.
[01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:50.610]  That's why these propaganda campaigns are so intense.
[01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:55.610]  That's why the symbolism in Saturn worship and all that stuff is so intense
[01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:59.610]  because we have to willingly give over our sovereignty.
[01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:01.610]  We have to willingly give over our God.
[01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:04.610]  And that's why we see headlines out of the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN,
[01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:06.610]  saying don't ask questions.
[01:21:06.610 --> 01:21:07.610]  Asking questions is bad.
[01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:12.610]  Well, that's antithetical to common sense or science is not asking questions.
[01:21:12.610 --> 01:21:13.610]  No, that's the opposite of science.
[01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:17.610]  Everything they're saying is a straight-up lie, but they need us through laziness,
[01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:20.610]  not facing the truth, to accept the delusion.
[01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:23.610]  And then once you shift your mind into buying the delusion,
[01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:27.610]  you've shifted into their paradigm to then receive even greater delusions.
[01:21:27.610 --> 01:21:29.610]  Right.
[01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:31.610]  Now let's go back to this notion of what you were saying about, like,
[01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:35.610]  the double-slit experiment and the power of manifestation and the observer effect.
[01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:41.610]  So people like Klaus Schwab want everybody to believe that in the future
[01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:45.610]  we're all going to wear uniforms, we're all going to live in 15-minute cities,
[01:21:45.610 --> 01:21:48.610]  that we're all going to own nothing and like it, and everybody's going to eat bugs.
[01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:49.610]  Right?
[01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:53.610]  What he and all these globalists are doing, especially through the propaganda campaign.
[01:21:53.610 --> 01:21:55.610]  They're creating a false Oberton window of you'll own nothing, have nothing,
[01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:58.610]  eat bugs, drink sewage, and wear uniforms,
[01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:01.610]  and you'll no longer have your own home or have a car,
[01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:05.610]  to create the idea of a dystopic to enter into our minds that it's a foregone conclusion
[01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:08.610]  because we actually manifest what we build and what we believe,
[01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:14.610]  made in the image of God, so they begin to enslave our mind to believe that dystopia
[01:22:14.610 --> 01:22:17.610]  and not believe and build something far better.
[01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:20.610]  I said this over and over again in my new book, The Great Awakening.
[01:22:20.610 --> 01:22:24.610]  We can't, it's coming out soon, we can't just attack their system.
[01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:26.610]  We have to build the alternative.
[01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:29.610]  A hundred percent correct.
[01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:32.610]  And the only way we can do that is through nonviolence.
[01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:35.610]  The only way we can do that is through basically making our old system
[01:22:35.610 --> 01:22:38.610]  of full-spectrum dominance completely obsolete.
[01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:40.610]  So let's talk about this.
[01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:41.610]  Well, let's go back to Klaus Schwab.
[01:22:41.610 --> 01:22:42.610]  I interrupted.
[01:22:42.610 --> 01:22:43.610]  Finish your point in your own words.
[01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:46.610]  I know I wanted to not show off that I knew the answer,
[01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:47.610]  but to show that we're on the same page.
[01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:51.610]  That's because it's inherent prima facie truth.
[01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:54.610]  Go back to what Schwab wants us to believe.
[01:22:54.610 --> 01:22:58.610]  Well, you made the point for me, and that is that he is trying to inform
[01:22:58.610 --> 01:23:03.610]  or form in our minds his view of reality so that they can hijack our creative ability,
[01:23:03.610 --> 01:23:05.610]  so they can hijack our observer effect.
[01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:10.610]  He's trying to put in our minds his view of the future that he wants.
[01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:14.610]  And in the process, you've got a lot of people that are reacting based on emotion
[01:23:14.610 --> 01:23:16.610]  and really upset about this idea.
[01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:19.610]  But in a sense, by reacting through anger and being upset,
[01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:22.610]  you're already reinforcing his view of reality.
[01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:27.610]  What we should be doing is laughing our asses off at this guy.
[01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:29.610]  We should be laughing at him.
[01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:32.610]  Oh, you really think that everybody's going to wear uniforms, eat bugs,
[01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:35.610]  live in 15-minute cities, and own nothing and like it?
[01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.610]  Yeah, good luck with that, buddy.
[01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:39.610]  Good luck with that.
[01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:43.610]  And so now let's talk really quick because this does kind of play
[01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:45.610]  into the World Economic Forum, the Bilderberg Group,
[01:23:45.610 --> 01:23:49.610]  and things like the Council on Foreign Relations, the IMF, and stuff like that.
[01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:54.610]  So all of our capital buildings here in the United States
[01:23:54.610 --> 01:23:58.610]  and probably all over the world, but especially in Washington, D.C.,
[01:23:58.610 --> 01:24:00.610]  but all of the capital buildings in the United States
[01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:03.610]  are all built on electromagnetic ley lines.
[01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:06.610]  These are electromagnetic lines that are on the Earth.
[01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:08.610]  They run over the surface of the Earth.
[01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:12.610]  They're a manifestation of the electromagnetic field that surrounds the planet
[01:24:12.610 --> 01:24:16.610]  as well as going all the way down to the core of the planet.
[01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:20.610]  So where these things crisscross on the planet itself,
[01:24:20.610 --> 01:24:25.610]  where it is that they intersect, this is where we see things like pyramids,
[01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:30.610]  obelisks, ancient temples, and our modern cities like the Vatican
[01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:34.610]  or the London Palace or Washington, D.C., or state capitals.
[01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:39.610]  Now, what is it that these people are doing in these buildings?
[01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:45.610]  What they are doing is they are using words or code to create law.
[01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:51.610]  Now, the law is telling us what we can buy, what we can sell,
[01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:54.610]  what is legal, what is illegal.
[01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:56.610]  Now, think about that for a second.
[01:24:56.610 --> 01:24:58.610]  That's going to end up affecting what?
[01:24:58.610 --> 01:25:01.610]  Our thoughts, our emotions, and our behavior.
[01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:08.610]  So in this way, because these less-than-one-percenters have used not only lawfare
[01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:13.610]  but also these buildings that are built on the electromagnetic ley lines of the planet,
[01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:16.610]  they are essentially using these buildings almost like they're circuits in a machine
[01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:19.610]  to control and affect our collective consciousness,
[01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:24.610]  to control and affect our thoughts and our emotions, our hearts, our minds,
[01:25:24.610 --> 01:25:28.610]  and therefore, in one way or another, kind of attempting to enslave our very soul.
[01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:32.610]  Now, let's talk really quick about how a computer works,
[01:25:32.610 --> 01:25:37.610]  and then we're going to bring it back to this idea of how it is that these capitals
[01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:41.610]  being built on ley lines is like a Trojan horse or a virus in a computer.
[01:25:41.610 --> 01:25:45.610]  So a computer works based on the idea of plugging a computer in
[01:25:45.610 --> 01:25:50.610]  and you're moving electricity through the conductors in the circuit board.
[01:25:50.610 --> 01:25:53.610]  So you plug it into the wall, the electricity goes into the computer,
[01:25:53.610 --> 01:25:56.610]  it goes into these conductors in the circuit board,
[01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:59.610]  and it goes in them over and over and over and over again.
[01:25:59.610 --> 01:26:03.610]  And as it creates that feedback loop going through all these conductors,
[01:26:03.610 --> 01:26:06.610]  going through all these chips, as it goes through it over and over and over again,
[01:26:06.610 --> 01:26:09.610]  it ends up creating a pattern.
[01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:12.610]  Now, that pattern and what that looks like can be affected
[01:26:12.610 --> 01:26:17.610]  or changed through algorithms or mathematics.
[01:26:17.610 --> 01:26:21.610]  And then through the algorithm, you can end up changing the pattern
[01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:25.610]  in that computer and that electrical pattern.
[01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:30.610]  Now, that electrical pattern manifests as ones and zeros, code.
[01:26:30.610 --> 01:26:35.610]  Then those ones and zeros are then placed on the computer screen.
[01:26:35.610 --> 01:26:38.610]  And that's how it is that we are able to work with it,
[01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:42.610]  we are able to change the code based on strokes on a keyboard.
[01:26:42.610 --> 01:26:46.610]  And we'll come back to this notion of computers in a little bit
[01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:48.610]  when we talk about human consciousness.
[01:26:48.610 --> 01:26:52.610]  Now, let's think about how this relates to human civilization
[01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:56.610]  because these capital buildings are built on electromagnetic ley lines
[01:26:56.610 --> 01:26:59.610]  that are channeling the electromagnetic field of the earth,
[01:26:59.610 --> 01:27:02.610]  channeling the energy of the universe,
[01:27:02.610 --> 01:27:05.610]  kind of like the computer is getting electricity from the wall.
[01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:10.610]  And in the process, as they're in these buildings creating this code,
[01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:14.610]  creating this lawfare, what they're doing is they're essentially acting
[01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:20.610]  like a computer virus because what their laws are doing,
[01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:24.610]  what their code is doing is it is reinforcing this death matrix.
[01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:28.610]  Similar to how a virus can get into a computer and change the algorithm
[01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:33.610]  and divert all of the energy that's being moved through the computer
[01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:37.610]  to like 1% of the computer's hardware,
[01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:40.610]  and thus slowing the computer down dramatically.
[01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:43.610]  You can do the same thing with human civilizations.
[01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:47.610]  So what has happened is that these people in these buildings,
[01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:49.610]  they have created really bad code.
[01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:51.610]  They've acted like a Trojan horse or a virus.
[01:27:51.610 --> 01:27:55.610]  And now they're using all of our work, all of our time, all of our energy,
[01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:58.610]  all of our labor, all of our money,
[01:27:58.610 --> 01:28:02.610]  and then they are diverting it to less than 1% of the population.
[01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:08.610]  And they are diverting it to the reinforcement of this illusion of separation.
[01:28:08.610 --> 01:28:12.610]  And in the process, we are destroying the planet.
[01:28:12.610 --> 01:28:17.610]  We are exponentially polluting our ecosystems, our water, our air, our food, our soil.
[01:28:17.610 --> 01:28:22.610]  We are exponentially increasing the amount of negative low-frequency
[01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:27.610]  electromagnetic waves that are just bathing the planet every day.
[01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:29.610]  We are going to war with each other.
[01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:31.610]  There are still children all over the world that are starving.
[01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:34.610]  There are still children all over the world and adults
[01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:38.610]  that are in the human and child sex trafficking slave trade.
[01:28:38.610 --> 01:28:42.610]  We are basically playing the fiddle while Rome burns
[01:28:42.610 --> 01:28:48.610]  as we watch the football game and drink a beer and forget about our problems.
[01:28:48.610 --> 01:28:54.610]  And we're in debt, in some cases, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:28:55.610 --> 01:29:00.610]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[01:29:00.610 --> 01:29:03.610]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:05.610]  So let me get this straight.
[01:29:05.610 --> 01:29:08.610]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document
[01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:10.610]  showing that during the Obama administration,
[01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:13.610]  Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter
[01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:17.610]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption,
[01:29:17.610 --> 01:29:19.610]  an event that Donald Trump looked into,
[01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:22.610]  sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine
[01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:26.610]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[01:29:26.610 --> 01:29:29.610]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop,
[01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:33.610]  which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[01:29:33.610 --> 01:29:36.610]  and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[01:29:36.610 --> 01:29:40.610]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents
[01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:45.610]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016
[01:29:45.610 --> 01:29:48.610]  when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump
[01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:52.610]  using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:54.610]  Do I have that all straight?
[01:30:18.610 --> 01:30:22.610]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:27.610]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:31.610]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:35.610]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:30:35.610 --> 01:30:39.610]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day,
[01:30:39.610 --> 01:30:41.610]  and it helps me with my writing.
[01:30:41.610 --> 01:30:43.610]  All right. We love you. We'll be right back.

[01:31:12.610 --> 01:31:15.610]  a gigantic dose of highest-quality turmeric,

[01:31:57.610 --> 01:32:01.610]  When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground,
[01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:05.610]  you must find a way.
[01:32:05.610 --> 01:32:09.610]  When the darkness descends and you're told it's the end,
[01:32:09.610 --> 01:32:12.610]  you must find a way.
[01:32:12.610 --> 01:32:17.610]  When God decides to look the other way and a clown takes the throne,
[01:32:17.610 --> 01:32:19.610]  we must find a way.
[01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:21.610]  You will find a way.
[01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:24.610]  Dig down and find faith.
[01:32:24.610 --> 01:32:28.610]  When you're close to the edge with a gun to your head,
[01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:31.610]  you must find a way.
[01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:35.610]  We have entered the fray and we will not obey.
[01:32:35.610 --> 01:32:40.610]  We must find a way and find faith.
[01:32:44.610 --> 01:32:47.610]  We won't let them divide.
[01:32:47.610 --> 01:32:49.610]  We will never abide.
[01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:52.610]  We will find a way.
[01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:55.610]  Infowars.com
[01:32:58.350 --> 01:33:03.350]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:05.350]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:21.350]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:24.350]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:31.350]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:48.350]  These individuals in these buildings, they have acted like a Trojan horse of sorts.
[01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:52.350]  They are serving less than 1% of the population.
[01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:55.350]  Now if we go back to this notion of free energy,
[01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:58.490]  energy, Tesla Tower technology, what is that doing?
[01:33:58.490 --> 01:34:04.570]  What that's doing is that it's literally redistributing the power or the energy to the people.
[01:34:04.570 --> 01:34:10.690]  It is creating a whole new decentralized system that will render the old system obsolete,
[01:34:10.690 --> 01:34:15.330]  that will basically get rid of the computer virus and allow the energy that was originally
[01:34:15.330 --> 01:34:21.970]  intended for the whole computer to reach all of the parts, all of the hardware in the computer.
[01:34:21.970 --> 01:34:27.310]  So if our brains and our DNA and our bodies are like hardware or like an antenna sending
[01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:32.650]  and receiving the signal with non-local consciousness, then in one way or another, we are actually
[01:34:32.650 --> 01:34:36.310]  kind of coming back to this idea of manifestation.
[01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:43.810]  We are actually able to stroke the keyboard and affect the matrix, the divine matrix of
[01:34:43.810 --> 01:34:49.230]  reality and through the observer effect, through the power of manifestation, we are able to
[01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:53.250]  manifest realities in the third dimension.
[01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:58.370]  You see, we are hyper-dimensional beings that are able to perceive future timelines.
[01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:03.130]  That's the only way we can get up and walk across the room and get a glass of water.
[01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:06.730]  Because we have the ability to see in our minds the, oh, I'm thirsty, I'm going to go
[01:35:06.730 --> 01:35:07.730]  get water.
[01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:11.690]  So you move your three-dimensional body through the fourth dimension of time to this fifth
[01:35:11.690 --> 01:35:15.850]  dimensional reality that you imagined ten seconds ago where you're thirsty and you went
[01:35:15.850 --> 01:35:17.690]  up and you got some water.
[01:35:17.690 --> 01:35:21.910]  So this is why I bring up this whole thing about Klaus Schwab.
[01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:26.470]  It's the reason why I bring up this whole idea of how they're trying to hijack our minds,
[01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:30.870]  how they're trying to control our thoughts and our emotions, what we may buy, what we
[01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:34.870]  may sell, what's illegal, what's legal, etc.
[01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:40.710]  Because they're intentionally attempting to divert all of our energy, all of our thoughts,
[01:35:40.710 --> 01:35:47.790]  all of our emotions, all of our labor, all of our money, all of our hard work toward
[01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:50.550]  serving them, the less than one percenters.
[01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:52.390]  And they are less than one percent.
[01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:57.050]  And they are trying to use their propaganda machine as a means of controlling our consciousness.
[01:35:57.050 --> 01:36:01.750]  They're trying to use the death matrix as a means of subverting human consciousness.
[01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:06.070]  Because when individuals like yourself, Alex, or myself, or other people, whether it be
[01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:12.550]  Joe Rogan or whoever, start to blow the lid off of the illusions that have been created,
[01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:16.350]  well then you become a threat to the full spectrum dominant system.
[01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:17.350]  You become a threat to-
[01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:18.350]  Absolutely.
[01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:19.590]  And I want you to continue.
[01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:24.230]  This is riveting and totally on target and I totally agree with you.
[01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:27.390]  But let's talk about just the temporal level of the awakening we're seeing.
[01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:30.270]  And I'm not trying to name drop, it doesn't matter, but I talked to, on the phone with
[01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:31.270]  Joe yesterday.
[01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:34.790]  We were talking about the great awakening and how red-pilled he is, and now he totally
[01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:35.790]  sees it.
[01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:36.790]  And he's like, you're right about everything.
[01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:37.790]  I can't believe it.
[01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:38.790]  It's incredible.
[01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:40.030]  And you see that on air.
[01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:43.830]  So he's accelerating his awakening and he's somebody that's not been spiritual because
[01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:46.350]  he's all about what he can prove, what he can see.
[01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:51.910]  Now he's having guests on about God and how God exists and consciousness and good and evil.
[01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:56.550]  And so a lot of Christians will sit there and be what Christ spoke out against.
[01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:59.750]  Like Pharisees, very like, well you're not perfect or you're not that, but there was
[01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:04.750]  Christ with the prostitutes, the money changers, and the tax collectors because they were the
[01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:09.030]  ones that weren't holier than thou that he could actually get the full truth to.
[01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:13.190]  And so that's why my show's been able to wake so many people up that actually find God and
[01:37:13.190 --> 01:37:17.510]  find Christ is because I'm not beating them over the head, I'm not putting on an act like
[01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:20.390]  I'm perfect, but I know this is real.
[01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:26.430]  I've experienced spiritual attack and I know the name of Christ is the most powerful name.
[01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:31.230]  But regardless, this awakening, call it spiritual, whatever you want, is an awakening to the
[01:37:31.230 --> 01:37:36.310]  larger universe and the fact that we only see a very narrow spectrum and hear a very
[01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:41.790]  spectrum and feel a very narrow spectrum physically of what there is, and that obviously they
[01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:45.510]  admit they're trying to keep us shuttered under their control and they're aware of this
[01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:50.310]  knowledge and using it against people to our detriment instead of empowering them, and
[01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:54.310]  that they are very fearful right now and know that we're breaking free.
[01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:59.150]  So they may physically destroy some of us on the front lines, but in the end that is only
[01:37:59.150 --> 01:38:00.150]  accelerating the awakening.
[01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:05.590]  So give me your view on the cultural, economic, political, spiritual level, if this was a
[01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:10.990]  football game or use another analogy if you'd like, Jake, of where we are.
[01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:19.830]  Okay, so you're right when you're saying about like we're perceiving less than 1% of the
[01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:25.450]  electromagnetic spectrum and what these global new world order one world government types
[01:38:25.450 --> 01:38:29.890]  are trying to do, these less than 1%ers, is keep us confined in that less than 1%.
[01:38:29.890 --> 01:38:34.490]  This is part of why I practice shamanism and I believe that Christ was the ultimate shaman.
[01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:40.210]  Okay, so it's about understanding all of this sacred knowledge and using it for good, using
[01:38:40.210 --> 01:38:44.090]  it as a means to create positive timelines, not negative ones.
[01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:50.110]  So if you have these people on these ley lines in these buildings creating lawfare, creating
[01:38:50.110 --> 01:38:55.810]  bad code that is creating negative timelines, then they're essentially hijacking not just
[01:38:55.810 --> 01:39:01.050]  these ley lines, not just the electromagnetic field of the planet, not just the matrix,
[01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:06.410]  the divine matrix by using this bad code, but they're also affecting our minds and keeping
[01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:08.450]  us within this narrow bandwidth.
[01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:14.410]  Now as our consciousness expands, our third eye, our pineal gland is like a pine cone
[01:39:14.410 --> 01:39:19.410]  and it opens and as it opens, so too does our electromagnetic field or our consciousness
[01:39:19.410 --> 01:39:21.610]  field expand beyond our bodies.
[01:39:21.610 --> 01:39:25.290]  That's why David Icke, when he was in Peru and had that psychic experience and got the
[01:39:25.290 --> 01:39:27.250]  downloads, it was like the top of his head blew off.
[01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:31.770]  The same thing happened to me several times in my life, but the biggest one was when I
[01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:35.690]  was on air about two years, I've been on air about 27 years, and it was like the top of
[01:39:35.690 --> 01:39:41.850]  my head blew off, or it's like that Gnarls Barkley song about once he goes crazy, there's
[01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:43.930]  such a big echo and so much space.
[01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:47.890]  It's like you've been here and it goes, right.
[01:39:47.890 --> 01:39:52.730]  You realize your infinite eternal self, you become one with all things.
[01:39:52.730 --> 01:39:58.490]  And when you're in that state of consciousness, an enlightened person is not a profitable person
[01:39:58.490 --> 01:39:59.490]  because guess what?
[01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:01.650]  They don't care about material possessions.
[01:40:01.650 --> 01:40:04.570]  They care about spiritual wealth.
[01:40:05.490 --> 01:40:09.530]  If you don't care about making a dollar, but you do care about making a difference, then
[01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:13.370]  it's really hard for these less than one percenters to control you.
[01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:18.570]  That's why I have taken the position that I have on this notion of monetary gain regarding
[01:40:18.570 --> 01:40:21.050]  a lot of things in my life.
[01:40:21.050 --> 01:40:26.330]  Because if you put money first as opposed to God first, then you end up worshiping the
[01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:27.330]  wrong master.
[01:40:27.330 --> 01:40:30.450]  I totally agree with you, but I want to talk about balance to this.
[01:40:30.450 --> 01:40:33.210]  This is really an important point that I never get into.
[01:40:33.210 --> 01:40:37.890]  I never even cared about money until I realized it was a symbol of energy to be able to do
[01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:38.890]  what I want.
[01:40:38.890 --> 01:40:43.610]  But if I can be controlled as if it is the highest thing on my hierarchy of needs and
[01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:47.130]  then I'll just simply sell out for that, then it's a bad thing.
[01:40:47.130 --> 01:40:51.650]  But if I don't sell out, do the right thing, and then accumulate wealth to help others and
[01:40:51.650 --> 01:40:56.690]  build up systems outside the enemy because they want to keep us poor and control us, then
[01:40:56.690 --> 01:41:01.130]  that puts the physical third dimension together with the higher dimensions and now we can
[01:41:01.130 --> 01:41:02.130]  basically do anything.
[01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:05.890]  We can't just like Oprah Winfrey imagine something and then manifest a nuclear reactor
[01:41:05.890 --> 01:41:10.890]  or manifest a jet airplane or manifest a Beethoven symphony.
[01:41:10.890 --> 01:41:15.810]  There's got to be a lot that his ancestors, his training, the building, his connection,
[01:41:15.810 --> 01:41:20.970]  becoming deaf and going to the next level of actually hearing vibrationally to then take
[01:41:20.970 --> 01:41:21.970]  it to another dimension.
[01:41:21.970 --> 01:41:26.330]  So there's got to be all the pieces there, but then we have the pieces now and are at
[01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:27.970]  this historic jump point.
[01:41:27.970 --> 01:41:31.250]  So you get my point about we shouldn't run from resources.
[01:41:31.370 --> 01:41:35.810]  We should create our own systems and develop resources, not for the worship of resources,
[01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:38.930]  but for the use of them in building a better world.
[01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:39.930]  Absolutely.
[01:41:39.930 --> 01:41:45.130]  And that's why I advocate so heavily for Tesla Tower technology and Dr. Reif and his machine
[01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:50.410]  because if we look into what will happen when we create these Tesla Towers, number one,
[01:41:50.410 --> 01:41:52.530]  we'll create a decentralized energy grid.
[01:41:52.530 --> 01:41:55.390]  Number two, we'll create a decentralized communication grid.
[01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:58.530]  Number three, we'll end up being able to influence agriculture.
[01:41:58.530 --> 01:42:01.970]  We'll be able to clean up the pollution and the geoengineering.
[01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:06.930]  We will be able to use these electromagnetic ley lines in these towers to create a new
[01:42:06.930 --> 01:42:10.170]  supply chain and a new transportation grid.
[01:42:10.170 --> 01:42:14.130]  We will also revolutionize medicine if we use Dr. Reif's machine.
[01:42:14.130 --> 01:42:15.130]  Well, let me raise that point.
[01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:17.490]  So we have to create a new system.
[01:42:17.490 --> 01:42:20.650]  Plato, who everything, most of what he says has been found to be true.
[01:42:20.650 --> 01:42:23.370]  He was a philosopher and historian, the father of it.
[01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:28.030]  He said Atlantis was real and they had towers and a power that let flying machines go everywhere,
[01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:30.150]  but it blew up from your deep research.
[01:42:30.150 --> 01:42:31.150]  What do you think?
[01:42:31.150 --> 01:42:36.550]  Did Atlantis exist or was it a psychic peeing into the future that we're building in Atlantis
[01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:38.190]  that's dangerous?
[01:42:38.190 --> 01:42:43.150]  No, what I think happened with Atlantis, and if you look into the work of Graham Hancock
[01:42:43.150 --> 01:42:47.470]  and his book, Magicians are the Gods, and all of his other research, then you will find
[01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:52.630]  that off of the out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and out in the middle of the Pacific
[01:42:52.630 --> 01:42:58.390]  Ocean, I say, because there was so much ice and water up near the North Pole.
[01:42:58.390 --> 01:43:05.470]  I beg you to think about how important your word of mouth is and you sharing the articles
[01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:08.950]  and sharing the videos and telling people, get the forbidden truth you're not supposed
[01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:15.590]  to find at InfoWars.com forward slash show and getting products at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:07.150]  book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future, that is the
[01:44:07.150 --> 01:44:08.150]  hellish future.
[01:44:08.150 --> 01:44:11.950]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:15.990]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:17.870]  Amazon, or InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:25.990]  we got run out, and there's about 1,000 left of them right now.

[01:44:44.670 --> 01:44:49.990]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a signed
[01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:54.190]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to
[01:44:54.190 --> 01:44:55.190]  the local school.
[01:44:55.190 --> 01:44:58.550]  This is an InfoWar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[01:44:58.550 --> 01:45:03.270]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G
[01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:04.990]  or the GMO crops.
[01:45:04.990 --> 01:45:09.830]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:11.390]  industry to use.
[01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:14.750]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:18.430]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[01:45:18.430 --> 01:45:23.990]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.990]  Look it up.
[01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:26.370]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:45:26.370 --> 01:45:29.590]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:34.190]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors, the Alexa Pure, ready to ship
[01:45:34.190 --> 01:45:35.190]  to you right now.
[01:45:35.190 --> 01:45:37.310]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:39.270]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:40.270]  It is amazing.
[01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:41.870]  It's great for your home, your business.
[01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:45.070]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:46.550]  Almost everything's contaminated.
[01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:50.590]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[01:45:50.590 --> 01:45:52.310]  Get yours today at InfoWarStore.com.

[01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:56.950]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:57.950]  You need this filter.
[01:45:57.950 --> 01:46:02.990]  InfoWarStore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:05.030]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:08.670]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you, so I get constant questions online
[01:46:08.670 --> 01:46:09.670]  and in person.
[01:46:09.670 --> 01:46:10.670]  Hey, what's better?
[01:46:10.670 --> 01:46:11.670]  Knockout.
[01:46:11.670 --> 01:46:12.670]  What's better?
[01:46:12.670 --> 01:46:13.670]  Down and out.
[01:46:13.670 --> 01:46:14.670]  What's better?
[01:46:14.670 --> 01:46:15.670]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:46:15.670 --> 01:46:22.230]  The answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:46:22.230 --> 01:46:25.790]  One person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:26.990]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.990]  They're all very diverse.
[01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:32.550]  We've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years
[01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:39.230]  that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.

[01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:49.390]  sleep and it's in stock available right now of 25% off out of the gates.

[01:47:00.110 --> 01:47:15.070]  Off of the, out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and out in the middle of the Pacific
[01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:20.070]  Ocean during the Ice Age because there was so much ice and water up near the North Pole,
[01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:24.630]  there was so much more land exposed.
[01:47:24.630 --> 01:47:29.750]  And when a comet broke up in outer space and smashed into the ice sheet, it created literally
[01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:34.990]  oceans worth of water, not just dumping all over the surface of the planet, but also
[01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:43.470]  shooting millions upon millions of gallons of not just water, but soot and mud up into
[01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:44.470]  the upper atmosphere.
[01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:46.590]  And this is where we get into things like black rain and stuff like that.
[01:47:46.590 --> 01:47:51.550]  Now, the reason why I think this happened is because Atlantis was almost like at the
[01:47:51.550 --> 01:47:55.270]  end of a golden age of sorts.
[01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:59.670]  It was when all this sacred knowledge began to become perverted.
[01:47:59.670 --> 01:48:04.310]  So they understood the ley lines, they understood the power of thought and emotion, they understood
[01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:09.110]  the power and the role of energy, frequency, and vibration in human civilization.
[01:48:09.110 --> 01:48:14.190]  And they created a society that was based on embodying this divine truth.
[01:48:14.190 --> 01:48:19.750]  But eventually what ended up happening is that it became, it fell to priestcraft.
[01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:23.230]  And then they started doing things like child and human sacrifice.
[01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:27.870]  And this isn't, I don't think this is in Graham Hancock's book, but this is my contention.
[01:48:27.870 --> 01:48:31.990]  This is what I've come to believe, that they ended up doing things like child and human
[01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:36.950]  sacrifice at these sacred sites, at these pyramids, on the ley lines, and they were
[01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:42.950]  doing it so heavily that it ended up creating such a low frequency state of fear and pain
[01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:49.510]  and suffering on the planet that their karma came back to bite them in the ass.
[01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:54.390]  And this comet slammed into the ice sheet and just wiped everything clean.
[01:48:54.710 --> 01:48:58.430]  And we are like the inheritors of this lost civilization.
[01:48:58.430 --> 01:49:02.910]  That's why we look around us and we see all these massive buildings like the pyramids,
[01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:05.630]  like not just in Egypt, but like in China or in Bosnia.
[01:49:05.630 --> 01:49:06.630]  They're everywhere.
[01:49:06.630 --> 01:49:09.230]  And also we have an epigenetic memory.
[01:49:09.230 --> 01:49:13.030]  When we see all the technology or see science fiction, it does, it seems like we're home.
[01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:15.470]  It's like, well, I know this.
[01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:16.870]  Yes.
[01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:21.830]  So what happened is that they got to a point where they started to worship themselves and
[01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:22.910]  not God.
[01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:29.230]  They got to a point to where they were attempting to use this knowledge for power, for themselves,
[01:49:29.230 --> 01:49:31.650]  for selfish reasons and purposes.
[01:49:31.650 --> 01:49:37.270]  And in the process, their karma ended up coming back at them and it just wiped everything
[01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:39.150]  clean and we had to start over.
[01:49:39.150 --> 01:49:42.150]  I mean, if you look in the Mahabharata, you don't think it was some type of free energy
[01:49:42.150 --> 01:49:44.230]  machine exploding or a war.
[01:49:44.230 --> 01:49:46.230]  From your research, you think it was a comet?
[01:49:46.230 --> 01:49:50.430]  Oh yeah, I'm quite certain it was a comet and it happened twice.
[01:49:50.430 --> 01:49:52.350]  It happened in the span of 2000 years.
[01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:56.310]  It happened once, I think, 12,000 years ago, right around the time that Gobekli Tepe was
[01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:58.590]  made and buried.
[01:49:58.590 --> 01:50:02.310]  And then it happened again another thousand years later.
[01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:05.310]  And so it just reset everything.
[01:50:05.310 --> 01:50:09.230]  And if you, like I said, look, just look into the work of Graham Hancock and you will be
[01:50:09.230 --> 01:50:11.070]  amazed at the things that he's uncovered.
[01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:16.190]  Sure, what ancient culture do you think has the most accurate history analysis of what
[01:50:16.190 --> 01:50:17.190]  happened?
[01:50:17.190 --> 01:50:21.230]  What do you mean during the flood?
[01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:26.670]  Well, just of the cultures we know of, of the Egyptians, the Babylonians, the folks
[01:50:26.670 --> 01:50:29.710]  that were in Babylon, of all those groups, which one from the history you think is the
[01:50:29.710 --> 01:50:30.710]  most accurate?
[01:50:32.190 --> 01:50:36.390]  Well, they all kind of are saying the same thing, and what I found is that it's kind
[01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:37.710]  of like the telephone game.
[01:50:37.710 --> 01:50:41.950]  As they go throughout history, the story changes just a little bit and then ends up
[01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:44.350]  getting more and more distorted as time goes on.
[01:50:45.230 --> 01:50:49.910]  I would say that if you look into all shamanic cultures all over the planet, whether it be
[01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:54.990]  the aborigines in Australia, the Native Americans here in the United States, whether it be
[01:50:54.990 --> 01:51:00.910]  the ancient Mongolians or the Africans, the Europeans, they all have stories of the
[01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:06.270]  flood. They all have stories of the flood and they all have their own.
[01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:11.710]  It all kind of actually comes down to this idea that God decided to save one man or one
[01:51:11.710 --> 01:51:14.630]  family and allow them to repopulate the earth.
[01:51:14.630 --> 01:51:17.150]  So I think that.
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:26.840]  I think that the truth about reality and the spiritual nature to our existence has been
[01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:28.880]  known for millennia.
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:35.880]  But it has been kept to a very tightly knit group of quote unquote elite families or royal
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:37.800]  families and bloodlines.
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:41.840]  And this is the knowledge that they are trying to keep from dispensing to the public.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:45.400]  These are the floodgates they're trying to hold back because coming back to this idea
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:49.240]  of collective consciousness and energy frequency and vibration.
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:54.480]  Once this knowledge makes its way into the collective consciousness stream, then the
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:58.840]  death matrix dissolves, that there's nothing that they can do.
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:01.960]  There's nothing that they can that nothing can stop what's coming.
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:06.880]  It's like a global flood of sorts, except it's like what Jesus said about the wisdom
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:10.400]  of God will fill the land as water fills the sea.
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:15.519]  The lion will lie down with the lamb and there will be no more killing or destroying.
[01:52:15.519 --> 01:52:17.480]  And that is, I think, what he saw.
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:21.639]  He saw the future, man, you know, and I believe that is coming.
[01:52:21.639 --> 01:52:24.920]  I believe we are creating a new heaven on earth as we speak.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:28.519]  This is the most exciting time we possibly could have picked to be alive.
[01:52:28.519 --> 01:52:31.480]  The ancients pointed to this time as like, I want to be alive right there.
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:35.820]  I want to see what's going to happen there because we're coming out of this very dark
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:41.700]  night of the collective soul and into a collective awakening, into an awakening to all this stuff
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:47.340]  that has been suppressed for millennia and has been kept for a very specific group of
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:48.660]  families.
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:52.860]  And that's why they go after people that are exposing these these truths.
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:55.220]  Keep going.
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:57.580]  Okay, sure.
[01:52:57.580 --> 01:53:01.300]  So look at it like this.
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:06.580]  If human beings are the grains of rice on the speaker and the electromagnetic field
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:13.780]  around the earth is the speaker, I mean, is the frequency of the speaker, then that electromagnetic
[01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:18.260]  field around the earth is actually connected to all of the planets in the solar system
[01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:20.540]  and the electromagnetic field of the sun.
[01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:24.019]  Now this comes into this idea of Saturn, okay?
[01:53:24.019 --> 01:53:28.220]  And Saturn is a very strong presence, though it is not the strongest presence in the solar
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:31.179]  system, but it is a very strong presence.
[01:53:31.179 --> 01:53:40.099]  Now through symbolism, right, we have been inundated with symbols for Saturn.
[01:53:40.099 --> 01:53:45.420]  And based on this idea of like what I was saying before about the multidimensional nature
[01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:50.900]  to our consciousness, what they are attempting to do is they are attempting to use the cymatic
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:57.420]  frequency of Saturn almost like a metaphysical prison wall to confine our minds, to confine
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:54:02.980]  our souls, and in one way or another affect the frequency of planet earth.
[01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:08.420]  Because as we are all tuned into the Saturnian frequency, we are actually feeding the Saturnian
[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:11.099]  frequency with our hearts and with our minds.
[01:54:11.099 --> 01:54:15.460]  And if these people that worship Saturn are the ones in control of the legal system, they
[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:21.340]  are the ones that are creating all this parasitism, dominance, war, predation, chaos, famine, disease,
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:28.420]  et cetera, then they believe, these satanists or saturnists, these saturnists, they believe
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:35.540]  that all of that pain, chaos, death, suffering, disease, famine, all of that is going to Saturn.
[01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:39.139]  It's all going to feed Satan, okay?
[01:54:39.139 --> 01:54:42.139]  It is a sacrifice to Satan, all right?
[01:54:42.139 --> 01:54:45.099]  And same thing with like the testimony of Zachary King.
[01:54:45.099 --> 01:54:46.900]  And let's go forward with this.
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:52.980]  The Romans worship Saturn and a bunch of other gods, but that was their basic Satan cult.
[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:57.540]  And if you study what the globalists think today, they believe the planets, especially
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:55:01.460]  the gas giants, are interdimensional portals to which they send the energy.
[01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:06.660]  So they see Saturn not just as a god, but as a jump point.
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:08.380]  Yes.
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:13.740]  So all of these planets are in one way or another cymatic vortexes of energy that are
[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:21.179]  a field around them that is creating a very specific pattern, a cymatic pattern in space
[01:55:21.179 --> 01:55:22.179]  and time.
[01:55:22.179 --> 01:55:25.740]  So basically the planets are like different keys on a piano, and they're just hitting
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:31.420]  the Satan panel constantly, just boop, boop, boop, they're just hitting that tone.
[01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:32.420]  Yes.
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:33.420]  Correct.
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:36.500]  And it's a very low frequency tone.
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:38.460]  It's a very low frequency tone.
[01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:44.900]  Now, Jupiter, Jupiter is a very high frequency, and it's actually completely the opposite
[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:45.900]  of Saturn.
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:52.099]  Saturn is Kronos, Kronos eats his children, and Jupiter is Zeus.
[01:55:52.099 --> 01:55:58.940]  And Zeus helped to basically rally the gods to defeat Saturn, to defeat Kronos.
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:05.420]  OK, so when we look at ancient mythology, we can actually find that they understood
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:08.380]  this interdimensional stuff quite well.
[01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:13.059]  And when we get into this notion of cymatic frequencies and the downloading of information
[01:56:13.059 --> 01:56:20.780]  into the planet, and this information encoding the electromagnetic field of the planet itself
[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:25.099]  with data that we can then branch to in space and time, otherwise we wouldn't be able to
[01:56:25.099 --> 01:56:26.099]  create reality.
[01:56:26.099 --> 01:56:31.740]  So it's almost like the Earth is like a massive supercomputer, a massive supercomputer of
[01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:37.059]  sorts that is downloading massive amounts of information that we can then use and channel
[01:56:37.059 --> 01:56:42.700]  through our bodies to create specific realities within that space-time paradigm.
[01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:43.700]  What is the Sun in this?
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:47.500]  Because again, Earth is the third planet out, symbolizing third dimension.
[01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:52.760]  You've got Venus, you know, second dimension, the most base of life, then you've got Mercury
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:54.900]  that's actually just the matter.
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:57.019]  What does the Sun symbolize?
[01:56:57.019 --> 01:57:05.620]  Well, in my opinion, the Sun symbolizes the love of God, the, almost like the, the, the
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:06.620]  great...
[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:08.180]  That's right.
[01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:11.980]  We don't worship the Sun, but it's a symbol of God giving us energy and warmth and light.
[01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:14.580]  Yes, exactly, 100%.
[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:15.580]  And what does it say in the Bible?
[01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:20.860]  You know, that God shines Sun, the sunlight on the wicked and the just alike.
[01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:24.139]  Well the first thing God says is he looks at the darkness and he says, let there be
[01:57:24.139 --> 01:57:25.420]  light.
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:28.860]  Let there be light, yes.
[01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:35.340]  So if we look at each of these buildings that are built on these ley lines as though they
[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:42.099]  have a satanic pentagram over them and that within the satanic pentagram is massive amounts
[01:57:42.099 --> 01:57:48.340]  of energy from the earth being drained into like a low frequency portal.
[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:52.940]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves and
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.260]  the big event coming up.
[01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:59.500]  Well, yeah, let's, the first one, you obviously can go to mypillow.com, use that promo code
[01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:04.180]  Alex, and you can get all these great discounts on all of our products.

[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:14.340]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20 year anniversary MyPillow for
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:18.820]  1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:23.860]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love to invest, producing and
[01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:25.620]  making the MyPillow.
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:32.740]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how, using the money for Americana
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:35.219]  freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[01:58:35.219 --> 01:58:36.700]  That's what the debanking is about.
[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:38.500]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:43.260]  That's why we've got a rush to support mypillow.com and infowars.com plus their great products
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:48.300]  at both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:54.580]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:55.580]  the atmosphere.
[01:58:55.580 --> 01:58:58.500]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:58:58.500 --> 01:59:04.820]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:09.300]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:14.059]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to
[01:59:14.059 --> 01:59:15.180]  dispose of it.
[01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:20.099]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury who
[01:59:20.099 --> 01:59:23.620]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:30.139]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[01:59:30.139 --> 01:59:32.500]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:37.780]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:43.700]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:46.860]  Available now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:56.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
