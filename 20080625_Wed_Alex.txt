[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  News, politics, politics, politics, politics, politics,
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.000]  Government Cover-Ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:53.000 --> 01:01.000]  Welcome, my friends, to the world's mission against tyranny and defense of human liberty.
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.000]  It is the 26th, 25th day of June, 2008.
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.000]  Again, it is the 25th day of June, 2008.
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  We've got FreedomWorks, Max Pappas joining us, Director of Public Policy.
[01:27.000 --> 01:36.000]  They've been exposing the legislation that is in the housing bill,
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.000]  as opposed to housing relief, a subprime crisis bill that is deepening.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  In there, there's a system to track and trace all internet purchases,
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  all internet transactions by law, and they don't even allow you to report on yourself
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  and violate your Fifth and Fourth Amendment.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  They just forcibly come in and do it.
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  They didn't even do that in East Germany.
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  This is just absolute, total, complete Big Brother.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  And it's not just over the internet.
[02:05.000 --> 02:06.000]  It's going to be all businesses.
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  Instant hookup to the government.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  And the power to track is the power to tax and destroy.
[02:15.000 --> 02:22.000]  And they admit it's for massive national sales tax and internet sales tax and control.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  So FreedomWorks, Max Pappas, Director of Public Policy joining us.
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  They say the bills on the verge of passing the Senate today, it's passed the House.
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  Kevin Ryan and Richard Gage.
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  Kevin Ryan, of course, worked at Underwriter Laboratories, the building,
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  buildings one, two, and seven.
[02:41.000 --> 02:42.000]  They did the underwriting on those.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  He saw internal secret reports that fire and couldn't have brought the buildings down.
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  They did internal models with steel structures and found it was impossible.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  And he leaked the report and was subsequently fired.
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  A NIST report has been leaked.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  A detailed multi-hundred page NIST report has been leaked.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  And we'll talk to Kevin Ryan and Richard Gage about the authenticity of that.
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  Of course, Richard Gage, the head of Architects and Engineers for 9-Eleven Truth.
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  That's coming up in two hours.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  And then Kevin Booth to talk more about the drug war, the war against liberty and freedom,
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  how the drug dealers bring the drugs in and then put us in their private prisons
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  for using their products and bust their lower level competition.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  The ultimate business where they get you coming and going
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  and get to corrupt all the police in the process.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  I'm going to try to do all four hours today.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  I have a lot of business I have to do today after the show, but I may have to cut that short.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  I'm not whining, but when it rains, it pours.
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  I threw my back out last week, digging holes to plant some little trees in my backyard.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  I'm just out of shape.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  And then, of course, about three weeks ago, I hit my shin real hard on the Supreme Court building.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  When a cop jumped out of the shadows at us, I turned around and ran into it
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  and cut it open to the bone.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  It bled while the bone's infected.
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  I woke up to a scruffulous explosion in the bed last night
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  where the pus was all over the bed and now it's running out of my leg right now.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  It's extremely painful.
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  I haven't even had time to take any aspirin yet.
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  I have to eat first.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  I've been working since early this morning.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  I've been able to eat first before I can take some Tylenol.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  So I'm a little bit out of it.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  I'm literally bitten by the Supreme Court marble.
[04:32.000 --> 04:42.000]  I've never had a rothole or a cyst, I guess you'd call it, into bone before.
[04:42.000 --> 04:48.000]  It is extremely painful.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  I guess, in a way, pain is just another sensation.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  It just keeps distracting me as I talk here.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  Hence, I didn't get the date right and said it was the 26th.
[04:59.000 --> 05:02.000]  I'm a mess, I guess.
[05:02.000 --> 05:03.000]  All right.
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.000]  When we come back, the news is all off the chart.
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  I'm going to run through all of it for this hour.
[05:07.000 --> 05:15.000]  Then all of our big guests today as we continue to try to mobilize and awaken the population.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:17.000 --> 05:24.000]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[05:24.000 --> 05:31.000]  Stay with us.
[06:00.000 --> 06:04.000]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[06:04.000 --> 06:10.000]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[06:10.000 --> 06:18.000]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[06:18.000 --> 06:24.000]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com.
[06:24.000 --> 06:35.000]  Call 800-409-5633.

[06:40.000 --> 06:45.000]  even while traveling, camping, at sporting events or in emergency situations.
[06:45.000 --> 06:52.000]  The Berkey Light removes bacteria, cysts, parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  It reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, yet leaves in the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[06:58.000 --> 07:04.000]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote sources.
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  The optional PF2 filter even removes fluoride.
[07:07.000 --> 07:14.000]  The Berkey Light has a rechargeable LED lighting system and an elevated base for use in places other than a countertop.
[07:14.000 --> 07:20.000]  To get your Berkey system, please visit WeThePeople Radio Network at WTPRN.com

[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  Everything is accelerating.
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  There is a quickening taking place.
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  The Supreme Court rejects death penalty for raping children.
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  Now, a lot of people are saying, oh, that's terrible.
[09:08.000 --> 09:19.000]  Well, no, that means if you're 18 and your girlfriend's 17, you will be executed because that statutory rape, the way that a state was trying to pass a law.
[09:19.000 --> 09:28.000]  And I'm all for the death penalty for murderers, but you can't trust a criminal government that's been caught framing around half the people on death row.
[09:28.000 --> 09:40.000]  See, the government's so bankrupt, so evil, caught, so red-handed, knowingly framing hundreds of thousands of people in murder cases over the last 100 years, that you can't trust.
[09:40.000 --> 09:41.000]  You understand?
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  They're totally bankrupt.
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  I mean, if God was meeting out the death penalties, I'd be all for it.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  They cut a judgment for Exxon Valdez disaster.
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  The Supreme Court has announced that they will announce tomorrow or Thursday.
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  It's like Aaron Zellman was right.
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.000]  The Supreme Court is meeting to issue opinions in some of seven cases.
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  It is yet to decide.
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  There's 100-plus cases, and they're saying the last one's going to be the guns.
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  They like to mead them out.
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  They already decided months ago to have maximum effect in the media.
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.000]  Major cases still unsolved include the ban on handguns in Washington, D.C.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  It's all guns, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  Whether people convicted of raping children can be given the death penalty.
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  That's now been announced.
[10:26.000 --> 10:33.000]  So they're now saying that tomorrow, the court is saying they will release that tomorrow.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  And I'm on the Supreme Court newswire, the newswire they put out right now.
[10:39.000 --> 10:50.000]  Okay, that said, funny how all these fake conservatives are calling for executing child molesters
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  when most of them are child molesters, literally.
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.000]  I mean, how many congressmen, how many senators, how many Homeland Security deputy directors?
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  It's a child raping guild.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  You don't get into the club unless you're a pedophile at that level.
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  Remember, we told you that over a decade ago, and now it's mainstream news.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  I mean, it's every day it comes out.
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  These are hardcore criminals.
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.000]  This is a criminal, sicko syndicate.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  You study Rome, you study Egypt, you study Greece.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  They always had child raping cults that seemed to get into power.
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  And then society always fell apart and then people would become pious again and straight-laced.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  And then within a few decades, sometimes a few hundred years,
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  it would degenerate into child raping and killing cults.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  They also like to, I don't want to say what they did in Rome and other places.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  They like to rape them while they're slitting their throats.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  It's basically the deal.
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  Oh, go read mainstream Roman history.
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  So, and you notice they modeled D.C. off Rome and Greece,
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  and it's, they don't really teach you in the textbooks
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  what a lot of the different kingdoms, little city-states in Greece did.
[11:58.000 --> 12:07.000]  You will learn though, because you're going to live under their black sunshine.
[12:07.000 --> 12:13.000]  You're going to live in a world they see as a paradise, a hell-raiser hell.
[12:13.000 --> 12:19.000]  They're going to show you beauty in their eyes.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  You think evil and skulls and death are cute.
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.000]  They're going to make you drink out of black cups of filth.
[12:26.000 --> 12:33.000]  If they have their way until you vomit up your very soul.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  I can look in their eyes, the demonic gleam.
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  They are seething with Luciferian power.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  Oh, you think I'm crazy.
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  Go read what they all worship, all the master masons.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  They worship Albert Pike.
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  He is their top guy.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  Worship's Lucifer.
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  Said God is Lucifer.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  All the top masons write books on the subject, and then low-leveled masons don't have any idea.
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  They're porch masons or profane masons, and they'll tell you you're a liar.
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.000]  They won't even read the books written by the men, Manly P. Hall and others,
[13:10.000 --> 13:16.000]  hanging up in their Masonic temples.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  All right, I said I'd cover all the news, and I've got about 50 vital stories.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  Let me just read the headlines here.
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  You have to carry on military trials at Guantanamo despite court ruling.
[13:26.000 --> 13:27.000]  The courts say you can't do it.
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.000]  They say we will.
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  Total lawlessness.
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.000]  McCain says only World War III would justify draft, but that's what they're setting up right now.
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  Israeli suicide cop family refute claims that he killed himself.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  I mean, how bizarre.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  Just like I said, everything's happening right now.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  You've got Olmert about to go to jail.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  You've got the Mossad chief, the military totally taking over Israel.
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  You've got him trying to kill Sarkozy.
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.000]  Witnesses are saying there was all sorts of stuff happening.
[13:58.000 --> 14:06.000]  Folks, the world is on a razor's edge right now.
[14:06.000 --> 14:15.000]  Assassination scarver Sarkozy and wife Carla as policeman shoots himself in the head to shards away.
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  Classic mind control.
[14:20.000 --> 14:28.000]  Sometimes if it happens about 20, 30% of the time, depending on the cases, we've seen the studies that have been released that they always have the.
[14:28.000 --> 14:40.000]  Taken out the garbage programming, the disposal programming is what they technically call it, where after the assassin, the program assassin.
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  Shoot the target, they then would superhuman strength cops will try to hold their arms down.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  Nothing can stop them.
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  They shoved the gun in their mouth.
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  And they've been trained over and over to do it under hypnotic drugs, under training, all declassified in the 70s.
[14:57.000 --> 15:08.000]  But with the most hardcore programming, sometimes they won't kill another person and but they will still then revert to killing themselves.
[15:08.000 --> 15:18.000]  Of course, McVeigh was foaming at the mouth, delirious, basically hallucinating when the state police pulled up, the gun was on the dashboard.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  He was saying, you know, get it out, get it out of me.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  It's inside me, the chip, the chip.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  They're trying to make me do it.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  Did he have a chip?
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  I don't know.
[15:26.000 --> 15:27.000]  A lot of times they'll have a compulsion.
[15:27.000 --> 15:34.000]  They'll say under the torture under the electroshock under the PCP LSD while they're on all of it, you know, they will keep in planning that program.
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.000]  Cell phone was out on, he'd gotten the program order to kill himself clearly.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  Jolly and West, of course, was his handler then and after.
[15:43.000 --> 15:51.000]  The father of MKL from Mind Control testified in 77 before Congress, then magically the head of Mind Control is his doctor.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  He didn't carry out the disposal for some reason.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  That's what the evidence point said.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  This guy didn't carry out the hit.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  He engaged in the disposal.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  That's what all the evidence points towards.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  We'll get into that as well.
[16:07.000 --> 16:18.000]  He's just cops blowing their heads off on tarmac in front of Sarkozy.
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.000]  Just like the witnesses said with an earlier Israeli Prime Minister, he didn't.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  The guy that they claim shot him didn't.
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  Of course, they shot him in the car once they got him in, just like Reagan.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  Israel prodding US to attack Iran.
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  This isn't from prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or raw story or Ray McGovern.
[16:37.000 --> 16:45.000]  It's from CBS News.
[16:45.000 --> 16:50.000]  Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen leaves Tuesday night on an overseas trip that will take him to Israel.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  He's going to get his orders.
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  Report CBS News National Security Correspondent David Martin.
[16:55.000 --> 17:00.000]  The trip has been scheduled for some time, but the US officials say it comes.
[17:00.000 --> 17:06.000]  Just as the Israelis are mounting a full court press to give the administration a strike, Iran's nuclear complex.
[17:06.000 --> 17:14.000]  Get ready for $10 a barrel, $10 a gallon, $500 a barrel minimum.
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  I mean, this is just...
[17:18.000 --> 17:25.000]  Oh, I can't tell you driving into work this morning how upset I am in my spirit.
[17:25.000 --> 17:40.000]  I can't tell you how frosty I am, how much earnest I'm in, how sorrowful and sad I am that I can't reach out to people on power trips in the government at the enforcement level who are just going to go down with the ship and help bring us all down with them.
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.000]  God, I can't believe this has to happen.
[17:44.000 --> 17:51.000]  We've got to be totally destroyed and in ruins financially at the bare minimum before you wake up, and then you probably won't either.
[17:51.000 --> 18:05.000]  Senate may pass mortgage aid plan as soon as today, covering that next hour, in it is the total federal takeover of all commerce, basically, where everything is instantly uploaded to the government.
[18:05.000 --> 18:12.000]  It really already is, but they want to... they need to legalize their crimes, kind of like the Pfizer spying.
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.000]  Economy on break of recession, Greenspan says, that's Reuters, that is a sick joke.
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  We've been in recession since the 70s.
[18:20.000 --> 18:33.000]  If you look at the real economic data, and I've had the New York Business School head on, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on, I've had Nobel Prize winners, head of the IMF World Bank, chief economist on, you know who we've had on.
[18:33.000 --> 18:41.000]  We've been in a recession since the 60s, since the late 60s, early 70s, you can debate it.
[18:41.000 --> 18:59.000]  You know, if a recession is really two quarters of slowing growth, well, look, the growth was used to be 6, 7, 8, 9, 10% until the late 60s, early 70s.
[18:59.000 --> 19:10.000]  Now it's 3%, but then they claim inflation's 2%, when it's been more like 10 for decades, 10% a year.
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.000]  So if you're getting a 3% growth in a good year, they call that booming.
[19:14.000 --> 19:25.000]  But you've got a 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10% inflation a year, now it's conservatively 15 a year, compounded.
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  So there's not much more that can be taken out of the dollar.
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  There's not much more inflation there that is possible.
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  Do you understand that?
[19:32.000 --> 19:39.000]  It's kind of like a glass, and there's 12 months in it, 12 sips, and we're down to the last three sips.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  And every year, they take out another sip.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  Three years, no value in the money.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  Do you understand?
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  Less than three now.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  I'm here on the deck of the ship.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  It's taken on water.
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  I don't captain anything.
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  You don't captain anything.
[19:55.000 --> 19:59.000]  There's psychos running in the helm, giggling at us.
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  We're saying we've got to do something.
[20:00.000 --> 20:07.000]  And they've ordered the guard to run up with guns and quarter us at the front of the ship with guns to our heads.
[20:07.000 --> 20:11.000]  Well, they rampage forward as the ship's listing about to tumble over.
[20:11.000 --> 20:15.000]  Yup, these are giggling and snickering on the deck.
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.000]  Oh, God.
[20:17.000 --> 20:18.000]  Oh, God.
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.000]  Wait till I get to the other news, folks.
[20:20.000 --> 20:25.000]  It is just, it is just full court press, classical tyranny at every level.
[20:25.000 --> 20:31.000]  Stay with us.
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.000]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[20:45.000 --> 20:49.000]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system,
[20:49.000 --> 20:54.000]  protect a complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition,
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  improving mileage in only one tank full.
[20:56.000 --> 21:01.000]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[21:05.000 --> 21:10.000]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95, and receive a free engine treatment,
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  which is a $12.95 value free.
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  Call triple eight, use SFR1.
[21:15.000 --> 21:22.000]  That number again is triple eight, use SFR1, or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000]  Satisfaction is guaranteed, or your money back, and it's safe for all cars.
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  Act now.
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[21:52.000 --> 21:59.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[21:59.000 --> 22:05.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.000]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  They're after power, that's their after easy.

[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement. You have been warned.
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[22:35.000 --> 22:40.000]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999,
[22:40.000 --> 22:47.000]  making a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  The US economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  called the Federal Reserve System.
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.000]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  It's bad enough that the US citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.000]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[38:36.000 --> 38:42.000]  We do not do that. We get warrants. And we are here to take good care of you.
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  And then it comes out they're listening to everybody, non-terror related.
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.000]  And then the media gets up and lies to the public and says it's only when Bin Laden calls the US do we listen.
[38:51.000 --> 38:56.000]  And then it comes out, of course, they're listening to everybody.
[38:56.000 --> 39:02.000]  It's almost pointless. You're just going to have to have everything you have taken away from you.
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.000]  You're going to have to have a bootstomp on your face and learn what it's like.
[39:07.000 --> 39:15.000]  The cops are going to have to lose their bass boats and see their family get arrested and see their family commit suicide over not having any money.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  And they're just going to have to see America go down completely.
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  And then they won't care most of them as long as they're on top the pile of dung, they don't care.
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  As long as they're sitting up on the pile of rotting America, they're happy.
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  The bureaucrats love it. All the scum just loves it.
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  I'm in a really bad mood right now. Let me start over.
[39:35.000 --> 39:42.000]  Watching the destruction of this country is a very, very painful thing for me.
[39:42.000 --> 39:52.000]  Watching the world slide into a new dark age is very upsetting.
[39:52.000 --> 40:10.000]  Do you know what it means as a society when the Congress can't even get the continuity of government plans,
[40:10.000 --> 40:18.000]  their highest level committees that are co-equal with the president, can't get the martial law plans?
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.000]  Now, the White House published parts of it and says he's a dictator and martial law and put Americans in camps.
[40:23.000 --> 40:34.000]  I mean, it says it in PDD 51, John Warren Defense Authorization Act, Military Commissions Act.
[40:34.000 --> 40:40.000]  Do you know what it means when they just stand by while that happens?
[40:40.000 --> 40:53.000]  Do you know what it means when the White House and the Justice Department write memos to the military ordering them to torture children sexually with pliers, small children,
[40:53.000 --> 41:01.000]  and when that is universally defended on so-called conservative talk radio as somehow a virtue?
[41:01.000 --> 41:09.000]  That is a psychopathic test you've been given because if you will accept the mutilation and torture of small children, you will accept anything.
[41:09.000 --> 41:15.000]  And the mere fact that I am the radical because I am against that shows us what we have become.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  We lied to ourselves about 50 million abortions.
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  We lied to ourselves about big government violating our rights and liberties.
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  We lied to ourselves about all the lies that the media and government have been caught and say, oh, it doesn't matter.
[41:27.000 --> 41:36.000]  Oh, it does matter because we've created a climate where the most evil people in private business, in corporations, in government, in religion
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.000]  have gotten in all the major power positions and they're bored, folks.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  Evil people like killing.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  They like blowing cities up.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  They like releasing bio weapons.
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  They like putting poison in your water.
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  They like hurting you.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  That's their entertainment.
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  That's their nature.
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  They like pushing the envelope.
[41:56.000 --> 42:03.000]  And for a normal person who has discovered what has happened, it is extremely upsetting.
[42:03.000 --> 42:24.000]  I mean, earlier I was reading through the stack and the White House says, I'm going to continue with secret trials where torture evidence is admissible
[42:24.000 --> 42:34.000]  and where even if the tribunal says the person's not guilty, the president or any of his designants can overrule that.
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.000]  I mean, even if the kangaroo court, that's secret with torture evidence.
[42:40.000 --> 42:48.000]  I opened up the New York Times Sunday morning and it was a whole front page story.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  Huge article.
[42:50.000 --> 43:01.000]  Legitimizing torture and saying basically that it's a good thing.
[43:01.000 --> 43:11.000]  And the first line in the story said, hey, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has confessed he is the guy that carried it out.
[43:11.000 --> 43:17.000]  And then the next paragraph says they tortured him and threatened his kids and they're going to say that's good.
[43:17.000 --> 43:18.000]  That's good.
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  Hey, you've gone under torture.
[43:20.000 --> 43:21.000]  You've gone under waterboarding.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  Now we're going to go after your kids and put them in prison.
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.000]  Little kids, what, five and seven at the time?
[43:28.000 --> 43:35.000]  After four plus years of torture, he started naming buildings that didn't exist when he was arrested, that he bombed and just everything.
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.000]  And the government knew that he knew that those buildings didn't exist when he was arrested.
[43:40.000 --> 43:45.000]  They'd still put it out knowing the public are complete idiots.
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  You know, he said he bombed buildings that were built three years after he was arrested.
[43:49.000 --> 43:56.000]  He said he did it all.
[43:56.000 --> 43:59.000]  And now paying compliance all over the country.
[43:59.000 --> 44:08.000]  If you sit down on a sidewalk during an anti-war rally or an anti-abortion protest at Matter Your Peaceful, cops come up and they break your arm.
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  And the bone sticks out and blood pours out on the ground and they laugh.
[44:11.000 --> 44:16.000]  The after-action reports of cops laughing, hey, did you see when we shot that lady in the face with rubber bullets?
[44:16.000 --> 44:17.000]  She's peaceful.
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  They're pushing him off the street, walking back.
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.000]  She's 50 yards away.
[44:20.000 --> 44:21.000]  They shoot her.
[44:21.000 --> 44:22.000]  Blood pours out.
[44:22.000 --> 44:23.000]  Cuts back hours later to the cop.
[44:23.000 --> 44:24.000]  He goes, wasn't it fun?
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  Did you see a shoot that lady in the face?
[44:26.000 --> 44:27.000]  And they all just cheer.
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  Hey, idiots.
[44:29.000 --> 44:33.000]  When you've got an attitude like that, don't you know there's bigger predators than you?
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.000]  And they're going to give you a good raping too, boy?
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.000]  They're going to give your family a good raping, a good financial raping at least.
[44:40.000 --> 44:45.000]  You have been turned into devils.
[44:45.000 --> 44:49.000]  You have been turned into waiting death squads.
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  Your SWAT teams are death squads.
[44:52.000 --> 44:58.000]  Every day I see where they bust in the wrong house and spray some old lady in the back and then nobody gets in trouble.
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  You kill us with impunity.
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  Well, what comes around goes around.
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  Law of the universe.
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  Why are you alcoholics?
[45:07.000 --> 45:08.000]  Why are you on drugs?
[45:08.000 --> 45:09.000]  Why are you so unhappy?
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.000]  Because you're not a good person.
[45:13.000 --> 45:27.000]  That's why you could repent like Saul of Tarsus who would hunt down political dissidents and murder them and torture them into confessions and then would crucify them.
[45:27.000 --> 45:32.000]  You could have that awakening and realize and then truly be fulfilled.
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  But most of you won't.
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.000]  You are going to be evil until you suck your last breath.
[45:36.000 --> 45:46.000]  Your life is going to be a meaningless fraud.
[45:46.000 --> 45:58.000]  But some of our strongest warriors against tyranny will be and have been people from within the wicked system who are waking up and standing up and being strong.
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  I mean, look at this.
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  We're going to be out military trials at Guantanamo Bay despite federal court ruling.
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.000]  Unprecedented.
[46:09.000 --> 46:21.000]  Hearings for terror suspects before U.S. military tribials in Guantanamo are going ahead despite a Supreme Court ruling that affirmed attainees have a right to challenge their detention in a civilian court.
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  And they admit they don't want any real al-Qaeda.
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  They fly them out.
[46:24.000 --> 46:25.000]  Google Airlift of Evil.
[46:25.000 --> 46:26.000]  Mainstream news.
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000]  6,000 Taliban al-Qaeda flown to safety.
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.000]  Last week, we heard that a prison right in the middle of a U.S. military base got raided.
[46:36.000 --> 46:44.000]  3,000 al-Qaeda Taliban got loose because you got different factions and some of our military had been arresting real al-Qaeda.
[46:44.000 --> 46:49.000]  And just like six years ago, they were ordered to release them.
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  They released them out of prison after prison.
[46:51.000 --> 46:57.000]  Well, this time they had a staged break, but it turns out the U.S. just opened the prison up.
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  And that came out mainstream news.
[46:59.000 --> 47:05.000]  Just, oh, 3,000 Taliban al-Qaeda go free last week.
[47:05.000 --> 47:06.000]  Admit it.
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  You can go read the government and admit it right now.
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.000]  You can go read them admit they run al-Qaeda attacking Iran right now.
[47:12.000 --> 47:17.000]  But the general public can't even wrap their brains around that.
[47:17.000 --> 47:22.000]  The White House puts out press releases saying, we run al-Qaeda, they're attacking Iran.
[47:22.000 --> 47:30.000]  But then publicly, for the general public, they say, oh, Iran's running al-Qaeda.
[47:30.000 --> 47:38.000]  They're Shiite folks, or the opposite group.
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  Most Muslim sects live side by side with Christians and don't even hate them.
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  They do hate each other, though.
[47:46.000 --> 47:58.000]  Legal experts have described the High Court's decision as a death knell of the special tribunals created by President Bush and his Republican allies in Congress to try the war on terror suspects.
[47:58.000 --> 48:14.000]  But Justice Department Chief Mukasey said the controversial tribunals at the U.S. Naval Base in Hanama Bay, Cuba will continue their work at two preliminary hearings.
[48:14.000 --> 48:25.000]  The hearings focused on Omar, Qatar, Canadian, and Muhammad, Jawid, and Afghan both detained in Afghanistan for allegedly throwing grenades when they were still teenagers.
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.000]  See, they never had anybody real because they're all black ops.
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.000]  Admit it, black ops.
[48:32.000 --> 48:39.000]  Been working for the criminals that run our government for, I don't know, 79 before the Russians invaded?
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  What is that, 21, 20, 29 years?
[48:43.000 --> 48:56.000]  Been working for the British intel since 1906 through 1918.
[48:56.000 --> 49:01.000]  So they just say, we don't care what the courts say, we do what we want.
[49:01.000 --> 49:07.000]  But you better believe when the Supreme Court comes out tomorrow and says we can restrict your Second Amendment, they're going to follow that.
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  Oh, you can better believe it.
[49:10.000 --> 49:17.000]  So you say, well, what is the judgment? I mean, you say, Alex, ignore one Supreme Court ruling, but don't listen to another federal court ruling.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  You know what the president's doing now?
[49:19.000 --> 49:24.000]  The yardstick is the Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence, the Magna Carta.
[49:24.000 --> 49:33.000]  And not having habeas corpus for anybody due process or at least being able to face their accusers, hear the charges.
[49:33.000 --> 49:42.000]  That is a violation of the great reddit, and therefore, as Marbury v. Madison said back when the Supreme Court had its head screwed on correctly, it's null and void.
[49:42.000 --> 49:52.000]  Just like when the Supreme Court said blacks were not human, they were two-thirds human, they described them basically as monkey creatures.
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  Very horrible.
[49:54.000 --> 50:01.000]  And black started revolting saying, I don't care if you don't say I'm a human, I'm not going to be a slave, I'm going to run away.
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  I'm going to beat master's head in.
[50:04.000 --> 50:15.000]  So because the Supreme Court's saying blacks weren't human, that clearly is in violation of the Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence.
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.000]  And if that didn't apply to them at first, they said it did apply to them later and they fought for it.
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  And by the way, a lot of white Christians are the ones that really fought for it.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  And that's what it's going to come to.
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  It won't be any directed, it won't be any, you know, systematic attack on the system.
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  It's already undirected, unstoppable in the Info War.
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  It will be physical.
[50:36.000 --> 50:47.000]  But after you rape and kill more people and take more to FEMA camps, and after you show everybody that we were right about this, you're just going to start dying.
[50:47.000 --> 50:55.000]  What Alexander Schultz and Itza talked about, what happened in Romania?
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  What happened in other areas is just going to happen.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  And I'm not pleased or even happy about that either.
[50:59.000 --> 51:04.000]  It means nothing to the globalists that secret police are going to get killed and cops are going to get killed.
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  They love that.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  They all live offshore, folks.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  It's a joke to them.
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  It's actually entertaining.
[51:09.000 --> 51:14.000]  But yeah, you're going to keep killing more people's kids and keep doing bad stuff.
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.000]  And the instinct to live and fight is going to grow and just haven't helped us.
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  I'm going to come back and give you all the other news.

[52:52.000 --> 52:55.000]  This is a story about a secret.
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.000]  They say there are ways to tell when someone is keeping a secret from you.
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  But one sure way is when they tell you.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  Tell you they have a secret.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  And someone is telling.
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  Telling the whole world.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.000]  On the cover of millions of magazines.
[53:11.000 --> 53:15.000]  They even advertised in the last Super Bowl that they have a secret.
[53:15.000 --> 53:20.000]  They say her name is Victoria and that Victoria has a secret.
[53:20.000 --> 53:25.000]  Strange isn't it that no one is asking what the secret is?
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  And if you are told would you believe it?
[53:28.000 --> 53:35.000]  We tell at the website another untoldstory.com of shall we say three suspected secrets.
[53:35.000 --> 53:40.000]  The first is hidden in open sight and easily believable.
[53:40.000 --> 53:48.000]  The second secret it is tied to an ancient prophecy and the rest of the story behind that prophecy.
[53:48.000 --> 53:57.000]  And the third well for most it's almost unbelievable.
[53:57.000 --> 54:01.000]  But believe it Victoria does have a secret.

[54:30.000 --> 54:42.000]  So Obama's top advisor says Obama's for the warrantless spying on the American people.
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.000]  And now he's going to take more corporate contributions.
[54:46.000 --> 54:52.000]  Folks he's going to lie to you and you're going to love it.
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.000]  He's got the all seeing eye right there on all of his posters.
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  You're going to love that too.
[55:00.000 --> 55:06.000]  Just like the Republicans all love George Bush.
[55:06.000 --> 55:13.000]  You're going to see the exact same agenda under Obama or McCain.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  It's all going to intensify.
[55:16.000 --> 55:22.000]  This thing spiral more and more out of control.
[55:22.000 --> 55:27.000]  As tyranny rises.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  But at the same time Liberty is rising.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  Freedom is rising.
[55:33.000 --> 55:42.000]  The human spirit that has an unbelievable drive and desire to be free is rising.
[55:42.000 --> 55:51.000]  Some of the other news some consider new technology invasion of privacy.
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  That's right.
[55:53.000 --> 55:58.000]  So it's police in one Midwest city have turned to a new technology to cut down on crime.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  But not everybody's happy.
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.000]  See that's implied that oh cutting down on crime you're not happy.
[56:03.000 --> 56:04.000]  They're the bad people.
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  Franklin police can now scan and record the license numbers of cars.
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  See they don't tell you the full story.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  This has been in nationwide for at least six seven years in most areas for a decade.
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.000]  The NSA paid to have it put in the National Reconnaissance Office is involved.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  That's all declassified.
[56:20.000 --> 56:27.000]  FEMA controls it at the local threat synergy systems centers threat integration centers
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.000]  emergency management centers they all different names for different agency slaves.
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  And everything is read your license plate where you go what you do instantly logged.
[56:36.000 --> 56:41.000]  Now in Houston in Austin in New York in Chicago and L.A.
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.000]  For at least three years I've seen him getting select squad cars with it.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  And they just drive around harassing people.
[56:47.000 --> 56:54.000]  And now they're going to put the watch list the criminal watch list the terrorist watch list no judge no jury no conviction.
[56:54.000 --> 57:00.000]  But then the cops driving the cars will be aggravated felons.
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.000]  So see when you read this it means the criminals have a new tool to control their slaves.
[57:05.000 --> 57:12.000]  The new technology was created to help identify stolen cars and those cars wanted by police.
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  Yeah but if your car gets stolen the cops won't come out.
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  The technology also creates a record of where drivers have been.
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  Of course the criminals just go and swap plates.
[57:22.000 --> 57:27.000]  At the same time some people have said the new technology goes too far calling an invasion of privacy.
[57:27.000 --> 57:31.000]  Oh it doesn't go too far that all major airports 200 plus in the U.S.
[57:31.000 --> 57:38.000]  By the middle of next year they're saying are going to force you through body scanners that give you a 360 naked image of your body.
[57:38.000 --> 57:47.000]  But now because of complaints at the airports that have put it in they have you put a metal plate over your genitals.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  Disgusting demons.
[57:49.000 --> 57:55.000]  But now the feds are saying we're not going to allow that anymore because you could hide the weapon under it.
[57:55.000 --> 58:00.000]  And so they're writing up rules I saw these last week saying well we may have to feel your genitals.
[58:00.000 --> 58:07.000]  You can put the metal over but we're going to now squeeze your testicles or touch your female parts.
[58:07.000 --> 58:10.000]  Oh go look it up.
[58:10.000 --> 58:15.000]  Cops all over the nation pulling blood without warrants on the side of the road.
[58:15.000 --> 58:18.000]  It's about passing boundaries getting in your business.
[58:18.000 --> 58:25.000]  And who else is going to take blood but an aggravated hardcore killer felon who's already killed family after family in Iraq.
[58:25.000 --> 58:29.000]  Made snuff film videos murdering them.
[58:29.000 --> 58:34.000]  There's more snuff films on the web today and there's troops right on there going we're going to kill you Jones.
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  I saw some this morning we're going to double tap you.

[58:41.000 --> 58:50.000]  Just hardcore criminals hardcore evil spreading breeding taking over totally illegitimate.
[58:50.000 --> 58:53.000]  They've got their grid almost in place.
[58:53.000 --> 58:59.000]  Their hero is Jack Bauer just an army of hardcore sadist.
[58:59.000 --> 59:03.000]  They've got twenty six thousand preachers teaching their flocks to stand down.
[59:03.000 --> 59:06.000]  They've got twenty three thousand executives half a million front drivers.
[59:06.000 --> 59:07.000]  They're everywhere.
[59:07.000 --> 59:11.000]  They're bringing the country down.

[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  Alex Jones.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  Feds are set to announce tomorrow according to the AP that you have no second amendment.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  Now the announcement will be that you have a second amendment, but that it means they can ban your guns.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  It's like saying you have a right to life, liberty, and suit of happiness and they cut your head off.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  And say, but we have a right to cut your head off.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  That's unbelievable.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  At the same time, there's insane news.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Like world's first moving building by Italian to be built in Dubai.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  We're Cheney and the elite are all moving.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  We have other news.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  I remember telling you this eight years ago because I read Toyota and Ford consortium meeting.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  A retina scanner will scan your eye when you get in your car passively.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Means you don't have to even ask it.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  It'll lock in on your eye and then scan it.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  If it shows you're tired, you won't let you start the car.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Then when you have medical problems, it'll decide you can't drive the car.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  Then when you have medical problems, it'll decide you can't drive the car.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  And there's going to be in dash breathalysers, passive breathalysers.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  They're already trying to put cameras in the cars that are going to watch you.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  This will be hooked into the local emergency management center.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  That's really the federal center.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  This is motorist.org mandatory in car breathalysers coming.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  And it says for GM, Toyota, others are doing it is coming.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  You are all guilty until proven innocent.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  See, this is the new world.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  All of your computers with cameras built in are watching you now whenever they want.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  There are built in microphones.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  They've announced they're listening to you now.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  Total lawlessness, cameras in school bathrooms, felon cops everywhere running around.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  Just hell, hell is here.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  It says if you're not a convicted drunk driver,
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  should you still be required to have an in-car breathalyzer fitted at your expense
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  to next to your new vehicle in a niche in your new vehicle.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Some automakers including GM and Toyota think so.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  They and a few others are working together under the auspices of something called
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  the driver alcohol detection system for safety,
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  which is a $10 million federal program that is trying to develop just technology
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  for mass introduction a few years from now.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  And what they'll do is California and Germany and a few other areas will force it.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  Then it'll be adopted on all cars.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  And I remember telling you 10 years ago when OnStar came out
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  that I read in the federal documents that they were listening to you.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  All the cops come out, they are.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  And now the cops locally dial into the emergency center and they kill your car.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  All got slave kill switches, breathalyzers, scanning, reading our license plates.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Aggravated felons are in the squad cars behind you.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  They've killed hundreds of peas getting back from Iraq.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  It's death time, folks. It's evil time.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  The good troops that don't like it, they get rotated out with the psycho killers.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  They bring them right back and they're in uniform and they're going to run everything.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  They're going to make sure as this country sucks dry, we don't struggle too hard.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  As every liberty and every free and everything we are is destroyed.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  At the moment, the only people who have to deal with and pay for it
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  and carburetilizes and convicted drunks, the devices are basically ignition locks
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  that prevent the vehicle ignition from being started until the would-be driver blows in the tube
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  and the system determines he's not liquored up.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  By 2012, the in-breath sniffers will be standard equipment in every new vehicle sold.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  Force fed to you by the tag team in Washington, Detroit.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  And, of course, by mothers against drunk driving.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  No conviction necessary. No nothing. Just everyone gets it.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  And last money before I left town, it was in the London Telegraph.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  The British government has announced all prisoners and all parolees will be implanted with microchips next year, according to plans.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  I remember they announced six years ago they were going to do that in California,
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  and there were lawsuits, and they backed off. That was in Reuters.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  See, first it's a bracelet, an ankle. Now it's a chip.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  We were kooks, we were nuts, but now the military is getting them.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  I'm going to tell you something again, cops, military. Go ahead and laugh.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Go ahead and be on power trips.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  You are being injected with mercury poison and cancer viruses.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  I've played top eugenicist on show in the inventor of the polio vaccine, a top bio weapons expert, a top eugenicist laughing about how they put cancer viruses in it.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  And how they use monkeys from bio weapons tests to take the blood to make it.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  Now they're doing it right now. They are murdering you right now.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  Have enough courage to not believe me, but to go check out my claims.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  We had it all up on Info Wars and Prison Plan.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  I'm begging you, enforcers, even if you like killing us, you need to realize your master's like killing you.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  Coming up, every town, every city already is putting in license plate reading systems to track trace tax.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  They're going to announce that people who Homeland Security says are on criminal or terror watch list cannot move outside cities or move at night.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  They're going to do that in China with their control grid.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  The government's announcing that that's coming.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  It's just total enslavement, breathalysers in all cars.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  Everyone will have to breathalyze to start the car.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  It's mainstream news.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  Just total tyranny.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  Also, human events is reporting Nancy Pelosi has announced they are going to basically bring back the fairness doctrine.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  They'll let mainline liberal or mainline conservative fake talk radio on, but they mean internet radio, everything.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  They are going to try to regulate it and say that you don't have no free speech and cannot say you don't like Barack Obama or you don't like George Bush.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  I'm not kidding.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  We lost free speech for a while in this country and then it went away and now that there's actually some free speech happening, they're coming after us.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  You can't make this stuff up.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  They're just attacking the First Amendment, attacking the Second, attacking the Fourth, the Fifth.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  Now, the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  And Congress has tried to pass a bunch of bills to put a federal tax on all internet transactions.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  And now they've introduced legislation that is set to pass today.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  And that's the AP headline by the way, is that they are set to pass today $300 billion mortgage rescue up for a vote.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  And in it still is what's known as the eBay reporting provision.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  Now, eBay and others already report everything you do to the government.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  This is all shopping carts, everything.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  And a lot of shopping carts you make about $200 a year or less, you'll have to pay to be nexused in to one of the big three wire transfer systems.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  And they will report everything you do to the government.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  No judge, no jury, no warrant, no making you violate your rights and violate your Fifth Amendment against incriminating yourself.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  They just do it kind of like all prescriptions you get are now uploaded to the feds.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Violate your Fourth Amendment.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  All kind of, everything's surveilled.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  All your bank accounts are already surveilled criminally.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  The government doesn't have to get it from the bank.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  They're hooked in.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  Totally criminal.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  So they're trying to retroactively, just like with the Pfizer bill, make their criminal activity.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  Because this is a felony every time the government's been doing this.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  They're trying to retroactively make it legal.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  Now, the experts on this are the folks at FreedomWorks.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  And I think it's best for them to tell you who they are.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  We have Max Pappas, their Director of Public Policy on with us.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  They warned us about the provision.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  I read the bill.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  I think it's even worse than their interpretation.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  But this is for the national sales tax.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  This is for the total control grid.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  And this is to make your brick and mortar businesses in the next phase hook into the web for instant reporting.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Thank you for coming on, sir.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  Tell us about the group first yourself and then tell us about the bill.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Well, we're FreedomWorks.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  We're a nationwide advocacy group, a grassroots organization that fights for lower taxes, less government, and more freedom.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  Our chairman is Dick Armey.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  He's the former House Majority Leader.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  We've got a great website at FreedomWorks.org.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  And we work with concerned citizens across the country who want government to leave them alone.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  We organize them in state chapters.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  We've got state leaders across the country.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  Everybody's free to join.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  We sign up on FreedomWorks.org and help us fight for less government.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  Now, love Dick Armey or hate Dick Armey, he has shot down when he was in Congress, Internet taxation bills repeatedly.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  That's right.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  And he was also one of the few Republicans in the majority at the time who was working against the Patriot Act.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Yeah, so we owe Dick Armey for that up in Dallas.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  Tell us about this for those that don't know what this is going to mean.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  Well, to first draw the bigger picture, we've got a big problem going on with this mortgage bailout bill.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  It's looking like it's the Bank of America countrywide bailout bill, more than the, I'm having a hard time paying my mortgage bailout bill.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  It turns out, some publishers found out this weekend that Bank of America lobbyists wrote a draft piece of legislation that they gave to the Senate.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  That looks an awful lot like what Senator Dodd, who got a special loan from countrywide, introduced as his mortgage bailout bill.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  And as some of the listeners probably know, Bank of America said that it's going to buy countrywide, so you've got an interesting circle going on there with Senator Dodd saving $75,000 on his mortgage with his special rate from countrywide,
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  which is going to be bought out by Bank of America, which drafted the legislation that Senator Dodd introduced.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  So deep inside that bill, and we're wondering why it's even in this bill, is a provision for payment card and third party network information reporting,
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  which is basically deputizing the America's payment processing system to keep an eye out for the government, which is a horrible precedent to begin with.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  Basically, if you're a small business or eBay power seller, you're being treated like a criminal on parole, and you're going to be required to participate in an unprecedented level of reporting to the federal government.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Well, it's also slavery to make the companies do this. In the past, when they made telecom spy on us, they had to give them $9 billion to pay for it.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  In this case, it's just going to be you're going to report on yourself and these companies are going to report on you with all this new paperwork, and that'll be passed on as a tax.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  That's right. The portion of the bill that this appears on is the funding portion of the bill or the tax portion of the bill.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  And the reason it's in there is because the purported idea of this is that this is going to increase tax compliance among internet sellers.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  So the government is going to create this giant federal database, which is going to be a ripe target for anybody who wants to get into private information, because what the companies are going to have to report are tax identification numbers.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  And if you're a small business, chances are that's your social security number.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  So the federal government is violating its own recently stated principle that the best way to protect privacy is to use social security numbers less by putting this in place, which is going to increase the use of social security numbers by people who are fairly casual sellers on eBay,
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  which is going to be very attractive for those who want to get in.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  And what they're planning on doing is using this to get you to pay more taxes on more internet transactions.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  So it's a twofer.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  How do we stop it?
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  Well, as you mentioned at the top of the show, there's a, this might get voted on in the Senate today.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  Fortunately, the Democrats are giving us a little bit of help and that it may get voted on in the Senate today, but there are so many differences in the provisions between the House and the Senate bill that this may end up having to go back to the House of Representatives.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  So that may give us a few more weeks.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  One of the interesting differences in provisions is the Senate bill.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  Remember, this is part of a giant mortgage bailout bill.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  The Senate wants to bail out people with mortgages up to, I believe it's $650,000 while the House wants to bail out people with mortgages up to $750,000.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  I think the difference might be partly explained by Nancy Pelosi leading the House in San Francisco where there are more $750,000 houses.
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  That seems to be a pretty high threshold to be getting taxpayer dollars to save your house that you probably-
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  Yeah, the Democrats are always saying help the little guy.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  And here they are wanting to bail out people with $750,000 houses when the rest of us are going to have to pay for it in taxes.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  Yeah, this is going directly on the back of everybody who's been a responsible mortgage payer and on the back of the people who are our renters, which includes myself.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  I haven't been able to afford to buy a house in Washington, D.C. because the prices got out of control.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  I could have done a risky mortgage, but I decided not to.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  Those of us who have been trying to save their money or who are paying their mortgages on time, just about 96% of the population are going to be asked to pay for these people who bought $750,000 houses in San Francisco when they probably shouldn't have.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  Or pay for Ed McMahon when he loses his house, basically.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  Yes, sir, yes.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  What you can do and what we've been doing and what we've been getting our army of activists around the country to do is call up your senator and tell him to not vote for this bill.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  I can give you a free 181866 number to 18669283035 and we'll push it right through to your senator and you can tell them to stop this ridiculous housing bailout bill with its front to American privacy.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  We'll talk about police state pork barrel.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  It's a bill about supposedly bailing out people in trouble with their mortgages and they've got a thing in there about taxing and regulating all of the shopping carts.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  Which most of the shopping carts I know of are little old ladies that sell maybe two pairs of mittens a month or a week or people selling beanie babies.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  I mean, this is going to be devastating.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  It is and I just recently came across another provision that I don't know as much about, but this is again a 600 page bill that they just threw out there.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  There's a national fingerprint registry for mortgage brokers.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  And if you read deeper into that, they plan to have all professions under Homeland Security.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  You will thumb print to get in and out of work and then that will track everything you do and your employment and then people say, well, good, that'll stop illegals.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  They're going to be legalized under the guest worker program.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  That's right.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  And I don't know who's putting all these pieces in, but I do know that it's Senator Grassley who introduced this, this eBay, Amazon provision.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  That's right.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  He will run around and say that he's fighting the police state, but meanwhile he is involved in so much of it.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  He is and he's developed a particular affinity for this, this sense of poking his nose into other people's business.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  He's been snooping around a lot of nonprofit organizations in the country, particularly going after some of the church groups with this sort of investigation.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  And he's just going to get more information.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  You know, when you create a big pot of information like this for one particular industry, you end up with Mission Creep where this pot of information exists and somebody else wants it.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  They're going to find a way to get it.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  Well, let's be honest about it.
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  They're using all this data to basically selectively target whoever they want.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  Both parties do it and most of the data leaks we have are from government programs.
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  Most of the identity theft is government leaks.
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  And then they come back and say, we need more numbers, more tracking, which only makes it worse.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  In the final segment with our guest, he is the Director of Public Policy at FreedomWorks.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S., though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  We will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them.com.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  The message of his kingdom.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment and our high stress lifestyles.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain and eventually disease.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[1:24:50.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  Alright, final segment with our guest. I wanted to bring this up to him because he's in a public interest lobbying group or public interest watchdog, more properly said, who is there tracking and tracing what's happening in government.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  And both Republicans and Democrats, this is the gang raping of liberty, of freedom. This is government preparing scores of new taxes, green taxes, carbon taxes, regulations, surveillance control.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  Surveillance is control, is taxation. And they admit that's what all this is for.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  And so going back to the director of public policy at Freedom Works, Max Pappas. Max, in closing, got about four minutes.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  What is the climate going to be like now with the new administration, whether it's McCain or Obama? What are we facing?
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  Because all the indicators I see is that if you thought a tripling of government under Bush or a doubling under Clinton was bad, prepare yourself.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  The OECD internationally says they want us to go to an 84% tax rate.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  Yeah, there seems to be a surprising amount of support for tax increases out there, particularly coming from Senator Obama.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  There's been, I think, two particularly interesting incidents where he's come out, and I think he's probably the first candidate since Walter Mondale to publicly say that he would raise taxes.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  One is on social security and the other is on capital gains. It was during one of the national televised debates with Hillary Clinton.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  One of the moderators asked him, he said, so Obama, you support capital gains tax increases, but we've seen that when capital gains tax rates go down, revenues go up,
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  and when capital gains taxes go up, federal revenues go down. So you couldn't possibly support such an increase for more revenue for the government.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  And Senator Obama said he supported it for fairness, which is to say that he explicitly said he supports raising taxes for redistributive purposes,
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  even if it means less prosperity for the Americans and less revenue for the government, which is pretty startling.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  And then today there's an interesting op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that talks about Senator Obama's social security plan.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  And it looks at the numbers and it finds that although what he would do would take the cap off of social security taxes.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  Well, for those that don't know, the average person is paying seven to nine percent on social security.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  Your employer then has to match that, and so that's what happens is you end up paying out of your paycheck for that.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  So we're talking 14 to 18 percent. You're never going to see it. It's already gone.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  And I guess now they're going to just, I mean, that's a whole other taxing system and people don't realize that.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  That's right. And they look at the numbers and Obama's aides are asked, well, what have you seen that this will do for the solvency problem of social security?
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  And they admitted that they hadn't really looked into the numbers.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  So this journalist looked into the numbers and looked into the social security trustees reports and said it looks like this giant increase would do at best reduce a third of the unfunded liability,
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  while at the same time would be one of the greatest increases in tax increases in American history and bring our tax rates back to the levels that they were in the 1970s when they got so high that they completely stopped economic projects.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  Well, Max, let's talk Turkey. We got at least 15 percent compounded inflation, the dollars plunging. That's why oil is exploding.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  None of our media will say that. I've got to agree with George Carlin. At least financially, we're done.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  And to have the Democrats and Republicans saying spin, spin, spin, that's because they're just looting.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  I mean, you talk to Congressmen in private, they say it's all gone. They're just buying houses in Switzerland.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  I mean, do you get that type of response from anybody in Washington or does anybody admit to you what they've admitted to me?
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  Well, there's certainly no money in the Social Security Trust Fund, that's for sure, because all the Social Security Trust Fund is as a box of IOUs because all that money has been loaned to other parts of the government to be spent.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  Yeah, and just to fund Social Security in 20 years, they've said over 80 percent taxation just for that. And it's just over, folks. It's over.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  Get on the website. Give out the website. Give out the number for folks to call and tell them not to pass this total federal takeover of commerce.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  All right. Well, we've got FreedomWorks.org is our main website. We've got AngryRenter.com, which is our protest against the mortgage bailout bill. We've also got GasPriceProtest.com, which is telling Congress to drill American oil and produce American oil to reduce our dependence and help lower the cost.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  And we'll put you through to your congressman or your senator to tell them to drill an American now and to avoid this mortgage bailout to call us at 866-928-3035.
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  Max, thank you so much for spending time with us. That's Max Papas, the Director of Public Policy, FreedomWorks. Thank you for spending time with us.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  Thank you very much.
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  I'm going to take care. I'm going to come back and get into all the news. And then we've got, I haven't even gotten into the new 9-11 developments today. It's just literally insane how much is happening.

[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  The police were respectful. We had a bill of rights and constitution. The more Liberty we had, the less crime we had. The more secure we were.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  The military industrial complex came in with the same systems they used to overthrow other countries and control people.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  They started staging terror attacks, started shipping in drugs and screw everything up. Now they push pharmaceuticals on all the kids, their goal under the new freedom initiative of President Bush.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  Half the kids on psychotropics whose molecule is more dangerous than that of PCP. They're going to do it.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  They're going to hire felons to be your police and military, just on your face, criminal government, totally rogue, totally evil.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  They're now retroactively legalizing warrantless wiretapping, face scanning citizens, tracking everything, microchipping prisoners, parolees, just total criminal government.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  They are going to hurt us bad. And I'm not trying to be overly negative here. I cannot describe how serious things are.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  I'm trying to get you upset so you realize how late it is. And if you're a good person in the military, a good person in the police force.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  I mean, folks, I whack my shin and I've got an abscess in the bone and I'm in excruciating pain, but I'm alive here on air because this is serious.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  And the things that are happening are serious. I'm not whining. I'm just letting you know I may be a little bit grumpy today.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  Oh, man. Mandatory in-car breathalyzers coming. I already covered this. It's just who can get over it? Prisoners to be microchipped, in prison and out of prison.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  Who could? You just can't make this stuff up. Troublemakers in the U.S., millions on the criminal list, the anti-terror list, all tracked and traced, all controlled.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  It's just hellish. They're going to legalize all the illegal aliens under the system. They tell the idiot public they're doing all this to control the illegal aliens.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  The poor illegal aliens, I don't even hate them. I mean, they want a better life and they're filled with a nationalistic hatred of the U.S.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  They haven't had their nationalism destroyed yet and they don't understand that they're being manipulated and controlled to help bring down the U.S.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  McCain says only World War III would justify a draft. Only World War III would prompt Republican presidential candidate John McCain to bring back the military draft.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  McCain said on Tuesday, many Americans are fearful the U.S. government may be forced to reinstate the draft given the prolonged Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  Gee, I wonder why. Because they've introduced a score of bills and are trying to pass it in the military, the army, the joint chiefs have called for a draft.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  Maybe because there is a draft of the people that have already served two, three, four tours in combat. Something they didn't even do in Vietnam or Korea or World War II.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  A couple years ago, I'd read the bills on air and national news would do articles saying we were conspiracy theorists that didn't exist.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  I mean, introduced bills, trying to pass it, the Pentagon supporting it, the draft boards reactivated five years ago, ready, draft board heads saying,
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  We're going to have a draft soon. Republican memos saying we're going to be hit by terrorists. We're going to have martial law and a draft. But you've got a bunch of yuppies trained to say everything's fine.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  And they just say, that isn't true. So they're not going to call it a draft. They're going to call it national service.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  And the yuppies will stick their 18-year-old sons and daughters in there to get turned into hamburger. And as they're marched off, they'll say it isn't a draft because nobody makes me a stinking yuppie do anything.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  And the stinking yuppies as their dollar implodes, they'll tell you, Hey, my dollar in devalue, they'll tell you your face. It's fine.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  I got clips of them on Wall Street saying it's got the same value. It doesn't matter everywhere it doesn't. They'll just say it doesn't.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  It's called invincible ignorance. They want to be slaves. They want to have bad things happen.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  And they always squeal and cry and go, I've always supported the police. I stick the little coward stickers on my car saying I donate to them. And they beat my wife up.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  Or they beat me up. Or they arrested me for my seatbelt being off. I was in my neighborhood at the mailbox. Or, you know, they beat my kid up and I can't believe it.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  I mean, help me. Help me. The government doesn't care. They went to court and they didn't care.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  That's right. Slave. They don't care about you. It's like a 1984 Winston's idiot neighbor who worships the police state and loves the fact that his kids have denounced him as a traitor.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  And he says, well, I didn't know I was a traitor, but, you know, he'd work like an extra 20 hours a week for the government just to prove how much he loved him.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  I guess I do deserve to be killed. My children denounced me. They're the same. It's like, I deserved to go to a FEMA camp. It's of the Lord.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  Ask about the possibility of a potential voter in Florida during a telephone town hall meeting.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  McCain said, I don't want what would make a draft happen unless we were in an all out war like World War Three.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  You got to love it. A bunch of draft Dodgers, the Bush administration, the Clintons all preparing for a draft.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  On this subject, it's just really weird. Very, very strange.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  But the media is playing it off like, oh, there was a little security scare. It was a little something funny happened.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  Little something. Don't worry about it. Move along. Nothing to see here.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  Israel investigates security scare at Sarkozy departure.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  Tel Aviv suicide cop family says he was happy.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  That's right.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  Assassination scares Nicholas Sarkozy and wife Carla.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  As a policeman shoots himself in the head just yards away. Just a little reminder. You're our massage agent. You, your, you know, family's massage.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  You are going to follow orders and do exactly as we say. And does it matter if it destroys your political career saying you're pro war and attack Iran?
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  You will say it or you will die Sarkozy.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  Or they were trying to kill him to claim that some Muslim had done it.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  And the guy who was programmed to do it went ahead and did the disposal feature instead of carrying out the killing first.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  Nicholas Sarkozy was at the center of assassination scare yesterday when a police officer at the ceremony fatally shot himself in the head.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  You always wonder the government's hiring all these aggravated felons and people to be their supporters and their bosses. Aren't they worried about hardcore rapist?
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  That was in the Washington Post and Washington Times that they're hiring rapists to join the military.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  And I'm like, oh, hiring rapist is bad and arsonist is bad. And they're just like, shut up. You're anti America.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  Shut up traitor questioning us is illegal.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  I put a trailer out about getting firing in police and medical workers, medical treatment, my new film and the troops are on the site and you link through their YouTube pages.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  As I said, it's a big deal. And they're on there saying, we're going to kill you. Yes, we're going to kill you. You're a trader trying to get us medical treatment.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  I mean, they do not want it. They want to suck in poison and love their God.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  I'm not kidding. They are committed to evil, folks, just as much as we're committed to goodness.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  They are committed. And you've got a blind, idiot population that can't see what's around them.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  Assassination scare of Nicholas, our cozy and wife.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  Look at this Israeli suicide cop family refute claims that he killed himself. The family of Raid Assad, Raiden.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  Good on. That's a long name.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  Then Israeli guard who shot in the head during a farewell ceremony for President Nicholas, our cozy, total airport refutes claims today that he committed suicide. Mr.
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  Anon 32 of the Northern Druze village of Betjian could not have killed himself, said a family member, the local press.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  We scornfully reject the claims that our son took his life. He was a kindhearted and happy person.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  He had a family and there was no reason for him to do such a thing.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  The officer's father, Assad, gone, said that he had last seen his son in good spirits.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  He had a family. He had friends. He had plans for a future and had no reason to commit suicide.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  Yeah, but I bet he was just going to come out. He was in a special military psychological unit before you'll watch.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  And a lot of times they don't follow program. They dispose of themselves.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  He had took police representative several hours to reach the family who lived in a remote village in Israel's north. Naif Ganon, the officer's brother, said the officials who came in form of the family, the death, said that he, the circumstances of the incident were still being investigated.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  Yeah, this is a made up cover story. He probably tried to fight some operative. They'll usually have some, you know, Lakudnik who claims who will then go to jail for doing it, smiling and laughing when it's on video that he doesn't shoot the person and they drag him into a car and drive him.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  And something's fishy here. Kind of like they told us Benazir Budo hit her head on the car and died and then the video comes out and they just spray her with bullets.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  And everybody else in the world knows it's a lie and they later came out and admitted it was a lie, but in the U.S. it is still said she hit her head and it is believed by the cattle because they are fluoride heads.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  They have rotholes all in their brains. They are just destroyed mercury filled slaves just loving it and they are going to love what else happens to them. Let me tell you.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  Very suspicious and we'll find out more Israel prodding U.S. to attack Iran. We're going to cover that coming up. There's also a bunch of economic news that I want to cover now.
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  But before we do that because there was a Bloomberg report as you know over the weekend posted. We have a link to it up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  And top brokerage houses are saying $5,000 an ounce goal within the next two years. If inflation continues and they say all signs are it is.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  Okay, if they're saying 5000 folks, it is conservative to say 2000. And if you follow the gold chart, listen to me carefully.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  Go look up. Look up a type in 10 year gold chart type in five year gold chart type in long term gold charts. Go look at them.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  The financial institution websites gold has gone from $267 an ounce five years ago to $900 an ounce is where it seems to have settled out.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  It will go up to 920 back to 880 but back and forth in there. That always happens in the summer energy goes up in the summer.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  Then goes down a little bit in the fall and back up in the winter. There's those two peaks for it. Gold runs up in the fall and winter and then goes down in the late spring summer.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  You always if you look at those charts, it is always up. But but but in the last six years, it's been going up and then gaining more than it loses each year.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  You understand it's going straight up. It's hyperbolic. Regardless, you can't take all the value of gold and silver away.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  Let's say it isn't even going to go up, which the experts are saying a five fold increase. I don't know if I believe that.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  That's what they're saying. The conservatives are saying that. You know what that means? It means the dollar will be worthless if that happens.
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  I hope that in the case, the bottom line, gold and silver will protect you. Gold and silver will always have intrinsic value and they can't devalue it like fellow reserve notes.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  A lot of you haven't taken money out of the bank or CDs or stocks and bonds. Your stocks are down. You don't know what to do.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  Get a little bit of gold. You know, get a few pieces. See how easy it is to get, you know, spread it out, put in a safety deposit box, put some with family, silver, whatever.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  You've got it and you've got something. The main line, people say 10 to 20 percent in metals.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  Okay. Most of you who even listen to this show aren't 5 percent in metals. Let's say you got $20,000 in the bank. You don't have a thousand in gold or silver.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  It's so portable and with gold, you get the coins right at melt. Okay. Instead of jewelry where there's a two, three times markup.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  Women say, oh, I have jewelry as an emergency investment. Yeah, but that diamonds marked up three times, that gold chains marked up twice, three times.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about getting gold right down at melt.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  Now, if you wanted to be able to have one coin to get out of the country where the coin you could get $100,000 for, those are just a little bit harder to sell.
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  But that's the type of thing where you could have two or three coins in your pocket, things that look innocuous and get out.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  That's why art is such an important black market thing. They're trying to black out the black market with this new stuff to shut down eBay, Amazon, your own private shopping cart, everything will be reported and controlled.
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  They know as things get squeezed and squeezed and more and more taxes, you're going to run to the underground economy.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  So there are collectors as well. Nothing like I was saying, you know, $100,000, but those, that's what the real elite have.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  They'll have a little bag of coins that they need to fly out that are worth millions. You understand?
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  These are the real currencies. This is what the elite has. I'm going to bring Ted Anderson up for just three minutes.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Ted, now is the time for folks to move into precious metals while it's sitting still. It normally plunges in the summer. It's not. It's sitting there.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  It's sitting there.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  Right about that, Alex. Right now definitely is the time to be getting into the gold and silver market.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  I mean, there are a lot of people that moved in last October, November, December.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  Obviously a very good time to get in as well because it started at about $600 and then ran up to about $1,030 an ounce.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  Right now we're seeing it backed off just about where you're saying it's just hovering at that $900 level.
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  I'll see it run up to about 940 and then it drops down to about 8888.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  Really, it's about where the bottom is and that's where we're at right now.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  So if it's going to be even fluctuating between 888 and 940, obviously you want to buy it at the 888 level.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  This fall, things will pick back up again just like it always does in the gold and silver business.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  But the run is going to be phenomenal.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  Oh, and you're talking about Bloomberg.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  For God's sakes, these people sell stocks and they're telling people to buy gold.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  I mean, everybody knows that the United States dollar is doomed.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  And when I say United States dollar, I use that term so loosely because it really has nothing to do with it.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  The private federal reserve.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  Exactly. It has nothing to do with the U.S.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  I mean, if we have a revolution, it should be over that one alone.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  Ted, tell folks the different offers you've got.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  Yeah, right now we really have some really good buys.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  We have the Swiss and French Frank and Belgium, they're at 194.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  That's a great buy.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  And that's a fifth of an ounce.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  It's a fifth of an ounce.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  And then we also have the British sovereign, which is a quarter of an ounce.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  And that currently right now is trading at $243 a coin.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  I really think silver is a good buy at this particular time, too.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  Right now, I'm suggesting that people get into that walking liberty half.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  They're at $182 per roll of 20.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  Again, Alex, the handwriting is on the wall.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  The dollar is going to be sliding as foreigners tend to get away from the U.S. dollar.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  And the smart money here in the United States is doing the same.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  They're getting the crap away from that United States dollar, I should say,
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  Federal Reserve note.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  It's so deceptive.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  Everything's a deception.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  It's like it's not our military.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  It's not our government.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  It's a counterfeit fraud.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  You know, comparatively speaking, I mean, I don't know how people can think even in their mind
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  that having this paper note that is not even U.S.,
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  and it has to do with the private institution,
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  is better than having something that actually takes labor to pull out of the ground.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  Yeah, there's just too much paper.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  And in this inflationary bubble, you got to get out of paper, folks.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  800-686-2237.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  He's got the French and Swiss francs, beautiful little gold coins,
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  even have some collector value on them.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  You're getting them basically as bullion.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  Ted, also, do you still have the silver dollar rolls?
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  Silver dollar rolls are available.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  You can ask for those when you call in.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  The walking Liberty half rolls are even a better buy right now at this time
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  because you get more silver per ounce.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  Give them the number, Ted.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  800-686-2237.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Now, they got to say it's an Alex Jones special or they'll pay a little more.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  Yeah.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  This is a promotion you do every few weeks, folks.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  Ted, these are really great deals.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  Look into it.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  800-686-2237.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  It's the French and Swiss franc and it's the half dollars and the dollars.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  Give them a call 800-686-2237 and tell them Alex Jones and Ted Anderson sent you
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  so the brokers know it's the special.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  Yeah, definitely do that.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  And we'll take your calls.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  We'll get the gold and silver to you as fast as we can get it out the door.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  1-800-686-2237.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  1-800-686-2237.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  By the way, folks, if my leg keeps hurting as bad as it is, I'm going to go to rebroadcast.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  This sucker is, I'm not trying to whine, I just want you to know why I may leave.
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  I'm going to try to continue and take calls.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  I mean, have these guests on, but it's getting painful.

[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  Ah, the old republic. It really was a better place.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  But now the global crime syndicate is making its move.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  And most of our fellow Americans don't know what's happening.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  The classical tyranny is upon us.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  I was thinking this morning, I mean it really hit me.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  Normally I can't even grasp the classical tyranny, how serious it is. This is really happening.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  And I was sitting there brushing my teeth this morning.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  And I was thinking the government is really hiring tens of thousands of felons, not just felons, aggravated felons, and having them join the military and police forces.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  And then I saw them pass a rule at the county commissioners saying they're going to hire felons for the sheriff's department and for the county.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  I mean I don't have to go outside of just the counties right around me for cops taking blood without warrants at checkpoints.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  They're hiring felons or face scanning cameras or FEMA emergency centers or license plate scanning systems or microphones.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  It's happening right here where I live.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  Right here where I live.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  Cops walk up to 100 protesters peacefully on a sidewalk protesting the governor and saying you're not allowed to protest without a permit.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  We're going to arrest you.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  And I looked right at the cop and I said you know you've lost a bunch of lawsuits.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  I'm going to personally sue you if you do this. Leave me alone.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  And he backed off but barely kept saying okay we're coming with a riot. Police were coming.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  They were all dressed across the street and they backed off.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  But they don't back off most of the time.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  Why? Why are you doing this to America? What is your problem?
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  That's criminal what you're doing. I don't care what you say.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  But let me tell you in Washington DC they were shouting and yelling at the tourists.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  I mean just out in the middle of fields out in the middle of nowhere.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  Just the cops will just come over and boss them around.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  They've been told to.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  We have been told to be bossed around.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  As a country the system has been told.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  The public has been told to tattle on their neighbors.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  The police have been told.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  As a culture we've been told that tattling on your neighbors is a good thing.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  That reporting on your.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  I mean I remember 10 years ago telling people they had programs all over the country.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  Giving kids money to tattle on their parents report on what's in their houses.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  Have them write essays on it.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  Now it's all over the news.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  In Austin and San Antonio and I see it all over the country.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  Same program.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  Cops come in give them a credit card 200 bucks on it.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  When they turn in a family member.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  And the families go oh yeah I send my son and daughter to school to learn how to report on me.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  And they have semester long classes in the sixth and seventh grade.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  Where they write essays on mommy and daddy and it says in the federal grants.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  That the local federal deputized officer will quote have access to the children.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  After school and in the playground and at lunch.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  Our kids just living with spies that sit there.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  Getting in the way of the family.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  I mean you are dirt bags.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  You know you deal the drugs.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  You know you protect the corrupt system and you're growing.
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  You're not backing off.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  You're greedy. You're hungry.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  That's what really brought down Nazi Germany during the war.
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  Was that the Gestapo had gotten so greedy in Germany and other nations they controlled.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  That low level Gestapo guys would literally own towns.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  They would rob the local people.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  They would take over all the businesses and everything would just fall apart.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  They were well documented cases where Gestapo would want another German's good looking wife.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  And just have him taken away and then just rape the woman she wouldn't like him.
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  So he'd take her out back with a luger and blow her head off.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  You're going to live under that folks.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  Just horrible pig like government officials just having their way with you.
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  Just doing whatever they want.
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  We're going to get at the five after we got Richard Gage.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  We got Kevin Ryan.
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  We got them all coming up.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  Stay with us.
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  It is a big idea.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  A new world order.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  Is that their objective being world domination?
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  For the first time in history,
[1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:52.000]  the elites plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new big progress for the world government.
[1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  Most people have no idea.
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:00.000]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:01.000]  They're after power.
[2:00:01.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  I'm Ron Paul and you're listening to We The People Radio Network.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  We are now into the third hour, fourth hour coming up too.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  We really have been lacking in my promotion of the fact that truth rising is coming out.
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  July 4th for PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  It will then ship that Saturday the day after July 4th, July 5th.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  Everybody that gets their orders in will have them shipped out to you on that Saturday and that Monday.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  So why not have your orders in first?
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  We're only talking now about nine days away from being able to see truth rising.
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  And it is unlike any film I've ever made.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  And each film is unlike any film I've made.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  But this is No Voice Over Cinema Verite.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  I meant to have no Alex Jones in it,
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  but I got arrested with the Geraldo Rivera thing.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  And that was just too interesting.
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  All the close-ups of him flipping us off and the preening and all the rest of it.
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:59.000]  So that's like eight minutes of the two-hour film or so, that whole incident.
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  But it really is dynamic.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  And it's something everybody's got to see.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  And a lot of it's these YouTube, we are changing.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  911 Truth Videos you've seen, but now in high quality.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  I mean, it's something that everyone needs to see.
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  We intend for it to explosively grow the number of people that become activists
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  so they can fall in love with becoming activists and see the type of pressure we're under, the threats we're under.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  We need support, we need reinforcements in this fight with what 911 Truth and we are changing others.
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  Info warriors are doing.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  People confronting the globalist on the North American Union.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  I mean, there's second amendment groups, land rights groups.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  We're all fighting hard here.
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  And this film gets into it all.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  And woven throughout it is what's happening to the first responders.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  Woven throughout it is what's happening to them, how the government knew the dust was deadly, how they covered it up, how they blocked treatment.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  They could have denied there was a problem and still got them treatment, but they just don't.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  You'll meet the police officers, you'll meet the firefighters, you'll meet the army officers, you'll meet the people.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  And for that, we are being death-threaded by Marines and army people.
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  They have their handles on YouTube.
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  They have links to their sites saying, we're going to kill you.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  They are mad.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  They say it lowers morale to show that the government didn't give treatment to the troops.
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  I just, you're so sick.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  You're so sick.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  You're so dumb.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  They don't care about you, you idiots.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  I can't believe they're particularly mad about us trying to get the heroes a 9-11 treatment.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  You bastards, bastards.
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  You are so given over to evil that you even hate it when we try to help you.
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  You're just totally mindless.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  These guys in the government think it's good to death-thread us on the telephone and threaten our wives and follow us around and do all this to us.
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  The sick part, as you talk to them, they'll still say, I'm the good guy and I'm going to kill you.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  And yeah, we probably carry out the attacks because the Muslims are so deadly, we had to get you weak people ready to face it.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  I mean, they're just sick.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  They're sick.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  Is there nothing you won't be involved in?
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  Is there nothing you won't sign your names on?
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  Is there nothing you won't do because you like having petty power?
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  I've got all this other news, folks.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  I just hope you'll go pre-order Truth Rising right now at infowars.com because I want the film to be seen.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  And I hope you'll get Truth Rising and make copies of it for everybody.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  It's under two hours, even with the extras.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  Well, the film's about two hours and the extras are only about eight minutes, so it fits on a normal DVD5.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  So you can copy it any machine.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  But here's the better thing.
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  We're going to put up a DivX version.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  Right? We've learned how to do that?
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  For prisonplanet.tv members?
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  We're going to do a DivX version.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  Yes, we are.
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  Along with a bunch of other types.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  So you can download it directly and just put it on a normal computer disk.
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  Haha, in high quality!
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  I am so excited about that.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  Prisonplanet.tv members, the coordinates is July 4th instead of drinking liquor and eating hot dogs.
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  Or do that at night, if you want.
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:19.000]  They're in the day.
[2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  Burn copies.
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  Burn copies of Truth Rising.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  T-minus nine days.
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  Terror.
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  This is Steve Shank, J. Michael Stevens' group.
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  Let's get real.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  Flower is already being rationed.
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:37.000]  Prices on food are getting so high, warehouses are installing security systems and guards.
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford it,
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  or there will be no food at any price.
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  We can't grow enough of our own food, even with genetically altered trash.
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:57.000]  It will give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered food.
[2:05:57.000 --> 2:06:02.000]  They think God didn't get it right, so Monsanto had to step in.
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay.
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:07.000]  We won't tell.
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:13.000]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:17.000]  That's 800-409-5633.
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  It may be a little bit crazy, that's okay.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  Because there is no such thing as a little bit dead.

[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  For the next hour, we have the founder of Architects & Engineers, Richard Gage,
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  joining us as well as Kevin Ryan.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  I'll tell you a little bit about both these guys, Richard Gage.
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  Been a practicing architect for 20 years,
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  and designed numerous fireproof steel frame buildings.
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  He has performed construction administration services
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  for a new $12 million high school campus.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  I've got both their bios here.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  In fact, I was just now reading Richard Gage's
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  bio there.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  Kevin Ryan is an engineer,
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  is a degree engineer.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  He has a BS in chemical certified quality engineer,
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  former site manager for environmental health laboratories,
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  a division of underwriter laboratories,
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  co-editor of the journal 9-11 Studies,
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  contributing author of 9-11 and the American Empire Volume 1.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  Intellectual speak out,
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  and he's a member of Scholars for 9-11 Truth,
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  and I was just reading Richard Gage's bio
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  about a practicing architect for 20 years.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  Designed a bunch of steel frame, large buildings,
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  and they both join us now.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  I appreciate him coming on on such short notice.
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  I have a story up on PrismPlanet.com
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  and Infowars.com leaked NIST documents,
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  unusual event before collapse of WTC7.
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  Yesterday afternoon, we learned about the huge multi-hundred page
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  leaked NIST document.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  They've been delaying releasing it for year after year.
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  They've given five different reasons the towers had fallen,
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  when they've given five different reasons
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  that building 7 had fallen,
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  and now I tried to read over this yesterday,
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  and it seemed like it was contradicting itself,
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  it seemed like it contradicted other partial reports they put out.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  I've had a lot of interesting things in there,
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  but I'm not an architect or engineer,
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  so I thought, why not actually get two experts up on this subject?
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  First off, I do want to say that in my film Truth Rising,
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  we do have an interview with Richard Gage,
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  so he is part of that new film that comes out July 4th,
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  as well at PrismPlanet.tv and on DVD at Infowars.com.
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  But going first to Kevin Ryan,
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  because we haven't interviewed him in a long time,
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  Kevin Ryan worked for Under Radar Lewis Laboratories,
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  found out about a report his company had done
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  where they tested models of the buildings,
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  and it wasn't consistent with a collapse,
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  a symmetrical collapse of these uneven fires,
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  and so he leaked the document and then spoke out about it,
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  and they fired him.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  And so he joins us now.
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  We're coming on, sir.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  Thank you, Alex. Good to be with you.
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  Thank you.
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  Break down a little bit about yourself for those that don't know who you are,
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  a little bit about what happened with Under Writing Laboratories,
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  and then now this whole NIST saga,
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  and then we'll bring Mr. Gage in with his comments as an architect
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  and a comment on this leaked NIST report.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  Okay. Well, yes, as you said,
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  I was top manager at one of the locations of Under Riders Laboratories,
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  and I was fired for publicly questioning the NIST report.
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  Now, this has been almost four years when they had put out their draft
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  final report in October of 2004.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  And as you said, I was questioning that report
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  because Under Riders Laboratories had told me both verbally and writing
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  that they had tested the steel components for the World Trade Center
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  for fire resistance, which is one of the things they do.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  In fact, they had actually tested the steel components of the columns.
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  They had tested the fireproofing itself,
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  as stated by the president of the company who made the fireproofing
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  in the New York Times.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  He said Under Riders Laboratories tested it and certified it,
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  so it shouldn't have failed.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  They also tested assemblies that were similar to the floors used
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  in the World Trade Center.
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  All of this done 40 years ago.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  I was questioning Under Riders Laboratories about how those buildings
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  could have possibly been destroyed in that manner,
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  and I ended up writing a letter to NIST and telling them that
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  the results clearly were not supporting their conclusions
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  and how could this be, and got fired for it.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  Now, that was almost four years ago, as I said,
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  so I've been doing quite a bit to learn more about what happened
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  at the World Trade Center.
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  Kevin Ryan.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  As an engineer, you had a responsibility to talk about this
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  and expose us working there and seeing this internal secret report,
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  and then we look at how the mainstream media and the debunkers
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  won't touch you with a 10-foot pole.
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  They ignore the fact that their internal studies of those that
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  underwrote the building, the experts, the world experts,
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  were saying that something fishy was going on,
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  and so right there we should have a real investigation.
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  Instead, we get these white washes.
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  The debunkers act like we're just here making all this up,
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  and it's completely normal to have three buildings,
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  two of them explode top-down with pyroclastic flows of dust,
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  ejecting steel beams, 50 yards, 100 yards,
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  and then to have buildings seven fall perfectly into its own footprint,
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  that that's just a regular occurrence,
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  and now I'm looking at their own report and it shows fires
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  on one side of the building.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  How does that cause a symmetrical collapse?
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  What's happening with this new report?
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  That's a good find.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  Back about six months ago, NIST had a meeting
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  in which they started to tell us that their objective
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  didn't include determining how the fire started.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  They were just going to talk about how the fires propagated,
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  and this was a meeting that our friend Richard Gage
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  spoke up as a public commenter.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  They started telling us they didn't have to determine how the fire started.
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  They talked about maybe the fireproofing just didn't work.
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  They started saying these are really absurd things,
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  but one thing they did say very clearly and all agreed with
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  was that the fuel in any given location in the building
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  lasted only about 20 minutes.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  So if you look at this report and you see that on the 13th floor,
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  some of these fires started around 230 or three,
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  and then they died down clearly,
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  and then there's this intense jet of flames that they can't explain
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  at 520 right before the building collapsed.
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  You know, all that leads to some serious questioning
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  about where these fires come from,
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  and that leads us back to the finding,
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  and what we do know is that thermite materials
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  were present at the World Trade Center,
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  and thermite materials are what are called pyrotechnic
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  or energetic materials.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  It's kind of like gunpowder where the fuel and the oxidizer
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  are mixed together in one component,
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  and the thermite's like that, except it's much more powerful.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  And as we learn more from the dust,
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  we start analyzing the dust in the laboratories
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  that are participating in this,
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  we're finding just what kind of thermite was used.
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  And so I've done some of that laboratory work,
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  and we seem to be finding that, interestingly,
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  the materials that were present there are linked
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  to a good number of those people who participated
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  in the cover-up of NIST people,
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  and people who participated in this report
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  all have links to these energetic materials.
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  And people who help destroy buildings do?
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  Absolutely. People who cleaned up the events
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  and cleaned up Mark Lozo's company,
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  but also companies that are interested
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  in what are called energetic nanocomposites.
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  Wow, they just so happen,
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  and you've got all the documents on them,
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  and I know Professor Stephen Jones has talked about it.
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  It just so happens with the scientific method,
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  you backtrack all this,
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  and then, lo and behold,
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  the very few groups involved in these materials
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  are the very people cleaning up the mesh
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  and the very people that were charged with covering it up.
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  Boy, that really sounds like a who-done-it.
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  It really is, and I tell you what,
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  the more we look at this,
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  and along with the parallel investigation,
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  which is kind of who possibly could have had access
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  to these kinds of materials.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  And I'm just looking into the connections and so forth.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  We find that, given who we know had access to the buildings,
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  the Kroll Company and the SecureCom Company
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  and Marsh McClell and, you know,
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  companies that either established the security
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  for the buildings or were tenants
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  in the particular areas that had failure.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  And we also look at who had access to the types of materials
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  we're finding in the World Trade Center dust.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:39.000]  We're able to start patching together
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  some really plausible explanations.
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  You know, not exact yet,
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  but a small series of possibilities.
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  And so companies like the scientific applications
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  incorporated, right?
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:56.000]  They were the company that...
[2:17:56.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  You know, I'm sure you know that company.
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:17:59.000]  This is the company that...
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  No, but for our listeners, yeah, go over it.
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  Yeah, this is the company that supplied
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  the largest contingent of investigators
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  to the NIST World Trade Center investigation
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  outside of the government, per se.
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  So there's a huge list of people in the NIST report.
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  Yeah, well, let's be clear.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  Underwriters did their own secret report
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  and their own secret test and found
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  that something went on and it wasn't the fires.
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  And so now, obviously,
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  if one scientific body of the real experts finds a building,
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  they certified and they know something happened.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  Now you get these new guys that come
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  and say the opposite of physics.
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:36.000]  Obviously, they're going to be on some type of take.
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  And then you go look at it and, lo and behold, they are.
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  Well, it sure looks like it because, you know,
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  just look at the top advisory committee for NIST.
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  There's this kind of Foreman Williams,
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  a professor from UC San Diego.
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  And he happens to be an expert
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  on these kinds of thermitic materials.
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  We're having written a number of papers.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  You don't see them on his website at UCSD,
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  but they are out there on the net.
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  You can find these papers on Ignition and Health.
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  And then I've gone and looked at some of these individuals'
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  political policies and their big pro-Israel war hawks.
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  Oh, right.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  Right.
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  We take a look at James Abrahamson,
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  who was a former director of NASA,
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  and has been a director of SecureCom and Stratissek,
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:20.000]  along with Walker and Bush.
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  And, you know, this guy is, you know, he looks rotten to the core.
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  I mean, he's got associations with not only SecureCom,
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  but this crescent group that he runs with a guy
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  who happened to know personally.
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  Osama bin Laden, supposedly.
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:39.000]  And they have the Kroll Company with Jerome Howard
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  and Brian Michael Jenkins.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  And they line those people up with these groups like SAIC.
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  SAIC is a company that Jerome Howard worked for as well.
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  It's a big defense contractor.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:53.000]  Yeah, and so did this Stephen Hatfield guy
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  who was associated with the anthrax attack, right?
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  And they specialize in really complex black ops.
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  They brag about that.
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:02.000]  Absolutely.
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:04.000]  And so they are connected to these, also, these high-tech,
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  thermatic materials.
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:07.000]  God help us.
[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  All right, folks.
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:10.000]  We're going to go ahead and talk during the break
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:11.000]  with the prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:12.000]  Time is of the essence.
[2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  So go to infowars.com.
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  Listen to the stream there.
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:15.000]  Watch online.
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:17.000]  You're going to hear the four minutes behind the scenes.
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  If not, we'll be back with both Richard Gage
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:22.000]  and, of course, Kevin Ryan, both engineers,
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  both one of them are architects on the other side.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:29.000]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning,
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue,
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  or high cholesterol?
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  at the Center for Disease Control reports
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  of suffering from internal parasites.
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  If so, freshwater organics is proud to introduce you
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  to a million-year-old miracle that has been used
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  all over the world by health-conscious individuals
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  seeking alternatives to chemicals and drugs.
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder,
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  is a 100% natural organic product with absolutely no additives.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  When taken daily, it is an excellent source

[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  The U.S. dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  in countries that previously financed the U.S.
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  Economist Rody Boyd published the report Bubble Leaking.

[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  be sure to check out the huge discounts
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  on films like Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement,
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  Most experts agree that the water you drink
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  and regaining your health and energy.
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  cannot survive in an alkaline environment.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH drops now
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  by going directly to alkavision.com.

[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  The enemy is committed.
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  They're coming at us, bringing in World Heritage.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  Those of us that love liberty on the other side,
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  we're committed.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  If you haven't fully committed, it's a great feeling.
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  Like nothing on Earth I've ever felt.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  It transcends even my love for my children,
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  the other strongest feeling in my life.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  It transcends everything. It is timeless.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  You better ask yourselves, who are you?
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  Whose side are you on?
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  Commit.
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  Jump into the fight.
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  Be at a whole other level.
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  Going back to Kevin Ryan,
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  who valiantly found out their own reports in his own company
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  or saying something happened with these buildings.
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  The official story is a lie.
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  And then he gets fired for releasing their secret report.
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  And then now we've got all these black operators
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  running the NIST report.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  And now they leak this internal report.
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  Now do we know this is a real internal report?
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  It sure looks like one.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  Do you have any questions on that?
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  I don't know, Alex.
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  And I've been unfortunately offline for the last three days.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  You've been traveling. What about you, Kevin?
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  Well, it sure does look like it.
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  Alex, and I was notified about this.
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  These reports being available on the NIST website months or so ago.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  I didn't download them myself because I was given the indication
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  that NIST was threatening people who might do that.
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  They were obviously downloaded and leaked.
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  By that, you mean people that know backdoors?
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  Yeah, and FTP links and so forth.
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  Yeah, they're just government so stupid.
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  Look how they carry out the attacks
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  and they can't even cover up their own info.
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  Yeah, and it does look very interesting
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  because they're obviously struggling as we knew they would
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  with any kind of plausible explanation
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  for how this building fell in six and a half seconds.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  God, I wish it wasn't them.
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  Don't you ever wish, Kevin, it wasn't them?
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  I mean, it's so much better if it was 19 guys.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  I don't know. I guess that's the easy way out in one sense.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  But on the other hand, if you think about the fact that
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  the more you learn about this stuff, I know you know this, Alex,
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  that the wars through history appear to have been started by lies
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  and that war is a racket, right?
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  No, I know that, but it's one thing to blow up your ship
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  when the guys are on leave and that's bad enough
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  and start the war which they, or Hitler burning his own Reichstag.
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  That didn't kill anybody.
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  Of course, then you know, or the Gulf of Tonkin
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  where they didn't kill anybody.
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  I mean, then they moved on to the liberty and now,
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  and they just, why?
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  I mean, just to realize they really are killers.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  They really did do it.
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  Scientists like you, architects, engineers have proven it.
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  I mean, I knew it six and a half years ago.
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  I knew it before it happened.
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  I mean, because I saw the chatter and I'm getting ready.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  The point is to really know.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  I mean, to absolutely know you're right.
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  You got it. I mean, does that take your breath away?
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  It absolutely took my breath away five years ago.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  And my mind hasn't changed at all.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  I knew it immediately when first learning about this, I knew.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  I mean, it just all fit together.
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  And of course, the more you learn, go ahead.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  No, go ahead.
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  I'll tell you what takes my breath away is the concern
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  that if they pulled off whoever they are, 9-11,
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  then they have the capability, the intent and the motivation
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  to pull off another one.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  A bigger one.
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  There are more ships amassed in the Persian Gulf right now
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  than there were prior to the Iraq invasion.
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  And there are very well-known plans set for an invasion of Iran.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  And then now you have this weird attempt on Sarkozy.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  I mean, stuff is just crazy.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  It's insane.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  And who will they blame the next one on?
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  I mean, obviously.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  And what will it be?
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  We're promised, basically, by several members
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  of the Bush administration, Congress,
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  and the media of another 9-11-style attack worse
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  than the last one.
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  What will it be, a nuclear weapon?
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  I have never in my gut, not just intellectually, man.
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  I have never in my gut felt that we are in greater danger
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  just as I intellectually analyze things and then ask my gut,
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  you know, a gut check.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  It's like, whoa.
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  I mean, are you guys getting the same feeling in your gut?
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  You have the best gut.
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:26.000]  I do have a bigger gut than you, Richard.
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  Yes.
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:28.000]  And I'll tell you what.
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  You know, there's only so much of the overwhelming fear
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  that a person can deal with.
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  So I think that right now, our best bet is to focus,
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  just focus on facts and focus on...
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:40.000]  No, no, that's what I'm doing.
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  I'm just saying with the geopolitical things,
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  not even the false flag attacks, it's just everybody I talk to
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:48.000]  says they can feel we are on the edge of something big.
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  OK, we're going to focus on the other side of this quick break
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:55.000]  with Kevin Ryan, Richard Gage.
[2:29:55.000 --> 2:29:56.000]  I'm going to give you guys the floor.
[2:29:56.000 --> 2:29:58.000]  I'm not going to be there for 30 minutes.
[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  I'm actually going to go shit out in the other studio
[2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  so I can control myself and not make points
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:04.000]  because I want you guys to go back and forth and talk about
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:06.000]  whatever you think is most important.
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:07.000]  And I'll actually sit here.
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:08.000]  I can shut up if I want to.
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:11.000]  We'll be right back with Kevin Ryan and Richard Gage.
[2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  Just Kevin Ryan blew me away earlier.
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:32.000]  Unbelievable.
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  Free shipping on items over $150, not including heavy items.
[2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:31.000]  No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:34.000]  that reached a third of its national income.
[2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:40.000]  Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.
[2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:43.000]  I think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:46.000]  that were intended for us by the founding fathers.
[2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:53.000]  Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.
[2:31:53.000 --> 2:31:56.000]  Americans for Prosperity and Right Online proudly present
[2:31:56.000 --> 2:32:00.000]  the Texas Defending the American Dream New Media Summit,
[2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:02.000]  Friday and Saturday, July 18th and 19th
[2:32:02.000 --> 2:32:04.000]  at the Renaissance Austin Hotel.
[2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  Join us as we rally the voice of the right
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  to carry our freedom message forward to a new generation.
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  Reserve your spot today at www.defendingtheamericandream.org
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:16.000]  and click on Texas.
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:21.000]  Or you can call 512-476-5905.
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to.
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  This is the last stand on Earth.
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  Hi, my name is August from ASAP Organics.
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:35.000]  ASAP Organics makes an OMRI-listed organic plant fertilizer.
[2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:38.000]  Containing all 14 essential micro-minerals
[2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:40.000]  to grow delicious, healthy food.
[2:32:40.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  ASAP Plant Minerals.
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  Have you noticed a lack of taste in grocery store produce
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:46.000]  compared to the old days?
[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:48.000]  I'm sure you have.
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:50.000]  That's because today crops are grown in huge fields
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:52.000]  that have been stripped of micro-minerals.
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:56.000]  Crops need micro-minerals to construct nutrient phytochemicals
[2:32:56.000 --> 2:32:57.000]  and flavor.
[2:32:57.000 --> 2:33:00.000]  It's that simple, like ASAP Plant Minerals.
[2:33:00.000 --> 2:33:04.000]  ASAP Plant Minerals delivers the exact minerals to soil
[2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:08.000]  that all plants need to construct the phytonutrients we need,
[2:33:08.000 --> 2:33:10.000]  just like the old days.
[2:33:10.000 --> 2:33:12.000]  Look for the big green cross.
[2:33:12.000 --> 2:33:15.000]  We do for plants what the Red Cross does for people.
[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:23.000]  Find us online at ASAPOrganics.com or call us at 877-596-2727.
[2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:27.000]  That's 877-596-ASAP.
[2:33:27.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  You'll be glad you did.
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  Okay, we've got the engineer, Kevin Ryan on with us,
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  the architect and engineer, Richard Gage.
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  Architect, Richard Gage.
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:56.000]  Heads up architects and engineers for 9-Eleven Truth.
[2:33:56.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  400-plus members and growing.
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:02.000]  We'll give out their websites repeatedly before they leave us.
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  There's links right now up on info-works.com.
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:06.000]  Gentlemen, for the next 30 minutes, I want you to talk about
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  whatever issues you want to, whatever you think is most important.
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  But I do want you now to address leaked NIST documents,
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  unusual event before collapse of WTC,
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:18.000]  talk about fire shooting out of nowhere.
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  They talk about fires being stronger hours before it collapsed
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  than when it collapsed.
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  They show how there were only fires on one side of the building.
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  How did that cause us symmetrical?
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  Clearly, it's an internal report because it's making our case.
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  But Kevin, I'm told you've had more time to look over this
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  since it's been out.
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  Give us your take on that.
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  And then both of you back and forth, you've got the floor.
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  Well, yeah, the report, the clear finding in the report
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  is the problem with the fires dying down
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  and then suddenly jets of flame shooting out the windows
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  at the last minute.
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  So that supports the idea of thermatic materials
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  in the buildings as well as the molten metal found
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  in the basements and so forth.
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  And also the laboratory work being done now
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  that I'm a part of, along with Stephen Jones and others
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  in this country and outside of this country.
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  But Richard probably has a good take on the way the buildings fell
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  and what the most important evidence physically is.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  And also with this new leak, NIST has apparently provided
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  numerous additional photos that we have not seen before,
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  provided inadvertently, I should say, I guess.
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  But they do not show any other damage to the building
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  other than these small fires from 4.7 to 13.
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  And what's described as a relatively minimal scoop,
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  that is, damage from World Trade Center North Town.
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  That's right, and it doesn't match other photos
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  that have been circulated.
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  I mean, they've shown buildings that have green faces
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  or gray faces saying it's building 7.
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  Do we know those are fake photos now?
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  Well, most people in the 9-11 Truth Movement have agreed
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  and that's been shown, yeah, that those are fake photos.
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  I guess they did come from NIST or through NIST.
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  I'm not completely sure about that,
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  but the evidence of them being forgeries is apparent
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  and been made clear.
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  I was going to talk about building 7 and how it came down.
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  Some people may yet be unaware that this is the third skyscraper
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  that collapses, in this case, into virtually its own footprint.
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  It was not hit by an airplane.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  We were just talking about the nature of the fires.
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  They were virtually out by the time at 5.20 in the afternoon of 9-11.
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  And all of a sudden, there are witnesses hearing explosions
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  at the base of the building.
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  Kevin McPatten describes the ground shaking.
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  I'm going to grab on to something.
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  By the way, he also describes a countdown, 3, 2, 1,
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  and then these explosions.
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  Now, do fires bring buildings down to countdown?
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  I don't think so.
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  We also have Craig Bartmer of the New York Police Department
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  saying, I think I know an explosion when I hear it,
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  and so he's describing these explosions at the initiation of this collapse.
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  Then let's talk about this collapse, because it happens precipitously.
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  Well, first of all, there is a collapse about 10 seconds prior to the global collapse
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:54.000]  of the East penthouse itself, just imploding virtually straight down through itself.
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  And then 10 seconds later, the entire building, all of a sudden,
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  virtually symmetrically and smoothly, drops and straight down,
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  almost into its own footprint, in about six and a half seconds.
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  And it's been timed.
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  The first two seconds of that drop is indistinguishable in its pace from freefall.
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  This is extremely important, because it tells us that, certainly,
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  in the first two seconds, there is no resistance to this collapse from the 40,000 tons
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  of structural steel that were designed, of course, to resist.
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  Showing that it couldn't be a pancake.
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  It wasn't a few floors falling and then causing the structure.
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  It was freefall from the start of the collapse.
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  That's correct.
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  And how could such a thing happen?
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  Well, the columns, the resistance, the steel columns, have to be removed.
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  And we're talking within a tenth of a second of each other, ideally, within the core structure.
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  There is, what is it, 24 core columns in building 7.
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  And then half a second after that, the perimeter columns have to be removed
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  within a tenth of a second of each other.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  Any problem in the timing of such removal of columns,
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  you begin to have an immediate asymmetrical collapse going on,
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  an angular momentum will take over as the building follows the path of least resistance.
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  So there are plenty of failed controlled demolitions where when it doesn't go right,
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  you see the building going over.
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  This is a science.
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  And this was actually a beautiful example of that science.
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  Fires cannot accomplish this because fire is asymmetrical.
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  It's organic.
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  Fire burns out an area of a building every 20 minutes or so and moves on to another area.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  So when a building does collapse due to fire, what you have is clearly an asymmetrical collapse.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  That is an edge where part of it falls down or a small area collapses, not a perfect fall.
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  Mr. Ryan, any comments on that?
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:14.000]  Well, yeah, I think the comments on the damage are interesting because
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:20.000]  from the noise that NIST has been making in the last six months to a year,
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  it sounds like they're going to come up with a theory called, roughly called a single point of failure
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  that author Ramon Gil-Sance is part of their investigation published in a structural engineering magazine.
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  And what that means is they're going to find one column they think is very critical
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  and somehow cause that to fail by fire, essentially to be the initiating event.
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  And it will be...
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  Let's talk about that column because that column is column...
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  Yeah, let's talk about that column for a minute, Kevin.
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  It's column number 79.
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  And guess how much that column weighs on each of the floors that are said to be at the initiation of this event?
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  It's 15,000 pounds per floor.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  That column has to be heated up to about 1,000 or 1,200 degrees in order to cause any failure.
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  And it was fire-proofed on top of that.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  Right.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  And it's back in the northeast corner, so it wasn't damaged by any of the World Trade Center north.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  And let's be clear.
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  This isn't just Richard Gage or Kevin Ryan's opinion underwriting laboratories.
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  The big cheeses did internal secret tasks.
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  And that's a question for you, Kevin Ryan.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  Talking to your old colleagues when this was going on.
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  I mean, they're scientists, they're engineers.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  I guess they're scared to lose their jobs.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  But what do they say when they can't release their own report?
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  Well, we primarily talked about the towers.
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  But their position was that they were helping NIST.
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  NIST was their client in the investigation, which they did.
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  They built these floor models for the towers and tested them in August 2004.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  So as far as World Trade Center 7, we didn't really discuss that.
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  They wouldn't even touch that one, as I think it's clear that NIST is having a good deal of trouble.
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  But the point is NIST hires underwriters to find out how they collapse.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  NIST says something's wrong.
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  Plains can't do this.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  And then NIST says don't release that.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  Well, underwriters laboratories did perform tests as part of a NIST investigation, and that was included in their report.
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  The tests that weren't included in the report that UL is denying existed were the tests that were done 40 years ago in preparation for building, constructing the buildings.
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  But right now they're trying to explain, without the help of underwriters laboratories,
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  how this one building now collapsed simply from fire and not from damage, which is kind of a twist, I would say.
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:43:01.000]  And I don't know if you agree or not, Richard, but this seems to be kind of a change in course.
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  Well, all of a sudden what it means is if a 20-minute fire can take out a 15,000-pound column
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  and cause the symmetrical freefall collapse of 40,000 tons of structural steel, then all of our codes,
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:24.000]  not only in this country but throughout the world, are in grave jeopardy of all of a sudden being wrong.
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  All of our fire science is wrong.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  All of the codes have to be changed.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  The buildings, all of them have to be upgraded.
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  None of this is being discussed.
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  In fact, some suggestions by NIST for rewriting of codes are being categorically denied as necessary
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  by the American Institute of Architects.
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  Yeah, they're going to extreme lengths trying to come up with this story, and I think they're having a great...
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  I think, frankly, Alex, I think that they're going to wait, as you might suggest,
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:04.000]  until we're too busy with too many other things to finally release this report.
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  Yeah, it will probably never be released.
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  Well, let me go back here as a novice understanding this.
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  We have them claiming now that the rules of science and engineering and architecture have changed.
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:24.000]  How are they going to get away with this with the rest of the scientific community?
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  I guess that's a controversy that has begun.
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  And then you've also got all of the debunkers running around saying that fire did it,
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  and boilers did it, and the building falling into it did it.
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  Now in this new report, they're saying no, just fire.
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  So I want to zoom in on that point and get you guys to elaborate on that,
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  that they're now backing off of many of their previous claims,
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:49.000]  and so I wonder what all these debunking programs are going to say.
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  Well, I think that we touched on the fact that the photographs in this report
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  don't indicate any more damage than any of the other photographs do.
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  So it's very likely they don't have photographs that show extensive damage to the building,
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  so they have to back away from that story,
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:19.000]  and now come up with some sort of a fire-only story for this 47-story building to collapse in six and a half seconds.
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  And I can't imagine any story they can tell that will be sustainable in the eyes of the scientific community.
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  Yeah, and the debunkers are having a very difficult time with this as a result,
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  because they took away two of their pieces of ammunition.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  Diesel fuel-fed flaps were said to have been a part of this,
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  and yet NIST took that away.
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:49.000]  The only diesel fuel on the east side of the building where the initiation of collapse occurred
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  is on the fifth floor where the generators were,
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  but the collapse, they're saying, occurred well above that, and there's no fire,
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  no evidence of fire on the fifth floor.
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  So that was taken away, and of course the damage from the north power was on the south side of the building,
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:13.000]  and apparently not that extensive as per this new leaked documents,
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  and so they took that away.
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  There's no huge scoop out of the building, there's no evidence for that.
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  So we're left contemplating what any fire protection engineer knows,
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:31.000]  and that is a 20-minute fire cannot...
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  Well, first of all, it couldn't even take out the trusses in the World Trade Center either, by the way,
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:43.000]  even unfireproofed, and NIST, excuse me, Underwriter Laboratories actually documented
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  that when they did their four tests of the 35-foot span mock truss composite steel decking samples
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:47:00.000]  that were made to mimic the assemblies in the World Trade Center.
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:04.000]  So that was too much of a digression.
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:06.000]  That was a good point.
[2:47:06.000 --> 2:47:11.000]  One thing I want to make clear, Richard, and you were in this meeting, at least as a public commentator,
[2:47:11.000 --> 2:47:13.000]  is that the December meeting minutes are interesting.
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  If you go to NIST and their World Trade Center website, you'll find the minutes finally they put out
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:23.000]  for the December 18th meeting they had, and they had some tough questioning,
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  even from the advisory committee.
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  Charles Thornton, who was an interesting character on the advisory committee,
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  added at some time in the middle of the investigation,
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  and he was one of the engineers that covered up the Oklahoma City disaster,
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  was asking some pointed questions himself, saying if you don't have fuel in World Trade Center 7,
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:45.000]  how could fires burn for as long as they did,
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  and taking out this major structure that had good fireproofing?
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  That's a pointed question. How could that possibly happen?
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  Not only that, their preliminary hypothesis for the failure of Column 79
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  notes that Column 79 and many of the other core columns were designed to be
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  laterally unsupported for three floors altogether,
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  three floors removed 40 feet high,
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  which means that not only would this fire have had to taken out,
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  it means that the fire would have had to take out the beams that supported the floors,
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  three of them in a row, before this column was unsupported enough to where it would then buckle.
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  There is no plausible scenario whatsoever presented by anybody,
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  presented by anybody that can explain how Column 79 even failed.
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  Well, I would say that if we get back to the fire that they're saying did exist at the moment,
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  just before collapse, after all the office furnishings had burned up,
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  all the fuel is gone, and still there's this fire, jets of flames shooting out the windows.
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  That indicates that there is something other than normal fire there, right?
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  There's some sort of pyrotechnic material.
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  That also is supported by the World Trade Center dust laboratory work.
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  It's also supported by the molten metal, and they had the evidence of sulfidation of the steel.
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  All of this supports pyrotechnic or thermatic materials being present at the World Trade Center.
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  Let's talk about that.
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  Yeah, if we talk about how could that happen,
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  we look into what kinds of thermatic material we could possibly have seen
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  and could have been placed in the World Trade Center buildings,
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  possibly even without being noticed, at least in the terms in the case of the towers
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  that wasn't occupied by so many interesting organizations.
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  But if we look into that, when we find these energetic nanocomposites,
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  which are thermite materials, very powerful on a nano level,
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  not only is the power from the amount of energy released,
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  but also from the rate of energy released because a nanothermite has a composed of nano-aluminum
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  and oxidizers at a nano level where the surface area is very large with respect to the volume,
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  so the reactive area is very large.
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  And that's why they're so explosive and powerful.
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  And also...
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  Now, I think you...let's clarify that.
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  The explosive and the power you're talking about is relative to the twin towers.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  So do you believe that in World Trade Center 7 that we're talking about the non-nano-explosive thermite?
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  Not necessarily. We'd have to have more evidence,
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  but I would suggest that if a nanothermite is placed in the floors of failure of the towers,
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  then why wouldn't it, of course, also be placed in World Trade Center 7?
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  Okay, gentlemen, we've got a pause there for a break,
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  but we're going to continue for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and infowars.com stream listeners during this break.
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  So, for everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes.
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  I want to hold you both five minutes over to the next hour as well,
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:17.000]  because this is so important.
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  I hope everybody's listening. They blew up all three buildings.
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  It's a documented fact.
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:34.000]  Do you understand, ladies and gentlemen?

[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  the elite dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:57.000]  For the first time in history,
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:53:00.000]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  Terms and restrictions apply. See website for details.
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  Quite some time, I've been sitting it out.
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  Didn't take no chances, was a prisoner of doubt.
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  Knocked out the waiting wall, ain't no sin.
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  Got the feel of fortune, deal me in.
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:07.000]  Coming straight on for you. You made my mind.
[2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  The men we've got on the air with us, engineer, architect, are leaders for liberty and freedom.
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  They have the courage. They've lost jobs, lost wives.
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:23.000]  Over this. And they're going straight on at the murders of 3,000 people.
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  They use that for a war that's taken over a million lives of Iraqis and Afghans.
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  They've taken the lives of more than 5,000 U.S. troops, admittedly.
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  Then it's percentage since the number is more like 20,000.
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  We were just talking during the behind the scenes of the prison planet on TV viewers about where all this goes.
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  And we were talking about the black ops. Kevin Ryan wanted to make the point and I agree with him.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  It's not the government. It's criminal elements, rogue groups, but they're in high positions.
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  That's what a coup is. A small group getting key positions and then taking over the rest of the government.
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  How do you see this unfolding, Richard Gage, Kevin Ryan?
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  I mean, now that we've got the proof, their own internal reports, underwriter laboratories reports that were suppressed,
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  showing that these buildings were blown sky high.
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  Where does it go? I mean...
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  Richard?
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  I suppose the only place that it can go is... It won't go anywhere if the American people don't wake up.
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  It won't go anywhere if we don't get the support from your listeners to email the AE911truth.org link
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  to every architect and engineer that they can find.
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  Because this is the group of people right now in the 9-11 Truth Movement that have the necessary credibility
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  to turn the heads in Congress. And if we don't activate them and get to 1,000 architects and engineers by 9-11 2008,
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  we may not be in time to wake enough people up before the next false flag operation.
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  I agree. This is life and death, folks. This is life and death. McCain says another attack.
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  They're going to have basically martial law and a national draft.
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  They're writing... Have you seen all the Republican memos and public statements about how great terror attacks are
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  in the letter from one of the top CFR guys?
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:26.000]  Gary Hart to the Iranians saying, we stage events. You better do what we say.
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  And then we talked to him and he said, yeah, I'm saying the government will stage events.
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  I had Ray McGovern on yesterday saying flat out 9-11 inside job, flat out, they'll stage more.
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  He's not mincing words.
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:43.000]  I mean, Bill Christensen was a CIA section chief in Europe. He says total inside job.
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:51.000]  I mean, it's an inside job. Folks, do you realize what that means? Murderers are in control. Richard Gage.
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:58:01.000]  Well, the architects and engineers have a particular focus, and that is to bring the technical truth to the American people.
[2:58:01.000 --> 2:58:09.000]  We cannot do it without help. I can speak to about 10,000 people a year. That is peanuts.
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:16.000]  What we need to do is reach millions, and we've got to have your viewers sending this link to everybody they know.
[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:21.000]  Yeah, they've got to send the videos of you that are online, the ones that are of Kevin to every architect and engineer,
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:28.000]  not just the website. They need to send terror storm. They need to get the information and not just the architecture and engineers,
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:32.000]  police, military. This is life and death.
[2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  It sure is. And Kevin's doing his role, too. He's doing some incredible research that exposes the nanothermic stuff,
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:47.000]  and who's even responsible behind some of these characters.
[2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:53.000]  I want to do five more minutes on that 60-second break, back at 70 seconds total.
[2:58:53.000 --> 2:59:01.000]  I want to come back and have Kevin Ryan spend a few more minutes specifically tracking the nanopark particulates back to surprise,
[2:59:01.000 --> 2:59:27.000]  the top experts in it are the ones running the investigation.
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:53.000]  Thank you.
[2:59:53.000 --> 3:00:15.000]  Thank you.
[3:00:15.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  Thank you.
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:46.000]  Bottom line, I discovered many years ago that it was declassified, admitted, not debated that criminal elements of our government at the highest levels have staged hundreds of terror attacks in foreign countries to blame it on their enemies.
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  This is pretext of war. And so when I saw the government bomb the Oklahoma City building, when I saw them cook the bomb, train the drivers, provocateur, the first World Trade Center attack, when I saw them getting as hyped up before 9-11, I went on there and I said,
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  look out, they're going to hit the towers, and they did in a big way.
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  Kevin Ryan, member of architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, the founder also Richard Gage with us. Kevin, get back more into tracing back thermate explosive accelerants, thermate, this explosive type of thermite, getting down into nano-sized particulates,
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  the residue found in multiple samples there, and then you look at who's doing the investigation, who's doing the cover-up, and it's top experts in explosive thermite.
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  Spend the last few minutes on that for us, Placer. Okay, great. Yeah, the thermite that I'm most interested in is sprayable.
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  It's a material that was developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and they clearly make it stated that they can spray this on surfaces.
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  And so that relates to the question of how the floors in the World Trade Center that were impacted and had fires in them just happened to match up exactly with the floors of fire-proofing upgrade in 1999 and so forth.
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  Well, in 1999, these scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Lab performed experiments on these energetic nanocomposites at NIST.
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:21.000]  So then, you know, that leads you to the question of how NIST has responded to questions about thermite. They've actually acted like they never heard of it before.
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  You know, we never tested for it. We just never imagined that was a possibility. But of course, that's absurd when you look at Foreman Williams, their leading engineer in their advisory committee, and so forth.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  But if you look at their top directors as well, there was Arden Beeman, who was nominated by George W. Bush in October of 2001, the months after the events, and became the director of NIST shortly thereafter.
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  It was an interesting choice. He was a former deputy secretary of defense and a former director of DARPA's Office of Material Science and a former executive at TRW.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  TRW is a military contractor that is involved in creating gelant materials for energetic nanocomposites.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  He's also connected to very interesting organizations like Battelle. You've probably heard of Battelle, but they're an organization that manages the five national laboratories for the Department of Energy.
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  So the Lord Corporation, he's a director of, they make high-tech coatings. The connections between this guy and the possibilities of what happened at the World Trade Center are extensive.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:54.000]  And we have a second director nominated after Beeman Lee's in November of 2004, and this is Haraj Somerjian. And this is a guy who was the director of NIST's chemical division for years and actually wrote 10 papers with the world's leading expert on energetic nanocomposites.
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  The connection is too clear, and I don't mean to make myself clear. I don't mean to come out and accuse these people today, but I'm just saying that these connections are too clear and too coincidental.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:16.000]  You're nominating people who just happened to have all this experience in what is ultimately being found to be a culprit in the event.
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:34.000]  You have an incredibly specific and rare science with probably only a few hundred people in the world or less that are experts, and you don't just have some of the experts, you have the fathers of these weapons systems who are minions of Bush, pro-war hawks,
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  magically running the investigation and then laughing at you saying, thermite, what? Thermite is an accelerant, thermite to burn down buildings, thermate, you know, acting like you're a kook, and then it turns out they're the masters of it.
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  Right, absolutely. I mean, that's absurd, right? If you look at all the other...
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:57.000]  Stop, stop. You know what? This is too important. I got another guest, Kevin Booth, coming up, but I want to back him up 10 minutes. Can you guys do 10 more minutes?
[3:04:57.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  Sure.
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:05:10.000]  This is too important. I want to come back and finish up with this. You have the world experts in thermite, thermate to burn down buildings to cut pillars.
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:20.000]  You have them doing secret tests with NIST. Now it all comes out. This is before the attacks, and then it's them involved in the cover-up.
[3:05:20.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  I mean, it doesn't get any worse than this, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:30.000]  Now, HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.

[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:54.000]  Alright, final segment with engineer Kevin Ryan who worked in underwriting laboratories.
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  Discovered they had reports they were suppressing about the fact that those fires wouldn't have brought down the towers.
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  Much less building 7, he got fired over that.
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:10.000]  Speaking out, and of course we have Richard Gage who is an architect, builds large buildings.
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  He looked at the evidence, couldn't believe it.
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  He's got over 400 architects engineers now part of his group.
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:22.000]  Before we go any further, man, both give out websites you think are important for people to visit.
[3:09:22.000 --> 3:09:27.000]  Well, we could start with AE911Truth.org.
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  That's www.AE911Truth.org.
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  And then Kevin's got a great website at Scholars.
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:46.000]  We've got a scholars website, STJ911.com, we've got the Journal of 911Studies.com, Journal of 911Studies.com.
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  I've contributed to a book that's coming out again here shortly.
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  It's called The Hidden History of 911.
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:10:01.000]  The editor is Paul Zaremka where I talk about some of the science involved in some of the debunking that went on.
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  What are the websites?
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  I think that should do it.
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:14.000]  Of course, Jim Hoffman's website is excellent as well, WTC7.net.
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  Absolutely, great website.
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  Now continue, Kevin Ryan, with you were getting into another one of these engineers involved in the NIST chicanery and his connections.
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:37.000]  Well, we went through Forman Williams, the lead engineer in the advisory committee, went through the director's beement and submerge in.
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  We talked about SAIC, which is the Science Application International Corporation.
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  And they have connections to Thermite and they were the largest contingent on the NIST investigation outside of the government employees.
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:11:01.000]  They have a company called Applied Ordnance Technology that does research on energetic nanocomposites.
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  And they also were involved in contracts coordinated by a company, not a company, but a military organization called the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Indian Head in 1999 to 2000.
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:23.000]  And they are a creator, they're actually a manufacturer of the materials needed for energetic nanocomposites.
[3:11:23.000 --> 3:11:27.000]  So, you know, there's a lot of connections here.
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  I think you can go to the 9-11 Commission and you see some really interesting connections.
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:44.000]  You see John Layman, who was a 9-11 Commissioner, former Secretary of the Navy, and he just decided to buy a company called Special Devices in 1998
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:47.000]  and then divest in 2001.
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  This is a company that makes explosives for spacecraft, very interesting types of explosives.
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  So, one thing I would say is that energetic nanocomposites and thermite materials are only part of the story at the World Trade Center.
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  There clearly were other explosives.
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:07.000]  Are those special explosive bolts for emergency exits on spacecraft?
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:14.000]  They provide separation joint materials, shape charges for explosives on...
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  You know, the average spacecraft has a great deal of pyrotechnic charges going off throughout its mission.
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  And just to make sure that popular mechanics knows if they're listening, there's no need to run wiring between Cape Canaveral and Mars to make that happen.
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:32.000]  But I think the space connections are...
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:37.000]  That's right, they're always saying there has to be wiring in the building for explosives.
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  I mean, just unbelievable little creatures, but they're the fathers of yellow journalism.
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  They know what they're doing.
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:43.000]  Despicable people.
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  Now, let's go back here.
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  You got into something that I think should be a major headline.
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:56.000]  I mean, you just brought up one of these guys with a company that makes the high-tech thermite nanomaterials.
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:13:05.000]  But earlier, you were talking about the installation by a company connected to all of this of, quote, new fireproofing in 99.
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:07.000]  Let's go back to that.
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  Yeah, I've got a paper that I wrote called Another Amazing Coincidence at the World Trade Center.
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  And it shows how the floors that were upgraded for fireproofing in the towers matched almost exactly with the floors where the plane's impacted
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:29.000]  and the fires, which shouldn't have been there for so long, actually occurred.
[3:13:29.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  And so then we go into looking at the NIST report that talks about this.
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:38.000]  And there were some reports mentioned that aren't available to the public.
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:43.000]  One was made by a company called Burrow-Happold, an engineer and consultant from England.
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:46.000]  They did an investigation of these fireproofing upgrades.
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:53.000]  And as they were going on, as they were starting, and they were suggesting the use of, quote, alternative materials.
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  So let's just speculate on the possibilities for how this could happen.
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  You know, thermitic materials applied underneath fireproofing would work just as well as if they were applied, you know, without fireproofing.
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  And let's not forget this building had the CIA, the FBI, Defense Intelligence.
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  It was all government.
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:19.000]  This was the most spooked-out building anywhere because you had them all together in one building.
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:21.000]  Yeah, and World Trade Center, seven.
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  So if they were using alternative materials for fireproofing, they might use something, for example, intimate paint is something that would be used for fireproofing.
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:33.000]  But if somebody was applying it and they didn't know what it really was.
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  I was about to say, this sounds perfect, where you give them the material, you give them the diagrams on how to apply.
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:39.000]  They don't even know what they're doing.
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  Right, they wouldn't even know.
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  And the materials are resistant to non-intentional ignition.
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  So they have added to them elastomers, which are materials that reduce mechanical impact failure.
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  How would they detonate them?
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  Well, that's a good question.
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:05.000]  Normally, thermite materials are detonated usually by something called a percussion primer, which is a very highly physical impact,
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:17.000]  or by a magnesium ignition, sometimes by something like on the spacecraft that is easier to ignite, called ZPP, zirconium.
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  I forgot the entire name of it, but ZPP is the acronym.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:23.000]  And one other thing that's curious...
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  Of course, this would be tied into Space Command and that whole directorate.
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  That runs the whole Pentagon.
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  Of course, they're using their high-tech brains for this.
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:33.000]  I mean, this is just classic behavior by these people.
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  Well, you might think it's unusual or strange, but if you go back to...
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  When I read David Ray Griffin's first book, The New Pearl Harbor, in 2004,
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:52.000]  the only thing unusual or surprising about that book to me was his suggestion that the motive was for space...
[3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:53.000]  Weaponization.
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:15:54.000]  Weaponization, yeah.
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:56.000]  For weaponization of space.
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:16:01.000]  So then you look through these people who were involved in the company, so they had access to all these things,
[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:03.000]  and you find a lot of connections to space.
[3:16:03.000 --> 3:16:10.000]  You also find a lot of connections to space exploration in the debunkers and the diverters.
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:17.000]  I mean, if you think about it, a lot of people who either work for NASA or they're space exploration buffs.
[3:16:17.000 --> 3:16:19.000]  And again, I'm not trying to accuse anybody.
[3:16:19.000 --> 3:16:23.000]  It's just pretty odd that people who work for NASA and have experience with it.
[3:16:23.000 --> 3:16:27.000]  No, you've just got the world expert in thermate nano everywhere,
[3:16:27.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  every group at applying the special fireproofing, and they're just everywhere.
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:35.000]  But then you bring this up to them, and they say, never heard of thermite.
[3:16:35.000 --> 3:16:36.000]  Right, right.
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:40.000]  They own companies that make it for secret spacecraft activity.
[3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:41.000]  I mean, this is incredible.
[3:16:41.000 --> 3:16:43.000]  Yeah, we never thought of that, and that's why we didn't test for it.
[3:16:43.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  So, oh well.
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:52.000]  Kevin, regarding the impact, the coincidence of the fireproofing upgrades at the impact zones of each tower,
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:59.000]  I think what you're saying is, we have the fireproofing upgrades at floor 95.
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:05.000]  The exact floors that catch on fire, and then this has to admit, right before it collapses, the fires are almost out.
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:08.000]  Then suddenly all over the building, fires blasting out of windows.
[3:17:08.000 --> 3:17:13.000]  I mean, we see the thermite squibs, just like on the towers, you see these sudden fires,
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:17.000]  yellow, red fire shooting out of the side of the building, and molten metal pouring out.
[3:17:17.000 --> 3:17:19.000]  I mean, it's there.
[3:17:19.000 --> 3:17:21.000]  Yeah, it sure seems to be.
[3:17:21.000 --> 3:17:28.000]  My question is, what happens then to the concrete floor slabs below those levels?
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:35.000]  Because I can understand that there was some spray on high-tech nanothermites in the areas of these impact zones,
[3:17:35.000 --> 3:17:40.000]  but what we have is the systematic destruction, the impact zone down.
[3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:43.000]  These guys love cocktails from past operations.
[3:17:43.000 --> 3:17:50.000]  They may have had two or three overlays, and I think the evidence is a novel that shows multiple types of explosives being used.
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:51.000]  Kevin Wright?
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:54.000]  Absolutely. I agree with you. I think we're both on the same page.
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:56.000]  I think that's where Richard is going.
[3:17:56.000 --> 3:18:02.000]  Richard also talked about the upgrades of the elevator shafts by the Ace Elevator Company,
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:10.000]  where, again, we see the unusual case of all the elevator mechanics disappearing after the event,
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:13.000]  when they normally would be the ones to stay and save people.
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:19.000]  And again, we're not trying to accuse these people of anything, but it is unusual how these things all add up.
[3:18:19.000 --> 3:18:21.000]  Yeah, let me stop you. We're out of time.
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:25.000]  I've got to have you up the next few weeks for a two-three-hour presentation, both of you.
[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:27.000]  This is even worse than what I thought.
[3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:29.000]  I mean, I've been reading all your papers and looking at the documents,
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:32.000]  but hearing it all put together, Kevin, Ryan, Richard Gage, you blown me away.
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:35.000]  In closing, something else happened.
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:38.000]  When you guys really got hot on the trail about two years ago,
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:44.000]  and when Jones brought out his evidence, suddenly I saw him get attacked by every quarter by the, quote, crazies,
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:49.000]  and people who hadn't been crazy go crazy, and they all attacked him and Thermate and Thermite.
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:54.000]  And I see that as another key indicator, and how they went after his job and the rest of it.
[3:18:54.000 --> 3:18:59.000]  That's another example of just, they came out of the woodwork when he said Thermate,
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:05.000]  it was like the debunkers just went on overdrive and came out from every angle.
[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:09.000]  I mean, is that not another indicator here?
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:11.000]  Sure seems to be.
[3:19:11.000 --> 3:19:16.000]  Yeah, I would say it is, and I think we're in for an exciting summer because another anniversary is coming up,
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:21.000]  and here that the BBC has another pot shot to take.
[3:19:21.000 --> 3:19:25.000]  Well, they're very deceptive. This guy, Smith guy that's doing them, wouldn't let me talk about Northwoods,
[3:19:25.000 --> 3:19:30.000]  wouldn't let me talk about massing U.S. troops in Uzbekistan, Uzbekistan, the areas I focus on.
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:36.000]  And they then told Dylan Avery that we didn't have footage of Barry Jennings, the deputy emergency manager,
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:40.000]  saying that there were bodies and bombs and stuff, and then we had the video, we've released that.
[3:19:40.000 --> 3:19:43.000]  He begged us not to, but then he went and talked to them.
[3:19:43.000 --> 3:19:50.000]  And so, just very disingenuous, this production.
[3:19:50.000 --> 3:19:55.000]  Well, I'm looking forward to seeing it. They interviewed Stephen Jones and myself,
[3:19:55.000 --> 3:20:02.000]  and I got a call from Mike Bruden of the BBC, who's more involved in this than Guy Smith,
[3:20:02.000 --> 3:20:08.000]  who was involved in the last hit piece, and he told me the scenes that he had lined up to play.
[3:20:08.000 --> 3:20:13.000]  And so, it looks like he's going to play the stuff that we need him to play,
[3:20:13.000 --> 3:20:16.000]  so I'm actually very hopeful this time.
[3:20:16.000 --> 3:20:45.000]  Okay, gentlemen, we'll talk to you very soon. Incredible work. Thank you.

[3:22:24.960 --> 3:22:29.520]  are familiar with the federal reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore
[3:22:29.520 --> 3:22:34.240]  with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on
[3:22:34.240 --> 3:22:38.720]  the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means
[3:22:38.720 --> 3:22:43.440]  only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending
[3:22:43.440 --> 3:22:48.480]  will skyrocket through fdic if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed
[3:22:48.480 --> 3:22:53.520]  by a depressed economy a current effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to
[3:22:53.520 --> 3:22:58.400]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion
[3:22:58.400 --> 3:23:03.520]  and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a
[3:23:03.520 --> 3:23:08.800]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while
[3:23:08.800 --> 3:23:13.840]  paper investments currently have been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over

[3:23:23.440 --> 3:23:28.480]  accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints lack of energy and weight
[3:23:28.480 --> 3:23:33.360]  gain i knew i would have to change to a more alkaline diet but it just seems so difficult
[3:23:33.360 --> 3:23:39.120]  then a friend suggested i try a jupiter water ionizer from sniderhealth.com and detox my body
[3:23:39.120 --> 3:23:45.200]  even before i changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water drinking water now that's something
[3:23:45.200 --> 3:23:49.440]  i can handle the guys at snider health took the time to explain all of the different options and
[3:23:49.440 --> 3:23:54.400]  helped me choose the ionizer that was right for me i use my new jupiter ionizer for everything for
[3:23:54.400 --> 3:23:59.280]  drinking for cooking and since i've been drinking the water i have more energy my joint pains are
[3:23:59.280 --> 3:24:08.880]  gone and i already lost seven pounds and my skin looks great give them a call today at 877-356-2508
[3:24:08.880 --> 3:24:13.440]  to find out which ionizer is right for you they offer a full 30-day money back guarantee and
[3:24:13.440 --> 3:24:18.640]  free shipping so there's absolutely no risk you can visit them on the web at sniderhealth.com
[3:24:18.640 --> 3:24:21.280]  that's snyderhealth.com
[3:24:32.640 --> 3:24:37.360]  there might still be time to turn this around it's gonna hurt everybody
[3:24:37.360 --> 3:24:41.600]  the tyranny is bad for business bad for life
[3:24:46.400 --> 3:24:50.880]  it's even bad for the tyrants they then get assassinated their own police state apparatus
[3:24:50.880 --> 3:24:58.960]  always overthrows them but this happens in history this is the norm
[3:25:01.120 --> 3:25:04.160]  and good people can't admit to themselves the great evil they're witnessing
[3:25:04.160 --> 3:25:09.600]  they have to wait until it fully takes over their life and their society
[3:25:11.040 --> 3:25:15.040]  there's a lot of reasons i got kevin muthon today the drug war is a war against the people the
[3:25:15.040 --> 3:25:19.040]  government ships the majority of the drugs in that's proven his film is really sending
[3:25:19.040 --> 3:25:23.520]  shockwaves across the country we have it at info wars dot com for cheaper you'll find it anywhere
[3:25:23.520 --> 3:25:29.280]  else i hope you'll get an american drug war it's a two-hour film with more than three hours of extras
[3:25:29.280 --> 3:25:35.840]  on one dvd just amazing and it's done in a very balanced way and attacks a lot of angles not just
[3:25:35.840 --> 3:25:39.840]  the government drug dealing but how prescription drugs and alcohol kill thousands of times what
[3:25:39.840 --> 3:25:44.320]  other drugs do and how it's all a big scam and we'll go over that with kevin someday but
[3:25:44.320 --> 3:25:48.880]  you know kevin was good friends with bill hicks his original producer he's got the best selling
[3:25:48.880 --> 3:25:54.480]  book on bill hicks um it's finally in a few newspapers so kevin can talk some about it
[3:25:54.480 --> 3:25:59.920]  uh russell crow one of my favorite actors is going to be uh making a movie about bill hicks
[3:25:59.920 --> 3:26:04.960]  playing bill hicks in the next few years it should be out and also george carlin kind of
[3:26:04.960 --> 3:26:11.040]  remembering him uh all those other serious stuffs happening israel's prodding the us to attack iran
[3:26:11.040 --> 3:26:17.040]  that's cbs news i mean you think four dollar gallon gas is bad try ten conservatively i mean
[3:26:17.040 --> 3:26:20.480]  we're in la la land with bloomberg coming out and saying gold's going to get five thousand
[3:26:20.480 --> 3:26:25.600]  an ounce that means they think world war three mccain's talking about world war three i hope this
[3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:30.240]  doesn't happen but they are strongly this makes the cuban missile crisis look like a game of
[3:26:30.240 --> 3:26:38.480]  tiddlywinks going to kevin booth uh kevin so much is happening man so much is going on yeah i agree
[3:26:38.480 --> 3:26:44.960]  i agree it's uh it's it's spinning can faster and faster definitely we're gonna talk about your film
[3:26:44.960 --> 3:26:48.000]  and i'm gonna have you back up in the next few weeks because there's to take calls people want
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:52.480]  to hear from you but but but right now uh just because it's interesting we might as well fiddle
[3:26:52.480 --> 3:27:02.000]  while room burns uh but but uh but bill hicks was a anti-establishment icon uh i mean how much can
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:05.280]  you tell us about the russell crow stuff i mean you've told me a lot but i don't want to say anything
[3:27:05.280 --> 3:27:09.840]  in case it's off record well it's it's still pretty much early in the development i believe uh
[3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:17.040]  russell crow decided that he wanted to he just got it in his head that he wanted to be
[3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:24.000]  bill hicks on stage and he started i guess having fantasies about about uh you know portraying bill
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:29.040]  hicks in a small club and being like the angry guy on stage and the whole thing and and they
[3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:34.560]  they've been through a lot of different uh generations of how this film would go they first
[3:27:34.560 --> 3:27:39.120]  started thinking like it would be like this big long performance piece and and they realized the
[3:27:39.120 --> 3:27:44.400]  more they worked on it that it had to become more like just a normal film uh i believe they
[3:27:44.400 --> 3:27:48.560]  voted on the rights the life rights for a while to do this so they've been tickering with this for a
[3:27:48.560 --> 3:27:54.160]  while so it's it's really still in its early stages but it does look like it's going to happen um
[3:27:54.880 --> 3:27:58.800]  you know it looks like it's it's probably going to happen with somebody like russell crow behind
[3:27:58.800 --> 3:28:04.160]  it and all that so uh you know you are holding your cards close to the vest kevin yeah i mean
[3:28:04.160 --> 3:28:08.800]  it's been in a few publications that russell crow's making it uh and and and what we're looking
[3:28:08.800 --> 3:28:14.080]  for march of oh nine yeah i gotta be right now a script doesn't even exist yeah so they keep getting
[3:28:14.080 --> 3:28:18.800]  behind on it yeah i mean i you know the guy i mean the guy was just here at my house the other day
[3:28:18.800 --> 3:28:23.520]  working on the script so i mean yeah you know i know i know that there's not even a script yet
[3:28:23.520 --> 3:28:28.960]  to read so um well that's the thing is it's such a love affair for russell crow that he wants to
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:34.960]  make it perfect and sometimes if you try that with something it never happens yeah so it's um
[3:28:34.960 --> 3:28:40.160]  um you know it'll be interesting i i i do know once they you know they get to synopsis up and
[3:28:40.160 --> 3:28:45.120]  running this guy by the name of mark stoffer who uh i believe his old buddies with russell in fact
[3:28:45.680 --> 3:28:49.360]  when you talk to him on the phone you think you're talking to russell and yeah he's one of the ranch
[3:28:49.360 --> 3:28:54.720]  guys from out there in australian is yeah he's yeah he's from new zealand and um um he looks
[3:28:54.720 --> 3:28:59.280]  like russell and sounds like russell i've known him for a long time and and so he's just kind of
[3:28:59.280 --> 3:29:05.920]  one of uh i guess russell's homey you would say and double ganger yeah yeah he's he's been out here
[3:29:05.920 --> 3:29:09.840]  in la for about four years i think he wrote one other script for russell right now russell
[3:29:09.840 --> 3:29:16.000]  is finishing this movie uh uh called knottingham i think big uh mega blockbuster and then and then
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:20.240]  after he's done with that he's gonna put his full-time attention on this and i believe it's with a
[3:29:20.960 --> 3:29:26.080]  uh smaller company called weed road or something like that um it's a production company that has
[3:29:26.080 --> 3:29:31.760]  something to do with a beautiful mind well kevin this is super exciting and uh i'm just glad that

[3:39:42.960 --> 3:39:47.920]  the democrats want to use your american drug war film to go after him yeah that's true i've been
[3:39:47.920 --> 3:39:52.720]  contacted by the head of the democratic party there and americopa county and and uh they've
[3:39:52.720 --> 3:39:58.000]  they've got a new guy that they want to put against them but you know uh usually in a
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:02.400]  sheriff race you wouldn't even hear about this until september with the election being in november
[3:40:02.400 --> 3:40:08.880]  but with sheriff joe uh being in a sex sixth term going for a seventh term uh it's going to take a
[3:40:08.880 --> 3:40:14.000]  lot to turn the tides on this guy you know there's just the the recent deal where we were just talking
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:21.120]  about on the internet break uh about how you know sheriff joe has been purchasing land paying for
[3:40:21.120 --> 3:40:26.240]  cash he's been you know buying it's on the books over a million dollars for the property using cash
[3:40:26.240 --> 3:40:33.120]  money and this is a guy on a fixed government income uh and so these guys the local press the
[3:40:33.120 --> 3:40:38.080]  new times in phoenix went after them they they pulled some court documents and then sheriff joe had
[3:40:38.080 --> 3:40:42.480]  these guys arrested in the middle of the night hauled off in some unmarked vehicle with mexican
[3:40:42.480 --> 3:40:48.480]  license plates and uh because of that it's it's created a new outrage in the phoenix area but
[3:40:48.480 --> 3:40:54.400]  still with uh with all the conservatives there in the phoenix area um you know it's facing phoenix
[3:40:54.400 --> 3:40:59.920]  being one of the last places to have mlk day on and on uh it ain't gonna be easy to to get them out
[3:41:03.360 --> 3:41:10.000]  continue with that kevin well you know i mean that's uh you know so that they're gonna they're
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:16.560]  gonna create a series of ads using my film and and uh i just i just think i urge anybody in the in
[3:41:16.560 --> 3:41:23.680]  the maricopa uh area anybody who's a voter to uh get involved with this and because it's gonna
[3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:29.200]  it's gonna take it's gonna take a lot you know i mean this this is the guy that has created a
[3:41:29.200 --> 3:41:37.840]  local empire um from fighting the drug war from you know being he's made himself popular he's
[3:41:37.840 --> 3:41:46.480]  he's like a regular personality now on fox news on on on cnn on um on all these shows i mean this
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:52.080]  this guy's using a taxpayer's money to run a full-time pr team for himself to make himself
[3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:58.800]  into the celebrity guy and uh and the locals just love them they just love them love them love them
[3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:05.840]  because they they see it as like he's tough on crime and and uh and really i mean he's he's profiting
[3:42:05.840 --> 3:42:10.800]  from you know the more drug seizures that they can make i mean every time they you know i mean how
[3:42:10.800 --> 3:42:15.680]  is it that kevin you're believing his pr firm bro the people don't like share of joe arpaio
[3:42:16.880 --> 3:42:21.280]  i mean you may have liked the people they're all about to die who are like at 90 years old who
[3:42:21.280 --> 3:42:27.040]  you know believe the television set but that's about it yeah well i know a lot of people in phoenix

[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:18.000]  well that's why i mean to everybody that you know like everybody out there listening to this
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:23.200]  you you have family you have friends that that believe in what the other side is doing
[3:44:23.920 --> 3:44:29.040]  those are the people you need to talk to you know i i try to talk to my relatives and friends and
[3:44:29.680 --> 3:44:34.400]  and and just say you know people that are still bush supporters even and and go what are you
[3:44:34.400 --> 3:44:39.040]  getting out of this i mean you know you you belong to this team you you're you're still
[3:44:40.080 --> 3:44:44.320]  for this is like what is it doing for you and they you know they're just scared they're all
[3:44:44.320 --> 3:44:49.600]  really just they're just afraid is really what it's all about and so they want to they think like
[3:44:49.600 --> 3:44:54.560]  belonging to the the winning team be a part of the big winning team is what's going to save them
[3:44:54.560 --> 3:44:58.800]  in the end well wait till the democrats get in office kevin it's going to be a new winning
[3:44:58.800 --> 3:45:03.120]  team with that and all the bush agenda is just going to continue with different window dressing
[3:45:03.120 --> 3:45:09.760]  and suddenly democrats are going to love the military commissions act watch watch yeah but you
[3:45:09.760 --> 3:45:13.760]  know what are you going to do though i mean would you rather have that or mccain i mean i don't know
[3:45:13.760 --> 3:45:18.720]  well i'd rather have it's like you want to be shot in the head with a shotgun or a 30 odd six
[3:45:18.720 --> 3:45:24.080]  you know i don't want to be shot in the head it's it's a we have to recognize it's a false choice
[3:45:24.080 --> 3:45:30.640]  yeah no i know that i know that i know but but still i mean looking back i mean i i still have to
[3:45:30.640 --> 3:45:35.600]  wonder what would be the difference right now had it been carry or bush for the last four years
[3:45:35.600 --> 3:45:40.720]  you know i mean maybe it would be just de-accelerated exact same thing exactly at its stage the attack
[3:45:40.720 --> 3:45:47.680]  same deal maybe a little slower though maybe a little slower i don't know maybe only because
[3:45:47.680 --> 3:45:52.400]  conservatives real grassroots conservatives are the ones that fight gun control open borders
[3:45:53.120 --> 3:45:57.840]  police state in the past and that they knew they had to have a republican in so they would all be
[3:45:57.840 --> 3:46:03.200]  pacified and because yeah i mean the democrats would have tried to triple it's now triple it was
[3:46:03.200 --> 3:46:08.880]  doubled five years and it's now tripled the size of the federal government tripled in seven and a
[3:46:08.880 --> 3:46:13.600]  half years republicans would have never put up with that but when bush does it's i love triple the
[3:46:13.600 --> 3:46:23.200]  government it's good oh yeah baby shut up communist yeah i know exactly yeah i heard the communist thing
[3:46:23.200 --> 3:46:29.600]  that's um what about george carlin now it's very sad you know i just got to show though
[3:46:29.600 --> 3:46:35.520]  that if a if a 71 year old man uh can just suddenly drop dead i think george is probably
[3:46:35.520 --> 3:46:41.280]  in much better shape than mccain uh you know there's a reason i don't want to have a 75 year old guy
[3:46:41.280 --> 3:46:46.560]  and to be the president but uh well i'll tell you this obama will not live long and hillary's
[3:46:46.560 --> 3:46:52.080]  his vp he's gotta be smart enough to know that crocodile right there boy yeah no it'll be it'll
[3:46:52.080 --> 3:46:58.480]  be amazing if obama can survive for a year now it'll you know i mean it'll be it'll be crazy to see
[3:46:58.480 --> 3:47:04.960]  what happens if he gets in but um now they'll probably kill him and have a white supremacist
[3:47:04.960 --> 3:47:09.440]  mind control god do it and then they'll ban guns because of it and black folks will burn down every
[3:47:09.440 --> 3:47:14.960]  city in the country then they'll use that for martial law it's anyway you cut it it's it's
[3:47:14.960 --> 3:47:20.080]  i think george carlin's right i think the country's done george carlin you know you gotta give it to
[3:47:20.080 --> 3:47:27.200]  i mean he george carlin was talking about this stuff back in the 70s you know i mean um you know
[3:47:27.200 --> 3:47:33.040]  i would definitely say that george carlin was a the godfather of a lot of this movement right now
[3:47:33.040 --> 3:47:39.840]  and i think a lot of people owe a lot to him and um well i'm not big on his atheist thing uh but uh
[3:47:40.480 --> 3:47:45.200]  at the same time i mean saying how they're dumbing you down on purpose and the wars and i mean i
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:49.680]  think bill hicks got a lot from him didn't he oh yeah absolutely i mean i i you know i can't imagine
[3:47:49.680 --> 3:47:55.680]  that anybody you know trying to do that that brand of that or that breed of comedy is will
[3:47:56.400 --> 3:48:02.320]  sit there and say that they don't owe a lot to george carlin i mean um and charlton heston george
[3:48:02.320 --> 3:48:08.320]  carlin been a bunch of other high profile deaths this year yeah but you know and i but i would say
[3:48:09.280 --> 3:48:14.400]  a richard prior to me richard prior and george carlin were the kings you know and and although
[3:48:14.400 --> 3:48:18.880]  lennie bruce has gotten all the aquilates for being the the guy that broke all these boundaries i have
[3:48:18.880 --> 3:48:23.200]  to admit when i go back and listen to lennie bruce albums like they're just not that funny to me
[3:48:23.840 --> 3:48:29.360]  it's not funny it's not funny yeah i mean you know richard prior is funny yeah richard prior is
[3:48:29.360 --> 3:48:34.480]  amazing you know richard prior didn't you talk to richard prior i got to like kind of communicate

[3:56:14.000 --> 3:56:18.880]  and i thought that i asked him if he knew who bill hicks was and i thought that he said yes right
[3:56:18.880 --> 3:56:23.040]  so it turns out this guy who was doing editing for me through these other people knew his home
