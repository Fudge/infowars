[00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:06.155]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.155 --> 00:00:07.937]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.937 --> 00:00:09.698]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.698 --> 00:00:11.280]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.821]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:17.025]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:21.088]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:27.839]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.041]  It is Tuesday, the 14th day of September 2010.
[00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:41.689]  We have civil rights icon, one of the only living civil rights icons, who's actually there on the front lines, Dick Gregory, joining us.
[00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.250]  He's gone completely public for 9-11 Truth.
[00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:44.731]  I don't know.
[00:00:59.349 --> 00:01:04.070]  The producer got him on the phone and I said, hey, I want to talk to Mr. Gregory.
[00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.831]  And I said, sir, I admire a lot of your work standing up against tyranny and being the change you want to see in the world.
[00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:13.072]  And he said, well, Dr. Jones.
[00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.112]  And I said, I'm not a doctor.
[00:01:14.112 --> 00:01:17.533]  And he goes, I know, but you're a doctor of reality.
[00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.073]  And I admire you and the work you're doing.
[00:01:20.073 --> 00:01:21.914]  So just amazing Dick Gregory, who
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.640]  He has a lot of courage, folks.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.522]  I don't agree with him on all of his ideas and policies, but the point is, he's somebody who stood up for human liberty and dignity, and I respect him for that.
[00:01:33.522 --> 00:01:40.643]  To have him be an admirer of our courage and what we do, that was his words, is just amazing.
[00:01:40.643 --> 00:01:47.685]  It shows the huge effect that transcends race, religion, region, basic liberty.
[00:01:48.513 --> 00:01:50.175]  Basic freedom.
[00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:51.476]  So that's coming up.
[00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:53.979]  Obviously gold has hit an all-time high.
[00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.541]  Silver hitting an all-time high.
[00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:59.905]  We told you a couple months ago this was going to happen in the fall.
[00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:01.166]  Because we know the cycles.
[00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:04.490]  We understand how the central banks manipulate all of this.
[00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.310]  That's coming up.
[00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:09.752]  Also, I mentioned this yesterday, but now it's really big news.
[00:02:09.752 --> 00:02:20.374]  Of course, it's old news to our audience in the last decade or plus, but Ministry of Defense probes claim that soldiers are smuggling heroin from Afghanistan.
[00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:22.734]  Probing the claim?
[00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:25.554]  Probing the claim?
[00:02:25.554 --> 00:02:33.636]  That's like probing the claim that last Thursday night, the Vikings and the Saints played in New Orleans.
[00:02:34.952 --> 00:02:38.735]  It's a fact they played in New Orleans.
[00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:49.323]  In plain view, the CIA told Spy Talk three months ago in the Washington Post that they put out fake Bin Laden videos.
[00:02:49.323 --> 00:02:57.270]  Governor Ridge came out and wrote a book admitting they put out fake terror alerts for political purposes to scare the population into submission.
[00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.855]  And AP, Reuters, BBC, Fox News, they go out and say, yes, the Marines and Army helped grow the opium.
[00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:06.490]  This is how we win the hearts and minds.
[00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.235]  So of course they're also shipping it out.
[00:03:11.235 --> 00:03:22.166]  Tens of thousands of tons of pure heroin being processed out of opium every year flooding the streets of Europe and the United States and Russia and Japan and China.
[00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:26.751]  Opium production is up more than 12-fold since 2001 and the invasion.
[00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:35.403]  Our government takes over, been caught bringing in cocaine in the 60s, heroin in the 60s, cocaine in the 80s.
[00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:44.352]  I mean, there's congressional hearings in 1996 with the CIA Inspector General apologizing for it.
[00:03:44.352 --> 00:03:47.816]  I don't like heroin and cocaine.
[00:03:47.816 --> 00:03:51.560]  In fact, when I broke my leg and had to have surgery, I wouldn't even take the pain pills.
[00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:52.805]  I don't know.
[00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:19.576]  Drugs are illegal, it's imploding because it drives the price up, the criminals come in, they buy off the government, society implodes.
[00:04:19.576 --> 00:04:25.641]  So I wanna go back over that today as well.
[00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:29.944]  And when we return from break, I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this.
[00:04:29.944 --> 00:04:34.607]  I'm making a film on the subject because it's so important.
[00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:39.451]  And when the film comes out, that will chronicle what we're talking about here.
[00:04:40.724 --> 00:04:43.324]  But I've done something I should have done a long time ago.
[00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.111]  And I'll break it down when we get back.
[00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:51.653]  This is very frightening, and it's the biggest threat we face domestically.
[00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:53.434]  We'll explain it on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:53.434 --> 00:04:56.575]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:56.575 --> 00:04:58.176]  I tip my hat to the Drudge Report.
[00:04:58.176 --> 00:04:59.216]  Another big link today.
[00:04:59.216 --> 00:04:59.836]  Thank you, Drudge.
[00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:04.218]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.

[00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.071]  We're good to go.
[00:06:03.707 --> 00:06:04.968]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:04.968 --> 00:06:08.832]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:08.832 --> 00:06:11.135]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:17.001]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:23.227]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:23.647 --> 00:06:29.630]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.812]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:33.812 --> 00:06:38.095]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.095 --> 00:06:44.058]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.058 --> 00:06:47.600]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.581]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:50.021]  It's here.

[00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:03.535]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:07:03.535 --> 00:07:09.940]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:17.326]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:22.209]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:24.331]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:28.614]  It's founder and owner for over 63 years.
[00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.896]  People keep asking me, how's business?
[00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:33.177]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:07:33.177 --> 00:07:33.498]  Call us.
[00:07:46.847 --> 00:07:47.227]  At 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:47.227 --> 00:07:58.091]  Visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:07:58.091 --> 00:08:05.033]  Thank you.
[00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:11.075]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:13.636]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.937]  Life is a test.
[00:08:17.937 --> 00:08:21.440]  You're only alive one time.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:28.985]  And we all make decisions in life on what we're going to stand for.
[00:08:28.985 --> 00:08:32.408]  What side we're going to be on in history.
[00:08:35.055 --> 00:08:44.458]  And I want to get into the opium production in Afghanistan and all the evidence of the fact that the British and U.S.
[00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:54.282]  governments, the private corporations that control them, and the private contractors are producing and growing and protecting the opium fields and shipping this garbage into our nations.
[00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:59.420]  Also, the United States Joint Forces Command warns that huge U.S.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.626]  debt may lead to military impotence, default, and revolution.
[00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:06.090]  What did the British Ministry of Defense say three years ago?
[00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.392]  Same thing.
[00:09:07.392 --> 00:09:10.256]  The IMF is worried about total implosion and revolution.
[00:09:11.155 --> 00:09:18.558]  That's like if somebody goes and pours gasoline all over your house and lights a fire, then they call the fire department and say, I'm worried a fire may start.
[00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.799]  The fire's already burning and they started it.
[00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:28.402]  But now they're posing as our saviors in this emergency reorganization where they openly set up world government.
[00:09:28.962 --> 00:09:30.083]  We're good to go.
[00:09:45.914 --> 00:09:49.335]  And of course, gold prices surge to their all-time record of 1,270.
[00:09:49.335 --> 00:09:54.717]  Gold and silver explode as banksters abandon market manipulation.
[00:09:54.717 --> 00:09:57.458]  Infowars.com, key report on that.
[00:09:57.458 --> 00:10:00.099]  Yen hits 15-year high versus the dollar.
[00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:03.340]  Bloomberg, gold reaches record, stocks fall on economy concern.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:03.880]  Yen gains.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.900]  That's all coming up.
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:22.185]  And the key, Sunday, on the Sunday broadcast, I went after Republican leader Boehner, who had made a statement saying that he would support just a, quote, middle class tax cut and allow the tax on the rich to go through.
[00:10:22.185 --> 00:10:26.747]  Of course, the rich, they say, are $125,000 individually yearly.
[00:10:26.747 --> 00:10:28.747]  After taxes, that's about $70,000.
[00:10:28.747 --> 00:10:30.548]  That's not rich.
[00:10:30.548 --> 00:10:32.148]  Couples, quarter million, $250,000.
[00:10:33.869 --> 00:10:43.473]  That's the main group still buying cars, going to hotels, going to restaurants, putting their children in private school, going to the shopping mall.
[00:10:46.175 --> 00:10:46.635]  We're good to go.
[00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:17.972]  But the globalist on record.
[00:11:19.468 --> 00:11:24.912]  And I had Mark Moreno on yesterday reading the quotes out of the New York Times, said, yes, we want to shut the economy down.
[00:11:24.912 --> 00:11:29.314]  We want to reduce the economy to have a lower carbon footprint.
[00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:35.459]  No, they want to shut off the economy to bankrupt you and force you on the government subsidy so they control you.
[00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:36.739]  It's called serfdom.
[00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:46.186]  But Boehner has come out in Business and Media newspaper and said, Obama and Congress intentionally spending to force value-added tax.
[00:11:47.959 --> 00:11:57.547]  And there's also a New Hampshire Senator, Judd Gregg, is also saying the same thing, that they want to bankrupt the economy to force a total takeover of society.
[00:11:57.547 --> 00:12:00.030]  So we're actually getting honesty now.
[00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:13.121]  And it's the alternative media and libertarian media and true conservative media, constitutional media, the Constitution Party, Oath Keepers, Chuck Baldwin, Ron Paul, myself, Judge Andrew Napolitano and others, who've got the true
[00:12:14.076 --> 00:12:27.258]  Credentials of Liberty, who've never flip-flopped on freedom, that are forcing this to happen right now, and forcing the Democrats to try to keep their move to get rid of these tax cuts in place.
[00:12:27.258 --> 00:12:41.261]  Then there'll be an even bigger implosion in the House and Senate, they'll lose almost all their seats, and we'll get some real patriots, a lot of these candidates are actually good, in there, and then we can not just get rid of the tax increases, but cut even more.
[00:12:44.218 --> 00:12:46.999]  See, you can't compromise, folks.
[00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:56.184]  Many of the founding fathers put out the quote in different variations of, justice be done, though the heavens may fall.
[00:12:59.013 --> 00:13:10.503]  I heard a talk show host yesterday saying, oh, well, you know, even if there's evidence of 9-11 being an inside job or the government having prior knowledge and letting it happen or whatever the case is, you know, should we allow this to come out?
[00:13:10.503 --> 00:13:14.807]  This could destroy total confidence in the government and everything could collapse.
[00:13:14.807 --> 00:13:15.788]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:15.788 --> 00:13:22.774]  I don't think that's the case, but the corrupt forces that have taken over our government, they will collapse.
[00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:25.808]  I mean, that's the issue.
[00:13:25.808 --> 00:13:30.251]  You've got to do the right thing no matter what happens.
[00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:37.036]  And I go back to this, and I want to talk about this now that I'm getting into the economy and a lot of other key issues.
[00:13:37.036 --> 00:13:38.797]  Because it's important.
[00:13:38.797 --> 00:13:52.707]  I don't really know anybody else who's ever been in a syndicated talk show host position who's been offered to be a big, giant national host, who's basically been offered the job that Glenn Beck has before Glenn Beck was even on the scene.
[00:13:55.615 --> 00:14:00.457]  And it wasn't hard for me to say no to those offers.
[00:14:00.457 --> 00:14:04.559]  Because I was told, you'll just be a mainline firebrand Republican.
[00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:06.500]  No more of this conspiracy stuff.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.521]  Besides, Alex, we know it's just a stick.
[00:14:08.521 --> 00:14:09.682]  We know you don't mean all this.
[00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:12.803]  And I'm like, of course I mean all this.
[00:14:12.803 --> 00:14:15.044]  See, I care about the truth.
[00:14:15.044 --> 00:14:18.166]  And I care about my family and my family name.
[00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:19.587]  I was thinking about this this weekend.
[00:14:20.498 --> 00:14:28.444]  I had this image or almost vision in my mind of being an old man and having a heart attack and collapsing down on the grass.
[00:14:28.444 --> 00:14:34.909]  In this vision or this image I had in my mind, I pictured myself as an old man and it was so real.
[00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:39.550]  And I was collapsing, having a heart attack, and I was in great pain.
[00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:56.093]  And as I fell onto the grass, I had this last parting image of my healthy grandchildren, of my children, of a safe society, of a society that guards liberty and honor, and defeating the globalists.
[00:14:56.093 --> 00:15:04.095]  And that if I can just die, knowing that we made the world a better place than we left it, then that's total victory.
[00:15:06.718 --> 00:15:14.385]  And I had that intense image, and it was really a great comfort.
[00:15:14.385 --> 00:15:15.646]  That is fulfillment.
[00:15:15.646 --> 00:15:21.130]  It's not houses, or cars, or women, or power.
[00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:31.139]  And last night, we were up here researching government psychological warfare manuals written by Edward Bernays and others, and it was going back almost 90 years ago.
[00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:32.060]  It was about 1920 or so.
[00:15:35.407 --> 00:15:43.546]  This particular document, and Bernays said media is honored in the United States, newspapers mainly, and radio is being developed.
[00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:53.544]  Media is honored for being muckrakers, for really telling the truth, for exposing corruption and letting the chips fall where they may.
[00:15:53.544 --> 00:15:55.525]  And that's the newspapers people buy.
[00:15:55.525 --> 00:16:00.447]  And he said, how we're going to get them is, we're going to start these press correspondence dinners.
[00:16:00.447 --> 00:16:02.348]  And Bernays started it in 1920.
[00:16:02.348 --> 00:16:12.512]  And he openly said, with the Department of War and with the White House, they said, we'll get, we'll have big dinners every month in New York and in D.C.
[00:16:12.512 --> 00:16:13.312]  and in Chicago.
[00:16:13.312 --> 00:16:14.873]  Those were the big three main cities at the time.
[00:16:16.218 --> 00:16:31.172]  And we'll bring them in and influence pedal and let them be with the movie stars that were emerging and with famous writers and with the politicians and smooths with the bankers so that it's a social club like a fraternity.
[00:16:31.172 --> 00:16:38.058]  And so these people will be afraid to expose corruption or they won't be invited to the party.
[00:16:38.058 --> 00:16:42.282]  And then at the parties, they can basically be bought off by these clicks.
[00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:55.774]  And I was watching a correspondence dinner from last year with Glenn Beck wearing a skull and crossbones cummerbund or corset.
[00:16:55.774 --> 00:17:04.079]  And I was watching the Democrats, the Republicans, all of them together, and I was going back to what Jesse Ventura said in Obama Deception about how it's like professional wrestling.
[00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.120]  During the day, they get up there and fight with each other.
[00:17:07.523 --> 00:17:08.684]  Republicans and Democrats.
[00:17:08.684 --> 00:17:27.124]  But at night, they go out and have dinner and get drinks together, and their daughters and sons marry each other, and, you know, Mary Madeline's married to Carvel, and you've got these other families where one brother's the Republican strategist, the other brother's a Democratic strategist, and they're just playing the field.
[00:17:27.124 --> 00:17:29.886]  And that's what Fox News does with its different holdings.
[00:17:30.427 --> 00:17:37.159]  They'll put out a globalist, carbon-taxing, anti-gun message on TV, but put out, we're conservative on Fox News.
[00:17:37.159 --> 00:17:38.442]  Owning the market.
[00:17:38.442 --> 00:17:39.523]  Owning the full spectrum.
[00:17:40.677 --> 00:17:57.344]  And I was watching the correspondence dinners as they're led into the big facility, and they let fans in to cheer and yell, and the news camera shows them, that's the image of the public who's watching the TV, that's the mirror image of them, that this is important, that this is what matters.
[00:17:57.344 --> 00:18:03.167]  And then the Hollywood people, the music stars, the TV stars, these racehorses,
[00:18:03.607 --> 00:18:16.957]  Being led in and puffing up and getting off on talking to the media and getting off on being seen by the crowds and being led in to be compromised all together in this spectacle.
[00:18:16.957 --> 00:18:25.944]  And then I'm reading the warfare manuals how they did it.
[00:18:25.944 --> 00:18:27.706]  And so that's the issue here.
[00:18:28.976 --> 00:18:52.955]  Not only have I refused to sell out to all of that, we've gone in and created a third way versus the fake left and fake right and Hollywood is on fire with many of the biggest names who now are obsessed with the New World Order, global government, eugenics, they know all this information and there's a fight in Hollywood going on at least the last six years
[00:18:53.675 --> 00:19:11.304]  With the old line producers and the big corporate owners trying to threaten and suppress a total revolt of all the Hollywood people to stop playing the part of fake liberals and eugenicists and to break out and say no to James Cameron and say no to Steven Spielberg.
[00:19:11.304 --> 00:19:14.406]  I mean, I have this directly.
[00:19:14.406 --> 00:19:20.129]  You heard Michael Braverman, you know, big TV producer, without me even bringing it up, say this a few months ago on the show.
[00:19:21.124 --> 00:19:22.606]  I mean, you wouldn't believe the names.
[00:19:22.606 --> 00:19:24.008]  I can tell you Bruce Willis.
[00:19:24.008 --> 00:19:25.530]  I can tell you Keanu Reeves.
[00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.496]  I can tell you Charlie Sheen, Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura.
[00:19:29.496 --> 00:19:31.178]  I can tell you Woody Harrelson.
[00:19:31.178 --> 00:19:36.265]  I can tell you some of those names, but the other ones are even bigger.
[00:19:36.265 --> 00:19:37.247]  Okay, I'll tell you.
[00:19:37.247 --> 00:19:37.867]  Brad Pitt.
[00:19:38.592 --> 00:19:40.153]  You want me to keep going?
[00:19:40.153 --> 00:19:44.797]  But they're still scared to go totally public, because if they do, they'll be destroyed.
[00:19:44.797 --> 00:19:50.121]  We're taking their icons away, getting them to free their own minds.
[00:19:50.121 --> 00:19:53.103]  We're this close to victory, folks, if you'll just realize that.
[00:19:53.103 --> 00:19:54.664]  Do you understand that?
[00:19:54.664 --> 00:19:58.127]  We're taking their Hollywood system away from them right now.
[00:19:58.127 --> 00:19:59.307]  We are engaging them.
[00:19:59.307 --> 00:19:59.808]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:05.705]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:20:58.843 --> 00:21:02.907]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.907 --> 00:21:05.189]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:05.189 --> 00:21:08.512]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.512 --> 00:21:13.617]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.617 --> 00:21:17.801]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:18.101 --> 00:21:20.583]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.583 --> 00:21:23.344]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.344 --> 00:21:26.246]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.246 --> 00:21:33.871]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:34.201 --> 00:21:39.583]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.583 --> 00:21:41.904]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.904 --> 00:21:46.126]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:46.126 --> 00:21:47.046]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:47.046 --> 00:21:48.547]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:48.547 --> 00:21:50.047]  Invisible Empire.

[00:22:00.492 --> 00:22:01.513]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:01.513 --> 00:22:07.037]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:07.037 --> 00:22:07.577]  I get it.
[00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:17.225]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:17.225 --> 00:22:18.626]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:18.626 --> 00:22:27.112]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:30.355]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:34.736]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:34.736 --> 00:22:36.337]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:36.337 --> 00:22:40.298]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:40.298 --> 00:22:44.119]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:44.119 --> 00:22:45.020]  You should, too.
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.160]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.541]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:22:49.541 --> 00:22:49.641]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.641 --> 00:22:49.881]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.881 --> 00:22:50.061]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.102]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:23:03.102 --> 00:23:05.183]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:23:05.183 --> 00:23:07.925]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:23:07.925 --> 00:23:10.146]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:23:10.146 --> 00:23:11.567]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:23:11.567 --> 00:23:13.469]  But first, the facts.
[00:23:13.469 --> 00:23:15.390]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.371]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:23:17.371 --> 00:23:21.074]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:23:21.074 --> 00:23:28.818]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:23:28.818 --> 00:23:29.439]  Sinofresh.
[00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:32.761]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[00:23:47.889 --> 00:23:49.070]  Call right now for $2 off per bottle.
[00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.430]  Mention GCN.
[00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:50.370]  Buy Sinofresh.com.
[00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:50.650]  It works!
[00:24:04.286 --> 00:24:23.950]  Okay, coming up in the next segment, I'm going to really quantify how the system's trying to keep us in a controlled left-right paradigm, and how there's revolts happening within the Democrats, the Republicans, Hollywood, and the media, and how the system is really trying to co-opt all of those subgroups and keep them back on the reservation.
[00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:24.711]  That is coming up.
[00:24:24.711 --> 00:24:26.031]  It is so important.
[00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.753]  But I want to get into economic news right now.
[00:24:29.753 --> 00:24:32.757]  I talked about United States Joint Forces Command warns that huge U.S.
[00:24:32.757 --> 00:24:35.560]  debt might lead to military impotence, default and revolution.
[00:24:36.772 --> 00:24:39.855]  Gold surges to all-time high, $1,270.
[00:24:39.855 --> 00:24:42.818]  Silver exploding as we told you it would.
[00:24:42.818 --> 00:24:44.659]  We understand how this works.
[00:24:44.659 --> 00:24:49.344]  Curt Nemo has a key report up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:49.344 --> 00:24:53.928]  Gold and silver explode as banksters abandon market manipulation.
[00:24:53.928 --> 00:25:00.113]  And it gets into how they've decided, at least for during the fall, to stop manipulating it because they've been unsuccessful to hold it down.
[00:25:01.004 --> 00:25:02.904]  And of course the dollar is plunging.
[00:25:02.904 --> 00:25:16.068]  That's why they always try to keep gold and silver down before because it's a real commodity that competes with their fiat fraudster derivatives financial speculation system that they've unfairly used to consolidate global power.
[00:25:16.068 --> 00:25:18.988]  Now they want a carbon tax to fund their total takeover.
[00:25:18.988 --> 00:25:22.109]  That's in shambles crashing and burning as the fraud comes out.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.001]  It's not a foregone conclusion that we're going to go into tyranny.
[00:25:27.001 --> 00:25:30.943]  We can get a reprieve like Nineveh when Jonah went there, folks.
[00:25:30.943 --> 00:25:36.705]  You don't have to give in to evil.
[00:25:36.705 --> 00:25:38.526]  There is a tide in the affairs of men.
[00:25:38.526 --> 00:25:41.887]  When taken at the flood leads on to liberty.
[00:25:41.887 --> 00:25:47.130]  To slightly alter Julius Caesar's quote.
[00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.230]  So I've got all these reports.
[00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.950]  Here's Bloomberg.
[00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:49.971]  Gold reaches record.
[00:25:49.971 --> 00:25:52.112]  Stocks fall on economy concern.
[00:25:52.112 --> 00:25:52.672]  Yen gains.
[00:25:54.252 --> 00:25:58.615]  I briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because he is the owner of the Genesis Network.
[00:25:58.615 --> 00:25:59.916]  He is our biggest sponsor.
[00:25:59.916 --> 00:26:00.937]  Our biggest sponsor.
[00:26:00.937 --> 00:26:04.680]  And that's who I work with is who has the best deals.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:09.503]  And he bought a bunch of gold and silver three months ago when it was way down.
[00:26:09.503 --> 00:26:12.445]  Sold out of that at the lower price when it went up.
[00:26:12.445 --> 00:26:15.808]  He bought more in the last three weeks when it was a lot lower than it is now.
[00:26:15.808 --> 00:26:17.649]  That's about to run out.
[00:26:17.649 --> 00:26:20.111]  And this will run out again and it'll go up even more.
[00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:21.031]  All the evidence shows.
[00:26:21.031 --> 00:26:23.113]  And then we'll give you the next discount.
[00:26:23.633 --> 00:26:25.496]  You need to get on this train now.
[00:26:25.496 --> 00:26:28.880]  He's got silver at the best deal I've ever seen him offer.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:35.809]  He's got smoking deals on Sovereigns and Buffalos and Franks and go search these radio specials.
[00:26:35.809 --> 00:26:37.972]  You're not going to find anything near this anywhere.
[00:26:37.972 --> 00:26:38.653]  I challenge you.
[00:26:39.923 --> 00:26:44.966]  You've got a link to it in Curt Nemo's story about the bankers abandoning gold and silver manipulation for now.
[00:26:44.966 --> 00:26:47.888]  At the bottom, we've got a link to the radio special there online.
[00:26:47.888 --> 00:26:50.370]  People always requested, can't we have the same special online?
[00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:51.251]  Yes, it's there.
[00:26:51.251 --> 00:26:55.093]  But briefly, I wanted to bring Ted up before I get back into the news and more on the economy.
[00:26:55.093 --> 00:27:02.979]  Ted, again, Bob Chapman called it with precision two months ago, a month ago, two weeks ago.
[00:27:02.979 --> 00:27:06.261]  I mean, here we are, and the fall is just getting started, Ted.
[00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:08.102]  Yeah, you're right about that, Alex.
[00:27:08.102 --> 00:27:10.863]  Boy, the market is just hot as a pistol right now.
[00:27:10.863 --> 00:27:15.326]  What I'm doing now is, I mean, last time I offered the frank at $270.
[00:27:15.326 --> 00:27:19.908]  I have just a little tiny bit of inventory left, but it is going to be going up.
[00:27:19.908 --> 00:27:26.091]  That coin is going to be $280 here real shortly with the price increase on gold.
[00:27:26.091 --> 00:27:26.912]  I am going to hold it
[00:27:27.552 --> 00:27:31.374]  And I'll take the loss, because I just really want people to get involved.
[00:27:31.374 --> 00:27:39.358]  And at this time, that is just a smoking deal, especially considering the fact that you get that Forecaster subscription for an entire year with it.
[00:27:39.358 --> 00:27:40.898]  It's like buying gold at $555 an ounce.
[00:27:40.898 --> 00:27:43.760]  That coin, that Walking Liberty half at $9.75, I was searching eBay.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.820]  I couldn't find them.
[00:27:50.943 --> 00:27:54.986]  Rarely can you find them for $11 a piece, mostly in the $12.
[00:27:54.986 --> 00:27:59.828]  And I'm selling them right now at $909.75 a coin.
[00:27:59.828 --> 00:28:02.210]  I mean, that is just phenomenal.
[00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:04.891]  But the thing is, is that people really need to get moving now.
[00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:07.813]  I mean, Europe has fallen apart and all prices are rising.
[00:28:07.813 --> 00:28:10.775]  We're seeing that inflation coming that everybody's been talking about.
[00:28:10.775 --> 00:28:12.076]  But I mean, Ted, let me explain this.
[00:28:12.076 --> 00:28:16.758]  Silver is at $20.50 right now, according to Kitco.
[00:28:16.758 --> 00:28:18.960]  You're selling silver at below spot.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:26.283]  Well, that would be the Walking Liberty half, which is, you know, Walking Liberty halves are .72 per thousand.
[00:28:26.283 --> 00:28:29.445]  It's just probably just a little bit over, but it's not by much.
[00:28:29.445 --> 00:28:31.326]  It's just right there hanging in.
[00:28:31.326 --> 00:28:34.647]  The main thing is, Walking Liberty halves don't trade at this price.
[00:28:34.647 --> 00:28:37.309]  I mean, you can't buy walkers at this level.
[00:28:37.309 --> 00:28:39.810]  The point is, it's a half ounce coin.
[00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:44.494]  Yeah, well the silver coin is a half of the silver dollar size.
[00:28:44.494 --> 00:28:49.659]  It contains a little bit more than, it's almost a half of an ounce, it's like .36 something.
[00:28:49.659 --> 00:28:55.966]  The point is nobody's selling this stuff right at spot and you've got it there and that's gonna run out quickly too.
[00:28:56.386 --> 00:28:57.447]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:28:57.447 --> 00:28:58.748]  That's the whole point right now.
[00:28:58.748 --> 00:29:01.651]  I mean, it's a very finite supply.
[00:29:01.651 --> 00:29:05.374]  I don't have a whole lot of them there, and the price is rising.
[00:29:05.374 --> 00:29:12.960]  As a matter of fact, if you go to the internet right now, you're going to find the price has gone up over $11 on this coin, and I'm sitting here holding the coin down at $9.75.
[00:29:15.362 --> 00:29:16.884]  Yeah, this is a no-brainer, folks.
[00:29:16.884 --> 00:29:20.529]  I feel really good promoting this.
[00:29:20.529 --> 00:29:20.729]  800-686-2237.
[00:29:20.729 --> 00:29:20.950]  800-686-2237.
[00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:29.081]  Tell them it's the radio specials to get the price when all this was lower.
[00:29:29.081 --> 00:29:31.464]  Their regular offers are still competitive, but they're more.
[00:29:31.724 --> 00:29:36.306]  You only get this on the link at Infowars.com and Curt Nemo's story or by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:29:36.306 --> 00:29:36.646]  800-686-2237.
[00:29:36.646 --> 00:29:44.829]  Don't screw around with your destiny.
[00:29:44.829 --> 00:29:46.030]  Paper is death.
[00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:50.491]  Gold and silver, that's God's money, folks.
[00:29:50.491 --> 00:29:51.892]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.892 --> 00:29:54.413]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.413 --> 00:29:57.094]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.762 --> 00:30:16.228]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:30:16.228 --> 00:30:19.910]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:20.922 --> 00:30:33.694]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:30:33.694 --> 00:30:40.960]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:30:41.641 --> 00:30:52.005]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:30:52.005 --> 00:30:55.927]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:30:55.927 --> 00:30:59.048]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:30:59.628 --> 00:31:04.189]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.189 --> 00:31:05.109]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.109 --> 00:31:08.530]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:09.390]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:14.271]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.271 --> 00:31:15.011]  It's true.
[00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:19.892]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:19.892 --> 00:31:20.712]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:24.293]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.293 --> 00:31:27.994]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.214 --> 00:31:29.014]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.014 --> 00:31:31.755]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.755 --> 00:31:35.436]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.436 --> 00:31:36.237]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.237 --> 00:31:40.378]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.378 --> 00:31:45.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.601]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:59.386 --> 00:32:02.529]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:32:02.529 --> 00:32:06.312]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:32:06.312 --> 00:32:09.195]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:32:09.195 --> 00:32:14.120]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:23.944]  You have founded the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[00:33:23.944 --> 00:33:28.765]  The front lines in the fight to awaken humanity against the globalists.
[00:33:28.765 --> 00:33:37.847]  The criminal, eugenicist, ruling class that hates humanity and is here to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:33:37.847 --> 00:33:38.127]  Okay.
[00:33:39.281 --> 00:33:47.167]  Let me quantify what I was starting to get into earlier in the hour in the second segment.
[00:33:47.167 --> 00:33:51.370]  The system wants to keep people as mainline Republicans.
[00:33:51.370 --> 00:34:06.441]  And so, whenever the alternative media wakes up conservatives, libertarians, constitutionalists, people that I identify on the issues with a lot more than the Democrats, when those groups start to really wake up and the system can't keep them on the reservation,
[00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:13.193]  The establishment starts to take on our political and societal colorations.
[00:34:13.193 --> 00:34:16.494]  They camouflage themselves.
[00:34:16.494 --> 00:34:30.721]  And you've got the Democrats and Hollywood and the so-called liberal media that aren't liberal at all, if you look at the true historical measurement, posing as if they're anti-establishment when George W. Bush is in power.
[00:34:31.684 --> 00:34:35.567]  And they're against the wars, the secret arrest, the torture, the Patriot Act.
[00:34:35.567 --> 00:34:47.858]  As soon as Obama gets in, he breaks all his promises, accelerates all of those different tyrannical policies, and suddenly they're defending it and saying, well, Bush did it, it must be okay.
[00:34:47.858 --> 00:34:58.668]  And the same Wall Street interests, the big mega six banks that are waging war against your local banks, waging war against local farmers, always trying to vertically integrate and create consolidation.
[00:35:08.007 --> 00:35:12.451]  They are desperately trying to keep control of these different groups.
[00:35:12.451 --> 00:35:13.833]  And when I was talking about Hollywood...
[00:35:15.253 --> 00:35:21.154]  It's not just big Hollywood stars that I've talked to, or met with, or talked to over the phone.
[00:35:21.154 --> 00:35:42.198]  It's talking to them about all the other big stars that they're talking to that are awake, and then talking to other people in television, and in radio, at the highest levels, the highest levels of print media, you name it, that in Hollywood, there's a huge awakening going on for at least a decade, accelerating the last five or six years, where they understand
[00:35:42.438 --> 00:35:47.361]  That so-called liberalism is eugenics and globalism and anti-human.
[00:35:47.361 --> 00:35:49.682]  That they understand that there's a left-right paradigm.
[00:35:49.682 --> 00:35:55.365]  They understand that the same financial interests control both sides.
[00:35:55.365 --> 00:35:59.148]  They know that!
[00:35:59.148 --> 00:36:06.312]  And so, they're doing everything they can out of one side of their mouth to attack people that talk about world government.
[00:36:07.301 --> 00:36:15.845]  But at the same time, admit that world government's real, but basically spin it like it's not that bad, it's a solution to our problems.
[00:36:15.845 --> 00:36:18.326]  That's what the so-called liberals are doing.
[00:36:18.326 --> 00:36:22.208]  The mainline conservatives, the Sean Hannity's, the Glenn Beck's, the Rush Limbaugh's,
[00:36:23.354 --> 00:36:38.120]  They said for many years, in the case of Limbaugh, more than 20, that world government doesn't exist, the CFR didn't even exist, that there's no plan for central banks to take over the planet, that there's no carbon taxes, that none of that existed.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:52.346]  But as alternative media forced all of that out into the open, they then came out and started saying, okay, a little bit of this is true, but we're the gatekeepers and we're still going to demonize
[00:36:53.365 --> 00:37:00.034]  Ron Paul, Alex Jones, Chuck Baldwin, Oath Keepers, and many others.
[00:37:00.034 --> 00:37:05.202]  I mean, these guys on one show will say these groups are good, and on the next show say they're bad.
[00:37:05.202 --> 00:37:05.943]  And vice versa.
[00:37:08.086 --> 00:37:10.347]  And it's basically, here's the analogy.
[00:37:10.347 --> 00:37:24.436]  It's kinda like when you're fishing for perch or crappie, and you take the hook and you put a big fat worm on it, and you drop it down in the water, and the worm looks really good and tasty and delicious to the fish, but inside of it is a hook.
[00:37:24.436 --> 00:37:27.298]  Or you can use the analogy of rat poison.
[00:37:27.298 --> 00:37:32.521]  98% good food, 2% poison.
[00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:35.963]  So the rat eats it, tastes a little funny, and the rat dies two days later.
[00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:41.731]  And so that's the issue here.
[00:37:41.731 --> 00:37:48.775]  We know that the system understands that there's a total political realignment, the third Great Awakening in U.S.
[00:37:48.775 --> 00:37:50.196]  history.
[00:37:50.196 --> 00:37:52.777]  They understand that that's happening.
[00:37:52.777 --> 00:38:05.184]  They, in the Pentagon reports, in all their internal documentation, much of it public, they understand that there is a huge systemic awakening happening on every front and they're in trouble.
[00:38:06.803 --> 00:38:10.308]  They had the Democrats play the part of anti-establishment when Bush is in.
[00:38:10.308 --> 00:38:12.932]  They get in power, they play the part of establishment.
[00:38:12.932 --> 00:38:18.299]  They declared two years ago that the Tea Parties are a right-wing Republican creation, which they weren't.
[00:38:18.299 --> 00:38:22.525]  They were an organic movement created by 9-11 Truth, on record.
[00:38:23.266 --> 00:38:27.608]  Picked up then by the Ron Paul revolution, 2007-2008.
[00:38:27.608 --> 00:38:32.150]  Republicans were being booed off the stage everywhere at town halls a year and a half ago.
[00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:38.132]  And in came Dick Armey, in came Newt Gingrich, in came FreedomWorks, in came Glenn Beck.
[00:38:38.132 --> 00:38:39.593]  And they had to change their rhetoric.
[00:38:39.593 --> 00:38:42.694]  Instead of saying militias are dangerous, arrest them.
[00:38:42.694 --> 00:38:45.175]  They want to blow up Oklahoma City again.
[00:38:45.175 --> 00:38:46.996]  Ron Paul may be dangerous.
[00:38:46.996 --> 00:38:49.077]  We need to use the army against his supporters.
[00:38:49.077 --> 00:38:49.717]  These are quotes.
[00:38:51.445 --> 00:38:54.526]  They then shifted, oh no, these people are good!
[00:38:54.526 --> 00:39:00.669]  So that they can lead and control the movement.
[00:39:00.669 --> 00:39:02.369]  Glenn Beck still supports wars.
[00:39:02.369 --> 00:39:03.730]  He still supports the Patriot Act.
[00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:08.992]  He says torture is a great thing, and that Jack Bauer is a hero, and that we need more of this.
[00:39:12.668 --> 00:39:19.993]  If you accept torture, then you accept the Nazis' torturing, or the Soviets' torturing, or the Maoists' torturing, or the North Vietnamese' torturing.
[00:39:19.993 --> 00:39:21.574]  You can't do that.
[00:39:21.574 --> 00:39:22.715]  And they sell it.
[00:39:22.715 --> 00:39:24.536]  Oh, we just waterboarded a few people.
[00:39:24.536 --> 00:39:27.578]  No, they didn't.
[00:39:27.578 --> 00:39:33.482]  They tortured tens of thousands in the camps in Iraq alone, including raping their children in front of them.
[00:39:33.482 --> 00:39:34.763]  That's the Army's own report.
[00:39:36.877 --> 00:39:39.718]  In fact, guys, search the term for people watching on presentplanet.tv.
[00:39:39.718 --> 00:39:42.379]  Radio listeners can search this themselves and pull it up.
[00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:44.659]  It'll be Newsweek, AP, Reuters.
[00:39:44.659 --> 00:39:52.221]  Army report details torture of children.
[00:39:52.221 --> 00:40:00.444]  Well, when the CIA thought they had you and thought you were buying into this in 2002, they were in the Washington Post saying, yes, we torture people's children in front of them.
[00:40:00.444 --> 00:40:05.085]  That's in my film, Road to Tyranny, the screenshot of the Washington Post newspaper, where they promoted it.
[00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:11.594]  And Beck always tries to re-invoke that.
[00:40:11.594 --> 00:40:13.675]  Remember how scared you were after 9-11?
[00:40:13.675 --> 00:40:15.396]  And you said do whatever you have to?
[00:40:15.396 --> 00:40:26.902]  But what he doesn't tell you is that we got MYAC-type reports from Texas and from the federal government, from our sources, and published them in 2001, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[00:40:32.973 --> 00:40:41.100]  Only when we got a new document that had been issued under Obama did Fox News and Glenn Beck pick it up going, they want to go after veterans.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.802]  They want to go after Ron Paul.
[00:40:42.802 --> 00:40:44.383]  They want to go after gun owners.
[00:40:44.383 --> 00:40:46.165]  They want to go after returning veterans.
[00:40:46.165 --> 00:40:50.048]  They don't want you having a Libertarian bumper sticker or get us out of the UN sticker.
[00:40:50.048 --> 00:40:51.990]  This is outrageous.
[00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:59.156]  But just a year before that, and I have the videos, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity,
[00:41:01.869 --> 00:41:09.031]  Bill O'Reilly and the MSNBC host, all of them, we have clips of all of this.
[00:41:09.031 --> 00:41:11.472]  We're doing deep research.
[00:41:11.472 --> 00:41:18.434]  We've seen these overall week after week over the last three years, but now we've been compiling it.
[00:41:18.434 --> 00:41:25.717]  Every night I'm up here late watching this stuff and getting sicker and sicker and sicker.
[00:41:25.717 --> 00:41:29.358]  And this is the key, what you're about to get.
[00:41:29.358 --> 00:41:30.178]  Listen to me carefully.
[00:41:31.872 --> 00:41:43.295]  Why was I so horrified by Hannity and Beck and O'Reilly three years ago and Joe Scarborough?
[00:41:43.295 --> 00:41:44.215]  All of them.
[00:41:44.215 --> 00:41:58.138]  Because they were word-for-word reading internal, secret, MIAC-type demonization reports of good Americans, bedrock Americans, the heart of this country.
[00:41:58.138 --> 00:42:00.099]  I had all those documents and had published them.
[00:42:01.161 --> 00:42:04.404]  And many others have gotten similar documents and published them.
[00:42:04.404 --> 00:42:06.066]  And I knew the script.
[00:42:06.066 --> 00:42:09.870]  And I knew it was ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, via the feds.
[00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:21.082]  And I knew that they were reading and whoever was loading their teleprompters was putting high-level government secret demonization information into the public through these mouthpieces.
[00:42:25.188 --> 00:42:29.851]  Not only did those neocons all go to the White House and admit they got marching orders, there they were.
[00:42:29.851 --> 00:42:50.686]  Do you understand, this is the key, that under Bush, they accelerated the Clinton-era demonization of patriots, of land rights activists, of anti-carbon tax activists, of anti-man-made global warming activists, of libertarians, of gun owners.
[00:42:51.738 --> 00:42:58.762]  They weren't spending any of their time, except for a few staged arrest of nutcases, with Muslims.
[00:42:58.762 --> 00:43:01.484]  They weren't spending their time on that.
[00:43:01.484 --> 00:43:09.649]  90 plus percent in all these reports was pointed at basically people that got portraits of John Wayne hanging in their living room.
[00:43:09.649 --> 00:43:12.851]  By the way, I got a lot of family actually has John Wayne hanging up in their living rooms.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:19.402]  I go to my family in East Texas, almost every house has got pictures of John Wayne hanging up, and they're all former military veterans.
[00:43:19.402 --> 00:43:21.502]  That's the type of people I come from, okay?
[00:43:21.502 --> 00:43:23.983]  Well, you need to understand something, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:23.983 --> 00:43:29.165]  That's who the system doesn't like, because you're not going to go along with banking takeovers.
[00:43:29.165 --> 00:43:31.786]  You're not going to go along with face scanning to buy and sell.
[00:43:31.786 --> 00:43:34.907]  You're not going to go along with gun registration and confiscation.
[00:43:34.907 --> 00:43:40.729]  You're not going to go along with UN takeovers and NLE drills with foreign troops in America.
[00:43:40.729 --> 00:43:41.469]  This is all admitted.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:50.083]  And so, of course I've had bad feelings about these neocons who went along with the banker bailouts.
[00:43:50.083 --> 00:43:53.424]  I've got them all on video promoting the banker bailouts two years ago.
[00:43:53.424 --> 00:43:56.185]  Now saying they were against it.
[00:43:56.185 --> 00:43:59.106]  So, Glenn Beck does incredibly good things every day.
[00:43:59.106 --> 00:44:00.747]  He's the best of any of those guys.
[00:44:02.403 --> 00:44:05.505]  He talks about the socialists, the communitarians.
[00:44:05.505 --> 00:44:07.386]  He talks about Agenda 21.
[00:44:07.386 --> 00:44:09.367]  He talks about world government.
[00:44:09.367 --> 00:44:13.230]  He's getting better and better because you're forcing him.
[00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:18.353]  And this radio show is forcing him to go all the way.
[00:44:18.353 --> 00:44:20.194]  But he still stops short.
[00:44:20.194 --> 00:44:24.817]  He'll do shows about the communist groups and the
[00:44:28.496 --> 00:44:30.536]  People that are doing neighborhood organizing.
[00:44:30.536 --> 00:44:32.077]  And he'll tell you they're communist.
[00:44:32.077 --> 00:44:38.158]  But he doesn't tell you that the Carnegie and Ford and Rockefeller foundations fund it.
[00:44:38.158 --> 00:44:40.799]  He'll tell you about Mao and forced sterilization.
[00:44:40.799 --> 00:44:44.139]  He doesn't tell you public treaties with the U.S.
[00:44:44.139 --> 00:44:48.400]  under State Department Memorandum 200 to carry it out.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.521]  And last night I was watching him, taking notes, and
[00:44:53.393 --> 00:44:56.315]  Just watching him... I have an admission to make.
[00:44:56.315 --> 00:45:03.781]  I see the clips online, and I see things, and I get angry, I get upset, but I've always had a rule to not talk about other talk show hosts, unless it's in a positive light.
[00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:05.362]  I'm not here to fight with people.
[00:45:05.362 --> 00:45:07.064]  I'm here to wake up listeners.
[00:45:07.064 --> 00:45:19.854]  But when people are put there as leaders to control our movement, and when I know they speak out of both sides of their mouth, and I know their teleprompters are loaded with government scripts, because I've got the scripts from our sources,
[00:45:22.961 --> 00:45:31.843]  I know that they are putting a worm on the line to drop it down in front of you, so it looks tasty, it looks good, and I actually feel dirty and bad.
[00:45:33.652 --> 00:45:47.759]  Because I haven't spent the time really researching these guys like I should, and all of my research only confirms in triplicate spades everything I'd already seen and heard and witnessed.
[00:45:47.759 --> 00:45:51.220]  And not just the look in these people's eyes or their mannerisms.
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:58.044]  I mean, just at a base level, I'm danger, Will Robinson, danger!
[00:45:58.044 --> 00:45:58.644]  It makes my
[00:46:00.046 --> 00:46:00.626]  I think?
[00:46:14.977 --> 00:46:39.870]  To the end, and they show the timeline of all the famous things in history that have happened, all the critical junctures, and I'm sittin' there eatin' tacos with Rob at about 6.30 last night, because he taped it, we were watchin' the tape of it, the DVR of it, and we're takin' notes, and I said, Rob, he's gonna invoke Moses, the idea is he's Moses, now we found they're sayin' that on all the shows, and at the end, he's gonna write on the chalkboard,
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:47.922]  That his 8-18 is as important as Moses.
[00:46:47.922 --> 00:46:53.024]  And that he is now basically Alex Jones, Oprah Winfrey, and cult leader rolled into one.
[00:46:53.024 --> 00:46:55.425]  That's what he's doing.
[00:46:55.425 --> 00:47:00.947]  And Rob's mouth just dropped when he said he's 8-18 and it's as big as Moses at the end.
[00:47:00.947 --> 00:47:02.888]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:12.675]  Because he's saying all the right things and doing all this, but literally taking over the True Liberty Movement that knows the answers, that understands the enemy.
[00:47:12.675 --> 00:47:16.657]  This is a guy who reads off teleprompters from government scripts.
[00:47:16.657 --> 00:47:19.038]  We've confirmed it.
[00:47:19.038 --> 00:47:21.980]  And now we've basically overthrown their paradigm.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.322]  We've got people admitting world government's real.
[00:47:24.322 --> 00:47:25.702]  They can't deny it anymore.
[00:47:25.702 --> 00:47:29.825]  So they're coming in, playing the part of anti-establishment ahead of all of this.
[00:47:31.983 --> 00:47:35.466]  So that when they get back into power, they can control the situation.
[00:47:35.466 --> 00:47:40.069]  He isn't saying repeal the Patriot Act, targeting conservatives, libertarians, gun owners, returning veterans.
[00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:41.570]  It's all for you.
[00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:43.511]  He isn't saying stop these wars.
[00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:45.433]  He's saying torture's good.
[00:47:45.433 --> 00:47:51.137]  It's all this truly evil, immoral stuff rolled into everything we're doing.
[00:47:51.137 --> 00:48:00.724]  And I kept noticing all these big publications, Mother Jones, Media Matters, Newsweek, Time, New York Times, saying Glenn Beck was ripping me off.
[00:48:02.452 --> 00:48:04.333]  Texas Monthly.
[00:48:04.333 --> 00:48:06.455]  Anybody, I guess they were watching him, they knew.
[00:48:06.455 --> 00:48:10.137]  I'm gonna admit, I wasn't watching the maybe 1-100th.
[00:48:10.137 --> 00:48:11.018]  I'm busy.
[00:48:11.018 --> 00:48:12.139]  I'm reading government documents.
[00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:13.220]  I'm researching eugenics.
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.961]  I'm researching what's in the vaccines.
[00:48:14.961 --> 00:48:16.682]  I'm researching where gold's gonna go.
[00:48:16.682 --> 00:48:17.783]  I'm looking at the economy.
[00:48:20.086 --> 00:48:23.109]  I'm trying to help my wife homeschool the children in the mornings.
[00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:32.256]  I'm busy, and it's so physically evil, and my spirit cries out that Danger Will Robinson, when I watch these people, it's painful that I haven't been watching it.
[00:48:32.256 --> 00:48:41.023]  Well, the last month or so, we've been really deep into this, because I'm making a film about it, and it's worse than I could have even said, and more sophisticated.
[00:48:41.023 --> 00:48:45.287]  Now, I started researching Beck's websites just in the last three days.
[00:48:45.287 --> 00:48:48.790]  I started researching Dick Armey and FreedomWorks, and you know what I found?
[00:48:50.199 --> 00:48:55.061]  Glenn Beck wears a Gadsden flag shirt a lot of times on radio and TV under a sports jacket.
[00:48:55.061 --> 00:48:56.581]  Who started doing that three years ago?
[00:48:56.581 --> 00:48:57.742]  Me.
[00:48:57.742 --> 00:48:59.742]  Glenn Beck does all my mannerisms.
[00:48:59.742 --> 00:49:02.323]  He's an actor, he's an actor.
[00:49:02.323 --> 00:49:05.064]  He does that almost every episode.
[00:49:05.064 --> 00:49:07.405]  That's something I, everything.
[00:49:07.405 --> 00:49:11.386]  We put this on the map in the last 15 years, promoting it and selling it.
[00:49:11.386 --> 00:49:13.627]  The last five, we put one free in every order.
[00:49:13.627 --> 00:49:18.989]  Citizen rule book about jury nullification, about the new world order, about the left-right paradigm.
[00:49:21.745 --> 00:49:29.594]  Dick Armey, now on all of Beck's sites and his, put it up on screen in a screenshot, has put out a rule book!
[00:49:29.594 --> 00:49:37.902]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I'd say 40% of what Glenn Beck does, I've really been analyzing him, is Alex Jones.
[00:49:37.902 --> 00:49:40.305]  Do you know how dirty I feel?
[00:49:40.305 --> 00:49:42.808]  I've been having nightmares about Glenn Beck, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:45.572 --> 00:49:51.381]  You know how dirty I feel knowing my essence and my reality and the truth I'm putting out?
[00:49:51.381 --> 00:49:54.646]  That I'm bonafide and real?
[00:49:54.646 --> 00:49:57.109]  And reaching tens of millions of people?
[00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:58.672]  Exploding?
[00:49:58.672 --> 00:50:00.995]  That they've created this twisted clone?
[00:50:03.404 --> 00:50:12.349]  Who's an actor and reads off a teleprompter, and I had two high-level Fox News people who are patriot on the inside told me, yeah, Beck doesn't want people on your show.
[00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:13.289]  He threatens them.
[00:50:13.289 --> 00:50:15.490]  He won't have them on if they go on yours.
[00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:19.733]  And he tries to work through networks to make sure stations don't pick you up.
[00:50:19.733 --> 00:50:23.235]  And he's got a team of at least five people.
[00:50:23.235 --> 00:50:25.116]  They are listening right now.
[00:50:26.396 --> 00:50:28.117]  And I want people to imitate.
[00:50:28.117 --> 00:50:29.938]  That's the most sincere form of flattery.
[00:50:29.938 --> 00:50:32.120]  I want people to use the information I'm putting out.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:41.785]  But I don't want them taking it and making it a pro-torture, pro-war, pro-tyranny, pro-Patriot Act, when that's all aimed at Americans.
[00:50:41.785 --> 00:50:45.647]  They sell you saying it's for foreigners.
[00:50:45.647 --> 00:50:51.090]  I have a responsibility to stand up and say, look, you are the devil's counterfeit.
[00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:52.031]  And I'm going to tell you right now,
[00:50:53.095 --> 00:51:00.817]  Anybody that wears a skull and bones, you know, belt like Schwarzenegger and Beck, I'm telling you, he's a devil.
[00:51:00.817 --> 00:51:03.818]  Off-the-grid remedies can still be grown in your own backyard.

[00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:06.091]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:06.091 --> 00:52:09.854]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:09.854 --> 00:52:12.256]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.256 --> 00:52:18.122]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:52:18.122 --> 00:52:24.368]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:24.788 --> 00:52:30.772]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:30.772 --> 00:52:34.935]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.

[00:52:48.745 --> 00:52:50.706]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:50.706 --> 00:52:51.167]  It's here.

[00:54:04.181 --> 00:54:11.163]  Folks, this issue is so important, I suspended my Master Eugenics film that I've been making for two years.
[00:54:11.163 --> 00:54:16.444]  The ultimate film, with all the latest, it's incredible.
[00:54:16.444 --> 00:54:25.707]  I suspended that until next year, and I'm even having nightmares now to see my evil doppelganger.
[00:54:25.707 --> 00:54:27.588]  But again, it's not just Alex Jones.
[00:54:27.588 --> 00:54:31.729]  He's using Oprah Winfrey NLP, brainwashing,
[00:54:32.679 --> 00:54:38.323]  He's mixing Christianoid stuff into it, and it's counterfeiting everything.
[00:54:38.323 --> 00:54:39.244]  I haven't been watching.
[00:54:39.244 --> 00:54:40.745]  I was watching last night.
[00:54:40.745 --> 00:54:53.833]  It was two of my sponsors, people we went out and found four and five years ago, our actual sponsors on his show.
[00:54:53.833 --> 00:54:55.114]  I mean, it's our sponsors.
[00:54:55.114 --> 00:54:59.457]  It's everything we talk about, but twisted.
[00:54:59.457 --> 00:55:00.198]  It's incredible.
[00:55:01.952 --> 00:55:15.763]  And then they're promoting a citizen rule book that says it teaches them the tactics of the left, of Saul Alinsky, how to use deception and manipulation, like the communists do, but to save America?
[00:55:15.763 --> 00:55:17.945]  You don't beat evil with evil.
[00:55:17.945 --> 00:55:19.966]  In fact, put that back up.
[00:55:19.966 --> 00:55:21.808]  I mean, it's just everywhere, everything.
[00:55:21.808 --> 00:55:25.811]  I mean, do you know what it feels like?
[00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:31.514]  To want to be legitimate and real and to try to never compromise?
[00:55:31.514 --> 00:55:32.755]  I mean, none of us are perfect.
[00:55:32.755 --> 00:55:35.017]  I look back on things I'm ashamed of all the time.
[00:55:35.017 --> 00:55:36.999]  I'm not up here on some high horse.
[00:55:36.999 --> 00:55:44.126]  And then just everything we do, a sickening counterfeit of it.
[00:55:44.126 --> 00:55:48.810]  But the good news is, you have forced him to come a long way.
[00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:50.272]  I'm just saying, I don't trust him.
[00:55:52.116 --> 00:55:54.237]  I don't trust any of these people.
[00:55:54.237 --> 00:55:57.938]  Remember, they were telling you none of this existed just a few years ago.
[00:55:57.938 --> 00:56:05.140]  And it's a big victory that we forced them to admit it all exists, because they know America's awake.
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:11.022]  And now he's talking about eugenics, but he isn't telling you that the big banks run it, and who finances it.
[00:56:11.022 --> 00:56:13.403]  They don't go all the way.
[00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:16.844]  And it's going all the way that is the key to all of this.
[00:56:18.424 --> 00:56:25.145]  If you want to get the real Citizens Rule book, we sell them at cost at InfoWars.com and all video and book orders, we add one to it.
[00:56:25.145 --> 00:56:29.506]  And it is, we don't have $50 million contracts like these people do.
[00:56:29.506 --> 00:56:39.848]  We're a small operation that reaches, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com reaches more than all of Glenn Beck's sites combined, with Rush Limbaugh's sites added to it.
[00:56:39.848 --> 00:56:42.649]  So now they're launching more websites that look just like our websites.
[00:56:43.905 --> 00:56:45.246]  I mean, it's frightening.
[00:56:45.246 --> 00:56:46.187]  And I'll give Beck this.
[00:56:46.187 --> 00:56:49.249]  Yesterday, he ran with the headline, Bill Gates wants to kill you.
[00:56:49.249 --> 00:56:52.452]  Bill Gates wants to, you know, kill granny for teachers.
[00:56:52.452 --> 00:56:57.136]  And they went on to say they're playing the teachers off against the old people.
[00:56:57.136 --> 00:56:57.936]  Divide and conquer.
[00:56:57.936 --> 00:57:00.959]  So, praise God!
[00:57:00.959 --> 00:57:09.606]  My only issue is that in my gut, and in everything I see, and in Beck behind the scenes trying to block me,
[00:57:14.261 --> 00:57:16.583]  Glenn Beck threatening people not to come on my show?
[00:57:16.583 --> 00:57:21.747]  I mean, he's up there trying to stop this radio show.
[00:57:21.747 --> 00:57:22.868]  Do you understand that?
[00:57:22.868 --> 00:57:25.550]  I'm not attacking Glenn Beck.
[00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:41.542]  But he's being set up as a messianic leader to the point I can sit there eating a taco in the coffee room last night, two minutes before, and I looked to Rob and I said, you watch, he's gonna write at the end of that big display he has his 818 event.
[00:57:44.881 --> 00:57:47.884]  Implying he is the ultimate in history.
[00:57:47.884 --> 00:57:51.607]  And then he went on and said exactly that.
[00:57:51.607 --> 00:57:54.469]  And the issue is, those people at 818 were great folks.
[00:57:54.469 --> 00:57:56.091]  Those are good people.
[00:57:56.091 --> 00:57:59.253]  I could see it in their faces, their eyes.
[00:57:59.253 --> 00:58:03.797]  And the false left is attacking Beck, so that gives him credibility.
[00:58:03.797 --> 00:58:09.102]  But you have to understand, they're teamed up doing this to control the field.
[00:58:09.102 --> 00:58:10.263]  To control the spectrum.
[00:58:12.091 --> 00:58:33.343]  And we've got to become sophisticated enough to realize this, and some of you won't believe me now, but three years from now, when you've got a Republican president, when you've got a Republican House and Senate, when they stage big terror attacks, and when they come after the American people, I want you to remember that I told you what happened if we're unable to defeat this.
[00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:36.565]  But we may be able to avert it, because we've got the answers.
[00:58:36.565 --> 00:58:37.785]  We've got the truth.
[00:58:37.785 --> 00:58:38.346]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:42.025 --> 00:58:43.826]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:27.982]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:59:27.982 --> 00:59:29.203]  Others don't.
[00:59:29.203 --> 00:59:31.344]  We turn jeans inside out.

[00:59:47.714 --> 00:59:48.595]  Others don't.
[00:59:53.194 --> 00:59:55.595]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.595 --> 01:00:05.160]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.480]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.241]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:10.002]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.002 --> 01:00:11.583]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.583 --> 01:00:13.144]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.144 --> 01:00:17.326]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.326 --> 01:00:21.388]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.072 --> 01:00:50.825]  To have my statements, my research, my work, taken by a group of people and twisted to serve their evil aims, and then to have them behind the scenes trying to sabotage and block what we're doing, it's outrageous.
[01:00:50.825 --> 01:00:55.248]  And I have a responsibility to stand up against it,
[01:00:56.405 --> 01:00:59.847]  And to resist it.
[01:00:59.847 --> 01:01:02.649]  And, you know, in my flesh, I'm like, look, I want to be successful.
[01:01:02.649 --> 01:01:03.410]  I could compromise.
[01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.510]  I could reach more people.
[01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:06.052]  I could go along with this.
[01:01:06.052 --> 01:01:08.193]  I could join these people.
[01:01:08.193 --> 01:01:12.556]  I've been offered, you know, to join the system many times and try to work through the system.
[01:01:12.556 --> 01:01:14.817]  No.
[01:01:14.817 --> 01:01:17.939]  We're gaining more stations and affiliates without selling out.
[01:01:17.939 --> 01:01:21.622]  And I'm glad I never have because the truth is what matters.
[01:01:21.622 --> 01:01:24.424]  No, it's not good overall to sit there and go after these people.
[01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:31.293]  But back when the Democrats were opposing Bush, I said, you watch, when they get in power, they're going to be even worse.
[01:01:31.293 --> 01:01:33.074]  They're going to accelerate these programs.
[01:01:33.074 --> 01:01:36.736]  I told you a year and a half ago in the Obama deception, everything Obama would do.
[01:01:36.736 --> 01:01:38.537]  I told you his approval rating would go way down.
[01:01:38.537 --> 01:01:40.458]  I told you he'd be a one-term president.
[01:01:40.458 --> 01:01:41.699]  Unless they stage terror attacks.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.660]  And now what's happened?
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:49.921]  And all these Democrats that hated me and got mad, they're finally waking up and going, you were right.
[01:01:49.921 --> 01:02:05.184]  And so what matters is that I put the facts on the line now, so some of you can disagree with me now, but later, I want you to remember what I told you.
[01:02:05.184 --> 01:02:08.104]  I want you to be warned.
[01:02:08.104 --> 01:02:11.545]  I want you to understand, because News Corp is evil.
[01:02:12.406 --> 01:02:17.652]  News Corp and their TV shows and movies promotes global government, carbon taxes, and they admit they do.
[01:02:17.652 --> 01:02:19.634]  They promote the anti-gun agenda.
[01:02:19.634 --> 01:02:20.855]  They promote the Patriot Act.
[01:02:20.855 --> 01:02:24.319]  They promote it all, and it's designed for the American people.
[01:02:24.319 --> 01:02:25.260]  It's a bait-and-switch.
[01:02:28.317 --> 01:02:38.221]  And anything they are producing or putting out is done to just color themselves enough as patriots to sell you on going along with them.
[01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:41.802]  Same thing with Barack Obama, how he pitches towards the left.
[01:02:41.802 --> 01:02:43.983]  But there is nothing to deal with the left or the right.
[01:02:43.983 --> 01:02:49.725]  He's a global corporate puppet reading off a teleprompter.
[01:02:49.725 --> 01:02:51.305]  It's the science of betrayal.
[01:02:51.305 --> 01:02:53.286]  It's the science of getting your confidence.
[01:02:54.502 --> 01:02:56.443]  And it's so insincere when you watch these people.
[01:02:56.443 --> 01:03:01.524]  If you have any spiritual or psychological discernment, you could see right through it.
[01:03:01.524 --> 01:03:08.286]  Oberman, Beck, all of these people, they're playing a game.
[01:03:08.286 --> 01:03:11.507]  The only real hatred there is that they're competing with each other.
[01:03:11.507 --> 01:03:13.168]  And I have always taken the high road.
[01:03:13.168 --> 01:03:15.268]  I'm not in competition with these people.
[01:03:15.268 --> 01:03:17.169]  I'm in competition with corruption and evil.
[01:03:17.169 --> 01:03:19.229]  That's what I'm waging war against.
[01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:21.310]  But the system is positioning itself
[01:03:22.605 --> 01:03:24.526]  To control the left, control the right.
[01:03:24.526 --> 01:03:28.669]  There is a rebellion in Hollywood and in television.
[01:03:28.669 --> 01:03:31.191]  The majority of people have broken the paradigm.
[01:03:31.191 --> 01:03:32.451]  They love liberty.
[01:03:32.451 --> 01:03:34.453]  They're pro-gun, anti-vaccine.
[01:03:34.453 --> 01:03:35.894]  They know about eugenics.
[01:03:35.894 --> 01:03:43.599]  And there's a war in Hollywood to try to suppress a huge revolt at that level.
[01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:46.340]  So it's going on in the controlled left, the controlled right.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.601]  It's going on in the media.
[01:03:47.601 --> 01:03:48.762]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:03:51.189 --> 01:04:02.302]  We're going to have to have courage, all of us individually, to stand up and to tell the truth and do the research it takes to understand how these sophisticated propaganda modes operate.
[01:04:02.302 --> 01:04:04.966]  Now we've got Dick Gregory, civil rights icon, joining us.
[01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:06.988]  He's gone public for 9-11 Truth.
[01:04:06.988 --> 01:04:08.029]  Amazing information.
[01:04:09.295 --> 01:04:13.297]  And after he leaves us, remember Bloomberg a month ago?
[01:04:13.297 --> 01:04:21.520]  How every major insurance company's been caught basically stealing the insurance policies of dead veterans or disabled veterans from their families?
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:33.425]  And it turns out the Veterans Affairs quote made a secret deal with the major insurance companies to tell the troops to sign up with these agreements and to trick them into steal their money.
[01:04:33.425 --> 01:04:35.606]  Veteran agency made secret deal over benefits.
[01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:38.587]  That'll give you an idea who runs this.
[01:04:38.587 --> 01:04:41.268]  They tell you COREXIT isn't bad for you in the Gulf.
[01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:43.369]  They tell you the dust on 9-11 isn't bad for you.
[01:04:43.369 --> 01:04:46.530]  They tell the troops DU isn't bad for them now.
[01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:47.711]  There's been a real shift.
[01:04:47.711 --> 01:04:54.674]  We've always had a corrupt government, but now it practices evil like a doctor practices medicine.
[01:04:54.674 --> 01:04:57.555]  And now Bill Gates admits the death panels are real and they're good.
[01:05:00.339 --> 01:05:04.424]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:52.425]  Thank you!
[01:06:59.346 --> 01:07:03.889]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:03.889 --> 01:07:04.810]  Number 1.
[01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:08.233]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:09.093]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.093 --> 01:07:13.997]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:13.997 --> 01:07:14.737]  It's true.
[01:07:14.737 --> 01:07:19.601]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:20.442]  Number 3.
[01:07:20.442 --> 01:07:24.024]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.024 --> 01:07:27.727]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:27.907 --> 01:07:28.707]  Number 4.
[01:07:28.707 --> 01:07:31.468]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.468 --> 01:07:35.149]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.149 --> 01:07:35.949]  Number 5.
[01:07:35.949 --> 01:07:40.090]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:45.132]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:07:58.336 --> 01:08:11.722]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.722 --> 01:08:17.024]  The ruling class, the social engineers, are here to divide and conquer us.
[01:08:17.024 --> 01:08:22.627]  They stage economic, military, and terror events like the Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:29.383]  And there's no doubt that if you study the 9-11 event, you know it's an inside job.
[01:08:29.383 --> 01:08:38.609]  I remember the Rand Corporation, PNAC with Dick Cheney, and countless others saying in 2000, 2001, that we need giant Pearl Harbor events.
[01:08:38.609 --> 01:08:40.770]  Zbigniew Brzezinski said the same thing.
[01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:47.795]  We need giant terror attacks to sell a domestic police state and a global empire for the corporations that own America.
[01:08:47.795 --> 01:08:49.296]  America was conquered a long time ago.
[01:08:51.369 --> 01:08:54.032]  And if we're not honest about this, we're not going to be able to fix it.
[01:08:54.032 --> 01:09:13.390]  And the Democratic Party's run by these banks, the Republican Party's run by these banks, but somebody who I've always seen who has incredible courage, who I've admired, frontline civil rights activist, beaten, arrested, you know, with Martin Luther King, Dick Gregory.
[01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:14.351]  And I remember in the 80s,
[01:09:15.754 --> 01:09:19.296]  And the 90s, he led the charge exposing CIA crack cocaine.
[01:09:19.296 --> 01:09:25.080]  Later got declassified, admitted in the 1996 CIA Inspector General hearings in Congress.
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.060]  I watched them on C-SPAN.
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.181]  I was on air by then.
[01:09:27.181 --> 01:09:30.263]  I covered it on the radio and TV.
[01:09:30.263 --> 01:09:32.984]  But they still come out in the media and say it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:09:32.984 --> 01:09:39.528]  Now on Fox News, this is coming up later in the next hour, they come on and say, yeah, we're growing the opium, what's the big deal?
[01:09:39.528 --> 01:09:41.049]  So they hide all this in plain view.
[01:09:41.049 --> 01:09:42.010]  They think you're stupid.
[01:09:44.289 --> 01:09:57.999]  And Dick Gregory has now put his Major Gravitas out there on the line again, and is on a hunger strike for a real investigation of the controlled demolition of Tower 1, 2, and 7.
[01:09:57.999 --> 01:10:10.168]  And we don't just have the former German Defense Minister, the number three guy in the Japanese government going public, or thousands and thousands of engineers and physicists and scientists, or the police on video on CNN saying, get back, they're going to blow up Building 7.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.521]  I mean, it's hidden in plain view.
[01:10:13.521 --> 01:10:18.042]  They count on you not having the courage to be able to admit this.
[01:10:18.042 --> 01:10:25.445]  And if they can get away with that, they'll get away with telling you, Koregs, it's not bad for you, the EPA and Obama and the Gulf, as people drop dead and get sick.
[01:10:25.445 --> 01:10:28.666]  Like they told you the dust wasn't bad for you on Ground Zero.
[01:10:28.666 --> 01:10:31.527]  It's not just they don't care about you, they like hurting you.
[01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:32.667]  And then denying you medical care.
[01:10:34.718 --> 01:10:37.320]  It's the same thing with the depleted uranium, as I said before the break.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:42.585]  You've got to really get it how predatory and wicked these people are.
[01:10:42.585 --> 01:10:46.328]  And that our children and our society has no future if we don't say no.
[01:10:46.328 --> 01:10:48.670]  So Dick Gregory joins us for the rest of the hour.
[01:10:48.670 --> 01:10:52.754]  We're very, very honored to have a civil rights icon on with us today.
[01:10:52.754 --> 01:10:57.138]  And he says he's got some breaking news before we get into why he's going public for 9-11 Truth.
[01:10:57.138 --> 01:10:58.940]  Mr. Gregory, we salute your courage.
[01:10:59.485 --> 01:11:00.265]  Thank you, my brother.
[01:11:00.265 --> 01:11:01.406]  Peace and love to you.
[01:11:01.406 --> 01:11:10.590]  And just let me say that there's a whole lot of us out here that get trashed by the New York Times and the Washington Post.
[01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:21.756]  But as long as there's a brother and a human being like you that lifts us up, we say, well, I can't say what you really want to say, but the New York Times can do.
[01:11:21.756 --> 01:11:26.438]  But I've always said, if I could be born over again and name myself, you know what I'd name myself?
[01:11:27.645 --> 01:11:31.588]  Conspiracy Theory, Gregory!
[01:11:31.588 --> 01:11:37.492]  Because I've always felt that my truth don't have to be validated by somebody else's ignorance.
[01:11:37.492 --> 01:11:42.455]  That's right, and when they use the term conspiracy theory, it's a label meaning don't listen to that guy.
[01:11:42.455 --> 01:11:53.823]  Yes, well the greatest conspiracy theory, a lot of people think conspiracy theory just started, but I go back to day one, and I'm a devout Christian, okay?
[01:11:53.823 --> 01:11:54.524]  Whatever that means.
[01:11:55.818 --> 01:11:56.739]  Absolutely!
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:17.683]  And it says that in the beginning there was one person named Adam.
[01:12:17.683 --> 01:12:20.665]  Now, we're not talking about who made him.
[01:12:20.665 --> 01:12:23.888]  We're not talking about, you know, Buddha, Muhammad, or Christ.
[01:12:23.888 --> 01:12:28.851]  This is one person created by the same force that created the universe.
[01:12:28.851 --> 01:12:32.314]  And one day he said to God, I am lonely.
[01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:38.779]  And when God didn't say, shut up, you can't be lonely, ain't nobody here but you, then that's when the conspiracy theory started.
[01:12:40.914 --> 01:12:43.015]  Once we let them get by with that.
[01:12:43.015 --> 01:12:46.357]  And then they told me that we killed you with Jesus on Friday.
[01:12:46.357 --> 01:12:48.238]  So I want you to call it a good day.
[01:12:48.238 --> 01:12:52.981]  So I call it a good Friday and don't have no problem with that.
[01:12:52.981 --> 01:12:56.544]  So last night, a story broke out of Memphis.
[01:12:56.544 --> 01:12:59.145]  Yesterday, I didn't get it till late.
[01:12:59.145 --> 01:13:08.691]  And I've been up all night calling folks with Greg Jones to announce last night, and for those of you that's listening, and Brother Jones, let me say to you,
[01:13:09.577 --> 01:13:11.539]  Money is not power.
[01:13:11.539 --> 01:13:13.400]  Education is not power.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.722]  But information is power.
[01:13:15.722 --> 01:13:19.005]  And if I give you bad information, you have bad power.
[01:13:19.005 --> 01:13:25.850]  And that's what America, you know, it wasn't that America started off, it always handled it like that.
[01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:35.778]  We're just beginning to see it now because of people like you and people who are willing to lay their life on the line to say, hey, this is what this is all about.
[01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:37.680]  Now, we got a hard job to do.
[01:13:38.596 --> 01:13:47.958]  Because if you look at the stats, America is one-sixth of the world's population, but we consume 94% of the world's hard drugs.
[01:13:47.958 --> 01:13:51.918]  That's not counting alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine.
[01:13:51.918 --> 01:13:59.360]  So when you realize what we got to work with, it is totally insane and crazy.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.460]  And so again, I say thanks to you.
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:06.321]  The story that broke, it was an African American, well no, it was a Negro man,
[01:14:07.742 --> 01:14:12.105]  In the early days of the Civil Rights Movement, he's a photographer.
[01:14:12.105 --> 01:14:20.752]  And I tell those of you on this listening that participate in Google, look this up so when you get off the finish the show.
[01:14:20.752 --> 01:14:28.837]  The Memphis, the number one morning paper in Memphis, the Memphis Appeal.
[01:14:28.837 --> 01:14:32.280]  The guy's name is Ernie Weathers.
[01:14:33.106 --> 01:14:36.948]  He has been documenting the civil rights movement.
[01:14:36.948 --> 01:14:38.750]  He's respected all over the world.
[01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:50.097]  And the story that broke yesterday is photographer Ernie Webber doubled as FBI informant to spy on the civil rights movement.
[01:14:50.097 --> 01:14:53.699]  So when you think about the people that have died,
[01:14:54.642 --> 01:15:00.726]  The people who have been framed, the people that have gone to jail, and you look back at this human being.
[01:15:00.726 --> 01:15:04.288]  Now, here's what's more bothering than that.
[01:15:04.288 --> 01:15:06.629]  Here's when they asked Andy Young about it.
[01:15:06.629 --> 01:15:11.352]  Andy Young, who was one of King's trusted lieutenants.
[01:15:11.352 --> 01:15:23.560]  Andy Young said that Andy, they quote Andy, now 78, said, it isn't bothering that Withers secretly worked
[01:15:24.091 --> 01:15:33.253]  As an informant, with sniping, with picking the civil rights movement, I always liked him.
[01:15:33.253 --> 01:15:35.633]  He was a good photographer.
[01:15:35.633 --> 01:15:40.154]  And then he says, what's wrong with a brother making some extra money?
[01:15:40.154 --> 01:15:46.695]  I don't think Dr. King would have mind him making a little money on the side.
[01:15:46.695 --> 01:15:52.656]  Now, let me tell you, if the Ku Klux Klan said that, huh?
[01:15:54.106 --> 01:16:07.209]  A white conservative Republican said that decent people would be out of their mind, but a thug like Andy Young can say that with admiration.
[01:16:07.209 --> 01:16:11.010]  That's like somebody said, oh, Hitler was a good photographer.
[01:16:11.010 --> 01:16:15.611]  And so again, when you look at this, and I've called my research
[01:16:16.803 --> 01:16:29.167]  Well, they're telling us that being a betrayer, being a Judas Iscariot, being a Benedict Arnold, being a spy is a good thing and that you should be proud of being treacherous.
[01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:34.668]  I mean, it's just like they tell us torture is good or pre-emptive wars are good.
[01:16:34.668 --> 01:16:42.291]  They're selling us pure evil and now exercising evil out in the open like they come out and say, yeah, we're growing the opium.
[01:16:42.291 --> 01:16:43.851]  Yeah, we're shipping the drugs in.
[01:16:43.851 --> 01:16:45.852]  Yeah, we put out fake Bin Laden videos.
[01:16:46.332 --> 01:16:51.596]  I mean, the CIA came out and they're just training us to accept pure evil.
[01:16:51.596 --> 01:16:59.381]  You know, when you have somebody answer a question like that, it sounds like they're covering themselves for the day when they will come out.
[01:16:59.381 --> 01:17:01.142]  Okay.
[01:17:01.142 --> 01:17:07.246]  There's no way the number one assassin in the history of planet Earth
[01:17:08.348 --> 01:17:12.431]  Was the King, and I say that because of the news media.
[01:17:12.431 --> 01:17:16.314]  Now there's many fascinating, but nobody got to see them, not with your eyes.
[01:17:16.314 --> 01:17:18.835]  And here's a man that's part of that.
[01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:25.160]  Next to him, one of his close advisors, is a photographer that was more than a photographer.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.060]  He was trusted.
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.002]  He sit in the room.
[01:17:28.002 --> 01:17:33.285]  He was given all the plans, what was going to happen, when it was going to happen.
[01:17:33.285 --> 01:17:36.708]  And he was heavily involved in the last day of King's life.
[01:17:37.113 --> 01:17:42.757]  This is incredible, so you're saying, is that the same photographer that took the famous shots of Jesse Jackson pointing?
[01:17:42.757 --> 01:17:44.758]  Yes, yes.
[01:17:44.758 --> 01:17:50.362]  That guy was a federal informant, and we know the government was involved in killing Martin Luther King.
[01:17:50.362 --> 01:17:53.124]  This is incredible.
[01:17:53.124 --> 01:17:57.167]  You know, when you stop and think, here's what else is incredible.
[01:17:57.167 --> 01:17:59.989]  If you go back, you remember that famous shot, right?
[01:17:59.989 --> 01:18:00.930]  Yes.
[01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:06.554]  Now think about, if you and I were standing on the balcony and a shot come out, are we going to hit the ground?
[01:18:07.423 --> 01:18:07.843]  Yes.
[01:18:07.843 --> 01:18:10.984]  Because we don't know if there's going to be another shot, right?
[01:18:10.984 --> 01:18:11.664]  Yes.
[01:18:11.664 --> 01:18:20.027]  So why was that group standing up pointing up the wrong direction when the shot really came from the ground?
[01:18:20.027 --> 01:18:22.528]  Unless they knew it wasn't going to be another shot.
[01:18:22.528 --> 01:18:28.170]  Well, that's the word I've gotten about... Well, there's been some questions about Mr. Jackson.
[01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.891]  There's been a lot of questions about Jackson.
[01:18:29.891 --> 01:18:32.572]  There's been a lot of questions about a whole lot of people.
[01:18:32.572 --> 01:18:36.413]  When you read this article, there'll start being questions about Benjamin Hooks.
[01:18:37.225 --> 01:18:42.569]  There started being questions about a whole lot of people in that movement who nobody ever suspected.
[01:18:42.569 --> 01:18:45.972]  Because let me tell you how I get tricked.
[01:18:45.972 --> 01:18:48.774]  I grew up in the Baptist church, okay?
[01:18:48.774 --> 01:18:52.057]  I grew up seeing pictures of Judas.
[01:18:52.057 --> 01:18:55.200]  And Judas, they told me when I was a little boy, Judas portrayed
[01:18:55.996 --> 01:18:59.418]  Jesus Christ, and Judas always had this strange look on his face.
[01:18:59.418 --> 01:19:11.105]  So when you see that as a little boy, you think anybody that's working as a performer, uh, an informant, you can tell that this guy was so kind and peaceful and loving.
[01:19:11.105 --> 01:19:15.808]  And so now, the whole Judas thing, Judas has a new face now.
[01:19:15.808 --> 01:19:19.531]  And so when you stop and think about, and when you, when you read that article,
[01:19:20.638 --> 01:19:27.347]  You will see a whole lot of folks that they ask questions to be invaded if it is what happened.
[01:19:27.347 --> 01:19:34.777]  Yeah you're saying a lot of other inner people are acting suspicious and saying hey there's no big deal being a federal informant and as you're saying that shows that
[01:19:35.595 --> 01:19:39.958]  The evidence is they don't feel guilty because they did it too.
[01:19:39.958 --> 01:19:41.859]  Mr. Gregory, stay there.
[01:19:41.859 --> 01:19:43.941]  We've got a quick break coming up.

[01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:01.111]  Good day.
[01:21:01.111 --> 01:21:02.833]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:21:02.833 --> 01:21:03.314]  September 14th, 2010.
[01:21:03.314 --> 01:21:04.395]  Gold open this morning at $12.5720.
[01:21:04.395 --> 01:21:07.579]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $12.9050, $6.4525 for a half-ounce, or $3.2263 for a quarter-ounce.
[01:21:07.579 --> 01:21:08.079]  That's $12.9050, $6.4525, or $3.2263.
[01:21:20.146 --> 01:21:23.987]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[01:21:23.987 --> 01:21:25.147]  debt crises.
[01:21:25.147 --> 01:21:27.308]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[01:21:27.308 --> 01:21:29.728]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[01:21:29.728 --> 01:21:35.069]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[01:21:35.069 --> 01:21:36.069]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:36.069 --> 01:21:42.031]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:47.852]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.
[01:21:48.192 --> 01:21:48.873]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.873 --> 01:21:49.633]  I'll send it free.
[01:21:49.633 --> 01:21:50.294]  Again, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.294 --> 01:21:51.355]  Ask for the CBO document.
[01:21:51.355 --> 01:21:51.575]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:02.814 --> 01:22:04.955]  We're subject to other police action.
[01:22:04.955 --> 01:22:06.216]  Tyranny is here.
[01:22:06.216 --> 01:22:09.937]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:22:09.937 --> 01:22:12.398]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:22:12.398 --> 01:22:18.261]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:22:18.261 --> 01:22:24.484]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:22:24.924 --> 01:22:30.909]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:22:30.909 --> 01:22:35.092]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:22:35.092 --> 01:22:39.375]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:45.319]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:22:45.319 --> 01:22:48.882]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:22:48.882 --> 01:22:50.843]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:22:50.843 --> 01:22:51.304]  It's here.

[01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:05.394]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[01:23:05.394 --> 01:23:06.094]  Listen!
[01:23:06.094 --> 01:23:10.377]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:23:10.377 --> 01:23:13.759]  Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[01:23:13.759 --> 01:23:16.802]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[01:23:16.802 --> 01:23:20.184]  They wanted me to go on Plavix but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[01:23:20.583 --> 01:23:28.994]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[01:23:28.994 --> 01:23:31.578]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[01:23:31.578 --> 01:23:35.924]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.
[01:23:36.164 --> 01:23:40.367]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.

[01:24:15.402 --> 01:24:17.102]  Alright, going back to Dick Gregory.
[01:24:17.102 --> 01:24:20.504]  Dick, we've got limited time here with you, but this is major breaking news.
[01:24:20.504 --> 01:24:24.205]  I want to Google search that headline out of the Memphis newspaper.
[01:24:24.205 --> 01:24:26.526]  Give us the name of the paper and the headline again.
[01:24:26.526 --> 01:24:29.147]  We're also simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:24:29.147 --> 01:24:32.488]  We'll put that news article up as a record of what you've been covering.
[01:24:32.488 --> 01:24:35.990]  Give us the news headline and the newspaper.
[01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:38.551]  The Memphis Commercial Appeal, it was in
[01:24:39.426 --> 01:24:51.271]  Monday's paper and the headline was photographer Ernie Willis doubled at FBI informant to spy on the civil rights
[01:24:51.744 --> 01:25:01.068]  So if you just search man doubled as informant to spy on civil rights movement, that should pull it up from the Memphis Appeal.
[01:25:01.068 --> 01:25:03.149]  We're going to get that up on screen right now.
[01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:05.810]  Now, obviously, sir, it's an honor to have you.
[01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:10.752]  I want to get you back up soon now that I know you like the work we're doing and are familiar with it.
[01:25:10.752 --> 01:25:15.494]  But I do want to start getting into your 9-11 hunger strike and that whole giant issue.
[01:25:15.494 --> 01:25:17.715]  But any other points you want to make.
[01:25:18.355 --> 01:25:18.676]  We're good.
[01:25:35.134 --> 01:25:41.296]  And so what we're looking at now is, when you look at September the 11th, the reason this is different, because when you look at all the other fascinations
[01:26:04.801 --> 01:26:08.005]  Before Kennedy was killed, did you have a show?
[01:26:08.005 --> 01:26:11.408]  Okay, so there was nobody out here.
[01:26:13.759 --> 01:26:37.086]  And you were the guy that made them admit, they called you a conspiracy theorist, that the head coroner at the Air Force, a colonel, said he had a bullet hole in his head and others did.
[01:26:37.086 --> 01:26:41.448]  We know they had special forces on board, they killed everybody, blew the hatch and he load out.
[01:26:41.448 --> 01:26:41.748]  Go ahead.
[01:26:42.329 --> 01:26:43.690]  Well, here's what happened.
[01:26:43.690 --> 01:26:48.455]  They couldn't deny it, because the people that did the autopsy brought the pictures to me.
[01:26:48.455 --> 01:26:49.175]  That's right.
[01:26:49.175 --> 01:26:51.838]  And so I'm saying, we have outlets now.
[01:26:51.838 --> 01:26:53.960]  But let me just tell you one thing.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.221]  Is your mother alive?
[01:26:55.221 --> 01:26:56.222]  Yes.
[01:26:56.222 --> 01:26:56.842]  Alright.
[01:26:56.842 --> 01:27:01.046]  If you walked in the house and your mother was on the phone, and you said, who are you talking to?
[01:27:01.046 --> 01:27:03.168]  She said, I just dialed 911.
[01:27:03.168 --> 01:27:05.050]  What kind of look do you think you would have on your face?
[01:27:06.863 --> 01:27:13.849]  Alright, anytime you say 911, that tells the brain to be scared.
[01:27:14.642 --> 01:27:19.044]  So of course they picked 9-11 as a psy-op and as a calling card.
[01:27:19.044 --> 01:27:24.027]  That's right, but remember in America we never use a number for the month.
[01:27:24.027 --> 01:27:29.409]  We say Halloween is October 31st, Christmas is December 25th.
[01:27:29.409 --> 01:27:37.293]  We use a number for the first time because they have done the research and know every time you say that what happens.
[01:27:37.293 --> 01:27:39.874]  And the subconscious message exactly is
[01:27:41.175 --> 01:27:42.675]  Well, let me just say this to you here.
[01:27:42.675 --> 01:27:44.496]  Because you know so much about the news media.
[01:28:12.506 --> 01:28:16.809]  If you was working for NBC, right?
[01:28:16.809 --> 01:28:25.715]  And on September the 11th, you witnessed, you're the one that had the video camera that took that second building being hit, right?
[01:28:25.715 --> 01:28:27.776]  That's right.
[01:28:27.776 --> 01:28:31.298]  You would want to pull a surprise, okay?
[01:28:31.298 --> 01:28:36.982]  Your name would be world-renowned, and you would get 40,000 hours of speech.
[01:28:36.982 --> 01:28:39.664]  How come we don't know who took that picture, huh?
[01:28:40.484 --> 01:28:48.606]  How come one of the most famous pictures in the history of the planet, how come nobody knows the name of the person that took that picture?
[01:28:48.606 --> 01:28:54.408]  And so, and so, you see, they don't count on folks like us, like you, and people.
[01:28:54.408 --> 01:28:59.130]  See, there's a lot of people that know things, but they never had nobody to call.
[01:28:59.130 --> 01:29:00.230]  I know what you do.
[01:29:00.230 --> 01:29:01.850]  I know how many people call you.
[01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:03.891]  I know you got the fifth studio.
[01:29:03.891 --> 01:29:07.212]  You got to have fantastic research, because the government will give you tips.
[01:29:08.047 --> 01:29:09.869]  To throw everybody off.
[01:29:09.869 --> 01:29:12.891]  And so you have to look through it and say, wow, okay.
[01:29:12.891 --> 01:29:22.019]  And so consequently, if you look at the fire station, which is a block and a half away from the World Trade Building.
[01:29:22.019 --> 01:29:24.861]  And that day, there was 343 firefighters that died.
[01:29:29.554 --> 01:29:31.475]  Hold on, Dick Gregory, long segment coming up.
[01:29:31.475 --> 01:29:33.155]  Sorry, that one was short.
[01:29:33.155 --> 01:29:39.837]  Dick Gregory is our guest civil rights icon, and I love the way his mind works, all these angles, points he's making.
[01:29:39.837 --> 01:29:41.057]  He's asking questions.
[01:29:41.057 --> 01:29:42.737]  He's being a skeptic.
[01:29:42.737 --> 01:29:45.438]  He's questioning his government, the greatest form of patriotism.
[01:29:45.438 --> 01:29:46.918]  We'll be right back with Dick Gregory.
[01:29:46.918 --> 01:29:50.919]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:52.320]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.840]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:57.521]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:03.243]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:30:03.243 --> 01:30:07.026]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:30:07.026 --> 01:30:09.909]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:30:09.909 --> 01:30:14.834]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:15.274 --> 01:30:21.217]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[01:30:21.217 --> 01:30:26.900]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:31.422]  Try their new Evacuation Pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[01:30:31.422 --> 01:30:39.927]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[01:30:39.927 --> 01:30:41.708]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:30:42.128 --> 01:30:44.489]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.

[01:31:04.174 --> 01:31:05.434]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:05.434 --> 01:31:09.375]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:11.776]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:11.776 --> 01:31:17.477]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:17.477 --> 01:31:23.719]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.139 --> 01:31:30.123]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.123 --> 01:31:34.286]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.286 --> 01:31:38.588]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:38.588 --> 01:31:44.532]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:48.094]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.094 --> 01:31:50.055]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.055 --> 01:31:50.496]  It's here.

[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:16.205]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:32:16.205 --> 01:32:19.867]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:20.888 --> 01:32:33.660]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:40.926]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:32:41.607 --> 01:32:51.978]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:32:51.978 --> 01:32:55.902]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:32:55.902 --> 01:32:59.026]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:33:06.917 --> 01:33:22.009]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:33:22.009 --> 01:33:24.611]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:27.418 --> 01:33:31.262]  Dick Gregory's our guest, DickGregory.com.
[01:33:31.262 --> 01:33:33.985]  I mean, he's exposed it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:33.985 --> 01:33:46.457]  The murder of Ron Brown, the CIA drug trafficking, now he's on 9-11, JFK, RFK, MLK, and we're gonna definitely have him back up on a routine basis.
[01:33:48.015 --> 01:33:52.658]  Really glad we got him on the show, because I've always liked Dick Gregory.
[01:33:52.658 --> 01:34:03.286]  I know that much of the black leadership are a bunch of paid-off foundation eugenicists who've done their job to make sure 51% of blacks haven't been born since 1973, and I want to bring that up with him before he leaves us today.
[01:34:03.286 --> 01:34:08.109]  You see, I look at a child, a black child, a white child, a Hispanic child, an Asian child.
[01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:14.134]  I may not like racists that are in all their groups that don't like me because of the color of my skin, but I love those children, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:15.387 --> 01:34:19.169]  And let me tell you something, I think about all those millions of dead black babies every day.
[01:34:19.169 --> 01:34:22.650]  But side issue, it's big though, and I want to raise that later.
[01:34:22.650 --> 01:34:25.431]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors that made today's show possible.
[01:34:25.431 --> 01:34:28.152]  I love this new sponsor, and I'm using it in my own home.
[01:34:28.152 --> 01:34:29.433]  We don't watch a lot of television.
[01:34:30.427 --> 01:34:31.648]  Mainly, you know, DVDs.
[01:34:31.648 --> 01:34:33.109]  We're not even really hooked up to television.
[01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:34.951]  We have to put the rabbit ears on.
[01:34:34.951 --> 01:34:38.814]  But it's so hard to program a TV with all the adult channels that it doesn't seem to work.
[01:34:38.814 --> 01:34:41.036]  Well, this will do that very easily.
[01:34:41.036 --> 01:34:45.300]  And it's a power cop, where the plug just goes into this little easy-to-use box.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:47.061]  It's like a clock radio.
[01:34:47.061 --> 01:34:49.784]  I mean, I'm not very technical, and I know how to use it easily.
[01:34:49.784 --> 01:34:50.484]  We tested it out.
[01:34:50.484 --> 01:34:53.767]  We got it about three months ago, and now I approved it, and it's a sponsor.
[01:34:53.767 --> 01:34:54.848]  I have to prove each sponsor.
[01:34:54.848 --> 01:34:57.711]  We say no to more than 80% of the sponsors that come to us.
[01:34:58.291 --> 01:35:02.416]  So it makes it tough to fund our operation because we only promote things that I believe in.
[01:35:02.416 --> 01:35:09.023]  But parents, are your kids wasting away hours and hours watching TV or playing computer and video games?
[01:35:09.023 --> 01:35:09.984]  Are their grades slipping?
[01:35:09.984 --> 01:35:11.766]  Is your family time non-existent?
[01:35:11.766 --> 01:35:12.587]  If so...
[01:35:13.817 --> 01:35:15.358]  We have the answer.
[01:35:15.358 --> 01:35:17.659]  Get control back with the PowerCop.
[01:35:17.659 --> 01:35:22.762]  The PowerCop is an easy to use programmable device which limits the amount of time you allow them to use each day.
[01:35:22.762 --> 01:35:23.943]  So you don't have to watch them.
[01:35:23.943 --> 01:35:29.406]  You can say if you do all your chores and stuff you get one hour of video games every two days or one hour of TV.
[01:35:29.406 --> 01:35:34.189]  The PowerCop is an easy to use programmable device which limits the amount of time they can watch.
[01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:35.510]  Childhood obesity is on the rise.
[01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:38.732]  Get your kids away from the screen and get them active again.
[01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:41.293]  Take control of your family with the PowerCop.
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:54.705]  6-941-COP, 800-6941-COP, 800-6941-COP, or go to ThePowerCop.com.
[01:35:54.705 --> 01:35:58.127]  One word, ThePowerCop.com.
[01:35:58.127 --> 01:35:59.148]  Great new sponsor.
[01:35:59.148 --> 01:36:02.290]  And lastly, I want to tell you about Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.391]  The fabric's made here in the U.S.
[01:36:04.391 --> 01:36:06.153]  It's sewn here in the U.S.
[01:36:06.153 --> 01:36:10.055]  You know, triple-sewn motorcycle jeans, regular jeans, shirts.
[01:36:10.055 --> 01:36:11.436]  They've got a lot of free deals right now.
[01:36:11.436 --> 01:36:16.740]  When you buy any one product, get a free Don't Tread on Me bandana that's made out of great gusset denim.
[01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:19.182]  GussetClothing.com, all made in America.
[01:36:19.182 --> 01:36:22.785]  GussetClothing.com, or 888GUSSET.
[01:36:22.785 --> 01:36:27.468]  4-H Gusset, G-U-S-S-E-T, Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:36:27.468 --> 01:36:30.351]  Check out all the great made-in-America products at
[01:36:30.891 --> 01:36:35.334]  What we left off was that there were 343 firefighters that died that day, not counting the one that was injured.
[01:37:01.004 --> 01:37:11.510]  So if you look at the fire station, the company that was one and a half blocks from the World Trade Center.
[01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:19.354]  So when they looked at the World Trade Center, because of the insurance company, there's 54,000 people that worked in that building.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:30.063]  And so when you stop and think about, in the course of a day, 130,000 people would come in that building, not counting the workers.
[01:37:30.063 --> 01:37:35.304]  So if your smoke detector, the battery, blow out at home, you go get another one.
[01:37:35.304 --> 01:37:41.306]  But because of the insurance in the World Trade Building, you can't just go get one.
[01:37:41.306 --> 01:37:49.108]  You have to call the fire department, and that company right around the corner would bring and come and fix it, and then they'd send you a bill.
[01:37:50.017 --> 01:37:58.156]  That company would go a minimum of 50 times a day to the World Trade Building, a maximum of 75 times a day, every day!
[01:37:59.557 --> 01:38:08.781]  The day of September the 11th, not one firefighter from Company 7, a block and a half, was killed or injured.
[01:38:08.781 --> 01:38:12.102]  Now somebody got to say, wait a minute, did somebody know something?
[01:38:12.102 --> 01:38:21.346]  All these firefighters come in and we got 343 killed, not one killed or injured in a fire station a block away.
[01:38:21.346 --> 01:38:25.268]  So when you start looking at all of these things that hang out too,
[01:38:26.841 --> 01:38:33.425]  That building was built really by Rockefeller when Nelson Rockefeller was governor.
[01:38:33.425 --> 01:38:42.009]  You see, that area was the only area since the Depression that was an economic disaster.
[01:38:42.009 --> 01:38:46.812]  So Rockefeller decided when he was governor, he would ram a bill through
[01:38:47.617 --> 01:38:49.719]  We're good to go.
[01:38:49.719 --> 01:38:50.579]  We're good to go.
[01:39:14.588 --> 01:39:17.350]  Especially to rent office space.
[01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:19.732]  That's how they fill that building up.
[01:39:19.732 --> 01:39:27.539]  And so consequently, the reason the Port Authority cops guarded, and a lot of Port Authority cops got killed.
[01:39:27.539 --> 01:39:35.786]  Let me tell you, if there's a bombing today at the Empire State Building, the Port Authority cops have no jurisdiction over that.
[01:39:35.786 --> 01:39:38.168]  Because that's not a state building.
[01:39:38.168 --> 01:39:42.692]  Now, think about when that building was blown up.
[01:39:43.479 --> 01:39:46.060]  It had been sold.
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:47.701]  Leased, which is sold.
[01:39:47.701 --> 01:39:50.862]  Now think about that nobody's talking about.
[01:39:50.862 --> 01:40:03.326]  If you have a World Trade Building that is owned and financed by tax money in the state, then how are you going to lease it or sell it to somebody without having a bid?
[01:40:03.326 --> 01:40:08.968]  How are you going to lease it or sell it to somebody without anybody knowing this transition that happened?
[01:40:08.968 --> 01:40:10.189]  And so when they took Selma,
[01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:31.454]  Well they were also running a drill that day of tripod two of the towers being attacked so they were using that to make everybody stand down.
[01:40:31.454 --> 01:40:36.775]  They also went on the loudspeakers and told everybody stay at their desk because they needed somebody to get killed that day.
[01:40:36.775 --> 01:40:37.575]  This is all on record.
[01:40:38.117 --> 01:40:42.900]  That's right, and so when you stop and look and see, here's the funny thing.
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:51.884]  Everybody thinks, you know, that Fox News is right and CNN is... Let me tell you, at the top, all of it is the same.
[01:40:51.884 --> 01:40:55.566]  How come you don't hear nobody on Fox News talking about the Federal Reserve?
[01:40:55.566 --> 01:40:58.588]  How come you don't hear nobody saying what you just said?
[01:40:58.588 --> 01:41:05.851]  Is the New York Times and Fox News and CNN all day that much dumber than us when Kennedy was shot?
[01:41:07.395 --> 01:41:10.077]  His car turned down Elm Street.
[01:41:10.077 --> 01:41:12.278]  That car was not supposed to go down Elm Street.
[01:41:12.278 --> 01:41:15.961]  That decision was made a week before.
[01:41:15.961 --> 01:41:24.226]  Now, then if that car wasn't supposed to go down Elm Street, how did Lee Harvey Oswald know to get a job there if it wasn't coming there?
[01:41:24.226 --> 01:41:33.793]  So when you just look at the small pieces and you turn them around, the big mystery to me is, with 54,000 people working in that building,
[01:41:34.813 --> 01:41:37.155]  And we know 3,000 plus was killed.
[01:41:37.155 --> 01:41:39.557]  X amount went to the hospital.
[01:41:39.557 --> 01:41:42.639]  You got 47,000 people that got away.
[01:41:42.639 --> 01:41:44.461]  How come nobody's never interviewed one of them?
[01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:51.664]  How come they don't say, well, on the 5th anniversary, we're gonna bring the winner who beat it?
[01:41:51.664 --> 01:41:55.186]  We got 40,000 people that got away.
[01:41:55.186 --> 01:41:57.767]  How come we don't put them in a big football arena?
[01:41:57.767 --> 01:42:01.529]  How come there's such a mystery around the one that got away?
[01:42:01.529 --> 01:42:04.931]  How come most Americans say, Building 7, what's that?
[01:42:06.232 --> 01:42:11.413]  And the news announced it had fallen in its own footprint an hour before, 25 minutes before.
[01:42:11.413 --> 01:42:14.914]  They said it's fallen from fires in its own footprint, a total collapse.
[01:42:14.914 --> 01:42:16.595]  That had never happened in history.
[01:42:16.595 --> 01:42:19.515]  Happened three times that day, and we have the footage.
[01:42:19.515 --> 01:42:23.056]  Multiple newscasts, police saying, get back, they're blowing it up.
[01:42:23.056 --> 01:42:27.437]  I mean, and that building was FBI, CIA, Port Authority.
[01:42:27.437 --> 01:42:28.658]  That was their command base.
[01:42:28.658 --> 01:42:32.399]  That was the command base, and that didn't happen until 5.20 that evening.
[01:42:33.946 --> 01:42:34.767]  That sounds scary.
[01:42:34.767 --> 01:42:41.914]  You know, when we look at the top two buildings that fell, and let me tell you something else that you can pull up and look.
[01:42:41.914 --> 01:42:54.866]  The next day, that was on the 11th, 12th, on Wednesday, the San Francisco Chronicle ran a front page story where Mayor Willie Brown
[01:42:55.689 --> 01:43:02.676]  of San Francisco had been warned not to take that Tuesday morning flight into New York.
[01:43:02.676 --> 01:43:05.920]  Now, at the time, nobody said who warned them.
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:08.022]  We know now it was Carlita Rice.
[01:43:08.022 --> 01:43:10.064]  Now, that was a front page story.
[01:43:10.064 --> 01:43:13.627]  Do you know no other paper ever ran that story?
[01:43:13.627 --> 01:43:18.032]  Now, you go back to that Friday, which would have been the 14th.
[01:43:20.017 --> 01:43:38.625]  They had another front page story in the San Francisco Chronicle that said that ex-Secretary of State George Shultz had been, he had received information on September the 4th that, no, September the 7th that that deal was gonna go.
[01:43:39.432 --> 01:43:51.462]  And nobody rang, even the Secretary of State said yes, I had information, front page story, in San Francisco Chronicle, and no other paper picked that up.
[01:43:51.462 --> 01:43:53.944]  You have put options and call options.
[01:43:53.944 --> 01:43:55.886]  Now my grandmother wouldn't know what that is.
[01:43:55.886 --> 01:43:58.688]  That means that today you and I can bet
[01:43:59.582 --> 01:44:03.664]  That we believe that Sears & Roebuck stock is going to go up.
[01:44:03.664 --> 01:44:05.644]  And we can put $30 million.
[01:44:05.644 --> 01:44:07.085]  If it goes down, we lose it.
[01:44:07.085 --> 01:44:10.286]  If it goes up, we got a gravy train.
[01:44:10.286 --> 01:44:24.171]  On the day of September 11, there were 6,400 people that had bet the day before that the United Airlines stock would go down.
[01:44:25.290 --> 01:44:26.471]  There was 6,000 some people.
[01:44:26.471 --> 01:44:27.072]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:53.134]  In order for you to make a bet they have to know who you are so they can pay you off if you win or know who to collect it from if you lose, right?
[01:44:53.134 --> 01:44:53.954]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:53.954 --> 01:45:00.038]  How come nobody's ever brought those folks in for a hearing to find out?
[01:45:00.038 --> 01:45:03.860]  The other thing is, in your home state, when that
[01:45:05.522 --> 01:45:06.463]  Yes.
[01:45:06.463 --> 01:45:06.623]  Yes.
[01:45:22.819 --> 01:45:33.188]  They took all of the debris, they tatted to a little mafia place in Brooklyn, that's what we're doing the hauling, put it on barges, and then shipped it to China.
[01:45:33.188 --> 01:45:36.811]  And nobody's been indicted for interfering with a crime scene.
[01:45:36.811 --> 01:45:44.718]  And so when you stop and think about, you know, how they do it, and all of the papers we choose side, this is a good paper
[01:45:45.598 --> 01:45:53.580]  But let's not forget who ran security on the World Trade Center, Marvin Bush's company, but his contract ended September 10th.
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:55.080]  But let's go further.
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:46:06.243]  Newsweek and AP reported Bush signed the launch order to attack Afghanistan September 10th, and they attacked Kabul the night of the attack.
[01:46:06.243 --> 01:46:09.023]  How did he have the aircraft carriers two months before ready?
[01:46:09.023 --> 01:46:12.304]  How did he have 44,000 US troops in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan?
[01:46:12.884 --> 01:46:16.246]  How did he have his brother declare martial law in Florida the day before?
[01:46:16.246 --> 01:46:16.627]  Yep.
[01:46:16.627 --> 01:46:23.392]  I mean, when you stop and think about, you know, it's so open and plain, but then I go back to what I said before.
[01:46:23.392 --> 01:46:36.021]  When you have a nation that one-sixth of the world's population but consumes 94% of the world's drugs, that's not alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine.
[01:46:36.021 --> 01:46:37.422]  And let me tell you something else, brother.
[01:46:38.212 --> 01:46:40.453]  Every 30 seconds, you and I have been talking.
[01:46:40.453 --> 01:46:45.235]  A woman in America has been beat up by her boyfriend or husband.
[01:46:45.235 --> 01:46:46.475]  No Taliban?
[01:46:46.475 --> 01:46:51.037]  So when you stop and think about this country, we call America the beautiful.
[01:46:51.037 --> 01:46:57.039]  There's a whole lot of things that have to happen before this country gets back to be the beautiful country that we want to believe in.
[01:46:57.039 --> 01:47:00.280]  It's become America the Babylon.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:01.381]  Yes, yes.
[01:47:01.381 --> 01:47:03.902]  Well, I'll put it better than that.
[01:47:03.902 --> 01:47:06.543]  You know the story of Simon and Gabor, right?
[01:47:06.543 --> 01:47:06.743]  Yes.
[01:47:07.688 --> 01:47:15.757]  If this guy don't do something to America quick, then God owe a serious apology to Simon and Gamal.
[01:47:15.757 --> 01:47:19.101]  So somewhere, now here's where I fit in.
[01:47:19.101 --> 01:47:26.669]  I'm looking at this and I'm saying, oh God, when you take those, listen, we spend trillions of dollars a month
[01:47:27.526 --> 01:47:28.867]  For security.
[01:47:28.867 --> 01:47:39.876]  And you tell me some snotty nosed punk, little dudes from foreign countries that can't speak English, most of them ain't never been to college, can slip in.
[01:47:39.876 --> 01:47:42.578]  It's just like the Mexicans coming across the border.
[01:47:43.258 --> 01:47:51.203]  If you got Mexicans come across the border, can't read or write, never been to school, if they can get across that border, well, what is the KGB doing?
[01:47:51.203 --> 01:47:52.864]  What is printing cowards doing?
[01:47:52.864 --> 01:47:57.087]  They're not doing nothing because we're not going to permit them to come across.
[01:47:57.087 --> 01:48:02.770]  So when you see these folks coming across the border, they're not coming across because they love America.
[01:48:02.770 --> 01:48:06.192]  They're coming across because they're coming over here to get jobs.
[01:48:06.192 --> 01:48:09.995]  And if I came to Austin, Texas today and opened up a liquor store,
[01:48:10.775 --> 01:48:14.839]  And only sold liquor to 13-year-old children and down.
[01:48:14.839 --> 01:48:17.581]  If you're 13 and 9, you can buy whiskey.
[01:48:17.581 --> 01:48:23.006]  If you're a cop, you don't come and arrest the children, you arrest me!
[01:48:23.006 --> 01:48:31.253]  So, why are we gonna arrest the Mexicans coming over the border instead of arresting the people that's luring them over with jobs?
[01:48:31.253 --> 01:48:33.094]  And you do that very simple.
[01:48:33.094 --> 01:48:38.599]  If your company gets caught hiding illegals, you lose the right to do business.
[01:48:39.039 --> 01:48:40.020]  For 30 days.
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:43.461]  But they don't want to stop it because they want to drive down the wages.
[01:48:43.461 --> 01:48:51.265]  I know that, but I'm saying the American people, the American people is bitter with the folks that's coming through for the jobs instead of being bitter.
[01:48:51.265 --> 01:48:54.407]  It's a funny thing about American mentality.
[01:48:55.007 --> 01:48:57.789]  We will always attack the underdog.
[01:48:57.789 --> 01:49:01.771]  Do you know how many people I speak to, man, is fighting for your life?
[01:49:01.771 --> 01:49:05.894]  Oh, man, can you believe he's taking on this and he's taking on that?
[01:49:05.894 --> 01:49:09.956]  One person with courage has always been the majority.
[01:49:09.956 --> 01:49:15.019]  And so consequently, when you stop and think about it, you're too close to understand your influence.
[01:49:15.379 --> 01:49:16.080]  I'm out here.
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.322]  I travel 250 days a year.
[01:49:18.322 --> 01:49:20.765]  I travel 24 hours a day.
[01:49:20.765 --> 01:49:22.306]  And your name keeps coming up.
[01:49:22.306 --> 01:49:23.468]  And I heard it here.
[01:49:23.468 --> 01:49:25.630]  And see, it's kind of interesting.
[01:49:25.630 --> 01:49:30.555]  When I go to a doctor, I trust that I thought my headache was a headache.
[01:49:30.555 --> 01:49:32.317]  And then you tell me it's a brain tumor.
[01:49:32.897 --> 01:49:34.399]  I don't need no second opinion.
[01:49:34.399 --> 01:49:35.460]  I trust you.
[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:38.683]  Well, that's the way people feel about you across this country.
[01:49:38.683 --> 01:49:50.936]  They trust you, and so people who don't have the research and the finances to do the research, they pick it up, and they know, and then they promote it to their mother, to their friends, to their children.
[01:49:52.057 --> 01:49:53.477]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:49:53.477 --> 01:50:09.740]  I've now discovered from insiders that Glenn Beck is taking what Oprah Winfrey does and what I do and he has a team that fuses it together and then puts a pro-torture, pro-war, pro-patriot act on it and he's now copying but twisting.
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:10.761]  What do I do about that?
[01:50:10.761 --> 01:50:18.162]  Because I feel dirty that my message that I mean to be good and pure is being turned into a counterfeit.
[01:50:18.922 --> 01:50:20.526]  Well, let me tell you this here.
[01:50:20.526 --> 01:50:22.971]  Let's say you own General Motors, right?
[01:50:22.971 --> 01:50:25.878]  Then I'll go buy me a Cadillac and use it to take up a bank.
[01:50:25.878 --> 01:50:27.181]  Ain't a damn thing you can do about it.
[01:50:29.864 --> 01:50:34.746]  You're not making it for me to stick up banks, but when I buy it, I got a right to stick up.
[01:50:34.746 --> 01:50:36.827]  Use it as a getaway car.
[01:50:36.827 --> 01:50:41.508]  So it just makes us smarter and flicker and hipper.
[01:50:41.508 --> 01:50:43.889]  And so there's nothing you can do about it.
[01:50:43.889 --> 01:50:47.871]  But you see, all of this will be exposed.
[01:50:47.871 --> 01:50:48.431]  Look, look, look.
[01:50:48.431 --> 01:50:49.731]  Well, Dick, stay there.
[01:50:49.731 --> 01:50:50.712]  Dick Gregory's our guest.
[01:50:50.712 --> 01:50:52.052]  Amazingdickgregory.com.
[01:50:52.052 --> 01:50:55.253]  We're going to get into a whole bunch of other issues on the other side.
[01:50:55.253 --> 01:50:55.834]  Stay with us.
[01:50:55.834 --> 01:50:56.494]  Amazing interview.
[01:51:00.984 --> 01:51:02.285]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.285 --> 01:51:07.868]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.868 --> 01:51:12.890]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.890 --> 01:51:17.933]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.453 --> 01:51:23.675]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.675 --> 01:51:30.797]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.797 --> 01:51:31.917]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.917 --> 01:51:38.259]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.599 --> 01:51:41.780]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:44.001]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:45.141 --> 01:51:48.582]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.582 --> 01:51:50.322]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:02.537 --> 01:52:04.281]  What is a wind generator?
[01:52:04.281 --> 01:52:06.687]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[01:52:06.687 --> 01:52:10.055]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[01:52:10.055 --> 01:52:12.000]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[01:53:01.069 --> 01:53:02.230]  Attention gun owners!

[01:54:13.029 --> 01:54:16.432]  Dick's going to be with us about 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:54:16.432 --> 01:54:17.273]  Amazing interview.
[01:54:17.273 --> 01:54:18.795]  I want to get into a host of issues.
[01:54:18.795 --> 01:54:22.178]  You know, we forget about Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.
[01:54:22.178 --> 01:54:35.450]  I mean, after Dick Gregory exposed it and the colonel leaked him the photos, I mean, they shot those guys in the head and blew the hatch and special forces put on their mask and then they remote controlled it into a mountainside over in Serbia.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.300]  And they killed him.
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:39.241]  He said, if I go down, Clinton's going down.
[01:54:39.241 --> 01:54:41.081]  And they said, you die.
[01:54:41.081 --> 01:54:44.042]  And they killed that whole group of CEOs on board that plane.
[01:54:44.042 --> 01:54:46.022]  They're not playing games.
[01:54:46.022 --> 01:54:48.963]  Just like they're stealing the death benefits of the dead troops.
[01:54:48.963 --> 01:54:49.863]  Bloomberg.
[01:54:49.863 --> 01:54:52.663]  Just like they're telling you DU's good for the troops.
[01:54:52.663 --> 01:54:54.944]  I mean, these are some cold, hardcore killers.
[01:54:54.944 --> 01:54:56.464]  People say, well, why are you still alive?
[01:54:56.464 --> 01:54:58.224]  Well, they may end up killing me someday.
[01:54:58.224 --> 01:55:00.765]  But the point is, they know that'll make my message that much stronger.
[01:55:01.565 --> 01:55:01.806]  I don't
[01:55:23.047 --> 01:55:23.787]  Margaret Sanger.
[01:55:23.787 --> 01:55:24.688]  I've done deep research.
[01:55:24.688 --> 01:55:27.349]  I actually sent off to the universities and got the actual letters.
[01:55:27.349 --> 01:55:28.649]  Not just stuff on the internet.
[01:55:28.649 --> 01:55:32.150]  Where she said, look, we've got to kill these sub-human weeds.
[01:55:32.150 --> 01:55:33.951]  And we've got to pose as liberals.
[01:55:33.951 --> 01:55:35.592]  We've got to hire black leaders.
[01:55:35.592 --> 01:55:37.532]  We've got to pose as liberals.
[01:55:37.532 --> 01:55:39.273]  And we're going to get these people.
[01:55:39.713 --> 01:55:41.254]  Before we go into that, let me just finish up my Sept.
[01:55:41.254 --> 01:55:41.455]  11 piece.
[01:56:07.697 --> 01:56:10.379]  Yo, go ahead sir, sorry, I'm ranting.
[01:56:10.379 --> 01:56:20.927]  I decided, uh, looking at the firefighters and the first responders running into a building when everybody else was running out.
[01:56:20.927 --> 01:56:28.993]  And just looking at this 900 first responders have died because of what was in the air and nobody give a damn.
[01:56:28.993 --> 01:56:35.138]  So I decided this September the 11th that I was going to go on a
[01:56:35.785 --> 01:56:36.105]  I think so.
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:57:06.768]  And fasting and praying and asking people around the world at 12 noon every day at your time, just tune in to a meditation or a prayer that the truth will come out.
[01:57:06.768 --> 01:57:10.871]  Now the folks that believe the truth is out, then why not pray?
[01:57:10.871 --> 01:57:12.432]  Pray that the truth will come out.
[01:57:12.432 --> 01:57:15.814]  Those of us that know what the truth is, you'd be surprised.
[01:57:15.814 --> 01:57:20.137]  You'd think, these folks can mess with this, they can do this, but the one thing they can't do.
[01:57:20.957 --> 01:57:24.680]  On a clear night, look up at the Big Dipper and the Milky Way.
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:26.682]  They can't mess with that.
[01:57:26.682 --> 01:57:32.647]  And the same force that put the Milky Way and the Big Dipper and the universe together, put us together.
[01:57:32.647 --> 01:57:38.551]  And when you tune into that type of power, the rest of the public just chomps up.
[01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:41.554]  And so that's why somebody asked me today on the radio show,
[01:57:42.409 --> 01:57:43.970]  You've been fasting for 40 years.
[01:57:43.970 --> 01:57:45.010]  Where's your doctor?
[01:57:45.010 --> 01:57:46.871]  My doctor's been dead 30 years.
[01:57:46.871 --> 01:57:48.112]  It's scary.
[01:57:48.112 --> 01:57:52.174]  And so again, again, that's one person.
[01:57:52.174 --> 01:57:54.115]  And let me tell you something.
[01:57:54.115 --> 01:57:54.635]  Really don't.
[01:57:54.635 --> 01:57:57.516]  When's the last time the New York Times did a front page story on you?
[01:57:57.516 --> 01:58:00.158]  No, they've never done it.
[01:58:00.158 --> 01:58:03.939]  When's the last time you had the cover of Parade Magazine?
[01:58:03.939 --> 01:58:04.920]  Never.
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:05.580]  All right.
[01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:07.641]  I'll say this.
[01:58:07.641 --> 01:58:11.023]  When the universe takes you, it leaves no footprint.
[01:58:12.037 --> 01:58:18.082]  It tells you, you don't have to be validated by the Washington Post or the New York Times or NBC.
[01:58:18.082 --> 01:58:20.684]  I've got your back, brother.
[01:58:20.684 --> 01:58:23.927]  I have validated you and that's all that counts.
[01:58:23.927 --> 01:58:26.609]  And let me tell you the effect that we have.
[01:58:26.609 --> 01:58:30.672]  See, we look at things and sometimes we don't know what it means.
[01:58:30.672 --> 01:58:32.434]  Look, this is so deep, sir.
[01:58:32.434 --> 01:58:33.174]  Stay there.
[01:58:33.174 --> 01:58:35.716]  One minute break, coming right back with Dick Gregory.

[02:00:17.598 --> 02:00:21.662]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.219 --> 02:00:31.404]  Dick Gregory talking about looking at the evidence, the facts, but also going with your soul, your spirit, your heart, your gut.
[02:00:31.404 --> 02:00:32.725]  And I've always liked Dick Gregory.
[02:00:32.725 --> 02:00:35.728]  I can tell, you just look in his eyes, hear what he says, he's real.
[02:00:35.728 --> 02:00:36.488]  He's veritas.
[02:00:36.488 --> 02:00:42.754]  Doesn't mean any of us are perfect, but like King David, we have a heart that's real, that loves good.
[02:00:42.754 --> 02:00:48.418]  And he was basically getting into what Martin Luther King said about the universe bends towards justice.
[02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:49.820]  Yeah.
[02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:53.661]  The first, the general that ran the North Vietnamese Army, named General Giap,
[02:01:10.086 --> 02:01:15.967]  And he wrote a book 35 years before we went into that country, and he said something simple.
[02:01:15.967 --> 02:01:21.688]  Give me an army that's willing to die, and I will destroy any army that's willing to kill.
[02:01:21.688 --> 02:01:24.469]  And so I say this to you, my brother.
[02:01:24.469 --> 02:01:27.369]  Give me the researchers that's willing to die, not kill.
[02:01:27.369 --> 02:01:30.230]  And we will destroy any army.
[02:01:30.230 --> 02:01:33.111]  I had a guy ask me, why don't you have bodyguards?
[02:01:33.111 --> 02:01:34.791]  And I said, okay, let's say you're my bodyguards.
[02:01:35.439 --> 02:01:37.140]  How many bullets you got in that gun?
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:37.861]  You said nine.
[02:01:37.861 --> 02:01:41.123]  I said if somebody wanted to kill me I could only do a show up with ten people.
[02:01:41.123 --> 02:01:44.105]  I mean, the mathematics is not right.
[02:01:44.105 --> 02:01:51.069]  And so what I said earlier, I asked you, and I'll ask you again, have you ever been on the cover of Time Magazine?
[02:01:51.069 --> 02:01:52.090]  No.
[02:01:52.090 --> 02:01:56.373]  Have you ever been on the front page of the New York Times?
[02:01:56.373 --> 02:01:57.214]  No.
[02:01:57.214 --> 02:02:00.496]  Okay, the universe says when I pick you,
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:02.941]  I'm the universe.
[02:02:02.941 --> 02:02:09.925]  I'm the same one that put the whole... When I picked you to do my work, I leave no footprint.
[02:02:09.925 --> 02:02:15.928]  You don't have to be validated by the New York Times or the Washington Post or NBC.
[02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:18.569]  When the universe picked you, that's the ultimate.
[02:02:18.569 --> 02:02:21.551]  And when you look at... Let me just... Are we too close to this?
[02:02:21.551 --> 02:02:23.712]  Have you ever bit your tongue, Alex?
[02:02:23.712 --> 02:02:25.173]  Have I ever what?
[02:02:25.697 --> 02:02:26.978]  You ever bit your tongue?
[02:02:26.978 --> 02:02:27.739]  Yes.
[02:02:27.739 --> 02:02:29.121]  You know how bad that hurt, right?
[02:02:29.121 --> 02:02:30.142]  Yes.
[02:02:30.142 --> 02:02:40.132]  Do you realize these young white children is sticking their tongue out, running five and six grooves through their tongue, and they're not using pain killer?
[02:02:40.132 --> 02:02:43.135]  And we so busy laughing at them and thinking they're crazy.
[02:02:43.135 --> 02:02:45.437]  There's a universal law.
[02:02:45.437 --> 02:02:48.861]  When you start inflicting pain on yourself, huh?
[02:02:49.707 --> 02:02:52.569]  Then you better watch out cause something's fixing to happen.
[02:02:52.569 --> 02:03:00.093]  And if you do the quick research, those of you that's listening, then find out why the Chinese hate the Japanese so bad.
[02:03:00.093 --> 02:03:07.097]  Because when the Japanese invaded China in 1933, they gave the army instructions.
[02:03:07.097 --> 02:03:08.778]  Don't mess with the leaders.
[02:03:08.778 --> 02:03:14.521]  Find every young Chinese male with a tattoo on their body and blow their brains out.
[02:03:14.521 --> 02:03:17.463]  Cause tattoos represent revolution.
[02:03:17.463 --> 02:03:17.743]  Okay?
[02:03:18.384 --> 02:03:25.838]  And so what I'm saying to you, when I was a little boy, if I saw somebody with a tattoo, you knew he was in the presence of a felon.
[02:03:25.838 --> 02:03:26.539]  Okay?
[02:03:26.539 --> 02:03:29.184]  Now, and finally, then we get back to your question you asked.
[02:03:30.896 --> 02:03:43.022]  A butterfly, that little precious, beautiful butterfly, can fly all the way across the Atlantic Ocean, can fly all the way across the Pacific Ocean, but the bald eagle can't make that trip.
[02:03:43.022 --> 02:03:53.506]  So don't let nobody lead you to believe, because I got a mighty army and the CIA, and I control everything, that they're bigger than you.
[02:03:53.506 --> 02:03:55.307]  That is a game they play.
[02:03:55.307 --> 02:03:56.728]  You take a welfare mother,
[02:03:57.388 --> 02:03:58.750]  That's pregnant.
[02:03:58.750 --> 02:04:00.513]  She can't read or write.
[02:04:00.513 --> 02:04:02.857]  109 months pregnant is over.
[02:04:02.857 --> 02:04:07.644]  They don't have all the armies in the world that can come together and keep that baby in her.
[02:04:08.499 --> 02:04:12.761]  You see, revolution is nothing but an extension of evolution.
[02:04:12.761 --> 02:04:19.324]  Evolution is a gradual, naturistic change that when it leads into revolution, that's quick change.
[02:04:19.324 --> 02:04:22.985]  And that happens when a mother gives birth, when an animal gives birth.
[02:04:22.985 --> 02:04:34.350]  And what you're doing, and people like you that have radio shows like this here, you're giving the folks that are sitting there waiting on that gestation, that nine-month period, you're giving them courage.
[02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:36.131]  You're giving them something that they can look at.
[02:04:36.471 --> 02:04:41.233]  People can turn in and listen to this show, and then go back and explain it to people.
[02:04:41.233 --> 02:04:48.817]  The hardest thing in the world is when the CIA and these thugs have control, and there's no other voice they can hear.
[02:04:48.817 --> 02:04:50.778]  Damn right they start making sense.
[02:04:50.778 --> 02:04:51.218]  They make sense.
[02:04:51.218 --> 02:04:53.179]  Well, that's why they want to start shutting the web down.
[02:04:53.179 --> 02:04:54.840]  Dick Gregory's our guest.
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:56.200]  More key info straight ahead.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:58.662]  We'll also talk about eugenics with him on the other side.
[02:04:58.662 --> 02:04:59.102]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.350 --> 02:05:04.913]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:04.913 --> 02:05:05.814]  Number 1.
[02:05:05.814 --> 02:05:09.237]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.237 --> 02:05:10.117]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.117 --> 02:05:15.001]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.001 --> 02:05:15.741]  It's true.
[02:05:15.741 --> 02:05:20.625]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.625 --> 02:05:21.446]  Number 3.
[02:05:21.446 --> 02:05:25.028]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.028 --> 02:05:28.731]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:28.931 --> 02:05:29.732]  Number 4.
[02:05:29.732 --> 02:05:32.494]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.494 --> 02:05:36.178]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.178 --> 02:05:36.959]  Number 5.
[02:05:36.959 --> 02:05:41.102]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.102 --> 02:05:45.867]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:06:10.723 --> 02:06:18.106]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:06:18.106 --> 02:06:22.647]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:06:35.908 --> 02:06:42.674]  As powder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:06:42.674 --> 02:06:46.558]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[02:08:08.357 --> 02:08:12.841]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:08:12.841 --> 02:08:17.946]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.946 --> 02:08:26.954]  I know I keep ranting about this, but the government did a secret deal with major insurance companies to steal the death benefits from the widows of dead veterans.
[02:08:26.954 --> 02:08:27.635]  That's Bloomberg.
[02:08:29.523 --> 02:08:29.984]  I don't know.
[02:08:48.439 --> 02:09:06.943]  Dick, expanding on this overall issue, and I talk about this almost every day, I'm not bringing this up because you're a black man, but I've studied the globalists and they admit they beta test things on disenfranchised people that can't fight back, and I go back to the eugenics development in the U.S.
[02:09:06.943 --> 02:09:09.604]  about 90 years ago and they said we're going to test it out on these people.
[02:09:09.604 --> 02:09:10.464]  Wait, hold it, hold it.
[02:09:10.464 --> 02:09:11.844]  How many years ago?
[02:09:11.844 --> 02:09:13.184]  About 90 years ago.
[02:09:13.184 --> 02:09:15.985]  Okay, you know why I'm glad you said that?
[02:09:15.985 --> 02:09:16.145]  Why?
[02:09:17.648 --> 02:09:19.410]  What Hitler was doing was eugenics.
[02:09:19.410 --> 02:09:23.474]  Eugenics was created at the University of Virginia.
[02:09:23.474 --> 02:09:25.536]  Hitler was using our book.
[02:09:25.536 --> 02:09:26.397]  Yes!
[02:09:26.397 --> 02:09:31.862]  That was his blueprint for what he was doing, come out the University of Virginia.
[02:09:31.862 --> 02:09:32.723]  Eugenics.
[02:09:32.723 --> 02:09:36.386]  And they had it all put together and said, here's how we're going to do it.
[02:09:36.386 --> 02:09:39.870]  Now, if you Google Ebony Magazine,
[02:09:40.570 --> 02:09:44.651]  Where Dick Gregory said, you know, birth control is genocide.
[02:09:44.651 --> 02:09:46.852]  Okay, now, I didn't just get on this bandwagon.
[02:09:46.852 --> 02:09:48.412]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:09:48.412 --> 02:09:58.834]  See, I'm not like the King girl, who a bunch of conservatives went over and they needed a black boy to sit here and they say, here's how we're going to finance this.
[02:09:58.834 --> 02:10:02.795]  Let me tell you, I'm a black man with ten children.
[02:10:02.795 --> 02:10:09.717]  I've been knowing for years, for every ten white babies that's born, three of them die at birth.
[02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:16.311]  For every 10 black babies that's born, I'm going back now 50 years ago.
[02:10:16.311 --> 02:10:22.053]  For every 10 white babies that was born 50 years ago, 3 of them died at birth.
[02:10:22.053 --> 02:10:27.475]  For every 10 black babies that's born in America, 7 died at birth.
[02:10:27.475 --> 02:10:36.958]  So it didn't take too much mathematics to figure out if this system can get me on the same birth schedule as a white woman, they're wiping me out.
[02:10:37.961 --> 02:10:38.861]  Okay.
[02:10:38.861 --> 02:10:42.122]  And that's when I said, this is genocide.
[02:10:42.122 --> 02:10:42.762]  They know it.
[02:10:42.762 --> 02:10:44.123]  My grandmother didn't know it.
[02:10:44.123 --> 02:10:46.063]  A whole lot of people want to have sex.
[02:10:46.063 --> 02:10:47.784]  Don't want to get people pregnant.
[02:10:47.784 --> 02:10:51.205]  Now, let me just tell you how, how corrupt I am.
[02:10:51.205 --> 02:10:55.106]  I had somebody call me one day from Canada.
[02:10:55.826 --> 02:11:05.392]  And they said, we'd like to bring you here $20,000 for the Father of the Year Award.
[02:11:05.392 --> 02:11:07.293]  I said, well, I don't qualify.
[02:11:07.293 --> 02:11:09.675]  The guy explained to me it wasn't a joke.
[02:11:09.675 --> 02:11:10.936]  I said, no, no, I don't qualify.
[02:11:10.936 --> 02:11:14.098]  They said, listen to me, listen to me good.
[02:11:14.098 --> 02:11:18.901]  I have 10 black children, which means the universal God
[02:11:19.739 --> 02:11:19.879]  I'm
[02:11:40.862 --> 02:11:45.506]  I never had an affair with my wife to create new life, man.
[02:11:45.506 --> 02:11:47.087]  I was just enjoying myself.
[02:11:47.087 --> 02:11:48.648]  Now what's wrong with that?
[02:11:48.648 --> 02:11:59.056]  I never bought a car that I didn't know the year, the make, the down payment, the monthly notes, the insurance, and the trade-in value.
[02:11:59.056 --> 02:12:03.019]  Now when I, Dick Gregory, got to look myself in the face,
[02:12:04.762 --> 02:12:11.986]  And realize I put more planning into owning a damn car than creating God's new life.
[02:12:11.986 --> 02:12:13.427]  Hey man, I'm the problem.
[02:12:13.427 --> 02:12:15.008]  Don't look past me.
[02:12:15.008 --> 02:12:21.672]  Every time I get on a plane and travel anywhere in the world for a peace rally, I pay tax money on my ticket.
[02:12:21.992 --> 02:12:27.875]  Which they use to buy bombs and munitions to kill children and old folks all over the world.
[02:12:27.875 --> 02:12:36.039]  So when the bombs drop on my grandchildren, I say, God, just give me the wisdom and the strength to understand it's payback time.
[02:12:36.039 --> 02:12:37.499]  This is what this is about.
[02:12:37.499 --> 02:12:43.602]  But I'm just glad that on this... See, I grew up, man, and I was born in 1952.
[02:12:43.602 --> 02:12:47.864]  I'll be 60, I mean 32, when I go to the movies and see John Wayne, man.
[02:12:47.864 --> 02:12:49.305]  That's who I wanted to be like.
[02:12:49.745 --> 02:12:53.747]  When John Wayne said, if you write and they wrong, get your gun and kill them.
[02:12:53.747 --> 02:12:59.410]  It's until I bumped into this movement that told me it's not about killing.
[02:12:59.410 --> 02:13:00.471]  It's not about this.
[02:13:00.471 --> 02:13:03.733]  Man, I couldn't wait to get in the army so I could kill me somebody.
[02:13:03.733 --> 02:13:05.994]  And let me just tell you something right now.
[02:13:05.994 --> 02:13:08.735]  If they, what you talking about the veterans, how they treat them?
[02:13:08.735 --> 02:13:10.156]  Let me tell you Americans something.
[02:13:11.104 --> 02:13:21.827]  Anytime you can wave your flag to get your young men and women to the front line of battle, but can't wave that flag when they come back to see that they get the care.
[02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:23.568]  That's not a flag you're waving.
[02:13:23.568 --> 02:13:24.648]  That's a rag.
[02:13:24.648 --> 02:13:28.829]  And the sooner you find out about it, the better off everybody's gonna be.
[02:13:28.829 --> 02:13:36.531]  I'm so damn sick and tired of the people that manufacture the munitions and all the ones that make the money on war who don't spend none of their loved ones.
[02:13:36.531 --> 02:13:38.052]  They're the ones that profit.
[02:13:38.052 --> 02:13:38.412]  One day,
[02:13:39.304 --> 02:13:57.095]  When the decent people move into a position, we'll say this, anybody that make more war materials, you can't make no more money than 10% more during wartime than you make during peacetime, and the profits will go to the people who fight the war.
[02:13:57.095 --> 02:14:05.580]  The profits, when you got a Super Bowl, the winner shares in the benefits, and that's what we need to do with wartime.
[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:06.281]  So somewhere,
[02:14:06.962 --> 02:14:12.772]  When you stop and think about, you know, America will be a great nation one day, but it hasn't been.
[02:14:12.772 --> 02:14:19.345]  And the reason Negroes were not able to play professional baseball for years is because of this.
[02:14:20.197 --> 02:14:27.084]  When the people start coming from Europe to here, the Irish Catholic had to live in an Irish Catholic neighborhood.
[02:14:27.084 --> 02:14:30.066]  You know, we talk about the religion, how crazy it is.
[02:14:30.066 --> 02:14:35.111]  Now, I remember the time in Boston, you wouldn't dare say you was Irish Catholic in a certain area.
[02:14:35.111 --> 02:14:36.412]  You would be stumped.
[02:14:36.412 --> 02:14:40.917]  When the Jews came over, and you see, we forget the Mormons because they rich.
[02:14:41.357 --> 02:14:43.558]  We forget what happened to Smith and them.
[02:14:43.558 --> 02:14:46.639]  The Mormons wasn't created in Utah.
[02:14:46.639 --> 02:14:48.319]  It was in Illinois.
[02:14:48.319 --> 02:14:50.880]  And the Christians ran them out, killing them.
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:56.282]  And the reason they're alive today, they ran into Utah and the Christians say, I'm a Christian.
[02:14:56.282 --> 02:14:57.122]  They don't leave them alone.
[02:14:57.122 --> 02:14:57.682]  Ain't nothing there.
[02:14:57.682 --> 02:15:00.003]  They didn't know nothing about minerals and research.
[02:15:00.003 --> 02:15:03.724]  And so we, when we stop and think about how vicious we have been,
[02:15:14.512 --> 02:15:30.763]  Mr. Gregory, we're almost out of time, but specifically though, on the issue of eugenics, you're absolutely right that more than half the black people since Roe v. Wade that are conceived are never born, but we don't see anybody, Jesse Jackson,
[02:15:31.821 --> 02:15:34.307]  Or any of these people ever talking about it.
[02:15:34.307 --> 02:15:36.472]  I don't hear the NAACP talking about it.
[02:15:36.472 --> 02:15:38.136]  You know, if the cops kill a black youth...
[02:15:39.065 --> 02:15:43.846]  Sometimes because they had to, sometimes because the police are out of control.
[02:15:43.846 --> 02:15:55.649]  There's a huge big event about it, but then if I was a black leader, I mean, I'm just a human, so I'm warning black folks about this, but I'm warning everybody because it's happening to everyone, but it's specifically targeting blacks.
[02:15:55.649 --> 02:15:58.269]  I mean, why don't I see more black leaders talking about that?
[02:15:58.269 --> 02:16:00.290]  Wait a minute, wait, let me back up a minute.
[02:16:00.290 --> 02:16:02.910]  When you see Alveda King, right?
[02:16:02.910 --> 02:16:03.670]  Yes.
[02:16:03.670 --> 02:16:04.511]  All right.
[02:16:04.511 --> 02:16:06.131]  Have you ever read about her in the New York Times?
[02:16:08.502 --> 02:16:13.220]  Um, I don't read the New York Times a lot, but... Well, have you ever seen on NBC?
[02:16:15.043 --> 02:16:18.704]  I'm saying that there's a whole lot of black folks out there doing stuff.
[02:16:18.704 --> 02:16:22.926]  If it don't run in the paper that white folks read, it's like it don't happen.
[02:16:22.926 --> 02:16:23.906]  I got you.
[02:16:23.906 --> 02:16:27.067]  So you're saying the leaders we're shown are the ones that are bought off.
[02:16:27.067 --> 02:16:28.647]  We're not seeing all the real folks.
[02:16:28.647 --> 02:16:29.348]  Wait a minute.
[02:16:29.348 --> 02:16:31.348]  All black leaders is not bought off.
[02:16:31.348 --> 02:16:36.470]  A lot of people out here is doing the right thing for the wrong reason.
[02:16:36.470 --> 02:16:40.972]  And so as long as you're doing that, and finally, before we go off, let me just say this.
[02:16:40.972 --> 02:16:42.252]  If you look at a little fleet,
[02:16:43.082 --> 02:16:46.038]  A little flea can jump 24 inches.
[02:16:46.038 --> 02:16:46.822]  That's in their DNA.
[02:16:47.904 --> 02:16:54.205]  But they've done experiments where they take a flea and put it in an 18-inch jar with a top on it.
[02:16:54.205 --> 02:16:59.086]  And when that flea jumps up and the head hits the top, that flea is not aware it's in a jar.
[02:16:59.086 --> 02:17:08.468]  And after that head hits for so many times, you can take the lid off the jar and the flea won't jump beyond 18 inches, okay?
[02:17:08.468 --> 02:17:12.069]  And that flea trains its offsprings the same thing.
[02:17:12.069 --> 02:17:16.790]  So how long can we be put in a trick like we've been put in since slavery?
[02:17:17.631 --> 02:17:18.232]  No, I got it.
[02:17:18.232 --> 02:17:19.755]  I mean, I'm not saying all black leaders.
[02:17:19.755 --> 02:17:23.221]  I'm talking about the really predominant ones they put out there.
[02:17:23.221 --> 02:17:27.349]  You're saying they've been put in a jar so that's the only universe they know they're inside a box.
[02:17:27.961 --> 02:17:28.901]  That's all of it.
[02:17:28.901 --> 02:17:31.422]  Some of them know the trick that's going down.
[02:17:31.422 --> 02:17:34.164]  Some of them don't know the trick that's going down.
[02:17:34.164 --> 02:17:41.026]  But I'm saying, what's happening today, you see, I survive on this country because I bypass all of that.
[02:17:41.026 --> 02:17:42.187]  I bypass that.
[02:17:42.187 --> 02:17:42.807]  I bypass something.
[02:17:42.807 --> 02:17:46.729]  I said, well, you know, Jesse Jackson had something to do with killing King.
[02:17:46.729 --> 02:17:47.469]  Doesn't that bother you?
[02:17:47.469 --> 02:17:49.290]  I said, it don't seem to bother the King family.
[02:17:49.850 --> 02:17:52.052]  I mean, they get along with it.
[02:17:52.052 --> 02:17:56.216]  They can get along with it, but eventually all of it is going to come out.
[02:17:56.216 --> 02:18:03.443]  All of it is going to be this, you know, when you look at, when you look at Jesse, Jesse had one of the brilliant minds on the planet.
[02:18:03.443 --> 02:18:04.183]  Okay?
[02:18:04.183 --> 02:18:09.048]  One of the big horrors to me since the Obama one, it messed up the myth in my head.
[02:18:09.048 --> 02:18:10.149]  See, I have been convinced
[02:18:10.829 --> 02:18:16.932]  In closing, clearly Obama was financed by the same folks and it's just being used as a way to divide people.
[02:18:16.932 --> 02:18:18.653]  They claimed it would bring unity.
[02:18:18.653 --> 02:18:20.193]  What's your brief take on Obama?
[02:18:35.333 --> 02:18:36.775]  Well, let me put it this way.
[02:18:36.775 --> 02:18:41.601]  Right before Rome fell, they had a black emperor from Africa.
[02:18:41.601 --> 02:18:44.726]  You know, when you look at the odds... Yeah, they had Africanus!
[02:18:44.726 --> 02:18:45.667]  That's right.
[02:18:45.667 --> 02:18:49.752]  What is the odds that the first black president
[02:18:50.393 --> 02:18:52.735]  of the United States wouldn't have no slave king.
[02:18:52.735 --> 02:18:55.397]  His mama wasn't a slave, his daddy wasn't no slave.
[02:18:55.397 --> 02:19:04.885]  Okay, but one of the things I'm looking at, there's a whole lot of white folk that's going crazy in America because there's a black man in the White House.
[02:19:04.885 --> 02:19:09.469]  Now, they won't say poor white folk, but I looked at, I was invited to the operation.
[02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:14.493]  I didn't go, teacher of service called me and said, Mr. Gregory, you're on the VIP list.
[02:19:14.933 --> 02:19:16.597]  For the Obama Inauguration.
[02:19:16.597 --> 02:19:18.261]  By what time can we pick you up?
[02:19:18.261 --> 02:19:22.851]  I said, oh y'all, the same Secret Service that was in Dallas when Kennedy, when he got shot.
[02:19:22.851 --> 02:19:24.434]  I ain't heard no more from them.
[02:19:25.325 --> 02:19:27.187]  Not at all.
[02:19:27.187 --> 02:19:29.628]  And so when you stop and think about it...
[02:19:48.163 --> 02:19:53.511]  Support our sponsors and buy the books, the DVDs, the t-shirts, the materials at InfoWars.com.
[02:19:53.511 --> 02:19:55.013]  Dick Gregory's our amazing guest.
[02:19:55.013 --> 02:19:57.496]  Let him finish up on President Obama on the other side.
[02:19:57.496 --> 02:19:57.937]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:04.921]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:20:04.921 --> 02:20:07.222]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:20:07.222 --> 02:20:08.082]  Don't!
[02:20:08.082 --> 02:20:11.524]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:20:11.524 --> 02:20:18.646]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:20:18.626 --> 02:20:20.607]  's number one debt secret.
[02:20:20.607 --> 02:20:24.268]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:20:24.668 --> 02:20:27.811]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:20:27.811 --> 02:20:35.198]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:20:35.198 --> 02:20:36.379]  Herb K was right.
[02:20:36.379 --> 02:20:39.422]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:20:39.582 --> 02:20:40.843]  What do you have to lose?
[02:20:40.843 --> 02:20:42.064]  Stop the calls now.
[02:20:42.064 --> 02:20:44.026]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[02:20:44.026 --> 02:20:47.328]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[02:20:47.328 --> 02:20:47.668]  Call 800-405-7850.
[02:20:47.668 --> 02:20:48.269]  That's 800-405-7850.
[02:20:48.269 --> 02:20:48.309]  800-405-7850.
[02:21:01.036 --> 02:21:03.417]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:03.417 --> 02:21:05.738]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:05.738 --> 02:21:08.939]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:08.939 --> 02:21:14.061]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:14.061 --> 02:21:18.242]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.562 --> 02:21:20.925]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:20.925 --> 02:21:23.468]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.468 --> 02:21:26.712]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.712 --> 02:21:34.322]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.645 --> 02:21:40.047]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:40.047 --> 02:21:42.888]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.888 --> 02:21:46.570]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.570 --> 02:21:47.650]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.650 --> 02:21:48.991]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:48.991 --> 02:21:50.491]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:00.228 --> 02:22:06.910]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:06.910 --> 02:22:15.032]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:15.032 --> 02:22:22.854]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:23.194 --> 02:22:28.279]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:28.279 --> 02:22:33.504]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:33.504 --> 02:22:37.849]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:37.849 --> 02:22:38.950]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:42.974]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:43.434 --> 02:22:48.341]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:48.341 --> 02:22:51.345]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:51.345 --> 02:22:53.107]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.107 --> 02:22:53.347]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.515 --> 02:23:01.757]  Do you know someone who's a Constitution basher?
[02:23:01.757 --> 02:23:05.180]  Then here's the ammo you need to silence them once and for all.
[02:23:05.180 --> 02:23:07.081]  Introducing the crash course on the U.S.
[02:23:07.081 --> 02:23:12.166]  Constitution, how to argue with a liberal about constitutional issues and win every time.
[02:23:12.166 --> 02:23:20.673]  If you believe it's time we stop disgusting left-wing lies and start telling the truth about America's Christian heritage, this crash course for patriots is for you.
[02:23:20.673 --> 02:23:23.535]  Start neutralizing the liberal propaganda being forced
[02:23:23.575 --> 02:23:24.275]  We're good to go.
[02:24:06.162 --> 02:24:09.445]  Well, civil rights icon Dick Gregory is our guest.
[02:24:09.445 --> 02:24:12.487]  He's dropped bombshell after bombshell on us today.
[02:24:12.487 --> 02:24:16.551]  He says he's going to do a two-year fast, basically.
[02:24:16.551 --> 02:24:18.192]  And he's famous for fasts.
[02:24:18.192 --> 02:24:19.593]  We didn't take any solid foods.
[02:24:19.593 --> 02:24:21.134]  I guess that's why he's so healthy at 78.
[02:24:22.515 --> 02:24:23.756]  And I look forward to having him back up.
[02:24:23.756 --> 02:24:29.218]  He was bringing up some even bigger bombshells during the break, but he said, no, I'll talk about that on the next show.
[02:24:29.218 --> 02:24:34.140]  And it dealt with Obama, but we were getting into Obama and you wouldn't go to his inauguration.
[02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:37.542]  I guess they wanted to use you to put you up there, somebody who's real.
[02:24:37.542 --> 02:24:44.265]  But I mean, I knew with his advisors and the same people financing him that were financing McCain, I knew where this was going.
[02:24:44.265 --> 02:24:46.366]  Same thing with Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin.
[02:24:46.966 --> 02:24:53.730]  And the liberals want to be conned by Obama, the Republicans want to be conned by Glenn Beck, but more and more people are not getting conned.
[02:24:53.730 --> 02:24:55.351]  Dick Gregory.
[02:24:55.351 --> 02:24:56.912]  Well, let me just say this here.
[02:24:56.912 --> 02:25:00.595]  When you stop and think about it, look at this.
[02:25:00.595 --> 02:25:03.977]  Do you know what a Confederate flag looks like?
[02:25:03.977 --> 02:25:05.558]  Sure.
[02:25:05.558 --> 02:25:06.679]  And the Union won the war.
[02:25:06.679 --> 02:25:09.841]  When's the last time you've seen a Union flag?
[02:25:09.841 --> 02:25:11.041]  Think about that.
[02:25:11.041 --> 02:25:11.862]  That's very serious.
[02:25:13.411 --> 02:25:19.855]  This is the first time a war was fight at 99% of people don't know what the flag looks like that the winners had.
[02:25:19.855 --> 02:25:22.898]  They've been playing this game for a long, long time.
[02:25:22.898 --> 02:25:26.160]  And no, 13 is an unlucky number in America.
[02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:29.042]  No place else in the world is 13 an unlucky number.
[02:25:29.042 --> 02:25:29.602]  You know what I mean?
[02:25:29.602 --> 02:25:32.084]  Black folk believe 13 is an unlucky number.
[02:25:32.084 --> 02:25:34.125]  Why is 13 an unlucky number in America?
[02:25:34.125 --> 02:25:37.587]  Because it was the 13th Amendment that freed me.
[02:25:37.587 --> 02:25:39.088]  This is how this works, man.
[02:25:39.088 --> 02:25:42.971]  They've been playing games for so long until you can see it.
[02:25:43.451 --> 02:25:44.772]  And feel it.
[02:25:44.772 --> 02:25:50.774]  I can't tell you enough what you mean to, you know, you are the voice of America.
[02:25:50.774 --> 02:25:52.215]  People like you are the voice.
[02:25:52.215 --> 02:25:56.557]  And as long as you don't worry about what other people think about.
[02:25:56.557 --> 02:25:58.498]  Because I went to a conference one day.
[02:25:58.498 --> 02:26:02.179]  Some of the richest people in the world was there.
[02:26:02.179 --> 02:26:03.960]  Some of the most brilliant people.
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:06.041]  And I asked one question.
[02:26:06.041 --> 02:26:08.142]  Y'all are here from all over the world.
[02:26:08.937 --> 02:26:11.018]  Y'all got all the money you would ever want.
[02:26:11.018 --> 02:26:12.820]  Here's what I'm gonna ask you to do.
[02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:14.261]  Make me a scab.
[02:26:14.261 --> 02:26:14.841]  Huh?
[02:26:14.841 --> 02:26:23.407]  When I cut my hand with a scab, you can make a nuclear bomb, you can travel from one planet to another, but you can't make a scab.
[02:26:23.407 --> 02:26:27.029]  Only the universal God can make a scab.
[02:26:27.029 --> 02:26:33.093]  And anybody who gets hurt or injured, it don't say that you go to Harvard, Yale, or Morehouse.
[02:26:33.093 --> 02:26:35.075]  It don't say how much money you got in the bank.
[02:26:35.075 --> 02:26:36.616]  You got a scab coming.
[02:26:36.616 --> 02:26:38.657]  And once you reduce these thugs,
[02:26:38.817 --> 02:26:39.257]  I don't
[02:27:09.057 --> 02:27:11.058]  No, they control the full spectrum.
[02:27:11.058 --> 02:27:11.779]  That's right.
[02:27:11.779 --> 02:27:15.461]  And once people realize white ain't a color, it's an attitude.
[02:27:15.461 --> 02:27:20.403]  And if you ain't got some treatment, you can't have the attitude.
[02:27:20.403 --> 02:27:25.346]  And so Hitler didn't declare war on Africa, World War I, but war on Africa.
[02:27:25.726 --> 02:27:27.607]  It was, it was jumped on white folk.
[02:27:27.607 --> 02:27:30.067]  They didn't make a nuclear bomb to drop on Africa.
[02:27:30.067 --> 02:27:36.209]  And when people started realizing that and started understanding that... No, exactly.
[02:27:36.209 --> 02:27:48.073]  You've got the tiny ultra-elite waging war against everybody else, but they play the subgroups off against each other because the controllers are so small, they're weak unless they can play us off against each other.
[02:27:48.633 --> 02:27:53.877]  That's right, and that's why they can never admit if they found somebody from another planet.
[02:27:53.877 --> 02:27:54.778]  They couldn't admit it.
[02:27:54.778 --> 02:27:55.038]  Why?
[02:27:55.038 --> 02:28:05.406]  If we admitted there was somebody else, white supremacy go out the window, organized religion go out the window, and the third one, which is worse than all, we become Earthlings.
[02:28:05.406 --> 02:28:09.749]  There wouldn't be a Chicago, or Texas, or Ohio, or Germany.
[02:28:09.749 --> 02:28:11.010]  We would be Earth people.
[02:28:11.010 --> 02:28:13.852]  Where do you see, in closing, Obama's destiny ending?
[02:28:18.195 --> 02:28:20.436]  I'm worried about Obama being the false flag.
[02:28:20.436 --> 02:28:26.140]  I'm wondering, I'm thinking they're going to use some nut to kill him as a way to really divide people.
[02:28:26.140 --> 02:28:27.961]  No, no, no, no, trust me.
[02:28:27.961 --> 02:28:33.324]  They were, look, when you groom someone, you don't take it out.
[02:28:33.324 --> 02:28:37.347]  And let me tell you, whoever killed the President of the United States will not be a nut.
[02:28:37.947 --> 02:28:38.747]  Please believe me.
[02:28:38.747 --> 02:28:41.268]  No, no, I agree, but I'm saying they would claim that.
[02:28:41.268 --> 02:28:42.629]  No, I mean, I see the point you're making.
[02:28:42.629 --> 02:28:46.811]  So Kennedy was rogue, MLK was rogue.
[02:28:46.811 --> 02:28:48.651]  I mean, they go after who they don't control.
[02:28:48.651 --> 02:29:04.898]  Yeah, and if you look at this guy who had your name, Jones, down in Florida, if we really stupid enough believe that this little upstart punk that got a church with 30 people, names can become a household word in 24 hours and the government's not behind that, then we're all stupid.
[02:29:05.538 --> 02:29:11.980]  Well, it's now come out, confirmed that the Ground Zero Mosque is CIA funded to get everybody fighting with each other.
[02:29:11.980 --> 02:29:13.061]  Oh, that makes sense.
[02:29:13.061 --> 02:29:17.803]  But why do we expect good things out of evil?
[02:29:17.803 --> 02:29:20.044]  Here's the problem I have.
[02:29:20.044 --> 02:29:23.405]  In America, the church in the state,
[02:29:24.249 --> 02:29:26.130]  Dick Gregory dot com.
[02:29:26.130 --> 02:29:27.971]  We're out of time.
[02:29:27.971 --> 02:29:30.772]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[02:29:30.772 --> 02:29:31.412]  Amazing interview.

[02:31:58.130 --> 02:31:58.990]  Others don't.
[02:32:00.148 --> 02:32:04.691]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.691 --> 02:32:05.612]  Number 1.
[02:32:05.612 --> 02:32:09.035]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.035 --> 02:32:09.895]  Number 2.
[02:32:09.895 --> 02:32:14.779]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:14.779 --> 02:32:15.519]  It's true.
[02:32:15.519 --> 02:32:20.403]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.403 --> 02:32:21.224]  Number 3.
[02:32:21.224 --> 02:32:24.806]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:24.806 --> 02:32:28.509]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.709 --> 02:32:29.510]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:32.272]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.272 --> 02:32:35.956]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:35.956 --> 02:32:36.737]  Number 5.
[02:32:36.737 --> 02:32:40.880]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:45.645]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:45.925 --> 02:32:50.109]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.109 --> 02:32:51.890]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:51.890 --> 02:32:54.152]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:54.152 --> 02:33:01.599]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:01.599 --> 02:33:07.624]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:07.624 --> 02:33:10.166]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.744 --> 02:33:30.851]  Alright, I started the show talking about this, and I want to get into it more when we blitz through some news here in a few minutes.
[02:33:30.851 --> 02:33:49.244]  But this Bloomberg article, in their long-term research, and Prudential admits it, the big insurance companies, others are involved, that they had a secret deal with the government and the Department of Veterans to allow them to basically keep the money from six million soldiers and their different types of
[02:33:51.218 --> 02:33:53.359]  Injury benefits and death benefits.
[02:33:53.359 --> 02:33:56.360]  And it just shows, these people practice evil.
[02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:59.161]  And they train you to accept evil.
[02:33:59.161 --> 02:34:06.143]  That's why they're now in the news going, Ministry of Defense probes claim that soldiers are smuggling heroin from Afghanistan.
[02:34:06.143 --> 02:34:06.984]  What are you talking about?
[02:34:06.984 --> 02:34:10.925]  In fact, did you guys find that Fox News cast we played before?
[02:34:10.925 --> 02:34:18.328]  Where Geraldo's on there with the Marine Corps Colonel and they admit they're helping protect and grow the opium fields?
[02:34:18.328 --> 02:34:18.688]  Remember that?
[02:34:20.060 --> 02:34:20.840]  We're not going to play it yet.
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:24.742]  I'm going to play it right at the end of the hour.
[02:34:24.742 --> 02:34:26.043]  People don't believe this when I say it.
[02:34:26.043 --> 02:34:27.063]  I've got to play it.
[02:34:27.063 --> 02:34:32.025]  I can pull up AP Reuters and they're like, we have to help grow the opium or the Taliban won't be our friends.
[02:34:32.025 --> 02:34:34.286]  We're there to get the opium.
[02:34:34.286 --> 02:34:37.507]  When I say we're there, I've got to get my mind out of that cycle.
[02:34:37.507 --> 02:34:38.668]  This isn't my country.
[02:34:38.668 --> 02:34:39.668]  My country was stolen.
[02:34:39.668 --> 02:34:40.629]  I want my country back.
[02:34:41.229 --> 02:34:45.251]  We're run by big global corporations for their power and control.
[02:34:45.251 --> 02:35:02.359]  And they, if they'll kill a million plus Iraqis in the last seven and a half years of war, and over a million and a half from sanctions before that, that's two and a half million of a 24 million population, do you think they care about minimum wage workers cleaning stuff up with Corexit in the Gulf or at Exxon Valdez 20-something years ago?
[02:35:02.359 --> 02:35:07.161]  You think they care about firefighters and police and medical workers at the World Trade Center?
[02:35:07.161 --> 02:35:08.682]  You think they care about any of this?
[02:35:13.905 --> 02:35:20.011]  I mean, do you think that the system cares about you?
[02:35:20.011 --> 02:35:21.112]  And the answer is no.
[02:35:21.112 --> 02:35:25.836]  Not only do they not care, they enjoy hurting you.
[02:35:25.836 --> 02:35:29.079]  Of course they're poisoning the water and the vaccines.
[02:35:29.079 --> 02:35:30.401]  Of course they're doing all of this.
[02:35:30.401 --> 02:35:32.463]  And the sick part is we go along with it.
[02:35:32.463 --> 02:35:38.008]  We feel like we're part of the system and all our little petty positions of power and the compartmentalized pyramidal structure.
[02:35:39.249 --> 02:35:45.071]  It's time to realize that we are a drugged out, dumbed down, wicked society.
[02:35:45.071 --> 02:35:49.572]  And we've got to start recognizing evil from good and supporting good over evil.
[02:35:49.572 --> 02:36:02.836]  But that means you've got to find the real good, not the whole panoptagon, the whole panacea, the whole pantheon of counterfeits.
[02:36:02.836 --> 02:36:04.416]  I mean, this world is sophisticated.
[02:36:06.656 --> 02:36:09.638]  And I just learn more every month now that I learned in the previous year.
[02:36:09.638 --> 02:36:12.360]  It's just accelerating and I can't even articulate it all.
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:13.541]  It's just incredible.
[02:36:13.541 --> 02:36:15.923]  And I can't stand being prominent.
[02:36:15.923 --> 02:36:23.128]  I can't stand that I'm in the position with all this responsibility because even though I'm real and try to be good, I'm weak.
[02:36:23.128 --> 02:36:26.130]  I'm made up out of the flesh.
[02:36:26.130 --> 02:36:31.114]  But through all the persecution we've gone through, we don't talk about really much of it on the show.
[02:36:31.114 --> 02:36:32.255]  It just makes me a better person.
[02:36:41.906 --> 02:36:44.867]  Coming up, this story's up on the Drudge Report.
[02:36:44.867 --> 02:36:47.808]  Big shifts to get expanded role in policing the internet.
[02:36:47.808 --> 02:36:50.589]  They're going ahead with the cybersecurity takeover, key report.
[02:36:50.589 --> 02:36:53.070]  That's also at GCNLive.com.
[02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:57.951]  Another one, expanding U.S.-Canada security, economic partnership.
[02:36:57.951 --> 02:37:00.572]  They're going ahead with the North American Union integration.
[02:37:00.572 --> 02:37:03.313]  That's up at GCNLive.com.
[02:37:03.313 --> 02:37:10.936]  Soros front group exploits teenage celebrity to get out the vote for the War Party, the Obama Party, same as the Bush Party, same as the Globalist Party.
[02:37:11.889 --> 02:37:13.150]  That's at GCNLive.com.
[02:37:13.150 --> 02:37:16.992]  Another key report by Jerrion Messin.
[02:37:16.992 --> 02:37:18.033]  Does such a great job.
[02:37:18.033 --> 02:37:20.254]  The Biometric Utopians.
[02:37:20.254 --> 02:37:22.515]  The Biocratic Utopians, Part One.
[02:37:22.515 --> 02:37:24.417]  Prussian Eugenics.
[02:37:24.417 --> 02:37:26.618]  You gotta go read all this.
[02:37:26.618 --> 02:37:30.500]  Gold Silver Explode as Banksters Abandon Market Manipulation.
[02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:31.421]  It's just all insane.
[02:37:33.755 --> 02:37:36.176]  And I can just see the social engineering.
[02:37:36.176 --> 02:37:37.656]  I can see how destructive it is.
[02:37:37.656 --> 02:37:39.357]  I can see what it's designed for.
[02:37:39.357 --> 02:37:44.839]  And then I can read Globalist's own white papers that are public, and it confirms everything I already organically knew.
[02:37:44.839 --> 02:38:00.624]  I can watch Glenn Beck at a fancy graphic on the screen that he's... of the history of the world, and I can know that he's gonna walk over at the end of it and say he is the next great event in human history, and I can sit there and know what he's about to do before he does it.
[02:38:00.624 --> 02:38:02.865]  Do you know what that's like, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:38:04.042 --> 02:38:05.564]  I know a lot of you have that discernment.
[02:38:05.564 --> 02:38:08.467]  It's just, it's just, it's incredible.
[02:38:08.467 --> 02:38:09.408]  I know the enemy.
[02:38:09.408 --> 02:38:10.629]  I can see into their mind.
[02:38:10.629 --> 02:38:12.190]  I know who they are.
[02:38:12.190 --> 02:38:16.014]  I've studied them, researched them, read their writings, watched them for so long.
[02:38:16.014 --> 02:38:17.236]  I'm 36 years old.
[02:38:17.236 --> 02:38:21.660]  I've been doing this for 15 years, and I'm almost like, God, why me?
[02:38:24.462 --> 02:38:26.463]  But you've got to look in the mirror and ask yourself that as well.
[02:38:26.463 --> 02:38:28.744]  I mean, it's all of us together.
[02:38:28.744 --> 02:38:30.725]  And I know why a lot of you are scared.
[02:38:30.725 --> 02:38:32.866]  You're scared of the responsibility.
[02:38:32.866 --> 02:38:34.167]  You're scared of the consequences.
[02:38:34.167 --> 02:38:39.370]  But I'm here to tell you, the consequences to not resisting this dehumanization 110% are much greater.
[02:38:43.339 --> 02:38:45.921]  Then whatever the consequences are of resisting it.
[02:38:45.921 --> 02:38:49.183]  It's gonna be much worse if we don't say no to this.
[02:38:49.183 --> 02:38:50.684]  We know this is a tyranny.
[02:38:50.684 --> 02:38:52.405]  We know this is an oppression.
[02:38:52.405 --> 02:38:55.907]  We know this is a dehumanizing system.
[02:38:55.907 --> 02:38:57.749]  It's death!
[02:38:57.749 --> 02:39:04.093]  And we have got to realize how sick this world is, and we've got to get our priorities straight right now.
[02:39:04.093 --> 02:39:09.877]  I mean, what did Dick Gregory say?
[02:39:09.877 --> 02:39:13.139]  Dick Gregory, extremely famous icon of the civil rights movement.
[02:39:15.683 --> 02:39:18.345]  And I'd never talked to him, never tried to get him on.
[02:39:18.345 --> 02:39:20.707]  I saw he was on a 9-11 truth hunger strike.
[02:39:20.707 --> 02:39:28.333]  So we call up and he's like, I just love you and see your research and everybody all over the country talks about you more than anybody else.
[02:39:28.333 --> 02:39:29.674]  And then he said that on air.
[02:39:29.674 --> 02:39:30.135]  You heard him.
[02:39:30.135 --> 02:39:32.056]  I mean, you know what that's like?
[02:39:32.056 --> 02:39:39.082]  And then to know that they've got not just government attacking me and big corporations and big media demonizing me and lying about me and twisting what I say.
[02:39:40.595 --> 02:39:48.505]  The COINTELPRO attacking me from the conspiracy theory angle, and the white supremacists like Hal Turner, who I knew was a Fed, you could just tell it!
[02:39:48.505 --> 02:39:49.887]  I knew he was a globalist!
[02:39:49.887 --> 02:39:51.289]  I knew he was FBI!
[02:39:51.289 --> 02:39:52.991]  It came out I was exactly right!
[02:39:52.991 --> 02:39:53.852]  I know them!
[02:39:53.852 --> 02:39:56.355]  I know Glenn Beck's bad!
[02:39:56.355 --> 02:39:57.777]  I know Barack Obama's bad!
[02:39:57.777 --> 02:39:58.898]  I know, okay?
[02:39:58.898 --> 02:39:59.239]  I know!
[02:40:03.933 --> 02:40:07.035]  It's like looking out your door and there's a thunderstorm and rain's coming down.
[02:40:07.035 --> 02:40:08.135]  Cats and dogs.
[02:40:08.135 --> 02:40:12.378]  I know if I walk out there I'm gonna get drenched.
[02:40:12.378 --> 02:40:14.519]  It's raining so hard the rain's going sideways.
[02:40:14.519 --> 02:40:18.321]  An umbrella isn't gonna help.
[02:40:18.321 --> 02:40:22.163]  I knew those bin Laden videos were fake when I looked at them.
[02:40:22.163 --> 02:40:24.764]  I could tell one was a computer generation.
[02:40:24.764 --> 02:40:26.845]  A classic video game template.
[02:40:26.845 --> 02:40:27.966]  It wasn't even well done.
[02:40:27.966 --> 02:40:31.028]  They do them bad on purpose to condition you to accept lies.
[02:40:31.028 --> 02:40:33.529]  Where you know it's a lie at a subconscious level but accept it.
[02:40:37.745 --> 02:40:39.766]  And now they admit it's fake.
[02:40:39.766 --> 02:40:41.627]  The other one was a fat guy in a room.
[02:40:41.627 --> 02:40:43.508]  They admit they made that one.
[02:40:43.508 --> 02:40:46.389]  They come out and say we're taking the veterans' death benefits.
[02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:49.551]  They come out and say they're shipping the drugs in.
[02:40:49.551 --> 02:40:51.912]  They just, they just, they're trying to break our will.
[02:40:51.912 --> 02:40:55.793]  They're trying to dominate us and go, okay, you exposed us, fine, we're evil.
[02:40:55.793 --> 02:40:57.354]  What you gonna do about it?
[02:40:57.354 --> 02:41:01.396]  They're counting on yuppies not being able to admit they're putting sodium fluoride that's deadly in the water.
[02:41:01.396 --> 02:41:04.958]  They're counting on people not looking at the evidence the vaccines are killing you and maiming you.
[02:41:05.919 --> 02:41:10.984]  You've got to make the decision to admit the truth to yourself, and then what are you going to do about it?
[02:41:10.984 --> 02:41:16.929]  As one of the founding fathers said, I'm willing to know the whole truth, the horrible truth, and make preparation for it.
[02:41:16.929 --> 02:41:19.832]  Just denying the truth doesn't make you safe, it makes you in more danger.
[02:41:19.832 --> 02:41:21.554]  Sticking your head in the sand, the hyenas get you.
[02:41:22.927 --> 02:41:33.782]  Now for the balance of this segment, I want to bring up Steve Schenck, one of our great sponsors, and not only does this fund our operation, and we're funded by you, the listeners, but it's also the storable food company I believe in.
[02:41:33.782 --> 02:41:38.087]  I bought a lot of different places, didn't like it, or it had chemicals in it, or it had
[02:41:39.409 --> 02:41:43.793]  Fillers in it had things like MSG in it, or it was GMO.
[02:41:43.793 --> 02:41:48.156]  Not with Steve Schenck, and it's the biggest continually operating company in the nation.
[02:41:48.156 --> 02:41:55.142]  And I believe patriots need gardens and guns and gold, and that patriots need to have storable food.
[02:41:55.142 --> 02:41:57.164]  And I believe now is the time to take action.
[02:41:57.164 --> 02:41:59.806]  I'm going to cover news in the final segment, bringing Steve Schenck up.
[02:41:59.806 --> 02:42:01.428]  Steve, good to have you here with us today.
[02:42:03.305 --> 02:42:13.473]  Your buy three get one free is about to end and you haven't done this but one other time in the past and so much is happening with the grain shortages in Russia and with the depression.
[02:42:13.473 --> 02:42:16.455]  I've got all the news here where they're admitting we're going into a depression.
[02:42:16.455 --> 02:42:17.556]  I mean I believe in this.
[02:42:17.556 --> 02:42:20.679]  I hope folks get scorable foods from you while they can.
[02:42:20.679 --> 02:42:22.680]  Well absolutely.
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:30.767]  The fascinating thing Alex is that the only reason that we brought this buy three get one free up again is because
[02:42:31.371 --> 02:42:32.772]  We have been absolutely forced.
[02:42:32.772 --> 02:42:35.373]  This Russian thing is absolutely insane.
[02:42:35.373 --> 02:42:38.395]  Prices all over the place are going up like mad.
[02:42:38.395 --> 02:42:42.657]  And for the first time in three years, eFoods has to raise prices.
[02:42:42.657 --> 02:42:44.098]  We don't have any choice.
[02:42:44.098 --> 02:42:46.980]  Otherwise, we'll be on our back.
[02:42:46.980 --> 02:42:49.241]  It'll wipe us out.
[02:42:49.241 --> 02:42:59.487]  And so what we did was we pre-bought a whole bunch of the food that we could get from our suppliers at the current prices before they hit us with the price increases.
[02:43:00.057 --> 02:43:02.559]  And that's why we're able to do the buy three, get one free.
[02:43:02.559 --> 02:43:06.562]  But the response has been absolutely insane.
[02:43:06.562 --> 02:43:12.326]  We've got people calling us and emailing us and orders coming out of our ears.
[02:43:12.326 --> 02:43:17.330]  And we're just concerned about the length of time that we've given before that price increase.
[02:43:17.330 --> 02:43:22.093]  So what we did was we're going to jack it back seven days.
[02:43:22.093 --> 02:43:26.677]  So by the 27th of this month of September,
[02:43:27.262 --> 02:43:40.257]  If people will get their orders in just as fast as they can by the 27th of the month, we will have to go up to higher prices on the 28th just to survive for buying in this next batch of stuff.
[02:43:40.257 --> 02:43:46.985]  But what we've got right now is we've got the prices going up like crazy and the United States will refuse
[02:43:47.831 --> 02:43:56.153]  Uh, to, uh, to set limits on the amount of exports so these other countries are buying up our food and they're going to starve our citizens.
[02:43:56.153 --> 02:44:00.294]  Well, my main reason is they're admitting we're going into a depression.
[02:44:00.294 --> 02:44:01.694]  They're devaluing the dollar.
[02:44:01.694 --> 02:44:03.454]  Gold is exploding.
[02:44:03.454 --> 02:44:06.215]  Look, with all the uncertainty, I got scorable food.
[02:44:06.215 --> 02:44:07.155]  I got it from you.
[02:44:07.155 --> 02:44:08.315]  It's the best food I've gotten.
[02:44:08.315 --> 02:44:09.436]  It's the best price.
[02:44:09.436 --> 02:44:10.236]  You're a patriot.
[02:44:10.936 --> 02:44:12.337]  It supports the broadcast.
[02:44:12.337 --> 02:44:13.678]  Win, win, win, win, win.
[02:44:13.678 --> 02:44:16.799]  Folks, don't be dependent on the government to have food.
[02:44:16.799 --> 02:44:18.160]  This stuff lasts more than 10 years.
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:19.140]  Climate controlled.
[02:44:19.140 --> 02:44:21.442]  If it's in your garage like mine, 10 years.
[02:44:21.442 --> 02:44:23.623]  It's high quality, Nutraversal foods.
[02:44:23.623 --> 02:44:24.503]  Just check it out.
[02:44:24.503 --> 02:44:25.604]  efoodsdirect.com
[02:44:27.113 --> 02:44:28.554]  Sounds like a deal to me, Alex.
[02:44:28.554 --> 02:44:36.239]  And the main thing is, they're even trying to pass legislation right now that is going to limit the ability of people to even grow their own food.
[02:44:36.239 --> 02:44:37.560]  I've read the bill!
[02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:45.645]  It says if I pick figs and go and prepare them, slice them, make a pie, I have them in my backyard, if I do any preparation, it's illegal.
[02:44:45.645 --> 02:44:48.667]  I mean, this is worse than what Lennon did controlling food.
[02:44:48.667 --> 02:44:52.529]  I mean, this is, this is, this is, this is insane!
[02:44:52.529 --> 02:44:55.571]  That's why these people have to take advantage of this thing.
[02:44:56.490 --> 02:44:59.071]  We've held the prices down as much as we can.
[02:44:59.071 --> 02:45:03.573]  We know people have to pour every cent that they can in and get as much food as possible.
[02:45:03.573 --> 02:45:06.634]  That's why we're combining holding back the price increase.
[02:45:06.634 --> 02:45:10.756]  At the same time, we're doing this buy three, get one free.
[02:45:10.756 --> 02:45:12.416]  That's 25% savings.
[02:45:12.416 --> 02:45:15.978]  It's ridiculous, but we're going to be able to do it.
[02:45:15.978 --> 02:45:19.179]  And basically, you spell freedom F-O-O-D.
[02:45:19.981 --> 02:45:25.584]  And people can fight for their own freedom, and we'll sure help as much as we can, but they gotta move.
[02:45:25.584 --> 02:45:26.845]  They just absolutely have to move.
[02:45:26.845 --> 02:45:39.332]  Pentagon studies show that within 10 days without food, over 90% of people will start killing for food, and after 15 days, over 90% begin engaging in cannibalism.
[02:45:39.332 --> 02:45:41.473]  What you see in a movie like The Road,
[02:45:42.816 --> 02:45:43.196]  I don't
[02:46:02.806 --> 02:46:07.047]  90%, and this is a mainline statistic, of our population is urban.
[02:46:07.047 --> 02:46:09.148]  They're totally unself-sufficient.
[02:46:09.148 --> 02:46:12.288]  And in the Great Depression, we were the reverse of that.
[02:46:12.288 --> 02:46:15.989]  Right at 90% we're rural, 10% urban.
[02:46:15.989 --> 02:46:27.392]  Now that's flip-flopped, and if university studies show 7 million starved to death over the 10-year depression in the U.S., they estimate, what's gonna happen if we have a full-bore depression that we're now sliding into now?
[02:46:27.392 --> 02:46:29.513]  You are nuts if you don't have storable food.
[02:46:29.513 --> 02:46:30.013]  It's that simple.
[02:46:31.602 --> 02:46:38.847]  Absolutely, and the whole thing is that they're now calling this the greatest depression as opposed to what was there before.
[02:46:38.847 --> 02:46:47.553]  Do you realize that 40% of our families go to the grocery store right now and have to decide whether they're going to pay their bills or buy food?
[02:46:47.553 --> 02:46:50.395]  And that's what we're trying to fight, Alex.
[02:46:50.395 --> 02:46:51.776]  And that's why we're scrambling.
[02:46:51.776 --> 02:47:00.042]  We've got production up as high as we can, producing everything that we can, packing it up from this food that we bought in at the previous prices.
[02:47:00.766 --> 02:47:10.094]  And when this is gone, we're going to have to raise the price of government choice in a country where people are having a hard time affording it now.
[02:47:10.094 --> 02:47:12.416]  And the government's paying record amounts of people.
[02:47:12.416 --> 02:47:25.527]  I was reading in, it wasn't in Bloomberg, it was in the Economist, when I was out of town with Ventura, I was reading a lot of magazines, that they're paying record numbers to produce crops for ethanol.
[02:47:27.029 --> 02:47:30.930]  Oh I know, it's absolutely, it's so stupid it's beyond belief.
[02:47:30.930 --> 02:47:49.353]  But if you figure that the last figures came out that 52% of the population that's employed is working for the government, that leaves the remainder of the employed population having to support those people working for the government and all of the people that are on food stamps welfare that have lost their jobs.
[02:47:49.353 --> 02:47:53.934]  I've got, we're just going to post on our website this job loss
[02:47:54.755 --> 02:47:55.276]  I think so.
[02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:14.992]  And people have to move.
[02:48:14.992 --> 02:48:18.154]  Food is how you spell freedom.
[02:48:18.154 --> 02:48:20.615]  Well, you'll never stand on a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:48:20.615 --> 02:48:22.697]  You'll never stand on a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:48:22.697 --> 02:48:29.161]  eFoodsDirect, it's the letter E, foodsdirect.com, banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:48:29.161 --> 02:48:34.045]  This is a place I believe is the best place to get your, and it's gourmet style meals, basic meals.
[02:48:34.045 --> 02:48:38.808]  You've got a wide spectrum of different types of foods, special diets.
[02:48:38.808 --> 02:48:39.949]  I mean, this is the,
[02:48:40.589 --> 02:48:41.290]  It's just wonderful.
[02:48:41.290 --> 02:48:45.638]  People should at least go to efoodsdirect.com or call the toll free number and get a brochure.
[02:48:45.638 --> 02:48:47.501]  But don't screw around.
[02:48:47.501 --> 02:48:49.985]  Steve Schenck, give folks that toll free number if they want to call.
[02:48:49.985 --> 02:48:51.127]  It's 800-409-5633.
[02:48:55.725 --> 02:48:58.506]  800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 800-409-5633
[02:49:24.176 --> 02:49:24.676]  I don't
[02:49:43.406 --> 02:49:45.167]  Pentagon saying this.
[02:49:45.167 --> 02:49:46.548]  It's here in my stack.
[02:49:46.548 --> 02:49:52.252]  United States Joint Forces Command warns that huge US debt might lead to military impotence, default, or revolution.
[02:49:52.252 --> 02:49:58.096]  We've gone from a decade ago saying this is probably going to cause this, to we're now sliding into it.
[02:49:58.596 --> 02:50:02.298]  And so the good news is we were getting laughed at 10 years ago.
[02:50:02.298 --> 02:50:03.758]  Now people remember what we said.
[02:50:03.758 --> 02:50:04.779]  They're not laughing.
[02:50:04.779 --> 02:50:11.362]  And the Patriots, that remnant out there, is now the leadership to wake everybody else up and they're listening to us.
[02:50:11.362 --> 02:50:21.946]  So just thank God that so many people like yourself and Ron Paul and many others saw this coming because now people are going to listen to us and not the bankers who want to get even more power out of this crisis.
[02:50:21.946 --> 02:50:23.067]  Let me give people the number again.
[02:50:23.667 --> 02:50:27.510]  For folks that want to call toll free, don't procrastinate.
[02:50:27.510 --> 02:50:29.812]  We'll put that number back up on screen for folks.
[02:50:29.812 --> 02:50:34.976]  But the website's efoodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[02:50:34.976 --> 02:50:37.617]  And they're only running this for another week and a half or so.
[02:50:37.617 --> 02:50:40.199]  You heard it, the 27th of this month.
[02:50:40.199 --> 02:50:41.380]  Buy three, get one free.
[02:50:41.380 --> 02:50:43.322]  And it's already discounted down to nothing.
[02:50:43.322 --> 02:50:46.804]  Check it out, 800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:50:46.804 --> 02:50:47.945]  Steve Schenck, God bless you.
[02:50:47.945 --> 02:50:48.826]  Keep up God's work.
[02:50:49.704 --> 02:50:50.886]  Thanks Alex, you be good.
[02:51:01.260 --> 02:51:03.782]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[02:51:03.782 --> 02:51:07.344]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[02:51:07.344 --> 02:51:15.829]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[02:51:15.829 --> 02:51:20.712]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food.
[02:51:21.312 --> 02:51:26.934]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[02:51:26.934 --> 02:51:34.977]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food, too.
[02:51:34.977 --> 02:51:40.438]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[02:51:40.438 --> 02:51:41.639]  Our foods are their enemy.
[02:51:42.239 --> 02:51:48.104]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[02:51:48.104 --> 02:51:51.086]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[02:51:51.086 --> 02:51:54.349]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[02:51:54.349 --> 02:51:55.790]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence!
[02:52:03.007 --> 02:52:05.488]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:52:05.488 --> 02:52:06.749]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:06.749 --> 02:52:10.610]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.610 --> 02:52:12.911]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:12.911 --> 02:52:18.773]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:18.773 --> 02:52:25.016]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:25.436 --> 02:52:31.421]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:31.421 --> 02:52:35.605]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:35.605 --> 02:52:39.889]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:39.889 --> 02:52:45.834]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:45.834 --> 02:52:49.397]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:49.397 --> 02:52:51.378]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:51.378 --> 02:52:51.819]  It's here.

[02:53:16.376 --> 02:53:18.617]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[02:53:18.617 --> 02:53:20.619]  They are expensive payment plans.
[02:53:20.619 --> 02:53:25.482]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment plan?

[02:54:11.701 --> 02:54:19.624]  The globalists want to start curtailing free speech and shutting down the web, and the Pentagon admits that's their plan.
[02:54:36.380 --> 02:54:40.142]  The Department of Homeland Security being given a larger role in policing the World Wide Web.
[02:54:40.142 --> 02:54:48.587]  Under the new draft bill, which is combined with two versions originally crafted by Senators Lieberman and Rockefeller, Janet Napolitano's DHS will be handed
[02:54:49.605 --> 02:54:50.005]  We're good to go.
[02:55:16.317 --> 02:55:24.020]  So the borders are wide open, but your Internet's got to be controlled, and they lie to you and say the Internet is hooked into nuclear power plants and B-2 bombers.
[02:55:24.020 --> 02:55:25.241]  None of that's true.
[02:55:25.241 --> 02:55:26.601]  Even the Wall Street Journal admitted that.
[02:55:26.601 --> 02:55:28.042]  So they're lying to you.
[02:55:28.042 --> 02:55:29.162]  Well, of course they're lying!
[02:55:29.162 --> 02:55:31.123]  They're a pack of criminals!
[02:55:31.123 --> 02:55:38.366]  If they'll steal dead veterans' insurance money and tell people Corexit isn't bad for them, and that asbestos dust is good, what do you expect?
[02:55:40.307 --> 02:55:40.487]  I think?
[02:55:55.981 --> 02:55:58.622]  That's who they're busting in these news articles.
[02:55:58.622 --> 02:56:04.726]  Let's play a quick clip of Fox News Leraldo with the Marines admitting they're helping guard and grow the opium.
[02:56:04.726 --> 02:56:05.766]  Here it is.
[02:56:05.766 --> 02:56:10.689]  The province, as you suggest, has become addicted to opium in many, many ways.
[02:56:10.689 --> 02:56:13.531]  That is the principal crop that is being grown here.
[02:56:14.111 --> 02:56:16.873]  The Taliban lend the farmers the money.
[02:56:16.873 --> 02:56:18.934]  They are indebted to the Taliban.
[02:56:18.934 --> 02:56:20.515]  They have to grow the opium.
[02:56:20.515 --> 02:56:30.941]  Now the Marines, in their success, are in a sense a victim of their success because now the population is, you know, they have these opium fields and we are tolerating it.
[02:56:30.941 --> 02:56:40.267]  We are tolerating the cultivation of the opium because we know that if we were to destroy it now, the population would turn against the Marines and it would be a real security risk.
[02:56:40.267 --> 02:56:40.807]  Let me introduce
[02:56:41.047 --> 02:56:45.871]  Lieutenant Colonel Brian Christmas, he's the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines.
[02:56:45.871 --> 02:56:48.894]  Really a wonderful group of Marines here.
[02:56:48.894 --> 02:56:52.497]  I know that you care deeply about this contradiction.
[02:56:52.497 --> 02:56:57.641]  The fact that here you have one of the best fighting forces in the world ever mounted.
[02:56:57.641 --> 02:57:01.184]  And in a sense, you're watching as this opium is being grown.
[02:57:01.184 --> 02:57:02.966]  I know it grinds at your gut.
[02:57:03.686 --> 02:57:04.747]  How do you deal with it?
[02:57:04.747 --> 02:57:06.167]  What are you doing about it?
[02:57:06.167 --> 02:57:08.148]  Well, frankly, this is a part of their culture.
[02:57:08.148 --> 02:57:12.430]  So, while it might grind in my gut, it's what they do.
[02:57:12.430 --> 02:57:16.652]  We provide them security, we're providing them resources, and we're providing them alternatives.
[02:57:16.652 --> 02:57:19.193]  The alternatives are different crops to grow.
[02:57:19.193 --> 02:57:21.734]  They're getting the seed and the fertilizer to do it.
[02:57:21.734 --> 02:57:24.396]  They can rotate any of their crops that they want.
[02:57:24.396 --> 02:57:28.277]  If they want to get rid of their wheat and grow cotton for the winter, they can do that, and we're going to help them do it.
[02:57:28.277 --> 02:57:29.358]  So the same thing goes for the cotton.
[02:57:29.878 --> 02:57:34.321]  So you think that, you know, we were at the market and everywhere we go... It goes on and on.
[02:57:34.321 --> 02:57:41.685]  So it starts coming out that the troops are there actually helping grow it and supplying them with the seeds and with the fertilizer.
[02:57:41.685 --> 02:57:48.269]  And then if they catch your idiot teenager with some, they're going to prison.
[02:57:48.269 --> 02:57:54.633]  Do not use their prescription drugs, all the drugs they're pushing, the Prozac, the hillbilly heroin, the
[02:57:56.238 --> 02:57:59.199]  Oxycontin, don't use any of their crud.
[02:57:59.199 --> 02:58:00.300]  Get off their cigarettes.
[02:58:00.300 --> 02:58:01.180]  Get off their liquor.
[02:58:01.180 --> 02:58:02.401]  Just get off all of it.
[02:58:02.401 --> 02:58:04.782]  We're a drugged-out society.
[02:58:04.782 --> 02:58:10.305]  And when the cops stop you at a checkpoint, want to search your car, go, look, I'm not using the crap your bosses ship in.
[02:58:10.305 --> 02:58:15.567]  Every cop I've talked to in the last 20 years knows the government ships most of the drugs in.
[02:58:15.567 --> 02:58:16.828]  And they just put it in your face.
[02:58:16.828 --> 02:58:17.868]  Well, we've got to do it.
[02:58:17.868 --> 02:58:20.670]  You know, it's just the way it is.
[02:58:20.670 --> 02:58:21.970]  But they're investigating.
[02:58:21.970 --> 02:58:23.771]  Are any of the troops helping ship it out?
[02:58:23.771 --> 02:58:25.172]  Give me a break.
[02:58:27.998 --> 02:58:32.722]  And they make the Marines stand up there and, you know, talk about opium like it's a good, you know, this is a good thing.
[02:58:32.722 --> 02:58:34.643]  This is how we beat the Taliban.
[02:58:34.643 --> 02:58:38.566]  The Taliban was created by the CIA.
[02:58:38.566 --> 02:58:39.447]  God bless you all.
