[01:59.080 --> 02:03.040]  fall because we know the cycles we understand how the central banks
[02:03.040 --> 02:08.120]  manipulate all of this that's coming up also I mentioned this yesterday but now
[02:08.120 --> 02:12.640]  it's really big news of course it's old news to our audience in the last decade
[02:12.640 --> 02:18.160]  or plus but Ministry of Defense probes claim that soldiers are smuggling
[02:18.160 --> 02:25.960]  heroin from Afghanistan probing the claim probing the claim that's like

[02:32.840 --> 02:41.920]  in New Orleans it's a fact they played in New Orleans in plain view the CIA told
[02:41.920 --> 02:47.360]  spy talk three months ago in the Washington Post that they put out fake
[02:47.360 --> 02:51.560]  bin Laden videos Governor Ridge came out and wrote a book admitting they put out
[02:51.560 --> 02:55.840]  fake terror alerts for political purposes to scare the population into
[02:55.840 --> 03:02.520]  submission at AP Reuters BBC Fox News they go out and say yes the Marines and
[03:02.520 --> 03:07.080]  Army help grow the opium this is how we win the hearts and minds so of course
[03:07.080 --> 03:14.560]  they're also shipping it out tens of thousands of tons of pure heroin being
[03:14.560 --> 03:17.600]  processed out of opium every year flooding the streets of Europe and the
[03:17.600 --> 03:24.000]  United States and Russia and Japan and China opium production is up more than
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.560]  12-fold since 2001 in the invasion our government takes over been caught
[03:30.560 --> 03:35.600]  bringing in cocaine in the 60s heroin in the 60s cocaine in the 80s I mean

[03:41.160 --> 03:49.120]  apologizing for it I don't like heroin and cocaine in fact when I broke my leg
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.160]  and had to have surgery I wouldn't even take the pain pills after it because it
[03:53.160 --> 03:57.080]  made me feel so nauseous and I hate the way they feel so I don't like drugs
[03:57.080 --> 04:02.600]  okay unless you're talking about coffee and and it's a drug too folks make no
[04:02.600 --> 04:07.240]  doubt about I'm trying to get off it but I haven't ever kicked the habit yet the

[04:42.280 --> 04:47.360]  should have done a long time ago and I'll break it down we get back this is
[04:47.360 --> 04:51.760]  very frightening and it's the biggest threat we face domestically we'll

[08:36.640 --> 08:43.440]  opium production in Afghanistan and all the evidence of the fact that the
[08:43.440 --> 08:46.880]  British and US governments the private corporations that control them and the
[08:46.880 --> 08:51.880]  private contractors are producing and growing and protecting the opium field

[09:01.960 --> 09:05.480]  and revolution what did the British Ministry of Defense say three years
[09:05.480 --> 09:11.280]  ago same thing the IMF is worried about total implosion and revolution that's
[09:11.280 --> 09:14.680]  like if somebody goes and pours gasoline all over your house and lights a fire
[09:14.680 --> 09:18.640]  then they call the fire department and say I'm worried a fire may start the
[09:18.640 --> 09:22.240]  fire is already burning and they started it but now they're posing as our
[09:22.240 --> 09:27.480]  saviors in this emergency reorganization where they openly set up
[09:27.480 --> 09:33.920]  world government enforced by paramilitary military police and private
[09:33.920 --> 09:39.640]  mercenaries and carried out with a huge beast tracking control grid of

[10:06.680 --> 10:13.600]  and the key Sunday on the Sunday broadcast I went after Republican leader
[10:13.600 --> 10:18.640]  Boehner who had made a statement saying that he would support just a quote
[10:18.640 --> 10:22.980]  middle-class tax cut and allow the tax on the rich to go through of course the
[10:22.980 --> 10:28.360]  rich they say are 125,000 individually yearly after taxes that's about 70,000
[10:28.360 --> 10:35.160]  dollars that's not rich couples quarter million 250,000 that's the main group
[10:35.160 --> 10:40.080]  still buying cars going to hotels going to restaurants putting their children
[10:40.080 --> 10:47.520]  in private school going to the shopping mall who run businesses and employ
[10:47.520 --> 10:52.480]  people and every government study and even admit this now shows that if this
[10:52.480 --> 10:58.000]  tax cut expires that it's gonna further devastate the economy and Boehner was
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.480]  saying he would support letting some tax cuts expire well now he's backed off of
[11:04.480 --> 11:09.200]  that because of pressure from true conservative constituents and that's
[11:09.200 --> 11:13.480]  good news and they're leading the charge to extend all the tax cuts that's the
[11:13.480 --> 11:19.760]  bare minimum we can do for the economy but the globalist on record and I had
[11:19.760 --> 11:23.160]  Martin Moreno on yesterday reading the quotes out of the New York Times said
[11:23.160 --> 11:27.360]  yes we want to shut the economy down we want to reduce the economy to have a
[11:27.360 --> 11:32.400]  lower carbon footprint now they want to shut off the economy to bankrupt you and
[11:32.400 --> 11:36.840]  force you on the government subsidy so they control you it's called serfdom but
[11:36.840 --> 11:42.120]  Boehner has come out in business and media newspaper and said Obama and
[11:42.120 --> 11:48.960]  Congress intentionally spending to force value-added tax and there's also a
[11:48.960 --> 11:53.840]  New Hampshire senator Judd Greg is also saying the same thing that they want to
[11:53.840 --> 11:58.120]  bankrupt the economy to force a total takeover of society so we're actually
[11:58.120 --> 12:02.720]  getting honesty now and it's the alternative media and libertarian media
[12:02.720 --> 12:06.960]  and true conservative media constitutional media the Constitution
[12:06.960 --> 12:11.560]  party oathkeepers Chuck Baldwin Ron Paul myself Judge Andrew de Palatano and
[12:11.560 --> 12:16.560]  others who've got the true credentials of liberty who've never flip-flopped on
[12:16.560 --> 12:22.440]  freedom that are forcing this to happen right now and forcing the Democrats to
[12:22.440 --> 12:27.760]  try to keep their move to get rid of these tax cuts in place then they'll be
[12:27.760 --> 12:31.800]  an even bigger implosion in the House and Senate they'll lose almost all their
[12:31.800 --> 12:36.000]  seats and we'll get some real patriots a lot of these candidates are actually
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.560]  good in there and then we can not just get rid of the tax increases but cut
[12:40.560 --> 12:50.400]  even more see you can't compromise folks many of the founding fathers put out
[12:50.400 --> 12:55.800]  the quote in different variations of justice be done though the heavens may
[12:55.800 --> 13:02.240]  fall I heard a talk show host yesterday saying oh well you know even if
[13:02.240 --> 13:05.200]  there's evidence of 9-11 being an inside job or the government having prior
[13:05.200 --> 13:08.960]  knowledge and letting it happen or whatever the case is you know should we
[13:08.960 --> 13:12.360]  allow this to come out this could destroy total confidence in the
[13:12.360 --> 13:17.560]  government and everything could collapse well it doesn't matter I don't think
[13:17.560 --> 13:21.840]  that's the case but the corrupt forces they've taken over our government they
[13:21.840 --> 13:27.600]  will collapse I mean that's the issue you've got to do the right thing no
[13:27.600 --> 13:32.240]  matter what happens and I go back to this and I want to talk about this now
[13:32.240 --> 13:37.360]  that I'm getting into the economy and a lot of other key issues because it's
[13:37.360 --> 13:42.400]  important I don't really know anybody else who's ever been in a syndicated
[13:42.400 --> 13:47.920]  talk show host position who's been offered to be a big giant national host
[13:47.920 --> 13:52.000]  who's basically been offered the job that Glenn Beck has before Glenn Beck was
[13:52.000 --> 14:00.760]  even on the scene and it wasn't hard for me to say no to those offers because I
[14:00.760 --> 14:05.080]  was told you'll just be a mainline firebrand Republican no more of this
[14:05.080 --> 14:09.240]  conspiracy stuff sides Alex we know it's just a stick we know you don't mean
[14:09.240 --> 14:14.640]  all this and I'm like of course I mean all this see I care about the truth and
[14:14.640 --> 14:19.560]  I care about my family and my family name I was thinking about this this weekend
[14:19.560 --> 14:24.880]  I had this image or almost vision in my mind of being an old man and having a
[14:24.880 --> 14:29.760]  heart attack and collapsing down on the grass you know in this vision or this
[14:29.760 --> 14:36.120]  image I had in my mind I pictured myself as an old man and it was so real and I
[14:36.120 --> 14:40.240]  was collapsing having a heart attack and I was in great pain and as I fell onto
[14:40.240 --> 14:45.740]  the grass I had this last parting image of my healthy grandchildren of my
[14:45.740 --> 14:51.880]  children of a safe society of a society that guards liberty and honor and
[14:51.880 --> 15:00.120]  defeating the globalist and that if I can just die knowing that we made the
[15:00.120 --> 15:07.200]  world a better place then we left it then that's total victory and I had that
[15:07.200 --> 15:15.360]  intense image and it was really a great comfort that that that is fulfillment
[15:15.360 --> 15:22.320]  it's not houses or cars or women or power and last night we were up here
[15:22.320 --> 15:26.760]  researching government psychological warfare manuals written by Edward
[15:26.760 --> 15:32.920]  Bernays and others and it was going back almost 90 years ago it was about 1920 or
[15:32.920 --> 15:40.240]  so this particular document Bernays said media is honored in the United States
[15:40.240 --> 15:48.040]  newspapers mainly and radio was being developed media is honored for being
[15:48.040 --> 15:51.760]  muck rakers for really telling the truth for exposing corruption and letting
[15:51.760 --> 15:55.920]  the chips fall where they may and that's the newspapers people buy and he said
[15:55.920 --> 15:59.700]  how we're going to get them is we're gonna start these press correspondence
[15:59.700 --> 16:04.000]  dinners and Bernays started it in 1920 and he openly said with the Department
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.240]  of War and with the White House they said we'll get we'll have big dinners
[16:09.240 --> 16:14.160]  every month in New York and in DC and in Chicago those are the big three main
[16:14.160 --> 16:19.840]  cities at the time and we'll bring them in an influence pedal and let them be
[16:19.840 --> 16:24.800]  with the movie stars that were emerging and with famous writers and with the
[16:24.800 --> 16:30.080]  politicians and smooths with the bankers so that it's a social club like a
[16:30.080 --> 16:36.000]  fraternity and so these people will be afraid to expose corruption or they
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.960]  won't be invited to the party and then at the parties they can basically be
[16:40.960 --> 16:47.840]  bought off by these clicks and I was watching a correspondence dinner from
[16:47.840 --> 16:51.800]  last year with Glenn Beck wearing his skull and crossbones
[16:51.800 --> 16:58.000]  Cumberbund or corset and I was watching the Democrats the Republicans all of
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  them together and I was going back to what Jesse Ventura said in Obama
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.560]  deception about how it's like professional wrestling there in the day
[17:04.560 --> 17:08.920]  they get up there and fight with each other Republicans and Democrats but at
[17:08.920 --> 17:14.240]  night they go out and have dinner and get drinks together and their daughters
[17:14.240 --> 17:18.640]  and sons marry each other and you know Mary Madeline's married to to Carville
[17:18.640 --> 17:22.780]  and you've got these other families were one brothers the Republican
[17:22.780 --> 17:25.800]  strategist the other brothers a Democratic strategist and they're just
[17:25.800 --> 17:29.880]  playing the field and that's what Fox News does with its different holdings
[17:29.880 --> 17:34.800]  they'll put out a globalist carbon taxing anti-gun message on TV but put
[17:34.800 --> 17:39.000]  out at we're conservative on Fox News owning the market owning the full
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.760]  spectrum and I was watching the correspondence dinners as they're
[17:43.760 --> 17:49.720]  led into the big facility and they let fans in to cheer and yell and the
[17:49.720 --> 17:53.640]  news camera shows them that's the image of the public who's watching the TV
[17:53.640 --> 17:56.560]  that's the mirror image of them that this is important that this is what
[17:56.560 --> 18:02.640]  matters and then the Hollywood people the music stars the TV stars these race
[18:02.640 --> 18:07.480]  horses being led in and puffing up and getting off on talking to the media and
[18:07.480 --> 18:13.920]  getting off on being seen by the crowds and being led in to be compromised all
[18:13.920 --> 18:21.240]  together in this spectacle and then I'm reading the warfare manuals how they did
[18:21.240 --> 18:31.600]  it and so that's the issue here not only have I refused to sell out to all of
[18:31.600 --> 18:37.760]  that we've gone in and created a third way versus the fake left and fake right
[18:37.760 --> 18:43.800]  and Hollywood is on fire with many of the biggest names who now are obsessed
[18:43.800 --> 18:47.880]  with the New World Order global government eugenics they know all this
[18:47.880 --> 18:52.120]  information and there's a fight in Hollywood going on in at least the last
[18:52.120 --> 18:57.480]  six years with the old line producers and the big corporate owners trying to
[18:57.480 --> 19:03.160]  threaten and suppress a total revolt of all the Hollywood people to stop playing
[19:03.160 --> 19:08.760]  the part of fake liberals and eugenicist and to break out and say no to James
[19:08.760 --> 19:14.640]  Cameron and say no to Steven Spielberg I mean I have this directly you heard
[19:14.640 --> 19:18.840]  Michael Braverman you big TV producer without me even bringing it up say this

[24:08.320 --> 24:12.160]  the system is trying to keep us in a controlled left-right paradigm and how
[24:12.160 --> 24:16.320]  there's revolts happening within the Democrats the Republicans Hollywood and
[24:16.320 --> 24:22.280]  the media and how the system is really trying to co-opt all of those subgroups
[24:22.280 --> 24:27.200]  and keep them back on the reservation that is coming up it is so important but
[24:27.200 --> 24:31.040]  I want to get into economic news right now I talked about United States Joint
[24:31.040 --> 24:34.440]  Forces Command warns that huge U.S. debt might lead to military impotence
[24:34.440 --> 24:40.160]  default and revolution gold surges the all-time high $1270 silver
[24:40.160 --> 24:45.200]  exploding as we told you it would we understand how this works Kurt Nemo has
[24:45.200 --> 24:50.040]  a key report up on info wars.com and prison planet.com golden silver
[24:50.040 --> 24:55.080]  explode as banksters abandon market manipulation and it gets into how they
[24:55.080 --> 24:58.600]  decided at least for during the fall to stop manipulating it because they've
[24:58.600 --> 25:03.000]  been unsuccessful to hold it down and of course the dollar is plunging that's
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.440]  why they always try to keep gold and silver down before because it's a real
[25:05.440 --> 25:10.880]  commodity that competes with their fiat fraudster derivatives financial
[25:10.880 --> 25:16.120]  speculation system that they've unfairly used to consolidate global power now
[25:16.120 --> 25:19.920]  they want a carbon tax to fund their total takeover that's in shambles
[25:19.920 --> 25:26.040]  crashing and burning as the fraud comes out it's not a foregone conclusion that
[25:26.040 --> 25:30.240]  we're gonna go into tyranny we can get a reprieve like Nineveh when Jonah went
[25:30.240 --> 25:38.160]  there folks you don't have to give in to evil there is a tide in the affairs of
[25:38.160 --> 25:43.880]  men when taken at the flood leads on to liberty to slightly alter Julius Caesar's
[25:43.880 --> 25:48.360]  quote so I've got all these reports here's
[25:48.360 --> 25:53.480]  Bloomberg gold reaches record stocks fall on economy concern yen gains I
[25:53.480 --> 25:57.560]  briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because he is the owner of the Genesis
[25:57.560 --> 26:02.520]  Network he is our biggest sponsor our biggest sponsor and that's who I work
[26:02.520 --> 26:07.800]  with us who has the best deals and he bought a bunch of gold and silver three
[26:07.800 --> 26:11.960]  months ago when it was way down sold out of that at the lower price when it went
[26:11.960 --> 26:15.200]  up he bought more in the last three weeks when it was a lot lower than it is
[26:15.200 --> 26:19.640]  now that's about to run out and this will run out again it'll go up even more
[26:19.640 --> 26:23.840]  all the evidence shows and then we'll give you the next discount but you need
[26:23.840 --> 26:28.520]  to get on this train now he's got silver and the best deal I've ever seen him
[26:28.520 --> 26:33.360]  offer he's got smoking deals on sovereigns and buffaloes and Frank's and
[26:33.360 --> 26:37.440]  go search these radio specials you're not gonna find anything near this
[26:37.440 --> 26:42.320]  anywhere I challenge you you've got a link to it in Curt Demo story about the
[26:42.320 --> 26:45.680]  bankers of abandoning gold and silver manipulation for now the bottom we've
[26:45.680 --> 26:48.960]  got a link to the radio special there online people always requested can't we
[26:48.960 --> 26:52.200]  have the same special online yes it's there but briefly I wanted to bring
[26:52.200 --> 26:56.440]  Ted up before I get back into the news and more on the economy Ted again we
[26:56.440 --> 27:02.480]  Bob Chapman called it with precision two months ago a month ago two weeks ago
[27:02.480 --> 27:07.280]  I mean here we are and the fall is just getting started Ted yeah you're right
[27:07.280 --> 27:11.360]  about that Alex boy the market is just hot as a pistol right now what I'm doing
[27:11.360 --> 27:16.320]  now is I mean last time I offered the Frank at $270 I have just a little
[27:16.320 --> 27:20.760]  tiny bit of inventory left but it is going to be going up that coin is going
[27:20.760 --> 27:26.720]  to be $280 here real shortly with the price increase on gold I am gonna hold
[27:26.720 --> 27:31.160]  it and I'll take the loss because I just really want people to get involved and
[27:31.160 --> 27:35.280]  at this time that is just a smoke and deal especially considering the fact
[27:35.280 --> 27:38.960]  that you get that forecaster subscription for an entire year with it
[27:38.960 --> 27:45.800]  it's like buying gold at $555 an ounce that that coin that walking liberty
[27:45.800 --> 27:51.800]  half at $975 I was searching eBay I couldn't find them rarely can you find
[27:51.800 --> 27:56.680]  them for $11 a piece mostly in the $12 and I'm selling them right now at
[27:56.680 --> 28:03.160]  $909.75 a coin I mean that is just phenomenal but the thing is is that
[28:03.160 --> 28:06.520]  people really need to get moving now I mean Europe has fallen apart and all
[28:06.520 --> 28:10.240]  prices are rising we're seeing that inflation coming that everybody's been
[28:10.240 --> 28:14.880]  talking about let me explain this silver is at $20 and 50 cents right now
[28:14.880 --> 28:20.400]  according to Kitco you're selling silver at below spot well this that would be
[28:20.400 --> 28:24.280]  the walking liberty half which is you know it walking liberty halves are
[28:24.280 --> 28:29.000]  0.72 per thousand it's just probably just a little bit over but it's not by
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.960]  much it's just right there hanging in the main thing is walking liberty has
[28:32.960 --> 28:37.360]  don't trade at this price I mean you can't buy walkers at this level the
[28:37.360 --> 28:42.680]  point is it's a half ounce coin yeah well the silver coin is a half of the
[28:42.680 --> 28:47.560]  silver dollar size it contains a little bit more than it's almost a half of
[28:47.560 --> 28:51.920]  an ounce it's like 0.36 something if you take the point is nobody selling this
[28:51.920 --> 28:55.360]  stuff right at spot and you've got it there and that's going to run out
[28:55.360 --> 28:59.360]  quickly too oh yeah absolutely that's the whole point right now I mean that it's
[28:59.360 --> 29:04.240]  a so it's a very finite supply I don't have a whole lot of them there but and
[29:04.240 --> 29:07.560]  the price is rising is a matter of fact if you go to the internet right now
[29:07.560 --> 29:11.720]  you're gonna find the price has gone up over $11 on this coin and I'm sitting
[29:11.720 --> 29:16.280]  you're holding the coin down at 975 I mean it is yeah this is a no-brainer
[29:16.280 --> 29:24.920]  folks I feel really good promoting this 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 tell them
[29:24.920 --> 29:29.560]  it's the radio specials to get the price when all this was lower their regular

[33:42.400 --> 33:48.880]  into earlier in the hour in the second segment the system wants to keep people
[33:48.880 --> 33:54.760]  as mainline Republicans and so whenever the alternative media wakes up
[33:54.760 --> 33:59.080]  conservatives libertarians constitutionalist people that I identify on
[33:59.080 --> 34:03.640]  the issues with a lot more than the Democrats when those groups start to
[34:03.640 --> 34:07.880]  really wake up and the system can't keep them on the reservation the
[34:07.880 --> 34:13.280]  establishment starts to take on our political and societal colorations they
[34:13.280 --> 34:20.080]  camouflage themselves and you've got the Democrats and Hollywood and the so
[34:20.080 --> 34:23.240]  called liberal media that aren't liberal at all if you look at the true
[34:23.240 --> 34:29.280]  historical measurement posing as is it as if their anti-establishment when
[34:29.280 --> 34:34.000]  George W. Bush is in power and they're against the wars the secret arrest the
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.440]  torture of the Patriot Act as soon as Obama gets in he breaks all his
[34:37.440 --> 34:43.600]  promises accelerates all of those different tyrannical policies and
[34:43.600 --> 34:47.160]  suddenly they're defending it and saying well Bush did it it must be okay and
[34:47.160 --> 34:51.920]  the same Wall Street interest the big mega six banks that are waging war
[34:51.920 --> 34:55.840]  against your local banks waging war against local farmers always trying to
[34:55.840 --> 35:09.480]  vertically integrate and create consolidation they are desperately
[35:09.480 --> 35:12.880]  trying to keep control of these different groups and when I was talking
[35:12.880 --> 35:17.840]  about Hollywood it's not just big Hollywood stars that I've talked to or
[35:17.840 --> 35:23.480]  met with or talked to over the phone it's it's talking to them about all the
[35:23.480 --> 35:27.320]  other big stars that they're talking to that are awake and then talking to other
[35:27.320 --> 35:32.680]  people in television and in radio at the highest levels the highest levels of
[35:32.680 --> 35:37.760]  print media you name it that in Hollywood there's a huge awakening going on for
[35:37.760 --> 35:42.080]  at least a decade accelerating the last five or six years where they understand
[35:42.080 --> 35:47.600]  that so-called liberalism is eugenics and globalism and anti-human that they
[35:47.600 --> 35:50.840]  understand that there's a left-right paradigm they understand that the same
[35:50.840 --> 36:00.920]  financial interests control both sides they know that and so they're doing
[36:00.920 --> 36:05.320]  everything they can out of one side of their mouth to attack people that talk
[36:05.320 --> 36:10.040]  about world government but at the same time admit that world government's real
[36:10.040 --> 36:15.080]  but basically spin it like it's not that bad it's a solution to our problems
[36:15.080 --> 36:19.760]  that's what the so-called liberals are doing the mainline conservatives the
[36:19.760 --> 36:25.840]  Sean Hannity's the Glenn Beck's the Rush Limbaugh's they said for many years in
[36:25.840 --> 36:29.240]  the case of limbaugh more than 20 that world government doesn't exist the CFR
[36:29.240 --> 36:34.040]  didn't even exist that there's no plan for central banks to take over the
[36:34.040 --> 36:38.440]  planet that there's no carbon taxes that none of that existed but as
[36:38.440 --> 36:44.960]  alternative media forced all of that out into the open they then came out and
[36:44.960 --> 36:50.240]  started saying okay a little bit of this is true but we're the gatekeepers and
[36:50.240 --> 36:57.560]  we're still going to demonize Ron Paul Alex Jones Chuck Baldwin oath keepers
[36:57.560 --> 37:02.880]  and many others I mean these guys on one show will say these groups are good and
[37:02.880 --> 37:09.360]  on the next show say they're bad and vice versa and it's basically here's the
[37:09.360 --> 37:13.400]  analogy it's kind of like when you're fishing for perch or crappie and you
[37:13.400 --> 37:17.880]  take the hook and you put a big fat worm on it and you drop it down in the
[37:17.880 --> 37:21.880]  water and the worm looks really good and tasty and delicious to the fish but
[37:21.880 --> 37:28.640]  inside of it is a hook or you can use the analogy of rat poison 98% good food
[37:28.640 --> 37:35.640]  2% poison so the rat eats it tastes a little funny the rat dies two days
[37:35.640 --> 37:44.960]  later and so that's the issue here we know that the system understands that
[37:44.960 --> 37:49.480]  there's a total political realignment the third great awakening in US history
[37:49.480 --> 37:55.080]  they understand that that's happening they in the Pentagon reports in all
[37:55.080 --> 37:58.800]  their internal documentation much of it public they understand that there is a
[37:58.800 --> 38:05.720]  huge systemic awakening happening on every front and they're in trouble so
[38:05.720 --> 38:10.400]  they have the Democrats play the part of anti-establishment when Bush is in they
[38:10.400 --> 38:14.120]  get in power they play the part of establishment they declare two years
[38:14.120 --> 38:17.880]  ago that the tea parties are a right-wing Republican creation which they
[38:17.880 --> 38:23.400]  weren't they were organic movement created by 9-11 truth on record picked
[38:23.400 --> 38:29.000]  up then by the Ron Paul revolution 2007 2008 Republicans were being booed off
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.920]  the stage everywhere at town halls a year and a half ago and in came Dick
[38:32.920 --> 38:37.560]  army in came newt genrich in came freedom works in came Glenn Beck and
[38:37.560 --> 38:41.520]  they had to change the rhetoric instead of saying militias are dangerous arrest
[38:41.520 --> 38:47.200]  them they want to blow up Oklahoma City again Ron Paul may be dangerous we need
[38:47.200 --> 38:52.280]  to use the army against his supporters these are quotes they then shifted oh
[38:52.280 --> 39:00.800]  no these people are good so that they can lead and control the movement Glenn
[39:00.800 --> 39:04.040]  Beck still supports wars he still supports the Patriot Act he says
[39:04.040 --> 39:08.560]  torture is a great thing and that Jack Bauer is a hero and that we need more
[39:08.560 --> 39:16.200]  of this if you accept torture then you accept the Nazis torturing or the
[39:16.200 --> 39:19.440]  Soviets torturing or the malice torturing or the North Vietnamese
[39:19.440 --> 39:23.800]  torturing you can't do that and they and they sell it oh we just waterboarded a
[39:23.800 --> 39:30.720]  few people no they didn't they tortured tens of thousands in the camps in Iraq
[39:30.720 --> 39:34.280]  alone including raping their children in front of them that's the army's own
[39:34.280 --> 39:39.640]  report in fact guys search the term for people watching on prison planet TV
[39:39.640 --> 39:42.600]  radio listeners can can search this themselves and pull it up it'll be
[39:42.600 --> 39:52.960]  Newsweek AP Reuters army report details torture of children well when the CIA
[39:52.960 --> 39:56.640]  thought they had you and thought you were buying into this in 2002 they were
[39:56.640 --> 40:00.160]  in the Washington Post saying yes we torture people's children in front of
[40:00.160 --> 40:03.480]  them that's in my film road to tearing the screenshot of the Washington Post
[40:03.480 --> 40:11.560]  newspaper where they promoted it and Beck always tries to re-invoke that
[40:11.560 --> 40:15.480]  remember how scared you were for 9-11 and you said do whatever you have to but
[40:15.480 --> 40:23.320]  what he doesn't tell you is that we got my act type reports from Texas and from
[40:23.320 --> 40:30.040]  the federal government from our sources and publish them in 2001 2 3 4 5 6 7
[40:30.040 --> 40:37.400]  8 9 only when we got a new document that had been issued under Obama did Fox
[40:37.400 --> 40:41.400]  News and Glenn Beck pick it up going they want to go after veterans they want
[40:41.400 --> 40:45.080]  to go after Ron Paul they want to go after gun owners they want to go after
[40:45.080 --> 40:48.480]  returning veterans they don't want you having a libertarian bumper sticker or
[40:48.480 --> 40:53.840]  get us out of the UN sticker this is outrageous but just a year before that
[40:53.840 --> 41:05.480]  and I had the videos Glenn back Sean Hannity Bill O'Reilly and the MSNBC
[41:05.480 --> 41:11.600]  host all of them we have clips of all of this we're doing deep research we'd
[41:11.600 --> 41:17.000]  seen these overall you know week after week over the last three years but now
[41:17.000 --> 41:21.480]  we've been compiling it every night I'm up here late watching this stuff and
[41:21.480 --> 41:27.000]  getting sicker and sicker and sicker and this is the key what you're about to
[41:27.000 --> 41:38.360]  get listen to me carefully why was I so horrified by Hannity and Beck and O'Reilly
[41:38.360 --> 41:45.960]  three years ago and Joe Scarborough all of them because they were word for word
[41:45.960 --> 41:54.240]  reading internal secret my act type demonization reports of good Americans
[41:54.240 --> 41:59.440]  bedrock Americans the heart of this country I had all those documents and
[41:59.440 --> 42:03.160]  it published them and many others have gotten similar documents and published
[42:03.160 --> 42:08.680]  them and I knew the script and I knew it was ADL Southern Poverty Law Center via
[42:08.680 --> 42:13.200]  the feds and I knew that they were reading and whoever was loading their
[42:13.200 --> 42:18.160]  teleprompters was putting high-level government secret demonization
[42:18.160 --> 42:25.800]  information into the public through these mouthpieces not only do those
[42:25.800 --> 42:29.120]  neocons all go to the White House and admit they got marching orders there
[42:29.120 --> 42:36.320]  they were do you understand this is the key that under Bush they accelerated the
[42:36.320 --> 42:44.560]  Clinton era demonization of patriots of land rights activist of anti-carbon tax
[42:44.560 --> 42:50.280]  activist of anti-man-made global warming activist of libertarians of God
[42:50.280 --> 42:55.680]  owners they weren't spending any other time except for a few staged arrest of
[42:55.680 --> 43:01.760]  nutcases with Muslims they weren't spending their time on that 90 plus
[43:01.760 --> 43:07.080]  percent in all these reports was pointed at basically people that got
[43:07.080 --> 43:10.240]  portraits of John Wayne hanging in their living room by the way I got a lot of
[43:10.240 --> 43:14.600]  family actually has John Wayne hanging up in their living rooms I go to my family
[43:14.600 --> 43:17.360]  in East Texas almost every house has got pictures of John Wayne hanging up
[43:17.360 --> 43:20.680]  and they're all former military veterans that's the type of people I come from
[43:20.680 --> 43:24.120]  okay well you need to understand something ladies and gentlemen that's
[43:24.120 --> 43:28.440]  who the system doesn't like because you're not gonna go along with banking
[43:28.440 --> 43:31.920]  takeovers you're not gonna go along with face scanning to buy and sell you're
[43:31.920 --> 43:35.520]  not gonna go along with gun registration and confiscation you're not gonna go
[43:35.520 --> 43:40.680]  along with you and takeovers and in le drills with foreign troops in America
[43:40.680 --> 43:48.120]  this is all admitted and so of course I've had bad feelings about these neocons
[43:48.120 --> 43:51.360]  who went along with the banker bailouts I've got them all on video promoting the
[43:51.360 --> 43:57.000]  banker bailouts two years ago now saying they were against it so Glenn Beck
[43:57.000 --> 44:02.480]  does incredibly good things every day he's the best of any of those guys he
[44:02.480 --> 44:07.040]  talks about the socialists the the communitarians he talks about agenda 21
[44:07.040 --> 44:11.560]  he talks about world government he he's getting better and better because
[44:11.560 --> 44:18.560]  you're forcing him and this radio show is forcing him to go all the way but he
[44:18.560 --> 44:28.800]  still stops short he'll do shows about the communist groups and the people
[44:28.800 --> 44:32.200]  that are doing neighborhood organizing and he'll tell you they're communist but
[44:32.200 --> 44:37.120]  he doesn't tell you that the Carnegie and Ford and Rockefeller foundations
[44:37.120 --> 44:42.040]  funded he'll tell you about Mal and for sterilization he doesn't tell you public
[44:42.040 --> 44:46.600]  treaties with the US under State Department memorandum 200 to carry it
[44:46.600 --> 44:55.040]  out and last night I was watching him taking notes and just watching him I
[44:55.040 --> 44:58.600]  have an admission to make I see the clips online and I see things and I get
[44:58.600 --> 45:01.520]  angry I get upset but I've always had a rule to not talk about other talk show
[45:01.520 --> 45:05.600]  host unless it's in a positive light I'm not here to fight with people I'm here
[45:05.600 --> 45:09.320]  to wake up listeners but when when people are put there as leaders to
[45:09.320 --> 45:12.680]  control our movement and when I know they speak out of both sides of their
[45:12.680 --> 45:17.520]  mouth and I know their teleprompters are loaded with government scripts because
[45:17.520 --> 45:25.080]  I've got the scripts from our sources I know that they are putting a worm on the
[45:25.080 --> 45:30.000]  line to drop it down in front of you so it looks tasty it looks good and I
[45:30.000 --> 45:36.600]  actually feel dirty and bad because I haven't spent the time really researching
[45:36.600 --> 45:42.440]  these guys like I should and all of my research only confirms in triplicate
[45:42.440 --> 45:48.360]  spades everything I'd already seen and heard and witnessed and not just the
[45:48.360 --> 45:52.160]  look in these people's eyes or their mannerisms I mean it just at a base
[45:52.160 --> 46:02.320]  level I'm danger will Robinson danger it makes my gut churn it makes me sends a
[46:02.320 --> 46:08.400]  shiver up my spine and I'm sitting there and he has this beautiful fancy chalk
[46:08.400 --> 46:13.080]  board with images basically of the universe like the planets and back from
[46:13.080 --> 46:18.280]  Moses to the end and they show the timeline of all the famous things in
[46:18.280 --> 46:21.560]  history that have happened all the critical junctures and I'm sitting there
[46:21.560 --> 46:25.560]  eating tacos with Rob at about 630 last night because he taped it we were
[46:25.560 --> 46:29.800]  watching the tape of it the DVR of it and we're taking notes and I said Rob
[46:29.800 --> 46:36.280]  he's gonna invoke Moses the idea is he's Moses now we found they're saying that on
[46:36.280 --> 46:43.040]  all the shows and at the end he's gonna ride on the chalkboard that his 818 is
[46:43.040 --> 46:51.240]  as important as Moses and that he is now basically Alex Jones Oprah Winfrey and
[46:51.240 --> 46:57.400]  cult leader rolled into one that's what he's doing and Rob's mouth just dropped
[46:57.400 --> 47:02.160]  when he said he's 818 and it's as big as Moses at the end I mean this is
[47:02.160 --> 47:07.720]  dangerous because he's saying all the right things and doing all this but
[47:07.720 --> 47:11.520]  literally taking over the true Liberty movement that knows the answers that
[47:11.520 --> 47:16.120]  understands the enemy this is a guy who reads off teleprompters from government
[47:16.120 --> 47:21.840]  scripts we've confirmed it and now we've basically overthrown their paradigm
[47:21.840 --> 47:25.120]  we've got people admitting rule governments real they can't deny it
[47:25.120 --> 47:29.240]  anymore so they're coming in playing the part of anti-establishment ahead of
[47:29.240 --> 47:34.680]  all of this so that when they get back into power they can control the
[47:34.680 --> 47:38.000]  situation he didn't say and repeal the Patriot Act targeting conservatives
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.040]  libertarians gun owners returning veterans it's all for you he is it
[47:42.040 --> 47:47.000]  saying stop these wars he's saying tortures good it's all this truly evil
[47:47.000 --> 47:53.160]  immoral stuff rolled into everything we're doing and I kept noticing all
[47:53.160 --> 47:58.400]  these big publications mother Jones media matters Newsweek Time New York
[47:58.400 --> 48:05.240]  Times saying Glenn Beck was ripping me off Texas Monthly anybody I guess they
[48:05.240 --> 48:09.240]  were watching him they knew I'm gonna admit I wasn't watching but maybe one
[48:09.240 --> 48:12.720]  one-hundredth I'm busy I'm reading government documents I'm researching
[48:12.720 --> 48:16.040]  eugenics I'm researching what's in the vaccines I'm researching where gold's
[48:16.040 --> 48:21.600]  gonna go I'm looking at the economy I'm trying to help my wife home school the
[48:21.600 --> 48:26.080]  children in the mornings you know I'm busy and it's so physically evil and my
[48:26.080 --> 48:30.160]  spirit cries out that danger will Robinson when I watch these people it's
[48:30.160 --> 48:33.880]  painful that I haven't been watching it well the last month or so we've been
[48:33.880 --> 48:37.520]  really deep into this I'm making a film about it and it's worse than I could have
[48:37.520 --> 48:43.920]  even said and more sophisticated now I started researching Beck's websites just
[48:43.920 --> 48:48.160]  the last three days I started researching Dick army and freedom works and you
[48:48.160 --> 48:53.080]  know what I found Glenn Beck wears a Gadsden flag shirt a lot of times on
[48:53.080 --> 48:57.080]  radio and TV under a sports jacket who started doing that three years ago me
[48:57.080 --> 49:02.400]  Glenn Beck does all my mannerisms down he's an actor he's in the actor oh he
[49:02.400 --> 49:08.880]  does that almost every episode that's something I everything we put this on
[49:08.880 --> 49:12.400]  the map in the last 15 years promoting it selling it the last five we put one
[49:12.400 --> 49:17.000]  free in every order citizen rule book about jury nullification about the new
[49:17.000 --> 49:23.740]  world order about the left-right paradigm that dick army now on all of Beck's
[49:23.740 --> 49:28.400]  sites and his put it up on screen a screenshot has put out a rule book I
[49:28.400 --> 49:35.400]  mean ladies a gentleman I'd say 40% of what Glenn Beck does I've really been
[49:35.400 --> 49:40.720]  analyzing him is Alex Jones you know how dirty I feel I've been having
[49:40.720 --> 49:46.640]  nightmares about Glenn Beck ladies and gentlemen you know how dirty I feel
[49:46.640 --> 49:51.600]  knowing my essence and my reality and the truth I'm putting out that I'm
[49:51.600 --> 49:59.080]  bonafide and real and reaching tens of millions of people exploding that that
[49:59.080 --> 50:05.480]  they've created this twisted clone who's an actor and reads off a teleprompter
[50:05.480 --> 50:10.560]  and I had two high-level Fox News people who are patriot on the inside told me
[50:10.560 --> 50:13.600]  yeah Beck doesn't want people on your show he threatens them he won't have
[50:13.600 --> 50:17.480]  him on if they go on yours and he tries to go through networks to make sure
[50:17.480 --> 50:23.480]  stations don't pick you up and he's got a team of at least five people they are
[50:23.480 --> 50:28.560]  listening right now no and I want people to imitate that's the most
[50:28.560 --> 50:31.880]  sincere form of flattery I want people to use the information I'm putting out
[50:31.880 --> 50:36.720]  but I don't want them taking it and making it a pro torture pro war pro
[50:36.720 --> 50:42.640]  tyranny pro patriot act when that's all aimed at Americans they sell you saying
[50:42.640 --> 50:48.640]  it's for foreigners I have a responsibility to stand up and say look
[50:48.640 --> 50:53.560]  you are the devil's counterfeit and I'm gonna tell you right now anybody that
[50:53.560 --> 50:58.880]  wears a skull and bones you know belt like Schwarzenegger and in back I'm

[53:56.440 --> 54:08.200]  BER KEY today folks this issue is so important I suspended my master eugenics
[54:08.200 --> 54:14.080]  film that I've been making for two years the ultimate film with all the latest
[54:14.080 --> 54:22.280]  it's incredible I suspended that until next year and I'm even having nightmares
[54:22.280 --> 54:27.680]  now to to see my evil doppelganger but again it's not just Alex Jones he's
[54:27.680 --> 54:35.880]  using Oprah Winfrey NLP brainwashing he's mixing Christianoid stuff into it
[54:35.880 --> 54:39.960]  and it's counterfeiting everything I haven't been watching I was watching
[54:39.960 --> 54:45.720]  last night it was two of my sponsors people we went out and found four and
[54:45.720 --> 54:55.160]  five years ago our actual sponsors on his show I mean it's our sponsors it's
[54:55.160 --> 55:02.720]  everything we talk about but twisted it's incredible and then they're
[55:02.720 --> 55:07.440]  promoting a citizen rulebook that says it teaches them the tactics of the left
[55:07.440 --> 55:14.680]  of Saul Alinsky how to use deception and manipulation like the communists do but
[55:14.680 --> 55:19.840]  to save America you don't you don't be evil with evil in fact put that back up
[55:19.840 --> 55:26.880]  I mean it's just everywhere everything I mean do you know what it feels like to
[55:26.880 --> 55:32.040]  want to be legitimate and real and to try to never compromise I mean none of us
[55:32.040 --> 55:35.480]  are perfect I look back on things I'm ashamed of all the time I'm not up here
[55:35.480 --> 55:39.440]  on some high horse and then just everything we do a second
[55:39.440 --> 55:48.120]  counterfeit of it but the good news is you have forced him to come a long way
[55:48.120 --> 55:54.520]  I'm just saying I don't trust him I don't trust any of these people remember
[55:54.520 --> 55:58.240]  they were telling you none of this existed just a few years ago and it's a
[55:58.240 --> 56:01.440]  big victory that we forced them to admit it all exists because they know
[56:01.440 --> 56:07.960]  America's awake and now he's talking about eugenics but he isn't telling you
[56:07.960 --> 56:12.600]  that the big banks run it and who finances it they don't go all the way
[56:12.600 --> 56:18.920]  and it's going all the way that is the key to all of this if you want to get
[56:18.920 --> 56:22.680]  the real citizens rulebook we sell them at cost at info wars.com and all
[56:22.680 --> 56:26.760]  that he own book orders we add one to it and it is we don't have $50 million
[56:26.760 --> 56:32.640]  contracts like these people do we're a small operation that reaches info
[56:32.640 --> 56:36.840]  wars.com prison planet.com reaches more than all of glenbeck sites combined we
[56:36.840 --> 56:41.360]  rush limbaugh sites added to it so now they're launching more websites that
[56:41.360 --> 56:45.840]  look just like our websites I mean it's it's frightening and I'll give back
[56:45.840 --> 56:49.560]  this yesterday he ran with a headline Bill Gates wants to kill you Bill Gates
[56:49.560 --> 56:53.600]  wants to you know kill granny for teachers and they went on to say
[56:53.600 --> 56:58.160]  they're playing the teachers off against the old people divide and conquer so I
[56:58.160 --> 57:07.640]  praise God my only issue is that in my gut and in everything I see and in Beck
[57:07.640 --> 57:15.920]  behind the scenes trying to block me glenbeck threatening people not to come
[57:15.920 --> 57:22.280]  on my show I mean he's up there trying to stop this radio show you understand
[57:22.280 --> 57:28.080]  that I'm not attacking glenbeck but he's being set up as a messianic leader to
[57:28.080 --> 57:32.840]  the point I could sit there eating a taco in the coffee room last night two
[57:32.840 --> 57:36.440]  minutes before and I looked to Rob and I said you watch he's gonna write at the
[57:36.440 --> 57:46.480]  end of that big display he has his 818 event implying he is the ultimate in
[57:46.480 --> 57:52.400]  history and then he went on and said exactly that and the issue is those
[57:52.400 --> 57:56.680]  people at 818 were great folks those are good people I could see it in their
[57:56.680 --> 58:02.080]  faces their eyes and the false left is attacking Beck so that gives him
[58:02.080 --> 58:07.440]  credibility but you have to understand they're teamed up doing this to control
[58:07.440 --> 58:14.160]  the field to control the spectrum and we've got to become sophisticated enough
[58:14.160 --> 58:17.720]  to realize this and some of you won't believe me now but three years from now
[58:17.720 --> 58:23.360]  when you got a Republican president when you've got a Republican House and
[58:23.360 --> 58:27.480]  Senate when they stage big terror attacks and when they come after the
[58:27.480 --> 58:32.040]  American people I want you to remember that I told you what happened if we're
[58:32.040 --> 58:36.000]  unable to defeat this but we may be able to avert it because we've got the

[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:19.640]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:33.760]  Alex Jones to have my statements my research my work taken by a group of
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:39.520]  people and twisted to serve their evil aims and then to have them behind the
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:51.240]  scenes trying to sabotage and block what we're doing it's outrageous and I have
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:01:00.560]  a responsibility to stand up against it and to resist it and you know in my
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.560]  flesh I'm like look I want to be successful I could compromise I could
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:08.440]  reach more people I could go along with this I could join these people I've been
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.920]  offered you know to join the system many times and and and try to work through
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:17.680]  the system no we're gaining more of stations and affiliates without selling
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.040]  out and I'm glad I never have because the truth is what matters now it's not
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:27.160]  good overall to sit there and go after these people but back when the
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.240]  Democrats were opposing Bush I said you watch when they get in power they're
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.640]  gonna be even worse they're gonna accelerate these programs I told you a
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.560]  year and a half ago in the Obama deception everything Obama would do I
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.560]  told you his approval rating would go way down I told you he'd be a one-term
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:45.080]  president unless they stage terror attacks and now what's happened and I and
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.480]  all these Democrats that hated me and got mad they're finally waking up and
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.920]  going you were right and so what matters is that I put the facts on the line now
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:58.520]  so some of you can disagree with me now but later I want you to remember what I
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:11.160]  told you I want you to be warned I want you to understand because news core is
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.760]  evil news core in their TV shows and movies promotes global government
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.720]  carbon taxes and they admit they do they promote the anti-gun agenda they
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.640]  promote the Patriot Act they promote it all and it's designed for the American
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:30.880]  people it's a bait and switch and anything they are producing or putting
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:37.360]  out is done to just color themselves enough as Patriots to sell you on going
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:40.960]  along with them same thing with Barack Obama how he pitches towards the left
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:45.000]  but there is nothing to deal with the left or the right he's a global corporate
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  puppet reading off a teleprompter it's the science of betrayal it's the science
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.520]  of getting your confidence and it's so insincere when you watch these people if
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:00.040]  you have any spiritual or psychological discernment it you could see right
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:08.640]  through it Oberman Beck all of these people they're playing a game the only
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.040]  real hatred there is that they're competing with each other and I have
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.480]  always taken the high road I'm not in competition with these people I'm in
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.360]  competition with corruption and evil that's when I'm waging war against but
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:24.120]  the system is positioning itself to control the left control the right
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:29.920]  there is a rebellion in Hollywood and in television the majority of people have
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.680]  broken the paradigm they love liberty their pro-gun anti-vaccine they know
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:41.560]  about eugenics and there's a war in Hollywood to try to suppress a huge
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:46.000]  revolt at that level so it's going on in the control left the controlled right
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.840]  it's going on in the media it's happening everywhere we're going to have to
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.680]  have courage all of us individually to stand up and to tell the truth and do
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.480]  the research it takes to understand how these sophisticated propaganda modes
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.560]  operate now we got dick Gregory civil rights icon joining us he's gone public
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:11.800]  for 9-11 truth amazing information and after he leaves us remember Bloomberg a
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.960]  month ago how every major insurance company's been caught basically stealing
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:20.320]  the insurance policies of dead veterans are disabled veterans from their
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:25.720]  families and it turns out the veterans affairs quote made a secret deal with
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:30.120]  the major insurance companies to tell the troops to sign up with these
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.800]  agreements and to trick them into steal their money veteran agency made secret
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.320]  deal over benefits that'll give you an idea who runs this they tell you core
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.160]  exit in bad for you in the Gulf they tell you the dust on 9-11 in bad for you
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.800]  they tell the troops do you in bad for him now there's been a real shift we've
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.160]  always had a corrupt government but now it practices evil like a doctor
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:57.080]  practices medicine and now Bill Gates admits the death panels are real and

[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:32.560]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:36.560]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:40.360]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.080]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:07.680]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:15.360]  GCN radio network the ruling class the social engineers are here to divide and
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:21.600]  conquer us they stage economic military and terror events like the Gulf of Tonkin
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:27.000]  to get us into Vietnam and there's no doubt that if you study the 9-11 event
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.640]  you know it's an inside job I remember the Rand Corporation PNAC with Dick
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:38.120]  Cheney and countless others saying in 2000-2001 that we need giant Pearl Harbor
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.320]  events the big to Brzezinski said the same thing we need giant terror attacks
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.600]  to sell a domestic police state and a global empire for the corporations that
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:52.680]  own America America was conquered a long time ago and if we're not honest about
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.560]  this we're not going to be able to fix it in the Democratic parties run by these
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.280]  banks the Republican parties run by these banks but somebody who have always
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:07.200]  seen who has incredible courage who I've admired frontline civil rights activists
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:14.000]  beaten arrested you know with Martin Luther King Dick Gregory and I remember
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.640]  in the 80s and the 90s he led the charge exposing CIA crack cocaine later got
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:25.120]  declassified admitted in the 1996 CIA inspector general hearings in Congress I
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.360]  watched him on c-span I was on air by then I covered on the radio and TV but
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:34.000]  they still come out in the media and say it's a conspiracy theory now on Fox News
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.920]  this is coming up later in the next hour they come on and say yeah we're growing
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:41.320]  the opium what's the big deal so they hide all this in plain view they think
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:48.200]  you're stupid and dick Gregory has now put his major gravitas out there on the
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:54.600]  line again and is on a hunger strike for a real investigation the control
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.760]  demolition of tower one two and seven and we don't just have the former German
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.820]  defense minister the number three guy in the Japanese government going public
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:06.920]  or thousands and thousands of engineers and physicists and scientists or the
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:10.640]  police on video on CNN saying get back they're gonna blow up building seven I
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:17.000]  mean it's hidden in plain view they count on you not having the courage to be
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.360]  able to admit this and if they can get away with that they'll get away with
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.840]  telling you core exits not bad for you the EPA and Obama in the gulf as people
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.560]  drop dead and get sick like they told you the dust wasn't bad for you on
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:31.080]  ground zero it's not just they don't care about you they like hurting you and
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:36.320]  then denying you medical care it's the same thing with the depleted uranium as
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:41.240]  I said before the break you've got to really get it how predatory and wicked
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:45.120]  these people are and that our children in our society has no future if we don't
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:49.600]  say no so dick Gregory joins us for the rest of the hour we're very very honored
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.720]  to have a civil rights icon on with us today and he says he's got some breaking
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.800]  news before we get into why he's going public for 9-11 truth mr. Gregory we
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.120]  salute your courage thank you my brother peace and love to you and let me say
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:09.040]  there's a whole lot of us out here they get trashed by the New York Times and
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.240]  the Washington Post but as long as there's a brother and a human being like
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:19.600]  you that lived up well we say well I can't say what you really want to say but
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.720]  New York Times can do but I've always said if I could be born over again and
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:32.080]  name myself you know that name myself conspiracy theory Gregory because I've
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.640]  always felt that my truth don't have to be validated by somebody else's ignorance
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.720]  that's right and when they use the term conspiracy theory it's a label meaning
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:44.800]  don't listen to that guy yes well the greatest conspiracy to see a lot of
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:50.440]  people think conspiracy theory just started but I go back to day one and uh
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:56.960]  and and I was about Christian okay whatever that means and it's kind of fun
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.800]  and you can go all over the world and go to red light district and you can
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:04.680]  recognize the prostitute by the demeanor but if I don't tell you I'm a Christian
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:08.920]  you don't know it got to be something wrong with that right absolutely but
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:15.880]  when I when I sit and I look at my Bible and it says that in the beginning
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:20.720]  there was one person named Adam now we are we not talking about who made you we
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.200]  not talking about you know Buddha Muhammad of Christ this is one person
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.840]  created by the same force that creates universe and one day he said to God I am
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:36.040]  lonely and when God didn't say shut up you can't be lonely ain't nobody here but
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:42.160]  you and that's when the conspiracy theory started once we let him get by with
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:46.760]  that and then they told me they were killed in which he was on Friday so I
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:50.320]  want you to call it a good day so I call it a good Friday and don't have no
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:57.120]  problem with that so last night our story broke out of Memphis yesterday I
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:02.000]  didn't get it till late and I've been up all night calling folks with great
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  joy and to to announce last night and for those of you that's listening and
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:13.520]  let me say to you money is not power education is not power but
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:18.680]  information is power and if I give you bad information you have bad power and
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:24.400]  that's what America you know it wasn't that America started off it's always
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.120]  hammered it like that we just beginning to see it now because of people like you
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:34.200]  and people who's willing to lay their life on the line to say hey this is what
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:40.040]  this is all about now we got a hard job to do because if you look at the stats
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:46.760]  America is one-sixth of the world's population but we consume 94% of the
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:52.160]  world's hard drugs that's not counting alcohol nicotine and caffeine so we
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:59.560]  realize what we what we got to work with it is totally insane and crazy and so
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:04.960]  again I say thanks to you the story that broke it was the African-American one
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:10.360]  off there was a Negro man in the early days of the civil rights movement use
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:14.960]  the photographer and I've tell those you won't listen that that that that
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:20.880]  participate in Google look this up so when you get off the finish to show the
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:29.360]  message the number one morning paper in the message the message appeal it the
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:36.960]  guy's name is Ernie Webber he have been documenting the civil rights movement
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:41.720]  he's respected all over the world and the story that broke yesterday is
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:48.600]  photographer Ernie Webber doubled at FBI informants to spy on the civil rights
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:55.200]  movement so when you think about the people that have died the people who
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.640]  have been framed the people have gone to jail and you look back at this human
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:05.720]  being now he is more more bothered than that here's when they asked Andy young
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:11.840]  about it and the young who was one of King's trumpet lieutenant and the young
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:22.120]  said that Andy they quote Andy now 78 said it isn't bothering that with us
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:29.720]  secretly work as an informant with sniping the civil with picking civil
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:36.360]  rights movement I always liked him he was a good photographer and then he said
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:42.400]  what's wrong with a brother making some extra money I don't think Dr. King would
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:50.360]  have mine him making a little money on the side now let me tell you if the
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:57.640]  two-clock plan said that huh or a white conservative Republican said that
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:05.160]  decent people would be out of their mind but a thug like Andy young can say that
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:11.240]  with admiration that's like somebody said oh it was a good photographer and so
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:16.880]  again when you look at this and and I've called my researches we think well
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:21.480]  they're telling us that that being a betrayer being a Judas Iscariot being a
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:27.600]  Benedict Arnold being a spy is a good thing and that you should be proud of
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:33.240]  being treacherous I mean it's just like they tell us torture is good or preemptive
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:39.480]  wars are good they're selling us pure evil and now exercising evil out on the
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.640]  open like they come out and say yeah we're growing the opium yeah we're
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.600]  shipping the drugs in yeah we put out fake bin Laden videos I mean the CIA came
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:52.600]  out and they're just training us to accept pure evil you know when you have
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.560]  somebody answer a question like that it sounds like they cover me for the day
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:05.720]  when Dads will come out okay there's no way the number one assassin in the
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:12.280]  history of planet Earth was the king and I say that because of the news media
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:16.840]  there's many fascinates but nobody got to see them with your eyes and here's the
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:23.600]  man that's part of that next to one of his close advisors is a photographer that
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.680]  was more than a photographer he was trusted he fit in the room he was given
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:33.680]  who all the plans what was gonna happen when it was gonna happen and he was
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:38.200]  heavily involved in the last day of King's life this is incredible so you're
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:41.840]  saying the is that the same photographer that took the famous shots of Jesse
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:47.400]  Jackson pointing yes yes that guy was a federal informant and we know the
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:52.760]  government was involved in killing Martin Luther King this is incredible it's
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:57.560]  it you know when you stop and pick with it is what else is incredible if you go
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.840]  back you remember that famous shot right yes now think about if you and I
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:08.120]  stand on the balcony and a shot come out are we gonna hit the ground yes because
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:12.800]  we don't know if there's gonna be another shot right yes so why was that group
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.680]  standing up pointing up the wrong direction when the shot really came
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.840]  from the ground unless and they knew it wasn't gonna be another shot well that's
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:27.360]  the word I've gotten about well there's been some questions about Mr. Jackson
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.000]  there's been a lot of questions about Jackson there's been a lot of questions
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.840]  about a whole lot of people when you read this article there started being
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:38.800]  questions about Benjamin Hooks there started being questions about a whole
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.360]  lot of people in that movement nobody ever suspected because let me tell you
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:50.040]  how I get tricked I grew up in the Baptist church okay I grew up seeing
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:55.120]  pictures of Judas and Judas they told me when I was a little boy Judas betrayed
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:59.960]  Jesus Christ and Judas always had his strings look on his face so when you see
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:03.640]  that there's a little boy you say anybody that's working as a perform
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:11.960]  informant you can tell this guy was so kind and peaceful and loving and so now
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:17.280]  the whole Judas thing Judas has a new face now and so when you stop and think
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:22.320]  about and when you when you read that article you will see a whole lot of
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:27.440]  folks that they asked questions to be invaded if it is what happened yeah
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:30.520]  you're saying a lot of other inner people are acting suspicious and saying
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:34.160]  hey there's no big deal being a federal informant and as you're saying that
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:40.160]  shows that the evidence is they don't feel guilty because they did it to Mr.
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:44.560]  Gregory stay there now we've got a quick break coming up I want to finish up

[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:08.400]  honor to have you I want to get you back up soon now that I know you like the
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.800]  work we're doing and are familiar with it but but I do want to start getting
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:16.680]  into your 9-11 hunger strike and that whole giant issue but but but any other
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.280]  points you want to make about his chief photographer now it being admitted that
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.200]  there it is photographer Ernest Weathers doubled as FBI informant to spy on
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:29.480]  civil rights movement he provided agency with insider view a volatile period and
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:35.760]  they spend the whole filthy article like this is a good thing but train a a a
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.480]  serious leader who put his life on the line who gave speeches in the month
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.720]  before saying he knew he was gonna be going home soon a man who put his you
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.560]  know he said whatever you want about Martin Luther King he had courage just
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:49.480]  like the hotbed Gandhi and they killed him better than a hammer and the
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:52.520]  evidence is clear and James Earl Ray admitted it was all a setup please
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:59.160]  continue and so what we're looking at now is when you look at September the 11
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:05.160]  the reason this is different when you look at all the other fascination before
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:10.960]  Kennedy was killed did you have a show no I didn't okay so there was nobody out
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:18.200]  here that had looked at it when when when when Martin was killed all at once
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.880]  now when September the 11th you got folks out here let me tell you I'm the
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:27.760]  one released the pictures with Ron Brown who was Secretary of Commerce and and
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.840]  you were the guy that made them admit they called you conspiracy theorist that
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:36.240]  the head coroner at the Air Force a colonel said he had a bullet hole in his
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.200]  head and others did we know they had special forces on board they killed
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.360]  everybody blew the hatch and he load out go ahead well here's what happened
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:48.000]  they couldn't deny it because the people that did the autopsy brought the pictures
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.920]  to me that's right so I'm saying we have outlets now but let me just take you one
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:58.080]  thing if your mother lives yes all right if you walked in the house and your
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:02.240]  mother was on the phone and you say what you tell me she said just dial 9-1-1
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:07.160]  but what kind of look do you think he would have on your face shock all right
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:15.680]  anytime you say 9-1-1 that tells the brain to be scared so of course they
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:20.400]  picked 9-11 as a scion and as a calling card that's right but remember in
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:26.640]  America we never used a number for the month we say Halloween is October 31st
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:33.320]  Christmas is December 25th we use a number for the first time because they
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:37.560]  have done the research and know every time you say that what happens and the
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:44.000]  subconscious message exactly is is double-fold you call 9-1-1 for help but
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.920]  the 9-1-1 is the government's number and that's why Fox TV six months before put
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.680]  out an episode where the government runs a drill so the rest of the government
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:56.240]  stands down to fly a hijacked jet by remote control into the World Trade
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:01.080]  Center to then blame it on Afghanistan psychology shows that serial killers
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:09.080]  like to play games and let you know what they're doing because you know so much
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:17.800]  about the news media if you was working for NBC right and on September the
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:24.120]  level you witness you the one that had the video camera that took that second
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:30.920]  building being hit right you know you would want to pull a surprise okay your
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:37.320]  word your name would be world renowned and you would get $40,000 speech how come
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:42.360]  we don't know who took that picture huh how come one of the most famous pictures
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.120]  in the history of the planet how come nobody knows the name of the person that
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:53.040]  took that picture and so and so you see they don't come on folks like us like you
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:57.040]  and people see there's a lot of people that know things but they never had
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:03.040]  nobody to call I know what you do I know how many people call you I know you
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:06.320]  have to sit through you and have fantastic reasons because the government
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:11.200]  will give you tips to throw everybody off and so you have to look through it
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:17.840]  and say wow okay and so consequently if you look at the fire station which is a
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:23.760]  block and a half away from the World Trade Bill and and that that day there
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:31.400]  was 343 five fighters that died hold on dick Gregory long segment coming up

[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:52.040]  really glad we got him on the show because i've always liked dick gregory
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:55.240]  um i know that much of the black leadership or a bunch of paid-off
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:58.520]  foundation eugenicists who've done their job to make sure 51 percent of blacks
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:01.720]  haven't been born since 1973 and i want to bring that up with him
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:05.480]  before he leaves us today because see i look at a child a black child a white
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:08.760]  child a spanish child an asian child i may not like
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:11.400]  racists that are in all their groups that don't like me because of the color of my
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:15.240]  skin but i love those children ladies and gentlemen
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.880]  and let me tell you something i think about all those millions of dead black
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:21.400]  babies every day but a side issue that it's big
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.880]  though and i want to raise that later i want to tell you about a few sponsors
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:26.840]  that made today's show possible i love this new sponsor
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:30.280]  and i'm using it in my own home we don't watch a lot of television
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:33.240]  mainly you know dvds like we're not even really hooked up to television we have to
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:37.400]  put the rabbit ears on but it's so hard to program a tv with all the adult
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.840]  channels that it doesn't seem to work well this will do that very easily
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:45.320]  and it's a power cop where the plug just goes into this little easy to use box it's
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:48.200]  like a clock radio i mean i'm not very technical and i
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:51.720]  know how to use it easily we tested it out we got it about three months ago and
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:55.240]  now i approved it and it's a sponsor i have to prove each sponsor we say no to
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:58.120]  more than 80 of the sponsors that come to us
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:00.600]  so it makes it tough to fund our operation because we only promote things
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:04.120]  that i believe in but parents are your kids wasting away
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:08.840]  hours and hours watching tv or playing computer and video games

[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:21.320]  easy to use programmable device which limits the amount of time
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.280]  you allow them to use each day so you don't have to watch them you can say if
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:27.720]  you do all your chores and stuff you get one hour of video games every two days
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:32.440]  or one hour of tv the power cop is an easy to use programmable device
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:35.400]  which limits the amount of time they can watch childhood obesity is on the rise

[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:41.400]  going back to dick greggory civil rights icon uh let's get in
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:45.160]  continue with 9 11 uh your years of research
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:48.840]  your main issues why you're going on the hunger strike
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:52.840]  uh dick greggory you've got the floor break it down now we what we left off
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:57.800]  was there was 343 firefighters that died that day
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:02.520]  not counting the one that was injured so if you look at
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:06.520]  the fire station the company that was
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:11.400]  an hour or was one one and a half blocks from the world trade center
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:14.520]  so when they looked at the world trade center
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:18.840]  because of the insurance company there's 54 000 people that worked in that
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.200]  building and so when you stop and think about
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:27.800]  with with in the course of a day 130 000 people would come in that building
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:33.000]  not counting the workers so if you're a smoke detector the
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.320]  battery blow out at home you go get another one but because of the insurance
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:41.160]  in the world trade building you uh you can't just go get one
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:45.320]  you have to call the fire department and that company right around the corner
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:49.960]  would bring and come and pick it and then they send you a bill
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:55.640]  that company would go a minimum of 50 times a day to the world trade building
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:02.280]  a maximum of 75 times a day every day the day of september 11
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:08.680]  not one firefighter from company seven a block and a half was killed or injured
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:11.960]  now somebody got to say wait a minute if somebody knows something
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:17.960]  all these firefighters come in and we got 343 killed not common and not one
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.440]  killed the injured and a fire station or block away so when you start looking at
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:26.760]  all of these things that hang out too
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.240]  that building was was was built really about the Rockefeller was when
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:36.520]  Nelson Rockefeller was governor you see that area was the only area since the
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:42.120]  depression that was an economic disaster so
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:45.720]  Rockefeller decided when he was governor he would
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:51.720]  ram a bill through to float bonds to build it so he put it through the
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.640]  bonds came out of his brother's bank which was the Rocksville bank to
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:59.000]  chase Manhattan so they built it and it was
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.920]  like a a white elephant it couldn't take off
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:07.320]  so because of Rockefeller's power and influence in the republican party
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:12.840]  and in america they got every agency every agency in
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:16.920]  washington dc especially than just to rent office
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:22.120]  states that's how they feel that building up and so consequently the
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:27.400]  reasons the poor authority cops guarded a lot of poor authority cops got killed
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:31.880]  let me tell you if there's a bombing today at the empire state building the
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:35.640]  poor authority cops have no jurisdiction over that
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:39.720]  because that's not a state building now think about
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:45.960]  when that building was blown up it had been sold
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:50.680]  leased which is sold now think about that nobody's talking about
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:57.560]  if you have a world trade building that is owned and financed by tax money
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:01.960]  in the state then how are you going to leave it or sell it to somebody
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.720]  without having a bid how are you going to leave it or sell it to somebody
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.720]  without anybody knowing this transition that happened and so when they took
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:13.800]  silver and and and let him leave it for 99 years
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:19.560]  that means that the federal government now has no jurisdiction over it so why
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:23.000]  was the poor authority still guarding that building
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.920]  well they were also running a drill that day of tripod two
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.840]  of the towers being attacked so they were using that to make everybody stand
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:33.240]  down they also went on the loudspeakers and told
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:36.520]  everybody stay at their desk because they needed somebody to get killed that
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:41.160]  day this is all on record that's right and and so and so when you stop and
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:45.080]  look and see it's a funny thing everybody thinks of you know
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:50.120]  that Fox News is right and CNN is let me tell you at the top
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:54.280]  all of it is the same how come you don't hear nobody on Fox News talking about
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:57.240]  the federal reserve how come you don't hear nobody saying what
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:01.000]  you just said is the New York Times and Fox News
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.640]  and they that much dumber than us when Kennedy
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:09.960]  was was shot his car turned down Elm Street
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:13.960]  that car was not supposed to go down Elm Street that the station was made
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:18.760]  a week before now and then if that car wasn't supposed to go on Elm Street
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:23.000]  how does he have the odds well you know to get a job there
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.680]  if it wasn't coming there so when you just look at the small pieces
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.440]  and you turn around the big mystery to me is
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:36.680]  with 54,000 people working in that building and we know 3,000 plus was
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:40.760]  killed next amount went to the hospital you got 40 some
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:44.920]  thousand people that got away how come nobody's never interviewed one of them
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:48.680]  how come they don't stay well on the fifth anniversary
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:52.040]  we're gonna bring the winners who beat it we got
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:57.640]  40,000 people that got away how come we don't put them in a big football arena
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:01.400]  how come there's such a mystery around the one that got away
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:04.680]  how come most Americans say building seven
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:09.160]  what's that and the news announced it had fallen in its own footprint an hour
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:13.080]  before 25 minutes before they said it's fallen from fires in its own
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:16.440]  footprint a total collapse that had never happened in history
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:19.400]  happened three times that day and we have the footage
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:22.920]  multiple newscasts police say and get back they're blowing it up
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:27.320]  I mean and that building was FBI CIA port authority
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:30.760]  that was their command base that was the command base and that didn't happen
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:35.240]  until 5 20 that evening if that's not a scary you know
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:39.000]  we look at the top two buildings that and let me tell you something else
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:46.200]  that you can pull up and look the next day that was on the 1112
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:53.160]  on Wednesday the San Francisco Chronicle around the front page story
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:56.920]  where mayor woolly brown of San Francisco
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:01.240]  had been warned not to take that Tuesday morning flight
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:06.840]  into new york now at the time nobody said who won and we know not what kind of
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:09.960]  leads are right now that was a front page story
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:13.480]  do you know no other paper ever ran that story
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:17.640]  now you go back to that Friday which would have been
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:22.040]  uh the 14th they had another front page story
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:27.640]  in the San Francisco Chronicle that said that ex-Secretary of State George
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:32.040]  Schilt had been he had received information on
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:37.560]  September the 4th that no September the 7th that that
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:41.160]  dealman was going to go and nobody ran here that the
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:44.920]  Secretary of State said yes I had information
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:48.440]  front page story in San Francisco Chronicle and
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:53.480]  no other paper picked that up you have you have put options and call
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:55.800]  options not my grandmother wouldn't know what that is
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:59.480]  that means that today you and I can bet
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:03.480]  that we believe that that fears and robux start going to go up
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:07.800]  and we can put 30 million dollars if it goes down we lose it if it go up
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:14.280]  we we got a gravy train on the day of September the 11th
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:20.760]  there was 6400 people that had bet the day before
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:25.160]  that the united airlines stopped we'd go down
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:30.040]  there was six thousand some people it was triple it was triple the previous
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:35.160]  record put option not just on airlines but against american and united
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.640]  specifically and then it came out in german papers
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:40.920]  buzzy cron guard executive director of the cia
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:44.840]  his firm had made the majority of the bets
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:48.840]  well here's the problem in order for you to make a bet they have to know who you
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:52.520]  are so they can pay you off if you win i know who to collect it from if you lose
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:57.720]  right yes sir how come nobody's ever brought those folks in
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:01.400]  for a hearing to find out the other thing is
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:05.160]  in your in your home state wouldn't that when that
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:09.720]  uh... what am i trying to say the astronaut when they rocked it blew up
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:14.280]  over texas remember that yes and they were announcing if anybody take
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.920]  anything away from the crime scene after selling
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.600]  because this is an open crime scene and yet
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:25.720]  here's september the 11th they took all of the debris
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:29.160]  they carried it to a little mafia place in book when that's what was doing the
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:33.000]  haul and put it on board and then shipped it to china
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.080]  and nobody's been invited for anything with a crime scene
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:41.320]  so when you stop and think about you know how they do it
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:45.480]  and all of the papers we choose side this is a good paper that's right none of
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.080]  them but let's not forget who ran security on the world trade center
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.760]  marvin bush's company but it's but his contract ended
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:57.640]  september 10th but let's go further newsweek an ap reported bush signed the
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:02.280]  launch order to attack afghanistan september 10th
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:07.240]  and they attacked cobble the night of the attack how did he have the aircraft
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:10.600]  carriers two months before ready how do you have 44 000 u.s.
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:14.360]  troops to jica standish big stand how do you have his brother declare martial
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:18.360]  law in florida the day before yep i mean when you stop and think about
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:23.240]  you know it's so open and plain but then i go back to what i said before
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:28.440]  when you have a nation that one six of the world's population
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:33.640]  but consumes 94% of the world's drugs that's not called
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:38.040]  count alcohol nicotine and caffeine and let me tell you something else brother
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:41.960]  every 30 seconds you and i've been talking a woman in america had been
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:45.400]  beat up by her boyfriend her husband but not no no
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:50.120]  taliban so when you stop and think about this country we call america the
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:52.600]  beautiful there's a whole lot of things have to
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:55.960]  happen before this country gets back to be the beautiful country
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:00.200]  that we want to it's become america the the babel on
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.800]  yes yes well i put it better one than that
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:07.480]  you know you know the story of thomas and go ball right yes
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:11.560]  if this god do something to america quick and god or
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:15.800]  serious apology to thomas and go ball
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:20.600]  so somewhere we're not now here's what i i'm looking at this
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.640]  and i'm saying oh god when you take when you take those
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:27.400]  listen we spend trillions of dollars a month
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:30.840]  for security and you tell me some snotty nose
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:34.680]  punk blue blue blue blue dudes from foreign
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:38.680]  country that can't speak english most of them never been to college
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:43.080]  can slip in it's just like like the mexicans coming across the border look
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:46.040]  if you got mexicans come off the border can't read or write
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:50.440]  never been to school if they can get across that border will what is the kgp
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:54.200]  doing what is printing cowardice and print they're not doing nothing
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:57.880]  because we're not going to permit them to come across so when you see these
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:01.160]  folks coming across the border they're not coming across
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:04.760]  because they love america they're coming across because they're coming over
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:08.520]  here to get jobs and if i came to austin texas that they
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:13.400]  opened up a liquor store and only sold liquor to 13 year old
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.400]  children and down if you're 13 and nine you can buy whiskey
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:21.960]  if you are caught you don't come in arrest the children
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:25.400]  you arrest me so why are we going to mess
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:29.400]  arrest the mexicans coming over the border instead of arresting the people
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:32.920]  that's luring them over with jobs and you do that very simple
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:38.920]  if your company gets caught hiring illegals you lose the right to do business
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:42.280]  for 30 days but they don't want to stop it because they want to drive down the
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:45.960]  wages uh i know that but i'm saying to american people
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:49.960]  american people is bitter with the folks that's coming through for the jobs
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:54.840]  instead of being bitter it's a funny thing about american mentality
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:59.720]  we will always attack the underdog do you know how many people i speak to man
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:04.760]  it's fighting for your life oh man look can you please he's taking on this and
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:09.720]  he's taking on that one person with courage has always been the majority
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:13.720]  and so consequently when you stop and think about it see you too close to
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:19.160]  understand your influence i'm out here i try to do 250 days a year i travel
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:24.200]  24 hours a day and your name keeps coming up and i heard this here and see
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:28.040]  it's kind of interesting when i go to a doctor i trust
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:31.880]  that i thought my headache was a headache and then you tell me it's a brain
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:35.320]  tumor i don't need no second opinion i trust you
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:40.280]  well that's the way people feel about you close this country they trust you and
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:44.840]  so people who don't have the research and the finances to do the research
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:49.080]  they pick it up and they know and then they they promote it to their mother
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:53.320]  to their friends to their children and so and well let me ask you this question
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:57.720]  i've now discovered from insiders that glenn beck is taking what oprah
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:02.840]  wimfrey does and what i do and he has a team that fuses it together
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:07.160]  and then puts a pro torture pro war pro patriot act on it
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:12.360]  and he's now copying but twisting what do i do about that because i feel dirty
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:16.280]  that that that that that my message that i mean to be good and pure
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:20.360]  is being turned into a counterfeit well let me tell you this here
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:24.920]  let's say you own your motor's right can i go buy me a Cadillac and use it to
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:29.240]  pick up a bank in the damn thing you can do about it
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:33.560]  i bet you're not making it for me to pick up banks but when i buy it i gotta
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:39.400]  write to pick up use it as a getaway car and so it just makes us smarter
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:43.720]  and flicker and hipper and so there's nothing you can do about it
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:46.920]  but you see all of this will be exposed
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:50.600]  this is this look look look well dick stay there uh dick gregory's our guest

[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.680]  ron brown i mean after dick gregory exposed it in the
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:29.000]  colonel leaked him the photos i mean they shot those guys in the head and
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.200]  blew the hatch and special forces put on their mask and
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:36.200]  and then they remote controlled it into a mountainside over in Serbia
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:40.920]  and they killed him he said if i go down clinton's going down they said you die
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:43.960]  and they kill that whole group of ceo's on board that plane
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:47.960]  they're not playing games just like they're stealing the death benefits of
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.960]  the dead troops bloomberg just like they're telling you du's good for the
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:55.480]  troops i mean these are some cold hardcore killers people say well why are
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:58.040]  you still alive well they may end up killing me someday
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:01.240]  but the point is they know that'll make my message that much stronger
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:04.360]  uh and they can't kill us all back when they killed martin luther king or
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:08.040]  kennedy we didn't have an internet we didn't have tens of millions of people
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:10.280]  away we didn't have people coming together
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:13.400]  dick gregory getting into black leadership because you've been there
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:17.400]  from the very beginning as a true leader standing up against the oppression
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:19.720]  you know the modern slavery that was still going on
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:24.680]  jim crow all of it but then i look at margaret sanger i've done deep research
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:27.160]  actually sent off to the universities and got the actual letters
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:30.600]  not just stuff on the internet where she said look we got to kill these these
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:35.400]  subhuman weeds and we've got to pose as liberals we got to hire black leaders
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:39.640]  we got to pose as liberals uh and and and we're going to get these people
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:43.400]  and they have i mean 51 of black people that would have existed
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:47.720]  after 1973 don't exist and that's why it's good that glenn beck
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:51.880]  you know had one of the nieces of uh martin luther king up there speaking
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:55.320]  about that it's good that he's starting to be forced to cover
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:58.360]  that so i don't it's just that i know what's behind it it's just to get our
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:01.400]  trust here but i mean but i mean a brief segment but
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:05.320]  speaking about the black leadership the fake leadership before we go into that
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:07.560]  let me just finish up my step from 11 p
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:12.120]  oh go ahead sir sorry yeah i'm ranting i decided
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:17.800]  of looking at the five fighters and the first responders running into a
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:21.800]  building when everybody else was running out and it's looking at
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:27.240]  this 900 first responders have died because of what was in the air
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:32.200]  and nobody give a damn so i decided this september
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:35.560]  the 11th that i was going to go on a
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:39.560]  france my birthday is october the 12th 1932
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:46.760]  so i'll be 78 this year in two years i will be 80 so i decided
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:50.680]  that as of right now i'm eating no more solid food
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:57.240]  until my 80th birthday and saddened and praying and asking people around the
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:01.560]  world at 12 noon every day at your time just
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:07.320]  tune in to a meditation or prayer that the truth will come out not the folks
[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:11.800]  that believe the truth is out then why not pray pray that the truth will come
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:14.760]  out those of us that know what the truth is
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:18.840]  you'd be surprised you think these folks can mess with this they can do this but
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:23.560]  the one thing they can't do on a clear night look up at the big dipper
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:28.200]  and the milky way they can't mess with that and the same force to put the
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:31.080]  milky way in the big dip in the universe together
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:35.800]  put us together and when you tune in to that type of power
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:39.720]  the rest of the folks just chomp stuff and so that's why
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:43.800]  somebody asked me the day on the radio show you've been fasting for 40 years
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:49.560]  where your doctor they might not have been dead 30 years experience and so again
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:53.960]  again that's one person and let me tell you that
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:58.280]  what we're doing was the last time but new york time get a front page story on you
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:01.800]  no they've never done it when it was the last time you had to cover
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:08.680]  the parade magazine never all right i think that they did when the universe
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:14.040]  picked you it leaves no footprint it tells you you don't have to be validated
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:17.880]  by the washington post of the new york time or mbc
[01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:23.720]  i've got you back brother i have validated you and that's all that comes
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:26.840]  and let me tell you the effect that we have
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:31.240]  see we look at things and sometimes we don't know what it means look

[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:41.000]  kill me i'll look at this you'll pretend people
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.920]  i mean you just said that the mathematics is not right and so what i said
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:48.200]  earlier i asked you and i'll ask you again
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:51.880]  have you have been on the the cover of time magazine no
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:57.800]  have you been on the front page of of of the new york times no okay the
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:03.720]  universe says when i pick you i'm the universe i'm the same
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:07.720]  one that put the whole unit when i picked you to do my work
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:12.760]  i leave no footprint you don't have to be validated by the new york times
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:18.440]  or the washington post or mbc when the universe picked you that's the ultimate
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:22.040]  and when you look at let me just stay way too close to this
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:25.560]  you know have you ever bit your tongue out have ever one
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:29.080]  you ever bit your tongue yes you know how bad that hurt right
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:32.920]  yes do you realize being young white children
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:36.040]  is picking their tongue out running five and six
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:39.960]  moves through their tongue and they're not using pain killer
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:43.000]  and we so busy laughing at them and thinking they're crazy
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.560]  there's a universal law when you start inflicting pain on yourself huh
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:52.440]  and you better watch out because something's gonna happen
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:55.800]  and if you do the quick research those of you just listening
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:59.960]  and find out why the chinese hate the japanese so bad
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:05.880]  because when the japanese invaded china in 1933 they gave the army
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:08.600]  instructions don't mess with the leaders
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:13.560]  find every young chinese male with a tattoo on their body and blow their
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:17.320]  brains out because tattoos represent revolution
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:20.920]  okay and so what i'm saying to you when i was a little boy
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:25.000]  if i saw somebody with a tattoo you knew he was in the presence of a
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.440]  child okay now and finally then we get back to your
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:32.600]  your question you asked a butterfly that little precious
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:37.400]  beautiful butterfly can fly all the way across the atlantic ocean
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:40.040]  can fly all the way across the pacific ocean
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:44.200]  but the bald eagle can't make that trip so don't let nobody
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:47.960]  lead you to believe because i got a mighty army
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:52.600]  and the cia that i control everything that they bigger
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:57.240]  than you that is a game they play you take a welfare mother
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:00.200]  that's pregnant she can't read or write
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:03.720]  when nine months pregnant it's over they don't have
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:08.360]  all the armies in the world that can come together and keep that baby in her
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:12.600]  you see revolution is nothing but an extensional evolution
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:16.200]  evolution is a gradual nature natureistic change
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:20.120]  that when it leads into revolution that's quick change and that happens
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:23.960]  when a mother give birth when an animal give birth and what you're doing and
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:27.320]  people like you that have radio shows like this here
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:31.240]  you you've given the folks that sit there waiting on that just patient that

[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:38.280]  them something that they can look at people can turn in and listen to this
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:42.760]  show and then go back and explain it to people the hardest thing in the world
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:46.280]  is when the cia and each dog have control
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:50.600]  and there's no other voice they can hear they damn right they start making sense
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:53.320]  they make well that's why they want to start shutting the web down

[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:53.880]  issue and i talk about this almost every day
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:55.960]  i'm not bringing this up because you're a black man
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:59.480]  yes but but but i've studied the globalist and they admit
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:03.800]  they beta test things on disenfranchised people that can't fight back
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:07.800]  sure and i go back to the eugenics development in the us about 90 years ago
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:09.800]  and they said we're going to test it out on these people
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:13.080]  hold on how many years ago about 90 years ago
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:15.880]  okay you are you know why i'm glad you said that
[02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:20.040]  why what hitler was doing with eugenics eugenics
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:25.400]  was created at the university of virginia hitler we use in our book
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:30.520]  yes that that was his blueprint for what he was doing come off the university of
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:34.440]  virginia eugenics and they had it all put together and
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:38.680]  said here's how we're gonna do it now if you if you go
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:42.840]  ebony magazine with dick gregory said you know
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:47.480]  birth control is genocide okay now i didn't just get on this bandwagon
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:51.800]  you know saying see i'm not like the king girl who a bunch of conservatives
[02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:55.720]  went over and they needed a black boy to sit here
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:10:00.040]  and he said here's here's how we're going to finance this let me tell you
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:04.600]  i'm a black man with 10 children i've been knowing for years
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:10.520]  for every 10 white babies that's born three of them die at birth
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:14.600]  for every 10 black babies that's born i'm going back now
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:19.480]  50 years ago for every 10 white babies that was born
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:22.920]  50 years ago three of them died birth for every 10
[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:27.320]  black babies that's born in america seven died birth
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:30.520]  so it didn't take too much mathematics to figure out
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:35.560]  if this system can get me on the same birth schedule as a white woman
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:42.040]  they're wiping me out okay and that's when i said this is genocide
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:45.800]  they know it my grandmother didn't know it a whole lot of people want to have
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:49.080]  sex don't want to get people pregnant now let me just tell you
[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:54.600]  how how corrupt i am i think somebody called me one day from
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:57.960]  canada and you know and they said we'd like to
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:05.240]  to bring you here uh 20 thousand dollars for uh the father of the year award
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:09.640]  i said well i don't qualify okay he explained to me it wasn't a joke i
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:13.800]  didn't know i don't qualify to say listen to me and listen to me good
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:19.640]  i have 10 black children which means the universal god
[02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:27.080]  had gave me the right to create 10 of a god it didn't ask me what color was i
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:30.520]  it didn't ask me did i have any money it didn't ask me
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:34.760]  could i read or write it says you have the ability
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:40.680]  to create another you now 10 times the problem is
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:45.320]  i never had an affair with my wife to create new life man
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:48.440]  i was just enjoying myself now what's wrong with that
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:51.480]  i never bought a car that i didn't know the year
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:58.040]  the make the down payment the monthly notes the insurance and the trade in
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:04.600]  value now when i did Gregory got to look myself in the face
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:08.920]  and realized i put more planning into owning a damn
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:14.840]  car than creating god's new life hey man i'm the problem don't look past me
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:18.040]  every time i get on the plane and travel anywhere in the world
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:21.880]  for a peace rally i pay tax money on my ticket
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:27.080]  which they use to buy bombs and munitions to kill children and old folks all
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:32.120]  over the world so when the bombs drop on my grandchildren i say god just give me
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:35.880]  the wisdom and the strength to understand his payback time
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:39.640]  this is what this is about but i'm just glad that on this
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:43.480]  i feel i grew up man and i was born 1952
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:47.720]  i'll be 60 i mean 32 when i go to the movie and see john Wayne man
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:52.040]  that's what i wanted to be like when john Wayne said he's you writing they wrong
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:55.320]  get your gun and kill him it's until i bumped into this
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:59.240]  movement that told me it's not about killing
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:02.120]  it's not about this man i couldn't wait to get in the army
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:05.800]  so i could kill me somebody and let me just tell you something right now
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:09.000]  if they if what you're talking about the veterans how they treat them let me tell
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.480]  you america something anytime you can wave your flag
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:17.080]  to get your young men and women to the front line of battle
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:21.080]  but can't wave that flag when they come back to see that they get the
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:24.520]  care that's not a flag you waving that's a rite
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:28.680]  and as soon as you find out about it the better off everybody's want to be
[02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:32.440]  i'm so damn sick and tired of the people that manufacture the munitions
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:35.880]  and all the ones that make the money on war who don't spend none of they love
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:40.120]  one they want the profit one day when the decent
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:43.960]  people move into a position we'll say this
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:48.440]  anybody that make more war materials you can't make no more money
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:53.240]  than 10 percent more during wartime than you make during peacetime
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:57.000]  and the profits will go to the people who fight the war
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.800]  the profits when you got when you got a superbowl
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:04.600]  the winner shares in the benefits and that's what we need to do
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:08.680]  with wartime so somewhere when you stop and think about
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:11.800]  you know america will be a great nation one day
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:16.200]  but it haven't been and the reason migros was not able to play
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:20.120]  professional baseball for years because of this
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:24.760]  when up when the people start coming from europe to here the irish capital had
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:28.200]  to live in the irish catholic neighborhood you know we talk about
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:31.960]  the religion how crazy it is now i remember the time in boston
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:35.000]  you wouldn't dare say you was irish catholic in a certain area
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.400]  it would be stumped when when the jews came over and then see we forget the
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:43.480]  marmons because they rich we forget what happened to smithing them
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:47.160]  the marmons wasn't created in utah it was in
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:51.800]  elinor and the christians ran them out killing them and the reason they're
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:56.120]  alive today they ran in the utah and the christians say i'm a christian
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:58.600]  they all leave me alone ain't nothing there they didn't know nothing about
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:02.520]  minerals and research so we we stop and think about how
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:06.280]  vicious we have been down through the years and those of you
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:08.920]  when i listen to people talk about september 11 they go from the inner
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:13.640]  resident tell them they didn't wipe out towers they wiped out whole villages
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:19.080]  well mr. gregory we're almost out of time but but specifically though on the
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:21.720]  issue of eugenics you're absolutely right
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:25.400]  uh that that more than half the black people since roe v wade that
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:29.160]  that are conceived or never born but we don't see
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:33.160]  anybody jesse jackson or any of these people
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:36.600]  ever talking about it i don't hear the n double acp talking about it you know
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:40.440]  the cops kill the black youth sometimes because they had to sometimes
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:43.720]  because they're you know the police are out of control
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:48.120]  there's a huge big event about it but then if i was a black leader
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:51.480]  i mean i'm just a human so i'm warning black folks about this but i'm
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:53.880]  warning everybody because it's happening to everyone but it's specifically
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:57.640]  targeting blacks i mean why don't i see more black leaders talking
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:00.120]  about that wait a minute wait let me back up a minute
[02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:04.280]  when you see uh lv the king right yes all right
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:07.960]  have you ever read about her in the new york times
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:11.480]  um i don't read the new york times a lot but well
[02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:14.600]  have you ever seen it on mbc
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:18.520]  what i'm saying is there's a whole lot of black people out there doing stuff
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:21.560]  if it don't run into paper that white bulls read
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:25.720]  it's like it don't happen i got you so you're saying the leaders were shown
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:28.520]  are the ones that are bought off we're not seeing all the real folks
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:32.680]  wait a minute all black leaders have not bought off a lot of people out here
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:36.280]  is doing the the right thing for the wrong reason
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:39.880]  and so as long as you're doing that and finally before we go off let me just say
[02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:45.880]  this if you look at a little fleet a little fleet can jump 24 inches
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:49.320]  that's in the dna but they've done experiments where they
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:54.040]  take a fleet and put it in an 18 inch jar with a top on it
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:57.880]  and when that fleet jumps up and the head hits the top that fleet is not aware
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:01.720]  it's in a jar and after that head hits for so many times
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:05.640]  you can take the lid off the jar and the fleet won't jump
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:09.880]  beyond 18 inches okay and that fleet trains this
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:15.000]  offspring is the same thing so how long can we be put in a trick like we've been
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.600]  put in since slavery and then no i got it i mean i'm not
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:21.400]  saying all black leaders i'm talking about the really predominant ones they
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:24.360]  put out there you're saying you're saying they've been put in a
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:27.800]  jar so that's the only universe they know they're inside a box
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:31.720]  that's all of it some of them some of them know the trick that's going down
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:35.000]  some of them don't know the trick that's going down but i'm saying
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:38.440]  what's happening today you see i survive on this country
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:43.160]  because i buy past all of that i buy past that i buy something i say well you
[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:46.600]  know uh uh jessie jackson had something to do with killing k
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:50.360]  from that body or city don't seem to bother the king's family
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:54.040]  they get along with him because they didn't get along with but eventually
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:57.560]  all of it is going to come out all of it it's going to be
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:01.080]  this you know when you look at it when you look at jessie jessie have one of
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:06.280]  the brilliant minds on the planet okay one of the big horrors to me since the
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:10.520]  obama one it messed up the myth in my idea i have been convinced
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:14.840]  that black folks thought all white folks all black folks look alike i used to
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:18.520]  believe that until obama become president i have met one white person
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:23.880]  walk up to me and say excuse me mr president
[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:27.560]  what are you uh in closing what do you i mean clearly obama was financed by the
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:31.240]  same folks and uh it's just being used as a way
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:34.440]  to divide people they claimed it would bring unity what's your brief take on
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:37.320]  obama well let me put it this way right before
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:41.480]  ronald fell they had a black emperor from africa
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:44.600]  you know when you look at the odd yeah they had africanists
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:50.840]  that's right what is the odd that the first black president of the united
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:54.040]  states wouldn't have no slave cheating because mama wasn't a slave his daddy
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:58.200]  wasn't a slave okay but the one of the things i'm looking at
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:02.280]  there's a whole lot of white folk that's going crazy in america
[02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:06.040]  because there's a black man in the white house now they won't say poor white
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:10.120]  folk but i look at it not i was invited to the operation i didn't go
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:14.760]  teacher service call me to mr gregory uh you on the the vip list
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:19.080]  for the obama inauguration what time can we pick you up i said are y'all the

[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:41.400]  this is how this worked man they've been playing games for so long
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:47.560]  until you can see it and feel it i can't tell you enough what you mean
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:52.040]  to you know you are the voice of america people like you are the voice
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:56.440]  and as long as you don't worry about what other people think about
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:26:01.160]  because i went to a conference one day some of the richest people in the world
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:05.960]  was there some of the most brilliant people i asked one question
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:10.520]  y'all are here from all over the world y'all got all the money you would ever
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:14.200]  want here's what i'm gonna ask you to do make me a scape
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:19.080]  huh when i cut my hand a scape you can make a nuclear bomb you can travel
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:23.880]  from one planet to another but you can't make a scape only the
[02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:29.160]  universal god can make a scape and anybody who gets hurt uh
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:32.920]  injured it don't say that you go to Harvard Yale or Morehouse
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:36.440]  it don't sound much money you got in the back you got a scape coming
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:41.160]  and once you reduce these thugs down to just
[02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:44.920]  model folks and know there's a universal order
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:49.160]  that protects you that watches over you and they ain't into no
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:52.760]  isms and albums look you got a right hand in the left hand
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:56.200]  for the next two weeks put your right hand in your pocket and survive with
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:26:59.960]  your left for the next two weeks after that put your left hand in your pocket
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:03.960]  and survive with your right okay is queen Elizabeth left or right
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:07.320]  the people who run the world don't play that queen Elizabeth
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:11.000]  and i tell people all the time no they control the full spectrum
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.240]  that's right and once people realize white ain't a color it's an attitude
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:18.120]  and if you ain't got some dreams of what's in the night
[02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:23.080]  you can't have the attitude and so Hitler didn't declare war on Africa
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:28.120]  world war one but it was it was jumped on white but they didn't make a
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:30.840]  nuclear bomb to drop on Africa and when people
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:34.680]  started realizing that and thought understanding that
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:38.280]  and so that no exactly you've got the tiny ultra elite
[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:42.520]  waging war against everybody else but they play the subgroups off against
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:44.920]  each other because the controllers are so small
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:48.520]  they're weak unless they can play us off against each other
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:51.720]  that's right and that's why they can never admit
[02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:55.240]  if they found somebody from another planet they couldn't admit it why
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:59.640]  if we admitted there was somebody else white supremacy go out the window
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:03.720]  organized religion go out the window and the third one which is worse you know
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:06.920]  we become earthly there wouldn't be a chicago
[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:11.640]  or texas or oh how or germany we would be earth people where do you see in
[02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:17.240]  closing obama's destiny ending well it's very hard to it's very
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:19.880]  hard to see i'm worried about obama being the false
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:23.000]  flag i'm wondering i'm i'm thinking they're going to use
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:27.560]  some nut to kill him as a way to really divide people no no no trust me
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:31.800]  they were you look when you groom something
[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:35.880]  you don't take it out and let me tell you and if whoever killed the president
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:39.720]  united states will not be a nut please believe me no no i agree but i'm saying
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:42.760]  they would claim that no i see the point you're making so

[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:07.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:32:07.240 --> 02:32:11.160]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:32:11.160 --> 02:32:14.600]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:32:14.600 --> 02:32:18.840]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:23.240]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:26.920]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:30.840]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:33.960]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:37.880]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:26.200]  all right i started the show talking about this
[02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:29.240]  and i want to get into it more when we blitz through some news here in a few
[02:33:29.240 --> 02:33:35.640]  minutes but this bloomberg article in their long-term
[02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:39.240]  research and prudential admits it the big insurance companies others are
[02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:42.040]  involved that they had a secret deal with the government
[02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:47.000]  and the department of veterans to allow them to basically keep the money
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.800]  from six million soldiers and their different types of
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:55.400]  uh injury benefits and death benefits and it just shows these people practice
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:34:01.560]  evil and they train you to accept evil that's why they're now in the news going
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:05.240]  ministry of defense probes claim that soldiers are smuggling heroin
[02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:08.520]  from afghanistan what are you talking about in fact as you guys find that fox
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:11.720]  newscast we played before uh where uh
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:15.640]  heraldos on there with the marine corps colonel and they admit they're helping
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:19.880]  protect and grow the opium fields remember that
[02:34:19.880 --> 02:34:22.840]  we're not gonna play it yet i would play it right at the end of the hour
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:26.280]  but uh i mean it because people don't believe this when i say it i've got to
[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:28.840]  play it i can pull up ap roiders they're like
[02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:31.960]  we have to help grow the opium or the Taliban won't be our friends
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:36.360]  we're there to get the opium when i say we're there i've got to get my mind out
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:40.280]  of that cycle this isn't my country my country was stolen i want my country
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:43.640]  back we're run by big global corporations for their
[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:48.920]  power and control and they if they'll kill a million plus irakis in the last
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:52.440]  uh seven and a half years of war and over a million and a half from sanctions
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:56.040]  before that that's two and a half million of a 24 million population
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:59.480]  do you think they care about minimum wage workers cleaning stuff up with core
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:02.600]  exit in the gulf or at exxon valdez 20 something years ago you think they
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:07.000]  care about firefighters and police medical workers at the world trade center
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:10.760]  you think they care about any of this
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:17.720]  i mean do you think that the system cares about
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:25.640]  you and the answer is no not only do they not care they enjoy hurting you
[02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:28.920]  of course they're poisoning the water and the vaccines
[02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:32.520]  of course they're doing all of this and the sick part is we go along with it we
[02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:36.040]  feel like we're part of the system and all our little petty positions of power
[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:40.680]  and the compartmentalized pyramidal structure it's time to realize that we
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:45.160]  are a drugged out dumbed down wicked society and we've
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:48.840]  got to start recognizing evil from good and supporting good
[02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:52.600]  over evil but that means you've got to find the real good not the whole
[02:35:52.600 --> 02:35:57.160]  panoptagon the whole panacea the whole pantheon
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:06.440]  of counterfeits i mean this world is sophisticated
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:09.640]  and i just learned more every month now that i learned in the previous year it's
[02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:12.600]  just accelerating and i can't even articulate at all it's just
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:15.720]  incredible and i can't stand being prominent
[02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:20.040]  i can't stand that i'm in the position with all this responsibility because
[02:36:20.040 --> 02:36:22.920]  even though i'm real and try to be good i'm weak
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:27.640]  i'm made up out of the flesh but through all the persecution we've gone
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:30.920]  through we don't talk about really much of it on the show
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:34.120]  it just makes me a better person
[02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:44.760]  coming up this story's up on the drudge report

[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.800]  who they are i've studied them researched them read their
[02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:17.240]  writings watched them for so long i'm 36 years old i've
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:22.280]  been doing this for 15 years and i'm almost like god
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:26.440]  why me but you've got to look at the mirror and ask yourself that as well i
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:30.600]  mean it's all of us together and i know why a lot of you are scared
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:33.320]  you're scared of the responsibility you're scared you're scared of the
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:36.760]  consequences but i'm here to tell you the consequences to not
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:43.240]  resisting this dehumanization 110 percent are much greater
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:47.560]  than whatever the consequences are of resisting it it's going to be much worse
[02:38:47.560 --> 02:38:51.480]  if we don't say no to this we know this is a tyranny we know this is an
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:55.800]  oppression we know this is a dehumanizing system
[02:38:55.800 --> 02:39:00.360]  it's death and we have got to realize how sick
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:03.480]  this world is and we've got to get our priority straight
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:05.880]  right now
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:12.280]  i mean what did gregory say did gregory's extremely famous icon of the
[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:15.080]  civil rights movement
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:19.640]  and i'd never talked to him never tried to get him on i saw he was on a 911
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:23.800]  truth hunger strike so we call up and he's like i just love you and
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:26.840]  see your research and everybody all over the country talks about you more than
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:29.720]  anybody else and then he said that on air you
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:33.480]  heard him i mean you know what that's like and then to know that they've got
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:37.080]  not just government attacking me and big corporations and big media demonizing
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:39.880]  me and lying about me and twisting what i say
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:44.200]  but the co-intel pro attacking me from the conspiracy theory angle
[02:39:44.200 --> 02:39:47.480]  and the white supremacist like howl turner who i knew was a fed you could
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:50.120]  just tell it i knew he was a globalist i knew
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:53.640]  he was fbi it came out i was exactly right i know them
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:58.280]  i know glenbeck's bad i know barack obama's bad i know
[02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:01.240]  okay i know
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:06.440]  it's like looking out your door and there's a thunderstorm and rain's coming
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:09.240]  down cats and dogs i know if i walk out there i'm
[02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:13.240]  going to get drenched it's raining so hard the
[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:18.040]  rain's going sideways an umbrella isn't going to help
[02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:21.960]  i knew those bin latin videos were fake when i looked at them
[02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:26.200]  i could tell one was a computer generation a classic video game
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:29.240]  template it wasn't even well done they do them bad on purpose
[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:32.600]  to condition you to accept lies where you know it's a lie at a subconscious
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:35.480]  level but accept it
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:41.960]  and now they admit it's fake the other one was a fat guy in a room they admit
[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:44.920]  they admit they made that one they come out and say we're taking the
[02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:48.200]  veteran's death benefits they come out and say
[02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:51.560]  they're shipping the drugs in they just they just they're trying to break our
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:53.800]  will they're trying to dominate us and go okay
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:57.160]  you exposed us fine we're evil what you're going to do about it
[02:40:57.160 --> 02:40:59.960]  they're counting on yuppies not being able to admit they're putting sodium
[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:02.840]  fluoride that's deadly in the water they're counting on people not looking
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:05.720]  at the evidence the vaccines are killing you and maven you
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:09.160]  you've got to make the decision to admit the truth to yourself and then what
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:12.520]  are you going to do about it as one of the founding fathers said
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:15.640]  i'm willing to know the whole truth the horrible truth and make preparation for
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:18.520]  it just denying the truth doesn't make you
[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:21.160]  safe it makes you in more danger sticking your head in the sand the hyenas
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:24.200]  gets you now for the balance of this segment i
[02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:27.640]  want to bring up steve shank one of our great sponsors and not only does this
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:31.480]  fund our operation and we're funded by you the listeners but it's also the
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:35.320]  storeable food company i believe in i bought a lot of different places didn't
[02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:39.320]  like it or it had chemicals in it or you know it had
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:44.920]  fillers in it had things like msg in it or it was gmo not with steve shank and
[02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:48.040]  it's the biggest continually operating company in the nation
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:51.640]  and i believe patriots need gardens and guns and gold
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:54.920]  and that patriots need to have storeable food
[02:41:54.920 --> 02:41:57.880]  and i believe now is the time to take action i'm going to cover news in the
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:01.000]  final segment bringing steve shank up steve good to have you here with us
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:06.360]  today your buy three get one free is about to end
[02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:09.320]  and you haven't done this but one other time in the past
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:12.280]  and so much is happening with the grain shortages in russia
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:14.920]  and with the depression i've got all the news here where they're admitting we're
[02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:17.720]  going into a depression i mean i believe in this i hope
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:20.520]  folks get storeable foods from you while they can
[02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:24.200]  well absolutely uh the fascinating thing
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:28.120]  alex is that the only reason that we we brought this
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:31.240]  to buy three get one free up again is because
[02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:35.240]  we have been absolutely forced this russian thing is absolutely insane
[02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:38.200]  prices all over the place are going up like mad
[02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:42.840]  and for the first time in three years e-foods has to raise prices we don't
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:47.160]  have any choice otherwise we'll be on the on our back it'll be
[02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:50.680]  able to wipe us out and so what we did was we
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:54.360]  pretty bought a whole bunch of of the food that we could get from our
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:57.720]  suppliers at the the current prices before
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:01.560]  they hit us with the price increases and that's why we're able to do the buy
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:06.440]  three get one free but we the response has been absolutely insane
[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:09.800]  we've got the people calling us and emailing us and
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:15.000]  and orders coming out our ears and we're just concerned about the length of
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:18.600]  time that we've given before that price increase so what we did
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:21.960]  was we're going to jack it back seven days
[02:43:21.960 --> 02:43:28.680]  so by the 27th of this month of september if people will get their orders
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:32.200]  into as fast as they can by the 27th of the month
[02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:37.400]  we will have to go up to higher prices on the 28th just to survive for the
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:42.040]  for buying in this next batch of stuff but what we've got right now is we've
[02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:47.880]  got the prices going up like crazy and the united states will refuse
[02:43:47.880 --> 02:43:53.080]  to to set limits on the amount of exports so these other countries
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:56.760]  are buying up our food and they're going to starve our citizens well my main
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:43:59.320]  reason is they're admitting we're going into a
[02:43:59.320 --> 02:44:02.120]  depression they're devaluing the dollar gold is
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:05.160]  exploding look with all the uncertainty i got
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:08.680]  storeable food i got it from you it's the best food i've gotten it's the best
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:13.560]  price you're a patriot it supports the broadcast win win win win win win
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:17.080]  folks don't be dependent on the government to have food this stuff
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:20.120]  lasts more than 10 years climate controlled if it's in your garage like
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:22.120]  mine 10 years it's high quality
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:26.920]  neutral reversal foods just check it out eat foods direct com
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:30.840]  sounds like a deal to me alex and the main thing is they're even trying to
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:35.240]  pass legislation right now that is going to limit the ability of people even
[02:44:35.240 --> 02:44:39.240]  grow their own food i've read the bill it says if i pick figs
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:43.160]  and go and prepare them slice them make a pie i have in my backyard
[02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:46.920]  if i do any preparation it's illegal i mean this is worse than what
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:52.360]  lennon did controlling food i mean this is this is this is but this is insane
[02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:55.800]  that's why these people have to take advantage of this thing
[02:44:55.800 --> 02:44:59.960]  uh... where we've held the prices down as as much as we can we know people
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:03.400]  have to pour every step that they can and they get as much food as possible
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:07.560]  that's why we're combining holding back the price increase at the same time
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:12.440]  we're doing this five three get one three that's 25 percent savings it's
[02:45:12.440 --> 02:45:15.800]  ridiculous but uh... we're going to be able to do it
[02:45:15.800 --> 02:45:21.640]  and basically you spell freedom f-o-o-d and people can fight for their own
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:24.440]  freedom and will sure help as much as we can but
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:28.760]  they gotta move they just absolutely have pentagon studies show that within
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:33.080]  10 days without food uh... over 90 percent of people will start
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:36.520]  killing uh... for food and after 15 days
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:40.760]  over 90 percent began engaging in cannibalism what you see in a movie like
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:45.480]  the road happens within 15 days of no food
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:50.040]  it's what happened in leningrad during the two-year nazi siege they
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:54.120]  sustained after they ate the rats and after they ate the the wallpaper that
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:57.000]  had flour in it uh... they began eating people
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:00.600]  and i'm not saying that's going to happen that the the issue is
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:06.920]  nine 90 percent and this is a mainline statistic of our population is urban
[02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:10.760]  they're totally unself sufficient and in the great depression
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:15.880]  we were the reverse of that right at 90 percent were were rural 10 percent urban
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:19.080]  now that's flip-flopped and if university studies show seven million
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:22.520]  starved to death over the 10-year depression in the u.s. they estimate
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:25.240]  what's going to happen if we have a full board depression
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:29.400]  that we're now sliding into now you are nuts if you don't have storeable food
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:33.480]  it's that simple absolutely and and that the whole thing
[02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:37.960]  is that they're now calling this the greatest depression as opposed to what
[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:41.800]  was there before you realize that 40 percent of our
[02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:45.080]  families go to the grocery store right now and have to decide whether they're
[02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:48.200]  going to pay their bills or buy food and that's
[02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:51.800]  that's what we're trying to fight alec and that's why we're scrambling we've
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:56.120]  got production up as high as we can produce and everything that we can
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:00.600]  pack it up from from this food that we bought in at the previous prices
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:04.200]  and when this is gone uh... we're going to have to raise the price of one of
[02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:08.120]  his choice in it in a country where people are having a hard time affording
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:10.840]  it now uh... we don't know what and the government's
[02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:14.200]  paying record amounts of people i was reading uh... in
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:17.720]  i wasn't in bloomberg uh... it was in my uh...
[02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:21.400]  the economist when i was out of town with vinter i was reading a lot of
[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:26.840]  magazines that they're paying record numbers to produce crops for ethanol
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:30.760]  oh i know if that's the way it is the stupidest beyond belief
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:34.280]  but if you figure that the last figures came out that fifty two percent of the
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:37.640]  population that the employee that's working for the government
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:42.520]  that leaves the remainder of the employed population having to support
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:46.760]  those people working for the government and all of the people that are on food
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:50.920]  stamps welfare that have lost their jobs i've got uh... work we're just going to
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:52.520]  post on our website
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:56.760]  this uh... job loss uh... uh... math that they've got of the country that goes
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:48:01.240]  from two thousand seven two with the president that's unbelievable the map
[02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:06.440]  is almost all black from from over ten to twenty percent of the population
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:09.160]  uh... the employable population beyond employed
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:12.760]  we have trouble right here in river city alex
[02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:16.920]  and people have to move food is how you spell
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:20.120]  freedom it's just that you'll never stand a bright line if you have your own

[02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:09.240]  about this is
[02:49:09.240 --> 02:49:12.920]  we were getting laughed at ten fifteen years ago saying own guns food
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:16.120]  try to move into the country we're going to have a financial collapse derivatives

[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:24.120]  history at prismplanet.com big sis to get expanded role
[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:27.240]  in policing the internet two cybersecurity bills that would end
[02:54:27.240 --> 02:54:29.560]  president obama the power to shut down parts the internet
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:32.680]  the international emergency have now been merged into a single unified piece
[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:36.120]  of legislation the democrats will try to pass for the end of the year
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:38.840]  with the department of homeland security being given a larger role in policing
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:43.320]  the worldwide web under the new draft bill which is combined with two versions
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:46.280]  originally crafted by senators Lieberman and Rockefeller
[02:54:46.280 --> 02:54:51.240]  Janet Napolitano's DHS will be handed broader authority to determine how to
[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:54.600]  handle potential cybersecurity threats they talk about being proactive
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:57.400]  DHS will get expanded authorities i think it's clear said James Lewis
[02:54:57.400 --> 02:55:00.360]  cybersecurity expert and then it goes into all the different ways they want to
[02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:03.080]  censor and control the web and all the different white house sawers
[02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:06.600]  saying they want that and then you watch republicans will get into power
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:10.280]  they're going to love all this they they originally wrote the cyber security act
[02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:14.040]  but meanwhile homeland security is not deporting or arresting illegals they're
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:16.120]  announcing they're just going to basically get rid of all of it
[02:55:16.120 --> 02:55:19.240]  so the borders are wide open but your internet's got to be controlled and they
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:23.080]  lie to you and say the internet is hooked into nuclear power plants and
[02:55:23.080 --> 02:55:26.680]  b2 bombers none of that's true even the wall street journal admitted that so
[02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:30.920]  they're lying to you well of course they're lying they're a pack of criminals
[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:35.160]  if they'll steal dead veterans insurance money and tell people core exited and
[02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:40.120]  bad for them and then ask bestest dust is good what do you expect
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:43.960]  and separately there's big investigations are the troops growing opium
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:47.800]  are they shipping it out that's all over the news and then in plain view they're
[02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:50.520]  helping grow it of course they're helping ship it in
[02:55:50.520 --> 02:55:54.520]  they only bust little guys that are shipping it on their own
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:55:58.440]  they're not allowed to do that that's who they're busting in these news articles
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:02.360]  let's play a quick clip of fox news loraldo with the marines
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:05.800]  admitting they're helping guard and grow the opium here it is province of
[02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:10.520]  province as you suggest that has become addicted to opium in many many ways
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:13.960]  that is the principal crop that is being grown here
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:19.000]  the taliban lend the farmers the money they are indebted to the taliban they
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:22.360]  have to grow the opium now the marines in their success
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:26.760]  are in a sense a victim of their success because now the population
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:31.080]  is uh you know they have these opium fields and we are tolerating it we are
[02:56:31.080 --> 02:56:35.160]  tolerating the cultivation of the opium because we know that if we were to
[02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:38.920]  destroy it now the population would turn against the marines and it would be a
[02:56:38.920 --> 02:56:41.560]  real security risk let me introduce lieutenant colonel
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:45.800]  brian christmas he's the commanding officer of the third battalion six marines
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:51.400]  really a wonderful group of marines here i know that you care deeply about this
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:55.400]  this contradiction the fact that here you have one of the best fighting forces
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:59.720]  in the world ever mounted and in a sense you're watching as
[02:56:59.720 --> 02:57:03.560]  this opium is being grown i know it it grinds at your gut
[02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:07.080]  how do you deal with it what are you doing about it well frankly this is a
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:10.600]  part of their culture so while it might grind in my gut it's
[02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:14.360]  what they do we provide them security we're providing
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:18.120]  them resources and we're providing them alternatives the alternatives are
[02:57:18.120 --> 02:57:21.560]  different crops to grow they're getting the seed and the fertilizer to do it
[02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:24.760]  they can they can rotate any of their crops that they want if they want to get
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:27.160]  rid of their wheat and grow cotton for the winter they can do that and we're
[02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:29.720]  going to help them do it so the same thing goes for the product
[02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:32.680]  so you think that uh you know we were well that's enough market and everywhere
[02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:35.560]  we go it goes on and on so it starts coming out the
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:38.920]  trips so they're actually helping grow it and supplying them with the seeds
[02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:45.320]  and with the fertilizer and then if they catch your idiot teenager with some
[02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:51.640]  they're going to prison do not use their prescription drugs
[02:57:51.640 --> 02:57:56.040]  all the drugs they're pushing the prozac the hillbilly heroin the
[02:57:56.040 --> 02:58:00.760]  oxy cotton don't use any of their crud get off their cigarettes get off their
[02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:04.600]  liquor just get off all of it we're a drugged out society
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:07.160]  and when the cops stop you at a checkpoint want to search your car go
[02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:10.200]  look i'm not using the crap your bosses ship in
[02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:13.480]  every cop i've talked to in the last 20 years knows the government ships most
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:17.160]  the drugs in and they just put it in your face well we've
[02:58:17.160 --> 02:58:20.520]  got to do it you know it's just the way it is
[02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:24.200]  but they're investigating or any of the troops helping ship it out give
[02:58:24.200 --> 02:58:27.080]  me a break
[02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:31.080]  and they make the marines stand up there and you know talk about opium like
[02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:34.520]  it's a good you know this is a good thing this is how we beat the taliban
[02:58:34.520 --> 02:58:42.520]  the taliban was created by the cia god bless you all info wars.com
