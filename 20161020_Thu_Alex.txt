[00:00.000 --> 00:07.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump won the debate last night.
[00:07.960 --> 00:09.600]  It's a big Thursday broadcast.
[00:09.600 --> 00:11.000]  Get ready to kick off.
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.960]  Lies, lies and more lies.
[00:13.960 --> 00:16.840]  Hillary stood poised with an air of smug arrogance.
[00:16.840 --> 00:22.240]  Donald stood by, reserved and battle-worn after enduring, along with the American people,
[00:22.240 --> 00:27.680]  a unification of fraud from the globalist bought and paid for mainstream media propaganda
[00:27.680 --> 00:28.680]  machine.
[00:28.680 --> 00:33.920]  A tremendous amount of scathing info from WikiLeaks, another torpedo to the sinking
[00:33.920 --> 00:39.600]  battleship of the Democrats from James O'Keeffe and the Veritas Project, and the FBI's announcement
[00:39.600 --> 00:45.360]  that a four-star general will face prison time for charges that are dwarfed by Hillary's
[00:45.360 --> 00:48.480]  email breach of our national security.
[00:48.480 --> 00:51.680]  The stench of BS hung heavy in the air.
[00:51.680 --> 00:57.360]  In a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned
[00:57.360 --> 01:02.400]  from the WikiLeaks that you said this, and I want to quote, my dream is a hemispheric
[01:02.400 --> 01:06.000]  common market with open trade and open borders.
[01:06.000 --> 01:12.880]  So that's the question, that's the question, please quiet everybody, is that your dream
[01:12.880 --> 01:13.880]  open borders?
[01:13.880 --> 01:18.880]  Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.
[01:18.880 --> 01:24.760]  You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the line.
[01:24.760 --> 01:31.280]  And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders.
[01:31.280 --> 01:33.720]  I think that will be a great benefit to us.
[01:33.720 --> 01:40.080]  But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks, and what's really important about WikiLeaks
[01:40.080 --> 01:47.560]  is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.
[01:47.560 --> 01:55.440]  They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions.
[01:55.440 --> 02:02.200]  Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.
[02:02.200 --> 02:06.960]  This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly from Putin himself
[02:06.960 --> 02:14.280]  in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed to influence our election.
[02:14.280 --> 02:20.600]  So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is finally will Donald
[02:20.600 --> 02:27.920]  Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will
[02:27.920 --> 02:35.560]  not have the help of Putin in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against
[02:35.560 --> 02:39.560]  Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past.
[02:39.560 --> 02:41.040]  Those are the questions we need answered.
[02:41.040 --> 02:44.680]  We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.
[02:44.680 --> 02:48.160]  That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders.
[02:48.160 --> 02:49.160]  Okay.
[02:49.160 --> 02:50.880]  How did we get off to Putin?
[02:50.880 --> 02:55.400]  You condemn any interference by Russia in the American election.
[02:55.400 --> 02:57.440]  By Russia or anybody else.
[02:57.440 --> 02:58.800]  You condemn their interference.
[02:58.800 --> 02:59.800]  Of course I condemn.
[02:59.800 --> 03:00.800]  Of course I can.
[03:00.800 --> 03:01.800]  I don't know Putin.
[03:01.800 --> 03:02.800]  I have no idea.
[03:02.800 --> 03:04.280]  I've never met Putin.
[03:04.280 --> 03:05.920]  This is not my best friend.
[03:05.920 --> 03:11.600]  Part of the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad, look, she's been proven
[03:11.600 --> 03:14.280]  to be a liar on so many different ways.
[03:14.280 --> 03:16.040]  This is just another lie.
[03:16.040 --> 03:22.560]  I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives, and so I'm telling you right now,
[03:22.560 --> 03:27.480]  we're going to write fairer rules for the middle class, and we are going to raise taxes
[03:27.480 --> 03:28.480]  on the middle class.
[03:28.480 --> 03:33.600]  Is your plan basically more, even more of the Obama's stimulus?
[03:33.600 --> 03:35.600]  Well, it's a combination, Chris.
[03:35.600 --> 03:43.400]  And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama
[03:43.400 --> 03:51.240]  inherited, I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.
[03:51.240 --> 03:56.280]  He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.
[03:56.280 --> 04:00.360]  I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had
[04:00.360 --> 04:02.480]  such violence.
[04:02.480 --> 04:05.240]  She's the one in Obama that caused the violence.
[04:05.240 --> 04:11.320]  They hired people, they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying, be violent, cause
[04:11.320 --> 04:16.360]  fights, do bad things, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people
[04:16.360 --> 04:18.960]  to go out and start fistfights and start violence.
[04:18.960 --> 04:23.760]  And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could
[04:23.760 --> 04:25.640]  have been killed in that riot.
[04:25.640 --> 04:28.720]  And that was now all on tape started by her.
[04:28.720 --> 04:35.160]  Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans
[04:35.160 --> 04:40.240]  Democrats, Republicans, and independents, because we need everybody to help make our
[04:40.240 --> 04:42.480]  country what it should be.
[04:42.480 --> 04:49.160]  You can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
[04:49.160 --> 04:54.840]  I don't know about you, America, but how can we believe a word Hillary says?
[04:54.840 --> 04:59.080]  And why should we, John Bowne, for ifwars.com.
[04:59.080 --> 05:00.080]  Start your engines.
[05:00.080 --> 05:02.160]  Main transmission begins now.
[05:02.160 --> 05:07.520]  Never happened to billionaire Mark Rich, one of the world's most wanted fugitives, who
[05:07.520 --> 05:13.280]  16 years ago was being indicted on one of the biggest tax fraud cases in American history.
[05:13.280 --> 05:18.960]  And he was also involved in illegal trade deals with Iran and other crimes that were
[05:18.960 --> 05:23.280]  harsh enough to put him on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list.
[05:23.280 --> 05:28.200]  Well, Mark Rich may have been a career criminal, but he wasn't stupid because he knew the best
[05:28.200 --> 05:34.280]  way to receive his get out of jail free card was to donate money to the Clintons.
[05:34.280 --> 05:38.800]  Mark Rich gave a half million dollars to the Clinton Library, and lo and behold, after
[05:38.800 --> 05:43.840]  20 years of running from the law, he was pardoned by President Bill Clinton.
[05:43.840 --> 05:49.280]  Rich died in 2013, but his business partners continued to donate huge amounts of money
[05:49.280 --> 05:56.720]  to the Clintons, including a $1 billion pledge to the Clinton Global Initiative in 2009.
[05:56.720 --> 06:01.200]  This is Clinton Justice, and you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[06:01.200 --> 06:03.600]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[06:03.600 --> 06:07.900]  Will you and your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown?
[06:07.900 --> 06:11.280]  Like many experts, I believe another devastating crash is coming.
[06:11.280 --> 06:13.600]  I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[06:13.600 --> 06:16.360]  Don't wait for another crisis that could wipe out your hard-earned money.
[06:16.360 --> 06:21.920]  Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault at 844-541-ALEX.
[06:21.920 --> 06:23.320]  It's a company I trust.
[06:23.320 --> 06:27.960]  They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money
[06:27.960 --> 06:29.200]  in an economic meltdown.
[06:29.200 --> 06:32.520]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[06:32.520 --> 06:35.960]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is
[06:35.960 --> 06:37.280]  on the move.
[06:37.280 --> 06:42.160]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting
[06:42.160 --> 06:43.160]  finances.
[06:43.160 --> 06:44.160]  Don't delay.
[06:44.160 --> 06:50.080]  Call 844-541-ALEX now and get a rugged, double-locked bank bag to securely store your coins absolutely
[06:50.080 --> 06:51.080]  free.
[06:51.080 --> 06:55.200]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[06:55.200 --> 06:57.840]  I personally own these survival packs and you should too.
[06:57.840 --> 07:01.520]  Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALEX now.
[07:01.520 --> 07:04.920]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[07:10.200 --> 07:14.320]  and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[07:26.040 --> 07:28.920]  and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.

[08:19.880 --> 08:28.800]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[08:28.800 --> 08:39.880]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[08:39.880 --> 08:40.880]  Eighteen days.
[08:40.880 --> 08:43.880]  Eighteen days to the general election.
[08:43.880 --> 08:45.880]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[08:45.880 --> 08:50.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours, we have a bunch of extremely informative
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.440]  guests joining us, but I'm going to focus as best I can just to make you a public announcement.
[08:54.440 --> 09:00.440]  I'm going to try not to get too out of breath, not get too hysterical.
[09:00.440 --> 09:06.400]  But there's so many facets to this.
[09:06.400 --> 09:12.440]  We have Donna Brazil, one of the main henchmen of the Democratic Party crime machine, one
[09:12.440 --> 09:19.640]  of the top generals, on Fox News telling Megyn Kelly that she will not be persecuted and
[09:19.640 --> 09:25.680]  that she didn't get a question from a previous debate weeks before the debate took place,
[09:25.680 --> 09:27.880]  which CNN admits they did.
[09:27.880 --> 09:33.920]  And the WikiLeak email is real, but she just lies to everyone and says, that's not her
[09:33.920 --> 09:34.920]  reality.
[09:34.920 --> 09:40.920]  And this is all about these people controlling reality and literally trying to mind control
[09:40.920 --> 09:41.920]  us.
[09:41.920 --> 09:45.440]  That's a theme that came up today when I was going through hundreds of these stories where
[09:45.440 --> 09:54.440]  you've got EPA courts and federal government institutions and czars telling Congress and
[09:54.440 --> 10:00.720]  telling other people, I will not talk to a climate denier.
[10:00.720 --> 10:04.280]  Now in and of that is multiple mind controls.
[10:04.280 --> 10:08.400]  First it was global freezing in the 70s, then it was global warming in the 80s and 90s
[10:08.400 --> 10:09.400]  and 2000s.
[10:09.400 --> 10:14.680]  Now the UN got caught hiding the decline, red handed, fixing the temperature rates
[10:14.680 --> 10:21.360]  with thousands of universities, so that just became climate change, then it's climate.
[10:21.360 --> 10:23.160]  You are denying climate.
[10:23.160 --> 10:27.360]  No, I'm not denying climate.
[10:27.360 --> 10:30.840]  That's like denying that, again, there's air or there's water.
[10:30.840 --> 10:32.840]  It's craziness, EPA chief.
[10:32.840 --> 10:36.880]  I'm not talking to climate deniers and I've got several other articles where other people
[10:36.880 --> 10:39.000]  in the federal government are saying the same thing.
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.680]  They're in charge, we say what reality is, Obamacare is free.
[10:43.680 --> 10:44.680]  You can keep your doctor.
[10:44.680 --> 10:48.400]  Thank God the public's so dumb, ha ha ha.
[10:48.400 --> 10:52.000]  And it's the same thing over and over again.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.320]  I was listening to local talk radio this morning and I tuned into natural public radio and
[10:56.320 --> 11:01.960]  then I was obviously talking to folks here at the office and just canvassing the public
[11:01.960 --> 11:04.480]  and I was looking at the headlines, the New York Times, you name it.
[11:04.480 --> 11:12.680]  It was this wall of disinformation that Trump is just so outrageous.
[11:12.680 --> 11:16.840]  He's done something that in our history has never been done.
[11:16.840 --> 11:24.280]  He's so un-American that he is saying he's planning to contest the election if he doesn't
[11:24.280 --> 11:25.280]  win.
[11:25.280 --> 11:27.840]  No, what he said is, I'm going to wait and see.
[11:27.840 --> 11:32.840]  We got 4 million people that are either dead or who aren't supposed to be on the rolls.
[11:32.840 --> 11:37.040]  We've got reports coming out all over the country of election fraud.
[11:37.040 --> 11:39.920]  There's a history of it.
[11:39.920 --> 11:44.280]  We've got Democratic Party officials caught on undercover videos admitting it.
[11:44.280 --> 11:48.560]  I mean, these are the head people in the country.
[11:48.560 --> 11:49.560]  People for the American way.
[11:49.560 --> 11:53.840]  I mean, that's the top of the food chain with these folks.
[11:53.840 --> 12:02.120]  And the entire media acts like he's completely insane and has 14 heads and it's from Mars.
[12:02.120 --> 12:07.120]  Even as I keep hammering and finally this is starting to come out, Al Gore contested
[12:07.120 --> 12:08.120]  the election.
[12:08.120 --> 12:11.080]  It went to the Supreme Court.
[12:11.080 --> 12:13.280]  Antonin Scalia was the deciding person.
[12:13.280 --> 12:15.280]  Notice he got taken care of.
[12:15.280 --> 12:17.720]  This is so obvious.
[12:17.720 --> 12:21.960]  Does anyone remember 15 years ago, 16 years ago?
[12:21.960 --> 12:29.680]  Does anyone remember the 1960 election which they certified was fraud in Illinois and Texas?
[12:29.680 --> 12:35.440]  Does anyone remember the diebolt machines in Ohio and the state certifying that fraud
[12:35.440 --> 12:37.200]  happened just a few years ago?
[12:37.200 --> 12:41.960]  I mean, there are so many thousands of certified examples.
[12:41.960 --> 12:49.240]  I caught election fraud where Patrick J. Buchanan, that is my name, won Travis County.
[12:49.240 --> 12:52.720]  I was there volunteering.
[12:52.720 --> 12:56.440]  They still made you take like $2 an hour for some reason, but I would go volunteer for
[12:56.440 --> 12:58.080]  the elections at the main center.
[12:58.080 --> 13:02.000]  That's where I wanted to be and I was there helping stack all of it up and seeing him
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.360]  winning by landslide.
[13:03.360 --> 13:06.360]  He got like 5-6% in Travis County at the end of the night.
[13:06.360 --> 13:11.040]  I went, started them to force a recount and the state said, you know what, you're right.
[13:11.040 --> 13:13.760]  We're still certifying it, but yes, it was fraud.
[13:13.760 --> 13:20.240]  I have been at the capitol and at the state house and I have been at the county commissioners
[13:20.240 --> 13:25.960]  court when the thing gets certified and they admit it's a fraud, personally.
[13:25.960 --> 13:33.320]  Look it up, micro fish and newspaper, Alex Jones contesting the election because I'm
[13:33.320 --> 13:38.800]  a cuck folks because I care because I'm involved because I know history and it's the same thing
[13:38.800 --> 13:39.800]  here.
[13:39.800 --> 13:44.360]  Trump knows in internal polls he's 5, 10, 15 points ahead depending on the state.
[13:44.360 --> 13:45.880]  He's going to win by landslide.
[13:45.880 --> 13:47.880]  Hillary can't even get a crowd of 200 people.
[13:47.880 --> 13:50.600]  He's got 30, 40, 50,000 everywhere he goes.
[13:50.600 --> 13:52.040]  Everyone knows this.
[13:52.040 --> 13:53.800]  The mainstream media knows this.
[13:53.800 --> 13:57.160]  We began and put out a new poll again last night and guess what they did again?
[13:57.160 --> 14:04.720]  They oversampled Democrats, the Republicans and put it in the methodology.
[14:04.720 --> 14:08.000]  Now even in cooked polls, he's ahead right now.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.520]  He destroyed her last night.
[14:10.520 --> 14:15.000]  He did miss some big opportunities when she was smirking about dead people in Syria when
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.320]  she's the author of it and so many other points and he should have had her during the debate
[14:19.320 --> 14:23.160]  not just in a tweet and said, you should give money back from Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
[14:23.160 --> 14:26.720]  They're giving you over $100 million and they cut women's genitals off.
[14:26.720 --> 14:31.040]  How dare you keep saying I'm abusing women with these cockamamie made up stories that
[14:31.040 --> 14:35.400]  I patted somebody on their butt 15 years ago on a freaking airplane, you witch.
[14:35.400 --> 14:36.400]  Excuse me.
[14:36.400 --> 14:38.000]  I said I'm going to settle down.
[14:38.000 --> 14:44.560]  But man, there's only so much of the lying and twisting and disinfo I can take.
[14:44.560 --> 14:49.800]  But we're putting together a video, a short one but it's highly produced that shows the
[14:49.800 --> 14:51.720]  history of the clips, all of it.
[14:51.720 --> 14:56.640]  But luckily, it's not done yet, but I kind of saw it organically already in the Daily
[14:56.640 --> 15:00.480]  Caller and Breitbart and Drudge where everybody's kind of going, hey, here's a clip of Al Gore
[15:00.480 --> 15:01.480]  contesting.
[15:01.480 --> 15:03.920]  Hey, here's a clip of where they just contested here.
[15:03.920 --> 15:09.000]  Here's a clip of Democrats 15 times saying Trump's going to rig the election.
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.120]  And that's what's crazy.
[15:10.120 --> 15:14.720]  Hillary on her plane last night, this is what makes smoke come out of my ears in her little
[15:14.720 --> 15:15.720]  stage press conferences.
[15:15.720 --> 15:19.600]  She won't do a real one, but she has her little lap dogs and they roll oranges at her.
[15:19.600 --> 15:23.640]  I'm not kidding, if you're a new listener, folks, they actually roll oranges at her to
[15:23.640 --> 15:26.520]  ask her questions, but sometimes she pops up and hangs in the doorway like a vampire
[15:26.520 --> 15:33.840]  bat and then they ask her questions and she's sitting there perched and she goes into how
[15:33.840 --> 15:36.200]  ridiculous it is that he says he won't accept the election.
[15:36.200 --> 15:39.640]  No, he said he's going to wait and see if there's full theft going on.
[15:39.640 --> 15:41.080]  There's already evidence of it.
[15:41.080 --> 15:45.960]  As he said last night, 4 million people on the rolls shouldn't be there.
[15:45.960 --> 15:56.800]  That's a canary and then I've got the time code here on two and a half minutes later.
[15:56.800 --> 16:01.520]  She goes into the Russians are trying to overthrow the election.
[16:01.520 --> 16:03.520]  I mean, where is it?
[16:03.520 --> 16:07.000]  Reporters are sitting there going, oh, that he says that the election might be stolen,
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.320]  the super key election.
[16:08.320 --> 16:11.880]  Oh, no, that's totally insane to say there might be some type of hanky-panky.
[16:11.880 --> 16:13.120]  Oh, my God.
[16:13.120 --> 16:14.120]  This is so bizarre.
[16:14.120 --> 16:17.600]  It was like saying we throw your baby and with starving hyenas, they might eat the
[16:17.600 --> 16:18.600]  baby.
[16:18.600 --> 16:19.600]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[16:19.600 --> 16:23.680]  Oh, my gosh, if you slip your wrist and jump into a pool of piranhas, they might bite
[16:23.680 --> 16:24.680]  you.
[16:24.680 --> 16:25.680]  I mean, he is such a cook.
[16:25.680 --> 16:29.280]  I mean, if you pour gasoline all over yourself and light it, you might get third degree burns.
[16:29.280 --> 16:30.280]  I mean, what a cook.
[16:30.280 --> 16:34.000]  I mean, if you take a shotgun and shove it in your mouth with 12 gauge and pull the trigger,
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.280]  it might blow your head off.
[16:35.280 --> 16:36.280]  That's crazy.
[16:36.280 --> 16:41.680]  You take a meat cleaver to your fingers, it'll cut them off.
[16:41.680 --> 16:43.120]  That's the kind of crazy crap he's saying.
[16:43.120 --> 16:48.600]  He says, if you take a slice of butter and put it on bread and it's hot toast, it'll
[16:48.600 --> 16:49.600]  melt.
[16:49.600 --> 16:51.240]  He said, if you don't breathe air, you'll suffocate.
[16:51.240 --> 16:57.000]  Oh, yeah, this guy's a frickin' demon, okay?
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  You know why?
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.680]  Because he said two plus two equals four and that's a crime with these people because these
[17:01.680 --> 17:03.800]  people are a cult.
[17:03.800 --> 17:07.160]  And I already knew this, but watching them, they really think they're controlling reality
[17:07.160 --> 17:11.360]  as con artists and they look at you with this dead stare.
[17:11.360 --> 17:15.160]  Like, Donna Brazil looks like a dead person.
[17:15.160 --> 17:20.080]  She looks like a dead person rotting in the sun that they've somehow reanimated.
[17:20.080 --> 17:25.120]  I'm sorry, she does.
[17:25.120 --> 17:29.400]  And then she just sits there and lies about WikiLeaks.
[17:29.400 --> 17:31.360]  It's all a con game with these people.
[17:31.360 --> 17:35.400]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[17:35.400 --> 17:38.440]  So we're sitting here dealing with all of this.
[17:38.440 --> 17:44.200]  And what do you do when they're constantly saying elections are fraudulent?
[17:44.200 --> 17:46.240]  Both sides have always been caught cheating.
[17:46.240 --> 17:47.240]  It's constantly going on.
[17:47.240 --> 17:51.640]  We have all the Democratic officials saying they're already cheating as we speak.
[17:51.640 --> 17:53.080]  Hillary says it's completely cookie.
[17:53.080 --> 17:54.400]  There's no such thing as election fraud.
[17:54.400 --> 17:56.640]  So does the president.
[17:56.640 --> 18:01.800]  But then meanwhile, out of the next statement, out of their mouth, they talk about the Russians,
[18:01.800 --> 18:04.760]  we've got to guard the election.
[18:04.760 --> 18:07.240]  They are at war with reality.
[18:07.240 --> 18:13.680]  So when we come back from break, we've got a whole bunch of these clips and I'm going
[18:13.680 --> 18:19.160]  to just play them here and then hopefully you can take this video and send this on to
[18:19.160 --> 18:23.080]  your Democratic friends and just say to them, listen, I don't care if you don't want to
[18:23.080 --> 18:24.080]  vote for Trump.
[18:24.080 --> 18:25.080]  That's fine.
[18:25.080 --> 18:33.480]  But at least admit this is an attempt to overthrow reality because to say that Trump
[18:33.480 --> 18:38.800]  is evil and Trump is bad and Trump is upsetting our republic and our democracy and all this.
[18:38.800 --> 18:42.360]  When he's saying, I'm going to wait and see what happens with this election.
[18:42.360 --> 18:45.080]  This is highly contested.
[18:45.080 --> 18:47.360]  We got four million people in there that shouldn't be voting.
[18:47.360 --> 18:49.560]  The Democrats say they're going to be cheating.
[18:49.560 --> 18:50.560]  And guess what?
[18:50.560 --> 18:55.600]  We've got new WikiLeaks with Podesta and he's in there saying we've got to get driver's
[18:55.600 --> 19:00.360]  licenses to the illegal so they can vote, but that's no secret.
[19:00.360 --> 19:07.920]  Seven, seven or eight states tried to pass laws last year and again, they passed the
[19:07.920 --> 19:12.000]  houses in several states going to governor's desk.
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.760]  What was it in Illinois, California and one other went to the desk, but the governor
[19:16.760 --> 19:21.920]  didn't sign them because it was to be too obvious.
[19:21.920 --> 19:22.920]  There it is.
[19:22.920 --> 19:26.120]  Podesta, it's okay for illegals to vote with driver's license.
[19:26.120 --> 19:27.120]  WikiLeaks.
[19:27.120 --> 19:33.280]  The whole point is you're here, they give you a driver's license, which all these states
[19:33.280 --> 19:38.120]  are doing and then you can go vote, but they don't even want that to sing.
[19:38.120 --> 19:39.120]  Don't even have that.
[19:39.120 --> 19:42.240]  Just don't even just show up and just whoever you are, you can vote.
[19:42.240 --> 19:44.880]  I mean, this is, this is beyond insane.
[19:44.880 --> 19:51.560]  And they sit there with a dead pan straight stare and say Donald Trump has just sunk to
[19:51.560 --> 19:56.240]  a new low when he said he was going to wait and see what happens.
[19:56.240 --> 20:00.120]  He's already stole the nomination, I'd say he's already illegitimate, which he said
[20:00.120 --> 20:02.240]  last night, which he said last night.
[20:02.240 --> 20:05.040]  Charlie Daniels, he's always defended the Second Amendment.
[20:05.040 --> 20:09.040]  Let me just read a little thing here from the Jim DeFonso, individual rights, we'll
[20:09.040 --> 20:11.040]  have to take her back to the state to the collective.
[20:11.040 --> 20:13.040]  Well, you know, the next post is going to be, don't you?
[20:13.040 --> 20:15.040]  It's going to be coming after your guns.
[20:15.040 --> 20:20.240]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag and beef was for supper.
[20:20.240 --> 20:25.480]  Revelation, Donald of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now
[20:25.480 --> 20:26.480]  available.
[20:26.480 --> 20:31.880]  I want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue, Revelation, the movie.info.
[20:31.880 --> 20:37.360]  KDArmor.com is your one stop shop for the highest quality body armor, period, with packages

[20:57.560 --> 20:58.560]  That's C-A-T-I-Armor.com.
[20:58.560 --> 20:59.560]  Come and take it.
[20:59.560 --> 21:05.560]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[21:05.560 --> 21:06.560]  food and boil water.
[21:06.560 --> 21:11.120]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire,
[21:11.120 --> 21:12.600]  then there's a much better way.
[21:12.600 --> 21:17.440]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities
[21:17.440 --> 21:19.080]  of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[21:19.080 --> 21:23.160]  The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[21:40.160 --> 21:41.160]  I store some.

[22:01.520 --> 22:02.520]  Think about this.
[22:02.520 --> 22:06.600]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated
[22:06.600 --> 22:11.760]  with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines,
[22:11.760 --> 22:14.560]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[22:14.560 --> 22:19.600]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[22:19.600 --> 22:23.080]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey water filter.
[22:23.080 --> 22:28.920]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show Big Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,
[22:28.920 --> 22:34.240]  BPA, pesticides, bacteria, and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[22:34.240 --> 22:37.720]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[22:37.720 --> 22:42.320]  The gold standard in water purification, and our filters last for years at less than two
[22:42.320 --> 22:43.560]  cents per gallon.

[23:00.040 --> 23:03.080]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[24:16.080 --> 24:17.080]  This is a short segment.
[24:17.080 --> 24:21.440]  I want to get more into the election fraud and then I want to go through the next segment,
[24:21.440 --> 24:28.440]  some of the history of the Democrats claiming, alleging and also proving election fraud because
[24:28.440 --> 24:29.440]  both sides do it.
[24:29.440 --> 24:30.680]  It's well known.
[24:30.680 --> 24:32.320]  Democrats are more famous for it overall.
[24:32.320 --> 24:33.320]  That's just a fact.
[24:33.320 --> 24:40.600]  Everybody knows about JFK stealing it from Nixon and the rest of it, but it happens.
[24:40.600 --> 24:44.960]  And so for Obama a few months ago to say what is election fraud?
[24:44.960 --> 24:45.960]  It doesn't exist.
[24:45.960 --> 24:49.080]  Don't listen to that guy from Texas.
[24:49.080 --> 24:52.840]  And then to go on and have his surrogates come out and say, oh, my God, the Russians
[24:52.840 --> 24:58.200]  are hacking our election, we've got to basically federalize it, really shows you how stupid
[24:58.200 --> 25:02.720]  they think you are, where they want you to hold two conflicting ideas in your head at
[25:02.720 --> 25:10.240]  the same time that they are telling you are both true.
[25:10.240 --> 25:17.360]  So first, here's Obama, obviously, a few days ago saying to Trump that he needs to quote
[25:17.360 --> 25:20.280]  stop whining.
[25:20.280 --> 25:33.280]  I have never seen in my lifetime or modern political history any presidential candidate
[25:33.280 --> 25:41.560]  trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken
[25:41.560 --> 25:44.240]  place.
[25:44.240 --> 25:48.160]  Just unprecedented.
[25:48.160 --> 25:53.280]  It happens to be based on no facts.
[25:53.280 --> 26:00.960]  Every expert, regardless of political party, regardless of ideology, conservative or liberal,
[26:00.960 --> 26:09.520]  who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant
[26:09.520 --> 26:21.920]  voter fraud are not to be found, that keep in mind elections are run by state and local
[26:21.920 --> 26:29.080]  officials, which means that there are places like Florida, for example, where you've got
[26:29.080 --> 26:30.080]  a Republican government.
[26:30.080 --> 26:31.080]  Okay.
[26:31.080 --> 26:32.080]  Let's stop right here.
[26:32.080 --> 26:33.520]  So he's saying, basically, Trump's a liar.
[26:33.520 --> 26:37.480]  He goes on to say, stop whining, we'll play that clip and come back for break, that part
[26:37.480 --> 26:38.480]  of it.
[26:38.480 --> 26:39.480]  But this is crazy.
[26:39.480 --> 26:43.480]  He's saying the lie that, hey, there's no such thing as election fraud, no serious expert
[26:43.480 --> 26:44.480]  says there is.
[26:44.480 --> 26:49.520]  We have a whole bunch of clips of Democrats in 2008, 2004, saying there's election fraud,
[26:49.520 --> 26:51.680]  quote, quote, we got to stop at Al Gore, the rest of it.
[26:51.680 --> 26:59.560]  So he's lying to you there, but then he knows full well what Pew Research and others show.
[26:59.560 --> 27:03.240]  Between four, maybe six million, but four is the low number.
[27:03.240 --> 27:06.320]  People that shouldn't be on the voting rolls are dead people that are voting, and we have
[27:06.320 --> 27:11.360]  Democrats all over the country, that's their specialty is election fraud, organizing individual
[27:11.360 --> 27:12.360]  voter fraud.
[27:12.360 --> 27:16.320]  And they always try to confuse the public, the media about that too, like, this individual
[27:16.320 --> 27:19.720]  fraud is very, very rare, and it's only a few people doing it.
[27:19.720 --> 27:23.720]  Well, yes, it's rare for someone individually to go out and try to vote in somebody else's
[27:23.720 --> 27:27.040]  name because it's organized because they have the voter list.
[27:27.040 --> 27:31.720]  They have the computer list of people that don't vote, but who they've kept on the list
[27:31.720 --> 27:34.880]  or dead people.
[27:34.880 --> 27:42.160]  I mean, seeing that news, all of them know this is true, it's indisputable, but here's
[27:42.160 --> 27:47.880]  a clip on Pew Research, one of the top research groups out there that Trump was quoting last
[27:47.880 --> 27:48.880]  night.
[27:48.880 --> 27:53.680]  Well, listen, if you think that the election system in this country is outdated, old, you're
[27:53.680 --> 27:54.680]  absolutely right.
[27:54.680 --> 27:59.560]  Pew study did a research into this, says it's a system plagued with errors and inefficiencies,
[27:59.560 --> 28:03.000]  but let me give you some numbers to really bring that home.
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.960]  According to Pew, 24 million people, one of every eight voter registrations in the U.S.
[28:07.960 --> 28:12.120]  are no longer valid or significantly inaccurate.
[28:12.120 --> 28:18.240]  More than 1.8 million dead people are listed as voters, so you could use that name.
[28:18.240 --> 28:19.240]  Go ahead and vote.
[28:19.240 --> 28:23.320]  Approximately 2.75 million people, two and three-quarter million people are registered
[28:23.320 --> 28:30.200]  in more than one state, so that outlines, I think, the possibility of voter fraud.
[28:30.200 --> 28:35.440]  Yeah, so you add that up, it's over 4 million, 20-plus million total, so you could sit there
[28:35.440 --> 28:40.240]  and look at the obituaries a month before and pick two or three people's names that
[28:40.240 --> 28:44.280]  you want, and then you could go in and try to vote, because most states don't make you
[28:44.280 --> 28:47.400]  have an ID, and if they say that's not on the roll, you say, well, I should be, you
[28:47.400 --> 28:51.640]  just go walk in another precinct and try another name, and you try a couple, you're gonna hit
[28:51.640 --> 28:52.640]  a voter.
[28:52.640 --> 28:56.080]  Now, that's how an individual can do it, it's very rare, but that's how an individual
[28:56.080 --> 28:59.600]  can do it, but if you're the Democratic Party, they have the computer databases, they have
[28:59.600 --> 29:01.400]  the voter rolls.
[29:01.400 --> 29:06.920]  Many times the Democratic Party has the county clerk, who's over all that working with them
[29:06.920 --> 29:07.920]  to carry out the fraud.
[29:07.920 --> 29:12.440]  In fact, that's generally who quarterbacks it, in my experience in Texas, is the county
[29:12.440 --> 29:15.640]  clerks, and it is a very dirty business indeed.
[29:15.640 --> 29:17.680]  Texas is famous for fraud.
[29:17.680 --> 29:22.600]  I'm proud of my state, but Texas probably has as much election fraud as even New York
[29:22.600 --> 29:27.000]  or Illinois, and they're the other king daddies of it.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.080]  But these are key battleground states, all these are big states because there's a large
[29:30.080 --> 29:35.240]  turnout and a large number of people, so they're big prizes too.
[29:35.240 --> 29:39.520]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to get into more facts for the president, who's never
[29:39.520 --> 29:44.280]  heard of election fraud and just has never heard of anyone saying we should check the
[29:44.280 --> 29:48.880]  integrity of our system, but that's all Trump's doing, is putting light on this so they don't
[29:48.880 --> 29:51.480]  get away with it, he's letting them know he's gonna contest.
[29:51.480 --> 29:58.080]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:21.480 --> 30:49.940]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, the empire's on the run.
[30:49.940 --> 30:52.100]  to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red.
[30:52.100 --> 30:54.500]  This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout,
[30:54.500 --> 30:56.100]  we can prove and provide the optics
[30:56.100 --> 30:58.180]  that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[30:58.180 --> 31:01.540]  Wear red on election day and make America great again.
[31:01.540 --> 31:03.540]  Brain Force, it's completely different.
[31:03.540 --> 31:04.780]  Try a bottle of it.
[31:04.780 --> 31:06.380]  Rob Dew joins us.
[31:06.380 --> 31:09.460]  You worked, I guess, like 20-plus hours.
[31:09.460 --> 31:10.580]  Tell us what Brain Force did.
[31:10.580 --> 31:11.580]  I've been working all day.
[31:11.580 --> 31:14.020]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[31:14.020 --> 31:16.020]  I get in here at 8.30.
[31:16.020 --> 31:17.380]  I was kind of run down.
[31:17.380 --> 31:19.260]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[31:19.260 --> 31:21.580]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[31:21.580 --> 31:23.020]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[31:23.020 --> 31:23.980]  I popped two of them.
[31:23.980 --> 31:25.980]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like,
[31:25.980 --> 31:28.380]  bing, everything just kind of clears up.
[31:28.380 --> 31:29.820]  It's got four and a half stars.
[31:29.820 --> 31:31.100]  People really love it.
[31:31.100 --> 31:32.620]  Read about it. Find out why.
[31:32.620 --> 31:35.580]  Third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[31:35.580 --> 31:39.100]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems
[31:39.100 --> 31:41.060]  that will blow your socks off.
[31:41.060 --> 31:42.580]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[31:42.580 --> 31:45.100]  but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[31:45.100 --> 31:47.460]  I went home about 6.45 this morning.
[31:47.460 --> 31:49.380]  I took three hours of sleep, got up,
[31:49.380 --> 31:51.420]  took two more Brain Force and came in.
[31:51.420 --> 31:54.980]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products
[31:54.980 --> 31:59.980]  at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[32:01.540 --> 32:03.420]  You know, in the coming election,
[32:03.420 --> 32:06.220]  no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues
[32:06.220 --> 32:08.620]  nobody's talking about in the debates or anywhere
[32:08.620 --> 32:10.940]  is the vulnerability of the power grid,
[32:10.940 --> 32:13.740]  the potential for power grid chaos.
[32:13.740 --> 32:17.820]  EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather,
[32:17.820 --> 32:19.580]  hurricanes, ice storms.
[32:19.580 --> 32:21.980]  All a very real threat to our grid.
[32:21.980 --> 32:23.900]  My friend's chaos is already here
[32:23.900 --> 32:25.180]  and it's gonna get a lot worse.
[32:25.180 --> 32:28.180]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have
[32:28.180 --> 32:31.180]  a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.
[32:31.180 --> 32:34.460]  Now I've got the perfect power solar generator system
[32:34.460 --> 32:35.300]  in my house.
[32:35.300 --> 32:36.980]  The solutions from science system.
[32:36.980 --> 32:39.540]  Simply put, this thing is amazing.
[32:39.540 --> 32:42.020]  Solutions from science only makes the best equipment.
[32:42.020 --> 32:44.780]  Go to powergridchaos.com.
[32:44.780 --> 32:47.860]  That's powergridchaos.com to check it out.
[32:47.860 --> 32:48.940]  Now this is key.

[32:51.220 --> 32:54.540]  They're top of the line, perfect power solar generator.

[32:56.500 --> 33:01.220]  Go to powergridchaos.com and get 70% off.
[33:01.220 --> 33:23.220]  All right, get ready because I'm gonna lay out the total proof
[33:23.220 --> 33:26.860]  of the conscious lying of the unified media
[33:26.860 --> 33:29.340]  that no one's ever heard of election fraud,
[33:29.340 --> 33:32.140]  that it's unprecedented what Donald Trump is doing
[33:32.140 --> 33:35.660]  and that it's just crazy to allege it even exists.
[33:35.660 --> 33:37.020]  I even forgot, I got another clip
[33:37.020 --> 33:38.940]  I didn't give you guys of Carvel.
[33:38.940 --> 33:41.540]  James Carvel going, well, of course there's fraud.
[33:41.540 --> 33:43.220]  Raging cases of course there's fraud.
[33:43.220 --> 33:45.420]  I mean, what do you think's going on here?
[33:47.780 --> 33:52.500]  It's just over the top that they're telling you,
[33:52.500 --> 33:53.540]  if you like what Donald Trump said,
[33:53.540 --> 33:55.740]  I'm worried about bank robberies.
[33:55.740 --> 33:57.380]  We need more police outside banks
[33:57.380 --> 33:59.660]  if there's been a slew of bank robberies, if he was a mayor
[33:59.660 --> 34:02.060]  and they go, well, that's just ridiculous.
[34:02.060 --> 34:04.220]  No one's ever heard of a bank robbery.
[34:04.220 --> 34:06.460]  Well, I see, I see, I see.
[34:07.620 --> 34:09.340]  Again, it's the way they talk to us
[34:09.340 --> 34:11.060]  like we're two years old.
[34:12.700 --> 34:14.540]  And not a very bright toddler either.
[34:19.540 --> 34:22.500]  Now, new news of Bill Clinton, mistresses and women
[34:22.500 --> 34:24.780]  he reportedly raped and amuses coming out.
[34:24.780 --> 34:26.300]  I mean, it is just getting crazy.
[34:26.300 --> 34:28.260]  But before we go there,
[34:28.260 --> 34:29.820]  want to thank the listeners for their support,
[34:29.820 --> 34:32.180]  for spreading the word for your prayers.
[34:32.180 --> 34:34.380]  Last night, I got a little bit mad a few times at Hillary
[34:34.380 --> 34:36.380]  and I'm very honest about it.
[34:36.380 --> 34:39.700]  And I don't claim to be a very Christ-like person in many ways.
[34:39.700 --> 34:42.820]  But I will say this, Christ went and made a scourge,
[34:42.820 --> 34:45.020]  basically a cat or nine tails,
[34:45.020 --> 34:46.900]  and went in and beat the money changers
[34:46.900 --> 34:48.780]  because they were so corrupted, overturned the tables
[34:48.780 --> 34:50.700]  and basically kicked their butts.
[34:50.700 --> 34:51.780]  And I'm not calling for violence.
[34:51.780 --> 34:53.300]  I'm saying at a certain point,
[34:53.300 --> 34:55.180]  we have to overturn the tables.
[34:55.180 --> 34:58.220]  We have to stop being calm and putting up with all this.
[35:00.180 --> 35:02.220]  And so sometimes I get a little bit ashamed
[35:02.220 --> 35:03.580]  of how I act on air.
[35:03.580 --> 35:05.700]  Everybody seemed to love it actually.
[35:05.700 --> 35:08.420]  When I started calling Hillary a lying whore.
[35:08.420 --> 35:10.500]  And it's not nice to ladies of the night
[35:10.500 --> 35:11.900]  that compared to a lot of professions,
[35:11.900 --> 35:13.420]  it's pretty honorable.
[35:13.420 --> 35:15.660]  Honorable when compared to say a globalist
[35:15.660 --> 35:19.500]  or one of these New World Order banker types.
[35:19.500 --> 35:21.860]  Or people that sell cluster bombs to drop on kids.
[35:21.860 --> 35:25.380]  But when I say a whore, I mean a whore of Babylon.
[35:26.220 --> 35:27.980]  And they make jokes and go, oh look, he's crazy.
[35:27.980 --> 35:30.220]  He's not an atheist like us, pinheads.
[35:30.220 --> 35:35.060]  He's making literary connections to archetypal evil.
[35:35.060 --> 35:36.300]  That's exactly what I mean.
[35:36.300 --> 35:38.340]  I consider all day enlist her crimes,
[35:38.340 --> 35:39.420]  the horrible things she's done,
[35:39.420 --> 35:42.700]  smirking like a big plastic jack-o-lantern demon.
[35:42.700 --> 35:44.820]  I mean, her face is a horror movie cover.
[35:44.820 --> 35:47.460]  Every time we talk about dead kids or radical Islam
[35:47.460 --> 35:50.220]  and her supporting it or depression and war,
[35:50.220 --> 35:53.980]  that big demon face would come on that gives me the willies.
[35:54.900 --> 35:57.580]  I'll be honest, Hillary Clinton scares me.
[35:57.580 --> 36:00.580]  And by scares me, I'm not physically scared of her.
[36:02.180 --> 36:04.060]  Knowing that type of evil exists,
[36:04.060 --> 36:05.500]  gives me the willies is what I'm saying.
[36:05.500 --> 36:10.500]  I am repulsed by her like when you open a drawer up
[36:10.740 --> 36:13.700]  and a black widow comes out and almost bites you.
[36:13.700 --> 36:15.900]  You're like, I mean, I guess I am scared of her.
[36:15.900 --> 36:18.120]  But it's like a repulsion.
[36:18.120 --> 36:20.680]  She's a revolting person and her minions
[36:20.680 --> 36:24.120]  are revolting, stunted demonic idiots.
[36:24.120 --> 36:27.160]  And I consider all day enlist her crimes and we do it.
[36:27.160 --> 36:29.320]  But at the end of the day, I've just got to be honest
[36:29.320 --> 36:32.720]  and get the poison out and just say how I feel about her.
[36:32.720 --> 36:34.240]  People could call me mean all day.
[36:34.240 --> 36:35.960]  I'm not carpet bombing countries.
[36:35.960 --> 36:37.840]  I'm not selling out missile secrets to China.
[36:37.840 --> 36:40.920]  I'm not funding radical Wahhabis to enslave millions of women
[36:40.920 --> 36:43.920]  and put little eight-year-old girls and six-year-old girls
[36:43.920 --> 36:45.720]  by the thousands into sex slavery.
[36:45.720 --> 36:49.240]  I mean, these radical Muslims she's funding and supporting
[36:49.240 --> 36:54.240]  are the nastiest, craziest, evilest people I've ever heard of.
[36:54.240 --> 36:59.240]  I mean, they're worse than stuff out of nightmare novels.
[37:00.440 --> 37:03.520]  They're horrible and they're oppressive
[37:03.520 --> 37:06.840]  and they just are everything that the West
[37:06.840 --> 37:09.080]  and the Renaissance stands against.
[37:09.080 --> 37:10.920]  And that's why the West and the Renaissance
[37:10.920 --> 37:13.280]  has to be pissed on by the mainstream media all day
[37:13.280 --> 37:16.160]  and told how we're the guilty ones and we're the bad ones
[37:16.160 --> 37:19.280]  because they know we are altruistic on average
[37:19.280 --> 37:22.280]  and care and want to build and want to have freedom
[37:22.280 --> 37:23.760]  and the globalists don't want that.
[37:23.760 --> 37:26.880]  That's why they're allied with the most twisted, dirty,
[37:26.880 --> 37:31.880]  backward, fetid, scruffy-less, filled, flaky Islam.
[37:31.880 --> 37:34.880]  Now, before I go any further
[37:36.880 --> 37:38.880]  and get into the big news here and these clips
[37:38.880 --> 37:40.880]  and all this big presentation we've got ready,
[37:40.880 --> 37:42.880]  as I said, I want to thank the listeners of the broadcast.
[37:42.880 --> 37:44.880]  I want to thank you for your support.
[37:44.880 --> 37:47.880]  We're only able to do all this because of your support,
[37:47.880 --> 37:49.880]  but it's a win-win.
[37:49.880 --> 37:51.880]  We've really developed time and space
[37:51.880 --> 37:53.880]  and we've got a lot of time and space
[37:53.880 --> 37:55.880]  and we've got a lot of time and space
[37:55.880 --> 37:57.880]  and we've got a lot of time and space
[37:57.880 --> 37:59.880]  and we've got a lot of time and space
[37:59.880 --> 38:01.880]  and it's a win-win.
[38:01.880 --> 38:03.880]  We've really developed top of the line暮physauticles.
[38:03.880 --> 38:05.880]  We've really developed a lot of great T-shirts
[38:05.880 --> 38:07.880]  to spread the word, Molaulabe, anti-New World Order shirts,
[38:07.880 --> 38:09.880]  Hillerford Prison shirts, you name it.
[38:09.880 --> 38:11.880]  We're selling those right now at cost.
[38:11.880 --> 38:13.880]  Those shirts will be gone.
[38:13.880 --> 38:15.880]  This is the last run of those.
[38:15.880 --> 38:17.880]  We have the new Trump is My President shirt,
[38:17.880 --> 38:19.880]  an all-red shirt to wear on election day

[38:21.880 --> 38:23.880]  that we understand what's happening.
[38:23.880 --> 38:25.880]  Totally freaked about in Cleveland and other areas
[38:25.880 --> 38:27.880]  when a third of the folks were wearing

[39:37.800 --> 39:43.200]  To pass California standards and then a lot of times nobody can hardly do that with one ingredient much less 20 something
[39:43.200 --> 39:46.240]  So then we have keep sending stuff back until we get it at those standards
[39:46.240 --> 39:51.600]  And so I'm talking about changing the formula so there's so many things in it. That's what makes it good as it has many things in it
[39:52.120 --> 39:57.400]  But it's you know, it's hard to make something like this. It's like if you don't get the right grapes, you don't get the right wine
[39:57.400 --> 40:02.120]  I mean, we will sell no wine before it's time. Well, something like living defense a complex formulation

[40:22.340 --> 40:24.340]  You know, we've had too much brain force
[40:24.580 --> 40:31.820]  And then there's so many other great products like DNA for survival shield X to secret 12. Oh, and don't forget cuz I'm gonna take something right now
[40:33.740 --> 40:40.340]  Selenium the neuron fire you die without it and the deficiencies are in most people the government keeps lowering the level
[40:40.340 --> 40:42.340]  They say you need let me tell you something
[40:42.340 --> 40:48.180]  Selenium is the bomb and we have the bio true selenium from the mighty mustard seed
[40:49.060 --> 40:51.060]  Take a more right now
[40:52.140 --> 40:57.860]  Talk about energy now, it's different different people, but I personally get more energy from selenium that I do from even
[40:59.100 --> 41:02.300]  Brain force, but it varies for everybody. You know what I mean?
[41:02.700 --> 41:04.700]  That's I mean, that's just how the metabolic systems work
[41:04.900 --> 41:10.820]  So check out all the products the bottom line your funding or operation and you know that that's having a huge effect out there
[41:10.820 --> 41:13.460]  So it's a total win 361, but thank you for your prayers
[41:13.580 --> 41:20.100]  Thank you for support and more in fourslife.com or 888-253-3139 and in closing I
[41:21.100 --> 41:24.300]  Want to encourage everybody to become sponsors for local affiliates
[41:25.620 --> 41:32.180]  Support local sponsors let them know why spread the word about that station and quite frankly volunteer for the station if you can give
[41:32.180 --> 41:37.500]  My donation because there's a war to shut down talk radio award to get true Patriots off radio right now
[41:37.500 --> 41:42.580]  And we're growing on the number of stations because our listeners are supporting them and the ratings are very very good
[41:42.580 --> 41:47.420]  Even on smaller stations within a year or so we defeat the bigger stations in the area
[41:47.420 --> 41:51.460]  Then a phenomenon happens once the ratings go up they come in and buy out the airtime and put on
[41:51.980 --> 41:57.180]  ESPN or other things, but that is a phenomenon. In fact, we're well known for that now. That's the formula
[41:58.140 --> 42:00.180]  That's exactly what people have done all over the country
[42:00.180 --> 42:06.820]  So I don't care a lot of people get on a station about a year the ratings go from nowhere to number one or number two and then
[42:06.820 --> 42:08.820]  They sell the time out
[42:09.420 --> 42:11.980]  But that's whatever it takes for folks to survive
[42:13.020 --> 42:17.060]  But we're changing the world together right now. It's a very very special time to be alive
[42:17.060 --> 42:21.300]  So I want to thank everybody out there for supporting our local affiliates. Thank you now
[42:25.540 --> 42:30.980]  It frustrates me at a very deep level that mainstream media is
[42:30.980 --> 42:35.940]  Organized against the American people, but the good news is they've been so brazen so naked so
[42:37.740 --> 42:42.620]  Open about it that their ratings have gone from horrible to almost non-existent
[42:42.620 --> 42:45.980]  I mean they are facades now and the establishment
[42:46.500 --> 42:52.340]  Combines like Carlos Slim, you know the global kingpin of Mexico just props up the New York Times
[42:52.460 --> 42:56.300]  They admittedly loses tons of money every year. I mean the thing is a joke
[42:56.300 --> 43:04.100]  But it has all this so-called fake prestige, but only with the most uneducated and want to be trendies
[43:04.380 --> 43:06.380]  Not with the educated anymore
[43:06.500 --> 43:08.500]  They know it's a joke
[43:08.780 --> 43:11.900]  But but but with want to be intellectuals and liberals
[43:11.900 --> 43:15.980]  It still is the gold standard and it's a bellwether of everything else
[43:15.980 --> 43:21.580]  But it is sinking fast and that's their own doing so are they backing off of a deception? No
[43:21.820 --> 43:24.160]  The New York Times even writes articles we've read on air
[43:24.160 --> 43:29.640]  Where they say we're no longer even gonna act like we're not bias and
[43:30.640 --> 43:33.360]  Then I see them on CNN MSNBC they'll announce
[43:34.680 --> 43:36.680]  Well, you know
[43:37.560 --> 43:42.600]  This is the year that we showed our bias and we're right to show our bias cuz Donald Trump's an evil races blah blah blah
[43:42.600 --> 43:46.320]  As if we needed you to tell us that you were biased all these years
[43:47.040 --> 43:48.720]  Again, that's how
[43:48.720 --> 43:53.480]  Delusional you are you were hired because you were followers you were hired because you read off a teleprompter
[43:53.480 --> 43:56.640]  You were hired because you were narcissists that wanted to look at yourself in the mirror
[43:58.040 --> 44:01.800]  You are nothing but repeaters you're nothing but meat puppets, okay
[44:02.800 --> 44:08.320]  You're a joke, but you're the perfect delusionites to go then try to push your delusion on the rest of us
[44:08.320 --> 44:12.480]  It's not working. So so here's Obama saying there's no such thing as election fraud
[44:13.400 --> 44:15.400]  And the Trump should stop whining
[44:15.480 --> 44:19.920]  Well, all of the surrogates and Hillary Clinton are running around saying the Russians are trying to hack the election
[44:19.920 --> 44:24.840]  So we've got to federalize it and in the same speech he said there's nobody involved in local elections
[44:24.840 --> 44:27.240]  The feds aren't involved when they've announced they're federalizing them
[44:27.960 --> 44:35.960]  Again, they really think you're stupid and I guess this election is a referendum on is the public really this gullible and this dumb
[44:35.960 --> 44:38.840]  Or really just wants to get on a moron bandwagon
[44:39.920 --> 44:41.920]  Here's the president
[44:41.920 --> 44:52.480]  But but the larger point that I want to emphasize here is that there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that
[44:53.400 --> 44:57.600]  You could even you could even rig America's elections
[44:59.080 --> 45:04.560]  In part because they're so decentralized and the numbers of votes involved
[45:04.560 --> 45:08.520]  There's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that
[45:08.520 --> 45:13.960]  There are instances in which that will happen this time and so
[45:14.640 --> 45:19.280]  I'd advise mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes
[45:20.960 --> 45:22.960]  We have the leader of
[45:24.200 --> 45:26.200]  People from American Way
[45:27.240 --> 45:34.760]  That you know we're battling Joe McCarthy back in the day same old suspects and his national coordinator on video
[45:34.760 --> 45:42.520]  Saying we're going to effing do what we always do and have people vote ten times a piece busting them around and the police aren't gonna stop us
[45:42.520 --> 45:46.840]  And the courts are gonna stop us. We got the Justice Department. Should I play those clips again? I already played him yesterday
[45:47.160 --> 45:50.160]  Everybody knows about it on this show nowhere on Main Street media though
[45:50.960 --> 45:53.840]  By the way, James O'Keefe joining us today a project Veritas
[45:55.120 --> 45:58.760]  See I don't get excited around Hollywood stars folks, but I get excited was my like James O'Keefe
[45:58.760 --> 46:07.400]  Drudge or these are heroes man. These are these are the real deal now. He's coming up get excited here schoolgirl now
[46:08.640 --> 46:10.040]  Here's just a short compilation
[46:10.040 --> 46:16.480]  We're putting together bigger ones right now of the Democrats freaking out about election fraud that remember doesn't exist like in 2000
[46:17.560 --> 46:24.160]  The thing that is most animated this election on the Democratic side has been the sense of a rigged system
[46:24.160 --> 46:30.680]  The game is rigged against them. So there's a sense the game is rigged if this is what a rigged economy about a rigged system
[46:30.680 --> 46:33.880]  They'll do anything to read the system to both the top of the game is
[46:34.680 --> 46:41.480]  Against a lot of people who have done the devil level best that the system is rigged people say the game is
[46:41.880 --> 46:48.480]  Keeps the system rigged for those at the top the system is rigged their obstruction is keeping a system that is rigged the game
[46:48.480 --> 46:55.560]  Is rigged we must fix an economy in America that is rigged the game is rigged
[46:55.560 --> 47:02.560]  And it's not right a rigged economy game is rigged and the economy is rigged
[47:02.560 --> 47:07.840]  The American people know that the system is rigged against the system rigged against the middle class
[47:07.840 --> 47:14.640]  All I know it is it is rigged and it's still too many people feel like the system is rigged people say
[47:14.640 --> 47:23.000]  The game is rigged how the game is rigged or economy is rigged people feel like the system is rigged against them
[47:23.640 --> 47:25.640]  And here's the painful part
[47:26.560 --> 47:29.800]  They're right, you know the system folks is
[47:30.800 --> 47:34.840]  And he goes on to say the system's rigged now that's them saying the system's rigged
[47:34.840 --> 47:39.680]  But we have all the clips of them talking about election fraud and the problem of that and again
[47:39.680 --> 47:44.240]  We're getting a bunch of clips together of them talking about the Russians trying to rig the election specifically the election
[47:44.240 --> 47:50.200]  And Jay Johnson saying he's federalizing the election, but everybody knows who's informed they've done that they've announced it
[47:50.200 --> 47:56.480]  We've played those clips now next some people are starting to argue that there wasn't of an election fought over in
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.120]  2000 there was Al Gore contested it it went to the Supreme Court
[48:00.640 --> 48:05.040]  Remember the hanging chads all that stuff. They'd like you to think that never happened
[48:05.720 --> 48:08.640]  So here we already pledged you pure research earlier
[48:08.640 --> 48:14.720]  Admitting 20 something million people that shouldn't be on the voting rolls for million that we know the Democrats are manipulating
[48:14.880 --> 48:22.080]  So flashback Gore refuses to concede election demands recount to ensure all the votes are counted that happened
[48:22.760 --> 48:24.760]  show
[48:24.800 --> 48:29.800]  Obama says he's never heard of a candidate saying anything like this in US history. What about
[48:29.800 --> 48:36.600]  16 years ago my friend again, he thinks you're a moron. Here's Al Gore
[48:40.400 --> 48:41.800]  Well
[48:41.800 --> 48:46.200]  the the the effort I have underway is simply to make sure
[48:47.080 --> 48:49.240]  that that all the votes are counted and
[48:50.120 --> 48:51.880]  when the
[48:51.880 --> 48:57.960]  when the issues that are now being considered in the Florida Supreme Court are
[48:57.960 --> 49:02.520]  Are are decided that'll that'll be an important point
[49:03.240 --> 49:06.480]  But I don't want to speculate on what the Florida Supreme Court
[49:09.560 --> 49:11.560]  So that happened now
[49:11.960 --> 49:18.720]  Joe Scarborough, why do I not like Joe Scarborough? Because I know like newton rich. He's very smart. You know, it's exactly what's going on
[49:19.440 --> 49:23.120]  He's not stupid. He's on a show with the daughter of the bigger presents
[49:23.120 --> 49:28.240]  He was one of the most evil men alive in the world it according to himself. He writes books bragging about it
[49:28.400 --> 49:30.240]  but how, you know
[49:30.240 --> 49:36.360]  All the horrible things he's done and world government how we're stupid and how the government brings in the drugs and controls organized crime
[49:36.360 --> 49:39.880]  And how that's a good thing. I mean go read his books. I'm digressing
[49:39.880 --> 49:44.720]  The reason I get mad at Scarborough is he'll say something totally true one day and then reverse it a week later
[49:44.720 --> 49:48.720]  But what he's saying in this next clip is pure veritas. It's true
[49:48.720 --> 49:56.280]  That the Democrats are running around acting like they've never heard somebody say I'm concerned about an election when they're are the ones that always scream the loudest
[49:56.280 --> 49:59.200]  But again goes to their arrogance
[50:01.240 --> 50:07.440]  That's what Kelly and Conway said I don't quite understand what Mayor Julian is referring to but this is all this all happened after the race
[50:07.440 --> 50:16.680]  Right in addition Al Gore accepted the outcome of the Supreme Court decision and my understanding is that from what Mr. Trump is saying he may not be willing to accept the outcome
[50:16.680 --> 50:18.680]  He may not be willing to accept the outcome
[50:19.880 --> 50:21.880]  What was the exact quote
[50:22.280 --> 50:24.980]  He said I'll look at it at the time. I'll look at it at the time
[50:25.480 --> 50:31.120]  So that means he's not willing to say I will accept the outcome if you are some know what that means is you'll look at it at the time
[50:31.120 --> 50:37.040]  I love everybody saying, you know, I woke up in these screaming headlines saying Donald Trump will not respect election results
[50:37.040 --> 50:39.000]  He actually said I'll look at it at the time
[50:39.000 --> 50:45.800]  I'll see has ever been a presidential candidate to say that if they're voting your regularities then I any presidential candidate of anybody
[50:45.800 --> 50:50.360]  What would you have said we would all stand here and say that what would your response to be to that question?
[50:50.360 --> 50:54.400]  I said, yeah, I certainly I'll certainly respect the outcome of the election
[50:54.400 --> 50:58.880]  I of course will want to make sure that he didn't say that I will want to make sure that it's fair and something up and up
[50:58.880 --> 51:02.640]  This is just say that yeah, but you know what this is an example the media got something
[51:02.640 --> 51:08.840]  They can absolutely freak out about and claim that he's an agent of Vladimir Putin and destroying democracy in America
[51:08.840 --> 51:14.160]  And it's just another example of the media having to find a little phrase and freak out
[51:14.160 --> 51:21.040]  So he's when I say Republican I have listened to Democrats talk about the only two times
[51:21.040 --> 51:25.640]  We won the White House in like 800 years that we stole both elections
[51:25.640 --> 51:32.720]  I had to sit through fair in the height 9-1-1 and a lady was sobbing violently behind me on the Upper West side
[51:32.960 --> 51:38.880]  About the election being stolen from George Bush and I patted her halfway through it. It's all right. It's all right, ma'am
[51:38.880 --> 51:46.600]  But it's all right. It's all a lie anyway Democrats have been whining for 16 years
[51:46.600 --> 51:50.440]  They're still writing articles about how Bush stole the elections in
[51:50.960 --> 51:57.280]  2000 and 2004 so this holier-than-thou attitude about this is the first time anyone has suggested
[51:57.280 --> 52:02.200]  That the election is not a sacrosanct process. It's a joke
[52:02.200 --> 52:07.960]  So you guys bathe in that hypocrisy if you want to I'd just like to hear out the debate when go ahead
[52:07.960 --> 52:12.760]  But you can't you can't the difference is what Michael just said. It's the candidate himself
[52:12.760 --> 52:20.280]  You will have spectators voters political officials elected officials all contemplating writers saying that this didn't happen this way
[52:20.280 --> 52:27.720]  They stole it Bush did this but you did never have so let me do very specific my heart. It's my target this morning
[52:28.360 --> 52:34.640]  For for my mockery are the very people that are writing articles today on their blogs
[52:34.640 --> 52:41.720]  That are saying this is a threat to democracy the electoral process in America is sacrosanct
[52:41.720 --> 52:48.920]  And if we ever doubt this are we no better than Putin? I mean that's those are the people I mocked and see I'm not
[52:50.920 --> 52:53.440]  All right now let's get to the meat and potatoes here
[52:53.800 --> 53:00.040]  This is unprecedented to have him 20 something days out now 18 days out, but he was doing this months ago
[53:00.760 --> 53:02.760]  Because he's not stupid
[53:02.760 --> 53:04.760]  It's unprecedented to have them trigger
[53:05.800 --> 53:13.780]  regulations that the RNC and DNC created corporately in 1972 and 1976 respectively
[53:16.120 --> 53:17.400]  Respectively
[53:17.400 --> 53:23.600]  To say if we ever don't like a candidate will ignore the popular will of the voters and the delegates of the primary
[53:23.600 --> 53:29.560]  And we will appoint that person and George will coming out saying a mere plurality of voters doesn't matter
[53:29.560 --> 53:31.560]  It is the sovereign party
[53:31.560 --> 53:32.920]  I
[53:32.920 --> 53:35.720]  Thought they were about to start playing God save the Queen
[53:36.080 --> 53:43.480]  He actually said it was the it is the will and the sovereignty of the party not a mere plurality of voters
[53:43.480 --> 53:47.120]  He wrote that for the Washington Post. They were all over TV saying
[53:47.600 --> 53:53.240]  Your vote doesn't count and so the commentator would say so you're saying the vote doesn't count and don't vote the primary
[53:53.240 --> 53:58.400]  Yes, we should even have primaries the party decides everybody went excuse me their election laws
[53:58.400 --> 54:01.640]  You are just guardians of this. You're not allowed to do that
[54:01.640 --> 54:05.840]  Let's go ahead and challenge that and because he is a leader because he should be president
[54:06.760 --> 54:08.920]  he came out Donald Trump and
[54:10.320 --> 54:15.040]  Said I'm gonna contest you trying to steal the nomination from me when they would celebrate
[54:15.920 --> 54:21.840]  Voterless victories in Colorado and other states and the media was like how dare drudge get involved in the election again
[54:21.840 --> 54:26.560]  We need to have the federal election commission shut drudge down and in full wars, too
[54:26.560 --> 54:32.080]  Remember that because they're putting up headlines that say another voterless victory for Ted Cruz
[54:33.200 --> 54:41.200]  Well, there weren't votes. They were just announcing. Oh, we're canceling the election now. We're canceling the primary the party says it's Ted Cruz or
[54:41.880 --> 54:48.000]  He wins Louisiana or he wins all these other states and then they give the delegates to Ted Cruz the same thing
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  They did to Bernie Sanders for Hillary
[54:50.360 --> 54:56.120]  But Bernie didn't do he rolled over like a good little socialist, didn't he and got given a big lake house and a book deal and
[54:56.120 --> 55:01.760]  More goodies for his wife who helped bankrupt and suck the university drive. She ran these people are locust
[55:02.400 --> 55:06.920]  Just look at him. It's just flop around all day conning good people
[55:08.240 --> 55:11.160]  but just scam artists around all day long and so
[55:11.960 --> 55:16.000]  You've got him rolling over on all his constituents laughing at him and
[55:17.000 --> 55:21.280]  Guess what? Donald J. Trump didn't do that. Did he that's what's unprecedented
[55:21.280 --> 55:26.000]  And so he knows that they already tried to steal it. He fought for it. So he got it
[55:26.480 --> 55:31.440]  And so now he's gonna fight for it again. And so are we and listen you little con artists
[55:31.440 --> 55:34.240]  You can't stand the fact your con games don't work on us
[55:34.800 --> 55:40.320]  You can't stand the fact that we know your your health care law was a scam meant to bankrupt things
[55:40.320 --> 55:43.200]  It's down the wiki leaks. You can't stand straight shooters
[55:43.520 --> 55:50.000]  But guess what we're coming and people like myself and Donald Trump. We're just the front line of this
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.720]  There's so much more coming behind us. We're never gonna stop. You just woke up the sleeping giant
[55:54.720 --> 55:58.080]  You're gonna get your ass kicked forever now. You understand that?
[55:58.640 --> 56:04.080]  Nothing's gonna stop us. We're gonna fight you. We're gonna expose you. We got your number
[56:05.280 --> 56:08.640]  Let's play the leader Donald Trump
[56:09.120 --> 56:10.640]  Say one other thing
[56:10.640 --> 56:12.640]  She shouldn't be allowed to run
[56:12.640 --> 56:17.120]  It's crook. She's she's guilty of a very very serious crime
[56:17.120 --> 56:24.640]  She should not be allowed to run and just in that respect. I say it's rigged because she should never
[56:24.640 --> 56:32.400]  Chris she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with emails and so many other things
[56:32.400 --> 56:34.400]  But sir, there is a tradition in this country
[56:34.720 --> 56:41.600]  In fact, one of the prizes of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard for what a campaign is
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  that at the end of the campaign
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.360]  That the loser concedes to the winner not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner
[56:49.600 --> 56:55.200]  But that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country
[56:55.520 --> 57:00.400]  Are you saying you're not prepared now to come down to that principle? What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time
[57:00.400 --> 57:02.400]  I'll keep you in suspense
[57:04.320 --> 57:08.720]  And of course before that he went into the four million people on the voter rolls is actually 21 million
[57:08.960 --> 57:11.360]  And he went into the folks that shouldn't be able to vote
[57:11.360 --> 57:16.000]  And he went into the folks that shouldn't be able to vote and he went into all the stuff going on
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  But I would have just said lady
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.560]  You shouldn't even be here. You stole the nomination from sanders. He would have destroyed them and
[57:23.760 --> 57:26.960]  The republicans were going to take it away from me even though I had the delegates
[57:27.360 --> 57:30.240]  Of course, I'm saying we need to watch out for being rigged
[57:30.960 --> 57:33.680]  If you've got a neighbor next to you you caught breaking into your house three times
[57:34.160 --> 57:37.520]  Did you start watching that neighbor and saying, you know, he got out of jail again?
[57:37.520 --> 57:41.440]  Keep the garage door locked. We need to move out of this neighborhood
[57:42.800 --> 57:45.120]  We had to move out of the neighborhood once because it was one family down the street
[57:45.200 --> 57:49.760]  Their kid was always going to jail and stuff. He was robbing everybody's houses TVs jewelry. You name it?
[57:52.320 --> 57:55.920]  My dad one time came home from work and saw him with one of our bicycles down the street
[57:56.240 --> 57:58.240]  Came and said give the bicycle back his dad
[57:58.400 --> 58:02.480]  I guess came out threatening stuff and some things happened. But the point is that
[58:03.600 --> 58:05.760]  This is the type of stuff that goes on in this country
[58:05.760 --> 58:11.920]  And and and we've seen hillary with the bicycle in our garage putting her fat ass on it
[58:12.480 --> 58:17.040]  Right and we're like, listen, that's our bicycle lady. She's like, you never had a bicycle. This isn't a bicycle
[58:17.120 --> 58:21.840]  This isn't the bicycle you're looking for racist racist racist. It doesn't work anymore
[58:22.560 --> 58:28.000]  You stole it from bernie sanders in front of god in the world. You tried to steal it from trump
[58:29.280 --> 58:34.400]  We don't have memories of goldfish. I mean the general public does but what what are you gonna do about the rest of us?
[58:34.400 --> 58:39.520]  I mean, we know you're a pack of degenerate scumbag criminals. Okay, that isn't rhetoric
[58:39.600 --> 58:45.760]  You are an organized racketeering operation the mainstream media the big banks the democrats the republican leaders
[58:45.840 --> 58:50.400]  You're all going to present. That's the truth. So get ready to get your asses locked up

[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:14.960]  I
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:32.960]  Live from austin texas broadcasting
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.800]  That's jr. Brown bringing us in
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.800]  I
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.400]  Do love me some rockabilly surf music
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.400]  This is what I listen to relax
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:59.200]  I got a whole album of this 20 songs that beautiful still guitar
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.720]  Good stuff
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:11.280]  All right, nothing join it. Let's get back into the fight for liberty
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.760]  Some good music to drive your car across the desert in
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.720]  Okay, uh, we've got uh
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.800]  Russia taunts us with biggest military offensive since the cold war
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:35.520]  I love how our media spends that. I mean, I don't want a war with Russia. Okay
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.040]  And the fact is the west is trying to overthrow their country
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.600]  Soros is trying to overthrow it internally
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.520]  With the same culture warfare garbage and anti police riots
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.080]  And you're like, what are you sticking up for the police for?
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.520]  It's their country. You can't have foreigners try to overthrow your government starting riots
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.240]  I mean, that's espionage people and that's what's going on by these globalist
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.080]  And they've got this giant fleet going now through the the English Channel
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.120]  And it's just the whole thing is deteriorating quickly
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.480]  Now we've got huge project veritas news breaking coming up with James O'Keefe
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.360]  At the start of the next segment but first just getting into mind control getting into how they talk to us like we're idiots and say
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.680]  There's no such thing as election fraud, even though they're the biggest people bitching about it like Al Gore
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.760]  Donna Brazil freaks out after Megan Kelly ask how she got debate question in advance
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.920]  And I like the fact Megan Kelly's trying to rehabilitate herself now and actually being a journalist, but
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:38.800]  Seeing in admits that this is the question was sent. They won't say exactly who they've been caught the email's real and this woman sits there and tries to play dumb
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.640]  And if you're a radio listener, you can't see Donna Brazil
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.280]  But I mean
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.200]  She just
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.200]  Is unbelievably arrogant
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.840]  And has the deadest eyes. I think I've ever seen so let's go ahead and play that clip
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.840]  So let's go ahead and play that club
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:02.560]  You say that you say you say that you play that you play straight up, but I have to ask you because you were accused
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:08.400]  But you were accused of receiving a debate question before a cnn town hall where they partnered with tv1
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:12.640]  And that that you had this question on on march 12th
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:19.680]  The that verbatim verbatim was provided by roland martin to cnn the next day
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.080]  How did you get that question donna?
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.840]  Well, Kelly since I play straight up and I'll play straight up with you
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:32.320]  Uh, I did not receive any questions from cnn. Let's just be very clear
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.120]  Where did you get it?
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:42.000]  First of all, what information are you providing to me that that will allow me to see what what you're talking about?
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.040]  Everybody you got the winky leaks released a march 12th
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:52.400]  Padesta email showing you messaging the clinton campaign with the exact wording of a question asked at the march 13th
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.080]  cnn tv1 town hall debate. Kelly. Where did you get it?
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.280]  You know as a christian woman, I understand persecution
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.040]  But I will not sit here and be persecuted because your information is totally false
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:09.920]  What you're what you're getting from padesta's email what what you're what what you're well padesta's emails were stolen
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:16.160]  You're so interested in talking about so you deny you like you you're like a thief that want to bring into the night
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.480]  The things that you found that was in the gutter
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.320]  You're a thief
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.880]  Notice she triggered liberation theology taught by the ford foundation all over the world
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.320]  To create race war based on the christian religion
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.560]  But but the general public would know that she was activating folks saying i'm a christian
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.800]  I know about being persecuted
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:42.400]  And that was bringing up the entire slave experience which they they want to re-project as a new trauma
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.120]  every time there's a problem
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.440]  So what she was brought race in there
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.880]  The fact is she's getting the questions beforehand. It's all rigged
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.080]  It's all coming out singing and admits it and she's sitting there playing dumb about getting the questions to hillary
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.640]  Back during the democrat debates
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.120]  It's amazing
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:06.160]  We're red on election day perhaps the biggest election in american history is just days away
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:12.960]  We know that in past elections there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election fraud from dead people voting to people registering
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:13.760]  false
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.840]  Identifications to government leaders providing fast-track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes. This is happening right in front of us
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:26.320]  Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the republican nominee donald trump government chills are campaigning for clinton
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:32.800]  Mainstream news attacking donald trump all day like rabbit hounds rigged pools being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:39.280]  That hillary clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting trump fake celebrities endorsing clinton across all platforms
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.720]  So with all this what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen?
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.800]  What can we do to prevent election fraud?
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.880]  I propose that all donald trump supporters wear red on election day on november 8th
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:54.400]  When you head to the polls to vote donald trump be decked out in red this way just as we dominated in rally turnout
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:01.040]  We can prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout wear red on election day and make america great again
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.040]  There was a mighty nation
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:10.240]  Blessed above all of creation charlie daniels. He's always loved america. He's always defended the second amendment
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:17.040]  Let me let me just read a little thing here from a gender point one the american system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.960]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat do the collective
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.200]  Or you know what the next move is gonna be don't you it's gonna become after you're done. Oh, yeah
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.520]  I tell you it ain't gonna sit well down my way
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:34.880]  At all it ain't gonna sit well. Do you ever wonder what happened to america? It's time to ride boys. We need a thousand paul reveres
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.320]  When i was a boy
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:43.120]  It was okay to be proud of the flag heritage mom and apple pie and beef was for supper

[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:28.080]  Well, there are few people that I can actually tell the audience
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.040]  That we would be in a
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.440]  Situation five times worse if it wasn't for them
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.480]  There are only a few of those people and one of them is james o' keith
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.080]  And he is an example even though he doesn't like me saying this
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:48.480]  To everybody else on how you can go out and take on these criminals and and the stalwart dogged
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:55.760]  Determination is the stuff of americana and the stuff of legend and i'm always saying that because he gets demonized
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.840]  He gets dogged. He gets attacked. He gets lied about he gets arrested
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.280]  Fighting true organized crime real organized crime
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:11.280]  And he deserves our prayers and project veritas deserves your financial support. You should get his book the chronicles all this
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.720]  I know we didn't want to come on talk about himself, but there's three big things to cover today
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.720]  a the mainstream corporate media is
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.720]  Totally blacking out
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.720]  The reports he's putting out that are the biggest in their storied history
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.240]  Bringing down acorn you name it on and on and on
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:33.760]  This is the biggest stuff in my view. I mean he has top democratic officials top operatives saying we're stupid
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:39.280]  Top operatives saying we're stealing elections. We're engaged in election fraud. We're busting people around we're gonna do it
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.280]  We're above the law. He's got
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:48.160]  The newest info sending people in to bully women so they could stage events where trump
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:53.520]  Uh security then has to restrain women. I mean you talk about setups
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:59.360]  This is such dirty tricks red-handed and there was trump bringing it up last night pointing right at hillary
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.800]  So the censorship the big bombshells. He's breaking new bombshells to come 18 days out
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:10.480]  James oakheap is our guest at the bottom of the hour. I want to give you his website project veritas.com
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.120]  But we never single people out and say these folks deserve support
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.360]  Let me tell you what they're doing deserve support. I want to thank our listeners for supporting us
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.920]  but bottom line
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.840]  Because of your support where we're able to have a fighting chance
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.960]  Against these criminals and it's it's wiki leaks. It's James oakheap. It's drudge. It's info wars
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.480]  It's bright mart and a few other groups and it's you the people that are with us. You're not behind us
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.200]  You're you're at the heart of what we do and what let's just understand that I salute you as well
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:46.480]  Because it's important to understand this is a war and the mainstream media is not gonna pat you on the back folks for all you've done
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:52.480]  Well, I am so James oakheap. I know you're fighting hard right now and working with your great team across the country
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.920]  But wow, what an amazing time to be alive. You've got the floor
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.960]  I mean, where do you want to start first the blackout the latest info your your your newest revelation?
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  I just want to say alex that
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.400]  Last night when we were brought up
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:12.720]  By dallas trump at the debate. It was one small step for my team and one giant leap for citizen journalism
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.320]  I mean what you saw in the last 48 hours
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.680]  Twitter twitter by the way removed me then reinstated me
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.840]  We were trending on twitter. We're the number one trending video on youtube worldwide
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.640]  We're the number one trending thing on facebook
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:32.800]  Over the last 24 hours what you are seeing is something I never thought I would say
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:39.840]  You are seeing social media and the grassroots in this country more powerful than the mainstream media
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.360]  We are the bar social media barbarians at the gates and we have inundated their inboxes
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:50.720]  The new york times is now forced to cover the washington post was forced to cover it. We are the barbarians at the gates
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:57.680]  And we have flooded the mainstream media with interest and attention and we have become more powerful than the mainstream media
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.680]  It's truly historical
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:05.120]  I've talked about this before but I've never actually seen it last night alex when I was on the um the red
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:08.800]  I was at the debate and I walked into the press pool and there were there were
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:15.120]  Five thousand reporters like almost like a red carpet at the oscars and they all knew who I was
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.400]  And they all knew about the story and not one of them
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:25.040]  Wanted to talk to me or talk about it because they weren't reporters. They were repeaters. You were the only you were the only man
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.200]  The only journalist really in the arena
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:33.680]  They they they did not want to talk about it and and I also looked at them and I and I didn't know what to say
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:35.920]  I said guys you ought to be ashamed of yourselves
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.920]  I mean, I said you ought to be ashamed of yourselves and it was truly historical
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.480]  uh situation for veritas and um, I'm just so proud of my team
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:50.960]  It took us a year transcripts and and and filming and and a year of investigative investigative work
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:57.760]  But to see these guys resign the heart and soul of the democratic party that guy bob creamer was not some low-level guy
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:01.040]  He met with the president 47 times. He went to the white house
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:07.520]  340 times he has now resigned hillary clinton is being hillary clinton is being asked about it on an airplane
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.240]  Now now now james we are on a lot of 50 000 waters a lot of new stations right now
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:16.480]  We've gotten like 20 new stations last month. So a lot of new listeners know who you are
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.920]  They've heard about you, but they've heard the media demonize you or twist things
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.840]  So spend a few minutes just to address new listeners on the blackout that's happening
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:28.080]  The huge bomb shows you've been breaking and how they are key in the social media
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.880]  People war against the dinosaur media to go to your site to go to project veritas.com to go to info wars.com to go to drudge
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.400]  Get our stories get our videos and hammer them out to everybody
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.920]  That's how we're cutting through the the berlin wall of discephal guys. I couldn't have done it without you
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.480]  You don't realize how important you are. I mean, I I've no words to tell you how important you are
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:53.120]  You were tweeting at every single journalist. I mean, I've never seen anything like it
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.960]  I had journalists come up to me and say so you're the guy who inundated my inbox
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:02.400]  I didn't even know who they were. You guys were sending retweet 10,000 retweets on these on these tweets
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:08.400]  I mean you flooded their inboxes. So over the last 48 hours the first video was about the
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:14.320]  Conspiracy the dark money conspiracy to induce violence at trump rallies where they were on tape
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:20.480]  Describing how they took credit for all the violence and how that was came through the chain of command from the wealth house
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.080]  This is all on video
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:28.400]  And nobody wanted to cover it. Alex has got 6 million views on youtube that video and the second video was about how
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.400]  They were busting up people across state lines
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:36.880]  How they wanted to commit illegal voter fraud with non-citizens a guy named caesar vargas caught on videotape
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:42.960]  Describing how they bust people the quotes you can't write them. They look like they're from the usual suspects
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:47.840]  The guy in the video says we don't care about the law. We want to win this mother effort quote
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.800]  We've been busting people across state lines for 50 years. You can't make this stuff up
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:15:00.320]  And social media has forced the mainstream media to cover this. It's unbelievable. I've never seen anything like it
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.120]  It's the number one hottest thing. It's it's become a global video phenomenon
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.680]  And I just can't I could not do it
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.480]  We could not have done this a couple years ago
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.280]  And twitter tried to ban me jack dorsi tried to ban me and another thing alex
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:21.840]  This is unbelievable that we had television exclusive lined up with the biggest media television stations
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.320]  And they also fight the story my sources are telling me because they face retaliation and retribution from a future clinton administration
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:32.800]  And they now are forced to cover it because its groundswell is risen and up
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:39.040]  So I have nothing. I don't know what else to say except that this is historical and I could not have done it without all of you
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.240]  Well looking at you via video skype for radio listeners. You've always seemed a little concerned focused
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.120]  You know now you almost look satisfied
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.800]  And I know that feeling of working so long on something like a film or an undercover investigation
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:57.120]  But but nothing like you're the long-term operations that are so professional and then
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.840]  You're seeing it bear fruit and seeing them try to suppress it
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.600]  But still it doesn't work and only blows up in their face bigger. I mean, am I seeing satisfaction in your face?
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:15.520]  Yeah, it's it's well. I'm exhausted. I stood up for 48 hours straight and I just took a nap. So I'm the adrenaline has left my body
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.600]  but I'm I'm
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.600]  It is something that I've never seen before alex the media is losing control over the people
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:27.200]  When the media loses control of the people they panic they get irrational
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:34.320]  They viciously attack they assault my reputation. They they have to do damage control and what you saw with citizen journalism
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.320]  Grounds well up to the top and force
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:43.040]  People to talk about it in the presidential debate which in turn forced the media corporations
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:49.200]  Which don't want to talk about it because they face retribution from the justice department and I had I had by the way alex
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:55.280]  I had I'm not going to say who they work as a prom I promised them I wouldn't but I had people who you'd perceived to be friendly to us
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:01.360]  In the in the big leagues the big TV stations come up to me and say James. I went to war for you
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:06.880]  I went to war for you with with my corporation and I wanted to get you on TV
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.040]  They won't let me put you on TV
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.360]  That is how bad it is that is what
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.160]  Exactly, let's remember that as bad as not as for media is there's actually a lot of good people in there
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.520]  There are some good people there
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.080]  There's some one or two decent people, but they pulled me aside. They huddled me on the red carpet last night
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:28.560]  I said James. I went to war for you. They will not let me put you on television because alex the way it works
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:34.800]  Is these are publicly traded media companies? These are publicly traded corporations and if they air this stuff
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.320]  That people in the white it's over hillary will have to step down
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.840]  If they air this stuff the elections over what is it like for you to see hillary up there going?
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:48.880]  There's no such thing as election fraud while she says the russians are taking it over to have to federalize it
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.720]  That's an oxymoron double thing
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:57.360]  But then there's no such thing as election fraud Obama on the on the rose, you know garden lawn while your video is going viral
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:01.600]  Saying no one's ever heard of it while you have the head democratic party, you know
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:07.360]  Operatives bragging that they're going to steal the effing thing like they always do and nobody's going to stop them
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:14.560]  It's the this guy bob creamer. He's no joke. He's a community organizer. He's he's met with the president of the united states
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:19.120]  47 times he's been to the white house three hundred and forty times
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:25.760]  He's the heart of the institutional left. He is we just we just ripped out the heart of the institutional
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:28.880]  Left so matt boil said he said james you ripped out the heart of the institutional left
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.160]  The beating heart is now put on the table and these guys now
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.960]  I mean the washington post was in a twitter war with me yesterday
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.600]  They go james, you know
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:42.240]  Why don't you get of this video of president obama meeting with him? I said that's your job
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.480]  Why are you telling me to do your job?
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.480]  I mean if there was if I was doing what matt drudge says if I was doing
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.240]  If you guys were doing your job, there wouldn't be a need for people like me, okay?
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:56.720]  And they force us as citizens because they want our guns. They want to raise taxes on us
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.640]  I would never have been a media person
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:04.080]  But I mean I did this because they were taking farmers and ranchers land the environmentalist were to build
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.000]  High-rise buildings on not even paying them
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:09.280]  They were trying to take our guns and when I would go and speak out against it
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.200]  They would say no one wants your guns and play that game and I said that's it. I'm gonna fight you
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:17.840]  That's why they can't defeat us because we're doing this for passion not to be little narcissists like they are
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:20.240]  And let's expand on that because you've got new breaking news
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.480]  I want to play some clips of here and you know break down the latest dirty tricks that you've caught them in but
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:28.000]  Just the magnitude of where this is going. They are panicking
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.720]  They are freaking out a lot of them are getting more aggressive hoping to prop up the system
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.120]  Which seems to only be accelerating its collapse. I mean they were already running james
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.640]  I'll keep of project veritas. We just tuned in folks one of the top of us game journals in the world way beyond scyhursh now in my view
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:49.440]  Sitting here watching them. They're already on fumes. I think we're about to hit the moment where the engine seizes up
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.440]  What do they do when that happens?
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:54.880]  Well, I think that they're they realize that their their days are limited
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.280]  I just want to go back to what I was saying with the washington post reporter
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:03.200]  I mean we were I was they were all the daily show the washington post. I had i david from they were tweeting me
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.840]  So why don't you release your you know your your raw source materials identify your undercover people?
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.840]  I said you don't release your raw materials
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:16.400]  And and I was fighting them and you don't release your sources. Nobody does nobody releases their sources the daily ship
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.840]  The daily show released their raw video. They'd make all the people look like good people
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.280]  They make them look terrible the journalists. This is how they've created a narrative
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:28.960]  They piece words together. They paint a picture that's different than reality and the great thing about undercover video
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:34.640]  On youtube by the way, you put them out in big 16 20 minute clips. I mean this is not really edited
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:39.440]  You're just taking it to the key parts and the people have resigned and they've admitted they've said what they've said
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:42.400]  But alex it's something greater and bigger than that
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.560]  We're exposing when bob woodward was on O'Reilly last night talking about this thing
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:50.960]  We're exposing it's not it's not just about bob. You're forcing the media to do their job
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:55.920]  Yes, because because it's not just about the video the video is something bigger than the video
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.720]  It's about the media if the media was doing their job
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:00.720]  We would be living in a freer world
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:06.160]  We'd be living in a more transparent world and it is exposing the media and that's why they don't want to talk
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.920]  Exactly. Let me take fovell. He's the national coordinator for this, you know for this organization
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.760]  A people from the american way, you know famous socialist group. They're sitting there organizing nationwide. He's so angry. He's so
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:20.960]  Like energizing. They'll never stop us. We played the clip like 10 times this week. You know, they'll never stop us
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:25.360]  We're in control, you know, there's no one we could do whatever we want and now we're taking over the legislatures
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:30.080]  It was almost like hitler and gurring and and and mueslini and those famous tapes in the office
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:34.400]  Where they're all kind of celebrating and laughing and rubbing their hands together. I mean it was like a villain
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.040]  out of a cartoon
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:42.640]  The most amazing part is when scott fovell. This is the guy who was working for george soros' organization
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:46.400]  He says quote we can f f u c k we can f
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:54.240]  Our mother and we would get away with it and what he meant by that is the republican governors and the republican attorney generals in places like michigan
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:22:00.960]  We're we're we're too weak in the knees to prosecute the fraud. These guys are so arrogant. We caught them on videotape
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.040]  They were so arrogant
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:09.360]  That they could get away with anything and wouldn't get prosecuted because the republicans were too spineless to do anything about it
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:15.440]  And it is it is it has come to a point in this country where these people can get away with anything
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:19.120]  That's what i'm saying. They're like archetypal criminals bragging on the tape
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:25.920]  So now we can show the legislatures and get the voter id in I mean, I think this video is going to change the electoral map
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.400]  I think it's going to turn the tide. It's it's it's changed the public consciousness in this country
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:34.320]  I have heard from people. I've heard from left wingers. I've heard from main streamers
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:40.320]  I've heard from people saying james. That is the most unbelievable thing i've ever seen these guys are are criminal
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.920]  They're breaking the law
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:47.040]  It's like in a movie you watch movies when you're a kid with a criminal goes we're gonna screw everyone over
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:51.200]  No one could stop us. You don't think people don't act like that, but they're in the real world. They really do
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.960]  They do and they're and there and there's nothing more despicable
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:01.360]  Nothing more despicable than inducing violence then then then all those protests. Yeah, let's let's what they've been doing
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.360]  And they give this new thing, but I mean yes proof
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:09.360]  I mean we knew it then sending people to beat folks up and cause riots that could have killed people as trump said last night
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.680]  Yeah, the cops got bloodied up
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:18.160]  They got bloodied up in chicago and there's video of that. Well, guess what that was scott foveland bob kramer working with the white house
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:22.320]  Hillary clinton is on the quote the video hillary clinton gives money to dnc
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:29.360]  Dnc gives money to democracy partners and democracy partners gives money to play people like scott foveld to quote go out and execute the
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.840]  sh it this is what they do
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.960]  And and they're on video describing how they I'm
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:38.640]  Quote so damn proud of the bloody cop is
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.320]  I mean
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:45.120]  Can you believe this and then they send women and then they try to get women to get beat up
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:51.920]  This is evil and hillary clinton alex jones hillary clinton was on the airplane with john podesta being asked by reporters
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:57.120]  The white house was asked about it yesterday and they were studying studdling and stumbling over the of the question
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.120]  They didn't know what to say. They said
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.200]  I don't know what they don't know what to do at the debate last night trump brought it up
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:07.680]  He said you induced violence and hillary did not do that since you say that and only at this final point
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:11.440]  Your your latest investigation since you mentioned here's trump last night in vegas
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.960]  I was wondering what happened with my rally in chicago and other rallies where we had such violence
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.560]  She's the one in obama that caused the violence
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.880]  If they hired people they paid them
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.800]  $1,500 and they're on tape saying be violent cause fights do bad things
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:34.800]  Which is a criminal act by the way where they're telling people to go out and start fistfights and start violence
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.240]  And i'll tell you what
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:38.080]  In particular in chicago
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:44.240]  People were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot and that was now all on tape started by her
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:51.120]  started by her james o' keith amazing there was another one zulemo rodriguez is the woman in the video as well who says
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.680]  Oh, I we actually got her an fec expenditure that hillary clinton paid her directly
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.840]  She was paid directly by hillary clinton to shut down a highway in arizona. What a bridge gate. What about what about
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:08.960]  Highway gate. I mean this is on i don't i have no words out the democrats have signed on and the media have signed on to a true
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:14.960]  Criminal system the worst this country's ever seen they're going down with it. The question is what will their death throws be like only a few minutes left
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:20.960]  I'm gonna play a short clip but set it up. This is your latest investigation that came out. You already mentioned it trying to get women beat up
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:27.760]  I mean talk about criminal talk about bullying set the sub force. This is a guy named erin black. He's uh, he works with the dnc
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:34.080]  He says that he's the guy that nobody's supposed to know about his real name is erin mentor. We don't know why he goes by the name
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.200]  erin black
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:42.160]  Uh, it looks like something out of the usual suspects. He's describing how he goes out and he induces what happens at these rallies
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:47.200]  Specifically when it comes to women, he tries to get women bullied and we talked about the war against women
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:51.760]  I'd love to hear what hillary clinton has to say about this one. Here is the latest veritas bombshell
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.120]  During our first video in this investigation, we introduced you to erin. So i'm
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:02.880]  Basically that the rapid response director for the dnc for all things trauma on the ground
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:06.880]  He bragged about his involvement in the chicago from protest for five
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:12.880]  So the chicago protest when they shut all that that was us was more him than me
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.440]  But none of this is supposed to come back to us
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:20.080]  Because we wanted coming from people. We don't want it to come from the party
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.760]  So what did black have prepared next?
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.760]  I mean, I know things that like make big impacts. I think of like
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:34.480]  I like I think it was like a woman older older woman
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:39.040]  Who was like attacked in a trump rally like things like that really
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.640]  Show what kind of
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  Hey, lauren
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:48.560]  So we get people behind trump
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.760]  When he's at a rally, but we make sure it's women
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.680]  And they're and they're and they're positioned next to men
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:00.080]  We want images of the men bullying the women who are trying to hold their signs on
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  That's what i'm gonna do
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:10.080]  That is what we're gonna do. That is the hit. How do you think you're gonna do it?
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:17.120]  They're gonna have to show up seven hours ahead of time and wait in line to get there early
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.920]  So like pretend to be trump supporters so they get sat behind them?
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:25.760]  So like pretend to be trump supporters so they get sat behind them?
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:30.560]  Then fold up those signs that we have and put them in their pockets
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.280]  That is the hit
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:37.840]  That's the head. Okay. We're almost out of time. You got to come back. Okay soon. I mean, I know you're a busy man
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.400]  But you're just a rockstar to everybody here. Uh, let's get into bird dogging because we obviously can't play all the clips
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:46.160]  You really don't edit it. There's so much you put out a bird dogging getting in somebody's face
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.640]  You know pushing them till you get them to fight you
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:54.240]  Yeah, that's how they they refer to it as bird dogging. That's the term that they use. That's the term scout full of uses
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:56.240]  It's where you you and you induce
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.560]  A reaction you induce violence
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.840]  And and people have heard of this term before what makes it so interesting is the relationship with hillary
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:04.960]  Is it is it?
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:09.440]  Bob creamers who goes to the white house three hundred and forty times and meets with president obama
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:14.640]  And is that in fact on conference calls the white house alex our undercover reporter was invited to the white house
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:18.640]  I could not go because I'd have to forge a social security number to get in there
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:22.000]  And I wouldn't want to do that that would be illegal, but we were invited to the white house
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:27.920]  And this is something that hillary knows about bob creamer says she was briefed through the chain of command
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.760]  She's aware of it. Uh, we have more video coming out where that gets more into this bird dogging concept
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.960]  And and what exactly hillary knew and when did she know it again?
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:41.440]  This is something the washington post and the new york time should be breaking something that they're scooped by
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:45.680]  Something they're embarrassed that they haven't been the haven't broke, but we're gonna we're gonna reveal more
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:50.960]  In the next couple days, but exactly what hillary knew because we want to catch them in a lie denying it
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:55.280]  And then we want to break the new show. Well, you you have forced through the electronic berlin wall
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.360]  We've all done it together. It's a huge victory
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:02.640]  In closing obviously they've been trying to shut off assange's internet people have been trying to get in there's been threats
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.000]  They said they want him dead
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.440]  Everybody should pray for you as well my friend because let me tell you you're one of the number one targets
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:09.680]  Probably five people they want to get
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:12.720]  And and i'm one of them you're one of them drudges one of them assange is one of them
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.720]  So you are in quite the club now my friend they can't shut us down alex
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.920]  We're two at this point. We're too high profile. We've got too many allies
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.320]  We've got too many good red blooded patriotic god-loving americans out. There's a hundred million people out there
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:27.520]  That's right. And what you've done you've talked countless others now. So it's it's seismic
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.040]  Seismic and they can't shut me down. They could try to look they can try to kill me. I don't think about it
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:37.120]  I don't worry about it. I what I what I think they're gonna try to use the justice department to shut me down
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:41.360]  That's what i've been told i've been told the justice department is looking at us very closely and you as well
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:46.080]  That's that's exactly what's happening. All right, james o' keith project veritas.com. Thank you so much

[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:23.040]  That were harsh enough to put him on the fbi's top 10 most wanted list
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:29.360]  Well mark riche may have been a career criminal, but he wasn't stupid because he knew the best way to receive his

[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:48.160]  Seven in the next month till its election day. We're 18 days less than 18 days. We're 17
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:51.280]  And a half days out from target
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:59.920]  And it is an amazing time to be alive right now. You're going to see some really sickening dirty tricks edited tapes on trump. You know it
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:05.840]  He's the man in the arena, so i'll give him an a plus last night
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:09.280]  If he wasn't the man in the arena under all that stress i give him about an a minus
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  but he's the man in the arena
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:14.160]  and
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:20.320]  When she sat there and talked about global government open borders is her dream and she goes i meant energy
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:26.240]  Well, of course i've read the memo the speech then she goes in starting with energy because if you make the energy and the roads
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:33.200]  International and controlled by that international government that transfers the taxation regulatory power to the multinational
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:37.120]  If you read the tpp documents if you read the
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.760]  BAMF canada north american union integration documents i made a film on an in-game
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:44.880]  It's free online. Go see it. It's an excellent film
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.280]  It was number one documentary for a month on amazon back when it came out
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:52.960]  I mean i put on the web for free folks for a reason because we need to beat these people
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:58.160]  Uh, and and it shows their statements about we're going to take control of the energy the roads will make them international
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:01.440]  So that nations can't break away because the infrastructure will be
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:07.360]  Held by the international corporate board that will then profit off the toll roads and the rest of it
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:09.840]  so see
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:11.840]  Everything she does is a deception
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:22.160]  So trump says hey, you know you want a you know borderless world or to his credit a mr. Wallace did and then she totally sits there and twist things
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:25.520]  It was a lie because it was deceptive
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:31.360]  But it was a lawyer lie because she does talk about handing over our infrastructure, but she acted like
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:38.000]  That was the opposite of global government when that's the heart of the treason the globalists take over your infrastructure
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.760]  They're it's a corporate military takeover. It's not the russians
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.720]  The russians are having to see in their nuclear powered air aircraft carrier
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:52.640]  And their helicopter ships and their missile cruisers because the west has announced they're moving for an o-fly zone
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:59.680]  To attack russian targets in syria and that will kick off the next level a huge naval battle in the mediterranean
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.120]  And yes, i'm sure the russian ships are going to get sunk so will us aircraft carriers
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:08.160]  And then before you even hear about that on the news
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.600]  Submarines are going to launch
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:16.240]  Missiles into the united states and cruise missiles and we will too and then everybody dies
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.920]  And that's in the news today i'm going to cover that after calls and we got other guests coming on but
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:25.200]  I kept telling you this was going to escalate like this, okay
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:32.800]  Within days of the west saying we're looking for an o-fly zone shoot down russian aircraft on sea span
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:37.360]  And the chairman being told prepare for that the russians put up their own no-fly
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:43.440]  And launched their fleets their submarines everything are now in world war three mode
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.600]  We've gone to deficient to defense condition three
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.600]  Probably really two
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:57.200]  The pilots are scrambled out on the tarmac right now with the b-52 bombers the b-2 bombers the b-1 bombers all of it
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:01.680]  With a crazy witch and a crazy guy that wants to piss on the west as our president
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:07.120]  Who's running around telling us that there's no such thing as election fraud?
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.640]  But the russians are going to hack our election and we may hit them militarily if they do
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:14.560]  They've announced the new doctrine in the last week
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.920]  A week ago they announced we will start hitting you
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:24.960]  Preemptively if we think a cyber attack got launched under your country with no proof the russians the minute they get out of the war
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.600]  The proof the russians the minute they did that launched their fleets and their submarines
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.000]  Within an hour
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.760]  They were leaving port
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.600]  Okay, you're gonna attack us
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.160]  Get ready for war war three. It's all we can do launch the bombers
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.680]  That's where we are with the psychos we have running things you're like oh well
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:52.000]  They won't go that far really every other nut job does in history, but except they didn't have nuclear weapons
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.320]  When Hitler was around until the very end they didn't have stuff with the Napoleon and everybody else, but now they do
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:04.480]  You've got this Filipino guy that's the president that thinks he's John Wayne or whatever. Maybe he's wrong. Maybe he's right
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:08.800]  He's nuts. He's threatening to attack the u.s. Says. He's pulling out saying he'll collapse the u.s
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.720]  Say he wants to be buddies with china. He's a megalomaniac. He went crazy
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:15.840]  Can you imagine if that guy had nuclear weapons?
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:22.480]  I'm told the military already said no five years ago. We first told you about it that they weren't gonna
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:26.400]  You know be part of backing al-qaeda and isis uh in in syria
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:31.040]  But obama fired a bunch of generals and had a bunch of them pulled up on charges because oh my gosh
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:34.640]  You know they leaked to somebody about stuxnet. You're facing ten years in prison now general
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:44.720]  And they put their new generals in that they think are gonna follow orders to start world war three
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.720]  and
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:54.640]  They think in this pissing contest that they can just get russia to capitulate and get the russian hardliners to just give up
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.120]  and let george soros's
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.120]  Foundations in to literally teach russian
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.760]  Five-year-olds little boys how to put dresses on
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.560]  And they had the russian military wear high heels
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:09.120]  I'm not joking because they can break your will with this
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.000]  It's a litmus test and the russians are just like we're not putting high heels on the special forces trips
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.440]  And we're not going to teach five-year-olds how to give a blow job. It's just not happening
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:24.720]  And so and i'm not trying to be crude here. That's what they want to teach in russian schools and the russians are saying we're not doing it
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:28.640]  Then they sent cia operatives
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:34.400]  From the rock band pussy riot. I'm not trying to be vulgar here. This is what they do
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:41.280]  Could go into churches and piss on the altar then we're getting into pissing on they're literally pissing on the orthodox church
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:43.520]  To start a war people
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.920]  That's what's going on
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:56.320]  They've got a devil pope calling for world government badmouthing christianity saying europe isn't christian saying open the gates to the islamicists
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.760]  The long and short of it is all hell is breaking loose. I'm going to your phone calls
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:08.640]  But I want to play a clip tv viewers can obviously see it radio listeners all describe it of dearing
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:14.000]  Unappropriate times when you talk about dead kids or women being abused by islam or wars
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.720]  Or depression hillary gets this big jack-o-lantern look
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:23.760]  That I can make the look but it looks so evil. I don't I don't my enemies get screenshots of it using against this
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:29.120]  I just I can do it. I've practiced it at home. It looks scarier than hell. I don't know how she does it all the time
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:33.600]  I mean i've done this face in the mirror because I've got a face that can do a lot of different faces and it scares me
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:37.920]  I mean it looks like a demon and she goes on this big demon face this big demon clown face
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:43.040]  Like a shark. Other people are calling her a shark now and it's just creepy man. It's creepy
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:47.360]  And I know I've got all her evil to cover it's I don't call her names because I'm out of stuff
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.440]  You know cover that she's done bad. It's endless reams of it. It's just that
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.840]  She's a she's a demon man. And you know everybody I talked to
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.600]  That noser says she stinks like hell. I brought that up. They went crazy with it because they know it's true
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:06.160]  Her staff are all nodding their heads man. She smells like a porta potty
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:11.280]  She looks like a demon. She has a trail of evil and murder behind her with a big
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  plastic rubber clown face
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:20.880]  I mean it's like marz attacks and I don't mean this literally but you know when the hot chick comes to the white house and the
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.920]  Presidential aid lets her in and it looks like she has a beehive
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.800]  Herdu, but really it's the alien and then he pulls it. You know the rubber mask officer. It's killing everybody
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:34.960]  I mean it's like a rubber mask is on her or something and I don't again
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.080]  I'm not saying literally but who can say it isn't like a weird jack-o-lantern face
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:44.240]  And that's who we're going to have as president someone with a jack-o-lantern head
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:46.880]  I mean really
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:49.840]  With a trail of every evil behind her you can imagine with her creepy
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.480]  Undertaker looking husband
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:55.760]  With all his weird crap and all of his weird treason
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:00.400]  And the trashiness we now learn that everywhere they go they steal stuff
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:04.960]  Everywhere they go they steal everything not nailed down like the state department furniture
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:08.080]  I mean these people are just
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.280]  The greatest trash the world has ever seen okay, excuse me

[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:46.400]  We're watching the election. So that's coming up too
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:51.440]  Plus some of the new wiki leaks that have come out. But before I do that, let's go to your phone calls on the debate
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:53.760]  alan in florida
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.760]  You're on the air. Thank you for calling
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:02.000]  Thank you a very dangerous clinton cash operation has been uncovered in florida
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:09.440]  A company called golf tanner has leased the container card of terminal at port canaveral. There's a submarine base there
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:14.080]  It's next to kennedy space center and the company is run by
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:21.520]  The brother of dr. Jaffer dia jaffer who was fed on his name's chief nuclear physicist who headed the entire
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:27.680]  Nuclear wmd program for sedan. This could cost hillary the election in florida
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:30.320]  Okay, is this in the news because I haven't heard of this
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:35.760]  It is not is being blacklisted. They're trying to bury this story
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.800]  Well, you know, normally I would roll my eyes at this
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:41.760]  But I'm going to look into it, but I remember getting a call
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:44.560]  three years ago
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:46.960]  From the most credible sources you could get it from
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:48.640]  at
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:54.400]  A air base from west texas. We named the base that they were taking nuclear weapons that weren't supposed to even be on the base
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:57.920]  Of course, most bases have them hidden anyways of that types of former sack command base
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:02.240]  Well, still is a strategic air command base and that they were shipping them out
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:04.160]  It was a big confrontation
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.680]  Then they suddenly announced the next day
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:11.840]  No, no that afternoon that that nukes might go off and the carolinas are off the ports and there was an emergency with missing nukes
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:19.440]  And nothing got said about that from that point on but that really happened. I mean, we really had this happen
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.480]  Uh, and you know, what do you do when?
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:25.200]  I mean, they know who did it so I can pretty much say now
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:28.080]  I later learned that they they discovered who did it but
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.320]  There was a confrontation with the base police that were private police
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.840]  And the military and the military said no, we know we're not supposed to release this
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:39.920]  But we had the base commander signature saying do it and poor this is from the president
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.560]  And the base commander came out with a big hour-long confrontation
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.960]  And then the the trucks rolled out
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:50.240]  Reportedly to the east coast show that all happened. So who knows what's going on with these traders
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:56.240]  They could do anything as a false flag before this election. Send me information alan at show tips and info wars dot com
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:59.920]  We'll look into it. I appreciate that but I don't want to get into speculation here now. They get a call
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.880]  you
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:09.440]  From actual people in uniform and confirm, you know, who they are as we know they are personally
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:11.920]  Then you know something's going on
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:20.880]  Uh, but there it is exclusive high-level sources confirmed secret u.s. Nuclear warhead transfer. Yeah, all hell broke loose on that one
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:22.160]  And of course if people are moving
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:26.400]  Nukesy legally, who do you call you call him for work? Nobody else will do it or you call project veritas?
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:30.480]  I mean, you know, that's it. I guess you call Matt drudge and there's not many people that got the wavos around here
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:35.520]  I'm not bragging. I'm just gonna fight for this country. I'm done. I mean, I'm just all in that and that's what it takes
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:38.080]  Kyle in Tennessee. You're on the year

[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:57.040]  We're going up to kyahoga county on november the 7th, which is Cleveland, Ohio for your your viewers that aren't familiar with that
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:02.720]  We're taking about a group of 20 people and i'm renting five hotel rooms and we intend to videotape the polling station
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:07.600]  And by the way, that is that is election fraud central will be Ohio the republican party basically admits
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.320]  They're going to help steal it for hillary. So that is the smartest place for you to be
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:15.680]  Well, we're going to rent five hotel rooms and we're going to rent uh rental cars while we're there
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:19.120]  And we're going to videotape from the rental cars. We have to have some safeguards in place
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:24.560]  We're also contacting the kyahoga county sheriff's department eternal order police and the wives of leo
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:29.120]  We're going to try to stay away from the uh local city municipal and just really try to raise awareness
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:33.360]  And see I got to tell you in cleveland in all those cities the cops are totally awake
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:37.120]  It's look we got the cops feeding us the info and it's all gold

[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:42.800]  I'll be honest with you in a sick way. It's the opposite of being afraid of Hillary
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:49.120]  I'm afraid of the evil spirit the center. It's not the right word. I don't like it. It's it's it's it's evil
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:52.000]  I'm repulsed by it
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  But I'm not scared of Hillary when it comes to
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.640]  Fighting her with everything I've got and what she represents because that's what I was meant to do
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:01.600]  It feels good in my soul to put it all on the line
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:04.880]  To be all in that's what humanity's supposed to be folks
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:07.520]  All in not a bunch of lazy
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:10.080]  arrogant people
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:12.080]  and
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:15.280]  I was watching
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:18.320]  Donna brazil
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:20.880]  And the things she was saying on fox denying
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:28.320]  And saying basically it's racism or whatever that she's being asked about emails where she got stuff early on
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.960]  During the democratic debate for Hillary from CNN which CNN admits they did
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:38.800]  And and just the level of understanding I have of the programming she was involved in
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:45.280]  The thing she's saying is her own programming being brought up in the eugenics program of the Rockefeller foundation
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:48.880]  And to have actually read the early stuff of the
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.880]  15s the 20s the 30s
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:59.600]  On how they were going to program a group of black people to control black people and keep them as slaves basically
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:05.760]  And and and how they were going to create a new christian fake theology to control them and then to see it in action with her
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.520]  Like a zombie just repeating it. I realized she's as much a victim as she is a perpetrator
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:17.600]  And I don't know why I'm getting into this. It's just that it's it's once you get this real deep knowledge on these people
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:24.720]  It goes beyond anything you ever see on tv or radio what people break down. It's it's it's like a knowledge
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:28.000]  It's a cult
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.120]  I have the knowledge of their cult. I've been studying it so long
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:36.160]  It's like I'm a high priest in their cult, but I'm not in it
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:41.680]  But I know the stuff their highest level people know that she doesn't even know and I'm not bragging about that
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:45.840]  It's like I'm evil that I know this stuff. That's why I talk about the knowledge of good and evil
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:47.840]  I have the knowledge of evil
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:51.280]  But a lot of times I learned new levels to it. I didn't even think of it. It's like
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.560]  I wouldn't think that she'd be representing the chinese president
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:02.320]  And other presidents separately, I was just thinking she was selling out america for money from them, but it's even worse. It's like
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:05.440]  I guess I'm not a master
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:08.880]  That's what I mean the the depths of these people folks
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:11.440]  But but getting back to Kyle Kyle is very exciting
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:16.240]  You got to be careful obviously, but the mantle of a journalist protects you as long as you don't get in the way of people's
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:20.240]  Voting and all you got to do is show the same people on precinct precinct going in
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:27.200]  And if you run into folks just act confident, which it sounds like you know, you are and you're going to have some big success go ahead
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:32.720]  Sure. Well, I'm up in philadelphia a lot. I shoot basketball at next to genos and pat
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:37.120]  Cheesesteaks in south philly. I've got a lot of friends there. It's a heavily italian neighborhood
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:40.320]  And in 2012 there's not one registered
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:45.200]  Boat for mitt romney and that's not what I'm hearing in south philly and you know
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:50.800]  They're talking about the new black panther party locking down all the polling booths. They're a federally recognized hate group
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:54.960]  They are harassing. Oh, I know I know they say we're going to intimidate polling places
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:58.160]  We always got the new black panther party out front with like clubs in their hands
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:02.480]  Well, those days are over and we're going to stay in the cars. We're not going to interrupt
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:07.040]  We're not going to you know, disrupt it, but we definitely have people we're going to have in each polling station
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:11.280]  We're looking for the buses. We're looking for the rental cars. We're looking for the changing well
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:16.080]  They know we're onto the buses. So they're going to be in rental cars and and and and vans
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:20.240]  Well, we're on top of it. We're not going to have a 2012 again
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:23.520]  We're not going to have the black panther party pulling that again those days are over
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:27.600]  And I think people are growing aware and I'm hearing this is happening all over the country
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:33.120]  But specifically it has to happen and Trump had to rally everybody and we did it the listeners did it
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:40.720]  And now the enemy is crapping their pants. The battle is joined third hour 70 seconds away. Kyle. God bless you

[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:57.840]  Every EU nation is now starting to pull out of the EU
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:03.120]  Every global government program is now running into brick walls because the public became aware
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:06.080]  And once the public becomes aware
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:08.640]  There's no putting that genie back in the bottle

[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:31.760]  They have a philosophy and it is to hurt you
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:34.400]  It is to kill you
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:37.280]  That's what their plan is
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:39.600]  And look at everything they do
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:43.120]  Because if you're gonna do this to take over why not enjoy your work

[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:57.120]  Thank you. I'm gonna make one really really fast point about that last call
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.760]  The the person who owns the company that owns these voting machines
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:04.880]  Is the board of the board of directors?
[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:12.800]  He is also the chairman of the george soros company open so it's open society foundation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no 16%
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:18.640]  Of the voting machines are openly owned by soros and then he's got connections to four or five of their big companies go ahead
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:22.880]  If you if your area uses being
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.840]  Overwhelming your county with calls
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:29.040]  demanding a normal paper ballot
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:35.760]  Okay, well by the way, uh, texas and other states have already set up this reported hotlines because there's so much interest in election fraud now
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:39.440]  This is good. We're waking up to it. That's the first step in the victory
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:42.720]  Yes, yes, exactly
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:45.200]  About the debate
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:48.400]  Um, sorry, everyone know everyone knows this now. It's wonderful
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:55.760]  It doesn't matter how many condescending little liberal head shakes. She gives about oh, yeah, they're all there to make you think you have
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:01.360]  No power that you're the only one even though she just got 500 calls. They want to make you feel alone
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:06.080]  Exactly it doesn't matter what she does
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:11.840]  She knows they know that that that they wanted that she wants to start war with russia
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:14.000]  They know that she wants to
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.280]  bankrupt the economy and she knows that she's going to lose
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:23.680]  And in fact, um in the wiki link you know today it talks about let's see what was it says
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:28.640]  If we lose badly, maybe we should just return the money to the banks
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:33.920]  They know that they're going to lose when they keep hitting her and hitting her and hitting her
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:41.680]  We need to demand for for open elections free elections law enforcement needs to get involved people need to be outside camera
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:43.120]  voting
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:45.120]  groups with cameras
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:49.920]  Everyone knows that it's rigged. This is a revolution against people that took our country over. We're taking it back
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:54.880]  Does that mean we're perfect? Does that mean the republican party's good? No, they're horrible, but this is a real insurrection through
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:56.400]  Donald trump through the liberty movement
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:00.320]  That's why he is now our figurehead no matter what they dig up or make up
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:02.560]  We've got to understand they're the organized evil
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:05.840]  We've got to back trump as our battering ram to ram down the door
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:08.240]  And and we're going to be in a bigger fight after that
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:14.800]  But this is the animating contest the more we fight the stronger we get the weaker they get we have the moral high ground
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:19.040]  That's why they're so scared. That's why they say give up give up you give up you can't win because the more we fight
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:23.840]  The stronger we get brother and we've now reached a level where we're
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:31.680]  Like a titan compared to them. We just don't know it yet. Look this giant titan has this little rat that's intimidated into a corner
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:37.600]  But but won't 10% of the titan's already awake and when that titan fully powers up it's over
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:43.200]  The giant is awakening great points Garrett. All right more calls coming up and the lady
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:49.200]  Well, uh, one of the folks that held up one of the signs and bill clinton's a rapist. She's joining us straight ahead
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:52.480]  We're gonna have to end that contest now. There's a hundred thousands about to be paid out
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:54.800]  But folks need to keep doing it keep taking action
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:05:01.040]  We could do one though a contest on her and uh, you know the Haiti situation or mutilating women
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:09.760]  Whatever happened to billionaire mark rich one of the world's most wanted fugitives who 16 years ago was being indicted
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:13.120]  On one of the biggest tax fraud cases in american history
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:18.320]  And he was also involved in illegal trade deals with iran and other crimes
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:22.880]  That were harsh enough to put him on the fbi's top 10 most wanted list
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:25.520]  Well, mark rich may have been a career criminal
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:30.960]  But he wasn't stupid because he knew the best way to receive his get out of jail free card
[02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:37.200]  Was to donate money to the clinton's mark rich gave a half million dollars to the clinton library
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:40.640]  And lo and behold after 20 years of running from the law
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:45.520]  He was pardoned by president bill clinton rich died in 2013
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:50.000]  But his business partners continued to donate huge amounts of money to the clinton's
[02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:58.080]  Including a one billion dollar pledge to the clinton global initiative in 2009. That is clinton justice

[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:16.240]  It's been something that i've been working on for a long time alex because I think it's very very important
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:22.560]  What the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:25.680]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:31.760]  But when it runs out you start dying we chose the pqq because it has over 175 different clinical trials

[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:30.320]  All right, I'm going to continue
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:36.560]  With your phone calls here and riding shotgun with us is michael gale who
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:44.160]  Um was one of the 100 people or so now that have gone up with the bill clinton's or rapist and gotten on national tv with the audio
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:50.240]  And I want to continue to have more of these folks on we have almost completed mailing out $100,000 in checks
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:58.080]  This is different from what the clinton's have been caught doing with wiki leaks and with project veritas because we never called for violence
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:02.320]  I was that check with lawyers first, but I mean I already knew I was right and they said yes
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:08.960]  Again, you say nonviolent legal lawful area. You're invited in you don't trespass. You don't get on the stage
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:15.600]  Um, you unless you're invited on which they some people did get invited up behind hillary and then it happened and then you simply if you believe
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:22.720]  This which they've settled cases. You say bill clinton's a rapist or bill clinton should be investigated for rape or the media's covering up rate
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:29.200]  And then get the bill clinton rape shirt out there. Obviously, we're not going to pay the $100,000 out selling the rape shirts. I don't think we've made that
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:32.480]  Just even in gross in the in the three months. We've been selling it
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:36.480]  But you can buy that shirt at info or store.com
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:39.840]  I did it out of frustration knowing they're sending people even before it came out notice
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:44.720]  It came out a few weeks later to these rallies to disrupt. We have sources in chicago the police and others
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:49.520]  It's now been confirmed. In fact, it was confirmed back in july but but more of it's been confirmed
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:53.680]  Including wanting to get women beaten up so that they could blame folks
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:58.480]  So I said hey to confide at this game. He has settled rape cases
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:03.520]  He has this long string of it. This is real with him. This isn't made up stuff like with trump
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:05.520]  I mean, we've looked into it
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:09.120]  Most of the women's families have gone public saying she loves trump. She asked trump out her
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:12.560]  She wanted trump to come to the you know, her her restaurant two months ago
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:16.720]  So so you've got that going on and so I'm watching all this happen and I'm
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:21.440]  Realizing we've got to expose the fact that this is happening
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:26.160]  So if citizens agree with me that he's to be exposed and this is hypocrisy go take over live tv
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:28.880]  When they shoot these things in public and within
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:30.960]  It was like 16 hours later
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:33.600]  That was a friday afternoon of the show
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:36.320]  saturday morning
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:40.880]  The saturday edition of fox and friends with tucker carlson boom a guy
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:46.000]  You know stands up with bill clinton's a rapist shirt gets it out that individual got $5,000
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:52.080]  And I did it to reward folks for taking action and to make it exciting and to give it attention and to put my
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:59.600]  John Hancock on it. I'm alex jones. I just paid out $100,000. That's what I do with the money we make to fight to do a border
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:03.680]  I build studios. I send crews out. We take action. We have undercover journalists
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:10.720]  We support other independent journalists like james o' keith. We're in this together. So listeners when you buy the books when you buy the videos when you buy
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:18.400]  The high-quality nutraceuticals and supplements at info or store.com. You are funding the most effective no one can deny
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:23.200]  Other than drugs report.com. We are the most effective
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:29.520]  The most effective media outlet and we're not trying to act cool and read off teleprompters. We're here to change the narrative
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:33.840]  We're here to shake people up. We're here to get people out of their trance. I know i'm going to be made fun of
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.360]  I know i'm going to be demonized
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:41.120]  But everybody knows about bill terberg group and the private fellow reserve and the new world order and the shadow government and the government drug
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:46.480]  Dealing and all the corruptions out and you're losing. You're failing even though they're probably let's not exaggerate
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:56.240]  1015 national news reports against me every night making stuff up twisting things hillary clinton's running tv ads again, you know attacking me and trump
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:03.120]  It's not working, but they're in this one-dimensional attack pattern not even two-dimensional or three-dimensional. They don't get it
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:08.320]  They're discredited. They have six percent trust rate the ap reports of their own study
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:11.120]  So you're hated when you attack me
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  It makes me a legend fool
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:20.080]  Now i know they got the justice department and you are james oakief saying he talked to national journalists that have been told the justice department
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:26.080]  Will will arrest you and folks they can dig something up. They can make something up the difference is i'm like, okay
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:28.480]  i'm not i'm not looking forward to it or whatever happens, but
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:33.040]  Fill your hand like they say in true grit and i mean a certain point you got to commit to something
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.120]  Because i know the road we're going down if we don't stand up is destruction
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:44.320]  So thank you all your support info wars life.com info or store.com, but more importantly spread the videos the articles the information
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:50.080]  They want it censored. They want it controlled. They don't want you to know what's going on. They don't want others to know what's happening
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:52.880]  now, uh michael gale, uh
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:59.040]  sky maiden news.com or sky made news.com twitter.com
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:02.560]  forward slash and and we'll put all that on screen for folks
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:05.280]  It's gotta be over 100 people that have done this
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:08.400]  That's why we have to stop the contest now because i mean i obviously don't
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:13.680]  Can't go over that budget. We don't really even have that money, but we'll make it. Don't worry. Thanks for your support
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:16.880]  Even though it didn't there we we sent it out. I mean, we had the money in the bank
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:20.800]  But the point is it wasn't budgeted already. I just did it. I want to do another contest
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.200]  We should have a whole discussion about what could that be?
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:27.680]  But maybe smaller prizes to take over the media and just show people the power they have
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:31.520]  I mean we can call for people to go do something else and it'll happen too without the money
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.160]  It's just for some reason that seems to supercharge it
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:36.160]  Uh, but uh
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:39.200]  Talking to michael gale
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:47.280]  First let's play the clip of what happened. Uh, here it is people still can't pay basic expenses and too many people are worried
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:54.080]  About whether there's going to be a future and their kids can add the same upward nobility. They felt they
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:57.840]  I know that
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:13:59.760]  I know that
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:03.360]  That's what it ought to be about after we have an economy to work for everybody
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:06.320]  I don't want to make sure everybody gets a chance to participate
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:13.520]  How can we help families succeed in the most important job of any society raising children and succeeding more?
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:19.520]  How can we look together with all of our diversity so we can all rise together?
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:23.360]  How can we be safe?
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:26.320]  And it went on and on it was all over national news. This was all in the first week
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:31.440]  This has not been going on three weeks and it's it's bigger than ever now. I'm told some of the news clinton is flipping out
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:35.360]  Hillary can't stand it. This is an example of human action
[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:40.720]  Taking over the mainstream media if tyranny accelerates everyone should start doing this on local news
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:45.840]  Uh county commissioner courts you name it just everywhere you come in they've hijacked our country
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.640]  They've hijacked our world their lockstep taken orders from foreign corporations that control the white house
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:54.400]  We're taking the country back an information war. So great job
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:59.040]  I want to salute you tell us about why you did this in canton, ohio at the bill clinton rally
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:03.200]  Uh, and you know what what spurred you to this because you have a lot of courage. We want to salute you
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:08.720]  thank you, well, actually i'm about truth and uh, I think
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:14.800]  We are so starved for truth right now in america and so much reality is coming at us right now
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:19.200]  Um, I was reading. I just want to show you real quick maxims of law
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:21.760]  Some people have forgotten about them
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:25.280]  Or they are stashed away somewhere where people can't read them
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:31.920]  But I read he who does not freely speak the truth is a betrayer of the truth
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:38.240]  So I am very committed. I'm really big on sovereignty and protecting my sovereignty
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:41.520]  And I just like you alex
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:47.520]  You're doing an awesome job and you're putting yourself out there so much and and I have to tell you I
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:55.120]  Uh listened to an audio book of donald trump and he said, you know, sometimes you just have to put yourself out there
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:59.840]  and that kept ringing through my mind and ringing through my mind and then
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:06.320]  You came to mind and you I've heard you for a long time and you said i'm all in i'm all in
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:12.880]  And that kept ringing in my mind and I thought you know what it's time for all of us to take that little bit of action
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:14.880]  to
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:17.680]  Get america back on track
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:22.800]  Well, you did it and again, you were one of the first to do it. It's now happened sometimes two three four times a day
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:24.400]  It's still in the news
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:28.480]  The media is trying to block it people are calling in on on c-span saying it
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:32.960]  I mean, I wanted to cause a chain reaction. It's happened and I think thanks to you and others taking action
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:35.440]  That chain reaction has now taken place
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:41.920]  Yes, yes, yes, and and that's good because people are getting involved people are recognizing that
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:45.840]  We're in a peaceful fight together to save this country
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:48.560]  and um
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:50.640]  I just want to mention two to you
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:55.680]  I was watching you last night during the debate and it was like you were just banging your head up against the wall listening
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:58.240]  to hillary clinton and
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:00.480]  Two things about that
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:02.480]  the biggest victim
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:05.680]  Is the most masterful at manipulation
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:08.320]  And this is what we see
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:15.920]  And the other thing is is you can't have a conversation a normal healthy conversation when somebody is completely
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:18.720]  lunatic or delusional
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:23.760]  When they're in this delusional thinking they don't know truth. They can't speak the truth
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:30.800]  Well, that's what I see in the eyes of donna brazil when she's denying that she's in the wiki leagues
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:35.760]  When singing in confirms it with pre-debate questions. She's just shaking her head saying no, it isn't true
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:39.840]  She's totally delusional. You can see it's like a form of mental illness
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:43.280]  Yes, oh, it definitely is it is a definite
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:48.800]  Mental illness and this is why when people are a little bit more healthy and they're trying to have these conversations
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:54.720]  It doesn't work and I know what people I know that people know what I'm talking about because they're out there trying to talk to
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:56.800]  their friends or certain people
[02:17:56.880 --> 02:17:58.320]  and they're like
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:02.320]  I can't get through to them. Yeah, their minds already made up and they're in their own world
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:08.480]  Yes, I mean hillary is a real monster. I mean if somebody wrote a novel about a fictional character like her
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:12.080]  I wouldn't believe it because there's such criminal energy. She does so much bad
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:18.960]  Well, she can't help it. It's just inner blood. It's just natural for her. She's been doing it for years
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:24.160]  And as you can see through history and news of both of them
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:28.160]  it's like a constant cover up cover up cover up and
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:36.480]  When they're lying in so many ways in so many subjects, but yet it's really most important to recognize
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:40.240]  cover up it's all about the cover up and
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:43.360]  you know, um
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:48.320]  I wanted to say there was a small clip with hillary clinton and I saw that probably about two weeks ago
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:54.160]  Where she says that she chose the emails that went to the fbi
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:19:01.200]  And I wish I could quote you where I saw that but I go through a ton of media all the time constantly
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:06.480]  And um, yeah, and she said she chose she chose the emails
[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:12.160]  The other thing I wanted to bring up to you actually is says I went online and I looked this up
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:16.560]  How to avoid going to jail under 18 usc section
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:21.760]  1001 for trying for lying to government agents
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:27.680]  And I read and read and read and as I read through this something stuck out to me and it said
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:34.240]  Basically it depends on the person and what jurisdiction they are within
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:36.880]  So that's the question
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:40.080]  What jurisdiction is hillary clinton standing in?
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:45.840]  That's right. Well, she thinks she's in this global government diplomatic class. That's above the law. That's what globalism is
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:47.680]  I want to have uh,
[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:53.360]  Michael gill back up again for a longer interview or definitely not the news really smart person amazing sky made news

[02:24:54.480 --> 02:25:00.880]  Good afternoon, Alex. I have two fast points when Henry brings up these russian comments
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:09.040]  Uh, these russian comments aim to trump. Why doesn't he bring up the 20 percent? Uh, of our uranium deal that she brokered
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:14.720]  Uh, and that would really just kind of uh turn the tides on her and just squash that whole line of thinking
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:19.680]  I know, I mean listen, I give an a plus for having courage being in the arena and getting some good zingers on her
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:23.760]  But he missed I mean, I would have torn the living hell out of her. So would have you probably
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:29.760]  Um, I mean it was just on every front. He had her I'd be like how dare you bring up women again?
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:33.680]  You you you stay in the same hotel room with umma abedin
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:39.040]  Whose mother is a genital mutilation queen literally the the head woman pushing it worldwide
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:42.080]  You you've got a hundred plus millions from Saudi arabian guitar
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:44.640]  Who are the most abusive woman in the world?
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:48.240]  Who throw I think you did say throw gays off buildings and he did get to some of that
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:54.640]  So I mean it's just she she's so monstrous. It would take 50 hours to list our our crimes out
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:26:00.640]  Can you imagine like if god was like or the archangels reading out her crimes? I mean how long the scroll would be
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:03.120]  I mean, can you imagine that just like
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:07.280]  If I'd done one of these things she'd done I couldn't live. I mean, I just would be
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:11.840]  And she just loves it. She's just fun for her. Go ahead. Sorry
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:18.080]  That's okay. I am checking that my information. Uh, bad part article 25th of July this year

[02:26:26.720 --> 02:26:30.800]  Hillary met in secret. It's come out in the wiki leagues with Vladimir Putin
[02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:41.840]  Well, by the way, I wanted to make um, you know, uh, uh, Trump is uh, a bird nothing. Um, you know, uh, Syria and uh,
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:48.000]  You know, it's just uh, a sod and it just it makes me wonder what he's being fed
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:50.240]  Or I'm sure he knows exactly what's going on there
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:54.080]  Is that because he's afraid of the alien some of the voter base? Yeah, that's it. Look, look, look
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:58.640]  Most americans just think middle east evil bad. He in a case something, you know, he don't want to
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:04.160]  Yeah, a sod's a bad guy. Okay bad guy, but you know, we shouldn't be backing ISIS that way. He just covers all bases
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:08.880]  It's kind of like saying yes, Saddam's a bad guy, but we should never throw him. Well, no the CIA trained him
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:15.200]  He was a command. Uh, he tried to kill the president got injured came back. They sent him in they sent him as the head of the security
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:18.160]  I'm gonna go the whole history but the point is Saddam was set up by the west
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:22.000]  So the truth is compared to other people Saddam the same was an angel
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:25.760]  But he doesn't want to say that because they can twist it and he knows the public isn't educated
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:31.520]  So yeah, that's exactly what trump's doing great points. Uh, let's go ahead and another call here about two and a half minutes to break
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:35.040]  Uh, let's uh, go ahead and talk to
[02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:37.920]  Dan in ohio dan you're on the here go ahead
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:46.320]  Yeah, uh rob do was gonna have me on last night because I disrupted uh, obama's
[02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:48.320]  Uh rally
[02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:53.520]  And clear there's a lot of the folks that have been going to the rallies and talking about rape that we've been trying to get on or
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:58.240]  Lost in a mix. So I thought you might be one of those folks that fell through the cracks, Dan. We want to set you up. Go ahead
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:05.840]  Uh, yes, I did. I uh went to the rally. It wasn't uh, uh, it was difficult to get in there
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:09.840]  It was like a cult like atmosphere and I couldn't get a bullhorn
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:15.520]  But I stood up on a metal railing and held up a photo called colorful copy
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:17.520]  of uh, trump
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:19.680]  or or bill
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:21.680]  Clinton is a rapist
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:25.840]  I remember that great job. In fact, we need to set you up as a guest. I'm sorry
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.120]  I think you fell through the cracks
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:30.480]  Can we put you on hold and then give your number to rob do or or have you talked to rob?
[02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:33.840]  Uh, I tried to talk to rob
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.240]  We went back and forth in tax and he ran out of time to get well, yeah, that's the problem
[02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:42.320]  He's been running around you know about chicken with a head cut off that guy's uppercut four in the morning a lot of nice
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:47.200]  Which is fine. He's getting a lot done. He's getting a little bit crazy. I'd which is I'm just we're totally honest
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:53.280]  So do I so do needs to relax a little bit. So I'm sorry if all of the cracks, but he's now become grumpy do lately
[02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:58.080]  Uh, they they have a nickname. It's called deucefer around here. So deucefer needs to get some rest
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:01.280]  Uh, but yes, sir. We'll we've got your number. We'll get you set up. Okay
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:08.400]  I think your next contest should be a citizen's arrest hillary let people
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:12.960]  Put try to put a citizen's arrest on her and put her in jail
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:14.480]  Well, that's a total genius idea
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:17.840]  But then they would claim that I was trying to get people to be law enforcement or they could get hurt
[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:23.920]  Then they claimed that I was racketeering which it wouldn't be if someone individually believed that they were doing a serious citizen's arrest
[02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:27.840]  They could try it but it couldn't be for a contest, but it's another great idea. We'll talk soon Dan
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:30.160]  I'm getting you on because I remember that video. I want you on. Thank you
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:32.560]  We'll just get his number take off this plate
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:39.600]  Poor dude was running around here last night. We ran that big live 13 hour transmission with almost no glitches so much better than mainstream media
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:42.720]  And rob dude was at the middle of it like an octopus getting so much stuff done
[02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:50.160]  But now he looks a little like a little a little like a wet cat. So I get like that too. We'll be right back. Stay with us
[02:29:51.120 --> 02:29:54.080]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:54.960 --> 02:29:57.840]  Alex Jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:57.840 --> 02:29:59.840]  You
[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:06.880]  Whatever happened to billionaire mark rich one of the world's most wanted fugitives
[02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:13.200]  Who 16 years ago was being indicted on one of the biggest tax fraud cases in american history
[02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:18.400]  And he was also involved in illegal trade deals with iran and other crimes
[02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:22.960]  That were harsh enough to put him on the fbi's top 10 most wanted list
[02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:30.320]  Well mark rich may have been a career criminal, but he wasn't stupid because he knew the best way to receive his get out of jail
[02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:37.200]  Free card was to donate money to the clinton's mark rich gave a half million dollars to the clinton library
[02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:40.720]  And lo and behold after 20 years of running from the law
[02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:45.600]  He was pardoned by president bill clinton rich died in 2013
[02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:50.080]  But his business partners continued to donate huge amounts of money to the clinton's
[02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:56.000]  Including a one billion dollar pledge to the clinton global initiative in 2009
[02:30:56.320 --> 02:31:01.120]  That is clinton justice and you can learn more right now at info wars.com

[02:33:16.800 --> 02:33:20.880]  But the fact that trump is calling out the fraud is got them in a conniption fit
[02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:23.760]  They're running another hoax that no one's ever done this in history
[02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:29.760]  They've already played clips of them contesting the election 2000 the supreme court all the latest clips
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:32.720]  But today I'm going to shoot a big video that we're put out tonight and tomorrow
[02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:37.680]  That that just proves the media is lying, you know about trump and the staged election
[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:41.600]  That is just just incredible how dumb they think you are
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:47.280]  We've got them with project veritas and trump bringing it up last night. It was amazing
[02:33:47.840 --> 02:33:51.120]  And trump bringing up the fact that they know they sent people to disrupt his rallies
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:55.040]  That was in the wiki leaks before but now more has come out and we have video of them
[02:33:55.040 --> 02:34:00.320]  I love how investigative journalists are just backing up the wiki leaks by going to the very people
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:02.800]  They send good-looking women's how they do it
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:06.720]  O'Keeffe really upped his game the last two years. He started getting advised by
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:11.680]  Former CIA and FBI folks who are just fed up
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:15.920]  I don't think you really need to have the CIA advise you to use hot chicks to infiltrate
[02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:18.080]  I think everybody's known that for hundreds of years, but
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:21.680]  Uh, these guys sit there and brag their butts off
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:27.440]  And we've got a bunch of Hillary clips. We're going to be playing as well. Uh, Larry Nichols is going to ride shotgun with us a little bit in the next hour
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:29.840]  And then we've got uh, Anthony Coomium
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:34.080]  Taken over about eight after always great to have him co-host in the show at least every two weeks
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:37.120]  With his big syndicated broadcast kind of getting all that synergy
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:39.760]  going together
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:41.360]  Just briefly before we go to Larry Nichols
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:44.880]  solutions of science solar generator system. They got a bunch of products, but
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:51.120]  They always come up with the latest solar generators the highest quality the lowest prices. It's a good deal of six thousand dollars
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:55.040]  I bought one from them like 10 years ago, you know earlier generation obviously for like
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:57.760]  four and I got the discount
[02:34:57.760 --> 02:35:00.320]  Well now because of miniaturization everything getting cheaper
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:06.560]  Uh, they can do it because they're doing this at cost or below cost. It's a lost leader for $1,500
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:11.760]  So they got a lot of other amazing systems as well. Visit power grid chaos.com

[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:56.480]  These are I go to the top organic producers of the country. I have three of them
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:01.680]  And trashly two of the biggest ones supply Whole Foods everybody else and there's some of the biggest companies
[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:06.000]  They don't want to be listed and I get it and we honor that because we're so controversial
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:08.320]  But half our products are made by group roughly
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:13.280]  He advises on the others and I go and I say I want what your scientists think is the most
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:15.280]  ridiculously good formula
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:17.760]  at the lowest price
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:20.480]  And they go wow, we love you other people don't do this
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:24.240]  And you know those companies will have a few things that are really great
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:28.800]  We private label whatever they got something's 30 years best seller absolutely known by everybody the best
[02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:33.040]  We private label it same bottle different label boom sell it, you know 20 lower. That's what we do
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:39.440]  Uh, we don't have that model of you know seven times markups. Is it 100 markup now? We do 25 off on brain force
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:44.160]  It's we're not even making 30% on that and sometimes we suck a little silver at cost
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:49.760]  So it's all there info wars live calm your purchase makes it all happen funding this operation
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:55.680]  They hate we have our own model. They hate we fund ourselves. They got articles out every day. He's now sell snake oil
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:00.720]  If you think bio pqq bought from misubishi america
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:03.600]  his snake oil I got a
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:08.240]  Punching the land right square on your nose. This is badass stuff. Okay?
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:11.920]  If you don't think oxy power will rock your world try it and see
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:15.440]  If you don't think iodine deficiency is a huge deal research it
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:20.560]  IQs went up 15 percent when the fed started putting a little bit of it and salt in the 30s
[02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:22.640]  Then they pulled it out in the 80s
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:24.640]  Just google IQs explode
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:28.000]  When you don't have an iodine deficiency most people are dying without it
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:32.640]  We got the purest form there is I mean it's it's this is what I take every day
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:39.280]  I look like a hippopotamus five years ago. I'll work out less than I did then and I'm healthy because I've had all these deficiencies
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:45.520]  Anyways info wars live calm now Larry Nichols appreciate him popping in two days in a row Larry
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:50.160]  What do you think of the debate last night? I don't think he did as good as in the last one
[02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:56.560]  Everybody else seems to be the best ever, but he did land some really good solid punches on hillary clinton. What do you think?
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:37:59.440]  Well, I'm like you alexa
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:03.680]  I had hoped for obviously a more aggressive
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:08.720]  Straight to the american people and he didn't so that was disappointing. However
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:11.360]  He got a couple of things in
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:14.880]  Number one. I was just with a group of people and they were talking about
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:21.600]  He is the first candidate that they've ever seen maybe is the first that's ever done it that literally came out
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.720]  In a debate and stood up for the rights
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:27.600]  Of the unborn child the way he did
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:29.600]  He delivered
[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:32.720]  He delivered. That was uh impressive
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:37.440]  Now the thing that he I wish he would do and maybe he can still do it
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:41.280]  I wish you would when hillary deflected the wiki leaks
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:48.800]  From straight from wiki leaks didn't hit her with what are you doing getting 35 mil to give our uranium up you damn traitor
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:53.680]  That's right. I would have done that but there's another thing that everybody's overlooked and alex on
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:56.560]  Russia and wiki leaks
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:39:00.080]  She said she had 17 leading
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:06.320]  You know members of the ca all these different groups. She doesn't she doesn't if she did they would be doing
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:08.640]  Investigations. It wasn't even true. I know she just made that up
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:11.520]  But here's the thing trump or to say
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:17.280]  If they've got proof that russia is doing this tapping
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:24.160]  Where is one complaint filed to the un security council? Where is it?
[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:31.760]  Where is it? There has never been that's what you're supposed to do. They don't want an investigation. No, well, you know
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:37.760]  You know benny doesn't want to give out any secrets, but he's he knows now most these leaks are coming from our own government
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:47.280]  Of course, of course, but i'm just telling you for everybody that thinks there might be one speck of truth to what hillary says about
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:51.200]  Russia doing this wiki leaks thing being behind it
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:58.480]  If if you believe that then you need to go and show me or show alex and show yourself
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:01.840]  Where our government has filed one
[02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:04.880]  One complaint to the un and remember
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:14.000]  She is saying essentially alex that russia has tapped in to our state department's computer network
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:17.120]  That's basically invading america
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:21.120]  That there's not one complaint filed because they know it's 100 percent
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:24.400]  Bull they know sure. Let me ask you this question
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:32.480]  What does it signify russia sending its fleet in there said they want to know fly zone could the october surprise be trying to start a larger regional war
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:36.640]  I mean they admit that's the plan with russia. Are they bold enough to do that? No
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:38.560]  No
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:43.360]  This is uh, well, that's what i've been told by steve pacanik and also some retired generals that are recently retired
[02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:45.520]  They said the military is not going to follow that order
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:47.520]  He's not going to follow that or no
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:54.160]  Well, number one alex you have to understand our military is not in shape to engage in any kind of conflict with russia
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:57.840]  Even at a at a tactical level or theater level
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:02.160]  We're not going to do it. No officer in the military is going to square off
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:08.480]  That's why this whole no fly crap that they're putting out. We need to hillary sitting there and say and trump or to say this
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:16.480]  They're all right hillary. You say we are to set up a no fly zone over syria over parts of syria. All right, what are you going to do hillary?
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:20.880]  If one of our jets is up there in the no fly zone and here comes a russian jet
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:28.320]  Well, harry answer is use missiles to shoot down the jets. Well, then they just attack our aircraft carriers. That's right. You just declared war
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:34.400]  You just it'll be tit for tat and tit for tat means just like you say we pop the jet
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:36.720]  They'll pop one of our ships in the Mediterranean
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:42.080]  Now it's just all bogus. It's all stuff to try to hooter us up
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:44.560]  What they're trying to do
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:51.360]  With all of this russian stuff alex is to try to put the fear into the population and say golly
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:55.680]  This world's a dangerous. Yeah, and they ought to be scared because hillary's the one pushing
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:41:57.600]  She's the one put
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:00.320]  She's the one pushing it into us though. She's the one causing it
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:06.960]  But they're now the thing that is disturbing to me after the debate
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:11.680]  Now folks you're going to see the grand finale
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:20.720]  For the next 19 days, they are going to spend every second of media time that they can get their hands on
[02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:22.800]  Telling you
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:26.400]  Trump cannot win. I'm going to give you anecdotal a little thing
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:30.800]  I just got not going to say who it was or where it was, but a person in north carolina
[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:38.800]  Went and cast the vote he talked to a poll watcher that was there just as you know kind of how's it going
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:45.200]  And the poll watcher in north carolina. This is north carolina. Remember where hillary's taking over right?
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:47.200]  She's taking it over
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:53.520]  Said that the voting thus far seemed to be and he had been there since it opened that this morning
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:43:02.000]  Voting thus far was somewhere around two to one for trump. Oh, it's a total answer. Maybe maybe three to one towards trump
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:04.080]  Now folks
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:06.080]  I know that's anecdotal
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:12.480]  But I assure you alex you're talking to a guy that helped invent most of the dirty tricks that they use
[02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:14.640]  I'm telling you. I know listen
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:18.320]  We know that real internal polling has him 10 15 points ahead
[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:24.640]  Conservatively, there's a total landslide happening. So how do they counter that just the hoax to convince us he's going to lose
[02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:26.880]  So when they try to steal it, it seems positive
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:31.600]  It's look it's all yeah, I mean it's all to get the numbers up
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:38.160]  So that they kick in massive voter fraud and these votes come in and it's justified
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:41.840]  It's justified if they were showing us real polling data
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:48.480]  They couldn't use the voter fraud that they're planning to use as massively as they're planning to use it
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:49.840]  Let me ask you this
[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:51.840]  What happens when in 10 battleground states?
[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:57.200]  We have people everywhere and let's say early that day by noon. We've already got 10 15 videos up
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:43:57.840]  It's going to happen
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:01.840]  We already know because the democrats don't care they're moving forward with with with trucks and buses
[02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:03.840]  But not so much buses doesn't know we're looking for that
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:12.560]  So that's why we have so many people in the state that are talking about the polling spot and the polling spot and the polling spot
[02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:20.960]  And taking people to polling spot to polling spot stealing elections. What happens is that's coming out on the internet
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:23.440]  Alex
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:32.560]  That day if people will call me or call your office that they must do it while it's going on you can call me folks at 440
[02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:38.800]  See, the flaw in their system, Alex, is local law enforcement.
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:47.400]  Oh, yeah, they got national stuff covered, but they don't control the local law enforcement.
[02:44:47.400 --> 02:44:50.320]  We catch that stuff going on as it's happening.
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:52.720]  We can shut that election down.
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:58.040]  Not to mention the fact that Trump is the first person we've ever had in recent modern
[02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:07.600]  times, that if he is given that information, he has the power and will push it to the extreme.
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:08.600]  Wasn't it epic?
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:11.960]  I want to play this clip of him pointing his finger to Hillary and saying, you know, we've
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:12.960]  caught you doing all this.
[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:16.360]  But also, you know, the reason I know they're going to seal the election is they have millions
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:17.360]  on the voter rolls.
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:18.360]  It shouldn't be there.
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:20.960]  And this lady is a criminal and shouldn't even be uppers.
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:21.960]  She should be indicted.
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:23.960]  Here's Donald Trump last night.
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:29.320]  In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:31.880]  last 10 days since the last debate.
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:33.720]  I'd like to ask you about them.
[02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:35.840]  These are questions that the American people have.
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:40.960]  Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid
[02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:46.440]  even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:47.960]  while you were Secretary of State.
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:54.760]  The e-mail show, the donors got special access to you, those seeking grants for Haiti relief
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:58.280]  were considered separately from non-donors.
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:03.960]  And some of those donors got contract, government contracts, taxpayer money.
[02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:07.880]  Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee and why isn't what
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:12.720]  happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation?
[02:46:12.720 --> 02:46:15.720]  Why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:21.920]  Well, everything I did as Secretary of State was in furtherance of our country's interests
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:22.920]  and our values.
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:24.440]  The State Department has said that.
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:26.080]  I think that's been proven.
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:27.080]  But I am happy.
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:30.080]  In fact, I am thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation because of their name.
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:33.400]  No, no, we actually played this clip, which is fine, and we do that.
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:35.400]  But that's getting into the whole hurt, her denying.
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:36.400]  She did all this.
[02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:37.400]  She's all been caught.
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:39.800]  It's been proven now in the New WikiLeaks that Obama knew.
[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:43.080]  He was using a fake name, a pen name, a gnome diploma with her.
[02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:44.960]  He's now been caught lying to the public.
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:50.440]  I mean, how can she survive the tens of thousands of emails, each one basically being a felony,
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:51.440]  Larry?
[02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:52.440]  I'm going to cue up the other clip, too.
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:53.440]  But I mean, how does she survive this?
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:55.440]  She survives it by what they've done.
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:46:57.240]  Who are you going to call?
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:00.160]  Alex, that's the key to the Clinton trick.
[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:03.280]  And that's what their people say and they're having, you know, always folks vote over and
[02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:04.280]  over again.
[02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:05.800]  They said, look, we run the feds now.
[02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:06.800]  We run the media.
[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:07.800]  They can't stop us.
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:08.800]  Yeah.
[02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:09.800]  Who are you going to call?
[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:10.800]  Who are you going to call?
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:11.800]  The Justice Department?
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:12.800]  You're going to call the FBI?
[02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:13.800]  Who are you going to call?
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:21.600]  She can sit there and say stuff like that, knowing that it's not even real.
[02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:22.600]  I agree with you.
[02:47:22.600 --> 02:47:25.560]  But if we catch them stealing the election and have a hundred videos of it and she still
[02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:27.040]  gets in, she's done.
[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:29.040]  If she gets in, we're done.
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:30.040]  All right.
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:31.040]  Let me play the next clip.
[02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:32.560]  Let me play the next clip that I mentioned in your take on this.
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:35.000]  Here's Trump going after last night.
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.560]  I want to ask you about one last question in this topic.
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:46.200]  You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:51.600]  Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:57.040]  Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you, his words, will
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:48:00.840]  absolutely accept the result of this election today.
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:03.520]  Your daughter Ivanka said the same thing.
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:07.760]  I want to ask you here on this stage tonight, do you make the same commitment that you will
[02:48:07.760 --> 02:48:12.360]  absolutely, sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?
[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:14.040]  I will look at it at the time.
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:15.440]  I'm not looking at anything now.
[02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:17.240]  I'll look at it at the time.
[02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:20.360]  What I've seen, what I've seen is so bad.
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:26.560]  First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt and the pylon is so amazing.
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:30.320]  The New York Times actually wrote an article about it that they don't even care.
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:33.440]  It's so dishonest and they've poisoned the minds of the voters.
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:37.280]  But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:38.280]  I think they're going to see through it.
[02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:40.720]  We'll find out on November 8th, but I think they're going to see through it.
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:41.720]  But sir, there's a...
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:47.400]  If you look, excuse me, Chris, if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:49.680]  of people that are registered to vote.
[02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:50.680]  Millions.
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:51.680]  This isn't coming from me.
[02:48:51.680 --> 02:48:54.400]  This is coming from Pew report and other places.
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:59.520]  Millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:02.120]  So let me just give you one other thing.
[02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:03.880]  So I talk about the corrupt media.
[02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:08.160]  I talk about the millions of people, tell you one other thing, she shouldn't be allowed
[02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:10.800]  to run.
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:14.480]  She's guilty of a very, very serious crime.
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:16.720]  She should not be allowed to run.
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:22.360]  And just in that respect, I say it's rigged because she should never...
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:27.400]  Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she
[02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:30.040]  did with emails and so many other things.
[02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:32.400]  But sir, there is a tradition in this country.
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:36.880]  In fact, one of the prizes of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:42.760]  no matter how hard fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign, that the loser
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:44.360]  concedes to the winner.
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:47.760]  Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the
[02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:52.520]  loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:53.640]  of the country.
[02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:56.440]  Are you saying you're not prepared now to condemn to that principle?
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:50:00.640]  What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time, I'll keep you in suspense.
[02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:03.960]  Now, Chris Wallace was not completely fair.
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:06.800]  He interrupted a little bit more and was a little bit harder on Trump.
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:09.240]  But I give him an A-plus.
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:12.400]  Compared to other debates, it was stellar.
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:13.400]  So I was...
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:16.080]  Now, let me tell you something, Alex.
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:17.320]  He set Trump up.
[02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:23.720]  I'll never again believe Chris Wallace to be fair, middle of the road or whatever.
[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:30.120]  That was a setup question if Trump had taken the bait and had said, yes, you know, I'll
[02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:31.920]  go with the election.
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:37.560]  Why would you agree at this point in the face of all the videos that are out there of them
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:44.160]  joking and laughing and telling in specificity how they're going to rig the elections?
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:45.160]  Why would you dare?
[02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:48.320]  I guess I get your point, but I'm saying, compared to the others, he was a lot better.
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:49.320]  But you're right.
[02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:50.320]  Oh, yeah.
[02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:53.120]  He was setting them up to make the whole debate, which they've done, about that statement.
[02:50:53.120 --> 02:50:56.720]  But I think it's backfiring, because everybody knows Al Gore challenged it, it went to Supreme
[02:50:56.720 --> 02:51:02.340]  Court 15 years ago, everybody knows that this is real, so I don't think it's going well
[02:51:02.340 --> 02:51:03.340]  for him.
[02:51:03.340 --> 02:51:07.200]  Well, what I want to know here again, when you get involved and who you're going to
[02:51:07.200 --> 02:51:15.160]  call it, Alex, why is the guy that has been fired or whatever that was on video stating
[02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:18.680]  how they were going to rig it and talking about the bringing in the vans?
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:20.560]  Why hasn't he been hauled in by the FBI?
[02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:21.560]  Right.
[02:51:21.560 --> 02:51:24.080]  That is conspiracy to commit a federal crime.
[02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:25.080]  It's racketeering.
[02:51:25.080 --> 02:51:29.680]  It is conspiracy to suppress the voting rights, which is what racketeering was basically brought
[02:51:29.680 --> 02:51:30.840]  in for, as you know.
[02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:35.920]  Well, it certainly qualifies under Title 18, which is racketeering.
[02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:40.800]  I mean, why is this guy not under arrest right now?
[02:51:40.800 --> 02:51:44.600]  Why is the FBI not querying him?
[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:47.760]  The Democrats have established a racketeering operation.
[02:51:47.760 --> 02:51:52.160]  They say to take over the legislatures, to overthrow the country, and to become our absolute
[02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:57.720]  rulers, these guys should be in a room with police with phone books right now.
[02:51:57.720 --> 02:52:00.560]  Let me tell you about Arkansas.
[02:52:00.560 --> 02:52:03.560]  You know why we were able to do what we did in Arkansas?
[02:52:03.560 --> 02:52:09.720]  Because the Stevens Brothers set it up with the Clintons, where if you wanted to run for
[02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:15.560]  county sheriff in Humnoke Town, somewhere in Arkansas, you didn't get elected unless
[02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:17.760]  you were approved by the Stephens.
[02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:20.760]  You didn't get to be dog catcher unless you were approved by the Stephens.
[02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:23.840]  And aren't they the ones that own a bunch of newspapers and stuff?
[02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:24.840]  They did.
[02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:25.840]  I don't know if they showed it.
[02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:27.360]  Well, no, I never said this.
[02:52:27.360 --> 02:52:30.480]  I had them make a run at me, if I remember correctly, about 10 years ago.
[02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:31.480]  They're a piece of work.
[02:52:31.480 --> 02:52:32.720]  Yes, they are.
[02:52:32.720 --> 02:52:33.960]  You know, I'll give you one.
[02:52:33.960 --> 02:52:39.240]  Mike Reagan was doing very well, and then his contract was up, and he was bragging to
[02:52:39.240 --> 02:52:44.240]  me that he had a chance to go with this other network and found out it was owned by the
[02:52:44.240 --> 02:52:45.240]  Stephens.
[02:52:45.240 --> 02:52:46.240]  I said, you better not.
[02:52:46.240 --> 02:52:49.640]  Well, he did, and it wasn't six months until he was off the air.
[02:52:49.640 --> 02:52:56.400]  So, listen, in Arkansas, if you control everything, Alex, if you control law enforcement, if you
[02:52:56.400 --> 02:53:05.400]  control the media, if you control the dog catchers, if you control the county courthouses,
[02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:12.480]  you can do anything you want to do because there's nothing the people can do to stop
[02:53:12.480 --> 02:53:13.480]  it.
[02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:15.120]  Now, they're moving.
[02:53:15.120 --> 02:53:16.120]  This is.
[02:53:16.120 --> 02:53:20.960]  They tried, Bill didn't quite complete the Arkansas cabal.
[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:25.240]  But, but, this election has been a beta test.
[02:53:25.240 --> 02:53:26.240]  Will the media lie?
[02:53:26.240 --> 02:53:27.440]  Oh, they serve.
[02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:31.080]  Will the federal law enforcement do what they're told, and yes, we now know they're ready
[02:53:31.080 --> 02:53:32.480]  to go to any level.
[02:53:32.480 --> 02:53:34.160]  They'll do anything they're told.
[02:53:34.160 --> 02:53:35.440]  They will follow any order.
[02:53:35.440 --> 02:53:39.000]  They are ready to perfect the tyranny and kill the republic.
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:40.000]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:44.480]  That's exactly what I'm saying, and if you don't believe it's real, go back to Arkansas
[02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:45.480]  in those days.
[02:53:45.480 --> 02:53:46.480]  It's absolute.
[02:53:46.480 --> 02:53:51.000]  It's absolute control in anybody that dared to challenge them.
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:52.000]  They've got the FBI.
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:58.040]  The FBI veils them to rob data files so they can find out, Alex, anything about you and
[02:53:58.040 --> 02:54:02.920]  anything they don't know about you, or if you're super clean, they'll make it up.
[02:54:02.920 --> 02:54:08.240]  As you have seen, they have the media that will go with the smear story if there's not
[02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:10.360]  an ounce of truth in it.
[02:54:10.360 --> 02:54:12.280]  They will destroy you.
[02:54:12.280 --> 02:54:16.920]  They will destroy you, and they will put you in jail.
[02:54:16.920 --> 02:54:23.000]  If you're a problem, you're going to jail because they control the prosecutors.
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:33.240]  By the way, you catch them in, let's say, a case of all, Title 18, looks like Title 18,
[02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:38.640]  felony, conspiring to commit voter fraud at a national level.
[02:54:38.640 --> 02:54:40.720]  Who are you going to call?
[02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:42.440]  Call me a federal prosecutor.
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:44.120]  We can contact right now.
[02:54:44.120 --> 02:54:46.360]  By the way, it's open and shut.
[02:54:46.360 --> 02:54:49.600]  These guys are all going to jail, the whole chain of command, but nothing will happen
[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:55.880]  because Loretta Lynch is living like 50 years ago in some weird race world.
[02:54:55.880 --> 02:55:00.480]  Meanwhile, her goddess is about to cause World War III.
[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:01.600]  These people are nuts.
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:07.600]  Well, and then we've got our safety valve, right?
[02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:08.840]  Congress.
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:10.280]  We've got Congress.
[02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:15.640]  You've already seen Congress can hold hearing after hearing after hearing, but here's what
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:23.400]  you got to ask when they hold all these hearings, looking into Hillary and the emails and in
[02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:28.560]  the Katrina fraud, you know, when all these contractors are getting all that, tell me
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:31.480]  after the hearings, what happened?
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:32.480]  Nothing.
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:33.480]  Nothing.
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:34.480]  Nothing.
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:41.600]  So you're telling me if we don't get Donald Trump in there to quote, unquote, drain the
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:44.640]  swamp, nothing's going to happen.
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:45.640]  Nothing.
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:46.640]  All the politics.
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:47.640]  Well, it's going to get a lot worse.
[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:49.840]  And they want to mop up and secure their kingdom.
[02:55:49.840 --> 02:55:53.840]  I want to take a few phone calls from Mike and Joshua and Carl and Mary and being others
[02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:56.480]  who were Larry Nichols, but we're not trying to scare you folks.
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:55:57.480]  You know, it's real.
[02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:01.720]  It's all in the emails and it's just a hellish world.
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:05.400]  You know, the good news is Bill Clinton and Hillary's health is, is, is, is coming down
[02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:09.080]  the line, but they got other evil scum behind them ready to take over.
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:14.160]  And it really is sad to see this country so cursed, but we did kill 55 billion unborn
[02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:15.160]  babies.
[02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:19.000]  And so in a way, if we go down this road in a sick way, we deserve it.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:23.200]  I want to see it turn around, but it is what it is.
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:26.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Idaho.
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:27.720]  Thanks for holding your own here.
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:28.720]  Larry Nichols.
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:29.720]  Hello, Alex.
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:30.720]  Welcome.
[02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:41.560]  I just read a news article yesterday in U-Times, who's also on Reddit and a couple other sites.
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:49.080]  Hillary Clinton just moved all the money from the Clinton Foundation to banks in Qatar.
[02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:53.960]  It sounds to me like she's getting ready to take the money and run because she's going
[02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:54.960]  to lose.
[02:56:54.960 --> 02:57:00.880]  Also, she just gave up our nuclear response time in the debate yesterday.
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:02.880]  Sure did.
[02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:05.240]  Did you hear it?
[02:57:05.240 --> 02:57:06.400]  I heard it.
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:07.640]  I heard it too.
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:11.680]  Larry, why do you think she walks around with that weird Joker smile?
[02:57:11.680 --> 02:57:15.920]  I've never seen anybody that looks more like a, like a rubber face person.
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:17.960]  Was she like that when you knew her?
[02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:26.680]  Well, she wasn't quite as old as she is now, but she wears that smile because it's basically
[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:28.280]  glued on her.
[02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:29.280]  It's glued on her.
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:35.080]  Hillary's normal demeanor, if you're around her, you'll never see that smile.
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:36.400]  That's not Hillary.
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:39.120]  You can be around her with friends.
[02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:41.480]  She don't smile, Alex.
[02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:43.800]  That is a makeup face.
[02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:46.080]  That's where they go in with the cake powder.
[02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:49.200]  That's where they go in with the adhesive.
[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:52.960]  And they, just like you're saying, that Joker, I mean, that's about what it is.
[02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:57.360]  It's an adhesive glued on face.
[02:57:57.360 --> 02:57:58.360]  She doesn't smile.
[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:00.520]  She doesn't smile.
[02:58:00.520 --> 02:58:01.520]  What makes her happy?
[02:58:01.520 --> 02:58:05.880]  I mean, at least there's some humanity in her that she likes sex.
[02:58:05.880 --> 02:58:07.600]  What makes her happy?
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:08.600]  Power.
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:09.600]  Power.
[02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:18.600]  She, she gets the greatest joy in her life when she can prove that she has power.
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:19.600]  That's right.
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:21.520]  When she said I came, I saw he died.
[02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:24.680]  She looked real for a minute and kind of just convulsed with pleasure.
[02:58:24.680 --> 02:58:28.760]  Like, you know, I'm failing a whole country and she admits I'm killing all these people
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:29.760]  just murdering.
[02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:35.080]  Kind of like Mellon Albright, I murder 500,000 kids, all the blood's all over them.
[02:58:35.080 --> 02:58:36.080]  Oh, they love it.
[02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:37.080]  That's power.
[02:58:37.080 --> 02:58:38.080]  That's power.
[02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:42.080]  They're bloodbathers, they, they, you know, exactly, but we'll be back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:42.080 --> 02:58:43.080]  Mike, great point.
[02:58:43.080 --> 02:58:44.080]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:58:44.080 --> 02:58:45.080]  Stay with us.
[02:58:45.080 --> 02:58:51.760]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:51.760 --> 02:58:56.720]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's
[02:58:56.720 --> 02:59:01.680]  talking about on the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid, the potential
[02:59:01.680 --> 02:59:08.000]  for power grid chaos, EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather.
[02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:12.160]  Hurricanes, ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid.
[02:59:12.160 --> 02:59:15.440]  My friend's chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot worse.
[02:59:15.440 --> 02:59:20.040]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply
[02:59:20.040 --> 02:59:21.440]  of backup electricity.
[02:59:21.440 --> 02:59:26.520]  Now I've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house, the solutions from science
[02:59:26.520 --> 02:59:27.520]  system.
[02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:30.120]  Simply put, this thing is amazing.
[02:59:30.120 --> 02:59:32.240]  Solutions from science only makes the best equipment.
[02:59:32.240 --> 02:59:38.040]  Go to powergridchaos.com, that's powergridchaos.com to check it out.

[03:00:05.040 --> 03:00:06.840]  We are on the march.
[03:00:06.840 --> 03:00:09.840]  The empire is on the run.
[03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:13.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:00:13.960 --> 03:00:15.960]  We're living on the air.
[03:00:15.960 --> 03:00:17.560]  Less than 18 days now.
[03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:19.960]  He might have 17 and a half.
[03:00:19.960 --> 03:00:21.960]  We're living on the air.
[03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:24.080]  Carl in Georgia, you're on the air with Larry Nichols.
[03:00:24.080 --> 03:00:25.080]  Go ahead.
[03:00:25.080 --> 03:00:26.960]  How's it going, gentlemen?
[03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:28.760]  Welcome.
[03:00:28.760 --> 03:00:34.960]  I was watching the debate last night and the only thing I saw that wasn't quite right
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:41.120]  or whatever was when Trump missed a golden opportunity, when Hillary started talking
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:47.560]  about how good they did during Haiti, he should have immediately hit her with the fact that
[03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:55.520]  over the last six years, the Clinton Foundation has stolen $2 billion from the people of Haiti.
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:01:01.840]  That's a great point, Larry.
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:11.960]  One of the Clinton, one of their cronies that got a deal with Haiti, they got $25 million
[03:01:11.960 --> 03:01:18.720]  to build a plant that was going to employ 1,000 Haitians, and then the subjobs around
[03:01:18.720 --> 03:01:22.720]  it would amount to about 10,000, I don't know what they were going to build.
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:28.600]  When the committee went in to check out that plant to see that check its progress, what
[03:01:28.600 --> 03:01:30.400]  they found was a vacant lot.
[03:01:30.400 --> 03:01:34.960]  It had never had one brick laid.
[03:01:34.960 --> 03:01:42.640]  In the Clinton circle of buddies during that period got $25 million of our money to build
[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:47.680]  a plant that was never built, and guess what, nobody's ever done anything about it.
[03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:54.240]  You talk about not being God-fearing, if I imagine stealing $2 billion from poor children,
[03:01:54.240 --> 03:01:58.840]  just thinking about it makes me have to get the wellies, I couldn't imagine actually doing
[03:01:58.840 --> 03:01:59.840]  it.
[03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:11.680]  Well, Alex, when Trump kind of dropped the bomb on her about wherever there was 6 billion
[03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:15.920]  or 3 billion that's missing from the State Department, did you notice how she never
[03:02:15.920 --> 03:02:16.920]  addressed it?
[03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:19.520]  She never said a word about it.
[03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:21.720]  That's a pretty legitimate question.
[03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:26.680]  During your time, $6 billion is missing from the State Department.
[03:02:26.680 --> 03:02:28.680]  Where'd it go?
[03:02:28.680 --> 03:02:33.400]  They admit she stole George Washington's plates and stuff, now the FBI's investigating
[03:02:33.400 --> 03:02:35.460]  stolen furniture.
[03:02:35.460 --> 03:02:38.200]  When you knew them for a decade, do they steal stuff constantly?
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:40.240]  No, they didn't steal it.
[03:02:40.240 --> 03:02:44.040]  In their mind, it's theirs.
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:45.040]  Anything in the...
[03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:48.640]  You should have seen the hall they took out of the governor's mansion when he left to
[03:02:48.640 --> 03:02:50.080]  go be president.
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:53.520]  The governor's mansion had to be totally refurbished.
[03:02:53.520 --> 03:02:56.760]  They just took stuff left and right.
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:02.200]  Now, one thing she keeps making reference to, Alex, that we need to get out of the way.
[03:03:02.200 --> 03:03:05.920]  She talks about, well, we got to get it back to the economy her husband had.
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:10.640]  Let me tell you that economy, it was a false economy.
[03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:15.400]  When Bill Clinton took office as president, folks, the average family credit card debt
[03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:17.680]  was $5,000.
[03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:23.800]  When Bill Clinton left office eight years later, the average family credit card debt
[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:27.840]  was $54,000.
[03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:29.760]  Jobs were lost massively.
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:30.840]  They sold us off.
[03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:34.440]  They credit derivatives bubble that transferred power to them.
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:35.440]  Yep.
[03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:39.200]  And everybody, you know, and you run around in here today about how great the economy...
[03:03:39.200 --> 03:03:40.520]  Yeah, people bought stuff.
[03:03:40.520 --> 03:03:44.920]  Yeah, people did because Clinton called the credit card in the bank companies and told
[03:03:44.920 --> 03:03:49.160]  them to open them up and they would have given a credit card and an open line.
[03:03:49.160 --> 03:03:51.160]  And that was going to get bailed out later by the taxpayer.
[03:03:51.160 --> 03:03:52.880]  It was a giant, big, screwed job.
[03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:53.880]  Carol, thank you.
[03:03:53.880 --> 03:03:54.880]  Mary, Bill and others.
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:58.640]  I've got to go because we have a special guest host, Anthony Kumi, who does a great
[03:03:58.640 --> 03:03:59.760]  job coming up.
[03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:06.400]  Can't wait to hear his take on the debate tomorrow night or that happened last night.
[03:04:06.400 --> 03:04:09.520]  But before we go any further, Larry Nichols has launched a new website where you can
[03:04:09.520 --> 03:04:14.600]  support him, the critical work he's doing, all the info he's been given, the inquire,
[03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:15.600]  everybody else.
[03:04:15.600 --> 03:04:16.880]  You see the great effect he's having.
[03:04:16.880 --> 03:04:17.880]  LarryNichols.info.
[03:04:17.880 --> 03:04:20.880]  That's LarryNichols.info.
[03:04:20.880 --> 03:04:23.120]  He's also battering, cancel.
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:26.000]  Yeah, certainly can't talk here because I was eating soup while he was talking.
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:29.480]  He is battling cancer as well, so be sure and support him.
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:33.680]  LarryNichols, ladies and gentlemen, is a great patriot and we really appreciate him.
[03:04:33.680 --> 03:04:35.160]  Larry will talk to you again soon.
[03:04:35.160 --> 03:04:36.480]  Sounds great, buddy.
[03:04:36.480 --> 03:04:37.480]  Thank you.
[03:04:37.480 --> 03:04:38.480]  You bet.
[03:04:38.480 --> 03:04:39.480]  He's the guy behind the Clinton Chronicles.
[03:04:39.480 --> 03:04:40.480]  You name it.
[03:04:40.480 --> 03:04:41.880]  And here's the thing.
[03:04:41.880 --> 03:04:43.480]  Everything he's told us has come true, basically.
[03:04:43.480 --> 03:04:45.880]  I mean, this guy knows what he's talking about.
[03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:46.880]  It's amazing.
[03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:51.320]  Anthony Kumi, a big syndicated host in his own right, censored, kicked off XM Top Show
[03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:55.880]  there for criticizing Obama, and Michelle and Hillary and the rest of it.
[03:04:55.880 --> 03:04:58.400]  He's got his own big syndicated show, but he guest hosts twice a month.
[03:04:58.400 --> 03:04:59.400]  We love to have him.
[03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:01.880]  He's taking over right now.
[03:05:01.880 --> 03:05:07.280]  Whatever happened to billionaire Mark Rich, one of the world's most wanted fugitives, who
[03:05:07.280 --> 03:05:13.080]  16 years ago was being indicted on one of the biggest tax fraud cases in American history.
[03:05:13.080 --> 03:05:18.720]  And he was also involved in illegal trade deals with Iran and other crimes that were
[03:05:18.720 --> 03:05:23.080]  harsh enough to put him on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list.
[03:05:23.080 --> 03:05:27.920]  Well, Mark Rich may have been a career criminal, but he wasn't stupid because he knew the best
[03:05:27.920 --> 03:05:34.000]  way to receive his get out of jail free card was to donate money to the Clintons.
[03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:38.680]  Mark Rich gave a half million dollars to the Clinton Library and, lo and behold, after
[03:05:38.680 --> 03:05:43.480]  20 years of running from the law, he was pardoned by President Bill Clinton.
[03:05:43.480 --> 03:05:49.080]  Rich died in 2013, but his business partners continued to donate huge amounts of money
[03:05:49.080 --> 03:05:56.480]  to the Clintons, including a $1 billion pledge to the Clinton Global Initiative in 2009.
[03:05:56.480 --> 03:05:57.480]  That is Clinton Justice.
[03:05:57.480 --> 03:06:01.480]  And you can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[03:06:01.480 --> 03:06:08.480]  There was a mighty nation, rest above all of creation.
[03:06:08.480 --> 03:06:09.480]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[03:06:09.480 --> 03:06:10.480]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[03:06:10.480 --> 03:06:14.600]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21, the American system of justice
[03:06:14.600 --> 03:06:19.160]  must be changed to conform to the rest of the world, individual rights will have to take
[03:06:19.160 --> 03:06:20.160]  a back seat, do the collected.
[03:06:20.160 --> 03:06:21.160]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[03:06:21.160 --> 03:06:22.160]  It's gonna become after you've done.
[03:06:22.160 --> 03:06:23.160]  Oh, yeah.
[03:06:23.160 --> 03:06:24.160]  I take it ain't gonna sit well down my way, at all.
[03:06:24.160 --> 03:06:25.160]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[03:06:25.160 --> 03:06:31.840]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:06:31.840 --> 03:06:33.160]  It's time to ride, boys.
[03:06:33.160 --> 03:06:34.160]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[03:06:34.160 --> 03:06:41.160]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[03:06:41.160 --> 03:06:43.160]  And beef was for supper.
[03:06:43.160 --> 03:06:50.160]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[03:06:50.160 --> 03:06:56.160]  Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin, want to shed some tears over
[03:06:56.160 --> 03:06:58.160]  the red, white, and blue?
[03:06:58.160 --> 03:07:00.160]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[03:07:00.160 --> 03:07:01.160]  Let's fix it.
[03:07:01.160 --> 03:07:04.560]  Brain Force, it's a completely different trial bottle of it.
[03:07:04.560 --> 03:07:10.280]  Rob Doe joins us, you worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours, tell us what Brain Force did.
[03:07:10.280 --> 03:07:13.680]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:07:13.680 --> 03:07:18.440]  I get in here at 8.30, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna
[03:07:18.440 --> 03:07:21.240]  make it, and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:07:21.240 --> 03:07:24.960]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there, I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes
[03:07:24.960 --> 03:07:27.960]  later, it's like, everything just kind of clears up.
[03:07:27.960 --> 03:07:30.960]  It's got four and a half stars, people really love it.
[03:07:30.960 --> 03:07:35.600]  Read about it, find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it
[03:07:35.600 --> 03:07:40.680]  really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:07:40.680 --> 03:07:43.480]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have
[03:07:43.480 --> 03:07:44.480]  done it without Brain Force.
[03:07:44.480 --> 03:07:49.440]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more
[03:07:49.440 --> 03:07:51.000]  Brain Force and came in.
[03:07:51.000 --> 03:08:18.120]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:08:18.120 --> 03:08:25.120]  It's Anthony Kumiya, broadcasting only 18 days out, Anthony Kumiya.
[03:08:25.120 --> 03:08:30.840]  Great, thanks Alex.
[03:08:30.840 --> 03:08:37.120]  Anthony Kumiya here for infowars.com, a pleasure to be back.
[03:08:37.120 --> 03:08:40.480]  I love what Alex and everybody here is doing.
[03:08:40.480 --> 03:08:51.200]  It's so refreshing to tune in and see the truth, the truth, ideas given to people to
[03:08:51.200 --> 03:08:58.320]  make their own opinions, and not force-fed by mainstream media, which is what we're getting
[03:08:58.320 --> 03:09:06.160]  these days, and man, has it been insane the past year and a half with this, I can't believe
[03:09:06.160 --> 03:09:09.960]  it's been a year and a half with this election.
[03:09:09.960 --> 03:09:17.920]  We have seen the media exposed for the lying shills that they are, because I mean honestly,
[03:09:17.920 --> 03:09:24.320]  before they had at least a chunk of plausible deniability, the media's lying, yeah, they
[03:09:24.320 --> 03:09:28.680]  are, but then you tune in, you hear a story, and you go to your friends, hey, guess what
[03:09:28.680 --> 03:09:33.000]  I heard on the news last night, and they go, what, and you tell them like it was actually
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.320]  something true.
[03:09:35.320 --> 03:09:41.960]  And then with this election, just pieces being chiseled away, whatever was left to their
[03:09:41.960 --> 03:09:47.560]  credibility, to the point now where there's not a single thing.
[03:09:47.560 --> 03:09:57.520]  If the press came out, the sky is blue, I can't believe it, I just can't buy it, why?
[03:09:57.520 --> 03:10:05.080]  Because of everything I've seen in the past year and a half with the media lambasting
[03:10:05.080 --> 03:10:15.480]  Donald Trump, lambasting the American people that want a change from the pro-politicians,
[03:10:15.480 --> 03:10:21.420]  the lifers, that Hillary Clinton epitomizes.
[03:10:21.420 --> 03:10:31.360]  She is absolutely what we as real Americans do not want anymore, we're sick of it.
[03:10:31.360 --> 03:10:33.240]  How long could we sit here?
[03:10:33.240 --> 03:10:42.360]  I mean the silent majority, the American people that don't protest, they don't raise their
[03:10:42.360 --> 03:10:44.920]  voices or get annoyed, you know what they do?
[03:10:44.920 --> 03:10:47.320]  They go to work on a daily basis.
[03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:54.920]  They pay their taxes, they raise their families, they bitch a little to their neighbors, family
[03:10:54.920 --> 03:11:00.080]  when they're at maybe a holiday dinner, but that's about it.
[03:11:00.080 --> 03:11:08.200]  Then you suck it up and go back to work and contribute to the United States of America.
[03:11:08.200 --> 03:11:15.920]  And then as the years went on, and especially in this election period, not only are you
[03:11:15.920 --> 03:11:22.440]  told this is what you have to do, you have to rest the United States of America on your
[03:11:22.440 --> 03:11:29.680]  back as the working middle class, but now you're a piece of garbage.
[03:11:29.680 --> 03:11:39.640]  Now you have to sit and be referred to as the element that is destroying this country
[03:11:39.640 --> 03:11:41.320]  and that this country is already great.
[03:11:41.320 --> 03:11:43.960]  It doesn't have to be made great again.
[03:11:43.960 --> 03:11:50.080]  But you're the problem, you're the alt-right, you're a Nazi, you're this, you're that.
[03:11:50.080 --> 03:11:59.720]  Well it's one thing to have the United States on your shoulders, to continue to build and
[03:11:59.720 --> 03:12:07.400]  create and contribute to this country, because that's a good thing and it's not always easy.
[03:12:07.400 --> 03:12:14.560]  But it's another thing to then be told you're the garbage and you're the one that's hurting
[03:12:14.560 --> 03:12:16.240]  this country.
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:19.840]  And that is why there is a Donald Trump.
[03:12:19.840 --> 03:12:28.520]  That's why people are still supporting Donald Trump even after this cavalcade of crap that
[03:12:28.520 --> 03:12:33.600]  the left and the left-wing media has pumped out.
[03:12:33.600 --> 03:12:40.040]  And not just against Donald Trump, against you, you're the problem.
[03:12:40.040 --> 03:12:46.400]  Yes, you've been working, contributing, raising a family and you're the problem.
[03:12:46.400 --> 03:12:53.520]  You're the one they're talking about as the basket of undesirables, the alt-right, the
[03:12:53.520 --> 03:12:58.240]  people that are destroying the country and dividing the country.
[03:12:58.240 --> 03:13:03.440]  This election is not just between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
[03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:10.000]  And when you say you support Trump, you'll get a lot of crap from people because they
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:13.920]  just, they're so myopic, they don't see the bigger picture.
[03:13:13.920 --> 03:13:16.440]  I'm not just supporting Donald Trump.
[03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:23.480]  This is supporting a way of life, the American way of life.
[03:13:23.480 --> 03:13:31.640]  It's somebody that's upset with the way government has been screwing us for years, years we've
[03:13:31.640 --> 03:13:33.280]  been screwed.
[03:13:33.280 --> 03:13:40.840]  The media that's come out of hiding to tell everyone, yes, we are incredibly corrupt and
[03:13:40.840 --> 03:13:48.480]  biased and against you, the people that want to make America great.
[03:13:48.480 --> 03:13:51.120]  That's who I'm voting for, November 8th.
[03:13:51.120 --> 03:14:02.280]  I'm voting for people that want to end these lifers in Washington that are on autopilot
[03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:06.680]  because it's the way things have been done for years.
[03:14:06.680 --> 03:14:09.320]  And you're the problem, not them.
[03:14:09.320 --> 03:14:15.200]  I want to see what would happen with a guy getting in there that isn't a professional
[03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:22.640]  politician, that is a proven businessman, that knows obviously how to delegate responsibility.
[03:14:22.640 --> 03:14:24.920]  I want to see that happen.
[03:14:24.920 --> 03:14:33.520]  Why do we have to choose from this small pool of proven corrupt politicians that have just
[03:14:33.520 --> 03:14:39.720]  played the game for so long that people's best interests aren't in their mind anymore?
[03:14:39.720 --> 03:14:43.720]  Their best interests is, they're cronies and friends and contributors.
[03:14:43.720 --> 03:14:46.560]  Their best interest comes first.
[03:14:46.560 --> 03:14:53.760]  Why don't I want somebody that says that the country's best interest is up front?
[03:14:53.760 --> 03:15:00.480]  That we should get a better America?
[03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:06.840]  Why not give that a try instead of electing the same people that do the same things, make
[03:15:06.840 --> 03:15:12.040]  the same mistakes and seem to upset us every four years, don't they?
[03:15:12.040 --> 03:15:19.040]  Doesn't it just seem like it's the same people getting in there every four years or eight
[03:15:19.040 --> 03:15:20.720]  years?
[03:15:20.720 --> 03:15:23.960]  And I don't want it, I'm tired of it.
[03:15:23.960 --> 03:15:29.760]  And if you watch mainstream media, man, they are pushing for it because they're part of
[03:15:29.760 --> 03:15:30.760]  the machine.
[03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:39.600]  They're part of the same gizmo that has run this over, just run right over the working
[03:15:39.600 --> 03:15:42.240]  class in this country.
[03:15:42.240 --> 03:15:47.640]  And have just not allowed us to excel to the point where we know we can.
[03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:56.680]  It is so far up our rear ends, if I may say, if I may be so bold, that we just don't have
[03:15:56.680 --> 03:16:05.400]  a chance to be exceptional, a small business, try to put together a small business and have
[03:16:05.400 --> 03:16:10.360]  it successful in this country and create here in this country.
[03:16:10.360 --> 03:16:16.640]  Last night on the debate, you heard Hillary getting on Donald Trump for making some of
[03:16:16.640 --> 03:16:19.760]  his products out of the country.
[03:16:19.760 --> 03:16:21.360]  He's a businessman.
[03:16:21.360 --> 03:16:28.080]  You have to do business under the rules that have been legislated by these politicians,
[03:16:28.080 --> 03:16:29.820]  like Hillary Clinton.
[03:16:29.820 --> 03:16:34.440]  And those rules have dictated you cannot do business in the United States.
[03:16:34.440 --> 03:16:36.040]  You'll go broke.
[03:16:36.040 --> 03:16:41.920]  So he's supposed to hang himself on a cross like a martyr for the politicians and say,
[03:16:41.920 --> 03:16:47.760]  look what I did, I'm making my goods here in this country as a businessman with no say
[03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:49.760]  over the legislation.
[03:16:49.760 --> 03:16:52.720]  He's not a politician, businessman.
[03:16:52.720 --> 03:17:00.000]  And I'm supposed to make my products here in this country with what you've done to productivity
[03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:04.960]  in this country and go broke just so I could say, thanks, I did it.
[03:17:04.960 --> 03:17:09.200]  I made my products in America and I'm broke now.
[03:17:09.200 --> 03:17:14.160]  Where would you do that and then say, wow, that stinks?
[03:17:14.160 --> 03:17:22.200]  Maybe I could change that if I throw my hat into the political arena and say how crappy
[03:17:22.200 --> 03:17:24.880]  it's been.
[03:17:24.880 --> 03:17:32.640]  The way they've made the rules where it's impossible to be a patriotic businessman and
[03:17:32.640 --> 03:17:38.960]  do business with American companies because of how they've legislated and how they've
[03:17:38.960 --> 03:17:41.800]  driven jobs overseas.
[03:17:41.800 --> 03:17:43.440]  That's the problem.
[03:17:43.440 --> 03:17:46.960]  That's what we're voting against when we vote for Donald Trump.
[03:17:46.960 --> 03:17:50.080]  I'm voting for what the media says.
[03:17:50.080 --> 03:17:53.080]  Oh, he said stuff on a bus.
[03:17:53.080 --> 03:17:58.040]  Oh, years ago, he said this about a girl and oh, he was divorced.
[03:17:58.040 --> 03:17:59.200]  Oh, he had a girlfriend.
[03:17:59.200 --> 03:18:00.360]  He did that.
[03:18:00.360 --> 03:18:03.480]  I don't care.
[03:18:03.480 --> 03:18:07.560]  And most of the people that support Donald Trump don't care.
[03:18:07.560 --> 03:18:16.800]  It makes me more angry at the corrupt lying media and Hillary and her lying shills that
[03:18:16.800 --> 03:18:24.320]  they pump this stuff out there thinking that I'm stupid enough to eat it up and go, oh,
[03:18:24.320 --> 03:18:26.840]  oh, Donald Trump, he said that.
[03:18:26.840 --> 03:18:30.560]  My God, I better vote for Hillary.
[03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:33.360]  Oh my goodness, this is terrible.
[03:18:33.360 --> 03:18:40.600]  Instead of thinking, wow, they'll go to any length to put this woman in office to keep
[03:18:40.600 --> 03:18:49.920]  that machine nice and greased up and running smoothly to continue to screw over the working
[03:18:49.920 --> 03:18:53.840]  American and the working American family.
[03:18:53.840 --> 03:19:00.480]  Keep that machine well-oiled so the media who's part of the whole thing, they contribute.
[03:19:00.480 --> 03:19:03.440]  By the way, Anthony, I'm not kicking your, I'm kissing your ass.
[03:19:03.440 --> 03:19:06.960]  I was sitting there eating my lunch in the studio watching you and I'm gonna just say
[03:19:06.960 --> 03:19:12.240]  this is some of the best 15 minutes of radio describing how I feel I've ever heard.
[03:19:12.240 --> 03:19:14.360]  So I'm gonna air this at the start of the show tomorrow.
[03:19:14.360 --> 03:19:18.400]  I'm telling you, you are, I mean, you've just crystallized how we all feel.
[03:19:18.400 --> 03:19:19.400]  Exactly.
[03:19:19.400 --> 03:19:20.400]  I mean, I'm turning it back over to you.
[03:19:20.400 --> 03:19:24.680]  I've just got to say best radio laying out reality I've ever heard in the last year and
[03:19:24.680 --> 03:19:25.680]  a half.
[03:19:25.680 --> 03:19:26.680]  Go ahead.
[03:19:26.680 --> 03:19:27.680]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:19:27.680 --> 03:19:28.680]  Jesus.
[03:19:28.680 --> 03:19:29.680]  What?
[03:19:29.680 --> 03:19:30.840]  I love Alex Young.
[03:19:30.840 --> 03:19:31.840]  I love him.
[03:19:31.840 --> 03:19:36.560]  I was watching some of his debate coverage last night and talk about getting hot.
[03:19:36.560 --> 03:19:39.600]  Don't let me interrupt you because I want to hear this goal.
[03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:41.080]  I shouldn't have jumped in here.
[03:19:41.080 --> 03:19:43.000]  I shouldn't have jumped in here.
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:44.000]  I shouldn't have jumped in here.
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:45.000]  You take over.
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:46.000]  Don't talk about me when we come back.
[03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:47.000]  No, it's okay.
[03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:48.000]  You get back into your groove.
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  I just want to say it's gold.
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:50.200]  Everybody resonates with you.
[03:19:50.200 --> 03:19:51.200]  This is what's happening.
[03:19:51.200 --> 03:19:55.320]  This is about taking our country back, trumps the figurehead and these bastards are going
[03:19:55.320 --> 03:19:56.320]  down.
[03:19:56.320 --> 03:19:57.320]  Anthony, we're back in a few minutes.
[03:19:57.320 --> 03:19:58.320]  You take over.
[03:19:58.320 --> 03:19:59.320]  God bless you.
[03:19:59.320 --> 03:20:00.320]  Thank you, Alex.

[03:25:06.480 --> 03:25:13.480]  Anthony Kumiya here at Alex Jones' BeQuest.
[03:25:13.480 --> 03:25:15.560]  I'm thrilled, thrilled to be here.
[03:25:15.560 --> 03:25:20.440]  A little more with the debate, the reaction to it.
[03:25:20.440 --> 03:25:25.440]  I was watching afterwards, it's always, it's fun to watch the debate because you want to
[03:25:25.440 --> 03:25:37.320]  see who's getting in the jabs, who's making the points, watching the bias of the moderators.
[03:25:37.320 --> 03:25:42.600]  But it's after it settles down a little bit and you start watching the pundits come out
[03:25:42.600 --> 03:25:49.200]  and the news and every talking head comes out and starts their take on what they had
[03:25:49.200 --> 03:25:51.000]  just watched on the debate.
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:26:00.080]  And what I saw was pretty disgusting and not to be unexpected.
[03:26:00.080 --> 03:26:08.600]  The media jumped on Donald Trump saying he wouldn't automatically say he would support
[03:26:08.600 --> 03:26:12.120]  Hillary Clinton if he does lose.
[03:26:12.120 --> 03:26:22.360]  Did he graciously call her up, give that concession speech and say that we all have to rally behind
[03:26:22.360 --> 03:26:25.200]  our new president?
[03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:27.320]  And they unloaded on him.
[03:26:27.320 --> 03:26:29.160]  The media unloaded.
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:36.960]  This is, oh, how dare he not say the way this is the way democracy has worked forever here
[03:26:36.960 --> 03:26:37.960]  in the country.
[03:26:37.960 --> 03:26:38.960]  They battle it out.
[03:26:38.960 --> 03:26:40.640]  We get a winner and a loser.
[03:26:40.640 --> 03:26:47.480]  The loser graciously get, well, how about it's worked that way forever in a democracy,
[03:26:47.480 --> 03:26:51.040]  but we've never seen an election like this.
[03:26:51.040 --> 03:26:53.200]  This is new territory.
[03:26:53.200 --> 03:26:58.800]  We've never seen a media so one sided.
[03:26:58.800 --> 03:27:07.640]  We've never seen the opposition supported by a media that has just dumped, dump trucks
[03:27:07.640 --> 03:27:11.920]  full of garbage on top of the opposition.
[03:27:11.920 --> 03:27:18.080]  And he's now just supposed to go, oh, yeah, after all said and done, after I've been completely
[03:27:18.080 --> 03:27:28.120]  screwed over, I will graciously shake Hillary's hand and allow her to literally destroy the
[03:27:28.120 --> 03:27:30.120]  country.
[03:27:30.120 --> 03:27:33.360]  And they can't imagine this again.
[03:27:33.360 --> 03:27:35.640]  This isn't a politician.
[03:27:35.640 --> 03:27:44.400]  This is a businessman, a successful businessman who has spent his time in a very competitive,
[03:27:44.400 --> 03:27:52.400]  real world scenario, not like Washington, the fantasy world they live in on the hill.
[03:27:52.400 --> 03:28:00.760]  This is the real world and a real man who can't just slap a fake smile on his face and say
[03:28:00.760 --> 03:28:09.800]  everything's dandy after being ridden out of town on a rail pretty much.
[03:28:09.800 --> 03:28:14.520]  And for that, of course, he's taking all kinds of flak.
[03:28:14.520 --> 03:28:21.640]  Meanwhile, there are plenty of instances in which the Democrats have done instead the
[03:28:21.640 --> 03:28:24.240]  same thing.
[03:28:24.240 --> 03:28:32.640]  One of which being Al Gore, with his loss over George W. Bush, saying that he wouldn't
[03:28:32.640 --> 03:28:36.240]  accept the election.
[03:28:36.240 --> 03:28:37.240]  There it is.
[03:28:37.240 --> 03:28:41.840]  Gore refused to concede election, demands recount to ensure all the votes are counted.
[03:28:41.840 --> 03:28:49.160]  Well, I guess they thought there was a little hijinks and chicanery going on, shenanigans,
[03:28:49.160 --> 03:28:52.080]  if you will, going on back in that election.
[03:28:52.080 --> 03:29:00.920]  But again, again, all we see is this constant hypocrisy from the left.
[03:29:00.920 --> 03:29:02.800]  You can't do it.
[03:29:02.800 --> 03:29:06.800]  We've done it plenty of times, but don't you dare do it.
[03:29:06.800 --> 03:29:13.640]  There's an interesting story of hypocrisy when it comes to Donald Trump.
[03:29:13.640 --> 03:29:19.960]  His horrific, oh, horrific statements that he made on that bus.
[03:29:19.960 --> 03:29:27.040]  And something that just happened the other day that Madonna said, oh, the queen, one
[03:29:27.040 --> 03:29:33.920]  of the queens of the left, Madonna, said something, yes, there it is.
[03:29:33.920 --> 03:29:40.640]  She pledges oral sex for Clinton voters, yet Donald Trump, what he said in a private conversation
[03:29:40.640 --> 03:29:44.360]  years ago seems to be an issue.
[03:29:44.360 --> 03:29:47.480]  The hypocrisy is never ending.
[03:29:47.480 --> 03:29:50.600]  And please, if you don't see it, take the blinders off.
[03:29:50.600 --> 03:29:51.600]  We'll be right.
[03:29:51.600 --> 03:29:52.600]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.600 --> 03:30:02.040]  The empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:30:02.040 --> 03:30:07.480]  Whatever happened to billionaire Mark Rich, one of the world's most wanted fugitives, who
[03:30:07.480 --> 03:30:13.160]  16 years ago was being indicted on one of the biggest tax fraud cases in American history.
[03:30:13.160 --> 03:30:18.800]  And he was also involved in illegal trade deals with Iran and other crimes that were
[03:30:18.800 --> 03:30:23.080]  harsh enough to put him on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list.
[03:30:23.080 --> 03:30:28.040]  Well, Mark Rich may have been a career criminal, but he wasn't stupid because he knew the best
[03:30:28.040 --> 03:30:34.080]  way to receive his get out of jail free card was to donate money to the Clintons.
[03:30:34.080 --> 03:30:38.760]  Mark Rich gave a half million dollars to the Clinton library and, lo and behold, after
[03:30:38.760 --> 03:30:43.600]  20 years of running from the law, he was pardoned by President Bill Clinton.
[03:30:43.600 --> 03:30:49.160]  Rich died in 2013, but his business partners continued to donate huge amounts of money
[03:30:49.160 --> 03:30:56.600]  to the Clintons, including a $1 billion pledge to the Clinton Global Initiative in 2009.
[03:30:56.600 --> 03:30:58.040]  That is Clinton justice.
[03:30:58.040 --> 03:31:01.880]  And you can learn more right now at info wars.com.

[03:32:34.400 --> 03:32:35.400]  government.
[03:32:35.400 --> 03:32:39.080]  We're the solution Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that.

[03:33:20.720 --> 03:33:22.720]  Alex Jones show.
[03:33:22.720 --> 03:33:34.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back info wars dot com, I'm Anthony Kumiya, we were talking
[03:33:34.800 --> 03:33:44.680]  about the debate and I want to talk a little about these WikiLeaks emails, which just is
[03:33:44.680 --> 03:33:51.400]  getting brushed over, brushed over so much more important to hear what Donald Trump said
[03:33:51.400 --> 03:33:59.400]  in a private conversation years ago, or the nine women is it that have come out of nowhere
[03:33:59.400 --> 03:34:07.120]  to accuse Donald Trump of some type of sexual improprieties, I don't know.
[03:34:07.120 --> 03:34:14.760]  The guy has been in the public eye for 40 years is it about 40 years and if you've lived
[03:34:14.760 --> 03:34:21.040]  in New York, you've known Donald Trump your entire life if you're under 70 years old.
[03:34:21.040 --> 03:34:25.800]  He's been in the public eye that long, we've never heard any of these allegations, never
[03:34:25.800 --> 03:34:32.280]  heard it, never heard him called a racist in all the years that he's been in the public
[03:34:32.280 --> 03:34:40.760]  eye, hosting the apprentice as a builder, as somebody who's dealt with all the mayors
[03:34:40.760 --> 03:34:48.080]  in New York over the years building and creating here in New York City.
[03:34:48.080 --> 03:34:56.080]  But for some reason, just weeks before the election, all these allegations come out of
[03:34:56.080 --> 03:35:02.760]  nowhere, and we're supposed to give them as much credibility and credence that we give
[03:35:02.760 --> 03:35:10.600]  to the Bill Clinton allegations, which have been going on for decades and decades, years.
[03:35:10.600 --> 03:35:13.760]  We've heard about these women.
[03:35:13.760 --> 03:35:17.080]  They have been put up to the test.
[03:35:17.080 --> 03:35:18.840]  They have been deemed credible.
[03:35:18.840 --> 03:35:26.240]  They have been battered by Hillary Clinton, who has done nothing but protect her meal
[03:35:26.240 --> 03:35:34.400]  ticket and her coat tail that she has latched on to for her own career.
[03:35:34.400 --> 03:35:36.600]  There lies the difference.
[03:35:36.600 --> 03:35:41.360]  If you have credible women that have come forward over the course of decades and are
[03:35:41.360 --> 03:35:48.240]  still there fighting the fight, and we're supposed to believe that's the same thing
[03:35:48.240 --> 03:35:56.600]  as women that have come out of nowhere weeks before the election, put up front by a media
[03:35:56.600 --> 03:36:08.360]  that has proven to be dishonest and biased against Donald Trump, I hope, I pray that
[03:36:08.360 --> 03:36:15.560]  Americans are smarter than the press is giving us credit for.
[03:36:15.560 --> 03:36:24.240]  I really hope that they can see through this garbage and see the truth.
[03:36:24.240 --> 03:36:27.520]  Megan Kelly was talking with Donna Brazil last night.
[03:36:27.520 --> 03:36:33.480]  She of course, the DNC interim chairperson, because if you remember the chairperson was
[03:36:33.480 --> 03:36:40.120]  thrown out Wasserman thrown out because of her emails.
[03:36:40.120 --> 03:36:49.240]  So now we have Brazil, who was questioned by Megan Kelly last night about her emails
[03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:59.760]  and about allegations that she received questions before one of the debates and gave them over
[03:36:59.760 --> 03:37:02.040]  to Hillary Clinton.
[03:37:02.040 --> 03:37:04.620]  Let her know what those questions were going to be.
[03:37:04.620 --> 03:37:12.240]  She emailed a version of a question, and it was verbatim the question that was asked
[03:37:12.240 --> 03:37:14.920]  to the candidates and to Hillary Clinton.
[03:37:14.920 --> 03:37:24.600]  She knew, and of course, she said that these emails, first of all, she saw that some of
[03:37:24.600 --> 03:37:32.320]  them were fabricated, never saying the one that she sent out was fabricated.
[03:37:32.320 --> 03:37:34.680]  Some of those emails fabricated.
[03:37:34.680 --> 03:37:40.680]  She wouldn't go out on a limb and say, no, mine, the one that shows me saying this was
[03:37:40.680 --> 03:37:41.680]  fake.
[03:37:41.680 --> 03:37:47.380]  Because these things all bubble to the surface, my friends, they all come to the surface.
[03:37:47.380 --> 03:37:52.040]  You could lie about it now, but oh, it'll go bite you in a rump later.
[03:37:52.040 --> 03:38:03.160]  She also said that Megan Kelly was using these stolen emails, not saying that what
[03:38:03.160 --> 03:38:12.600]  was on them might be true, but that the fact that they were stolen hacked emails, that's
[03:38:12.600 --> 03:38:13.880]  the issue.
[03:38:13.880 --> 03:38:19.680]  Just trying her best, like all of these people that have been caught with their pants down
[03:38:19.680 --> 03:38:27.320]  on these WikiLeaks emails are trying, they're scrambling, and they're all dirty.
[03:38:27.320 --> 03:38:32.160]  Every single one of these people that have been doing correspondence with each other,
[03:38:32.160 --> 03:38:35.480]  whose emails have come out, are filthy.
[03:38:35.480 --> 03:38:39.760]  They're liars, and they're hypocrites.
[03:38:39.760 --> 03:38:45.840]  They're making fun of their constituents, identifying them for what they are, nothing
[03:38:45.840 --> 03:38:46.840]  but votes.
[03:38:46.840 --> 03:38:55.560]  This, oh, we care about the people, we care about minorities, we care about the undocumented
[03:38:55.560 --> 03:39:00.240]  immigrants, and then they're making fun of them in the emails, and proving that they
[03:39:00.240 --> 03:39:05.360]  are nothing but votes for these people.
[03:39:05.360 --> 03:39:09.800]  Again, please smack the blinders off your head.
[03:39:09.800 --> 03:39:16.800]  I know that for years the mainstream media has been our source for information.
[03:39:16.800 --> 03:39:18.600]  We went to the news.
[03:39:18.600 --> 03:39:24.560]  As a kid, I remember mom and dad sitting down in front of the TV, don't watch Walter
[03:39:24.560 --> 03:39:30.160]  Bunkard tell us about we are mom, and it was, we trusted the guy.
[03:39:30.160 --> 03:39:31.760]  We trusted the news.
[03:39:31.760 --> 03:39:35.440]  We discussed it with our friends and family.
[03:39:35.440 --> 03:39:37.360]  That's dead.
[03:39:37.360 --> 03:39:40.520]  That whole thing is gone.
[03:39:40.520 --> 03:39:45.200]  Don't go back to the news thinking you're getting the news.
[03:39:45.200 --> 03:39:53.440]  You're getting an entertainment show that is entrusted to make money just like Seinfeld,
[03:39:53.440 --> 03:40:02.000]  just like any other show that is, its main purpose is to make money for the company that's
[03:40:02.000 --> 03:40:03.800]  putting it out.
[03:40:03.800 --> 03:40:08.000]  The news is no longer there to serve the public interest.
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:13.960]  It is there to entertain you so you come back the next day to their continuing soap
[03:40:13.960 --> 03:40:16.640]  operas storylines.
[03:40:16.640 --> 03:40:18.840]  It's not information anymore.
[03:40:18.840 --> 03:40:29.480]  Your job as an American in 2016 is to find places to get real information, to get the
[03:40:29.480 --> 03:40:34.280]  truth, to try to balance it out with other sources.
[03:40:34.280 --> 03:40:37.840]  Yeah, it's going to take a lot more work than it used to.
[03:40:37.840 --> 03:40:45.640]  Just to sit down in front of a trusted face and get what you assumed was an unbiased report
[03:40:45.640 --> 03:40:53.920]  of the news that you then mold around with your own ideology and came up with a conclusion.
[03:40:53.920 --> 03:41:01.960]  Now they will spoon feed you their opinions and you'll go off and yap the company line
[03:41:01.960 --> 03:41:10.600]  and their opinions and it might sound harmless and a lot of times we laugh about the media
[03:41:10.600 --> 03:41:19.800]  bias and how ridiculous it is, but we are talking about the media influencing the direction
[03:41:19.800 --> 03:41:22.400]  this country is going to go in.
[03:41:22.400 --> 03:41:29.720]  These two candidates are so starkly different that whichever one gets in, the direction
[03:41:29.720 --> 03:41:34.640]  of the country is going off in completely different directions.
[03:41:34.640 --> 03:41:40.920]  This isn't a slight turn to the right or left here and the media is absolutely influencing
[03:41:40.920 --> 03:41:46.120]  that and it's very important, very dangerous and that's what we're voting for.
[03:41:46.120 --> 03:41:53.360]  We're voting for the sanctity of our freedoms and our rights in this country.
[03:41:53.360 --> 03:42:01.640]  Hillary Clinton was talking about guns, last night the topic of gun control came up in
[03:42:01.640 --> 03:42:10.080]  the debates and the second she starts talking about guns, I want to throw up.
[03:42:10.080 --> 03:42:17.800]  She has not an interest in allowing the American people to exercise their second amendment right
[03:42:17.800 --> 03:42:27.840]  and to see her try to dance around it and try to convince people that she respects your
[03:42:27.840 --> 03:42:37.400]  right to bear arms is disgusting and just a continuing display of her dishonesty and
[03:42:37.400 --> 03:42:39.520]  lies.
[03:42:39.520 --> 03:42:49.040]  She does not wish you to have the ability to protect yourself with the best tool available
[03:42:49.040 --> 03:42:50.920]  which is a firearm.
[03:42:50.920 --> 03:42:58.600]  Let's be real here, a gun is the greatest tool you can find in protecting yourself.
[03:42:58.600 --> 03:43:02.320]  It evens the playing field immediately.
[03:43:02.320 --> 03:43:06.880]  You're a small, you're a slight woman, you're out there on the street, you're walking home
[03:43:06.880 --> 03:43:14.640]  from work, a giant man comes up and wants to do you harm, what are you going to do?
[03:43:14.640 --> 03:43:22.600]  You're not going to fight this guy off, you're going to run in your cute little heels, no.
[03:43:22.600 --> 03:43:29.480]  But with a firearm, there you go, even keel, you're all, you're on even footing.
[03:43:29.480 --> 03:43:31.760]  She don't want that for you.
[03:43:31.760 --> 03:43:33.760]  You know why?
[03:43:33.760 --> 03:43:35.560]  She doesn't care.
[03:43:35.560 --> 03:43:37.680]  She's got the secret service.
[03:43:37.680 --> 03:43:43.440]  Saddam for a long time, she's had personal security for quite some time.
[03:43:43.440 --> 03:43:52.400]  And she thinks that we as Americans are all way, way too stupid and way too irresponsible
[03:43:52.400 --> 03:43:59.040]  to own something so dangerous as a firearm.
[03:43:59.040 --> 03:44:06.960]  While I disagree, there are hundreds of millions of firearms in this country that are used
[03:44:06.960 --> 03:44:12.200]  on a daily basis to protect people.
[03:44:12.200 --> 03:44:17.760]  There are hundreds of millions of guns in this country that aren't used on a daily basis.
[03:44:17.760 --> 03:44:23.760]  That's sit there, wherever they're stored, doing nothing, harming nobody.
[03:44:23.760 --> 03:44:26.080]  But they're there if you need them.
[03:44:26.080 --> 03:44:27.360]  She don't want you to have that.
[03:44:27.360 --> 03:44:36.680]  But she's saying she wants and this one gets me every time, oh my God, reasonable restrictions.
[03:44:36.680 --> 03:44:41.720]  You know what reasonable restrictions amounts to when it comes to a Democrat?
[03:44:41.720 --> 03:44:45.600]  It's like when they talk about your fair share of taxes.
[03:44:45.600 --> 03:44:48.300]  It's something that never stops.
[03:44:48.300 --> 03:44:50.880]  It never has an end.
[03:44:50.880 --> 03:44:55.240]  We want you to do your fair share, pay your fair share of taxes.
[03:44:55.240 --> 03:44:56.880]  All right, what's that?
[03:44:56.880 --> 03:44:58.120]  Well this is it now.
[03:44:58.120 --> 03:44:59.760]  We've just raised your taxes.
[03:44:59.760 --> 03:45:03.440]  All right, I guess I'm doing my fair share.
[03:45:03.440 --> 03:45:08.160]  They need to do their fair, wait, but I just did it.
[03:45:08.160 --> 03:45:14.600]  You just told me and then I, yeah, but there's a new fair share that you're not doing.
[03:45:14.600 --> 03:45:20.320]  It's the same thing, not paying their fair share.
[03:45:20.320 --> 03:45:25.000]  How much is a fair share totally becomes a very unfair share?
[03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:28.880]  Same thing with the reasonable restrictions on guns.
[03:45:28.880 --> 03:45:30.560]  Well, that's reasonable.
[03:45:30.560 --> 03:45:33.360]  Okay, are we going to stick with that?
[03:45:33.360 --> 03:45:34.360]  Yeah.
[03:45:34.360 --> 03:45:37.440]  Oh, there's more reasonable restrictions we need.
[03:45:37.440 --> 03:45:44.840]  That's not always reasonable, but here's some more reasonable until it becomes, yes,
[03:45:44.840 --> 03:45:47.240]  unreasonable.
[03:45:47.240 --> 03:45:49.240]  And it's always the way.
[03:45:49.240 --> 03:45:57.480]  Don't get caught up in believing that fair share will be fair, reasonable restrictions
[03:45:57.480 --> 03:45:59.200]  will be reasonable.
[03:45:59.200 --> 03:46:06.760]  They have proven time and time again that once we make any capitulation, they will come
[03:46:06.760 --> 03:46:08.320]  back for more.
[03:46:08.320 --> 03:46:10.480]  They always do.
[03:46:10.480 --> 03:46:16.960]  That's why we need people and organizations like the National Rifle Association who has
[03:46:16.960 --> 03:46:21.120]  been the scourge of the left and the Democrats.
[03:46:21.120 --> 03:46:28.160]  They look at them like they want nothing more than to allow people to exercise their second
[03:46:28.160 --> 03:46:29.160]  amendment right.
[03:46:29.160 --> 03:46:34.160]  My God, it's crazy, shall not be infringed.
[03:46:34.160 --> 03:46:35.680]  That's what the second amendment is.
[03:46:35.680 --> 03:46:40.480]  And that's what the NRA wants for the American people.
[03:46:40.480 --> 03:46:42.960]  And they're looked at like monsters.
[03:46:42.960 --> 03:46:47.040]  And when Hillary Clinton came out on that stage last night for that debate and said
[03:46:47.040 --> 03:46:53.040]  that she is for the second amendment, but with reasonable restrictions, I look at a
[03:46:53.040 --> 03:46:57.040]  state like my home state of New York.
[03:46:57.040 --> 03:47:02.560]  And I've heard so many times from people, no one's taking your guns away.
[03:47:02.560 --> 03:47:06.920]  Like they got to say it in a way that sounds like you're a paranoid lunatic that thinks
[03:47:06.920 --> 03:47:10.040]  that the government is coming to take your guns away.
[03:47:10.040 --> 03:47:13.880]  Well they are coming to take your guns away.
[03:47:13.880 --> 03:47:20.200]  Go into a gun store in the state of New York, ask for an AR-15.
[03:47:20.200 --> 03:47:24.320]  You will be told you are not allowed to buy one.
[03:47:24.320 --> 03:47:28.440]  Now there are plenty of other rifles to buy, am I right?
[03:47:28.440 --> 03:47:34.760]  I walk into a New York state gun store now, it looks like the 1800s lever action.
[03:47:34.760 --> 03:47:38.080]  I see lever action guns.
[03:47:38.080 --> 03:47:44.080]  You can't buy what they dub an assault rifle, which by the way is a scary looking rifle.
[03:47:44.080 --> 03:47:45.080]  Nothing more.
[03:47:45.080 --> 03:47:47.280]  It's a semi-automatic rifle.
[03:47:47.280 --> 03:47:49.960]  You can't buy one in New York state anymore.
[03:47:49.960 --> 03:47:53.160]  They're illegal to buy.
[03:47:53.160 --> 03:48:04.560]  That is the government taking away your guns, taking away your right to the best tool available.
[03:48:04.560 --> 03:48:08.480]  And that is their idea of reasonable restriction.
[03:48:08.480 --> 03:48:09.480]  Have they stopped?
[03:48:09.480 --> 03:48:10.480]  No.
[03:48:10.480 --> 03:48:16.520]  They are continually trying to whittle down the types of firearms you're allowed to have
[03:48:16.520 --> 03:48:23.920]  in this country with the final goal of either leaving us with muskets or with nothing.
[03:48:23.920 --> 03:48:24.920]  There you go.
[03:48:24.920 --> 03:48:27.320]  Hey, let me tell you, that's a fine rifle.
[03:48:27.320 --> 03:48:29.080]  I own one myself.
[03:48:29.080 --> 03:48:30.520]  I love it.
[03:48:30.520 --> 03:48:40.680]  But I also want an AR-15 because in a day and age where you're not sure how many people
[03:48:40.680 --> 03:48:45.560]  you might have to defend yourself, your loved ones, and your family against, I want something
[03:48:45.560 --> 03:48:53.920]  that might blow a few rounds out quicker than old Doc Holliday might be shooting.
[03:48:53.920 --> 03:48:58.800]  Again, they'll paint you as a paranoid lunatic on this.
[03:48:58.800 --> 03:49:04.920]  But this is exactly what Hillary and the Democrats on the left are talking about.
[03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:13.360]  Reasonable restrictions, again, until they become very unreasonable.
[03:49:13.360 --> 03:49:16.240]  The economy, I love that.
[03:49:16.240 --> 03:49:21.480]  Last night during the debate, Hillary trying to go up against Trump on the economy.
[03:49:21.480 --> 03:49:28.680]  Here's a guy that has been able to do business in any type of economy you could come up with.
[03:49:28.680 --> 03:49:37.560]  The recession, windfall, every type of economy he has been able to successfully run and continue
[03:49:37.560 --> 03:49:39.760]  to run his business.
[03:49:39.760 --> 03:49:45.600]  And Hillary is trying to tell us that she has the right ideas.
[03:49:45.600 --> 03:49:52.120]  She's been part of the Obama administration who has had eight years to work on this.
[03:49:52.120 --> 03:49:57.160]  And I love the fact that Donald Trump brought up, hey, you've had time.
[03:49:57.160 --> 03:50:04.320]  And that's the greatest thing Trump could bring up with Hillary is her record and her
[03:50:04.320 --> 03:50:09.800]  experience that she's had in office.
[03:50:09.800 --> 03:50:17.040]  Because every problem that we're facing today as a country, she has been involved with the
[03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:22.080]  organization that was supposed to fix it.
[03:50:22.080 --> 03:50:23.080]  She's a politician.
[03:50:23.080 --> 03:50:25.080]  She's the one that wrote the laws.
[03:50:25.080 --> 03:50:27.760]  She has been secretary of state.
[03:50:27.760 --> 03:50:31.920]  She has had the ear of the president.
[03:50:31.920 --> 03:50:41.080]  And we have gone down the proverbial toilet under her and Obama and her ilk's watch.
[03:50:41.080 --> 03:50:46.440]  And to say that, well, put me in charge, I'll fix it.
[03:50:46.440 --> 03:50:49.080]  You were there already.
[03:50:49.080 --> 03:50:51.400]  You were in charge.
[03:50:51.400 --> 03:50:52.880]  And nothing happened.
[03:50:52.880 --> 03:51:02.880]  It's up to you, people, we'll be right back.
[03:51:02.880 --> 03:51:09.480]  Extendivite, a seven-herb combination of garlic, cayenne, hotthorn, bilberry, ginkobloba, valerian,
[03:51:09.480 --> 03:51:11.160]  and milk thistle.
[03:51:11.160 --> 03:51:15.080]  Extendivite is designed to strengthen the heart and arteries and help the body heal
[03:51:15.080 --> 03:51:16.720]  itself.
[03:51:16.720 --> 03:51:20.480]  Doctors are not able to explain the improvements they're seeing in their patients' health
[03:51:20.480 --> 03:51:22.600]  who are taking Extendivite.
[03:51:22.600 --> 03:51:27.160]  People who once needed more pills are now taking less and getting better.
[03:51:27.160 --> 03:51:32.080]  Due to the unexplainable improvements in their patients' health, more doctors are calling
[03:51:32.080 --> 03:51:35.000]  to order Extendivite for themselves.
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:38.040]  Help Extendivite make your doctor a believer.
[03:51:38.040 --> 03:51:43.080]  Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a two-month supply.

[03:55:15.280 --> 03:55:22.320]  Hello. Welcome back. Anthony Kumi here on Infowars.com. I also want to talk a little
[03:55:22.320 --> 03:55:32.040]  today about Russia. Russia has become this giant thing again. Remember after the Cold
[03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:40.080]  War? It was cute and quaint when we talked about the old Soviet Union, nostalgic, thinking
[03:55:40.080 --> 03:55:47.800]  about Reagan and Brezhnev back in the old days, thinking about nuclear missiles pointing
[03:55:47.800 --> 03:55:57.480]  at us. And then Berlin Wall comes down, little perestroika, glass nose, all that fun stuff,
[03:55:57.480 --> 03:56:02.600]  and then kind of went away. They had their stuff to deal with there. We had our stuff
[03:56:02.600 --> 03:56:09.240]  to deal with here. We knew we still had nuclear missiles pointing at each other, but it wasn't
[03:56:09.240 --> 03:56:17.080]  really an issue. It didn't feel like any fingers were on any triggers. And then all it takes,
[03:56:17.080 --> 03:56:27.240]  a few years of Barack Obama making our leadership pretty much disappear in the world to where
[03:56:27.240 --> 03:56:36.280]  Vladimir Putin and Russia are now the big man on campus and are able to wield their
[03:56:36.280 --> 03:56:48.080]  power and influence anywhere they damn well please. And we can't do anything about it.
[03:56:48.080 --> 03:56:54.640]  When Obama told Romney the 80s called and they want their foreign policy back when Romney
[03:56:54.640 --> 03:57:01.160]  was talking about Russia being one of the biggest geopolitical threats to the world
[03:57:01.160 --> 03:57:08.680]  four years ago, and Obama laughed. He laughed and made a joke. And the media laughed it
[03:57:08.680 --> 03:57:16.680]  up, loved it. Well, look where we are now. Why hasn't anyone literally called out Obama
[03:57:16.680 --> 03:57:23.600]  on that? Why haven't they questioned him and said, hey, what's your ideology now? Do you
[03:57:23.600 --> 03:57:29.240]  still think the 80s called and wants their foreign policy back? Do you think Hillary
[03:57:29.240 --> 03:57:37.400]  Clinton is the best person to deal with an empowered Russia and Vladimir Putin? I don't
[03:57:37.400 --> 03:57:48.200]  think so. Trump is getting so much heat by the media for praising Putin. He's not doing
[03:57:48.200 --> 03:57:56.840]  that. When you look at a leader that is strong, that is committed to their country, there
[03:57:56.840 --> 03:58:05.920]  is a bit of admiration there that you can reflect without praising the person for what
[03:58:05.920 --> 03:58:15.960]  he's doing. I think looking at a strong leader is something that makes American people nostalgic.
[03:58:15.960 --> 03:58:23.440]  We want that. We want somebody that's not going to roll over. And we want to be powerful
[03:58:23.440 --> 03:58:28.840]  and look at and respect it in this world like we used to. And I think that's part of what
[03:58:28.840 --> 03:58:37.400]  Make America Great Again means. Thank you, Anthony Comea, compoundmedia.com. I'm here
[03:58:37.400 --> 03:58:55.520]  for Imphal Wars. Have a great rest of your day.
