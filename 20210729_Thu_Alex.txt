[00:00.000 --> 00:17.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the globalist COVID takeover is reaching new levels of insanity,
[00:17.400 --> 00:24.560]  and it's causing even the dumbest of the dumb, the most brainwashed of the brainwashed, and
[00:24.560 --> 00:29.560]  even Hollywood liberals to open their eyes and wonder what the hell is going on.
[00:29.560 --> 00:31.960]  You told me I was good for being vaccinated.
[00:31.960 --> 00:35.200]  Now you're telling me I'm the reason for the spread.
[00:35.200 --> 00:38.400]  You have doctors saying it's time to put kids on ventilators.
[00:38.400 --> 00:41.840]  They got to get those numbers up, especially in the kids, because, you know, the kids aren't
[00:41.840 --> 00:44.520]  at risk of COVID, so they got to kill them somehow.
[00:44.520 --> 00:50.920]  And now they're doing autopsies of COVID vaccinated patient deaths, and they're finding spike
[00:50.920 --> 00:56.680]  proteins infesting every organ of the body, just like we told you and our great guests.
[00:56.680 --> 01:02.120]  And now the VAERS website is so overwhelmed with deadly reports from vaccinated people
[01:02.120 --> 01:04.640]  that it's currently offline.
[01:04.640 --> 01:07.960]  Alex Jones is on the line with us right now.
[01:07.960 --> 01:13.400]  Alex, it's hard to even ingest and digest all of this.
[01:13.400 --> 01:14.960]  It's coming in so fast now.
[01:14.960 --> 01:17.320]  Well, that's right.
[01:17.320 --> 01:21.720]  Every time I try to take a work occasion, the most intense things happen, and I've been
[01:21.720 --> 01:25.440]  listening and watching to you and the other hosts, and we've been really doing a great
[01:25.440 --> 01:29.840]  job chronicling this, but I've also just been glued to seeing what's happening.
[01:29.840 --> 01:35.080]  As you said, out there in the whole leftist world, you know, there have been Hollywood
[01:35.080 --> 01:40.680]  individuals out there that have really come out and viciously attacked me, like Michael
[01:40.680 --> 01:45.520]  Rappaport, talking about how he wants to, you know, beat me up, basically, and I'm a
[01:45.520 --> 01:47.560]  horrible person.
[01:47.560 --> 01:52.760]  But then now he's saying, hey, I took the vaccine, and now you're saying, I'm a super
[01:52.760 --> 01:53.760]  spreader.
[01:53.760 --> 01:54.760]  Screw you.
[01:54.760 --> 01:55.760]  I'm a hero.
[01:55.760 --> 01:56.760]  I'm a hero.
[01:56.760 --> 01:59.520]  So all these virtue signalers are finding out that this was all basically planned, and
[01:59.520 --> 02:06.080]  what's incredible, Owen, is all the real testing was done by Fauci and by Bill Gates
[02:06.080 --> 02:07.080]  in literally thousands.
[02:07.080 --> 02:11.600]  Now, we know thousands of studies, hundreds of big ones, several directed by the US government
[02:11.600 --> 02:17.760]  itself as large initiatives on just studies or projects, initiatives of the US government,
[02:17.760 --> 02:20.040]  you know, like the Manhattan Project was an initiative.
[02:20.040 --> 02:29.200]  Fauci had an initiative from about 2005 right through to 2019, funding giant level four
[02:29.200 --> 02:32.960]  bio weapons research into vaccines and attack spike proteins.
[02:32.960 --> 02:38.080]  He got all these studies, how it killed the rats and ferrets of their animals.
[02:38.080 --> 02:44.960]  And then we have Peter Dazek, the leader of Fauci's project at the Wuhan lab, giving
[02:44.960 --> 02:52.720]  an interview in 2019 saying we got five of these viruses we put together from China and
[02:52.720 --> 02:57.680]  the US, that was Chapel Hill and Mulan, we put them together to create one mega vaccine
[02:57.680 --> 03:01.640]  for all of these viruses, even though there was no threat, no one ever merged them.
[03:01.640 --> 03:07.680]  And then we have the internal documents that in December of 2019, the orders went from
[03:07.680 --> 03:12.200]  Fauci saying, prepare the COVID vaccine, it says it.
[03:12.200 --> 03:16.240]  And so I sit here and I see all these medical doctors finally figuring this out and all
[03:16.240 --> 03:19.480]  these scientists finally figuring it out and you're still having debates about whether
[03:19.480 --> 03:22.280]  it came out of Wuhan, but that's all old news.
[03:22.280 --> 03:23.880]  It's all open and shut.
[03:23.880 --> 03:25.960]  It's all right there for everybody to see.
[03:25.960 --> 03:29.760]  You have all the financial documents that people are now exposing with Bill Gates and
[03:29.760 --> 03:34.200]  these foundations saying we're going to make the biggest profits ever off of this.
[03:34.200 --> 03:38.080]  It's all a media driven thing to not just make money, that's how they get the hospitals
[03:38.080 --> 03:43.920]  and the systems to go along with the ventilators, murdering people for $53,000.
[03:43.920 --> 03:47.200]  That's the incentive for the grassroots to go along with the investors.
[03:47.200 --> 03:49.920]  But at the top, it's about eugenics, it's about world government, it's about world
[03:49.920 --> 03:53.360]  ID, it's about a social credit score and they now admit all that.
[03:53.360 --> 03:55.560]  So this is a true war.
[03:55.560 --> 04:00.440]  I'm sick to my stomach all the time now because I have a responsibility to fight this and
[04:00.440 --> 04:02.040]  I'm not planning anything violent.
[04:02.040 --> 04:06.400]  I'm just saying, everybody's saying this now, these are violent people assaulting us.
[04:06.400 --> 04:09.880]  It's going to come out, they're assaulting us and so we have to understand we need to
[04:09.880 --> 04:13.000]  war game this now because we're tomorrow's this today.
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.680]  They're going to stage false flags against themselves to make pro-vaxxers look like victims
[04:17.680 --> 04:22.200]  and or launch a new war and or cyberattacking in the bloke economy and or a massive white
[04:22.200 --> 04:23.840]  supremacist attack they stage.
[04:23.840 --> 04:26.800]  That's all the pre-programming in the media so you know what's coming.
[04:26.800 --> 04:32.800]  Like you said, excellent analogy yesterday for people that were obsessed with football,
[04:32.800 --> 04:38.040]  now, when I was sitting there with my grandfather watching the Dallas Cowboys on Sundays, we
[04:38.040 --> 04:42.440]  did actually go to the game sometimes as we're here in Dallas, Texas.
[04:42.440 --> 04:45.960]  He would sit there and he'd go, okay, watch, they're about to do this play because he played
[04:45.960 --> 04:50.080]  football at UT, he was obsessed with football, he was roommates with Tom Landry, all that
[04:50.080 --> 04:51.080]  stuff.
[04:51.080 --> 04:53.080]  He was obsessed with football, he always knew the play, the teams were going to run.
[04:53.080 --> 04:56.080]  Well, I didn't know that because I wasn't really into football, I still watched it.
[04:56.080 --> 04:58.080]  It's the same thing, we know the damn plays.
[04:58.080 --> 05:02.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here, the host of the Info Wars War Room and I'm very
[05:02.200 --> 05:06.920]  excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[05:06.920 --> 05:12.000]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time
[05:12.000 --> 05:17.720]  and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com.
[05:17.720 --> 05:20.800]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[05:20.800 --> 05:26.240]  Listen to this, organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic
[05:26.240 --> 05:32.080]  cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[05:32.080 --> 05:35.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[05:35.480 --> 05:39.720]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health and we've packed
[05:39.720 --> 05:43.960]  it all in to fibergreencaps at InfoWarsStore.com.
[05:43.960 --> 05:47.720]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[05:47.720 --> 05:52.800]  I suggest that you do the same thing and right now it's at an introductory price of
[05:52.800 --> 06:11.080]  $19.95 that's 33% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[06:11.080 --> 06:22.080]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:22.080 --> 06:28.040]  And Alex on the road, but dialed in with us, Owen Troyer in studio here.
[06:28.040 --> 06:33.160]  The Alex Jones show is live on this Thursday, July 29th, 2021.
[06:33.160 --> 06:37.800]  InfoWars still on air thanks to God's grace and thanks to you supporting us at InfoWarsStore.com.
[06:37.800 --> 06:42.520]  And boy, oh boy, is it a good thing InfoWars is on air to bring you all this news because
[06:42.520 --> 06:46.400]  even though I'm seeing some conservatives and even though I'm seeing some other people
[06:46.400 --> 06:52.360]  involved in talk shows and television news and other things getting more hardcore, nobody
[06:52.360 --> 06:55.760]  still quite does it like InfoWars does.
[06:55.760 --> 06:59.840]  A lot of these subjects of discussion, most people are still afraid to broach, but not
[06:59.840 --> 07:03.640]  here, ladies and gentlemen, not Alex Jones, not our crew.
[07:03.640 --> 07:05.320]  And so it's our honor to be here with you.
[07:05.320 --> 07:11.280]  And Alex, as we said in the opening segment, there's really just so much to digest right
[07:11.280 --> 07:12.280]  now.
[07:12.280 --> 07:14.720]  I'm not even sure what the biggest thing is.
[07:14.720 --> 07:18.640]  Is it doctors announcing they want to put kids on ventilators and blow their lungs out?
[07:18.640 --> 07:22.920]  Is it the autopsies of the COVID deaths, finding spike proteins all over their bodies?
[07:22.920 --> 07:27.520]  Like we said, is it the VAERS website being offline because of all the deaths being reported?
[07:27.520 --> 07:29.120]  It was shut down.
[07:29.120 --> 07:34.160]  Is it Pelosi threatening to arrest Republicans that don't want to wear a mask inside a Congress?
[07:34.160 --> 07:36.120]  And now Republicans finally fighting back?
[07:36.120 --> 07:37.320]  I mean, took long enough.
[07:37.320 --> 07:40.320]  I mean, it's just all over the map right now, Alex.
[07:40.320 --> 07:42.480]  Well, it absolutely is.
[07:42.480 --> 07:46.880]  And again, when we point out that Info Wars is the most accurate, the most hardcore, it's
[07:46.880 --> 07:51.000]  not because we're in competition with all these other great shows and other great programs.
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.680]  In fact, we want more when we love Tucker Carlson, you know, despite some of his problems.
[07:54.680 --> 07:59.280]  He does a great show of the same name as yours, Steve Bannon, the War Room.
[07:59.280 --> 08:00.280]  I love all these people.
[08:00.280 --> 08:01.280]  I love all these scientists.
[08:01.280 --> 08:02.280]  I love all these doctors.
[08:02.280 --> 08:07.720]  But behind the scenes, I talked to a lot of these people, these scientists particularly,
[08:07.720 --> 08:09.160]  and they'll go, you're the trailblazer.
[08:09.160 --> 08:10.640]  You woke us up.
[08:10.640 --> 08:14.440]  But you're just too controversial to even come on your show, which is fine.
[08:14.440 --> 08:18.800]  But it's actually great to be that radioactive black sheep that's so far out ahead of everybody
[08:18.800 --> 08:23.040]  that even though we've woken them up, we've gotten them engaged, we've got them informed,
[08:23.040 --> 08:25.200]  they can't dare touch, you know, that type of guys.
[08:25.200 --> 08:26.200]  And it's not about the credit.
[08:26.200 --> 08:30.360]  I mean, even Steve Bannon a month ago gave us credit and said, Alex Jones is a genius
[08:30.360 --> 08:33.760]  when it comes to understanding this stuff before it happens, that's not what's going
[08:33.760 --> 08:34.760]  on.
[08:34.760 --> 08:39.560]  I realize that I've got to say the things that are true from the globalist own admissions,
[08:39.560 --> 08:42.840]  despite the fact that it's dangerous, and despite the fact that it's horrible, and despite
[08:42.840 --> 08:47.800]  the fact that it really sounds rude to say these types of things, but I'm sorry, reality
[08:47.800 --> 08:48.800]  is reality.
[08:48.800 --> 08:52.040]  So let me just, since you mentioned that, here's what I'm going to do is I don't even
[08:52.040 --> 08:54.480]  have a lot of clips and a lot of things to cover.
[08:54.480 --> 08:57.120]  I'm going to be here with you until the bottom of the hour, and then I've got a bunch of
[08:57.120 --> 08:59.400]  clips and things I want to cover with you.
[08:59.400 --> 09:01.240]  You've already mentioned quite a few of them.
[09:01.240 --> 09:05.400]  So go ahead and cover those now, but I'm going to come back at the bottom of the next
[09:05.400 --> 09:10.160]  hour and just go over all of this, but this is some of the things I have here.
[09:10.160 --> 09:13.840]  I have 10 different clips, and I haven't sent all of them to the crew yet, so that's why
[09:13.840 --> 09:14.840]  I'm not ready.
[09:14.840 --> 09:15.840]  I've already sent them a couple of them.
[09:15.840 --> 09:17.920]  I'm sure, though, and then they probably already have most of what I'm about to ask
[09:17.920 --> 09:18.920]  for.
[09:18.920 --> 09:27.680]  But I have 10 clips, 10 clips that I saw just yesterday in this morning of MSNBC, CNN, ABCNES,
[09:27.680 --> 09:34.480]  congressional hearings, MPR, everything saying, don't let them have jobs, don't let them go
[09:34.480 --> 09:38.760]  to the grocery store, don't let them have food, take their children from them, deny
[09:38.760 --> 09:40.480]  them medical care.
[09:40.480 --> 09:42.480]  This is being said by members of Congress.
[09:42.480 --> 09:48.280]  So you talk about siege, you talk about violence, you pay into the system, you pay your taxes,
[09:48.280 --> 09:50.960]  you live your life, you pay for insurance.
[09:50.960 --> 09:54.240]  The last year and a half, I'll tell you, it's not essential, so you can't get all these
[09:54.240 --> 09:56.520]  things taken care of that you pay for.
[09:56.520 --> 10:02.400]  They steal all that money, and then they hold this hostage, and they stay to the world.
[10:02.400 --> 10:06.400]  Their kids are going to wear masks forever, CNN says we want them to be permanent.
[10:06.400 --> 10:10.320]  This is a cult takeover, and their talking points are what they really intend to do.
[10:10.320 --> 10:14.160]  Now we have Don Lemon, again, just one of the clips that I have time to send you guys,
[10:14.160 --> 10:21.440]  we'll play it here in a moment, saying that I don't want people to be able to eat, I don't
[10:21.440 --> 10:24.680]  want people to have a job, he means he wants you to starve to death.
[10:24.680 --> 10:27.080]  So that's the violence of CNN of this cult.
[10:27.080 --> 10:29.720]  They don't just want to censor you now, they don't want to just get rid of your country,
[10:29.720 --> 10:33.200]  they don't want you to just dissolve your borders and pay for a third world invasion,
[10:33.200 --> 10:34.200]  people they control.
[10:34.200 --> 10:38.080]  Now they come out in the open and say, this is about you not being able to get food or
[10:38.080 --> 10:43.240]  live or have a house or your children, which is the end game once they get this world ID,
[10:43.240 --> 10:48.040]  medical ID, social credit score system, in their own words, if you don't do what we say,
[10:48.040 --> 10:52.560]  you can't leave one half foot outside of your house or have food, we're going to starve
[10:52.560 --> 10:53.560]  you to death.
[10:53.560 --> 10:57.480]  So now CNN is literally saying, we're coming to force inject you, we're going to take your
[10:57.480 --> 11:05.120]  food away, we're going to take your children away, this is W-A-R, war, war, war, war.
[11:05.120 --> 11:09.680]  These are globalists, they are conquering us, this is premeditated, they knew the spike
[11:09.680 --> 11:13.600]  proteins were going to make millions sick and die, they knew in all the studies, the
[11:13.600 --> 11:15.400]  whole thing is a plan.
[11:15.400 --> 11:20.720]  So people say it makes no sense, it's confusing, they flip flop, they lie every day.
[11:20.720 --> 11:23.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's because they're following a war script.
[11:23.560 --> 11:27.080]  This is unconventional unrestricted warfare.
[11:27.080 --> 11:31.360]  This is the take down of the world, tens of millions are now starving to death on top
[11:31.360 --> 11:36.480]  of already died, though the UN is organizing the third world that collapses to invade us.
[11:36.480 --> 11:41.840]  So I've got hundreds of important points, but that's the central fact, it's their play,
[11:41.840 --> 11:46.480]  Klaus Schwab has written four books that are the playbook of the fourth industrial revolution
[11:46.480 --> 11:51.280]  on this whole situation with COVID-19 and the Great Reset.
[11:51.280 --> 11:56.280]  This is their plan, they're laughing at us, they think we're stupid because we're so naive
[11:56.280 --> 12:00.760]  and then I see all these people out there that are totally confused because I'm a hero,
[12:00.760 --> 12:05.960]  I took the shot and now I'm sicker, now I'm a super spreader, now I'm worse than people
[12:05.960 --> 12:06.960]  that don't take it.
[12:06.960 --> 12:11.920]  Yes, because you're the compliant group, so the fact that you keep submitting means
[12:11.920 --> 12:16.200]  the pimp keeps breaking your arm and puts cigarettes out on you.
[12:16.200 --> 12:17.200]  Submission is what?
[12:17.200 --> 12:18.200]  Death.
[12:18.200 --> 12:19.200]  Resistance is what?
[12:19.200 --> 12:20.200]  Victory.
[12:20.200 --> 12:25.720]  So the first thing I want to play for TV viewers is last night, Biden goes to a huge gala
[12:25.720 --> 12:34.600]  with over a thousand Democrats fundraisers in it, over a thousand Democrat Party contributors
[12:34.600 --> 12:39.240]  and he glad hands and shakes their hands and breathes in their face, which is totally normal
[12:39.240 --> 12:43.800]  and what you should be able to do, but this is after they announce a day after everybody's
[12:43.800 --> 12:48.280]  got to wear a mask again or we're all dead, again, they don't even care, there's not even
[12:48.280 --> 12:53.880]  a pretense of any of this going on because they've captured the central areas of the
[12:53.880 --> 12:59.320]  government, the first clip I want to play before we go to break is clip seven.
[12:59.320 --> 13:05.960]  This is Don Lemon on with, again, Governor Cuomo's brother, Governor Cuomo knowingly
[13:05.960 --> 13:12.520]  sent people sick with the flu and sick with COVID, COVID's a real thing folks and other
[13:12.520 --> 13:16.640]  things to the nursing homes while they lock the families out so they can then say, oh,
[13:16.640 --> 13:19.280]  you've got a cough, we're going to intubate you and kill you with a ventilator.
[13:19.280 --> 13:22.280]  I've got huge developments on ventilators coming up next segment.
[13:22.280 --> 13:27.560]  I'm glad I won't raise that because I have unbelievable information, but here is Don
[13:27.560 --> 13:34.160]  Lemon declaring war on America, war on the world, war on those that don't take an experimental
[13:34.160 --> 13:40.960]  shot unauthorized that is a gene therapy that half the CDC doctors won't even take themselves.
[13:40.960 --> 13:43.480]  Here's Don Lemon literally saying you want to starve to death.
[13:43.480 --> 13:48.040]  This is the logical progression of CNN that where they openly want you dead.
[13:48.040 --> 13:54.280]  I don't know, I'm sure a lot of people are not going to agree with this, but don't get
[13:54.280 --> 13:58.640]  the vaccine, you can't go to the supermarket, don't have the vaccine, you don't show it,
[13:58.640 --> 14:03.160]  can't go to the ball game, don't have the vaccine, can't go to work, you don't have
[14:03.160 --> 14:08.240]  the vaccine, can't come here, no shirt, no shoes, no service, that's what I think we
[14:08.240 --> 14:13.280]  should be right now because we continue to waste our breath on people who are just not
[14:13.280 --> 14:14.280]  going to change.
[14:14.280 --> 14:18.840]  They're circular logic, they just keep going back and saying, well, it's my freedom, it's
[14:18.840 --> 14:25.520]  whatever, I'm free, well, your kid's not free to give other kids meningitis in schools,
[14:25.520 --> 14:31.280]  you got to take a vaccine to do that, you got to take vaccines in order to be employed,
[14:31.280 --> 14:33.680]  so what is the big deal?
[14:33.680 --> 14:35.760]  And all these people were saying, I don't want to put this stuff in my bio.
[14:35.760 --> 14:38.880]  Oh yeah, that's enough of Don Lemon.
[14:38.880 --> 14:43.280]  So remember folks, everything that Don Lemon says is an inversion.
[14:43.280 --> 14:47.400]  Sometimes they get you with the medical ID, that's even bigger than the injections.
[14:47.400 --> 14:51.840]  Now they can actually turn it off so you can't get in the grocery store or get in your car
[14:51.840 --> 14:56.720]  or go to a job, that's the social credit score, that's the World ID, CloudShop admits that's
[14:56.720 --> 15:01.720]  the end game, and they now admit this is really a World ID in Europe, in the UK, in Australia.
[15:01.720 --> 15:05.280]  So he's trying to get the chains on you, just like a kidnapper wants to put handcuffs on
[15:05.280 --> 15:08.880]  you and put a gag in your mouth before he puts you in the back of the van to take you
[15:08.880 --> 15:09.880]  to the torture dungeon.
[15:09.880 --> 15:14.240]  So Don Lemon's like, just put the ball gag in, and look, it's Google, it's Facebook,
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.080]  it's all the Fortune 100 that are first implementing, no injection, no job.
[15:19.080 --> 15:22.760]  Of course they're all not going to give each other waivers on that, but just like they
[15:22.760 --> 15:26.200]  executed the lockdowns first a year and a half ago, they're all leading this.
[15:26.200 --> 15:31.080]  So I'll assure you, quite the declaration of war, we just saw, and that talking point
[15:31.080 --> 15:35.240]  isn't just what Macron said two weeks ago, isn't just what divorce Johnson said last
[15:35.240 --> 15:36.680]  week, they're now doing.
[15:36.680 --> 15:38.040]  This is being announced worldwide.
[15:38.040 --> 15:41.960]  So there's the talking point, you starve to death, you don't let us put an experimental
[15:41.960 --> 15:47.200]  shot at you that doesn't protect you, makes you a viral spreader and gives you blood clots
[15:47.200 --> 15:48.200]  and kills you.
[15:48.200 --> 15:51.080]  That's called holding people hostage, brother.
[15:51.080 --> 15:55.520]  And then just to come out and say on his show on live TV, just declare Americans aren't
[15:55.520 --> 15:56.520]  free anymore.
[15:56.520 --> 16:00.400]  Wow, what a bold statement.
[16:00.400 --> 16:02.400]  Your voice counts.
[16:02.400 --> 16:07.400]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[16:07.400 --> 16:10.000]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[16:10.000 --> 16:11.520]  They know you're angry.
[16:11.520 --> 16:15.840]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[16:15.840 --> 16:16.840]  we've got.
[16:16.840 --> 16:21.040]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can
[16:21.040 --> 16:25.280]  then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and
[16:25.280 --> 16:29.560]  special reports and share them with everyone you know, take action now by texting the word
[16:29.560 --> 16:47.040]  NEWS to 833-470-0438 or text the word show to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications.
[16:47.040 --> 16:51.520]  Take action now, rate the chain reaction until others to share those texts.
[16:51.520 --> 16:58.960]  Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[16:58.960 --> 17:06.160]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on and that its
[17:06.160 --> 17:11.000]  criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public, they do the same
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.440]  things over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and
[17:16.440 --> 17:17.440]  over again.
[17:17.440 --> 17:19.080]  Well, guess what?
[17:19.080 --> 17:27.040]  It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenesis Globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment
[17:27.040 --> 17:31.200]  of it with ACT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were
[17:31.200 --> 17:36.320]  the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the t-lint for
[17:36.320 --> 17:39.800]  sites in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[17:39.800 --> 17:45.160]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down
[17:45.160 --> 17:46.160]  the road.
[17:46.160 --> 17:50.240]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the
[17:50.240 --> 17:55.560]  COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[17:55.560 --> 17:57.880]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:57.880 --> 18:01.520]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[18:01.520 --> 18:05.680]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra
[18:05.680 --> 18:09.800]  people to starve to death and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western
[18:09.800 --> 18:10.800]  world.
[18:10.800 --> 18:14.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storeable food that's
[18:14.240 --> 18:17.800]  ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.

[18:32.480 --> 18:37.600]  They won't do this sale again until November and then the food prices go up in 2022.
[18:37.600 --> 18:39.080]  This is insurance you can eat.

[18:55.840 --> 19:00.960]  So take action now while you still can.
[19:00.960 --> 19:20.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[19:20.720 --> 19:30.440]  Imagine being so confused as Michael Rappaport is now that you really thought you were a
[19:30.440 --> 19:31.440]  hero.
[19:31.440 --> 19:32.640]  You really thought you were a winner.
[19:32.640 --> 19:35.720]  You really believed all the mainstream media propaganda.
[19:35.720 --> 19:36.920]  You took your vaccine.
[19:36.920 --> 19:38.960]  You probably had a little adverse reaction.
[19:38.960 --> 19:40.040]  Maybe your arm went numb.
[19:40.040 --> 19:41.640]  Maybe you're in bed for a couple of days.
[19:41.640 --> 19:42.640]  But you know what?
[19:42.640 --> 19:47.540]  You were told you would be a hero and you stopped a pandemic that you fell for.
[19:47.540 --> 19:52.360]  And then it comes out that actually the vaccinated people are the ones getting sick.
[19:52.360 --> 19:56.360]  The vaccinated people are the ones now spreading the disease and the vaccinated people are
[19:56.360 --> 20:00.640]  the ones creating the mutations of the disease.
[20:00.640 --> 20:03.280]  And I've got stories from all across the world.
[20:03.280 --> 20:08.720]  Every country where they're hospitalizing COVID patients again, the majority of them
[20:08.720 --> 20:10.080]  are vaccinated.
[20:10.080 --> 20:14.200]  But hey, listen to CNN, listen to the Democrat Party.
[20:14.200 --> 20:16.920]  They'll tell you, you don't have freedom anymore.
[20:16.920 --> 20:18.800]  Yeah, the vaccine doesn't work.
[20:18.800 --> 20:20.200]  Yeah, the mass doesn't work.
[20:20.200 --> 20:21.200]  Doesn't matter.
[20:21.200 --> 20:25.720]  You're our slave now and we want you to die unless you take this vaccine.
[20:25.720 --> 20:30.200]  I mean, Alex, the messaging here is now so aggressive.
[20:30.200 --> 20:31.760]  It's almost unbelievable.
[20:31.760 --> 20:35.520]  It's almost unbelievable that they've become so aggressive with their messaging that they
[20:35.520 --> 20:39.480]  think it'll work to just say, yeah, you're not free anymore.
[20:39.480 --> 20:41.080]  You must take this vaccine.
[20:41.080 --> 20:42.720]  You're all slaves to big pharma.
[20:42.720 --> 20:44.600]  You're going to do exactly what we tell you.
[20:44.600 --> 20:46.720]  There's no such thing as freedom anymore.
[20:46.720 --> 20:49.000]  Freedom is now bad, according to CNN.
[20:49.000 --> 20:52.880]  And oh, and that's because we're at war.
[20:52.880 --> 20:58.200]  These are groups that have signed on and incrementally engaged in lying, engaged in censorship, engaged
[20:58.200 --> 20:59.200]  in deception.
[20:59.200 --> 21:05.280]  Remember, the last year and a half, the big five tech companies have aggressively suppressed
[21:05.280 --> 21:11.200]  tens of thousands of prominent doctors, scientists, members of Congress, presidents, you name
[21:11.200 --> 21:12.200]  it.
[21:12.200 --> 21:14.600]  And remember, 23 and me, it's now being confirmed.
[21:14.600 --> 21:17.800]  Folks are sending in dog saliva, cat saliva.
[21:17.800 --> 21:22.160]  They're sending in juice out of long grass.
[21:22.160 --> 21:24.800]  They're sending in lizard saliva.
[21:24.800 --> 21:27.040]  And 23 and me is coming back as human.
[21:27.040 --> 21:28.040]  It's all a fraud.
[21:28.040 --> 21:30.600]  23 and me is similar to a PCR test.
[21:30.600 --> 21:33.880]  The Theranos company ran their own similar system.
[21:33.880 --> 21:34.880]  It was a total fraud.
[21:34.880 --> 21:36.920]  Bill Gates was heavily involved in that.
[21:36.920 --> 21:42.080]  Now he and, of course, the guy that's always involved in everything, Abel George Soros,
[21:42.080 --> 21:46.640]  are buying up all the major companies that are doing testing that are suddenly now authorized.
[21:46.640 --> 21:49.800]  And it's just PCR by another name.
[21:49.800 --> 21:55.240]  And then we have the blood test being done by top scientists around the world, the D-dyres.
[21:55.240 --> 21:56.240]  It's an old-fashioned test.
[21:56.240 --> 21:57.240]  Works great.
[21:57.240 --> 22:02.360]  And almost everyone that takes the vaccines that are really, again, deadly poison now have
[22:02.360 --> 22:07.800]  D-dyre, highly positive, meaning blood clots all over the body, and here's the bad news.
[22:07.800 --> 22:09.160]  Those are prion crystal folks.
[22:09.160 --> 22:11.160]  They're now growing in you.
[22:11.160 --> 22:12.160]  And it's funny.
[22:12.160 --> 22:15.160]  I've been talking to a lot of doctors of scientists of my own research, and this stuff is definitely
[22:15.160 --> 22:16.160]  shedding.
[22:16.160 --> 22:17.160]  It's definitely getting people.
[22:17.160 --> 22:20.080]  I'm going to reflect that down at the bottom of the next hour.
[22:20.080 --> 22:25.040]  But definitely, this is what women already noticed eight months ago when it started,
[22:25.040 --> 22:31.040]  or a year ago when it started in the UK, or I guess 10 months ago, was that a lady's
[22:31.040 --> 22:35.480]  daughter would get it, and then the mother would get sick, or a lady's husband would
[22:35.480 --> 22:38.480]  get it, and then she would get sick, and now you see this everywhere.
[22:38.480 --> 22:39.480]  Now they confirm.
[22:39.480 --> 22:40.480]  Oh, yeah.
[22:40.480 --> 22:45.600]  It's shedding new mutant viruses that are actually real onto you, turning the humans
[22:45.600 --> 22:51.040]  into these factories of death and assaulting us, and then you look at Michael Rappaport
[22:51.040 --> 22:56.520]  who's viciously attacked me, viciously attacked anybody that questions these so-called vaccines,
[22:56.520 --> 22:58.280]  and now I've seen his clips all the time.
[22:58.280 --> 23:01.160]  He looks 20 years older.
[23:01.160 --> 23:03.400]  He's got a big sore on his mouth.
[23:03.400 --> 23:04.400]  He looks like he's dying.
[23:04.400 --> 23:05.400]  He looks like Eric Clapton.
[23:05.400 --> 23:09.680]  Eric Clapton looked 20 years older after he got the shot and almost killed him.
[23:09.680 --> 23:12.880]  He says it's definitely a bio weapon.
[23:12.880 --> 23:18.320]  He'd at least still come out now and try to warn people, but do the right thing.
[23:18.320 --> 23:19.320]  So that's where we're at.
[23:19.320 --> 23:23.360]  So here's John Rappaport literally finally being genuine for the first time.
[23:23.360 --> 23:26.480]  He's actually listenable, saying, hey, I'm supposed to be the hero here.
[23:26.480 --> 23:27.480]  Screw you.
[23:27.480 --> 23:28.480]  Get this straight.
[23:28.480 --> 23:31.760]  See, he believes the social contract is still in place.
[23:31.760 --> 23:33.680]  He believes that the system actually wants to help you.
[23:33.680 --> 23:37.600]  He doesn't know it's ruthless mega corporations that don't just want money.
[23:37.600 --> 23:41.640]  They want to set the pressure to depopulate us, and you've got to finally do it.
[23:41.640 --> 23:44.000]  When you launch a war, you've got to finally launch it.
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  Folks, they're out of beta.
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.000]  They're operational.
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.440]  Klaus Schwab is dead.
[23:48.440 --> 23:51.040]  It is never going back to normal.
[23:51.040 --> 23:52.040]  We are depopulating.
[23:52.040 --> 23:53.520]  It is for us.
[23:53.520 --> 23:54.920]  They're on record.
[23:54.920 --> 23:57.000]  They're telling you, I'm sorry I'm right.
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.000]  I don't want to be right.
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.720]  But unless we have a full away getting to the assault, it's over.
[24:01.720 --> 24:06.920]  Now we're just going to normalize that, okay, it's like I said a year ago, oh, a new variance.
[24:06.920 --> 24:07.920]  It's what's killing everyone.
[24:07.920 --> 24:10.680]  Oh, you won't take the shot to the new variant.
[24:10.680 --> 24:14.280]  And then they think we're too dumb to notice that everybody dying in the hospital is people
[24:14.280 --> 24:15.280]  that had the shots.
[24:15.280 --> 24:20.560]  And then Fauci runs around lying saying 99% of those dying haven't had the vaccine.
[24:20.560 --> 24:25.360]  That's because they used the data from the beginning of February 2020 to the beginning
[24:25.360 --> 24:29.560]  of February 2021 with only one month of US vaccinated.
[24:29.560 --> 24:33.720]  And then they didn't ask vaccinated and didn't test vaccinated when they died for COVID.
[24:33.720 --> 24:35.360]  So it's on record.
[24:35.360 --> 24:38.160]  It's come out in Congress that that's a fraud number, folks.
[24:38.160 --> 24:39.760]  Again, lying to you.
[24:39.760 --> 24:45.280]  The PCR test, total fraud by design saying 99% dying have never shot, total lie.
[24:45.280 --> 24:49.280]  But now because they're still regular medical doctors and still regular scientists, they're
[24:49.280 --> 24:51.600]  doing tests at hospitals that are real.
[24:51.600 --> 24:56.440]  They're saying, no, most of the people dying had the vaccine, but they're going, oh, it's
[24:56.440 --> 24:58.400]  the Delta, the Delta variant.
[24:58.400 --> 25:01.640]  No ladies and gentlemen, it's a spike protein.
[25:01.640 --> 25:02.960]  That's the Delta variant.
[25:02.960 --> 25:05.440]  They're calling the crystals the Delta variant.
[25:05.440 --> 25:07.880]  They're calling the prions the Delta variant.
[25:07.880 --> 25:11.920]  We told you it's all we do is research May day, May day.
[25:11.920 --> 25:14.600]  Do we have time to play the wrap before Clever Rock gone too long here?
[25:14.600 --> 25:16.320]  No, you have time, Alex.
[25:16.320 --> 25:17.320]  Go ahead and play wrap before.
[25:17.320 --> 25:21.800]  Here he is.
[25:21.800 --> 25:37.720]  I just watched Tony Fauci and CNN and Fox tell me that people with the vaccine, they
[25:37.720 --> 25:52.040]  vaccinated people are now spreading the Corona virus a couple of weeks ago, a couple of days
[25:52.040 --> 25:53.040]  ago.
[25:53.040 --> 25:54.040]  I was, yes, I'm vaccinated.
[25:54.040 --> 25:55.040]  Yeah.
[25:55.040 --> 25:56.040]  You little sticker.
[25:56.040 --> 25:57.040]  Yay.
[25:57.040 --> 25:58.040]  I'm vaccinated.
[25:58.040 --> 25:59.040]  Be a hero.
[25:59.040 --> 26:01.160]  Be vaccinated.
[26:01.160 --> 26:04.240]  I went from being a hero because I'm vaccinated.
[26:04.240 --> 26:20.440]  And now you mother calling me a super spreader, ain't no super spreader figure this out.
[26:20.440 --> 26:21.440]  So there you go.
[26:21.440 --> 26:26.320]  Oh, hey, Mr. Rappaport, they did figure it out called operational lockstep.
[26:26.320 --> 26:28.080]  It's called Crimson Contagion.
[26:28.080 --> 26:31.640]  It's a plan for world government and the control collapse of civilization, the post
[26:31.640 --> 26:35.840]  industrial world, and you and your families at death, Mr. Rappaport.
[26:35.840 --> 26:36.840]  I love you, Mr. Rappaport.
[26:36.840 --> 26:38.080]  I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
[26:38.080 --> 26:39.080]  We can wake you up.
[26:39.080 --> 26:40.200]  We can save the world.
[26:40.200 --> 26:42.760]  He is patient zero for people under mind control.
[26:42.760 --> 26:45.600]  Oh, and I want to reach out to Mr. Rappaport.
[26:45.600 --> 26:48.040]  I will give Mr. Rappaport and I always got a lot of money.
[26:48.040 --> 26:52.920]  I'll give him $100,000 to the to the charity of his choice and I'll fly in first class
[26:52.920 --> 26:53.920]  to Austin, Texas.
[26:53.920 --> 26:58.880]  He'll come spend a day with me and let him show him documents and let me and have him
[26:58.880 --> 26:59.880]  come on there.
[26:59.880 --> 27:03.440]  He said, I think if we could wake him up, because I don't think he's a bad guy.
[27:03.440 --> 27:07.040]  I think he really believes the BS of the system is good and that's why he hates me.
[27:07.040 --> 27:10.200]  He thinks I'm a monster and I get why he thinks I'm a monster because I'm telling you what
[27:10.200 --> 27:14.040]  monsters are doing and I don't like what they're doing, but I've got to tell people the truth
[27:14.040 --> 27:15.040]  so we can beat him.
[27:15.040 --> 27:16.040]  Do you understand that, Mr. Rappaport?
[27:16.040 --> 27:21.040]  So I'll give him $100,000, just charity of a choice, by him first class to Austin,
[27:21.040 --> 27:22.040]  Texas.
[27:22.040 --> 27:25.760]  Or I'll go see if that's in New York or Boston or wherever he lives.
[27:25.760 --> 27:27.080]  I will bring him the information.
[27:27.080 --> 27:28.280]  I'll bring him medical doctors.
[27:28.280 --> 27:31.440]  I will send him down, I want $5 to Rappaport.
[27:31.440 --> 27:35.480]  And then I want to ask you, will you please try to save people or has Rappaport taken money
[27:35.480 --> 27:36.480]  to take the vaccine?
[27:36.480 --> 27:37.480]  I'm not saying he's done that.
[27:37.480 --> 27:40.120]  They've reached out to hundreds of thousands of paid-off influencers to do it.
[27:40.120 --> 27:43.680]  They paid out billions of dollars to influencers, so I'm just saying, do you have a soul, Mr.
[27:43.680 --> 27:44.680]  Rappaport?
[27:44.680 --> 27:45.680]  Owen, what do you think about that?
[27:45.680 --> 27:51.000]  Well, like he said, if you can have a sea change from even the most brainwash of the
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.200]  brainwashed, then maybe there is hope for us to save this country.
[27:57.200 --> 28:00.120]  The biosecurity state is here.
[28:00.120 --> 28:06.000]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.160]  The corrupt, puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship
[28:11.160 --> 28:16.920]  of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines
[28:16.920 --> 28:22.560]  for every person in the country all the way out to 2024, and that in 2024, you will again
[28:22.560 --> 28:23.560]  take two shots.
[28:23.560 --> 28:28.480]  And he says it will be whatever Pfizer cooks out and wants to put in your body.
[28:28.480 --> 28:30.200]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[28:30.200 --> 28:32.440]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[28:32.440 --> 28:36.720]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private
[28:36.720 --> 28:37.720]  Rockefeller Foundation.
[28:37.720 --> 28:42.440]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf, Alois
[28:42.440 --> 28:46.520]  Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Institute
[28:46.520 --> 28:47.520]  in Germany.
[28:47.520 --> 28:51.400]  And Volwars will continue to set fast, say, fight this, I don't know how long we can.
[28:51.400 --> 28:54.240]  The enemy's coming for us all now, God bless, and good luck.
[28:54.240 --> 28:58.400]  I would again get right with God right now.
[28:58.400 --> 29:02.200]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[29:02.200 --> 29:03.680]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[29:03.680 --> 29:04.680]  Good, bro.
[29:04.680 --> 29:05.680]  Great last caller.
[29:05.680 --> 29:07.960]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[29:07.960 --> 29:13.160]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore, with all the gaslighting, moralization, and
[29:13.160 --> 29:14.160]  absurdity.
[29:14.160 --> 29:16.120]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, and...
[29:16.120 --> 29:18.760]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire, Eric, thanks for calling.
[29:18.760 --> 29:19.760]  Go ahead.
[29:19.760 --> 29:20.760]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[29:20.760 --> 29:23.760]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the owner of the product.
[29:23.760 --> 29:25.400]  The X2 does wonders.
[29:25.400 --> 29:26.400]  They recommend it to everybody.
[29:26.400 --> 29:27.800]  You're on the fence about it.
[29:27.800 --> 29:28.800]  Get off the fence.
[29:28.800 --> 29:29.800]  Get the product.
[29:29.800 --> 29:30.800]  Support the Imp Award.
[29:30.800 --> 29:32.640]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year.
[29:32.640 --> 29:33.640]  Thanks for rolling.
[29:33.640 --> 29:34.640]  Go ahead.
[29:34.640 --> 29:35.640]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[29:35.640 --> 29:36.640]  It's an honor.
[29:36.640 --> 29:37.640]  Honored to talk to you.
[29:37.640 --> 29:38.640]  Awesome.
[29:38.640 --> 29:43.600]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say, I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[29:43.600 --> 29:48.440]  If you ask my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one
[29:48.440 --> 29:49.440]  for a few of you.
[29:49.440 --> 29:51.760]  It only works, it's not a joke, yeah.
[29:51.760 --> 29:52.760]  Absolutely.
[29:52.760 --> 30:01.120]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[30:01.120 --> 30:05.320]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[30:05.320 --> 30:06.320]  pass.
[30:06.320 --> 30:09.520]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[30:09.520 --> 30:13.720]  a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being cold, being
[30:13.720 --> 30:14.720]  totally enslaved.
[30:14.720 --> 30:18.520]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[30:18.520 --> 30:19.520]  that move.
[30:19.520 --> 30:23.480]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[30:23.480 --> 30:29.200]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[30:29.200 --> 30:34.120]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[30:34.120 --> 30:39.760]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[30:39.760 --> 30:44.360]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[30:44.360 --> 30:50.400]  year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute, or they wouldn't
[30:50.400 --> 30:53.320]  get more IMF and World Bank money.
[30:53.320 --> 30:59.840]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist.
[30:59.840 --> 31:13.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:13.200 --> 31:19.320]  You know, I've got to say, perhaps the most incredible part of all of this, and I'm not
[31:19.320 --> 31:24.120]  even sure how to properly lay this out, because I was thinking about it all night.
[31:24.120 --> 31:30.320]  Folks, you have to understand, when they run their January 6th hearing the other day, they
[31:30.320 --> 31:32.800]  know everything they're saying is a lie.
[31:32.800 --> 31:33.800]  They know it.
[31:33.800 --> 31:34.800]  They don't believe what they're saying.
[31:34.800 --> 31:36.360]  They know it's all a lie.
[31:36.360 --> 31:39.400]  When they run their fake pandemic, they all know it's a lie.
[31:39.400 --> 31:41.160]  That's part of the propaganda.
[31:41.160 --> 31:46.280]  That's part of the psychological warfare, is to gaslight you, tell you two plus two
[31:46.280 --> 31:50.520]  equals five, and then have you so confused that you don't even know what you're dealing
[31:50.520 --> 31:51.520]  with.
[31:51.520 --> 31:53.200]  You're like, how am I dealing with such liars?
[31:53.200 --> 31:58.080]  And then you fight back against those lies, not even realizing that the lie is the propaganda.
[31:58.080 --> 31:59.760]  They know they're lying about it.
[31:59.760 --> 32:02.080]  They always knew they were lying about it.
[32:02.080 --> 32:06.920]  That's part of the psychological warfare that we are enduring here.
[32:06.920 --> 32:14.000]  And I just can't even believe, I guess people are finally waking up to it, but I can't even
[32:14.000 --> 32:18.560]  believe that we're still dealing with a nation of people where millions of Americans are
[32:18.560 --> 32:22.640]  still falling for the lies that they tell every day, and they're laughing behind the
[32:22.640 --> 32:29.400]  scenes after all the big lies they tell, thinking, ha, we've tricked the American people again.
[32:29.400 --> 32:34.160]  Oh, and what you just said is everything.
[32:34.160 --> 32:35.920]  People say, why do they change their tune every day?
[32:35.920 --> 32:37.840]  Why are they destroying confidence?
[32:37.840 --> 32:38.840]  Why are they lying?
[32:38.840 --> 32:41.400]  Why are they not wearing masks and saying we have to?
[32:41.400 --> 32:45.560]  Why are they saying now people that are vaccinated are super spreaders, which is actually true?
[32:45.560 --> 32:50.560]  Because it was always planned that they want to destroy confidence in the regular local
[32:50.560 --> 32:55.320]  economies so we close our businesses and never reopen, and then they have all the fiat currency
[32:55.320 --> 33:00.440]  and can take over everything and then dictate to us how to live our lives.
[33:00.440 --> 33:06.480]  They keep third world countries, the IMF, the World Bank, do it to their own documents or
[33:06.480 --> 33:09.280]  on purpose to control the people and dumb them down.
[33:09.280 --> 33:13.600]  And that is the process now happening in America for the last 60 years, and it's in the Carnegie
[33:13.600 --> 33:17.800]  Endowment, the Ford Endowment, the Rockefeller Endowment, they all admit they had to take
[33:17.800 --> 33:22.120]  us from the most knowledgeable, the most literate, the most incredible people in the world who
[33:22.120 --> 33:23.120]  were self-educated.
[33:23.120 --> 33:27.240]  Kind of read a newspaper from 200 years ago, I can't even read it, from 100 years ago,
[33:27.240 --> 33:28.240]  it's amazingly written.
[33:28.240 --> 33:31.040]  You read it today, it's like a five-year-old wrote it.
[33:31.040 --> 33:37.080]  They have put in garbage into the computer to dumb us down, we know that.
[33:37.080 --> 33:41.560]  And then now they're in the final process of flooding us with deadly prescription drugs
[33:41.560 --> 33:47.440]  and illegal drugs and alcohol and deadly culture and pedophilia, and they are just bombing
[33:47.440 --> 33:51.280]  the culture with this, but we have to say, wait a minute, what's the antidote?
[33:51.280 --> 33:55.320]  It's loving God, it's being strong, it's not caring what they say about us, it's about
[33:55.320 --> 34:01.200]  educating others, and it's about every place you can, supporting local businesses, supporting
[34:01.200 --> 34:05.880]  independent media, supporting real local churches, okay, they're in the real local church, you're
[34:05.880 --> 34:09.960]  a businessman, you're a businesswoman, you've got the Holy Spirit, you've been reading the
[34:09.960 --> 34:12.560]  Bible your whole life, you know this is satanic.
[34:12.560 --> 34:16.000]  Go rent a local warehouse, put a sign on it and say it's the people's church, and get
[34:16.000 --> 34:17.720]  up there and start leading.
[34:17.720 --> 34:21.800]  Just because they've taken over 95% of the churches and all they care about is 501c3
[34:21.800 --> 34:23.400]  and money, that doesn't matter.
[34:23.400 --> 34:27.360]  I mean, look, everybody knows I'm a preacher, and I didn't go to a seminary, and I don't
[34:27.360 --> 34:30.760]  play to be all holy, and I don't play to have all the answers, and if you go back to the
[34:30.760 --> 34:37.920]  Bible, most of God's real prophets were like killers and people and bad-asses and really
[34:37.920 --> 34:38.920]  tough people.
[34:38.920 --> 34:42.640]  I mean, Moses like killed people, I mean, look at the other people, like John the Baptist,
[34:42.640 --> 34:49.040]  I mean, he was meaner than hell, he certainly was using a lot of cuss words, I'm just saying,
[34:49.040 --> 34:52.360]  when things get bad, it's not going to be these candy-ass preachers, they're going to
[34:52.360 --> 34:53.680]  save us, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:53.680 --> 34:57.780]  We got to get up there and say, this is Satan taking over, and if people don't get the Holy
[34:57.780 --> 35:00.600]  Spirit in them and start saying, no to this, we're going to lose this thing, and look,
[35:00.600 --> 35:03.000]  we're going to go through the process, they're going to bring in world government, they're
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.080]  going to tell us we can't buy and sell, they're going to put us in camps.
[35:06.080 --> 35:09.400]  It's our job now, it'll probably take them five years to get to that in my estimation.
[35:09.400 --> 35:13.280]  Maybe we'll get a reprieve like none of that, it's 50 years or 100 years, because the Bible
[35:13.280 --> 35:17.360]  is a mirror of everything that happens over and over again, and it's a blueprint of how
[35:17.360 --> 35:20.760]  to understand this, and I'm not trying to scare people.
[35:20.760 --> 35:22.640]  According to this, we'll get you killed the quickest.
[35:22.640 --> 35:25.840]  They're showing you that, taking their shots, they will then target you, because they know
[35:25.840 --> 35:28.600]  that you're under their thumb and you've taken their mark.
[35:28.600 --> 35:34.040]  You literally lose God's protection when you submit to them, and so understand, those of
[35:34.040 --> 35:38.880]  us that actually resist them, we'll end up having our own communities in our own areas,
[35:38.880 --> 35:42.120]  and then the enemy is going to march on us with the military at a certain point and kill
[35:42.120 --> 35:46.040]  us, but that's what's going to happen, but that example is going to cause the biggest
[35:46.040 --> 35:51.040]  revival the world's ever seen, and the antichrist is going to kill one-fourth of the planet,
[35:51.040 --> 35:55.960]  and he's not going to be loved anymore, folks, and then China is going to end up, and there's
[35:55.960 --> 35:58.440]  going to be a giant war, and there's going to be a nuclear war, folks.
[35:58.440 --> 36:02.840]  Okay, this is fake, this is real, okay, and I'm just saying you've got to get ready.
[36:02.840 --> 36:08.200]  Your candy-ass churches, don't even know that, they want you to go in there, it's like a
[36:08.200 --> 36:12.160]  rock concert, we all feel good, and we're the good guys, everything's fine, and oh, show
[36:12.160 --> 36:16.600]  your COVID pass to get in the church, those aren't churches, those are devil dents, and
[36:16.600 --> 36:20.080]  again, I'm not up here on some high horse telling you that I'm perfect, and I've got
[36:20.080 --> 36:22.840]  everything, and you better do what I say, I'm just telling you better, you're right
[36:22.840 --> 36:28.200]  with God, and you better understand this is a satanic, one-world government takeover.
[36:28.200 --> 36:34.080]  Now, just during the break, one of the producers, Matt, said, are you serious about John Rappaport
[36:34.080 --> 36:38.560]  and paying him $100,000 to come to town, and I'm 1 trillion percent serious, I don't have
[36:38.560 --> 36:42.040]  a bunch of extra money, I'm selling my house to get money around the operation, but $100,000
[36:42.040 --> 36:47.600]  like that, if he did it, would become a huge internet story, and would save millions of
[36:47.600 --> 36:53.320]  people just for folks to see somebody like him wake up, and to have him come and be on
[36:53.320 --> 36:58.120]  air, and have a show him the facts, and explain to him, and if we could get somebody like
[36:58.120 --> 37:03.040]  that, it's not $100,000, that's going to charity just for him to come, if you can get somebody
[37:03.040 --> 37:08.280]  like that on air to finally have the blinders come off, it can cause a chain reaction, so
[37:08.280 --> 37:13.880]  that $100,000 would be worth $50 million in advertising to the world and everybody else,
[37:13.880 --> 37:18.280]  and that's just one small example, if I had more money, money talks, BS walks, I could
[37:18.280 --> 37:24.440]  do all sorts of stuff like that on a daily basis, we've got so many great submissions
[37:24.440 --> 37:29.560]  on the COVID-19 vaccine murdering logic contest that when I get back in a few days, I'm going
[37:29.560 --> 37:32.920]  to review them all again, we will announce the winner on Monday, we just got so many
[37:32.920 --> 37:39.000]  great things that came in, and I also want to be able to play those on air, and just
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.240]  give credit to all the activists out there, but that's an example of $10,000, then helping
[37:43.240 --> 37:50.120]  produce all of these great pieces that show the logic of them saying, you took the vaccine,
[37:50.120 --> 37:53.360]  but everybody else has to take it, or they'll make you sick because the vaccine doesn't
[37:53.360 --> 37:56.840]  work, but still you've got to take the vaccine, so that's just another example of all of
[37:56.840 --> 38:01.240]  us resisting, all of us taking action, that's why listeners, now more importantly than
[38:01.240 --> 38:04.400]  ever, they want to cut off everybody's money, they want to cut your food off if you don't
[38:04.400 --> 38:08.400]  submit to them, that's why I've told you, in the future, you need to have high-quality
[38:08.400 --> 38:14.240]  storeable food, and we have 10% off right now, the percentage we get is not that big,
[38:14.240 --> 38:17.760]  because there's not much profit in it, because they sell at such a low price, we sell a ton
[38:17.760 --> 38:22.800]  of food to fund our operation, that's okay, because people need high-quality storeable
[38:22.800 --> 38:27.840]  food, so they're not dependent on the system, that's just one of the checkboxes that you've
[38:27.840 --> 38:31.840]  got to check off, that's just one of the things you've got to do to make sure that you're
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.160]  self-sufficient and ready in that mindset into the future, so it's a win-win, only a
[38:36.160 --> 38:41.000]  few days left, we send it one week, it will be over Sunday, 10% off in FullmoreStore.com,
[38:41.000 --> 38:49.040]  2020 prices now, but also, they have their Made in America sheets and pillows and towels
[38:49.040 --> 38:53.520]  and all that stuff for people that want them, they also have their Giza African cotton that's

[38:58.560 --> 39:02.520]  that, they've got great products at very low prices, they've now cut out the middlemen
[39:02.520 --> 39:06.000]  of the big stores that kick Michael and Del out, that's fine, he's passed those savings
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.040]  on to you, and thank you for going and shopping at MyPillow.com using Promo Code Alex to get
[39:11.040 --> 39:16.280]  the biggest specials that are out there up to 66% off, because that has allowed us to
[39:16.280 --> 39:21.640]  launch several covert projects that you see on the news and that are having a big effect,
[39:21.640 --> 39:25.640]  but because of how we've been attacked, and we have our public operations, and we have
[39:25.640 --> 39:29.080]  our stealth operations, but the enemy have been trying to penetrate, but that's okay,
[39:29.080 --> 39:33.440]  they haven't done it, and so by the time they get me, we'll already have 10 other projects
[39:33.440 --> 39:37.980]  going, and we've already got a lot of them launched, so again, I need as much capital
[39:37.980 --> 39:41.800]  as possible in this war, ladies and gentlemen, this is a life and death situation, I'm not
[39:41.800 --> 39:47.280]  doing this to play games, I'm not doing this to, you know, for myself, the bigger I get,
[39:47.280 --> 39:51.160]  the more the crosshairs are on me, the more I am set to be destroyed, but that's okay,
[39:51.160 --> 39:55.000]  because we're all going to be destroyed physically in this, we're all going to die, what matters
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.920]  is our spirit, guard your spirit, don't fear you can kill your body, fear you can kill
[39:59.920 --> 40:04.240]  your soul, and just do not go with the devil, ladies and gentlemen, so I want to thank all
[40:04.240 --> 40:07.400]  of them for the great job he's doing, we've got so many clips, and so much we're going
[40:07.400 --> 40:11.520]  to do at the bottom of the next hour, I'll be back with you all, and again, I just want
[40:11.520 --> 40:15.760]  to thank you all for your prayers and your action, we've all been totally vindicated,
[40:15.760 --> 40:21.080]  this is totally insane, but the big question I'll leave you with is, as I said a year ago,
[40:21.080 --> 40:24.160]  when the vaccines start killing people, when the prions start growing, when they claim
[40:24.160 --> 40:27.800]  it's a variant, everything I told you exactly has come true, then they're going to launch
[40:27.800 --> 40:32.600]  something even bigger to cover up this phase, I don't know what that's going to be, but
[40:32.600 --> 40:37.600]  it's going to be bad, and that's why I start stuttering on air because I'm just talking
[40:37.600 --> 40:42.000]  so fast because I'm so upset in my spirit, I mean, my spirit is telling me emergency,
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.160]  emergency, every day I thought it could be our last show folks, okay, I mean, I know
[40:46.160 --> 40:51.040]  you can all feel it too, we are in grave danger, we are in grave danger, they're murdering
[40:51.040 --> 40:55.080]  our countrymen, they're slaughtering the purple world, they're starving everyone to death.
[40:55.080 --> 40:58.960]  But I'll tell you who's got five star ratings when it comes to customer service, I'll tell
[40:58.960 --> 41:04.480]  you who built his network and infrastructure and has thousands of employees here in the

[41:12.640 --> 41:19.160]  here in the United States, and that is Mike Lindell, Mike Lindell is a patriot, Mike Lindell
[41:19.160 --> 41:25.880]  is fighting, he is bold, and he's got his products in stock ready to ship to you.

[41:57.560 --> 42:02.280]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[42:02.280 --> 42:10.920]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[42:10.920 --> 42:20.360]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves,
[42:20.360 --> 42:26.400]  worsted slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be
[42:26.400 --> 42:32.640]  servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[42:32.640 --> 42:37.840]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.680]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[42:42.680 --> 42:47.800]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world, and it's the only
[42:47.800 --> 42:51.280]  choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[42:51.280 --> 42:56.480]  It is a spiritual battle and Infowars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[42:56.480 --> 43:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroyer here, the host of the Infowars War Room, and I am very
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.840]  excited about our latest supplement edition to InfowarsStore.com.
[43:04.840 --> 43:09.920]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time,
[43:09.920 --> 43:15.520]  and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens, fiber caps to InfowarsStore.com.
[43:15.520 --> 43:18.600]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[43:18.600 --> 43:24.040]  Listen to this, organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic
[43:24.040 --> 43:29.880]  cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[43:29.880 --> 43:33.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[43:33.280 --> 43:37.560]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health, and we've packed
[43:37.560 --> 43:41.800]  it all in to fibergreencaps at InfowarsStore.com.
[43:41.800 --> 43:45.560]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.

[45:15.640 --> 45:23.120]  we're back here on the Alex Jones show.
[45:23.120 --> 45:29.960]  I'm going to get into this stack of news now, and we've got all kinds of video clips
[45:29.960 --> 45:38.480]  coming up as well.
[45:38.480 --> 45:41.000]  Some stunning developments, well, I guess not so stunning.
[45:41.000 --> 45:48.760]  When you realize that, wow, a lot of these mainline leftist liberals that promote the
[45:48.760 --> 45:53.840]  LGBTQ plus movement and, you know, they like to dye their hair and everything and wear
[45:53.840 --> 45:59.560]  the BLM shirts, yet another one turns out to be a pedophile, yes, but we'll have that
[45:59.560 --> 46:01.680]  coming up later.
[46:01.680 --> 46:05.800]  Let me just pile drive through this stack of news here with all the latest updates
[46:05.800 --> 46:11.400]  when it comes to COVID and the vaccines and where this tyranny is heading now.
[46:11.400 --> 46:13.640]  And again, I could do this all day long.
[46:13.640 --> 46:14.720]  We've been doing it all week.
[46:14.720 --> 46:17.720]  I'm sure this trend is not going to stop.
[46:17.720 --> 46:22.960]  This is from the Washington Post covering coronavirus outbreak in Singapore.
[46:22.960 --> 46:27.400]  The Singapore Ministry of Health recently found that three-fourths of coronavirus cases
[46:27.400 --> 46:34.360]  in the past four weeks were people who were fully or partially vaccinated.
[46:34.360 --> 46:38.200]  And there you go.
[46:38.200 --> 46:41.920]  But remember, Fauci said, if you get vaccinated, you're not going to get COVID, you're going
[46:41.920 --> 46:42.920]  to be fine.
[46:42.920 --> 46:45.080]  Joe Biden says the vaccines are 100% effective.
[46:45.080 --> 46:46.960]  You're not going to get COVID if you get them.
[46:46.960 --> 46:51.120]  They lied because that's what liars do.
[46:51.120 --> 46:56.080]  And then some journalists are confused about what's going on in Sweden.
[46:56.080 --> 47:01.880]  Like Josh Stimley, how is Sweden going on two weeks of zero COVID deaths despite and
[47:01.880 --> 47:08.040]  only 37% vaccination rate and the lowest mass compliance on the continent?
[47:08.040 --> 47:12.000]  While the US is now discouraging travel to Israel because of COVID when they had one
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.040]  of the strictest vaccination policies in the world.
[47:16.040 --> 47:21.000]  Because the mask spreads disease, weakens your immune system, and because the vaccine
[47:21.000 --> 47:23.640]  spreads disease and weakens your immune system.
[47:23.640 --> 47:30.520]  It's by design, it's a biological weapon, you're getting hit with right now.
[47:30.520 --> 47:36.240]  So it's really not a mystery, but I suppose for those who don't want to live in reality,
[47:36.240 --> 47:37.240]  it is a mystery.
[47:37.240 --> 47:39.760]  No, that's the case.
[47:39.760 --> 47:45.160]  The vaccine and the masks are essentially working as bio weapons.
[47:45.160 --> 47:50.400]  That's why places that wear masks and take the vaccines have the biggest outbreaks.
[47:50.400 --> 47:56.000]  In Texas, they now want to put kids on ventilators that test positive for COVID because you see
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.240]  that age group right now is having no COVID problems at all.
[48:01.240 --> 48:08.120]  They have never had COVID problems, so demonic individuals know that they have to get those
[48:08.120 --> 48:15.280]  numbers up of COVID deaths in the youth so that then they can justify forced vaccinations
[48:15.280 --> 48:19.500]  on the youth as well where there has been a major standoff.
[48:19.500 --> 48:23.320]  So you figure, put the kids on the ventilators, blow their lungs out, murder them.
[48:23.320 --> 48:30.360]  Now you'll have some COVID deaths in the kids, just like they did last year with the elderly.
[48:30.360 --> 48:36.560]  And in Europe, they have just released autopsy results of people who died from the COVID
[48:36.560 --> 48:42.600]  vaccine and they found every organ of the body infested with spike proteins.
[48:42.600 --> 48:47.440]  Once again, that's what it's designed to do.
[48:47.440 --> 48:53.800]  The VAERS website is currently offline as the numbers of vaccine-related deaths are
[48:53.800 --> 48:55.680]  skyrocketing.
[48:55.680 --> 48:57.960]  It's off the charts.
[48:57.960 --> 49:01.280]  I mean, boy, oh boy, you wish the stock market looked like this if you were in that.
[49:01.280 --> 49:05.680]  But no, no, this is the vaccine death chart.
[49:05.680 --> 49:11.520]  And again, I went out on the streets of Austin with this exact chart, what was that, maybe
[49:11.520 --> 49:13.760]  two weekends ago.
[49:13.760 --> 49:20.520]  And the number was just at 10,000 then, now it's encroaching 12,000.
[49:20.520 --> 49:28.000]  And the website is so overwhelmed with people filing their adverse reactions and the deaths
[49:28.000 --> 49:34.560]  from the vaccines that now the website is offline as of this morning.
[49:34.560 --> 49:38.560]  Now I will say this before I get into the rest of this news here.
[49:38.560 --> 49:45.000]  According to the Google COVID-19 vaccine numbers, and I'm not saying you have to believe this,
[49:45.000 --> 49:53.360]  but I'm sure it's somewhat accurate, they claim that 49% of the US population has been
[49:53.360 --> 49:57.320]  fully vaccinated, 49%.
[49:57.320 --> 50:03.560]  Now think about that for a second.
[50:03.560 --> 50:08.600]  Considering all the propaganda that we've seen around the clock, the fear mongering from
[50:08.600 --> 50:16.160]  COVID, all of the punishments that they'll have for you if you don't get the vaccine
[50:16.160 --> 50:19.800]  and trying to withhold freedom from you if you don't get the vaccine, all the promotion
[50:19.800 --> 50:21.360]  of the vaccine and everything.
[50:21.360 --> 50:24.480]  And we only have 50% vaccinated.
[50:24.480 --> 50:27.520]  You know, I think that that's a very telling number.
[50:27.520 --> 50:32.280]  And maybe that should give us hope that half of America is not totally brainwashed and
[50:32.280 --> 50:39.800]  propagandized into complete delusionment and half of America knows better than to trust
[50:39.800 --> 50:43.480]  big pharma and trust our government.
[50:43.480 --> 50:50.560]  But on the flip side, you're thinking, wow, they just ran this propaganda, this psychological
[50:50.560 --> 50:56.160]  warfare and they just injected half of our country with a potentially deadly vaccine
[50:56.160 --> 50:57.840]  that's still not approved by the FDA.
[50:57.840 --> 51:03.800]  So you can look at it both ways, but I think it really shows the dichotomy and the polarization
[51:03.800 --> 51:09.840]  of everything right now and America just split in half with it.
[51:09.840 --> 51:14.360]  But hey, half of the country didn't buy the propaganda.
[51:14.360 --> 51:17.560]  Half of the country didn't fall for the BS.
[51:17.560 --> 51:22.280]  Half of the country is still thinking for themselves.
[51:22.280 --> 51:24.960]  And so maybe that's a good sign.
[51:24.960 --> 51:28.480]  And when you have people like Michael Rappaport coming out and saying, hey, I thought I was
[51:28.480 --> 51:29.480]  good for getting the vaccine.
[51:29.480 --> 51:31.800]  Now I'm a super spreader.
[51:31.800 --> 51:36.800]  Maybe this can be a big moment of awakening problem is you can't take the vaccine out
[51:36.800 --> 51:38.600]  of you once it gets in.
[51:38.600 --> 51:39.600]  That's the big crime.
[51:39.600 --> 51:43.440]  Google and Facebook announced mandatory vaccines for employees.
[51:43.440 --> 51:44.680]  That's against the Nuremberg code.
[51:44.680 --> 51:51.720]  They should all be sued and arrested and tried.
[51:51.720 --> 51:56.440]  Just like Biden saying the federal government employees need to get vaccinated just like
[51:56.440 --> 52:00.200]  the state of California saying that the state employees need to get vaccinated.
[52:00.200 --> 52:04.080]  It's all in violation of the Nuremberg code.
[52:04.080 --> 52:09.400]  And every person mandating this experimental vaccine needs to be tried in court.
[52:09.400 --> 52:13.600]  And if found guilty of violation of the Nuremberg code, the punishment is death.
[52:13.600 --> 52:18.920]  So I don't know if we still believe that or not, but that is the case.
[52:18.920 --> 52:22.600]  And how convenient is this?
[52:22.600 --> 52:27.360]  So again, they wanted to have at least 80% of the population vaccinated by now.
[52:27.360 --> 52:29.200]  They're not getting anywhere near those numbers.
[52:29.200 --> 52:31.120]  This is frustrating for them.
[52:31.120 --> 52:37.200]  Big pharma that is, and it's Stooges FDA extends shelf life of Johnson and Johnson vaccine
[52:37.200 --> 52:43.160]  to six months after states remain flooded with millions of nearly expired doses.
[52:43.160 --> 52:48.360]  How illegal is that?
[52:48.360 --> 52:54.200]  So it's already a crime to force somebody to take this experimental vaccine.
[52:54.200 --> 52:59.360]  But now they just say, actually, we're just going to extend the expiration date.
[52:59.360 --> 53:00.360]  Really?
[53:00.360 --> 53:01.360]  Huh.
[53:01.360 --> 53:06.520]  So again, it shows you they're not getting the vaccine rate that they want, but they
[53:06.520 --> 53:12.600]  just say, so as the vaccines are about to expire, they just say, hey, you know what?
[53:12.600 --> 53:13.600]  Nope.
[53:13.600 --> 53:17.720]  We're just going to extend the expiration date now.
[53:17.720 --> 53:21.440]  Not for any scientific reason or health reason or anything like that, but because they haven't
[53:21.440 --> 53:22.440]  gotten rid of them yet.
[53:22.440 --> 53:23.960]  So they're just going to say, yeah, we're extending them.
[53:23.960 --> 53:30.600]  I mean, can you imagine if a grocery store had a bunch of cartons of milk that we're
[53:30.600 --> 53:31.680]  about to expire?
[53:31.680 --> 53:35.000]  And they just said, well, we're just going to extend that expiration and they just took
[53:35.000 --> 53:41.880]  a little Sharpie and wrote through the expiration date and then said, actually, this milk expires
[53:41.880 --> 53:44.480]  next next month.
[53:44.480 --> 53:47.880]  And then they sold a bunch of milk to people and a bunch of people got sick and it was,
[53:47.880 --> 53:50.600]  you know, it was curdled or whatever.
[53:50.600 --> 53:52.480]  Well, that would be a crime.
[53:52.480 --> 53:54.400]  You wouldn't be able to get away with that.
[53:54.400 --> 53:56.640]  People would be arrested for that.
[53:56.640 --> 53:59.480]  But the vaccine manufacturers, they can do whatever they want.
[53:59.480 --> 54:01.000]  So that's nice.
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.240]  That's nice.
[54:03.240 --> 54:06.200]  Representative Andy Biggs, you got to like this.
[54:06.200 --> 54:10.800]  The CDC has lost its credibility and is now just a joke.
[54:10.800 --> 54:13.560]  Well, he got that right.
[54:13.560 --> 54:18.400]  Minnesota woman and Christian missionary who took the vaccine so she could go to Christian
[54:18.400 --> 54:23.040]  missionary work has legs amputated after taking Pfizer jab.
[54:23.040 --> 54:26.040]  And the doctors told her it was a bad reaction from the vaccine.
[54:26.040 --> 54:31.240]  And now they're probably also going to have to amputate her hands.
[54:31.240 --> 54:37.320]  So that's the nice Pfizer vaccine causes her legs and arms to fall off.
[54:37.320 --> 54:39.240]  You got to like that.
[54:39.240 --> 54:40.240]  That's good.
[54:40.240 --> 54:41.240]  Good job, Pfizer.
[54:41.240 --> 54:42.800]  Way to go.
[54:42.800 --> 54:46.440]  And hey, I mean, she's lucky at least she survived it.
[54:46.440 --> 54:52.640]  Leaked documents, nations contractually obligated to defend and hold harmless Pfizer against
[54:52.640 --> 54:53.960]  any lawsuits.
[54:53.960 --> 54:57.360]  And we have the leaked documents that are featured at infowars.com, the stories from
[54:57.360 --> 54:59.960]  Kellan McBreen.
[54:59.960 --> 55:04.600]  And so again, oh, they just extend the shelf life on their expired vaccines.
[55:04.600 --> 55:06.760]  And oh, you can't sue them or take them to court.
[55:06.760 --> 55:08.600]  They have secret vaccine courts.
[55:08.600 --> 55:14.560]  And now it comes out that they are so diabolical, these vaccine manufacturers.
[55:14.560 --> 55:16.560]  And they know what they're doing is what this proves.
[55:16.560 --> 55:18.320]  They knew how deadly these vaccines were.
[55:18.320 --> 55:22.040]  And they're so diabolical that they put it in the contracts.
[55:22.040 --> 55:29.200]  They put it in the contracts that they can't be sued when there's all the negative side
[55:29.200 --> 55:32.240]  effects and the Guillain beret and the death and everything else.
[55:32.240 --> 55:34.800]  They put it in their contracts.
[55:34.800 --> 55:37.680]  That's because they knew it was coming, folks.
[55:37.680 --> 55:38.680]  It's totally illegal.
[55:38.680 --> 55:39.680]  You can't do that.
[55:39.680 --> 55:42.800]  You can't say, I'm giving you this vaccine and it may kill you, but you can't sue me
[55:42.800 --> 55:43.800]  if it does.
[55:43.800 --> 55:44.800]  No.
[55:44.800 --> 55:45.800]  Jacob in Ohio.
[55:45.800 --> 55:46.800]  Welcome.
[55:46.800 --> 55:47.800]  Go ahead.
[55:47.800 --> 55:48.800]  Hey.
[55:48.800 --> 55:49.800]  How's it going, Alex?
[55:49.800 --> 55:50.800]  Good.
[55:50.800 --> 55:51.800]  Great last caller.
[55:51.800 --> 55:52.800]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[55:52.800 --> 55:53.800]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization,
[55:53.800 --> 55:54.800]  and absurdity.
[55:54.800 --> 55:55.800]  It's like we're living at a twilight zone, man.
[55:55.800 --> 55:56.800]  All right.
[55:56.800 --> 55:57.800]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[55:57.800 --> 55:58.800]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[55:58.800 --> 55:59.800]  Go ahead.
[55:59.800 --> 56:00.800]  Hey, Alex.
[56:00.800 --> 56:01.800]  How's it going, Alex?
[56:01.800 --> 56:02.800]  How's it going, Alex?
[56:02.800 --> 56:03.800]  How's it going, Alex?
[56:03.800 --> 56:04.800]  How's it going, Alex?
[56:04.800 --> 56:05.800]  How's it going, Alex?
[56:05.800 --> 56:07.800]  Thanks, Eric.
[56:07.800 --> 56:08.800]  Thanks for calling.
[56:08.800 --> 56:09.800]  Go ahead.
[56:09.800 --> 56:10.800]  Hey, Alex.
[56:10.800 --> 56:11.800]  Thanks for taking my call.
[56:11.800 --> 56:12.800]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[56:12.800 --> 56:13.800]  The X2 does wonders.
[56:13.800 --> 56:14.800]  They recommend it to everybody.
[56:14.800 --> 56:15.800]  You're on the fence about it.
[56:15.800 --> 56:16.800]  Get off the fence.
[56:16.800 --> 56:17.800]  Get the product.
[56:17.800 --> 56:18.800]  Support the info ward.
[56:18.800 --> 56:19.800]  Tyler in Maine.
[56:19.800 --> 56:20.800]  You're on the year.
[56:20.800 --> 56:21.800]  Thanks for holding.
[56:21.800 --> 56:22.800]  Go ahead.
[56:22.800 --> 56:23.800]  Hey, Alex.
[56:23.800 --> 56:24.800]  It's great to be on with you.
[56:24.800 --> 56:25.800]  It's an honor.
[56:25.800 --> 56:26.800]  Honored to talk to you.
[56:26.800 --> 56:27.800]  Awesome.
[56:27.800 --> 56:29.800]  So, firstly, I wanted to do was to say I love the products.
[56:29.800 --> 56:31.800]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[56:31.800 --> 56:33.800]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[56:33.800 --> 56:35.800]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[56:35.800 --> 56:37.800]  So, just number one for a few years there.
[56:37.800 --> 56:38.800]  Well, it definitely works.
[56:38.800 --> 56:39.800]  It's not a joke.
[56:39.800 --> 56:40.800]  Absolutely.
[56:40.800 --> 56:53.800]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[56:53.800 --> 56:58.800]  And that its criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public.
[56:58.800 --> 57:00.800]  They do the same things over and over again.
[57:00.800 --> 57:06.800]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[57:06.800 --> 57:07.800]  Well, guess what?
[57:07.800 --> 57:15.800]  It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenicist's globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment
[57:15.800 --> 57:19.800]  of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV.
[57:19.800 --> 57:24.800]  And they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the
[57:24.800 --> 57:27.800]  telent besides the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[57:27.800 --> 57:33.800]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down
[57:33.800 --> 57:34.800]  the road.
[57:34.800 --> 57:38.800]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the
[57:38.800 --> 57:43.800]  COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[57:43.800 --> 58:10.800]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:13.800 --> 58:20.800]  You know, this image right here, I think sums it up.
[58:20.800 --> 58:27.800]  And this is just kind of a different thread of the same energy, the same frequency of
[58:27.800 --> 58:29.800]  the Michael Rappaport video.
[58:29.800 --> 58:33.800]  It was, you know, big trumpeter, big establishment hack.
[58:33.800 --> 58:38.800]  And then he comes out and realizes that he's been duped, he's been deceived by the vaccine
[58:38.800 --> 58:40.800]  pushers.
[58:40.800 --> 58:47.800]  And you have this image here of these nurses that were fired from their jobs because they
[58:47.800 --> 58:50.800]  didn't want to take the experimental deadly vaccine.
[58:50.800 --> 58:53.800]  And so here they are standing outside where they used to work with their signs.
[58:53.800 --> 58:57.800]  One says, last year's heroes, this year's unemployed.
[58:57.800 --> 59:01.800]  The other one sign says, we worked through the pandemic with no vaccine.
[59:01.800 --> 59:04.800]  Now they want to fire us.
[59:04.800 --> 59:09.800]  And so here's the lesson to be learned from this.
[59:09.800 --> 59:13.800]  And, you know, there's no mystery here.
[59:13.800 --> 59:20.800]  But any sort of oppressor or criminal or somebody who takes advantage of you will always tell
[59:20.800 --> 59:25.800]  you how much they love you and patch on the head as long as you're part of their convenience
[59:25.800 --> 59:27.800]  and a part of their agenda.
[59:27.800 --> 59:32.800]  But as soon as you're not, they throw you to the side and you ain't worth a dang.
[59:32.800 --> 59:35.800]  And so that's what sadly Michael Rappaport is learning.
[59:35.800 --> 59:38.800]  Like, hey, I shilled through the establishment.
[59:38.800 --> 59:39.800]  Hey, I went after Trump.
[59:39.800 --> 59:40.800]  Hey, I took the vaccine.
[59:40.800 --> 59:42.800]  Now you're telling me I'm the super spreader?
[59:42.800 --> 59:43.800]  Yeah, bro.
[59:43.800 --> 59:44.800]  That's the whole point.
[59:44.800 --> 59:46.800]  That's what that's what tyrants do.
[59:46.800 --> 59:49.800]  That's what abusers do.
[59:49.800 --> 59:52.800]  You've been abused, bro.
[59:52.800 --> 59:54.800]  And so it's the same story with these nurses.
[59:54.800 --> 59:57.800]  They're like, hey, we were the heroes last year.
[59:57.800 --> 59:58.800]  Remember us?
[59:58.800 --> 1:00:00.800]  Remember us, the frontline workers?
[1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:01.800]  Remember us, the nurses?
[1:00:01.800 --> 1:00:04.800]  You said we were the greatest of all time.
[1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:08.800]  Oh, but now we don't want to take a vaccine and we're worthless to you, huh?
[1:00:08.800 --> 1:00:11.800]  Yeah, that's how it works.
[1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:15.800]  This is all a diabolical agenda.
[1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:22.800]  And as soon as the establishment loses use for you, they throw you aside into the garbage heap.
[1:00:22.800 --> 1:00:24.800]  They don't care about you.
[1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:25.800]  The establishment doesn't love you.
[1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:26.800]  They hate you.
[1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:29.800]  They use you.
[1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:39.800]  So I wanted to show that because that's exactly the example right there illustrated with those two nurses or even Michael Rappaport.
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:43.800]  Yeah, the establishment pretends to love you until it's exhausted.
[1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:44.800]  It's used for you.
[1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:49.800]  Then it casts you aside to die.
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:56.800]  Here's Megan McCain responding to, you know, because again, she's a big establishment hack.
[1:00:56.800 --> 1:00:58.800]  And so again, she's confused.
[1:00:58.800 --> 1:00:59.800]  She's like, what?
[1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:00.800]  I was promoting the vaccine.
[1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:02.800]  I was telling people how good the vaccine is.
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:09.800]  Now I find out the vaccine is killing people and it's not even effective against COVID and it's actually making it worse.
[1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:11.800]  So she tweets this out.
[1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:16.800]  Vaccinated people are spreading this more than the unvaccinated now.
[1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:20.800]  Oh, but see, Megan McCain is a real true establishment hack just like her father.
[1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:21.800]  So she deleted that tweet.
[1:01:21.800 --> 1:01:23.800]  But we have the receipts, Megan.
[1:01:23.800 --> 1:01:31.800]  I mean, for one second, Megan McCain was a good person, but she wanted to erase that one second from history.
[1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:32.800]  Here's another example.
[1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:34.800]  Yeah, you think you have a free country.
[1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:37.800]  St. Louis County votes five to two to rescind mask order.
[1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:42.800]  And then a county executive rejects the vote and says the mandates today stay in place.
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:44.800]  Stories at info wars.com from a Don Salazar.
[1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:48.800]  Oh, oh, you, oh, oh, you voted to be free.
[1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:49.800]  You think you live in a democracy?
[1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:52.800]  Not so fast.
[1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:58.800]  Sure, if you vote your way into slavery, sure, if you vote for what we want you to vote for, then then you can have a democracy.
[1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:03.800]  But as soon as you vote the way we don't like you, nope, no vote for you.
[1:02:03.800 --> 1:02:07.800]  And this just shows how the mask mandates are just totally unpopular.
[1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:14.800]  And when you boil it down to just counties or cities or people that actually want to live free, they'll always vote against it.
[1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:21.800]  But then the county executive comes in or, you know, big tech comes in and sensors it or something.
[1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:23.800]  And then you're like, what? We voted against the mask mandate.
[1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:27.800]  You say, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't get a vote.
[1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:34.800]  And now Nancy Pelosi is threatening to arrest Republicans who don't wear a mask in the Capitol.
[1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:35.800]  I'm not even kidding.
[1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:39.800]  She released this bulletin today wearing a mask mandatory at all times.
[1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:42.800]  And she says you will be subject to arrest if you don't.
[1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:44.800]  Thomas Massey responds, this is insane.
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:46.800]  Might as well come into my office and arrest my entire staff.
[1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:48.800]  We are not wearing masks.
[1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:55.800]  Well, this is about to get interesting, isn't it?
[1:02:55.800 --> 1:02:58.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the Infowars War Room.
[1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:03.800]  And I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfowarsStore.com.
[1:03:03.800 --> 1:03:08.800]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:14.800]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfowarsStore.com.
[1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:17.800]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:18.800]  Listen to this.
[1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:28.800]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:32.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:35.800]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:40.800]  And we packed it all in to FiberGreenCaps at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:44.800]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:50.800]  I suggest that you do the same thing and right now it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[1:03:50.800 --> 1:04:16.800]  That's 33% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:27.800]  All right, I want to show you an example here of the absolute state of the left in this country and the Democrat in this country.
[1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:32.800]  Again, you just have to understand, they know they're lying.
[1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:33.800]  They know they're deceiving.
[1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:35.800]  They know they're evil people.
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:36.800]  These are demons.
[1:04:36.800 --> 1:04:38.800]  These are damn demons we're dealing with.
[1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:40.800]  These are liars and criminals and demons.
[1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:46.800]  Eric Swalwell is a demon. He is a damn demon.
[1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:52.800]  And so I want to use this as an example of the absolute state of the Democrat Party and their voters right now,
[1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:54.800]  just to show you how demonic they are.
[1:04:54.800 --> 1:04:56.800]  But they don't even live in reality, folks.
[1:04:56.800 --> 1:04:59.800]  So here's a statement from Eric Swalwell.
[1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:01.800]  Yeah, there's a demon right there, Nancy Pelosi.
[1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:03.800]  There's one of the top demons.
[1:05:03.800 --> 1:05:05.800]  One of the biggest demons in American history, Nancy Pelosi.
[1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:07.800]  The devil lives inside her.
[1:05:07.800 --> 1:05:12.800]  So here's a statement from Eric Swalwell.
[1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:17.800]  And whenever Eric Swalwell tells you that you have to believe something, you know it's a lie.
[1:05:17.800 --> 1:05:21.800]  This must be made clear and cemented as the ground truth.
[1:05:21.800 --> 1:05:23.800]  Okay, so right there you already know it's a total lie.
[1:05:23.800 --> 1:05:25.800]  It's total deception.
[1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:29.800]  The officer who defended hundreds of people from Ashley Babbitt and the armed mob.
[1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:30.800]  No arms.
[1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:32.800]  No, no, there was no arms mob.
[1:05:32.800 --> 1:05:33.800]  They didn't have any weapons.
[1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:34.800]  So that's a lie.
[1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:35.800]  They did an investigation.
[1:05:35.800 --> 1:05:37.800]  So Swalwell caught lying about that.
[1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:38.800]  And what hundreds of people?
[1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:42.800]  What hundreds of people were defended by the officer that killed Ashley Babbitt?
[1:05:42.800 --> 1:05:43.800]  Who?
[1:05:43.800 --> 1:05:44.800]  Who?
[1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:46.800]  What hundreds of people, Eric?
[1:05:46.800 --> 1:05:48.800]  Just can't stop lying, can you?
[1:05:48.800 --> 1:05:52.800]  The officer who defended hundreds of people from Ashley Babbitt who had no weapon
[1:05:52.800 --> 1:05:57.800]  and the armed mob who had no arms behind her is an American hero.
[1:05:57.800 --> 1:05:59.800]  Oh!
[1:05:59.800 --> 1:06:03.800]  So when police officers kill people in the United States
[1:06:03.800 --> 1:06:05.800]  and you can make a big fuss of it in the media
[1:06:05.800 --> 1:06:09.800]  and then make riots happen across the nation,
[1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:11.800]  killing even dozens of more people,
[1:06:11.800 --> 1:06:15.800]  hospitalizing thousands of police and causing billions of dollars of property damage,
[1:06:15.800 --> 1:06:16.800]  those cops are bad.
[1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:21.800]  But when the cop murders a conservative Trump supporter, then the cop is good.
[1:06:21.800 --> 1:06:22.800]  Got it.
[1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:25.800]  Glad to know where Eric Swalwell stands on the issue.
[1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:28.800]  And then he says, don't take his word for it.
[1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:29.800]  Oh, believe me, we won't.
[1:06:29.800 --> 1:06:30.800]  We know you're a liar.
[1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:33.800]  The DOJ investigated and justified his actions.
[1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:34.800]  Really?
[1:06:34.800 --> 1:06:35.800]  I didn't see those investigations.
[1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:37.800]  I'm not doubting that they happened.
[1:06:37.800 --> 1:06:38.800]  They obviously did.
[1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:39.800]  But it was a sham.
[1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:40.800]  It was a cover-up.
[1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:45.800]  Everybody knows it.
[1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:48.800]  I think we know what Eric Swalwell is into, folks.
[1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:50.800]  Let's just...
[1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:53.800]  I think we know how they got Eric Swalwell.
[1:06:53.800 --> 1:06:56.800]  And we'll just leave it at that.
[1:06:56.800 --> 1:06:58.800]  My family is grateful for his bravery.
[1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:02.800]  So again, cops are bad whenever they want the cops to be bad and whenever they can foment
[1:07:02.800 --> 1:07:07.800]  riots and hatred, but cops are good when the cops murder their political opposition.
[1:07:07.800 --> 1:07:10.800]  That's where Eric Swalwell stands on the issue.
[1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:12.800]  Good to know, Eric.
[1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:15.800]  Glad to know where you stand on the issue.
[1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:22.800]  Thank you for coming out once again proving you're an absolute demonic, bold-faced liar.
[1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:26.800]  But here's some of the responses to his statement.
[1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:33.800]  Sean Dorkin, this is a guy who goes on MSNBC and constantly lies, lies about Trump, lies
[1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:37.800]  about America, wants you dead and enslaved.
[1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:41.800]  And he responds, he says, the mob wasn't there to give hugs and kisses.
[1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:43.800]  They were there to kill.
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:46.800]  Anyone saying differently is a liar and an accomplice.
[1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:51.800]  So here's Sean Dorkin, who goes on MSNBC, another demon-possessed devil.
[1:07:51.800 --> 1:07:59.800]  And, but I would ask Scott this, Scott Dorkin, if they were there to kill, why didn't they
[1:07:59.800 --> 1:08:01.800]  kill anyone?
[1:08:01.800 --> 1:08:06.800]  If they were there to kill, why didn't they kill anyone?
[1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:09.800]  And then of course they would tell you the big lie that they killed Brian Sicknick, but
[1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:12.800]  he was admitted to a hospital days later because of a stroke.
[1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:17.800]  And of course it turned out the fire extinguisher story that they all ran with was a complete
[1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:20.800]  lie, just like everything else that they do is a lie.
[1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:30.800]  So now we know Eric Swalwell is a demonic liar and we know Scott Dorkin is a demonic liar.
[1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:33.800]  And then there's this.
[1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:38.800]  So those are the leaders, those are the demonic leaders of this big lie.
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:41.800]  Scott Dorkin, who goes on TV, he's a demonic liar.
[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:46.800]  Eric Swalwell, who sits in Congress, he's a demonic liar.
[1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:52.800]  And, you know, they're both probably into very sordid activities with minors too, but
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:54.800]  we'll just leave it at that.
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:09:01.800]  But, but so here's, here is the, the people that they deceive.
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:02.800]  Listen to this.
[1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:08.800]  Now again, who knows what's really going on with all these bots and stuff on Twitter.
[1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:10.800]  Who knows if any of these people are even real.
[1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:15.800]  And then we see how they put out their propaganda with tens of thousands of Twitter bots putting
[1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:18.800]  out the exact same tweets, just to force a narrative home.
[1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:20.800]  But, but listen to this response.
[1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:21.800]  Another one.
[1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:24.800]  This is just some leftist on Twitter responding.
[1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:26.800]  Ashley Babbitt was driven mad by Q.
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:32.800]  She was running in circles shrieking when the gun warning was called out multiple times.
[1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:34.800]  What?
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:36.800]  What?
[1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:39.800]  Seriously, these people don't live in reality, folks.
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:41.800]  There's video of the whole thing.
[1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:44.800]  There was no warning of a gun shot.
[1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:45.800]  There was no warning.
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:49.800]  Ashley Babbitt wasn't running in circles shrieking.
[1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:53.800]  Where do these people come up with this stuff?
[1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:57.800]  Where do these people come up with this stuff?
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:58.800]  They just make it up.
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:00.800]  That's how.
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:03.800]  Because that's what they see their leaders doing.
[1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:11.800]  They see their leaders telling lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie.
[1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:14.800]  So they just figured, hey, I'll just lie. I'll just make something up and lie.
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:16.800]  It's par for the course.
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:22.800]  Yeah, here's the video of Ashley Babbitt, according to this lying liberal, probably also possessed by the devil,
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:26.800]  running around in circles shrieking?
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:28.800]  No, that never happened.
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:31.800]  Just another lie from the left.
[1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:34.800]  Only God can save us from these demons.
[1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:36.800]  These demons are not going to go away.
[1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:39.800]  These demons are not going to stop trying to enslave you.
[1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:41.800]  These demons are not going to stop trying to deceive you.
[1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:44.800]  These demons are not going to stop lying to you.
[1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:47.800]  They're not going to stop.
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:50.800]  They should be arrested.
[1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:54.800]  But we don't have the will to do that yet in this country, sadly.
[1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:57.800]  So they just continue to lie.
[1:10:57.800 --> 1:11:06.800]  Just like the Black Lives Matter activist, Democrat Party activist, police officers that they had testifying
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:10.800]  about January 6th the other day, just lying, lying, lying, lying, lying.
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:13.800]  And they all know they're lying. They all know it's an agenda.
[1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:16.800]  They've all been trained on this. They've all been taught how to do this.
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:18.800]  And they really think they're going to win.
[1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:20.800]  They really think that they're going to have a victory in this.
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:25.800]  And even if, but that's the thing, even if they had their way and they destroyed America
[1:11:25.800 --> 1:11:28.800]  and destroy human freedom like they're fighting for it to do right now,
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:31.800]  that's not a victory, you fools.
[1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:34.800]  It's not a victory. That's a loss.
[1:11:34.800 --> 1:11:38.800]  You haven't figured it out yet, have you?
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:41.800]  You haven't figured it out yet, have you?
[1:11:41.800 --> 1:11:48.800]  That as soon as the devil is done with you, he's going to throw you into the ash heap of history.
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:57.800]  You lay in bed with your father, the devil, and you trust that demonic spirit is going to give you anything.
[1:11:57.800 --> 1:12:03.800]  You trust that demon is going to fulfill any promise it's made to you.
[1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:11.800]  You fools, you will learn how much you've been deceived.
[1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:18.800]  And when that day comes, it's going to be a rude awakening for you.
[1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:22.800]  It's going to be a rude awakening for those police officers that lied to America.
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:26.800]  It's going to be a rude awakening for Eric Swalwell, who lies to America and his family.
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:30.800]  It's going to be a rude awakening for Scott Dorkin, who lies to America.
[1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:37.800]  It's going to be a rude awakening for all of you falling under the spell of this demon, this demonic possession that you're in.
[1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:43.800]  As soon as the devil is done with you, he's going to throw you in the ash heap of history and you're going to burn forever.
[1:12:43.800 --> 1:12:52.800]  And you're going to be tormented for the rest of your existence, your sad, pathetic, measly existence.
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:57.800]  And we have identified the Chinese Communist agent at the New York Times.
[1:12:57.800 --> 1:13:01.800]  New York Times reporter deletes tweet calling Trump supporters enemies of the state.
[1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:05.800]  Well, she obviously meant that they're enemies of the Chinese Communist state. Absolutely.
[1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:07.800]  That wants to destroy America.
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:11.800]  And she has since deleted the tweet.
[1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:21.800]  New York Times reporter Kate Brenner is almost undoubtedly a Chinese Communist agent.
[1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:31.800]  Just like the human blob fish, Dr. Lena, when that goes on CNN telling you you're not free anymore, unless you take a vaccine,
[1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:36.800]  which of course, once again, what are they learning? Hey, I took the vaccine and I'm still not free.
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:40.800]  Hey, I took the vaccine and I'm sick. Hey, I took the vaccine. Now I have COVID.
[1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:45.800]  Hey, I took the vaccine and now I'm told I'm a super spreader and have to wear the mask.
[1:13:45.800 --> 1:13:53.800]  When will all of you brainwashed minions wake up and realize you are just a toy of Satan?
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:19.800]  A product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:24.800]  Bio septic pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:26.800]  This stuff lives in your septic system.

[1:14:35.800 --> 1:14:40.800]  Bio septic pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.

[1:14:46.800 --> 1:15:15.800]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:25.800]  This is the rocket filler foundation.
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:29.800]  This is the rocket filler foundation. They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:34.800]  They're now implementing it and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private rocket filler foundation.
[1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:44.800]  Of course, the rocket filler foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Institute in Germany.
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:48.800]  Infowars will continue to set fast. They fight this. I don't know how long we can.
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:16:14.800]  Yeah, he's coming for us all now. God bless and good luck. I would again get right with God right now.
[1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:28.800]  Bill Thomas Massey making fun of Nancy Pelosi trolling her, standing in the middle of the capital Rotunda without a mask, saying,
[1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:31.800]  What are you going to do, Nancy? Are you going to come arrest me?
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:40.800]  Of course, Nancy Pelosi released a statement saying anybody who's in the House side of Congress without a mask on is going to be arrested.
[1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:50.800]  That's Nancy Pelosi launching a police state inside the capital. Nancy Pelosi, a woman who belongs in jail yesterday.
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:58.800]  Man, oh man, oh man, I'll tell you what, we know we're dealing with millions of brainwashed Americans that fall for the lies of mainstream media and the Democrat Party.
[1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:10.800]  But you know, I could actually, we could actually dramatically improve America overnight and probably even save this country if we arrested almost all members of the Democrat Party.
[1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:16.800]  And I see, this is the thing is, I'm not for a police state. I'm not for political prisoners. That's not really my thing.
[1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:22.800]  That's not what we do. But I mean, that's their plan for us. That's what they do. So we might as well get out ahead of it.
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:32.800]  And let's just be honest, if we didn't have to deal with Nancy Pelosi in this country anymore, if we didn't have to deal with Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff and the Biden crime family and the rest of them,
[1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:37.800]  this country would be better off and it wouldn't even be close and everybody knows it.
[1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:44.800]  We would be free again. We wouldn't have near as many politicians stealing our money and lying to us all day long.
[1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:54.800]  We would be much better off and everybody knows it. Everybody damn well knows it. That if the Democrats were all arrested and thrown in jail tomorrow and the key was lost,
[1:17:54.800 --> 1:18:01.800]  this country would be back to some semblance of normal. They wouldn't be stealing our tax dollars as much as they normally do.
[1:18:01.800 --> 1:18:10.800]  They wouldn't be lying to us and gaslighting us and dividing us like they normally do. And we could actually save this country if we just got these damn dirtbag demon Democrats out of the way.
[1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:17.800]  But we're not like that, are we? We're actually freedom-loving individuals that don't like tyranny and government oppression.
[1:18:17.800 --> 1:18:22.800]  So sadly, these demonic forces continue to exist and try to destroy us.
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:32.800]  Now, speaking of demonic possession, here's another perfect example of it and it's always a liberal, isn't it?
[1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:41.800]  It's always one of these acronym rainbow flag liberals that are pedophiles.
[1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:51.800]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Fortnite streamer Raul Zito has been arrested over allegations that he's raped two children ages 10 and 14.
[1:18:51.800 --> 1:18:56.800]  And so you get a little bit of an idea of who this guy is.
[1:18:56.800 --> 1:19:03.800]  And then here's another image of him. He's got his bright blue hair and his bright pink beard and he's got his shirt.
[1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:08.800]  Love has no gender, religion, sexuality, body type or color.
[1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:16.800]  Yeah, I guess so. That's why you were arrested with the allegations of raping little kids.
[1:19:16.800 --> 1:19:23.800]  And he even boasted about it during his live streams about how he likes to play with young talents.
[1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:29.800]  So he was telling the world that he was a child abuser as far as the eye could see.
[1:19:29.800 --> 1:19:41.800]  And so you have to understand the whole reason why these leftists do the LGBTQ plus rainbow stuff and dye their hair and wear the t-shirts and wave the flag.
[1:19:41.800 --> 1:19:48.800]  It's a disguise. It's a cover so that you look at them like, oh, look, they're good people.
[1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:57.800]  They're loving. They're gay. They're this. And really inside, they're just thinking about raping your kids.
[1:19:57.800 --> 1:20:08.800]  That's why all these drag queen storytime incidents where you had men showing up to schools dressed as women and it turned out many of them were convicted pedophiles.
[1:20:08.800 --> 1:20:14.800]  That's why you had the gay San Francisco choir do an entire song about how they were coming for your kids.
[1:20:14.800 --> 1:20:28.800]  Folks, the whole LGBTQ front for many of these individuals, the whole drag queen storytime front for many of these individuals is just a cover for their real true desire to rape your children.
[1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:39.800]  That's what this is. So when you see this guy wearing the LGBTQ plus stuff and waving the pride flag and dying his beard pink, it's all a cover.
[1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:47.800]  It's all a disguise so that you don't realize that what he's really thinking about is raping your kids.
[1:20:47.800 --> 1:20:53.800]  It's all a front. It's all a front, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:56.800]  So you've been warned.
[1:20:56.800 --> 1:21:02.800]  Now there he is with all the kiddos, but look, he's got a pink beard and he's got blue hair.
[1:21:02.800 --> 1:21:10.800]  So he's must be good. He's just gay. You know, he's just an activist and the whole system teaches you to just embrace this behavior.
[1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:25.800]  And the whole system teaches you that that's just totally innocent when deep down behind that pink beard and underneath that bright blue hair is a guy who's thinking about raping your kids.
[1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:29.800]  Every single time.
[1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:36.800]  And again, I mean, I can't sit here on on all the news stories I've covered to just be redundant.
[1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:42.800]  But it's like, do I have to go back to all the vice headlines, dozens of vice headlines talking about how great pedophilia is?
[1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:48.800]  Do we have to show you the pedophiles that brought the world Desmond the amazing?
[1:21:48.800 --> 1:21:53.800]  Do we have to show you all the pedophiles that infiltrated drag queen storytime convicted pedophiles?
[1:21:53.800 --> 1:22:00.800]  Do we have to show you the drag queens showing up with their with their penises out and bouncing little kids on their laps?
[1:22:00.800 --> 1:22:02.800]  Do you really want to see all this again?
[1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:10.800]  Or can I just continue to cover the news and just move on until the world finally realizes what's going on?
[1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:15.800]  These are pedophiles that want to rape your children.
[1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:23.800]  And they disguise themselves as LGBTQ plus, they disguise themselves as liberals. That's just a mask.
[1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:31.800]  That's just a disguise so that they can get access to your kids and rape them.
[1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:35.800]  Here's another liberal reporter out of Europe.
[1:22:35.800 --> 1:22:38.800]  This is an actual tweet. She actually tweeted this.
[1:22:38.800 --> 1:22:42.800]  Someone needs to create porn for children.
[1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:46.800]  I mean, stop right there. Find a rope and a tree.
[1:22:46.800 --> 1:22:50.800]  But no, she goes on. Someone needs to create porn for children.
[1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:57.800]  Young teens are already watching porn, but they're finding hardcore, aggressive videos that give a terrible view of sex.
[1:22:57.800 --> 1:23:04.800]  They need entry level porn, a soft core site where everyone asks for consent and no one gets choked, etc.
[1:23:04.800 --> 1:23:15.800]  So here's an individual who's admitting how bad porn is for your psychological makeup, how bad porn is for your brain, and how it distorts love and sex and everything good.
[1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:24.800]  But instead of saying, hey, maybe we should stop watching porn, maybe we should stop promoting porn, maybe kids shouldn't be watching porn,
[1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:35.800]  instead this demented psychotic says we should have porn for kids, and I'm sure she would be more than willing to run that enterprise, wouldn't she?
[1:23:35.800 --> 1:23:39.800]  This is like the Democrat Party with Jocelyn Elder saying, we need to teach your kid how to masturbate.
[1:23:39.800 --> 1:23:43.800]  We need to reach down your kid's pants and grab their generals and show them how to masturbate.
[1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:48.800]  That's called rape.
[1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:56.800]  But they don't word it that way, see? Oh, we just need to teach your kids how to watch porn.
[1:23:56.800 --> 1:24:01.800]  No, you want to rape my kid. Oh, we just need to teach your kid how to masturbate.
[1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:07.800]  No, you want to rape my kid. It's time to quit playing games with these pieces of shit.
[1:24:07.800 --> 1:24:12.800]  It's time to quit playing games with these damn demons.
[1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:16.800]  Hey, I get it though. Believe me, I get it.
[1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:21.800]  It's kind of like that story that came out in New York City with that dead guy who showed up on the street that said, I touch little girls,
[1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:32.800]  because see, here's the thing, most humans still have an instinct in them that you find out someone's molesting little boys and little girls,
[1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:38.800]  you know, natural law is beat that person to death immediately.
[1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:42.800]  And so they still know that there's that little, there's that instinct out there.
[1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:49.800]  So they have to deceive that and do an end around on that and they say, oh, we're just teaching your kids how to watch porn and masturbate.
[1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:52.800]  No, you damn demons are raping kids and you know what you deserve.
[1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:56.800]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:24:56.800 --> 1:25:02.800]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:08.800]  It hurts, it stinks, it's got pus coming out of it. I go to the doctor, they fix it. That's not negative.
[1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:15.800]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel yet, but now it's come to the surface.
[1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:17.800]  That's actually a positive thing.
[1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:22.800]  And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job. They stole the election. We can't get down about that.
[1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:26.800]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:30.800]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed. They're scared.
[1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:34.800]  That's why instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers, look what happened.
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:41.800]  No, we're a bunch of winners. They're trying to suppress us. Let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:45.800]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:25:45.800 --> 1:25:49.800]  Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're in an information war.
[1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:53.800]  We're going to win this together and the fight starts at templewars.com.
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:59.800]  The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:10.800]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[1:26:10.800 --> 1:26:20.800]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:23.800]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:26:23.800 --> 1:26:29.800]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:34.800]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:39.800]  That is invincible. That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[1:26:39.800 --> 1:26:48.800]  So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:53.800]  We will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender.
[1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:28.800]  This mouthwash only uses the best natural ingredients like real peppermint oil, thyme oil, xylitol, and of course high quality charcoal.

[1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:12.800]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:15.800]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:19.800]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:26.800]  The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it. Get off the fence, get the product, support the info war.
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:29.800]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:31.800]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:32.800]  Honor, talk to you.
[1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:43.800]  Awesome. So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29. If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps with the bedroom.
[1:28:43.800 --> 1:28:45.800]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:47.800]  Well, it definitely works. It's not a joke.
[1:28:47.800 --> 1:29:16.800]  Absolutely.
[1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:21.800]  What are the Democrats so afraid of? What are they hiding?
[1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:27.800]  Why don't they want the election audits to continue?
[1:29:27.800 --> 1:29:39.800]  All right, it's a rhetorical question. We all know why. They stole the election as clear as the sun in the sky on a cloudless day.
[1:29:39.800 --> 1:29:42.800]  And this is just amazing here.
[1:29:42.800 --> 1:29:45.800]  Wow, this is actually a new development.
[1:29:45.800 --> 1:29:49.800]  This is not what I was referring to, but the crew just pulled it up.
[1:29:49.800 --> 1:29:53.800]  We'll, we'll, we'll pivot briefly here.
[1:29:53.800 --> 1:30:05.800]  Matt Gaetz goes to the DC Department of Corrections to go see the conditions of the January 6th Democrat Party prisoners and they locked them out.
[1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:09.800]  Wow. Wow.
[1:30:09.800 --> 1:30:17.800]  The Democrats are literally torturing Americans right now inside prison cells. They have political prisoners that they're torturing inside of prison cells right now.
[1:30:17.800 --> 1:30:22.800]  They're all American heroes being tortured by Democrats right now.
[1:30:22.800 --> 1:30:27.800]  And they locked the facility and they won't let Republicans in to see the conditions.
[1:30:27.800 --> 1:30:32.800]  Okay. Wow. I was going to talk about how they're covering up their election theft from 2020.
[1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:37.800]  And then the crew. All right, so guys, let's just go ahead and roll this video from the top.
[1:30:37.800 --> 1:30:43.800]  Matt Gaetz shows up at the DC prison where the Democrats have political prisoners and they're torturing them right now.
[1:30:43.800 --> 1:30:47.800]  Here's Matt Gaetz being locked out. Marjorie Taylor Greene and others being locked out of the building.
[1:30:47.800 --> 1:31:05.800]  Come to the door and a bunch of security comes and stands in front of the door to block people from even seeing inside.
[1:31:05.800 --> 1:31:12.800]  I'm an attorney here to see a client.
[1:31:12.800 --> 1:31:18.800]  Oh, they don't like the cameras being there. They don't like politicians being there showing what the Democrats are doing.
[1:31:18.800 --> 1:31:25.800]  The scum of the earth, the Democrat Party, the scum of the earth.
[1:31:25.800 --> 1:31:35.800]  The door's locked and we're just here to ask questions and now they've locked the door and have not given us access.
[1:31:35.800 --> 1:31:39.800]  So this was apparently an evasion switch. We are here just to speak to a supervisor and when the supervisor came out.
[1:31:39.800 --> 1:31:44.800]  You've got one American news there. You've got right side broadcast in there. You've got Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[1:31:44.800 --> 1:31:52.800]  You've got attorneys of the political prisoners and the cubs come in and they lock the door and they stand by the door.
[1:31:52.800 --> 1:32:03.800]  Louis Goldman is there.
[1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:15.800]  You know, the Democrat Party has declared war on America. The Democrat Party has declared war on the American citizens.
[1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:23.800]  Boy, oh boy.
[1:32:23.800 --> 1:32:30.800]  I wonder when America is going to declare war on them.
[1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:34.800]  And you know, we don't live in a free country anymore. We don't have free speech. So, you know, you got to be careful what you say.
[1:32:34.800 --> 1:32:44.800]  The FBI may come knock your door down and send you to a Democrat do log, but you wonder, don't you?
[1:32:44.800 --> 1:32:49.800]  You wonder when America is going to rise up and declare war on the Democrat Party.
[1:32:49.800 --> 1:32:52.800]  You wonder when America is going to rise up and declare war on the media.
[1:32:52.800 --> 1:33:02.800]  You wonder when America is going to rise up, stand tall, stand firm and just start kicking communist globalist ass.
[1:33:02.800 --> 1:33:10.800]  This is getting out of control, man, from the COVID tyranny to political prisoners to lying through their teeth 24 seven.
[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:18.800]  I mean, seriously, we can't take much more of this, man. This is just ridiculous.
[1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:24.800]  And we're still in peace mode and that's fine, but it might not be fine much longer.
[1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:30.800]  And that's not a call to violence. That's not a threat. I'm just sitting here as a commentator doing play by play.
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:41.800]  And let me tell you, Democrats, how far do you really think you can push the American people before the lies that you tell about January 6 that are actually true?
[1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:55.800]  I mean, how long do you think you can continue to destroy this country and arrest political prisoners until there is an actual rise up of the American people and they actually do want to do bad things to you?
[1:33:55.800 --> 1:34:06.800]  Again, I'm not calling for violence. I'm a peaceful revolutionary. But but let me tell you, you guys are biting off way more than you can chew.
[1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:15.800]  And you're going to kill a lot of people and you're going to arrest a lot of people and you're going to destroy a lot of people's lives and you're going to you're going to really destroy this country for a period of time.
[1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:26.800]  But Satan never wins in the end. Do you have any idea what you're what you're asking for at this point? I mean, this is just out of control, man.
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:37.800]  And so I was going to get into how they're covering up the election fraud. The Department of Justice has stepped in and and said that states performing audits are illegal.
[1:34:37.800 --> 1:34:49.800]  No, no, it's not. And you don't have the right to shut down state audits. So nice try, Merrick Garland.
[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:58.800]  And we're identifying some of the illegal actors. Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jack Sellers has close ties with China.
[1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:09.800]  Is that why he's fighting so hard against the Senate's 2020 election audit in Maricopa County? Absolutely it is 100% stories at the Gateway Pundit.
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:17.800]  Twitter bans election 2020 audit accounts. Yeah, you're not allowed to know about the audit. You're not allowed to see how the Democrats stole it.
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:33.800]  Jay Sekulow is asking all Arizona and Pennsylvania voters who were given Sharpies win voting to contact his law firm. So if you're in Arizona and that happened to you, contact Jay Sekulow's law firm and he wants to hear your story.
[1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:42.800]  And then I've got all of these videos. Yeah, as if the Democrats blocking out the election, the polling centers isn't enough evidence that they stole it.
[1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:53.800]  We've got all the other evidence on the planet as well. Oh, yeah, they block you from watching them tally the votes and then they block you from going into their prisons where they have their political prisoners.
[1:35:53.800 --> 1:36:06.800]  I mean, seriously, this is out of control, man, and I have to bite my tongue here, okay? But this is out of control.
[1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:16.800]  Our lawmakers better get serious real quick. And it's not going to happen out of the Biden administration. That administration is corrupt as the day is long. Every member of it.
[1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:24.800]  You're leaving us no recourse, you bastards. You're leaving us no recourse, you bastards.
[1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:36.800]  You are going to release the devil dogs in this country and it is not going to be pretty because they're not nice guys like me that wear a jacket and a tie and comb their hair.
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:50.800]  No, they're not. They're hardened. They're hardened men and women that are sick and damn tired of being a fucking slave in their own country.
[1:36:50.800 --> 1:37:02.800]  So it won't be me calling for violence. I'd like to do this peacefully and politically. It won't be me that you see like all the fear-mongering lies you tell about January 6th.
[1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:13.800]  Not going to be Owen Schreuer. No, no, no. I'm a nice guy. I'm a fun, loving guy. I like playing golf and listening to music and going to concerts and ball games and drinking a beer.
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:21.800]  But let me tell you, the men and women that you're pissing off to the point of no return are not nice looking guys like me.
[1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:28.800]  They're devil dogs. They're warriors and they're fucking pissed.
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:36.800]  And January 6th was nothing. It was nothing.
[1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:47.800]  It was nothing. It was a little not. It was a little not compared to the Tyrannosaurus Rex that you're begging to come eat your ass.
[1:37:47.800 --> 1:38:00.800]  See, I can't help myself. I get pissed and I get mad and I need to be controlled here and not say things, but like seriously, man.
[1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:08.800]  Anyway, you know, I got all these videos. We got Alex Jones coming up in the next segment. I got all these videos. We got Trump, who was at Bette Mister Golf Club.
[1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:14.800]  Just a rousing, raucous applause. Never do you see an event like that for Biden.
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:26.800]  And then this nice lady on Twitter at Salty underscore Sundays has put together a thread of videos from every state leading up to the election.
[1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:39.800]  Iowa, Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Missouri, Hawaii, New York, California of just all the grassroots Trump rallies, not actual Trump rallies, but the grassroots Trump rallies.
[1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:47.800]  The grassroots Trump rallies were just tens of thousands of people show up, both parades, parades in the streets, and you never had a single one for Biden.
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:52.800]  Oh, but he got 80 million votes. You guys are such liars and criminal frauds, man. It's unbelievable.
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:39:01.800]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown. The first one has already destroyed the third world already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death.
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:05.800]  And it's caused massive supply chain problems across the Western world.
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:12.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storeable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:23.800]  The biggest, best company in the United States is our supplier. Their entire catalog is at infowarstore.com. You get an additional 10% off at infowarstore.com, but only for one more week.
[1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:31.800]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex, but that's it. They won't do this sale again until November and then the food prices go up in 2022.
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:40.800]  This is insurance you can eat. It's the highest quality, hundreds of high quality foods, three months, six months, your supplies all ready for you at infowarstore.com.
[1:39:40.800 --> 1:39:50.800]  Or call toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. Again, infowarstore.com, 10% off on high quality, storeable food, ready to ship, but it ends in just one week.
[1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:52.800]  So take action now while you still can.
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:59.800]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:07.800]  That it's criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public. They do the same things over and over again.
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:12.800]  Criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:25.800]  Well, guess what? It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenics's globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV.
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:34.800]  And they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[1:40:34.800 --> 1:40:40.800]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non lethal down the road.
[1:40:40.800 --> 1:40:49.800]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[1:40:49.800 --> 1:41:15.800]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:48.800]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use. It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked.
[1:41:48.800 --> 1:41:53.800]  You're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system. They're 50% off right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:56.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroyer here, the host of the Infowars War Room.
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:01.800]  And I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfowarsStore.com.
[1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:06.800]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:12.800]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfowarsStore.com.
[1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:16.800]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away. Listen to this.

[1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:42.800]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.

[1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:52.800]  That's 33% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:42:55.800 --> 1:42:59.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:14.800]  Yeah, the Democrats are in total panic right now. They've been cost-stealing the election.
[1:43:14.800 --> 1:43:20.800]  They have hundreds of political prisoners and the world and America is finally awaking to how evil they are.
[1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:24.800]  And you know, I lost my temper in that last segment.
[1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:29.800]  And I apologized to the crew and they said, stuff your star is in a sack.
[1:43:29.800 --> 1:43:34.800]  And look, I'm not some big tough guy here. I'm not trying to, you know, flex my muscles or anything.
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:39.800]  Believe me, I'm just the voice of reason. I'm just the voice of America.
[1:43:39.800 --> 1:43:48.800]  And this country is just screaming at the top of its lungs to be released from this hellish nightmare grip
[1:43:48.800 --> 1:44:00.800]  of the New World Order, of globalism, of fake liberalism, of BS, LGBTQ, and BS, race-baiting, and mainstream media Democrat party lies.
[1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:11.800]  And you sick bastards, you sick, sick, psychotic, demonic bastards that are arresting innocent Americans and torturing them in jail cells
[1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:24.800]  and that are stealing all of our money and that are stealing our elections and that are taking our freedoms with a pandemic that you caused.
[1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:34.800]  Do you really think that you can get away with this? Do you really think the world is going to eventually awake into this and be pissed at you?
[1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:42.800]  And they write stories in the Atlantic talking about how Mike Lindell is destroying American democracy.
[1:44:42.800 --> 1:44:49.800]  Do you really think people buy your bull crap? Do you really think you're getting away with this?
[1:44:49.800 --> 1:45:02.800]  You just, you are just poking a sleeping giant incessantly. You're torturing a sleeping giant incessantly.
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:08.800]  So, yeah, I lost my temper. It's kind of inevitable when you're dealing with this stuff here every day.
[1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:14.800]  Alex Jones joins us on the phone line. It's just incredible here, Alex.
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:22.800]  I don't know if you've seen, but the DC police just blocked Republican congressmen and women from going into the jail cell
[1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:26.800]  where they're holding and torturing their political prisoners and now they're not even letting their attorneys in
[1:45:26.800 --> 1:45:35.800]  because they don't want the world to see that the Democrat Party currently has political prisoners that are being tortured in real time right now.
[1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:40.800]  And if they can set the precedent for them, they can do it with everybody. That's how it started with the Russians.
[1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:46.800]  With the Bolsheviks just holding a few hundred, then it was a few thousand, then it was a few million, then it was scarred 20 million.
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:55.800]  Who lacks the death? And oh, yes, I've been listening to you, but I was sitting there sending clips of the crew, sending clips to the crew
[1:45:55.800 --> 1:46:02.800]  of all these talking heads on TV, not just Don Lemon saying, don't let people have their kids. Don't let them have food.
[1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:09.800]  Don't let them go to the grocery store. Same thing McCron said. That's where they want to take you, give you, accept the vaccine passport.
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:16.800]  And that's what these idiots don't get if they think, oh, just get the vaccine. Oh, just comply and everything will go back to normal.
[1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:24.800]  No, the plan is it never goes back to normal. It's like sticking your hand in a garbage disposal or feeding yourself feet first into a wood chipper.
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:32.800]  The deeper you go into the wood chipper, the worse it gets. This is a methodology. This is a takeover. This is a program. This is an operation.
[1:46:32.800 --> 1:46:39.800]  And again, I'm screaming every five minutes. We have the plan so everyone listens so the governors and the legislatures and others get it.
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:49.800]  This is a real worldwide takeover using the fear of a virus of the pretext to set up a worldwide digital grid and paramilitary force to disapprove of what they want in their own words.
[1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:58.800]  Everything I've said is in their own damn words. Folks, Bill Gates said a year and a half ago, oh, you'll have to take shots every year for the variants.
[1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:04.800]  They had all this planned out, even though that's not based on science. So absolutely, I was listening to you talk about that.
[1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:13.800]  There are 500 plus people in that DC jail, many of which didn't even break a window or throw a rock or even hit a cop or even yell at a cop.
[1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:21.800]  And they are in there until they one by one, solitary confinement, turn on America and come out and say, yes, I'm a white supremacist.
[1:47:21.800 --> 1:47:28.800]  If you say you're a white supremacist, they send Democrat lawyers in as your quote, you know, public defender that's come out in the news.
[1:47:28.800 --> 1:47:33.800]  And they literally tell them every day you'll be out of here if you just say you're a white supremacist and the Donald Trump is a white supremacist.
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:43.800]  So literally, like, like, like, like when our airmen would get shot over northern Vietnam, they'd be tortured for a few years until they go on TV and say America's horrible and evil.
[1:47:43.800 --> 1:47:51.800]  This is war crimes. This is criminal. And we always hear about our congressman going to foreign countries and demanding to investigate their elections if there's evidence of fraud.
[1:47:51.800 --> 1:48:01.800]  And if the government doesn't want an investigation, and we always hear about congressmen and women going to other countries and demanding that people be released for political prisoners.
[1:48:01.800 --> 1:48:07.800]  But it's big international incidents. But now the UN Human Rights Board is run by people from Saudi Arabia and Qatar and communist China.
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:14.800]  It's all a sick joke, whether it's Charlie Munger or Bill Gates or Ted Turner or Justin Trudeau.
[1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:26.800]  They admire Gigi Pink. The guy is a damn rock star to the left. We have employees there right now who have family members that I knew 18 years ago who won't even talk to one of my oldest employees.
[1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:33.800]  He's our oldest employee. Won't even talk to John. What's his last name? Great guy. Won't even talk to John because she now worships Gigi Pink.
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:38.800]  Oh, by the way, she's a public school teacher. So, and by the way, the other teachers over there, they're all malice.
[1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:43.800]  So normal people that I knew 18 years ago are now literal malice that hate America.
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:49.800]  Do you understand, ladies and gentlemen, that we're not exaggerating here? None of this is made up.
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:57.800]  So, so getting back to the main point, the good news is finally Congress gets it and finally Congress is demanding from the CDC.
[1:48:57.800 --> 1:49:02.800]  Oh, show us your data to back up your mass stuff. Show us your mass research.
[1:49:02.800 --> 1:49:06.800]  And then all the studies say the opposite. I can give you bacterial pneumonia. Don't stop anything.
[1:49:06.800 --> 1:49:13.800]  If you're sick with something and you wear a mask, it might protect people a few percentage points more because a big particulate might not get out.
[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:19.800]  If you use clean masks every couple of new hours, but it doesn't do the reverse.
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:24.800]  It might protect other people if you're sick. Only if you were sick would you wear a mask if you're going to be out in public.
[1:49:24.800 --> 1:49:29.800]  And it still does almost nothing. So it's all psychology of submission.
[1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:33.800]  It's all psychology of dominance to say we're all sick. We're all patients. We're the virus.
[1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:37.800]  And until the virus is under control, that's what the globalists call humanity.
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:46.800]  That's what Klaus Schwab and Ted Turner call us and George Soros. They all go to depopulation events with Bill Gates.
[1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:52.800]  And they openly say we're going to get the virus under control. Every year they have films that get awards.
[1:49:52.800 --> 1:50:00.800]  Where it's cartoons of like humans are a virus that take over the earth and then invade the universe and must be exterminated.
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:03.800]  So they talk about the virus. They're talking about you.
[1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:07.800]  When CNN says we need to start people to death and take their jobs and take their children.
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:11.800]  That's what Kathleen Sebelius said just last week. Now Don Lemon's saying it.
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:16.800]  Now Brian Williams is saying it. All these people that are criminal liars.
[1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:21.800]  Brian Williams saying he's shot down in a helicopter. Now he's the head fat checker at MSNBC.
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:27.800]  It's all a joke. Again, it'd be like having Jeffrey Dahmer run a council against human cannibalism.
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:36.800]  So that's where we are. And I'm sorry to have to tell people this. The bigger question is when are we going to get angry and shout them down and say they're frauds.
[1:50:36.800 --> 1:50:43.800]  I want to play a clip from Chip Roy, a conversation from Texas here in a moment. It's clip eight with the great Tucker Carlson in throwing it.
[1:50:43.800 --> 1:50:48.800]  But the first thing I want to say is this. They're saying we're all backwards. We're all evil.
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:53.800]  We're all the most horrible thing on the planet. I've been making the point for months and I'm going to make it here again.
[1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:58.800]  Because thank God finally Tucker Carlson picked up on it last night. I'm not seeing anyone else do this.
[1:50:58.800 --> 1:51:03.800]  And if everyone will just listen to me, bigger than people learning that has prions that can kill them.
[1:51:03.800 --> 1:51:07.800]  Bigger than learning that it doesn't protect you and makes you actually a super spreader of mutated viruses.
[1:51:07.800 --> 1:51:11.800]  That's in the literature and the FDA and the CDC and you would admit it.
[1:51:11.800 --> 1:51:15.800]  And Germany passed a law allowing big, big pharma to infect everybody just this year.
[1:51:15.800 --> 1:51:23.800]  If everyone just grasps this, please listen to me. If everyone gets the talking point out, it's game over.
[1:51:23.800 --> 1:51:28.800]  You pull the numbers up. Saudi Arabia is less than 20% injected. I want to call it vaccinated.
[1:51:28.800 --> 1:51:34.800]  Okay. They're only 20% marked. They keep saying 10% in India.
[1:51:34.800 --> 1:51:40.800]  The Indians aren't stupid. They've had Bill Gates and others for decades, caught sterilizing them, killing them, whole villages get sick.
[1:51:40.800 --> 1:51:43.800]  They're literally not just beating up people to try to inject them. The word is they've been killing them.
[1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:46.800]  That is in the military and the military is refusing to enforce.
[1:51:46.800 --> 1:51:54.800]  Less than 10% of the Indians have even taken one shot and that's their government's attenuated regular vaccine.
[1:51:54.800 --> 1:52:00.800]  Because the national health spokesman took it and died three days later. He was in total health at 55.
[1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:03.800]  He's like a big movie star over there. He died. So they're not stupid.
[1:52:03.800 --> 1:52:08.800]  The Indians are at 6% as of last week and they've been doing the injections now for eight months.
[1:52:08.800 --> 1:52:15.800]  6%. The Saudi Arabians are less than 20%. If you go to all these other countries, they're not taking these so-called vaccines.
[1:52:15.800 --> 1:52:22.800]  They're not taking the mRNA vaccines and the vast majority are not having issues.
[1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:25.800]  What's starving people to death in India is the lockdown.
[1:52:25.800 --> 1:52:30.800]  That's what's causing all the funeral pyres is the starvation and the malnutrition, which you won't even admit.
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:38.800]  Tucker calls the last night and makes the point. He goes, Saudi Arabia is good because they're mandating the vaccine, which is, again, just all talk.
[1:52:38.800 --> 1:52:44.800]  So we need to be progressive like them and we need to force America. That's not progressive. That's authoritarian.
[1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:49.800]  And the answer is getting in the face of the Democrats and calling their bluff because they're such huge frauds.
[1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:53.800]  But first, in case you missed it, I was sitting here last hour and played this clip.
[1:52:53.800 --> 1:52:56.800]  I got a bunch more clips of them saying that there's no reason to listen to them all. It gives me a headache.
[1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:01.800]  Everybody knows the talking point on every channel is a local TV, everybody that's all these blue check marks,
[1:53:01.800 --> 1:53:05.800]  all the so-called local doctors that, you know, you have 500 doctors that are against the inoculation.
[1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:09.800]  You'll have one that says it's great. He'll be all of the news saying, oh, it's quite normal.
[1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:14.800]  Make people take the shot or take their job or fire them. This is literal warfare.
[1:53:14.800 --> 1:53:20.800]  Take a deadly shot or we're going to bankrupt you and not let you have a job and not let you have groceries and put you under a bridge.
[1:53:20.800 --> 1:53:26.800]  While they won't control the border and while they're shipping in millions of people a month, by the way,
[1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:30.800]  so a million a month now is the real numbers coming out of the board patrol on taxpayer money.
[1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:38.800]  Airplanes landing every hour on the East Coast from Africa being flown here by United Airlines and American Airlines,
[1:53:38.800 --> 1:53:41.800]  the taxpayer funded. So again.
[1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:45.800]  But I'll tell you who's got five star ratings when it comes to customer service.
[1:53:45.800 --> 1:53:51.800]  I'll tell you who built his network and infrastructure and has thousands of employees here in the United States
[1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:56.800]  and sources of materials all over North America and from Africa as well, which he's proud of.
[1:53:56.800 --> 1:54:00.800]  That's where you get the good cotton and then they put it together here in the United States.
[1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:03.800]  And that is Mike Lindell.
[1:54:03.800 --> 1:54:06.800]  Mike Lindell is a patriot. Mike Lindell is fighting.
[1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:12.800]  He is bold and he's got his products in stock ready to ship to you.

[1:55:05.800 --> 1:55:14.800]  All the way out into 2024 and in 2024 you will again take two shots and he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[1:55:14.800 --> 1:55:19.800]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[1:55:19.800 --> 1:55:24.800]  They're now implementing it and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:55:24.800 --> 1:55:31.800]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler and the Eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:36.800]  that trained the Couserville Institute in Germany. And voters will continue to set fast. They fight this.
[1:55:36.800 --> 1:55:40.800]  I don't know how long we can. The enemy's coming for us all now. God bless and good luck.
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:42.800]  I would again get right with God right now.
[1:55:45.800 --> 1:55:48.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:55:48.800 --> 1:55:50.800]  The Alex Jones Show.
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:21.800]  We're talking about the end of human freedom. We're talking about global slavery.
[1:56:21.800 --> 1:56:26.800]  We're talking about forced murderous injections. So yeah, you know what? I'm going to get a little emotional.
[1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:35.800]  And I mean the only reprieve that I can see is at least we have Louis Gohmert, Paul Gosar, Matt Gates, Marjorie Taylor Greene
[1:56:35.800 --> 1:56:39.800]  finally making a big fuss out of the Democrat Party prisoners in D.C.
[1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:43.800]  and now they've finally gotten into that building. There's a huge media scrum with them.
[1:56:43.800 --> 1:56:50.800]  There's tons of people with them. That's the answer. That's the thing is info wars can't be leading these charges politically.
[1:56:50.800 --> 1:56:55.800]  We're a news organization. We're here to awaken people and get people out of their slumber.
[1:56:55.800 --> 1:57:00.800]  We need real action from our political leaders. We need real action from leaders in government.
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:07.800]  And I mean finally Alex, like finally, I mean it's barely even a trickle of water, but hey, maybe finally the dam will break
[1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:14.800]  and these Republican leaders will start to motivate other government officials to take the lead to save this country.
[1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:19.800]  Well, that's what it's going to take. And in fact, I'm not watching TV yet. It does. There's developments were happening.
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:23.800]  That's great news. So let's keep that on screen for TV viewers, but for radio listeners, everybody else.
[1:57:23.800 --> 1:57:28.800]  I was just about to come back and talk about Chip Roy from Texas and how he just got pissed.
[1:57:28.800 --> 1:57:32.800]  So this whole thing's a farce. You're a fraud. You're a scam. And call him out.
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:38.800]  You know, when you need to be angry, we need to get people out of their slumber. We need that's why I mean,
[1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:44.800]  I legitimately aren't putting on an act when I start stuttering on air and yelling to getting upset because this is real warfare.
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:51.800]  If we don't get upset by this covert warfare that they admit their own documents is warfare, then they're going to keep doing it.
[1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:55.800]  That's the reason they've spent all these crimes is they've gotten away with this for so long.
[1:57:55.800 --> 1:58:00.800]  And the average American, again, believes the social contract is still there.
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:04.800]  I'm going to tell you when we come back in the next segment, horrific stories.
[1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:11.800]  Well, I've been on a work occasion the last four or five days of people that I've talked to that have come up to me.
[1:58:11.800 --> 1:58:21.800]  And yesterday, when the third person told me of a family member who was 35 years old and great health, who was murdered by a ventilator,
[1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:32.800]  and then I started literally having what we call PTSD, but I mean, my brain was going back to all these hundreds of examples of that nurse we had on from New York.
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:38.800]  We should get her back on and others when she would see like them bring a homeless person in and say, oh, you got a sore throat.
[1:58:38.800 --> 1:58:44.800]  They have signed paperwork, put them in a coma and then take a week to kill them on a ventilator.
[1:58:44.800 --> 1:58:52.800]  And I ran into three people that came up to me and told me they murdered her family members the same way.
[1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:56.800]  And three separate people say, I'm thinking about taking action.
[1:58:56.800 --> 1:58:57.800]  What do you think I should do?
[1:58:57.800 --> 1:59:02.800]  And then I rented a boat, York State, to go fishing.
[1:59:02.800 --> 1:59:10.800]  And the captain of the boat is, again, 33, his best friend, cousin, first cousin, lives in Phoenix.
[1:59:10.800 --> 1:59:15.800]  I'll tell the story when we come back and we cover the other news, but I always say I'm going to cover some of those for them.
[1:59:15.800 --> 1:59:16.800]  And they murdered him.
[1:59:16.800 --> 1:59:17.800]  And he told me the story.
[1:59:17.800 --> 1:59:22.800]  He said he had sore throat, was coughing up green.
[1:59:22.800 --> 1:59:23.800]  He went to the regular doctor.
[1:59:23.800 --> 1:59:24.800]  They didn't get antibiotics.
[1:59:24.800 --> 1:59:25.800]  They didn't check it.
[1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:26.800]  They didn't see what it was.
[1:59:26.800 --> 1:59:27.800]  They didn't do any of that.
[1:59:27.800 --> 1:59:29.800]  They said, go to the hospital.
[1:59:29.800 --> 1:59:30.800]  You might have COVID.
[1:59:30.800 --> 1:59:31.800]  They get there.
[1:59:31.800 --> 1:59:32.800]  They test him again.
[1:59:32.800 --> 1:59:33.800]  We know those are fake tests.
[1:59:33.800 --> 1:59:35.800]  They said, hey, we're just going to intubate you.
[1:59:35.800 --> 1:59:36.800]  You'll be fine.
[1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:37.800]  Sign here.
[1:59:37.800 --> 1:59:38.800]  No family there.
[1:59:38.800 --> 1:59:40.800]  Didn't know what he was doing.
[1:59:40.800 --> 1:59:43.800]  Shines that they land down, put him to sleep.
[1:59:43.800 --> 1:59:47.800]  And then legal injected his ass with the modern guillotine known as the ventilator.
[1:59:47.800 --> 1:59:52.800]  And I'm sitting there with a fishing line in the water becoming physically angry.
[1:59:52.800 --> 1:59:54.800]  And I couldn't even enjoy myself anymore.
[1:59:54.800 --> 1:59:58.800]  So we just sat around the boat for four hours talking about, you know, what do we do?
[1:59:58.800 --> 2:00:01.800]  I mean, that's the level this is reached on because here's the deal.
[2:00:01.800 --> 2:00:03.800]  We better come up with a plan and Congress better come up with a plan.
[2:00:03.800 --> 2:00:04.800]  These double is better.
[2:00:04.800 --> 2:00:06.800]  Well, damn, there's something or they're going to be held accountable too.
[2:00:06.800 --> 2:00:09.800]  And I have no desire for physical war, but we're under attack.
[2:00:09.800 --> 2:00:13.800]  Just like Patrick Henry said, you know, you guys cry peace, peace, but the war has already begun.
[2:00:13.800 --> 2:00:15.800]  So may your chain sit lightly upon you.
[2:00:15.800 --> 2:00:17.800]  And I'm not going to lead to some military operation.
[2:00:17.800 --> 2:00:18.800]  I don't want violence.
[2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:19.800]  They're going to commit violence and blame it on us.
[2:00:19.800 --> 2:00:21.800]  I'm just saying they're assaulting us.
[2:00:21.800 --> 2:00:22.800]  They are killing us.
[2:00:22.800 --> 2:00:23.800]  They are murdering us.
[2:00:23.800 --> 2:00:25.800]  They know damn well what they're doing.
[2:00:25.800 --> 2:00:28.800]  It's come out over the year and a half ago that the ventilators are what killed people.
[2:00:28.800 --> 2:00:32.800]  They get $53,000 to take healthy people and murder their asses.
[2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:35.800]  And almost all the deaths are in certain city run hospital clusters.
[2:00:35.800 --> 2:00:36.800]  I said, let me guess.
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:38.800]  Do you go to a city at Run Hospital?
[2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:39.800]  That where they sent them?
[2:00:39.800 --> 2:00:40.800]  Yeah.
[2:00:40.800 --> 2:00:44.800]  I said, investigate a referral from the clinic he went to.
[2:00:44.800 --> 2:00:49.800]  And I bet you that they gave a referral when somebody has a sore throat to send them to be murdered.
[2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:53.800]  They think they're going to get medical care, but instead they're going to get killed because there's a...
[2:00:56.800 --> 2:00:57.800]  Jacob in Ohio.
[2:00:57.800 --> 2:00:58.800]  Welcome.
[2:00:58.800 --> 2:00:59.800]  Go ahead.
[2:00:59.800 --> 2:01:00.800]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:01:00.800 --> 2:01:01.800]  Good job.
[2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:02.800]  Great last caller.
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:04.800]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[2:01:04.800 --> 2:01:10.800]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity.
[2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:12.800]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:13.800]  All right.
[2:01:13.800 --> 2:01:14.800]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:15.800]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:16.800]  Go ahead.
[2:01:16.800 --> 2:01:17.800]  Hey, Alex.
[2:01:17.800 --> 2:01:18.800]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:20.800]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the product.
[2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:21.800]  The X2 does wonders.
[2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:22.800]  They recommend it to everybody.
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:23.800]  You're on the fence about it.
[2:01:23.800 --> 2:01:24.800]  Get off the fence.
[2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:25.800]  Get the product.
[2:01:25.800 --> 2:01:26.800]  Support the info ward.
[2:01:26.800 --> 2:01:27.800]  Tyler in Maine.
[2:01:27.800 --> 2:01:28.800]  You're on the year.
[2:01:28.800 --> 2:01:29.800]  Thanks for holding.
[2:01:29.800 --> 2:01:30.800]  Go ahead.
[2:01:30.800 --> 2:01:31.800]  Hey, Alex.
[2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:32.800]  It's great to be on with you.
[2:01:32.800 --> 2:01:33.800]  It's an honor.
[2:01:33.800 --> 2:01:39.800]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[2:01:39.800 --> 2:01:41.800]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[2:01:41.800 --> 2:01:42.800]  All right.
[2:01:42.800 --> 2:01:43.800]  It helps in the bedroom.
[2:01:43.800 --> 2:01:45.800]  So, just number one for a few years.
[2:01:45.800 --> 2:01:46.800]  Well, it definitely works.
[2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:47.800]  It's not a joke.
[2:01:47.800 --> 2:01:48.800]  Yeah.
[2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:49.800]  Absolutely.
[2:01:49.800 --> 2:02:04.800]  What an epic time to be alive.
[2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:08.800]  A human revolution for freedom is inevitable.
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:12.800]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:14.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:02:14.800 --> 2:02:17.800]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:02:17.800 --> 2:02:20.800]  Owen Troyer in studio, Alex Jones on the line.
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:27.800]  And we've been highlighting this last week and beyond how in Italy, in France, in Tunisia,
[2:02:27.800 --> 2:02:33.800]  all across the planet, humans are standing up saying we want to be free.
[2:02:33.800 --> 2:02:35.800]  We're sick of your COVID tyranny.
[2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:37.800]  We know this was a bio weapon launched against us.
[2:02:37.800 --> 2:02:39.800]  We know that the vaccine is killing people.
[2:02:39.800 --> 2:02:41.800]  You're not going to lock us down.
[2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:42.800]  You're not going to enslave us.
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:45.800]  And you're seeing mass demonstrations happening worldwide.
[2:02:45.800 --> 2:02:50.800]  America's almost kind of behind on this one, but maybe finally starting to grow its legs.
[2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:55.800]  And Alex, we now have new footage out of the parliament in Italy, apparently just
[2:02:55.800 --> 2:03:01.800]  descending into total chaos as they're discussing mandatory vaccines and vaccine passes.
[2:03:01.800 --> 2:03:05.800]  And just the whole thing gets overwhelmed and overrun.
[2:03:05.800 --> 2:03:08.800]  And this is just the inevitable future.
[2:03:08.800 --> 2:03:12.800]  Humans are not designed to be governed or enslaved.
[2:03:12.800 --> 2:03:18.800]  And ultimately that will not be our fate, Alex Jones.
[2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:23.800]  All going under bondage worldwide, these evil corporations have wrapped themselves in Black Lives Matter
[2:03:23.800 --> 2:03:28.800]  while they're the ones literally murdering Africa with a shutdown on what's happening.
[2:03:28.800 --> 2:03:35.800]  And again, the UN and Klaus Schwab and the Davos group and Bill Gates and the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:03:35.800 --> 2:03:41.800]  all publicly are directing worldwide that they got to put an experimental substance in our body,
[2:03:41.800 --> 2:03:46.800]  which we now know doesn't protect us, makes us sicker, kills people.
[2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:50.800]  And then they say, you're not going to get food and you're not going to have a job
[2:03:50.800 --> 2:03:51.800]  and you're not going to leave your house.
[2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:54.800]  That's been said by more than a dozen world leaders.
[2:03:54.800 --> 2:03:57.800]  It's been said by all the top Democrats.
[2:03:57.800 --> 2:03:59.800]  It's been said all over the channels.
[2:03:59.800 --> 2:04:03.800]  And you sit there imagining a science fiction movie 30 years ago where in the future
[2:04:03.800 --> 2:04:05.800]  they use the fear of virus to lock things down.
[2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:10.800]  If you don't take the experimental shot, which they admit doesn't work, you then don't get food.
[2:04:10.800 --> 2:04:16.800]  This is what the Coistered Ivory Tower leftists are doing.
[2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:21.800]  And they've got their frontman, Don Lemon, declaring serious siege.
[2:04:21.800 --> 2:04:24.800]  The most ancient form of total war is siege.
[2:04:24.800 --> 2:04:26.800]  This is siege.
[2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:29.800]  And they're saying, take the shot and we will release the siege.
[2:04:29.800 --> 2:04:32.800]  But then the morons that took the shot were, oh, guess what?
[2:04:32.800 --> 2:04:34.800]  You're a super spreader now.
[2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:35.800]  You got a special virus.
[2:04:35.800 --> 2:04:36.800]  It's not a virus.
[2:04:36.800 --> 2:04:39.800]  It's a protein crystal.
[2:04:39.800 --> 2:04:40.800]  The studies are coming out.
[2:04:40.800 --> 2:04:43.800]  The autopsies are coming out confirming everything.
[2:04:43.800 --> 2:04:48.800]  And listen, I'm so sorry to folks that got bamboo's older, got pushed into doing this.
[2:04:48.800 --> 2:04:49.800]  And I'm not judging.
[2:04:49.800 --> 2:04:50.800]  I'm not blaming you.
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:55.800]  And a lot of top scientists have come out and said massive doses of vitamin C, vitamin D,
[2:04:55.800 --> 2:05:01.800]  a ton of water, sunlight, jacking up your immune system, purifying your body.
[2:05:01.800 --> 2:05:04.800]  And then hopefully the prion crystals won't keep growing.
[2:05:04.800 --> 2:05:07.800]  But the studies are clear now.
[2:05:07.800 --> 2:05:10.800]  When you take three of these shots, they never go away.
[2:05:10.800 --> 2:05:12.800]  And that's really what Gates already had planned.
[2:05:12.800 --> 2:05:13.800]  They knew this from the rodent studies.
[2:05:13.800 --> 2:05:16.800]  They need that third shot to get an even higher kill rate.
[2:05:16.800 --> 2:05:19.800]  Oh, there's another huge article we'll cover next segment.
[2:05:19.800 --> 2:05:22.800]  Something I meant to say, something I've mentioned only a few times.
[2:05:22.800 --> 2:05:27.800]  It's so important why they're so desperate with half the public in the United States
[2:05:27.800 --> 2:05:29.800]  not taking the deadly shot.
[2:05:29.800 --> 2:05:34.800]  And that's because it's going to be so clear, as we know, with these Pfizer and Moderna shots,
[2:05:34.800 --> 2:05:36.800]  it goes and basically destroys the ovaries.
[2:05:36.800 --> 2:05:39.800]  It's confirmed that these women will never have children again.
[2:05:39.800 --> 2:05:43.800]  What are they going to do when you have a giant control group of the other half of the women
[2:05:43.800 --> 2:05:45.800]  who can all have children still?
[2:05:45.800 --> 2:05:48.800]  See, that's why you've got to then sterilize basically everybody.
[2:05:48.800 --> 2:05:50.800]  Then they'll claim it's something else.
[2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:52.800]  Oh, sperm counts are down 90% worldwide.
[2:05:52.800 --> 2:05:55.800]  By 2045, everyone will be sterile.
[2:05:55.800 --> 2:05:56.800]  That's official.
[2:05:56.800 --> 2:05:57.800]  They don't tell you how they're doing it.
[2:05:57.800 --> 2:05:58.800]  Well, we do.
[2:05:58.800 --> 2:06:01.800]  So it's the same thing.
[2:06:01.800 --> 2:06:03.800]  These women are going to be sterilized.
[2:06:03.800 --> 2:06:05.800]  They are sterilized.
[2:06:05.800 --> 2:06:07.800]  Human fertility is an amazing thing.
[2:06:07.800 --> 2:06:09.800]  But it's being massively reduced.
[2:06:09.800 --> 2:06:11.800]  And I mean, this is just total war.
[2:06:11.800 --> 2:06:14.800]  And they expect us to never wake up to the war.
[2:06:14.800 --> 2:06:17.800]  But see, we're waking up up front early in the game.
[2:06:17.800 --> 2:06:19.800]  And that's why they're so panic.
[2:06:19.800 --> 2:06:21.800]  But here's Don Lemon again, folks.
[2:06:21.800 --> 2:06:25.800]  This is the talking point declaring war on you and your family saying,
[2:06:25.800 --> 2:06:27.800]  Imagine growing up in Cuba.
[2:06:27.800 --> 2:06:30.800]  Cuba says, if you don't take a shot, you can't leave your house and go to the grocery store.
[2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:31.800]  Or North Korea.
[2:06:31.800 --> 2:06:34.800]  This is North Korea level stuff.
[2:06:34.800 --> 2:06:36.800]  And again, if you take the ID he's talking about,
[2:06:36.800 --> 2:06:37.800]  that's what the shot is.
[2:06:37.800 --> 2:06:38.800]  It's a digital ID.
[2:06:38.800 --> 2:06:43.800]  If you start using your ID pass, which is digital, then they've got you
[2:06:43.800 --> 2:06:45.800]  and can keep you from going to the grocery store.
[2:06:45.800 --> 2:06:48.800]  So people think, oh, I'll submit so I get food.
[2:06:48.800 --> 2:06:49.800]  No, no, no, no.
[2:06:49.800 --> 2:06:50.800]  You submit.
[2:06:50.800 --> 2:06:51.800]  Then you don't get the food.
[2:06:51.800 --> 2:06:52.800]  You take the shot.
[2:06:52.800 --> 2:06:53.800]  Then you die.
[2:06:53.800 --> 2:06:54.800]  You get sick.
[2:06:54.800 --> 2:06:55.800]  You see, oh, you take the shot.
[2:06:55.800 --> 2:06:56.800]  Now you're a super spro.
[2:06:56.800 --> 2:06:57.800]  Because you're the fool.
[2:06:57.800 --> 2:06:58.800]  You're the sucker.
[2:06:58.800 --> 2:06:59.800]  This is a trap.
[2:06:59.800 --> 2:07:02.800]  These people are the most wicked evil people the planet's ever seen.
[2:07:02.800 --> 2:07:03.800]  They turn logic on its head.
[2:07:03.800 --> 2:07:04.800]  They invert everything.
[2:07:04.800 --> 2:07:06.800]  This is pure Satanism you're witnessing.
[2:07:06.800 --> 2:07:08.800]  This is a pure satanic war.
[2:07:08.800 --> 2:07:10.800]  In the past, you know, the wars were human.
[2:07:10.800 --> 2:07:12.800]  It had satanic influences, but it was human wars.
[2:07:12.800 --> 2:07:16.800]  That's why you saw passions and honor and betrayal.
[2:07:16.800 --> 2:07:18.800]  And you saw chivalry and unshivalrous acts.
[2:07:18.800 --> 2:07:19.800]  Those were human wars.
[2:07:19.800 --> 2:07:23.800]  This is a modern satanic war out of the mind of Satan.
[2:07:23.800 --> 2:07:25.800]  They can only be carried out through big time media,
[2:07:25.800 --> 2:07:28.800]  through domesticated populations and through brainwashing.
[2:07:28.800 --> 2:07:32.800]  So you're seeing the leading edge of future war of alien warfare
[2:07:32.800 --> 2:07:33.800]  against the planet.
[2:07:33.800 --> 2:07:35.800]  That's what this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:07:35.800 --> 2:07:37.800]  This is alien, fallen one, alien attack,
[2:07:37.800 --> 2:07:38.800]  through people that work with it.
[2:07:38.800 --> 2:07:42.800]  And they've been operating again in the fourth, third,
[2:07:42.800 --> 2:07:43.800]  and second dimension.
[2:07:43.800 --> 2:07:46.800]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, they're operating fully physically
[2:07:46.800 --> 2:07:49.800]  through a new artificial silicon overlay
[2:07:49.800 --> 2:07:52.800]  that is the artificial omnipresence control system
[2:07:52.800 --> 2:07:54.800]  so that Satan can have a limited omnipresence
[2:07:54.800 --> 2:07:56.800]  and now carry out his final assault on humanity.
[2:07:56.800 --> 2:08:01.800]  Let's go ahead and apply the satanic announcement by CNN.
[2:08:01.800 --> 2:08:02.800]  I don't know.
[2:08:02.800 --> 2:08:04.800]  I'm sure a lot of people are not going to agree with this,
[2:08:04.800 --> 2:08:07.800]  but don't get the vaccine.
[2:08:07.800 --> 2:08:09.800]  You can't go to the supermarket.
[2:08:09.800 --> 2:08:10.800]  Don't have the vaccine.
[2:08:10.800 --> 2:08:11.800]  You don't show it.
[2:08:11.800 --> 2:08:12.800]  Can't go to the ball game.
[2:08:12.800 --> 2:08:13.800]  Don't have the vaccine.
[2:08:13.800 --> 2:08:14.800]  Can't go to work.
[2:08:14.800 --> 2:08:16.800]  You don't have the vaccine.
[2:08:16.800 --> 2:08:17.800]  Can't come here.
[2:08:17.800 --> 2:08:19.800]  No shirt, no shoes, no service.
[2:08:19.800 --> 2:08:21.800]  That's what I think we should be right now
[2:08:21.800 --> 2:08:23.800]  because we continue to waste our breath
[2:08:23.800 --> 2:08:26.800]  on people who are just not going to change.
[2:08:26.800 --> 2:08:28.800]  They're, you know, circular logic.
[2:08:28.800 --> 2:08:29.800]  They just keep going back and saying,
[2:08:29.800 --> 2:08:31.800]  well, it's my freedom.
[2:08:31.800 --> 2:08:32.800]  It's whatever.
[2:08:32.800 --> 2:08:33.800]  I'm free.
[2:08:33.800 --> 2:08:35.800]  Well, you're free to give other kids.
[2:08:35.800 --> 2:08:36.800]  That's tough.
[2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:39.800]  So notice, folks, he never gives any statistics or facts
[2:08:39.800 --> 2:08:41.800]  or studies or data points like we did.
[2:08:41.800 --> 2:08:43.800]  He just lies, lies, lies like a CDC.
[2:08:43.800 --> 2:08:46.800]  Oh, it's your fault that you didn't take the shots.
[2:08:46.800 --> 2:08:49.800]  So now we've got vaccinated super spreaders.
[2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:50.800]  So what's the logic?
[2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:51.800]  Show us the data.
[2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:52.800]  Oh, sorry.
[2:08:52.800 --> 2:08:53.800]  You can't see that data.
[2:08:53.800 --> 2:08:56.800]  Just like Fauci goes, oh, there's nasal titer test.
[2:08:56.800 --> 2:08:57.800]  I go look that up.
[2:08:57.800 --> 2:08:58.800]  None of it's true.
[2:08:58.800 --> 2:08:59.800]  But what is true?
[2:08:59.800 --> 2:09:01.800]  Scientists all over the world are doing D dimer tests.
[2:09:01.800 --> 2:09:03.800]  One of the most respected tests ever.
[2:09:03.800 --> 2:09:04.800]  62%.
[2:09:04.800 --> 2:09:05.800]  But it's the same number in Australia.
[2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:06.800]  Same number in Europe.
[2:09:06.800 --> 2:09:07.800]  Same number here.
[2:09:07.800 --> 2:09:08.800]  It's between 60 and 70%.
[2:09:08.800 --> 2:09:13.800]  But usually about 60% have D dimer, meaning they're positive,
[2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:15.800]  meaning they have blood clots.
[2:09:15.800 --> 2:09:18.800]  And so now there are people doing their own private trials.
[2:09:18.800 --> 2:09:19.800]  It's going to break in the news soon.
[2:09:19.800 --> 2:09:22.800]  Whereas human volunteers who want to expose this are taking
[2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:24.800]  D dimers before and D dimers after.
[2:09:24.800 --> 2:09:25.800]  And that's there.
[2:09:25.800 --> 2:09:27.800]  So we got to the committed people out there to stop this.
[2:09:27.800 --> 2:09:30.800]  I mean, oh, and this is total frickin' war.
[2:09:30.800 --> 2:09:32.800]  So it's totally normal that you get upset.
[2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:33.800]  I want to play another clip.
[2:09:33.800 --> 2:09:35.800]  I want to say it last segment.
[2:09:35.800 --> 2:09:36.800]  It's time to get upset.
[2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:37.800]  It's time to get angry.
[2:09:37.800 --> 2:09:39.800]  It's time to call these criminals out.
[2:09:39.800 --> 2:09:43.800]  Everywhere they go at local TV stations, local radio stations.
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:46.800]  A doctor goes on TV and lies and says a bunch of bull.
[2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:48.800]  Go to their office peacefully bullhorn them.
[2:09:48.800 --> 2:09:51.800]  They try to make kids wear masks at the local school.
[2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:52.800]  Go bullhorn.
[2:09:52.800 --> 2:09:53.800]  Go to the PTA.
[2:09:53.800 --> 2:09:54.800]  Get aggressive.
[2:09:54.800 --> 2:09:55.800]  Expose these people.
[2:09:55.800 --> 2:09:59.800]  But here's Congressman Ciproy from Texas will play with the intro
[2:09:59.800 --> 2:10:01.800]  with Tucker Carlson laying out exactly what's happening.
[2:10:01.800 --> 2:10:03.800]  And this is the type of action we need.
[2:10:03.800 --> 2:10:04.800]  Quit towering.
[2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:06.800]  Quit playing along with their narrative.
[2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:09.800]  Call the whole narrative out what it is as a damn lie.
[2:10:09.800 --> 2:10:10.800]  Ask.
[2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:13.800]  No one's pausing to ask questions at this moment, though.
[2:10:13.800 --> 2:10:14.800]  That's not allowed.
[2:10:14.800 --> 2:10:16.800]  Nancy Pelosi definitely won't allow it.
[2:10:16.800 --> 2:10:18.800]  You're anti-vaxxer if you ask those questions.
[2:10:18.800 --> 2:10:19.800]  Do masks work?
[2:10:19.800 --> 2:10:20.800]  She doesn't care.
[2:10:20.800 --> 2:10:23.800]  Pelosi is threatening to punish any member of Congress who doesn't
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:25.800]  wear a mask on the House court and most obey.
[2:10:25.800 --> 2:10:27.800]  Watch this.
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:30.800]  Members are reminded that under House resolution 38,
[2:10:30.800 --> 2:10:34.800]  the sergeant arms is authorized and directed to impose a fine
[2:10:34.800 --> 2:10:39.800]  against any member acting in violation of this policy.
[2:10:39.800 --> 2:10:43.800]  Oh, Nancy Pelosi is going to fine you if you don't pretend that it's
[2:10:43.800 --> 2:10:46.800]  science when it's clearly just a form of social control.
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:48.800]  Most Republicans went along with us.
[2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:49.800]  Not all of them did, though.
[2:10:49.800 --> 2:10:51.800]  Ciproy, a member of Congress from Texas,
[2:10:51.800 --> 2:10:53.800]  just delivered remarks against it.
[2:10:53.800 --> 2:10:56.800]  Here's part of what Ciproy said.
[2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:00.800]  We have a crisis at our border, and we're playing footsie with
[2:11:00.800 --> 2:11:03.800]  mask mandates in the people's house.
[2:11:03.800 --> 2:11:06.800]  I mean, it's absolutely absurd what this body is doing,
[2:11:06.800 --> 2:11:07.800]  the people's house.
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:08.800]  It's an embarrassment.
[2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:09.800]  It's a mockery.
[2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:12.800]  And the American people are fed up.
[2:11:12.800 --> 2:11:13.800]  They want to go back to life.
[2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:14.800]  They want to go back to business.
[2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:16.800]  They want to go back to school without their children being
[2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:19.800]  forced to wear masks to be put in the corner and have mental
[2:11:19.800 --> 2:11:20.800]  health issues.
[2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:22.800]  And the speaker comes down here at 10 o'clock in the morning
[2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:26.800]  saying, we got to wear masks in the people's house while we've
[2:11:26.800 --> 2:11:28.800]  got thousands of people pouring across our border,
[2:11:28.800 --> 2:11:30.800]  and Democrats don't do a darn thing about it.
[2:11:30.800 --> 2:11:32.800]  We are absolutely sick and tired of it.
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:34.800]  And so are the American people.
[2:11:34.800 --> 2:11:37.800]  This sham of an institution is doing nothing for the American
[2:11:37.800 --> 2:11:40.800]  people, nothing for the betterment of the people that send
[2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:43.800]  their representatives here.
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:44.800]  Why didn't they all say that?
[2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:45.800]  Hard to know, but Ciproy did.
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:47.800]  Congressman Ciproy joins us now.
[2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:49.800]  Congressman, thanks so much.
[2:11:49.800 --> 2:11:50.800]  God, that's good.
[2:11:50.800 --> 2:11:51.800]  Oh, and I know you've got a lot to worry about.
[2:11:51.800 --> 2:11:54.800]  Yeah, yeah, we'll be right back, Alex.
[2:11:54.800 --> 2:11:56.800]  Your voice counts.
[2:11:56.800 --> 2:12:00.800]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person,
[2:12:00.800 --> 2:12:01.800]  it changes the world.
[2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:04.800]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:12:04.800 --> 2:12:05.800]  They know you're angry.

[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:18.800]  2 years that almost killed me.
[2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:20.800]  Living Defense brought me back.
[2:13:20.800 --> 2:13:25.800]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:28.800]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:36.400]  deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:42.720]  name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[2:13:42.720 --> 2:13:47.200]  That's right where we're at brother. And that's because God's name is on the founding of this
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:52.000]  country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[2:13:53.280 --> 2:13:58.720]  As we predicted the globalists are now launching a new lockdown. The first one has already destroyed
[2:13:58.720 --> 2:14:03.200]  the third world already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death and it's caused
[2:14:03.200 --> 2:14:08.240]  massive supply chain problems across the western world. Ladies and gentlemen now is the time for

[2:15:10.160 --> 2:15:17.040]  Well Americans are starting to connect the dots of the New World Order and the corrupt globalist
[2:15:17.040 --> 2:15:24.320]  empire and they're realizing once they've connected the dots the image is total imprisonment worldwide
[2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:30.320]  no more human freedom and you know there's a couple dots that are pretty obvious to be connected some
[2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:37.360]  are some are a little less obvious for example when they're bringing in 5 million 10 million
[2:15:37.360 --> 2:15:41.360]  illegal immigrants across the southern border and then the New York Times publishes a story
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:46.880]  last night there is no good reason why you should have to be a citizen to vote they're telling you
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:50.880]  you don't get an election anymore you don't get a country anymore and then Alex maybe the more
[2:15:50.880 --> 2:15:57.520]  nuanced one that I haven't heard anybody talk about and and I just even realized it this morning
[2:15:57.520 --> 2:16:06.160]  it seems so obvious now but we knew that the DC police were involved in January 6th because
[2:16:06.160 --> 2:16:12.000]  they stood down and they opened the doors to let people in how did we not see this before though
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:17.760]  when you have all those uh those police officers come forward and lie about what happened on January
[2:16:17.760 --> 2:16:24.480]  6th that's the final proof they were clearly in on it all those police officers working with Pelosi
[2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:30.720]  wearing the BLM shirts wearing the pride shirts hating Trump celebrating the the riots happening
[2:16:30.720 --> 2:16:36.720]  in Kenosha in Minneapolis and then they get on the stand and they lie about January 6th of course
[2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:41.840]  they were involved of course they were involved in the stand down of course Pelosi and Mayor Muriel
[2:16:41.840 --> 2:16:47.280]  Bowser stood down so they could have this event it's also obvious how did we miss it Alex as
[2:16:47.280 --> 2:16:52.480]  soon as those officers sat down and testified against America that should have been case closed
[2:16:52.480 --> 2:16:59.040]  they organized the whole thing and again the rank and file we know as you know you've been in that
[2:16:59.040 --> 2:17:04.320]  jail so surprised for literally peacefully protesting silently we know their entire
[2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:09.840]  background it's diffuse select people in charge were operatives Trump asked for the National Guard
[2:17:09.840 --> 2:17:13.760]  he was denied by DC he could have overridden it but didn't because Millie told him that would
[2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:18.960]  look like a police state remember that Millie and Honoree ran the whole thing as best back and
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:25.680]  understand Millie ran it from the White House Honoree ran it from the outside and they need
[2:17:25.680 --> 2:17:30.400]  to be indicted I mean it's that simple they they they provocateur they had provocateurs out of a
[2:17:30.400 --> 2:17:35.680]  million people they got maybe a hundred to attack they got about 500 to go in and now they're branding
[2:17:35.680 --> 2:17:42.640]  us as terrorists but pulling back from this I just want to reiterate just the listeners when you
[2:17:42.640 --> 2:17:47.680]  hear on the news Americans are bad Americans are evil they're stupid they won't take the
[2:17:47.680 --> 2:17:54.160]  shots Saudi Arabia is not a great job India is not a great job all this crap it's not even true
[2:17:54.160 --> 2:18:01.360]  from their position India is less than 10% Saudi Arabia is less than 20% they're refusing and so
[2:18:01.360 --> 2:18:04.800]  yeah I'm glad that half of America has refused okay I think the numbers a little bit higher
[2:18:04.800 --> 2:18:08.400]  they've been lying on those numbers too numbers I've got is less than 40% that's why they're so
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:12.640]  pissed and so they're just totally panicking I can tell you none of the halloween people are
[2:18:12.640 --> 2:18:16.880]  taking the shots I can tell you none of those democrats at the White House are taking but
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:21.600]  they're not stupid okay this is all I mean how many world leaders got the shot and it was fake
[2:18:21.600 --> 2:18:26.640]  when they took it and they think we're so dumb they even do a good job of giving them the fake shot
[2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:33.120]  to Benjamin yet yada and all this other stuff this is garbage they the higher ups the global
[2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:37.360]  is to control the planet would have paid about these politicians and have spent decades repairing
[2:18:37.360 --> 2:18:41.920]  the great reset they believe they're saving the earth by depopulating and we know that these so
[2:18:41.920 --> 2:18:48.880]  called shots these so-called vaccines reduce fertility and grow protein crystals prions
[2:18:48.880 --> 2:18:54.560]  in the body period and yes they're transmissible and people that have taken the shots their entire
[2:18:54.560 --> 2:18:58.640]  body some it works on some it doesn't thank god humans are so powerful humans aren't
[2:19:00.080 --> 2:19:06.000]  I mean they'll tell you they study chemicals and agents on rats and pigs because they're the closest
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:11.600]  for whatever reason not even genetically but closest in response in most cases to rats and
[2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:16.800]  pigs okay rats are tough pigs are tough everybody knows humans are tough you give rats a lot of
[2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:21.200]  poise you get pigs a lot of poise they won't die I think with humans I mean we can take more poison
[2:19:21.200 --> 2:19:25.520]  and more stuff than most people I mean most animals and things can't we are tough as nails okay folks
[2:19:25.520 --> 2:19:29.600]  that's how we can drink you know huge amounts of alcohol and take all these drugs and not die
[2:19:29.600 --> 2:19:34.400]  and so they got to come up with a super weapon here so yeah it killed the rodents in most cases
[2:19:34.400 --> 2:19:37.920]  it killed all the pharaohs because they're all soup company high end you know stuff that'll kill
[2:19:37.920 --> 2:19:42.880]  it you know I mean a dog dies and eats chocolate folks we we love it so again we're tough but
[2:19:42.880 --> 2:19:47.920]  uh the estimates are from what we're doing and scanning all this info is it looks like
[2:19:48.720 --> 2:19:53.600]  30% of the people within five years are going to be dead that have taken this and that's a
[2:19:53.600 --> 2:19:58.640]  conservative estimate so again folks if you think things are bad now I'm not being pessimistic I'm
[2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:04.880]  not being negative it's like I've used this analogy uh you're 10 miles down the uh river from a huge
[2:20:04.880 --> 2:20:09.360]  dam and you learn terrorists just blew the dam up and the radio comes on and says the dam has
[2:20:09.360 --> 2:20:15.280]  broken everyone get to high ground now uh it'll you only have minutes if you're in the town of such
[2:20:15.280 --> 2:20:20.000]  and such it's the same deal they blew the dam it's broke folks it's coming okay I mean I'm not I've
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:24.240]  never lied to you I'm hardly ever wrong there's not much we can do to turn this back now they have
[2:20:24.240 --> 2:20:30.320]  put into motion devastation they have pulled the trigger on the level equivalent to nuclear war
[2:20:31.200 --> 2:20:35.520]  they are collapsing civilization now out of this collapse we're going to end up probably
[2:20:35.520 --> 2:20:38.640]  being able to arrest these people bring them to justice and you know stop their world government
[2:20:38.640 --> 2:20:42.160]  move and that's what the bible says is going to happen but they're going to have power for a short
[2:20:42.160 --> 2:20:47.920]  period of time and and so I'm not trying to scare people I'm just telling you almost all the rats
[2:20:47.920 --> 2:20:52.800]  died all the ferrets died they did specific studies thoughts you paid for with these exact same
[2:20:52.800 --> 2:20:56.880]  vaccines under other names university of texas I just keep hammering I've got hundreds of news
[2:20:56.880 --> 2:21:00.240]  articles hundreds of videos to cover it's all super interesting but I'm just going to keep
[2:21:00.240 --> 2:21:05.200]  hammering illicitory do you understand it kills almost all the rats all the ferrets do you
[2:21:05.200 --> 2:21:08.720]  understand it kills them do you understand that they don't purpose do you understand they're
[2:21:08.720 --> 2:21:12.000]  trying to murder you do you and I just keep hammering this because it's hard for me to believe
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:17.760]  too I can't but it's real Bill Gates and all these people did not take over the planet and
[2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:21.680]  say they want to be populated for nothing they're doing it and they're proud of it so what everyone
[2:21:21.680 --> 2:21:26.160]  listening is going to lose their job their home their children all you that submit are going to
[2:21:26.160 --> 2:21:29.440]  be first in line for destruction as you're now seeing what the vaccinated being treated like
[2:21:29.440 --> 2:21:34.480]  crap so I'm just telling you have nothing to gain by serving these people you have everything to gain
[2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:38.160]  by giving your life to Christ waking up and realizing you're living in the end time so and
[2:21:39.600 --> 2:21:47.520]  well and you watch the videos the crew is rolling of the vaccine injectors showing up in these Indian
[2:21:47.520 --> 2:21:52.240]  villages and they literally get attacked and then they get beaten and bloodied with sticks
[2:21:52.240 --> 2:21:58.640]  that's the proper response somebody shows up to murder you you you fight back you don't take it
[2:21:58.640 --> 2:22:04.000]  somebody shows up to you know rape your wife or kidnap your kids no you you stand up you you
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:08.960]  beat the living hell out of them that's absolutely the proper response somebody shows up to give you
[2:22:08.960 --> 2:22:15.840]  a deadly forced injection you fight back you stand up for yourself hey I don't want to see the world
[2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:20.720]  turned into total chaos that's the last thing I want to see I like life I thank god for creating
[2:22:20.720 --> 2:22:28.400]  this incredible consciousness and experience but I mean again somebody shows up to rob you or rape
[2:22:28.400 --> 2:22:34.160]  your wife or kidnap your kids or give you a deadly vaccine damn right you're going to be pissed
[2:22:34.160 --> 2:22:37.920]  damn right you're going to bludgeon the hell out of that individual and so that's why you're
[2:22:37.920 --> 2:22:41.760]  seeing these images coming out of the Indian villages because they've seen it too many times
[2:22:41.760 --> 2:22:46.800]  they've seen Bill Gates people show up inject a thousand people in a African village and then
[2:22:46.800 --> 2:22:52.640]  half the village dies a week later so so now the same thing happens in African villages the Bill
[2:22:52.640 --> 2:22:58.320]  Gates white lab coats show up in African villages and they get chased out with sticks and torches
[2:22:58.320 --> 2:23:03.440]  because they're like you're not killing us again so we got to learn from this history Alex we have
[2:23:03.440 --> 2:23:09.520]  to have human instincts again well that's right when we come back I want to play some clips Dr
[2:23:09.520 --> 2:23:15.520]  David Martin the inventor of MRNA absolutely lays out the facts that this is the autoimmune response
[2:23:15.520 --> 2:23:24.240]  uh the after you've had the vaccine it makes you get sick now uh and basically die and he he talks
[2:23:24.240 --> 2:23:30.640]  about that he talks about I was predicted and then I've got Dr David uh Barna the guy from
[2:23:31.680 --> 2:23:36.800]  Pfizer who again said a few weeks ago the same thing he's the head of the UK program
[2:23:37.600 --> 2:23:43.200]  that is studying everyone that's been injected and he says oh it's incredible you lose your
[2:23:43.200 --> 2:23:48.400]  immunity to these viruses within just a few months and all the other viruses so again they admit it
[2:23:48.400 --> 2:23:55.680]  removes your damn immunity from regular stuff I mean that's what AIDS is folks hey your voice
[2:23:55.680 --> 2:24:01.840]  counts when you share information be it over the internet or in person it changes the world
[2:24:01.840 --> 2:24:07.440]  the globalists know their agenda is unpopular they know you're angry and now to get around big tech
[2:24:07.440 --> 2:24:12.720]  it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got so ladies and gentlemen if you sign
[2:24:12.720 --> 2:24:18.080]  up for our free news and show alerts you can then take those alerts those articles and those live
[2:24:18.080 --> 2:24:22.800]  feeds both the regular shows and special reports and share them with everyone you know take action

[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:59.920]  there's one central fact of criminal psychology the criminologists all agree on
[2:25:00.720 --> 2:25:06.400]  and that it's criminals are extremely pathological even more the general public they do the same
[2:25:06.400 --> 2:25:12.400]  things over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:21.760]  well guess what it was Anthony Fauci and eugenics's globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the
[2:25:21.760 --> 2:25:26.240]  mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and
[2:25:26.240 --> 2:25:31.120]  they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the
[2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:37.200]  T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders the problem for them was the viruses
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:42.720]  would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need to roll out the
[2:25:42.720 --> 2:25:48.000]  COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:51.760]  basically giving you the equivalent of HIV that's right ladies and gentlemen
[2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:58.240]  I am a very humble person but I'm also a bold person and so as bad as things are with the

[2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:19.840]  congress or even folks in hollywood or or or mainstream media or industry people are really
[2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:25.120]  really awakening the establishment they don't want to go along with the globalist but they're scared

[2:27:57.920 --> 2:28:17.120]  jones show ladies and gentlemen we are traveling at high velocity towards a tyrannical dystopian
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:27.520]  future the likes of which 1984 would rival and so earlier today we covered that the veirs website
[2:28:27.520 --> 2:28:32.080]  health and human services veirs website which is where you report vaccine adverse reactions
[2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:37.680]  and death and that number was going over 12 000 that's just the reported numbers and the website
[2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:44.400]  went down oh you can no longer see all the people dying from the COVID-19 vaccine you should be able
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:48.240]  to go download all the data and it would pop up on your computer in a spreadsheet and they had it
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:52.640]  all graphed out and it would show you open the spreadsheet and you just have tens of thousands
[2:28:52.640 --> 2:28:57.760]  of cases of guion beret and death and everything and it all said COVID-19 vaccine i've done it myself
[2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:04.560]  and you may remember a couple weeks ago we were showing you from the israel's health ministry
[2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:10.640]  they had their own table similar to the veirs report but it was more about COVID cases and it
[2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:16.880]  showed how the majority of all of their COVID cases in israel were fully vaccinated people
[2:29:16.880 --> 2:29:22.160]  and that chart is still going viral on the internet but just like they shut down the veirs website
[2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:28.480]  now the israel health ministry has removed those tables from the website so you can no longer see
[2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:33.680]  that all of the new COVID cases are from fully vaccinated people so they couldn't have that
[2:29:33.680 --> 2:29:40.080]  information out there alex that was too much so the ministry of truth right out of 1984 right out
[2:29:40.080 --> 2:29:45.520]  of brave new world has removed that data has deleted that from the internet because they
[2:29:45.520 --> 2:29:50.800]  can't have the people seeing that their deadly vaccines aren't stopping COVID that's right
[2:29:50.800 --> 2:29:54.160]  so let's start at the beginning on this because this point is incredibly important over the top
[2:29:54.160 --> 2:30:01.920]  report 1986 they passed the vaccine damage fund and they give widely protection to vaccine makers
[2:30:01.920 --> 2:30:07.040]  with the six vaccines they were pushing at that time now it's over 50 so now you call any drug or
[2:30:07.040 --> 2:30:13.200]  any injection remember anything called cyanide a a vaccine and they'll probably give that approval
[2:30:13.200 --> 2:30:17.520]  just get the cyanide just kill them right there and it's all legal it's all lawful according to
[2:30:17.520 --> 2:30:21.680]  their fraud of course can't look and say it was legal to kill people too it's not the case they get
[2:30:21.680 --> 2:30:26.000]  fast lawsuit and black people don't have rights it's a bunch of bulls but that's not even operating
[2:30:26.000 --> 2:30:33.440]  it so there was veirs very credible bylaw nurses and doctors are supposed to follow things on that
[2:30:33.440 --> 2:30:39.360]  the truth is most of the time they do it less than you know one out of a hundred times or so the
[2:30:39.360 --> 2:30:44.160]  the but most clinics don't want trouble they don't want to say at risk reactions they can come back
[2:30:44.160 --> 2:30:49.440]  on them with a liability so they estimate it's about one in 41 and 101 and 10 it it varies
[2:30:49.440 --> 2:30:53.440]  the studies but it's there's a lot more bad things happening that actually report it but
[2:30:53.440 --> 2:30:58.480]  overall it's a federal crime to report anything false on there the less gone on is jokes and you
[2:30:58.480 --> 2:31:03.360]  know said oh i took a shot and turned into an incredible hulk to discredit that because they
[2:31:03.360 --> 2:31:07.520]  worked for big tech and the globalists and big pharma they want to silence the slaves while they
[2:31:07.520 --> 2:31:11.600]  murder us and while they set up their world id and and while they tell us that we won't be able
[2:31:11.600 --> 2:31:15.680]  to go outside or have food or have our children we don't take their deadly shots i mean what a cult
[2:31:15.680 --> 2:31:22.240]  of sicko so the last district big tech all the rest of them would have been so upset about veirs i
[2:31:22.240 --> 2:31:26.080]  remember you saying this a few weeks ago i said it too i said how long until they take veirs now
[2:31:26.080 --> 2:31:30.720]  because they cannot have that vestigial thing there of oh how are you going to get liability
[2:31:30.720 --> 2:31:35.920]  protection for these companies if there isn't some place so there to be reports for the public
[2:31:35.920 --> 2:31:42.480]  to see so they created bears in the 1980s and they got it online by the 1990s uh and and now
[2:31:42.480 --> 2:31:47.120]  conveniently exactly in israel and here it's been taken down to listen when you read these john
[2:31:47.120 --> 2:31:51.760]  hoffman's white papers these rocket solar financial entrepreneurs they talk about once we implement
[2:31:51.760 --> 2:31:56.880]  this operation lockstep because the whole rocket solar plan now the rocket solar foundation is in
[2:31:56.880 --> 2:32:01.840]  charge of us policy they were always in charge you know since the 90s or so but now they're
[2:32:01.840 --> 2:32:06.160]  publicly in charge and they're the ones that gave the order to take that down you better believe it
[2:32:06.160 --> 2:32:10.160]  uh while they go in and change it or make it you know not as easy to get to or claim oh
[2:32:10.160 --> 2:32:14.720]  there were errors we found fraud definitely they want to get rid of that because they're in charge
[2:32:14.720 --> 2:32:20.080]  of depopulating us and giving us these diseases that'll take a long time to die and then they'll
[2:32:20.080 --> 2:32:24.640]  have the treatments to suck the money out of you while they kill you uh and so that's why that's so
[2:32:24.640 --> 2:32:28.640]  important because they're not just suppressing you on google and apple and twitter and everywhere
[2:32:28.640 --> 2:32:35.600]  else in facebook and instagram they're now doing it at the medical level and exactly what you said
[2:32:35.600 --> 2:32:40.960]  they didn't know what to do with the israelis own doctors and own people aren't bad it's people
[2:32:40.960 --> 2:32:45.360]  at the top that are bad just like here they're just like doctors here they care about people
[2:32:45.360 --> 2:32:49.840]  they're average scientists average doctors they reported the truth and they said the majority
[2:32:49.840 --> 2:32:54.240]  of new cases are in the vaccinated they're very serious cases the majority of folks dying have
[2:32:54.240 --> 2:32:58.880]  been vaccinated and so our media said that can't be true and falchi said it can't be true two weeks
[2:32:58.880 --> 2:33:04.400]  later they now admit okay it's true uh the vaccinated have to wear a mask and you're the
[2:33:04.400 --> 2:33:09.920]  main spreaders now because it was always their plan but they didn't want this out now they wanted
[2:33:09.920 --> 2:33:14.720]  this out in the fall and the winter come out a little bit early and they were going to blame it
[2:33:14.720 --> 2:33:19.040]  again on the unvaccinated but now because of good doctors and scientists all over the world
[2:33:19.040 --> 2:33:24.000]  getting out ahead of them they're having to respond to to having their data challenged up front
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:27.840]  instead of the last year and a half never even giving us down the only data they gave us was
[2:33:27.840 --> 2:33:36.960]  pcr which they said admitted was 94 false now they admit 100 false again with a pcr test you can
[2:33:36.960 --> 2:33:41.920]  turn it up and it will say a brick has covered it will say a goat has covered it will say that a
[2:33:41.920 --> 2:33:47.280]  glass marble has covered it will say thin air has covered it's a fraud just like 23 and me
[2:33:47.280 --> 2:33:53.360]  saying lizard spit is is uh you know an eastern european or something it's and i'm doing it myself
[2:33:53.360 --> 2:33:59.040]  but we're sending off my cat saliva sitting off my mom's dog saliva just to get again who started
[2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:04.880]  23 and me the criminal the anti-free speech monster pig that runs youtube but it's a woman oh it's a
[2:34:04.880 --> 2:34:09.600]  woman these are monsters if Hitler would have been a woman they would have won but they put women
[2:34:09.600 --> 2:34:14.480]  up as their fronts because we genetically don't think of a woman as a threat because 95 percent
[2:34:14.480 --> 2:34:19.120]  of violent crime is committed by men that's true but the psychologists use it against us and use
[2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:24.960]  women as the front because then we don't think it's a threat these are a new type of women so we
[2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:30.400]  have to understand folks these are satanically animated meat bags all right that are literally
[2:34:30.400 --> 2:34:34.480]  slaughtering you and your family all of its fraud they know it they sit around their board rooms and
[2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:42.320]  laugh bare pharmaceuticals came out 20 years ago knowingly for the decade got blood from one place
[2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:47.760]  in the world on purpose that had hepatitis and HIV in it and that was the prison system in
[2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:52.720]  Arkansas they would deliberately not test the blood so they had it shipped to Canada for Bayer
[2:34:52.720 --> 2:34:57.440]  they had it mixed in the factory rate and shipped out worldwide and it came out in the court cases
[2:34:58.080 --> 2:35:04.320]  that the CEOs of Bayer over the regions in France and in Australia said you can read the quotes
[2:35:04.960 --> 2:35:09.760]  in the board meetings they recorded this with stenographers so imagine they got like a court
[2:35:09.760 --> 2:35:16.560]  reporter in their board meetings saying there's too many hemophiliacs screw them when when their
[2:35:16.560 --> 2:35:21.760]  own people said hey you know there's hepatitis and HIV and all of these blood clotting drugs
[2:35:21.760 --> 2:35:28.560]  and they said good there's too many hemophiliacs these people want to murder you murder you so
[2:35:29.360 --> 2:35:33.760]  the Clintons were involved you say why would they do that they would let people with HIV
[2:35:33.760 --> 2:35:39.360]  give blood up to every week on purpose people said why that's so satanic exactly they wanted
[2:35:39.360 --> 2:35:45.200]  to do it that was a human sacrifice for the Clintons their god gives them power Satan
[2:35:45.200 --> 2:35:51.120]  gives them power when they kill innocent people and killing they estimate over a million hemophiliac
[2:35:51.120 --> 2:35:57.200]  children giving them hepatitis and HIV was a sacrament just like Ed Buck it turns out it was
[2:35:57.200 --> 2:36:01.600]  a religion to him to inject black men and bring them to death and then give them shots to bring
[2:36:01.600 --> 2:36:07.040]  them back of the anti-drug but but two black men still died and and he said it with skulls and
[2:36:07.040 --> 2:36:11.760]  candles and goat's heads that he was extracting their energy and he loved the power of injecting
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:16.080]  them and that's what this is for this cult making us wear masks taking their poison shots
[2:36:16.080 --> 2:36:22.000]  they are doing satanic rituals and when you realize they're extracting power that's why in Germany
[2:36:22.960 --> 2:36:27.680]  30,000 children just in one city given the pedophiles then it turned out it was all over
[2:36:27.680 --> 2:36:32.720]  the country at an industrial level millions and millions of people involved in it hundreds of
[2:36:32.720 --> 2:36:38.400]  thousands of children raped tortured and you read deeper in literature most of the time that it's
[2:36:38.400 --> 2:36:45.120]  described as satanic rituals in Catholic churches because again if you're a satanist the highest
[2:36:45.120 --> 2:36:51.280]  thing to do is not just rape a child but to do it in a church as part of blasphemy as that's what a
[2:36:51.280 --> 2:36:56.160]  black mass is is you do it in the church at night and so when people this doesn't make sense to you
[2:36:56.160 --> 2:37:00.800]  folks because you're not devil worshipers you're not pedophiles but as soon as you realize the
[2:37:00.800 --> 2:37:05.680]  enemy is literally satanic devil worshipers then it makes total sense and then you realize that's
[2:37:05.680 --> 2:37:11.040]  what they're doing ouchy is a high priest satanist folks he is literally murdering you lying to you
[2:37:11.040 --> 2:37:17.600]  he is a devil he is satan incarnate and and and he is he is mega killing just like he ran the whole
[2:37:17.600 --> 2:37:23.600]  hiv situation he goes i used to go in the bath houses in 79 new york with hiv started yeah he
[2:37:23.600 --> 2:37:30.080]  was involved in the program giving the gay men uh vaccination supposedly for all these diseases so
[2:37:30.080 --> 2:37:35.680]  they would spread it and guess where the first vectors were in new york city in the bath houses
[2:37:35.680 --> 2:37:39.920]  and that's where dr. Fauci was working he is literally the number one suspect of
[2:37:39.920 --> 2:37:45.600]  launching that bio attack now we begin to realize the magnitude of the individuals we're dealing
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:50.000]  with and i know folks this sounds over the top i cannot describe to you how truly evil these

[2:42:59.840 --> 2:43:04.400]  and and that's their goal they don't have a right to rule the earth they can be easily defeated we
[2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:08.640]  wake up to the evil and admit it's real but you have to admit the horror you have to admit the
[2:43:08.640 --> 2:43:13.600]  devil's real the devil's greatest trick as they say was get the world to think he didn't exist and so
[2:43:13.600 --> 2:43:20.640]  it's hard for me to admit this by my hair turned gray i have nightmares about it but you know god
[2:43:20.640 --> 2:43:24.400]  strengthens me and that's how we know exactly what's going to happen because we're not naive
[2:43:24.400 --> 2:43:29.120]  folks we understand the battle plan and those that serve evil are given over to great delusion
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:33.680]  these people serving satan are not in charge they're slaves they actually believe some of their own
[2:43:33.680 --> 2:43:39.200]  bs a lot of them actually do know it's bs but a lot of them are given over to a great delusion when
[2:43:39.200 --> 2:43:43.840]  you are not deluded and you really open yourself up to the truth into the real research you you get
[2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:50.000]  great detail and understanding of how the world works and then you get an incredible frustration
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:55.600]  that you want to warn people and you want to stop it so i want to show something right now of uh
[2:43:55.600 --> 2:44:00.240]  michael rapaport i was saying john rapaport that's the rapaport or not michael rapaport the hollywood
[2:44:00.240 --> 2:44:05.440]  guy who's always attacking me and attacking patriots and you know always saying we're full
[2:44:05.440 --> 2:44:11.680]  of bull and he calls me the worst person in the world and he just just says unspeakably horrible
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:17.840]  things about me but if you look at info wars dot com article that we can put on screen about john
[2:44:17.840 --> 2:44:30.720]  rapaport that's strange i'm i'm getting the feedback of my show i'll call you back all right
[2:44:30.720 --> 2:44:37.200]  we'll get reconnected there with alex and again he's going to go to the clip here of michael rapaport
[2:44:38.400 --> 2:44:47.280]  who got the vaccine told he was a hero he did it he got the vaccine and i mean to the guy's credit
[2:44:47.280 --> 2:44:53.040]  at least he's being honest about this situation and he sees the cdc saying yep vaccinated people
[2:44:53.040 --> 2:44:59.440]  are causing uh the spread they're causing the mutation maybe he even saw the data coming out of
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:05.760]  israel and singapore and other places where most of the cases of covet most the new hospitalized
[2:45:05.760 --> 2:45:11.040]  cases of covet are in fully vaccinated people so he's seeing this and he's saying wait a second i
[2:45:11.040 --> 2:45:19.840]  was lied to i was deceived i was tricked and that's an opening now that's an opening now for michael
[2:45:19.840 --> 2:45:24.880]  rapaport and and any others in a similar situation is him to say wait a second if i was lied to about
[2:45:24.880 --> 2:45:29.840]  this maybe i was lied to about everything else maybe i was lied to about january 6 maybe i was
[2:45:29.840 --> 2:45:35.440]  lied to about trump maybe i was lied to about the election you were you were you were duped you
[2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:41.680]  were fooled by all those big lies and maybe it's the big vaccine lie that finally gets him to wake
[2:45:41.680 --> 2:45:48.880]  up and see the truth uh we won't hold our breath but this is an opportunity for awakening and if
[2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:55.040]  you can awake um somebody who is as strong as a a brainwashed leftist for the establishment
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:46:00.480]  an establishment hack as michael rapaport well maybe maybe there's hope for others and so that's
[2:46:00.480 --> 2:46:07.600]  why this story is such an interesting one and you know that there's people out there who just
[2:46:07.600 --> 2:46:12.400]  who didn't even think twice about it they just they figure hey the u.s. government's good they're
[2:46:12.400 --> 2:46:16.800]  not going to try to hurt me they don't want to try to hurt me the media and people on television
[2:46:16.800 --> 2:46:21.440]  they don't want to see me get hurt and you know this vaccine this vaccine is not going to do
[2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:25.120]  anything other than just stop me from getting coveted so they just lined up and got it now
[2:46:25.120 --> 2:46:30.320]  they're seeing all the reports and now they're seeing all the reports that vaccinated people
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:36.720]  are causing mutations vaccinated people are causing spread and most of the new hospitalizations due
[2:46:36.720 --> 2:46:42.640]  to coveted are from vaccinated people so we are working on getting alex jones back on the line
[2:46:42.640 --> 2:46:47.760]  guys just let me know when he's ready to go but folks it's it's it's a miracle we're not even supposed
[2:46:47.760 --> 2:46:51.600]  to be on air at this time bringing you this information and there's a reason why they got
[2:46:51.600 --> 2:46:55.040]  rid of the veirs reports and the reports out of israel's because they don't want you to see this
[2:46:55.040 --> 2:46:59.920]  so shop and info or store.com so we can keep bringing this information alex jones back connected on

[2:49:46.320 --> 2:49:50.160]  the matt bragan wants to the last half the hour yeah i love matt but i've got to cover the vaccine
[2:49:50.160 --> 2:49:54.080]  stuff i have to get this information out and it's my fault i have a bunch of clips i haven't gotten
[2:49:54.080 --> 2:49:58.880]  to so i'm mad at myself for not getting to those and also have an example of a solution
[2:49:58.880 --> 2:50:03.520]  of the way to take the globalist on it while we're on the main show i'm gonna just ask very
[2:50:03.520 --> 2:50:08.720]  politely and and just lovingly can can we put the article from info wars dot com uh with the
[2:50:08.720 --> 2:50:15.200]  michael rapaport up there uh showing the side by side photos of him uh a few months ago getting the
[2:50:15.200 --> 2:50:20.560]  shot and saying he just got the shot and now he looks like today the rapaport's attacked me a lot
[2:50:20.560 --> 2:50:26.080]  so i see a lot of his videos uh and uh you know i routinely see his stuff as he attacks me every
[2:50:26.080 --> 2:50:33.760]  every month or so he looks 20 years older after he took the mRNA infection uh and i just want to
[2:50:33.760 --> 2:50:39.120]  show people what this looks like he's skinny he has his hair's totally gray he's lost a bunch of
[2:50:39.120 --> 2:50:45.360]  weight he looks 20 years older he's got a a fever blister on his face again i'm on the phone can
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:51.440]  people see that right now yes it's on the screen okay great so that's what goes on with this that's
[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:55.120]  what happens with this and that's why this is so dangerous but i wanted to talk about solutions here
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:00.640]  a few weeks ago it was a michigan fair and we'll just go ahead and roll the video please
[2:51:00.640 --> 2:51:06.240]  there was a michigan fair and they saw one of those rides where it's the ship that rocks back
[2:51:06.240 --> 2:51:10.880]  and forth and spins around in circles we've all been on them they hadn't put the anchors down
[2:51:11.760 --> 2:51:19.520]  right for it and so uh it starts to rock it's about to come over one man says let's get over
[2:51:19.520 --> 2:51:24.880]  here and let's save it and a bunch of people black wise hispanic old young risk their lives
[2:51:24.880 --> 2:51:28.960]  was about to come over and probably kill the people you know who were swinging around above at
[2:51:28.960 --> 2:51:34.960]  high speed and they saved the ride from jumping over that's the type of human spirit and human
[2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:42.400]  action that we need to have with this same thing be leaders be the first to step up and and and
[2:51:42.400 --> 2:51:46.960]  stand on that ride and save those people because hey that person could let those people get hurt or
[2:51:46.960 --> 2:51:51.120]  died and he might have you know predicted his life but he had that human instinct to help others
[2:51:51.120 --> 2:51:54.720]  they'll have the instinct to help him the authoritarian regimes they drive that out of you
[2:51:54.720 --> 2:51:57.520]  where no one stands up for each other but americans have always been known for that
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:03.440]  and and others around the world so i want to encourage everybody to come together and realize
[2:52:03.440 --> 2:52:08.160]  how important you are and how special all this is and in fact this is such an incredible moment
[2:52:08.160 --> 2:52:12.560]  the fact that you're awake and you're involved you're informed means you're literally an ambassador
[2:52:12.560 --> 2:52:18.560]  of a a leader an emissary in this whole fight that's why i'm so proud of oan and the great crew
[2:52:18.560 --> 2:52:23.280]  and and just the great job everybody's doing our affiliates our sponsors the great listeners

[2:52:26.640 --> 2:52:31.440]  this really bad cherry stuff but the globalist want us to be chilled you know childlike and very
[2:52:31.440 --> 2:52:36.560]  naive and stupid so they can feed on it all right fourth hour coming up with that practice

[2:53:58.560 --> 2:54:04.240]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled
[2:54:06.240 --> 2:54:11.440]  slaves worsted slaves just just property from cradle to grave of the system
[2:54:12.560 --> 2:54:19.120]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic
[2:54:19.120 --> 2:54:24.880]  control we have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare
[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:29.360]  dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia
[2:54:30.080 --> 2:54:35.600]  it's that choice it's that realization that's going to change the world and it's the only choice
[2:54:35.600 --> 2:54:41.120]  we've got freedom or slavery go to evil it is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the
[2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:51.120]  spear fighting it you're listening to the alex jones show

[2:55:11.920 --> 2:55:17.280]  of mrna technology on the war room of another name i guess they admire us
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:25.920]  but here he is talking about why everybody's getting sick
[2:55:25.920 --> 2:55:29.440]  tend to vaccines we're going to come back and give you the rest of story on the other side
[2:55:29.440 --> 2:55:38.400]  that that is not necessarily a bestseller but we publish an intelligence briefing on every
[2:55:38.400 --> 2:55:42.960]  violation of the biological and chemical weapons treaties that people have signed around the world
[2:55:43.760 --> 2:55:51.440]  and it's a phone book that tells you where and who and who's funding and and and stop it
[2:55:52.400 --> 2:55:55.280]  yeah this is what happens when i'm on the road and once the mistakes start
[2:55:55.280 --> 2:55:59.520]  this the whole cluster thing breaks down the whole show falls apart it's not the cruise falls
[2:56:00.240 --> 2:56:05.840]  it's it's it's it's it's my fault here so we'll cut this out of the rebroadcast i just i just
[2:56:05.840 --> 2:56:11.680]  keep screwing up here more and more ladies and gentlemen because that's another scientist
[2:56:12.240 --> 2:56:19.040]  that was on the program with the war room and then and then and then and then david martin is
[2:56:19.040 --> 2:56:25.520]  another individual and then we're going to play david barner also out of the Pfizer reports that's
[2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:28.960]  coming up next segment i'm gonna i'm gonna get this mail down oh and you go ahead and take over
[2:56:28.960 --> 2:56:31.920]  and cover the capital or whatever it is you're talking about that i'm gonna get these clips
[2:56:31.920 --> 2:56:36.560]  lined up to figure out exactly what's going on okay thank you okay let me just go ahead and i've
[2:56:36.560 --> 2:56:43.040]  got some other news that we can cover here that it has pretty much been uncovered in the media and
[2:56:43.040 --> 2:56:51.120]  while it's not necessarily as relevant relevant as some of the other news we've been covering
[2:56:51.120 --> 2:56:57.520]  here today it is relevant as an illustration that joe biden is not in control of the white house and
[2:56:57.520 --> 2:57:03.360]  this is very dangerous for us foreign policy and that even the democrat party has panicked over
[2:57:03.360 --> 2:57:07.200]  something that has happened in the last couple of weeks that the media hasn't even reported on
[2:57:07.200 --> 2:57:14.400]  him and so here are the headlines u.s airstrike in somalia is second this week against alshabab
[2:57:14.400 --> 2:57:21.120]  so were you aware that the u.s was striking somalia were you aware that the u.s has been
[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:29.280]  launching multiple strikes in somalia uh no most people weren't including congress maybe
[2:57:29.280 --> 2:57:34.320]  even including joe biden he might even not know what's going on boy how dangerous is that who's
[2:57:34.320 --> 2:57:42.480]  running our military right now who's launching airstrikes in somalia and why think about it
[2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:47.680]  congress didn't even know it was going on the democrat party didn't even know it was going
[2:57:47.680 --> 2:57:52.480]  on i would bet you right now that biden doesn't even know that it's going on who's running the
[2:57:52.480 --> 2:58:02.000]  military who's ordering the military to make these airstrikes in somalia and so the democrats
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:06.320]  are like they find out about this and they're like what the hell what is going on and so here's
[2:58:06.320 --> 2:58:11.760]  the story out of political a very dangerous precedent democrats take aim at biden somalia
[2:58:11.760 --> 2:58:15.600]  airstrikes you really think biden's in control you really think biden is making these orders
[2:58:16.880 --> 2:58:25.120]  of course not so somebody's doing this somebody needs to be arrested somebody needs to be indicted
[2:58:25.120 --> 2:58:36.400]  for illegally striking somalia but see you may recall when biden was vice president he might
[2:58:36.400 --> 2:58:42.320]  not remember this obama was launching drone strikes all over the middle east and he lied about it
[2:58:42.320 --> 2:58:47.760]  and said that it wasn't going on there were no drone strikes then you had a whistleblower
[2:58:47.760 --> 2:58:56.640]  a whistleblower daniel hail who released all of the documents of all the drone strikes that
[2:58:56.640 --> 2:59:04.400]  obama had approved and then lied about he released that well he has now been charged and he faces
[2:59:04.400 --> 2:59:11.120]  45 months in prison a whistleblower who saw that our government was lying to us who saw
[2:59:11.120 --> 2:59:15.600]  that barack obama was lying about airstrikes barack obama murdering people in the middle east
[2:59:15.600 --> 2:59:20.400]  on the us's name and dime and then lying about it because he was the anti-war candidate no he
[2:59:20.400 --> 2:59:26.160]  lied about that too he's a total fraud but the individual that leaked those documents and blew
[2:59:26.160 --> 2:59:31.360]  the whistle and told the world no we are doing these airstrikes obama did approve these airstrikes
[2:59:31.360 --> 2:59:38.000]  he faces 45 months in prison so so what the hell is going on so good members of the military and
[2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:43.280]  the intelligence department who blow the whistle on government corruption when it comes to war
[2:59:43.280 --> 2:59:48.400]  they face 45 months in jail but somebody's launching airstrikes in somalia and nobody
[2:59:48.400 --> 2:59:54.480]  knows who and there's no questions asked ladies and gentlemen oh and shroyer here the host of the
[2:59:54.480 --> 3:00:00.560]  info wars war room and i am very excited about our latest supplement addition to info wars store

[3:00:33.120 --> 3:00:39.120]  and we've packed it all in to fiber green caps at info wars store dot com so i'm excited to add
[3:00:39.120 --> 3:00:45.280]  this to my supplement routine every day i suggest that you do the same thing and right now it's at
[3:00:45.280 --> 3:00:51.120]  an introductory price of 1995 that's 33 off at info wars store dot com
[3:00:51.120 --> 3:01:07.040]  well you know we have been hearing that national anthem
[3:01:08.720 --> 3:01:12.400]  if you've been watching the olympics a lot of great americans have taken gold medals
[3:01:13.280 --> 3:01:19.120]  and you know what they're not like the spoiled cry baby professional athletes that want to
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:23.760]  make a political statement during our national anthem and take a knee or whatever else they
[3:01:23.760 --> 3:01:30.000]  want to do to protest america you know they stand up they put their hand on their heart
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:36.640]  they sing along even though they're muzzled what embarrassment that is and you know it's sad yet
[3:01:36.640 --> 3:01:44.080]  another situation with this simon biles debacle where a quitter and a wine bag spoiled athlete
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:50.560]  steals the show from all the true athletes that deserve our attention and our and our praise
[3:01:50.560 --> 3:01:58.320]  and our support not the quitters but the winners that love this country and so there have been a
[3:01:58.320 --> 3:02:03.600]  lot of great american athletes that you can tell are patriotic and you can tell love this country
[3:02:04.160 --> 3:02:10.560]  and it's sad that the liberals and the losers who want to spit on america and spit on our flag
[3:02:10.560 --> 3:02:16.000]  steal the attention away from the from the great american athletes that are still winning gold
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:24.400]  and love this country and whose family loves this country and so uh you know it's just the
[3:02:24.400 --> 3:02:30.240]  with this simon biles thing is another example and you know i'm beginning to wonder about the whole
[3:02:30.240 --> 3:02:36.480]  simon biles debacle because you don't forget the collin cappernick nike situation simon biles
[3:02:36.480 --> 3:02:42.240]  is a nike athlete and so i won't go too deep into that but the crew played the national anthem i
[3:02:42.240 --> 3:02:48.080]  wasn't planning on talking about that today but uh you know it really makes me wonder nike got to
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:56.480]  cappernick and made him quit and then he became a political pundit and i've never seen simon biles
[3:02:56.480 --> 3:03:02.320]  say anything political but it doesn't mean it might not happen in the future and uh how convenient
[3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:09.440]  that she just quits in the middle of the biggest event of her life a nike athlete and then gets all
[3:03:09.440 --> 3:03:15.040]  the attention for it and all the praise from the liberal media and then the other odd thing about
[3:03:15.040 --> 3:03:21.200]  this too is during the olympics they're running their propaganda pretty much 24 7 the olympics have
[3:03:21.200 --> 3:03:26.640]  just been turned into a propaganda machine now sadly uh with the face masks and everything else
[3:03:26.640 --> 3:03:32.800]  uh in between the lines though you can still see great americans competing and winning but it really
[3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:38.000]  makes you wonder simon biles quits in the middle of her competition gets all the praise in the media
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:44.800]  she's a nike athlete just like collin cappernick it all seems really suspicious and then when you
[3:03:44.800 --> 3:03:51.760]  see the propaganda that they're running during the commercial breaks and how almost every messaging
[3:03:51.760 --> 3:03:57.440]  during the commercial breaks is either directly or or subliminally about how you're depressed
[3:03:57.440 --> 3:03:59.760]  you're having a mental disorder and you need help
[3:04:01.920 --> 3:04:06.480]  and then you have simon biles who's in all of these different ad campaigns as well
[3:04:06.480 --> 3:04:10.880]  so you have simon biles sandwiched in between ads telling you that you have a mental problem
[3:04:10.880 --> 3:04:16.080]  that you're depressed and then you see simon biles and then another ad following it says
[3:04:16.080 --> 3:04:23.680]  that winning is in everything really is suspicious what are the odds that all those stars align
[3:04:23.680 --> 3:04:30.560]  for a nike athlete to quit in the middle of the olympics and then get praised for it just like
[3:04:30.560 --> 3:04:36.240]  collin cappernick did but uh i want to digress on that i wasn't even planning on talking about that
[3:04:36.240 --> 3:04:40.000]  but the crew played the national anthem so i just couldn't help myself it was on my mind
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:47.680]  now we are going to be rejoined by alex coming up in the next segment we're getting all these video
[3:04:47.680 --> 3:04:53.200]  clips in order as you know ladies and gentlemen alex on vacation this week i wish he would actually
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:58.080]  take a real vacation but he can't do it it's just impossible and so we're getting all these clips
[3:04:58.080 --> 3:05:03.120]  aligned with alex right now to make sure that when we come back we can have it all correct now
[3:05:03.120 --> 3:05:08.880]  again we covered this the other day but i want to bring it up because i think it kind of dovetails
[3:05:08.880 --> 3:05:16.480]  with the fact that our military is launching airstrikes in somalia and and seemingly nobody
[3:05:16.480 --> 3:05:22.320]  even knows who's launching it nobody has any idea what's going on we're bombing somalia and the
[3:05:22.320 --> 3:05:27.760]  biden administration has made no no comments on it the democrats in congress said what the hell's
[3:05:27.760 --> 3:05:31.920]  going on you didn't vote there's no congressional approval you're illegally striking somalia
[3:05:31.920 --> 3:05:35.920]  and the media is silent on it as well that's kind of a big story
[3:05:35.920 --> 3:05:44.160]  kind of a big deal makes the biden administration look really really bad and so i guess that's why
[3:05:44.160 --> 3:05:52.000]  the media is not covering it but as all this craziness is developing vladimir putin is building
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:05:57.360]  two new doomsday planes as a mobile command centers in the event of nuclear war because
[3:05:57.360 --> 3:06:03.280]  putin sees the tea leaves and he sees that the globalist american empire is out of control
[3:06:03.280 --> 3:06:07.760]  and it he also sees that the world is waking up to all this corruption
[3:06:08.880 --> 3:06:15.440]  and he knows that the the the the most dangerous animal is the one that's cornered with its fangs
[3:06:15.440 --> 3:06:21.600]  out and in desperation may do anything and that's kind of the situation that the globalist american
[3:06:21.600 --> 3:06:26.720]  empire is in right now their deadly vaccines have been exposed their lives about coveted
[3:06:26.720 --> 3:06:30.960]  have been exposed their lives about january 6th have been exposed their lives about donald trump
[3:06:30.960 --> 3:06:36.000]  have been exposed they stole the election that's been exposed so all of their massive crimes and
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:45.840]  lies america is finally waking up to it but in that process in their mad scientist corrupt
[3:06:45.840 --> 3:06:53.200]  government process they look at that situation and rather than just go out with dignity and
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:58.800]  admit that their plan for world domination failed rather than just let the world go on
[3:06:58.800 --> 3:07:04.160]  and be free and live and not want to go under their tyranny they would rather flip over the table
[3:07:04.160 --> 3:07:11.200]  or launch a nuclear war just despite humanity not wanting to be enslaved by them just despite
[3:07:11.200 --> 3:07:18.080]  humanity that doesn't want to take their forced deadly injections and putin knows that and that's
[3:07:18.080 --> 3:07:28.320]  why he now has doomsday planes to basically run uh russia from the air in case of a nuclear war so i
[3:07:28.320 --> 3:07:33.760]  mean folks you gotta understand when our military is striking somalia and the the white house doesn't
[3:07:33.760 --> 3:07:39.200]  even have a comment on it and congress didn't even know that it happened i mean you should
[3:07:39.200 --> 3:07:45.120]  be having serious red flags going off what the hell is going on who's running our military i mean
[3:07:45.120 --> 3:07:49.760]  that's some serious business right there and you know we've barely even talked about the fact that
[3:07:49.760 --> 3:08:00.240]  our southern border is wide open but see abc news has this story today earth overshoot day mark's date
[3:08:00.240 --> 3:08:06.240]  planet has used up resources for the year so this is this new thing and they're just saying oh there's
[3:08:06.240 --> 3:08:12.240]  no more resources for planet earth in the year 2021 sorry and of course they're not they're not
[3:08:12.240 --> 3:08:16.160]  fully executing this yet they're they're just showing you that this is their plan for the future
[3:08:16.160 --> 3:08:24.240]  so in the future you know by 2030 that's that's their really end game date here is oh once the earth
[3:08:24.240 --> 3:08:31.760]  hits overshoot day sorry no more water for you no more energy for you you get shut off and until
[3:08:31.760 --> 3:08:38.000]  the end of the year you you get nothing good luck now the irony here obviously you can imagine what's
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:43.360]  in this story it's all about man-made climate change uh not just the irony of the fact that
[3:08:43.360 --> 3:08:49.200]  they now have man-made weather weapons and and they're making weather in dubai and in russia
[3:08:49.200 --> 3:08:53.840]  and in china oh no no no that doesn't count for man-made global warming that doesn't count for
[3:08:53.840 --> 3:08:58.400]  man-made climate change even though it's literally man-made climate change no they don't count that
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:02.880]  just you the human wanting to heat your house or you the human wanting to cool your house or
[3:09:02.880 --> 3:09:09.520]  you the human wanting to drive a car you're the problem but in this story where it talks about
[3:09:09.520 --> 3:09:15.600]  the global footprint network and earth overshoot day where they just say earth only has this much
[3:09:15.600 --> 3:09:20.720]  resources for a year and as soon as you cross that threshold you have to shut everything down
[3:09:20.720 --> 3:09:25.440]  and they're even saying well we got 155 days left in the year now you get nothing so for the next
[3:09:25.440 --> 3:09:32.400]  155 days because you overshot the earth resources and energy resources you you get nothing for 155
[3:09:32.400 --> 3:09:38.640]  days now good luck i guess you're just gonna die which is of course what they want but yet in this
[3:09:38.640 --> 3:09:47.200]  story that demonizes co2 says the us is bad for co2 emissions there's once again not i'm not talking
[3:09:47.200 --> 3:09:53.600]  about the actual man-made weather but there's once again there's once again something that's left out
[3:09:53.600 --> 3:10:02.000]  of this that should never be left out but once again conveniently is omitted and that is china
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:09.360]  really amazing isn't it how china doesn't have to curtail its carbon emissions even though china
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:15.200]  emits more carbon into the atmosphere than every other industrialized nation combined
[3:10:16.320 --> 3:10:23.280]  but no mention of china no no no no china is not the problem you the dirty american you
[3:10:23.280 --> 3:10:29.840]  the dirty westerner you the dirty human being who wants to drive a car or fly commercially
[3:10:29.840 --> 3:10:36.800]  wants to heat your little apartment or family home you're the bad person you've just used
[3:10:36.800 --> 3:10:41.200]  up all the earth's resources for the year and so now for the next 155 days it's death and
[3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:48.560]  desperation because of you bad human but china no not china they don't have to stop doing anything
[3:10:48.560 --> 3:10:59.040]  because they run the whole show jacob in ohio welcome go ahead hey how's it going alex good

[3:13:31.440 --> 3:13:37.040]  elon must put up an interesting tweet today which it seems like it's not that interesting i'll
[3:13:37.040 --> 3:13:48.640]  explain why though tesla ai day august 19th okay seems kind of mundane unimportant but i learned
[3:13:48.640 --> 3:13:57.040]  this yesterday and elon musk obviously knows this apparently the number 19 is kind of a code word for
[3:13:57.040 --> 3:14:05.600]  ai because a first letter of the alphabet i ninth letter of the alphabet elon musk knows that that's
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:17.600]  why he said tesla ai day is on august 19th so it's pretty incredible to think covid 19 is actually an
[3:14:17.600 --> 3:14:27.600]  acronym guys put uh yesterday's show from the war room we had a great guest on clay clark who
[3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:31.680]  was breaking this down i'd never seen this before i'd seen it before but i'd never had someone break
[3:14:31.680 --> 3:14:41.360]  it down before covid 19 is actually an acronym and 19 at the end of it is code for ai it's all about
[3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:48.560]  the vaccine id ladies and gentlemen now alex jones has joined us we've got the video clips ready to
[3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:55.040]  go alex joins re uh jones rejoins the alex jones show alex take it away absolutely and the crew
[3:14:55.040 --> 3:14:58.240]  is doing a great job i was doing a great job i'm the one that's caused a little bit of a catty
[3:14:58.240 --> 3:15:02.720]  wampus problem here because i thought matt bracken was out today he wasn't so that's actually
[3:15:03.680 --> 3:15:07.920]  okay so now oh and i have time to cover everything but i do want to hear the great information
[3:15:07.920 --> 3:15:13.040]  that bracken always has to offer enemies farm domestic dot com so we'll have more from him coming
[3:15:13.040 --> 3:15:17.680]  up to the days to follow and i had sent them some clips and had uh ripped the names down
[3:15:17.680 --> 3:15:24.240]  to all the clips because again i'm on the road and i'm doing this from the back porch a little
[3:15:24.240 --> 3:15:29.680]  condo here at a fishing village where i'm trying to get my mind cleared out but a next segment i'll
[3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:36.400]  tell the story in full about why i can't i literally cannot walk down the street or go out on a fishing
[3:15:36.400 --> 3:15:41.520]  boat without hearing about people's family members being murdered with ventilators and the people
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:46.080]  telling you this know their families were murdered so talk about that coming up later in the next
[3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:50.960]  segment but i've got three clips i really really want to get to the first is dr robert malone
[3:15:50.960 --> 3:16:01.200]  uh and he is the inventor of the mrna technology he's launched billion dollar companies he believes
[3:16:01.200 --> 3:16:09.360]  in clean good vaccines but in the studying of mrna with an application like this for spike protein
[3:16:09.360 --> 3:16:15.360]  he warned a year ago that this would probably have problems he's been very intense about it since then
[3:16:15.360 --> 3:16:23.520]  and he went on the war room not owens war room but uh on the other war room uh with steve vannon
[3:16:23.520 --> 3:16:27.120]  but again i think that's an excellent show i just grew some of the stuff and using our name for a
[3:16:27.120 --> 3:16:31.440]  show but that's a side issue um just mention the war rooms things that wouldn't be confusing but
[3:16:31.440 --> 3:16:37.520]  our war room is 3 p.m central as you know folks but he does a great job and he had uh dr robert malone
[3:16:37.520 --> 3:16:42.560]  on laying out what we all predicted what medical doctors predicted here what epidemiologists
[3:16:42.560 --> 3:16:47.920]  predicted here what the medical literature showed uh of why the majority of people that have taken
[3:16:47.920 --> 3:16:52.720]  the vaccine within six months start to get sick that's under 10 penny they've all explained
[3:16:52.720 --> 3:16:57.840]  and that's what's so scary here folks this is known stuff in literature this has been the common
[3:16:57.840 --> 3:17:02.000]  bold has been studied more than anything we always know you can't get a cure with the common cold
[3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:08.160]  because there's millions of them over time okay thousands at any one time so you can't ever get
[3:17:08.160 --> 3:17:15.600]  the RNA of that because it's too very but you can attack the protein shell except again i keep
[3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:20.880]  harping on this folks you got to warn your friends and family that proteins all over your body oh
[3:17:20.880 --> 3:17:24.960]  like your ovaries and your testicles and your brain and your heart and your lungs anywhere you've
[3:17:24.960 --> 3:17:30.080]  got fast growing cells and and a bunch of other things so here he is then i'm gonna go back to the
[3:17:30.080 --> 3:17:38.320]  clip from dr david lv bowler three weeks ago that we had harped on where he's giggling and
[3:17:38.320 --> 3:17:44.240]  laughing and he's in charge of the whole british government project he's not british uh testing
[3:17:44.240 --> 3:17:49.840]  what happened to vaccinated people with these mRNA and he says it destroys your immune system
[3:17:49.840 --> 3:17:55.360]  and that basically after six months you have no immune system i mean this is incredible so if people
[3:17:55.360 --> 3:18:01.360]  said oh that's your interpretation of that no we have the damn study i spent hours reading
[3:18:01.360 --> 3:18:07.360]  dr david lv bowler's british government back number one bio weapon lab of the world report
[3:18:07.360 --> 3:18:12.800]  i got really bloodshot eyes reading i spent it doesn't matter that's why it's so frustrated folks
[3:18:12.800 --> 3:18:16.560]  this is open and shut like if i walk up and shoot you in the head with a 12 day shotgun
[3:18:16.560 --> 3:18:21.760]  your brains are on the wall that's science that's kinetic energy okay this stuff is science they're
[3:18:21.760 --> 3:18:26.320]  growing damn protein crystals in us they're giving us artificial mad cow and i am just
[3:18:26.320 --> 3:18:30.880]  beyond pissed here it's not normal to just sit here and talk about this so stop apologizing
[3:18:30.880 --> 3:18:34.240]  oh when you get pissed i think we should have beat them to expect i don't think we're i don't think
[3:18:34.240 --> 3:18:38.880]  we're pissed enough uh so here's the inventor who they're trying to censor off the internet
[3:18:39.680 --> 3:18:43.760]  who who is only hurting his own technology he explains that he goes i wish this wasn't being
[3:18:43.760 --> 3:18:49.040]  misused but you could not get a more credible damn person here's dr robert bowler what you
[3:18:49.040 --> 3:18:56.640]  heard fauchy say is the nasal titers are the same in vaccine recipients and unvaccinated
[3:18:57.200 --> 3:19:06.640]  that's a uh that's selective disclosure apparently uh nasal titers are a very poor indicator uh as
[3:19:06.640 --> 3:19:15.440]  opposed to blood-based titers of infectious virus what nbc news dropped yesterday was the statement
[3:19:15.440 --> 3:19:21.200]  uh sourced from an unnamed government official that the titers in the vaccinated are actually higher
[3:19:22.240 --> 3:19:27.920]  than in the unvaccinated what does this mean and why why do you suddenly see this kind of
[3:19:27.920 --> 3:19:35.280]  frantic scramble this is precisely what one would see if antibody dependent enhancement
[3:19:35.280 --> 3:19:42.400]  were was happening what is antibody dependent enhancement briefly it's that the vaccine causes
[3:19:42.400 --> 3:19:49.760]  uh the virus to become more infectious than would happen in the absence of vaccination
[3:19:50.320 --> 3:19:57.040]  would cause the virus to replicate at higher levels than in the absence of infection this is
[3:19:57.040 --> 3:20:02.960]  this is the vaccinologist works nightmare uh it happened with the respiratory syncytial virus
[3:20:03.680 --> 3:20:10.800]  and in the 60s and caused more child deaths in vaccine recipients than unvaccinated it happened
[3:20:10.800 --> 3:20:18.480]  with dengue vaccine the dengue vaccine and it's happened with virtually every other coronavirus
[3:20:18.480 --> 3:20:27.280]  vaccine development program certainly in humans uh known in history and it's what the vaccinologists
[3:20:27.280 --> 3:20:33.840]  like myself have been warning you about okay so and the full clips up on info wars dot com
[3:20:33.840 --> 3:20:37.200]  it's like an hour long interview and i really want to get rid of them alone at least in the
[3:20:37.200 --> 3:20:41.120]  war room uh you know my show is too hot to handle because we're such trailblazers way
[3:20:41.120 --> 3:20:45.120]  out ahead everybody you notice what he just said he said every other coronavirus vaccine
[3:20:45.120 --> 3:20:50.080]  has done this it's the holy grail folks to cure the common cold but they had a shot that would
[3:20:50.080 --> 3:20:56.800]  do it i would take it they have studied it everywhere Fauci funded himself now i've i've
[3:20:56.800 --> 3:21:02.560]  read at least 20 of them okay so my eyes bleed but the ut one is a u.s government initiative
[3:21:02.560 --> 3:21:09.200]  u.s government initiative project had more than seven universities based out of university of
[3:21:09.200 --> 3:21:15.200]  texas at austin and they found that university texas at gallows excuse me they found i know i
[3:21:15.200 --> 3:21:19.280]  know folks i got hundreds of topics to cover i keep repeating this because you understand they knew
[3:21:19.840 --> 3:21:24.960]  that's why he just said he said every other coronavirus vaccine has done this that's the
[3:21:24.960 --> 3:21:32.080]  cold virus you cannot do it when you do it this happens and it causes the body to grow them so
[3:21:32.080 --> 3:21:37.120]  now i told you last year the numbers were not up on death and i told you i went and checked the
[3:21:37.120 --> 3:21:41.440]  numbers the numbers were not up most of the people that they said were sick with covid had
[3:21:41.440 --> 3:21:46.240]  something else but let me give the newsflash everyone i know has COVID now i mean i'm gonna
[3:21:46.240 --> 3:21:51.440]  say that i mean everybody i talked to people all around me and now i actually have it you know
[3:21:51.440 --> 3:21:57.600]  listeners call into the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because i sit there
[3:21:57.600 --> 3:22:03.680]  and i beg you for support constantly for prayer for financial support and for word of mouth and
[3:22:03.680 --> 3:22:08.000]  then we're all this together and i you know it gets old having to come to you and say hey i got
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:11.920]  great products please buy them or we won't be here on air but it's true for the only media
[3:22:11.920 --> 3:22:16.240]  organization in the united states that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to
[3:22:16.240 --> 3:22:20.320]  the big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else they crippled
[3:22:20.320 --> 3:22:25.600]  all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out in the open
[3:22:25.600 --> 3:22:29.600]  our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken off air that's why america
[3:22:29.600 --> 3:22:34.240]  has got to be taken down you can't have all these other nations enslaved and america still quasi
[3:22:34.240 --> 3:22:39.040]  free you can't have info wars has been proven right be on air with all the craziness that's
[3:22:39.040 --> 3:22:43.920]  about to unfold because if you think stuff's bad now just get ready so thank you all and get an
[3:22:43.920 --> 3:22:48.480]  infowarstore.com get some great 2020 election shirts supplements and so much more they're
[3:22:48.480 --> 3:22:55.200]  wonderful products and they support the infowar thank you. There's one central fact of criminal
[3:22:55.200 --> 3:23:02.480]  psychology that criminologists all agree on and that its criminals are extremely pathological
[3:23:03.040 --> 3:23:07.600]  even more the general public they do the same things over and over again and criminals like to
[3:23:07.600 --> 3:23:14.720]  commit the same types of crimes over and over again well guess what it was anthony fouchy
[3:23:14.720 --> 3:23:22.080]  and eugenicist globalist that ran the roll out of hiv and the mistreatment of it with azt and
[3:23:22.080 --> 3:23:26.640]  other chemicals that actually killed more people than hiv and they were the ones involved in viral
[3:23:26.640 --> 3:23:32.000]  research of viruses that would actually go attack the t-limbs besides the body and create
[3:23:32.000 --> 3:23:38.400]  autoimmune disorders the problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be
[3:23:38.400 --> 3:23:43.600]  non-lethal down the road that's why they need to roll out the covet 19 and the vaccine because
[3:23:43.600 --> 3:23:47.680]  now they admit the covet 19 vaccine destroys your immune system basically giving you the
[3:23:47.680 --> 3:23:54.960]  equivalent of hiv that's right ladies and gentlemen the entire new world order system
[3:23:54.960 --> 3:24:00.880]  is about making you feel pathetic and making you feel weak making you play the part of a victim
[3:24:00.880 --> 3:24:05.520]  so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of god and the incredible mission and
[3:24:05.520 --> 3:24:12.080]  destiny we have being given free will being given free will being given consciousness is literally
[3:24:12.080 --> 3:24:18.800]  the seed of an entire universe an entire system and the fact that you're able to commune with god
[3:24:18.800 --> 3:24:23.200]  the fact you're able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean
[3:24:23.200 --> 3:24:28.240]  or the beauty of your life your husband the beauty of your child learning knowledge the beauty of
[3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:34.400]  music the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself is
[3:24:34.400 --> 3:24:40.800]  what god teaches us is worship so don't worship the globalist don't worship the nfl don't worship
[3:24:40.800 --> 3:24:46.240]  all the things of the system but worship the things of god because we're made by god and appreciate
[3:24:46.240 --> 3:24:50.800]  your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it while you still have it
[3:24:51.680 --> 3:24:56.400]  ladies and gentlemen owens shroyer here the host of the info wars war room and i am very excited

[3:25:43.600 --> 3:25:50.320]  now it's at an introductory price of 1995 that's 33 off at info wars store.com
[3:25:50.320 --> 3:26:03.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:26:11.600 --> 3:26:17.200]  all right folks alex jones here on the road i'll destroy your ride shotgun he's got the war room
[3:26:17.200 --> 3:26:23.120]  coming up here about 27 minutes 3 to 6 p.m and i know he's doing a lot of powerful shows we open
[3:26:23.120 --> 3:26:28.240]  the phones up to doctors and nurses and to victims of the covid vaccine and the lines just load up
[3:26:28.240 --> 3:26:32.160]  i'm gonna do the same thing it's just it's just incredible when i get back to austin i'm planning
[3:26:32.160 --> 3:26:36.960]  to do some special nighttime shows that are commercial free where we just take three four
[3:26:36.960 --> 3:26:41.920]  hours of phone calls for people so you can give your testimony and be heard because this whole
[3:26:41.920 --> 3:26:46.080]  evil system is about suppressing you but i got caught off by the break because i didn't hear the
[3:26:46.080 --> 3:26:50.800]  music and my technical issues i'm just over a phone out here the middle of nowhere and i was
[3:26:50.800 --> 3:26:55.360]  finished the point of everybody i know that's what i meant to say is everybody i know knows people
[3:26:56.080 --> 3:27:00.640]  that have covid-like symptoms that are getting really really sick having all sorts of problems
[3:27:00.640 --> 3:27:05.440]  85-year-old women are having menstrual cycles again everywhere um women are losing their babies
[3:27:05.440 --> 3:27:11.120]  everywhere people are having all sorts of weird shingles rashes all over them and it's everything
[3:27:11.120 --> 3:27:16.560]  that the literature showed us what viral shedding will do and so i know people now that go into medical
[3:27:16.560 --> 3:27:21.680]  doctors and they go oh we're not going to do a covid test that's because right now they don't
[3:27:21.680 --> 3:27:26.000]  want high numbers that in the fall they're going to start testing again but not with the pcr test
[3:27:26.960 --> 3:27:30.320]  was all these other tests and then jack the numbers up but but but they want to say it's
[3:27:30.320 --> 3:27:34.000]  low right now because quote people are being vaccinated but the truth is we know that actually
[3:27:34.000 --> 3:27:39.040]  the number of deaths and people that have covid-like symptoms are skyrocketing but it's not covid
[3:27:39.040 --> 3:27:43.280]  as you would think of it the supposed virus it is what's been caused by the vaccine
[3:27:43.920 --> 3:27:48.320]  truly a genetic engineering compound that reprograms themselves to make poisonous prions
[3:27:48.880 --> 3:27:52.640]  that normally what we know about is a bunch of form of cephalopathy number back in the 90s
[3:27:53.280 --> 3:27:57.520]  they didn't kill most of the cows and sheep and in the uh in the uk they were feeding what they
[3:27:57.520 --> 3:28:03.760]  called awful uh to the sheep and cows you're not supposed to do that sheep and cows at three
[3:28:03.760 --> 3:28:10.800]  stomachs they don't eat meat they are not omnivores or not carnivores uh they are vegetarians uh
[3:28:10.800 --> 3:28:16.400]  they're herbivores and so they would feed them ground up dead dogs dead cats everything from
[3:28:16.400 --> 3:28:22.720]  the veterinarians dead cows dead sheep dead everything dead horses mix it into a protein
[3:28:22.720 --> 3:28:29.760]  slurry mix that in with grain and other things corn and then they would feed that awful uh to the
[3:28:29.760 --> 3:28:38.000]  fish to the cows and it would grow uh in that awful uh it would grow mainly from the bone tissue
[3:28:38.000 --> 3:28:44.400]  in other areas protein crystals and then uh when when humans would eat that it would pass
[3:28:44.400 --> 3:28:48.800]  through the stomach wall intestine wall get into the blood and they would get to the blood
[3:28:48.800 --> 3:28:55.600]  brain barrier and begin growing uh these crystal cultures in the brain now these these protein
[3:28:55.600 --> 3:29:00.800]  crystals are almost identical to the spike protein so this is a very toxic thing and this is all on
[3:29:00.800 --> 3:29:06.720]  record and it was predicted and it was known so you just heard the inventor of mRNA technology
[3:29:06.720 --> 3:29:10.960]  he holds the major patents on it he's a vaccine advocate of or declinally and properly and heavily
[3:29:10.960 --> 3:29:16.080]  tested because it's a real science but he says mRNA is not good apply to this he says all the
[3:29:16.080 --> 3:29:23.600]  studies we did in rats killed them okay it killed him he said he causes the body to just start
[3:29:23.600 --> 3:29:29.440]  producing the protein of the virus and it kills he says in every study that's why he said a year
[3:29:29.440 --> 3:29:34.400]  plus ago he goes don't do this this doesn't work everybody knows this this is like again don't jump
[3:29:34.400 --> 3:29:37.840]  off a cliff without a tertiary you're going to break your neck or you're going to break your legs
[3:29:37.840 --> 3:29:45.280]  i mean this is one on one folks so we have that now we have dr david lb bower who runs the big
[3:29:45.280 --> 3:29:52.000]  uk top weapons facility number one bio weapons lab in the world the biggest the top one that we know
[3:29:52.000 --> 3:29:58.320]  of it's the biggest public one here he is two weeks ago going oh yeah uh once you take these vaccines
[3:29:58.320 --> 3:30:03.040]  for fizer shot you you know you're you're gonna have to keep taking them later because it stops
[3:30:03.040 --> 3:30:09.920]  working in a few months well that's exactly what dr robert malone just said and so and then your
[3:30:09.920 --> 3:30:15.600]  body starts producing so so this is very very very serious i'm not the scientist these are the
[3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:20.720]  scientists the ones for this stuff we're admitting it to you and this is 12 monkey type stuff so here's
[3:30:20.720 --> 3:30:28.640]  dr david lb bower so the key message from our finding is that we found that recipients of the
[3:30:28.640 --> 3:30:35.680]  fizer vaccine those who've had two doses have about five to six fold lower amounts of neutralizing
[3:30:35.680 --> 3:30:41.840]  antibodies now these are the sort of gold standard private security uh antibodies of your immune system
[3:30:41.840 --> 3:30:47.600]  which block the virus from getting into your cells in the first place so we found that that's
[3:30:47.600 --> 3:30:52.640]  less for people with two doses we've also found that for people with only one dose of the fizer jab
[3:30:53.200 --> 3:30:58.960]  that they are less likely to have high levels of these antibodies in their blood and perhaps most
[3:30:58.960 --> 3:31:04.800]  importantly for all of us going forward is that we see that the older you are the lower your levels
[3:31:04.800 --> 3:31:10.400]  are likely to be and the time since you've had your second jab as that time goes on the lower
[3:31:10.400 --> 3:31:15.040]  your levels are also likely to be so that's telling us that we're probably going to be needing to
[3:31:15.040 --> 3:31:20.480]  prioritize boosters for older and more vulnerable people coming up soon especially if this new variant
[3:31:20.480 --> 3:31:26.880]  spreads and people said oh that can't be true that you misspoke and then turned out oh we're going
[3:31:26.880 --> 3:31:30.640]  to give you two shots a year for the rest of your life behind the sort of laughing of people
[3:31:30.640 --> 3:31:35.440]  is a destroy your immune system now here's dr david martin because by the way a few weeks ago
[3:31:35.440 --> 3:31:39.760]  i had him scheduled on the show he's a great guy really good at maths really good at corporate
[3:31:39.760 --> 3:31:43.520]  stuff a huge author one of the most important people out there fighting tyranny right now
[3:31:43.520 --> 3:31:47.120]  i had some family stuff going on and i thought i wasn't able to do the second hour
[3:31:47.120 --> 3:31:50.000]  and then that family thing cleared up and i canceled the interview with him
[3:31:50.000 --> 3:31:54.640]  and i really apologize i want to get him back on the air here he is and he's got all the maths
[3:31:54.640 --> 3:32:00.240]  all the background all the medical information but more importantly he's an expert in finance
[3:32:00.240 --> 3:32:04.400]  he really runs some big funds and things very successful ones you know they're on the top 100
[3:32:04.400 --> 3:32:10.960]  on on on CNBC he goes into the documents how they pre-planned all this with the COVID roll out with
[3:32:10.960 --> 3:32:15.760]  the vaccines to make profit now he has a smoking gun and so one way or the other go find his
[3:32:15.760 --> 3:32:20.240]  interviews out there because they are absolutely critical and even if he can't come on the show
[3:32:20.240 --> 3:32:24.160]  because i i didn't have him on i'm still going to put a compilation of stuff he's saying together
[3:32:24.160 --> 3:32:28.000]  in erin because all i care about is getting the information out in fact crew just start for the
[3:32:28.000 --> 3:32:32.160]  next few days a big compilation of his latest information let's do a whole hour even if he
[3:32:32.160 --> 3:32:37.120]  can't join us uh because he's doing amazing work here is just part of what the dr david martin just
[3:32:37.120 --> 3:32:45.120]  said recently that that is not necessarily a bestseller but we publish an intelligence briefing
[3:32:45.120 --> 3:32:50.160]  on every violation of the biological and chemical weapons treaties that people have signed around
[3:32:50.160 --> 3:32:59.520]  the world and it's a phone book that tells you where and who and who's funding and and and so for
[3:32:59.520 --> 3:33:08.400]  us it wasn't hard to figure out that this was not a public health crisis this was an opportunistic
[3:33:08.400 --> 3:33:16.720]  marketing campaign to address a stated objective and that's why this is occam's razor it's the easiest
[3:33:16.720 --> 3:33:23.760]  thing to describe because they're the ones that said it and the occam's razor reality is they said
[3:33:23.760 --> 3:33:29.920]  they needed to get the public to accept a pan coronavirus vaccine countermeasure
[3:33:31.040 --> 3:33:37.120]  and they needed the media to create the hype and investors would follow where they see profit
[3:33:38.480 --> 3:33:44.640]  you do not have anything else you need to rely on to explain the events of the last 20 months
[3:33:45.440 --> 3:33:53.520]  then the actual statement of the actual perpetrator and i don't do the naval gazing exercise of going
[3:33:53.520 --> 3:33:59.120]  in to try to understand whether there were mommy issues behind a bank robber if they're holding a
[3:33:59.120 --> 3:34:06.800]  bag of money outside of a bank i actually make the crazy assumption that maybe they're a bank robber
[3:34:08.080 --> 3:34:14.480]  similarly if i have somebody who says we need to use the media to hype a metal
[3:34:14.480 --> 3:34:21.760]  medical countermeasure which is in fact the injection of a synthetic recombinant chimeric
[3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:28.960]  protein developed off of a computer simulation if i'm actually going to listen to the motivation for
[3:34:28.960 --> 3:34:36.720]  why that might be being done i will listen to the person doing the manipulation who says investors
[3:34:36.720 --> 3:34:45.440]  will follow where they see profit i don't need more explanation neither and the illusion that we
[3:34:45.440 --> 3:34:52.320]  that we continue to to unfortunately see very well meaning people get trapped in
[3:34:53.680 --> 3:34:58.160]  is conversations about whether we're having a vaccine for a virus the fact of the matter is
[3:34:58.160 --> 3:35:06.000]  we're not we are injecting a spike protein mRNA secret mRNA sequence which is a computer
[3:35:06.000 --> 3:35:13.440]  simulation it's not derived from nature it's a computer simulation of a sequence which has
[3:35:13.440 --> 3:35:21.600]  been known and patented for years and what we know is that that sequence as reported is reported
[3:35:21.600 --> 3:35:27.360]  across things like you know the very reliable phone conversations that took place between
[3:35:27.360 --> 3:35:33.360]  maderna and the vaccine research center by self report where i don't know if you were on a phone
[3:35:33.360 --> 3:35:42.960]  call and you heard a ttcc gg ttcc gabbb you know is there any chance you might get a a letter
[3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:51.440]  of valor a consonant dropped here or there the ludicrous nature of the story we here at info

[3:36:14.160 --> 3:36:20.080]  tagaloa who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe the samoan
[3:36:20.080 --> 3:36:24.800]  people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen

[3:40:18.480 --> 3:40:23.840]  in about 10 minutes uh but i want to finish up the clip with dr david martin because
[3:40:23.840 --> 3:40:30.160]  what he gets into is is dr peter dazik and these funding groups and bellum linda gates and fouchy
[3:40:30.800 --> 3:40:36.320]  and how they went and were developing vaccines for these chimeric viruses at the luan lab
[3:40:36.960 --> 3:40:42.560]  and gave the order to start producing basically the covet 19 vaccine in december of 2019 months
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:49.200]  before it was even announced and yet peter dazik's saying oh we in 2019 saying oh you know we're
[3:40:49.200 --> 3:40:54.000]  merging all these viruses to create a super vaccine again well that when they already studied all
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:58.560]  these and knew they didn't work in fact made people sick so this is all a big giant test with the
[3:40:58.560 --> 3:41:03.360]  media the corporations and big tech to see they can get away with killing a bunch of people and
[3:41:03.360 --> 3:41:07.440]  i'm going to talk about the ventilators during closing with oh and just a moment but finishing
[3:41:07.440 --> 3:41:13.840]  up with that short clip of dr david martin m r and a sequence which is a computer simulation
[3:41:13.840 --> 3:41:21.280]  it's not derived from nature it's a computer simulation of a sequence which has been known
[3:41:21.280 --> 3:41:29.600]  and patented for years and what we know is that that sequence as reported is reported across
[3:41:29.600 --> 3:41:35.120]  things like you know the very reliable phone conversations that took place between maderna
[3:41:35.120 --> 3:41:40.640]  and the vaccine research center by self report where i don't know if you were on a phone call
[3:41:40.640 --> 3:41:49.920]  and you heard a t t c c g g t t c c g a b b b you know is there any chance you might get a letter
[3:41:49.920 --> 3:41:57.520]  a valour a consonant dropped here or there that the the ludicrous nature of the story that this is
[3:41:57.520 --> 3:42:04.480]  somehow prophylactic or preventative flies in the face of a hundred percent of the evidence
[3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:10.000]  because the evidence makes it abundantly clear that there has been no effort by any pharmaceutical
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:21.840]  company to combat the virus this is about getting people injected with the known to be harmful s1
[3:42:21.840 --> 3:42:29.680]  spike protein so the the cover story is that if you get an expression of a spike protein
[3:42:29.680 --> 3:42:35.280]  you're going to have some sort of general symptomatic relief but the fact of the matter is
[3:42:35.280 --> 3:42:43.280]  is there has never been an intent to vaccinate a population as defined by the vaccination
[3:42:43.280 --> 3:42:50.000]  universe and and it's important i mean let's let's review just for the record when anthony
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:58.960]  fowchie tried desperately to get some of his quote synthetic rna vaccines published he had
[3:42:58.960 --> 3:43:08.080]  his own patents rejected by the patent office that's right so so 20 years of attempts to roll out
[3:43:08.080 --> 3:43:15.040]  m rna technology has now been basically forced through outside of law and outside of regulatory
[3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:21.600]  agencies that's why the fta has still not come out and approved this as a authorized study
[3:43:21.600 --> 3:43:26.080]  shock because it hasn't been and they will fully destroy themselves and sign themselves on this
[3:43:26.080 --> 3:43:30.400]  that they've done it so this is multinational corporations through the un through big tech
[3:43:30.400 --> 3:43:33.920]  of the chinese scaring us and forcing this all through and i'm going to just tell the story
[3:43:33.920 --> 3:43:39.680]  bravely and then get i'll enjoy your take on it since i've been on the road and just trying to
[3:43:39.680 --> 3:43:42.960]  take off for time and get a lot of phone calls done and do a little bit of fishing a little bit
[3:43:42.960 --> 3:43:49.040]  of hiking and you know being a good boy don't eat like a pig not drinking i have had three people on
[3:43:49.040 --> 3:43:53.200]  the street walk up to me and say they took my brother they took my sister they took my mom they
[3:43:53.200 --> 3:44:00.720]  took my dad they took them my cousin and they just went in with a cold they were fine they said hey
[3:44:00.720 --> 3:44:04.560]  sign this form we're going to innovate you and of course they did they weren't a medical doctor
[3:44:04.560 --> 3:44:08.400]  they'd have a lawyer there with them they trust their doctor and they and they and they put a tube
[3:44:08.400 --> 3:44:12.560]  down your throat even though they say if you have covid you can even do that turns out over half the
[3:44:12.560 --> 3:44:17.440]  people in the uk uh that they said died of covid of course didn't it was something else turns out
[3:44:17.440 --> 3:44:25.120]  over half the people as the uk's put numbers up on the us isn't um were falsely tested for it or
[3:44:25.120 --> 3:44:29.120]  was done after they were admitted and it turns out it was fake i mean they admit the pcr test is
[3:44:29.120 --> 3:44:36.320]  94 frauds one that's what it's set up right so again this is just a giant exercise in fraud
[3:44:37.040 --> 3:44:42.000]  and then i'm out fishing yesterday and i'm sitting there and the guy looks at me goes so you're
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:48.080]  you're you're your url shows he goes yeah he goes yeah i've seen some of your stuff he was my cousin's
[3:44:48.080 --> 3:44:53.280]  basically two years older than me he had a sore throat he goes into the clinic they don't even do
[3:44:53.280 --> 3:44:59.360]  a test i say let me guess i said to the city hospital he goes yeah and then he goes in they
[3:44:59.360 --> 3:45:03.760]  signed the form because he believes them but they want to innovate even though he was just coughing
[3:45:03.760 --> 3:45:08.080]  up some green stuff didn't offer antibiotics didn't offer steroids didn't offer you know drain
[3:45:08.080 --> 3:45:13.360]  he was not having trouble breathing he signs a form they put him in a coma so he won't fight
[3:45:14.400 --> 3:45:21.200]  i think he was dead two days later and again i can't even go out on a lake and fish uh
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:29.600]  because that's where we are ladies and gentlemen it's all around us and again there are all these
[3:45:29.600 --> 3:45:34.880]  mystery illnesses now death rates are way up this year as i predicted last year it was a normal level
[3:45:34.880 --> 3:45:39.920]  no no this fall this winter this all this shedding it's going to be devastating i believe
[3:45:39.920 --> 3:45:43.680]  and they're going to blame the non-vaccinated except now because there's still real scientists
[3:45:43.680 --> 3:45:48.000]  that's coming out that it's the unvaccinated who actually aren't sick and it's the vaccinated
[3:45:48.000 --> 3:45:51.840]  that are sick getting other sick so and i don't see how they square this up i mean now they're
[3:45:51.840 --> 3:45:55.520]  going to use the australian military to enforce lockdowns and now they're talking about forced
[3:45:55.520 --> 3:46:01.840]  populations there that's the beta test australia in the uk this is all globalist uk british empire
[3:46:01.840 --> 3:46:06.480]  these whole roads eugenics crap you know prince phillip prince charles says come back as a virus
[3:46:06.480 --> 3:46:10.800]  to kill the public well they've come back with a virus that's the pretext to kill us with the
[3:46:10.800 --> 3:46:15.600]  vaccines and if they can't get the majority to take the vaccines what are they going to do
[3:46:15.600 --> 3:46:19.040]  when the window when the window those that took it are dying and those that took it are sterilized
[3:46:19.040 --> 3:46:24.160]  and we're all healthy well that's why they develop something that sheds on to us so but but like
[3:46:24.160 --> 3:46:27.600]  you said oh and the wheels are coming off i don't know how they're going to cover this up and what
[3:46:27.600 --> 3:46:34.240]  they're going to do this is just insane i want well and and perhaps the most insane part of it
[3:46:34.240 --> 3:46:39.280]  is you'd think that all humans would be in this together and that's why we have to recognize and
[3:46:39.280 --> 3:46:44.720]  accept this crazy reality now like you said earlier these are just meatbags possessed by satan these
[3:46:44.720 --> 3:46:51.120]  are just demonically possessed meatbags hopping around telling you to wear a mask telling you
[3:46:51.120 --> 3:46:58.560]  to take the vaccine and you can't even sit here with basic common sense to say hey look man
[3:46:58.560 --> 3:47:03.680]  you've been vaccinated why do i need to be vaccinated hey man you're wearing your mask
[3:47:03.680 --> 3:47:08.720]  why don't you feel it protects you because because in that denial they're admitting they know the
[3:47:08.720 --> 3:47:12.560]  vaccine doesn't work they're admitting they know the mask doesn't work they're admitting they know
[3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:19.120]  this is a giant social experiment you're absolutely right and some of them are basically turned over
[3:47:19.120 --> 3:47:25.680]  to evil others believe in virtue signaling because they believe emotion is reality they believe
[3:47:25.680 --> 3:47:31.520]  perception is reality which it isn't so when they reflect that they're good and they're virtuous
[3:47:31.520 --> 3:47:36.800]  they are believing the fantasy just like michael rapaport the question is how do we separate people
[3:47:36.800 --> 3:47:41.280]  from the demons from those that are in the simulation and believe virtue signaling is
[3:47:41.280 --> 3:47:46.800]  actually real you see what i'm saying well the challenge i think is just one that we have to
[3:47:46.800 --> 3:47:53.520]  give to god i don't think that our humanly flesh and soul can can even do that i think that we
[3:47:53.520 --> 3:47:59.200]  have to give that to god and just ask for serenity and and just go about our lives and realize that
[3:47:59.200 --> 3:48:02.880]  there's going to be people that can't be saved and don't want to be saved and maybe perhaps never
[3:48:02.880 --> 3:48:07.600]  meant to be saved and and and you look at the situation like you said with michael rapaport
[3:48:07.600 --> 3:48:12.320]  there's a guy who looked like he was amongst the worst of the establishment hacks amongst the worst
[3:48:12.320 --> 3:48:18.000]  of the liberal leftist liars but now even he's kind of having this realization like wait a second
[3:48:18.000 --> 3:48:23.600]  i was lied to about the vaccine i was lied to about the notions with this vaccine and in that
[3:48:23.600 --> 3:48:29.920]  process can his mind be open and for all the others that may be in the similar situation is
[3:48:29.920 --> 3:48:34.800]  michael rapaport can their minds be open and then they realize hey wait a second if they lied to me
[3:48:34.800 --> 3:48:39.680]  about the vaccine what else have they lied to me about did they lie to me about covid did they lie
[3:48:39.680 --> 3:48:43.520]  me about trump did they lie to me about the election they lied to me about this and maybe
[3:48:43.520 --> 3:48:48.880]  that's their awakening process if it's possible and the only way they can get away with this is
[3:48:48.880 --> 3:48:53.040]  gaspotting everybody and shutting us down and silencing us but that has failed that's why the
