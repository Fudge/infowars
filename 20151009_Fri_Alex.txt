[01:30.240 --> 01:38.520]  French news agency AFP that the Pope warned bishops when he was in the United States and when he
[01:38.520 --> 01:45.160]  was at the Vatican of the conspiracy theorist besieging it claiming that they're promoting
[01:45.160 --> 01:50.520]  world government communism the end of the family which is what they're doing publicly so the Pope
[01:50.520 --> 01:55.520]  has joined forces and says don't be involved in that type of thought basically saying it's a thought
[01:55.520 --> 02:02.840]  crime to believe there's any powerful groups or that any power has an agenda if you believe
[02:02.840 --> 02:08.360]  oxygen is what animals live off of as well your conspiracy theorist so this is the church saying

[14:16.920 --> 14:22.600]  com then we've got this little jewel so many of it on salazar's articles come out in the
[14:22.600 --> 14:26.800]  morning and get a lot of attention that's the time to launch news obviously but because
[14:26.800 --> 14:33.000]  of we don't hold news back you post a lot of stuff at five six o'clock at night the story
[14:33.000 --> 14:40.280]  has gone viral i want to get it posted back to the front page of info wars dot com this
[14:40.280 --> 14:45.960]  is this is on the local tv this is in the local newspaper and then they're defending
[14:45.960 --> 14:54.960]  it though they're saying this is good no whites allowed seattle yoga class for people of color
[14:54.960 --> 15:07.520]  excludes caucasians white friends allies and partners are respectfully asked not to attend
[15:07.520 --> 15:15.920]  it you know i think the civil rights act has been twisted i mean i think of the cuckluck's
[15:15.920 --> 15:20.360]  clan wants to be able to have a private meeting of just white people they should be able to
[15:20.360 --> 15:23.520]  if the new black panther party wants to if you want to have an all black golf course
[15:23.520 --> 15:28.160]  and all white golf course that's your issue if you don't want to get that business if
[15:28.160 --> 15:32.520]  you want to hang on the door you know that now the issue is you can't have city and state
[15:32.520 --> 15:38.840]  laws saying that that's what's discriminatory that's what's illegal i'm i'm fully against
[15:38.840 --> 15:43.960]  state federal local laws doing that but if you want to have a church that's all black
[15:43.960 --> 15:51.600]  or all hispanic or all asian or all transvestite or whatever the case is all uh bastion hound
[15:51.600 --> 15:55.720]  owners i mean just whatever all people that wear Santa Claus outfits i mean it could be
[15:55.720 --> 16:04.280]  anything people wear clown outfits whatever lucky charms outfits my little pony outfits
[16:04.280 --> 16:08.400]  that's your mentally ill issue you want to be in a space cult that believes in stuff
[16:08.400 --> 16:15.080]  you take peyote every week that's your issue that's protected on the first amendment but
[16:15.080 --> 16:20.720]  the reason this is important is remember they find all that money was it first ten thousand
[16:20.720 --> 16:28.280]  and a hundred plus thousand you pull it up i'm going from memory that cake shop in washington
[16:28.280 --> 16:32.680]  that didn't want to put the two men on the cake or whatever and they're christians and
[16:32.680 --> 16:36.400]  that's their religion and i think they have a right to do that whether you agree with
[16:36.400 --> 16:42.680]  or disagree with it you have a right to go support the business be a patron of the place
[16:42.680 --> 16:47.480]  that won't do whatever you want that's what free market is we vote with our choices with
[16:47.480 --> 16:56.000]  our purchases um i'll just be honest i never even thought of stuff like this i'm so fundamentally
[16:56.000 --> 17:01.120]  classically liberal um that even though i don't like the assault on marriage and the
[17:01.120 --> 17:06.080]  stuff that's going on if i owned a cake shop i wouldn't be discriminating against anything
[17:06.080 --> 17:09.280]  now i wouldn't fill out a cake saying i'm going to kill you and your family and then
[17:09.280 --> 17:13.520]  say their name and show their house and their address as some threat to put it on somebody's
[17:13.520 --> 17:17.920]  porch i mean i guess i would there's been incidences of stuff like that i've read about
[17:17.920 --> 17:23.400]  i wouldn't put out any cakes calling for killing certain individuals but somebody want to make
[17:23.400 --> 17:28.480]  a cake showing them marrying their dog i mean that really you got money on the barrel head
[17:28.480 --> 17:39.880]  i'm not going to be sitting there micromanaging stuff but the issue is they are selectively
[17:39.880 --> 17:47.240]  enforcing against christians conservatives libertarians people of that like the yoga
[17:47.240 --> 17:53.000]  studio in seattle it's a pretty big one has been accused of promoting racial discrimination
[17:53.000 --> 18:01.280]  will know they have by holding special sessions with explicitly excluding whites rainier beach
[18:01.280 --> 18:07.520]  yoga in seattle has allowed quote five queer people of color to create a special class
[18:07.520 --> 18:12.600]  identified entitled younger people of color an exclusionary yoga session which they want
[18:12.600 --> 18:17.720]  to expand of course whose rules expressly forbid white people from attending that's close quote
[18:17.720 --> 18:25.040]  reports k i r o radio and i've already seen this in local news being defended well they've
[18:25.040 --> 18:29.440]  been discriminating against so they have a right to have this hey i think you do have
[18:29.440 --> 18:36.840]  a right to it but you see the way it's been enforced selectively with huge fines against
[18:36.840 --> 18:41.000]  folks that wouldn't make cakes in seattle and surrounding areas and you know a men's
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.360]  barber shop that won't cut a woman's hair then we need whites to go in there try to
[18:46.360 --> 18:52.880]  be part of the class and sue them don't don't think seattle is going to come to your aid
[18:52.880 --> 18:59.480]  and find them though see four legs good two legs bad then it's four legs good two legs
[18:59.480 --> 19:05.400]  good to then four legs bad to get two legs good if the pigs are walking on two legs
[19:05.400 --> 19:09.880]  that of course is animal farm tour jarwell's other book the fiction book they're they're
[19:09.880 --> 19:14.440]  both fiction you wrote a bunch of nonfiction but 1984 and animal farmer is best known and
[19:14.440 --> 19:19.520]  you read that that's exactly how the talitarianism ends and the big workhorse who's enforced
[19:19.520 --> 19:26.920]  the tyranny done most of the work been subservient to the pigs finally when he's old and hurt
[19:26.920 --> 19:32.520]  they sell him to be turned into glue but he still defends them as he rides away to be
[19:32.520 --> 19:40.040]  killed that's the bernie sanders hillary clinton type moron voter that's the blue collar working
[19:40.040 --> 19:46.040]  democrat that just can't get it through their head or the blue blood republican supporter
[19:46.040 --> 19:49.640]  who thinks they're part of the establishment as they go to the country club and you know
[19:49.640 --> 19:53.880]  go eat dinner with the congressman once a year it's all coming up the pope warrants
[19:53.880 --> 20:00.240]  against conspiracy theories of the new world order oh because most of us already know that
[20:00.240 --> 20:04.280]  taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega threes is a good idea but did you know that
[20:04.280 --> 20:08.120]  about 60 percent of americans are actually deficient in omega threes did you know that
[20:08.120 --> 20:12.360]  most fish oil products contain only about 25 percent omega threes and the remaining
[20:12.360 --> 20:17.000]  75 percent is undesirable fish fat heck did you know that more than 90 percent of fish

[24:38.360 --> 24:46.680]  theories. Don't listen to this conspiracy cult. Don't get into a conspiratorial mindset.
[24:46.680 --> 24:53.400]  Trust us. And we've seen Obama give countless speeches saying, don't give up on government.
[24:53.400 --> 24:58.080]  Don't give up the faith. That's an actual quote that he and Biden have put out in just
[24:58.080 --> 25:03.160]  countless speeches that we've covered here. But it got picked up by the Associated Press,
[25:03.160 --> 25:09.160]  New York Times, AFP. I'm not joking. This is a real headline. Hope warns against conspiracy
[25:09.160 --> 25:17.080]  theories of Vatican Skull Duggery. And it says that he met in secret with the Global
[25:17.080 --> 25:23.160]  Catholic Church, meaning with the top bishops and cardinals. Vatican spokesman Frederico
[25:23.160 --> 25:28.800]  Lombardi admitted last night confirming reports of the pontiff and warned Catholic bishops
[25:28.800 --> 25:35.560]  and cardinals behind closed doors on Tuesday. And then again, we now learn when he was here,
[25:35.560 --> 25:41.600]  not to get caught up in the hermetic of conspiracy. The phrase better translated as conspiracy
[25:41.600 --> 25:46.560]  theories or the conspiratorial mentality comes to mind concerns within the conservative camp
[25:46.560 --> 25:56.520]  that new mythology or methodology being used in the three week SYNOD approved by Francis
[25:56.520 --> 26:02.280]  favors the liberal wing who want the church to be more welcoming to homosexuals and remarried
[26:02.280 --> 26:09.120]  divorce couples. So everybody knows the pubs pushing world government carbon taxes, the
[26:09.120 --> 26:15.200]  socialist liberal wing, the gay wing of the Catholic Church. I mean, that's that's admitted.
[26:15.200 --> 26:22.360]  So now it's a conspiracy theory to voice a concern and form a movement saying this doesn't
[26:22.360 --> 26:32.560]  follow original Catholic Christian dogma canons ideas. The answer is nothing's happening.
[26:32.560 --> 26:37.240]  Raising the debt doesn't raise the debt. You can keep your doctor. No one's coming after
[26:37.240 --> 26:46.920]  your guns two plus two equals five. Don't question us sleep, sleep or Count Dracula
[26:46.920 --> 26:53.600]  saying to von Helsing, come here. You have a strong will for one who's only lived one
[26:53.600 --> 27:03.520]  life. Come here. And they're saying there is nothing happening. There are no open borders.
[27:03.520 --> 27:10.680]  There is no world government. The dollar is not being devalued. There are no armored vehicles
[27:10.680 --> 27:17.680]  or cameras. There is no police state. There are not 40 million illegals porting into the
[27:17.680 --> 27:29.560]  United States getting free health care. That's not unfair. Do not do not awaken. Trust us.
[27:29.560 --> 27:40.400]  There is no organization in power. Power does not seek power. Sleep. You are becoming sleepy
[27:40.400 --> 27:50.160]  my dear. Lay in your bed. Open your nightgown and show me your neck. Nosferatu loves you.
[27:50.160 --> 27:58.240]  I mean this is truly them panicking. Saying trust us. Trust us. Keep under the spell.
[27:58.240 --> 28:02.080]  The spell is breaking. The spell is breaking. They're going to find out everything master.
[28:02.080 --> 28:10.760]  I know. We love you. We love you. Trendy, liberal. Look, Caitlyn Jenner. Look, Jay-Z. That's
[28:10.760 --> 28:21.240]  not working. Look, look, Miley Cyrus or whatever her name is. NFL, NFL. Oh, there's conspiracies
[28:21.240 --> 28:27.440]  with deflate a gate, but there's no conspiracies with the Vatican with its 177 million acres
[28:27.440 --> 28:32.880]  and hundreds of trillions of dollars saying middle class Americans should not be evil
[28:32.880 --> 28:38.440]  and should pay more taxes and bring illegals into our houses. How about you don't tell
[28:38.440 --> 28:46.320]  us that? How about our conscience tells us that Pope Francis? Remember that quote from
[28:46.320 --> 28:54.880]  Stripes? My name's Psycho. You call me Francis again? I'll kill you. All right, Francis.
[28:54.880 --> 29:02.440]  I mean, it's really getting old. So they're just desperate. Obama, these conspiracy theorists,
[29:02.440 --> 29:09.480]  these whacked out cooks, not coming after your guns. He's going to announce it today.
[29:09.480 --> 29:14.720]  The bells are being introduced tomorrow or on Monday. Obama weighs expanding background
[29:14.720 --> 29:21.280]  checks through executive authority. The Washington Post in response to the latest mass shooting
[29:21.280 --> 29:27.000]  during his presidency, President Obama is seriously considering circumventing Congress.
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.640]  Oh, that's called dictatorship. It's calmly in the paper with his executive authority.
[29:31.640 --> 29:36.040]  That's called dictatorship and imposing new background checks requirements for buyers
[29:36.040 --> 29:41.000]  who purchase firearms from high volume gun dealers. That's not even where he got this.
[29:41.000 --> 29:45.840]  We'll give you the rest of the story. He's coming after Social Security recipients, veterans
[29:45.840 --> 29:53.280]  and more. Stay with us. We're on the March. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the
[29:53.280 --> 30:05.240]  GCN radio network. No whites allowed. A yoga studio in Seattle is promoting racial discrimination
[30:05.240 --> 30:12.080]  by holding special sessions that explicitly excludes whites. Rainier Beach Yoga in Seattle
[30:12.080 --> 30:19.440]  has created a special class called Yoga for People of Color, an exclusionary yoga session
[30:19.440 --> 30:25.280]  whose rules expressly forbid white people. An email blast from the yoga studio says
[30:25.280 --> 30:32.000]  white friends, allies and partners are respectfully asked not to attend. The class also invites
[30:32.000 --> 30:38.080]  lesbian, bisexual, gay, queer and trans friendly people, but no whites allowed. I wonder what
[30:38.080 --> 30:43.920]  would happen if the roles were reversed? And there was a yoga class for whites only. I'm
[30:43.920 --> 30:48.880]  sure the liberals across the country would be outraged and the mainstream media would
[30:48.880 --> 30:54.000]  make it a national story. And you can learn more about this story and more right now at

[33:20.560 --> 33:49.400]  You want to go toe-to-toe? Up against 21st century tyranny? Against extremely sophisticated
[33:49.400 --> 34:00.760]  forms of societal takeover? You can hear the war drums of the globalists.
[34:00.760 --> 34:19.360]  Look at this one article. Over 40 rodents, over 40 rodent feeding studies show GM food
[34:19.360 --> 34:26.680]  is disastrous to health. This is what's really killing mammals, including humans, and here's
[34:26.680 --> 34:37.120]  what the studies show, increased intestinal infections when they were fed BT GM feed that
[34:37.120 --> 34:46.200]  humans are fed. High cholesterol, birth defects, weight increase, and higher incidence of mortality,
[34:46.200 --> 34:53.520]  organ pathologies in the liver, kidneys, pancreases, ovaries, testicles, and adrenals, major issues
[34:53.520 --> 34:59.480]  with both the intestinal tracts and immunity of the animals tested. Then it goes over 40
[34:59.480 --> 35:05.080]  mainline university and governmental studies. Just thought I'd mention what's really killing
[35:05.080 --> 35:10.880]  us. Or the 300,000 killed the last four and a half years, estimated by the UN itself in
[35:10.880 --> 35:19.480]  Syria, most of them by the Syrian opposition rebels who are al-Nazra al-Qaeda ISIS. So
[35:19.480 --> 35:29.240]  Obama arms rebels to launch a war and overthrows Libya and overthrows for over a year our ally
[35:29.240 --> 35:35.200]  Egypt and has Christians crucified upside down and funds it all to the Muslim brotherhood
[35:35.200 --> 35:42.640]  in Kenya. Gets his cousin appointed prime minister in a radical Muslim takeover there.
[35:42.640 --> 35:47.880]  I mean, the globalists are really using this Muslim card big time and folks know I'm no
[35:47.880 --> 35:53.600]  Islamophobe. I wasn't on that train 15 years ago, five years ago, but the globalists are
[35:53.600 --> 35:59.760]  going with it. It's incredibly bold. We've been neutralized via political correctness
[35:59.760 --> 36:06.520]  and don't even know how to respond now. We have another campus shooting in Northern Arizona
[36:06.520 --> 36:14.280]  University. One dead, three injured. A fight broke out so it's more gang between two groups
[36:14.280 --> 36:19.320]  of students at Northern Arizona University Flagstaff campus, leaving one dead and three
[36:19.320 --> 36:25.440]  hospitalization. Yes, there are 167 on average. Some years is more, some less, but the average,
[36:25.440 --> 36:31.360]  look it up. Just departments own numbers. 167 people die year in mass shootings, 200
[36:31.360 --> 36:36.280]  plus in deer jumping in front of your car, 300 from honeybees, 300 plus from rattlesnakes.
[36:36.280 --> 36:43.620]  It's got to be over 400 plus with water moccasins. It's incredible. Tens of thousands falling
[36:43.620 --> 36:51.760]  in the shower. Do you see the president grandstanding over all of that? No, they want the individuals
[36:51.760 --> 36:58.240]  right to fight a military police state takeover. They want you to live like South Side Chicago,
[36:58.240 --> 37:08.240]  New York or DC with the highest crime rates in the world. DC and places like Chicago
[37:08.240 --> 37:14.280]  are some of the highest in the world. Just search Chicago highest crime rate in the world.
[37:14.280 --> 37:21.720]  Search DC second highest crime rate in the world. America's mass shooting capital is Chicago.
[37:21.720 --> 37:28.600]  That's the daily beast. Well, actually, it's the world capital. Let's get even more arrogant
[37:28.600 --> 37:34.400]  here. Don't just have the US title, have the world title worse than Mexico, who has the
[37:34.400 --> 37:40.440]  title for a country of the most violent with total gunbands in the citizen's hands. You
[37:40.440 --> 37:48.320]  see cops everywhere with machine guns, the North, South, the East, the West, up and everywhere
[37:48.320 --> 37:57.880]  in Mexico. And they have a total gun ban and they have the highest gun crime in the world.
[37:57.880 --> 38:03.720]  Now covering Obama's visit to Roseburg are Jacarie Jackson and his camera person. And
[38:03.720 --> 38:10.760]  then of course, we have Joe Biggs and his camera person. And I'm going to challenge
[38:10.760 --> 38:14.720]  if they're able to do it, Jacarie and Joe Biggs, whatever it takes, it's legal and
[38:14.720 --> 38:20.080]  lawful to get questions into Obama, questions into their minions, but really be, you know,
[38:20.080 --> 38:24.400]  how dare you cover up the numbers and use the deaths of these people to sell gun control.
[38:24.400 --> 38:29.040]  We just get that out and call these people out or whatever, you know, comes up from
[38:29.040 --> 38:34.720]  the mind of the gut of Jacarie or Joe Biggs. And Joe is getting in position right now
[38:34.720 --> 38:39.280]  where he said we've got him split up to cover Obama landing in the next two and a half hours.
[38:39.280 --> 38:45.920]  And then his procession and there's over 10,000 people reportedly on Facebook now was 6,000
[38:45.920 --> 38:51.520]  a few days ago saying they're coming there from all over Oregon and Washington and Northern
[38:51.520 --> 38:57.200]  California to say, look, you're not welcome in Roseburg. The school head has said it's
[38:57.200 --> 39:02.280]  baloney. The sheriff has said that the families, I think it's seven of the 10 families have
[39:02.280 --> 39:08.360]  come out saying don't come feed off our dead Christian family members. You know why it's
[39:08.360 --> 39:12.200]  all mainly conservatives that have these family members because they were executed for being
[39:12.200 --> 39:18.840]  Christian. But notice that's not the media. They took a guy that was part black part white,
[39:20.040 --> 39:23.880]  made his nose smaller, his lips smaller and made him as white as a ghost, literally,
[39:24.840 --> 39:28.040]  so they could say it was, you know, some type of white attack to make it racial.
[39:29.640 --> 39:34.280]  That's the sick agenda. And here it is, Obama ways expanding background checks
[39:34.280 --> 39:38.840]  through executive authority, Washington Post, in response to the latest mass shooting during
[39:38.840 --> 39:44.200]  his presidency, not in response, he's using it. President Obama is seriously considering
[39:44.200 --> 39:51.640]  circumventing Congress key term, circumventing the lawmakers, circumventing the branch of government
[39:51.640 --> 39:56.200]  that's called dictatorship with his executive. When an executive circumvents the checks and
[39:56.200 --> 40:00.920]  balances, it's called a dictatorship. Let me read it all without without adding to it in response
[40:00.920 --> 40:05.560]  to the latest mass shooting during his presidency. President Obama is seriously considering circumventing
[40:05.560 --> 40:11.480]  Congress with his executive authority and imposing new background check requirements for buyers
[40:11.480 --> 40:17.560]  who purchase weapons from high volume gun dealers. They've announced they're going to ban
[40:17.560 --> 40:21.800]  of imports. They're going to go after bullets with taxes. They're going to put Social Security
[40:21.800 --> 40:25.560]  recipients on no gun by list and then they have to turn their guns in. That's been announced
[40:25.560 --> 40:30.120]  mainstream news LA Times. They're announcing that they're going to go after guns that weren't
[40:30.120 --> 40:36.120]  registered previous to this. This is the beginning of the confiscation. They've practiced in New York,
[40:36.120 --> 40:43.400]  DC, areas of California. So they're coming and they admit this is their biggest push ever.
[40:43.400 --> 40:47.640]  Meanwhile, the meme that Drudge helped put out that was already there, but he helped magnified
[40:47.640 --> 40:55.160]  here on Tuesday, has been picked up by WorldNet Daily. It's been picked up by Washington Times.
[40:55.160 --> 41:01.080]  It's been picked up by the New York Post. It's been picked up by a bunch of publications.
[41:03.480 --> 41:09.400]  And that's the point. Point out the hypocrisy. Armed Guards protect Senate Democrats as they
[41:09.400 --> 41:15.960]  demand new gun control laws, Washington Times. Obama, stay out of Roseburg, Oregon, special
[41:15.960 --> 41:22.120]  report by John Bown. That's excellent. Up on infowars.com. Pass that around on Facebook.
[41:22.120 --> 41:27.400]  Pass that around on Twitter. Everywhere they go, these Bloomberg people to push taking our guns
[41:27.400 --> 41:32.840]  and blaming us for the incredibly rare mass shooting that they seize on every four or five
[41:32.840 --> 41:37.960]  months when it happens. Hoping it causes a mental illness cascade and copycat shootings.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.920]  Another big report from the New American. Gun free zones contribute to mass slaying,
[41:42.920 --> 41:45.880]  say experts. Very important article to get out to folks.
[41:45.880 --> 41:55.720]  We now go to Oregon in Roseburg with Jacarie Jackson on the scene. And it looks like a lot
[41:55.720 --> 42:01.240]  of protesters have already shown up with no Obama. Jacarie Jackson on the very front lines of the
[42:01.240 --> 42:06.760]  battle for the right to keep and bear arms and defend ourselves against criminals in government
[42:06.760 --> 42:11.800]  and on the street. Jacarie Jackson on the front lines of the battle for America. That's what this
[42:11.800 --> 42:17.240]  is folks. Jacarie Jackson, you've been there a few hours since last night. What are your observations
[42:17.240 --> 42:22.600]  and how big do you think this rally is going to be today? Jacarie Jackson reporting from Roseburg,
[42:22.600 --> 42:26.920]  Oregon. We're right in front of the regional airport here. As you can see, we've got probably about
[42:26.920 --> 42:31.560]  50 or so demonstrators out here. Now, Alex, you asked me the question how many people are expected
[42:31.560 --> 42:36.200]  to come out here between this place and other rallies around town or around the area. They're
[42:36.200 --> 42:41.080]  expecting around 7000 people or so. That's how many people have signed up on the Facebook pages.
[42:41.080 --> 42:45.480]  Now, this is one of the locations where they're anticipating President Obama to arrive in his
[42:45.480 --> 42:49.160]  helicopter. Of course, it's a secret service. They want to keep all that stuff hush hush. This
[42:49.160 --> 42:53.800]  is one of the places where people anticipate he may land and the people are definitely ready to
[42:53.800 --> 42:57.800]  demonstrate and share their opinions of them. Like you can see right over my shoulder, the no
[42:57.800 --> 43:02.120]  Obama. Many people share this opinion. In the short time we've been here, probably been here
[43:02.120 --> 43:05.880]  about 20 minutes or so. We've had many people come up and say, thank you guys for being here.
[43:05.880 --> 43:10.200]  We don't want this shooting to be exploited. We don't want these guys to stand on the grave
[43:10.200 --> 43:13.880]  of our loved ones to come out here and push their agenda. Because people understand, Alex,
[43:13.880 --> 43:17.560]  even when we were at the rental car place a little bit ago, we were talking to the girl who
[43:17.560 --> 43:21.480]  worked the front desk and she said, yeah, I mean, I don't want to see all these mass shootings either,
[43:21.480 --> 43:26.120]  but I'm a single mom. You know, I have kids. I need to protect myself if somebody breaks it to
[43:26.120 --> 43:30.360]  my house. If I'm walking down the street, I mean, she referenced being someone of a concealed carrier
[43:30.360 --> 43:33.960]  and she was fine with that. And that's the thing that people need to understand. Alex is not going
[43:33.960 --> 43:38.760]  to be a secret service detail, a sniper on the roof for everybody in the United States of America.
[43:38.760 --> 43:43.720]  Obama has it. Hillary has it. Bloomberg has his bodyguards, but not you or I. So that's why
[43:43.720 --> 43:47.160]  people want to come out here and demonstrate and let people know that they need to have the
[43:47.160 --> 43:51.720]  means to defend themselves. As you know, Jacari, one of the hallmarks, but we've got to get this
[43:51.720 --> 43:55.560]  talking point out to everybody that doesn't understand it. Governors have to understand,
[43:55.560 --> 43:59.640]  we know this, but the general public still doesn't completely, though the polls show we're
[43:59.640 --> 44:05.960]  starting to win. We haven't committed a crime. Jacari hasn't. I haven't. That woman you rented
[44:05.960 --> 44:12.200]  the car from hasn't. She's a single mom. She has a right to protect herself. She has a right to not
[44:12.200 --> 44:19.160]  live in fear. And how dare them project what some mentally ill pillhead did onto her. You or I,
[44:19.160 --> 44:24.040]  that is a hallmark of the salitarianism to say, because one person does something,
[44:24.040 --> 44:30.600]  everybody else is guilty. They had six guys stab and kill over a hundred people, kill 50 of them,
[44:30.600 --> 44:36.840]  you know, a few weeks ago in China. And it didn't even really make the news because it was knives.
[44:36.840 --> 44:42.680]  Do we ban knife owners for the fact that that happened, Jacari? Well, it's just like you said,
[44:42.680 --> 44:47.400]  Alex, we saw who was an Elia Roger on California. He shot people. He stabbed people. He ran people
[44:47.400 --> 44:51.800]  over with his car, but the only thing they tried to ban was the fire on. It's completely ridiculous.
[44:51.800 --> 44:56.680]  You know, a couple of weeks ago, a mother drowned two of her twin children in the four inch bath
[44:56.680 --> 45:01.720]  water. Nobody cried to ban bath touch. People understood that this was a mentally ill individual
[45:01.720 --> 45:06.360]  and banning bath water or water in general was not going to do anything to solve this problem.
[45:06.360 --> 45:10.120]  And when we see these types of crimes committed with things that aren't guns, people understand
[45:10.120 --> 45:14.360]  this, but as soon as a firearm comes into play, the blanket response is just to ban everything,
[45:14.360 --> 45:18.680]  usually from people who have high gun ownership themselves, whether they have it personally or
[45:18.680 --> 45:23.560]  bodyguards. Now, Jacari, obviously, when we put you guys in the field, you just give us your
[45:23.560 --> 45:27.720]  commentary and analysis live on air. You go out and shoot interviews, special reports. You're
[45:27.720 --> 45:31.400]  going to try to talk to some of the victims, family members that have already gone public, saying
[45:31.400 --> 45:35.720]  not in our name, Obama, don't use our dead family members. You're going to talk to some of the folks
[45:35.720 --> 45:40.680]  that were witnesses, obviously, that if you can, how he was executing Christians, because we are
[45:40.680 --> 45:45.880]  not the alternative media. We are the media filling the vacuum. You're going to be talking to man on
[45:45.880 --> 45:51.560]  the street, woman on the street, you're going to be documenting Obama's arrival. But when I say this,
[45:51.560 --> 45:58.120]  I'm not being sarcastic. I'm showing how absurd the absurdist view is to blame gun owners
[45:59.080 --> 46:06.040]  for criminals committing crimes. Caitlyn Jenner ran over people, you know, and reportedly killed
[46:06.040 --> 46:13.560]  somebody with their car. And so should we ban trannies because a tranny killed somebody? Or
[46:13.560 --> 46:19.800]  should we ban cars because of Caitlyn Jenner? I mean, that's how ridiculous this is, Jacari.
[46:19.800 --> 46:24.920]  Well, we see just like if they try to paint this, this recent shooter here in Oregon, you know,
[46:24.920 --> 46:28.280]  like you said before, they try to make him a white guy trying to make it some type of white
[46:28.280 --> 46:32.680]  supremacist deal. Didn't want to mention the fact that he was targeting Christians and doing all the
[46:32.680 --> 46:36.840]  other things that he did, but had a supposed Christian went out and committed this crime.
[46:36.840 --> 46:40.440]  It had been the war in Christianity. We can't have all these Christians coming out and doing
[46:40.440 --> 46:44.920]  these type of things. And we see these things repeated over and over and over again. They
[46:44.920 --> 46:48.760]  always want to frame the narrative, the Zarnay brothers, you know, they try to come out and say
[46:48.760 --> 46:53.560]  that they were right wing Muslim extremists. You know, that's as ridiculous as you can get.
[46:53.560 --> 46:57.480]  But anything they can to push their agenda, I don't think I wouldn't put in pass them to do it.
[46:58.600 --> 47:03.560]  Jacari, I want to give you a few minutes to go down towards that crowd
[47:03.560 --> 47:07.320]  when we go to break. And I want to come back and talk for a little while with those folks.
[47:07.320 --> 47:12.440]  Then we're going to talk to Joe Biggs as well. And then I'll let you guys get out there and
[47:12.440 --> 47:16.600]  start getting your reports out. But this is obviously really important. You're there to
[47:16.600 --> 47:21.560]  ring the alarm that they're coming for our guns. We knew this was coming. Congressional insiders
[47:21.560 --> 47:27.000]  told us they were coming. This is the big push. We warned people. The good news is gun sales are
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.600]  up. Ammo sales are up. They always are. Every time one of these things happen, people understand
[47:32.600 --> 47:36.200]  that it's not the firearm. It's not the ammunition. It's the person with the ill intent.
[47:36.760 --> 47:42.520]  Jacari, let's pan around there with your cameraman and kind of narrate for the radio listeners
[47:42.520 --> 47:47.560]  what the topography is like in Roseburg. You say 50 people. Looks like more are now arriving.
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.880]  Yeah, they've been steadily arriving the whole time we've been here. As you can see,
[47:52.440 --> 47:56.440]  the beautiful mountains out here in the distance, this is right in front of the regional airport.
[47:57.240 --> 48:01.400]  It's a pretty wide open space. I would imagine they have some type of wild game.
[48:01.960 --> 48:06.280]  And this is why you need a second amendment. Just like we saw CJ Grissom down in Texas,
[48:06.280 --> 48:09.240]  he lived in an area where they had some wild game. He was walking down the street and said,
[48:09.240 --> 48:13.080]  hey, I need a firearm to protect myself. You know, some wild hog or something comes out here
[48:13.080 --> 48:17.720]  protects my son. And it was totally legal in the middle of nowhere. And they still arrested him.
[48:18.280 --> 48:22.200]  Yeah. Yeah. So people understand it. And that's another good point, Alex, because we
[48:22.200 --> 48:26.680]  always hear these politicians say it's okay for somebody out in the sticks to own a firearm,
[48:26.680 --> 48:29.880]  but they don't even want you to own a firearm. If you live out in the sticks and see CJ Grissom
[48:29.880 --> 48:33.240]  is a perfect point to that. We'll continue to move down here a little bit. There's also,
[48:33.240 --> 48:36.920]  what is this something like eight tours and combat or something ridiculous? Oh, yeah,
[48:36.920 --> 48:42.200]  combat. He recently, I think he'd retired this year. So he is recently retired, but we'll show
[48:42.200 --> 48:45.720]  some of the crowd here. You can see all the people gathering in anticipation.
[48:46.680 --> 48:50.760]  We actually have a gentleman. Did you want to, yes, you want to say you met this guy, Alex?
[48:50.760 --> 48:54.840]  Come on, come on over, bro. All right. So tell us what brought you out here today.
[48:54.840 --> 48:59.800]  Well, I'm from Grants Pass Oregon. I'm just coming out here just to show support for Roseburg and
[48:59.800 --> 49:04.280]  just let Obama know that he's not welcome here. And I think it's disgusting that he's out here
[49:04.280 --> 49:09.400]  trying to politicize his agenda. He doesn't care anything about Roseburg or any of us.
[49:10.120 --> 49:14.360]  He only cares about the people he serves. So there's people out here, plenty of people out
[49:14.360 --> 49:20.360]  here are awake and thanks to Alex Jones. All right. Now, I'm just going to say what it is.
[49:20.360 --> 49:23.480]  A lot of people are going to look at the footage here today and they're going to say this was
[49:23.480 --> 49:28.360]  a racially motivated event. Is it any type of racial deal for you? No, absolutely not. No,
[49:28.360 --> 49:37.480]  no. I don't have a racist bone in my body. You know, I believe God created all people
[49:37.480 --> 49:45.080]  with one blood. And so it's not the skin color is the character. And Obama, he's shown himself
[49:45.080 --> 49:50.280]  to be a lying scumbag many, many times. So we can't trust him and we don't want him here.
[49:50.280 --> 49:56.680]  Just like John Boehner. Yeah. So when you hear people like, whether it's Obama, Hillary,
[49:56.680 --> 50:00.600]  Mayor Bloomberg saying that you shouldn't have a firearm. Meanwhile, they're protected by Secret
[50:00.600 --> 50:05.000]  Service and bodyguards. How does that make you feel? Well, it's total hypocrisy, you know,
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.160]  because, you know, if they, if they have the right to arm themselves and defend themselves,
[50:09.160 --> 50:13.240]  why do they want us to not be able to do the same? You know, if they really care about us,
[50:13.880 --> 50:18.680]  they would support, you know, the Second Amendment for everybody equally. So it shouldn't, it shouldn't
[50:18.680 --> 50:26.760]  be a, you know, unequal thing, you know, so. All right. Well, thank you so much, sir. Awesome. Thanks.
[50:26.760 --> 50:29.560]  Jukari, I know we're about to go to break. Let's come back and talk to some more folks.
[50:29.560 --> 50:33.480]  And we'll get Joe Biggs perspective. Wow, it looks like that crowd has tripled in 10 minutes,
[50:33.480 --> 50:37.800]  Jukari. Yeah, just the short time we've been here, people have been driving by hockey. And as you
[50:37.800 --> 50:43.800]  can see, I guess we can move further down here, more people with their signs. And we have someone
[50:43.800 --> 50:49.000]  here that has pink hair. We'll have to talk to them. I wonder if that's a anti-gunner,
[50:49.880 --> 50:53.000]  probably from a newspaper. Let me just guess, I haven't even seen their face yet, but
[50:53.880 --> 50:58.360]  I don't care if you have bright purple hair, it just generally, well, generally means you like cotton
[50:58.360 --> 51:04.520]  candy. A revolution in body protection has arrived only at FortressSurvivalLLC.com. Introducing the

[52:52.360 --> 53:03.960]  My name is Bill Bonner and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in
[53:03.960 --> 53:10.200]  the world. And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[53:10.200 --> 53:16.520]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about. This change has deep
[53:16.520 --> 53:22.520]  implications for life in America. From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you
[53:22.520 --> 53:29.240]  want to protect. Look, I've made predictions like this before. Thing is, I was right then too.
[53:29.880 --> 53:37.720]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse. They did. Before that, I warned
[53:37.720 --> 53:45.480]  that.com companies would crash. They did. Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[53:45.480 --> 53:49.400]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market. This will affect us all.
[53:49.400 --> 53:57.080]  You can watch the video for free right now by going to dollardanger.com. Again, that's dollardanger.com.
[54:01.720 --> 54:05.560]  Welcome back to the tip of the spear in the fight for the republic and basic human liberty.
[54:05.560 --> 54:11.480]  We are classical liberals like Thomas Jefferson. Today they call that extreme right-wing fascism
[54:11.480 --> 54:19.240]  because we oppose communism. The truth is, we just promote freedom and true free association,
[54:19.240 --> 54:24.200]  free market, and private property. This is an attack on our birthright. They've taken everybody
[54:24.200 --> 54:30.040]  else's guns around the world except in Switzerland. They have the lowest crime rate in the world in
[54:30.040 --> 54:35.480]  Switzerland. They're even more heavily armed than we are. We are a violent society that's part of
[54:35.480 --> 54:41.240]  our frontier culture, our swashbuckling culture, and that's why we need guns to protect ourselves
[54:41.240 --> 54:46.360]  from bad people. And finishing up with Jakari Jackson, he'll be popping in towards the end of
[54:46.360 --> 54:51.800]  the third hour. And then through the fourth hour, as Obama lands, when David Knight is hosting,
[54:52.360 --> 54:57.080]  we'll have live feeds for you back and forth as he prepares to give a speech
[54:57.960 --> 55:03.000]  and try to meet with the victims and others. Almost all of them have refused, but the ghoul
[55:03.000 --> 55:13.640]  is coming there to project the tendead as basically sacrifices to the gun control movement.
[55:14.600 --> 55:19.320]  Martyrs, you could say. Jakari, final comments until we talk to you later on the transmission.
[55:20.120 --> 55:24.040]  Yes, if you want to talk to victims' families, I think you should go down to Mexico and go down
[55:24.040 --> 55:27.400]  to the border and talk to the people killed by the guns from Operation Fast and Furious.
[55:27.400 --> 55:31.000]  I think you should go over there to Syria and talk to the people killed by these
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.480]  al-Qaeda rebels that he continues to arm. But I digress. Alex, we had a gentleman here who had
[55:35.480 --> 55:40.040]  a word that he wanted to speak. Come on in here, sir. So tell us your name and what brought you
[55:40.040 --> 55:47.480]  out here today. My name is George Power. Not the money to her, too. Simply support the people
[55:47.480 --> 55:54.520]  that understand that a gun did not kill the lady of the college. It was a crazy person.
[55:54.520 --> 56:04.520]  And I do think that back in years ago, a president said that to praise the Lord
[56:05.240 --> 56:10.440]  and pass the ammunition, which means that we can have good values,
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.880]  our good American Christian values, and still have guns to protect ourselves.
[56:15.880 --> 56:20.680]  That's right. Because even Jesus said that you need to have a, oh, not a firearm,
[56:20.680 --> 56:23.800]  but a sword to protect yourself. So it's not anything new. I thank you so much.
[56:23.800 --> 56:27.720]  So we're going to move on here to a few other people. Yeah, but the gentleman said it all
[56:27.720 --> 56:32.520]  right there. Alex, people understand it's not anti-Christian to own a firearm. It's just a tool
[56:32.520 --> 56:36.120]  like anything else. We have a nice lady here. Did you have anything that you wanted to share with
[56:36.120 --> 56:41.400]  us, Miss? We need to stand up for our Second Amendment rights and just be here for the people
[56:41.400 --> 56:48.600]  of Roseburg. And Obama needs to leave his politics out of Oregon and out of our country. And I'm
[56:48.600 --> 56:55.320]  just here to stand with our country and stand with everybody else that needs to be out here today.
[56:55.320 --> 57:01.960]  And anyway. All right. And what do you think about the current gun laws in the United States of
[57:01.960 --> 57:06.440]  America? Is there anything in particular that stands out to you? I just believe that people
[57:06.440 --> 57:10.120]  need to hang onto their gun rights and they need to stand up for them because they're going to be,
[57:11.400 --> 57:17.960]  obviously, wants to take them away. And we need to be out here. I don't want to give up my guns.
[57:17.960 --> 57:23.800]  I mean, I want them there in case I need to support and defend my family. Absolutely. She's a free
[57:23.800 --> 57:27.720]  woman. Tell her thank you, Jacare. We're going to jump to break. Thank you. Jacare, great job.
[57:27.720 --> 57:31.320]  We'll talk to you coming up later after the break. We'll talk to Joe Biggs. Thank you, Jacare.
[57:31.320 --> 57:35.240]  Thank you. All right. Out there on a beautiful day in Oregon, wish I was there with him defending
[57:35.240 --> 57:38.680]  the Second Amendment. We'll have live feeds with those guys joining us throughout the day. On the
[57:38.680 --> 57:45.000]  other side of the airport is Joe Biggs and the crew. We'll be talking to him coming up briefly.

[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:43.320]  five days after they passed it in secret releasing the tpp treaty section on intellectual property
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:49.080]  rights and it's scary that's coming up and more obama is to announce circumventing congress
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.280]  that's the washington post headline and what is being called totalitarianism to take our guns
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:01:02.120]  we have two reporters two camera persons two cameramen on the ground in roseburg and we're
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.360]  getting a quick four minute update right now but joe biggs will be back with us first towards the
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:12.840]  end of the third hour and through the fourth hour as obama lands at the base and then comes
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:17.240]  to perch on the dead bodies of those that are showing up joe biggs what are your observations
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:22.600]  since you got in last night yeah we got in around three four o'clock in the morning something like
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:28.760]  that there's a long long long uh flight from uh florida to the portland orgin i can tell you what
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.120]  but uh yeah since we've gotten out here i mean this is definitely one of the most beautiful places
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:37.880]  i've been and as you can see all over the town there's uh you know signs everywhere where everyone's
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:43.720]  you know posting stuff about the shooting uh umka strong signs with a hashtag that's all over the
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:48.520]  whole town and you can see people right over here to my right there's that's where jacari is over here
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:52.600]  the large gathering of people to the left a lot of folks yeah matt can you pan around show everybody
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:58.520]  the full 360 thank you yeah so all that's going on down there here we are behind me is the runway
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:02.600]  where uh the president's supposed to be coming in now the word is he's supposed to land in Eugene
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.640]  and then take a helicopter over here to roseburg and then get out and then go speak to the uh
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:11.480]  families of the victims and like i heard you say earlier the families do not want them here and as
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.800]  i've seen from the signs when we dropped jacari off at the first point there's a lot of people
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:21.000]  here that just don't want him here whatsoever and i mean you can't blame him he's taking a tragedy
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:26.440]  a crazy person who went on a killing spree and he's using it to push his anti-gun agenda
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:31.240]  but completely ignoring the facts uh the new york times just came out with an article uh two days
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:39.720]  ago saying that 60 of deaths by guns in america are suicide but yet the white house the mainstream
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.120]  media wants to portray this whole thing that these mass shootings are everywhere and that
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.680]  happened so much and it's just you know thousands and thousands of people are just dying out of
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.840]  nowhere now well sure that's their talking point and we can't have this happen one more time
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:57.720]  and then it may not happen for three months it may happen twice in one day statistically it's
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:04.840]  incredibly rare i mean the fact is alex we have social media now and this stuff gets shared a lot
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:10.120]  more so it seems like there's this rapid increase in these shootings when quite frankly a lot of
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:14.440]  this stuff's been going on for you know years and years and years we just have access to this
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.160]  information quicker and on the spot and it's able to tug at the hearts and minds of some of the
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:22.920]  people that are quite mindless out there they really don't know the statistical facts about what's
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.440]  going on out there you have a better chance of getting you know killed in a car wreck
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.680]  or you know lung cancer something like that then you do this well of course way way better chance
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:36.120]  you can google right now gun crime down but public thinks it's up you'll get the la times three years
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:45.720]  ago with the statistics it's down 50 plus percent it's plunging because more people are getting guns
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.360]  they that's why they're panicking job well you got to think though the root of the problem is the
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:55.080]  big pharma the fact that we're pushing all these psychotropic drugs these srs or ssi all this stuff
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:01.000]  we're pushing all these drugs on people and there's an adverse reaction to that you flip out on that
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.160]  stuff when i was in the military when you take these things it makes you go crazy and by the way
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.640]  you weren't diagnosed with anything that's important they just ordered you all to take this stuff
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:13.560]  you i mean you've you've you've testified that before to again get you into the system but stay
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.800]  there come back and finish up with your points joe but again i want to be clear here you're
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:23.000]  absolutely right the only type of shooting this up out of all the spectrums is since the nineties
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.280]  the rise of people on ssri's and i'm not saying everybody on ssri's bad i'm not saying it's even
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:35.240]  bad for everybody it is toxic but a certain percentage the insert says makes you go psycho
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:40.440]  and kill people i mean the insert says it joe you're absolutely right joe biggs on an incredibly
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:47.080]  beautiful vista man i love origan i love love origan i love washington i'm envious how about
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:52.280]  the air is crisp out there buddy yes sir it is this is my first time to origan and quite frankly

[01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:03.960]  prison 2016 i mean stay there no whites allowed a yoga studio in seattle is promoting racial
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:11.160]  discrimination by holding special sessions that explicitly excludes whites rainier beach yoga
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:18.840]  in seattle has created a special class called yoga for people of color an exclusionary yoga
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:25.480]  session whose rules expressly forbid white people an email blast from the yoga studio says white
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:32.360]  friends allies and partners are respectfully asked not to attend the class also invites lesbian
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:38.600]  bisexual gay queer and trans friendly people but no whites allowed hmm i wonder what would happen
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:45.080]  if the roles were reversed and there was a yoga class for whites only i'm sure the liberals across
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:51.000]  the country would be outraged and the mainstream media would make it a national story and you

[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:19.640]  ratified a new treaty on monday it's been secret for two years but the final version is still secret
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:26.600]  from we the people it's called a conspiracy against us but the wiki leaks has leaked it
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:31.400]  and so we're going to be looking at that and more we have a detailed report
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:39.320]  um by Kit Daniels about to go up to info wars.com we have our reporters on the ground in roseburg
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.800]  where obama will be arriving in about t-minus two hours he tends to be a little bit late so i would
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:49.720]  guess it'll be in the middle of the fourth hour today hosted by david night we've always done
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:54.920]  three hours here we're now doing a fourth hour of radio slash tv with a david night and the rest of

[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:09.240]  report dot com in the middle column it's the second story at info wars.com with 5 000 comments no

[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:24.680]  is the left you go to facebook you go to local paper is now defending this an all white yoga
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:32.120]  class they say is illegal but in all minority which is the majority now in most areas group is okay
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:38.680]  only the white caucasian is bad of course that's the opposite of what martin wither king said but
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:44.440]  this is all about racial takeover now the democrats have a strategy to win when whites
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.440]  were the majority they ran the clan and ran things that way when the republicans broke that
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.920]  strategy under eisenhower they flipped the script and that's why they're still in charge
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:58.360]  they also control the republican leadership via blackmail as well and we have mccarthy having
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:04.200]  to step down that's a big victory there is a major fight the media spending it like republicans are
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:10.120]  weak because they're having a leadership battle this is what you're supposed to have in government
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.520]  when when a congress has a nine percent approval rating something's wrong when republicans over
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:23.400]  seventy percent of them didn't like baner and we don't like his attache we don't like his aid to camp
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:29.480]  we don't like his minion we don't like his frontman we want obama care repealed we want the gun

[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:59.960]  people exposing the takeover of the vatican it's even in mainstream news that they've been blackmailed
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.720]  by the pedophile lobby i mean that's how the pedophiles take over your organization
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.920]  they got a few people in have you hush it up so your organization doesn't go down
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:15.720]  and then they say okay let us totally take over or we're going to bring you down completely that's
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:22.360]  how blackmail operations works why they've got to be met head on so that is just some of what's
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:29.240]  going to be broken down today jacari jackson of course joined us earlier joe biggs will be joining

[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:50.840]  shout some real questions out joe we've seen our own dan badandi take action and take over the fake
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:56.040]  boss in bombing press conference i'm not going to tell you what to do but i hopefully you can get
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:02.360]  in there and make sure that even with the media media interviews the propaganda they're involved
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:06.680]  in that the point gets out there uh because these are folks that have engaged in all forts
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.720]  sorts of deception i hope you bullhorn go to go to radio shack if you have to i should have sent
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:18.520]  you a one uh cnn when they're live and point out that they changed this guy from biracial uh with
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:24.920]  you know moles on his face to to to to to white and made his nose and lips smaller there's a lot
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:31.160]  of targets here for info war so give us your take on that yeah yeah they turned him into that uh that
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:36.040]  character from the movie powder he looked just like that yes but you know one of the things that
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.240]  that people keep forgetting and i was just speaking with a gentleman he already walked down the hill
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:44.280]  and walked away he says that our country is breeding psychopaths and what he was saying by that
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:48.200]  is that when you look at the video game violence when you look at the hollywood violence those are
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:53.800]  two multi-billion dollar uh you know industries the video game industry and hollywood they're
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:58.840]  making tons and tons of money off promoting violence and these kids grow up playing these games
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.760]  where they run around and shoot stuff up the whole time and then in our country we have big
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.080]  pharma pushing these prescription drugs with these adverse reactions you know earlier you
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:11.640]  mentioned switzerland how they're more heavily armed as a population and they have lower crime
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.000]  but i guarantee you they don't have big pharma pushing all these prescription drugs down their
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.480]  throats and they're not having these people going these you know crazy sprees all over the place
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:25.720]  that's what happens here we are being genetically tested on every level our food screwed with
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:30.600]  our medicine screwed with we can't get anything good and then you know you watch you turn on
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:34.520]  the tv and you watch one of these commercials for like lunesta or whatever it is and you know
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:39.560]  and the side effect is a bleeding spleen or throwing up blood or you know sleep deprivation
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:45.880]  suicidal thoughts thoughts of you know anger thoughts of uh going out and hurting or harming
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:51.480]  other people including yourself suicide all this stuff but then something like this happens
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:57.400]  they want to blame the tool and not the root problem of the cause it's ridiculous why do we
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:02.680]  keep ignoring the fact that this is what causes it's not the gun and someone like i said earlier
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:07.400]  they're saying 60 percent of these gun deaths are suicide take the guns out of the the equation
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.200]  they're still going to find something else to do it if somebody wants to do it and they made that
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:16.920]  decision cause sure it's like blaming it's like blaming spoons for roseo donnell being fat is the
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:24.920]  old cliche they know what they're doing we keep talking logic to them they want our guns to enslave
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:32.440]  us gun crime is down 51 percent just departments own numbers since 1992 and when i had professor
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:37.240]  lot on one of the top statisticians in the world he works for major corporations he's listed as one
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:45.160]  of the top ten he said alex it's actually 61 percent their numbers are cooked 61 drop in violent
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:50.760]  crime using guns so they create the perception there's an epidemic of mass shootings the one we
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:57.560]  just saw today in Arizona that killed one person was directly linked to two different gangs
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:02.200]  shooting each other well gangs were doing that in chicago in the 20s they're going to be doing that
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:08.760]  in 50 years from now no matter what laws you pass go final comment and we're going to william f jasper
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:14.760]  well strictest gun control areas where chicago baltimore where the highest crime rates at
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:19.960]  chicago and baltimore so how's that gun control working out so far for the obama administration
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:25.240]  it's not working out too good when you arm people and you take away soft targets you stop making these
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:31.400]  uh gun free zones kill zones all these places where these attack happened they are gun free zones and
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:35.880]  a gun free zone is a kill zone because criminals don't abide by the law that's how they get the
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:41.240]  guns they break the law they steal it they grab it just like with the uh the illegal uh immigrant guy
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:46.920]  in california he stole the gun from an atf guy and then use it and kill somebody i mean it's out of
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:52.200]  control well said joe bigs thank you so much we will be talking to you again towards the end of the
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:57.560]  third hour and then off and on during the entire fourth hour with live coverage and of course many
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:02.040]  stations carry the fourth hour if they don't in full wars dot com forward slash show to find the free
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:08.840]  video feeds thank you joe bigs thank you now shifting gears ladies and gentlemen we have the
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:14.280]  pope coming out we now learn a secret meeting earlier this week according to vatican spokesman
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:22.760]  fred rico lombardi in the associated press afp you name it pope warns against conspiracy theories
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:30.840]  of vatican scalduggery and the pope reportedly said they have quotes that it's a conspiracy theory
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:37.480]  that he wants world government carbon taxes uh that there's a move towards the left of course
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:45.320]  that's all admitted that's all admitted so basically thinking is a conspiracy theory now remember
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:55.080]  30 years ago 40 years ago 50 years ago when the john birch society founded by mr welch
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:01.240]  laid out basically everything that we've now seen unfold you can see speeches he gave in the 50s that
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:09.000]  are like revelations or something coming true i mean it's it's true providence that we had all
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.520]  these people inside the establishment wealthy people mainly who didn't want to sell america out
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:20.760]  who were led in on the plan military officers you name it were the people that led the fight
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:29.080]  against what's happened berry goldwater and many others and then we saw of course people like ron paul
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:34.840]  in the second third waves myself in the fourth wave now we see fifth and sixth wave people
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:40.840]  waking up to globalism but now we've gone from denials of world government to world government
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:51.480]  being openly admitted across the board so we have all of that taking place and we have the tpp being
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:56.600]  well for a decade being prepared for two years being ratified finally done on monday
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:04.360]  finally completed and it takes wiki leaks to release one section the intellectual property
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:09.720]  rights chapter that was passed on the fifth that we still can't see so they've now leaked it
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:13.560]  we've been doing a quick analysis this morning we have an article going up in mere minutes
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:21.320]  by kit daniels the tpp is just a global government takeover which they now admit
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:26.600]  now we're about because of tv satellites have to stop skipping breaks so by next week i'm not
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.120]  going to do this anymore these are network breaks so i can't skip them they're not local breaks but
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:35.080]  i'm going to skip this one so that jasper has more time because this is so important um
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:41.800]  william f jasper of course uh his parents joined the john burt society back in the 60s he didn't
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:46.120]  believe it they were you know his dad was a world war two vet he respected anybody still just couldn't
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:50.280]  believe that there was this global government takeover that vietnam was wrong from a conservative
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:56.360]  perspective he tried to disprove his parents found out they were wrong got involved in john
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.960]  burt society and now for i think it's a couple decades has been the editor of the new american
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.600]  magazine reaching millions of people they've made countless documentaries they've traveled the country
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:09.320]  they have youth organizations in the summer that educate uh the children about what's happening
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:14.520]  and about the constitution mildly criticism as they haven't been hardcore and aggressive enough
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.400]  but that's okay their mission is just educational then it's up to the rest of us to be the shock
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.400]  trips i've never been a part of the john burt society my dad was involved in some of their
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.720]  activities when he was in high school uh so obviously i've been heavily influenced by it
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:32.760]  and he joins us now i mean william we've gone from world government them saying it's not coming it
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:39.640]  doesn't exist to exactly what the john burt society said 50 years ago coming true this
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:44.120]  is really got to be a paradox for the establishment and how they're trying to navigate it but they
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:49.480]  seem to be going back to the tried and trusted conspiracy theory label i mean matt drudge comes
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:57.240]  on and criticizes the tpp and esquire and countless of the publications say he's a conspiracy theory
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:02.920]  so this really is the new way to say heretic isn't it i mean this label and then i want to get into
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:10.920]  tpp with you yeah well it's it's quite amazing that now after all these decades and years of
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:20.760]  denial we are seeing exactly what we had warned coming true the move towards world government
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:30.120]  is going on at a rapid gala we see now with the tpp something we've been writing about
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:36.440]  and warning about for the last couple of years it seemed to be it seemed to have gone away for a
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:44.360]  few months it was not being uh headline news for a while but we warned that hey it's uh
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:49.720]  there is still activity going on it and this is going to be coming out back very soon and of course
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:58.200]  monday uh it pops out voila uh it has been adopted by the leaders of the tpp countries
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:07.240]  a trans-specific partnership and this is a giant step toward world government this is taking NAFTA
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:14.360]  global in the pacific direction and as you know the transatlantic trade and investment
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:21.320]  partnership the ttip is the companion treaty that is scheduled to take us global on the
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:28.440]  atlantic side and so joining the united states with the european union and in the midst of all
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:36.440]  of that we see another very important uh part of this whole scheme toward world government
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:44.760]  in the so-called refugee crisis which is really a migrant crisis it includes refugees uh streaming
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:51.480]  out of the war-torn countries of the middle east which the united states and the european union
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:59.640]  countries under u.n. auspices have been obliterating and creating this huge migrant crisis and now
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:07.480]  now we're told as a result europe has to take in millions of refugees and united states as well
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:13.800]  we have to take our share and of course this is part of the whole destabilization process if you're
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:20.360]  going to deconstruct the current world and create your new world order you have to create
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:28.440]  the kind of stability that will give a rational uh explanation for what you're doing and so that's
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:33.880]  what we see happening now with all of this migrant push that's right it's 21st century warfare and i
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:39.320]  want you to walk through all this but in the past if a company head or a governmental head screwed
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:45.160]  up big they had to resign now when they quote screw up on 9 11 or screw up with the derivatives they
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:50.280]  get rewarded with more power so they bomb the countries they bring an isis they bring an al-qaeda
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:57.080]  they bring in the refugees a bunch of them military people kicked out of syria and then now it's our
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:03.000]  job to pay for them and to take down our crosses and be politically correct i mean we really see
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:09.720]  the left in globalism teamed up with radical islam how do you see those things intersecting well
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:17.880]  they they intersect uh in many different places and the current uh issue of the new american
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:24.360]  magazine we have a package of cover stories by myself and my colleague alex newman whom you've
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:33.400]  had on your show a number of times uh going through both the the whole uh genesis of this
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:42.920]  with the current wars that are ongoing in afghanistan iraq libya uh and how the administration
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:48.920]  and the globalists behind it specifically the council on foreign relations and other related
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:56.520]  organizations that have been planning these wars for a number of years how they have actually
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:02.760]  planned to create the refugee crisis and then to exploit it they know when they obliterate
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:11.560]  old cities and regions and nations and make people homeless and uh terrorize them that they're
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:16.600]  going to try to go somewhere and then they're there with the united nations high commission
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:22.600]  for refugees to say ah it's time to go to europe we have all this set out for you there you'll be
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:29.480]  welcomed there and of course when you're in those kind of conditions uh i mean we can uh we can
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:35.960]  feel compassion for those people and we should and i do uh but it's part of a larger public
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:40.920]  program they call it a conspiracy theory but it's completely naked they admit they're doing this to
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:47.800]  have a radical transformation and divide and conquer strategy well and we have many admissions as
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:54.280]  as we pointed out i'm sure you have as well uh from vice president joe biden from the heads of the
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:02.760]  uh military branches that uh we are indeed arming and have been arming and aiding and training
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:08.440]  the top ISIS and al-qaeda leaders and the al-nasar front and other groups that are
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:12.840]  are we were supposed they were supposed to be moderates and they've turned out to
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:21.160]  guess what uh they're terrorists as well so we've created the the jihadi network we have created the
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:28.280]  the uh disruption of all the countries of the middle east with our regime change program our
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:34.200]  our arab spring and now the results which we predicted we said there would be millions of
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:39.720]  refugees from this and that's exactly where we are today we have millions of refugees the
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:48.360]  united nations says that there are over 50 million refugees now and over a billion displaced persons
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:53.560]  where are they all going to go can we accept all of them can europe accept all of them without
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:59.560]  completely destroying the nation and those are staggering numbers and as we know from leaked
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:05.480]  summaries of the 28 32 it varies the different sections as they've negotiated this in secret
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:11.240]  for years the john bursa society wrote decades ago how they would create regional boards like the
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:16.920]  eu column trade deals and then all of a sudden you wake up and it's a dictatorship well look at
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:22.360]  the eu now saying the answer to the migrant crisis and the problems and the derivatives
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:28.520]  is a super eu and getting rid of any national sovereignty and even sports teams can't be german
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:35.160]  or french or spanish or portuguese or british they've got to be like named after you know superheroes
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:43.240]  or something because even nationalism in a team is bad and xenophobic i mean this is such a cult
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:50.520]  of political correctness they've created then they destroy regions fold them in to super regions
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:58.920]  with marshal plans in their own words modern marshal plans of trillions they give themselves to go
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:05.000]  into these regions over the decades and quote repair the problem i mean you can really see
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:12.280]  how they've got to implode the world to on its ashes build this planetary tyranny and the two are
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:19.080]  are the tpp and the refugee crisis are intimately connected and a very good indication well borders
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:24.520]  is in there as you know it's all in there absolutely and and if you look at one of the
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:30.440]  at a number of the key people that are involved in both of these operations one really stands out
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:36.040]  just recently and that is peter sutherland peter sutherland is international chairman of
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:43.480]  goldman sacks builder bird trilateral commission former eu commissioner he's the one who helped
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:52.840]  to bring about the the whole uh eu amalgamation recently on september 30th he was on a global
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:28:00.200]  experts program a special event by the council on foreign relations you can go on the cfr.org now
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:08.760]  and watch this september 30th peter sutherland uh mr internationalist mr globalist uh and he was the
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:16.920]  main uh speaker at the event and he was caught he was pointing out that this recent uh refugee
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:26.360]  crisis uh is uh it was necessary that we begin compulsory quotas compulsory quotas are what
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:34.040]  now the the eu is demanding each each of its member states has to take x number of refugees
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:41.240]  and if you read the fine print of their decision at the european council they say but this can be
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:47.720]  uh this can be adjusted upwards so in other words this initial 120 000 that they said would
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:54.920]  be taken from italy and greece they said well that can that can be uh uh jumped upwards at any point
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:29:01.480]  and now uh the uh of course germany just overnight then went from saying they were going to take
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:08.840]  800 000 to now a million five so uh it'll be three million and then five million and then
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:14.920]  ten million and then checkmate they can all vote to enslave the germans sure i i mean so uh we see
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:22.440]  it was peter sutherland also who last year uh joined with the other eu heavyweight globalist
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:27.640]  in attacking switzerland and blackmailing and terrorizing switzerland when little switzerland
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:33.560]  said hey we don't want any more refugees we're not going to take any more muslims from the middle east
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:40.280]  and so all of the international uh establishment came down on on uh switzerland as they're doing
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:45.640]  now against hungary against uh lithuania that's right stay there one of the greatest minds when
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:50.440]  it comes to studying globalist and finding and william f chaspers are in the march the empires on
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:30:01.240]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network presidential candidates today strategize over
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:07.720]  every last detail of a candidate's image especially an identity candidate like hillary how important
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:12.520]  is it for there to be a woman president in the united states national journal has pointed out
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:19.240]  that candidates now view soundtracks as a key part of that carefully crafted image so maybe hillary
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:27.880]  should choose a campaign song that plays against type you know humble i'm sorry hillary has paid a
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:34.040]  consulting firm nine thousand dollars to create a soundtrack for her campaign i just don't think
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:39.880]  people would believe this song though she's being abandoned by unions by multinational corporate
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:48.280]  donors who are worried 44 percent of her twitter followers 1.4 million are fake maybe her campaign

[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:36.200]  so
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:49.240]  simply put we are facing private corporate world government that is usurping control of the planet
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:55.720]  through incremental private and public partnerships that is basically classical racketeering and
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:34:02.600]  fraud and they make money and consolidate power at each phase of the takeover and they implement
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:09.160]  an exacerbate crises they write white papers on how they do it how they fund all sides of a conflict
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:15.320]  and then basically get the west to bail the country out or the region out but you're not
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:20.680]  bailing them out you're giving money to the globalist and backing it up with your taxes and
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:28.600]  your and your military so they can then issue terms to the conquered country or region and by
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:35.320]  the way outside the us this is all well known one big trick of the globalist is though they act
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:42.920]  like it's an american empire and the council on foreign relations the peanut group the big uh
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:49.720]  think tanks say that so that we get the blame for the corrupt world government while we ourselves
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:55.240]  are being set up for a fall being put under debt being deindustrialized being demonized
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:35:01.480]  being attacked because they're going to bring us out of the dollar age the question is when we are

[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:06.920]  we fly our flags of no surrender openly and it takes that to shake people out of the tyranny

[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:19.640]  fellow for oh i don't know probably 17 years uh he's been fighting him on over over 30 years
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:25.880]  his parents for 50 plus years but is it not surreal i want to go back to the big picture
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:31.240]  here and then get back into the minutiae where this is all going to get the clinton library
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:37.240]  documents as joseph ferratt the western journalism center did last year and it's them in the early
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:43.400]  nineties mentioning the john birch society mentioning western journalism center mentioning
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:48.200]  what if there becomes a new media to challenge us we've got to instruct all the controlled media
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:53.320]  to call them conspiracy theorist and kooks and and just deny everything exists tonight tonight
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:59.880]  we have their own battle plan and now they still just bleed it out and say there's no secret treaties
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:05.320]  there's no world government raising the debt limit doesn't rather the debt limit uh gun crimes up even
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:12.200]  though it's not and their poll numbers go down and down people i think more and more who are thinking
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:18.600]  really get what's happening i mean the success of this show uh drugs showing up tuesday you
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:24.600]  know and endorsing us publicly uh that was a private relationship for that uh so many others
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:30.040]  in law enforcement uh federal and state and local want me to know that they're aware of
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:35.560]  what's happening and are totally freaked out the military is incredibly awake right now i mean i
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:44.440]  really think starting with the john birch society uh starting with uh people like bary goldwater uh
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:50.840]  mr welch we're not giving credit here they wouldn't want credit they'd want to defeat the tyranny
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.160]  but if you read the quotes by bary goldwater in the sixties about global government and
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:01.720]  the trilateral commission in cfr you later in the seventies it's it's a hundred percent on
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:06.600]  we need to let folks understand because what i found really wakes them up you guys put a whole
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:13.480]  issue out see we told you so uh and you know john birch society predicts basically everything
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:20.200]  and just show the thousands of quotes by you by patriots by you 30 years ago and everybody else
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:27.960]  accurately charting the future of what we faced so people will now listen to the next chapter and
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:32.600]  that's what i want to get to next what are they going to do next what's their end game if we don't
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:40.280]  stop them well you put your finger on some very important points and here's what's important for
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:47.720]  people to understand and the the key principle on here is power and concentrating power uh
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:56.040]  is an always a threat to liberty when you concentrate power at greater and greater
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:02.600]  levels and you get out to the global level uh then you're talking about a a huge threat to
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:11.720]  a human liberty uh centralizing power concentrating power internationalizing power on a global scale
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:18.520]  is a is a very bad idea if you believe in liberty and the folks that are promoting this that have
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:26.600]  been for over uh the last 50 years especially uh even longer going back nearly a century to the
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:31.960]  founding of the globalist movements in the council on foreign relations and the uh the other
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:38.120]  international circles like that uh they know what they're doing they believe in concentrating power
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:43.960]  and concentrating it more the more they can concentrate it the more they can empower their
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:52.680]  little oligopoly and that oligarchy then will have political economic social media control
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:58.680]  throughout the whole planet and that's where we are rapidly approaching right now we had a special
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:05.160]  issue of the new american uh just a little over a year ago uh called the united nations on the brink
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:11.800]  of becoming a world government and in that we survey we have a map of the world show all of the
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:19.000]  different adjuncts of the united nations the whole united nations bureaucracy all over the world
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:27.080]  economic political social and most americans are unaware that the united nations has grown to such
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:35.400]  huge dimensions and that it has offices and regional and national and global buildings and
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:42.040]  headquarters all over the world with all of its multitude of agencies and we show on the map and
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:48.280]  it's an interactive map all of these different uh agencies i've been to most of them myself i've been
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:55.560]  a correspondent at the united nations for many years uh for nearly 30 years and uh it's quite
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.520]  amazing when you particularly when you go to a third world country and you see everywhere
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:06.440]  where the united nations the united nations trucks united nations tents united nations buildings
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:13.640]  they are the ones who are in control of all of the refugee centers uh they are the ones who are in
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:19.000]  control of all of the bailout funds through the international monetary fund in the world bank of
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:24.760]  the united nations and that is one of the areas that we've focused on a lot in the past few years
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:31.400]  which is the international monetary control sure and now a few weeks ago national currency
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:35.720]  and i want to get to that because the world government's here but they're not even
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:40.200]  hiding anymore so shouldn't that give us an advantage to force congress to do something
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:45.960]  but what about the attorney general and the vice president two weeks ago meeting with the un
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:52.440]  and saying we're going to basically have the un come in take control of our cities our city's
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:59.400]  police programs to monitor them and to battle domestic extremist i mean i read the text earlier
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:06.760]  this week of what she had to say it is so naked william well and this is one of many areas this
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:12.520]  has been coming for a number of years we've been reporting on it that every time there is a riot
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:18.680]  or a race incident there are reports made to the united nations the same thing now with the refugee
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:25.240]  crisis those have to all come under united nations control united nations monitoring and
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:33.080]  according to the uh this next week watch uh this coming week in geneva switzerland the united nations
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:39.320]  is going to be having the world humanitarian summit and there they are going to lay down the
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:47.800]  the basis for normative international law regarding refugees and humanitarian concerns
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:53.560]  in which our government in our state department representing the obama administration and
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:46:00.040]  allegedly the american people is going to go on record in favor of moving in toward this
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:05.560]  international law well if you have international law you have to have international enforcement
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:12.200]  international monitoring and of course that means again more transfer of power to the united nations
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:21.080]  and its various agencies which is then you know the the the boldest and most ball face uh grab
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:26.520]  for power is then coming up at the end of november and early december in paris france where the
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:35.080]  united nations is holding its climate change summit which is of course calling for international
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:42.040]  controls over all of our the air that we breathe over all human activities everything will have to
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:46.600]  be audited if you're going to build a house build a machine if you're going to mow your yard
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:53.560]  it's agenda 21 on steroids have you ever seen them moving in unison this bold a and then b
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:59.560]  are they accelerating their program because they're behind schedule or are they really doing well
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:07.240]  well they're behind schedule on almost every front uh you know we've reported over the decades
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:14.120]  on a number of the uh leading timelines that they've put forward and on most of them their
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:20.440]  years or even decades behind however they have been patiently laying the groundwork and so
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:26.520]  now they have uh been able to build up all of these various un agencies they've been able to
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:33.080]  acquire the funds through the united states and the european union primarily delivering up most
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:40.520]  of the funding for this and so with legions of bureaucrats in the un bureaucracy and with all
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:48.120]  the ngo's that are funded by tax exempt foundations and government uh grants uh they now have a
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:54.840]  veritable army which works in concert with the the establishment news media to push these things
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:48:03.480]  forward and so that when a a crisis a planned crisis like the refugee port begins then they
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:09.720]  have all of their activists their ngo's their think tanks their media creating a fake consensus
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:17.000]  right so they can come up with a fake consensus they can stampede people with a uh concern over
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:24.520]  humanitarian issues or things of that nature and i agree with you they're 10 15 years behind but
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:29.080]  now they're trying to accelerate their program and you can see how they have the k community too
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:34.520]  flood europe flood the u.s with millions of refugees destabilize get more welfare more
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:39.400]  government more regulation domestically more police state the counter all the isis people
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:43.480]  they admit have come in then that's turned around against the indigenous populations
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:49.320]  or the populations that are more constitutional based but then they'll hold europe and the west
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:55.800]  hostage for hundreds of billions as they're now saying to fix the refugee crisis and stop the flow
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:02.120]  so they're going to basically extort us now with the third world they control as the world financial
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:08.120]  collapse accelerates to give in to world government and world taxation or they'll hit us with billions
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:13.320]  of people i mean you can really see yes they're going to try to to shove as many in here over
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:17.800]  the next few months as possible and what they're telling the united states is oh it's only a few
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:22.440]  thousand but that's what they were telling the europeans over the last several years what they
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:30.040]  plan to do is put seed communities seed migrants and you know as we've as we've uh posed in the new
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:35.160]  american we don't even know who these people are that are coming here most of them do not have
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:42.040]  identification they have not been vetted the fbi the dmi say that they cannot uh vet these people
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:47.000]  they there's no way that they can tell if they're terrorists or not or even where they're from what
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.160]  what nation they're from so uh once they get a few in here though they already have these
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:50:00.920]  the migration refugee network built up with hundreds literally over over 300 groups that
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:05.800]  are getting money from the federal government almost all of it from the federal government or
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:13.800]  from tax exempt foundations like sorrows for rockefeller these various groups like international
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:21.000]  rescue committee world relief uh us conference of catholic bishops uh lutheran world relief services
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:27.320]  these these groups are raking in tons of money they have a financial incentive as well as many of
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:33.240]  them an ideological incentive to bring more and more muslims to the united states and i'm sure
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:39.480]  you've covered as we have the fact that the the christians who are being persecuted in the middle
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:44.760]  east the ones who are really being martyred there are being discriminated against we have
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:50.200]  an active policy in our state department to make it difficult for christians who really have nowhere

[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:20.520]  reporters on the ground as obama prepares to land the next hour in roseburg or again if you're a new
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:25.800]  listener and you wonder what's going on the british empire and this is simplified 60 second
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:30.200]  history and we'll get jasper's take on it he's a bigger expert than i am but this is how it worked
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:36.920]  the british empire run by private corporations had taken over probably 40 of the world the sun
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:42.760]  never sat on it some estimates are 50 percent you have the dutch empire and the french empire
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:47.800]  and the spanish empire and the russian empire and the american empire was growing by then as well
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:51.640]  after uh the spanish american war was really when we became an empire
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:55:00.200]  that's admitted by historians and a lot of the robber barons wanted a corporate global empire
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:05.720]  by buying off presidents buying off kings buying off other companies consolidating those using
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:12.680]  mercenaries in skirmishes with locals indigenous that didn't want to go along with it and after
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:17.800]  world war one they had league of nations and they argued let's have this big combine never have a war
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:24.360]  again but then of course that went into world war two and the argument is let's have global
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:29.320]  government run by corporations that'll stop these wars but they're the very groups stirring up the
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:35.000]  wars so they can then point for global government to stop the wars and they're the ones nine times
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:41.640]  out of ten destabilizing starting the crisis or exacerbating it and so we don't face foreign
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:49.320]  armies foreign tanks now that's only at one small level of it we face economic warfare we face a
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:56.680]  takeover and it's a cultural takeover as well and it doesn't give any quarter and it's a world
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:01.240]  where the social compact is out the door and where they want to purposely make people poor
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:05.000]  and highly controlled cloward and piven is only one aspect of that we got three minutes left in
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.600]  this segment five minutes segment after that i'm trying to give you the floor in these little
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:13.800]  segments we have jasper but i think really getting big picture for people's the key here and now that
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:18.760]  it's all admitted and i just can't believe how incredibly accurate you guys got it 30 40 years
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:24.120]  ago i think we really have to celebrate the fact that we the conspiracy theorist we the
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:31.000]  constitutionalist really did get it right and that we are the real opposition to this planetary
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.560]  tyranny and i think people can wake up pretty quick to that and then form the proper opposition
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:45.000]  well yes i mean the the record is there and we have huge archives of stories on our website
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:52.120]  that go back 30 40 50 years and so people can judge for themselves they can say
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:57:00.360]  gee they were right 30 40 50 years ago and they've called it this is they said this is what was
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:06.120]  going to happen if these things were allowed to take place and that is exactly what has happened
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:13.720]  and the world doesn't look so good compared to what it could be what it should be so i i think
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:22.600]  people we're at a very crucial point in our history now and if people can tear themselves away from
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:28.200]  the establishment media and away from their Oprah Winfrey or their Kardashians or whatever
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:34.840]  they watch or whatever other diversions are keeping them from from looking at at the hard truths
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:41.720]  we can have a massive wake up very quickly and people can put the pieces together because
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:46.600]  there have been some some very good people over a long period of time that have been sorting all
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:54.360]  this out and putting it together for them and so really now the information is all there it's
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:58:00.840]  it's kind of complex it's very large but if you boil it down to the key principles which are if you
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:07.640]  want to maintain liberty then you have to have separations of power you have to keep as much
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:13.480]  power local as possible you have to keep national sovereignty and all of the forces at work that
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:18.280]  we're talking about today that we're discussing are working in the opposite direction to take away
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:24.360]  local control to take away national sovereignty to concentrate us in a global government a global
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:31.000]  economy and that's what we have to look at as as the i agree stay there do five more minutes with

[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:16.840]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:24.200]  and now live from austin texas alex jones coming up i've got a video that's really a paradox you've
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:30.280]  got a video where the cop lets the guy shoot him and still doesn't shoot him and says please don't
[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:37.000]  make us kill you me pull a gun on me i'm gonna shoot you and then another one where the south
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.400]  carolina cop shoots the black guy in the back they've now had to pay 6.5 million he's obviously
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:45.400]  been indicted there's two extremes the cop you don't want to be shooting somebody in the back
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:50.520]  and the other cop you don't want to be letting someone shoot you i mean this is just two extremes
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:55.640]  of total insanity we'll play the video about going back to william f jasper we got about four
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:01:03.560]  minutes left in this segment what comes next how do we fight them what do we do well uh both
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:11.960]  for instance we we started out talking about the tpp the transatlantic policy uh program and uh the
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:18.920]  big battle is going to be in the house and in the senate and right now we have the battle going
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:26.360]  for a speaker of the house and it's interesting that daryl issa is one of the key people running for
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:32.360]  speaker of the house and uh that's significant in this particular battle and on many others because
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:39.160]  although he has a reputation as being a conservative republican uh he is a member of the transatlantic
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:46.440]  policy network which is run by the aforementioned peter southerland the grandmaster of the bill
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:54.920]  berg uh trilateral uh internationalist uh golden sacks agenda he really is the new day the Rockefeller
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:02:03.720]  isn't he yes and uh i mean as we pointed out earlier he is also not only promoting the tpp
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:11.720]  and the ttip but also the big refugee swarm into europe after having helped uh bring together the whole
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:16.840]  borderless europe program while he was working as the uh president of the european commission
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:22.520]  lower the borders blow up the middle east north africa bring in the horge right so so he is a key
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:29.560]  operative there and daryl issa whether he gets the speaker uh ship or not is going to be it's just
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:35.080]  one of the in our special report that we did on the transatlantic policy network we listed all
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:41.880]  the senators uh that's called uh the our special uh article trading away their oaths we pointed out
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:46.680]  all the senators such as thad cocker and mark kurt barber mckalski pat roberts roger wicker
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:53.080]  that are members of the tpm and then we listed the um the house members as well they're all
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:58.120]  going to be critical votes and a lot of people think that some of these uh representatives
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:03.880]  because they are conservative republicans quote unquote are going to be uh reliable
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:11.240]  votes on this i need to realize that many of them have been bought off bribed off for or in
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:17.240]  in one way or another influence to jump on board this sovereignty destroying independence destroying
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:22.760]  globalist program sure and the media is acting like only socialists don't like it and it's a
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:28.920]  leftist issue because bernie sanders is against it absolutely but bernie sanders uh of course could
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:34.760]  flip just as he did on the federal reserve bill and sabotage the audit of the federal reserve
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:39.960]  after ron paul got a a good one through the house bernie sanders sabotage it in the senate and he
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:47.000]  could do the same thing on this as well uh that's what frequently happens the controlled opposition
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:53.400]  puts up a fight takes the center stage so that no other genuine opponents can surface and then
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:04:00.040]  when the critical time comes they fold and uh jump to the other side so we have a real battle
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:07.000]  before us on the tpp and then following up on the ttip a lot of people say it's over now we can't
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:12.760]  that's that's uh part of the strategy of defeatism no it's just begun even if they get this through
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:17.080]  look at all these european countries wanting out of the euro look at england demanding to get out
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:23.480]  now that we force a debate admitted to legitimate that's the end of it right i i mean so this is
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:28.920]  really a house of cards that they built they've made it look very formidable and it is because
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:35.320]  we keep allowing them to take our tax dollars and work against this uh to fund our enemies and to
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:40.920]  fund uh hostile takeovers uh that's why ron paul's right end all foreign aid william have
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:45.480]  jasper great job we need to get you back up more often thanks for the time the new america dot com

[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:03.160]  you thought you've heard it all parents are pulling their children out of a bay area grade school
[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:08.040]  because of a third grader that has been terrorizing fellow students that's right the unnamed boy who
[02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:13.240]  attends mount diablo elementary school has become so violent and out of control the principal there
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:17.800]  has had to place the school on lockdown several times the third grader in question has thrown
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:21.960]  rocks at teachers other students knocked over garbage cans punched others in the stomach and
[02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:26.520]  locked himself in bathrooms the albers have gotten so bad that about 30 parents have pulled their
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:30.520]  children out of the school so far the school board administration has done nothing to address the
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:34.920]  situation and parents are quoted as saying they want a healthy safe learning environment for everyone
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:41.160]  while i got news for you schools are gun free zones which makes them very unsafe back in my day
[02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:45.080]  behavior like this would have gotten you sent to the principal's office to receive three whacks from
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:49.560]  a paddle but i'm sure you won't see that in california and just to state the obvious we are
[02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:55.720]  talking about mount diablo elementary school so maybe this boy is the spawn of rob do reporting

[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:12.120]  that's a little inside joke paul was hiking around in the woods a couple days ago before he flew here
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:15.240]  we were talking with fun about work and i heard people in the background i said can you just
[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:19.800]  hop up and down and say royalty three times no seriously uh paul let's that actually did
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:25.560]  happen um paul joseph watson's here we have a lot of really serious news to cover in this third hour

[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:36.680]  and we're going to have uh jacari jackson and joe biggs as obama is set to land in the next 51
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:44.520]  minutes or so in roseburg to grandstand to venomously like a giant spider feed off the dead
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:49.960]  uh to push gun control and the epic over the top statement from the winehouse here it is in the
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:55.720]  washington post that they intend to quote circumvent congress with executive authority
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:10:01.800]  to restrict guns gun registration confiscating if they aren't registered the fbi said no we've
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:05.480]  been told we're going to take them from social security recipients if you take an automatic
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:11.400]  transfer is one example well most of them do other saying that means that you are uh basically
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:19.160]  uh being uh declared incompetent so this is over the top ladies and gentlemen so a big hour and
[02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:27.480]  50 minutes left out before us uh here paul joseph watson joining us paul uh you know drudge came
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:31.880]  over and saw you in england i guess last year we didn't tell anybody about that that's inside
[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:37.080]  baseball but he was over there uh conducting research what did you make of drudge popping up
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:40.920]  tuesday and it being one of the biggest stories in the country uh in the last two days i mean i
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:46.920]  that's just another sign of how big info wars has gotten but we already knew how big info wars was
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:51.800]  i mean if we could tell you about the other folks that are fans it really shows though how the main
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:58.600]  lining of reality uh is really becoming uh more and more evident as the facade drops i mean the
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:04.840]  pope is in the news in secret meetings scared of conspiracy theorists saying we must stop them
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:10.920]  um that means people that question known liars uh clinton obama stop it conspiracy theorists stop
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:18.600]  it msnbc stop listening to jones don't just whatever you do you're just credited if you do
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:24.760]  don't look there don't look there tpp doesn't exist uh it's not secret i uh no one wants your guns
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:31.480]  no one i mean this really looks like criminals trying to hide the bag of diamonds when the police
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:36.680]  pull them over uh under the seat but a few diamonds have fallen out they're in the floorboard uh paul
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:41.640]  joseph watson what do you say about being with the info war 13 years now since you were not even
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:46.840]  wearing big boy pants well it was it was about 10 years ago that i visited and then you had like four
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:53.000]  employees and that was in the old studio which was a lot smaller now it's like a sprawling complex
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.360]  you've got what 50 60 employees so the amount that it's grown in that time is huge since i last
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:03.800]  visited it's very impressive and we're exponentially reaching more people yeah that's and that's why
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:08.600]  we've been recognized by the likes of drudge in the first place well it's just exciting to know
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:13.720]  that drudge is so awake i mean basically i don't want to say he's an alex jones clone because he's
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:18.440]  a little bit different but he's kind of came before me a few years so it just he knows what's
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:24.680]  going on no no and you know i went to dinner with him a couple of years ago and he was so encouraging
[02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:29.000]  to me he was an inspiration to me and he said you really are having an impact you need to treat
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.720]  what you do like how the new york times treat you know what they do what their journalists do
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:38.280]  because you are having an impact you're important we're not being arrogant i tell our reporters
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:44.200]  that we can be as confident as least as a local news station yeah go ahead i mean we're not to a
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:48.600]  certain extent we need to fully understand you know the power that we've had in our listeners
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:54.680]  do our listeners have power yeah yeah so i went to dinner with him a couple of years ago and he said
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:58.280]  yeah he basically you know he ran through the whole gamut of everyone that works he and says
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:03.080]  you've all got certain qualities to bring to the table and that's what he encourages us to do so for
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:07.960]  me it was a massive inspiration and in the two years since we've really pushed on to the point
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:13.720]  where you know the the likes of media matters a white house front an admitted white house front
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:18.360]  you know every time almost that drudge links to us they put out a hit piece saying oh my god
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:24.120]  the discredited info wars again linked with drudge and yet then we had cnn picking up the
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:29.240]  drudge article the interview that you had which was epic and they didn't even link to the actual
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:33.720]  video they didn't they didn't link to info wars there i think they don't they didn't even mention
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:39.480]  info wars they just mentioned the alex shown show so shows how petrified they are uh us even
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:45.400]  being seen in top shows got 300 000 viewers i've got more than that every 15 minutes
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:51.160]  i mean they're they're they're they're in their own world they're in their own world paul
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:57.400]  it was like drudge goes on crazy rant about you know this that and the other that interview
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:02.200]  was really epic you can see the cnn article there again they don't even link to info wars
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:08.440]  other news sites which have tended to shy away from us in the past finally you know recognizing that
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:13.800]  you know we're having an impact drudge comes to this studio because he resonates with what we do
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:19.720]  because that's what he did you know 15 20 years ago he started off on a laptop in his apartment
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:25.000]  20 years ago yeah 20 plus yeah so he basically started off at nothing he became he became one
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:30.840]  man news operation a whirlwind force he had a massive impact that's why the clintons hate him
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:35.160]  and you know you took that on board you were already doing your radio show and as drudge was
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:39.720]  saying at dinner the other night what happens is more people do what we've done and he's done
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:44.600]  that's what's going to defeat them yeah which is what he was warning about which was you know
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:50.200]  don't rely on facebook and twitter as a platform because at any moment they can take away that
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:56.040]  platform we've had videos censored off youtube our entire channel got wiped off youtube a few
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:01.960]  years ago same thing happened to mark dice and so he emphasized that point it's about not
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:06.520]  relying on these social media networks we use them to amplify what we're already putting out
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:12.200]  but we've built the platform so build your own platform before relying on and giving over all
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:17.160]  your content and traffic to social media that's the key point that he makes right and in fact
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:23.160]  i was like debating what he said but really you just crystallized it he but there's a
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:28.280]  nuance to it you have to have your own platform then use the enemy platform to magnify yours
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:32.040]  but operate like you're not going to have that tomorrow that's why you've got to have as many
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:38.200]  platforms as you can in my view feeding back to your central platform like info wars.com
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:43.240]  prisonplanet.com prisonplanet.tv and the reason why you need to do that is because
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:48.120]  it's far easier for them to send to facebook and twitter than is to come after your own personal
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:54.120]  website we had top feminists go in front of the un a couple of weeks ago now and basically say that
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:16:00.120]  if you say to feminists you suck or if you call Caitlyn Brenner um Caitlyn Jenna Bruce
[02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:04.600]  then that is the equivalent of quote cyber violence and that's what they're and we had
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:11.240]  that video we played it and and now though expanding on that we have Zuckerberg at the
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:17.000]  un with Merkel saying we will shut anybody down that criticizes you or the open borders and now
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:21.560]  they've hired former stasi at facebook to report people to the police for their speech and the
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:28.280]  germans arrest you. Yeah and on twitter they've just introduced a new reporting tool where you
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:34.440]  can report somebody for a tweet if they disagreed with you so if someone disagrees with you on
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:41.560]  twitter that is one of the options. It says disagreeing in the handbook is hateful. Yeah or
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:46.520]  insulting someone's religion I mean the pope came out after Charlie Hebdo and said you shouldn't be
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:50.680]  allowed to make fun of or insult someone's religion. You deserve to be hit in the face
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:55.320]  as a quote. Yeah so he was siding with the jihadists that just slaughtered you know
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:59.880]  nine ten eleven people in France in the days. Yeah but he said he's not leftist it's a conspiracy
[02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:05.320]  theory he said you're not allowed to even interpret what he said. Well and that has caused a huge
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:09.640]  revolt within the catholic church there's a huge conservative revolt we had a video a couple of
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:13.960]  months ago they're giving all these pro-global warming climate change presentations at these
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:19.480]  individual church meetings people are getting up and going mad over this it's on video they get.
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:22.520]  Well that's why I would never criticize the catalyst because overall they were good people
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:27.080]  and an ally against the communists and all these anti-family people I know the left infiltrated
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:31.960]  them with the pedo brigades to take them over they've now done it. They have now blackmailed
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:35.480]  and taken them over and that's what the pope scared of is just pointing it out it's even
[02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:40.280]  in the London Guardian they blackmailed to take over. The catholic church is run by the pedo
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:45.880]  brigade they won they didn't get defeated they took it over. And then he's inviting in the waves
[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:51.240]  of migrants when top imams are getting up in mosques in you know Jerusalem and saying this
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:55.800]  is about supplanting Christianity. Well they say they're weak we have their leaders their
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:18:02.600]  women are ours they're scum and this is the top imam. Yeah and I mean imagine if we said the Arabs
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:09.240]  are weak we're coming to get your women and take you over. And then you've got the lesbian
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:13.880]  bishop in Stockholm who says they're going to remove christian symbols all together
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:18.680]  from the church. Well that's reasonable hey what about this no whites allowed Seattle
[02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:24.680]  will go to class just for people of color only. Yeah and again you look at Islam you know the
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:28.440]  religion of peace. I mean they don't even want the groveling whites that crawl on the ground
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:33.960]  about orders and go oh god oh oh worship for oh let me do what I and beat themselves on the head
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:39.160]  we can imagine the average liberal yoga person in Seattle it's just get away you filthy yeah
[02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:44.200]  they just roll around go please no you're my god. I'm seriously that's how they act.
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:47.640]  We were talking about this I was talking about this with Anthony this whole white privilege
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:52.440]  thing it's like I was born on a council estate and my dad had to get up at 6 a.m to go to a
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:57.480]  factory job that he absolutely hated for three decades. Making cutlery. Yeah just to try and
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:01.240]  give us some sense of living like Anthony's parents at one point he was saying couldn't
[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:06.760]  even afford to buy him sandwiches yet we've got white privilege when our parents had to work for
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:11.960]  decades you know living in council. My dad's parents had some money but you know they were
[02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:16.520]  land rich money poor so they were kind of a land gentry in the area but because they were an old
[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:22.440]  family but they didn't have any money and he had to put himself with three jobs through medical school
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:27.320]  I remember my dad would get two three hours sleep for those four years and looked like 15 years older
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:32.520]  after it. Yeah I mean my dad basically hurt himself doing that because we live in a meritocracy we
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:37.080]  have to work. He was a white pig. Oh he's bad for working hard and you know trying to make something
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:43.720]  of himself that's bad because of his skin color it's ridiculous. Well I'm just glad that they're
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:48.840]  banning white people at yoga I think that's totally reasonable. I mean you can't have white devils.
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:54.360]  The point is is this is just insane. I want to get into this latest Second Amendment story you've
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:20:00.440]  got and more with Paul Watson on this Friday edition stay with us. Just recently we've witnessed some

[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:04.280]  Hi this is Walt Augustinowitz. I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold. By now you've heard our
[02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:08.440]  commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing. Ten years ago I created
[02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:12.200]  a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:17.400]  issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID. I felt having to broadcast my
[02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:22.440]  personal information was an invasion of privacy. Soon after it was also announced that credit cards,
[02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:28.040]  debit cards, US passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:32.840]  It was then I formed ID Stronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:37.960]  world. There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID. I encourage everyone to get
[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:43.720]  informed and get protected. Please go to IDStronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or
[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:48.280]  badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data. You'll be pleasantly surprised
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:52.520]  that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[02:21:52.520 --> 02:22:18.520]  It is as though the protection is free. Visit IDStronghold.com today.

[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:10.120]  Paul requested the song. In 1814, he took a little trip. Sing it with us, Paul. In 1814, he took a
[02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:15.080]  little trip. Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississippi. We took a little bacon and
[02:24:15.080 --> 02:24:19.960]  we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans. We fired our
[02:24:19.960 --> 02:24:25.160]  guns and the British kept becoming. There was a nice mini as well. I'm Scottish, my friend is Scottish.
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:35.160]  I know, you asked for the song. It's funny, it's just the wrong redneck. And we see the British come
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:45.160]  and you're most of being a hunter done beating on the ground. Oh, God. Go redneck. I'm triggered
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:25:11.960]  right now. This is actually really offensive. We're going to the UN to complain. There was a
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:17.640]  nice one. I'm going to stop you serious here. Yes, right. You're actually Scottish. I'm more
[02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:23.480]  Britannic than you are. My last name is Joe. Shoot at me then. You're probably more...
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:28.680]  I'm running. Shoot at me. I'm running. I can't shoot straight. I'm British. I've been disarmed.
[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:37.240]  I'm a peasant. All right. There you go. Niko, are you enjoying that? I can see the camera in there.
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:43.480]  See them laughing. Am I pretty stupid or what? It's pretty fun. Okay. There you go, Paul. You
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:50.440]  got to run the red coat off. Seriously, folks, let's get serious here. TPP to kill. This
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:54.920]  Kit Daniels was seeing this about five minutes ago. He came in during the break. He's getting
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:26:00.040]  screenshots of it to add and update the article. We use Facebook because a fan in Canada created
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:06.760]  like, I don't want to exaggerate, 40 pages for us or something. And one, I've got like 500,000 likes
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:11.240]  and he just gave them to us. And then after that, they changed the algorithm so they stopped growing
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:17.880]  at about 900,000. So it's basically sat the same ever since and gosh, we'd have really known back
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:24.120]  then and used it like five, six years ago. But still, some days we can get as much traffic off
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:30.040]  our big Facebook that's like 900,000 likes as we get off InfoWars. The problem is any criticism
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:35.000]  of Hillary, any criticism of the migrants in the open border, any criticism of TPP,
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:39.560]  what Zuckerberg's been involved in. This went up five, six, seven minutes ago now,
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:45.240]  I guess about 10 minutes ago now, it had 40, 50 chairs. And he started, he started seeing it go
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:49.400]  negative. Goose already put a TPP out about Monsanto and how it's going to let them shut
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:55.800]  everybody down and make you take roundup and GMO. His had thousands and it went to zero.
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:01.720]  We did a story on that. This, he's getting video. In fact, they said screenshots. I want
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:07.640]  video guys, maybe repost it and get video in live time. As it first, it kicks in and gets like 50
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:13.240]  shares in like a minute. Then it starts racing backwards. So that'd be like if you're watching
[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:20.680]  a horse at a horse race and, you know, it starts running backwards when it's about to win. I mean,
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:25.400]  or Don King, one of his boxing matches. And the point is they don't tell you they're doing this
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:31.480]  censorship. They go, well, Facebook owns Facebook, but they act like it's this free open common.
[02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:37.240]  TPP to kill thousands by expanding monopoly power of drug companies. Trade deal to expand
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:41.240]  healthcare costs beyond Obamacare worldwide. Yeah, it's written by the insurance companies.
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:45.960]  Great point. Get Daniels. He links to the proof. He links to the pundits. What is their answer?
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:53.000]  Cause Zuckerberg so liberal is to then not let anybody know. Paul Watson. We need to show the
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:58.600]  power of info wars without Facebook and folks need to make this go viral right now. Well,
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:03.160]  another thing about Facebook that I noticed is they came out about a year ago and said,
[02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:08.680]  you know, if you're putting out quote, fake news, which isn't, you know, is reality news,
[02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:13.880]  basically, we're going to relegate the exposure of your posts and that will be based off of people
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:19.640]  reporting it as fake news. Now I get Facebook notifications like three, four times a week
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:25.320]  with my posts being reported for nudity. And of course, there's no nudity whatsoever. It's
[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:31.320]  something that somebody disagrees. Outrageous. Rigoring and offensive. So they report it to
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:35.640]  Facebook and based on their own algorithm. And I don't know if they changed it, but they came
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:39.720]  out with this about a year ago. They said, we'll just relegate the exposure. So more people don't
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:45.000]  see a post if it's being reported as, you know, offensive by a large number of people. And that's
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.320]  so they can just deny it. Zuckerberg was caught on the hot mic saying, you'll, he hired the Stasi.
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:55.480]  I mean, you know, yeah, literally code name Victoria used to work for one of the most oppressive
[02:28:55.480 --> 02:29:01.000]  organizations in the history of Western politics, reporting people threatening to take away their
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:07.160]  kids in Germany. She used to disappear people. And now she does it again. Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:11.400]  And another thing is how dare you'll be against disappearing people and their children. What
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:18.120]  could be more liberal? And with this, um, wickily, this TPP thing about, you know, potential copyright
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:22.760]  violation for linking to post the link and we'll get into it after the break. But this extends
[02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:28.520]  to Twitter, whereby if you tag someone in a tweet, that can also be clarified or classified as
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:33.160]  harassment merely for tagging someone else in a tweet. Is the harassment that when we go to dinner,
[02:29:33.160 --> 02:29:37.720]  I'm going to speak to you in English accent the entire time. Yeah, it's very offensive. Okay,
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:44.360]  ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back with the red coat and the Scott stay with us straight ahead
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:50.600]  info wars.com gets deeply into the news. Stay with us. Let's try to add the empires on the run
[02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:54.520]  fourth hour from those birds and the GC as the great buzzard lands.
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:06.360]  No whites allowed. A yoga studio in Seattle is promoting racial discrimination by holding special
[02:30:06.360 --> 02:30:13.800]  sessions that explicitly excludes whites. Rainier Beach Yoga in Seattle has created a special
[02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:21.000]  class called yoga for people of color, an exclusionary yoga session whose rules expressly
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:27.560]  forbid white people. An email blast from the yoga studio says white friends, allies and partners
[02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:34.120]  are respectfully asked not to attend. The class also invites lesbian, bisexual, gay, queer and
[02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:39.800]  trans friendly people, but no whites allowed. Hmm. I wonder what would happen if the roles were
[02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:45.800]  reversed and there was a yoga class for whites only. I'm sure the liberals across the country
[02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:51.480]  would be outraged and the mainstream media would make it a national story and you can learn more
[02:30:51.480 --> 02:31:00.440]  about this story and more right now at info wars.com Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can

[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:42.360]  will be more serious there is just so much serious news for the time we get to the third hour we have
[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:49.080]  joe bigs waiting in the wings to give us an update on the great carrion creature the great buzzard
[02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:53.800]  that is going to land to try to feed on the dead bodies of those that were killed spiritually
[02:33:53.800 --> 02:34:01.400]  to demonize a second amendment in a satanic anti-gun bloom bergian ritual but if you didn't know
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:04.680]  they're announcing the biggest assault on our guns right now so i should be deadly serious
[02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:09.160]  we're gonna go to joe bigs in just a moment but you know when you know these people paul watson
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:16.280]  from england joining us it is like clockwork how obvious all of this is and what their next move
[02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:20.840]  is going to be and then when we warn everybody they call us a conspiracy theorist but then exactly
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:27.240]  what we say happens then we seem like geniuses we're not that smart i mean the globalists are
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:33.240]  following a program they may tweak it they may move at a degree or so but it's pretty sick how
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:41.080]  obvious it is what do you expect them to do next now um i expect them to you know if if you if you
[02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:46.040]  watch these debates between liberals and you know pro second amendment people they press them on what
[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:52.600]  their actual solution is to this to this gun issue and they don't have a solution short of disarm
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:58.440]  everybody of all their guns and that's never going to happen without a complete bloodbath in the
[02:34:58.440 --> 02:35:04.600]  united states what is you know 300 million plus guns in the united states it's never going to happen
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:09.640]  they talk about buyback programs and all this kind of stuff even in australia where they supposedly
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:16.680]  disarmed everybody to stop school shootings 80 of the guns from the statistics i read are still
[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:21.560]  within the hands of the population so they didn't even hand them in so that's that's not even a
[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:29.240]  rational argument to make and then obama comes out after roseburg immediately and says yes we're
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:34.760]  going to politicize this issue like australia now he comes out and says it's not political that's a
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:39.640]  conspiracy theory yeah so you know in the past it was oh is he going to politicize it he admitted
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:44.840]  it that was his own word politicize the issue even though during this shooting there was an
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:51.400]  air force vet who had a concealed carry 200 yards away in a different building he was attempting to
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:57.400]  get across to apprehend the gunman to stop the massacre the staff at the college stopped him
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:03.960]  from doing that you also had chris mince the hero who took seven bullets he didn't have a gun and
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:08.360]  that's why he took seven bullets i want to know why the people followed orders of the staff at the
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:12.920]  military facility to not go over there and take this guy out i mean i'm not saying i'm some hero
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:16.680]  but if i heard they were executing people and i had a gun i would go try to take the person out
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:22.120]  i don't know the circumstances of it but he was there he was had a concealed carry could have
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:27.080]  you know at least lessened the massacre chris mince attempted to do that and it's interesting that
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:33.720]  rose obama is in roseburg today um about to meet with some of the families chris mince who's been
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:40.600]  widely lauded as a hero for the past week refuses to meet with obama he says he's not interested
[02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:46.040]  in meeting with obama well we want to talk to him jacarian crudham yeah because he doesn't want to
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:50.760]  politicize the issue it's yeah if obama wants to go and sympathize with the victims that's one thing
[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:56.120]  but we know that that's not why he's going he's going for a photo op and to grandstand that's right
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:02.040]  they don't want him there everybody he's still coming and they're busting in a bunch of bloomberg
[02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:07.400]  idiots and then you look at jerusalem where they've had a wave of stabbings throughout israel that's
[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:12.520]  your new story yeah over the past two weeks four different stabbing attacks we had one prior to that
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:18.280]  at a gay pride march and it's you know it's israelis and palestinians who are responsible for these
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:23.000]  stabbings because it's you know one is a revenge attack for the previous one so the mayor of
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:29.720]  jerusalem came out yesterday and said basically encouraged people who have licensed firearms
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:36.360]  to carry them at all times he said quote i have a licensed gun every time there is tension i
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:41.480]  instruct people who are allowed to carry weapons and are experienced in using them to carry their
[02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:47.240]  guns with them if you check you'll see that in many cases those who neutralize terrorists were
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:53.080]  citizens who aren't necessarily police officers like former soldiers so you've had cases over the
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:59.240]  past couple of weeks with palestinians you know lurching at these security officers these police
[02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:05.080]  officers attempting to stab them they're then shot dead and then you know some on the left
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:11.880]  go into outrage mode as if you they should just let themselves be stabbed to death but again it
[02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:16.120]  underscores the point that an armed population is a protective population contrast what the
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:21.080]  mayor of jerusalem is saying to what obama is saying or the head of interpol after the latest
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:25.720]  attack in kenya at a mall is that a couple of them said the interest armed people in the malls
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:31.400]  yeah because the the terrorists in that mall was stopped by you know people with guns and by the
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:35.800]  way this is an angle for joe biggs and jacari they've split up they'll recover more uh in the
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:39.720]  next hour in the hours after when they're live streaming the nightly news tonight as obama is
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:44.360]  set to arrive about to talk to joe biggs here briefly with an update he'll be again on more in
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:48.120]  the next hour if your station doesn't carry it info wars dot com for its last show to find the
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:55.880]  video feed and audio feeds this is important i bet they're gonna bust in i mean i heard they were
[02:38:55.880 --> 02:39:00.200]  but have the bust of people there say everyone there is in support of gun control block out all
[02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:04.520]  the demonstrators and have almost no coverage of it or they'll go to the demonstrators that are
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:08.600]  you know probably be a thousand people or more be a thousand six thousand ten thousand nobody
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:13.480]  knows thousands are already there were told and they'll just show the end of it i've seen mainstream
[02:39:13.480 --> 02:39:19.160]  media when we have a gun rally say with 1500 2000 people they'll go to the corner to interview people
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:25.160]  and show like six people on the edge at the back and say dozens came out today yeah and then the
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:29.880]  police department will say no it's 2000 or it was a thousand this is how they operate in their
[02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:35.240]  deception now we know they're deceptive but it's important to just keep rubbing the nose in it
[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:41.080]  and so getting footage of how they try to spin it what we shoot on the ground versus what's on
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:45.480]  the news tonight we need to be taping that here so when they get back we can really integrate that
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:50.680]  together and show people the type of deception we're talking about because that's why mainstream
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:57.400]  media is in freefall we continue to wound them we continue to expose them and show their premeditated
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:03.000]  hatred for the truth their hatred for america and the fact that they work for foreign occupational
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:08.360]  interest in this country joe bigs joining us from above the hills there over the airport
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:14.200]  has his lordship arrived yet he's scheduled in the next 20 minutes joe bigs they're reporting from
[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:27.320]  roseburg oregon oh we're actually down here on the ground now i looks uh uh uh he's not another two minutes and let's do this let's pause for a moment
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:30.920]  let's pause for a moment wait till the skype comes back and that's intermittent i know we had great
[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:36.600]  skyping was up in the hills i guess he's traversed down uh closer to the buzzards landing field
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:41.880]  and because he is a carrion creature now feeding on the dead bodies feeding on the dead to push his
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:46.360]  agenda of death and enslavement uh joe bigs if you're able to ask him any questions tell us about
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:50.040]  how big the crowds are what's happened since we talked to you an hour and a half ago and then i'd
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:56.360]  like to if you could ask obama some questions what would they be go ahead joe bigs well i'll ask him why
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:41:01.320]  you would take advantage of a situation like this to use a push his anti gun agenda why is he going
[02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:10.920]  to come here into a town that doesn't hit pause because we can't hit pause on a lot of feed here's
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:15.880]  what's happening there's so much media and so many people the feed's cutting out we should see what
[02:41:15.880 --> 02:41:21.960]  jacari services like and try to connect with him or go to only phone uh with joe bigs three times
[02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:30.040]  they say is the charm uh joe how many people are out there now it's frozen let's reconnect with him
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:35.000]  and we're trying to get jacari on uh it looks like a mass of people at a circus out there now
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:39.720]  do you think his lordship will dare dare land right in the middle of a protest the media will
[02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:46.440]  probably say thousands of supporters greeted him but not show up close well the triumphal emperor
[02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:52.120]  made the sunshine that day what's interesting alex is you know when it's when it's the opposite when
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:58.440]  it's for example a bunch of feminists on a slut walk they flip it so in la about a week ago literally
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:05.240]  150 200 feminists turned up for this slut walk it was pathetic time magazine came out the day after
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:12.360]  from a reporter who wasn't even there and said that 15 000 people showed up i thought it was 15 million
[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:19.080]  15 billion i mean who cares at this point that was actually 15 trillion check your mail it was it was
[02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:24.440]  actually less than 200 they said 15 000 that's a conspiracy theory it was 15 trillion somebody
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:28.840]  called him out on it and they said oh it was an editing error and then they didn't even change the
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:33.320]  error it was ridiculous and then the people who were protesting this amber rose slot isn't this
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:38.840]  really a man hating walk well it's basically statistically uh lesbians sexually abuse their
[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:43.160]  partners more than any other group i'm not bashing lesbians that's true that's true but i mean i'm
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:48.920]  just sick of hearing it on this rapist i mean you know no and the raping me oh rape it's just
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:55.400]  making it up the the rape crisis myth is exactly that it's a myth they say one in five college women
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:00.920]  are raped it's actually less than the general population are raped it's a it's a far lower figure
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:06.760]  and it's can we see the slot walk with the lady of the german uniform sorry go ahead so this um
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:11.800]  brightbart writer in lauren southern who's been on the show turned up with some protest signs against
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:16.200]  a slot walk you know peaceably just standing off in the background saying there's no rape culture
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:21.160]  they grabbed the signs off them it was similar to the planned parenthood march that info was
[02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:26.200]  was involved in a few months ago not as violent i would say but they you know tore up their signs
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:31.960]  and then called the police to have them ejected so they called on the patriarchy to have the
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:37.720]  anti-feminism they did my man from this local this is not a liberal takeover it's a satarian
[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:44.120]  takeover do you think the leftist bots realize this is a salitarian takeover um some of them do
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:49.480]  because there's been kind of a revolt among some liberals who are afraid to call themselves left
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:54.840]  wingers and ashamed to call themselves left wingers because the radical left has now become so
[02:43:54.840 --> 02:44:00.280]  extreme in its rhetoric that you've got classical liberals who lean more libertarian in terms of
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:05.800]  free speech who are basically you know withdrawing themselves from that whole movement and ashamed
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:09.720]  to call themselves left wing so by the way we never aired the whole thing only aired the first
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:13.800]  minute or two you aired the whole thing when you hosted an hour of the show where the woman pours
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:18.760]  the drain cleaner in her eyes at the end the you know the show's like the incredible bravely
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:24.280]  bravery is untold what a humanitarian this is completely normal and good i mean this is how
[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:29.240]  sick it's got no they had a they had a doctor i think from columbia or somewhere who said
[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:33.880]  that this is the right treatment for somebody with this disorder this is the correct treatment
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:38.280]  and the taxpayers pay for it yeah it's a poor drain cleaner in somebody's eyes this is acceptable
[02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:43.720]  and trendy it's liberal they had another they quoted another person who said she was an inspiration
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:49.960]  to blind people blind people who are crippled for life with an illness so inspiration is coming up
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:55.640]  with a way to have helped them see again yeah and technology and innovation it's not pouring
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:45:00.040]  drain cleaner in your eye or helping marrying someone who's blind because you love them or
[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:05.400]  loving the literature of a visually impaired see we have to use the word they say the establishment
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:11.240]  not even blind folks but then meanwhile they say pedophiles want your kids so that's an okay thing
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:15.320]  it's salon because it's a feeling they have and if you want to pour drain on your eyes
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:19.560]  that's a feeling you have but if man and woman hurts those that aren't men or women or boy or
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:23.480]  girl or father or mother then what's next you have to gouge your eyes out because somebody
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:28.040]  else doesn't have eyeballs i mean that's the logical extension of this oh maybe you have to
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:31.880]  pee yourselves and put it on twitter like feminists are doing but with the salon thing with the
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:37.160]  pedophile they actually came out afterwards they put a second article out by the same pedophile
[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:41.800]  who's like on forums bragging about how he likes to touch young girls and how he drools over six
[02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:47.160]  year old girls they put a second article out saying the right-wing hate machine came out with all
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:52.680]  this vitriol against a pedophile well yes of course it did he's a pedophile why are you giving him
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:57.560]  a platform in the first place it's completely disgusting and yet well they have the moral
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:01.960]  high ground so they can say pedophilia drano in the eyes chopping your arms and legs off
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:08.200]  is sexy and good and we're bad for saying that lusting after young children is disgusting we're
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:14.120]  bad well the top leftist uh at least back at the time ten years ago i was researching schwarzenegger
[02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:19.720]  because i saw it's his favorite artist is this german artist where it's like dead babies from car
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:25.000]  wrecks photos but then he adds like magnets into the photos or it's little girls with their legs
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:30.200]  spread in ss uniforms like four-year-olds yeah or it's photos of dead bodies with spikes through
[02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:35.080]  their eyes and it was schwarz i was doing image searches but a little piece in in the film martial
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:40.520]  law about schwarzenegger and all his gay porn stuff and why he was blackmailed when i came across
[02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:45.880]  the not research deviant art and there's all the leftist billionaires are like into they say it's
[02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:53.240]  a sacrament they want to pay 70 million for a skull in uh in baby blood with magnets on top
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:58.600]  it's not that it's worth anything it's like they give all this money to to make it a sacrament to
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:03.800]  worship the skull dipped in magnets yeah that's that's classic postmodernism it's nihilism they
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:08.920]  believe in nothing they believe in literally not we believe in nothing lebowski anything go don't
[02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:14.520]  worry these men are cowards yeah anything goes the sicker the better that's the essence of postmodernism
[02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:19.560]  and it's in art but then it's sick and bad if we have a monogamous male and female relationship
[02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:24.920]  that us existing is bad for them because they're moral even though they have no morals they dictate
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:29.960]  reality and then we all bow down because they said so yeah using boy or girl that's bad you know
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:34.600]  saying america might offend somebody who's from south america that's bad you can't do that anymore
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:39.160]  that's triggering well and they're not just this is not just weirdo groups saying this this is being
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:43.400]  implemented all over the united states and government reservations yeah major universities
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:47.880]  are poshing this you know you've got the president repeating the rape culture talking points so this
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:52.840]  is not just a bunch of idiots on twitter or tumblr this is this is the system getting in between
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:57.320]  males and females yeah and it's where now there's a phenomenon where you date a girl for six months
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:02.200]  and she goes i don't like you anymore i've decided retroactively that was all rape
[02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:06.520]  and then women are getting put in jail because all the texts are there hey baby come over and
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:10.760]  let's have sex meanwhile they got them yeah the cops are like is this one they raped you right here
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:16.520]  yeah they they tried to pass a law in new jersey called rape by fraud where if you lied to a girl
[02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:21.560]  about your age your career your income whatever before you had sex even though she consented to
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:26.520]  sex at the time retroactively she can go back and claim that you raped her they're actually
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:32.040]  trying to put that into law and punish like i'm an og mega mac i got a Ferrari and 87 billion dollars

[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:53.800]  rape by fraud website where she listed people who have been reported as doing this alongside
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:59.320]  megan's law violators who you know megan's law is based on the rape and murder of a six-year-old
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:04.600]  girl so if you like so it's just it's me it's me it's crazy people that have a weird thing about men

[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:30.520]  at the bottom level there you're kind of even with the the landing zone out here in roseburg and as
[02:56:30.520 --> 02:56:34.120]  you can see there are a lot of people out here right now i don't know if you can see josh's video
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:38.520]  yes we can the only one is about to land the one that made two plus two equal five
[02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:43.960]  well that's the word but at the same time you know how that guy is he might get scared and not
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:48.360]  even want to show himself around here and he might land in a field somewhere randomly who knows
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:52.280]  i mean he's done it before but you know there's a lot of people out here and this shows that the
[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:57.480]  community doesn't want the narrative that the obama administration is pushing and that's that
[02:56:57.480 --> 02:57:01.640]  you know we need more gun control you know like i said before i agree but then where is he going to
[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:06.600]  speak after that where's he going to feed on him some socialist church or something because we need
[02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:12.680]  to have this giant caravan chasing from what i heard he's privately meeting only with family members
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:18.040]  of the uh the incident he's not speaking to anybody in public there's no public events
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:25.320]  to his face oh so he did he did i knew it yeah wow yeah so this is a private event he's only
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:29.720]  going to be here for maybe an hour max and then he's flying to go party in seattle for the rest
[02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:34.520]  of the day and in tomorrow well joe i bet that they've already probably starting to bury some of the
[02:57:34.520 --> 02:57:38.360]  folks i want you to there's there's there's no lights allowed to do yoga in seattle so that's
[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:43.000]  why he wants to go up there well yeah he can go to the he can actually be part of that yoga class
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:47.400]  uh joe obviously try to interview some of the survivors try to review some of their families
[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:51.880]  and i would try to politely go to some of the funerals uh and cover those this weekend because
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:57.480]  those are going to be happening this weekend okay joe anything else you need to add for us i know
[02:57:57.480 --> 02:58:03.480]  you're about to go operational when his lordship lands well yeah i'm definitely going to find cnn
[02:58:03.480 --> 02:58:07.400]  there's cnn's over here a little bit i definitely want to go and talk to them and ask them like we
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:14.680]  said earlier why they're going to photoshop the picture of the killer do they say go to the high
[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:20.040]  school apparently he's going to land in a high school or something so they're telling everybody
[02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:24.200]  to go to the high school so everybody's taking off okay do it try to go and get footage of that

[02:59:14.040 --> 02:59:19.160]  it's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs
[02:59:19.160 --> 02:59:23.800]  working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that

[03:01:03.720 --> 03:01:07.400]  your own words you want to talk to cnn go ahead we'll uh we'll cover it live right now
[03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:17.080]  yeah uh well how do i get over that way how far of a walk is it
[03:01:18.360 --> 03:01:22.520]  okay all right so we're trying to get information as to where he's gonna be coming through yeah
[03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:28.040]  there's no point to do that joe there's no point to do that if it's only a half mile away you'll
[03:01:28.040 --> 03:01:35.240]  see the helicopter come in well no he's he's apparently flying here alex now and then uh
[03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:39.160]  he's going to take a motorcade to the high school right down the street and apparently that's where
[03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:42.920]  he's going to be speaking to the families they're going to be there well then that's perfect exactly
[03:01:42.920 --> 03:01:50.440]  just wait till he lands get video of the uh the uh once he comes into the lands and the
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:55.480]  motor came to please or be shut down so you just want us to all stay right here then no i understand
[03:01:55.480 --> 03:01:59.080]  then you then keep jacari there or you guys decide right now and then you go to the high school that
[03:01:59.080 --> 03:02:04.440]  makes sense okay yeah so that's what we're going to do as you see there's a lot of people here
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:09.320]  everybody's really uh you know wants to go and confront this man and ask him why he's coming in
[03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:14.440]  and politicize in this entire event especially like we said you know i mean they will from the air
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:19.480]  have nbc news or abc or cbs say you're all there to supporting they'll keep back 500 yards and say
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:24.440]  that that that's how they pray on their audience well what you guys were saying earlier uh has
[03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:28.040]  already happened how the mainstream media you said was going to show up late for what i heard from
[03:02:28.040 --> 03:02:32.120]  the first three or four people that were here on the ground to a set up an area for the protest
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:36.440]  there was a lot of mainstream media out here earlier filming just the four people that were
[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:40.680]  standing out here then they up to the left so it looks like when they go into the news there was
[03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:45.640]  no one here today but the difference is hundreds of thousands are watching this millions are hearing
[03:02:45.640 --> 03:02:49.960]  it millions will watch all the videos and that's why they're losing credibility they keep lying
[03:02:50.680 --> 03:02:55.800]  like they're in a vacuum and no one knows paul watson yeah and they were also they were also
[03:02:55.800 --> 03:03:01.080]  caught in a live at the arm security because we got contacted by uh an ex security guard at that
[03:03:01.080 --> 03:03:07.320]  college he was there a couple of years ago he said they voted against arm security just a year ago
[03:03:07.320 --> 03:03:12.360]  so that could have prevented the massacre altogether and now we have obama grandstanding on the fight
[03:03:12.360 --> 03:03:17.480]  so again a lot of lies related let's get that story out wow so they did vote to have no security
[03:03:17.480 --> 03:03:22.280]  there yeah we got contacted by an ex security guard that was that article was out october second i
[03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:27.880]  missed that yeah it was a info was exclusive so again another major tenet to this story that's
[03:03:27.880 --> 03:03:33.880]  not being covered in the media unbelievable we've got david night coming up you're welcome to pop in
[03:03:33.880 --> 03:03:38.600]  more with him if you like paul but you're gonna be hosting one day next week uh and it's great to

[03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:47.160]  hopefully tonight or something uh and we'll get some mexican food i like spicy food well it'd be
[03:03:47.160 --> 03:03:51.000]  racist not to have mexican food right that is good i think that's the answer well it would be
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:57.240]  actually i agree that is racist all eat basically uh so uh because i am racist so that's all coming up
[03:03:57.240 --> 03:04:02.680]  but getting serious folks the biggest salt on our freedoms is here it's coming down it's on paul great

[03:04:24.680 --> 03:04:29.320]  like a secret service video uh secret service vehicle he's sitting out here park so apparently

[03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:39.000]  then that's where we're gonna try to get him so jacari and matt will be here so you'll have a

[03:04:56.920 --> 03:05:01.320]  sunday four to six p.m just when you thought you've heard it all parents are pulling their
[03:05:01.320 --> 03:05:05.400]  children out of a bay area grade school because of a third grader that has been terrorizing
[03:05:05.400 --> 03:05:10.840]  fellow students that's right the unnamed boy who attends mount diablo elementary school has become
[03:05:10.840 --> 03:05:15.480]  so violent and out of control the principal there has had to place the school on lockdown several
[03:05:15.480 --> 03:05:19.800]  times the third grader in question has thrown rocks at teachers other students knocked over
[03:05:19.800 --> 03:05:24.280]  garbage cans punched others in the stomach and locked himself in bathrooms the outburst have
[03:05:24.280 --> 03:05:28.440]  gotten so bad that about 30 parents have pulled their children out of the school so far the school
[03:05:28.440 --> 03:05:32.360]  board administration has done nothing to address the situation and parents were quoted as saying
[03:05:32.360 --> 03:05:37.240]  they want a healthy safe learning environment for everyone while i got news for you schools are gun
[03:05:37.240 --> 03:05:42.520]  free zones which makes them very unsafe back in my day behavior like this would have gotten you
[03:05:42.520 --> 03:05:46.840]  sent to the principal's office to receive three wax from a paddle but i'm sure you won't see that in
[03:05:46.840 --> 03:05:52.440]  california and just to state the obvious we are talking about mount diablo elementary school so maybe

[03:07:57.640 --> 03:08:13.560]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:08:13.560 --> 03:08:27.880]  welcome to the fourth hour on this friday october night 2015 i'm david night your host
[03:08:28.840 --> 03:08:33.320]  we're going to be talking to our reporters who are in oregon they're waiting obama's arrival
[03:08:33.320 --> 03:08:39.560]  his majesty will be showed us will be landing pretty soon telling us about his grandiose plans
[03:08:39.560 --> 03:08:45.560]  to enact gun control by executive fiat this is a dictatorship the way he's running it
[03:08:46.360 --> 03:08:51.480]  they talk about how he's going to do an in run around congress isn't it interesting that obama
[03:08:51.480 --> 03:08:59.720]  is going to oregon and not going to afghanistan where his people just shot up a hospital two days
[03:08:59.720 --> 03:09:05.880]  after the shooting in oregon we had the u.s military shoot up a hospital in afghanistan
[03:09:05.880 --> 03:09:12.920]  for 30 minutes this continued far longer than the shooting in oregon because there wasn't anybody
[03:09:12.920 --> 03:09:18.520]  to come in and call it off you can send the police in they may take 10 or 15 minutes when there's a
[03:09:18.520 --> 03:09:23.000]  shooting that's one of the reasons why you need to be armed to protect yourself to protect your
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:29.880]  loved ones but in afghanistan this attack continued for 30 minutes we're going to talk about that
[03:09:29.880 --> 03:09:37.240]  and why he isn't there and the kind of admissions that we're getting from the defense department
[03:09:37.240 --> 03:09:44.120]  from the obama administration a different story every day this is like ben gazi except far more
[03:09:44.120 --> 03:09:49.000]  people died so we're going to talk about that we're going to talk about the hypocrisy of not going
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:54.680]  there he could investigate his own administration his own military find out what was going on what
[03:09:54.680 --> 03:10:01.080]  went wrong if he cared if he really cared about human life no he doesn't he doesn't care about the
[03:10:01.080 --> 03:10:06.440]  rule of law either there are international laws geneva convention have you ever heard of that obama
[03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:12.040]  nobel peace prize winner you ever heard of the geneva convention well that's what you violated
[03:10:12.040 --> 03:10:17.160]  when you attacked a hospital continuously for 30 minutes we're going to give you the comments
[03:10:17.160 --> 03:10:23.320]  of the people with doctors without borders as npr says doctors without borders are now doctors
[03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:31.480]  in anguish and so are their patients who burned to death in beds as the u.s attack continued
[03:10:31.480 --> 03:10:37.880]  but obama is going to get on his moral high horse never let hypocrisy stop anybody from
[03:10:37.880 --> 03:10:42.920]  doing anything he's going to get on his moral high horse and he's going to lecture us about
[03:10:42.920 --> 03:10:48.760]  gun control about gun violence after shooting up a hospital continuously i also want to look at
[03:10:48.760 --> 03:10:52.600]  what happened the newest developments in the speaker race we talked about this yesterday
[03:10:52.600 --> 03:10:59.080]  and it was pretty amazing then even more amazing things happened later in the day we saw that wiki
[03:10:59.640 --> 03:11:07.480]  wikipedia was adjusted to talk about an affair between kevin mccarthy an alleged affair between
[03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:14.440]  kevin mccarthy and rene elders another congresswoman a congresswoman from north carolina and that wiki
[03:11:14.440 --> 03:11:20.520]  leaks entrance in that adjustment into wiki leaks was traced back to a department of homeland
[03:11:20.520 --> 03:11:27.800]  security ip address this is the second time in just a couple of weeks that we've seen congressmen
[03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:34.840]  deliberately embarrassed perhaps by law enforcement agencies now we could have said we saw this
[03:11:34.840 --> 03:11:39.960]  coming this is part of the surveillance state and if people in congress don't think that they're
[03:11:39.960 --> 03:11:44.920]  going to be the victims of blackmail whether it's real or imagined because of course anybody that
[03:11:44.920 --> 03:11:51.640]  has the kind of access to the computer networks that the nsa and homeland security have anyone who
[03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:56.920]  has that kind of access they can plant information on people as well as expose information on people
[03:11:57.960 --> 03:12:04.040]  when you are in power like members of congress are as as alex jones has pointed out many times
[03:12:04.680 --> 03:12:11.400]  they're going to be the ones who bear the brunt of any authoritarian dictatorship any coup any
[03:12:11.400 --> 03:12:15.800]  blackmailing that is going to go on they're going to be the ones who bear the brunt of it and we've
[03:12:15.800 --> 03:12:22.360]  seen it with two of the candidates who were running for speaker of the house we saw it now with kevin
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:27.880]  mccarthy we saw it previously with jayson chaffetz he was part of a committee that was
[03:12:27.880 --> 03:12:34.040]  investigating failures of the secret service agency to protect obama and then they started
[03:12:34.040 --> 03:12:39.080]  publicly floating information around that they thought would embarrass him making it known
[03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:43.240]  that when he applied for a job with a secret service years ago they uncovered information
[03:12:43.240 --> 03:12:49.080]  about him that would be very embarrassing i haven't seen any of that exposed but that's the way you
[03:12:49.080 --> 03:12:54.280]  blackmail people you say i've got the information on you and then you start a whispering campaign
[03:12:54.280 --> 03:12:59.080]  in the media saying we've got information on him that he wouldn't want out it's a very effective
[03:12:59.080 --> 03:13:03.880]  way to blackmail people maybe even more effective than letting the information out because people
[03:13:03.880 --> 03:13:09.400]  start imagining all kinds of scenarios or what could it be then we have the situation with kevin
[03:13:09.400 --> 03:13:15.640]  mccarthy and it's unraveling and it gets a little bit larger people are questioning why would homeland
[03:13:15.640 --> 03:13:21.400]  security adjust why would someone at homeland security adjust the wikipedia entries on these two
[03:13:22.360 --> 03:13:28.040]  congressional candidates who's behind this and of course this is not something that is new a lot
[03:13:28.040 --> 03:13:33.560]  of people shepherd smith grilled congressman walter jones saying what did you know you wrote a letter
[03:13:33.560 --> 03:13:39.480]  saying that we need to have people of integrity running for leadership i mean who would think
[03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:45.560]  that would be the case in washington why would why would somebody who'd spent 20 years in washington
[03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:51.320]  like congressman walter jones a man of integrity himself why would he be concerned about leadership
[03:13:51.320 --> 03:13:57.560]  having some integrity well we now learn that there was a conservative activist who was sending out
[03:13:57.560 --> 03:14:04.200]  multiple emails at least eight congressman got emails alleging that there was an affair between
[03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:11.080]  congressman mccarthy and congresswoman elmer's so there was already a lot of rumors about this
[03:14:11.080 --> 03:14:15.480]  as a matter of fact there was a website that had ledged the very same thing back in january
[03:14:16.120 --> 03:14:23.080]  and the fellow who runs that website was subsequently banned from twitter as huffington post
[03:14:23.080 --> 03:14:28.840]  puts it he's now doing a victory lap saying he thinks he was vindicated so there's a lot that's
[03:14:28.840 --> 03:14:33.000]  going on with that but i think one of the most telling things that happened yesterday was the
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:36.840]  fact that in the morning everybody thought everything was okay the mainstream media thought
[03:14:36.840 --> 03:14:41.720]  everything was okay they thought that mccarthy had clenched the speakership and of course mccarthy
[03:14:41.720 --> 03:14:46.760]  was the handpicked successor to john bainer the one that john bainer had picked john bainer thought
[03:14:46.760 --> 03:14:52.360]  everything was fine and then as the meeting began as reported yesterday mccarthy stands up and says
[03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:58.440]  i'm withdrawing from the race bainer immediately gaveled the meeting to a close and understand
[03:14:58.440 --> 03:15:06.440]  he wasn't the only person running think about this think about if you had a senate primary race
[03:15:07.480 --> 03:15:13.400]  and you had a governor who was very invested in one particular candidate everybody knew that he
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:18.760]  invested that that he supported this one candidate for senate and then let's say that that candidate
[03:15:18.760 --> 03:15:23.240]  that was supported by the governor suddenly withdraws and the governor says that's it
[03:15:23.240 --> 03:15:29.240]  we're not having a primary we're going to delay this i will be the senator for the interim that's
[03:15:29.240 --> 03:15:36.680]  essentially what happened in the house that shows you the level of corruption the authoritarian
[03:15:36.680 --> 03:15:42.200]  dictatorship attitude of john bainer when his candidate drops out he doesn't continue on with
[03:15:42.200 --> 03:15:47.000]  the election even though there's two other candidates he suspends the election and he says
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:54.040]  well i'll stay in here until i can find somebody that i like to succeed me is that amazing does
[03:15:54.040 --> 03:15:59.480]  that not underscore the importance of why we need to get people like bainer and his hand
[03:15:59.480 --> 03:16:05.640]  picked successors like kevin mccarthy out of power whether you're a democrat or republican
[03:16:06.360 --> 03:16:13.960]  that has to make you throw up to see that kind of heavy-handed banana republic type of of politics
[03:16:13.960 --> 03:16:19.240]  that we see coming from john bainer that's precisely what is going on there there was an
[03:16:19.240 --> 03:16:24.600]  article up on info wars dot com today government likens ending bulk surveillance to opening the
[03:16:24.600 --> 03:16:28.840]  prison gates this is something that came from the intercept this is the organization that glenn
[03:16:28.840 --> 03:16:34.040]  greenwall is involved with the tagline says the justice department prosecutor said thursday
[03:16:34.040 --> 03:16:39.800]  ordering the immediate end of bulk surveillance of millions of american phone records would be as
[03:16:39.800 --> 03:16:45.800]  hasty as hasty want to get hasty now as hasty as suddenly letting criminals out of prison
[03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:50.680]  you know i think she's really on to something without analogy because you know in prisons
[03:16:51.720 --> 03:16:57.640]  as well as in this mass surveillance both of them are about control they're about confinement
[03:16:58.360 --> 03:17:04.920]  and they are about profits i was just talking about how the law enforcement agencies that
[03:17:04.920 --> 03:17:11.720]  seem to know everything about everyone are making known things that would blackmail our own congressman
[03:17:11.720 --> 03:17:16.120]  this has happened before with the supreme court many of us have said i believe it i've said it
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:23.320]  multiple times i believe the supreme court justice roberts was blackmailed into changing his vote on
[03:17:23.320 --> 03:17:30.120]  obama care it's completely out of character for what he's voted for he had written the opinion to
[03:17:30.120 --> 03:17:36.040]  say that it wasn't constitutional and then suddenly he wrote the opinion to say that yes i think it is
[03:17:36.040 --> 03:17:43.400]  okay and we can move ahead with it very very unusual to write both the dissenting and consenting
[03:17:43.400 --> 03:17:49.160]  opinion and the same written by the same person now looking at this bulk surveillance this is
[03:17:49.160 --> 03:17:53.160]  interesting because this is coming from the continuing lawsuit of larry claimant and we've
[03:17:53.160 --> 03:17:58.280]  had him on the alex jones radio show as well as the nightly news many times to talk about this
[03:17:58.280 --> 03:18:06.120]  he is pushing on a lawsuit to stop this massive violation of our fourth amendment freedoms that
[03:18:06.120 --> 03:18:12.840]  we have as human beings that are recognized by the constitution it doesn't grant us fourth amendment
[03:18:12.840 --> 03:18:17.800]  it recognizes those and it prohibits the government from doing that is that a helicopter coming in
[03:18:17.800 --> 03:18:22.680]  now is that obama landing okay let's go to that right now we've got our reporters on the ground
[03:18:22.680 --> 03:18:29.400]  in oregon and okay we're not going to go to that right now but that is video of obama's helicopter
[03:18:29.400 --> 03:18:36.200]  coming in and he's going to come in like a royal personage and he's going to lecture people who
[03:18:36.200 --> 03:18:42.600]  don't want to be lectured there's a massive pushback in the area many people saying we don't want you
[03:18:42.600 --> 03:18:48.760]  to use this to push for gun control we've reported on that there's massive counter demonstrations
[03:18:48.760 --> 03:18:55.720]  there we have the sheriff previously had written the letter to vice president joe biden after the
[03:18:55.720 --> 03:19:02.600]  sandy hook shooting and said i am this is a wrong this is wrong what you're planning to do and i will
[03:19:02.600 --> 03:19:09.320]  not enforce your gun control legislation and so now in spite of the fact that the families have
[03:19:09.320 --> 03:19:16.120]  asked him not to politicize the deaths of their loved ones not to use it for his political agenda
[03:19:16.120 --> 03:19:23.720]  he is now flying in nevertheless and he has signaled his intention to do gun control by
[03:19:23.720 --> 03:19:30.200]  executive fiat bypassing congress ignoring the constitution because we have a an explicit
[03:19:30.200 --> 03:19:35.640]  prohibition of that but of course we have explicit prohibitions of many things that are continuously
[03:19:35.640 --> 03:19:39.800]  ignored by our government like fourth amendment protections whether it's at the airport there's
[03:19:39.800 --> 03:19:43.400]  some more pictures for those of you who are watching some more helicopters that are flying in
[03:19:43.400 --> 03:19:49.160]  our helicoptering dictator is arriving in oregon and when we come back we're going to talk about
[03:19:49.160 --> 03:19:53.880]  the back and forth the continuing lawsuit with larry claimant trying to stop the drag net

[03:24:08.920 --> 03:24:15.400]  going to be going to our reporters in oregon as obama is touching down there to push gun control
[03:24:15.400 --> 03:24:21.000]  there was a story yesterday that came out about children's cancer being linked to fukushima radiation
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:27.640]  they are seeing thyroid cancer amongst children at a rate 20 to 50 times the rate of children
[03:24:27.640 --> 03:24:33.160]  elsewhere in the vicinity of fukushima and the interesting thing about this too is that they
[03:24:33.160 --> 03:24:38.440]  said that this is risen by 22 percent in just the last year and of course they point out in the
[03:24:38.440 --> 03:24:43.960]  article of thyroid cancer amongst children is one sickness that the medical world has definitively
[03:24:43.960 --> 03:24:50.440]  linked to radiation after the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe it's one of the reasons why they
[03:24:50.440 --> 03:24:54.520]  give people iodine supplements whenever they're concerned they may there may be an exposure
[03:24:54.520 --> 03:25:00.600]  to radiation your thyroid will suck up radioactive isotopes and and hold them and that will cause
[03:25:00.600 --> 03:25:06.760]  it to become cancerous that's one of the conditions about that but of course you can get iodine as a
[03:25:06.760 --> 03:25:11.160]  supplement as well we used to be supplemented in our food they used to be added to a lot of
[03:25:11.160 --> 03:25:16.920]  different uh items in our diet salt and other things they're now removing that out so check
[03:25:16.920 --> 03:25:23.480]  your doctor find out what kind of supplementation you need for iodine and look at our source of
[03:25:23.480 --> 03:25:28.840]  iodine we have an excellent source very clean nascent iodine ultra clean ultra powerful
[03:25:28.840 --> 03:25:34.120]  survival shield x2 we have that in stock right now at info wars life dot com it was interesting
[03:25:34.120 --> 03:25:40.280]  too there was another article i was reading a few days ago how nasa uses iodine to purify urine
[03:25:40.280 --> 03:25:45.960]  into drinking water they're talking about the space station and they said that the americans use iodine
[03:25:45.960 --> 03:25:53.640]  the russians use silver in order to purify their urine into drinking water so there's a lot of
[03:25:53.640 --> 03:26:00.040]  different uses for these types of things that you should have both as supplementation and as a backup
[03:26:00.040 --> 03:26:05.080]  in case there's some kind of an emergency again survival shield nascent iodine is available
[03:26:05.080 --> 03:26:11.080]  right now you can get it at info wars life dot com now as we're about to go to our reporters in
[03:26:11.080 --> 03:26:18.360]  oregon i just want to point out the hypocrisy the hypocrisy of obama helicoptering into oregon
[03:26:18.360 --> 03:26:26.360]  and completely ignoring his own administration's attack continuous attack on a hospital what about
[03:26:26.360 --> 03:26:32.520]  obama's hospital shooting that's what we need to be asking not about one individual who's crazy
[03:26:32.520 --> 03:26:36.440]  who's hyped up on drugs and of course when they're talking about changing the gun laws when they're
[03:26:36.440 --> 03:26:42.760]  talking about changing the background checks they're not talking about looking at the medications
[03:26:42.760 --> 03:26:47.000]  that someone's on that should be one of the first things that they look at that ought to be the
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:53.080]  principal thing that they look at because that is the principal link in all these mass shootings
[03:26:53.080 --> 03:26:59.480]  and suicides but that's not on the table because they are connected to big pharma and so is mainstream
[03:26:59.480 --> 03:27:05.080]  media but let's take a look at the hypocrisy of this shooting that went on and it was last saturday
[03:27:05.080 --> 03:27:10.760]  that it happened we have an article that appeared yesterday doctors without borders bombing say the
[03:27:10.760 --> 03:27:17.560]  us changed its story four times in four days they talk about the 2009 peace prize winner
[03:27:17.560 --> 03:27:23.640]  bombs the 1999 peace prize winner that would be doctors without borders borders who wanted
[03:27:23.640 --> 03:27:31.080]  to 1999 obama won it 10 years later they say saturday's initial summary involved us troops
[03:27:31.080 --> 03:27:35.800]  taking fire and conduce that's what they said to say we're under fire so we're sending somebody out
[03:27:35.800 --> 03:27:41.400]  there and they said we don't have any idea if we hit a hospital or not after a day they came back
[03:27:41.400 --> 03:27:45.160]  and they changed that said well it was somewhere in the vicinity then they said that they had
[03:27:45.160 --> 03:27:49.560]  not been called in that they had not called it in but it was called in by the afghans and then
[03:27:49.560 --> 03:27:54.280]  they change it from that and i'm going to stop here and go to our reporters who are in oregon
[03:27:54.280 --> 03:27:59.480]  they're in place right now and obama is landing there i think we're we've got joe biggs yes joe
[03:27:59.480 --> 03:28:04.520]  biggs is on the line go ahead joe uh if we look over to the left i don't know if you can tell
[03:28:04.520 --> 03:28:08.520]  i'll also have the audio on my ear um if you look over to the left there's a helicopter coming in
[03:28:08.520 --> 03:28:13.800]  they're doing a recon of the area right now over the roseburg high school now we just walk down a
[03:28:13.800 --> 03:28:17.800]  corridor to kind of go into a back area there's secret service everywhere they told us to leave
[03:28:17.800 --> 03:28:21.880]  and come back here on the main road because the department of transportation has shut this place
[03:28:21.880 --> 03:28:25.480]  down i mean it happened in two minutes i mean it's amazing if you've never been to one of these
[03:28:25.480 --> 03:28:31.000]  events where a president comes in they shut the entire town down so fast i mean it happened literally
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:35.960]  like 120 seconds just crazy but uh there's a lot of people up here protesting around the school
[03:28:35.960 --> 03:28:41.000]  as you can see up and down the roads it looks like he will be coming here to the high school there's
[03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:46.760]  a ton of homeland security vehicles police vehicles inside the parking lot over here they parked school
[03:28:46.760 --> 03:28:52.520]  buses in uh tactical uh ways i guess you would say to block off uh ramps and area like that so
[03:28:52.520 --> 03:28:59.080]  people can't drive through so we'll go out here and see what's going on you know joe it's interesting
[03:28:59.080 --> 03:29:03.320]  when he's got all that security and he wants to take all of our guns away is exactly what matt
[03:29:03.320 --> 03:29:08.360]  drudge was saying when he was in studio a couple of days ago right here look give up your guns give
[03:29:08.360 --> 03:29:13.640]  up your massive security looks like this is it a block
[03:29:19.240 --> 03:29:24.280]  there's a shot of the helicopter that's doing recon prior to his royal majesty landing
[03:29:26.600 --> 03:29:31.240]  they have a veritable army to protect the presidents the popes the vip's
[03:29:31.800 --> 03:29:36.440]  every time they go anywhere that's how afraid they are of us and yet
[03:29:36.440 --> 03:29:42.200]  they want to take our guns maybe there's a connection maybe they're concerned maybe they're
[03:29:42.200 --> 03:29:46.600]  worried we're going to be right back and we're going to see what happens as his majesty lands in
[03:29:46.600 --> 03:29:54.600]  oregon we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:58.760 --> 03:30:05.720]  no whites allowed a yoga studio in seattle is promoting racial discrimination by holding
[03:30:05.720 --> 03:30:12.360]  special sessions that explicitly excludes whites rainier beach yoga in seattle has
[03:30:12.360 --> 03:30:20.280]  created a special class called yoga for people of color an exclusionary yoga session whose rules
[03:30:20.280 --> 03:30:26.840]  expressly forbid white people an email blast from the yoga studio says white friends allies and
[03:30:26.840 --> 03:30:34.040]  partners are respectfully asked not to attend the class also invites lesbian bisexual gay queer and
[03:30:34.040 --> 03:30:39.800]  trans friendly people but no whites allowed hmm i wonder what would happen if the roles were
[03:30:39.800 --> 03:30:45.800]  reversed and there was a yoga class for whites only i'm sure the liberals across the country
[03:30:45.800 --> 03:30:51.480]  would be outraged and the mainstream media would make it a national story and you can learn more

[03:33:07.960 --> 03:33:15.160]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your
[03:33:15.160 --> 03:33:21.560]  host on this friday october 9th 2015 we have reporters on the ground in oregon we have is royal
[03:33:21.560 --> 03:33:28.440]  heinous obama about to land and make a pronouncement i guess for he's he's talked about how he's going
[03:33:28.440 --> 03:33:34.360]  to go around congress well he's also going to go around the second amendment and make his own
[03:33:34.920 --> 03:33:39.400]  pronouncements create his own regulations we need to understand that this is something that
[03:33:39.400 --> 03:33:43.720]  regulatory agencies quite frankly have been allowed to get away with for a very long time
[03:33:43.720 --> 03:33:48.600]  once they create a regulatory agency these regulatory agencies are writing the laws they
[03:33:48.600 --> 03:33:54.280]  call them rules or regulations but their laws and then they have their own police to enforce them
[03:33:54.280 --> 03:33:59.080]  and then they have their own courts where you go before them and because it's not a quote unquote
[03:33:59.080 --> 03:34:03.960]  criminal investigation your due process your presumption of innocence is shut down we've
[03:34:03.960 --> 03:34:08.600]  tolerated this for a very long time the only time that congress ever gets involved is when
[03:34:08.600 --> 03:34:14.280]  we have a high profile case and they come in like white knights to protect us but they have set up
[03:34:14.280 --> 03:34:19.480]  the system they have abdicated their authority just as we see them abdicating their authority
[03:34:19.480 --> 03:34:25.880]  with these trans pacific partnership transatlantic partnerships they're not partnerships well in a
[03:34:25.880 --> 03:34:30.680]  sense they are their partnerships between the multinational corporations who are taking over
[03:34:30.680 --> 03:34:36.200]  all the governments of the world they're creating a transnational organization that is more powerful
[03:34:36.200 --> 03:34:40.520]  than all the governments and one of the evidences of this is a fact that they have negotiated this
[03:34:40.520 --> 03:34:44.680]  thing in secret for years they don't allow us to know what's in it they don't allow our
[03:34:44.680 --> 03:34:49.640]  representatives to know what's in it and they're going to ram this thing through congress but now
[03:34:49.640 --> 03:34:54.600]  we have a president who is doing the same thing that we've seen the bureaucracies get away with
[03:34:54.600 --> 03:35:01.000]  for many many years roseburg residents there in oregon are telling obama stop using the tragedy
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:07.000]  to take liberty this is a story that's up on info wars dot com from paul joseph watson he says
[03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:12.520]  organizers are accusing the president of using quote cowardly murderers to achieve your goals
[03:35:12.520 --> 03:35:18.680]  unquote kit lang who runs a facebook page called defend roseburg deny barack obama says no more
[03:35:18.680 --> 03:35:25.800]  using tragedy as a play to take more liberty no more using grieving families as a pit stop on the
[03:35:25.800 --> 03:35:32.680]  way to another fundraiser no more using cowardly murderers to achieve your goal no not one more
[03:35:32.680 --> 03:35:40.680]  step toward taking our means to self-defense our means to refuse slavery exactly that's
[03:35:40.680 --> 03:35:45.800]  what the second amendment is about is to keep us from being enslaved to an out of control government
[03:35:45.800 --> 03:35:51.080]  what do we see in washington now precisely that let me give you a contrast here here's a mayor of
[03:35:51.080 --> 03:35:57.880]  jerusalem calling on citizens to carry guns after a wave of stabbings they've had four people stabbed
[03:35:58.600 --> 03:36:05.080]  in the last week or so in israel and so the mayor there is saying of course the latest victim was
[03:36:05.080 --> 03:36:09.880]  a 14 year old and also a police officer but when you look at the 14 year old you understand that
[03:36:09.880 --> 03:36:17.720]  one of the reasons that that firearms are an effective means especially for women for younger
[03:36:17.720 --> 03:36:23.960]  people is because when you are in a in a situation where you're at a strength disadvantage firearms
[03:36:23.960 --> 03:36:30.440]  can neutralize that for a woman you don't want to have to get into a knife fight with somebody
[03:36:30.440 --> 03:36:34.920]  that's quite a bit larger than you so if you're well trained on a firearm if you're a responsible
[03:36:34.920 --> 03:36:39.560]  person it's an opportunity for you to protect yourself and that's what the jerusalem mayor said
[03:36:39.560 --> 03:36:44.440]  he said i carry a firearm i try to encourage other people to train themselves so that they
[03:36:44.440 --> 03:36:50.600]  can protect themselves but that's not what we see from our president we have a president who is
[03:36:50.600 --> 03:36:57.880]  presiding over military that just shot up a hospital last saturday for 30 minutes doctors
[03:36:57.880 --> 03:37:04.040]  without borders the people who won the nobel peace peace prize in 1999 10 years before obama was
[03:37:04.040 --> 03:37:09.480]  given the nobel peace prize what a farce that was he just take an office and they gave him a
[03:37:09.480 --> 03:37:15.080]  nobel peace prize he hadn't done anything to deserve it whatsoever and he was the one who
[03:37:15.080 --> 03:37:22.680]  bombed this hospital for 30 minutes quite frankly they contacted washington they contacted cabool
[03:37:22.680 --> 03:37:28.440]  in afghanistan and they had told them repeatedly that this was a hospital they had given them the
[03:37:28.440 --> 03:37:34.600]  gps coordinates nevertheless the attack continued for 30 minutes for four days we got a different
[03:37:34.600 --> 03:37:40.840]  story every day from washington but obama is not going there he's not going there to console the
[03:37:40.840 --> 03:37:47.400]  victims he's not going there to investigate what went wrong no he's going to a place where
[03:37:47.400 --> 03:37:52.920]  someone who has hyped up on drugs most likely we saw the story from paul joseph watson that was
[03:37:52.920 --> 03:38:00.920]  linked on drudge talking about how he reportedly called himself lithium lover he was in a a school
[03:38:00.920 --> 03:38:05.880]  that was for troubled students there's every indication that he was on a lot of meds a lot
[03:38:05.880 --> 03:38:10.520]  of psychological evaluation do we have them available we're seeing some footage there are our
[03:38:10.520 --> 03:38:15.880]  guys there okay so this is the counter demonstration that we're taking a look at there that was a
[03:38:15.880 --> 03:38:22.440]  fox feed that we had there are a lot of people in roseburg that are furious that obama is
[03:38:22.440 --> 03:38:27.400]  politicizing this and that's precisely what he called for and of course we had the mayor i'm
[03:38:27.400 --> 03:38:33.400]  sorry the governor uh quomo of new york saying that we need to shut down the government i didn't
[03:38:33.400 --> 03:38:37.400]  think liberals ever wanted to shut the government down for any reason but he says we need to shut
[03:38:37.400 --> 03:38:42.600]  the government down until we enact gun control meaning gun confiscation because they're admitting
[03:38:42.600 --> 03:38:48.120]  now that in these last several shootings their proposed gun laws would not have made any difference
[03:38:48.120 --> 03:38:53.880]  whatsoever so now they want all out confiscation they've hinted at it they're now talking about
[03:38:53.880 --> 03:39:00.200]  doing it directly there's another article up from npr talking about the gun debate divides the nation's
[03:39:00.200 --> 03:39:05.240]  police officers as well and one of the persons that they're talking about is the local sheriff
[03:39:05.240 --> 03:39:09.800]  there in organ john handlin they said he had written a letter to vice president joe biden shortly
[03:39:09.800 --> 03:39:15.000]  after the shooting in sandy hook elementary school saying that gun control was not the
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:20.440]  answer in the letter he pledged not to enforce gun regulations that he believed to be unconstitutional
[03:39:20.440 --> 03:39:25.080]  and this is what npr says i thought this was very interesting they said what wasn't widely reported
[03:39:25.080 --> 03:39:30.520]  was how common views like handlins have become in law enforcement and they go to talk about
[03:39:30.520 --> 03:39:36.520]  david clark the sheriff in milwaukee and they talk about how police chiefs initially resisted
[03:39:36.520 --> 03:39:41.720]  the expansion of gun permits and so there's been a massive increase in the number of firearms
[03:39:41.720 --> 03:39:47.080]  yeah isn't that interesting as we reported even though fire private firearms ownership has gone up
[03:39:47.080 --> 03:39:55.000]  60 percent then violent crime with guns has gone down 50 percent so it goes up the ownership goes up
[03:39:55.000 --> 03:40:00.280]  and the violence from guns goes down isn't that interesting that's what we've been saying
[03:40:00.280 --> 03:40:04.200]  would happen and that's precisely what has happened so they say police chiefs initially
[03:40:04.200 --> 03:40:08.840]  resisted the expansion of gun permits but he says many of them changed their minds when they saw
[03:40:08.840 --> 03:40:14.520]  that increased permits didn't cause a big increase in shooting no actually caused a decrease and that
[03:40:14.520 --> 03:40:20.600]  is what sheriff clark uh has said in in milwaukee he says i can't be there right away you need to
[03:40:20.600 --> 03:40:25.080]  be able to protect yourself until i can get officers there we'll catch the guys but we
[03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:30.200]  can't be there to protect you initially also talk about the sheriff in roseburg again sheriff
[03:40:30.200 --> 03:40:35.800]  john handlin he says this law is not going to protect the citizens of oregon we have laws
[03:40:35.800 --> 03:40:41.560]  that prohibit the possession of other things like methamphetamine and it doesn't help and i would
[03:40:41.560 --> 03:40:49.240]  point out precisely what has drug prohibition done for us let's go to begs right now he is on the
[03:40:49.240 --> 03:40:53.640]  ground let's go begs go ahead yeah so we're standing out here right now outside of the roseburg
[03:40:53.640 --> 03:40:58.280]  high school we just got word from over at the airport that uh obama has arrived and he is now
[03:40:58.280 --> 03:41:02.840]  in his motorcade heading over this way right now and as you can see there's a whole lot of security
[03:41:02.840 --> 03:41:07.320]  out here supposedly he's going to come in here and speak to some of the uh families of the victims
[03:41:07.320 --> 03:41:12.120]  of the shooting and try to push his anti-gun agenda like always he always tries to take advantage
[03:41:12.120 --> 03:41:16.520]  of a situation as soon as something happens to push that narrative because gunfree zones are
[03:41:16.520 --> 03:41:20.840]  kill zones when you look at places like switzerland where they're highly armed the civilian population
[03:41:20.840 --> 03:41:27.800]  has a lot of weapons you don't have a high crime rate meanwhile here they put us in these situations
[03:41:27.800 --> 03:41:32.040]  where you can't just like the recruiting offices in chattanooga these guys didn't have the ability
[03:41:32.040 --> 03:41:37.560]  to defend themselves and it turned into a kill zone so hopefully you know as we see there's been a
[03:41:37.560 --> 03:41:42.760]  lot of people show up today who don't like what obama has to say they uh they want to they want
[03:41:42.760 --> 03:41:47.800]  to have they want to talk about how he is basically turning people into victims and not giving them
[03:41:47.800 --> 03:41:51.880]  the ability and the right to protect themselves let me ask you something joe because i've been
[03:41:51.880 --> 03:41:57.880]  talking about the uh the hospital shooting that obama is responsible for in afghanistan uh what
[03:41:57.880 --> 03:42:02.920]  do you think about somebody that in violation of the genealogy convention shoots up an ambulance
[03:42:02.920 --> 03:42:07.960]  or shoots a medic or shoots up a hospital when they're warned about it the the attack continued
[03:42:07.960 --> 03:42:13.480]  for 30 minutes why don't you think obama would go to investigate that well it's the first it's
[03:42:13.480 --> 03:42:18.760]  the first time a nobel uh prize winner as bomb another nobel prize winner so i think that's
[03:42:18.760 --> 03:42:24.840]  pretty interesting yeah yeah pretty amazing i mean isn't isn't that as a as a former soldier
[03:42:24.840 --> 03:42:31.320]  don't you think that's kind of the lowest crime that somebody can commit and war to shoot up a
[03:42:31.320 --> 03:42:36.840]  an ambulance or to shoot up a medic or something like that oh of course it completely is i mean the
[03:42:36.840 --> 03:42:41.480]  fact that they can't even come out and you know say hey we're sorry we messed up and they're just
[03:42:41.480 --> 03:42:45.640]  kind of you're sweeping under the rug it just shows you that he really doesn't care i mean he
[03:42:45.640 --> 03:42:50.520]  wants to push for gun control meanwhile he you know is drone striking people and mass numbers
[03:42:50.520 --> 03:42:54.040]  and killing innocent civilians left and right it's just out of control i think that's a real key
[03:42:54.040 --> 03:42:58.680]  what you just said the fact that they can't even say we did something wrong we got four different
[03:42:58.680 --> 03:43:03.720]  stories on four consecutive days they still won't say that they did anything wrong what we got from
[03:43:03.720 --> 03:43:09.640]  the pentagon was well you know al qaeda was in the area and i think they're using kunduz uh the
[03:43:09.640 --> 03:43:14.600]  civilians of kunduz as a shield it doesn't matter does it show if you've got enemy combatants i mean
[03:43:14.600 --> 03:43:20.440]  you could have a hospital full of nazis they could be ss officers but according to geneva convention
[03:43:20.440 --> 03:43:26.360]  you're not allowed to bomb that hospital repeatedly for a half hour when people tell you in case you
[03:43:26.360 --> 03:43:30.760]  didn't know i mean certainly something can happen by accident this was not an accident
[03:43:30.760 --> 03:43:34.600]  it continued for 30 minutes and of course they pointed out that they'd been notified multiple
[03:43:34.600 --> 03:43:39.480]  times with preceding weeks that it was there given the exact gps coordinates is something developing
[03:43:39.480 --> 03:43:46.440]  there oh i haven't heard in that uh in that instance uh david no yeah yeah um yeah it's
[03:43:46.440 --> 03:43:51.320]  absolutely amazing to me that uh he would not be interested in admitting any wrongdoing that he
[03:43:51.320 --> 03:43:56.840]  would not be interested in evaluating that as uh just before we came to you joe i was talking about
[03:43:56.840 --> 03:44:03.000]  the sheriff there in organ uh sheriff john henland and roseburg yes have you had a chance to talk to
[03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:08.040]  him um not yet i heard from some people that he might show up today uh so we'll see what happens
[03:44:08.040 --> 03:44:12.280]  if we can catch him we'll try and talk to him and uh you know see what his outlook is on this whole
[03:44:12.280 --> 03:44:17.960]  scenario and what he thinks about obama coming out here and defying you know essentially the mass
[03:44:17.960 --> 03:44:21.640]  majority of the people here in roseburg that you know quite frankly just don't want him out here
[03:44:21.640 --> 03:44:25.640]  pushing that agenda we know one of the things that the sheriff said he says you know we have
[03:44:25.640 --> 03:44:31.400]  laws that prohibit the possession of other things like methamphetamine but it doesn't stop it and i
[03:44:31.400 --> 03:44:37.240]  thought that was a really good analogy because you know meth came about because of the drug war
[03:44:37.240 --> 03:44:41.960]  we saw this with alcohol prohibition and we've seen it now with drug prohibition that it is
[03:44:41.960 --> 03:44:47.960]  created uh alcohol prohibition created much more concentrated and intense uh variants of alcohol
[03:44:47.960 --> 03:44:52.200]  people went from drinking beer to drinking hard liquor to drinking very dangerous things that
[03:44:52.200 --> 03:44:56.680]  were concocted at home like bathtub gin and now we see the invention of things like meth
[03:44:57.400 --> 03:45:02.200]  and that's precisely what's going to happen isn't it joe when we have gun prohibition can you imagine
[03:45:02.200 --> 03:45:08.040]  when we see what happened with uh drugs if they were to prohibit guns can you imagine
[03:45:08.040 --> 03:45:13.880]  how what kind of firearms would be invented overnight if all of this were released you
[03:45:13.880 --> 03:45:19.480]  just came back from a gun show in uh in florida oh it would be like it would be like medieval
[03:45:19.480 --> 03:45:23.560]  times all over again you know they're going to create whatever they came out of necessity
[03:45:23.560 --> 03:45:28.120]  to be able to defend themselves i mean at the end of the day it's going to happen i mean people
[03:45:28.120 --> 03:45:30.840]  are going to want to defend themselves if you take one thing away they're going to find another
[03:45:30.840 --> 03:45:34.840]  thing to use instead of you know in place of that object so it's really not going to matter
[03:45:34.840 --> 03:45:37.640]  we have to get to the root of the problem we have to get to the root of the problem why people
[03:45:37.640 --> 03:45:43.080]  are doing this you know like i was on alex earlier anytime you you turn on tv and you see
[03:45:43.080 --> 03:45:49.080]  commercial for a drug the side effects suppression possible suicide attempts uh thoughts to harm
[03:45:49.080 --> 03:45:53.560]  yourself and others you know that's where we need to look that's where there needs to be
[03:45:53.560 --> 03:45:57.640]  strict or control that of what's being put in our medications what's being put in our foods
[03:45:57.640 --> 03:46:00.760]  absolutely that's what they need to look at if they're going to look at background checks
[03:46:00.760 --> 03:46:04.840]  thank you joe we're going to go to jacari i understand that he's uh in another location
[03:46:04.840 --> 03:46:09.880]  ready to report let's uh we'll come back to you let's go to jacari jackson also in oregon
[03:46:11.480 --> 03:46:15.960]  how you doing david jacari jackson yes i had to take a break i had to run way down the street
[03:46:15.960 --> 03:46:21.720]  trying to get a shot of president obama's motorcade actually did succeed uh photographer matthew
[03:46:21.720 --> 03:46:26.920]  also got a few shots of the uh just coming in we'll put that footage out on info wars dot com
[03:46:26.920 --> 03:46:30.760]  later on tonight but yeah you can see the crowd is starting to thin out right now the motorcade
[03:46:30.760 --> 03:46:34.760]  has passed it's going i believe towards the school where the shooting happened so obama's
[03:46:34.760 --> 03:46:39.160]  going to speak out there or at least speak privately to the families then uh when i was out
[03:46:39.160 --> 03:46:44.040]  there close to the motorcade that's the first time i actually encountered some uh obama supporters
[03:46:44.040 --> 03:46:48.120]  and that whole lot of time talked to him i was moving pretty well some people actually cheered
[03:46:48.120 --> 03:46:51.640]  five years down here so you know they do have obama supporters here but the majority of the
[03:46:51.640 --> 03:46:55.960]  people here they understand you know yes he was a president and he probably needs to go and speak
[03:46:55.960 --> 03:47:01.080]  to the families after a tragedy like this they're concerned and the issue is the fact that he's
[03:47:01.080 --> 03:47:05.400]  coming out here simultaneously to push his gun control agenda while he's surrounded by secret
[03:47:05.400 --> 03:47:10.760]  service i got shot of snipers and ruse there's a helicopter i believe it was a a national guard
[03:47:10.760 --> 03:47:15.960]  or a coast guard helicopter with a sniper hanging out of it not to mention the you know 15 20 car
[03:47:15.960 --> 03:47:20.440]  motorcade that he has so he has plenty of security so the people say if he has all this visible
[03:47:20.440 --> 03:47:25.320]  security why can't they do something as simple as carry a concealed weapon yeah that's that's
[03:47:25.320 --> 03:47:31.400]  amazing and you know of course the thing that concerns so many of us is is it's beyond just
[03:47:31.400 --> 03:47:37.000]  a gun control agenda he's wrong on that argument but as the article from reason magazine pointed
[03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:41.320]  out yesterday there's a process if you want to change uh our gun laws if you want to change
[03:47:41.320 --> 03:47:44.520]  the second amendment if you want to amend the constitution you have to get a lot of people
[03:47:44.520 --> 03:47:47.960]  elected you have to create an amendment to the constitution then you have to propose
[03:47:47.960 --> 03:47:52.920]  legislation and then you have to go take it from the people who aren't going to turn it in because
[03:47:52.920 --> 03:47:58.200]  they understand that it is a fundamental right uh but that's the thing that concerns a lot of
[03:47:58.200 --> 03:48:04.120]  people i think is that obama is going to try to bypass all of those steps that keep us from having
[03:48:04.120 --> 03:48:08.920]  anarchy that keep us from having a totalitarian dictatorship and he's talking about just doing
[03:48:08.920 --> 03:48:14.120]  this by fiat well we've heard him say that you know he has his pen and his cell phone and all
[03:48:14.120 --> 03:48:18.600]  these other things when he tries to get other things passed so i wouldn't put in past on him to
[03:48:18.600 --> 03:48:23.400]  try to do something like that similar in this situation he definitely knows that every time
[03:48:23.400 --> 03:48:28.280]  one of these shootings happens uh americans go out and buy more firearms and buy more ammunition
[03:48:28.280 --> 03:48:31.320]  it's not because they're planning a mass murder spree is that they understand that
[03:48:31.320 --> 03:48:35.320]  that it may become a day when they need to defend themselves and big governor so i could be there to
[03:48:35.320 --> 03:48:40.840]  do it for them yes because we've seen uh in new york washington and philadelphia when you and i
[03:48:40.840 --> 03:48:45.480]  were there covering the pope we know what the mission of government is the mission of government
[03:48:45.480 --> 03:48:51.640]  is to protect government officials it's to uh ensure exactly right david yeah so to ensure a
[03:48:51.640 --> 03:48:56.200]  continuity of government it is not there to protect the citizens it's there to protect the
[03:48:56.200 --> 03:49:01.080]  government from the citizens that's what it's become and we have the second amendment and we
[03:49:01.080 --> 03:49:08.280]  have private firearm arms ownership as a means of peacefully letting the government know that
[03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:13.720]  they don't want to go too far is kind of a mutual assured destruction like we had with the cold war
[03:49:13.720 --> 03:49:18.840]  we hope that it doesn't go into a situation where it escalates into a civil war and having
[03:49:18.840 --> 03:49:24.920]  citizens armed is the best peaceful check against that kind of violence that can come from the
[03:49:24.920 --> 03:49:31.640]  government that we've seen happen in every country that has that confiscated uh that had massive uh
[03:49:32.920 --> 03:49:36.840]  killing of their citizenship we saw that preceded by gun confiscation exactly
[03:49:38.200 --> 03:49:42.040]  yes and if everybody talks about britain and all these other places we'll look at places like
[03:49:42.040 --> 03:49:47.400]  mexico where you know they have very low civilian ownership of firearms set for the car sales
[03:49:47.400 --> 03:49:50.840]  who have returned in their firearms and riding around in the back of trucks shooting people
[03:49:50.840 --> 03:49:55.240]  like it's mad max and this is happening on a normal regular basis and the people of mexico
[03:49:55.240 --> 03:49:58.760]  just have to deal with it because besides the fact that our government is shipping guns down there
[03:49:58.760 --> 03:50:02.520]  that's a different issue they just have these cartels running wild and they don't have the proper
[03:50:02.520 --> 03:50:08.920]  means to defend themselves well and jacari is as uh that uh documentary that alex interviewed the
[03:50:08.920 --> 03:50:14.200]  director i can't recall the name of the documentary but it was a documentary about the vigilantes in
[03:50:14.200 --> 03:50:18.920]  mexico they realized that the federal government there was not protecting the people from the
[03:50:18.920 --> 03:50:23.880]  drug dealers they were at the mercy of both the federal government and the drug dealers
[03:50:23.880 --> 03:50:29.480]  and the massive corruption what was cartel land yes thank you cartel land they were at the mercy
[03:50:29.480 --> 03:50:35.400]  of both the bandits and the government just like the story of uh the uh magnificent seven
[03:50:35.400 --> 03:50:40.760]  and the only way that they were able to survive was to arm themselves and that's precisely what
[03:50:40.760 --> 03:50:45.400]  they did that's what we recognize with the second amendment thank you so much jacari tonight we're
[03:50:45.400 --> 03:50:49.720]  going to have uh both reporters giving us updates as to what's going on in oregon stay with us we'll

[03:54:28.680 --> 03:54:34.040]  what happened from the in the words of doctors without borders at the hospital that the obama

[03:54:40.360 --> 03:54:44.920]  go in and shoot up a hospital and of course he's not there investigating that they had there hasn't
[03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:49.960]  been any apology about that there hasn't been any admission of wrongdoing about that we're

[03:55:29.400 --> 03:55:37.160]  life dot com let's go back to what obama really should be taking responsibility for what he really
[03:55:37.160 --> 03:55:42.840]  should be concerned about and of course that's the shooting of the hospital in afghanistan and
[03:55:42.840 --> 03:55:48.600]  kunduz afghanistan this is a report from npr they say doctors without borders are now doctors in
[03:55:48.600 --> 03:55:54.120]  anguish as part of this interview they're talking about asking what the situation is there they say
[03:55:54.120 --> 03:56:00.440]  at least 12 medical workers at least seven patients were dead three of those patients at least were
[03:56:00.440 --> 03:56:06.600]  children the patients died in their beds burning to death in most of these cases they say nine
[03:56:06.600 --> 03:56:12.760]  patients are still unaccounted for we've not been able to reach 24 of our 461 staff members said
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:18.120]  their executive director they say that they're demanding an investigation by the commission
[03:56:18.120 --> 03:56:22.920]  that's been established by the geneva conventions at the international humanitarian fact finding
[03:56:22.920 --> 03:56:27.160]  commission they say they're not pushing for a criminal investigation they want a fact finding
[03:56:27.880 --> 03:56:33.400]  commission to look at this to find out what went wrong and what they can do to stop this again
[03:56:33.960 --> 03:56:38.040]  now understand that they had notified multiple times as i mentioned earlier multiple times they
[03:56:38.040 --> 03:56:43.400]  had informed both the afghan and the u.s government of their location their gps coordinates as this
[03:56:43.400 --> 03:56:49.160]  attack began they contacted both the afghan and the u.s government asked them to call it off but
[03:56:49.160 --> 03:56:55.880]  the planes continued the attack for 30 minutes he says the commission has not been called upon
[03:56:55.880 --> 03:57:02.840]  to act since it was established in 1991 and it requires a request from at least 76 nations that
[03:57:02.840 --> 03:57:07.720]  have signed on to it to begin its work and one of the things that he says is what we would like to
[03:57:07.720 --> 03:57:13.560]  see is the u.s calling for an investigation or the u.s investigating the supporting an investigation
[03:57:13.560 --> 03:57:18.360]  but instead obama goes to oregon now they say your organization has worked for many years
[03:57:18.360 --> 03:57:23.000]  in very dangerous places how does this attack compare with doctors without borders previous
[03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:28.360]  experience with danger or death he says well in terms of one single violent event this is the
[03:57:28.360 --> 03:57:33.960]  biggest loss we've had beyond that this is the most exceptional event in that it was the direct
[03:57:33.960 --> 03:57:40.280]  targeting of a medical facility with a large loss of life we fully communicated it was a functional
[03:57:40.280 --> 03:57:45.640]  hospital full of patients and staff it really shook us up in terms of a lack of respect for
[03:57:45.640 --> 03:57:50.440]  human law and i would say also of course human life they went on to ask him they said well what
[03:57:50.440 --> 03:57:55.400]  steps should be taken to assure hospitals are respected as fighting zones and fighting free
[03:57:55.400 --> 03:58:02.120]  zones and he doesn't call for any new laws isn't that interesting he calls for just obeying the
[03:58:02.120 --> 03:58:08.920]  laws that have been on the books for decades but of course our government won't do that and obama
[03:58:08.920 --> 03:58:13.640]  won't obey the second amendment either join us tonight for the nightly news at seven central
