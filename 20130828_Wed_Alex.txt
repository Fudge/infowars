[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:36.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.760 --> 00:41.800]  ladies and gentlemen we are live and we're broadcasting worldwide on this
[00:41.800 --> 00:49.160]  Wednesday the 28th day of August 2013 worldwide transmission and we are going
[00:49.160 --> 00:55.040]  to be here for the next three hours Mark Moreno will pop in for 30 minutes from
[00:55.040 --> 00:59.920]  climate depot to look at the big push to bring carbon taxes into a higher level
[00:59.920 --> 01:05.120]  Obama raising the cost of carbon in a microwave regulation to even sign an
[01:05.120 --> 01:09.000]  executive order that would be unconstitutional but the big news
[01:09.000 --> 01:15.000]  obviously is the Syria situation funny that in this day in history back in
[01:15.000 --> 01:23.320]  1916 on the 28th day of August World War one Italy declares war on Germany so
[01:23.320 --> 01:28.760]  really the kickoff of World War one started right around this time back in
[01:28.760 --> 01:34.360]  1916 always a good time to get a war going for the upcoming fall always good
[01:34.360 --> 01:38.720]  for the kleptocrats to have a bunch of no bid no bid contracts they've they've
[01:38.720 --> 01:42.040]  learned that a lot can happen while everybody's distracted and diverted
[01:42.040 --> 01:48.960]  with a war now coming up here on the transmission today we're going to look
[01:48.960 --> 01:52.560]  at lawmakers have signed a petition asking Obama to seek congressional
[01:52.560 --> 02:00.680]  approval for Syria strike 56 bipartisan House members have demanded
[02:00.680 --> 02:06.240]  President Obama follow the Constitution yeah a couple years ago with Libya they
[02:06.240 --> 02:09.920]  said we we've got NATO approval and you an approval even they didn't really even
[02:09.920 --> 02:14.680]  have you an approval to do this when you don't need NATO or you an approval to
[02:14.680 --> 02:20.320]  have a military action it's Congress under the Constitution under federal law
[02:20.320 --> 02:27.040]  it is a high crime impeachable offense big time that's not debated by the way
[02:27.040 --> 02:32.200]  that's on record no one debates that but they had top generals in fact will you
[02:32.200 --> 02:36.560]  guys ask McBreen he has that actually clipped out for Obama deception the
[02:36.560 --> 02:42.280]  specific clip I want I forgot to tell him this morning to ship that clip over
[02:42.280 --> 02:47.560]  Panetta when he was the head of the Secretary of Defense last year saying
[02:47.560 --> 02:54.760]  hey we don't need Congress to attack Syria if we want when they were saying
[02:54.760 --> 03:00.480]  hey you didn't get approval for Libya so we forget that's gone on that is a big
[03:00.480 --> 03:06.040]  big big deal and so now there's not even you an approval for this so this is the
[03:06.040 --> 03:10.400]  presidency becoming a dictatorship that doesn't mean Obama will stay in office
[03:10.400 --> 03:14.800]  it means the office itself in the bureaucracy and the corporate interests
[03:14.800 --> 03:20.800]  that control it are entirely rogue here's the big news though and I started
[03:20.800 --> 03:24.200]  saying this last few days but now it's clear even in mainstream media there is
[03:24.200 --> 03:32.080]  a all-out route right now of the warmongers on the left and the right
[03:32.080 --> 03:39.040]  John McCain Obama all of them there is a total route going on right now with
[03:39.040 --> 03:42.920]  even Sean Hannity and now Glenn Beck coming out and saying this could cause
[03:42.920 --> 03:47.840]  World War three we need anti-war protesters on the streets and our
[03:47.840 --> 03:52.480]  government is backing Al Qaeda against Assad the globalists have finally jumped
[03:52.480 --> 03:57.520]  the shark they have finally gone so over the top with jihadis blowing up
[03:57.520 --> 04:02.880]  churches all over the Middle East from Libya to Egypt to Syria and engaging in

[08:22.840 --> 08:39.280]  the resistance it's alex jones all right my friends we are going to obviously
[08:39.280 --> 08:48.880]  be covering the huge geopolitical ramifications today of just talk about
[08:48.880 --> 08:56.520]  imminent air bombardments with jet aircraft and cruise missiles of the
[08:56.520 --> 09:02.200]  sovereign nation of syria but I want to make something clear here directly out
[09:02.200 --> 09:05.400]  of the gates today before we break all this down and go to your phone calls
[09:05.400 --> 09:17.160]  and it's this there has been a war going on against Syria for two years and nine
[09:17.160 --> 09:29.720]  months using brigades of Saudi Arabian and Qatari and Egyptian as well as
[09:29.720 --> 09:36.680]  Libyan Wahhabis Wahhabis the folks hired by the British overthrow
[09:36.680 --> 09:42.880]  governments 98 years ago the people hired 60 something years ago by Hitler
[09:42.880 --> 09:46.720]  to overthrow governments they were nobodies until the British hired them
[09:46.720 --> 09:53.560]  a few bands warlike bands in Saudi Arabia with Saudi Arabia today so when
[09:53.560 --> 09:58.760]  they talk about all the terrible stuff going on in Syria and oh the army
[09:58.760 --> 10:03.160]  massacring citizens they're never showing real evidence of that the Syrian
[10:03.160 --> 10:09.920]  military is fighting military and in the al Qaeda forces are chopping people's
[10:09.920 --> 10:13.920]  hearts out burning down every church they get murdering Christians murdering
[10:13.920 --> 10:19.800]  Jews murdering Alawite Muslims murdering Shiite Muslims folks I'm not an Alawite
[10:19.800 --> 10:24.760]  I'm not a Shiite I'm not a Sunni I am a Christian but those are all human beings
[10:24.760 --> 10:29.640]  and I'm upset no matter whether they're Sunni or Shiite or Alawite or Christian
[10:29.640 --> 10:36.640]  Coptic Catholic Protestant Jewish whatever they're all human beings and so to
[10:36.640 --> 10:46.600]  sit there and to watch somebody like Secretary of State Kerry say we know
[10:46.600 --> 10:51.760]  they did it without saying the name Assad or the regime and we know there's
[10:51.760 --> 10:54.760]  clear evidence and then he says the clear evidence six minutes under the
[10:54.760 --> 10:59.920]  seven-minute speech two days ago it's so key is we don't know who did it but we
[10:59.920 --> 11:04.280]  know it happened so we've got to invade and then the media went with Kerry
[11:04.280 --> 11:08.640]  saying that they had proof Assad did it folks they know their rebels did it and
[11:08.640 --> 11:14.080]  it came out yesterday in the foreign press in the Egyptian press and in the
[11:14.080 --> 11:18.360]  US press for yet World End Daily and Info Wars and other sites like that with
[11:18.360 --> 11:24.120]  the videos of last week when the chemical attack happened that day and the day
[11:24.120 --> 11:28.880]  before turns out that the attack happened before they said it did in one
[11:28.880 --> 11:33.120]  case looks like there was multiple attacks they were uploading the videos
[11:33.120 --> 11:42.000]  of themselves loading the mortars on to the
[11:43.040 --> 11:48.280]  systems and firing the mortars the chemical mortars into the neighborhoods
[11:48.280 --> 11:53.000]  and then the whole media the Saudi Arabian TV network they're priming it
[11:53.000 --> 12:01.520]  the Saudi Arabian head of intelligence went to Russia and openly threatened
[12:01.520 --> 12:05.120]  we're gonna get to this coming up and this has got no attention Steve Watson
[12:05.120 --> 12:08.240]  wrote about it yesterday Paul Watson said this morning he couldn't believe it
[12:08.240 --> 12:13.320]  got no attention and actually set on record in a council meeting with the
[12:13.320 --> 12:18.480]  leaders of Russia we're going to activate the Chechen terrorist we control by
[12:18.480 --> 12:22.440]  the way the same ones the West has been funding the Zarnab brothers were part of
[12:22.440 --> 12:26.880]  that the older brother paid by the CIA to go over there definitely a double
[12:26.880 --> 12:34.800]  agent bare minimum the botston bombing cutouts the patsies clearly said we're
[12:34.800 --> 12:41.280]  gonna start it blowing up all sorts of stuff in Russia if you don't back off in
[12:41.280 --> 12:45.760]  Syria and in fact that's the deals that have been made over and over again is
[12:45.760 --> 12:50.480]  that well the West has said they made deals with Russia but Russia says they
[12:50.480 --> 12:54.680]  haven't made the deal that they've been offering the deal that they will leave
[12:54.680 --> 13:00.840]  the entire southern belly of Russia alone more than six different stands that
[13:00.840 --> 13:04.040]  border them and then several areas like Chechnya that are officially part of
[13:04.040 --> 13:08.800]  Russia there's more than like 15 states last time I checked that they've
[13:08.800 --> 13:13.640]  infiltrated with Muslims Muslim extremists that they will not destabilize
[13:13.640 --> 13:21.200]  Russia if they give them Syria but Russia knows that's not true so for
[13:21.200 --> 13:29.720]  someone who's geopolitically informed it is beyond frustrating to know the facts
[13:29.720 --> 13:36.120]  and to understand what's going on and to see the public being led around by the
[13:36.120 --> 13:43.200]  nose about its terrible Assad's crushing activist and protesters I know you've
[13:43.200 --> 13:48.800]  seen them say that on the news I've seen them the last week four or five times I
[13:48.800 --> 13:52.960]  don't even watch CNN we just kind of keep it on in the coffee area Fox in here
[13:52.960 --> 13:59.200]  MSNBC over in that area CNBC in another office so we can kind of monitor it so
[13:59.200 --> 14:02.240]  when I say I don't watch it we just kind of monitor it we don't really full-time
[14:02.240 --> 14:05.240]  watch it and every time I'm walking by it's like well
[14:05.240 --> 14:10.120]  so it's killing more activists and more the protesters they're still calling
[14:10.120 --> 14:15.320]  them protesters and not heavily armed with heavy and medium weapons heat
[14:15.320 --> 14:19.720]  seeking missiles tow missiles the list goes on and on obviously being given
[14:19.720 --> 14:25.640]  Western coordination with the satellite and the GPS CIA commandos British
[14:25.640 --> 14:31.520]  commandos Qatari commandos Australian commandos reportedly mercenaries
[14:31.520 --> 14:37.680]  French foreign legion they're big pouring in in the last six months of the
[14:37.680 --> 14:43.160]  two-and-a-half plus year conflict so so it's like watching the West start a fight
[14:43.160 --> 14:47.840]  10 bullies pile up and start beating Syria to a pulp they're slaughtering
[14:47.840 --> 14:52.680]  everybody when they get control unless they're al-qaeda types they're eating
[14:52.680 --> 14:58.320]  hearts on TV the it's unbelievable they're killing children choking them to
[14:58.320 --> 15:02.600]  death on television stuff we post on info wars but that I can't even watch
[15:02.600 --> 15:07.720]  anymore because quite frankly I I've become enraged and then become a total
[15:07.720 --> 15:12.360]  jerk here at the office I'll be honest I mean because I have humanity this stuff
[15:12.360 --> 15:15.320]  gets to me because deep down I understand if that can happen to them it
[15:15.320 --> 15:20.120]  can happen to my family people think of empathy as some loving Christian value
[15:20.120 --> 15:23.160]  really it's just good instincts ladies and gentlemen you don't want a bunch of
[15:23.160 --> 15:31.360]  bad evil stuff going on and I see all these yuppies and people that think
[15:31.360 --> 15:35.840]  they're going to be immune from all of this on on our viral YouTube videos from
[15:35.840 --> 15:39.120]  the daytime radio show the video feed that are posted with hundreds of
[15:39.120 --> 15:46.160]  thousands of views the last few days per video I see the the yuppies in there
[15:46.160 --> 15:51.960]  making jokes about how it's a big deal that that our governments behind rebels
[15:51.960 --> 15:59.640]  launching a chemical attack and that top experts like Dr. Corsi and Dr. Roberts and
[15:59.640 --> 16:05.000]  so many others by the way they've got top British ministers in the news saying
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.200]  back off this look this can cause World War three the Hawks are saying that
[16:09.200 --> 16:12.760]  General Dempsey the chairman of the Joint Chiefs who's known for being a
[16:12.760 --> 16:16.480]  warmonger compared to his counterparts the last three or four they kicked out
[16:16.480 --> 16:20.560]  it wouldn't go along with it and they had a scent come Fox Fallon and other
[16:20.560 --> 16:25.360]  people that have actually been in a lot of combat they have been holding back
[16:25.360 --> 16:28.080]  all this craziness because they know it can lead to World War three but the
[16:28.080 --> 16:33.320]  neocons some of the people in Israel some of the warmongers here in the US they
[16:33.320 --> 16:42.120]  want this folks Israel has now produced phone calls of the Syrian Defense
[16:42.120 --> 16:46.800]  Minister yelling at their chemical troops which are anti-chemical but
[16:46.800 --> 16:50.120]  also know how to use chemical it's always both ways who's doing this what's
[16:50.120 --> 16:53.960]  going on and they're using that as an example of saying see they're behind it
[16:53.960 --> 16:57.720]  no they've they're now release the phone calls to the US government they're
[16:57.720 --> 17:02.240]  public gonna play them on the news edited of course but they admit in the
[17:02.240 --> 17:05.800]  article Paul Watson's got with the links but it's also in Israeli papers that
[17:05.800 --> 17:10.120]  that that it's the head general yelling at the chemical core saying did you do
[17:10.120 --> 17:16.240]  this what's going on we told you no chemicals which shows Assad would not
[17:16.240 --> 17:20.920]  do this that's the evidence that Assad did it is the evidence that they're
[17:20.920 --> 17:24.280]  yelling at them and of course that's what you do when you're like did you do
[17:24.280 --> 17:28.400]  this what is going on what what's good of course they're panicking because they've
[17:28.400 --> 17:32.040]  been told they're gonna be attacked if this happens the last thing and Israel is
[17:32.040 --> 17:36.240]  the elements of Israel are using this as a pretext to try to get this party
[17:36.240 --> 17:41.360]  started and look fortune favors the bold I get that for some of the Israeli
[17:41.360 --> 17:44.640]  hawks but man let me tell you something you don't start World War three with
[17:44.640 --> 17:52.040]  Russia and China just knock it off and the same thing goes for Obama and the
[17:52.040 --> 17:59.040]  other crazy hawks like McCain trying to give him right cover you know coming out
[17:59.040 --> 18:02.120]  saying it's your fault there was a chemical attack you didn't do anything the
[18:02.120 --> 18:07.240]  last three times and so you you did this Obama trying to give him left cover
[18:07.240 --> 18:14.280]  with his people by giving him right cover the ladies and gentlemen it's on
[18:14.280 --> 18:18.400]  record the last three chemical attacks were the rebels that even came out in
[18:18.400 --> 18:24.400]  mainstream news here in the United States because the rebels are so out of
[18:24.400 --> 18:28.960]  control that they loved to videotape everything they do to be like rock stars

[24:20.840 --> 24:27.300]  I am this west farmer I make a living off the land alright my friends we are
[24:27.300 --> 24:34.340]  back live. Thank you for joining us. I want to be specific and clear here with everybody.
[24:34.340 --> 24:39.200]  We are seeing, regardless of what happens, one of the most historic things that's ever
[24:39.200 --> 24:44.440]  gone on, not just in the United States but worldwide. And I'm going to go through these
[24:44.440 --> 24:49.320]  numbers in a moment. There are polls coming out, not just in the U.S. showing 91 percent
[24:49.320 --> 24:54.400]  of Americans in scientific polls are against this war, and it's the most unpopular war
[24:54.400 --> 25:05.700]  probably in U.S. history. But polls in Europe are showing similar numbers. And very quickly
[25:05.700 --> 25:12.420]  we're seeing the alternative media in the last few days force the government and the
[25:12.420 --> 25:19.740]  mainstream media to follow our lead and admit that our government is funding Al Qaeda, that
[25:19.740 --> 25:26.720]  NATO is funding Al Qaeda, that elements of the British and French and Israeli government
[25:26.720 --> 25:34.500]  are supporting Al Qaeda, and that this is beyond immoral. And the Saudi Arabian ministers
[25:34.500 --> 25:39.940]  are in public conferences threatening the Russians to basically start a war with them,
[25:39.940 --> 25:45.900]  a covert war. Will the United States and NATO bombard areas of southern Russia and
[25:45.900 --> 25:51.180]  eastern Russia? If Russia goes in to fight the rebels, will they call Chechen Al Qaeda
[25:51.180 --> 25:59.100]  rebels, demonstrators, activists? I mean, that's what they do. They kill police and military
[25:59.100 --> 26:12.180]  every day in Egypt. And our government is backing them publicly and calling them demonstrators.
[26:12.180 --> 26:20.300]  They called them demonstrators killed 25 police two weekends ago. That was the headline. Demonstrators
[26:20.300 --> 26:26.900]  shooting kill so that they can make them the nonviolent good guys. It's like when Carney
[26:26.900 --> 26:33.180]  calls it nonlethal, lethal kinetic actions. There's no such thing as nonlethal lethal
[26:33.180 --> 26:38.260]  when they drop bombs on you. This is the weird games they play. And the thing is no one's
[26:38.260 --> 26:44.180]  buying their propaganda anymore. This is a collapse of the propaganda. Now, that doesn't
[26:44.180 --> 26:51.420]  mean they won't stage something. In fact, there's news out today. Oh, intelligence shows Syria
[26:51.420 --> 26:55.980]  may stage terror attacks in America because of America talking about bombing them. The
[26:55.980 --> 27:01.220]  last thing Syria would do would be to bomb targets in Europe and the United States to
[27:01.220 --> 27:08.060]  then get public approval behind a full invasion. Even if they get physically invaded by US
[27:08.060 --> 27:14.020]  and NATO ground troops, they would be crazy to strike back. Now, Iran probably will if
[27:14.020 --> 27:20.180]  they get attacked. But I've studied the situation and all the other analysts agree. That's what's
[27:20.180 --> 27:28.060]  going on here. And this there's a real probability of nuclear war. Russia and China have said
[27:28.060 --> 27:33.780]  they're going to back Syria and they've moved in heavy weapons, surface to air missiles,
[27:33.780 --> 27:38.860]  surface to ship missiles, anti ship missiles that can go 200, 300, 400 miles, and you're
[27:38.860 --> 27:46.500]  not going to stop them. Look at the Falklands war with with primitive missiles compared
[27:46.500 --> 27:50.300]  to the things that they've got now and how many British ships they sunk with just five
[27:50.300 --> 28:00.220]  missiles they had. So this is a serious situation. And once American ships get hit and there's
[28:00.220 --> 28:05.740]  aircraft carriers on fire, and once there's US aircraft getting shot down and French and
[28:05.740 --> 28:12.740]  British and German, all the good old boys are going to line up and say, invade that
[28:12.740 --> 28:18.380]  place, blow them up. It's immoral, folks. We have been attacking them. The globalists
[28:18.380 --> 28:25.460]  have been using America to attack and to invade in our name, backing up the most unsavory
[28:25.460 --> 28:31.580]  people. I mean, you've got to say the al-Qaeda jihadis are absolute murdering scum who just
[28:31.580 --> 28:36.060]  use religion as an excuse to go around and take things over and they murder their fellow
[28:36.060 --> 28:43.660]  Muslims wherever they're at, including Sunnis. They are a gang of criminals. They are Islam
[28:43.660 --> 28:50.380]  of fascist and they are funded by our government. And I hope people, I mean, I've been on so
[28:50.380 --> 28:55.700]  many big talk shows the last few weeks, big conservative shows, and they always apologize
[28:55.700 --> 28:59.900]  to me. Big regional shows, national shows. They say, well, you used to say our government
[28:59.900 --> 29:06.660]  was running al-Qaeda and running the jihadis. I see it's true. I see it's true. And so let's
[29:06.660 --> 29:12.420]  go back and look at this. I didn't want to get up here and have to talk about all this,
[29:12.420 --> 29:19.740]  but it's true. And they use the threat that they supercharge to take our liberties. I
[29:19.740 --> 29:23.220]  mean, once you look at it logically, it all makes perfect sense. It's globalist offshore
[29:23.220 --> 29:28.340]  banks who make money out of wars and destabilization and can take liberties and sell robots to
[29:28.340 --> 29:32.780]  every police department to disarm bombs. And then they have bomb scares they stage. This
[29:32.780 --> 29:37.020]  is how they take over. When we come back, I got a raft of clips we're going to play
[29:37.020 --> 29:41.500]  breaking all this down and going through the entire stack of news on what's happening
[29:41.500 --> 29:49.780]  in Syria. But I've got to say America is awake. America is awake. 91% are against Obama.
[29:49.780 --> 30:01.060]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.060 --> 30:06.020]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again. I do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring

[31:27.900 --> 31:32.420]  feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total
[31:32.420 --> 31:36.260]  control of your awareness. All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of

[32:57.660 --> 33:08.140]  I'll show you politics in America. Here it is right here. I think the puppet on the right
[33:08.140 --> 33:14.980]  shares my beliefs. I think the puppet on the left is more to my liking. Hey, wait a minute,
[33:14.980 --> 33:19.980]  there's one guy holding up both puppets. Shut up. Go back to bed, America. Your government
[33:19.980 --> 33:28.620]  is in control. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex
[33:28.620 --> 33:44.660]  Jones. You know, I was thinking while I was reading comments on Infowars.com and on YouTube,
[33:44.660 --> 33:50.780]  some videos from the show the last few days, all these top geopolitical experts, people
[33:50.780 --> 33:58.500]  involved in disarmament deals with the Soviets like Dr. Roberts, high-level Reagan administration,
[33:58.500 --> 34:04.540]  people like Dr. Jerome Corsi, who's done international relations as well, about the
[34:04.540 --> 34:10.940]  danger of nuclear war. Now, they've got top British ministers saying the same thing that
[34:10.940 --> 34:17.380]  they're conservative, understanding how serious this is. Russia and China saying they'll go
[34:17.380 --> 34:24.420]  to war with NATO. After our governments and defense contractors have sold them all our
[34:24.420 --> 34:28.220]  latest technology, that's a really good idea. I mean, even if you're evil and want to start
[34:28.220 --> 34:32.500]  World War III, don't do it with somebody that is going to absolutely probably destroy
[34:32.500 --> 34:38.500]  the world. We will be lucky if it doesn't kill all life on land and most stuff in the
[34:38.500 --> 34:43.380]  ocean. Many analysts have broken down with a full-scale, total commitment, 40,000 nuclear
[34:43.380 --> 34:49.260]  weapons going off. And that's just the big ones. And then all the super weapons getting
[34:49.260 --> 34:54.900]  drugged out. I mean, it is not a good idea. And I see these yuppies. I would go over
[34:54.900 --> 34:59.700]  this morning, I woke up at about 3 a.m. I couldn't sleep. I've been so concerned about
[34:59.700 --> 35:04.260]  all this. And I'm somebody who's always been able to sleep like a dead king, you know,
[35:04.260 --> 35:09.460]  just never getting up again, basically. Firecrackers can be going off outside, helicopters, whatever
[35:09.460 --> 35:16.700]  I don't get up. And I woke up at about 3.30 and couldn't go back to bed. So I guess right
[35:16.700 --> 35:21.140]  now it's kind of like the evening for me, but I'll be up till late tonight working.
[35:21.140 --> 35:25.580]  And I was just thinking about how much danger society is. I'm going in and looking at my
[35:25.580 --> 35:30.620]  children asleep in bed and the lab was sitting there on the couch looking at me wondering
[35:30.620 --> 35:36.300]  when I was walking around and waking it up. And then I went at about 5 a.m. and said,
[35:36.300 --> 35:40.420]  I can't go back to sleep and started reading news. And I saw the people on YouTube and
[35:40.420 --> 35:44.620]  I would go to their websites and they were real people that were concerned about Miley
[35:44.620 --> 35:50.220]  Cyrus or concerned about what one of the latest hype was. And I would go to their YouTube
[35:50.220 --> 35:54.620]  channel to see if they were a real person and not a sock puppet. Sometimes they are
[35:54.620 --> 36:03.460]  a government or corporate person. They're distracted and basically so dissension as
[36:03.460 --> 36:07.460]  the Pentagon and CIA admits they're doing domestically now under Obama's orders. That's
[36:07.460 --> 36:15.940]  all public now. And they were real people commenting on petty things, obsessed with
[36:15.940 --> 36:22.020]  being stupid, obsessed with not caring, kind of that attitude, that spirit of nihilistic
[36:22.020 --> 36:29.300]  foolishness, of eat, drink and be morons for tomorrow we die. But a nihilist knows tomorrow
[36:29.300 --> 36:34.660]  we die at least. These are beyond nihilists. They worship at the altar of being ignorant
[36:34.660 --> 36:41.020]  and then attacking and laughing at those that are informed, intelligent and virtuous. And
[36:41.020 --> 36:46.700]  I realize they are jealous inherently of serious people. They are jealous inherently of people
[36:46.700 --> 36:51.140]  that care and want to make the world a better place. That's really what it is. And of course
[36:51.140 --> 36:58.300]  96, 97% of people were upvoting the videos. But I just use it as a sociological study
[36:58.300 --> 37:02.340]  of the people that were making jokes about it, going, you idiots, there's not going
[37:02.340 --> 37:11.220]  to be any nuclear war. Go in your basement and do this and that to yourself. You morons.
[37:11.220 --> 37:15.900]  There's no threat. Well, let me tell you, there's a threat to the people in Syria, the
[37:15.900 --> 37:21.740]  estimated 200 plus thousand, most of them civilians, killed by al-Qaeda. The little
[37:21.740 --> 37:26.220]  kids murdered in front of their parents, the dads made a suicide bomb or their whole family
[37:26.220 --> 37:33.340]  is killed, the church is blown up, the Coptic priest, the Catholic priest being murdered,
[37:33.340 --> 37:41.140]  the burning cities. It's kind of like if your neighbors got a bankruptcy out of work, having
[37:41.140 --> 37:45.660]  their house repossessed, it's a recession. But if it's happening to you, it's a depression.
[37:45.660 --> 37:51.940]  This is a real thing happening over there. And they're making jokes about that. And they
[37:51.940 --> 37:58.220]  make jokes about videos showing dead kids. And they think it's funny. And then they make
[37:58.220 --> 38:02.540]  jokes about all these experts we have on saying this could spur World War III. They think
[38:02.540 --> 38:09.980]  it's funny. We barely have stopped World War III at least three times on record. The most
[38:09.980 --> 38:15.700]  famous, of course, is the Cuban Missile Crisis, where it came within minutes of both sides
[38:15.700 --> 38:26.300]  blasting each other off the map. And there are all sorts of genetic engineering open
[38:26.300 --> 38:30.780]  air projects with crops that are already causing horrible degenerative diseases in the human
[38:30.780 --> 38:35.780]  population. The cancer rates are already up on average, over 3,000 percent. Pediatric
[38:35.780 --> 38:40.020]  on average, over 10,000 percent. Some are up hundreds of thousands of percentage because
[38:40.020 --> 38:43.900]  they didn't exist before. I mean, go look at the numbers. We're already in a crisis.
[38:43.900 --> 38:52.540]  And I realized I had this epiphany at 5 a.m. sitting there reading all this. That it's
[38:52.540 --> 38:57.300]  like mass mental illness. The elite have what these people have. They don't think there's
[38:57.300 --> 39:01.220]  any genetic engineering with all these gene guns creating thousands of new mutations a
[39:01.220 --> 39:12.100]  day all over the world. They don't think any of that is a danger. They don't think that
[39:12.100 --> 39:14.780]  fluoride in the water is bad. Even though there's all the Harvard studies showing it's
[39:14.780 --> 39:19.260]  brain damaging and giving them cancer. They don't care about the IQs physically dropping.
[39:19.260 --> 39:23.940]  It's not just education. We're dumber. We're poisoned. They don't care about forced abortion
[39:23.940 --> 39:27.500]  all over the world under the UN. They don't care about eugenics and forced sterilization
[39:27.500 --> 39:32.660]  going on all over the U.S. on record currently. They don't care if their neighbor gets tasered
[39:32.660 --> 39:36.180]  to death. They don't care if Detroit goes bankrupt. They don't care if some company
[39:36.180 --> 39:40.060]  goes under. They always go, well, why do I care? I don't work there because it affects
[39:40.060 --> 39:45.980]  you moron. We're all interconnected. These people just don't get it. They're totally
[39:45.980 --> 39:52.020]  disconnected from reality. And then we're here trying to stop World War III as best
[39:52.020 --> 39:57.580]  we can. Not because we want to be heroes. We want to have a future. Because they also
[39:57.580 --> 40:01.300]  go, oh, the heroes are going to save us from World War III. You jerks are always saying
[40:01.300 --> 40:06.780]  there's going to be doom and gloom. No, we've got hope. The world loves their grandchildren.
[40:06.780 --> 40:11.580]  Many generals in NATO, in our military speaking out and getting in trouble for it saying this
[40:11.580 --> 40:16.780]  is a horrible idea. It could cause World War III. People that really know how things work
[40:16.780 --> 40:21.860]  are very concerned. And to sit there and watch you people make jokes when they could extinct
[40:21.860 --> 40:33.380]  this planet is absolutely outrageous on so many fronts. It makes my head spin that there
[40:33.380 --> 40:39.620]  are so many serious threats incrementally to the species with the soft kill systems, with
[40:39.620 --> 40:43.260]  the ambient background, tyranny and police state being turned up. But all of that even
[40:43.260 --> 40:48.500]  pales with with with the thermal nuclear threat, the genetic engineering threat, all of this
[40:48.500 --> 40:54.660]  stuff that's already causing incredible problems. But because the media doesn't make a big issue
[40:54.660 --> 40:58.740]  out of it, the sheeple tend to think it's all funny. Or even if the media does cover
[40:58.740 --> 41:04.940]  it, they still just laugh at it until they get diagnosed at 25 with cancer until their
[41:04.940 --> 41:09.900]  18 year old girlfriend gets diagnosed with stomach cancer or brain cancer. I mean, everybody
[41:09.900 --> 41:14.980]  I know has young people in their family dying right now of cancers that were unknown 50
[41:14.980 --> 41:20.220]  years ago. And I know exactly where most of them came from. SV 40, that's in most of the
[41:20.220 --> 41:27.420]  vaccines, a bio weapon virus. They develop back in the 50s and it's the old reliable
[41:27.420 --> 41:32.900]  taken out of cancer patients out of immortal cell lines. Zombies and people aren't real,
[41:32.900 --> 41:39.060]  but individual cells can be literal zombies. You cannot kill them except with fire. And
[41:39.060 --> 41:44.100]  they inject that into all of us, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, I am sitting here, look
[41:44.100 --> 41:49.980]  up immortal cell lines. You think I'm joking? This is the type of stuff that they're doing.
[41:49.980 --> 41:55.700]  Ladies and gentlemen is combining viruses then with apes and then bring and then injecting
[41:55.700 --> 42:01.340]  it back into us. It is it is unspeakable what's already going on. But even the globalists
[42:01.340 --> 42:07.860]  that are a bunch of lovers of death understand the hot fire will consume them. They're not
[42:07.860 --> 42:11.740]  going to get out of what they're going to do. They're not going to escape it. They're
[42:11.740 --> 42:16.100]  not going to get out of this. They say God destroyed the earth with water. The next time
[42:16.100 --> 42:22.180]  we'll be with fire. Will God let our own evil rulers do it to us as the hand of judgment?
[42:22.180 --> 42:28.180]  I don't know, but I know this. I'm going to work to stop it and to warn people about
[42:28.180 --> 42:36.100]  what's happening. But it is sheer madness that the spirit of not caring used to have
[42:36.100 --> 42:41.940]  a reactor was melting down or leaking. They would freak out, fix it. It'd be a big deal.
[42:41.940 --> 42:48.420]  Now 91% of reactors look it up. International Atomic Energy Agency admits 91% of the 400
[42:48.420 --> 42:53.860]  plus reactors are leaking deadly uranium and plutonium and other byproducts all over the
[42:53.860 --> 42:58.660]  world. They just don't care now. They've now all over the US turned the big alarms off
[42:58.660 --> 43:03.140]  because it scares populated areas when they off gas radiation. They used to by federal
[43:03.140 --> 43:10.900]  law have alarmed and get to safe zone. Radiation leak, radiation leak. They've turned them
[43:10.900 --> 43:17.860]  off now. Look that up. Now they've admitted that Fukushima has been leaking the whole
[43:17.860 --> 43:23.060]  time worse than they told the public. That's out in the news today. And people joke. They
[43:23.060 --> 43:28.260]  go, oh, you ought to be thankful for the radiation. Oh, it's no big deal. Oh, it's healthy for
[43:28.260 --> 43:32.580]  you. The Japanese government smile. It'll make it not hurt you. I mean, I'm not joking
[43:32.580 --> 43:38.740]  of your new listener. We played that video last week and that audio for radio listeners.
[43:38.740 --> 43:43.500]  And I realize these are people who are so self centered and so nihilistic that then once
[43:43.500 --> 43:50.820]  you're like that, you don't care about anybody anymore. And you, you don't have a feeling
[43:50.820 --> 43:57.260]  of community and kinship with your ancestors and with your current family and your children.
[43:57.260 --> 44:01.620]  And then with those to come, that feeling of humanity, I'm going to die. I won't always
[44:01.620 --> 44:06.660]  be here, but my great, great grandchildren will. Wow. Imagine what they'll see and do.
[44:06.660 --> 44:12.780]  And I love them. I want them to exist. I have this shared connection to the past, the present,
[44:12.780 --> 44:18.420]  the future. My humanity, my spirit cries out against this. The butchering of the genetic
[44:18.420 --> 44:22.820]  code of the planet, the vandalization of the human genome, all of the horrible things
[44:22.820 --> 44:27.940]  DARPA coming out with an extra chromosome in humans. And they're already mixing humans
[44:27.940 --> 44:31.740]  with animals. So they can say they don't have rights and then harvest their organs. So technically,
[44:31.740 --> 44:36.380]  there's no human clones. They've just had human animal clones for 25 years, you know,
[44:36.380 --> 44:41.620]  and oh, by the way, we didn't tell you, haha. I mean, we're in a Buck Rogers science fiction
[44:41.620 --> 44:47.460]  crazy land. And then I'll get pulled over by some young rookie cop come over. You were
[44:47.460 --> 44:53.780]  going 10 miles over. What's in the car? You do drugs. How you doing Alex? You know, you're
[44:53.780 --> 44:59.180]  kind of a cook. Yeah, I'm kind of a cook. I know all this programming. I know his his
[44:59.180 --> 45:03.940]  whole mindset. I know everything he's going to basically say he'll never really develop.
[45:03.940 --> 45:07.580]  He's on a power trip with petty power that someone with real power would be ashamed to
[45:07.580 --> 45:13.580]  abuse. And meanwhile, I know he's being injected with bio weapons when he gets vaccine. So
[45:13.580 --> 45:18.540]  is this whole family. I care about him, but I can't help him. He's gone. He's on a power
[45:18.540 --> 45:23.820]  trip. It's over for him. You know, it just comes to the point of Rachel Maddow. I don't
[45:23.820 --> 45:29.180]  hate. I don't hate her. I just know she's some narcissistic power tripping person up
[45:29.180 --> 45:33.420]  there. That's part of the whole fake reality they project to keep people from ever realizing
[45:33.420 --> 45:42.820]  what's really going on. But in all of this, in the horrible news that until 1990, they
[45:42.820 --> 45:48.420]  wouldn't let troops use D.U. But they did after and why do I mention that every week?
[45:48.420 --> 45:53.420]  Because every Pentagon report by their scientists said this will kill whoever uses it. It ignites
[45:53.420 --> 45:59.020]  in the barrel. You breathe it. It'll take decades off your life. Anytime you use this,
[45:59.020 --> 46:02.860]  this will kill most people that are around it by their fifties. They're going to have
[46:02.860 --> 46:09.140]  failed kidneys where it precipitates out lung cancer. Do not use this. And they said, okay,
[46:09.140 --> 46:13.580]  let us let us have it deployed on the eastern front in case the Russians ever tend to one
[46:13.580 --> 46:18.460]  superiority pour across. So our troops will have super bullets in their 50 cows and stuff
[46:18.460 --> 46:22.860]  to take out tanks. And the scientists said, don't even do that. It's mission creep. Sure
[46:22.860 --> 46:28.500]  enough, it was deployed by the seventies in Europe never used, couldn't even use it on
[46:28.500 --> 46:32.460]  shooting ranges. Now it's used on shooting ranges everywhere. Now there's just don't
[46:32.460 --> 46:36.700]  worry about it. Don't even wear a mask when you use D.U. boys. Don't even wash your face.
[46:36.700 --> 46:41.620]  I mean, it's a death sentence. That's the same thing. Oh, Alex, genetic engineering is not
[46:41.620 --> 46:48.780]  going to hurt us. Oh, there's not going to be a nuclear war ever. I mean, it's this attitude
[46:48.780 --> 46:54.780]  of maniacs. And then you go to the airport and there's some, you know, minimum, well,
[46:54.780 --> 46:58.140]  the wood, they're not minimum wage, they're like 50, 60 grand a year or whatever. Power
[46:58.140 --> 47:02.500]  tripping person who couldn't get a minimum wage job acting like you're a terrorist. They've
[47:02.500 --> 47:05.620]  had some eight hour course where they can read your mind. They can't even read the back
[47:05.620 --> 47:11.500]  of a cereal box staring at you on an imperious power trip. And it's just a stupid victim.
[47:11.500 --> 47:15.620]  And you want to warn them. So now I do. I go, the government stage 9 11. This is all the
[47:15.620 --> 47:19.460]  fraud. The government ships in on all the narcotics. And they go, please search. No
[47:19.460 --> 47:24.420]  standard for you go on through because then suddenly the power trips over the games over
[47:24.420 --> 47:30.220]  the wake up call is there. I mean, I cannot sit there while cops go around acting like
[47:30.220 --> 47:34.500]  there's terrorist everywhere. And the TSA wants to stick their hands down my wife's pants
[47:34.500 --> 47:40.780]  or my children's for that matter. So I can't fly anywhere with my family while the government
[47:40.780 --> 47:46.420]  runs Al Qaeda. I mean, it makes me want to throw up. They think we're so stupid. They
[47:46.420 --> 47:52.100]  have chemical attacks in front of us and uploaded to known jihadi, YouTube's that have been
[47:52.100 --> 47:59.620]  up for years. All that stuff, firing them at the Syrian troops. And then our government
[47:59.620 --> 48:03.420]  goes, it doesn't matter if that's out. We'll just go with it. We control the press. They
[48:03.420 --> 48:08.660]  won't report it. We'll just ignore in full wars.com. We'll just ignore worldnet daily.com. We'll
[48:08.660 --> 48:14.380]  just ignore drudgereport.com. We'll just ignore anybody that covers this. They don't even
[48:14.380 --> 48:21.620]  care that everybody, but here's the good news. 91% in a major poll. There's a bunch of others
[48:21.620 --> 48:26.820]  coming out. None of the polls have more than 15% support here in the US for this atrocity.
[48:26.820 --> 48:33.860]  You have lost even the sheeple. And so with all this bad news and scary news, everybody
[48:33.860 --> 48:37.780]  deep down understands we're all in danger. Everybody can feel it. If you've got any guts,
[48:37.780 --> 48:42.660]  any spirit, any discernment, if you're not a complete selfish moron, when you're selfish
[48:42.660 --> 48:49.300]  folks, you lose your soul. And by lose your soul, it starts shrinking. It starts dying.
[48:49.300 --> 48:53.780]  Your shadow gets taller than your soul to use the old, old English saying where, where,
[48:53.780 --> 48:59.540]  where you shrink in and become more and more self centered and mindless like Gollum until
[48:59.540 --> 49:04.060]  you don't care about anything, but your own little mental illness. But when you start
[49:04.060 --> 49:10.500]  caring about others, that's when your mind opens up because now you are a human and they
[49:10.500 --> 49:14.900]  don't ever want you to get to that point. That's why they want you dependent, unhappy,
[49:14.900 --> 49:21.540]  plugged into your television set, being brain damaged by the globalist. Now, I haven't even
[49:21.540 --> 49:24.820]  gotten to the huge stack of news yet. I'll do it after the break, but I want to go out
[49:24.820 --> 49:31.300]  to break with last year, the house incident both had these hearings saying to the secretary
[49:31.300 --> 49:34.940]  of defense, Panetta, you have to get approval to attack a Syria. And they said, we're not
[49:34.940 --> 49:38.020]  going to get it from you. Well, now Congress is saying you will get it or we're going to
[49:38.020 --> 49:44.100]  impeach. Let's go ahead and play that clip. You know, again, our goal would be to seek
[49:44.100 --> 49:50.220]  international permission and we would, we would come to the Congress and inform you
[49:50.220 --> 49:56.620]  and determine how best to approach this, whether or not we would want to get permission from
[49:56.620 --> 50:00.860]  the Congress. I think those are issues we would have to discuss as we decide what to
[50:00.860 --> 50:01.860]  do here.
[50:01.860 --> 50:06.740]  Well, I'm almost breathless about that. That's a coup right there. Because what I heard you
[50:06.740 --> 50:12.700]  say is we're going to seek international approval and they will come and tell the Congress
[50:12.700 --> 50:16.860]  what we might do and we might seek congressional approval. They should be arrested right on
[50:16.860 --> 50:17.860]  the spot.
[50:17.860 --> 50:18.860]  They should be arrested right on the spot.
[50:18.860 --> 50:21.580]  That's a big dish. When you agree, you've served in the Congress.
[50:21.580 --> 50:22.580]  And then he doesn't agree.
[50:22.580 --> 50:28.580]  When you agree that that would be pretty breathtaking to the average American, so would you like
[50:28.580 --> 50:29.580]  to clarify that?
[50:29.580 --> 50:35.700]  Yes, I've, you know, we, I've also served with Republican presidents and Democratic
[50:35.700 --> 50:44.500]  presidents who has always reserved the right to defend this country if necessary.
[50:44.500 --> 50:50.780]  But you, before we do this, you would seek permission of the international authorities.
[50:50.780 --> 50:54.180]  If we're working, if we're working with an international coalition, we're working with
[50:54.180 --> 50:55.180]  NATO.
[50:55.180 --> 51:00.900]  But they say they get their orders from NATO, ladies and gentlemen.

[54:07.060 --> 54:12.500]  Syrian Prime Minister Warren's country will become a graveyard for invaders. Does Obama
[54:12.500 --> 54:18.860]  know he's fighting on al-Qaeda's side? Asks one of the top British newspapers, The Independent.
[54:18.860 --> 54:24.620]  It's likely to trigger terrorist attacks against the United States, says Israel. Then it can
[54:24.620 --> 54:29.100]  take more of our rights. See how the false flag works and divert from all of Obama's
[54:29.100 --> 54:39.340]  scandals? Israel calls up reservists after threats, report, calls, intercepts, proof
[54:39.340 --> 54:43.300]  that nerve gas was used. Yeah, well we know nerve gas was used. We know the rebels did
[54:43.300 --> 54:47.620]  it. That's why they say it doesn't matter who did it. They need to invade now because
[54:47.620 --> 54:52.500]  of nerve gas. Jordan says they won't help. They already are. Also al-Qaeda-linked group
[54:52.500 --> 55:01.620]  behind Benghazi trains jihadists for Syria. UN says wait four days. And again, I'm a big
[55:01.620 --> 55:06.620]  critic of the United Nations. It's mainly a puppet organization of the globalist. But
[55:06.620 --> 55:12.380]  it's funny how Obama says he can attack people because of UN approval, even if Congress doesn't.
[55:12.380 --> 55:18.060]  Then when the UN gets vetoed by Russia and China on the Security Council, well now we
[55:18.060 --> 55:21.700]  don't need them either. We don't need Congress, who's really got the authority, and we don't
[55:21.700 --> 55:27.420]  need the UN. And then what is NATO? It's just a treaty organization of the militaries. The
[55:27.420 --> 55:32.220]  militaries are saying they'll do what they want with the executives over them. And who's
[55:32.220 --> 55:39.500]  set up NATO? It's Bilderberg, folks. Bilderberg, we're being told, runs our military. This
[55:39.500 --> 55:46.300]  is the globalist coup, with the generals arrogantly staring down members of Congress and Panetta
[55:46.300 --> 55:52.980]  extremely arrogant saying, you know, we attack who we want without approval. And what he's
[55:52.980 --> 55:57.260]  saying is that like missiles are fired, Congress has already approved to shoot them down and
[55:57.260 --> 56:03.140]  respond. That's what they talk about. You're going back to plan R and things back in the
[56:03.140 --> 56:07.020]  60s, which could have been abused by rogue generals like Curtis LeMay that wanted to
[56:07.020 --> 56:15.540]  nuke Russia without approval in 1962. So this is the type of issue that we're dealing with.
[56:15.540 --> 56:20.500]  And now they're back again saying, we'll attack without congressional approval. And you've
[56:20.500 --> 56:27.100]  got, here's the articles, up on infowars.com. Obama ignores Congress on approval for Syria
[56:27.100 --> 56:34.660]  attack. 56 bipartisan House members demand president follow constitution. Congressmen
[56:34.660 --> 56:40.100]  amash a serious strike unquestionably unconstitutional without congressional approval. Absolutely.
[56:40.100 --> 56:44.340]  I mean, we don't need a congressman to tell us that or at the ACLU to tell us warrantless
[56:44.340 --> 56:48.460]  wiretapping is illegal either. Glenn Beck has come out and said this could cause World
[56:48.460 --> 56:53.740]  War Three. We need to have anti-war rallies to push back against this. And people need
[56:53.740 --> 56:58.060]  to just ignore politicians like John McCain and President Obama dismissing opposition
[56:58.060 --> 57:04.700]  to intervention as coming from extremist. That's a quote. Well, good job, Glenn Beck.
[57:04.700 --> 57:09.980]  That's good. None of us want our kids dead, do we? You're probably rich enough to actually
[57:09.980 --> 57:15.940]  have a good enough bunker to go live in, but I don't. Okay, as Jawahiri to Syrian rebels,
[57:15.940 --> 57:22.580]  Damascus first in Cairo, then Jerusalem hails the al-Qaeda invasion that our government,
[57:22.580 --> 57:25.860]  John Baum, at the point during the break, he goes, this will be like US World War Two
[57:25.860 --> 57:30.700]  soldiers fighting on the side of the Nazis against a country. That's what our military
[57:30.700 --> 57:33.860]  is doing covertly with this. It is unspeakable.
[57:33.860 --> 57:39.900]  Continuing, here's one independent I mentioned. Does Obama know he's fighting on al-Qaeda's
[57:39.900 --> 57:46.660]  side? All for one and one for all should be the battle cry of the West goes to war against
[57:46.660 --> 57:55.380]  Assad's Syrian regime. Al-Qaeda vows volcano of revenge over Syrian suspected gas attack
[57:55.380 --> 57:59.740]  Indian news. Oh yeah, al-Qaeda launched that attack. Attack on Syria likely to trigger
[57:59.740 --> 58:05.260]  terrorist attacks in the US, Israel, Washington Times, Israeli intelligence intercepted Syrian
[58:05.260 --> 58:09.540]  regime talk about chemical attack. Yeah. And when you read the intercepts that they've
[58:09.540 --> 58:13.660]  put out the audio for it's like, did you do this? What's going on? We didn't order this,
[58:13.660 --> 58:17.500]  which is the proof they weren't behind it. I mean, they got battle chatter from the top
[58:17.500 --> 58:21.620]  general saying that the proves they didn't. Then we'll get into the economic effects
[58:21.620 --> 58:27.620]  of all this. The Syrian conflict could spill over into Iraq and Brent oil could surge $150
[58:27.620 --> 58:32.420]  a barrel. That's just some of what's coming up in the second hour and we'll look at the
[58:32.420 --> 58:37.020]  latest power grab while we're all diverted with this by the greenie weenies with their
[58:37.020 --> 58:51.380]  global taxi waxes. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[59:53.420 --> 01:00:05.180]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:13.900]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:39.140]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:44.900]  All right, folks. We got Mark Moreno popping in for about 20 minutes on the latest, the
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:49.500]  head of climate depot on CNN saying polar bears are all dying when the opposite is true
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:54.660]  and Al Gore running around saying there's a sixth level of to hurricanes and that's
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:01:02.860]  not true. I mean, it is just, these people are congenital liars. Pathological. And I
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:06.180]  guess it works for the gullible public that does whatever they're told, but the good news
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:10.980]  is, if you just joined us, all these polls are out between 9 and 15% of the American
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:20.660]  people support Obama launching wars. And I was looking at polls. It's hard core Democrats.
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:24.900]  It's upwards of 30%. So that's the only reason you get 9 to 15, depending on the poll as
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.900]  an average.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:30.260]  So they would do anything. In fact, we sent out our reporters yesterday. We're going to
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:36.940]  grab this on the nightly news tonight. Yesterday and had him say, we need to brown, ban brown
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:42.500]  bags in Austin, Texas, because Seattle did the word brown bag is racist and the people
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:48.180]  signed it because brown bag is racist. They said, also, we want to ban the family because
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:54.260]  it might hurt people that don't have families. And they said, absolutely, ban the family
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:02:00.220]  immediately. These are authoritarians. These are not even people. I mean, they are literally
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:06.740]  gibbering idiots who just worship government. I mean, it is their mommy. It is their daddy
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:18.740]  like that peon jackass. Excuse me. I mean, just moron Chris Rock. And that's the reason
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:23.500]  he's funny is because he comes off and like a mean way, like it's mean to make fun of
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:27.500]  a mentally retarded child. I think it's very sad. A lot of them are very sweet. But with
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.220]  Chris Rock, I mean, you know, people are like, what is it about him that's so funny? It's
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:38.640]  that he's obviously folks has about a 75 IQ. He's he's a sad person. I'm not happy his
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:47.020]  eyes don't point the right directions. But I mean, that's that's who these people are.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:51.140]  And that's that's who's taking over. And then the globalist go, well, you're for eugenics
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:56.940]  then. No, you've purposefully done people down. So you have a bunch of idiots to take
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:01.540]  over the system and then get rid of everybody. I don't want to wipe them out just because
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:10.140]  you know, the poor guy is a jibbering idiot. I mean, it's just a bunch of just morons run
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:14.340]  by criminals. But but here's the difference. I guess that kind of countervenes my theory
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:19.940]  that 30 40 percent are total idiots because 9% support this phony war. I know I keep harping
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:25.460]  on that. It's just such a big deal. This is short little no man's land segment or we're
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.500]  soon going to get rid of this and actually have to come in at like six after instead
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:33.900]  of so they'd after that's a weird clock I demanded 16 years ago when I started because
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:39.820]  I didn't want to carry the news that the network was carrying. It was just propaganda. Nothing
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:47.020]  against Genesis. That was just the news that was available. And there's not a lot of good
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.620]  news feeds out there. I'd like to come up with a radio feed sometime where I actually
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:53.660]  did news every every half hour with the whole team. That's actually part of our plan down
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:57.220]  the road. But the point is, I don't have the money, the time, the energy to get that going,
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:03.500]  but we'll try someday. We had enough funds. We could do it and have organizational skills.
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:11.100]  But I don't know how I digressed off into that. The point is, is that we're going to
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:21.780]  come back and talk about financially what this is doing to the world. Just the idea
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:28.780]  of a war, a hot war. They're all hot, but a full on open war bombardment, direct action,
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:35.700]  not just CIA commandos, giving them the satellite intel and lazing targets of schools to nerve
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:43.500]  gas like they did for Saddam and like they did last week under John Kerry's orders clearly.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:48.060]  So that psychopath could get up there in grandstand and everybody can go, dead children, do what
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:53.860]  I say, kill more. You're, you're for a sod if you don't kill children, if you don't kill
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:05:01.380]  more, well, they're right back.

[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:27.940]  from Austin Texas. Alex Jones. Alright coming up later in the hour we're scheduled to have
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:32.820]  Mark Moreno on to break down all the new frauds with CNN shows that polar bears are all dying
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:35.980]  when it's the opposite. Their numbers are five full but they were 50 years ago. That's
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:41.140]  on record. I have a stack of news articles on that on that front to go over. They're
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:45.660]  also saying that there's now a six category of hurricane. That's how bad they are. It's
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:51.700]  actually hurricanes are at a decade low this year and sewer tornadoes are a 60 year low.
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:59.260]  That's USA Today by the way and NOAA, the National Oceanic Group, an atmospheric administration.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:06.740]  But none of that matters. They say that Al Gore says that polar bears can't swim and
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:10.180]  that the temperature has gone up and that if you pay him money he'll save the earth basically
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:16.340]  with carbon taxes. Just unbelievable lies. So that's coming up. But I want to open the
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:23.620]  phones up. We did this the last few days and had like retired former ICBM launch center
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:29.060]  people calling in and I know the info on that. These are real people. We had military officers
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:33.700]  calling in with incredible data about what they think about what's happening over in
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:37.180]  Syria right now. Quite frankly I've studied it in depth. That's why I knew what they were
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:40.860]  saying was so accurate but it was just amazing to hear them calling into the broadcast that
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:45.420]  caliber of people. I'd like to hear from folks like that again today on your take of how
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:50.060]  much danger we're under from a nuclear war starting of this kicks off. But they've got
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:56.220]  British defense ministers saying this is a major danger of nuclear war and that it could
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:59.260]  set off at least a regional war all over the Middle East and we shouldn't do whatever
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:04.820]  Saudi Arabia says. Saudi Arabia has come out and threatened Putin publicly to launch al-Qaida
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:09.340]  attacks all over their border if they don't pull out of Syria. It's unbelievable. This
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:15.540]  is how world wars start all these sides lining up. Just incredible information on that front.
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:22.700]  Mainstream British and US papers are now saying Obama do you know that the rebels are mainly
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:26.060]  al-Qaida and that you're helping al-Qaida? Yes of course they know. They help create
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:33.140]  them with Zbigniew Brzezinski who runs the White House foreign policy. He created them.
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:39.300]  He pulled them out of the Muslim Brotherhood and jihadi groups of Wahhabist. The same groups
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:43.260]  the British used in 1918 when Lawrence of Arabia had to attack and invade Syria again
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:51.380]  and burn it down. Damascus and other areas. And also used by Hitler and then turned back
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:11:00.780]  over to the CIA in 1947. I mean this is the reality ladies and gentlemen of what's going
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:06.620]  on. They've always run these jihadis. It's been declassified. Look it up that in 1979
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:14.740]  the CIA helped kick the shaw out and put the Ayatollahumaniac. Didn't mean they ran him
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:19.900]  and controlled him. It meant they helped put those jihadis in just like they double crossed
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:24.860]  them in 1953 and told them they could take over if they burned stuff up and blew things
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:30.500]  up and then blamed it on Ahmad Mozaedek the secular leader who was pro-west. They didn't
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:36.460]  want to pro-west secular poet guy to build the country up. They wanted to make it backwards
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:40.620]  so they set them up, took him out, then put the shaw in. The shaw wanted to build up the
[01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:46.620]  country, double crossed him, removed him, put the Shiites in. Well the Shiites are nothing.
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:54.700]  They're only 20% of the Muslim population. It's the 79% that are the Sunnis and the subgroup
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:12:04.980]  the Wahhabis that are kind of like the enforcers of the whole thing. They're almost like the
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:09.220]  Jesuits of the Catholic Church or something like the special coterie that enforces things
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:16.660]  or whatever. This is the type of stuff that we see happening and unfolding here and they
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:23.100]  just run all over the Middle East on a jihad slaughtering Christians, Muslims, Jews, anybody
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:28.500]  they can and our government is funding them. So I want to open the phones up for military,
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:34.220]  for police, intelligence type folks, but also general citizens on the subject of Syria and
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.780]  the fact that all of our expert guests from Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:44.340]  Treasury, who did international relations for Reagan with the Russians and peace deals
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:50.500]  and to people like Dr. Jerome Corsi who worked in all sorts of government operations as a
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:56.300]  contractor, international operations in the Middle East, absolutely key person to talk
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:13:01.740]  about it and he says our government funded Al Qaeda rebels, launched a chemical attacks.
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:05.940]  Here's their bragging on their sites, here's their own videos. I mean it's not like a new
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:10.980]  site with a saw dressing up like them, his people are doing it. It's the real people
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:17.580]  doing it just like the last three times they got caught doing it because they don't care.
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:21.020]  They want to be rock stars to their people over there so they're proud they're doing
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:24.740]  it and they've been told don't worry the dumb Americans, the dumb Europeans, they'll never
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:29.420]  pay attention. Here's nothing the media does, they make it all about Assad. Well Assad deserves
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:33.940]  he was dead, he was a dictator and so what if he was democratizing? He's really bad,
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:40.140]  we need to take him out, he hurt people. What about all of the Syrian people? Our government
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:46.380]  and NATO started this fight. What about all of them? What about all the war crimes being
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:49.740]  committed against them? What about those children? What about the Christian? You know there's
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:55.740]  USA Today, Syrian rebels pledged loyalty to Al Qaeda. That was back in June. I mean what
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:14:00.100]  do you mean pledged loyalty? They've got tanks driving around, we've got video with flapping
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:04.620]  Al Qaeda flags and every video we see they're going, oh some of the Laden's singing his
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:11.860]  name as they fire US and French tow missiles at Assad's tanks.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:23.580]  I mean you can go watch this stuff. We've played it here and it goes on and on and I'm sitting
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:28.260]  here knowing hey our government's running Al Qaeda, shut up conspiracy theorist but that's
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:32.260]  not happening now. I go on all these big conservative shows they go you're right this is incredible
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:35.700]  blah blah blah. Now Sean Hannity comes out and says it's not a good idea to cause World
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:39.580]  War III. Now Glenn Beck comes out and says it's not a good idea to cause World War III.
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:45.580]  Now Jack, now Dempsey comes out, Jack Dempsey the fighter, now General Dempsey comes out
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:49.140]  and says it's not a good idea to cause World War III. Now the British ministers are coming
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:54.540]  out saying it could cause World War III. On and on and on you've got McCain going now
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:59.540]  is the time to hit, now is the time to bombard, I don't want just cruise missiles, I want
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:05.940]  cluster bombs and Obama you caused the chemical attack by telling Assad he could do it giving
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:13.420]  him fake right cover. I mean McCain is such a globalist, anti-gun, open border, new order.
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:19.740]  Why isn't he the head of the Democratic Party? Why isn't he the head of the DNC? And it goes
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:25.420]  on and on and on. They got the former head of the Republican RNC steel up on TV saying
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:31.260]  I'm paid to be deeply racist when everyone knows I'm the opposite of a racist. I'm a
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:35.060]  real liberal like Thomas Jefferson folks. I mean I really even liberal freedom. I believe
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:39.380]  in that I've got my right, you've got your right and man we got low taxes and we got
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:43.780]  due process and we got juries and we got families and you can do what you want, I'm tolerant
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:49.060]  of you but you don't come tell me what to do. See all this tolerance stuff isn't that.
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:54.300]  All these socialists and weirdos are on their own little private crusader jihad to try to
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:16:00.500]  convert me to all the things they do versus tolerance and acceptance then adoption. Hey
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:09.540]  man, I don't like Karzoo Marzoo. If some of the Italians like to eat maggots and cheese
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:14.180]  that's their issue. I'm not bigoted, I don't want to eat maggots and cheese. Pull up Karzoo
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:18.380]  Marzoo folks, don't believe it. I'm not bigoted against maggots and cheese. If you want to
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:21.660]  eat maggots and cheese knock yourself out. There's also got an ancient dish going into
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:26.380]  catechums, people's bones, thigh bones, thigh bones soup, I forget the name of that. But
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:35.060]  I'm not anti-Italian because some Italians in Corsica or whatever eat that. Karzoo Marzoo
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:38.780]  guys, maggots and cheese, it'll come right up. Okay fantastic, just type it in, it's
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:43.620]  the first image, maggots and cheese. He said, I don't like maggots and cheese. Oh, you're
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.620]  discriminating against those of us who don't want to eat maggots and cheese. No, I don't
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:52.300]  like maggots and cheese. You like maggots and cheese and the globalists like warmongering
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:58.060]  and war profiteering and bottomless pits. There it is Karzoo Marzoo, maggot cheese,
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:06.020]  utterly delicious. As I told you, it's a Sardinian dish. Obviously I'm anti-Italian. That's like
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:09.580]  when I'm criticizing the Communist Chinese trying to run our media and all these movies
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:13.620]  they're having stopped from being released and buying up the big movie houses and the
[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:19.540]  theater chains. Alex Jones doesn't like Chinese people. No, I love Chinese people. I don't
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:24.060]  like the commie Chinese government trying to run my life. Just like I don't like the
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:29.820]  Pentagon involved in domestic propaganda. Understand that? So here's the toll-free number. I want
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:39.100]  to hear from you 800-259-9231-800-259-9231. If you've been calling in, we don't answer
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:45.020]  the phones. I'll get the number out. The phones are now open. 800-259-9231. I want to hear
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:51.220]  from everybody. Unless you're at home, drinking corn syrup, laced cough syrup and smoking
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:57.180]  dope. I'm not discriminating against pot smokers. I believe it should be decriminalized. But
[01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.700]  I don't mean I don't actually dislike a lot of pot smokers, I know, because they're brain
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:04.500]  damaged people. You're like, hey, man, you're against weed, dude. It's going to save the
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:11.700]  whole earth. It boosts your IQ. No, it doesn't. See, I agree with your right to smoke it.
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:17.660]  You just don't. I'm just not cool. I'm not going to smoke it with you. Unless I'm going
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:20.180]  through chemo therapy or something, I'm going to need to hold down food. It does work great
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:25.620]  for that. See, that's the difference between discriminating taste does not mean you're discriminating
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:36.460]  against a person. You know, some people might like a certain type of car. But again, we
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:41.560]  have Austinites yesterday, we're going to air this tonight, saying ban brown, the term brown
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:46.460]  bag as Seattle has done because it's racist and ban the family because it's bad. See,
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:53.300]  anything that doesn't agree with them has to be banned. They're the intolerant on fire.
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:57.940]  Authoritarians being manipulated by the social engineers. Meanwhile, we have real issues to
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:03.020]  deal with like the possibility of nuclear war. But look at this article right here. Sock
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:12.340]  Jen says the Syrian conflict could spill over into Iraq and Brent oil, concerns to $150

[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:36.500]  and Canadian other stock markets went way down on war drums. Crude oil soared 52 week
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:40.540]  high on war jitters and gold is safe. They have an asset. Times of uncertainty and its
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:44.980]  trust in government has skyrocketed. This is not surprising. Top financial analysts
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:49.820]  have long forecast war, but they say that war is bad for the economy. Not not so if you're
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:56.540]  an insider globalist. Syrian electronic army takes down New York Times website claims Twitter

[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:23.580]  your help by getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at InfoWars.com. You will wake
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:30.340]  up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level. We need your
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:35.980]  help to spread the word like never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:43.220]  battle between the forces of freedom and darkness. You are the response to the globalist technocrats
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:50.900]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here.
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:24:01.180]  It's an InfoWars. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:19.060]  All right, my friends, we're back live. We're about to go to Mark Moreno here in a second.
[01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:26.300]  Some of the top headlines up on InfoWars.com right now. Wall Street Journal says Wack Assad
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:33.140]  and his family. Yeah, and they're also saying a kill Snowden. Yeah, it's such nice people.
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:40.940]  World War III Syrian Iranian officials say Israel will set on set off fire if U.S. strikes
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:46.140]  bombshell evidence. Syrian rebels carried out gas attack even World that Daily's reporting
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:52.340]  that with the videos of the jihadi celebrating running around launching it last week. Also,
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:58.620]  the media is conquering weapons of mass destruction to push the attack. And intelligence suggests
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:02.220]  Assad not behind the chemical weapons attack. The stuff the Israelis are bringing out is
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:07.260]  a general screaming at his chemical core saying you better not be behind this. What's going
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:14.780]  on? How does that prove they did it? Unbelievable information. And we'll get Mark Moreno's brief
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:18.300]  take on that when he leaves us. He'll be here with us about 45 after then I'll go to all
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:21.780]  the callers that are holding to talk about the situation. But the reason I wanted to
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:27.860]  get Mark Moreno on former communications director for the Senate Environment Public Works Committee
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:34.220]  and senatorial aid to Senator Inhofe. We probably have carbon taxes now, but it wasn't for him.
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:39.660]  And he has a degree in political science at George Mason University. He's also held both
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:43.100]  White House and Capitol Press credentials. And the really cool thing is he produced
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:47.700]  Rush Limbaugh's TV show for its four year hit run before the censors got it shut down.
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:51.900]  And he's also a journalist. This is a short segment, long segment coming up, Mark. I had
[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:57.500]  to get you on because of these headlines. Al Gore says it's racist now in the Huffington
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:03.420]  Post to not pay him carbon taxes. And I have a CNN piece we're going to play coming up
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:07.220]  the next segment through. You saw it where they again said the whole ice cap in the north
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:10.260]  is melted. They don't tell you in the summer it always shrinks and that the polar bears
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:16.300]  are all dying. I mean, these people are amazing. They're level of lying, but I don't see people
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:22.180]  buying into it anymore, Mark. No. In fact, big UN report coming out, they're
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:29.280]  going to re-hype all the same nonsense again. You mentioned Al Gore. What Al Gore is doing
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:35.380]  is he's telling Americans that you either believe in my version of global warming science
[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:43.140]  or you are, in his words, a homophobe, a racist, your pro apartheid, your anti abolitionists,
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:49.420]  meaning you are pro slavery. He said that you are someone who's akin to an alcoholic
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:56.180]  father who's abusing his family. So just on the level of persuasion, he's telling Americans
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:27:02.500]  who more Americans, according to Gallup Poll and believe in haunted houses, 37% than man-made
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:07.740]  global warming, 36%. This was done even. That was a poll from pre-climate aid and nothing's
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:13.740]  changed. He's telling Americans that unless you believe like he does, you're all of those
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:17.980]  allegedly horrible and nasty things.
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:22.660]  It's unbelievable. I had MSNBC two weeks ago without showing a clip say I'm, quote, deeply
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:28.460]  racist and that I, quote, in the profit of the libertarians who staged the Boston bombing.
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:32.620]  And I talked to my lawyer. He said, we can probably win, but do I want to mess with it
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:37.500]  for two years? But my question is, and they showed no proof of this. Why are they getting
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:42.740]  so crazy? I mean, I can probably win a lawsuit, but I probably won't do it just because no
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:45.300]  one believes them. There's such discredited kooks.
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:49.580]  Yes. Well, the reason Al Gore and now the new UN reports, you're going to hear all about
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:52.740]  this in September. It's going to be coming out by the end of September. They're going
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:56.220]  to be hyping everything. They're going to claim global warming is worse than we thought.
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:01.340]  And how do they claim this? By making the predictions of 50 to 100 years much more scary
[01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:06.460]  than they ever were. And that's what Al Gore is counting on. But here's why they're desperate.
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:10.900]  Global average temperatures, depending on the data set, 15 to 20 years with no global warming.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:16.060]  I mean, that means kids going off to college this year, Alex, have never experienced global
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:17.060]  warming in their life.
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:22.660]  When I was a kid in Dallas, it was over 110 every summer. It's, it's hit 110 once in the
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:23.660]  last decade.
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:28.020]  Yeah. Very cool summer here in the United States. Here's the thing. They've never experienced
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:34.060]  it in their life. And here's even more aside, since 2002 now, nine year olds have only experienced
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:39.860]  global cooling. The earth has been cooling since 2002. No warming at all in 15 to 20
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:43.220]  years. Again, depending on the data set and whether you go statistically significant or
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:44.220]  just no warming.
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:47.500]  Yeah, sure. Be honest. It's actually, temperatures actually dropped, but we're just saying it's
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:48.500]  flat.
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:51.540]  Yeah, we asked, well, they're dropping in the last few years. If you go even a shorter
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:56.540]  time since 2002, we've been cooling it very slightly. And now we have Russian scientists
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:29:00.540]  from the National Academy, the Russian Academy of Sciences. We have geologists in America
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:06.900]  like Don Easterbrook. We have ocean specialists, hurricane specialists like Dr. Bill Gray.
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:09.180]  Warning of global cooling coming now based on
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:12.260]  Oh, yeah. NASA came out, as you know, and said, Oh, we're going to freeze it as you
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:13.260]  don't pay all our money.
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:18.860]  Yeah. Yeah. And this is a redux now of the 1970s when they worried about the global
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:20.340]  cooling. So we've come full circle.
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:23.340]  By the way, you predicted two years ago here, I want to come back and talk about it, but
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:27.780]  I remember it. I'm sure we can pull up the articles at climate depot.com folks search
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:31.900]  climate depot.com and then put in next will be global cooling. A couple years ago, you
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:37.380]  predicted they would do this. So I want to come back and ask how you knew they do that.
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:43.860]  I mean, these people are amazing. Mark Moreno is our guest. Hey, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds,
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:50.060]  Al Gore, Obama carbon taxes, or you'll freeze the death. We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:56.540]  We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:05.580]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?

[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:17.780]  autism and every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat.
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:23.460]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled

[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:23.860]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:27.140]  All right, Mark Moreno is with us about another 10 minutes or so then I'm going right to your
[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:31.620]  phone calls and the latest on the economy, the latest on the scandals that this whole
[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:36.100]  Syria thing is beautifully distracting from. But Mark Moreno is in the United States at
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:42.820]  least the most prominent compiler of the real data of the criminal takeover, the mafia takeover
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:47.260]  of the economy by the collectivist and some of the big robber barons that make their money
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:52.980]  out of government control and crony capitalism. What they're doing with their fake green movement
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:57.780]  that ignores all the real environmental issues that we all agree on when we see the facts
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:04.540]  and then brings in a phony set that empowers them. Mark, I want to play a clip from just
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:08.860]  a few minutes long from CNN here in a few minutes of their latest lies that I saw last
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:20.980]  Friday. But first, I wanted to talk to you here today about their whole operation, what
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:26.460]  they're doing. I saw a month ago a headline where Obama raised the price of carbon in
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:32.020]  a microwave regulation. So some of the things, the roaches, the roaches are up to and how
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:36.500]  we stop them and some of the trends we've got to watch out for. I have seen the warming
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:40.180]  up you mentioned on all the channels that, look, we're all going to freeze the death.
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:42.740]  We're dead if we don't let these people run our lives.
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:47.020]  Yeah. Well, here's what's frightening about what's happening in Washington right now.
[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:52.620]  And in a way, it's you've got to give the Obama administration evil credit, if you will.
[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:57.980]  They are now instead of going with climate control regulations and regulations on carbon
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:03.740]  dioxide. Remember, humans inhale oxygen, we exhale CO2 carbon dioxide. So the Obama administration
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:10.220]  through the EPA is poised to regulate what we exhale through our mouth CO2 as a pollutant
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:14.820]  under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court gave them the authority to do this. So instead
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:21.460]  of going for a big Brassie UN treaty that requires Senate ratification, that requires
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:25.900]  big international meetings, instead of going for a big cap and trade bill, which has failed
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:30.220]  in the house. Well, the last one passed in the house, but failed in the Senate and other
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:34.420]  bills have failed. And despite trying to go for a carbon tax, which would be a rough road,
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:39.380]  which would awaken, if you will, the American people and shut down Washington if they tried
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:40.820]  to pass it.
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:45.740]  What the Obama administration doing is as the science crumbles underneath them, they are
[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:51.620]  going to be going behind the scenes in the nameless, faceless bureaucracy of the Environmental
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:56.540]  Protection Agency, and they're going to start to achieve everything they tried and failed
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:02.220]  to achieve through UN treaties and through carbon taxes and carbon, carbon dioxide regulations.
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:04.500]  They're now going to do it behind the scenes.
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:08.540]  So Congress needs to pass law defunding them or stripping them, correct?
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:15.140]  Yes. And their GOP has talked about one third budget cut next year for the EPA if they start
[01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:21.580]  regulating carbon dioxide. The problem is, our liberty, our freedom is going to depend
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:26.580]  on the Republican leaders in Congress. And that is a very scary thought. When you think
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:31.380]  of them standing up on an environmental issue, on global warming, I don't see them having
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:37.580]  the guts to do it. I don't see them having the fortitude to stand up to Obama and prevent
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:38.580]  this.
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:43.100]  There's also lawsuits. As many scientists industry is suing as poised to sue and has already
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:50.180]  filed some lawsuits. And other three foundations are fighting this, which could delay some
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:54.820]  of these regulations. But the bottom line is the only surefire way to stop this would
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:37:00.340]  be to defund the EPA. And I worked in Washington. I worked for Republicans in Washington. And
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:05.380]  I can tell you right now, they don't have the balls to do it, to speak a little bit,
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:08.180]  a little bit colloquialism there.
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:13.060]  This is terrible news. I live in Austin, Texas, under agenda 21. I mean, we get you in awards
[01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:19.820]  our sister cities over in Japan. We are the world model of two cities for agenda 21. We
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:25.700]  had four city on power plants. They shut down three the last decade. And now they're shutting
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:30.300]  the last one down that's outside Austin. The power prices they admit in the paper have
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:35.340]  doubled in the last five. And the mayor goes, well, you shouldn't have cheap power. But
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:40.140]  then the government and the elite areas, you can't make this up. They get a lower rate
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:45.140]  and are guaranteed no power outages. So it's like I live in Romania under Chalcescu. They're
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:49.140]  now going to be announcing I'm not going to have power. So I moved outside Austin, but
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:52.580]  there's already such a power problem. We're having record blackouts. So now we get our
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:58.420]  power from Mexico, but these very same green groups have actually invested. They have dirty
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:03.620]  power plants now supplying Texas with the power. I mean, these people are saboteurs.
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:09.940]  Yeah. And in fact, a mayor Bloomberg in New York City is bragged that his his his partnering
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:14.100]  with environmental groups has prevented hundreds of coal plants from going online. Meanwhile
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:20.100]  in China, the latest estimate is every 10 days new coal plants go online. We are the we are
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:25.180]  the Saudi Arabia of coal in the United States. We have that much coal. The Obama administration
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:30.300]  is systematically shutting down the largest percentage of our energy. And here's the thing
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:34.020]  in places where they've already passed these insane regulations and they're living it
[01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:38.100]  like California, we had Arnold Schwarzenegger come out and you may have covered this a few
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:39.100]  weeks ago.
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:44.180]  He warned the global warming skeptics or deniers as he called them. They should quote strap
[01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:48.940]  some conservative thinking people do a tailpipe for an hour and they will agree that CO2 was
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:55.180]  a pollutant unquote. This is what we're met with Arnold Schwarzenegger is now is it making
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:39:00.260]  us mad with raucous applause and laughter at the environmental conference he was at when
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:03.860]  he made these remarks. This is what we're faced with the U.S.
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:09.700]  His dad was an SS captain and actually helped strap people to tailpipes. So I guess he would
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:13.940]  know I'm not joking. He was best buddies with Kurt Volta on the top SS commander. I guess
[01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:19.860]  Arnold could see and he was skull skull hats. I guess he could teach us. I remember what
[01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:24.900]  he said. What was it five years ago at Copenhagen? He said we will go to the cities and the states
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:30.020]  and the regulations and do it regardless of what Congress does because I will dictate
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:33.300]  when you will pay me carbon tax. How about he goes back to Austria.
[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:38.620]  Yeah. He's just one example. The head of the U.N. the U.N. panel which is coming out has
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:44.260]  said that he'd like to see skeptics or deniers rub asbestos on their bodies and faces. I
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:49.220]  mean they've made these are veiled disgusting threats against global warming skeptics.
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:53.060]  This is the nature of the debate as they're coming out. Meanwhile more U.N. scientists
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:57.500]  people like a Swedish scientist have come out and defected and essentially said you
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:01.260]  wouldn't even notice the global warming over the last hundred years if we didn't have modern
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:04.660]  instrumentation. It's an artifact of all these sophisticated.
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:07.740]  Totally. And I mean give me a sword snagger for those that don't know I even made a film
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:13.900]  that part of it's about him the film martial law. He was his dad wasn't just a German soldier.
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:20.220]  He was an SS town leader and rounded people up. So according to that George Soros ought
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:23.740]  to hire him because that's what George Soros did. He helped round people up. So I guess
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:28.060]  everybody's good that actually work for the Nazis. But we're racist according to Al Gore
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:33.620]  because we don't like Nazis on Mark Moreno. Yeah. And again he gets away with this. This
[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:39.340]  was met with laughter. So keep in mind this is again in line the German climate adviser
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:44.340]  a man named Hans Schudtenhuber has come out and called for a CO2 budget for every man
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:49.420]  woman and child. So the British and this is curious. You mentioned the power outages in
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:54.740]  the U.K. their power plant their power plant chief has said that families can't get used
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:58.980]  to power on tap. In other words they had to get the power when it's available. They're
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:03.620]  warning of the coming black house. This is going to be government governments and government
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:09.340]  regulating how much energy they want to make us poor. You increase the price of energy and
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:14.380]  collectivize everything. And that's exactly right that you know he controls carbon dioxide
[01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:19.660]  controls life. And that is one of the most frightening things is to hand this over. But
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:24.620]  once again Obama is poised to be successful. They're going to have the greatest success
[01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:29.020]  they've ever had the global warming activists because it's going to happen behind the scenes
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:32.980]  in Washington in the bureaucracy. There's not going to be a big bill. Congress isn't
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:36.580]  going to get flooded with phone calls. Talk radio is not going to light up the dials of
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:40.300]  people talking about this because it's going to be done quietly and behind the scenes. And
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:44.900]  they got to give them a sort of sick credit because this is what they should have done
[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:50.900]  in the first place. This is how real freedom is destroyed in Washington is behind the scenes.
[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:55.740]  It can also happen in big bills in Congress things you know like the Patriot Act and other
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:42:01.700]  things. But the real damage is done behind the scenes like this. And the horrible ruling
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:06.620]  in 2007 when the Supreme Court said that CO2 could be regulated as a pollutant. It doesn't
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:11.220]  mean the EPA has to do it. But if the EPA finds that it does it by the way guess what
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:17.340]  the EPA uses to find that CO2 is a pollutant. They use the science of the United Nations
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:23.220]  which is a activist political organization masquerading as a science body. So the U.S.
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:30.540]  our freedom is going to be eroded. Our energy is going to be gutted on science by the U.N.
[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:38.260]  which stated goal is to study only how humans influence climate. This is a very sad day
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:42.700]  in history and the only thing to block it is the Republicans who have to defund the
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:47.780]  EPA and no one in their right mind. Absolutely. Well you know they've shut down what in the
[01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:51.420]  first few years it was over 200 power plants. Now they've shut down hundreds more. Now they're
[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:56.820]  talking about thousands. Everybody needs to know going back to the Nazi analogy when my
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:03.420]  grandfather was flying out of North Africa into Italy in a B-17 bomber they were bombing
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:07.020]  their power plants. That's what you do to bring down a country as you blow up their
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:11.540]  power plants. Well the trendies they just go and turn them off. I mean that's how they're
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:17.340]  literally shutting America down. When you see Godzilla hypothetically you know attacking
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:24.300]  Tokyo. I mean that's what I see Obama and Al Gorez is like level five Kai Jews attacking
[01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:30.700]  America why do they want to do that. Well at Don Holtron in 19 I believe 1975 Obama's
[01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:35.460]  science advisor said one of the great hazards of a free society is abundant sheep energy.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:40.300]  Why because it goes against their mantra of overpopulation. They don't want people they
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:45.660]  essentially want to have international being being counters and regulators controlling
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:51.700]  every aspect of our life. In fact Nancy Pelosi went to China in 2009 and said exactly what
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:56.420]  I just said that in order to fight global warming we need a complete inventory on every
[01:43:56.420 --> 01:44:00.940]  aspect of our lives. The UN I was down in Rio last I guess it was a little over a year
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:06.860]  ago June 2012 they had a meeting on sustainable development. The United Nations wants to get
[01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:14.380]  their hands on regulating waterways land use agriculture roadways the oceans in addition
[01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:19.660]  to our atmosphere our industry our climate all in the name of saving the earth and this
[01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:23.620]  is where the great this is why the Czech president Vaklav Klaus which I'm sure you're
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:28.540]  very familiar with has said the great since the fall of the Soviet Union in the eastern
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:33.940]  block the greatest threat to freedom in the world is what he termed ambitious environmentalism.
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:37.540]  Absolutely I want to play a clip for you since we mentioned it because this happened six
[01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:42.900]  years ago during the campaign people deny it. This is Obama in a press conference saying
[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:48.300]  if you have a cold plant that's fine but we will we will bankrupt you we will set the
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:54.300]  taxes to a level and George Washington said the power to tax is the power to destroy they're
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:45:01.780]  using selective regulations and taxes as racketeers because GE's exempt on Obama's council to
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:07.420]  shut down their competition these are Chicago's scum Ken Lake came up with this plan here
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:13.300]  it is. So if somebody wants to build a cold plant they can it's just that it will bankrupt
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:19.260]  them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:23.460]  being emitted. And by the way we're on the radio in Chicago I have family in Chicago
[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:30.500]  it's a great city I mean Chicago Mafia scum I mean this is amazing Mark. Yes and he stated
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:34.780]  it very clearly and he's following through on it and that's what people who think oh
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:38.820]  this is you know he doesn't really mean it this isn't going to be that bad you know.
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:44.220]  My power bill is double what it was five years ago can people understand this. And again this
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:48.740]  is abundant cheap American energy that he's shutting down and you're absolutely right
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:52.420]  we're going to end up importing energy when you look at even oil we're shutting down you
[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:56.420]  know there are there they have this suit to get oil drilling back going in the United
[01:45:56.420 --> 01:46:01.620]  States and and Obama it went to Brazil and said hey we'll buy as much oil for you as
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:07.460]  possible he wants to he wants us to be dependent on the developing world's energy he wants to
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:14.420]  restrict our energy it's all part of that sort of you know that globalist agenda that
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:19.060]  most of the presidents have actually had certainly George Herbert Walker Bush has had in the
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:24.020]  following presidents after him that. And because they're in control of regulations so as long
[01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:28.980]  as it's things they can control they can get a slice of it so nobody else can operate but
[01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:33.100]  the insiders. And that's why what's frightening here is in Washington you actually have a
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:37.420]  few so-called self-styled libertarians and a few Republicans like former Secretary of
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:41.020]  State George Schultz all pushing for a carbon tax and they're claiming it's going to be
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:47.980]  a carbon neutral carbon tax here in Washington. What carbon neutral in Washington means they'll
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:53.820]  start a whole new tax temporarily for six months reduce a few other taxes get the new tax in
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:58.460]  and then six months after that jack up all the taxes and then they have a new power to tax.
[01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:03.500]  They always do. In closing here I want to play you this CNN clip for those that don't know the
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:09.820]  science the North Pole expands and shrinks just as the South Pole does in the summers and they
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:15.340]  both have summers in the opposite time anybody can go to NASA's own side and see a year-time lapse
[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:20.620]  of the Arctic shrinking in the summer expanding in the winter so for 500 years have been a
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:25.500]  northern passage everybody knows this except I guess the public I want to play this CNN clip
[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:30.060]  for Mark Moreno of Climate Depot and ask him how do they think they can get away with it then we'll
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:34.060]  go to break and come back with your calls after Mark goes here is the clip from a few days ago
[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:40.940]  that I've been talking about CNN CNN lying to their viewers here it is polar bears are the best
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:46.060]  example of it there are a group of polar bears that live out their life on ice as the ice has
[01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:50.780]  shrunk back towards the center of the Arctic Ocean the polar bears are taken away from their food
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:55.420]  the seals that live close to the land and so there's reports of malnourished and underway polar
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:48:00.860]  bears and things for that ice-based group but also overall too the Arctic the ice is what defines
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:05.660]  the Arctic overall and so as you do things like change the ice you change how much sunlight goes
[01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:10.140]  in the ocean and you totally change the food chain so Tom is there anything we can do about this
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:15.420]  just to reverse this or stop this you know I think the most important thing is this is that
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:20.620]  people have to realize that the planet isn't just changing it's changed and we need to start planning
[01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:25.340]  for that change and we need to think about changes to water resources sea level rise and those kinds
[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:30.700]  of things all right uh Tom Wagner thank you so much I really appreciate it just ahead and then
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:36.300]  it goes on to show that's the most important part in the reclip that I wanted was that you know
[01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:40.860]  they showed it shrinking look it's all disappearing and it was the shot of it in the winter that's
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:47.180]  what I wanted to show that no went well in the summer okay and very briefly Arctic sea ice first
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:54.140]  of all is up 66 67 percent from last year's record low and record low is only since 1979
[01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:59.740]  this is only in the pretty much the month of September the record low it was put in at a
[01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:04.860]  time of the of the end of the 1970s global cooling hysteria when the Arctic probably had the most ice
[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:10.060]  it had in 40 years so the bottom line is Arctic ice is making a massive recovery first of all this
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:15.660]  year the latest estimates of polar bear they used to be up to 25,000 now I've seen estimates up to
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:22.460]  32,000 the numbers are increasing and this idea that polar bears are dying or they're starting
[01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:27.660]  they had one the 16 year old polar bear that died they live 15 to 18 years but they're blaming a 16
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:33.340]  year old polar bear one polar bear's death on somehow CO2 killed this polar bear a polar bear
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:38.620]  experts are coming out of the out of the woodwork now saying that the losing the ice in the summer
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:44.140]  which is what the what the cnn and others uh you know hype with this expert they as this guest they
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:49.260]  had on doesn't affect their feeding and other things like that the bottom line is polar bears
[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:55.820]  by all accounts are thriving and throughout most of the Arctic the Antarctic is at ordinary record
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:50:01.820]  sea ice extent since 1979 when satellite monitoring went there global sea ice is well above average
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:07.820]  if you combine the north and south poles if as Joe Bestardi the meteorologist said today if the if
[01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:14.940]  the oceans shift and the Arctic starts gaining ice in the south pole starts losing ice suddenly the
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:19.180]  global warmers are going to turn on a dime and claim that the southern hemisphere now is proof of
[01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:24.540]  global warming this is not science this is astrology this is they pick anywhere on the globe by the
[01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:30.940]  way the wildfires alex have absolutely we're at one of the record low years for wildfires this
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:36.460]  year same thing for tornadoes al gore says that there's now level six tornado uh hurricanes that's
[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:40.780]  underlie and then the washington post claimed well we may not have voted him directly but they
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:44.220]  haven't released the transcript they haven't released the audio that i'm aware of but they're
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:50.380]  they circled the wagon they're protected for from another idiotic state amazing well thank god you're

[02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:49.420]  syria says terrorists will strike europe with chemical weapons syria's deputy foreign minister
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:53.740]  said wednesday the united states britain and france helped terrorists use chemical weapons in syria
[02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:58.220]  that's all come out now by the way in the foreign press and that the same groups will soon use them
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:03.020]  in against europe yes and then the bankers will take everybody's liberty and lock up all their
[02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:08.300]  opposition and say the patriots did it i'm telling you al qaeda is the key to taking over for the new
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:13.500]  world order and then the media spends it that i'm saying al qaeda doesn't exist or that al qaeda
[02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:20.300]  isn't a threat oh they're they're the big threat they work for the new world order on record i've
[02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:26.300]  had enough of it the prime suspect in ordering the gas attack is the secretary of state and i believe
[02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:29.660]  he gave the order south study to have the state department works and i know they're running the
[02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:35.820]  rebels he would make that decision you just see carry in that briefing and picking the targets i mean
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:42.060]  it makes me want to throw up and again i'm not romanticizing the government over there or Assad
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:47.900]  it's the people i'm romanticizing it is wrong to frame a country attack it for two and a half years
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:52.300]  into that i said i'm going to your calls we're going to go to them right now let's talk to
[02:01:52.300 --> 02:02:00.380]  Aaron in Nevada you're on the air and welcome i think you have the john is the best producer
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:04.860]  in talk radio today i just want to say that up front say that again your phone was a bit over
[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:11.500]  driven i have what sir and john is the best producer in talk radio today in my opinion well
[02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:15.100]  well i mean let me just give credit where it's all due everybody kind of comes up with ideas
[02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:19.740]  for what to cover i mean producers and i'm not stealing john's thunder he does an incredible
[02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:24.300]  job on the nightly news and actually helps produce that more than even this show and john does do a
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:30.460]  great job technically people think of producers in movies as the person that pays for it so then
[02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:34.940]  always at access tv whoever i had run in the show people would go to them like they were my boss
[02:02:34.940 --> 02:02:38.860]  well this is who pays for the show they didn't get what that producer meant a radio producer
[02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:43.580]  actually decides what to put on and stuff and so technically because i've already been offered jobs
[02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:48.380]  for a while would have a producer of me i am the producer i guess you would call them associate
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:52.460]  producers they come up with you know gas what do you think of this what do you think of that
[02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:56.140]  and i'm actually trying to get them to do more producing they kind of you know like want to
[02:02:56.140 --> 02:03:00.220]  be honorable and just say oh alex you decide what to do but they are all producing they're
[02:03:00.220 --> 02:03:04.300]  all associate producing but john bound does a great job as a reporter as well go ahead
[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:12.780]  well i meant uh john harman uh oh no john harman john harman is at the satellite uplink place uh
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:18.540]  and he just went ah and john harman i've worked with for 10 years does do a fabulous job in fact
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:23.020]  i probably wouldn't even be on genesis even though genesis is great i would just indicate myself
[02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:28.780]  what's the point uh if i didn't was it friends with ted for so long and if i didn't like john
[02:03:28.780 --> 02:03:33.580]  being up there as a backup so yes john harman is great as well world war three could be happening
[02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:39.340]  we're talking about people behind the scenes but that's fine with respect to the topic Syria i think
[02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:46.780]  this is about american and british zionists wanting to settle the golan matter in the macro
[02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:53.740]  second thing is i want to break here india is going to pledge its 500 tons of gold to the fed
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:59.820]  for two reasons one to stop the repeat falling and secondly to get their most favorite nation
[02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:04.220]  uh status back it's in limbo right now since jim so i just want to say those two things
[02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:09.180]  and i got questions for you jones and i want answers right now okay
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:17.260]  why didn't you cover strap for it bill deberg and are you still a supporter of the state of
[02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:21.100]  israel are you taking a different position since that one recording we have on youtube of you
[02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:26.380]  well number one i mean you're calling it all arrogant i appreciate your call i said like 16
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:31.980]  years ago that i supported the state of israel existing because the united nations was saying
[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:38.300]  it shouldn't exist now i would like to have a one state type situation if people could live in
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:42.140]  harmony the problem is the globalists are running the jihadis as well and then yes there's a lot of
[02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:47.820]  bad forces in israel that are being used to create global crises so the banksters can sit all above
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:54.060]  it and pick up the pieces as for strap for at bill deberg i didn't didn't know that but it is a

[02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:31.260]  really powerful breaking news at the bottom of the hour uh with a fellow that's doing reporting
[02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:38.540]  for m4wars.com of course he runs storylink.com anthony gucciardi says amazing work he dug
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:44.300]  up and was doing more research with the serious deputy foreign minister saying that they have
[02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:49.500]  evidence that it was western back rebels that launched a chemical attack and that they uh
[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:53.980]  that the rebels plan to attack the west which i've been telling you the next thing will be attack us
[02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:59.900]  and say syria did it and then the globalists get to fully destroy syria and take all our
[02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:04.540]  rights see how great that works think from the globalist perspective world net daily has Arab
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:08.940]  speakers they went and found the videos on established geod sites that have been there months
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:18.220]  and in some cases years with their uh military attack videos as you know they do and uh they
[02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:24.780]  are there bragging that a la akbar firing the chemicals for us i've been lying i mean it is
[02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:31.260]  amazing videos and so now that came out and while he was researching it this morning Reuters beat us
[02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:37.020]  to the punch so that's not just us saying it it's Reuters but we've got a more expanded article
[02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:41.900]  up at m4wars.com and prismplanet.com and he's going to be adding more to it it's about
[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:45.980]  eight nine paragraphs right now but he's going to be adding some of the videos and things to that
[02:09:45.980 --> 02:09:49.980]  right now but the Reuters story is only three paragraphs my point is we're giving you some
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:55.820]  of the background by the way Kerry's on record trying to block the UN inspectors that's why
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:10:01.340]  they didn't go in that day the so-called us the bankers that have hijacked us actually were holding
[02:10:01.340 --> 02:10:08.780]  the UN back while saying syria did it i mean these guys are dastardly villains and i'll make a deal
[02:10:08.780 --> 02:10:14.060]  you know when we beat the new world order and all this if there were ever real people you know
[02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:18.300]  actually overthrowing dictators and putting something better in i would i would be at least
[02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:22.380]  verbally supportive it's unconstitutional to go over there and give them weapons but
[02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:25.740]  you know i wouldn't try to stop them people have a right to throw off tyranny like our
[02:10:25.740 --> 02:10:33.020]  forebearers have done like my ancestors did in 1776 and in the 1836 as well i had family on both
[02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:38.060]  sides in both wars for liberty i get that but but this is not replace the red coats with something
[02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:43.900]  better this is replace the red coats with al-qaeda and i just do not support it i want to go back
[02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:51.020]  to your phone calls right now with that stories up on prisonplanet.com and up on infowars.com right
[02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:59.580]  now syria us aided terrorist and chemical attack europe next that is bomb shell and our media is
[02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:05.260]  actually using this as an excuse to attack oh israel says the terrorist that Assad has are
[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:09.980]  going to nerve gas europe now oh there's going to be terror attacks when you hear israel that means
[02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:14.860]  the war hawks in there that want to distract from their political problems and sell weapons systems
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:20.620]  all over the world just like our war hawks here same deal it's these globalists stand to gain
[02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:25.980]  nobody's the bad guy not even the saudi arabian people not the israeli people not the syrian
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:30.620]  people not the american people not the russian people not the chinese people not the mexican
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:38.380]  people not the chilean people not the brazilian people not the nigerians or south africans uh or
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:45.980]  the iraqis it is technocrats that know how to manipulate people who cheat in the game of life
[02:11:45.980 --> 02:11:52.220]  to play us off the answer is teach everyone how manipulation works as the old parables you know
[02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:56.860]  what do for children and teach wisdom that's why the old timers didn't trust big government didn't
[02:11:56.860 --> 02:12:02.060]  trust big banks didn't trust sharp dress slick talking people only trusted folks they'd done business
[02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:07.580]  with for 20 30 years and then you'd get an introduction from people going hey you've known me
[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:13.340]  for 30 years this guy can be trusted and if that guy couldn't be trusted then you'd probably never
[02:12:13.340 --> 02:12:20.140]  be invited back into business again but all that common sense is gone you got a bunch of lemmings
[02:12:20.140 --> 02:12:26.220]  and con harness and scammers everywhere i mean the general public folks is degenerate a good third
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:31.500]  of them the other third or so are totally stupid and out of the other third you got maybe 10 percent
[02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:36.860]  that are psychopathic or sociopathic parasite types and then 90 percent of that third you know
[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:41.020]  they're good patriots that are awake but we just get laughed at by the dumb down jellyfish
[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:46.540]  because to them it's like it's easier intellectually just to laugh at us than to admit they've been
[02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:51.660]  conned and join the human species let's go to your phone calls mike and colorado thanks for
[02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:58.060]  holding then la tate robert and bob and others go ahead mike thanks for holding hey you're welcome
[02:12:58.060 --> 02:13:03.820]  thank you alex um your analysis is spot on and the radio here agrees with you my question is
[02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:08.460]  doesn't this look like the only way to keep the dollar from completely collapsing is to have a
[02:13:08.460 --> 02:13:13.180]  world war and again what affiliate you're listening to when you say the the local host agree with me
[02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:19.340]  oh it's uh 710 kn us yeah great folks up there we got a couple good affiliates of colorado
[02:13:20.140 --> 02:13:24.700]  as the communists try to take the state over what a lot of shame but we think that affiliate there
[02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:32.620]  look but it's not actually they're already devaluing all the currencies and slowly devaluing
[02:13:32.620 --> 02:13:38.700]  uh the globalists could prop up the dollar anytime they wanted they are bringing in a world financial
[02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:44.300]  meltdown designed according to my own research and all the other top economists out there that
[02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:49.900]  have a track record of being accurate they're already devaluing everything in concert okay you
[02:13:49.900 --> 02:13:56.460]  know one goes down faster than other than one rises but still overall the dollars lost 99
[02:13:56.460 --> 02:14:02.300]  percent of its value since 1913 and most of that's in the last decade so it's it's accelerating
[02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:07.660]  basically or the last two decades to be technical but it's it's it's it's it's accelerating like a
[02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:12.300]  rocket ship going to light speed it's just it's going faster and faster now exponentially
[02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:19.020]  hurtling forward and there's a lot of things they could do to stabilize the dollar but that wouldn't
[02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:25.180]  transfer power to them but i agree you would think a war would hurt the dollar but short
[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:30.300]  term it'll actually help it uh many analysts say but you see it hurting stock markets so then there's
[02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:36.540]  other forces even within the establishment that are countervailing it's gyrating uh again there's
[02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:42.700]  not a world government yet it's not all synchronized yet they're trying to get synchronization
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:47.900]  they always call for an end to gridlock we need gridlock gridlock is good to keep these criminals
[02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:51.820]  from getting stuff passed but i mean give me your take sir i don't want to just rant at you
[02:14:52.380 --> 02:14:57.820]  no i agree but i think he is going to transition everybody to the sdr and if that's the case this
[02:14:57.820 --> 02:15:04.380]  war is probably a foregone conclusion which is really a bummer in my opinion uh yeah absolutely
[02:15:04.380 --> 02:15:08.780]  and and a war like this uh the last time they had a world war the dollar became a world reserve
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:14.460]  currency and then brettanwoods happened uh they are moving at davos is like the public boulderburg
[02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:19.980]  meeting to phase out of the dollar into the sdr which private banks will then control the globe
[02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:25.020]  they won't even need carbon taxes then to take over but they want them to selectively shut down
[02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:31.340]  whoever they want carbon taxes are a purely discriminatory system but again we only think
[02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:35.660]  of black and white is the only way of discrimination when there's a thousand other flavors that no
[02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:41.980]  one's ever taught about god bless you i appreciate your call uh let's talk to tate in michigan tate
[02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:46.700]  you're on the air hey uh i normally only call and i disagree you have something that but this
[02:15:46.700 --> 02:15:51.980]  time you nailed it and uh the neo fascist globalists i believe have seized control of the united
[02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:58.060]  states of the federal reserve system and they're using the united states to wage a war of conquest
[02:15:58.060 --> 02:16:02.380]  using the sunni the wahhabi the jihadi mercenaries to stabilize the middle east
[02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:06.940]  and their order for their control and their corporate welfare war machine
[02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:11.180]  and this is the third time that they said that a thought had launched chemical attacks and as
[02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:15.500]  you know gerbil steven said if you repeat a lie over and over if people believe anything
[02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:20.940]  so you nailed it man you really are right on the target right here well i mean it's it's it
[02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:25.580]  god bless you i appreciate your call but it's not hard to nail the target when it's a trillion
[02:16:25.580 --> 02:16:31.340]  pound elephant five feet in front of you i mean it's just all out there in the open but
[02:16:31.340 --> 02:16:37.340]  this propaganda target's a public that doesn't pay attention oh like a sod chemical it's actually
[02:16:37.340 --> 02:16:43.580]  four times a sod chemical a sod chemical a sod chemical oh a sod bad man chemical kill him
[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:48.540]  for the children not knowing it'll kill hundreds of times conservatively to have a full-born invasion
[02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:54.700]  but that same laws kicked in here because over and over again they've seen the globalist caught
[02:16:54.700 --> 02:17:00.380]  lying about wmds and stuff so now they don't believe a word they say you see there's that
[02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:05.500]  loss of confidence in the system that all the polls show in the media the government all of it so
[02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:10.700]  it's a crazy time brother uh let's talk to robert in Missouri welcome sir
[02:17:10.700 --> 02:17:19.100]  Alex hey buddy hey i wanted to talk about Vladimir Putin being the wild card in this
[02:17:19.100 --> 02:17:26.700]  whole situation um i think look you hear about all this stuff especially like from steve quail
[02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:31.020]  who you haven't had on in a while about how there's all these russians here doing these joint
[02:17:31.020 --> 02:17:35.900]  operations with american troops this and that and then you got these people and other people in the
[02:17:35.900 --> 02:17:42.140]  alternative media they want to lionize Vladimir Putin like he's the savior of humanity but if you
[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:49.180]  remember back when dmitry medvedev was president of russia and he got caught off mic with obama
[02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:56.540]  and obama was saying well after i get reelected i'll have more freedom etc etc so we got to look
[02:17:56.540 --> 02:18:02.940]  at Putin to possibly stab us in the back absolutely rough there's so many russian troops
[02:18:02.940 --> 02:18:08.060]  possibly operating here and then you hear about all this door-to-door book sales thing going on
[02:18:08.060 --> 02:18:14.620]  with people with slavic accents and i'm thinking somehow that we might have a domestic situation
[02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:19.660]  happened here well listen most of the people in israel are from the eastern block or russia so a
[02:18:19.660 --> 02:18:23.340]  lot of those are israelis going around doing the book sales and it has turned out a lot of them
[02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:29.260]  actually are um auxiliary massade agents that's actually come out in the news but there's also
[02:18:29.260 --> 02:18:33.980]  russians as well look you've got the different power blocks investing with each other you've
[02:18:33.980 --> 02:18:38.780]  got the west trying to take over russia a fifth column there you've got russia going sure will
[02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:44.060]  do inspections that's all part of treaties but but everybody's eyeing each other everybody's
[02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:49.260]  targeting each other the globalists don't trust each other there's no honor among thieves so i
[02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:55.820]  don't lionize Putin uh i've had people you know that won't even come on this show anymore uh because
[02:18:55.820 --> 02:19:01.740]  i won't lionize Putin uh and i mean i'm not an idiot i don't lionize any of these people the
[02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:05.820]  point is the russian tyranny can't get its act together and they're not the ones shutting down
[02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:10.620]  my power plants opening my borders up and trying to take my guns the new world order is my front
[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:15.820]  and center enemy who's also funding al-qaeda so they can run around and try to destabilize russia
[02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:21.340]  and everybody else so my whole issue is to me russia is a threat because the globalists may push
[02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:28.140]  them into new king people uh so but absolutely i this this worship of pootie poot uh that i
[02:19:28.140 --> 02:19:32.860]  as bush called him and i see everywhere i don't think is healthy i mean he's more respectable
[02:19:32.860 --> 02:19:37.740]  because he is a former you know killer for the kgb and he does do a lot of stuff it's not just him
[02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:43.820]  grandstanding he is a macho you know former kgb killer so i mean that's kind of cooler than obama
[02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:50.060]  you know some fake you know foppish teleprompter reading you know garbage head and people hate
[02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:53.660]  the new world order and they rightfully should hate it more than russia but that doesn't mean
[02:19:53.660 --> 02:19:57.900]  then we should be in lovey-dovey people tend to choose no i want this or i want that how about

[02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:27.500]  finally accomplished and everything unravels only those who know this secret info will survive and

[02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:20.700]  you can run on for a long time run on for a long run on for a long time until a bio weapon gets out
[02:24:20.700 --> 02:24:27.100]  until a nuclear weapon detonates and every country releases on each other and 40 000 nukes go off in
[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:33.900]  less than an hour you can go on for a long time until the public discovers that criminals in our
[02:24:33.900 --> 02:24:38.460]  government are running al-qaeda to use it to destabilize the world including the west to take
[02:24:38.460 --> 02:24:42.780]  our liberty so they can pose as saviors your calls are coming up after the break but i want to get
[02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:47.420]  to a few of these clips now to put it in context i've got a new clip here but first i want to air
[02:24:47.420 --> 02:24:52.540]  a short clip of john carrey from two days ago saying it doesn't matter who did the chemicals
[02:24:53.500 --> 02:24:56.940]  and now we learned he blocked the un from going and investigating
[02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:02.220]  because they knew who they'd find out it was his guys when you realize the state departments
[02:25:02.220 --> 02:25:06.940]  running outside of congress and the pentagon this operation that that's the leader of the
[02:25:06.940 --> 02:25:13.660]  rebels is john carrey technically a very good chance he called the shots i mean just think of
[02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:20.220]  the absurdistness of that i likened it to hitler running the nuremberg trials or al capone being
[02:25:20.220 --> 02:25:26.380]  the judge in his own trial um you know jeffrey dommer if you have a press conference and so
[02:25:26.380 --> 02:25:30.220]  we've got to stop the guy kidnapping you know adolescents and eating them in the area and
[02:25:30.220 --> 02:25:35.740]  he's got you know dead kids and see through barrels right to his left and right i mean this is so
[02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:41.100]  over the top sick i can't even compute it let's go to that clip the un investigation
[02:25:41.100 --> 02:25:47.260]  will not determine who used these chemical weapons you sure hope not only whether such
[02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:55.180]  weapons were used oh a judgment that is already clear to the world yeah i spoke on thursday
[02:25:55.180 --> 02:26:00.940]  with syrian prime minister that's enough all right let's go to the next clip because this
[02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:06.300]  dovetails with the new clip of anculture saying the president can do whatever he wants and she
[02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:11.260]  also says radiation is good for you took a shame on me this is so many conservatives love this woman
[02:26:11.260 --> 02:26:17.660]  she's not a conservative she is a she used to be this bad but i mean she she does it for attention
[02:26:17.660 --> 02:26:22.140]  that much it's clear but i mean she really isn't authoritarian and she'll say some good
[02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:25.740]  stuff against political correctness and stuff but it's so bizarre even sean hannity has to
[02:26:25.740 --> 02:26:30.300]  disagree with her i mean you know sean hannity came out by the way i have the clips here and was
[02:26:30.300 --> 02:26:35.580]  against what's happening in syria because i think he loves his kids uh when bet came out and said
[02:26:35.580 --> 02:26:43.580]  it's crazy we got to stop it good good absolutely you got to stop it i mean this is crazy man funding
[02:26:43.580 --> 02:26:47.900]  al qaeda to do this and kill all these christians bare minimum i'd be mad if he was killing other
[02:26:47.900 --> 02:26:54.380]  muslims and this is wrong let's go to that clip uh with the congress folks with panetta last year
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:58.220]  saying you got to get an agreement to be able to go into syria from congress he's no we'll get it
[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:04.060]  from foreign groups this is a foreign coup folks here it is you know again uh our our goal would be
[02:27:04.060 --> 02:27:10.140]  to uh to seek international permission and uh we would we would come to the congress uh and inform
[02:27:10.140 --> 02:27:16.460]  you uh and determine uh how best to approach this uh whether or not we would uh want to get
[02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:21.660]  permission from the congress uh i think those are issues we would have to discuss as we decide
[02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:29.500]  what to do here well i'm almost breathless about that because what i heard you say is we're going
[02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:35.340]  to seek international approval and they will come and tell the congress all right and then he goes and
[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:41.260]  says you know walk that back and he goes no we don't need you anymore and that full clip's famous
[02:27:41.260 --> 02:27:51.180]  we played it many times let's go to the next clip this is an exchange uh between uh and culture and
[02:27:51.180 --> 02:27:59.660]  sean hannity last night uh talking about launching a war without congressional approval here it is
[02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:03.660]  you agree or disagree i want to talk about the hypocrisy where he said president doesn't have
[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:08.940]  the power under the constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that
[02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:15.260]  was in 2007 not involved stopping an actual or imminent threat to this country right so based
[02:28:15.260 --> 02:28:21.660]  on his definition what he is going to do is unconstitutional more proof that i'm right
[02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:27.020]  of course the commander-in-chief has that power um and it's appalling that the american people
[02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:32.620]  would elect that man commander-in-chief but that having been done look obama also said
[02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:37.500]  oh he's going to shut down guantanamo are you sorry he didn't shut down guantanamo the question
[02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:42.540]  is the merits of this particular intervention i think that's enough that's enough i mean i mean
[02:28:42.540 --> 02:28:50.060]  ladies and gentlemen under laws passed from the fifties for mutually assured destruction
[02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:57.020]  if it congress gave the president they gave authorization to try to try to
[02:28:58.220 --> 02:29:02.780]  launch missiles to knock out the russian missiles if they did a first launch so they
[02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:07.980]  wouldn't have to call congress and get on authorization that is pre authorization there
[02:29:07.980 --> 02:29:13.820]  is no pre authorization for an invasion or bombardment of syria and that's what you
[02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:19.340]  got to go to congress for and inculters a smart lady and she knows that and obama a constitutional
[02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:26.700]  lawyer he knows that and everybody knows that but this is worse obama says they get the approval
[02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:34.700]  from nato in the un that's treason but now he says because un won't go along with it it's so evil
[02:29:34.700 --> 02:29:38.620]  because the whole world knows what's going on nine percent approval rating for this
[02:29:38.620 --> 02:29:45.580]  because i don't even eat that i got john mccain why don't we just make john mccain god make that
[02:29:45.580 --> 02:29:53.100]  piece of trash emperor everybody could ruin this stool we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:33:42.700 --> 02:33:48.780]  says europe is his next and he's also updated it's about to refresh with world net daily's
[02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:55.660]  article from yesterday with the video of known certified western jihadi back sites loading
[02:33:55.660 --> 02:34:01.420]  the chemical warheads in the mortars and um chattering about how wonderful bin laden is

[02:34:12.300 --> 02:34:17.500]  liberties your liberties gut the country get rid of the bill rights spy on us and they're running
[02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:24.460]  the terrorists publicly and i think they jump the shark here and now you have a top syrian
[02:34:25.100 --> 02:34:30.300]  deputy foreign minister coming out we even have this other clip from saudi arabia we haven't played
[02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:35.820]  yet we're going to play that after uh that that press tv report with the video of the saudi arabian
[02:34:35.820 --> 02:34:39.820]  intelligence chief threatening the russians that we're going to attack russia with al qaeda forces
[02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:45.340]  if they don't back out i mean this is wild how the bankers use these jihadis as their secret army
[02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:49.660]  and then play both sides like oh we're worried about al qaeda and then a lot of times you'll have a
[02:34:49.660 --> 02:34:54.460]  real jihadi who actually thinks they're fighting america but up the chain they've got a globalist
[02:34:54.460 --> 02:35:02.940]  boss so so this is uh big news up on info wars dot com an explosive declaration syria's deputy
[02:35:02.940 --> 02:35:07.340]  foreign minister has now come out on record in declaring that the u.s britain and france
[02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:13.420]  were instrumental in aiding the chemical attacks on syria through a network of terrorist inside
[02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:18.620]  the country and it's not just them even world net daily is saying that and it was the same group that
[02:35:18.620 --> 02:35:25.580]  even yahoo nine months or eight months ago uh reported on yes and showed the evidence that yes
[02:35:25.580 --> 02:35:31.660]  they staged the chemical attack uh also folks we have anthony gucciardi here with story leak dot
[02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:36.300]  com his great side he's living austin a few years ago does great work with mike adams of natural
[02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:41.260]  news dot com as well and he said hey well you ought to come in and uh help out as a reporter so
[02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:46.940]  they know that's the exact idea i have so he's teamed up with us as well man uh this is big and
[02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:52.300]  this is getting no attention this roiders report but you went and found his full statement uh
[02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:57.340]  anthony break this down for us exactly so do you remember when it was a conspiracy theory to say
[02:35:57.340 --> 02:36:00.860]  that we were working with the syrian rebels to actually go in and launch the chemical attack
[02:36:00.860 --> 02:36:06.220]  or even working with al-qaeda well now we found not only this roiders report but there's a bunch
[02:36:06.220 --> 02:36:11.180]  of other reports from the independent as well like does obama know he's fighting on al-qaeda's side
[02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:15.820]  so it's now 100 admitted and that's on drudge that's kind of really make the globalist mad
[02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:20.620]  yes exactly but check out this report so this one now from roiders the headline is actually
[02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:24.940]  deceptive it says it doesn't even talk about in the headline how we're actually aiding the al-qaeda
[02:36:24.940 --> 02:36:30.620]  terrorists ever but it talks about how europe is next but in the first paragraph as i report on
[02:36:30.620 --> 02:36:35.660]  info wars and it was up on story leak as well basically what's going on is this foreign official
[02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:41.580]  from syria said not only did the us aid the al-qaeda terrorist who carried out these chemical
[02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:46.140]  attacks but he went to the u.n. immediately and showed them all the information and they just
[02:36:46.140 --> 02:36:52.140]  disregarded he went straight to the u.n. and that's what and now we learned carry said do not look
[02:36:52.140 --> 02:36:57.820]  at that you're ordered to not look at it and now we know why boy also this is so obvious it is so
[02:36:57.820 --> 02:37:03.340]  obvious and let me show you something else this yahoo report from january of 2013 is this you know
[02:37:03.340 --> 02:37:08.700]  are they psychic or what and check out how they reference info wars it says us backed plan to launch
[02:37:08.700 --> 02:37:14.540]  chemical weapon attack on syria blame it on Assad government that's from yahoo earlier this year
[02:37:14.540 --> 02:37:19.580]  the obama administration gave green signal to a chemical weapons attack plan in syria that could
[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:25.740]  be blamed on Assad's regime and in turn spur international military action in the devastated
[02:37:25.740 --> 02:37:30.860]  country leaked documents have shown i linked up to that article and yahoo news that's the number one
[02:37:30.860 --> 02:37:35.660]  website in the world they just beat out google the number one trafficked website in the whole world
[02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:40.940]  the biggest news site the biggest search engine whatever says us backed plan to launch chemical
[02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:46.220]  weapon attack on syria so now it is not only admitted the mainstream media was forced to cover it
[02:37:46.220 --> 02:37:51.660]  and as it turns out it's 100% accurate the chemical weapons attack on syria to launch and then the
[02:37:51.660 --> 02:37:57.660]  jihadis are so out of control they videotaped themselves doing it in world net dailies covering
[02:37:57.660 --> 02:38:03.340]  it how about how about the fact that they behead christians as well this one says they beheaded
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:08.860]  and it pretty much an entire village cut off their heads with a small knife to a cheering crowd of
[02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:14.300]  dozens so they're going and doing this and it even mentions this is the washington times by the way
[02:38:14.300 --> 02:38:19.340]  it says the reported beheading of the two christians comes about the same time america has started
[02:38:19.340 --> 02:38:25.660]  sending arms to the rebel fighters well the head of al qaeda has come out zawa herey and praise the
[02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:32.940]  u.s. for its loving of event and helping with the rebels and that's like mainstream news you've
[02:38:32.940 --> 02:38:38.220]  got i mean this is insanity imagine how brainwash we are what happened during september 11 the boogie
[02:38:38.220 --> 02:38:43.260]  man al qaeda terrorists were to blame and now the boogie man al qaeda terrorists are our greatest
[02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:47.900]  allies and syria is to blame and i think we've talked about this before we've entered 1984 we
[02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:53.180]  have entered 1984 but syria is the distraction almost it's about the russians the russians are
[02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:57.420]  launching a hot war on the u.s. and we're actually instigating it because russia is supporting Assad
[02:38:57.420 --> 02:39:02.220]  and we are supporting syrian rebels this is much greater than syria syria is an issue and we don't
[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:06.700]  want the the war because it will turn into world war three but it's really a distraction from this
[02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:12.380]  ultimate hot incendiary world war three scenario because when we go in and we have israel blow up
[02:39:12.380 --> 02:39:17.100]  the russian missile caches and then say it wasn't them and ultimately comes out through cnn that it
[02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:22.380]  was them according to us intel officers who don't want world war three to happen now we see it's a
[02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:26.700]  hot scenario so it's ultimately going to build a world war three and let me ask this question why
[02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:32.700]  do some elements in the u.s europe trance especially wants this and israel some elements in israel
[02:39:32.700 --> 02:39:37.580]  i mean it really is madness but it's the same question why did john corzine make 40 to one
[02:39:37.580 --> 02:39:44.060]  bets yeah against other people's money i mean they're the crazy people they control people we can go
[02:39:44.060 --> 02:39:48.540]  to actually something called codex elementaries is how that works as a health group the largest
[02:39:48.540 --> 02:39:51.580]  health group in the world where they vote on what supplements you're allowed to take and everything
[02:39:51.580 --> 02:39:56.380]  like that and how the u.s. works is they bully these small islands and everything like that to vote
[02:39:56.380 --> 02:40:00.060]  in favor of the u.s. including france and uk and everything like that's right that's right criminal
[02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:04.300]  elements in our government the state department on record get all the third world countries to out
[02:40:04.300 --> 02:40:09.820]  vote our american congress and the rest of it it's incredible i have insiders inside codex the only
[02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:14.300]  one authorized in the united states of america and he goes in he says that basically what the u.s.
[02:40:14.300 --> 02:40:18.300]  does is if they don't go along with the u.s. program they threaten them with trade wars
[02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:22.860]  so they say if you don't agree with us on allowing aspartame to be in food or whatever it is then
[02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:26.540]  we're going to go ahead and launch trade wars against you we're going to head going to put
[02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:31.180]  sanctions on you and ultimately destroy your economy this is bullying this is what's going
[02:40:31.180 --> 02:40:35.420]  to lead to world war three because as you see in that report over there from lawyers not just the
[02:40:35.420 --> 02:40:40.460]  u.s. eight of these al-qaeda terrorists but it was also the uk and france and other nations as well
[02:40:40.460 --> 02:40:44.940]  so they're pulling them all into the and the key is they're saying these guys are going to attack
[02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:49.820]  you with this yes which shows their understanding is i've been saying over and over again the next
[02:40:49.820 --> 02:40:55.180]  plan is to turn the jihadis loose on us with the missiles and and and they think we're so dumb
[02:40:56.060 --> 02:41:00.780]  and turning the tilt go we've got to take your rights al-qaeda hit us the roiders comments you
[02:41:00.780 --> 02:41:06.380]  can read someone they said why would they attack europe if the europeans are controlling the jihadists
[02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:11.260]  this answers the question they are controlling their own officers to attack other countries and
[02:41:11.260 --> 02:41:16.060]  then unleash them like we saw in the u.s. they use them in the 80s and 90s al-qaeda and then they
[02:41:16.060 --> 02:41:21.500]  used it on the united why can't adults i remember when episode three of star wars came out the only
[02:41:21.500 --> 02:41:26.540]  good one of the of the next three really again i'm kind of a fan is you know in a cheesy way
[02:41:26.540 --> 02:41:31.660]  but the storyline everyone was asking george lucas like months after came out we don't understand
[02:41:31.660 --> 02:41:37.900]  your storyline and it was so simple emperor palpatine has become emperor by staging an attack
[02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:42.380]  on his own planet to then become a prominent senator saying they had done enough then to stage
[02:41:42.380 --> 02:41:47.340]  more attacks on the on the imperial planet under emergency to make himself chancellor
[02:41:47.340 --> 02:41:52.140]  and then to finally make himself emperor and shut up the jedi and say they're all traitors and it
[02:41:52.140 --> 02:41:57.820]  turns out he was running the the al at least literally al-qaeda people at sand folks you know
[02:41:57.820 --> 02:42:04.140]  from desert planets attacking and then he double crosses and kills all them and then wipes everybody
[02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:08.540]  out and and he said this is what's really going on with 9 11 that's a quote obviously showing
[02:42:08.540 --> 02:42:13.980]  he's a 9 11 truther basically explaining how geopolitical both sides work and and the uh
[02:42:13.980 --> 02:42:18.060]  i think was vanity fair that interviewed him said we still don't understand adults cannot
[02:42:18.060 --> 02:42:22.060]  understand this they play the same thing over and over again do you remember the report i did on the
[02:42:22.060 --> 02:42:27.420]  cia they can't understand the star wars movie they can't that has this plot and reagan assisted
[02:42:27.420 --> 02:42:32.940]  you know reagan can do no wrong he assisted saddam hussein and the cia did in launching chemical
[02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:38.940]  attacks on from iraq to iran so iraq could seal a victory do you remember that in the 80s yeah
[02:42:38.940 --> 02:42:44.620]  they were losing and the cia authorized with the weather reports and the satellites uh and
[02:42:44.620 --> 02:42:51.580]  even sold them rapidly the uh the british uh uh 18 wheelers that could pump up hydrogen balloons
[02:42:51.580 --> 02:42:56.060]  so the cia could direct the chemical weapons because they didn't have good gps then with uh
[02:42:56.060 --> 02:43:00.300]  with the cameras and then that's why they had the list of those and then later said these are
[02:43:00.300 --> 02:43:06.300]  anthrax trucks from saddam hussein the ones they shipped in to help run the chemical attack
[02:43:06.300 --> 02:43:10.300]  absolutely yeah they helped them and then they attacked them they helped saddam hussein he was
[02:43:10.300 --> 02:43:14.540]  great we need to help him we need to put him in power actually yeah they control him and then they
[02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:18.140]  also go and attack them just like al qaeda they owned al qaeda and controlled al qaeda and then
[02:43:18.140 --> 02:43:21.820]  they make them the bad guy now they're the good guy again this happens over and over again the
[02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:26.540]  chemical attack pattern we launched the chemical attacks from iraq towards iran to justify his
[02:43:26.540 --> 02:43:30.380]  justify military action now we're launching chemical attacks for the syrian rebels who
[02:43:30.380 --> 02:43:35.900]  behead christians on syria to justify military action it happens over and over again and so
[02:43:35.900 --> 02:43:40.220]  many good old boys like i heard one this morning on on syndicated radio going well good we got

[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:47.420]  and they have the biggest murder plans of anybody in history quantitative easing unemployment at
[02:50:47.420 --> 02:50:53.260]  depression levels europe financial system falling apart china getting out of us treasuries at the end
[02:50:53.260 --> 02:51:00.220]  of 2008 the time of tarp the national debt was at 11 trillion gold trading around 850 per ounce

[02:51:07.020 --> 02:51:12.380]  20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable politicians in washington have a ferocious
[02:51:12.380 --> 02:51:18.380]  appetite for spending and stimulus what's worse a printing press to finance 100 years ago we had a
[02:51:18.380 --> 02:51:23.100]  gold standard to limit this madness but now you have to adopt your own gold standard don't be

[02:54:21.340 --> 02:54:29.580]  well the scientific way to get these people that that don't see into the uh the corruption in the
[02:54:29.580 --> 02:54:36.620]  government and uh and that the these forces in the government aren't really backing their interest
[02:54:36.620 --> 02:54:45.500]  is got to be done through just waking the people up to how they themselves can participate directly
[02:54:45.500 --> 02:54:56.220]  in government that that's not to say that the people need to have uh uh you know just a a uh
[02:54:56.860 --> 02:55:05.100]  blanket uh control of the government but just a participation greater than this representation
[02:55:05.100 --> 02:55:12.860]  system which you advocate and i advocate but an additional part of that should be direct
[02:55:12.860 --> 02:55:23.180]  participation at every level by the people in order to protect their own interest does that
[02:55:23.180 --> 02:55:30.300]  make any sense no i hear you i mean look we're a decadent public uh on average uh even people
[02:55:30.300 --> 02:55:33.740]  work hard a lot of them just just are decadent when it comes to knowing all the world works
[02:55:33.740 --> 02:55:37.740]  and you know uh just waking people up isn't going to fix things either we have to kick
[02:55:37.740 --> 02:55:42.300]  these globalists down i mean they've only got nine percent approval for this new war
[02:55:42.940 --> 02:55:48.940]  but they may still go ahead with it and so you know we can wring our hands all day it was five
[02:55:48.940 --> 02:55:53.500]  percent defeated the british and if it comes down to it again we'll defeat the tyranny again or we
[02:55:53.500 --> 02:56:02.220]  can just totally submit to it but i appreciate your call um we've got to somehow explain to people
[02:56:02.220 --> 02:56:05.900]  that the government is not there for its best interest it's there for special interests that
[02:56:05.900 --> 02:56:11.100]  are very very nasty on average uh let's talk to steven illinois steve you're on the air welcome
[02:56:11.980 --> 02:56:17.420]  welcome uh i second the motion john harman should be your right hand man substituting
[02:56:17.420 --> 02:56:24.460]  for you when you take a day off he's a great guy um what uh what hey by the way we don't screen
[02:56:24.460 --> 02:56:28.780]  calls bro there's this thing of kissing the butt of the guy that answers the phones isn't what we
[02:56:28.780 --> 02:56:33.740]  do here i i know i know but i've dealt with him for years and you know that and he's always been
[02:56:33.740 --> 02:56:38.780]  a great guy um what i don't want to see is i don't want to see a damascus affair redox
[02:56:38.780 --> 02:56:43.740]  with a president martin van derren sending troops into the mascus again under a phony
[02:56:43.740 --> 02:56:49.340]  pretext uh i think we have to look at these so-called victims like uh they did to instigate
[02:56:49.340 --> 02:56:54.460]  world war one against the germans they called them they actually bought in english people are
[02:56:54.460 --> 02:56:59.020]  five minute men they called them and these were victims of construction and factory accidents
[02:56:59.020 --> 02:57:03.660]  and they all claim to have amputated limbs are paralyzed by the crowds when in fact they were
[02:57:03.660 --> 02:57:09.660]  people that were accident victims from construction or auto accidents or no no there was a lot of war
[02:57:09.660 --> 02:57:13.820]  propaganda and they did it they did it to attack the serbs showed they they brought in a guy who
[02:57:13.820 --> 02:57:18.380]  had tuberculosis and cancer and had him stand up against a fence and said he was in a concentration
[02:57:18.380 --> 02:57:24.380]  camp and that's been confirmed that's that's what they do yeah absolutely and and so we could take
[02:57:24.380 --> 02:57:28.220]  that with a grain of salt but then you know i was looking at the built site on yesterday
[02:57:28.220 --> 02:57:33.260]  and they had like a flowchart of all these different elements and they said um the biggest
[02:57:33.260 --> 02:57:39.980]  factor they felt was uh the emirate kawait or qatar the emirate qatar because they had all
[02:57:39.980 --> 02:57:47.020]  this money stored in london and so they're very influential with the uh the limies and um going
[02:57:47.020 --> 02:57:52.780]  through this flowchart here uh you see different things like it says that the muslim brotherhood
[02:57:52.780 --> 02:57:57.660]  is supported by qatar and turkey and then you see something else there's another faction
[02:57:57.660 --> 02:58:02.300]  michael no i mean it's a whole mess by the way folks the term limey comes from the uh
[02:58:02.300 --> 02:58:07.660]  reddish new to have limes so they wouldn't get uh scurvy and everybody made fun of them of it
[02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:11.100]  but then they'd be five thousand miles from home and fighting condition others wouldn't
[02:58:11.100 --> 02:58:15.260]  but anyways as for this chemical weapons report we saw this earlier in the year
[02:58:15.260 --> 02:58:22.700]  being floated around uh with different defense companies who weren't involved in it but uh
[02:58:22.700 --> 02:58:30.780]  it's the point is it was being pushed around thank you for listening to gcm visit gcm and

[03:00:29.900 --> 03:00:34.220]  it looks like cooler heads are prevailing at least a little bit with more defense ministers
[03:00:34.220 --> 03:00:38.220]  and others around the world saying let's not have a war with syria an open hot war this could lead to
[03:00:38.220 --> 03:00:45.260]  world war three and mainly there's such public anger at the whole plan only nine percent approval
[03:00:45.260 --> 03:00:52.460]  in major polls that right now obama's fidgeting back and forth so it shows that sanity can prevail
[03:00:52.460 --> 03:00:58.460]  but still there's the horrible evil proxy war using al-qaeda to commit commit those atrocities
[03:00:58.460 --> 03:01:03.420]  against the syrian people of all religious backgrounds and multiracial backgrounds as well
[03:01:04.140 --> 03:01:07.500]  it's not it's not just important that they're killing christians though that really gets to
[03:01:07.500 --> 03:01:12.140]  me that our media would just cover that up uh it's just horrible they're killing everybody and
[03:01:12.140 --> 03:01:15.980]  again they make it all about a sod it's not about a sod it's about he didn't start this
[03:01:15.980 --> 03:01:20.700]  and those little kids didn't start this either uh let's talk to dave in minnesota you're on the
[03:01:20.700 --> 03:01:25.820]  air dave welcome alex thank you so much for having me on today man thank you buddy i appreciate
[03:01:25.820 --> 03:01:30.060]  what you do i appreciate you for you staying over your allotted time and allowing me to share
[03:01:30.060 --> 03:01:34.620]  some overtime with you um just wanted to touch on a couple of really quick things here regarding syria
[03:01:34.620 --> 03:01:39.820]  um first off i think it's a huge distraction from something that's about to happen on the first uh
[03:01:40.460 --> 03:01:46.940]  i'm not sure if you know about uh what the pope had sent out about um immunity being stripped away
[03:01:46.940 --> 03:01:52.460]  from officers in government and officers in corporations um and the immunity i speak of is
[03:01:53.020 --> 03:01:57.420]  the immunity towards like war crimes and things like that like you know obama just signed something
[03:01:57.420 --> 03:02:03.820]  recently he's giving uh the bush guys uh immunity from crimes war crimes that they were being tried
[03:02:03.820 --> 03:02:09.340]  for uh over i don't remember where it was overseas but uh i thought that that was a possibility that
[03:02:09.340 --> 03:02:14.140]  this was just a huge distraction you see bernanke is uh resigning effective september or september
[03:02:14.140 --> 03:02:20.620]  one napolitano is uh resigning there's a few things going on of course it's a giant well i mean
[03:02:20.620 --> 03:02:26.060]  they want to take over syria and break it into a couple pieces but it yes it is also a diversion
[03:02:26.060 --> 03:02:33.900]  from all the scandals i mean how many are there i rs nsa ben gazi gate fast and furious the
[03:02:33.900 --> 03:02:41.900]  cylinder of energy scam deals uh the uh insider trading i mean it just goes on and on it's a
[03:02:41.900 --> 03:02:46.700]  giant political diversion just like the trayvon martin thing was it's just whatever they can get
[03:02:46.700 --> 03:02:52.220]  us fighting with each other over absolutely one one thing i wanted to point out that um i think
[03:02:52.220 --> 03:02:56.540]  this alludes back to an earlier caller he had mentioned something about uh we've you know for
[03:02:56.540 --> 03:03:01.260]  the people and of the people and things like that people need to understand that this government is
[03:03:01.260 --> 03:03:06.300]  literally a corporation it is incorporated that's why our president can be a canyon you may as well
[03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:11.820]  go vote for the president of target you know it does not matter it's a it's a corporate government
[03:03:11.820 --> 03:03:18.460]  it is not a real it's a de facto government no i agree with you that that's why they can tell congress
[03:03:18.460 --> 03:03:22.220]  hey we we don't need to follow you to launch for us i appreciate your call we need to get
[03:03:22.220 --> 03:03:27.260]  that word out to people i agree with you that's a fact i mean it is just crazy uh andy in west

[03:04:04.060 --> 03:04:09.260]  a lot of mobilization going on because this could turn into a war with russia i mean this is
[03:04:10.460 --> 03:04:15.020]  most of the analysts say that not just people we have on that this could go into world war three
