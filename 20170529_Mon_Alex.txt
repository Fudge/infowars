[00:00.000 --> 00:24.840]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:24.840 --> 00:30.840]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:30.840 --> 00:40.280]  technocracy, Hank Cooper. You're listening to Alex Jones. The suicide bomber has been
[00:40.280 --> 00:48.440]  identified in Handiwork, Salman Abadi, 23. Tens of thousands of jihadists have floored
[00:48.440 --> 00:53.280]  into Europe. Here's some of their Handiwork last night when the country that welcomed
[00:53.280 --> 00:55.280]  them with open arms was attacked.
[01:23.280 --> 01:47.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are five million people plus that have been brought into Europe
[01:47.360 --> 01:52.840]  in the last four years, 80% of our military age man according to Interpol. The United
[01:52.840 --> 01:59.080]  Nations ran a public program to recruit jihadists from the Arab Spring, from Africa, the Middle
[01:59.080 --> 02:09.080]  East, from Eastern Europe, from places like Chechnya to come to Germany, France, Belgium,
[02:09.080 --> 02:17.480]  Sweden, the UK, Canada, the United States. And they have pledged allegiance to ISIS
[02:17.480 --> 02:23.360]  and al-Qaeda, they have pledged allegiance to attack our countries. And then every time
[02:23.360 --> 02:27.400]  there's an attack which you're intensifying all the time with the shootings, the truck
[02:27.400 --> 02:35.040]  attacks, the bombings, the media comes out and I've got articles on Infowars.com and
[02:35.040 --> 02:45.520]  blames conservatism and says that Islamophobia is what is making these people attack us.
[02:45.520 --> 02:50.320]  That story is up on Infowars.com where the left was very, very quick to come out and
[02:50.320 --> 02:56.520]  bemoan Islamophobia backlash on social media following Manchester terror attack. So not
[02:56.520 --> 03:03.480]  only is the left and these globalist systems we have to blame for bringing in these vipers
[03:03.480 --> 03:08.920]  on top of it, they blame those of us that have warned of it and say it's our fault.
[03:08.920 --> 03:16.800]  And then a bunch of well-meaning teenagers, some of them children, you know why you let
[03:16.800 --> 03:21.600]  your kids go to a rock concert when they're eight years old, get attacked and I point
[03:21.600 --> 03:27.960]  out it's liberal, wide open UK and the liberal policies that are to blame for that in the
[03:27.960 --> 03:34.360]  aggregate on average, more than half the brits are the liberal trendies that would walk off
[03:34.360 --> 03:39.160]  a plank, who would jump off of a cliff, who would slip their own rest, cut their own heads
[03:39.160 --> 03:44.960]  off, they were told it was trending. And it's so sad to see mass Stockholm syndrome, I don't
[03:44.960 --> 03:52.440]  blame the victims. I blame the culture, the brainwashing, the globalist for turning people
[03:52.440 --> 03:57.640]  into cult members who will go along with religions and systems that are diametrically
[03:57.640 --> 04:06.640]  opposed to their own supposed beliefs. It's sick, but that media matters, David Brock
[04:06.640 --> 04:12.520]  comes out, because what do you do? What do you do when you push this agenda up in borders
[04:12.520 --> 04:17.560]  and bring it in the Islamist and they keep raping people and they keep killing people
[04:17.560 --> 04:25.280]  and they're fit to bill for being the rapugees that we call them? What do you do? You turn
[04:25.280 --> 04:30.960]  it around and you say, oh no, it's the right winger's fault. It's Alex Jones' fault.
[04:30.960 --> 04:36.240]  He stirred up the Muslims or he blames the children that got blown up. No, I blame the
[04:36.240 --> 04:42.200]  parents and I blame the liberals and I blame anyone who called for open borders to bring
[04:42.200 --> 04:46.320]  these rattlesnakes in. If I bring a rattlesnake in and stick it under your bed and it bites
[04:46.320 --> 04:51.000]  you, it's my fault. But if you know I've stuck a rattlesnake in there and you go along with
[04:51.000 --> 04:57.760]  it as well, you become part of it. That's just common sense logic. They are the ones
[04:57.760 --> 05:27.600]  that are guilty.
[05:27.600 --> 05:57.240]  That's just common sense logic.
[05:57.240 --> 06:03.400]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington
[06:03.400 --> 06:08.080]  and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their
[06:08.080 --> 06:13.320]  hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice. That's what this holiday and remembrance
[06:13.320 --> 06:17.520]  is all about. It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building
[06:17.520 --> 06:22.920]  a better world. This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest
[06:22.920 --> 06:27.520]  we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers
[06:27.520 --> 06:31.960]  that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action. We have over a thousand high

[06:56.960 --> 07:02.120]  Embricks Essentials, that's my middle name. I've spent seven years off and on trying to
[07:02.120 --> 07:08.760]  get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of
[07:08.760 --> 07:14.240]  personal care products that's organic high quality. This is one of the top three selling
[07:14.240 --> 07:19.800]  organic brands in the country that puts out high quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you
[07:19.800 --> 07:25.120]  name it and they're such patriots they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[07:25.120 --> 07:29.000]  It is an answer to prayer and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail

[07:55.760 --> 07:56.760]  Essentials.
[07:56.760 --> 08:23.600]  That's the headline with the tweets in the news article headlines at infowars.com. Leftist
[08:23.600 --> 08:31.600]  Amon Islamophobia backlash on social media following Manchester terrorist attack and
[08:31.600 --> 08:37.520]  basically blame Christians for stirring up the Muslims. We need to submit to their religion.
[08:37.520 --> 08:41.880]  We need to put our women in a jobs. We need to have the feminist groups go out and scream
[08:41.880 --> 08:46.800]  Allah Akbar in the town squares all over the United States all over Europe and that will
[08:46.800 --> 08:50.560]  make the Islamists stop attacking us.
[08:50.560 --> 08:57.480]  All over the news they're asking who is the accomplice to the reported bomber that CBS
[08:57.480 --> 09:03.160]  News and Drugs Report and others are now reporting Salman Abadi. Who are the accomplices? Let
[09:03.160 --> 09:13.560]  me tell you the Democratic Party, the Labour Party of the UK, Merkel's Party in Germany.
[09:13.560 --> 09:18.760]  People like Macron that says Islamic attacks are now part of life just accept it and the
[09:18.760 --> 09:23.240]  riots and the rapes and the car attacks and the stabbings and the shootings and the no
[09:23.240 --> 09:30.760]  go zones everywhere and the mayor of London declaring it London stand and saying that
[09:30.760 --> 09:39.000]  it's now part of life just accept terror. It's never called Islamist. That's who's
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.440]  aiding and abetting. They keep saying who was helping him? How did he do it? They brought
[09:43.440 --> 09:49.600]  back thousands and thousands just 1600 last few months have come back into Europe and
[09:49.600 --> 09:56.760]  back into the UK who were actual ISIS fighters and who were on a watch list. There are more
[09:56.760 --> 10:03.800]  than 4000 total on ISIS watch list just in the UK alone and thousands more a month coming
[10:03.800 --> 10:09.320]  into Europe that Interpol allows in. They know they're ISIS fighters, they know they're
[10:09.320 --> 10:17.720]  al-Qaeda, they know they're Wahhabis and they let them back into the countries. So you ask
[10:17.720 --> 10:23.360]  who's behind this? The UN, the globalist, the refugee programs. George Soros pushing
[10:23.360 --> 10:29.560]  it. The UN certifies it's safe to bring them in, does no background checks, lets the unknown
[10:29.560 --> 10:34.920]  ISIS fighters, orders our State Department to let them in. That's what we live under
[10:34.920 --> 10:40.440]  and it's the same thing in the UK where the EU orders the UK on who to let in and if the
[10:40.440 --> 10:49.080]  UK doesn't let in ISIS fighters, they're fined up to 100,000 pounds for refusing entry and
[10:49.080 --> 10:53.520]  they're talking about charging more. They're talking about a million euros. Just type it
[10:53.520 --> 11:00.960]  into Google if you don't accept that. And so ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure many of
[11:00.960 --> 11:04.160]  the parents of the young people that were at this concert, many were adults, many were
[11:04.160 --> 11:09.800]  tweenies, many were teens. Most adults probably there don't like having open borders to Islam.
[11:09.800 --> 11:15.800]  But I guarantee a lot of the parents do want to go along with bringing in radical Islam.
[11:15.800 --> 11:22.160]  And bottom line, they are now responsible for this animal bombing and killing 22-plus
[11:22.160 --> 11:28.120]  people. The parents that call for open borders and call for appeasement are just as guilty
[11:28.120 --> 11:33.760]  as Macron and Merkel and Hillary Clinton and Obama and all the rest of them. You're the
[11:33.760 --> 11:38.440]  ones that have these dead children's blood on your hands. You're the trendies that love
[11:38.440 --> 11:42.560]  this. I was at the mall yesterday with my children and many of the shops I walked by
[11:42.560 --> 11:47.600]  like Gap. We have some footage we can roll in a minute. Show women in Hajjibs on their
[11:47.600 --> 11:55.880]  front billboards. The number one thing they're promoting is women in Hajjibs. It is absolutely
[11:55.880 --> 11:59.520]  being force fed to us. Just a few months ago at the inauguration, I saw them handing out
[11:59.520 --> 12:06.160]  thousands of American flag Hajjibs to women. And I couldn't believe it. It turned out it
[12:06.160 --> 12:11.840]  was officially run by Muslims and George Soros funded it. And that it was an induction into
[12:11.840 --> 12:17.240]  Islam. And then we see it all over the news. USA Today, you name it, women wearing the
[12:17.240 --> 12:25.360]  Hajjib, even if they're not Muslims, to stand against Trump. You just had the truck attack
[12:25.360 --> 12:29.360]  killing a bunch of people in Stockholm, Sweden. They wouldn't show the dead and dying people.
[12:29.360 --> 12:34.120]  They don't want to show you the dead teenagers and dead young people up close from Manchester
[12:34.120 --> 12:40.120]  close to where Paul Watson's from. And then they have the nerve at Media Matters, openly
[12:40.120 --> 12:45.560]  funded by George Soros, the Nazi collaborator, to come out and say, Alex Jones blames the
[12:45.560 --> 12:49.520]  victims and then they have their own people quoted and they're saying, kill me, shoot
[12:49.520 --> 12:54.640]  me, murder me. Well, I guess your Islamist will probably try. And what I actually said
[12:54.640 --> 13:00.920]  was upwards of half the population in Britain in polls or more, one open borders and Muslims
[13:00.920 --> 13:07.880]  to be brought in. And so these are the people that are guilty of this. And you are guilty
[13:07.880 --> 13:13.760]  if you promoted this of aiding and abetting people that just went like cowards and bombed
[13:13.760 --> 13:21.440]  a bunch of innocent children. But see an upside down bizarro world, you have to invert it
[13:21.440 --> 13:26.280]  and say conservatives and libertarians and nationalists and just common sense people.
[13:26.280 --> 13:32.180]  We made the Muslims bad. We made them attack us. We have to appease them. We have to bow
[13:32.180 --> 13:36.400]  down to them. We have to go along with them better and then everything would have been
[13:36.400 --> 13:42.840]  okay. Paul Joseph Watson joins us from London, England. We are then joined, ladies and gentlemen,
[13:42.840 --> 13:49.480]  at the bottom of the hour by some of the other witnesses to what happened from the UK as
[13:49.480 --> 13:58.760]  well. Paul Watson will then be hosting the fourth hour. And we have Tommy Robinson again,
[13:58.760 --> 14:02.640]  who is one of the front lines of exposing this. He'll be joining us coming up in about
[14:02.640 --> 14:06.200]  20 minutes. But Paul Watson joins us right now. And then I'm going to play the clips
[14:06.200 --> 14:11.800]  of the mayor of London saying just get used to it. Just get used to it, baby. You're going
[14:11.800 --> 14:16.160]  to get cocked and cocked hard. And it's not his fault, though. It's my fault. Media
[14:16.160 --> 14:21.640]  Matters doesn't say he shows any blame. It's me. George Soros, the Nazi collaborator,
[14:21.640 --> 14:26.400]  says it's my fault. It's your fault because you didn't bring in enough Muslims. You didn't
[14:26.400 --> 14:30.120]  cut enough genitals off women. You didn't put enough headdresses on them. You didn't
[14:30.120 --> 14:36.760]  bow down enough. You didn't give in enough. You didn't submit enough. You read the Media
[14:36.760 --> 14:41.240]  Matters. It's like I'm sick of Christians. We got a Christian problem. In the comments,
[14:41.240 --> 14:44.840]  we're going to get this Christian Jones. I bet it's Muslims and they're saying kill
[14:44.840 --> 14:50.200]  me. And then we want to kill Jones. Yeah, let's kill him. Yeah, we're liberal. Let's
[14:50.200 --> 14:53.960]  kill him. It's his fault. The Muslims killed people. It's Christians, though. They're
[14:53.960 --> 15:00.960]  the bad ones. Well, don't worry. What's left of a Christian culture just got bombed yesterday.
[15:00.960 --> 15:05.400]  God, you're in a group of foaming at the mouth, middle patients. We have a real problem in
[15:05.400 --> 15:09.520]  this country and around the world. And I'm not afraid to call about the name radical
[15:09.520 --> 15:14.240]  Christian extremism. Well, let me give you statistics from your own UN, bud. They're
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.520]  at Media Matters. Christians are the number one persecuted group in the world, doubling
[15:19.520 --> 15:24.040]  everybody else. And that amount of attacks on Christians has doubled in the last decade.
[15:24.040 --> 15:28.360]  It's growing exponentially. And that's what Trump talked about. Now, let's go to Paul
[15:28.360 --> 15:36.960]  Joseph Watson from London, England to break this down. We have 22 dead, more than 50 injured.
[15:36.960 --> 15:40.320]  And the media is saying, why does happen? It's completely out of the blue. They tried
[15:40.320 --> 15:45.080]  to cover it up as an Islamic attack for 24 hours. It failed. Now the government of the
[15:45.080 --> 15:51.480]  UK has come out and said it is Islamic. The pitiful, slimy, disgusting, cowardly, out of
[15:51.480 --> 15:58.160]  control. ISIS people have taken credit. And the answer is bring more Islamists in. And
[15:58.160 --> 16:02.600]  I'll say this. I don't blame all the police, but the ones on top and the bureaucracy and
[16:02.600 --> 16:06.480]  the security services that just use these attacks to get more power, but never stop
[16:06.480 --> 16:11.360]  the jihadis, Paul. They're to blame as well. Paul, who's to blame for this?
[16:11.360 --> 16:18.600]  Alex, the people to blame are the political class who have ranked in matter of importance,
[16:18.600 --> 16:23.840]  tolerance above the basic function of government, which is protecting the lives of its people.
[16:23.840 --> 16:30.120]  They think it's now more important to rank tolerance above that. What is tolerance? Tolerance
[16:30.120 --> 16:35.320]  of Muslim rape gangs that abduct young girls and abuse them for years and years and years.
[16:35.320 --> 16:41.280]  And the authorities don't do anything about it because it's politically incorrect. That's
[16:41.280 --> 16:45.400]  tolerance, tolerance of Sharia law, tolerance of women being abused and harassed on the
[16:45.400 --> 16:50.240]  street. Tolerance is now more important than the basic right to life. You were talking
[16:50.240 --> 16:55.760]  about political correctness before, Alex. You know, with the San Bernardino killings,
[16:55.760 --> 17:00.120]  we saw the neighbors were getting suspicious. They were taken in these suspicious parcels
[17:00.120 --> 17:04.360]  before the attacks. They were meeting with suspicious people. There was an incident
[17:04.360 --> 17:08.960]  right before this bombing last night in Manchester. And an eyewitness has come out and talked
[17:08.960 --> 17:14.560]  about it. She saw what was obviously, although she didn't say it directly, a foreign individual,
[17:14.560 --> 17:18.800]  probably a Muslim individual looking nervous, looking suspicious, fidgeting with something
[17:18.800 --> 17:24.720]  in her bag, looking back to the area where the bomb went off. She reported this woman.
[17:24.720 --> 17:29.760]  It looked like it was possibly one of the accomplices. She reported her to the security.
[17:29.760 --> 17:34.600]  What did the security say? They said to the woman who was trying to report the suspicious
[17:34.600 --> 17:39.760]  activity, how would you like it if somebody said that you were being suspicious? So it
[17:39.760 --> 17:43.720]  was obviously, by the way, she was describing it because she said she couldn't speak English
[17:43.720 --> 17:49.400]  very well. It was obviously possibly some kind of accomplice to this attack. The security
[17:49.400 --> 17:53.280]  did nothing about it. They didn't kick her out. They didn't even talk to her. They just
[17:53.280 --> 17:57.560]  left her alone. So it looks like that could have happened again. Again, that's not confirmed.
[17:57.560 --> 18:04.160]  But in the aftermath of this, Alex, what do we see again? Liberals leftists more outraged
[18:04.160 --> 18:11.440]  about offensive tweets than mangled dead kids than kids with body parts missing. That's
[18:11.440 --> 18:17.920]  what they're more offended about. The Met Police in London has come out and said they're investigating
[18:17.920 --> 18:21.840]  not the ISIS terrorists, the hundreds of ISIS terrorists running around the country who have
[18:21.840 --> 18:26.400]  been let back in. No, no, no, no, no. They're investigating Katie Hopkins because she said
[18:26.400 --> 18:31.440]  something offensive on Twitter. They're actually doing this. This is what she said on Twitter.
[18:31.440 --> 18:36.080]  Western men, these are your wives, your daughters, your sons, stand up, rise up, demand action.
[18:36.080 --> 18:42.680]  Do not carry on as normal. That is hate speech and is now being investigated by the Metropolitan
[18:42.680 --> 18:48.040]  Police after it was reported to them by offended leftists on Twitter.
[18:48.040 --> 18:51.160]  That's right. And Connie Robinson's joining us. He's the guy that first reported over
[18:51.160 --> 18:55.400]  a decade ago. They were kidnapping and grooming young girls. Now it's come out in dozens and
[18:55.400 --> 19:00.680]  dozens of towns, thousands per town, sex slavery, killing the young girls, and the police will
[19:00.680 --> 19:04.720]  do nothing because it's politically incorrect to talk bad about a bunch of men with big
[19:04.720 --> 19:09.240]  beards grabbing 10 year old girls from the bus stops. I mean, this is just so over the
[19:09.240 --> 19:16.880]  top, the mass Stockholm syndrome that we're witnessing here, Paul, and it's Stockholm
[19:16.880 --> 19:22.680]  syndrome on steroids. The independent came out with a headline this morning, quote, there's
[19:22.680 --> 19:27.800]  only one way Britain should respond to a tax such as Manchester, that is by carrying on
[19:27.800 --> 19:33.160]  exactly as before. Just just carry on. Just forget about it. Just wait until it happens
[19:33.160 --> 19:38.000]  again and again and again and again. You know, Alex, how do the parents of dead kids just
[19:38.000 --> 19:44.680]  carry on exactly as before? How do the teenage girls who have been dismembered, how are they
[19:44.680 --> 19:50.520]  going to carry on with life just as it was before? No, that's not bravery to just carry
[19:50.520 --> 19:55.520]  on like nothing's happening. That's frigging cowardice. But it seems, Alex, we've made
[19:55.520 --> 20:01.080]  a choice as a society. Again, our leaders place hurt feelings. They rank that as being
[20:01.080 --> 20:06.280]  more important than the actual basic survival and safety of their citizens. Sure. This is
[20:06.280 --> 20:10.520]  this is croma based mind control. They know these attacks are coming. They know that the
[20:10.520 --> 20:14.360]  trend is are being targeted. They know the helpless population has been domesticated
[20:14.360 --> 20:19.520]  into this position. And they are testing to just see what you'll put up with, what you'll
[20:19.520 --> 20:25.040]  go along with. I mean, first it's have taxpayers pay for sex changes. Then it's oh, it's bad
[20:25.040 --> 20:29.040]  if you have a mother or father or if you're male or female now having a sex is bad now
[20:29.040 --> 20:33.800]  having your own identity is bad unless it's a liberal trendy identity because this isn't
[20:33.800 --> 20:38.720]  liberal or trendy. This is an assault on the West. They'll use Islam. They'll use pedophile
[20:38.720 --> 20:45.040]  groups. They'll use anybody they can to scramble civilization to make us so confused with learned
[20:45.040 --> 20:50.080]  helplessness that we will then submit. I'm going to play this clip. This is so surreal.
[20:50.080 --> 20:55.240]  This was happening as the bombs had just gone off. They're now saying probably two bombs.
[20:55.240 --> 21:00.320]  A coordinated effort. But again, who's behind it? Who helped them? The government who protected
[21:00.320 --> 21:05.640]  them? The liberals who went along with it? The trendies who helped import these groups
[21:05.640 --> 21:11.280]  who backed ISIS and Al Qaeda in the Arab Spring? European and the US government, the globalist
[21:11.280 --> 21:17.920]  are out live with radical Islam. Manchester Arena terror attack. No problems here message.
[21:17.920 --> 21:23.880]  This is Sky News announcer tries to calm the crowd. This is just guess a sky event exiting
[21:23.880 --> 21:29.320]  the arena, but goes a little too far. A little too far. It's like drink your Kool-Aid. Everything's
[21:29.320 --> 21:34.360]  fine. You'll be in heaven soon. Goes a little too far by claiming preemptively that there
[21:34.360 --> 21:40.220]  are no problems here and quote. We're glad you came out and had a good time tonight as
[21:40.220 --> 21:48.160]  if he were oblivious to the fact that someone just blew themselves up. So he's there announcing
[21:48.160 --> 21:54.980]  there at the Ariana Grande concert. Ariana Grande. It's so fun and nothing bad happened
[21:54.980 --> 21:59.840]  here tonight. Nothing went on. You had a great evening. Your steak was perfect. You know,
[21:59.840 --> 22:04.760]  like they say at restaurants, your wine was perfect. Your suicide bomb and flesh and guts
[22:04.760 --> 22:10.240]  and blood of teenagers was wonderful. You had a fabulous evening. People say, oh, this
[22:10.240 --> 22:15.440]  is Stockholm syndrome. This is mind control. This is Jim Jones Kool-Aid drills. It is.
[22:15.440 --> 22:20.760]  This is just one step more extreme of the media saying move along. No big deal. The answer
[22:20.760 --> 22:25.480]  is bring in more Muslims. Have our young girls wear a jib. That will make the Muslims
[22:25.480 --> 22:30.600]  not kill us. Let's submit to them. Let's let them bully us. Let's roll over. You know,
[22:30.600 --> 22:36.320]  we'll be bringing folks from some areas in the Middle East that are 5000 times plus more
[22:36.320 --> 22:41.240]  often to have birth defects or brain disorders from inbreeding. Let's bring in a bunch of
[22:41.240 --> 22:46.280]  inbred insane people and let them murder and kill us and kidnap our children and do everything
[22:46.280 --> 22:50.880]  because it's liberal and it's the right thing to do. Let's let the big brain bug Muslims
[22:50.880 --> 22:56.640]  bring in all of the little subgroups they're controlling and then own factories and facilities
[22:56.640 --> 23:02.200]  and have their little elves brain damage inbred elves in their working in their basically
[23:02.200 --> 23:08.360]  slave factories. I mean, this is an absolute total takeover and our elites are out to get
[23:08.360 --> 23:13.520]  us. Here is the mind control right after the bombing telling folks they all had a great
[23:13.520 --> 23:14.520]  evening.
[23:14.520 --> 23:24.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, please take your time. There's no need to bunch up. There's no problems
[23:24.520 --> 23:29.520]  here. Just take your time and keep exiting the building. There's no need to bunch up
[23:29.520 --> 23:34.520]  and ride on. Take your time. There's no problems here. Thank you for coming out there good
[23:34.520 --> 23:40.520]  times tonight. Everything is fine. Just take your time exiting the building. Thank you
[23:40.520 --> 23:41.520]  very much.
[23:41.520 --> 23:47.240]  Thanks for bringing your kids to the event. And no one's going to try to stop the Muslims
[23:47.240 --> 23:50.360]  coming in and blowing you up. And some will argue, well, they don't want, they don't want
[23:50.360 --> 23:54.160]  rioting. They don't want people stampeding and dying. You don't have to lie to them.
[23:54.160 --> 24:01.120]  You just say, please move orderly to the exits. I know it appears the event is over, whatever.
[24:01.120 --> 24:05.160]  But see, the government's bringing in the Muslims. It's bringing in the unvetted Muslims.
[24:05.160 --> 24:08.720]  It's bringing in the thousands of jihadis knowing this is going to happen. It's not
[24:08.720 --> 24:12.160]  like the media is saying, be calm. Everything's going to be okay. We're going to fix this
[24:12.160 --> 24:15.880]  problem. We're going to deport these people. No, no, they're just saying be calm. Everything's
[24:15.880 --> 24:20.480]  fine. Drink for Kool-Aid. You're going to be in heaven. Paul Watson.
[24:20.480 --> 24:24.440]  Well, Alex, the point is they're not just letting them in. And I'm going to do a big
[24:24.440 --> 24:30.200]  video expose about this as well. The NGO Boats. This is all George Soros funded. I'm going
[24:30.200 --> 24:35.680]  to name the organizations by name. They're going out like a taxi service to 12 miles
[24:35.680 --> 24:40.760]  off the coast of Libya from Italy, picking up these migrants, bringing them back to
[24:40.760 --> 24:47.320]  Italy. Half of them just go missing while ISIS is literally paying their fee to pay
[24:47.320 --> 24:53.560]  the people smugglers if they join ISIS. And ISIS said, ISIS said three years ago, quote,
[24:53.560 --> 24:57.840]  we're going to have a migrant flood to flood you with our jihadists and bring Europe down.
[24:57.840 --> 25:02.720]  The UN says, yes, opens it up, advertises it. It's a master plan. Paul, they've admitted
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.880]  it. What is the master plan bringing in the sleeper cell army of 5 million plus people,
[25:07.880 --> 25:14.520]  80% military aged men? What are they planning? Well, on a purely selfish level, again, the
[25:14.520 --> 25:18.600]  political elite, they don't have to live amongst this. They get private chauffeurs to every
[25:18.600 --> 25:23.200]  single event. They live in their ivory towers. They don't have to use public transport. They
[25:23.200 --> 25:28.200]  don't have to use commercial airlines. You know, they're protected from this. We're not.
[25:28.200 --> 25:32.880]  So they don't really have to live in the chaos that they create. Of course, politically,
[25:32.880 --> 25:38.000]  bringing in huge numbers of people, you can do a map where in Britain, you compare the
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.520]  areas where the Muslim ghettos are versus who they vote for. It's always left wing political
[25:43.520 --> 25:49.160]  parties who will give them welfare and benefits, same in any other European country. So that's
[25:49.160 --> 25:53.080]  the motive. They want huge voting blocks. They want to literally destroy society. They
[25:53.080 --> 25:59.720]  don't value or cherish Western values anymore. They've replaced them with this horrific tolerance
[25:59.720 --> 26:03.800]  idea, which is clearly not working for us, but they don't care because they're in their
[26:03.800 --> 26:11.200]  ivory towers. But this suicide bomber, Alex, Libyan refugee parents was born in Manchester.
[26:11.200 --> 26:17.520]  So we gave his parents refuge in the United Kingdom. They gave us a suicide bomber. Oh,
[26:17.520 --> 26:23.160]  but this guy was born here. So Alex, he's one of the integrated ones. He's another example
[26:23.160 --> 26:29.080]  of how multiculturalism has worked so well. Born in this country, blows himself up along
[26:29.080 --> 26:35.960]  with 22, 23 other people. But don't worry, Alex, because CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted out
[26:35.960 --> 26:41.280]  an image of the Union Jack. So everything's going to be okay now. And that's what annoys
[26:41.280 --> 26:46.360]  me the most is the concern signaling. Well, that's what they do. Exactly. Virtue signaling.
[26:46.360 --> 26:50.720]  They push for the end of the Union Jack. They try to say, don't fly it. It's racist. First
[26:50.720 --> 26:57.680]  they ban what the King George flag and a bunch of others. And so then they move on. But then
[26:57.680 --> 27:01.840]  when there's a tragic event, oh, here's your flag. While the globalists are busy killing
[27:01.840 --> 27:07.440]  the culture, killing the identity, but then they kind of give you as a body bag, a Union
[27:07.440 --> 27:09.640]  Jack colored body bag.
[27:09.640 --> 27:14.360]  Notice though, Alex, he didn't tweet out a Russian flag last month when all those people
[27:14.360 --> 27:19.600]  got massacred in the St. Petersburg subway. Did he? Oh, no, it's a selective outrage.
[27:19.600 --> 27:26.080]  Also again, not all Muslims, the main concern immediately after 22 people, mostly teenage
[27:26.080 --> 27:30.840]  girls have been slaughtered and dismembered is not what do we do to stop this from happening
[27:30.840 --> 27:37.080]  over and over again. It's, oh, no, somebody might be mean to Muslims. Don't be an Islamophobe.
[27:37.080 --> 27:41.920]  That's the main concern. No, it's not the main concern. It shouldn't be. And by the
[27:41.920 --> 27:46.320]  way, when Dylan roof went in, when scumbag Dylan roof went in and shot, you know, nine
[27:46.320 --> 27:51.640]  poor black people because he was a brainwashed idiot. The media for months. It was the end
[27:51.640 --> 27:55.840]  of the world. America's evil. All conservatives are racist. All whites are racist. You've
[27:55.840 --> 28:00.320]  got a brown Muslim guy going and blowing up mainly a bunch of little white girls are folks
[28:00.320 --> 28:06.080]  going to call this racial because a big component of Islam is anti white, anti West. Let's just
[28:06.080 --> 28:12.880]  get that out there. Well, here's a tweet. Alex and it's exemplifies this says, and this
[28:12.880 --> 28:18.880]  literally got like 50, 60,000 retweets. Muslims are to blame when in reality Muslim taxi drivers
[28:18.880 --> 28:25.440]  are offering free lift. Okay. So because some Muslim taxi drivers are offering free rides,
[28:25.440 --> 28:29.800]  that means there's not a problem with Islam and violence. No, it doesn't work like that.
[28:29.800 --> 28:35.080]  But that is the level of idiocy we're dealing with. That is literally the most tweeted thing
[28:35.080 --> 28:40.160]  today on Twitter. That's what we're dealing with. Again, empty platitudes. Really, you
[28:40.160 --> 28:44.760]  know, it's funny. The last few times I was in the UK, it was almost all Muslim taxi drivers.
[28:44.760 --> 28:49.320]  They would shake me down for double the rate to take me to my hotel laughing at me until
[28:49.320 --> 28:53.720]  I would run into a British taxi driver and they would let me in and actually only charge
[28:53.720 --> 28:58.240]  me the regular rate and apologize to me and say, you know, this is London stand now,
[28:58.240 --> 29:06.800]  yeah, but it's again, look at the stats. Okay, it's not a tiny fringe. 34% of British Muslims
[29:06.800 --> 29:12.800]  say they would not inform police if they knew someone was getting involved with ISIS. 34%
[29:12.800 --> 29:18.760]  sorry, only 34% would inform. So in fact, the vast majority of British Muslims would
[29:18.760 --> 29:25.120]  not tell police if someone they knew was joining ISIS. We saw the same thing in Belgium after
[29:25.120 --> 29:29.680]  Paris, but it's not the Muslims fault. It's conservatives, nationalist libertarians. It's
[29:29.680 --> 29:35.040]  my fault, Paul. Media Matters is saying it's my fault. I'm a bad fact. I don't like the
[29:35.040 --> 29:39.640]  children that died total lie. I'm saying the trendies in the UK that say open the borders
[29:39.640 --> 29:44.040]  up, bring this in there to blame. And you know, that stadium had adults and others that
[29:44.040 --> 29:48.280]  were in it that totally are cuckold and are pushing for this. The left has to embrace
[29:48.280 --> 29:56.720]  it. We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:56.720 --> 30:06.720]  USAA, the financial services company, which caters to military members and their families
[30:06.720 --> 30:12.600]  is the latest company to pull their advertising from Sean Hannity show following a string
[30:12.600 --> 30:18.240]  of ad cancellations from numerous companies after the Fox News host started focusing on
[30:18.240 --> 30:25.320]  murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich and his reported ties to WikiLeaks. Hannity then accused liberal
[30:25.320 --> 30:32.120]  lobbying organization Media Matters of America of liberal fascism, claiming they were mounting
[30:32.120 --> 30:38.320]  a targeted campaign against him after they released a list of companies that advertised
[30:38.320 --> 30:45.240]  during Hannity show. Prominent Twitter icon Mark Dice then went to Twitter and said, USAA,
[30:45.240 --> 30:51.240]  you're boycotting Hannity to please a few liberal trolls. So now we're going to boycott
[30:51.240 --> 30:57.520]  your company because we think you're garbage. This is Millie Weaver reporting for infowars.com.
[30:57.520 --> 31:01.400]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:01.400 --> 31:06.000]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates
[31:06.000 --> 31:11.760]  of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right
[31:11.760 --> 31:16.760]  here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[31:16.760 --> 31:22.080]  have now developed Alexa pure breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself,
[31:22.080 --> 31:27.120]  your coworkers, your family, your children to the best job you can to purify your air.
[31:27.120 --> 31:32.120]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:32.120 --> 31:38.000]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure
[31:38.000 --> 31:43.360]  breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square
[31:43.360 --> 31:47.320]  feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house
[31:47.320 --> 31:52.200]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this
[31:52.200 --> 31:54.160]  system is so revolutionary today.
[31:54.160 --> 32:11.600]  After being sold out for months, our best selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[32:11.600 --> 32:14.600]  in stock. Research across the board is clear. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter
[32:14.600 --> 32:15.600]  your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks. That's why the last
[32:15.600 --> 32:16.600]  surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact
[32:16.600 --> 32:20.600]  on your entire body. Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula
[32:20.600 --> 32:25.880]  that's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride. Super blue contains
[32:25.880 --> 32:31.200]  natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate
[32:31.200 --> 32:35.880]  bad breath. Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include
[32:35.880 --> 32:41.240]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more due to requests from listeners who
[32:41.240 --> 32:44.880]  found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children. We have created
[32:44.880 --> 32:48.880]  the new bubblegum flavored super blue that is spearmint free. Learn more about the new
[32:48.880 --> 32:54.240]  bubblegum flavored super blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com and support the info
[32:54.240 --> 33:20.240]  war while you support healthy gums and teeth. If you are receiving this transmission, you
[33:20.240 --> 33:43.240]  are the resistance.
[33:43.240 --> 33:47.360]  Families and many young people were out to enjoy a concert at the Manchester arena and
[33:47.360 --> 33:53.280]  have very sadly lost their lives. Our thoughts are with those 22 victims that we now know
[33:53.280 --> 33:59.760]  have died, the 59 people who have been injured and their loved ones. We continue to do all
[33:59.760 --> 34:06.760]  we can to support them and they are being treated at 8 hospitals across Greater Manchester.
[34:06.760 --> 34:11.680]  We have been treating this as a terrorist incident and we believe at this stage the
[34:11.680 --> 34:18.080]  attack last night was conducted by one man. The priority is to establish whether he was
[34:18.080 --> 34:25.880]  acting alone or as part of a network. The attacker I can confirm died at the arena.
[34:25.880 --> 34:31.640]  We believe the attacker was carrying an improvised explosive device which he detonated causing
[34:31.640 --> 34:38.920]  this atrocity. We would ask people not to speculate on his details or share names. This
[34:38.920 --> 34:44.920]  is a complex and wide-ranging investigation. Our priority is to work with the National
[34:44.920 --> 34:51.240]  Cancer Terrorist Policing Network and UK Intelligence Services to establish more details about the
[34:51.240 --> 34:54.520]  individual who carried out this attack.
[34:54.520 --> 34:58.240]  They are also saying we don't know who helped him. How did this happen? The government of
[34:58.240 --> 35:02.880]  the UK opened the borders up by partisan. They brought these people in. They demonized
[35:02.880 --> 35:07.760]  anybody that spoke out against it or stood up. They know exactly what they are doing.
[35:07.760 --> 35:12.480]  They know exactly what they have been engaged in. I am not saying the individual police
[35:12.480 --> 35:17.160]  officers are to blame but basically everyone in the UK, everyone in the US, everyone in
[35:17.160 --> 35:20.720]  Europe, I don't care what color you are or where you came from. If you are not an Islamic
[35:20.720 --> 35:26.400]  extremist, an Islamic orthodox attacker, we all are to blame for not standing up against
[35:26.400 --> 35:32.640]  the arrogance of the Islamist leaders and their puppets like the new French president
[35:32.640 --> 35:37.240]  who has said get used to Islamic terror. It is the new way of life. Just get used to it.
[35:37.240 --> 35:40.000]  We are not going to call it Islamic terror when it happens. We are just going to call
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.000]  it terror.
[35:41.000 --> 35:47.960]  Well, here he is, the mayor of London stand, Sadiq Khan, who is starting to ban images
[35:47.960 --> 35:53.120]  of women in bikinis in public signage. He is bringing in Sharia law. Here he is running
[35:53.120 --> 35:57.680]  his arrogant mouth. He says he doesn't care if the UK blocks new Muslims flooding in.
[35:57.680 --> 36:02.680]  He will bring them into London itself. He will set up a safe zone. He will set up a sanctuary
[36:02.680 --> 36:07.480]  city for the loving Islamists that are all fleeing their own God forsaken countries where
[36:07.480 --> 36:14.440]  they are killing each other and having on average six kids. It is like sticking your
[36:14.440 --> 36:18.280]  arm into a bunch of piranhas with blood dripping off your hand. They are going to chew your
[36:18.280 --> 36:19.280]  arm off.
[36:19.280 --> 36:24.440]  I am sorry, let's go to this arrogant slime bag who just can't believe how Stockholm syndromeed
[36:24.440 --> 36:31.080]  the West is and now he is just arrogantly rolling everyone, smiling with a big fat smile.
[36:31.080 --> 36:37.080]  Care is not going to stop. And it's just the way it is. Here he is.
[36:37.080 --> 36:44.080]  The mayor of New York, his office, our people have been spoken to, the police here. The
[36:44.080 --> 36:50.360]  advice we've received is 29 people have been injured. They were my thoughts and prayers.
[36:50.360 --> 36:53.840]  The advice we've received from the police service here and from the mayor's office is
[36:53.840 --> 36:58.840]  to carry on business as usual. I'm not going to speculate as to who was responsible. I'm
[36:58.840 --> 37:04.280]  not going to speculate as to how the police in New York should react. What I do know is
[37:04.280 --> 37:08.280]  part and parcel of living in a great global city is you've got to be prepared for these
[37:08.280 --> 37:12.160]  things. You've got to be vigilant. You've got to support the police doing an incredibly
[37:12.160 --> 37:16.840]  hard job. You've got to support the security services. And I think speculating when you
[37:16.840 --> 37:19.760]  don't know the facts is un...
[37:19.760 --> 37:24.800]  Now, Macron went even further. We've put the transcript of that up on screen. We've got
[37:24.800 --> 37:29.200]  it in French. And he just said, this is the way it is. And by the way, his latest statements
[37:29.200 --> 37:34.080]  are, we shouldn't worry about being France. We're now the EU. Well, what's the EU? It's
[37:34.080 --> 37:39.800]  now imploding the borders of Europe. It gets rid of your internal borders, opens the external
[37:39.800 --> 37:43.200]  contiguous border, and then brings in the Islamists.
[37:43.200 --> 37:49.160]  And the Green Party and everybody announces, yes, Islam is the future. Submit to it. Give
[37:49.160 --> 37:55.600]  your daughters to it. You listen to this, and it's the most bizarre, over-the-top signals
[37:55.600 --> 38:01.960]  of conquest I've ever seen. And our own elites are celebrating it. So joining us is Tommy
[38:01.960 --> 38:08.880]  Robinson, the rebelmedia.com, Tommy Robinson.co.uk. He's pointed out that they're at war. The
[38:08.880 --> 38:13.040]  government knows they're at war. And the government is basically at war against the
[38:13.040 --> 38:19.300]  people with Islam, using Islam to take the average Brit's right, whether you're a Sikh
[38:19.300 --> 38:22.560]  Brit, or a Christian Brit, or an atheist Brit, whether you're white, or whether you're
[38:22.560 --> 38:27.640]  a black African from, you know, South Africa that happens to be a Christian. You don't
[38:27.640 --> 38:32.680]  have any rights. Only the loving Muslims do. They're the God. How did they get in this
[38:32.680 --> 38:38.640]  position? And what do you make of 22 dead, mainly teenage girls, and the media trying
[38:38.640 --> 38:40.640]  to spin this and saying it's non-Islamic?
[38:40.640 --> 38:46.720]  Alex, I've been in Manchester all day. I've listened to all the mainstream media. I've
[38:46.720 --> 38:52.120]  not heard one of them mention the word Islam, not one of them. I think I've started looking
[38:52.120 --> 38:58.440]  then into Islam in Manchester. I've traveled to an extremist mosque. When I was standing
[38:58.440 --> 39:03.760]  at that position outside that mosque, within a two mile radius of where I was, there have
[39:03.760 --> 39:10.600]  been 16 Muslims convicted or killed in terrorism. One last year who drove a suicide truck into
[39:10.600 --> 39:18.280]  people in Iraq. We had another Muslim called Burgos who murdered a police officer in Manchester.
[39:18.280 --> 39:23.960]  He comes to the country three years prior in the back of a van as a refugee. He was actually
[39:23.960 --> 39:29.360]  in prison. When I was in prison in 2012, he was in control of the prison. So all these
[39:29.360 --> 39:33.640]  solutions, we need to lock them up and send them to prison. Burgos is living a complete
[39:33.640 --> 39:38.480]  Halal life after killing a police officer. He is converting and radicalising more people.
[39:38.480 --> 39:43.840]  He certainly is not learning any lesson. He's adding to our problems. And exactly what you've
[39:43.840 --> 39:50.080]  been saying is our political leaders are working with them. Tonight at six o'clock in Manchester,
[39:50.080 --> 39:57.480]  there is a peace vigil being held by the Mayor Burnham. He's a Labour MP called Burnham.
[39:57.480 --> 40:04.520]  Now he last year shared a platform and a stage with an Islamic group called Men. This is an
[40:04.520 --> 40:10.200]  Islamic radical group. Another MP in this area who is the Justice Secretary for the
[40:10.200 --> 40:17.720]  Labour Party, she received £5,000 cash given to her for her campaign by an Islamic radical
[40:17.720 --> 40:24.120]  group in this area. That Labour Party are in bed. So we're in bed with the radicals.
[40:24.120 --> 40:29.040]  When we're seeing what right now, the people on our TV who are telling us, we will get
[40:29.040 --> 40:34.720]  through this, we will beat this, are the people working hand in hand with the radical Islamic
[40:34.720 --> 40:40.520]  group. The people who are facilitating our daughters to be killed and raped in order
[40:40.520 --> 40:44.840]  for vote bank politics to regain power with the Labour Party. Then the people telling
[40:44.840 --> 40:49.680]  us it will all be alright. As soon as I started digging, it took me ten minutes in Manchester
[40:49.680 --> 40:50.680]  to find the link.
[40:50.680 --> 40:53.960]  Well, we all know what it's going to take. It's going to take the politicians that are
[40:53.960 --> 41:01.160]  aiding and abetting a foreign cancerous political cult to be brought to justice. One way or
[41:01.160 --> 41:04.920]  another, the politicians that are letting these little girls get blown up and murdered
[41:04.920 --> 41:08.720]  and all the rest of it, they're the ones that are aiding and abetting. They're just as guilty
[41:08.720 --> 41:12.880]  as the jihadi that blew himself up. And I'm sorry, you started asking the question, I'm
[41:12.880 --> 41:16.000]  asking you this again, when do you think people in the UK are going to start taking things
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.400]  into their own hands?
[41:17.400 --> 41:23.800]  Alex, I keep asking myself, when I've watched what's happened here, what is it going to
[41:23.800 --> 41:31.800]  take? What is it going to take before Englishmen? It becomes an embarrassing situation into
[41:31.800 --> 41:37.560]  the world to see how weak we have become. I look now, I'm 20 miles from a town called
[41:37.560 --> 41:41.920]  Rocksdale, where there's been a programme where an entire generation of youth were gang
[41:41.920 --> 41:47.000]  raped and tortured by Muslim men. Those Muslim men are now out of prison after less than
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.240]  three or four years, and they're walking around the town of Rocksdale where the girls
[41:51.240 --> 41:56.680]  are that they rape. What has happened to us as a race? What has happened to us as a country
[41:56.680 --> 42:03.280]  that we're allowing this such systematic abuses of our people? We're allowing now a concert
[42:03.280 --> 42:09.000]  now where our daughters are being massacred and maimed, and this is all being facilitated
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.880]  and no one is doing anything. So again, I can't answer your question, Alex, because I ask
[42:13.880 --> 42:18.920]  myself every time when leaving me was beheaded, I said, this has to be it. When this happened
[42:18.920 --> 42:22.160]  earlier and I'm watching it and I'm seeing daughters and young girls and eight year old
[42:22.160 --> 42:29.640]  girl has gone 22 young British people are dead. What is it going to take? What is it
[42:29.640 --> 42:34.560]  going to take? We've got the same response, but there's a peace vigil in half hour, a
[42:34.560 --> 42:37.840]  peace vigil. What is that peace vigil going to do?
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.360]  All the peace vigil is, is a giant white flag begging these folks to kill more. And notice
[42:42.360 --> 42:46.360]  when we're trying to take out non radical Islam groups in Syria, and they have this
[42:46.360 --> 42:50.280]  clear fake false flag chemical attack. They've been caught doing it before. They show the
[42:50.280 --> 42:54.560]  kids gulping and dying for air. But every time there's a suicide truck or a shooting
[42:54.560 --> 42:58.760]  or a bombing, they blur out the people. They won't show the dead girls. They won't show
[42:58.760 --> 43:04.360]  the dead bodies. It's going to take showing on the news, the Islamists is taking credit,
[43:04.360 --> 43:07.080]  bragging how they're going to kill your sons and daughters, bragging how they're going
[43:07.080 --> 43:10.680]  to kill your police, bragging how they're going to do all this and then showing the
[43:10.680 --> 43:16.320]  dead girls are dying girls flopping around with their guts hanging out begging for mommy.
[43:16.320 --> 43:21.720]  It's going to take showing that. What did the black in the background theater
[43:21.720 --> 43:26.760]  where people's genitals were cut off and fed to them where young girls were raped with
[43:26.760 --> 43:33.040]  knife. They were raped with knives. They were tortured. That changed nothing in front.
[43:33.040 --> 43:37.640]  In fact, they've surrendered even further since then. Why sit and look at this situation
[43:37.640 --> 43:45.840]  now and ask, what's going to happen? Probably nothing. Unfortunately, and that's heartbreaking.
[43:45.840 --> 43:51.760]  And then we get, we all get, we all get told Alex, we get told who gets told you get told,
[43:51.760 --> 43:57.000]  we get told that we're rejoicing somehow in this, rejoicing something we've tried to prevent.
[43:57.000 --> 44:02.040]  We get told that we're pushing our agenda. Our only agenda is to stop this, to stop and
[44:02.040 --> 44:07.720]  prevent it happening to more children, to more women, to more British people. And somehow
[44:07.720 --> 44:12.280]  the same people who accused us of that and the same people saying we need to invite more
[44:12.280 --> 44:17.720]  and work for it. It's our fault. We need to accept this law more. I'm just, I'm sick
[44:17.720 --> 44:23.640]  to death of it. And I can't believe English men. I keep asking, what is it going to take
[44:23.640 --> 44:28.160]  for you to get up? The whole country should be bought to a standstill by now. Every single
[44:28.160 --> 44:32.520]  city in this country should be gridlocked with men and family then coming out with the
[44:32.520 --> 44:37.120]  bond and be done. What is it going to take? And this is so...
[44:37.120 --> 44:42.400]  Hello, for folks that don't know your history, you were a good guy, family guy, or a family
[44:42.400 --> 44:45.520]  guy, put in prison for just having peaceful protest. You've been attacked literally hundreds
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.720]  of times, more than 50 times I've seen on video. They don't let you march anywhere in
[44:49.720 --> 44:56.200]  the country with the British flag because that's a sign of hate in your own country.
[44:56.200 --> 44:59.520]  We now have the Ninth Circuit Band of the American Flag here on the East Coast saying
[44:59.520 --> 45:03.200]  it's a sign of hate. So tell us about what happened a few weeks ago because we're going
[45:03.200 --> 45:06.640]  to play this video for TV and radio listeners just to give folks an idea of what it's like
[45:06.640 --> 45:12.560]  for you when you discovered what a local member of government was up to, you went to his offices
[45:12.560 --> 45:18.880]  and what happened. So a local Labour Muslim councillor, when
[45:18.880 --> 45:24.880]  these men, a gang of men, nine men, they had raped Fourth Gate young English girls, 48.
[45:24.880 --> 45:31.480]  When they were taken to court and prosecuted, the ex-Muslim mayor and the Labour councillor
[45:31.480 --> 45:36.920]  went to court and gave them references to say what great men they were. What great men
[45:36.920 --> 45:43.080]  they are. The councillor was also responsible for getting them their taxi licence that they
[45:43.080 --> 45:47.360]  used to traffic the young English girls in whilst they were torturing and raping them.
[45:47.360 --> 45:53.120]  I went to see the councillor to ask him questions of how he's still in power. He's actually
[45:53.120 --> 45:58.400]  been promoted, Alex. He's been promoted since this. I went there and I was met by gangs
[45:58.400 --> 46:03.920]  of violent gangs of Muslims who ran me off the road, who attacked me to prevent me, to
[46:03.920 --> 46:10.400]  prevent me talking to him. But again, the message we get then is, I will find that councillor.
[46:10.400 --> 46:15.120]  This week I will find him. We will not let it rest because although I keep saying what
[46:15.120 --> 46:20.520]  will it take, I have seen something lit in the last three months when I meet every English
[46:20.520 --> 46:24.800]  man, they're buzzing for it. And they're saying, I can see the support.
[46:24.800 --> 46:28.480]  I'll say this, nobody should look for a fight, but these people are looking for one. People
[46:28.480 --> 46:32.480]  need to start getting as good as they give. People need to start getting a little better.
[46:32.480 --> 46:33.480]  You know what?
[46:33.480 --> 46:40.440]  There has to become a... The worrying thing is that the government need to listen to is
[46:40.440 --> 46:47.040]  that as the point is going to come, when if you don't protect us, then English men will.
[46:47.040 --> 46:51.160]  English men will because they will have to. I can't understand. Well, I'm looking at Manchester
[46:51.160 --> 46:57.400]  now. From my hometown of Luton, when our soldiers were attacked, we get birth to the United
[46:57.400 --> 47:01.280]  People of Luton, which then become the English Defence League, which the whole world heard
[47:01.280 --> 47:06.520]  about. I look at what's happening in Rochdale and I bang my head and ask, where are the men?
[47:06.520 --> 47:10.680]  Where are the English men? I want to know where the English men are in Manchester. Where is
[47:10.680 --> 47:15.160]  the reactions of what they have just done? Where is the reaction because it took me 10
[47:15.160 --> 47:19.200]  minutes to find the mosque? It took me 10 minutes to find where they are? It took me 10 minutes
[47:19.200 --> 47:23.520]  to find the men that have radicalised and promoted this ideology. And they're walking
[47:23.520 --> 47:28.240]  around this city now. But that is it. And it shouldn't have to take that. But at some
[47:28.240 --> 47:32.600]  point, a breaking point is going to come. And when that point does come, it's not going
[47:32.600 --> 47:36.600]  to be good for Islam. It's not going to be good for the decent Muslims. And that's what
[47:36.600 --> 47:40.080]  they need to understand. Get your house in order before you leave it upon the British
[47:40.080 --> 47:42.080]  public to get it in order.
[47:42.080 --> 47:46.320]  I think this political correctness is going to trigger things down the road with the Middle
[47:46.320 --> 47:49.920]  East because it's turned into a glass parking lot. And I don't even want to see that happen.
[47:49.920 --> 47:54.560]  I didn't want the clash of civilisations. But I just can see now that our elites of
[47:54.560 --> 47:59.080]  ally with Islam as their foot soldiers, it's dangerous, it's disgusting. I want to play
[47:59.080 --> 48:03.480]  a clip of you just a few weeks ago being attacked, run off the road and attacked by a bunch of
[48:03.480 --> 48:09.400]  out of control, airing at thugs because you dared try to go do an interview. Here it is.
[48:09.400 --> 48:13.600]  We're in Rochdale. We're in Rochdale to see Councillor Hussein. He's a Labour Councillor.
[48:13.600 --> 48:17.200]  You've all watched a documentary for three girls which shows the rape and prostitution
[48:17.200 --> 48:23.080]  of a generation of kids in Rochdale by Muslim gangs. Councillor Hussein went to court to
[48:23.080 --> 48:27.760]  defend and give a character reference for one of those men who is now convicted in prison
[48:27.760 --> 48:32.840]  as part of a gang who raped 98 young English kids. He's still part of the Labour Party.
[48:32.840 --> 48:37.480]  We went there to ask him and to tell him he has to resign. And respect to the victims.
[48:37.480 --> 48:41.560]  He has to resign. He cannot be involved in British politics. When we got there to see
[48:41.560 --> 48:45.800]  Councillor Hussein, there were cars waiting. Straight away they tried to block the road.
[48:45.800 --> 48:48.400]  There were four cars. They tried to block the road. Unfortunately our camera wasn't
[48:48.400 --> 48:51.840]  even rolling because we hadn't even got out of the car. So they tried to block the road.
[48:51.840 --> 48:55.720]  I had to go up on the pavement to get away. Then you'll see in the footage you'll see
[48:55.720 --> 48:59.400]  that's where it starts, where I pull up a car pulls up next to me and then I ask him
[48:59.400 --> 49:02.280]  why are you trying to block the road? Why are you trying to block us in? Why are you
[49:02.280 --> 49:06.760]  jumping out of cars? At that point you'll see our car window was smashed. I then drove
[49:06.760 --> 49:12.200]  on. You'll see another young Muslim try and punch through the window. And then we've
[49:12.200 --> 49:16.600]  been proceeding in a bit of a car chase with some cars full of Muslims. That's pretty much
[49:16.600 --> 49:22.000]  it. And then there was a little bit of ramming on the road as well. So this doesn't change
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.640]  anything. Councillor Hussein, if you think that you can get your street gangs, and this
[49:26.640 --> 49:31.920]  is the worrying thing for me, is that you have street level gangs who are drug dealers
[49:31.920 --> 49:35.800]  and who are pimping and prostituting young English girls and then you have Labour representatives
[49:35.800 --> 49:39.920]  going to court. The X-Men. Let's stop right there. We're going to go to break. The full
[49:39.920 --> 49:44.280]  video is up on infowars.com. And we covered it just last week. We're going to go to break
[49:44.280 --> 49:49.480]  and come back and look at some of the facts of what just happened and the different numbers.
[49:49.480 --> 49:55.240]  Five million military aged men have been brought in. It's like six, seven million refugees
[49:55.240 --> 50:01.280]  total. Five million in the last three, four years. 80% military aged men, thousands and
[50:01.280 --> 50:06.720]  thousands every month coming in that they admit or pull admits are ISIS, are Al-Qaeda,
[50:06.720 --> 50:10.560]  and they're letting them back in. And Sweden and Belgium in places, you can pull up the
[50:10.560 --> 50:18.040]  news, they have government funding and welfare for them to, quote, help them. They have PTSD
[50:18.040 --> 50:26.120]  like they're soldiers of Sweden or soldiers of Denmark or soldiers of Belgium. And they
[50:26.120 --> 50:31.680]  bring them in and actually pay for them and put them on welfare. I mean, this is the craziest
[50:31.680 --> 50:35.520]  thing. Also, when we come back, I'm going to do a brief plug here because we fund this
[50:35.520 --> 50:40.920]  operation by the products we sell at infowarsstore.com. And we have been sold out of a bunch of
[50:40.920 --> 50:46.200]  our best selling products for months, like Super Metal Vitality X2 for a few weeks and
[50:46.200 --> 50:50.320]  other products. And those are our main funders. So it's been hurting us to not have those.

[54:20.040 --> 54:28.200]  You know, I didn't even know. Let's watch up on screen for TV viewers. Infowars.com.
[54:28.200 --> 54:33.240]  Paul Revere of the UK. Everything you said turned out to be true. Giant child kidnapping
[54:33.240 --> 54:39.360]  rings per town. Hundreds of missing kids. Hundreds of dead. Nationwide. Thousands missing.
[54:39.360 --> 54:43.360]  It all came out in court. He got proven. He was put in prison. They should make a movie
[54:43.360 --> 54:48.120]  about this guy. The persecution, how they called him racist. None of it was true. He was exposed
[54:48.120 --> 54:52.200]  to people that were racist. And now, I didn't even know that he was late even coming on
[54:52.200 --> 54:57.720]  with us. He's marching to the vigil that the politicians involved working with the Muslims
[54:57.720 --> 55:02.800]  are holding the vigil. And then his screen just went dead. I was going to see if we could
[55:02.800 --> 55:10.520]  get him back on as he goes to the vigil. But we just lost him. Wow. That's how fast stuff
[55:10.520 --> 55:13.400]  is moving here. We called Tommy and said, could you come on? He goes, yes, I can come
[55:13.400 --> 55:16.520]  on. And then during the break he goes, I got to go. The vigil is in five minutes. It's
[55:16.520 --> 55:20.800]  starting now, but I'm only two blocks away. And then he starts walking up to the vigil
[55:20.800 --> 55:31.720]  right as the feed cut. So this is real TV folks, real radio. Wow. That guy is amazing.
[55:31.720 --> 55:35.280]  I'll be honest. I used to see his stuff 10 years ago and go, oh, look at that racist
[55:35.280 --> 55:39.800]  or whatever. This is the media said it. That's how weak minded even I am folks. They lie
[55:39.800 --> 55:45.280]  about everybody. If there was a group of people in Mexico that had come from some other country
[55:45.280 --> 55:50.480]  raping and murdering, if they were white people, I'd say kill them. Or if they were blue people,
[55:50.480 --> 55:54.200]  you know? I mean, at a certain point, you don't care what color you are, when you're
[55:54.200 --> 55:58.200]  being killed and overrun, you have a right to stand up against it. And this is Islamic
[55:58.200 --> 56:03.200]  and they prey on women and I'm tired of it. We got his feedback. I've got to do this or

[56:47.640 --> 56:53.720]  to 10 to one mouthwash. It's all there. Deodorant, you name it. Okay, let's go to Manchester.
[56:53.720 --> 56:58.720]  We're reporting from the ground is Tommy Robinson. Tommy, wow, tell us what you're doing, where
[56:58.720 --> 56:59.720]  you're going.
[56:59.720 --> 57:04.960]  Well, we're walking through the city and we was here today during the day you'll be able
[57:04.960 --> 57:10.600]  to see the video has gone up on rebel where there was there was there was some scares
[57:10.600 --> 57:14.280]  everywhere. People were running through the shopping centers. Even now, I think if a bloom
[57:14.280 --> 57:19.200]  went off, the whole city would run from fear. And there's a vigil. So organized by Andy
[57:19.200 --> 57:25.720]  Burnham, who is the MP who is working with the Muslim extremist group who shares a platform
[57:25.720 --> 57:29.680]  with them. He's organizing the vigil. He's now the mayor of Greater Manchester. He's
[57:29.680 --> 57:34.840]  in charge of the whole police force. So he's organized a vigil for people to come together.
[57:34.840 --> 57:39.520]  This is one of the vigils which you see across. And so he can be the hero. He can mold a piece.
[57:39.520 --> 57:44.840]  Let's run up white flags. Let me be your boss. Just lay down. Let us let us put the handcuffs
[57:44.840 --> 57:50.040]  on. Get in the yellow Volkswagen. Let us get you in the basement. Go ahead.
[57:50.040 --> 57:54.760]  That's it. That's it. And that's what I didn't even know this. I've only just started research
[57:54.760 --> 58:00.600]  in Manchester since I got up here this morning. And again, just I've only had to scratch beneath
[58:00.600 --> 58:05.240]  the surface to be 10 minutes to find things out. 10 minutes to find things out. But I
[58:05.240 --> 58:10.520]  believe now this is one of these vigils where it doesn't do anything, does it? I understand
[58:10.520 --> 58:14.560]  the feeling of coming together. It's not going to. But it makes the people that allowed
[58:14.560 --> 58:17.360]  it to happen look like they care about everybody on the conciliators.
[58:17.360 --> 58:20.840]  Oh, they're the people standing up there. They're the people that are going to be standing
[58:20.840 --> 58:25.000]  up there telling us how we'll come through this. We'll stop this while sharing a platform
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.720]  and a piece in the group who are radicalizing the people in these communities. Tommy, how
[58:28.720 --> 58:32.600]  far away are you from the vigil? I have no idea about it.
[58:32.600 --> 58:40.320]  I thought you were pretty close. Hold on. We're going to come right back in 70 seconds.

[1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:09.240]  From the front lines, Tommy Robinson in Manchester side of the terror bombing last night. From
[1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:15.220]  the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. And you've got to look long and
[1:00:15.220 --> 1:00:19.720]  hard to hear him saying it's Islamic, but it is they've taken credit. Tommy Robinson,
[1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:23.280]  this is a short segment long segment coming up. He's about three minutes away from the
[1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:27.400]  vigil being held by the very local leaders, reportedly, that have been working with radical
[1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:32.080]  Islam, protecting the mosque, protecting the people coming back as ISIS fighters. That's
[1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:37.280]  mainstream UK news. This is incredible. And Tommy Robinson, feel free to take over here
[1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:42.200]  and tell us who the crowd is. It's just joined you on the street marching with you like right
[1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:46.760]  now in the fight club. Yeah, there was just local English lad, local English lad. This
[1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:49.800]  is their city, isn't it? This is their city. They were saying, but I saw folks that were
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:54.200]  white that were brown. You name it, giving us thumbs up. Yeah, yeah, black lads. Yeah.
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:59.800]  Yeah, that's what you have to understand this whole myth. Yeah, yeah, the black community,
[1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:04.760]  especially where I'm from, we're like this. We're like this. When it comes to this is
[1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:09.200]  an ideology that has no color. This is an ideology. In fact, many of the most radical Muslims
[1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:14.520]  now are white, unfortunately, in the UK, especially in the prison system. Most Africans
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:18.720]  have been bombed or attacked by Muslim groups. They've really experienced the Islamic invasion
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:24.880]  in Africa. Yeah, well, they've embraced the country. As I said, my mom was an immigrant
[1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:28.800]  to this country and she embraced it and as our children, we embraced it. And that's the
[1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:32.600]  same with them. They've embraced it and love it. But there's one section of the community
[1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:36.800]  who don't. One section of immigrants have come here who refuse to, who are now third
[1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:40.560]  generation. I believe this man was second generation. But second and third generation,
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:44.200]  the problem's getting worse and worse. Problems getting worse and worse. The hatred, the
[1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:48.800]  pure hatred against our way of life, our culture, our history, everything about.
[1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:54.240]  I have noticed a lot of the British leaders suppose are white Muslims and seem to be the
[1:01:54.240 --> 1:01:58.680]  most aggressive. What's going on with that? Yeah. And in the prison, do you know what's
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:02.960]  happened is we've lost our identity as English people. We've lost our history. We've not
[1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:07.120]  been allowed to be proud in who we are, proud in our history or our culture. So there's
[1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:11.480]  something missing anyway. So Islam fills that void. They enjoy Islam and they're allowed
[1:02:11.480 --> 1:02:15.960]  to be proud in their identity. And they're given a real strong sense of belief and identity
[1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:20.320]  and belonging, which, which has been lost, purposely lost orchestrated. They've done
[1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:23.600]  that on purpose. I said, most English kids who are 16 walking around with their heads
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:28.040]  down, walking around with their heads down. So they take culture away and then bring
[1:02:28.040 --> 1:02:33.760]  in either leftist globalism or Islam. Why do you think the left is so allied again, Tommy
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:39.800]  Robinson on the ground in Manchester investigating live? Why do you think that the left is so
[1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:40.800]  allied with Islam?
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:46.280]  I always say, because it's the Marxism communists that are lining with Islam and they both hate
[1:02:46.280 --> 1:02:50.720]  each other, but they're, but they're simply using each other. They're simply using each
[1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:55.920]  other. They're using each other. And I think this is, this is where it is now.
[1:02:55.920 --> 1:02:58.800]  If you give us a shot forward, then we'll still be able to hear you. Just go ahead and
[1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:03.480]  turn it around. Tommy Robinson reporting for a lot of great websites and a lot of great
[1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:07.960]  work he's doing. You can check them out to obviously online at the rebel media.com, Tommy
[1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:12.720]  Robinson.co.uk, at the rebel media.com. A lot of great folks there. Look at that beautiful
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:20.480]  old city of Manchester and this is the vigil probably be led by Muslims telling us that
[1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:21.480]  we should all worship them.
[1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:34.240]  Look at the gorgeous architecture there. There's a way to get to this. And then there we go.
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:39.560]  Oh good. He's just teaching Tommy how to flip that around by hitting the bill. I'm the same
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:44.480]  way. I'm not that savvy with the tech stuff. I love that people say, look at the Muslim
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:49.360]  architecture in Turkey. Oh my God. Look at the blue moss was built by Christians. I'm
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:52.400]  not saying the Muslims haven't built some amazing architecture and didn't invent a lot
[1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:57.200]  of science. That'd be a lie. I'm just saying that the Muslims have golden age before, especially
[1:03:57.200 --> 1:04:05.800]  before they were Muslims 1400 years ago and I'm sorry folks. I was against the Iraq war
[1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:10.560]  all of it because we were overthrowing non radical Muslims. I don't want to fight with
[1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:15.680]  the Muslims, but I cannot put up with this anymore. Tommy Robinson again reporting. We're
[1:04:15.680 --> 1:04:19.120]  going to go to break my friend. We're back in three minutes and you can take over if you
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:25.640]  want to report from the scene for folks there. So again, he's approaching the vigil right
[1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:29.480]  now. We've got to go to break. These are hard breaks on the network. So Tommy, if you want
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:32.760]  to turn it back around, get a good signal. We appreciate you. We'll be back to you in
[1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:36.960]  three minutes. Okay. All right. I guess he didn't have his earpiece. Now ask him to turn
[1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:41.920]  it around. Let's ask him to now let him take over and then Tommy will report from Manchester
[1:04:41.920 --> 1:04:48.720]  at the vigil that has nothing to do with Islamics attacking us last night. According to the
[1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:55.320]  media, according to according to George Soros's group, it's all my fault. We'll be back on
[1:04:55.320 --> 1:05:00.320]  Alex Jones. This is the info war.
[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:05.880]  More tragedy in Chicago, which is living up to its nickname. Shira 14 shot in four hours.
[1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:10.400]  One fatally a 16 year old boy shot in the head. One of the boys was 14. He was walking
[1:05:10.400 --> 1:05:14.680]  down the street when someone opened fire and hit him in the chest. There were also at least
[1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:19.040]  six other shootings in Chicago in the same time span. Recall that President Trump said
[1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:23.120]  if Chicago can't fix this problem, he will step in while I am not sure what the solution
[1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:28.120]  to this is. Perhaps legalization of certain drugs were not indoctrinating the youth into
[1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:33.560]  the gang culture, returning industry and manufacturing to cities to produce jobs. But what's certainly
[1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:39.280]  not working is Democrat leadership and the anti gun policies of the mayor of Chicago,
[1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:45.240]  Illinois. While we see great cities like Baltimore, Chicago, parts of Los Angeles, St. Louis,
[1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:50.200]  Detroit deteriorate into violence and dilapidation. Are we finally going to see great Americans
[1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:54.680]  rise up to leadership roles to return these once great American cities to their glory?
[1:05:54.680 --> 1:05:58.520]  Let's hope with the next round of elections. That's the case for info wars.com. This is
[1:05:58.520 --> 1:06:05.200]  Owen Troyer in America's 240 plus year history. We have seen veterans from the first battles
[1:06:05.200 --> 1:06:10.440]  at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today,
[1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:14.840]  fight their hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice. That's what this
[1:06:14.840 --> 1:06:19.200]  holiday and remembrance is all about. It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for
[1:06:19.200 --> 1:06:23.760]  the belief they were building a better world. This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day
[1:06:23.760 --> 1:06:29.040]  are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize

[1:07:55.160 --> 1:08:02.160]  fight. This is the time to support InfoWars. That's infowarslife.com.
[1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:18.160]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:25.160]  All right, we've had Tommy Robinson, who is a journalist and nationalist standing up
[1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:35.040]  for free speech and sovereignty and Christianity in the UK on Weathers. He got to the vigil
[1:08:36.360 --> 1:08:42.160]  there in front of the main government building in Manchester, UK, close to where Paul Watson
[1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:46.240]  grew up. And then there were so many people obviously on their cell phones that the signal
[1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:53.240]  degraded and we lost it. But we do have a live feed from the vigil where all the usual leftist
[1:08:54.440 --> 1:09:01.440]  suspects that have let the Islamists to stand that have done all this stand up there and
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:05.280]  lecture everyone. We're going to keep our borders open. We're going to bring in more
[1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:09.640]  military age men. We're going to let them organize. We're going to let them sexually
[1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:13.240]  mutilate their daughters. We're going to let them put hoods on their heads and we're going
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:20.240]  to submit because we're loving. And that's basically what gets spewed. Here, let's hear
[1:09:22.040 --> 1:09:26.200]  what they have to say right now, marching up all the control government churches, telling
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:33.200]  us to all just bend over to Islam. Here it is. Let's listen to this. That's clapping.
[1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:40.200]  Oh, again, I can hear the audio earlier during the break. But this is this is live coverage
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:54.400]  of what's happening there. Paul Watson has the latest report up on info wars.com. You
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:10:01.320]  got 22 dead, mainly teenage girls went to hear a pop rock concert. And you've got more
[1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:05.200]  than 50 injured. Meanwhile, London police aren't really investigating the jihadis.
[1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:12.200]  No, they've launched a free speech crack down amid Manchester attack. And they say they're
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:18.600]  criminally investigating anyone that criticizes Islam or calls for investigation of Islam
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:25.600]  because this wasn't an Islamic attack. And they won't show you the dead bodies because
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:29.040]  they don't want you to personalize the people that were killed. They want to continue the
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:36.040]  Islamic invasion and the Islamic takeover. Now I want to go over the facts dealing with
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:44.200]  this case and place more clips and then open the phones up so that you have a chance to
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:50.000]  respond. But leftists have now been bemoaning Islamophobia backlash on social media following
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:55.800]  Manchester terror attack. And if you watch UK or EU news, it's very hard to hear anybody
[1:10:55.800 --> 1:11:02.800]  calling it an Islamic attack. We've got some of the audio now from the Manchester peace
[1:11:03.800 --> 1:11:08.360]  rally, which means run up the white flag. I have stacks of news where they have anti
[1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:13.560]  Islamophobia rallies in the UK and in Europe. And when the women go, they get raped at the
[1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:20.440]  rallies in public gang raped. And the police won't do anything because it's a sacrament
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:26.440]  to the goddess of Islam, I guess, a big sarcastic. But here it is.
[1:11:26.440 --> 1:11:33.440]  Yeah, let's run up the white flag. Yeah. Let's have the very people around the white flag
[1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:47.960]  come and lead us into more bondage. Yes. I love it. And again, it's the way that they
[1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:52.960]  sit there and grovel to Islam every time there's an Islamic attack and won't call it Islamic
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:57.960]  and say, we won't let this drive us apart. We will continue to worship Islam will continue
[1:11:57.960 --> 1:12:02.960]  to have Stockholm syndrome will continue to go along with all this. And in that crowd
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:07.960]  is Tommy Robinson somewhere. We'll get him back as soon as we're able to the toll free
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:12.960]  number to join us concerning the attacks concerning Trump's visit to the Middle East where he threw
[1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:19.960]  down the gauntlet to Orthodox radical Islam and said, you will be destroyed. God is against
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:25.960]  you. They responded a day later, didn't they? But there's been reports of thousands and
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:30.960]  thousands of jihadis coming back into Europe, back into the UK as Trump destroys al Qaeda
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:37.960]  and ISIS in Syria. There's been warnings that these people check these people. But the
[1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:43.960]  UN runs the refugee program and says, sorry, under international law that you've signed
[1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:52.960]  on to, we say who comes into your country, including the United States. So let's go over
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:13:00.960]  some of the news here. French president said terrorism part of our daily lives for years
[1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:08.960]  to come after the latest shooting in Paris of police. Foreign men rape molest girls in
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:14.960]  anti racism, peace and love festival. There's video of the women being gang raped shot by
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:19.960]  the Muslims with them lined up. One man holds each leg, they hold the woman, they choker,
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:24.960]  the men line up and raper and raper and raper and they beg and they beg and they beg. There's
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:30.960]  hours of this footage. I would skip through it and just it was so horrific that I only
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:36.960]  showed screenshots of the women with total nightmare hell surrender in their eyes just
[1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:40.960]  like God, why have you forsaken me as they're being gang raped by the very Muslims they
[1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:50.960]  came to worship. Go watch the footage if you dare. Let's continue here. Cologne women
[1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:58.960]  apologize for xenophobia by giving migrant Islamist roses following mass public molestation.
[1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:04.960]  Trump was right, migrants riot, loot, fight with police and set cars on fire in Sweden.
[1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:09.960]  It was terrible what happened last night in Sweden. He watched the clip the night before
[1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:13.960]  from three days before and then it happened the day after he said it but it didn't matter
[1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:17.960]  that it happened right behind the day he said and right after the day they said Trump was
[1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:22.960]  wrong. You know if Trump told you a lottery ticket number and it came up true they'd say
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:28.960]  it was wrong. No the migrants don't rape anybody they don't hurt anybody. Islam never did
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:34.960]  anything they don't put hoods over women's heads either. Sweden just last week 70 year
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:39.960]  old woman prosecuted for complaining about migrants defecating on the streets. That's
[1:14:39.960 --> 1:14:52.960]  part of their culture lady. Meanwhile Manchester Arena suicide bombing 22 die in Ariana Grande
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:57.960]  concert and by the way people ask what are they going to do they're going to do nothing
[1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:01.960]  they'll have checkpoints and search you and all the rest of it but it'll be an Islamist
[1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:05.960]  you know let you through the back door every time hell most of the time in the UK they're
[1:15:05.960 --> 1:15:11.960]  the ones running the security. I love how when I fly to the UK Muslim women and men are the
[1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:16.960]  ones that ask me questions and search me and when I'm leaving they do it every time it's
[1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:21.960]  Muslims and I'm like is this a joke but it's not see it's all part of the Stockholm syndrome
[1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:27.960]  all part of the cuckolding all part of the joke it'd be like if weasels or foxes were
[1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:33.960]  killing the hen house every night so you hired a guard to guard it and it was a fox you know
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:39.960]  fox guard the hen house so I'm walking up I get the 20 questions I get put to the ringer
[1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:43.960]  I got asked why I'm here what am I doing what do I plan? Mine extremists and I'm sitting
[1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:48.960]  there going to know full well who I am and I'm looking at a Muslim woman wearing a hijab
[1:15:48.960 --> 1:16:02.960]  and I'm just like what this must be really funny to you cupcake. Manchester suicide bombing
[1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:09.960]  22 plus dead but that's okay then I've got all the different recent attacks not counting
[1:16:09.960 --> 1:16:13.960]  the Russian when you know the Russian attacks we've seen don't even really get on our news
[1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:18.960]  and our media is kind of like oh they deserve it you know recent major terror attacks in
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:22.960]  Europe because we can't have any solidarity with Russians fighting Islam more than we
[1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:27.960]  are we can't have any kinship with a nation of people that have been fighting Muslims
[1:16:27.960 --> 1:16:31.960]  longer than we have no no no no they're the enemy because they're actually fighting
[1:16:31.960 --> 1:16:38.960]  Muslims. April 7th 2017 a man driving a hijack beer truck struck pedestrians at Stockholm
[1:16:38.960 --> 1:16:42.960]  department store but don't worry they have Stockholm syndrome so they said it wasn't
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:49.960]  Muslim even though it was. March 22nd a man drives a rented SUV into pedestrians at
[1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:53.960]  London's Westminster Bridge killing four people the attacker then stabbed a police officer
[1:16:53.960 --> 1:17:00.960]  while screaming Allah Akbar but it had nothing to do with Islam. December 19th 2016 a hijack
[1:17:00.960 --> 1:17:07.960]  truck plowed through a Christian market in Berlin killing 12. In fact this must be an
[1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:13.960]  old list this doesn't even have the police being shot in France or the other truck attack
[1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:22.960]  in France. Not at whatever. July 14th a truck driver targets Bastille Day travelers at
[1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:27.960]  Nice killing 86. It was like a video game little kids running and then they just plow
[1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:33.960]  them over and again many of the people killed supported bringing in the Islamist. It's
[1:17:33.960 --> 1:17:36.960]  like bringing in a rattlesnake and putting it in your bed at night it's your fault when
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:41.960]  it attacks you. I'm not blaming everybody I'm not blaming the children I am blaming
[1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:47.960]  the cuckold white flag culture. If you look at Al Qaeda and ISIS's flag it's black that
[1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:55.960]  means no surrender. Suicide attacks on the Brussels airport and Subway kill 32 and injured
[1:17:55.960 --> 1:18:00.960]  hundreds. The perpetrators have been closely linked to the group that carried out earlier
[1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:07.960]  attacks in Paris. Islamic State November 13th linked extremist attack a concert hall and
[1:18:07.960 --> 1:18:12.960]  other sites. I'm not going to keep reading all these this is just part of them. Now look
[1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:16.960]  at all the SWAT teams that show up right after it happens running around. I'm not against
[1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:20.960]  the individual police officers but you leave the gates open you bring the problem in you
[1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:29.960]  protect it and then you show up after everybody's dead and dying as the saviors. If you were
[1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:33.960]  really the saviors you'd be politically active changing what's happening in your
[1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:41.960]  government and not going along with the sellout to the Islamists. Sick video shows ISIS
[1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:58.960]  jihadist ominous warning after Manchester Arena Blast. If we've got time to cue that up it's a short clip I'm going to come back and play more clips and then go to your phone calls but here's the jihadist celebrating the blast. ISIS is now officially taking credit.
[1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:10.960]  Sick video shows ISIS third blossom a jihadist make ominous warning after Manchester Arena Blast. I'd love to get my hands on you but I know you're some guy that runs around spewing your anti-Christian garbage you're probably on
[1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:21.960]  welfare you're probably in the UK you're a big lazy punk probably where gangster you know outfits you're just you're just the classic wimp the classic guy that never had a strong man in his life
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:32.960]  who thinks being a thug to women and being a little coward makes you tough because you haven't been around real men to put you in your little cowardly place. Let's play a clip of this piece of garbage.
[1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:41.960]  In the name of Allah the merciful the grateful this is only the beginning. In the name of Allah. Allah let me come back to this guy.
[1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:52.960]  In the name of Allah the merciful the merciful I've got to blow up domesticated people because I want to show them to submit to me.
[1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:58.960]  Media matters will attack Alex Jones because he ain't talk bad about me.

[1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:00.960]  Many books have been written regarding the law of attraction.
[1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:06.960]  But what if all these books are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this law in our lives?
[1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:12.960]  The new book, It's Time to Align, the most powerful self-help book ever written by Alan Laudinger,
[1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:17.960]  takes a look at how the law of attraction really works and how it is being suppressed in our lives.
[1:23:17.960 --> 1:23:23.960]  Learn how to overcome this manipulation and how to experience alignment with the creative power of the universe.
[1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:48.960]  The new book, It's Time to Align, available at Amazon.com.
[1:23:53.960 --> 1:23:58.960]  At FullyCookedBacon.com.
[1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:35.960]  Live from the future Islamic Caliphate of the United States of America.
[1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:38.960]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:41.960]  That's where this stuff's going. I'm telling you, you go to them all now.
[1:24:41.960 --> 1:24:45.960]  It's just the main signs or hajjibs and just how wonderful it is.
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:49.960]  Even though there's really no market in that and Muslims are a very small part of our population,
[1:24:49.960 --> 1:24:54.960]  we're being conditioned to accept it. Whether it's the Islamist mayor of London
[1:24:54.960 --> 1:25:02.960]  or whether it's the new pretty boy appointed into power there in France, Macron, it doesn't matter.
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:09.960]  The same message over and over again is we must get used to Islamic terror attacks and accept it.
[1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:13.960]  It's part of being a great global city, a great global order.
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:20.960]  It's the same talking points, the same agenda because the Muslims have six kids on average.
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:23.960]  The West was induced to have 1.3 children.
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:27.960]  So the globalists say they're replacing us with Islam.
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:30.960]  Okay, well, here's the deal.
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:34.960]  I don't want to have to put hoods over my daughter's faces or cut their genitals off
[1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:40.960]  or not let them drive cars and have them have huge spy grids that are used to spy on everybody run by the Muslims.
[1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:46.960]  This is just crazy. But here's the little arrogant mayor helping bring in Sharia law.
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:51.960]  He says, quote, he's not an Uncle Tom. That's a quote. He's going to bring in Islam.
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:57.960]  Here he is talking about just getting used to bombings.
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:03.960]  As to who was responsible, I'm not going to speculate as to how the police in New York should react.
[1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:09.960]  What I do know is part and parcel of living in a great global city is you've got to be prepared for these things.
[1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:14.960]  Now, by the way, when I say the UK police are to blame, I don't mean the average cop.
[1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:16.960]  The media will say he said the average cop was the blame.
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:19.960]  No, I mean the bureaucrats, the politicians, the system.
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:21.960]  But you've actually got to hand it to the Manchester police.
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:23.960]  They said, this is a terror attack.
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:26.960]  And they go on to say it's connected to an Islamic extremist.
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:29.960]  That is a revolutionary act of the UK.
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:33.960]  Because if you watch the news there when we had Tommy Robinson on earlier live from Manchester,
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:37.960]  you have to dig to find that they will not say it.
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:40.960]  Now, I've got a bunch of clips I want to get to here.
[1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:50.960]  But a big one that's really, really important is this clip of the president in his response to the attack.
[1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:56.960]  And then you can look at what he said the day before in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he declared them cowards.
[1:26:56.960 --> 1:26:58.960]  He said, stop what you're doing.
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:06.960]  And then their response was, we're going to go to a teenager girl pop place where the girls are taught to be trendy.
[1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:07.960]  They're taught to be liberal.
[1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:08.960]  They're taught to have open borders.
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:10.960]  They're taught to accept the Muslims.
[1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:11.960]  They're taught all this.
[1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:12.960]  It's not their fault.
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:13.960]  It's the state's fault.
[1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:14.960]  It's the government's fault.
[1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:18.960]  It's the adult trendies that are undoubtedly there overseeing this.
[1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:20.960]  That just keeps saying everything's fine.
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:21.960]  Everything's fine.
[1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:23.960]  Capitulate, capitulate.
[1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:28.960]  When everything's not fine, these poor girls have nobody to stand up for them.
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:33.960]  In fact, the men are so unmanly now in many cucked European countries that the women are going for Islam
[1:27:33.960 --> 1:27:38.960]  because they think having a guy that wipes his butt with his hand and wears it, you know, outfit
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:42.960]  but tells a shop up, get your nut and cook me slave.
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:48.960]  They think that's manly because Western men have become such cucks.
[1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:50.960]  So here is the president.
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:59.960]  I extend my deepest condolences to those so terribly injured in this terrorist attack
[1:27:59.960 --> 1:28:08.960]  and to the many killed and the families, so many families of the victims.
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:15.960]  We stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom.
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:22.960]  So many young, beautiful, innocent people living and enjoying their lives
[1:28:22.960 --> 1:28:28.960]  murdered by evil losers in life.
[1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:35.960]  I won't call them monsters because they would like that term.
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:40.960]  They would think that's a great name.
[1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:47.960]  I will call them from now on losers because that's what they are.
[1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:53.960]  They're losers and we'll have more of them, but they're losers.
[1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:58.960]  Just remember that.
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:03.960]  This is what I've spent these last few days talking about during my trip overseas.
[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:12.960]  Our society can have no tolerance for this continuation of bloodshed.
[1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:21.960]  We cannot stand a moment longer for the slaughter of innocent people.
[1:29:21.960 --> 1:29:28.960]  And in today's attack, it was mostly innocent children.
[1:29:28.960 --> 1:29:32.960]  The terrorists and extremists and those who give them aid and comfort
[1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:37.960]  must be driven out from our society forever.
[1:29:37.960 --> 1:29:41.960]  This wicked ideology must be obliterated.
[1:29:41.960 --> 1:29:42.960]  That's right. We're going to be back.
[1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:44.960]  And I mean completely obliterated.
[1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:48.960]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:29:48.960 --> 1:29:52.960]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:52.960 --> 1:30:20.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:27.960]  Freedom is for free.
[1:30:27.960 --> 1:30:33.240]  make good ones. If we are only free to make good decisions, then we are not really free.
[1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:38.060]  Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even
[1:30:38.060 --> 1:30:44.640]  welcome automobile checkpoints, random searches, mandatory identification cards, and paramilitary
[1:30:44.640 --> 1:30:50.280]  police in our streets. We have lost a vital part of our American heritage. America was
[1:30:50.280 --> 1:30:55.860]  born of protests, revolution, and mistrust of government. Subservient societies neither
[1:30:55.860 --> 1:30:58.160]  maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[1:31:26.860 --> 1:31:31.620]  I really liked the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest. That's really incredible. I
[1:31:31.620 --> 1:31:36.080]  drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible. Like I haven't felt sweet.
[1:31:36.080 --> 1:31:42.220]  My morning was fantastic and I love the guys, I love the info wars true and I just want
[1:31:42.220 --> 1:31:48.020]  to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.

[1:32:26.620 --> 1:32:33.300]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family. Now in 2016, even more information
[1:32:33.300 --> 1:32:38.420]  has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts
[1:32:38.420 --> 1:32:43.620]  are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these
[1:32:43.620 --> 1:32:47.660]  studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine
[1:32:47.660 --> 1:32:53.820]  is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on survival shield x2 today

[1:33:23.820 --> 1:33:48.820]  All right, Dr. Corsi's popping in for about 10 minutes. We're going to go to your phone
[1:33:48.820 --> 1:33:55.700]  calls right into the next hour. We have Dr. Mercola joining us with some huge, huge developments
[1:33:55.700 --> 1:34:01.820]  on so many fronts with all these massive studies coming out confirming much of his research
[1:34:01.820 --> 1:34:12.820]  and other researchers. Intel 800-259-9231-800-259-9231 is a toll-free number for you to join us.
[1:34:12.820 --> 1:34:17.060]  I've got some other clips I want to play as well. Obviously, we just tuned in. You already
[1:34:17.060 --> 1:34:24.540]  know about the 22 dead over 50 injured in a suicide bombing in Manchester, England at
[1:34:24.540 --> 1:34:34.420]  a girls' college slash high school level pop rock concert. And I'm not even so much angry
[1:34:34.420 --> 1:34:39.660]  at Islam because it is what it is. I'm not mad at the AIDS virus. It is what it is. I'm
[1:34:39.660 --> 1:34:43.700]  not mad at a crocodile that eats a small child. A crocodile is a crocodile. I'm not mad at
[1:34:43.700 --> 1:34:50.140]  a black widow that bites somebody and kills them. It's a black widow. I'm not mad at a
[1:34:50.140 --> 1:34:53.780]  tornado that goes through the neighborhood and kills some people. That's what tornadoes
[1:34:53.780 --> 1:35:02.420]  do. It's that letting Islamists in from the most radical out-of-control areas of the world,
[1:35:02.420 --> 1:35:07.980]  whether they're literally the most bizarre cult the planet's ever seen, where women can't
[1:35:07.980 --> 1:35:11.660]  go outside without a male attendant, where women wear total hoods over their heads, where
[1:35:11.660 --> 1:35:17.780]  women can't drive cars, where women can be raped, they report it, they get charged with
[1:35:17.780 --> 1:35:24.100]  a sex crime. And then to be lectured by feminist all day how I'm a bad Western man, when the
[1:35:24.100 --> 1:35:30.500]  West is where women got empowered and where slavery got ended, except in Islamic countries.
[1:35:30.500 --> 1:35:35.740]  Many Islamic countries still have slavery. People go, oh, well, that's their culture.
[1:35:35.740 --> 1:35:41.740]  This all goes liberal to the hookah bar. So there's this weird liberal fascination with
[1:35:41.740 --> 1:35:47.220]  the most radical Orthodox farms of Islam. I know Dr. Corsi worked in counterterrorism
[1:35:47.220 --> 1:35:51.260]  with the State Department and other areas and is an expert on radical Islam. But that's
[1:35:51.260 --> 1:35:55.500]  not why he's about to join us in a moment, but I'm sure he'll be able to speak to that.
[1:35:55.500 --> 1:35:59.660]  But I'm really mad at the elites that have opened the door up to do this and that would
[1:35:59.660 --> 1:36:10.460]  make an alliance with people that absolutely are more barbarous than most cultures were
[1:36:10.460 --> 1:36:21.540]  5,000, 6,000 years ago. I mean, modern Islam was formed out of the slave trade and camel
[1:36:21.540 --> 1:36:29.460]  caravan routes that came through Mecca and is the worst of the worst of the worst of
[1:36:29.460 --> 1:36:36.940]  the worst and is absolutely the most criminal, reprobate, twisted, bizarre rationale for
[1:36:36.940 --> 1:36:48.380]  pure evil. It is the most monotheistic, chauvinistic thing on earth. I don't like extreme liberalism.
[1:36:48.380 --> 1:36:55.180]  I don't like extreme Islam. America is like way towards liberalism under Thomas Jefferson
[1:36:55.180 --> 1:37:00.420]  and the very liberals then criticize us all day from a position of ignorance because they
[1:37:00.420 --> 1:37:06.580]  get off on the power trip of thinking, hey, here comes Islam. They're the muscle we need.
[1:37:06.580 --> 1:37:12.820]  How many videos have you seen at college campuses where they'll just declare the entire commons,
[1:37:12.820 --> 1:37:18.340]  entire parks or off limits to anybody that's white? But then you'll notice it's white professors
[1:37:18.340 --> 1:37:24.940]  almost universally that are leading the minorities that they're taking over from whiting. It's
[1:37:24.940 --> 1:37:32.540]  a classic case of animal farm. George Arwell. And then they'll walk over to camera people
[1:37:32.540 --> 1:37:39.860]  that are coming over with cameras and they'll say, get out of here and start shoving them.
[1:37:39.860 --> 1:37:44.900]  And then the man says, no, and she goes, that's it. Get me some muscle. And she goes over
[1:37:44.900 --> 1:37:48.900]  and tries to find a big black guy to come over and physically attack the white guy and
[1:37:48.900 --> 1:37:55.940]  the black guy won't even do it. It's like weird beta women wanting to wage war is what
[1:37:55.940 --> 1:38:03.300]  I found. That's what feminism is. But then they go to the most twisted, crazy alpha male.
[1:38:03.300 --> 1:38:08.700]  But it's not alpha male. It's like a weird twisted alpha male. It's like a little disgruntled,
[1:38:08.700 --> 1:38:16.460]  twisted chicken necked alpha male real cowardly and hateful and oppressive and greedy and
[1:38:16.460 --> 1:38:24.060]  backwards and smelly. And by smelly, I mean just the whole thing just as a cultural stench
[1:38:24.060 --> 1:38:28.660]  to it. And it's the worst forms of Islam that are taking over Islam. It always wants to
[1:38:28.660 --> 1:38:33.820]  take over any nice city or nice culture or nice art and burn it down, blow it up, take
[1:38:33.820 --> 1:38:40.820]  her by the sports stadium, hang them by their necks. Yeah, let's play this clip of this
[1:38:40.820 --> 1:38:45.980]  like let's back it up. Yeah, can somebody get me some muscle? She's attacking him. She's
[1:38:45.980 --> 1:38:52.260]  attacking his camera because she's the God now. She rules. You will submit. We're going
[1:38:52.260 --> 1:38:58.620]  to Dr. Corsi here in just a moment dealing with the total media hysteria over us getting
[1:38:58.620 --> 1:39:02.140]  some press passes, which aren't the reason we're in DC. We're there for interviews, there
[1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:06.460]  for our sources, there for the press club. Corsi is constantly at the press meetings
[1:39:06.460 --> 1:39:10.740]  of the different agencies of Congress breaking big news on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It's
[1:39:10.740 --> 1:39:15.420]  almost a hassle for him to go get the things and then go sit there all day hoping to get
[1:39:15.420 --> 1:39:18.980]  a question in when it might take you a month to do it. But they just keep trying to keep
[1:39:18.980 --> 1:39:23.860]  us out of the White House. This symbol of we're not real news. So we got the week long
[1:39:23.860 --> 1:39:28.500]  press pass. They're flipping out about it. We're going to talk about that at the moment.
[1:39:28.500 --> 1:39:36.940]  First, we've had six of our best selling products sold out, some of it for a month,
[1:39:36.940 --> 1:39:41.660]  some for two months, some products for two weeks. And that's not a good thing. But we
[1:39:41.660 --> 1:39:47.540]  have such high quality standards that are at California level that almost nobody else
[1:39:47.540 --> 1:39:52.540]  can pass that it's hard to get the ingredients that are 100% pure. But we always wait till
[1:39:52.540 --> 1:39:59.220]  we actually get the pure batches. So everything is back in now, accepting an A-Force. Everything
[1:39:59.220 --> 1:40:09.060]  is back in at infowarstore.com. And out of the gates for the Memorial Day special, we
[1:40:09.060 --> 1:40:15.420]  have the mega specials. This is undoubtedly one of the biggest sales we've ever done.
[1:40:15.420 --> 1:40:25.740]  Our bullet colloidal silver, 65% off. I was saying 50% off. I'm sorry, it's 65% off.
[1:40:25.740 --> 1:40:32.540]  We've never done 65. So when I saw that earlier, I said 50 in my own brain. It's a loss leader.
[1:40:32.540 --> 1:40:36.020]  We want you to have it. We want you to enjoy the product. We want you to a lot of you that
[1:40:36.020 --> 1:40:39.780]  haven't ever gone and shopped with us to support the broadcast. Now is the time. More than
[1:40:39.780 --> 1:40:42.740]  ever, we're under free speech attack. We're being demonized. They're trying to shut us
[1:40:42.740 --> 1:40:47.300]  down. But frankly, these have been sold out for a while. We can sell these all at full
[1:40:47.300 --> 1:40:53.780]  retail. But I want to have a win-win here. I want you to get the colloidal silver, 65%
[1:40:53.780 --> 1:41:00.060]  off. Supermail volatility, our best seller, 30% off out of the gates, gone for months.

[1:41:27.060 --> 1:41:34.620]  only runs through next Tuesday. Super blue, high quality fluoride free toothpaste. M4warstore.com,
[1:41:34.620 --> 1:41:39.980]  M4warslife.com. Read the reviews. Here's one for Supermail volatility from Carson. Totally
[1:41:39.980 --> 1:41:43.620]  worth it. I love this product. Many people say they could feel it helped a couple of
[1:41:43.620 --> 1:41:47.660]  days for me. It took a couple of weeks. After it got in my system, it was a game changer.
[1:41:47.660 --> 1:41:54.060]  If you're on the fence about buying this product, I hope it will help you in so many ways. Five
[1:41:54.060 --> 1:42:00.700]  star review. Z Shield, our new product of detoxify heavy metals, other compounds. It's now available.
[1:42:00.700 --> 1:42:10.180]  M4warslife.com, M4warsstore.com, or AAA-253-3139. And listen, I get up here and I come off
[1:42:10.180 --> 1:42:13.940]  as brash and aggressive because I'm exhausted most of the time. I'm working till 7, 8, 9,
[1:42:13.940 --> 1:42:19.780]  10 at night because I'm committed to the truth. Not because I'm even an angel. I fundamentally
[1:42:19.780 --> 1:42:24.100]  do not want to be dominated by globalist or by Islamist or by anybody else. I have a fighting
[1:42:24.100 --> 1:42:29.340]  spirit. I know you have one as well. And it upsets me to see Muslims attack people on
[1:42:29.340 --> 1:42:33.780]  a weekly basis who are innocent. I mean, if you hate our military and hate our policies,
[1:42:33.780 --> 1:42:37.660]  why don't you go attack a military base? Why don't you go attack a police station? I'm
[1:42:37.660 --> 1:42:43.420]  not saying do that. I'm just saying that's called being more chivalrous. And it's fundamentally
[1:42:43.420 --> 1:42:49.700]  to see a bunch of weird leftist defending it and attacking us makes me angry. If you'll
[1:42:49.700 --> 1:42:55.460]  just support us and just buy the products, you get auto-ship, get 10% off, free shipping
[1:42:55.460 --> 1:43:00.220]  on orders, $50 or more. If you'll just make the commitment to get great products on a
[1:43:00.220 --> 1:43:03.220]  routine basis, that's why auto-ships could because I tend to forget my own products.
[1:43:03.220 --> 1:43:06.700]  I get them out of the warehouse myself and I'll run out. So I've actually ordered my
[1:43:06.700 --> 1:43:11.860]  own products now online, used auto-ship, and then forwardstore.com so I don't forget. Works
[1:43:11.860 --> 1:43:16.500]  like a charm because I'm busy and I'm always at home. Oh, I need some Coil Silver. I got
[1:43:16.500 --> 1:43:21.700]  a sore throat or oh, I ran out of Secret 12 for my kids or I ran out of our own, you know,

[1:44:25.220 --> 1:44:27.820]  over the world. We're going to be going to your phone calls here in a few minutes. But
[1:44:27.820 --> 1:44:34.060]  I wanted to get Dr. Jerome Corsi on with us to give us his first snapshot on what happened
[1:44:34.060 --> 1:44:39.940]  24 hours after the President's speech in Riyadh. I thought a bold speech that he called out
[1:44:39.940 --> 1:44:45.620]  radical Islam to its face. And then to see this attack, and then ISIS and Al Qaeda saying
[1:44:45.620 --> 1:44:49.980]  a lot more coming, what is the EU thinking, Dr. Corsi, you're a terrorism expert, for
[1:44:49.980 --> 1:44:56.420]  those that don't know, that they're accelerating as ISIS gets defeated by Trump in America.
[1:44:56.420 --> 1:45:00.500]  They're admittedly flooding back into Europe. Europe's letting them back in. It's admitted
[1:45:00.500 --> 1:45:05.220]  they're letting known ISIS fighters back in. Does that make the UK government and doesn't
[1:45:05.220 --> 1:45:10.220]  let that make the German government and others guilty of these attacks?
[1:45:10.220 --> 1:45:17.540]  Absolutely. I mean, you've got a situation right now where the UK is trying to take control
[1:45:17.540 --> 1:45:23.740]  of its borders back again from the EU. But if you look at the EU in Brussels, you've
[1:45:23.740 --> 1:45:29.020]  got unelected bureaucrats, globalists, who are insisting that all the countries of the
[1:45:29.020 --> 1:45:37.380]  EU have open borders and are being inundated with these refugees. This attack in London
[1:45:37.380 --> 1:45:45.820]  was from, I believe, a Lebanon family of refugees that has come into the UK. The UK says there's
[1:45:45.820 --> 1:45:54.380]  3,500 known terrorists, radical Islamic terrorists, in the UK right now. And the laws that they've
[1:45:54.380 --> 1:45:59.100]  been operating under really tie the hands of the police from doing anything to protect
[1:45:59.100 --> 1:46:00.100]  the people.
[1:46:00.100 --> 1:46:05.860]  Sure. And just to be clear, it was being confirmed now of Libyan refugees. Go ahead.
[1:46:05.860 --> 1:46:11.940]  Libyan refugees. All right. Libyan refugees. Well, I mean, again, Libya has been destroyed
[1:46:11.940 --> 1:46:19.180]  by Hillary Clinton when she devastated the country, siding with al-Qaeda terrorists to
[1:46:19.180 --> 1:46:29.380]  house Qaddafi. The country is degenerated into a terrorist-controlled bedlam. And people
[1:46:29.380 --> 1:46:33.820]  can get out of getting out, but the radical Islamic terrorists who get out bring the radical
[1:46:33.820 --> 1:46:38.860]  Islamic terror with them. And that's the problem we're having right now in the UK and all across
[1:46:38.860 --> 1:46:39.860]  Europe.
[1:46:39.860 --> 1:46:46.700]  And it's not going to be resolved by politicians wishing that everyone would just get along
[1:46:46.700 --> 1:46:52.340]  or this Islamophobia, political correctness, because this situation as Donald Trump is
[1:46:52.340 --> 1:46:59.500]  pointing out in this historic trip is going to need the cooperation, in fact, a reformation
[1:46:59.500 --> 1:47:06.700]  of Islam in order to reject these radicals and to define that the religion is not encouraging
[1:47:06.700 --> 1:47:12.820]  violence. That's like a reformation that the various Christian churches went through in
[1:47:12.820 --> 1:47:17.900]  the Renaissance. And afterwards, and it's got to happen, you know, the Protestant Reformation
[1:47:17.900 --> 1:47:19.900]  was a major reformulation.
[1:47:19.900 --> 1:47:24.580]  Yeah. Where is Islam's Martin Luther? And meanwhile, we don't just demonize George
[1:47:24.580 --> 1:47:28.340]  Sorrell. It's as usual, he's the one behind it. And the human refugee program with these
[1:47:28.340 --> 1:47:36.020]  big, long boats enticing the Libyans to flee to get on these big 100-foot boats that they
[1:47:36.020 --> 1:47:39.100]  then run them into the Italian coast.
[1:47:39.100 --> 1:47:46.060]  It's a huge problem. And people die on these boats. These boats are not stable. People
[1:47:46.060 --> 1:47:48.180]  drown when these boats tip over.
[1:47:48.180 --> 1:47:53.340]  So the EU goes in with Hillary, blows up Libya, then millions start pouring out, and then
[1:47:53.340 --> 1:47:54.820]  we're supposed to just take them all.
[1:47:54.820 --> 1:48:01.300]  Yeah, the EU wants all of them taken. The EU says, you XYZ country, you're going to
[1:48:01.300 --> 1:48:05.780]  be allocated so many of them. And if you want to have a EU passport, you want to be able
[1:48:05.780 --> 1:48:10.900]  to have free open borders, then you take the refugees, we're giving you. And it's just
[1:48:10.900 --> 1:48:17.780]  not working out. I mean, in all these countries, Sweden, Germany, you've got Muslim rapes,
[1:48:17.780 --> 1:48:23.340]  you've got Muslim murderers, you've got Muslim no-go zones where the police are as too dangerous
[1:48:23.340 --> 1:48:24.340]  even for the police to go.
[1:48:24.340 --> 1:48:29.820]  I've got statistics, 90% of shootings in Sweden, Muslims, 82% of Muslims doing the raping.
[1:48:29.820 --> 1:48:33.460]  I mean, they literally, it's like they're from another world.
[1:48:33.460 --> 1:48:38.540]  Well, the whole culture, I mean, the whole culture of this radical Islam, which is so
[1:48:38.540 --> 1:48:43.580]  dramatically anti-women, I mean, it's always amazed me that the American feminists-
[1:48:43.580 --> 1:48:47.460]  In fact, you can say, I mean, isn't Islam number one about oppressing women? Is it that
[1:48:47.460 --> 1:48:50.940]  the real heart of Islam?
[1:48:50.940 --> 1:48:58.900]  It's certainly core to the attraction of Islam across the world and this fertilizing of women
[1:48:58.900 --> 1:49:06.380]  is basically medieval. I mean, a sexual mutilation of girls is horrendous. The beating of women,
[1:49:06.380 --> 1:49:10.740]  the way women are treated. I mean, if anyone's ever been in the Middle East and actually
[1:49:10.740 --> 1:49:18.420]  seen the women wearing these veils and covered from head to foot, it's a fairly frightening
[1:49:18.420 --> 1:49:22.020]  scene to think of the subjugation of women that are-
[1:49:22.020 --> 1:49:27.300]  Doctor, I see this now at malls in Austin, not just to jibs. I'm seeing women covered
[1:49:27.300 --> 1:49:29.980]  up. You talk about almost having a heart attack.
[1:49:29.980 --> 1:49:35.660]  Right. I mean, it's a pretty frightening scene. I mean, because these women are completely
[1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:41.580]  subjugated, they're going to be beaten if they violate any rules. They can be, you know,
[1:49:41.580 --> 1:49:50.700]  divorced. If they're raped, it's their fault. The laws of Islam and Sharia law are brutal
[1:49:50.700 --> 1:49:57.820]  to women. And it's impossible for me to understand why feminists support Islam when it is so
[1:49:57.820 --> 1:50:02.940]  horrendously brutal to women. And, you know, this is where the reformations needed it.
[1:50:02.940 --> 1:50:09.300]  You saw in, you know, when President Trump was in Saudi Arabia, Melania Trump and Ivanka
[1:50:09.300 --> 1:50:15.860]  Trump did not wear head scarves. This was revolutionary in the Islamic world. These
[1:50:15.860 --> 1:50:22.500]  changes have got to happen. Islam is going to have to allow women to be treated as human
[1:50:22.500 --> 1:50:29.540]  beings and ultimately equals of men, because this is fundamental to the way the earth is
[1:50:29.540 --> 1:50:32.620]  and cultures have evolved to a higher level.
[1:50:32.620 --> 1:50:36.980]  But I was about to say, I've studied anthropology, so have you. Most cultures didn't oppress
[1:50:36.980 --> 1:50:42.460]  women ever like this. A lot of cultures, women ran things. I mean, this is just, I don't
[1:50:42.460 --> 1:50:46.900]  want folks to think that societies two, three thousand years ago treated women like this
[1:50:46.900 --> 1:50:51.620]  on average. I mean, what Muslims do today in Orthodox Muslim countries is the worst
[1:50:51.620 --> 1:50:56.540]  treatment of women in history. I mean, don't you agree with that historically? We'll be

[1:53:57.340 --> 1:54:20.300]  Okay, Terrence and Scotland, Jason in Germany, O'Brien, Dan, Cindy. We're going to go to
[1:54:20.300 --> 1:54:24.140]  all of you here. Dr. Corsi is our guest right now. The main reason I got him on this morning
[1:54:24.140 --> 1:54:28.580]  is we were approached by folks in the White House at the inauguration saying, hey, who's
[1:54:28.580 --> 1:54:33.100]  your White House correspondent going to be? And they already thought I had a D.C. office.
[1:54:33.100 --> 1:54:36.820]  And I'm like, no, we got to get a D.C. office. I don't know if I'm going to do it. The media
[1:54:36.820 --> 1:54:41.420]  took that and ran and said, oh, Joan says he's getting them, but he doesn't have them. You've
[1:54:41.420 --> 1:54:45.060]  got to have an office. You've got to have a driver's license there. Well, we got a weekly
[1:54:45.060 --> 1:54:49.500]  pass. Corsi's had stuff like this before. He's got congressional passes. He's covered
[1:54:49.500 --> 1:54:54.100]  the campaigns. He's been one of the top political puttons in the country. Everybody knows that.
[1:54:54.100 --> 1:55:00.500]  And so he got around to getting it. All hell broke loose. Some publications tried to imply
[1:55:00.500 --> 1:55:05.500]  we were lying and he wasn't even there. The truth is, most days, there's not even a reason
[1:55:05.500 --> 1:55:10.700]  to be there because the president's gone right now anyway. So this is Corsi that broke three
[1:55:10.700 --> 1:55:14.500]  months ago. They're stealing the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money. Manoon should confirm
[1:55:14.500 --> 1:55:18.460]  that three weeks ago and we got credit. Most of the meetings don't have it at briefings.
[1:55:18.460 --> 1:55:22.300]  They happen at dinners like he was at one with the vice president a few nights ago. Maybe
[1:55:22.300 --> 1:55:25.860]  I'm not supposed to say that. The point is you've been friends with Donald Trump for
[1:55:25.860 --> 1:55:30.060]  40 years. You guys were at the tower just, you know, four or five months ago together.
[1:55:30.060 --> 1:55:34.860]  I mean, they act like we're not real media. We're begging for press passes. Sure, low
[1:55:34.860 --> 1:55:42.140]  levels trying to block us, but they failed. Well, it also is amazing to me, the Twitter's
[1:55:42.140 --> 1:55:48.860]  I mean, I've been blocking these Twitter's doesn't vile vile comments. I mean, people
[1:55:48.860 --> 1:55:53.940]  are a little irrational. And I look at these adult women, you look at the pictures of them
[1:55:53.940 --> 1:56:00.260]  and it's just a string of swear words temper tantrums. Yeah, I just think these people
[1:56:00.260 --> 1:56:07.580]  have lost their minds. I mean, the the insults and the, you know, completely without any
[1:56:07.580 --> 1:56:15.420]  knowledge base at all, saying that, um, you know, we are destroying the news media because
[1:56:15.420 --> 1:56:19.780]  we've gotten press credentials at the White House. I mean, this type of thing is just
[1:56:19.780 --> 1:56:25.460]  a censorship again and on the left and an intolerance. You know, if you don't take
[1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:31.420]  their story and look at the views their way, then the left goes so berserk, they want almost
[1:56:31.420 --> 1:56:32.420]  do violence.
[1:56:32.420 --> 1:56:36.100]  Well, sure. Let me apologize that we did boost the stock market last week. Stock exchange
[1:56:36.100 --> 1:56:40.340]  heads confirmed it. I'm so sorry. And, and you know, you did break the giant story that's
[1:56:40.340 --> 1:56:43.700]  now all over the news about the looting of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a 300 billion of
[1:56:43.700 --> 1:56:48.420]  taxpayer money and investors money. And the president is now reversing it. So how dare
[1:56:48.420 --> 1:56:52.580]  us being so fake? No, the truth is you have a degree in international finance. You're
[1:56:52.580 --> 1:56:56.860]  a top banking expert. You're a top journalist and they're scared of you.
[1:56:56.860 --> 1:57:01.340]  Well, I've been, you know, I've been at this a long time and I've had press credentials.
[1:57:01.340 --> 1:57:07.220]  I traveled with the traveling press with George Romney the last three weeks of the
[1:57:07.220 --> 1:57:13.980]  2012 presidential campaign. I've attended any number of presidential speeches. I've
[1:57:13.980 --> 1:57:21.780]  seen in person every president back to Dwight Eisenhower, even saw Harry Truman as a child.
[1:57:21.780 --> 1:57:27.300]  I mean, I've seen every one of them and known very many of them. I've been at this for a
[1:57:27.300 --> 1:57:33.700]  long time. And you know, my PhD in political science as well as 25 years old, I spent 25
[1:57:33.700 --> 1:57:39.860]  years in international finance and I've worked around the world, creating, working with banks,
[1:57:39.860 --> 1:57:45.420]  working with finance companies at top security clearances. I broke any number of stories.
[1:57:45.420 --> 1:57:50.620]  I've written six New York Times bestselling books. Two of them were number one and you
[1:57:50.620 --> 1:57:56.900]  know, three were number one, the three, one of what, when you count that, I ghost wrote
[1:57:56.900 --> 1:58:03.340]  one that was number one. If I under my own name, I have two number one. I have the abomination
[1:58:03.340 --> 1:58:09.220]  and unfit for command. But I've, you know, I've had six New York Times bestsellers.
[1:58:09.220 --> 1:58:15.340]  I've written 20 books since 2004. And I've been published in international journals.
[1:58:15.340 --> 1:58:20.060]  I mean, it's been all over. And it's, it's, it's extensive. And at the mainstream media
[1:58:20.060 --> 1:58:22.020]  doesn't want to acknowledge it.
[1:58:22.020 --> 1:58:27.700]  Well, it's just so crazy how they keep trying to brand us as fake news when it isn't that
[1:58:27.700 --> 1:58:32.180]  we're in the White House that we're real news. It's that they follow us. I mean, we're the
[1:58:32.180 --> 1:58:35.900]  ones breaking the big news. We're the ones that have the contacts. We're the ones that
[1:58:35.900 --> 1:58:39.180]  have the guest.
[1:58:39.180 --> 1:58:50.380]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCN live.com today.
[1:58:50.380 --> 1:58:55.340]  Today we call it bone broth. And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[1:58:55.340 --> 1:58:59.580]  before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk. We are now introducing
[1:58:59.580 --> 1:59:04.900]  caveman by infowarslife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth,
[1:59:04.900 --> 1:59:10.740]  turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting
[1:59:10.740 --> 1:59:15.740]  formula. Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization
[1:59:15.740 --> 1:59:20.460]  that are our superior ancestors. And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[1:59:20.460 --> 1:59:24.460]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You use the meat for sustenance,
[1:59:24.460 --> 1:59:29.780]  the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full
[1:59:29.780 --> 1:59:33.780]  of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body. This
[1:59:33.780 --> 1:59:39.260]  is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but
[1:59:39.260 --> 1:59:43.300]  I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were. And this
[1:59:43.300 --> 1:59:46.660]  is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo
[1:59:46.660 --> 1:59:52.660]  formula for yourself and forwarslife.com today.
[1:59:52.660 --> 2:00:07.340]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:07.340 --> 2:00:12.340]  Everybody can hear the excitement in my voice, the fact that I'm so earnest. I like that
[2:00:12.340 --> 2:00:15.340]  in person.
[2:00:15.340 --> 2:00:21.940]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the Alex
[2:00:21.940 --> 2:00:22.940]  Jones show.
[2:00:22.940 --> 2:00:26.980]  But I can do hours of preparation at home and then here at the office and then work
[2:00:26.980 --> 2:00:33.180]  into the evening many days and on the weekends just looking at the globalists announcing
[2:00:33.180 --> 2:00:38.740]  the end of humanity and genetic engineering and bringing in the Islamist and ending free
[2:00:38.740 --> 2:00:44.940]  market and they're just horrible people are selling baby parts and it's like no. And I'm
[2:00:44.940 --> 2:00:49.020]  just here ringing the alarm. Does it mean the alarm sometimes is you know has a pretty
[2:00:49.020 --> 2:00:54.340]  sound to it? No. But it's getting the job done. We are all Paul Revere's in the fight
[2:00:54.340 --> 2:00:56.980]  to awaken humanity and I salute you all.
[2:00:56.980 --> 2:01:02.340]  Let's go to taking calls here with Dr. Corsi. Let's talk to Terence in Scotland. Terence
[2:01:02.340 --> 2:01:07.900]  thank you for holding. You want to talk about UK cuckolding or the way that they've taken
[2:01:07.900 --> 2:01:11.380]  folks that were historically not easy to roll over. Even the Romans couldn't conquer that
[2:01:11.380 --> 2:01:15.500]  area but but but now just love to be slaves. What's happened?
[2:01:15.500 --> 2:01:21.980]  First off Alex you know it's an absolute pleasure to be on this show and under given circumstances
[2:01:21.980 --> 2:01:27.820]  I wish you was under happier circumstances. Yes I'm very sad about the dead young girls
[2:01:27.820 --> 2:01:33.660]  particularly sickening. Yes even though I live up here in Aberdeen actually not too
[2:01:33.660 --> 2:01:38.460]  far from Donald Trump's lovely golf course I lived in Manchester for eight years as
[2:01:38.460 --> 2:01:43.620]  a student and as a doctor working in the local hospitals there so it's a home from home
[2:01:43.620 --> 2:01:50.620]  and I tell you what after the attack in Westminster Bridge last month I no longer feel shocked
[2:01:50.620 --> 2:01:57.900]  I no longer feel upset. I am seething with anger right now just how in it not just your
[2:01:57.900 --> 2:02:03.620]  leaders and of course your senate and congress are acting but our leaders here not just in
[2:02:03.620 --> 2:02:08.380]  the UK but in Europe are dealing with this problem with the migrant crisis right now.
[2:02:08.380 --> 2:02:12.540]  Well they even preempted the terror attack news last night running Trump in the ground
[2:02:12.540 --> 2:02:16.980]  saying he asked intelligence chiefs you know to tell the public he wasn't a Russian because
[2:02:16.980 --> 2:02:20.420]  they all have the intel he's not a Russian agent that was in the news three months ago
[2:02:20.420 --> 2:02:25.740]  now it's like breaking he obstructed justice with other leaders no he didn't he publicly
[2:02:25.740 --> 2:02:31.260]  said they have the intel release it he is president I guess could he doesn't want to
[2:02:31.260 --> 2:02:36.100]  damage intelligence he has it all he knows Hillary is a Chinese agent on the Russian
[2:02:36.100 --> 2:02:42.020]  payroll and you're absolutely right you know it's just frustrating to see them out to get
[2:02:42.020 --> 2:02:46.220]  Trump out to get nationalism out to try to stop your government finally trying to control
[2:02:46.220 --> 2:02:50.740]  its borders wanting the UK to commit suicide where do you think this is all going as a
[2:02:50.740 --> 2:02:56.220]  medical doctor there in Scotland well first off in terms of the nationalist wave sweeping
[2:02:56.220 --> 2:03:02.020]  not just the states worldwide and it's hitting Western Europe hard ignore what the mainstream
[2:03:02.020 --> 2:03:08.500]  media is saying about you know nationalism dying taking you know a hit to the head with
[2:03:08.500 --> 2:03:14.300]  Macron with good builders then of course you know what happened in Austria in a year that
[2:03:14.300 --> 2:03:19.820]  is absolute bull we know they're stealing the elections it's not just even the elections
[2:03:19.820 --> 2:03:23.980]  they forget to actually look at the numbers if we just look at for example the Netherlands
[2:03:23.980 --> 2:03:28.460]  you know the elections there they said oh good builders he didn't win all of his seats
[2:03:28.460 --> 2:03:33.980]  but he got an improvement and guess what the center left parties got annihilated that's
[2:03:33.980 --> 2:03:38.860]  right the center left and leftist parties are becoming extinct they're having now poses
[2:03:38.860 --> 2:03:43.260]  as kind of nationalist light that'll only work for one season what an amazingly it's
[2:03:43.260 --> 2:03:50.780]  so good to have great collars like you Terence anything else yes first off you know as someone
[2:03:50.780 --> 2:03:55.140]  once said these changes unfortunately may not happen in one cycle and you hit the hammer
[2:03:55.140 --> 2:04:00.260]  right you know you hit the nail on the head Alex it's a two cycle process so give Europe
[2:04:00.260 --> 2:04:06.620]  a chance by the next election cycles nationalism will take over we will defeat these globalists
[2:04:06.620 --> 2:04:11.260]  and I want to finish off with just a glowing endorsement of your products were it not for
[2:04:11.260 --> 2:04:17.380]  the extremely extortionate customs taxes that the EU has put on on American goods for example
[2:04:17.380 --> 2:04:22.540]  if I was to want to buy Californian wine I have to pay a 19% surcharge on your stuff
[2:04:22.540 --> 2:04:28.500]  well I want to buy what I want which is a Ford Mustang I have to pay 34% custom tax on
[2:04:28.500 --> 2:04:33.780]  it that's ridiculous and anyway don't about your products love the water filters I bought
[2:04:33.780 --> 2:04:39.060]  two proprio water filters for my mom dad and of course myself excellent stuff and of course
[2:04:39.060 --> 2:04:43.780]  the super glue no so sorry super blue toothpaste fantastic just don't mention my sister who's
[2:04:43.780 --> 2:04:49.180]  a dentist she's a flow-eyed advocate I don't listen to her so there you go well God bless
[2:04:49.180 --> 2:04:52.380]  you for the plug yeah that's what Trump's mad about is these these tariffs on America
[2:04:52.380 --> 2:04:56.300]  are just insane and they hurt consumers in the UK God bless you Terence thanks for the
[2:04:56.300 --> 2:05:06.140]  support all the perplexities the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects
[2:05:06.140 --> 2:05:10.940]  in their constitution or confederation not from want of honor or virtue so much as from
[2:05:10.940 --> 2:05:15.940]  the downright ignorance of the nature of coin credit and circulation those are the words
[2:05:15.940 --> 2:05:20.780]  of John Adams the second president of the United States are you ignorant of the private
[2:05:20.780 --> 2:05:26.340]  Federal Reserve do you understand the nature of our fiat currency you understand how a private
[2:05:26.340 --> 2:05:31.460]  corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it what
[2:05:31.460 --> 2:05:36.220]  kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people or for
[2:05:36.220 --> 2:05:41.700]  that matter what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money will you be a slave or

[2:08:20.860 --> 2:08:27.980]  yeah I got no friends because they can read the papers
[2:08:27.980 --> 2:08:30.500]  it's crazy to actually be living an Alice Cooper song crank it up
[2:08:30.500 --> 2:08:43.620]  you know though this isn't 30 years ago when the newspapers were all lying about you would
[2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:47.340]  destroy you imagine how bad it was back then now a lot of folks know they're a bunch of
[2:08:47.340 --> 2:08:53.020]  liars but I tell you they tell such intense lies sometimes I read it I go did I really
[2:08:53.020 --> 2:08:57.500]  do that then I go research it and I didn't do it my mom called up a couple months because
[2:08:57.500 --> 2:09:02.220]  she goes did you say Hillary was in a basement murdering and torturing kids and I went no
[2:09:02.220 --> 2:09:07.140]  mom and then I went and saw what Megan Kelly had said and then I went and pulled up the
[2:09:07.140 --> 2:09:10.940]  actual show and I said I don't know if she's killing kids in these basements but now there's
[2:09:10.940 --> 2:09:16.060]  a lot of weird stuff and you know going on in the in the WikiLeaks but I said I sure
[2:09:16.060 --> 2:09:21.740]  know that she funded radical Islam around selling kids into sex slavery murdering women
[2:09:21.740 --> 2:09:28.820]  hundreds of thousands dead Libya Syria overthrown our allies in Egypt I said she's guilty of
[2:09:28.820 --> 2:09:34.180]  that the 500,000 dead kids and the Clinton administration increasing sanctions like five
[2:09:34.180 --> 2:09:40.980]  times even what George Herbert Walker Bush did so yeah she's guilty of that they edited
[2:09:40.980 --> 2:09:49.140]  it and said that I said she was doing it that's how sophisticated the media is they go oh
[2:09:49.140 --> 2:09:52.820]  you ran a report about something at a pizza place I'm like oh yeah that's somebody else's
[2:09:52.820 --> 2:09:57.820]  report I'll retract that then they go oh he retracted that Hillary was killing people
[2:09:57.820 --> 2:10:02.580]  in a basement see they use a retraction to put things onto it you didn't say or you didn't
[2:10:02.580 --> 2:10:06.940]  do that's how and now I'm like oh I can't ever retract anything again because they'll
[2:10:06.940 --> 2:10:12.380]  misrepresent what I retracted which regular news does retractions every day we've done
[2:10:12.380 --> 2:10:18.980]  like three in 22 years so not just no more mr. nice guy I guess we can't do retractions
[2:10:18.980 --> 2:10:22.380]  we have to have like legal agreements where you can't say our attraction was for this
[2:10:22.380 --> 2:10:28.060]  or that or you just make up a bunch of stuff that's why I've challenged Shabani to put
[2:10:28.060 --> 2:10:32.940]  out the settlement they had the media everywhere say I paid a bunch of money that's not true
[2:10:32.940 --> 2:10:38.580]  not a bunch not a I've signed an agreement where I can't say anything I wish I could
[2:10:38.580 --> 2:10:43.020]  tell you where the which way the money was going here and I'm real tempted about breaking
[2:10:43.020 --> 2:10:47.340]  the agreement because they I believe did it with newspapers put out this info fact my
[2:10:47.340 --> 2:10:53.380]  lawyers are sure on it they have sources but let's just say DC and places are very small
[2:10:53.380 --> 2:10:57.140]  very you know very small community so we got Dr. McCullough coming up in a few minutes I
[2:10:57.140 --> 2:11:00.340]  apologize for having to move him an hour and move him late with the terror attack though
[2:11:00.340 --> 2:11:04.060]  obviously big things are happening but the reason I wanted to get him on even though
[2:11:04.060 --> 2:11:08.700]  there was a terror attack obviously yesterday and most posts would cancel a piece on wellness
[2:11:08.700 --> 2:11:13.700]  is this is something we can do something about but I want to be clear I'm not even an enemy
[2:11:13.700 --> 2:11:19.380]  of Islam I'm really upset by the globalist social engineers trying to bring in this incompatible
[2:11:19.380 --> 2:11:26.140]  group to our country and then using the terror attacks to take our freedoms that's really
[2:11:26.140 --> 2:11:31.100]  why the Western elites are bringing this in and the left uses their foot soldiers but
[2:11:31.100 --> 2:11:35.060]  Dr. Corsi I'm going to go to after you're gone here with McCullough it'll be all over
[2:11:35.060 --> 2:11:40.020]  the map but it's okay Jason in Germany and Devin and Trevor and Cindy and a few others
[2:11:40.020 --> 2:11:43.340]  and then I'm going to go to McCullough here in just a few minutes with this new book that
[2:11:43.340 --> 2:11:48.220]  we sell them for store.com that's been highly anticipated and it's a game changer but just
[2:11:48.220 --> 2:11:52.740]  closing comments about what we've seen what we've witnessed in the state of the Trump
[2:11:52.740 --> 2:11:54.740]  administration right now.
[2:11:54.740 --> 2:12:00.100]  Well I think the Trump administration is going to be dramatically benefited by this breath.
[2:12:00.100 --> 2:12:05.460]  Let's face it this is the first time that the world has seen Trump on the world stage
[2:12:05.460 --> 2:12:10.380]  and I think he they're getting a very very favorable image he shined on it didn't he
[2:12:10.380 --> 2:12:15.540]  he looked really good he looked terrific and they and the speeches have been extremely
[2:12:15.540 --> 2:12:22.420]  well received I mean there's no president who's gone to the three major religions on
[2:12:22.420 --> 2:12:29.420]  the site of Islam you know Saudi Arabia which protects the two most sacred geographical
[2:12:29.420 --> 2:12:38.300]  sites in Islam he's gone now to Israel and met with the Jewish state now he's headed
[2:12:38.300 --> 2:12:43.300]  today is in the Vatican he will be meeting with the Pope tomorrow at three major religions
[2:12:43.300 --> 2:12:50.860]  asked to come together to responsibly combat these radicals and Islam wants to say well
[2:12:50.860 --> 2:12:56.540]  if they're terrorists they're not Islam fine well then let's make sure we redefine Islam
[2:12:56.540 --> 2:13:03.860]  and go through a reformation so we can come out of this with a resolve across all three
[2:13:03.860 --> 2:13:10.460]  religions that we're going to do things like destroy ISIS not just denigrate or wear it
[2:13:10.460 --> 2:13:16.580]  down but to destroy it to destroy al-Qaeda to destroy these terrorist groups and make
[2:13:16.580 --> 2:13:22.260]  sure that Iran does not get nuclear weapons and by the way I think North Korea is going
[2:13:22.260 --> 2:13:28.100]  to be right on the agenda as soon as Donald Trump gets back home just briefly expanding
[2:13:28.100 --> 2:13:34.020]  on that Saudi Arabia has been kind of on both sides of the fence with terror funding it
[2:13:34.020 --> 2:13:37.260]  exporting it but also at the same time fighting it because they don't want to get too strong
[2:13:37.260 --> 2:13:41.300]  at home Israel's obviously been very strong overall fighting it the Vatican was normally
[2:13:41.300 --> 2:13:47.220]  anti-radical Islam this current Pope has made a lot of comments about they're not terrorists
[2:13:47.220 --> 2:13:52.700]  they're not bad I hate Europe's Christian roots I mean this current Pope what is going
[2:13:52.700 --> 2:13:59.140]  on with him from your intel well the Pope is a socialist from Argentina and he comes
[2:13:59.140 --> 2:14:06.940]  through the entire Argentinian Catholic Church which was very radically to the left and the
[2:14:06.940 --> 2:14:13.780]  Pope has been more in line with Barack Obama than he is with Donald Trump now the challenge
[2:14:13.780 --> 2:14:19.580]  for the Pope is going to be that Donald Trump has now made it clear that we are not at war
[2:14:19.580 --> 2:14:26.180]  with Islam Islam is accepted and that's something the Pope wants to have happen the Pope is
[2:14:26.180 --> 2:14:34.300]  going to have to really I think come into a bond with the rest of the churches with
[2:14:34.300 --> 2:14:40.620]  you know the Jewish religion with Islamic religion and bring the Catholic religion
[2:14:40.620 --> 2:14:47.180]  along I mean these are major major changes I think the you know the Anglican religion
[2:14:47.180 --> 2:14:56.060]  the whole idea now of getting the UK much more involved in fighting terrorism and we've
[2:14:56.060 --> 2:15:00.980]  got to be clear that what we're fighting is you know this whole issue of radical Islamic
[2:15:00.980 --> 2:15:05.100]  terrorism all right and whether or not you're defining these as soon as they're terrorists
[2:15:05.100 --> 2:15:09.700]  they're not any longer part of Islam well that's too convenient a definition I mean
[2:15:09.700 --> 2:15:13.940]  that causes sectarian violence between she had sitting well let me ask you this and let
[2:15:13.940 --> 2:15:17.620]  you guys we got our next guest I want a few calls but this is all riveting Politico's
[2:15:17.620 --> 2:15:23.220]  even come on said okay Trump did do a real alliance the Saudis are suddenly even apologizing
[2:15:23.220 --> 2:15:28.660]  to US envoys liberal envoys and are now admitting they were behind Al Qaeda and saying we made
[2:15:28.660 --> 2:15:33.700]  a mistake is because they failed is it because they got their butt kicked in Syria what happened
[2:15:33.700 --> 2:15:38.460]  because suddenly the word is the Saudis are actually saying okay we were behind it we
[2:15:38.460 --> 2:15:44.380]  apologize what got them to suddenly roll over to Trump I think this the Saudis realize
[2:15:44.380 --> 2:15:50.780]  that the threat is about to do the same kind of an Arab spring that we saw with the Muslim
[2:15:50.780 --> 2:15:56.820]  brotherhood and the Saudis are fearful for retaining their own kingdom and having the
[2:15:56.820 --> 2:16:03.100]  radicals which they've now nurtured and funded turn against the Saudi government that's the
[2:16:03.100 --> 2:16:12.780]  threat and of Wahhabism it combines effectively with Al Qaeda and ISIS within the Sunnis then
[2:16:12.780 --> 2:16:18.780]  the Saudi Arabian government is at threat of being overthrown and they've seen it happen
[2:16:18.780 --> 2:16:23.780]  they've seen it happen in Libya they've seen it happen in Egypt and now they want to bond
[2:16:23.780 --> 2:16:29.340]  with Egypt and Jordan and the other responsible countries to say we are not going to tolerate
[2:16:29.340 --> 2:16:34.060]  this terrorism any longer and if it's part of Islam we're going to find it as outside
[2:16:34.060 --> 2:16:38.460]  Islam but let's be clear the West behind the scenes wanted to work with radical Islam
[2:16:38.460 --> 2:16:42.500]  the real leverage the Saudis now know is we're not going to work with radical Islam behind
[2:16:42.500 --> 2:16:47.620]  the scenes this is a real war on it you better pick a side right now or we're going to destabilize
[2:16:47.620 --> 2:16:52.140]  you and blow you off the map you can either be modern have the weapons have the technology
[2:16:52.140 --> 2:16:56.380]  be respected you keep playing a double game it's over that's what I've been told of my
[2:16:56.380 --> 2:17:03.980]  army sources yeah and it's also aimed very strong at Iran because Iran is I think you
[2:17:03.980 --> 2:17:10.580]  know also one of the major major factors here of destabilizing the country and that's what
[2:17:10.580 --> 2:17:15.260]  got Saudi Arabia to finally get in line is they're really fearful of Iran yeah and in
[2:17:15.260 --> 2:17:20.460]  fact Iran I think is going to have to take the agreement that President Obama signed
[2:17:20.460 --> 2:17:25.580]  it rip it up because it's not going to be followed the President Trump understands that
[2:17:25.580 --> 2:17:30.260]  we can't give the Iranians 10 years to build nuclear weapons they've got to be stopped
[2:17:30.260 --> 2:17:34.900]  now the two countries that are going to go on the block soon as he comes back I think
[2:17:34.900 --> 2:17:40.660]  our North Korea and Iran and neither one of them are going to be allowed to continue advancing
[2:17:40.660 --> 2:17:46.060]  as rapidly as they are all right clear weapon great points major geo major geopolitical
[2:17:46.060 --> 2:17:50.780]  alignments happening thank you doctor coursey thank you now I thought we had the guest for
[2:17:50.780 --> 2:17:53.860]  most of the hour but he's got to go soon so I'll get the call or something like 40 after
[2:17:53.860 --> 2:17:57.820]  or so it's really great to have him on I probably should just move to another day you know the
[2:17:57.820 --> 2:18:01.500]  whole terror attack situation but this is so important and when I read the book a few
[2:18:01.500 --> 2:18:06.460]  weeks ago I said we've got to carry this I got an advanced copy fat for fuel Dr. Joseph
[2:18:06.460 --> 2:18:11.140]  Merkola New York Times bestselling author of effortless healing a revolutionary diet to
[2:18:11.140 --> 2:18:15.460]  come back cancer boost brainpower increase your energy now as crazy as he pioneered a
[2:18:15.460 --> 2:18:19.740]  lot of this suddenly big studies are out in Silicon Valley was in the news a few months
[2:18:19.740 --> 2:18:26.740]  ago saying they're upset obsessed with the pure fat the uncooked fat the clean fats and
[2:18:26.740 --> 2:18:32.260]  other superfoods to live longer and boost your brain stuff Merkola wrote about decades
[2:18:32.260 --> 2:18:38.020]  ago it's available on Kindle you name it also available at info or store dot com fat for
[2:18:38.020 --> 2:18:42.420]  fuel you may already know all about this but it's great to give to friends and family we're
[2:18:42.420 --> 2:18:46.260]  going to break soon but wow it's got to feel good Dr. Merkola because you are a medical
[2:18:46.260 --> 2:18:52.740]  doctor you've been verified yet again as a trailblazer yes thank you it does feel tremendous
[2:18:52.740 --> 2:18:58.500]  to offer a resource that's so helpful to so many so it's really addresses some major challenges
[2:18:58.500 --> 2:19:02.500]  we have in this country 50% of the people watching this are going to come down with cancer 50%
[2:19:02.500 --> 2:19:08.020]  of the men 40% of the women and that's not skin cancer that's serious cancer it's going
[2:19:08.020 --> 2:19:11.580]  to be the leading cause of death and this is we discuss the strategies and how to get
[2:19:11.580 --> 2:19:16.100]  your body to burn fat as a primary fuel which is one of the most potent interventions you
[2:19:16.100 --> 2:19:21.500]  could have as a foundation to prevent not only cancer but heart disease diabetes and
[2:19:21.500 --> 2:19:29.860]  obesity you know I'm just sitting here reading the back of the book I'm going to skip this
[2:19:29.860 --> 2:19:36.140]  breaks we have more time and going through what you break down in here I remember my
[2:19:36.140 --> 2:19:40.900]  dad who's a physician as well when I was a little kid going this is bull about low fat
[2:19:40.900 --> 2:19:45.740]  diets it's the kind of fat if you want you know clean fat fat that hadn't been burned
[2:19:45.740 --> 2:19:51.740]  that hadn't made the fats you know basically become you know toxic molecules that was the
[2:19:51.740 --> 2:19:56.300]  words he was using when I was a little kid now we have all these technical terms and
[2:19:56.300 --> 2:20:00.660]  so this has been known for a while it just hasn't been popularized I know you were talking
[2:20:00.660 --> 2:20:05.220]  about it 30 years ago so how did my dad 30 something years ago 40 years ago know about
[2:20:05.220 --> 2:20:09.500]  this how did you know about it you've now collated into a book but but again why are
[2:20:09.500 --> 2:20:15.460]  they now suddenly admitting you're right well your dad heads that rare commodity called
[2:20:15.460 --> 2:20:20.100]  common sense and I apparently didn't have it because at the same time your dad understood
[2:20:20.100 --> 2:20:24.300]  and I was clueless and had bought into the low fat myth because it was okay so maybe
[2:20:24.300 --> 2:20:28.020]  you just were doing the low fat thing it's a long time ago but I remember you for a while
[2:20:28.020 --> 2:20:33.940]  saying no no I mean we're talking the 70s and 80s no I definitely woke up in the 90s
[2:20:33.940 --> 2:20:38.740]  but your dad I think understood it long before then and even though the title of the book
[2:20:38.740 --> 2:20:43.900]  is fat for fuel your dad also recognized it's the low quality fat that is probably even
[2:20:43.900 --> 2:20:48.740]  a more pernicious toxin so the industrialized processed vegetable oils you know those will
[2:20:48.740 --> 2:20:53.420]  get you sicker than sugar so it's it's we're talking about high quality because he's also
[2:20:53.420 --> 2:20:59.500]  a chemist he was explaining it when you burn this stuff heated up yes it's not only trans
[2:20:59.500 --> 2:21:05.540]  fats it's the cyclic aldehydes which are now even potentially more toxic than trans fats
[2:21:05.540 --> 2:21:09.100]  that they're now the trans fats are banned these are the so when I read the headline
[2:21:09.100 --> 2:21:14.900]  even of CNN that McDonald's uses plasticizers using breast implants in nuggets how are they
[2:21:14.900 --> 2:21:20.300]  able to get away with that another is now lawsuits about food additives having a grandfather
[2:21:20.300 --> 2:21:27.020]  clause mm-hmm yeah there's a categorization called grass generally recognizes safe and
[2:21:27.020 --> 2:21:32.700]  it and if substances have been around before a specific date they're grandfathered in unless
[2:21:32.700 --> 2:21:37.660]  there's a very compelling scientific evidence to counter that in some cases that's been
[2:21:37.660 --> 2:21:43.780]  the case certainly was with trans fat which is just I think banned or is in the process
[2:21:43.780 --> 2:21:47.700]  of being eliminated from the food and you agree it should be right oh absolutely there's
[2:21:47.700 --> 2:21:52.100]  no question yeah but we've we've known that for probably close to 80 years like Dr. Fred
[2:21:52.100 --> 2:21:56.100]  Kumaro who's still alive at the University of Illinois is this 102 years old is the one
[2:21:56.100 --> 2:21:59.980]  of the original scientists that figured it out in the 30s well I've been erupting here
[2:21:59.980 --> 2:22:03.820]  let's talk about because I'm so excited fat for fuel I'm no beach boy but I got really
[2:22:03.820 --> 2:22:08.020]  unhealthy over 15 years I've kind of lost 60 70 pounds got a lot healthier since then
[2:22:08.020 --> 2:22:13.660]  but by eating you know more uncooked fish a very low-cooked beef you know things like
[2:22:13.660 --> 2:22:17.380]  that having more micronutrients so everything you've been writing about for decades and
[2:22:17.380 --> 2:22:23.460]  I'll go into California pizza kitchen with my children saying we have you know the micronutrients
[2:22:23.460 --> 2:22:28.140]  the superfoods whether that's true or not you know that when even the fast food places
[2:22:28.140 --> 2:22:33.500]  are quasi fast food are trying to sound like Dr. Mercola we're turning some corner yes
[2:22:33.500 --> 2:22:38.420]  we are making progress there's no question and it was you know I realize a long time
[2:22:38.420 --> 2:22:43.100]  ago like you that the solution is really to go directly to the people if you're trying
[2:22:43.100 --> 2:22:46.220]  to do it through the scientific journals and the professional community you're going to
[2:22:46.220 --> 2:22:50.500]  be sabotage because there's too many too many entrenched interests so that's the we have
[2:22:50.500 --> 2:22:56.260]  a similar strategy I reached millions like you do and they eventually the people get
[2:22:56.260 --> 2:23:01.620]  it they they start to become unbrainwashed and manipulated as they are from the traditional
[2:23:01.620 --> 2:23:10.100]  media well let's walk through fat refuel available at infowarstore.com again this is such a beautiful
[2:23:10.100 --> 2:23:15.420]  book so well written goes over it all if you've got family especially that seem like you're
[2:23:15.420 --> 2:23:18.660]  having neurological disorders I don't want to act like I'm a doctor here I just know
[2:23:18.660 --> 2:23:23.820]  that my uncle has epilepsy from a motorcycle accident and he was told 20 years ago by
[2:23:23.820 --> 2:23:31.100]  his doctor you need to have healthy high quality fish oils and other fats that are not toxic
[2:23:31.100 --> 2:23:36.700]  and you know it made him cut his seizures even more than drugs it has been the standard
[2:23:36.700 --> 2:23:41.180]  of care for the treatment of drug resistant seizure disorders for the last 80 years so
[2:23:41.180 --> 2:23:46.140]  this is nothing new it's been around for a long time we just started to recently appreciate
[2:23:46.140 --> 2:23:52.460]  its value in treatment of all other diseases because it really addresses the foundational
[2:23:52.460 --> 2:23:58.220]  issue of most diseases which is dysfunction of the mitochondria which are these cellular
[2:23:58.220 --> 2:24:04.940]  structures that generate energy to your body and so why is that so important and why what
[2:24:04.940 --> 2:24:10.700]  types of fats are good simply because your fat burns more efficiently is less polluted
[2:24:10.700 --> 2:24:14.980]  fuel so that when you burn it is a primary fuel you generate something less reactive
[2:24:14.980 --> 2:24:20.300]  oxygen species which generates secondary less free radicals which is what causes most of
[2:24:20.300 --> 2:24:26.140]  the generation so on one end sugar is really toxic and really bad on the other end clean
[2:24:26.140 --> 2:24:34.220]  uncooked fat is the best well it's the it's not that quite simple it's it's actually
[2:24:34.220 --> 2:24:38.660]  having them in the right ratios for until your body is able to have the metabolic flexibility
[2:24:38.660 --> 2:24:42.700]  to burn either and then one of the things we introduce is to make sure that you have
[2:24:42.700 --> 2:24:46.380]  adequate not excessive protein because not only do you have to pay attention to the quality
[2:24:46.380 --> 2:24:52.060]  of the fat but you have to limit the carbs and and the protein until your body is burning
[2:24:52.060 --> 2:24:55.820]  fat and then you can go on the way I should explain it obviously reading the book is is
[2:24:55.820 --> 2:25:01.060]  like there's got to be a balance between what they call a classic adkins diet or paleo or
[2:25:01.060 --> 2:25:06.420]  whatever you've gone to the science to find the best type of real diet yes because if
[2:25:06.420 --> 2:25:10.100]  you don't cycle this if you just go on straight nutritional ketosis that could be even more
[2:25:10.100 --> 2:25:14.700]  damaging you'll basically starve to death almost and your body will start to deteriorate
[2:25:14.700 --> 2:25:18.380]  so once you once you've transitioned and we discussed how to do that in the book by measuring
[2:25:18.380 --> 2:25:23.060]  the ketones which are these water soluble fats that penetrate really easily to the brain
[2:25:23.060 --> 2:25:28.460]  and nourish your cells really efficiently with less reactive oxygen species once you're
[2:25:28.460 --> 2:25:32.140]  doing that then you can have feast days where you have a lot of healthy carbs like sweet
[2:25:32.140 --> 2:25:36.100]  potatoes today I did some heavy lifting so and I do that two or three times a weekend
[2:25:36.100 --> 2:25:40.180]  those days I have a fairly significant amount of healthy carbs and extra protein to build
[2:25:40.180 --> 2:25:46.260]  muscle mass so it's it's a really easy food choice to integrate into your program and
[2:25:46.260 --> 2:25:50.420]  it really addresses almost every single product degenerative disease we know is a foundational
[2:25:50.420 --> 2:25:55.660]  strategy well that makes sense because I myself and I got really big it's like over 280 pounds
[2:25:55.660 --> 2:26:00.860]  now that'll like 230 something I'm still a big guy but a diet works for a while and
[2:26:00.860 --> 2:26:04.580]  then it stops working and that's what your book gets into you've got to take a spectrum
[2:26:04.580 --> 2:26:08.940]  of natural diets and then cycle through them because that's the only thing that's constant
[2:26:08.940 --> 2:26:15.740]  is change yeah this is not a standard set of rules that we recommend for everyone is
[2:26:15.740 --> 2:26:20.220]  this really guidelines and within those guidelines you customize it according to your strategy
[2:26:20.220 --> 2:26:25.260]  like so for the 70% of the people in the country are overweight they may want to integrate
[2:26:25.260 --> 2:26:29.940]  other metabolic strategies which is just fasting and intermittent fasting and even going down
[2:26:29.940 --> 2:26:34.940]  to fast for three five seven days maybe even longer can jump start the process at which
[2:26:34.940 --> 2:26:39.100]  your body starts to burn fantasies primary feeling can be a very powerful and really
[2:26:39.100 --> 2:26:42.980]  inexpensive intervention doesn't cost anything to 90 well here's my problem with fasting
[2:26:42.980 --> 2:26:48.060]  I've done it three four days at a time I get I've never been into drugs or anything I get
[2:26:48.060 --> 2:26:52.860]  hired in a kite and start bouncing off the walls about day three or four yeah well usually
[2:26:52.860 --> 2:26:57.100]  most people have trouble about day two or three but it gets easier after that but then
[2:26:57.100 --> 2:27:04.460]  you can go back on having food so fast fasting is voluntary starvation is not not you had
[2:27:04.460 --> 2:27:08.740]  the total flexibility to eat food whenever you I mean as you said studying history I
[2:27:08.740 --> 2:27:13.540]  know you're right you you've written about this for humans humans are normally feast
[2:27:13.540 --> 2:27:18.780]  or famine right we're not supposed to just always have a ton of food or always we only
[2:27:18.780 --> 2:27:25.980]  recently have had access to food 24 seven for the vast majority of human existence we've
[2:27:25.980 --> 2:27:32.340]  had really significant amounts of times where we didn't have access to food so our genetics
[2:27:32.340 --> 2:27:39.140]  or biochemistry or metabolism is designed for that to really have that intermittent
[2:27:39.140 --> 2:27:44.580]  types of approaches with with calories and eating so if you eat continuously as most
[2:27:44.580 --> 2:27:49.060]  people do that shifts your metabolism to really burning carbohydrates or glycogen is your
[2:27:49.060 --> 2:27:55.940]  primary fuel source which has enormous about enormous metabolic adverse consequences well
[2:27:55.940 --> 2:28:02.820]  doc the book is fat for fuel and I've read I don't know hundreds of news articles about
[2:28:02.820 --> 2:28:07.300]  the best type of diets and seven or eight books about it and I gotta tell you the reason
[2:28:07.300 --> 2:28:12.060]  I love the book is is it isn't one diet it isn't one formula it's a spectrum of the science
[2:28:12.060 --> 2:28:17.140]  and what works for people to decide with their own metabolic system their own family history
[2:28:17.140 --> 2:28:20.700]  what works best for them and that's why I think it's the book I think you've written
[2:28:20.700 --> 2:28:26.980]  out of thousands of books the book out there well it's not just that I wrote it this most
[2:28:26.980 --> 2:28:31.060]  books are written by one author and is there impressions and ideas right it's a big research
[2:28:31.060 --> 2:28:36.740]  document but what I did was I sent it out to two dozen of the top experts in the world
[2:28:36.740 --> 2:28:41.620]  in this area so it's really peer reviewed it's a consensus it's not just my ideas this
[2:28:41.620 --> 2:28:47.780]  is the science is really valid and accurate and it's and it's it's rock solid so you
[2:28:47.780 --> 2:28:51.900]  know they're going to get major benefits by doing this and it's and it's there's a consensus
[2:28:51.900 --> 2:28:57.140]  among the scientific researchers and in recommending this type of approach all right we're gonna
[2:28:57.140 --> 2:28:59.820]  go to break when we got like 10 more minutes left with you when we come back I'm gonna
[2:28:59.820 --> 2:29:04.220]  go to phone calls but again Dr. Mercola I don't need to introduce you to folks most
[2:29:04.220 --> 2:29:07.940]  people know who you are when we come back we're talking more about the book but also
[2:29:07.940 --> 2:29:15.220]  briefly the state of the fight to have supplements vitamins minerals nutrients because I see
[2:29:15.220 --> 2:29:20.820]  so much demonization more than ever against even mainline supplements I've even had news
[2:29:20.820 --> 2:29:25.820]  articles demonizing us now for selling organic shampoo they're even demonizing selling shampoo
[2:29:25.820 --> 2:29:30.300]  now so this seems to be like a new level of kind of the empire strikes back seem like
[2:29:30.300 --> 2:29:35.740]  for a while people like you were leading the fight to win you know to get geo GMO labeling
[2:29:35.740 --> 2:29:40.500]  and to wake up and I think because you're winning so big they're now counter striking
[2:29:40.500 --> 2:29:49.060]  I want to see if you think I'm right straight ahead I'm Alex Jones Dr. Mercola stay with
[2:29:49.060 --> 2:30:00.340]  us we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network December
[2:30:00.340 --> 2:30:07.020]  23rd 1776 these are the times that try men's souls the summer soldier and the sunshine
[2:30:07.020 --> 2:30:11.300]  patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands
[2:30:11.300 --> 2:30:17.180]  by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily
[2:30:17.180 --> 2:30:21.420]  conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the heart of the conflict the more
[2:30:21.420 --> 2:30:27.260]  glorious the triumph what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly it is dearness only that
[2:30:27.260 --> 2:30:32.140]  gives everything its value heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods and it
[2:30:32.140 --> 2:30:37.500]  would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated
[2:30:37.500 --> 2:30:42.300]  Britain with an army to enforce her tyranny has declared that she has a right not only
[2:30:42.300 --> 2:30:48.460]  to tax but to bind us in all cases whatsoever and if being bound in that matter is not slavery
[2:30:48.460 --> 2:30:53.180]  then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth even the expression is impious for so
[2:30:53.180 --> 2:31:00.460]  unlimited a power can only belong to god thomas pain the american crisis in bricks essentials
[2:31:00.460 --> 2:31:07.340]  that's my middle name i've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand

[2:31:24.540 --> 2:31:29.260]  they have led us basically keep their well-known packaging it is an answer to prayer and because

[2:33:26.780 --> 2:33:30.620]  mccullough who's got riveting information leaves us in about 10 minutes i'm gonna go right to your
[2:33:30.620 --> 2:33:36.940]  calls and i've got some other breaking news it's exclusive info wars dot com kim dot com
[2:33:38.620 --> 2:33:42.620]  was able to predict what wiki leach was gonna put out roger stone was not i'm not putting
[2:33:42.620 --> 2:33:47.100]  roger stone down i know what roger stone said i know what roger stone was saying behind the scenes
[2:33:47.100 --> 2:33:51.820]  roger stone was not involved wiki leach because i was having the private discussions he's like
[2:33:52.380 --> 2:33:56.300]  yeah i know a couple reporters that are going to interview him that i talked to roger talks to
[2:33:56.300 --> 2:34:00.380]  more reporters anybody i know and he said i'm going to try to find out what it is they claim
[2:34:00.380 --> 2:34:04.860]  they've got asans kept saying i've got the big bombshell i've got the big bombshell for six
[2:34:04.860 --> 2:34:14.860]  months you know before it came out right before the rnc and so roger had the reporters go there
[2:34:14.860 --> 2:34:19.740]  there and they called him back and said yeah you know it's about this and that but but that's
[2:34:19.740 --> 2:34:25.660]  the connection it's not russians everybody's trying to talk to asans i mean he goes on fox news
[2:34:25.660 --> 2:34:30.380]  he goes on seeing in it's just like oh but roger talked to some reporters that talked to him and
[2:34:30.380 --> 2:34:36.460]  sent a message in so he's a russian agent but kim dot com who i'm a big fan of and who was
[2:34:36.460 --> 2:34:40.220]  gonna come on the show and had some family emergency once and he thought i was dissing him
[2:34:40.220 --> 2:34:45.740]  not being nervous so he canceled i want to get him dot com on because i followed kim's tweets and kim
[2:34:46.860 --> 2:34:51.020]  did predict everything that happened and he does have the connections i know folks
[2:34:51.580 --> 2:34:56.620]  high up and say oh that's the guy to talk to quote i know seth rich was involved in dnc leaks
[2:34:56.620 --> 2:35:03.500]  internet gurus says rich wanted to drain the swamp from the inside both parties and they killed him
[2:35:03.500 --> 2:35:11.020]  so this is crazy going back to dr mercola he's got the new book fat for fuel available at info
[2:35:11.020 --> 2:35:14.940]  war store dot com that way you support him you support us you support yourself now i want to
[2:35:14.940 --> 2:35:19.900]  warn you it's easy to read but it is like a textbook i mean it's it's it's it's i don't
[2:35:19.900 --> 2:35:25.420]  say textbook for dummies but it covers every subject every angle this is something doctors
[2:35:25.420 --> 2:35:30.860]  should read because this really i think is the key of solemn when it comes to decoding the different
[2:35:30.860 --> 2:35:37.020]  paradoxes that are out there of protein fat uh different imbalances uh everything you know the
[2:35:37.020 --> 2:35:44.220]  ramp up the way to ease in managing your emotions during transition because here's the deal i can
[2:35:44.220 --> 2:35:50.220]  quit eating carbohydrates and stuff and then i turn into a not even a mean maniac i'm like
[2:35:50.220 --> 2:35:55.500]  worse than i am now bouncing off the walls so no wonder they want to solve it a bunch of crap
[2:35:55.500 --> 2:36:00.140]  because we're more manageable that way uh and the power of being a real human is pretty amazing
[2:36:00.140 --> 2:36:04.540]  so it's all there the power of fasting dr mercola i want to talk about your book and closing but
[2:36:04.540 --> 2:36:08.700]  first uh again thank you for coming on the broadcast stand for your great work what about
[2:36:08.700 --> 2:36:15.580]  the big picture i was mentioning before the break well we are making progress so we need to
[2:36:15.580 --> 2:36:21.900]  recognize that i think the most recent observation is that california as you probably covered in your
[2:36:21.900 --> 2:36:29.580]  broadcast earlier uh has actually put the poison label on roundup and it's required that uh
[2:36:29.580 --> 2:36:33.100]  in the state of california so that not to give credit but you've been pushing them for that for
[2:36:33.100 --> 2:36:37.740]  20 years well i don't know about 20 years but certainly for a long time most of this century
[2:36:37.740 --> 2:36:43.020]  for sure but i mean you were you were like the first online with this stuff in like i remember
[2:36:43.020 --> 2:36:50.620]  your 94 95 right yeah yeah yeah so we've been we've been at it for a while actually you know
[2:36:50.620 --> 2:36:57.340]  that my epiphany with the pernicious nature of glyphosate and roundup really didn't occur until
[2:36:57.340 --> 2:37:03.100]  the early 2000s uh but there are there are other major advocates out like steven druker who is a
[2:37:03.100 --> 2:37:08.220]  an attorney who filed a lawsuit against the fda to sure it's not about credit the point is we've
[2:37:08.220 --> 2:37:14.140]  all been at the tip of the spear we're being vindicated we're being proven right right as it's
[2:37:14.140 --> 2:37:18.860]  good to know that as long as people have the knowledge information we still this is a free
[2:37:18.860 --> 2:37:23.180]  country we have freedom of choice we vote with our pocketbooks and that is enormous potential
[2:37:23.180 --> 2:37:26.460]  sure sure and when i'm giving you credit i know you're not a big ego guy it's not about oh you're
[2:37:26.460 --> 2:37:31.180]  you're this wonder wonder man you help with your organization and your listeners your supporters
[2:37:31.180 --> 2:37:35.180]  spearhead labeling all over the country i mean let's give you and your listeners and everybody
[2:37:35.180 --> 2:37:41.180]  the credit you know the point is we're getting things done yes we are yeah and there's a reason
[2:37:41.180 --> 2:37:45.980]  reason for you know i recognized i could preach to the world all i want just like you're doing but
[2:37:45.980 --> 2:37:52.540]  unless we organize and coalesce into some type of effective uh political health activism that we
[2:37:52.540 --> 2:37:58.220]  couldn't these barriers that were in place by most of these uh corrupted federal regulatory
[2:37:58.220 --> 2:38:03.180]  agencies would impair the average person from being able to implement what we're seeking to
[2:38:03.180 --> 2:38:08.860]  teach them so we're trying to break down those barriers and make it easy for everyone wow so
[2:38:08.860 --> 2:38:12.940]  do you think overall we're starting to win or i mean how is the empire striking back because it
[2:38:12.940 --> 2:38:17.500]  seems to be well there's there's a lot of fronts out there and i think we're making major progress
[2:38:17.500 --> 2:38:21.260]  on many of them there's no doubt in my mind and some of them were losing ground but at least
[2:38:21.260 --> 2:38:27.100]  we're not losing it as fast as we would if we weren't in the battle so um it's it's a why there's a
[2:38:27.100 --> 2:38:33.420]  lot of work to do out there we're just happy to give people the tools like fat for fuel that can
[2:38:33.420 --> 2:38:37.980]  essentially give them the freedom and insulate them from all this pernicious information they're
[2:38:37.980 --> 2:38:44.060]  getting so they don't have to suffer needlessly and die prematurely unnecessarily i mean and you
[2:38:44.060 --> 2:38:49.900]  know that it's it just breaks my heart to see kids dying from cancer there's just no damn need for it
[2:38:49.900 --> 2:38:55.740]  we have 15 1600 people die every day in the united states let me ask a few quick questions here
[2:38:55.740 --> 2:39:00.140]  you're a medical doctor and a pioneer exposing this i mean depending on the cancer pediatric
[2:39:00.140 --> 2:39:05.500]  cancer is up like 10 000 percent from the 1940s uh all these other cancers are exploding um
[2:39:06.700 --> 2:39:12.540]  and they never talk about why are they increasing but you know a lot of those answers well there's
[2:39:12.540 --> 2:39:18.300]  no one simple answer to that one this is many variables that contribute to it what is not
[2:39:18.300 --> 2:39:22.620]  burning fat for fuel there's no question but it's also the exposure of these many pernicious
[2:39:22.620 --> 2:39:29.420]  toxins and one of the most widely and pervasive one is uh microwave radiation from your cell
[2:39:29.420 --> 2:39:34.220]  phone towers your cell phones and your wi-fi router so that's a big one and you know in conjunction
[2:39:34.220 --> 2:39:41.260]  with toxic food and other toxins they're exposed to in our environment uh it can really in infections
[2:39:41.260 --> 2:39:50.540]  it can it can really play uh wreak havoc on your metabolism and your health now a few other
[2:39:50.540 --> 2:39:58.300]  final questions i remember the headline on marcolla.com it's got to be i don't know about 15 years ago or
[2:39:58.300 --> 2:40:10.140]  something and the headline was uh i've probably got the exact headline in my mind i i i think it
[2:40:10.140 --> 2:40:17.340]  was something like uh soft drinks uh non-sugar soft drinks make you fat well now that's mainstream
[2:40:17.340 --> 2:40:22.780]  news all over the place that it's not just making you fat it's eating your brain let me just point
[2:40:22.780 --> 2:40:28.780]  something out alex the challenge you just had there uh for a moment in in your memory and also
[2:40:28.780 --> 2:40:32.700]  the cravings that you have when you go off of carbohydrates are a reflection that you're not
[2:40:32.700 --> 2:40:38.220]  burning fat as your primary fuel because you only have a limited amount of sugar in your body it
[2:40:38.220 --> 2:40:42.140]  literally about five percent of your fuel in your body is stored as glycogen in your muscles in your
[2:40:42.140 --> 2:40:48.620]  in your liver and when you exhaust that in about 12 hours and you can't burn fat you're going to
[2:40:48.620 --> 2:40:53.580]  be below on fuel so you'll have all these symptoms with these cravings because your body needs fuel
[2:40:53.580 --> 2:40:57.340]  and it can't access the fat because you haven't taught it how to do it yet so that's what that's
[2:40:57.340 --> 2:41:01.260]  what this whole book is designed to have you access it and the beautiful thing was once you are
[2:41:01.260 --> 2:41:06.380]  burning fat as your primary fuel you have this incredible mental clarity that just is an unbelievable
[2:41:06.380 --> 2:41:10.860]  your memory you just don't forget things anymore absolutely because you're i mean your body by
[2:41:10.860 --> 2:41:15.820]  doing occasional fasting the cravings disappear these cravings for junk foods they're just gone
[2:41:15.820 --> 2:41:20.540]  they are just not existent you don't have to have iron willpower discipline to implement the program
[2:41:20.540 --> 2:41:25.820]  you know once you burn fat as your primary fuel well i was interrupting there uh and to be specific
[2:41:25.820 --> 2:41:30.940]  i do get absent minded or i do forget things they had a seed in there running audio into my head
[2:41:30.940 --> 2:41:34.140]  that's why i was unable to think of it because i was hearing somebody else talk it was driving
[2:41:34.140 --> 2:41:39.100]  crazy but sometimes i do forget things and have brain parts but but i mean get back to this repeat
[2:41:39.100 --> 2:41:44.300]  we were saying because i interrupted about once you learn how to access fat by fasting or the
[2:41:44.300 --> 2:41:49.020]  certain diets you have in the book uh fat for fuel while all the studies the research show
[2:41:49.020 --> 2:41:54.380]  it creates this incredible clarity why does it do that uh please repeat that well it does it because
[2:41:54.380 --> 2:41:58.460]  and you don't you but you don't you teach your body you encourage it and you so that it really
[2:41:58.460 --> 2:42:03.740]  adapts to have this metabolic flexibility to burn either fat or carbohydrates 95 percent of people
[2:42:03.740 --> 2:42:08.380]  in the country can only burn carbohydrates as the fuel and they can't access it but when you do
[2:42:08.380 --> 2:42:13.580]  these ketones burn very efficiently they create less free radicals and they are water soluble
[2:42:13.580 --> 2:42:18.540]  fats that easily penetrate into the brain and provide them the fuel that works it's just why
[2:42:18.540 --> 2:42:23.340]  this type of approach is used for drug resistance seizure disorders and it saved many children's
[2:42:23.340 --> 2:42:28.380]  and adults lives by going on it because it nourishes the brain in a way that it was designed to be
[2:42:28.380 --> 2:42:33.980]  nourished because historically and through ancient times we've gone through these periods of stress
[2:42:33.980 --> 2:42:37.740]  so there are our answers has all had this metabolic flexibility and that they could nourish their
[2:42:37.740 --> 2:42:42.620]  brain with these ketones and these ketones are not the same that you get in diabetic keto acidosis
[2:42:42.620 --> 2:42:48.220]  that many people are concerned about it's two different animals that's that's a it is you know
[2:42:48.220 --> 2:42:51.900]  i think atkins helped to spell that myth but this is it's a completely different approach
[2:42:51.900 --> 2:42:56.220]  in macons it's high quality food it's relatively i was about to say that a few times i've done diets
[2:42:56.220 --> 2:43:01.180]  like this i can't handle how awake i am and how great my brain works it's almost like too much
[2:43:01.900 --> 2:43:05.260]  it really is great you don't you almost don't need the artificial stimulants or the
[2:43:05.260 --> 2:43:11.740]  neutropic because uh uh it's just an amazing transition and shift that occurs when your body
[2:43:11.740 --> 2:43:16.860]  is functioning the way it was designed to it's just it's it's nothing short of miraculous it really
[2:43:16.860 --> 2:43:22.220]  is what you what you optimize your fuel fuel strategy all right dr. micola thank you so much
[2:43:22.220 --> 2:43:27.660]  for the book fat for fuel and i really appreciate the deep research you've done into it god bless you
[2:43:27.660 --> 2:43:32.460]  all right all right there he goes the book is available at infowarstore.com and listen
[2:43:33.020 --> 2:43:37.420]  i don't have a lot of people on about books anymore and i don't even go and get a lot of
[2:43:37.420 --> 2:43:43.020]  books and sell them used to we'd be selling you know maybe 70 80 a hundred books a year or more
[2:43:43.020 --> 2:43:51.100]  we might sell 10 books a year now because i still read a lot but i already know most of it and i
[2:43:51.100 --> 2:43:58.540]  figure you do too this book really made me think about things and it's kind of like working out
[2:43:58.540 --> 2:44:02.460]  you do something for a while then you change it and you mix it up that's how you get real change
[2:44:02.460 --> 2:44:08.300]  that's how you have successful things happen in your life you get in this kind of homeostasis you
[2:44:08.300 --> 2:44:13.260]  think it was good in your life but it's actually stagnation it's about shaking it up and i intend
[2:44:13.260 --> 2:44:18.780]  to start doing some fasting because that's something i can actually do and i've done it before and it
[2:44:18.780 --> 2:44:24.780]  does a lot of amazing just amazing things the issue is i can't be here at work because fasting
[2:44:24.780 --> 2:44:31.020]  and working does not mix well i get pretty angry but if i'm hanging out at home or you know just
[2:44:31.020 --> 2:44:34.780]  do it stuff with the children it's not as big a deal as long as i can drink water and deal with
[2:44:34.780 --> 2:44:41.260]  the stomach ache i get day two but uh the brain certainly works a lot better than when you're
[2:44:41.260 --> 2:44:45.900]  fat dumb and happy that's why they've got terms like that okay i want to go to jason in germany

[2:49:31.500 --> 2:49:35.820]  and i love it i would actually buy more except as the guy from scotland said you just almost
[2:49:35.820 --> 2:49:39.260]  can't get it here in fact they that customs they won't even give it to me so i have to go state
[2:49:39.260 --> 2:49:44.380]  side actually re-up um oh yeah i mean that's another problem that's killed us we still ship
[2:49:44.380 --> 2:49:49.260]  overseas 20 30 percent of the stuff we ship overseas then we don't even get a letter back
[2:49:49.260 --> 2:49:54.940]  they just tear it open steal it throw it the trash we've been told this by customs agents overseas
[2:49:54.940 --> 2:49:58.700]  i mean they're out to get us that's why i stopped ordering i didn't want to put you guys through
[2:49:58.700 --> 2:50:02.700]  that but um also real quick i wrote an article i don't know if you guys take user submissions but
[2:50:02.700 --> 2:50:08.380]  i sent that to both the writers and uh show tips at info wars dot com if you guys are able to review
[2:50:08.380 --> 2:50:12.780]  that um real quick about the terror attack i think it's important to understand exactly what we're
[2:50:12.780 --> 2:50:18.140]  dealing with here and it's just like you said earlier it's trauma-based mind control that's what it is
[2:50:19.340 --> 2:50:26.060]  and explain that to people uh well i think the elite are using terror as a way to make us feel
[2:50:26.060 --> 2:50:31.580]  helpless and then basically put us in a position to beg them for their 1984 style control grid which
[2:50:31.580 --> 2:50:37.260]  ironically will actually not even keep us safe or just as bad make us feel outraged enough to
[2:50:37.260 --> 2:50:42.540]  actually take it to the streets and then use that as a pretext for bringing in a draconian
[2:50:42.540 --> 2:50:46.620]  kind of surveillance state and uh we need to be careful not to play into that because that is the
[2:50:46.620 --> 2:50:51.020]  game they're playing and there are many ways to skin a cat and we are the cat in this situation
[2:50:51.020 --> 2:50:54.620]  all right well hey send us a resume you should be a radio host for us i'm about to launch a

[2:51:16.540 --> 2:51:21.020]  crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term allergies from a single
[2:51:21.020 --> 2:51:25.900]  cyber attack when the chaos from any one of these threats arises the government knows it can't

[2:54:14.300 --> 2:54:18.700]  london i'll have a lot more on the bombing the attack and again we know the global story
[2:54:18.700 --> 2:54:23.260]  with islam we know they're bringing him in it's just to watch the media cover it up
[2:54:23.260 --> 2:54:27.580]  and then demonize anybody that exposes it and then act like it's our fault because we don't
[2:54:27.580 --> 2:54:33.900]  submit to islam this is happening it just makes me angry and i don't want to kill the muslims i
[2:54:33.900 --> 2:54:38.860]  don't want to be in wars with them but our governments overthrow the secular governments
[2:54:38.860 --> 2:54:43.500]  and then put the baddies in so i hope saudi arabia has turned some corner with trump
[2:54:43.500 --> 2:54:49.900]  if trump delivers i'll be happy to be dead and i'm gonna hate him but it all remains to be seen

[2:54:55.980 --> 2:54:59.740]  yeah basically what well we have to also look at this attack
[2:55:00.380 --> 2:55:05.820]  this is the fact that basically basically they actually warned hope they keep telling us that
[2:55:05.820 --> 2:55:10.780]  basically this is all going to happen and it just keeps happening it's almost like
[2:55:10.780 --> 2:55:17.500]  it's almost like having someone say i'm gonna do this this this and and that's right outside
[2:55:17.500 --> 2:55:22.380]  and i just say you're letting us in we're going to kill you when they do kill us our government
[2:55:22.380 --> 2:55:26.620]  says don't worry we'll teach schoolgirls how to wear her jibs that'll fix it so what do you
[2:55:26.620 --> 2:55:31.100]  think's happening i think it's mass mind control trauma-based mind control like the last caller
[2:55:31.100 --> 2:55:39.580]  from germany said and that's exactly what it is god bless you brian you know i'll tell you
[2:55:39.580 --> 2:55:42.940]  you know i was thinking about the last caller i was saying hey you're in germany i'm gonna send
[2:55:42.940 --> 2:55:46.700]  you a free bottle of something for holding over an hour it's a good promo on air but also i feel
[2:55:46.700 --> 2:55:50.780]  bad for folks that have been holding too long and i want to encourage good callers to call in
[2:55:50.780 --> 2:55:55.020]  and it's uncool what i do sometimes let's just be honest but i get caught up in the time and the
[2:55:55.020 --> 2:56:00.300]  gas and everything else i was thinking about why did i ever get an amazon account even though they
[2:56:00.300 --> 2:56:04.860]  bend you over the barrel and make you pay them huge percentages it's not even profitable and it's
[2:56:04.860 --> 2:56:10.620]  because we never have problems shipping amazon packages into russia or into germany or into
[2:56:10.620 --> 2:56:18.140]  japan or into mexico or into wherever but canada and the e u really are horrible and they put they
[2:56:18.140 --> 2:56:23.260]  grab your stuff and make you come get it from customs with a 90 mark up america doesn't do
[2:56:23.260 --> 2:56:28.220]  that to other people's stuff it's so uncool to that extent that you know there's some tariffs
[2:56:28.220 --> 2:56:35.500]  some regulations i just thought that's why i should be on amazon but see amazon's the globalist
[2:56:35.500 --> 2:56:41.500]  it's the big company it gives money to the foreign governments it's liberal so it gets to ship in and
[2:56:41.500 --> 2:56:48.620]  not get torn open and not have all the fees added on most of the time because we'll fill out the forms
[2:56:48.620 --> 2:56:54.140]  right we'll do it all we'll do it through fedex you name it they tear it open a third of the time
[2:56:54.140 --> 2:57:04.300]  they steal it and don't even send it back to us so i just throw product up against a wall
[2:57:05.100 --> 2:57:12.700]  but i still just do it i'm pigheaded but maybe i should just roll over to amazon to be anti gun
[2:57:12.700 --> 2:57:21.020]  anti family chop my balls off just worship world government i mean i i'm sorry to talk like that
[2:57:21.020 --> 2:57:27.340]  it's just at a certain point it's just why are the people running things so uncool because they're
[2:57:27.340 --> 2:57:32.860]  greedy bastards that's why dan in indiana thanks for holding her on the air
[2:57:35.500 --> 2:57:43.740]  hello hey brother yeah yeah uh i want to say this is dan sand this is not alex jones or um
[2:57:43.740 --> 2:57:53.420]  um president trump but it is time for eye for eye and uh let god sort out the the terrorists from
[2:57:53.420 --> 2:58:00.620]  the innocent because it's time for the british people to get up some balls and go out there and
[2:58:00.620 --> 2:58:09.820]  start lynching these bastards well i know this your phone's breaking up real bad but i hear
[2:58:09.820 --> 2:58:14.540]  what you're saying how about just go out with the known islamic leaders calling for violence how about
[2:58:14.540 --> 2:58:25.340]  that and show them hard they need to go out and be men and and and take some swords or whatever they
[2:58:25.340 --> 2:58:32.140]  have and fight to the fence you know because they could be walked all over no i hear you dan and i
[2:58:32.140 --> 2:58:36.220]  mean i'm not saying we should do that but the point is if the government doesn't respond it's
[2:58:36.220 --> 2:58:45.500]  going to lead to that point dan thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[2:58:49.820 --> 2:58:54.300]  not a group you develop living defense for us it took you over a year to do it why is this so good
[2:58:54.300 --> 2:59:00.220]  because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most i mean i try
[2:59:00.220 --> 2:59:06.060]  to make sure that i don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but right now
[2:59:06.060 --> 2:59:12.060]  we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off
[2:59:12.060 --> 2:59:18.460]  a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around we have biological warfare
[2:59:18.460 --> 2:59:22.380]  going on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many
[2:59:22.380 --> 2:59:27.660]  things that are in it you have the neem in there you have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood
[2:59:27.660 --> 2:59:32.060]  i recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right well i'm glad we've got
[2:59:32.060 --> 2:59:35.900]  some back in because i'm going back on it today it just came back in yesterday living defense

[2:59:48.300 --> 3:00:14.940]  again it's not the muslims it's this big
[3:00:14.940 --> 3:00:26.620]  collapse this big setup this big waging war on kura clash it's alex jones coming to you live
[3:00:26.620 --> 3:00:32.540]  from the front lines of the info war i mean who could think this up like aliens that run the
[3:00:32.540 --> 3:00:37.180]  planet it's like a crazy video game where there's a planet and then you give like super backwards
[3:00:37.180 --> 3:00:41.740]  people that have women as slaves and run sex slavery half the oil on the planet and the
[3:00:41.740 --> 3:00:46.620]  british find it and then make them the richest people in the world and then now they're like
[3:00:46.620 --> 3:00:49.900]  sending out people all over the world as missionaries that blow you up and kill you
[3:00:51.980 --> 3:00:56.140]  and look other orthodox religions have done bad things as well i don't want to kill muslims
[3:00:57.180 --> 3:01:01.820]  i just know that our governments are working with them and allowing this to happen and it's
[3:01:01.820 --> 3:01:07.900]  wrong and those of us that criticize it are attacked i used to be brainwashed 15 years ago
[3:01:07.900 --> 3:01:13.100]  and get mad if you criticize muslims i knew they were backward and had problems but i didn't want
[3:01:13.100 --> 3:01:17.100]  to go bomb them and stuff i guess i was right because that stirred them up but there was a
[3:01:17.100 --> 3:01:22.460]  larger plan the same people bombing them or the ones putting the radicals in charge and then opening
[3:01:22.460 --> 3:01:29.260]  our borders up to them so what's the big master plan trevor in canada then cindy in pennsylvania
[3:01:29.260 --> 3:01:38.700]  trevor on the air hey i just want to chat about how on earth you refer uh have a reformation in
[3:01:38.700 --> 3:01:44.620]  islam when uh the roots of it are so poised how do you like there's been reformations like the
[3:01:44.620 --> 3:01:49.580]  taliban al-qaeda and all that stuff i don't understand how you can reform something that
[3:01:49.580 --> 3:01:54.140]  has poisoned the roots to it now i hear you i mean i gotta be honest with you
[3:01:54.140 --> 3:01:59.020]  um so what do we do i mean you got a billion and a half of these people what do you do
[3:02:00.700 --> 3:02:06.220]  that's the real question uh at least something you gotta you know uh anything that doesn't
[3:02:06.220 --> 3:02:11.660]  coincide with western value is something that shouldn't be around well here's the deal they
[3:02:11.660 --> 3:02:16.700]  could have their countries it's just that they're obsessed with taking everything over that's why
[3:02:16.700 --> 3:02:21.420]  they're constantly killing each other because they're not an open free society then they use
[3:02:21.420 --> 3:02:25.980]  our openness and our freedom to ally with the left to then try to get rid of our openness
[3:02:25.980 --> 3:02:31.500]  and freedom it's just there's no logic to the feminists and people except they're just a bunch
[3:02:31.500 --> 3:02:38.220]  of white flag cowards well no kidding look they're with them promoting the the hijab and everything
[3:02:38.220 --> 3:02:43.980]  when uh the hijab's origins were to differentiate between your wives and your sexually i don't
[3:02:43.980 --> 3:02:48.300]  understand how they could promote something like that as a feminine so-called that's right for folks
[3:02:48.300 --> 3:02:51.260]  that don't know the history why don't you tell them about the difference between a wife and a sex
[3:02:51.260 --> 3:02:59.260]  slave who or what uh i forget which is wish i believe it was uh uh sex slaves at war that i
[3:02:59.260 --> 3:03:04.300]  can't remember off the top of my head to be honest but uh either way it's a symbol of oppression and
[3:03:04.300 --> 3:03:10.060]  i don't understand uh especially what what what it's uh referring to between differentiating
[3:03:10.060 --> 3:03:15.580]  between wives and sex slaves well imagine if a black guy or a spanish guy or a white guy christian
[3:03:15.580 --> 3:03:20.620]  whatever said you're gonna wear a hood over your head i'm gonna cut your genitals off people put
[3:03:20.620 --> 3:03:26.860]  you in prison you'd say oh he had his wife as a slave what i mean it's like ridiculous we
[3:03:26.860 --> 3:03:34.380]  should reject it thank you trevor great points cindy and pennsylvania are on the air hi hi alex

[3:03:41.980 --> 3:03:48.540]  bravery that man has he does i think we all we all need to get behind him i've been racking my brain
[3:03:48.540 --> 3:03:54.700]  because he's in so much danger i mean i watched him with the frustration in him it just made me
[3:03:54.700 --> 3:04:04.700]  cry but i had one idea of a t-shirt tommy robinson with a picture of his face with it begins with one
[3:04:04.700 --> 3:04:10.380]  i'm not a rich person but if i was i would put that out and with robinson doesn't the

[3:04:33.660 --> 3:04:39.660]  it begins with one tommy robinson he needs bodyguards or something i i fear for his safety
[3:04:39.660 --> 3:04:44.300]  he's been in prison they beat him up he gets it i mean the guys it's crazy i mean let me tell you
[3:04:44.300 --> 3:04:49.420]  something i one reason i started becoming anti islam was going to europe and england and man
[3:04:49.420 --> 3:04:53.900]  they just get in your face like you are a dog because they're so used to the brits rolling over
[3:04:54.620 --> 3:04:58.300]  and i'm just like what on earth paul watson's coming up speaking of the brits
[3:04:59.740 --> 3:05:03.740]  staunch anti federalist patrick kenry was opposed to the constitution fearing it would
[3:05:03.740 --> 3:05:07.980]  become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it but that
[3:05:07.980 --> 3:05:13.740]  it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty his warnings ignored have now come to pass
[3:05:13.740 --> 3:05:18.780]  he said you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great
[3:05:18.780 --> 3:05:23.980]  and powerful people but how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct
[3:05:23.980 --> 3:05:28.780]  end of your government patrick kenry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever
[3:05:28.780 --> 3:05:34.220]  will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them today everything
[3:05:34.220 --> 3:05:39.740]  the government does at every level is concealed from us we have trade deals to manage our economy
[3:05:39.740 --> 3:05:44.140]  that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see later in life patrick kenry looked
[3:05:44.140 --> 3:05:48.860]  back and said when the american spirit was in its youth the language of america was different
[3:05:48.860 --> 3:05:55.020]  liberty sir was the primary object today our primary concern is safety and comfort when we
[3:05:55.020 --> 3:06:01.580]  should be demanding liberty grandfather wars dot com i'm david night in america's 240 plus year

[3:08:33.420 --> 3:08:39.180]  paul joseph watson now obviously we've spoken at length about the tragedy that happened last night
[3:08:39.180 --> 3:08:43.820]  in manchester england we're going to get more into that we're also going to cover the situation
[3:08:44.460 --> 3:08:49.660]  in libya or just off the coast of libya and this is what most people don't realize about the quote
[3:08:49.660 --> 3:08:56.780]  refugee crisis it's not a refugee crisis as people hold up the refugee welcome signs
[3:08:56.780 --> 3:09:03.500]  they don't even scratch one inch below the surface we're talking about these NGO boats
[3:09:03.500 --> 3:09:10.940]  literally going 12 miles off the coast of libya to pick up migrants some of whom have been paid
[3:09:10.940 --> 3:09:17.500]  by isis to cover their fee that they pay the people smugglers to get across the Mediterranean
[3:09:17.500 --> 3:09:25.900]  with the NGOs being in illegal communication with the people smugglers most people have no idea that
[3:09:25.900 --> 3:09:32.380]  this is going on it's something that we can stop if we know the details if we support the parties
[3:09:32.380 --> 3:09:37.820]  that are trying to stop it there in italy so i'm going to get into a detailed breakdown about that
[3:09:38.540 --> 3:09:43.820]  and obviously we're talking about what happened in manchester now to set the table for manchester
[3:09:43.820 --> 3:09:49.740]  this video just went up about an hour ago on youtube and on info wars dot com it is
[3:09:49.740 --> 3:09:55.180]  manchester attack what they're not telling you here's the video europe has been hit with yet
[3:09:55.180 --> 3:10:00.700]  another terrorist atrocity after at least 22 people were killed in an attack on the manchester arena
[3:10:00.700 --> 3:10:06.780]  claimed by isis the second attack on the uk in the space of two months victims many of them
[3:10:06.780 --> 3:10:13.020]  teenage girls massacred mutilated maimed why does this keep happening because our political
[3:10:13.020 --> 3:10:19.980]  class has demoted the most basic role of government to protect the lives of its people and replaced it
[3:10:19.980 --> 3:10:25.420]  with a different role tolerance tolerance of women being abused and harassed on the street
[3:10:25.420 --> 3:10:30.540]  tolerance of rape gangs abducting and abusing young girls for years tolerance of all the
[3:10:30.540 --> 3:10:36.700]  barbarisms of sharia law tolerance of terrorist attacks tolerance is now more important than
[3:10:36.700 --> 3:10:42.620]  the basic right to life tolerance tolerance of terror being part and parcel of living in a
[3:10:42.620 --> 3:10:48.060]  major city according to london massad econ europe is getting used to attacks like this meeker what
[3:10:48.060 --> 3:10:51.900]  we have to there's only one way britain should respond to attacks such as manchester that is by
[3:10:51.900 --> 3:10:59.180]  carrying on exactly as before just carry on forget about it be tolerant until it happens again
[3:10:59.180 --> 3:11:05.980]  and again and again tell me how do the parents of dead kids just carry on exactly as before how do
[3:11:05.980 --> 3:11:11.900]  the teenage girls whose legs have been blown off just carry on exactly as before as much as i'm
[3:11:11.900 --> 3:11:16.220]  praying for manchester i'm praying for muslims who have to deal with racism and islamophobia due
[3:11:16.220 --> 3:11:20.780]  to this tragedy right so that's what our main concern should be after dozens of children have
[3:11:20.780 --> 3:11:27.420]  been blown up people being mean to muslims as a society we need to make a choice which do we
[3:11:27.420 --> 3:11:33.980]  value more protecting the feelings of muslims or preventing our children from being blown up
[3:11:33.980 --> 3:11:38.220]  muslims are to blame when in reality muslim taxi drivers are offering free lifts than a muslim
[3:11:38.220 --> 3:11:42.940]  doctor working into the night saving lives yeah the fact that some muslim taxi drivers are offering
[3:11:42.940 --> 3:11:50.220]  free lifts doesn't negate the fact that islam has a problem with violence you utter moron islamophobia
[3:11:50.220 --> 3:11:56.780]  and sickening fake news is right tonight is showing a lot of people to be vile humans yeah vile humans
[3:11:56.780 --> 3:12:02.620]  follow a belief system that justifies massacring teenagers at a pop concert should we concentrate
[3:12:02.620 --> 3:12:08.540]  on stopping them or be more angry at inaccurate tweets seeing all the posts about manchester
[3:12:08.540 --> 3:12:13.660]  just reminds me of how we only notice it if it happens to white people right so the main complaint
[3:12:13.660 --> 3:12:19.020]  should be all those disgusting white people demanding attention for being slaughtered
[3:12:19.020 --> 3:12:24.780]  how dare they and in these times of our children being blown to bits by terrorists it's vital
[3:12:24.780 --> 3:12:30.620]  to point out the real danger katie hopkins as offensive tweets being angry at tommy robinson
[3:12:30.620 --> 3:12:35.580]  that's more important i've come to realize that a lot of this hashtag pray for whatever
[3:12:35.580 --> 3:12:41.660]  concern signaling is worse than glib it's repugnant narcissism people who see something
[3:12:41.660 --> 3:12:47.180]  horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media
[3:12:47.740 --> 3:12:53.740]  their facebook their twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing
[3:12:53.740 --> 3:13:04.780]  my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers
[3:13:04.780 --> 3:13:19.340]  with the families in boston do you know what that's worth nothing less than nothing less than nothing
[3:13:19.340 --> 3:13:26.060]  you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you were doing all you
[3:13:26.060 --> 3:13:34.460]  were doing is saying don't forget about me today your thoughts and prayers count for nothing cnn's
[3:13:34.460 --> 3:13:40.860]  jake tapper posting a union jack hey jake i don't recall you posting a russian flag when all those
[3:13:40.860 --> 3:13:46.620]  innocent people got blown up in the st petersburg subway last month was political correctness to
[3:13:46.620 --> 3:13:51.660]  blame for one of the accomplices in the attack escaping detection this eyewitness says she
[3:13:51.660 --> 3:13:58.300]  spotted a woman acting suspiciously and told security but they did nothing looked very suspicious
[3:13:58.300 --> 3:14:05.660]  she was fidgeting all the time with a bag um on the floor across her she was by herself um what was
[3:14:05.660 --> 3:14:12.620]  she doing she was looking in the direction of where the explosion actually happened all night and
[3:14:12.620 --> 3:14:17.900]  smacking to herself the suspicious individual was hard to understand suggesting english wasn't her
[3:14:17.900 --> 3:14:23.340]  first language the woman who reported the incident was then lectured for making the suspicious
[3:14:23.340 --> 3:14:29.500]  individual feel uncomfortable i would you like it if someone accused you of this um we're looking to
[3:14:29.500 --> 3:14:34.060]  it and nothing was done about it once or two minutes before the concert finished this lady
[3:14:34.060 --> 3:14:40.220]  disappeared um and then of course the explosion went off is she suggesting that security did nothing
[3:14:40.220 --> 3:14:45.580]  because the suspicious individual was muslim and to ask her to leave would have been politically
[3:14:45.580 --> 3:14:51.820]  incorrect we'll never know what we do know is this almost certainly nothing will change there are
[3:14:51.820 --> 3:14:57.580]  things we can change mass surveillance of hate preaching mosques solitary confinement of individuals
[3:14:57.580 --> 3:15:04.300]  who are likely to radicalize others in prison extreme vetting and strict quotas on muslim immigration
[3:15:04.300 --> 3:15:11.340]  deporting known terrorists prosecuting NGOs who send out boats to rescue unvetted migrants
[3:15:11.340 --> 3:15:17.500]  some of whom sympathize with or are members of isis but again nothing is going to change because
[3:15:17.500 --> 3:15:23.580]  we have a political class and a culture that deems hurt feelings to be of more concern than
[3:15:23.580 --> 3:15:30.540]  mangled dead children 90 percent of terror victims are muslims killed by other muslims this is the
[3:15:30.540 --> 3:15:36.060]  culture we're importing just 34 percent of british muslims would inform police if they knew
[3:15:36.060 --> 3:15:43.020]  someone was getting involved with isis 32 percent refused to condemn those who take part in violence
[3:15:43.020 --> 3:15:49.580]  against those who mocked the prophet muhammad one in four british muslims believe that the 77 attacks
[3:15:49.580 --> 3:15:55.740]  in london were justified isis fighters are returning from syria and flooding into europe on mass
[3:15:55.740 --> 3:16:02.380]  undercover of the refugee wave and european countries are welcoming them in because tolerance
[3:16:02.380 --> 3:16:09.100]  this is tolerance this is diversity this is the future our leaders have chosen for us but we
[3:16:09.100 --> 3:16:15.180]  have a choice we have hope don't let them tell you not to be angry don't let them tell you to
[3:16:15.180 --> 3:16:22.460]  just go on with life as normal because that's not bravery it's cowardice enough hashtags enough
[3:16:22.460 --> 3:16:30.620]  vigils enough celebrity platitudes it hasn't worked we need change we need action hope has
[3:16:30.620 --> 3:16:37.340]  two beautiful daughters their names are anger and courage anger at the way things are and courage
[3:16:37.340 --> 3:16:45.420]  to see that they do not remain as they are and that is what they're not telling you about the
[3:16:45.420 --> 3:16:50.380]  manchester attack now i mentioned there in the video everyone made a huge deal about oh there
[3:16:50.380 --> 3:16:55.980]  were some muslim taxi drivers who were offering free lifts to the people trying to get home after
[3:16:55.980 --> 3:17:02.780]  that tragedy now i'm sure there were some that were offering free lifts but cosmopolitan took
[3:17:02.780 --> 3:17:07.820]  this they put out a tweet and if you go on to my twitter page you can scroll down it's on there
[3:17:07.820 --> 3:17:15.740]  as of about an hour ago they put out a tweet with a picture of a seek man saying that he was a muslim
[3:17:15.740 --> 3:17:20.700]  offering free lifts now you could understand if they were just stupid and they're mistaking a seek
[3:17:20.700 --> 3:17:27.740]  for a muslim it's pretty easy to tell based on the headgear but they asked the originator of
[3:17:27.740 --> 3:17:34.460]  this photo for permission to use it and in the original tweet that this seek guy posted he said
[3:17:34.460 --> 3:17:42.300]  he was a seek cosmopolitan deliberately twisted that they took it and claimed he was a muslim again
[3:17:42.300 --> 3:17:48.140]  because virtue signaling about muslims and islamophobia that's the main concern that's the
[3:17:48.140 --> 3:17:53.500]  numero umero thing that everybody has to do after an islamic terrorist has slaughtered
[3:17:54.380 --> 3:18:00.540]  22 people 23 people and maimed dozens more that is the most important thing
[3:18:01.660 --> 3:18:07.260]  yeah i just imagine if some of these leftists got as i rate about islamic terrorism as they did
[3:18:07.260 --> 3:18:14.780]  oh i don't know people with opinions with which they don't agree remember tifa remember berkeley
[3:18:14.780 --> 3:18:20.700]  remember the absolute bedlam that takes place when anyone dares express an opinion that goes
[3:18:20.700 --> 3:18:27.980]  against their leftist consensus they go absolutely ape when something like this happens now where bad
[3:18:28.540 --> 3:18:34.220]  where bad for talking about islam i'll give you another example somebody put out a tweet earlier
[3:18:34.220 --> 3:18:40.780]  which said bearing in mind as we talked about earlier katie hopkins is literally under police
[3:18:40.780 --> 3:18:46.140]  investigation for a tweet which basically said we need to stand we need men to stand up against
[3:18:46.140 --> 3:18:52.300]  islamic terrorism that's basically all that it said she's under police investigation for that now
[3:18:52.300 --> 3:18:59.660]  they're visiting mosques okay this bomber came from walley range in manchester which is an area
[3:18:59.660 --> 3:19:07.740]  that has an area of manchester that has four mosques walley range two girls that went to syria to
[3:19:07.740 --> 3:19:12.380]  join isis also came out of that area so are the police going to be putting surveillance on those
[3:19:12.380 --> 3:19:16.780]  mosques are they going to be going to those mosques and finding out if they played a role
[3:19:16.780 --> 3:19:22.380]  in radicalizing this individual well not today it seems like because they're traveling around mosques
[3:19:22.380 --> 3:19:28.700]  checking if the people in the mosques are being attacked if they're safe now no one's advocating
[3:19:28.700 --> 3:19:34.700]  attacks on mosques that's ridiculous that's just as bad you don't fight extremism with extremism
[3:19:34.700 --> 3:19:40.700]  but for their primary concern to be quote hate speech and they've come out on twitter all these
[3:19:40.700 --> 3:19:45.980]  different police bodies and said we will not tolerate hate speech that was their first
[3:19:45.980 --> 3:19:53.580]  primary concern immediately after this attack it is every single time because these councils are
[3:19:53.580 --> 3:20:00.780]  controlled by leftists the same kind of people who ignored the ritual abuse it's been said any
[3:20:00.780 --> 3:20:07.100]  society is only three missed meals away from chaos those times may be near think about it our country
[3:20:07.100 --> 3:20:12.060]  faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from russia and north korea social unrest and
[3:20:12.060 --> 3:20:16.860]  violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns and a crumbling
[3:20:16.860 --> 3:20:21.900]  infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack
[3:20:21.900 --> 3:20:26.220]  when the chaos from any one of these threats arises the government knows it can't provide
[3:20:26.220 --> 3:20:31.580]  during a widespread national emergency that's why you need your own plan for self-reliance

[3:24:16.540 --> 3:24:21.900]  so again we have this narrative put out by the last after every single terrorist attack
[3:24:21.900 --> 3:24:27.900]  oh but what about islamophobia what about people being mean to muslims that is the first thing they
[3:24:27.900 --> 3:24:33.660]  come out with every single time they also come out with oh why are you blaming all muslims
[3:24:33.660 --> 3:24:40.140]  no one's blaming all muslims why do they constantly insist that that's what we're saying i've never
[3:24:40.140 --> 3:24:46.460]  said that it's self-evident that that's not the case statistically but it's also self-evident
[3:24:46.460 --> 3:24:52.540]  statistically that many of these people have extreme beliefs and it is a problem islam has a
[3:24:52.540 --> 3:25:00.940]  problem with violence okay when 32 percent say it's justifiable to commit terrorist attacks if it's
[3:25:00.940 --> 3:25:08.540]  in revenge for insulting the prophet 32 percent of british muslims think that that is a problem
[3:25:08.540 --> 3:25:14.460]  when one in four british muslims say the seven seven attacks in london which killed 50 odd people
[3:25:14.460 --> 3:25:20.620]  are justifiable that is a problem that's something we need to have a national conversation about
[3:25:20.620 --> 3:25:25.500]  without leftist coming in immediately and saying you're a racist you're an islamophobe even though
[3:25:25.500 --> 3:25:30.860]  islam is not a race and that you're saying all muslims are responsible nobody's saying that
[3:25:31.420 --> 3:25:37.260]  only complete idiots would claim that so why do they try to create that straw man well it's
[3:25:37.260 --> 3:25:43.980]  a deceptive tactic to shut down debate because again they cannot tolerate the fact that islam
[3:25:43.980 --> 3:25:49.820]  is not a progressive belief system yet they still have to embrace it anyway because it's all about
[3:25:49.820 --> 3:25:55.980]  the oppression olympics now this is a tweet that was said about me about two hours ago just to give
[3:25:55.980 --> 3:26:01.660]  you another example of the sheer idiocy that absolutely dominates twitter after every single
[3:26:01.660 --> 3:26:07.740]  one of these incidents it says quote i'd just like to apologize to all peaceful muslims on behalf
[3:26:07.740 --> 3:26:14.220]  of white people pull joseph watson and katie hopkins don't represent all of us so again
[3:26:14.860 --> 3:26:20.140]  putting it into the context of race islam is not a race i have to keep saying that over and over
[3:26:20.140 --> 3:26:24.860]  again there are actually white muslims there are black muslims there are brown muslims that's because
[3:26:24.860 --> 3:26:30.860]  it's a frigging belief system it's not a race so again they put it in the context of why you
[3:26:30.860 --> 3:26:36.700]  blaming all muslims show me one instance where i blamed all muslims for anything you can't
[3:26:36.700 --> 3:26:41.740]  because it's a dishonest tactic to shut down a debate a debate it's not a real argument it's
[3:26:41.740 --> 3:26:47.580]  never been part of the debate what should be part of the debate is the fact that massive
[3:26:47.580 --> 3:26:53.260]  numbers of muslims throughout the west you know 42 percent of young muslims in france
[3:26:53.260 --> 3:26:59.660]  support suicide bombing under certain circumstances that's a problem we have to face up to it
[3:26:59.660 --> 3:27:03.820]  to try and stop these massacres from happening over and over again because as you see with this
[3:27:03.820 --> 3:27:11.020]  individual the guy the suicide bomber behind the manchester arena attack born in manchester
[3:27:11.020 --> 3:27:17.980]  this is one of the integrated ones his parents were libyan refugees who came to the uk the
[3:27:17.980 --> 3:27:24.540]  uk gave them refuge they gave us a suicide bomber gee thanks what is happening in these
[3:27:24.540 --> 3:27:29.500]  communities what is happening in these prisons in these mosques where people are radicalized to
[3:27:29.500 --> 3:27:36.460]  such a degree that they will maim and mutilate teenage girls that should be the main frigging
[3:27:36.460 --> 3:27:42.300]  focus not katie hopkins as offensive tweets i mean i've laid out this scenario before i'll lay
[3:27:42.300 --> 3:27:46.380]  it out again let's see how much time we got left here and we're going to get into more news going
[3:27:46.380 --> 3:27:52.540]  to get into the libyan migrant crisis going to get into seth rich after the break but again
[3:27:52.540 --> 3:27:59.660]  here's a scenario say five delta airlines planes crashed in a single day in one day five delta
[3:27:59.660 --> 3:28:05.660]  airlines planes crash what would the normal reaction be well it would be to say damn there's
[3:28:05.660 --> 3:28:10.140]  something wrong with delta planes we need to investigate this we need to get to the bottom
[3:28:10.140 --> 3:28:15.980]  of it we need to do something about it because this cannot keep happening people are dying
[3:28:15.980 --> 3:28:21.980]  that would be the normal reaction to five delta airlines planes crashing in a single day what would
[3:28:21.980 --> 3:28:28.940]  be the insane reaction well it would be to tweet hashtag not all delta and say that thousands of
[3:28:28.940 --> 3:28:37.020]  delta airlines planes didn't crash today so why are you blaming all of delta airlines you deltaphobe
[3:28:37.020 --> 3:28:42.540]  that would be the insane reaction the insane reaction would be to say well only five delta
[3:28:42.540 --> 3:28:48.700]  airlines planes crash thousands of them didn't crash it's just a few bad planes maybe we should
[3:28:48.700 --> 3:28:56.140]  just be tolerant of delta airlines planes crashing and continue life as normal okay that
[3:28:56.140 --> 3:29:01.500]  would be the insane reaction nobody would have that reaction but that's exactly the reaction
[3:29:01.500 --> 3:29:07.980]  the left has when it comes to terrorism and it's again because they've embodied many of the same
[3:29:07.980 --> 3:29:15.580]  goals as islamic terrorists in terms of hating the west i mean europe has now completely lost
[3:29:15.580 --> 3:29:21.740]  faith in its in its culture the political class is flooding the continent with these people who
[3:29:21.740 --> 3:29:27.260]  have extreme regressive beliefs look what's happening and it's not just an existential
[3:29:27.260 --> 3:29:32.300]  threat with the terrorism it's the day-to-day grind the harassments the abuse the rape gangs
[3:29:32.300 --> 3:29:38.940]  this is what europe is currently going through and it's because of what anglo-mercle because what

[3:30:00.060 --> 3:30:04.700]  we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed
[3:30:04.700 --> 3:30:10.220]  by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit
[3:30:10.220 --> 3:30:15.660]  of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just
[3:30:15.660 --> 3:30:20.700]  powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive
[3:30:20.700 --> 3:30:27.340]  of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
[3:30:28.940 --> 3:30:34.780]  independence isn't a day it's a mindset an attitude that says i will not be your dependent i will

[3:30:41.020 --> 3:30:47.740]  infringements when you trade your liberty for safety to that extent you become their slave slaves

[3:33:27.900 --> 3:33:33.500]  we're back live on the alex jones show this is an article out of bright bought 2017 has seen a
[3:33:33.500 --> 3:33:40.460]  terror attack attempted in europe every nine days we talked about for years how europe would end up
[3:33:40.460 --> 3:33:47.180]  like israel it's now slowly beginning to seem like it in fact it seems like it's worse right now
[3:33:47.180 --> 3:33:51.580]  europe the united kingdom russia have witnessed terror attacks or attempted attacks every nine
[3:33:51.580 --> 3:33:59.740]  days in 2017 on average analysis of security incidents has revealed since january around 45
[3:33:59.740 --> 3:34:03.500]  people have been killed by mostly islamic terrorists while hundreds have been injured
[3:34:03.500 --> 3:34:08.300]  the only known incident not linked to jihad and jihadism was the attack on the borussia
[3:34:08.300 --> 3:34:13.820]  dormant soccer team attacks and attempted attacks have taken place in austria france the united
[3:34:13.820 --> 3:34:22.140]  kingdom belgium italy russia sweden norway and germany just in 2017 alone security services
[3:34:22.140 --> 3:34:28.540]  in britain which has population of 65 million are known to be tracking 3500 potential terror
[3:34:28.540 --> 3:34:34.940]  suspects or persons posing a threat again in most cases even though they're likely to become
[3:34:34.940 --> 3:34:41.420]  terrorists they have to leave them alone thousands of them thousands more flocking back in as a
[3:34:41.420 --> 3:34:46.940]  result of these isis controlled areas collapsing they're coming back to europe they're being allowed
[3:34:46.940 --> 3:34:54.540]  back into the country refugees welcome the red carpet is rolled out now let's move on to the
[3:34:55.580 --> 3:34:59.900]  refugee crisis of course because it emerged that the parents of this suicide bomber
[3:34:59.900 --> 3:35:07.500]  escaped from the gadafi regime to come to the uk let's take a look at what's happening in libya
[3:35:07.500 --> 3:35:13.100]  and why the true scale of it is being hidden from the public now this is important because as we know
[3:35:14.220 --> 3:35:21.260]  gadafi warned before he was toppled that jihadist would flock across the mediterranean
[3:35:21.260 --> 3:35:27.180]  would infiltrate european countries would carry out terrorist attacks that's exactly
[3:35:27.180 --> 3:35:33.900]  what is happening why is it happening because of these ngos because of these eu boats these vessels
[3:35:33.900 --> 3:35:40.060]  that are literally giving migrants a taxi service straight to europe this is the biggest
[3:35:40.060 --> 3:35:46.300]  risk conception surrounding the migrant crisis that these quote refugees are struggling to get
[3:35:46.300 --> 3:35:54.540]  close to europe and their ngo boats are rescuing them they're not rescuing them this is how it works
[3:35:54.540 --> 3:36:03.820]  the migrants pay people smugglers in libya up to 1500 euros each which is a year's wages okay so
[3:36:03.820 --> 3:36:10.620]  they're not destitute refugees 80 of them in the case of the ones going to italy or 85 indeed
[3:36:10.620 --> 3:36:17.980]  are men they're not even they're not forget siria they're not even from libya they're from other
[3:36:17.980 --> 3:36:25.820]  african countries eritrea nigeria they're not refugees they're economic migrants they're paying
[3:36:25.820 --> 3:36:33.260]  people smugglers the people smugglers transport them to a position just 12 miles off the coast of
[3:36:33.260 --> 3:36:42.220]  libya just 12 miles then they send out a distress signal and these ngo vessels get the call they
[3:36:42.220 --> 3:36:48.540]  come straight to them they pick them up again we presented the evidence and it's going to be in a
[3:36:48.540 --> 3:36:54.140]  big video that i've got coming out in a couple of days the people smugglers are in direct contact
[3:36:54.140 --> 3:37:00.700]  with the aid agencies even though it's completely illegal they're in direct phone contact with them
[3:37:00.700 --> 3:37:06.860]  which is why they're often first on the scene to me to rescue these migrants which is a criminal
[3:37:06.860 --> 3:37:13.580]  offense to be coordinating with criminal people smugglers that's something that they should be
[3:37:13.580 --> 3:37:20.460]  prosecuted for and they will be prosecuted if this investigation in italy draws to its correct
[3:37:20.460 --> 3:37:26.940]  conclusion because that's the way it's heading at the moment thankfully so we've played the videos
[3:37:26.940 --> 3:37:33.900]  before you can go to marine traffic dot com and see how these boats come from sicily they leave
[3:37:33.900 --> 3:37:40.060]  sicily they go to 12 miles off the coast of libya they pick up their human cargo take it back to
[3:37:40.060 --> 3:37:47.580]  italy it's literally a taxi service when these migrants get back to italy having been picked up
[3:37:47.580 --> 3:37:55.180]  half of them immediately disappear half of them now you've seen the stats when it comes to
[3:37:56.060 --> 3:38:01.420]  certain people from islamic countries supporting isis huge numbers uncomfortably huge numbers
[3:38:01.420 --> 3:38:07.900]  half of those people are just disappearing we've seen the reports migrants arriving in italy eye
[3:38:07.900 --> 3:38:15.260]  witness testimony they have isis flags beheading videos on their phone okay some of these people
[3:38:15.260 --> 3:38:22.300]  are jihadists some of them have been paid by isis to become isis members to become isis sleeper cells
[3:38:22.300 --> 3:38:28.780]  in europe that's how many of them pay the 1500 euro fee to the people smugglers in the first place
[3:38:28.780 --> 3:38:35.820]  and isn't it ironic that the only time the only time these boats are diverted from sicily having
[3:38:35.820 --> 3:38:42.700]  picked up migrants from libya is when the g7 elitists are in town we had that story last week
[3:38:42.700 --> 3:38:49.740]  so the only time they don't head back to italy is when the very political class that created
[3:38:49.740 --> 3:38:56.860]  this disaster is in town they don't want to be faced up with the consequences of the policies
[3:38:56.860 --> 3:39:03.580]  they created because again it's a security threat security threat for them forget about the italian
[3:39:03.580 --> 3:39:10.460]  people there's literally a war on the streets of italy in places like polomo in sicily between
[3:39:10.460 --> 3:39:16.700]  mafias between italian mafias and these african migrant gangs they're literally shooting each other
[3:39:16.700 --> 3:39:23.420]  killing each other the mayor of polomo in fact i can find his comment here he actually said
[3:39:23.420 --> 3:39:32.300]  he actually said that polomo was now a middle eastern islamic town and he was happy with that
[3:39:33.020 --> 3:39:38.620]  so a lot of them just love it a lot of them just love being a turf war between migrant criminal
[3:39:38.620 --> 3:39:44.540]  gangs and the italian mafia that's what they want that's what they're getting in places like polomo
[3:39:45.500 --> 3:39:52.620]  but again the problem goes back to these ngo ships many of them are german no surprise there
[3:39:52.620 --> 3:39:59.740]  even the eu border agency frontex has accused aid agencies of helping criminals achieve their
[3:39:59.740 --> 3:40:06.620]  objectives that's a direct quote the people smugglers contact the ngo boats because they
[3:40:06.620 --> 3:40:11.900]  know they won't be arrested if they contacted coast guard boats they've got a risk of being
[3:40:11.900 --> 3:40:19.020]  arrested so they don't do that here's a quote since june 2016 many boats have been rescued near
[3:40:19.020 --> 3:40:26.220]  the libian coast by aid agency vessels without any prior distress call suggesting the rendezvous
[3:40:26.220 --> 3:40:32.940]  rendezvous has been pre arranged so again they're in direct contact with the criminal people smugglers
[3:40:33.500 --> 3:40:40.300]  italian prosecutor carmelo zacara says he has evidence of phone calls between criminal people
[3:40:40.300 --> 3:40:51.100]  smugglers and NGOs like save the children proactiva open arms and sos Mediterranean also evas.org
[3:40:51.100 --> 3:40:56.540]  medicine sand frontier and move on the org are all involved you'll notice those are all george
[3:40:56.540 --> 3:41:06.220]  soros bankrolled organizations 500 million he invested not long ago to quote help refugees
[3:41:06.220 --> 3:41:13.020]  and undoubtedly much of it is going to these NGOs to chart these vessels that go out bring these
[3:41:13.020 --> 3:41:22.140]  unvetted in some cases isis members or isis sympathizers into europe so again it's an
[3:41:22.140 --> 3:41:29.500]  absolutely huge scandal nobody knows the scale of it we're talking 200 000 migrants have arrived
[3:41:29.500 --> 3:41:38.780]  in Italy last year alone and that's increasing 200 000 a year unvetted just brought straight in
[3:41:38.780 --> 3:41:46.540]  half of them immediately disappear just 2.65 of migrants arriving in Italy are awarded asylum
[3:41:46.540 --> 3:41:53.340]  status so again the huge misconception that they're all refugees they're not refugees the vast
[3:41:53.340 --> 3:42:00.380]  majority of them are men and half of them at least just immediately disappear as soon as they arrive in
[3:42:00.380 --> 3:42:06.860]  europe now people say well is the migrant crisis going to end up is there just going to be just
[3:42:06.860 --> 3:42:12.460]  so many people coming in that it stops being a deluge and just becomes a trickle well no
[3:42:13.500 --> 3:42:17.660]  because africa's population is exploding again where are these people coming from they're not
[3:42:17.660 --> 3:42:22.300]  libyans okay they're coming from Niger they're coming from chad they're coming from sudan
[3:42:22.300 --> 3:42:27.820]  they're coming from Ethiopia you look at the projected populations of those countries in
[3:42:27.820 --> 3:42:34.860]  africa africa's population is exploding these are the countries surrounding libya niger's
[3:42:34.860 --> 3:42:42.620]  population is set to quadruple in the next three decades 20 million to 72 million chad's population
[3:42:42.620 --> 3:42:50.540]  is going to leap from 14 million to 35 million sudan is heading towards 80 million egypt 152
[3:42:50.540 --> 3:43:01.340]  million ethiopia 189 million and nigeria 400 million so it's never going to stop if we have this
[3:43:01.340 --> 3:43:09.420]  policy of just picking them up bringing them in on taxis it's never going to stop and this is the
[3:43:09.420 --> 3:43:15.100]  problem you can't flood european cities with tens of millions of people from the middle east and
[3:43:15.100 --> 3:43:21.740]  africa and expect it to remain the same eventually it's going to start to feel less like europe
[3:43:21.740 --> 3:43:27.740]  and more like the middle east and africa okay if you took hundreds of millions of white people
[3:43:27.740 --> 3:43:34.460]  and dumped them into china that's going to change their society it's just basic demographics basic
[3:43:34.460 --> 3:43:40.860]  culture so again southern italy is going through absolute nightmares of having turf wars between
[3:43:40.860 --> 3:43:46.780]  the italian mafia and these african crime gangs that have arrived this is the the quote from the
[3:43:46.780 --> 3:43:52.460]  mayor of polermo that i alluded to earlier he said quote polermo is no longer an italian town
[3:43:52.460 --> 3:43:59.100]  it's no longer european you can walk in the city and feel like you're in istanbul or bayru polermo
[3:43:59.100 --> 3:44:07.100]  is a middle eastern town in europe that's the mayor of polermo and he's happy about it he said it
[3:44:07.100 --> 3:44:12.300]  was a good thing similar to how the uh green party member in germany said that you know
[3:44:13.420 --> 3:44:19.020]  major german cities being a white minority in 20 years would be a great thing they celebrated it
[3:44:19.020 --> 3:44:24.700]  this is what they're all about because again they ship in a class of people that are totally
[3:44:24.700 --> 3:44:30.940]  dependent on handouts that keeps them in power that's all they care about they want to be in power
[3:44:30.940 --> 3:44:36.940]  forever this is how they think they're going to do it by destroying their own culture by committing
[3:44:37.660 --> 3:44:45.580]  suicide absolutely incredible and it's not just the terror attacks people make the argument well
[3:44:45.580 --> 3:44:50.540]  you know how many people die of cancer how many people die in road accidents it's not just the
[3:44:50.540 --> 3:44:57.260]  existential threat there was a report out of sweden the other day which we covered 90 percent of
[3:44:57.260 --> 3:45:06.060]  shootings in sweden using firearms were carried out by migrants 90 percent not 1990 you can look at
[3:45:06.060 --> 3:45:12.380]  germany their own government interior ministry ministry report found that there were an extra
[3:45:12.380 --> 3:45:20.940]  402 000 crimes committed by migrants per year with non-germans accounting for 27.6 percent of total
[3:45:20.940 --> 3:45:27.580]  offensives so they're completely overrepresented in the crime statistics you talk about that in
[3:45:27.580 --> 3:45:33.900]  sweden they put you on a hate list you see how this begins to work half a million migrants in
[3:45:33.900 --> 3:45:40.380]  germany are on welfare benefits the idea that we need them to save our economy to import workers
[3:45:40.380 --> 3:45:46.380]  because we're committing demographic suicide doesn't stand up most of them are on benefits
[3:45:46.380 --> 3:45:52.380]  they don't have jobs they bleed the economy they don't add to the economy we have the gang
[3:45:52.380 --> 3:45:56.620]  rapes we have the harassment we have the the abuse of women you now have women in paris
[3:45:57.740 --> 3:46:05.180]  protesting eastern paris because they can't leave the house dressed in certain clothing without
[3:46:05.180 --> 3:46:10.940]  being abused and harassed by gangs of migrant men we've seen the rapes we've seen the gang
[3:46:10.940 --> 3:46:18.780]  rapes we had a gang rape in austria reported just a few days ago weekly at least bi-weekly we have
[3:46:18.780 --> 3:46:25.260]  a gang rape in some small quaint european town because of this culture that we've imported
[3:46:27.500 --> 3:46:33.100]  in germany and italy they're confiscating private property to house these migrants in
[3:46:33.100 --> 3:46:38.380]  sweden the big postal company post nord announced it would stop mail delivery to the migrant sober
[3:46:38.380 --> 3:46:45.180]  but wrinkly because it's too unsafe social media again if you complain about this though
[3:46:45.180 --> 3:46:50.620]  you're bad it's not don't fix the problem complain about the people who are complaining about it
[3:46:50.620 --> 3:46:56.060]  put them on a hate crime blacklist that's what angela merkel's main concern was wasn't it when
[3:46:56.060 --> 3:47:04.380]  she talked to zuckerberg how can we stop people criticizing this policy so again these ngos that
[3:47:04.380 --> 3:47:10.220]  are picking up it's a virtual taxi service they're picking them up from the coast of libya dumping
[3:47:10.220 --> 3:47:16.940]  them into italy half go missing we need to put a stop to this these ngos need to be prosecuted
[3:47:16.940 --> 3:47:22.620]  they are currently being investigated by italian authorities and hopefully that prosecution
[3:47:23.500 --> 3:47:27.820]  will come through the other positive development in actually stopping this
[3:47:27.820 --> 3:47:35.260]  is that bepe grillo's five-star movement which is a populist party in italy according to recent
[3:47:35.260 --> 3:47:41.980]  polls is either tide or has a slender lead over the ruling center left party in italy and again
[3:47:41.980 --> 3:47:48.220]  this is not just about italy this is where the migrants are coming in this is the major route
[3:47:48.220 --> 3:47:55.260]  now if we stop this if we plug this leak we can actually prevent terror attacks isis has bragged
[3:47:55.260 --> 3:48:01.580]  about how they're exploiting this to infiltrate fighters into europe support bepe grillo's five-star
[3:48:01.580 --> 3:48:07.820]  movement in italy like nothing before because they have a chance of being elected next year in the
[3:48:07.820 --> 3:48:13.980]  italian election they have promised to stop these angio boats picking up these migrants
[3:48:13.980 --> 3:48:20.220]  dumping them into italy that's one of their campaigns bepe grillo's five-star movement again
[3:48:20.220 --> 3:48:25.660]  it's not a far-right party it's a populist party it's doing extremely well in the polls
[3:48:26.380 --> 3:48:33.740]  and they have a chance of stopping this of stopping this nightmare that is being inflicted upon
[3:48:33.740 --> 3:48:39.500]  europe another expression of which we saw last night in manchester but again it's not just about
[3:48:39.500 --> 3:48:45.500]  migrants it's not just about refugees it's about these ghettoized areas people going to mosques
[3:48:45.500 --> 3:48:51.180]  people going to prisons the radicalization problem in prisons is absolutely endemic
[3:48:53.740 --> 3:48:57.980]  but again because of political correctness there's nothing done about it there's absolutely
[3:48:57.980 --> 3:49:03.020]  nothing done about it at every turn these are the solutions that we need to focus on i mentioned
[3:49:03.020 --> 3:49:09.900]  some of them in my video which you heard earlier okay so none of the debate is about all muslims
[3:49:09.900 --> 3:49:16.380]  are responsible the debate is this is terrible we cannot we cannot let this become the new normal
[3:49:16.380 --> 3:49:23.020]  like the media wants us to do we have to address this we have to propose concrete solutions to
[3:49:23.020 --> 3:49:28.620]  prevent this from happening every nine days now in europe there's a terror attack
[3:49:30.460 --> 3:49:37.340]  so the solution is not to shut down people who are actually proposing remedies that's not the
[3:49:37.340 --> 3:49:42.620]  solution but that's what this political class is pushing because again they're beholden to this
[3:49:42.620 --> 3:49:49.820]  policy they created it for their own political machinations now they're wedded to it so they
[3:49:49.820 --> 3:49:57.500]  have to demonize anybody who tries to stop that policy as islamophobic as racist but we should
[3:49:57.500 --> 3:50:04.380]  not allow this to continue as normal another report here isis claims responsibility for
[3:50:04.380 --> 3:50:09.660]  manchester attack suspect bomber identified again his parents were libyan refugees the
[3:50:09.660 --> 3:50:14.940]  uk gave them sanctuary they gave us a suicide bomber gee thanks what is happening in these
[3:50:14.940 --> 3:50:21.260]  communities they've carried out controlled explosions in walley range an area of manchester
[3:50:21.260 --> 3:50:29.100]  which again has four mosques in one area alone it's not that big an area four mosques what's
[3:50:29.100 --> 3:50:35.020]  happening inside these mosques did he attend the mosques was he radicalized we know that he
[3:50:35.020 --> 3:50:40.460]  was known to security services and that's the case in almost every single case because they're
[3:50:40.460 --> 3:50:46.380]  told oh you can only track them you can't actually apprehend them even though they're radicalized
[3:50:46.380 --> 3:50:51.180]  they're terrorists they're likely to commit terrorist attacks this is the situation in europe
[3:50:51.180 --> 3:50:57.820]  it's absolutely horrific something must change beyond virtue signaling and hashtag we'll be back

[3:56:29.180 --> 3:56:35.180]  off here moving on to seth rich news of course last week we had a private investigator come out and
[3:56:35.180 --> 3:56:41.980]  claim that from his sources he knew that seth rich was the source of the dnc leaks that got poo pooed
[3:56:41.980 --> 3:56:47.500]  there was a pushback against that was he threatened we don't know now kim dot com of course was the
[3:56:47.500 --> 3:56:53.420]  founder of mega upload teased this yesterday by coming out and saying that he knew for a fact
[3:56:53.980 --> 3:57:01.660]  that seth rich not russia seth rich the murdered dnc staffer was the source of the dnc leak now
[3:57:01.660 --> 3:57:07.820]  he's released a statement on his website saying quote i know this because in late 2014 a person
[3:57:07.820 --> 3:57:12.540]  contacted me about helping me to start a branch of the internet party in the in the united states he
[3:57:12.540 --> 3:57:20.220]  called himself panda i now know that panda was seth rich of course that's the icon that's the avatar
[3:57:20.220 --> 3:57:25.020]  that he used on his different accounts he continues panda advisement that he was working on voter
[3:57:25.020 --> 3:57:31.740]  analytics tools and other technologies that the internet party may find helpful so he was disenfranchised
[3:57:31.740 --> 3:57:37.660]  because bernie sanders who he supported was screwed over that was his motivation he was in contact
[3:57:37.660 --> 3:57:43.740]  with kin kim dot com now kim dot com continues in this statement i've consulted with my lawyers
[3:57:43.740 --> 3:57:48.860]  except my full statement should be provided to the authorities so he says he's prepared to do that
[3:57:48.860 --> 3:57:54.060]  if my evidence is required to be given in the us i would be prepared to do so if appropriate
[3:57:54.060 --> 3:57:58.780]  arrangements are made i would need a guarantee from special counsel muller on behalf of the united
[3:57:58.780 --> 3:58:04.460]  states safe passage given that he's his house has been raided before from new zealand to the united
[3:58:04.460 --> 3:58:09.820]  states and back so now he's saying he will give that evidence of seth rich being the source of the
[3:58:09.820 --> 3:58:16.780]  dnc leaks to a special prosecution will it come out or will they clamp down on it they are absolutely
[3:58:16.780 --> 3:58:24.060]  terrified in dc the establishment swamp of this coming out will it finally come to light proving
[3:58:24.060 --> 3:58:30.860]  that seth rich was the source of the dnc leaks derailing the whole trump posh analogy that's
[3:58:30.860 --> 3:58:35.180]  going to wrap it up for this segment of the alex joan show nightly news coming up breaking news
[3:58:35.180 --> 3:59:01.660]  at info wars dot com
