[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:41.840]  Texas Alex Joe's like I said live on the area I'm mad
[00:41.840 --> 00:50.640]  ladies and gentlemen we are live thank you so much for joining us today it of
[00:50.640 --> 00:57.480]  course is the third day of May 2011 and we are going to be live here for at
[00:57.480 --> 01:04.200]  least the next three hours joining us yet again is General Hamed Ghul the
[01:04.200 --> 01:12.960]  former head of Pakistani intelligence will be joining us coming up in about
[01:12.960 --> 01:18.800]  35 minutes from now we also have James Corbett of the Corbett report joining us
[01:18.800 --> 01:24.240]  to give us his analysis of what's happening with the whole bin Laden
[01:24.240 --> 01:30.320]  situation and oh and JJ Stone a technology commentator is not buying the
[01:30.320 --> 01:36.920]  official narrative so we're going to be talking with him as well today now
[01:36.920 --> 01:43.240]  something interesting has happened in the last 48 hours since the Sunday
[01:43.240 --> 01:49.600]  evening pronouncement of the president all over the world people are not buying
[01:49.600 --> 01:56.760]  the official story and Sunday night and Monday morning you were laughed at by
[01:56.760 --> 02:02.360]  the mainstream dinosaur dying discredited lying media if you questioned it
[02:02.360 --> 02:06.760]  and they acted like it was very kooky and the Washington Post called me and
[02:06.760 --> 02:12.920]  said we this is like the Elvis death people believing he's still alive and I
[02:12.920 --> 02:16.560]  said I'm not talking about Elvis and I'm not talking about him still being alive
[02:16.560 --> 02:22.160]  I said this is a government that's been caught lying over and over and over and
[02:22.160 --> 02:27.080]  over and over again and manufacturing evidence and engaging in duplicitous
[02:27.080 --> 02:32.600]  activities so people would be crazy to out of hand believe this and then they
[02:32.600 --> 02:35.720]  dumped the body at sea they claim and they're going to supposedly show video
[02:35.720 --> 02:43.720]  of that I guess they've got a wax figurine from Madam Kuto's or whatever
[02:43.720 --> 02:48.680]  her name is a wax museum and they're gonna throw it in the water I mean this
[02:48.680 --> 02:52.720]  is just ridiculous and then they put out the fake photo in the first 12 14
[02:52.720 --> 02:56.120]  hours and say it's real then they retract it now they've got a new photo
[02:56.120 --> 03:01.240]  coming out they also admit now that he didn't use his wife as a human shield in
[03:01.240 --> 03:08.280]  the official narrative that he didn't fight back and they're telling on
[03:08.280 --> 03:12.400]  themselves for lying so you'll believe the general story that's a psychological
[03:12.400 --> 03:16.840]  warfare trick the whole things a lie guaranteed the evidence the stink the
[03:16.840 --> 03:21.880]  cut of the garment as I said yesterday dr. Paul Craig Roberts is out today
[03:21.880 --> 03:26.440]  saying this reeks of a hoax Cindy Sheehan is saying the same thing many
[03:26.440 --> 03:30.480]  government people are saying they don't buy this and we're really seeing the
[03:30.480 --> 03:34.320]  G the geopolitical reasons for this shaping up what they want to do
[03:34.320 --> 03:39.680]  domestically in the West with oh no the TSA is validated and sticking their
[03:39.680 --> 03:46.360]  hands down your pants there's going to be more of this now not less and oh if we
[03:46.360 --> 03:52.080]  go to Central Asia oh my the Pakistan he's obviously knew bin Laden was there
[03:52.080 --> 04:02.040]  and so the drone attacks need to start and the the the aid needs to be cut and
[04:02.040 --> 04:05.680]  we might have to have war with these people funny in the last month we've
[04:05.680 --> 04:11.480]  had all these guests on experts and it's come out in the news that the Saudis
[04:11.480 --> 04:14.840]  have run to Pakistan for their nuclear umbrella they know they're being double
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.160]  crossed by the West the Saudis have cut oil production as a response to the fact
[04:19.160 --> 04:24.040]  that it's now on record that many of the jihadists being stirred up and in and
[04:24.040 --> 04:27.800]  funded are being funded out of the US State Department and out of 10 Downing
[04:27.800 --> 04:31.960]  Street that's not even debated now and the Arabs understand they're being
[04:31.960 --> 04:36.440]  double-crossed the Arab dictators and oligarchies that have worked with them
[04:36.440 --> 04:42.120]  and so as soon as Pakistan starts trying to bust the gates and get out of San
[04:42.120 --> 04:47.560]  Quentin magically all this happens so we're gonna go over all of it today and
[04:47.560 --> 04:51.960]  the the intensifying evidence that it's fraud but something interesting has
[04:51.960 --> 04:57.120]  happened now or and more people aren't buying it we'll be right back
[05:01.320 --> 05:05.240]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[05:05.240 --> 05:09.960]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[05:09.960 --> 05:13.880]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[05:13.880 --> 05:16.840]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of
[05:16.840 --> 05:21.000]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.960]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions
[05:25.960 --> 05:31.000]  and also delivers the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.080]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products
[05:35.080 --> 05:38.600]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[05:38.600 --> 05:43.080]  with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions
[05:43.080 --> 05:45.960]  are provided making production fast and simple
[05:45.960 --> 05:51.320]  go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[05:51.320 --> 05:58.120]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[06:01.400 --> 06:05.480]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[06:05.480 --> 06:09.720]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[06:09.720 --> 06:12.680]  agenda we're pulling the rug from underneath the

[06:59.960 --> 07:03.160]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[07:03.160 --> 07:07.160]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[07:07.160 --> 07:09.640]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[07:09.640 --> 07:13.480]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[07:13.480 --> 07:16.680]  allows you to have it's true total government control of
[07:16.680 --> 07:20.200]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[07:20.200 --> 07:23.880]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[07:23.880 --> 07:26.840]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[07:26.840 --> 07:30.760]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[07:30.760 --> 07:33.880]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[07:33.880 --> 07:37.800]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[07:37.800 --> 07:40.680]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[07:40.680 --> 07:43.800]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.800 --> 07:46.520]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more
[07:46.520 --> 07:51.720]  information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com

[08:12.600 --> 08:20.680]  it is tuesday the third day of may 2011 we're gonna be breaking down all of the
[08:20.680 --> 08:23.560]  different developments surrounding the mayday
[08:23.560 --> 08:27.480]  reported killing of the chief boogie man
[08:27.480 --> 08:34.440]  usama bin laden and the fact that all over the global media domestic media
[08:34.440 --> 08:38.280]  a lot of people are questioning the dumping at sea
[08:38.280 --> 08:43.240]  the fake photo they first released and then later had to admit was fake when
[08:43.240 --> 08:46.840]  alternative media pointed out it was a photo shop the media put out
[08:46.840 --> 08:51.880]  almost three years ago we're going to be going over all of it today but also
[08:51.880 --> 08:56.680]  what we're not looking at while we're busy obsessed on
[08:56.680 --> 09:01.320]  president obama kicking off his reelection campaign
[09:01.320 --> 09:06.360]  with this latest fairy tale what's happening at the u.s treasury big
[09:06.360 --> 09:09.960]  developments there what's happening to the dollar the stock market
[09:09.960 --> 09:15.080]  plunging today the fact that the neocon media is
[09:15.080 --> 09:18.280]  saying see we're going to have five six seven
[09:18.280 --> 09:22.360]  dollar gallon gas we need to focus on security
[09:22.360 --> 09:25.320]  and if there's a terror attack the american people
[09:25.320 --> 09:29.720]  won't be as worried about what's happening to the economy
[09:29.720 --> 09:33.560]  and if you study this the global architects that have worked for
[09:33.560 --> 09:38.760]  90 plus years since 1913 to position the united states into total bankruptcy
[09:38.760 --> 09:43.480]  and receivership to kill our free market system
[09:43.480 --> 09:49.480]  they really stand again from stage terror attacks
[09:49.480 --> 09:52.840]  and on sunday night and monday morning so many people were saying
[09:52.840 --> 09:56.440]  oh my gosh it's great i can carry my shampoo
[09:56.440 --> 09:59.960]  with me on a trip i don't have to go buy shampoo everywhere i fly
[09:59.960 --> 10:04.120]  everywhere i go i don't have to have the tsa stick their hands down my pants i
[10:04.120 --> 10:07.240]  don't have to have them download what's on my laptop
[10:07.240 --> 10:10.680]  i don't have to answer all their questions and the media said no no no no
[10:10.680 --> 10:15.000]  you don't get it we're going to have more tsa checkpoints on highways at bus
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.600]  terminals at train stations uh we're going to be spying on you
[10:18.600 --> 10:23.320]  more um here are the new four leaders of al-qaeda
[10:23.320 --> 10:27.160]  alaki gadan and the two others of the four they're
[10:27.160 --> 10:31.400]  putting on the news three born in america all three of them known to be
[10:31.400 --> 10:35.480]  trained at u.s military bases hanging out the pentagon protected
[10:35.480 --> 10:39.880]  running the uh real attacks in the u.s with mentally ill
[10:39.880 --> 10:44.360]  muslim extremist patsy's uh we have the eyewitnesses of the u.s government
[10:44.360 --> 10:48.440]  getting the underwear bomber on the plane uh for two years protecting
[10:48.440 --> 10:52.680]  major hashaan knowing the attack was coming alaki commanding him
[10:52.680 --> 10:57.800]  congress wants the documents cia says no how does cia say no to congress and
[10:57.800 --> 11:01.720]  the homeland security committee things are upside down that's the government
[11:01.720 --> 11:06.040]  that's the congress with the national security act that created them
[11:06.040 --> 11:10.280]  this is the tail wagging the dog it's like the u.n launching the new libyan
[11:10.280 --> 11:13.960]  war and obama not even consulting congress it's about training you
[11:13.960 --> 11:17.000]  to accept this
[11:17.400 --> 11:23.080]  and so it's a fact that the hijackers and quotes were trained at u.s military
[11:23.080 --> 11:26.520]  bases that u.s embassies and Saudi Arabia were ordered to give them
[11:26.520 --> 11:29.640]  visas into the u.s even though they came up on the terror watch list
[11:29.640 --> 11:34.040]  i've interviewed the head of the visa section from jeta mr springman
[11:34.040 --> 11:38.440]  going back nine years ago now people say well
[11:38.440 --> 11:41.880]  why are you just coming out and saying this is a lie why are you
[11:41.880 --> 11:45.560]  coming out and saying that this is a pr stunt
[11:45.560 --> 11:50.040]  well just look at the way it's all crafted and scripted
[11:50.040 --> 11:53.720]  just look at it look at how it was rolled out
[11:53.720 --> 11:58.760]  look at how it's being pushed look at the agenda they're piling on to it
[11:58.760 --> 12:03.080]  but it's not just that how many times have we been lied to
[12:03.080 --> 12:07.240]  how many terror attacks have turned out to be fake
[12:07.240 --> 12:11.240]  how many pentagon and joint chiefs of staff documents do we have to get
[12:11.240 --> 12:17.000]  where they stage the gulf of tonkin to get us into vietnam
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.080]  how many times how many operation northwards do we have to see
[12:21.080 --> 12:25.480]  how many wiki leaks releases of army training manuals for black op army
[12:25.480 --> 12:30.920]  captains not all army captains specialized black op army
[12:30.920 --> 12:35.160]  captains on how to stage a false flag they teach these navy seals
[12:35.160 --> 12:39.240]  and delta force and uh special ops people
[12:39.240 --> 12:44.120]  how to do dirty tricks how to stage events
[12:44.200 --> 12:47.240]  delta force uh you know even above the seals
[12:47.240 --> 12:50.680]  where they take the best from the different uh military disciplines
[12:50.680 --> 12:54.680]  and put them into these fused groups delta force when they graduate and this
[12:54.680 --> 12:58.360]  has been declassified and they had to cancel
[12:58.360 --> 13:01.320]  this part of the test because now it's known by
[13:01.320 --> 13:05.400]  people that are you know trying to get into the delta force
[13:05.400 --> 13:11.000]  at the end of the month-long rigors and the psychological warfare they have to
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.920]  go under to make sure they can't be cracked easily
[13:14.920 --> 13:18.760]  then they're given mackey of ellies the prince and they have
[13:18.760 --> 13:22.840]  12 hours to read it and then write an essay and if they
[13:22.840 --> 13:27.000]  say the unjustifies the means and you've got to be evil to protect good
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.040]  and torture is good and lying is good because
[13:30.040 --> 13:33.640]  at the end of the day we're the good guys that's the devil's trick folks
[13:33.640 --> 13:38.840]  read the bible that's pure whether you believe the bible or not the point is
[13:38.840 --> 13:42.680]  that's that's that's always culturally been seen
[13:42.680 --> 13:50.200]  as the main system of deception that oh just be evil for good sake
[13:50.200 --> 13:54.200]  and if they write the essay and say that they will be evil for good sake
[13:54.200 --> 13:57.720]  that they will lie for good sake that they will torture for good sake
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.200]  that they will dissemble that they will stage terror attacks
[14:02.200 --> 14:05.640]  then they go welcome to the delta force squadron
[14:05.640 --> 14:09.720]  now if they answer it wrong they say uh we're going to have you in logistics
[14:09.720 --> 14:12.440]  uh we're going to send you to ford brag and you're going to you're going to
[14:12.440 --> 14:18.120]  basically push pencils all day see this is the real world
[14:18.120 --> 14:21.720]  and when you read the writings of these retired cia people like hermit rosavel
[14:21.720 --> 14:25.560]  to staged operation ajax with stage terror attacks to overthrow the iranian
[14:25.560 --> 14:29.080]  government 53 that's declassified when i've uh
[14:29.080 --> 14:33.240]  been at events and had cia guys come over and get in my face and
[14:33.240 --> 14:36.600]  and then later you know pass messages through people about you don't live in
[14:36.600 --> 14:39.880]  the real world you don't know how the world really works you don't understand
[14:39.880 --> 14:44.200]  what we have to do we have to be more evil than the other side we have to take
[14:44.200 --> 14:48.600]  every system they might use and make it our own or somebody else bad will take
[14:48.600 --> 14:52.920]  control of it we have to bring the drugs in or somebody else will
[14:52.920 --> 14:55.640]  and then they'll get the money in the power and then that evil group will
[14:55.640 --> 14:59.640]  overtake us it's circular logic oh is that why
[14:59.640 --> 15:04.520]  you push worldwide to keep drugs illegal no if you didn't want al qaeda
[15:04.520 --> 15:07.880]  taliban having the opium and making the money off of it
[15:07.880 --> 15:12.200]  you would decriminalize it so that the price would plummet and then there'd be
[15:12.200 --> 15:16.120]  no business in it but instead you go in and boost
[15:16.120 --> 15:19.400]  production and control it and then think we're so dumb now
[15:19.400 --> 15:23.720]  there because this stuff can't be hidden anymore that they come out in the bbc
[15:23.720 --> 15:28.280]  i told you a year before uh i saw herald o revera
[15:28.280 --> 15:31.640]  with the army excuse me uh marine court colonel
[15:31.640 --> 15:34.680]  going yeah we help grow it we give them the opium uh we give them the
[15:34.680 --> 15:39.640]  fertilizer and we help them protect it i heard bbc
[15:39.640 --> 15:43.640]  with the same narrative about well if we don't grow it and help ship it out
[15:43.640 --> 15:48.200]  al qaeda and taliban will get the money and i almost ran off the road not
[15:48.200 --> 15:51.320]  because i didn't know that but because they were admitting it
[15:51.320 --> 15:54.120]  and then i could never find it on the bbc website
[15:54.120 --> 15:58.440]  of the report well then we did find because listeners called
[15:58.440 --> 16:04.200]  the youtube a year later uh of uh herald o revera
[16:04.200 --> 16:09.480]  going yeah america we grow the opium you see because they can't hide it how many
[16:09.480 --> 16:13.800]  cia aircraft crashing with cocaine on board uh i mean i mean this the one of

[16:38.920 --> 16:41.640]  and charged him as well and took it away from state court
[16:41.640 --> 16:45.080]  and in there he released the documents and the law and the judge released it and

[24:00.600 --> 24:22.600]  music
[24:24.120 --> 24:29.480]  i almost got back a little late here in the broadcast chair because i just
[24:29.480 --> 24:35.400]  got the call back from dr steve pacinic uh the number two guy under henry
[24:35.400 --> 24:39.080]  kissinger at the state department who worked with ben laden who knows who
[24:39.080 --> 24:42.200]  some have been laden uh and he said alec you're doing a
[24:42.200 --> 24:46.200]  very good job i'm listening to the show right now of course we had him on in
[24:46.200 --> 24:50.920]  2002 in april and he broke down that the intel that
[24:50.920 --> 24:55.720]  ben laden was dead and was frozen on ice to be rolled out later now i was then
[24:55.720 --> 24:58.760]  told by two other white house sources the exact same thing
[24:58.760 --> 25:01.960]  and people couldn't believe it even though we had pacinic on record and
[25:01.960 --> 25:05.800]  suddenly madeline albright, walter kronkite, teresaheins carry,
[25:05.800 --> 25:09.320]  and scores of other top democrats came out and said bush we know you got him
[25:09.320 --> 25:12.600]  frozen don't stage his death in roley mount so
[25:12.600 --> 25:16.040]  they pulled it off the table and waited with that ace card
[25:16.040 --> 25:19.080]  and you notice obama's got the same secretary of defense
[25:19.080 --> 25:22.440]  robert gates it's all the same crew they act like they're fighting with each
[25:22.440 --> 25:25.240]  other it's staged at that level and so they've
[25:25.240 --> 25:29.000]  allowed obama to play this card because geopolitically
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.640]  pakistan has teamed up with saudi arabia because saudi arabia realizes
[25:33.640 --> 25:37.000]  that they're being double crossed right now and that
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.680]  most of these arab spring activities have been stirred up by the west
[25:40.680 --> 25:45.000]  to try to stabilize the region so they have a pretext to expand the wars
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.120]  and now it's been admitted libya egypt all staged by the west
[25:48.120 --> 25:51.160]  doesn't mean there aren't folks that are angry at these dictators that are also
[25:51.160 --> 25:55.160]  going along with it the point is the the the the match was struck the fire was
[25:55.160 --> 25:59.480]  lit by the globalist and that's now incontrovertible
[25:59.480 --> 26:04.200]  absolute proof so i just talked to um
[26:04.200 --> 26:09.320]  dr pacenic who has not been on this show since april 2002
[26:09.320 --> 26:14.520]  he got a lot of heat for it uh and even called me at the time and said is there
[26:14.520 --> 26:17.320]  a way to pull that transcript and that audio down i am
[26:17.320 --> 26:20.840]  getting excoriated at the cfr right now i'm getting a lot of heat
[26:20.840 --> 26:25.240]  and i said sorry sir it's basically the horse left the barn
[26:25.240 --> 26:29.640]  uh a long time ago but uh the point is now he's ready to come back on because
[26:29.640 --> 26:34.280]  he has been vindicated benazir budo the president of pakistan came out and
[26:34.280 --> 26:38.520]  said ben laden has been dead he was killed and she even said who killed him
[26:38.520 --> 26:42.120]  and that was the intel i was given he was dying of kidney failure
[26:42.120 --> 26:46.360]  uh he put out those letters saying this is not me and these tapes
[26:46.360 --> 26:49.160]  remember this in the news he said i did not do this
[26:49.160 --> 26:54.200]  and boom special forces went in this is the intel from folks of the white house
[26:54.200 --> 26:58.040]  they killed him and froze his hind in and he was actually killed
[26:58.040 --> 27:01.560]  uh in the area of pakistan he did actually live in that area in fact
[27:01.560 --> 27:05.880]  watson's digging up the old articles from three months before and i remember
[27:05.880 --> 27:09.160]  him so watson's digging him up he remembers him as well and he's my
[27:09.160 --> 27:13.080]  literal bloodhound i remember a news article but can't remember the 10 year
[27:13.080 --> 27:17.480]  old headline he is like a battle tested
[27:17.480 --> 27:22.680]  uh bloodhound and he will ferret it out we've got that report coming up
[27:22.680 --> 27:26.600]  where uh it was in the news that british journalists went to see him and
[27:26.600 --> 27:29.080]  there was british special forces guarding him
[27:29.080 --> 27:32.520]  who when we dig this out you guys are in trouble
[27:32.520 --> 27:38.600]  and so uh they they had him dead the word is within a month after 9 11 and all
[27:38.600 --> 27:41.800]  that stuff about he's in torabura and the delta force had him in the sides but
[27:41.800 --> 27:45.000]  they wouldn't let him kill him they were telling delta force they were telling
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.600]  army they were telling the seals that they were telling them that's him but
[27:48.600 --> 27:52.360]  then oh you can't get him to even create the narrative that it was lawyers
[27:52.360 --> 27:55.400]  you know who who who wanted to be politically correct or something and
[27:55.400 --> 27:57.800]  that oh they wanted to keep the myth of bin laden going
[27:57.800 --> 28:02.760]  that part's actually true see they put out propaganda that part of it's true
[28:02.760 --> 28:06.360]  but i mean steve pochinnick this was the right hand guy
[28:06.360 --> 28:12.600]  uh you know under henry kissinger uh he's been on record that he worked
[28:12.600 --> 28:17.160]  with bin laden when it was the muja hadin he knows him
[28:17.160 --> 28:20.600]  and pochinnick is going to be on with us again he called me back right during
[28:20.600 --> 28:23.960]  the break i had one minute left jaren and when i actually hung up on him for i
[28:23.960 --> 28:27.960]  give it back to you did you get a hold of pochinnick he is on at one
[28:29.160 --> 28:32.760]  that is super news okay so so so so he is on at
[28:32.760 --> 28:37.880]  one o'clock today this is big now i've got general hameed gul on
[28:37.880 --> 28:41.240]  and then i've got all these other guests i've kind of had jaren overbooked the
[28:41.240 --> 28:44.360]  show under my orders because i've got gul on for 30
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.680]  minutes then i got corbett then i've got jj stone
[28:48.680 --> 28:53.000]  and i've literally got all of this news and i've got incredible financial news
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.440]  i've got to go over uh the first fake photo they've
[28:56.440 --> 29:03.000]  got more fake stuff coming out i've got uh the washington post
[29:03.000 --> 29:10.200]  la times new york magazine um i saw over 30 000 articles
[29:10.200 --> 29:13.400]  with the name info wars or info wars dot com in it
[29:13.400 --> 29:16.920]  i didn't look at it myself google said 30 plus thousand i i
[29:16.920 --> 29:22.040]  should only look at a few dozen and uh some of these are actually surprisingly
[29:22.040 --> 29:24.840]  fair i thought the washington post person was being a little
[29:24.840 --> 29:29.720]  sarcastic with me but it's overall pretty fair
[29:29.720 --> 29:32.680]  and uh there's a lot of other articles the news that's actually pointing out
[29:32.680 --> 29:35.880]  that all these officials did say he was dead
[29:35.880 --> 29:39.720]  and that he was being covered up uh that he was going to be rolled out later
[29:39.720 --> 29:43.480]  so uh brett barts going with the fact that it may be a cover up
[29:43.480 --> 29:48.520]  the tea party nation is i mean folks don't buy anything the government says
[29:48.520 --> 29:54.520]  now and that's healthy we're on the march the empire's on the run
[29:54.520 --> 30:00.280]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.280 --> 30:04.360]  a very wealthy u.s citizen is predicting that in 2011
[30:04.360 --> 30:08.440]  we will witness the most important day in america in more than 50 years

[33:28.040 --> 33:33.320]  2012 kickoff of obama's campaign and they claim they jumped the body of
[33:33.320 --> 33:37.160]  bin laden in the ocean they released a fake photo sunday night
[33:37.160 --> 33:41.000]  yesterday morning had to admit it was a fake photo now they've got new fake
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.280]  photos we'll play just a few seconds of this they've
[33:44.280 --> 33:49.480]  released of course cartoons showing bin laden
[33:49.480 --> 33:55.320]  shooting his ak-47 and the navy seals taking him out we'll roll some of that
[33:55.320 --> 33:58.440]  in the background right now for folks this is so
[33:58.440 --> 34:02.840]  cartoonish and what concerns me more than anything
[34:02.840 --> 34:08.440]  is that our expert guests have broken down here on air
[34:08.440 --> 34:12.680]  webster tarpley investigative journalists wane madson others
[34:12.680 --> 34:16.040]  we've also seen this in the foreign news that pakistan was starting to make
[34:16.040 --> 34:19.720]  deals with saudi arabia the saudi arabia knows it's being double crossed by the
[34:19.720 --> 34:23.240]  west and that there was going to be big
[34:23.240 --> 34:27.240]  movement in pakistan pakistan said get your drones out of the country
[34:27.240 --> 34:31.160]  and then magically this happens there's this raid
[34:31.160 --> 34:35.960]  and now they're saying that pakistan knew he was there for six years
[34:35.960 --> 34:38.840]  as if western intelligence wouldn't know that either
[34:38.840 --> 34:42.120]  and they won't produce the body this is a serious
[34:42.120 --> 34:47.800]  frame up it looks like of pakistan moving towards serious confrontations
[34:47.800 --> 34:51.960]  lieutenant general hami ghoul former head of pakistani intelligence really
[34:51.960 --> 34:54.920]  leading the attack on the soviets in the 1980s
[34:54.920 --> 34:58.520]  hauled a hero by our media at the time now he's been called now by some of our
[34:58.520 --> 35:03.160]  media the real leader of al qaeda which he says is asinine
[35:03.160 --> 35:06.920]  general ghoul thank you so much for joining us sir
[35:06.920 --> 35:12.360]  thank you alex i know you have a lot of other media to attend to we only got
[35:12.360 --> 35:16.600]  about 25 minutes with you sir you've got the floor break down now that we have
[35:16.600 --> 35:20.280]  some more time to look at this propaganda move
[35:20.280 --> 35:24.360]  where you stand and what you believe is happening geopolitically
[35:24.360 --> 35:28.760]  well i think they are trying to park it in pakistan and i think
[35:28.760 --> 35:35.080]  it is as it was said by new york time is now gearing up he's limbering up for
[35:35.080 --> 35:38.120]  launching his third offensive against pakistan
[35:38.120 --> 35:42.040]  so i think that is where pakistan is being cornered now a case is being built
[35:42.040 --> 35:47.640]  against pakistan and they are saying that isai was harboring this great
[35:47.640 --> 35:51.960]  terrorist but at the same time if you look at it
[35:51.960 --> 35:58.040]  professionally all the time the cia the political leadership of america
[35:58.040 --> 36:03.800]  and even all the european countries and their intelligence services were
[36:03.800 --> 36:07.640]  actually putting pakistani intelligence from the wrong posse
[36:07.640 --> 36:11.720]  by saying that the high-value targets for hiding
[36:11.720 --> 36:14.840]  in north of the istanbul and that terrain which
[36:14.840 --> 36:20.440]  adjoins with afghanistan so they were pounding pakistani
[36:20.440 --> 36:26.920]  civilians and poor hapless villages there with their drone attacks with the
[36:26.920 --> 36:31.880]  health fires and with their missiles so they have caused something like
[36:31.880 --> 36:36.840]  2500 casualties when the man that they were hunting was actually
[36:36.840 --> 36:41.800]  hiding in one of the urban centers of pakistan now this is
[36:41.800 --> 36:46.040]  remarkable i mean it is not it's an intelligent okay we accept their
[36:46.040 --> 36:49.240]  version and we say that they are not
[36:49.240 --> 36:54.200]  preying up and this is not something although that is a very popular theory
[36:54.200 --> 36:59.000]  here they are in pakistan but if we were to believe every word of what
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.840]  they're saying then they are more responsible
[37:02.840 --> 37:07.560]  for misguiding pakistani intelligence other intelligence agencies
[37:07.560 --> 37:12.920]  because the cia and fbi and mi6 had been given free hand in pakistan
[37:12.920 --> 37:17.720]  to hunt down the terrorist or what they had named and we had caught so many of
[37:17.720 --> 37:21.640]  them from khalid sheikh muhammad to faraj ali b and all the others
[37:21.640 --> 37:28.120]  from the urban centers of pakistan so why were they not also responsible for
[37:28.120 --> 37:32.440]  this failure agreed that there have been intelligent failure in this
[37:32.440 --> 37:36.200]  intelligence craft failures are not something which is outlandish
[37:36.200 --> 37:41.720]  there's some time they do happen but isi instead of being lauded for its good
[37:41.720 --> 37:47.240]  work i think isi was uh has been
[37:47.240 --> 37:51.560]  scapegoated by the cia and all the other big rigs there in america
[37:51.560 --> 37:55.720]  and they want to now build a case against pakistan although pakistan really is
[37:55.720 --> 37:59.720]  suffering so much because our sovereignty has been trampled over
[37:59.720 --> 38:03.640]  our security has been reached these helicopters they had
[38:03.640 --> 38:07.320]  spotted the blind areas in our radar coverage
[38:07.320 --> 38:11.320]  and they came in as if they were the enemies of pakistan
[38:11.320 --> 38:15.800]  now it brings to light that the relationship with pakistan
[38:15.800 --> 38:20.280]  america's relationship was always one of animosity not
[38:20.280 --> 38:24.440]  of friendship and while we were being told that we are friends of america and
[38:24.440 --> 38:27.880]  we are doing everything possible for them we lost something
[38:27.880 --> 38:35.560]  like 35 000 lives in this process and we suffered a loss of 68 billion dollars
[38:35.560 --> 38:42.040]  in economic terms only and everything else that went wrong with pakistan the
[38:42.040 --> 38:47.160]  revenge war and so on so forth pakistan has suffered enormously
[38:47.160 --> 38:50.840]  but now they tell us that you are responsible for everything
[38:50.840 --> 38:56.680]  isn't it amazing and if let's say usama is the one that they
[38:56.680 --> 39:00.920]  killed yesterday why did they have to kill him he was a sick man he could have
[39:00.920 --> 39:04.040]  been hauled up in the helicopter and taken away
[39:04.040 --> 39:09.000]  and you and i'll imagine they haven't shown the pictures they used to show the
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.960]  pictures of saddam sain and they used to show his teeth also inside of his mouth
[39:13.960 --> 39:17.800]  and they used to rejoice over it and now when it comes to usama
[39:17.800 --> 39:22.200]  they are they say that dump him in the sea as soon as possible
[39:22.200 --> 39:28.280]  i think there is a lot that goes unsaid and i think it has to be it's an
[39:28.280 --> 39:32.920]  untold story which has to come out one day and i think a probe must be held
[39:32.920 --> 39:37.560]  if the american administration is reluctant to hold that probe themselves
[39:37.560 --> 39:40.920]  let the international community demand from them
[39:40.920 --> 39:47.080]  that we we ignored the 9 11 thing because you said that this had happened to us
[39:47.080 --> 39:52.120]  and we didn't ask for the evidence but now it's about time that we asked for
[39:52.120 --> 39:55.560]  the evidence general gull you brought up a point
[39:55.560 --> 39:59.640]  that is absolutely central obviously here
[39:59.640 --> 40:03.880]  the sabre rattling began against pakistan recently when pakistan said enough of
[40:03.880 --> 40:07.960]  the drones i've interviewed special forces troops on
[40:07.960 --> 40:12.360]  air we've had colonel schaefer on repeatedly
[40:12.360 --> 40:15.240]  we've had calls from listeners it's been admitted in the news
[40:15.240 --> 40:20.600]  that us troops cia special forces give an unfettered access
[40:20.600 --> 40:25.160]  everywhere in pakistan for now many many years
[40:25.160 --> 40:29.480]  and the fact that they're blaming pakistan and saying you knew
[40:29.480 --> 40:33.560]  he was there for six years you just threw the gauntlet right back down and said
[40:33.560 --> 40:37.880]  you were all over this country you've been directing the pakistani army
[40:37.880 --> 40:42.360]  into regions to back you up going into tribal areas which of course as you have
[40:42.360 --> 40:46.200]  pointed out does stir up the population and then they're called terrorist
[40:46.200 --> 40:50.120]  and now they have us believe in the heart of your west point
[40:50.120 --> 40:53.720]  in the heart of much of your intelligence system he was there
[40:53.720 --> 40:57.800]  so if he was there basically what you're saying correct me if i'm wrong
[40:57.800 --> 41:06.040]  100 six years the us british israelis they knew as well
[41:06.040 --> 41:09.560]  that's indeed because i think they have to share the responsibility they can't
[41:09.560 --> 41:12.920]  shrug it off because they were the superior partner in this war against
[41:12.920 --> 41:18.520]  terrorism and they had more resources far far far more resources
[41:18.520 --> 41:23.160]  than islai ever possessed so you were responsible equally responsible and
[41:23.160 --> 41:26.200]  besides you were all the time focusing the islai
[41:26.200 --> 41:29.800]  directing them towards the northwest frontier province why were you doing
[41:29.800 --> 41:33.400]  this now this is an they always get away
[41:33.400 --> 41:37.720]  they never are answerable they were never answerable
[41:37.720 --> 41:42.280]  to nine for nine eleven because no heads were rolled at that time none
[41:42.280 --> 41:45.480]  from the air traffic control none from the fbi none from the
[41:45.480 --> 41:50.200]  aia and none from the air force we took 112
[41:50.200 --> 41:53.720]  minutes to come into action can you imagine
[41:53.720 --> 41:57.080]  they killed us all of them if at all that was a son of a lot and i don't
[41:57.080 --> 41:59.800]  believe there are a lot of theories which are going on here
[41:59.800 --> 42:03.720]  but suppose they killed the son of a why did they have to kill him so that
[42:03.720 --> 42:09.720]  if they he's taken alive if they had asked the isai pointed out to the isai
[42:09.720 --> 42:13.560]  which they knew then isai would capture him alive
[42:13.560 --> 42:17.320]  and then he would be put on trial and he will spill the beans
[42:17.320 --> 42:22.200]  that nine eleven was not done by him and this was the fear because of which they
[42:22.200 --> 42:27.800]  didn't inform the isai and they went for this hunt themselves independently
[42:27.800 --> 42:32.760]  uh yes sir i saw in press tv at last night the iranian government is saying
[42:32.760 --> 42:39.240]  they have intel uh that uh al qaeda back from when al qaeda was the
[42:39.240 --> 42:42.680]  good guys in the 80s was going to leak the fact that
[42:42.680 --> 42:47.800]  us intelligence was basically puppeteering terrorist to then blame it
[42:47.800 --> 42:51.480]  on mujahideen and it came out last week in sky television
[42:51.480 --> 42:56.760]  that the number one al qaeda operative uh inside pakistan carrying out attacks
[42:56.760 --> 42:59.560]  on the pakistani military and this is confirmed
[42:59.560 --> 43:04.920]  was mi six it's also been confirmed even uh loftus former head of counter
[43:04.920 --> 43:07.880]  terrorist with the fbi mr loftus john loftus
[43:07.880 --> 43:12.520]  he came out on fox and said that a swat ran the seven seven bombings in london
[43:12.520 --> 43:16.920]  he is mi six and has an mi six security clearance to travel
[43:16.920 --> 43:19.400]  wherever he wishes while he's on the news as the head
[43:19.400 --> 43:23.480]  terrorist and we're all a locky trained in the us born in the us
[43:23.480 --> 43:27.720]  fox news reports does dine secretly at the pentagon and get orders
[43:27.720 --> 43:32.120]  he then runs the pat see attacks as the former head of pakistani intelligence
[43:32.120 --> 43:35.160]  someone with connections i know you don't like to speculate
[43:35.160 --> 43:41.160]  but looking at the evidence we have uh bottom line there is this group they
[43:41.160 --> 43:44.520]  call al qaeda that are really double triple agents
[43:44.520 --> 43:48.200]  uh carrying out events to then be framed on iraq
[43:48.200 --> 43:53.240]  on libya on pakistan on iran a cookie cutter whoever they want to attack is
[43:53.240 --> 43:57.320]  that a correct assessment in my analysis or can you add to that
[43:57.320 --> 44:02.840]  uh... general gul absolutely alex i think you're absolutely on the dot
[44:02.840 --> 44:06.840]  this is what they're doing they are out to conquer the world at the cost of the
[44:06.840 --> 44:09.960]  american people their comfort their lives their blood
[44:09.960 --> 44:15.320]  at the cost of their hard earned dollars they have this group is is
[44:15.320 --> 44:19.960]  devastating i mean they have they are harboring such ambition
[44:19.960 --> 44:24.920]  which are anti humanity which i anti above all the american people
[44:24.920 --> 44:29.560]  and if you give them free hand now they are trying to go for pakistan
[44:29.560 --> 44:32.760]  and this will be disaster because it desperate pakistan
[44:32.760 --> 44:36.600]  would be a terrible thing for them to handle i don't know why they are
[44:36.600 --> 44:39.560]  building up case against pakistan remand davis
[44:39.560 --> 44:45.000]  the in the uh in in that case the prussian intelligence
[44:45.000 --> 44:49.640]  gave out the information pakistan was unfortunately not able to do so because
[44:49.640 --> 44:53.160]  of the reason because americans come down hard upon them
[44:53.160 --> 44:56.840]  but he was carrying some ounces of a rich uranium
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.720]  and he was to go and carry out some kind of action somewhere else
[45:01.720 --> 45:05.720]  and then blame it on pakistan that pakistan nuclear assets are
[45:05.720 --> 45:08.920]  leaky and therefore they have to be taken out
[45:08.920 --> 45:13.560]  they have to be plucked out and this is why fear is that they have
[45:13.560 --> 45:17.400]  uh spotted the area from where they can infiltrate
[45:17.400 --> 45:21.640]  and they can come and pick up our nuclear assets or do whatever they want
[45:21.640 --> 45:24.680]  because they have such a liberty of movement here
[45:24.680 --> 45:28.440]  unfortunately because of uh provisional sheriff who was a dictator
[45:28.440 --> 45:32.280]  and they supported him to the hill and he framed such policies which are being
[45:32.280 --> 45:37.560]  now followed by the the present regime which
[45:37.560 --> 45:41.960]  called itself democratic but it is not democratic because it is the product of
[45:41.960 --> 45:47.800]  the nro the national recreation order which was actually stage managed by
[45:47.800 --> 45:54.040]  kondelizar eyes and it was signed between uh david willie van of the u k
[45:54.040 --> 45:58.680]  and uh richard voucher from the american side and of course president zara
[45:58.680 --> 46:01.240]  zari from this side and benazir at that time
[46:01.240 --> 46:05.560]  but benazir became a little violent and she started reacting
[46:05.560 --> 46:08.600]  so she had to be removed by them if you remember
[46:08.600 --> 46:12.840]  john negroponte came here and he wanted to talk to her that she was
[46:12.840 --> 46:16.040]  becoming rebellious and he refused to meet him
[46:16.040 --> 46:21.320]  and then thereafter she was no more i think this is a very dirty game which
[46:21.320 --> 46:24.760]  is being played by this group
[46:25.400 --> 46:29.480]  incredible information sir i'd like to go back to the american recently
[46:29.480 --> 46:33.000]  arrested by pakistani intelligence thank god you stopped him
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.760]  it's now been confirmed he was trying to get uranium
[46:36.760 --> 46:40.040]  to some of their cut out al-qaeda patsy's
[46:40.040 --> 46:44.920]  um to claim that uh your nuclear weapons program is leaking
[46:44.920 --> 46:50.440]  uh clearly uh they now are moving to go into pakistan
[46:50.440 --> 46:54.760]  um will they try coups to bring in a soft coup
[46:54.760 --> 46:58.840]  or according to my military sources they are preparing
[46:58.840 --> 47:05.160]  commando style attacks bombardments going in getting the nukes and then
[47:05.160 --> 47:08.520]  starting a larger attack and then having india attack
[47:08.520 --> 47:11.640]  but the word is china's not going to put up with this i mean we're talking
[47:11.640 --> 47:16.120]  about world war three general please give us the possible scenarios
[47:16.120 --> 47:20.760]  and the time frame on this well i think it was my crystal's idea
[47:20.760 --> 47:25.480]  and uh he is briefing to the uh to the president
[47:25.480 --> 47:29.320]  he had said that he only needs is a couple of helicopters
[47:29.320 --> 47:33.160]  and some commandos and an abseiling rope
[47:33.160 --> 47:37.080]  and then he can go and pluck out anything that you have and i mean
[47:37.080 --> 47:40.520]  he said i'll require a packing of three helicopters
[47:40.520 --> 47:44.840]  and they can take out pakistan's all the nuclear triggers
[47:44.840 --> 47:48.280]  but then they thought the better of it because pakistan's nuclear assets are
[47:48.280 --> 47:51.080]  dispersed and if you touch pakistan's nuclear
[47:51.080 --> 47:55.560]  assets a lot of countries in the region who are very dear to america may be in
[47:55.560 --> 47:59.480]  trouble besides that i think right behind our back china
[47:59.480 --> 48:03.960]  who is a very reliable friend pakistan will be left with no option but to
[48:03.960 --> 48:07.400]  lean upon china and that could as you are very rightly
[48:07.400 --> 48:11.640]  pointing out that could start a third world war it is very dangerous i don't
[48:11.640 --> 48:14.280]  know what why are they trying to play with fire
[48:14.280 --> 48:19.480]  because it will ignite an inferno which will consume the entire region
[48:19.480 --> 48:23.560]  they're completely power mad sir and they've been setting up a secret police
[48:23.560 --> 48:26.280]  grid a demonization grid of real american
[48:26.280 --> 48:29.240]  patriots that just want to be a good country with a bill of rights and
[48:29.240 --> 48:32.920]  constitution who don't want to be an empire but we have this wicked group
[48:32.920 --> 48:36.280]  that has seized us and it just gives me chills
[48:36.280 --> 48:40.680]  for my family and my future that that that the ran corporation others have
[48:40.680 --> 48:43.240]  said they want to start a third world war
[48:43.240 --> 48:46.040]  to try to establish this world government you notice this is all
[48:46.040 --> 48:50.280]  happening as the dollar begins to die they actually plan to kill the dollar
[48:50.280 --> 48:53.320]  in this process betray america after we're the bad
[48:53.320 --> 48:57.160]  guy attacking you and others and then europe comes out
[48:57.160 --> 49:00.120]  with its new global currency but that's more academic
[49:00.120 --> 49:03.640]  in the few minutes we've got left with you general getting back
[49:03.640 --> 49:08.920]  to your intel connections in government i know you don't like to speculate but
[49:08.920 --> 49:13.240]  we know this official story uh now they admit he didn't fire back that he
[49:13.240 --> 49:16.200]  didn't use the wife as a shield they've already put out a fake photo
[49:16.200 --> 49:19.000]  a day and a half ago they say more fake photos coming
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.120]  and we know their history of faking documents and photos
[49:22.120 --> 49:25.800]  this whole thing stinks to high heaven much of our media is turning against
[49:25.800 --> 49:29.240]  the president saying people are not buying this
[49:29.240 --> 49:34.200]  uh but uh what best do you know because now the pakistani military's been able
[49:34.200 --> 49:38.280]  to go in but it's all been scooped out uh what was there
[49:38.280 --> 49:42.680]  what is the intel what does pakistani is i what does the pakistani army
[49:42.680 --> 49:46.840]  think really went on in that compound i mean obviously it's the frame up
[49:46.840 --> 49:52.280]  of pakistan but but but uh do you have any intel on how this theater was
[49:52.280 --> 49:56.040]  executed yeah i think uh the much of it what they
[49:56.040 --> 50:00.600]  have said that the helicopter sneaking in and this that the other that is true
[50:00.600 --> 50:04.280]  because they did come and there are eyewitnesses who have reported this
[50:04.280 --> 50:07.640]  and i was just watching uh on the tv channel
[50:07.640 --> 50:11.000]  a lot of people in the neighborhood were giving the stories
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.640]  but whether usama will nothing was there or not it is not clear and they have
[50:15.640 --> 50:20.840]  hidden this fact and the isi is embarrassed and pakistan
[50:20.840 --> 50:24.600]  pakistani nation is up in arm against the isi and the army
[50:24.600 --> 50:29.640]  they look this is what you have done to us you have allowed invaders to come in
[50:29.640 --> 50:35.000]  and do things on their own and you have allowed the
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.640]  the coverage gaps why because we are investing so much money in you and this
[50:39.640 --> 50:43.720]  is what you have done to us so i think very soon there is going to be a
[50:43.720 --> 50:46.440]  policy shift as far as pakistan is concerned because
[50:46.440 --> 50:49.800]  pressure is mounting on the regime on the government
[50:49.800 --> 50:53.080]  and they will have to simply say if you were to ask me
[50:53.080 --> 50:57.320]  that you have done now your job if you think that this was the target that you
[50:57.320 --> 51:01.080]  were looking for and you ravaged the whole world because of this
[51:01.080 --> 51:06.600]  now you've got him so please finish us leave us alone and yankee please go
[51:06.600 --> 51:10.280]  home you will be also addressed your boys and
[51:10.280 --> 51:14.040]  girls are being killed unnecessarily you are scondering your dollars
[51:14.040 --> 51:17.960]  135 billion dollars a year for heaven's sake
[51:17.960 --> 51:23.240]  xp's money being scondered in afghanistan on a war which has already been lost
[51:23.240 --> 51:26.520]  generally we've only got a few minutes left with you and we appreciate your
[51:26.520 --> 51:29.800]  time general hami gul joins us former head of pakistani
[51:29.800 --> 51:34.280]  intelligence uh unfortunately uh i i want to have to relay to you in the
[51:34.280 --> 51:38.600]  rest of the world that i'm monitoring liberal conservative mainline radio and
[51:38.600 --> 51:41.880]  tv and i want to give you the bad news that they are
[51:41.880 --> 51:45.640]  in just a matter of hours first it was cut the couple billion you're given
[51:45.640 --> 51:49.000]  that as you point out you spend way you know many times
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.840]  more trying to carry out the globalist
[51:52.840 --> 51:57.720]  dictates um they're in the region so our media is acting like
[51:57.720 --> 52:02.360]  you're our welfare recipients and that the money is a blessing instead
[52:02.360 --> 52:06.760]  of a curse given to you by these devilish globalist
[52:06.760 --> 52:11.320]  but now the drum is beginning that you need to be struck that you are al-qaeda
[52:11.320 --> 52:17.320]  that that that you run bin laden uh and that you love the destabilization
[52:17.320 --> 52:21.720]  uh of all these people brought in and they are i want to confirm
[52:21.720 --> 52:27.000]  you need to know they are trying to get the american people ready to attack you
[52:27.000 --> 52:31.080]  uh and uh what would you like to say the american people
[52:31.080 --> 52:35.240]  about the propaganda they're hearing yes this is total propaganda this is
[52:35.240 --> 52:38.120]  fixing pakistan who's been a long time your friend
[52:38.120 --> 52:41.960]  you are the sole superpower today because of pakistan and because of the blood of
[52:41.960 --> 52:46.600]  the awan people whom you have with impurity and with great
[52:46.600 --> 52:50.760]  um talisman you have destroyed them please don't do that
[52:50.760 --> 52:55.720]  people of america are very good they are all very innocent i think gullible
[52:55.720 --> 53:00.040]  gullible gullibility is acceptable to an extent but please do not
[53:00.040 --> 53:03.080]  buy all the theories of these ambitious generals
[53:03.080 --> 53:07.320]  who are political generals they are not professional general i can assure you i
[53:07.320 --> 53:11.240]  am a professional man i spent two thirty six years in the army and since
[53:11.240 --> 53:15.320]  then also i've been studying and reading and i've been thinking about things
[53:15.320 --> 53:19.000]  i can assure you your generals are wrong and they have got
[53:19.000 --> 53:22.120]  obama beleaguered or he has fallen into their trap
[53:22.120 --> 53:26.120]  and this is and is going to be a disaster for everybody
[53:26.120 --> 53:30.600]  generally closing the average american uh from new york when they come to texas
[53:30.600 --> 53:32.680]  they think that we don't even really have houses
[53:32.680 --> 53:37.000]  and that we live outdoors and ride horses when we're heavily industrialized
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.240]  uh like it you know any other western area
[53:39.240 --> 53:43.160]  also many americans believe that pakistan is in the middle east they call you
[53:43.160 --> 53:47.160]  arabs they don't understand that it's a completely different system
[53:47.160 --> 53:50.920]  um and uh culture and they don't understand that
[53:50.920 --> 53:56.520]  in the war with the indians several wars the pakistan fighting five to one
[53:56.520 --> 54:01.000]  has basically defeated them and i don't think the average the average american
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.520]  kind of thinks it's oh some more push over arabs i'm not saying the arabs
[54:04.520 --> 54:07.800]  are weak they're just not well coordinated i don't think they understand
[54:07.800 --> 54:13.480]  that trying to go into pakistan uh will make vietnam and korea
[54:13.480 --> 54:18.600]  look like a cakewalk can you speak to that yes exactly like that and i i tell
[54:18.600 --> 54:21.080]  you we'll stand and fight i can assure you this
[54:21.080 --> 54:25.400]  and this is this is a very large nation is 180 million people
[54:25.400 --> 54:28.840]  we are nuclear and we are fifth nuclear power which has been
[54:28.840 --> 54:31.960]  described by none other but the american media
[54:31.960 --> 54:37.720]  and we are we are ideological we have we are self-sufficient in food
[54:37.720 --> 54:41.960]  and we have china at our back and we have the muslim world sentiment supporting
[54:41.960 --> 54:44.920]  us i can assure you it's going to be a very
[54:44.920 --> 54:48.760]  difficult proposition let's not even think of it please
[54:48.760 --> 54:53.160]  people of america stop these guys they're cheating you they are
[54:53.160 --> 54:57.560]  deceiving you and they have personal ambitions which they want to satisfy
[54:57.560 --> 55:02.360]  they're blood thirsty people they have wild ideas
[55:02.360 --> 55:06.120]  and these must be checked by people of america final point general gull will

[55:25.640 --> 55:28.520]  from the propaganda you can see the preparation
[55:28.520 --> 55:31.960]  yes people of pakistan are very aware of it and that's why i think pakistan
[55:31.960 --> 55:34.280]  government is going to be under tremendous pressure
[55:34.280 --> 55:38.760]  and you will have a revolution unless uh it is rectified in time

[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.880]  fighting as hard as we can to deprogram the public
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.720]  not with our new information but by simply getting people to question
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:39.960]  and that's happening but the globalists are still masters at launching
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.320]  the hoax and we have undoubtedly seen one of the greatest
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:48.920]  hoaxes in modern history i am going to do a
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.240]  hour of overdrive today because i want to be able to take your phone calls many
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.920]  stations do carry our fourth hour for many years i did a fourth hour but now
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.520]  i'm developing this new tv show that's very close to launching
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:05.880]  and i need that time to get preparation for it every day and do the tv show
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.760]  our own private model that's taken us three years to get to this point that's
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.880]  what glenn beck's now doing going with his own tv system
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.800]  but we're doing it from the grass roots but a lot of days i do do the fourth
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.840]  hour and i'm pulling the trigger on that right now
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:23.000]  so that we can take your phone calls it will be nothing
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  but phone calls in the fourth hour today and i will attempt to actually
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.840]  just take one call after the other also later in the broadcast i want to get
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.400]  into the unbelievable financial developments i'm going to mention some
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.520]  of those in a moment we've got james corbett a
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.960]  corporate report coming on from japan because i want to get his take
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:51.160]  as a teacher a scholar tv researcher who studies media and propaganda
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.920]  i want to get his take on this then we have o n j j stone
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.680]  computer expert and popular technology commentator
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.960]  he contacted us and wanted to come on he says he's not buying it
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.760]  we've got incredible statements by cindy sheen dealing with the propaganda
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.720]  some of her quotes that i want to go over
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.720]  i want to get her on the show too in the next few days i had promised my
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.640]  children that i was going to take them fishing
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:19.320]  thursday and friday and every time i try to take a vacation everybody's noticed
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.000]  this happens but i'm gonna have watson
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.520]  and erin dykes sitting in on thursday and friday we're gonna have watson and
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.840]  watson we're gonna have both watson brothers
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.200]  steve watson has a degree in political science great writer of course paul the
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.640]  head honcho over there just a great political mind why i hired him nine
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.440]  years ago watching him right for years on his
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.200]  own website propaganda matrix dot com
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.200]  they're going to be filling in and i think they're going to do an excellent
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.120]  job they'll also take a lot of your calls so
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.080]  people that like to call in and folks like to hear callers that's going to be a
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.000]  great bounty for you uh thursday and friday then i'll be back
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.480]  sunday but uh i've got to even though world war three
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:05.400]  is hurtling towards us in a way i i was thinking about canceling
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.360]  and if stuff continues to blow up or they attack pakistan i think it'll take a
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.280]  few weeks of hyping at first or even months or they could stay to terror
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:16.440]  attack anytime i just do the all this all these pieces
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.880]  the things i see i'm getting ready for this signifies big moves
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.760]  and you notice the financial stuff's going on the background how many years
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.320]  should we say when they get ready to finally hammer the dollar
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.840]  and when it starts plunging get ready for war and i read ran corporation
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.160]  documents on erin had political scientists i had gerald salente on two
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.080]  weeks ago that's a good point let's get gerald salente
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.440]  and paul craig roberts to pop in as many guest
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:43.720]  when watson uh is here on thursday and friday
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:48.280]  uh and erin uh i think that's the answer erin could interview him too
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.480]  like let's just get salente on for an hour with erin when he sits in because
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.480]  watson will be the first half erin uh the second half and we'll get salente
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:59.160]  we'll get um dr paul craig roberts on because you
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.960]  heard them the last two weeks for all this started saying get ready for war
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.080]  get ready for some pretext get ready for something and this is a
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.600]  false flag to say pakistan's involved with al-qaeda
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.520]  which of course they are so's our government you heard gull earlier he
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.080]  goes your government's commanding our forces
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:19.240]  um so again it's true but to a point
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:24.120]  i mean pakistan has to deal with these people and obviously the cia new bin
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.120]  lot was there but that's even a lie they just had a compound they did a staged
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.360]  event probably had the frozen body in there now
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.960]  they're admitting he didn't resist
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.400]  going off how the russians have done it now the cia's been caught the british
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.680]  would do these things with fake german officers you know they'd
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.320]  they'd use real cadavers and throw them in the ocean and have
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.840]  they'd throw out a whole bunch of them before the germans found one with fake
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.880]  codes on it was fake british dead soldiers they
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.480]  also did some fake dead german ones they probably had the frozen body
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.320]  got the cadaver in there shot it up and then these
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.280]  these seals are deader than a hammer these guys are going to be killed real
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.600]  quick this is alex jones with five good reasons you
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.000]  should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.840]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.720]  bill number two our new energies are wants to
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:15.000]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.240]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.840]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.320]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:31.160]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.120]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.200]  lose their power from weather related onages
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.640]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.760]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:46.200]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my old sponsors

[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.360]  as we're finishing off this agenda we'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:16.440]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence on our president
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.560]  in congress and they really are calling the shots
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:24.840]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.760]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.440]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty

[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.400]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.920]  and right now in washington dc we have seen
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.680]  a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:55.880]  on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:00.520]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:04.200]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:10.280]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.880]  well we just had the former head of pakistani intelligence who ran the
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:18.040]  mujahideen under ronald reagan who
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:22.360]  gull liked and admired and who reagan commended
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:26.520]  um on saying that 9-11 is an inside job staged
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:31.960]  that cia is commanding their forces against the taliban and al qaeda
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:37.160]  in pakistan they've lost 30 000 troops in this fracas
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.360]  and that here it is in the middle of a major defense complex with their west
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:46.680]  point right down the street and that he was supposedly there six years
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.360]  and nobody noticed a six foot four guy including us intelligence
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:54.920]  and us troops that are crawling all over pakistan
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:59.320]  and he mentioned uh the cia agent in fact print me that article guys
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.120]  because i want to go off even the washington post remember a few weeks
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.680]  ago cia agent caught with uranium trying to give it to muslims so they
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.680]  could blame it on the pakistani government folks they're framing pakistan
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.040]  now we can't have wars with everybody now all
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:18.760]  these u.s senators are calling for bombardments of syria
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:24.360]  the cia is admitting that they
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:28.120]  are fomenting the people in the south the muslim brotherhood again
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:32.280]  they put the muslim brotherhood in egypt now and they're banning
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:36.600]  any protest now they're using al qaeda against qaddafi you can't
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:41.480]  make this stuff up and now they say oh actually bin laden didn't fight back
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:44.120]  actually bin laden didn't use his wife as a shield
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:48.200]  actually that photo we released sunday night it wasn't real it was a photoshop
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.320]  we caught him so they had to admit that now they've got a new photoshop coming
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.000]  out they dumped the body in the sea can't you smell
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.240]  the lie here the way it's the kickoff of the campaign the good news is
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.320]  the major tea party sites are questioning it i've got those articles
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.640]  a brett bark the big spinoff guy from drudge the media powerhouse he's
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.920]  questioning it because if you have any integrity
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.920]  you cannot buy it it is it just on its face
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:20.200]  it's cartoonish now here's the washington post reporting on it here's
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:24.200]  the new york post here's the la times literally thousands of articles
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:28.760]  are attacking us right now we're going to steven
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.600]  uh pacenic coming up in the next hour
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:39.880]  he is uh the the former deputy uh to uh of course henry kissinger deputy
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:44.600]  secretary of state cfr who first broke to the world that bin laden was frozen on
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.120]  ice and was going to be rolled out expediently later
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:53.160]  then two white house sources told me oh it just goes on and on uh and then
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.960]  madeline albright came out and then walter crown kite came out and then
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.560]  teresa hines carry remember that in 2003
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.920]  i mean it's not like i just said oh they claim they killed bin laden
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:06.440]  i'm going to say it's a conspiracy theory i've been telling you this is coming
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.720]  and now we've got fake photos it goes on and on but i wanted to read to you
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:14.040]  before we go to change corbett what cindy sheen said
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.720]  on her website and i want to get her on as well probably tomorrow i'm sorry but
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.840]  if you believe the newest death of obl you're stupid that's because there were
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.680]  eight others before that sheen writes just think to yourself
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.560]  they parade sedoms dead sons around to prove
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.480]  they were dead well the first time they did it was wax figurines
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.760]  for two days they showed these heads and they later they said those are wax
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:38.600]  figurines there it is they've released the
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:42.200]  dead bin laden photo it looks
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.040]  and they're still saying they can't confirm it this is so
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:52.040]  ridiculous obama bin laden death photo with a question
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:57.080]  and who's putting this out you think the white house would put this out
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:02.760]  live leaks put it out and and and notice it looks like a wax figurine again
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.720]  the point is i've got watson digging up because i remember it in the news
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:09.400]  for a day they said here's the dead sons they had all this shrapnel and their
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:14.760]  heads are all damaged they said oh it was wax representations
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.040]  like the wax museum and now you look at that
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:21.320]  they have a green light and supposedly night vision
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:25.480]  uh light so that you can't tell and it looks
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:31.480]  so fake and he doesn't even have a gray beard the guy had a gray beard 12 years
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:35.320]  ago oh my gosh i can't handle this and
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.280]  there's the smiling troupe oh we'll see if this is another
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.920]  faked even confuse people more um continuing i'm sorry but if you believe
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:47.560]  the newest death of obl you're stupid shein writes just think to yourself they
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:50.840]  paraded sonoms dead sons around to prove they were dead
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:55.320]  why do you suppose they hastily buried this version of obl at sea
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:00.200]  this lying murderous empire that only exists with your brainwashed consent
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.280]  just put your flags away and think that's right absolutely what the flag
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:08.440]  symbolizes is being killed now i wanted to get james corbin on
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.480]  not only because i saw excellent analysis he was putting out in the nine
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.640]  other times you know he's been killed the eight other
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:18.040]  now making this nine but also he's in japan and he can report on the rising
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:22.200]  radiation levels uh there james corbin is uh edited
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.880]  webmaster the corbin report he's also has a new book coming out
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:30.200]  reportage essays on the new world order uh corbin report dot com
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:33.960]  and he joins us from japan uh it's great to have you on
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:40.680]  james give us your breakdown on this jerry brockheimer scripted situation
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:44.680]  well thank you for having me on today and uh every bit of that dread that you
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:47.800]  were talking about earlier that you feel is what i'm feeling right now
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.240]  and that's why i was up until three or four in the morning last night as well
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:55.080]  and i'm i'm not bad at it again tonight because i
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.680]  absolutely see the the shift that's going on here and i think what we've seen
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:02.680]  is really they're discarding the trump card in the war on terror because that
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:06.520]  trump card is no longer usable and so they've uh they've jettisoned their
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:10.360]  old cia asset who wasn't really working as their boogeyman anymore and
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.920]  they're taking this game to a completely different level
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:16.280]  and i i can't help but think that that means that there is some
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.280]  tectonic shifts coming up and i've been talking for for some time now i talked
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.440]  about on your program a couple of months ago about
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:27.080]  how this really represents the the beginning uh pre pre stages of of a
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.520]  lead-up to world war three in a confrontation in the long run with
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.680]  china and i think this is uh another another part on that road and i
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.600]  think obviously they're setting up pakistan for for some
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.800]  major military action in in the very near future
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.800]  and we know that uh just six days before they they rolled out this
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.360]  corpse to to tell us that osama is dead we know that just six days before the
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.280]  wiki leaks uh false flag operation released those
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:58.120]  documents from guantanamo which said that of course they've got nukes planted
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:01.560]  all over europe and they're going to unleash them if osama ever dies
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.360]  so i don't take that as a threat from the shadowy
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.640]  mythical al-qaeda terrorist organization i take that as a threat from the real
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:10.200]  terrorists who are of course puppeteering those
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:14.680]  those patsies and stuges now when i mentioned jerry ruckheimer for folks
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:19.400]  that doubt this with the private uh jessica lynch
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:23.080]  story we remember at the time i watched the video and i said this is all
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:26.280]  scripted and then i looked at maps of where us forces
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:30.440]  were they had controlled that area for at least three days
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:35.080]  uh when jessica lynch was quote rescued and they kicked in doors
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:39.640]  beat people up uh she was hiding uh you know under the hospital beb when they
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:43.480]  got there and they told her we're now going to tell you and jerry
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.000]  ruckheimer and i have the bbc reported it had written the story
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.800]  that the men wouldn't fight but she climbed up with a 50 cow on the top and
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.600]  killed dozens of them and people are like man this is good for women in the
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.320]  military and it turned out it was an army scyop
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.240]  to sell women in the military it turns out she hid in the back of the vehicle
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:05.560]  cowering and later she had to go public she said no it's it's not true
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.240]  uh it was actually several hispanic members of the team they ambushed and
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:12.200]  killed a bunch of folks i forget their names but two hispanic
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.560]  uh uh members of the team and it was just a supply
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:22.840]  detailed they fought off uh the uh the the iraqi forces and then five of the
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:27.400]  team that started saying it wasn't true they were all killed they were drowned
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:33.720]  they died in car wrecks uh in uh phoenix sarasota they were in a nice
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.960]  neighborhood having a barbecue party for one of them
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:39.480]  and a guy in a black uniform and a mask popped up double tapped him in the head
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:43.400]  total black op because they didn't want that story coming out this was all a
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.680]  black op uh we've got of course uh don't forget
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:51.640]  the nfl player uh who uh went over there and he wrote
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:55.720]  letters home uh pat tilman's and and and saying this is all
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:59.560]  made up i'm going to come back and expose it you know the drug dealing
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.920]  all of it this war is fake and they just said look you were a big recruiting
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:07.080]  tool you die and they shot him a bunch people black ops in his unit
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:10.840]  they walked up on him the army uh corners went public with this
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:13.960]  he obviously was begging and they just triple tapped right in the head
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.760]  you're going to go tell people about the drugs die sucker you're fried
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.240]  new world order so the point is brukheimer scripted the whole private
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:27.400]  lynch thing she'd been there for three days the iraqis went to the u.s forces
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.640]  who taken over and said she's here come get her
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:34.360]  they knew no iraqi government was there for three days brukheimer got the whole
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:38.520]  event ready scripted it how how she was the hero
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:43.320]  and corbin i know i'm ranting um this is so important uh it is it is important
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.280]  and and you bring out some good points earlier about the psi op that they
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:50.680]  staged with the the phony fault flash mob with those poor fluoride adult
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:54.440]  college kids and i think a lot of people that i've talked to have said well
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.720]  wow that looks exactly like what they were showing on 9 11 with the arab's
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.400]  partying in the streets and and i think that that to me is part of this media
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:05.400]  psi op because it's it seems like it's designed to give that reaction so that
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.480]  they're they're in a way showing you know the the americans are are exactly what
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.680]  they were fighting against and i think that's that's again part of this whole
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.680]  psi op that's going on right now well you're absolutely right when we come
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:21.080]  back i want to get your rundown of of what's fishy
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:25.160]  in the story in the photos with bin laden
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.480]  supposedly being dead and the larger geopolitical ramifications but in the
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:33.960]  minute and a half before break uh i i saw you when rt really rattled off a
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:39.320]  cornucopia of the history and and and why you question this right well uh
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.240]  because as i've uh as i pointed out in my article yesterday and you put up on
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:47.560]  your site uh they have now announced osama's death on on about it made
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:50.360]  her nine different occasions now that i've been able to account count and that
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.600]  was just a quick count but going back to president musher off and the afghan
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.160]  taliban and the fbi counter terror chief dale
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:00.680]  Watson and the the current president of pakistan
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:04.440]  benazir budo again and again over and over for the past nine years they've
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.000]  talked about how he's probably dead he's gone
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.680]  we got word he's he died in the pakistan earthquake in 2005
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.040]  etc etc so uh so i don't see any reason to
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:17.000]  take this one anymore uh seriously until they release
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.760]  something resembling evidence of that osama bin laden actually died
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:24.120]  but again i think to a certain extent that's a distraction uh because the
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:27.320]  real issue here is is the geopolitical moves that they're going to be making
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.960]  based on this uh orchestrated psi op and that's what's giving me chills we'll
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:34.440]  talk about the larger geopolitical when we come back but
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:38.840]  remember these are folks that murdered pat tilman and the and the and the army
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:42.360]  corner the doctor wouldn't lie he said he was shot
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.160]  at far range later the witnesses admitted the truth
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:48.520]  they shot him he begged for help they went up to helping
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.800]  and then they shot him uh from three feet
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.320]  powder burns spaced right right in his eyes
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:58.440]  shot him right in the face with the three birds from an m16
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:02.600]  and then and then they told you al qaeda killed him mother's day is this sunday

[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:32.440]  we only got five minutes left with james corbett the corbett report finishing up
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:37.240]  on the geopolitical ramifications of this the public not buying it the news is
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:40.920]  the dinosaur media panicking and then a quick report maybe i'll hold you over
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:44.360]  and just keep our next guest till maybe 35 after so
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:48.280]  some news on what's happening with the radiation stricken
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:52.600]  japan and the clouds settling in over the u.s.
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.120]  all right well on the geopolitical note i think it's extremely important to
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:00.520]  understand that pakistan is is being set up here and that the fact that osama
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:03.800]  bin laden was supposedly found just down the street from the pakistan military
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:07.720]  academy that is not by accident there's clearly an attempt to
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:11.480]  to coordinate something that will look very much
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:15.240]  will implicate pakistan the pakistani military establishment in this
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:18.840]  so in order to justify the further incursion into pakistan and we know
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:22.200]  that of course the the drones have been dropping bombs on pakistan for some
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.680]  time now so that's not necessarily a market shift in strategy it's just the
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.480]  sort of like the Gulf of Tonkin sort of made the
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:33.640]  vietnam war into an official war instead of what it was before
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.840]  so in the exact same way they're just going to try to up the and
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.040]  the entity here and escalate what's already going on
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.120]  but this is a very disturbing move because of course we see
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:48.600]  pakistan and china with their close alliance that that may even become
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:51.480]  closer of course if they're threatened by us aggression
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.400]  so there's a very very volatile situation developing here and this only
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.200]  plays even further into what's already sweeping through
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:01.320]  through the middle east of course and with syria looking
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:04.280]  looking up until this point at at any rate like it was the next in the
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.160]  crosshairs maybe there's been a bit of a change now but
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.160]  all of this is very disturbing and of course it's all predicated on the
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.920]  mythical phony war on terror with the phony bogeyman al-qaeda
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.920]  which which is okay in libya but is the enemy in
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:23.000]  afghanistan apparently well they always launch new wars
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.760]  with a big hyped pr event you can see all the scripting
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:29.880]  not just all the lies they've been caught in and notice in the last few months
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.760]  we've told folks pakistan's next pakistan's next
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.360]  they're positioning all of this because saudi arabia knows they're being
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.960]  double crossed and have run to pakistan for nuclear protection
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:43.640]  this is spiraling out of control world war three
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:47.000]  a hot war folks is right now on the table
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.040]  the globalists are seriously considering it but
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:56.440]  we go back to 2007 admiral fox fowling the head of shentcom was ordered to
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.280]  launch the attack on iran that later came out and he said no gave an
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:03.400]  interview and then resigned then chaney tried to stage the
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:06.360]  attacks on the ships that even came out in new yorker magazine
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:10.280]  with iranian ships u.s ships painted up like iranians
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.720]  but that didn't work uh i mean we are on the razor's edge
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.240]  right now james this is this is real this is this is
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:21.320]  incredibly real and and you're i mean all of the the different aspects of the
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:24.840]  way that this uh this osama bin laden syop plays into their hands is
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.960]  is mind-boggling i mean not only the fact we're coming up on the 10th anniversary
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.920]  of 9 11 thereby completely undercutting all of
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:33.800]  the momentum that was going into that for for relaunching and
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:37.080]  investigation into 9 11 all of that undermined
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.400]  as now the official story gets to tied up in a nice pink little bow
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:44.680]  with everybody cheering and waving the american flag
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:49.400]  and uh and it also plays into the this the ongoing war it plays into the
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.600]  distraction from the economy which i think is a point that ran paul was
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:57.080]  making earlier on the judgment paul etano it plays into their hands in so
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.440]  many different ways and of course then it just helps to discard one of their
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.800]  old uh bogeyman that wasn't really doing what they wanted but
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.520]  uh i i i personally i think world war three if it is to be a hot war
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:12.120]  will not get started without some sort of nuclear false flag and that's what i'm
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.480]  worried about right now especially given that they were just
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:20.600]  five days ago releasing releasing these leaked documents that that supposedly
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.600]  indicate they have hundreds of nukes you know buried all over europe or whatever
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.120]  they're trying well that's right james you you've just hit the key here
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:32.040]  you can always tell what they're going to do or or thinking about doing
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:36.920]  by the preparatory phase and it's nukes out of pakistan in america
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:41.240]  they're going to hit america or europe all of it scripted all of it building up
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:44.760]  then the cia agent caught with the uranium i mean this all happened
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:50.200]  i mean here's seeing in and let first it always not cia and then later they
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:55.560]  had to admit he was the point is this is all converging this is all moving
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:58.920]  and you notice it's happening as the dollar is plunging
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:02.840]  this is just unspeakable it is unspeakable and
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:06.440]  unfortunately i i can only see things escalating from here i don't know if
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:10.120]  there's a way for them to to back out of this at this point because uh they're
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:13.960]  they're going on this momentum right now and uh and we we are seeing such
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:18.360]  incredible movements the geopolitically right now that i think uh
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:22.760]  i think to a certain extent this is also a diversion
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.120]  diversionary tactic because we know that the economy is collapsing and they
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.400]  need to begin and to blame it on and they're going to use this let's finish
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.080]  up with more of the anomalies and then the clear scripting of all
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.480]  this and all the things they now have had to admit
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:39.960]  weren't true even inside their official uh fable
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:43.640]  and then let's talk a little bit about fukushima you're there uh in japan
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:47.320]  james corbett's our guests and we're going to talk to another uh

[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:55.480]  i mean this is what's happening right now while we're busy
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:59.240]  watching college kids run around and scream yeah us a usa
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:03.720]  what what is the usa is disintegrating uh but
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:09.720]  we also have 500 times safe levels i want i want to point out for your
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:12.920]  listeners and viewers right now you're still right about all the storm clouds
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:16.600]  that we we can see coming off on the horizon while people are busy partying
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:20.120]  and we're trying to get ready for it but i'm i'm i want to concur with something
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:23.400]  you said earlier you made an exceptionally important point about how
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:27.560]  people are not falling for this i op and i've i've seen that going on online
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:31.800]  right now as well i've had over 50 000 views of my good morning america
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.240]  learns bin laden is cia video in the last 24 hours
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:38.920]  and uh the vast majority of the comments on there are people saying this is
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:42.760]  ridiculous they buried the body at sea this is this is insane i don't
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:45.800]  believe any of this there are so many people out there right now who are
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:49.320]  questioning this and people who even would normally fall for this type of
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.920]  stuff are not falling for it right now so people really need to get out there
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:56.680]  and start stressing and and pointing out the al-qaeda myth and all of the
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.240]  various parts of that because i think people are
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:02.200]  very receptive to it at this moment and this is the moment where we can
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:05.480]  inoculate people with truth so that they can be armed with truth
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:08.920]  for when they try to stage whatever type of false flag or whatever type of
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:13.800]  precipitating event they're going to try to stage the system is going after
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:18.600]  the lowest common denominator i went and saw a month ago the battle for la
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:22.920]  uh about space aliens invading and it's the worst movie i've ever seen
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:26.760]  but it was done over the top sicky sappy
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:30.360]  an admitted marine corps ad and it's not that i'm against the marine corps
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.360]  folks it was a recruiting ad for kids with a little kid crying saying i'm your
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:38.280]  little marine you are my little marine and i mean it
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.720]  it is nothing but a giant recruiting ad they admit the pentagon pays millions
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:46.040]  for this to be put in we know propaganda when we see it
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:48.920]  and the point is we're being propagandized and it's the same thing with
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:53.080]  this the sicky sweet way it's rolled out how it's done for
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:56.280]  lowest common denominator where any thinking person
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:00.200]  sees how ridiculous it is it's just incredible
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:05.560]  closing points on japan two very important stories came out last week
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:09.400]  that kind of flew under the radar as as the fukushima situation gets swept
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.840]  under the rug but two very important points one of them the
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:15.960]  the one of the radiation advisors to the prime minister
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:19.880]  a professor at a university here resigned in disgust with the government
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:23.000]  saying that they're politicizing what's going on here and they're just
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.760]  tinkering with radiation like maximum allowable radiation levels and things
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:30.360]  like that for political purposes so that was a very important point that's
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:33.960]  extremely unusual for advisors to the prime minister to just resign out of the
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:37.800]  blue like that here in japan and then another story about the
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:40.920]  the japanese meteorological agency coming under fire because they're doing
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:44.520]  these detailed fallout radiation fallout prediction
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:47.480]  predicting the path of the fallout and where it's going to go but they're not
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:49.880]  releasing it to the public and they're coming under fire for this but
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:53.720]  basically they're saying oh the ignorant and uneducated public just
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:57.400]  wouldn't be able to handle it because they they panic over this so
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:01.480]  by the way the top radiation advisor to the government
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:04.440]  quit and said levels are much higher than you've said
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:07.480]  you didn't even evacuate schools 12 miles away
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:11.080]  while the koreans are wearing masks and not even going out
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:14.520]  in the last month we see the stoic japanese façade slipping a little bit
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:17.560]  because some of the parents of those people in that area are starting to
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:20.440]  get angry and telling the government we don't want our kids playing in these
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:25.800]  radioactive sandboxes out there yes and and on top of it you notice
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.600]  you've got japanese top people coming out and saying
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:32.360]  they're covering up radiation levels they admit 500 times safe levels of
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:35.000]  different isotopes found in milk and food all over the us
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.760]  because more and more keeps belching out and they say it may be melting down for
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:41.640]  years now and then building up as it hits us and our
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:45.160]  government just raises the radiation level
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:48.680]  thousands of times what it previously was and says everything's fine
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.040]  and there's not even a discussion of it here i mean this is incredible
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:56.200]  is is it is incredible and uh elix you're familiar with the the video of that
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:00.040]  mayor of minami soma who went on youtube and said the government's not telling us
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:02.200]  anything and and they're not helping us out
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:06.920]  yes i am and and and with all of the royal wedding diversions and
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:11.400]  with the diversions with the bin laden uh we're not focusing on a lot of things
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:14.760]  we should have and and and vukashima is getting worse for those that don't know
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:18.600]  not matter and that mayor actually is i'm in touch with someone who's in touch
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:21.320]  with that mayor and he wants to come on the program so i'm going to fire that

[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:32.760]  when you say stuff uh internet tv show host public speaker
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:36.120]  on top is including social media technology and politics

[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:45.720]  uh and and and questions that he has uh with the capture of bin laden uh oh and
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:48.840]  good to have you on with us thanks for having me on alex appreciate it well
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:52.920]  break it down you've got a whole laundry list here uh does not in the war
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:57.640]  um i mean you just run through the inconsistencies um well
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:01.160]  sunday night you know uh like everybody else i sat on the internet and i made
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:04.840]  jokes about usama being dead and it was funny and all that kind of stuff
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:07.720]  had a good time and as soon as the president got done talking i turned off
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:11.000]  my television and i just watched the stream on twitter and
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.720]  facebook of people talking about what cnn was saying
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:16.680]  fox was already making mistakes and stumbling on themselves
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:20.120]  and i just was like and that's exactly watching off mainstream media
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:23.960]  and you know it's all fun and games to say oh the guy's dead but
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:27.880]  the the way that people reacted i mean people ran to ground zero i have a lot
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:30.680]  of friends in new york i do business in new york i'm there all the time
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:34.280]  there are two holes in the ground after 10 years and for people to run to that
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:38.360]  scene to cry and sing and and jump on top of lamp post
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:42.200]  drives me insane i'm like 10 years oh so i'm a one so
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.640]  whether he was dead five years ago or he was dead yesterday or
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:51.000]  he's not dead the guy won 10 years of terror we haven't built a tent
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.120]  in new york city ground zero and the president wants to go there on thursday
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:58.440]  for what to look at two holes in the ground it's insane to me
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:01.800]  and you know after sunday night of having fun with it it's just like well
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:05.960]  there goes the talk on the economy there goes a talk on education
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:09.480]  let's ramp up more talk on war and we're obviously not going to cut that out of
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:12.520]  the budget so my mind blew and listening to your
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:15.720]  show today you know the the thing is it doesn't even matter
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:18.680]  if the guy's dead or not because of all the other stuff that they're going to do
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:22.520]  in spite of whether he's dead or not well you hit the nail on the point
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:28.520]  or the nail on the head all over talk radio all over television
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:32.280]  liberal conservative it's all the same we're going to get back on national
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:36.120]  security now uh you know even uh if we don't have
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:39.320]  new wars it's good to get folks unified and worried
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:43.000]  about our outside threat that'll help the economy they want to divert
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.680]  everybody on the plunging dollar everything else that's happening
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:49.880]  and now they want to frame pakistan if you were listening
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:53.800]  oh doctor then you heard our last guest and you heard general gull earlier
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:56.840]  i mean they're clearly trying to frame pakistan for this and you and gull
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:00.120]  pointed out us intelligence is all over our country
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:03.240]  your military's here you didn't know he was there for six years
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:08.040]  i mean this story is just impossible and now they dump the body in the ocean
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:12.360]  well the the fun thing about that is um two things first i'll talk about from
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:15.480]  the ground level you know i'm not an expert on a lot of fields in this space
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:19.560]  but i do talk to people and people in new york it was split between oh happy day
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:23.800]  and oh my god what's going to happen they instantly put that fear into people
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:27.000]  as soon as they got done saying osama was dead they instantly flipped on the
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.280]  switch of well there might be retaliation there might be
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:34.520]  retaliation every single outlet every single major news network said it
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:39.080]  and the problem with america is people get tired really quick of negativity
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:42.360]  so maybe they don't listen to shows like yours or listen to the corrections
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.040]  they listen that first night the next day and then they turn it off
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:49.640]  so that all they got is osama's dead they throw them off they don't know
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:52.440]  the lies that they've already been caught in or anything like that
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:56.120]  so it's really the the machine has already started and you know
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:59.160]  thank god for the internet thank god for independent shows like yourself
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:02.920]  because people just need to understand that you know what are you supposed to
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.840]  be afraid of if you're going to be afraid you're supposed to be afraid
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:09.160]  the last 10 years regardless the guy's dead apparently whatever
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:12.200]  it's not going to raise my threat level unless the government wants to raise the
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:14.680]  threat level i mean our previous president told us
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:17.000]  there are weapons of mass destruction and there weren't so i'm supposed to
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.120]  believe this president to tell me that there's weapons of mass destruction
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:24.280]  it's it's a tired sad game and heaven forbid
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:27.320]  if we fall for it especially after watching japan you and i just talked
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:30.360]  about japan last month and you were right on the fact that they're
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.960]  covering up stuff and lying the day after i was on your show they had to come
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.840]  out and and retract a lot of things and pull things back
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:40.040]  so people should know they can't trust governments
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:44.600]  they should know well that's that's the central point is a credibility issue
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:48.200]  government lies even when the truth would serve them because they're liars
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:51.960]  and they're constantly lying they're constantly being caught in lies
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:57.480]  remember uh jessica lynch where they said she was this big commando woman and
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:01.480]  killed all these iraqis and turned out she cowered and it wasn't true and when
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:04.680]  the survivors said it wasn't true they were all killed
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:08.520]  i mean folks look that up and then she went public said it's true i was hiding
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:12.680]  under the thing and they had jerry brockheimer a script
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:16.440]  saving her from the hospital when the iraqis had pulled out three days before
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:20.840]  and the iraqi doctors had contacted the americans saying you know come get her and
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:23.480]  so they scripted a whole hollywood thing saving her
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:27.560]  and remember pat tilman it came out that they murdered him they killed him
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:31.880]  they shot him at a distance uh later the unit admitted he begged for help
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:34.680]  and then somebody went up there and shot him three times in the head at point
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:38.280]  blank three feet away and the media said al qaeda killed him
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:41.480]  of course they lie i mean what do people think
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:45.480]  well the the biggest thing about pat tilman is um his parents
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:48.920]  and his parent he's a he's a football player you can't kill a football player
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:52.120]  get away with it his parents immediately went to mainstream media you can't
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:55.960]  take them out so they get to champion formative and if they want relentless
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.480]  that story would have been covered up and as far as his female officer my
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.360]  daughter's never going into the military because as much they want to talk about
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:05.480]  that they never talk about how many women are are sexually harassed and or
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:08.840]  raped uh overseas in the military you know they always
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:12.680]  suppress that they they oh yeah well most women the military are basically
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:16.520]  camp girls yeah yeah so you know they don't ever want to talk about that
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:19.960]  issue you know you see the special in hbo they run like once or twice and they
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:23.880]  get pulled off because it's bad bad business and like
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:27.400]  you said the government pays a lot of money to a lot of media outlets
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:32.600]  to perform and project this image and uh you know at some point it's got to stop
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:37.240]  i keep telling people like it's not a war on drugs you know you can get drugs
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:40.200]  anytime you want anybody listen to this program knows somebody that can get them
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.840]  drugs and if you don't know somebody you can go to your pharmacist down the
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:46.440]  street and get quote unquote legal drugs prescribed to you
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:49.800]  but they can't stop drugs the one tear who's tear
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:52.920]  i don't know what tear is i'm scared my dog might run into the street is that
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:56.760]  tear i don't know the room stay there stay there let's break it more down

[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:33.480]  facts all the info all the research i mean i've interviewed the heads of the
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:38.440]  embassies i've interviewed sible edmunds the fbi translator that heard
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:42.360]  the cia commanding al-qaeda for months before 9 11
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:46.360]  running white slavery that sex slaves running drugs
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:51.000]  running weapons running in communication with someone calling
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.320]  himself was someone been logged in she didn't know
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:55:00.360]  but it was cia i mean that's on record she testified to congress and they
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:05.000]  gagged her and there's hundreds of these people
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.320]  there's hundreds of them people like well why are you saying you don't believe
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:11.160]  the official story why are you believing anything that comes out of their
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.960]  mouths this is the government that stole tens of
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:17.240]  trillions of your tax money and gave it to foreign banks and wouldn't let you
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:20.760]  know where it went and wouldn't tell congress and finally lawsuits got
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:23.480]  filed by private interest and they found out
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:28.520]  about five percent of it or a little less and it was almost a trillion bucks
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:35.080]  much of it to msnbc secretly and others we got a crew of gangsters running
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:38.680]  things and now they're trying to frame pakistan
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:43.400]  going back to the oh doctor and that's on jj stone
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:47.080]  going through more of these points we're now seeing literally hundreds of
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:51.160]  articles with the media pointing out that a lot of people aren't buying this
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:54.520]  it's funny the tea party folks and some of the republicans aren't buying it
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:58.360]  because they don't like obama and they see it as a political score for him
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:02.280]  but those that are sophisticated know obama bush they come and go these
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:05.000]  people are frontmen what's your take on that
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  um to end my point last thought it's the war on finance all this have you just
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.120]  said about the money going somewhere that's our war that no one wants to talk
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:14.920]  about that's the war the government never wants to say the words to you but
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:18.600]  it's the war on finance the poor get poor so they you know
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:21.400]  white slavery trade slavery slavery in general because you're stuck at the
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:24.520]  bottom and you can't do anything without money you can't
[01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:28.600]  make gopaks to survive you can't run out of the country for a couple of months
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:32.280]  if uh you know as hits the fan you're kind of screwed
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:35.400]  if you don't have capital and the right capital and the right investments
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:38.600]  you know you promote uh gold and silver stuff with some of your advertisements
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:42.040]  things that people just don't know about and uh you know the president being a
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:45.720]  frontman he's a smiley happy guy you know i i don't even not like the president
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:49.480]  i like the president he's a fun happy guy i don't know what he does
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:53.320]  i don't really know you know what he gets done if you just watch the fact that
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:55.720]  you have to sit there and listen to somebody like donald trump
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:59.160]  then he goes in and and and pulls out his birth certificate oh so let's shut
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:02.440]  donald trump down then he makes fun of donald trump on saturday all night
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.240]  long in this congression then sunday night he drops his bin line bomb i'm
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:09.240]  like if that's not a pr real if that's not you sat down with a pr agent they
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:12.440]  said okay we're gonna hit him with a softball a medium ball and we're gonna
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:16.760]  bring it home with this and then monday and then monday with all cameras on you
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:20.920]  you'll present posthumous medal of honor and they'll talk i mean it's all
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:25.320]  exactly you're a media guy you can see the scripting jerry
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:30.840]  brockheimer scripted saving private lynch and it turned out it was all fake
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:36.440]  and then people were murdered us army was murdered who said it was a lie and then
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:39.720]  it came out it was a lie these people script things
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:43.400]  of course it's bald it's you know what it is
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:46.920]  it's it's a show it's a show and anybody who has any watched any kind of sitcom
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:49.720]  or tv show you know you're ramping up with something light and then you hit it
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:52.200]  with some of the middle and then you bring it home at the end of the show
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:55.640]  and and that's that's all it is and i mean like and literally the news was
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:59.000]  dominated by a freaking couple getting married they spent 36 million dollars
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.960]  that's not our money but taxpayers money that shows you how much the rich care
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:05.080]  about the poor i mean england screwed with their with their finances but they
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:08.840]  got enough money to spend 36 million dollars on a wedding for rich kids
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:12.200]  okay that's that's how the rich think and that's how the powerful thing so you
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:15.320]  sit there and you watch the president he knocks that out of the mainstream media
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:19.080]  with his birth certificate and then like i said he sits there and they have dinner
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:22.920]  ten thousand twenty thousand dollar plate to sit there and watch this guy make
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:26.440]  jokes i mean you talk about finances i mean a billion

[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:31.800]  they got scientists against it and for you know people want to argue the fact
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:34.920]  that they didn't bring this fool's body home you you've been looking for a guy
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:38.120]  for 10 years and you throw them in the ocean you throw them in the biggest
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:41.160]  place that nobody could ever find them you you throw them in the ocean you don't
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:44.840]  incinerate them you know and then you want to tell me dna you threw them in
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:47.400]  the ocean thank you i i thank the government
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:50.920]  for saying that they threw some in line in the ocean because no my daughter's
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:53.080]  three years old and she couldn't believe that story
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:56.040]  she'd be like daddy why didn't they bring the prince home to show everybody
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:02:01.640]  and parade him through the streets nobody could believe that no one
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:05.880]  and remember the first photo they put out was a photo shop and folks then and
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:09.800]  all these newspapers had it posted as a real photo of the dead bin laden
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:13.000]  and then they just kind of said oh that was fake too and now they say oh
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.440]  yeah he didn't fight back and he didn't throw his wife in front of him
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:22.360]  and that's a trick liars dude they're like oh my general story is true
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:25.640]  we did kill bin laden but there were a few things we got wrong you're like oh
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:27.880]  well you told me the truth on that it's kind of like
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:31.960]  uh when i go to the cookie jar an entire bag of cookies have been stolen
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:35.080]  and i go to my son and my daughters and i call them before me and i say
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:39.240]  who stole the cookies and they'll sit there and go uh well i only ate one i
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:43.160]  mean 20 i mean i'm sorry this is incredible
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:47.160]  the the best thing about things like uh pictures and videos anymore
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:50.600]  their programs that techies run that they can scan and see if it's been
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:53.640]  photoshopped so i mean the mainstream media should
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:57.320]  know this there there are people out there that are highly skilled and way
[02:02:57.320 --> 02:02:59.640]  more skilled than them and working independently
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:03.320]  that that check that uh fact check these things i mean literally there's a
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:06.600]  program that runs it'll tell you photoshop uh pictures been photoshopped
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:09.960]  or not but instead they still put it out there because mainstream
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:13.160]  people don't get it they don't know so they just want to trick those people
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:16.760]  and get the ball rolling and you know drag us into another war if you want
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:21.560]  to i mean again people are are going broke right now the
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:25.160]  the gas is too high and people getting rich off of that exxon just posted
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:28.200]  you know trillion dollars whatever last quarter profit i mean people are sick
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:30.440]  and tired of it they they just can't handle it anymore
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:35.080]  you hear g making 14 billion dollars in profit not paying one cent in taxes
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:39.000]  people people can't handle it and and thank god they put this man in ocean
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:42.120]  do you know what made me laugh do you know what happened just down the road
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:44.120]  from me i've i've been to the hotel in the bar in san
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.760]  Antonio it's cross the street from the alamo
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:50.760]  where the rough riders teddy roosevelt william randolph hearse and others
[02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:55.400]  uh got the order to go start a war in cuba as the pre-tax to start the war
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:57.800]  with the spanish then of course they blew up this
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:01.960]  battleship main as the pre-tax is a false flag to attack all the spanish
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:05.240]  possessions in the pacific philippines you name it
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:09.320]  but william randolph hearse told all of his illustrators with his newspapers he
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:12.920]  said you provide the paintings the images i'll
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:17.640]  provide the war and they ran fake they were even able to do this then
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:22.440]  illustrations and even doctored photos in newspapers nationwide that they were
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:26.280]  engaged in atrocities in in uh cuba the spanish
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:29.720]  and later they admitted it was all fake and and that's what they're doing this
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:34.520]  is the modern yellow journalism it's set up to play that game
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:38.120]  and again you know what's already said pr stunt and and everything set up
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:41.160]  so that people will believe something but when you make a big mistake
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:44.600]  after big mistake after big mistake people can't swallow it you know if
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:48.040]  you're gonna tell me the guy's dead just tell me there's dna tell me you set up

[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:22.280]  it's just incredible information in early 2002
[02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:26.440]  i was put in touch with dr steve pacinic
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:30.360]  and i'll give you his bio very prestigious here in a moment
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:33.320]  working under the biggest king makers in modern u.s history

[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:40.440]  henry kissinger and syris vance but the big three
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:44.920]  uh from all of our sources george solz james baker way above even kissinger
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:49.240]  that's why you don't even see them out there and these are the guys that go
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:52.680]  right to the elite of the world and are their imperial legates the people that
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:56.040]  speak for them that make the deals with china with russia
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:09:00.280]  they're the envoys they're the above government power brokers
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:03.960]  uh that that that are the spokesman of the collective
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:10.120]  elite uh and these top councils and he was their deputy all three of them and
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:16.040]  in syris vance as well high powered all four of them and i got him on the show
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:20.280]  and he also see a farfellow at the time
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:23.560]  i got him on the show and he just basically said this whole war on terror
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:26.760]  as a hoax and he said the intel is they've got
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:30.600]  been lauding dead on ice and they're going to roll him out
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:33.720]  sometime in the future and i said ice he gives literally
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:37.320]  now then about a year later uh at an event
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:41.960]  i had a well-known republican uh part of the bush administration
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:45.080]  i mean i'm the well-known enough that i knew who they were
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:48.360]  uh call me aside in an event and say listen this is off record
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:51.080]  because i was already known then as being somebody who can keep secrets if
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:54.280]  it's off record as a journalist the more secrets you keep the more secrets
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:57.480]  you get uh that's why we get so many pour in the
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:02.200]  mayac homeland security reports you name it we're a regular wiki leaks here
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:05.560]  uh it's just that our info is real not sprinkled like theirs
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:12.280]  now dr pacenic came on and then hades broke loose after he came on he said he
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:15.880]  was on ice and all this happened and i looked up pacenic i mean he was there
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:20.040]  with the muja hadin knew these people uh talk about
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:23.400]  somebody who's living history i mean he's seen so much of it
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:27.640]  but then after i talked to one white house official and then another person
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:30.840]  well known to me got it from another white house source
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:34.200]  i'm just gonna leave it at that so two sources that i actually talked to one
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:39.080]  on air one privately and then the other through someone i know for decades
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:42.840]  who was told the same information and they said this isn't a rumor right they
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:46.280]  said no he's dead the intel was it was a cover
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:49.240]  story the kidney stuff he reportedly was sick from that that he
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:51.880]  they went ahead and got rid of him because he was putting those letters out
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:55.320]  saying i didn't do it and they wanted to take his identity and have him say he
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:58.200]  did but dr pacenic can correct me if i'm wrong
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:01.480]  and that they did send in special forces so in a way it's true and they killed
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:04.600]  him uh and have had him literally frozen uh
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:07.720]  now they throw him in the ocean you know all this stuff comes out it's just
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:10.840]  ridiculous they put out photo two days ago that was
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:14.040]  fake now they'd say another one's coming
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:17.720]  so all of this is happening but but a year after
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:20.840]  i talked to him these other sources told me the same thing and then about six
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:23.000]  months later madeline albright went on fox news
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.160]  we have links to all those articles and videos uh in our article inside sources
[02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:30.360]  bin laden's corpse has been on ice for nearly a decade
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:34.840]  that has all the bibliography there for you and i'm just prefacing this before
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:37.560]  we go to dr pacenic because it's so important a lot of folks are tuning in
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:41.320]  and watching right now a record audience
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:45.640]  that madeline albright came out and said the word is he's on ice
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:48.440]  use that same term and they're going to be rolling him out for the election
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:51.960]  then walter kronkite behemian grove super high level
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:55.720]  hanging out with the top people that's kind of the democratic wing they got
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:58.440]  word that this was going to happen if bush needed it
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:03.000]  then teresa hinds carry came out uh as the proxy for her husband
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.160]  and said yeah this is the word so that scared bush into not releasing it by
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:10.600]  the way i got threats over this all sorts of dirty tricks
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:14.200]  when i was pushing this and then it receded into history for another six
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:18.760]  seven years and now it's back exactly the script we were told
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:21.800]  uh so if you're a new listener or if you're the washington post
[02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:26.360]  or the new york times or new york magazine or la times
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:29.800]  attacking me over this actually a few of the articles are actually pretty fair
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:33.240]  but some of them are ridiculous like the new york magazine
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:39.000]  or the atlantic with jeff goldberg uh they're attacking us in cartoonish
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.160]  ways if you're doubting this look at the history
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:47.000]  we already have been a zeer budo coming out
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:50.680]  and saying look bin laden's dead stop using him as a pretext to be in pakistan
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:54.760]  a week later she's killed our media says she hit her head
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:58.040]  and then they released video of her being machine gunned by the assassin
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:00.360]  and the word from hameed ghoul and others from right of pakistani
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:04.040]  intelligence is the white house pulled the trigger on her
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:07.960]  um now our guests start telling us and our experts are telling us there's
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:10.360]  going to be a move against pakistan the last month
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:13.560]  then they catch this cia operative cnn reports
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:17.400]  with the uranium trying to get it to muja hadin to then blame it on
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:21.800]  the regular army of pakistan for to build the case to snatch their nukes
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:25.720]  which will bring china in folks this could be world war three
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:29.720]  uh so all of that's happening uh you have all these other world leaders that
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:35.080]  have said this now i'm going to try uh to now give the floor uh to our guests
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:40.600]  dr steve pacenek serve as deputy assistant secretary of state and senior

[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:06.680]  your audience for listening i want to say how important alex
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:11.480]  jones was after 9 11 when i knew very well at that time
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:16.120]  that the american public was being deceived and was being treated as if we
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:22.040]  were fools stupid ignorant and chiefs i had hoped at that time once i was on
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:25.800]  the alex jones show and i broke ranks with my people at the
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:29.640]  council on fire relations i'm a member also of the
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:33.400]  uh association of former intelligence officers the natural military
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:38.680]  intelligence association and i volunteer repeatedly i volunteered to
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:42.840]  still work with our military because number one i respect our military
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:46.200]  number two we have sent men and women to wars
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:51.720]  which have not been clearly defined by civilians who have never been in war
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:57.880]  including clinton including bush junior in particular who precipitated the
[02:15:57.880 --> 02:16:01.080]  wars into iraq in afghanistan and now
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:07.000]  obama and i had hoped by that time in the past that we have would have stopped
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.920]  fooling the american public and stopped creating an incursion into into our own
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:18.040]  country killing our own people 9 11 has still not been fully explained
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:22.760]  and it is not a conspiracy theory it has nothing to do with all kinds of
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:27.480]  secrecy and cabal and any other issue it has to do with a
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:33.000]  famous technique in warfare that we call stand down false flag deception and
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.640]  denial it was done during bro harbour uh alex explained to
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:43.960]  yesterday it was done by hitler it was done by lbj during the war in vietnam
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:47.560]  where we had the gulf of tunkin and he claimed that we had
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:52.680]  a uh false flag operation and we had to shoot the vietnamese because they shot
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:57.640]  it that was wrong many men died for that many men went to war
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:01.640]  and at the same time we had a stand down in a false flag which was
[02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:05.080]  told to me repeatedly by the people i worked with
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:09.720]  including a very famous general that i will not repeat his name to protect him
[02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:15.000]  until i go to a grand jury now what i'm saying today is very important
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.280]  i was a deputy assistant secretary under nixon
[02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:23.320]  ford and came under special uh and carter i resigned under car because i
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:27.320]  disagreed with the way he handled the hostage situation i came back
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:32.040]  under reagan to take down the soviet union i came back under bush senior to
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:35.880]  work on cambell cambodia i'm not a career foreign service
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:40.280]  i'm not a career intelligence officer i am what every american is i'm a
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:44.920]  position but i'm an entrepreneur i create businesses and i believe
[02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:49.240]  in the american way of life which is very simple the hope
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:53.800]  the faith the dedication and the lack of interference in my job
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:59.000]  in my pocketbook and in my speech and the ability to say what i want to say
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:03.320]  by the government that doesn't mean i'm a tea party member i'm a liberal
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:07.560]  i'm a conservative or i belong to any party i am strictly an american and
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:12.760]  i'm saying this to you as americans we have once again been deceived
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:17.880]  i thought this would cease and desist by the time bush jr was elected and
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:21.080]  thrown out i had asked that bush jr be indicted for
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:24.920]  work criminals cheney be indict ron spelt
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:29.560]  condoleezza right steve hadley it goes on and on and on
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:34.920]  the issue now is we have brought to the forefront at a time when america is in
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:39.880]  deep pearl economically as alex jones has correctly explained to you
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:43.240]  we are in deep pearl because we are in two wars
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:47.560]  of which i have no idea why we're there and i had warned even on the alex
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:51.960]  jones show nine years ago not we will go into afghanistan and
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:56.360]  iraq after the 911 and i predicted and he was
[02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:59.240]  correct alex jones and you see it on your website
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:05.320]  that osama ben laden would be dead and had been dead for over seven months not
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:09.560]  because special forces killed them but because as a position i had
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:14.360]  known that the cia physicians had treated him and it was on the
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:19.080]  intelligence roster that he had marfan central now many of you can look up on
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:24.040]  the internet marfan central it's a disease which is the
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:28.280]  genetic abnormality which linkin abraham abraham lincoln had
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:31.320]  and it was the disease of the cataract of the eyes
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:35.320]  of the coronary arteries and what happens in that disease
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:40.360]  is that you have a very short lifespan the fact that he had renal dialysis was
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:43.640]  not an issue of renal stones which can be cured
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:49.160]  and is not that serious to life so uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:54.280]  life-threatening but he needed that dialysis machine so he had to take it
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:56.600]  with him it was not an accident that is
[02:19:56.600 --> 02:19:59.720]  number two man ellswar theory was a physician
[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:03.960]  it is not an accident that most leaders of terrorist organizations around the
[02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:07.720]  world are physician that's why i know them because we understand
[02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:12.280]  our poetry of ethics and creed osama bin laden died
[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:18.040]  when we went into afghanistan general tommy franks had stated very clearly
[02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:22.680]  that he had died and he made a slip now we knew he had already
[02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:27.560]  died by that time by the time we had already gone into afghanistan he was
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:31.560]  and in pakistan we knew he was dead so the notion
[02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:35.720]  when i came on the radio show in 2002 with alex jon i said listen
[02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:39.800]  osama bin laden is dead he's dead there's no question about it he had
[02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:42.920]  marfan syndrome had nothing to do with special forces
[02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:47.880]  he was used in the same way that 9-11 was used to mobilize
[02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:53.960]  the emotions and feelings of the american people in order to go to a war
[02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:58.840]  that had to be justified through a narrative that bush jr created
[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:03.080]  and cheney created about the world of war terrorism now i have been in that
[02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:07.080]  world for 30 years during 30 years we had never been
[02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:12.440]  attacked in america i repeated again the question is not that we are safer now
[02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:16.760]  we are no but we're not safer the issue is we had never been
[02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:21.560]  attacked up till 9 11 because bush jr cheney
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:25.480]  romsfeld and a group of other generals who involve
[02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:30.680]  i know who they are and they know who i am we decided that we had to mobilize
[02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:35.720]  the public in order to create a war on terrorism which is an oxymoron
[02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:39.720]  that war on terrorism no longer exists we went into iraq
[02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:44.120]  our military forces and i have to tell you i have the greatest respect for our
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:49.800]  military men and i'm saying this to you the generals the colonels the majors in
[02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:52.680]  the captain and i've been lecturing at the war
[02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:57.080]  college every year be careful of the orders you receive from civilian
[02:21:57.080 --> 02:22:00.440]  president i say it again and listen to me
[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:05.640]  be aware of the orders that you receive from civilian presidents like bush
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:11.560]  clinton and obama particularly presidents who have never served in a war and
[02:22:11.560 --> 02:22:15.080]  do not know what the consequences of the war and the
[02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:20.360]  number of men and women who die die bravely for our country in our cause
[02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:24.920]  because some civilian has to manipulate his political career
[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:29.640]  at the expense of the american public and at the expense of the bodies and the
[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:33.720]  blood and guts of our warriors who are so important to us
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:38.040]  all right the doctor absolutely dr steve pochennick is our guest
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:41.080]  will even have a little bit of the next hour he's very gracious
[02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:44.840]  and i want to get more into that entire area
[02:22:44.840 --> 02:22:50.840]  that you were just raising and i'm talking about my white house sources so
[02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:54.680]  obviously they were probably given this info i know that you said
[02:22:54.680 --> 02:23:01.160]  he was dying of the disease i'd seen the videos of him and even 98 99 he looked
[02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:05.080]  like somebody who was near death then obviously very ill
[02:23:05.080 --> 02:23:10.440]  uh the new photos they show us uh the c i even had to admit last year
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:14.120]  and spy talk in the washington post that that they were fake videos
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:18.840]  so it's on record they put fake videos out i think that's very bold of them
[02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:24.120]  to tell the washington post may 25th 2010 spy talk that they did fake them
[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:27.720]  we already knew that we've seen the adam gadan videos uploaded
[02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:31.720]  in the same video layer as uh the intel centers
[02:23:31.720 --> 02:23:37.560]  logo uh we've got uh amaralla locky admittedly
[02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:41.880]  alex the key the mr jones the key question america has to ask again and
[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:46.200]  why i went back on your show is this has much greater implication just than
[02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:49.000]  the distortions and lies that are created by the
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.600]  intelligent community and believe me i work with the intelligent
[02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:56.280]  the question is why does that have to be done repeatedly
[02:23:56.280 --> 02:23:59.480]  in different administrations to the american public
[02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:03.640]  particularly now with the president as you said who had the lowest ratings
[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:07.320]  whose historical background is in question i'm not only talking about
[02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:12.280]  his birth certificate forget that his education how he came to power whom he
[02:24:12.280 --> 02:24:16.040]  represents and particularly in the time when wall street
[02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:20.280]  and the bankers have gotten away with the greatest crime in the history of
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:24.520]  america nobody was indicted and particularly at a time when i do not
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:28.280]  understand i who've been in war eight different times
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:33.240]  why we are in afghanistan and iraq and why men and women are dying so the issue
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:36.280]  becomes a little bit greater than the question of
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:40.200]  did the cia or intelligence community doctor
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:44.280]  this situation the answer is yes categorically yes anybody who tells you
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:49.000]  it's not is lying this whole scenario where you see a bunch of people sitting
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.760]  and looking at a screen and they look as if they're intent
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:58.360]  that's nonsense it's a total makeup make-believe we're in an american theater
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:03.160]  of the absurd the real issue is why are we doing this again alex
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:07.480]  why nine years later do i have to come on your show when i predicted
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:11.800]  nine years ago this man was already dead but it wasn't the issue of him
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:14.760]  it was the issue of why does the government
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:19.720]  why does the government repeatedly have to lie to the american people
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:24.920]  who have worked so hard in order to justify their political existence when
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:29.160]  you basically have civilian leaders who are politicians i understand dr
[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:33.240]  pechenek let me let me stop because you're you're dropping bombshell
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:36.120]  after bombshell you know you're the right hand man
[02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:40.200]  of henry kissinger george schultz james beggar cyrus valence
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:43.400]  and anybody's righty and let me tell you i got thrown out of more place than
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:46.840]  you can imagine my friend well my point is you've been you've been right up
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:49.160]  there i've been there you've been right up there right
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:52.040]  underneath these guys and and and it's on record
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:55.720]  that tom clancy's character jack ryan patriot games
[02:25:55.720 --> 02:26:02.040]  is you so you are they send me that's correct yes i mean you're this richard
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:05.240]  absolutely so uh and we'll put an image of uh
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:09.240]  of jack ryan up there so so that's the guy that we're talking to
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:14.040]  right now and so doctor uh you just you know brought out that incredible
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:16.680]  information and we're trying to scramble to find the photo
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:20.120]  it was up on drugs for two days it's gone now but the photo you go to
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:23.160]  whitehouse.gov and find it is is of the president
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:29.240]  you know watches uh with with uh his staff the operation against
[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:32.440]  bin laden and hillary's got her hand over her mouth
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:37.080]  the men are all acting tough you can see that that's a posing photo and you've
[02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:41.080]  been at those levels uh the so so break that down for us
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:44.920]  doctor well the breakdown is very simple this is
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:49.720]  a man who decided he's going to have a photo opportunity this is a man from
[02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:55.480]  the day he came in it began with a lie it began with a lie
[02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:59.000]  i didn't know the man i have nothing personally against him i couldn't care
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.880]  one way or the other but i did care who
[02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:05.800]  what is this man going to be as a president if you're going to say one
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:10.200]  thing and do another in my world in the world of where i can say is a
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:13.160]  political operative that's called a sociopath
[02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:16.280]  that means that you say one thing but you do everything
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:20.920]  differently so when you look at a photograph of people looking intently
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:26.120]  as if they were amazed and confused by an attack that may not have existed if
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:29.160]  this was an attack and they attacked a mortuary
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:34.040]  god bless them because osama bin laden is totally dead so there's no way they
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:37.320]  could have attacked or killed or confronted osama bin laden
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:42.280]  unless you believe in the resurrection of osama bin laden and i don't and if i
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:45.320]  could tell you nine years ago so let me break it through
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:48.920]  you have a president you have a chairman of the joint chiefs of state admiral
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:52.440]  mullen whose father was a publicist at the
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:56.120]  william marce agency who is very much concerned
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:59.880]  about how he's going to leave the military
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:04.120]  as an admiral all right you have a president
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:07.560]  who is in deep deep trouble who has no idea
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:13.320]  of how to get us out of unemployment and has a disparity between the very rich
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:18.600]  and the very poor with no banker in the history of this country at the stealing
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:21.640]  billions of dollars and coming back to the american public
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:25.800]  and asking us for bonuses had never been arrested for this
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:30.120]  yet some people who have cheated on their taxes or poor
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:33.800]  people who have not been able to get jobs are put in prison
[02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:38.040]  or are waiting on welfare so we have a president who to the day he came in
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:41.720]  picked up the Nobel prize for peace where he had done nothing
[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:45.240]  next day turns around and declares war in afghanistan
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:48.120]  even bush june didn't declare war in afghanistan
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:51.480]  and who's in afghanistan right now we're talking about a
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:56.680]  jack a man karzai whom i knew and i was there at the house 20 years ago and
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:29:01.000]  in in in maryland when this delicate tassan owner
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.520]  from silverspring was ordered to come back he was a cia operative as i said as i
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:10.280]  remembered him and was put into position where we have nothing but
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:15.960]  corruption destruction and basically the killing of our own people
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:21.000]  then we have the pakistani allies who they have now irritated this obama
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.920]  and then we have panetta who's not in that picture the most important of those
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:28.920]  men who was ordered this is a great key order obama
[02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:32.360]  wants to tell you how resolute he was because everybody said he was
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:36.600]  indecisive but so in order to make sure he looks resolute
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:40.760]  he orders panetta a nice liberal who had been a republican
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:44.520]  stay there dr pacinic stay there back in three minutes this is
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:48.600]  key info we'll go back to bin laden's death and give us any
[02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:55.000]  more evidence of that we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:59.960]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:07.400]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:32:07.400 --> 02:32:11.160]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:32:11.160 --> 02:32:14.760]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:19.000]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.040]  technology is coming number three in some areas
[02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:24.840]  of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:32:24.840 --> 02:32:28.760]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:32.360]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:35.400]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:33.480]  guys uh he has written 26 plus new york times best sellers
[02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:39.080]  stevepachennick.com it's on record high level
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:43.080]  government position under multiple presidents under secretary of states
[02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:47.240]  involved in black ops uh all over the world uh
[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:50.600]  with the musia hadine i wanted to talk about some of that history briefly
[02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:54.120]  before we look at currently what's happening because obviously to know
[02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:57.000]  what's coming in the future and what's happening in the present we need to know
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:00.120]  the past those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it because the
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:05.240]  cliche rings true but uh remember this is the
[02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:10.440]  character uh that they created uh jack ryan out of and tom clancy's books and
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:14.200]  that's on record that's how respected he is and he has a lot of courage
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:17.240]  and i know you probably don't want to get into this now but you did get a lot of
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:21.800]  heat uh when you came on my show and i know you'll
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:26.680]  probably get heat again right now but uh you're not some small fry out there
[02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:31.320]  saying that bin laden was dead and what you talked about on my show was
[02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:34.520]  confirmed by people in the white house high level
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:39.000]  and then separately years after that madeline albright former secretary of
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.320]  state came out and said it ben is there budo the president of pakistan said it
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:46.840]  so when the washington post and everybody makes fun of us right now
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:51.160]  it has these articles out uh some of them wouldn't even quote you they just
[02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:55.960]  you've said that uh jones claimed uh he had a source from the state department
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:35:02.120]  when it was on record uh the atlantic monthly dare not mention it they linked
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:05.880]  to some chichen chong blog that i have nothing to do with in in some
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:11.160]  attempt to just mislead their readers a jeff goldberg uh who uh when he wasn't
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:16.440]  a israeli prison guard uh he was uh you know running around engaged in his
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:19.800]  regular activities so i guess israel doesn't like what i'm doing i don't know
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:23.800]  why i mean i'm not in their business uh but uh let's go back because this is
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:27.560]  what the media is going to be calling you about and myself about
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:32.200]  let's go back specifically you've got all these intel connections you you
[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:35.960]  you've worked with you know the biggest heavy hitters there are
[02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:40.680]  your famous uh in intelligence and analysis you know the jack ryan's your
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:44.040]  character the guy that doesn't play games and in the real world
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:47.640]  in the real world uh you're actually you're telling it like it is
[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:52.520]  nine years ago uh april 22nd on this show and then everything you've talked
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:56.680]  about has now been backed up in triplicate and now we have this latest
[02:35:56.680 --> 02:36:00.680]  uh pr stunt with them with the photo op with hillary covering her mouth
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:05.160]  i mean this looks like a photo where you tell your kids you know smile say cheese
[02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:10.280]  uh breakdown sir take your time with the intel uh with the ci reports you were
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:13.640]  reading with with as much proof as you can give us without giving up your
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:18.120]  sources of knowing that bin laden was dead uh and when he
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:22.840]  reportedly died so that we can look at the big news story now in context
[02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:26.920]  of why they've launched this this hoax today
[02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:31.640]  well let me just say uh the the issue of why he was
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:35.640]  dead it was exactly what i said before he died of marfan syndrome
[02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:39.240]  post junior knew about it the intelligence community knew about it
[02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:43.800]  cia had already sent a position way before under the clinton administration
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:48.200]  to see him at the american hospital in bubuy he was already very sick from
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:52.360]  marfan syndrome and he was already dying so nobody had to kill him he had
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:56.680]  those waheri who was the physician with them who is still a physician i don't
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:01.000]  know where he is but we knew he was already dead by 9 11
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:05.880]  uh it was very clear that he was dying at toro borough he probably died tomy
[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:09.400]  frank general said uh accidentally that he died but
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:12.920]  point was he was already dead by the time i talked to you why is it
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:17.560]  relevant now again as i said why is the fiction and the narrative of the
[02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:21.720]  scyops of america against the american people so important is number one
[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:25.720]  as you said so clearly to your public and they understand it number one
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:29.560]  we're viewed as idiots and stupid and and americans are not seen as very
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:35.000]  bright by our politicians secondly basically the president wasn't very
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.800]  deep trouble as you said economically
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:41.640]  politically he was on the bottom he had the birther issue come out
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:46.120]  he proved he said he was american but now he had to prove that he was more than
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:49.880]  american he was more american than american he had to be aggressive
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:54.600]  at the same time you had an admiral who had really not done very well as chairman
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:59.320]  of the joint chief of staff would make some mere serious gas by giving a
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:02.520]  medal of honor to greg mortensen who lied
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:06.680]  going into pakistan saying he had built schools for women and looked like a
[02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:09.880]  fool you have panetta who really caused a lot of
[02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:14.040]  civilian damage in the pakistan area and the pakistanis were
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:18.680]  furious with him because what he called came with a cia quite frankly without
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:22.200]  telling you a great secret it's already an open source intelligence
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:26.440]  about 80 percent of the cia presently is not involved in intelligence
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:31.080]  it is involved in what's called operation killing special ops and that means
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:34.840]  that many of the special force of soldiers have been shifted over to the
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:37.880]  cia well used to be in the old office
[02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:42.520]  solex special operations low intensity conflict but they have a new office
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:46.760]  and panetta was really just killing people right and left with the drones
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:51.320]  and creating a lot of lot of friction and a major
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:55.080]  alienation between the american uh the generals
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:39:01.960]  and the pakistani generals the isi third lastly uh we have a foreign policy that
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:06.280]  didn't work under hillary pitton as you know like kandili sirai she probably
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:09.960]  booked in more miles than any other secretary of state and was totally
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:13.800]  incompetent she was not able to preempt to really
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:20.040]  be able to figure out any strategic uh assessments or analysis of what happened
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:24.040]  in the middle east or predict the uprising in syria
[02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:30.520]  uh in olivia tunisia and was really not able to hold out and was not confident
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:33.400]  so you have a whole series administrative people both
[02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:38.440]  civilians and military who are not confident and they had to show
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:43.000]  that they could really prove some sense of competency at a time when there was
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:46.360]  in a reelection it's a really as nature it's a very
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:50.280]  sense of a political experience as to what the washington post says in
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:54.360]  new york times i don't particularly care i never have i never will it's not
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:57.240]  relevant to me i may be relevant to you but i don't
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:00.280]  think it's relevant to the american public they don't read it they don't
[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:03.480]  care about it quite frankly more people listen to alex
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:07.000]  jones than they read the new york times no question in my mind
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:11.720]  having said that it was a very politically expedient
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:15.960]  factor for the president to say i'm going to get reelected i've shown my
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:19.480]  firmness i've shown i'm an american i've shown that i can turn around the
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:22.760]  economy which he hasn't secretary of state
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:28.040]  hillary can say look we accomplished the end of a major significant movement in
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:31.400]  the war on terrorism which they haven't because from a tactical and an
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:35.800]  intelligence assessment point of view this has not changed the game whatsoever
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:40.440]  there are no terrorists really right now in afghanistan the only terrorist right
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:44.520]  now are being supported by haka which is supported by the pakistani
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:47.720]  interservice intelligence with gore said to you last night
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:51.320]  which ironically is being supported by the cia
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:55.400]  and even a hackers have been reporting back to intelligence operatives saying
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:41:00.040]  what god's name is going on we're being paid by our own cia
[02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:03.960]  your cia through the iside to kill your soldiers
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:07.480]  now if you can explain that to me you're going to have to explain that to the
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:11.080]  american public and that's what i meant by deception and denial that's been
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:14.440]  going on for three administrations clinton bush
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:18.840]  and this administration it has stopped what else has been happening
[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:22.680]  the pakistan he says so furious what you heard last night
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:26.920]  that uh... panetta had created all these problems and they don't like general
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:31.000]  patrice by the way i happen to like general patrice i think he's been a
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:34.680]  good general he's been quiet he's been doing what he was
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:39.160]  ordered to do not what he initiated to do and we have to differentiate our
[02:41:39.160 --> 02:41:43.480]  military from civilian control and that's one of the reasons why i work with
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:47.560]  our military and not the civilian government i offer and donate my time
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:51.320]  to our military because they're the most they're the most serious institution
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:55.560]  that we have left in the united states and they're being traded very poorly
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:41:59.400]  both on the battlefield without the necessary resources and when they come
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:03.800]  back as veterans without any benefits and now they have no mental health
[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:08.280]  benefits they have no physical benefits and we're having the cheapest
[02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:12.600]  amount of labor given to these veterans who have served our country honorably
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:15.080]  so what i'm saying to you very clearly is
[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:21.240]  this is a civilian syops game that continues from presidency to presidency
[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:25.400]  we in the united states can no longer to have two party systems where we have a
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:29.480]  republic and a democrat where it really is not functioning
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:33.080]  very well and it's costing the american public a fortune
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:37.160]  in both blood and guts and money was spent over three hundred and thirty three
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:41.640]  billion dollars approximately fifty million dollars for every so-called
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:45.400]  terrorist that was taken out of afghanistan which were about two thousand
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:49.160]  terrorists now if you can find me two thousand more terrorists in pakistan i
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:52.840]  will give you a couple of more million because they don't exist
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:56.280]  karzai the pakistanis have worked together
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:43:00.280]  to make sure that we are not able to acquire any assets there
[02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:03.640]  now what is this result we're not going to go to world war three
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:07.720]  but what's happening is another form of economic warfare has entered
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:12.120]  and that is china who has benefited from all of what we have done
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:16.840]  the dysfunctional behavior and the mis assessment and the lack of strategy and
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:20.360]  the lack of leadership and the disasters that we have
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:25.080]  created with the drones and our cia so-called operations where we kill
[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:28.360]  civilians we've alienated the pakistanis who in turn have
[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:32.200]  invited the chinese to come down and work with them
[02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:37.480]  both militarily and economically and what is carzai said publicly i
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:41.480]  don't want the americans here because he already is raped and ripped us up about
[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:46.520]  three billion dollars a day a week and at the same time he has asked the
[02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:49.800]  chinese to come in and invest in afghanistan
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:53.800]  now that's the reality and by the way karzai's brother on record is the
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:58.040]  biggest opium dealer in afghanistan now
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:01.720]  now looking at this looking at this i talked to you earlier during the break
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:05.240]  and you said you heard general hami ghoul former head of pakistani
[02:44:05.240 --> 02:44:07.880]  intelligence on and that you had to agree with what he said you just alluded
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:11.320]  to that right but specifically let's go
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:15.160]  into your history because you know the entire
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:20.280]  much of the entire leadership of pakistan and afghanistan from the afghan
[02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:25.880]  uh... war with the russian yes i thank you alec it's very kind of you i really
[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:30.200]  know them way before the afghan war i was involved in the the major
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:34.520]  hostage situation in washington called the hanafi muslim i was brought in
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:39.320]  by url silbert when uh... three hundred fifty hostages were taken in in
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:44.040]  washington and and and i was able to thirty six hours of negotiating
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:47.720]  against the orders of carter i actually threw out jimmy carter outside so you
[02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:50.280]  can see i don't always acquiesce to a civilian
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:54.120]  controller president and basically there was a very important
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:58.520]  gentleman who worked with me named yahoo khan yahoo khan was the foreign
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:02.200]  minister of pakistan was our ambassador to the united states
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:07.000]  but was the father of the pakistani army as a result of that
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:10.280]  i got to know the various generals throughout his ranks
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:13.640]  who they were and he talked to me about elizia mushara
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:19.240]  benizia buto her father what would happen so i intimately got to know
[02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:24.040]  both the military elements of this incredible army that was trained under
[02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:27.880]  general yahoo khan and a friend of mine was also the head of the
[02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:31.320]  islamic brotherhood believe it or not we went to MIT together so i
[02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:35.480]  but i knew all of these elements and i knew they were extremely sensitive
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:38.600]  to our relationship with america and at time
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:42.360]  they were useful in the fight against the soviet union
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:46.760]  but at the same time i was clearly warned very early on that they would turn
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:51.880]  against us and basically have a blowback which you've talked about in the past
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:55.720]  so using yahoo khan i knew exactly where
[02:45:55.720 --> 02:46:00.200]  the elements were the concerns they had about the cia continuously supporting
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:04.040]  the inner service intelligence agency the fact that the isi
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:07.160]  was getting out of control was no longer under
[02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:12.920]  military or civilian control in pakistan and was beginning to form their own
[02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:17.320]  so-called groups that we call terrorist groups as a forefront
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:23.960]  to making sure that pakistan had a ancillary army or basically an
[02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:28.360]  auxiliary army or paramilitary unit that could fight against india
[02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:31.960]  and one of the things your audience has to understand pakistan's greatest
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:35.560]  obsession right now is not with the taliban or haka
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:40.120]  those are the groups that they support even till today it's with india work
[02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:44.920]  i'm saying whether india that is correct alex india is the greatest obsession
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:49.240]  and i would speak to the the general and other pakistani officials and explain
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:52.680]  to them look india is not an issue for you india is
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:56.440]  twice the size you are they have twice the number of nuclear warheads you have
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:47:00.120]  600 000 soldiers at that time they had 2.2 million
[02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:04.040]  cashmere is not an issue nevertheless india
[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:08.760]  pakistan to this day has felt very strongly that india sending down
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:12.040]  operatives through the chinese and others soviet into
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:15.800]  gandhistan and are using those operatives in order to get a
[02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:20.200]  possession into gandhistan at the same time pakistan feels that india is
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:23.640]  infiltrating a cashmere so there's a whole other scenario
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:28.280]  which we have not been able to handle when richard holberg was brought in
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:33.640]  as the envoy to the south asia he was told you can handle anything you want
[02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:37.320]  but you will not touch pakistan and india or cashmere
[02:47:37.320 --> 02:47:41.960]  that was cut out so from a foreign policy point of view we have never had the
[02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:46.040]  strong hand or the foresight of let's say whatever you think of
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:50.760]  kissinger or baker who could very forcefully say no that's not
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:54.440]  going to happen or we had the strategic sense under various other
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:58.280]  presidents where we knew exactly where we wanted to go like bush senior said
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:02.520]  we're not going into iraq it wasn't a question he was afraid of sat down who
[02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:06.680]  sanary wasn't or was unfinished work bush senior was brilliant in foreign
[02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:10.760]  policy we had taken down the soviet union quietly we had taken down east
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:14.040]  germany quietly we had taken down a part five quietly
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:18.360]  and we had taken down debutsan a whole bunch of other countries not one
[02:48:18.360 --> 02:48:22.920]  word was said when his son came in he said i don't listen to my father we said
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:26.520]  good god what a incredibly incompetent
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:29.960]  arrogant individual yet his father never said a word
[02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:33.240]  so when you have a man like bush senior who's able to put
[02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:37.480]  control and direct both the intelligent community is here
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:41.240]  under whom a gays bob gateswood is an excellent
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:44.840]  secretary of defense and i'm sorry to see him go because i think that's a great
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:48.840]  loss to our country he has really tried to control and direct
[02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:53.240]  us our defense department in the right way and cut back programs that were not
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:57.400]  necessary the f-22 the stealth and really provide
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:00.840]  our special forces with the necessary equipment they needed
[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:05.400]  we're going to lose a very valuable man in turn i have very big questions about
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:09.960]  penetta and his capabilities i do not think he performed well at the cia
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:14.760]  i think he exacerbated a very serious situation with the pakistanis
[02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:18.040]  and i think general patrice will have a hard time because
[02:49:18.040 --> 02:49:21.880]  it's a military man coming into a civilian organization which general
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:25.720]  eisenhower once said about the cia you need a certain
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:29.800]  kind of genius to run that organization so right now
[02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:33.560]  what's happening is civilian control which is both untutored
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:38.760]  undisciplined and without a history of any military intelligence expertise
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:43.240]  is now going forward there's one more reason why osama ben laden
[02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:47.480]  came out out of the debt so to speak the resurrection for the cyops
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:51.400]  resurrection of some of them and that is for the first time you've heard
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:55.640]  people like clapper and the director of the national intelligence organizations
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:50:00.120]  in the uh... the i say that the center for counterterrorism and all the
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:04.600]  intelligence organizations which amount to god knows how many now
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:08.920]  have really worked together and effectively so if the justification
[02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:14.040]  to say that under osama obama we have really integrated our intelligence
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:17.000]  communities so that we effectively can kill
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:20.120]  and they were able to kill a dead man in my opinion
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:23.800]  that osama ben laden was dead all right let me ask you this question
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:26.920]  uh... sir and again if you just joined us uh... dr steve pechenick steve

[02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:31.400]  and that's what bin laden is
[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:35.320]  he knows your anger he knows your pain he's that six foot four boogie man with
[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:39.560]  a scary turban and the beard and the evil eye

[02:54:43.640 --> 02:54:47.400]  yeah as the gas prices explode as all of this
[02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:53.080]  tyranny unfolds as i mean the chinese are dumping more treasuries
[02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:57.000]  they're talking about the u.s losing a triple a rating that's back in the news
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.800]  today they say when they switch it it may go
[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:06.920]  to a c grade that's cnbc i mean this is the country going into cardiac arrest
[02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:11.400]  but we've got the royal wedding we've got the bin laden situation and here is
[02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:15.240]  a very high-powered author researcher state department of
[02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:19.880]  former official cfr a fellow breaking everything down
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:22.920]  breaking ranks with the establishment to warn you
[02:55:22.920 --> 02:55:27.800]  now now larger than just obama sir uh and the reelection i mean that's all
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:31.320]  scripted that's clear why else are they doing this
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:34.520]  because i mean we see the frame up now of pakistan
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:38.840]  going into high gear saying bin laden was at this house
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:43.160]  well one of the reasons they're doing it so that they basically can pull out of
[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:47.960]  pakistan they can leave try to leave afghanistan and iraq with the sense that
[02:55:47.960 --> 02:55:51.800]  there was a victory there is no victory because there was no clear
[02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:55.160]  designation as to what the war were accomplished we have no idea what the
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:59.880]  war accomplished other than ten years of wasted bodies and brave men and
[02:55:59.880 --> 02:56:03.240]  women and and three hundred thirty three billion a year
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:08.760]  secondly we now uh uh have a very serious economic issue with unemployment
[02:56:08.760 --> 02:56:11.960]  still up exceedingly high much higher than the
[02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:16.040]  designations we have a banking crisis that hasn't been resolved
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:19.640]  in three years we've had banks after banks chased
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:25.080]  morgan stanley jp morgan and chase uh bank of america all of them have
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:28.600]  committed crimes beyond the reason of the doubt if you look at the banking
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:31.560]  commission report that's done by our own federal government
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:36.600]  they indict them and there's basically no attention to them and nobody has
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:39.640]  even been prosecuted and obama went back to them
[02:56:39.640 --> 02:56:42.840]  yesterday and asked them for more money they're going to raise the billion
[02:56:42.840 --> 02:56:46.520]  we're also in a position where we are not doing very well
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:50.520]  in the international arena we have literally lost our basic strategic
[02:56:50.520 --> 02:56:54.120]  superpower position although we have a large army we're basically in the same
[02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:58.120]  position that the british military was in the nineteen hundredth a very
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:01.720]  large army without a strategy without a cause
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:06.040]  and without a country i often said to our military we have an army without a
[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:09.960]  country and i say to our country that we have a country without a military
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:14.360]  because right now it's costing us a fortune we have no benefits derived
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:18.280]  from it there are no enemies that we have other than the internal security of
[02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:22.840]  our country which depends really on the debt as you clearly said
[02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:26.440]  and our financial growth which is very low two to three percent
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:30.600]  and the fact that our bond ratings will be downgraded perhaps to a c or whatever
[02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:33.800]  the levels are we have further problems we have
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:38.280]  the notion that a system is not working and that's what i keep coming back to
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:42.920]  it since i said 10 years ago when we had bush jr now we have obama we elect
[02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:46.840]  people who are basically panderas without any history
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:51.240]  of accomplishment without any history of success other than the fact that they
[02:57:51.240 --> 02:57:55.560]  pandered their way and agreed to acquiesce to
[02:57:55.560 --> 02:58:00.280]  anybody who's giving them money or power and represent other interests now i'm
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:03.560]  not degrading anyone i've treated politicians and i've
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:06.840]  worked with it but basically the notion of a politician
[02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:11.160]  servicing the united states of american needs is absurd
[02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:15.320]  we don't need these people anymore and if we don't if we think we do then we're
[02:58:15.320 --> 02:58:18.840]  mistaken because we're going to keep going on from administration to
[02:58:18.840 --> 02:58:23.080]  administration from lie to lie and from incompetence to
[02:58:23.080 --> 02:58:26.200]  incompetence all of these people are reshuffled again you have
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:29.240]  panetta who was in the clinton administration was not a great
[02:58:29.240 --> 02:58:31.960]  performer now coming in from the cia where he was
[02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:34.520]  dysfunctional they're now heading up the secretary

[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  is some type of you know way to put pressure on pakistan's nuclear program
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:02.600]  uh but but what are the other reasons for them doing this because i'm scanning
[03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:07.800]  the news uh here while we're live and 48 hours into this it's
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:12.920]  completely turning around against them and hoax hoax hoax hoax hoax
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:17.320]  is the byword they're on facebook everywhere trying to block and ban
[03:01:17.320 --> 03:01:21.080]  people like i've never seen on their own facebook saying it's a hoax
[03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:24.200]  it looks like a route is beginning and folks i don't just say things like a
[03:01:24.200 --> 03:01:27.640]  cheerleader i'm telling you now this this looks like a route
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:30.840]  of this hoax that's why they're now saying they're going to try to release a
[03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:35.000]  real photo dr pacinic well i think you i i think you're
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:39.320]  absolutely right alex one of the things that we i think the politicians never
[03:01:39.320 --> 03:01:42.440]  calculated on is that the american public is a lot smarter than the
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:47.320]  politicians let me repeat that again i think we the american people are a lot
[03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:51.080]  smarter we could smell a scyops operation we could smell the fake
[03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:55.080]  we could smell when it's orchestrated and this is orchestrated i mean when you
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:57.960]  have people uh sitting around and watching a
[03:01:57.960 --> 03:02:01.400]  a sitcom basically the operation center in the white house
[03:02:01.400 --> 03:02:05.240]  and you have a president coming out on the zombie like telling you that they
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:08.920]  just killed Osama bin Laden who was already dead nine years ago
[03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:12.840]  and people are aware of shows like yours quite frankly alex you've been a very
[03:02:12.840 --> 03:02:17.240]  important part of inserting the truth in a time when
[03:02:17.240 --> 03:02:21.160]  most media was really going to the common denominator and the lowest
[03:02:21.160 --> 03:02:25.400]  the fortunate part is that thank god for the alternative media and thank god for
[03:02:25.400 --> 03:02:28.760]  the american public they're a lot smarter and the world public's a lot
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:32.120]  smarter i understand that you're listened to in the middle east by millions
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:36.440]  of people you've offered them a lot of facts it's nothing that you really said
[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:40.440]  that i didn't agree with nine years ago and when i said to you Osama bin Laden
[03:02:40.440 --> 03:02:44.200]  dead because they need to get out of there they need to have a
[03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:48.360]  conclusion where the president's getting really all the issues we talked about
[03:02:48.360 --> 03:02:52.520]  now the american public is saying you know we're tired we're sick and tired
[03:02:52.520 --> 03:02:56.120]  of the nonsense that was given to us by clinton by bush
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:03:00.760]  and certainly now by obama we want jobs we want to manufacture we don't want to
[03:03:00.760 --> 03:03:03.960]  be overseas we want to develop our own country
[03:03:03.960 --> 03:03:06.680]  we want to know that we can be proud of what we've done
[03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:10.360]  and forget the rest of the world where we're making up wars that don't exist
[03:03:10.360 --> 03:03:14.840]  and terrorists who never were and the psa as you said was reaching down to your
[03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:18.440]  pants and are not really required i've never seen anything like this in my
[03:03:18.440 --> 03:03:22.120]  whole life so the answer is one issue that's very
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:25.480]  important is that the american public has to understand these people are not
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:28.200]  smarter than the american public they just not
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:31.400]  they may believe they're smart if you look at the background of osama bin
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:33.800]  laden he did not do very well in school
[03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:37.480]  he was at two-year college which was not very good how he didn't do that well
[03:03:37.480 --> 03:03:41.640]  in columbia and i think he got into arbor on affirmative action
[03:03:41.640 --> 03:03:45.720]  but the real issue is and his own wife was in on affirmative action i think
[03:03:45.720 --> 03:03:48.680]  the real issue is that we have the same benefits
[03:03:48.680 --> 03:03:52.600]  that he had i think we would have achieved so-called elite status but the
[03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:56.760]  bottom line is very simple the american public is a lot smarter
[03:03:56.760 --> 03:04:00.680]  anybody who has to work on a day-to-day basis whether i'm in montana or on the
[03:04:00.680 --> 03:04:03.880]  east coast you've got a farm you've got a build you
[03:04:03.880 --> 03:04:07.640]  have a you have a uh a mechanic shop you're a trucker
[03:04:07.640 --> 03:04:11.240]  you've got to figure out exactly what the cost of goods are what the profit
[03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:15.480]  margins are and how you can pay your income these guys
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:19.000]  in congress and the senate have never had to do that
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:22.920]  if you look at the benefits of what they have and you look at the white house
[03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:26.840]  benefits of what they have we basically have a royalty
[03:04:26.840 --> 03:04:32.360]  and a kingship we didn't have a wedding in england what we had was a marriage of
[03:04:32.360 --> 03:04:36.600]  the absurd and the scythe here in america when ben laden was just
[03:04:36.600 --> 03:04:40.360]  resurrected and in in this greatest
[03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:44.200]  false false what i've ever heard i mean he was absurd

[03:09:58.440 --> 03:10:01.160]  we're seeing it and then before we go to some calls i want you to
[03:10:01.160 --> 03:10:04.600]  specifically uh again because you keep saying well you know
[03:10:04.600 --> 03:10:08.440]  they're not as smart as you think they are why they're doing it why they think
[03:10:08.440 --> 03:10:13.240]  they came out with this ridiculous bin laden uh announcement that's so
[03:10:13.240 --> 03:10:17.400]  cartoonish that is blowing up in their face the foreign media the domestic
[03:10:17.400 --> 03:10:21.000]  it is just overwhelming the inconsistencies even the
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:24.600]  washington post and others are like well they're conspiracy theorists but it is
[03:10:24.600 --> 03:10:29.080]  weird that uh they threw him in the ocean it is weird there were fake photos
[03:10:29.080 --> 03:10:32.120]  it is weird they claim that killed he made other times i was talking to the
[03:10:32.120 --> 03:10:36.040]  washington post lady uh and she was like everybody in the office
[03:10:36.040 --> 03:10:39.320]  doesn't believe that she was giggling and i said do you understand this isn't
[03:10:39.320 --> 03:10:43.320]  funny they i mean you know they lied about wmd's they lied about it all
[03:10:43.320 --> 03:10:48.280]  uh and uh we're in a very serious time but but tell folks a little bit about
[03:10:48.280 --> 03:10:53.960]  yourself i mean give us a snapshot of your career very quickly i i i went to
[03:10:53.960 --> 03:10:57.320]  harvard and mic at the same time not because i was so smart but because
[03:10:57.320 --> 03:11:01.000]  harvard wasn't as good as i thought i was i got a psyche to create harvard and a
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:05.160]  phd international train international affairs
[03:11:05.160 --> 03:11:09.240]  under lusion pie i i was trained in psychological warfare propaganda
[03:11:09.240 --> 03:11:13.480]  counterintelligence counterterrorism i went right into the state department
[03:11:13.480 --> 03:11:18.280]  working for laurence eagelberger and uh what became the head of the
[03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:21.240]  office of combat terrorism i created that i worked against
[03:11:21.240 --> 03:11:25.320]  power pot as a terrorist and then years later i worked with power pot as a
[03:11:25.320 --> 03:11:28.600]  statement so one of the things you have to remember in the world of terrorism
[03:11:28.600 --> 03:11:31.800]  that today's terrorist is tomorrow's statement that was true but not from
[03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:35.240]  beggin that was true of many of the terrorists that we worked with and now
[03:11:35.240 --> 03:11:38.120]  became statesman it was true of our own founding fathers
[03:11:38.120 --> 03:11:41.720]  who were created as terrorists and after my statement i then went on
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:45.480]  to remain in the carter administration where i was involved in the regime change
[03:11:45.480 --> 03:11:48.840]  about tomorrow i neutralized red brigade the
[03:11:48.840 --> 03:11:54.280]  p2 scandal i i died at furlough stony then i'm sorry ever came back i left
[03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:59.880]  under carter i resigned refused to go to iran because i had ramsey carter and i
[03:11:59.880 --> 03:12:04.920]  thought it would be a disaster i went on then to create businesses my real
[03:12:04.920 --> 03:12:09.400]  love and this country's great love why i feel i'm a very strong american is that
[03:12:09.400 --> 03:12:14.120]  i have an entrepreneur i am what we call an angel investor i use my own money to
[03:12:14.120 --> 03:12:16.920]  create businesses and start them up and build them
[03:12:16.920 --> 03:12:20.520]  not because it's the money i'm more than happy to lose the money because
[03:12:20.520 --> 03:12:24.920]  only in america can i do what i've done all the time which is be able to create
[03:12:24.920 --> 03:12:28.360]  a business like radio frequency identification the tom clancy
[03:12:28.360 --> 03:12:32.520]  franchises the tv shows even radio shows and now
[03:12:32.520 --> 03:12:36.120]  i'm doing nutraceuticals and i'm doing orphan drugs
[03:12:36.120 --> 03:12:41.320]  and be able to succeed or fail not by definition of money but by definition of
[03:12:41.320 --> 03:12:45.800]  criteria that we built asset i was not interested in pushing papers
[03:12:45.800 --> 03:12:49.800]  or money back and forth but i was interested in serving my country which i
[03:12:49.800 --> 03:12:52.120]  really serve for free and now most of the time
[03:12:52.120 --> 03:12:56.360]  i was promoted to colonel at a very early age of 32 i refused promotion to
[03:12:56.360 --> 03:13:00.680]  general brigadier general at 37 because i felt not that i wanted to be in the
[03:13:00.680 --> 03:13:03.160]  army but i felt i could serve my country best
[03:13:03.160 --> 03:13:07.560]  by going back out into public service and into private service and then offer my
[03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:11.960]  services for free make my money outside on my own and then come
[03:13:11.960 --> 03:13:14.920]  back and serve my country through the military and other
[03:13:14.920 --> 03:13:18.440]  organization and be able to go overseas for our
[03:13:18.440 --> 03:13:21.880]  country and offer strategic advice if they listen to it if not
[03:13:21.880 --> 03:13:26.040]  i came back under reagan and worked on the soviet union i was out to the ram
[03:13:26.040 --> 03:13:30.120]  corporation for a year under a man called Richard Solomon who
[03:13:30.120 --> 03:13:34.040]  brought me in to say develop the soviet uh takedown
[03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:38.120]  the psychological operation we were involved bush senior was really
[03:13:38.120 --> 03:13:42.040]  under reagan but they're really impetus for the takedown of soviet union east
[03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:45.320]  germany i then came back under bush senior and i was
[03:13:45.320 --> 03:13:50.440]  involved in the uh bringing the peace treaty under james baker uh to
[03:13:50.440 --> 03:13:54.840]  uh bring a regime change under pope plot without using any wars without using
[03:13:54.840 --> 03:13:58.840]  any soldiers my point is most of the things that i've done and i've done
[03:13:58.840 --> 03:14:02.520]  a lot in the middle east against habash for watme
[03:14:02.520 --> 03:14:06.600]  uh even in the gaza strip where i work
[03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:10.200]  uh with the plo against the plo and where
[03:14:10.200 --> 03:14:14.520]  ironically and this will be a soft spot for the israelis in 88 i was sent out
[03:14:14.520 --> 03:14:19.240]  by schultz uh to find out what was going on with the plo and i found out
[03:14:19.240 --> 03:14:23.960]  that the shin bet of israel in 88 was creating a group called hamas which was
[03:14:23.960 --> 03:14:27.000]  used as a counter force to the plo and of course
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:31.160]  eventually everybody learned that hamas had a blowback and now the israelis
[03:14:31.160 --> 03:14:34.200]  have created their own frankenstein the point being that
[03:14:34.200 --> 03:14:37.640]  we are not the only country in the world to create our own frankenstein's
[03:14:37.640 --> 03:14:40.920]  through al-qaeda which was really the mushaq adin before
[03:14:40.920 --> 03:14:44.280]  i was involved with that under the card administration subsequently another
[03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:47.640]  administration but so was israel involved in creating did you ever
[03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:49.640]  interrupt doctor did you ever meet with some of them
[03:14:49.640 --> 03:14:53.480]  london yes i saw him in afghanistan very
[03:14:53.480 --> 03:14:57.080]  briefly but i was more involved with other operational concerns particularly
[03:14:57.080 --> 03:15:02.120]  the afghan uh the pakistanis what was his role in the war against the russians
[03:15:02.120 --> 03:15:06.920]  uh and and and what was he like uh when you did me i didn't know him very well
[03:15:06.920 --> 03:15:10.520]  basically i knew he was sick at the time i knew he had renal disease
[03:15:10.520 --> 03:15:14.200]  and i knew he had marfan said you could see that but basically the guys who were
[03:15:14.200 --> 03:15:18.840]  cia operas said he had a supportive role there and he was
[03:15:18.840 --> 03:15:23.080]  financing most of the elements there my interest was really more strategic
[03:15:23.080 --> 03:15:27.400]  yeah he was more of the saudi arabians uh a man in the field with the money
[03:15:27.400 --> 03:15:30.600]  delivery correct that was that was the understanding
[03:15:30.600 --> 03:15:35.000]  that's exactly correct uh he was not i i from my point of view he was not the
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:38.360]  keystone of the operation did that really was
[03:15:38.360 --> 03:15:43.400]  uh a cia operation most people think i work with the cia i was not in the cia
[03:15:43.400 --> 03:15:47.080]  but that's not it you're there even though i was a member of the cf farm also
[03:15:47.080 --> 03:15:50.840]  a member of the association of foreign intelligence officer and national
[03:15:50.840 --> 03:15:55.000]  military intelligence association so all these associations may mean
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:57.800]  something to you may not but i'm primarily an american
[03:15:57.800 --> 03:16:00.840]  no i understand and it must be horrifying for you
[03:16:00.840 --> 03:16:05.960]  doctor to know that uh like the royal wedding worshiping people that you know
[03:16:05.960 --> 03:16:09.720]  who are relatively got their power who you have to get a you know imperial
[03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:12.040]  mark in the past be able to even have a business
[03:16:12.040 --> 03:16:15.560]  our forefathers and and mothers came here to be able to build their own
[03:16:15.560 --> 03:16:19.880]  businesses follow their own dreams and now we see obama
[03:16:19.880 --> 03:16:23.720]  giving thousands of waivers to select corporations that give him money
[03:16:23.720 --> 03:16:27.400]  general electric heads up as economic board they get waivers for their coal
[03:16:27.400 --> 03:16:30.360]  plants and then shut down their competition we're
[03:16:30.360 --> 03:16:33.480]  really entering this crony monopoly system that's
[03:16:33.480 --> 03:16:37.160]  going to be horrifying for you well it's more than horrifying it's called
[03:16:37.160 --> 03:16:40.040]  crony capitalism and the banking episode was really
[03:16:40.040 --> 03:16:43.000]  beyond the pale for me i was totally shocked
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:46.840]  disgusted and i was waiting for people to get indicted i still hope people will
[03:16:46.840 --> 03:16:50.120]  be indicted crony capitalism cannot work whether it's with
[03:16:50.120 --> 03:16:53.400]  republicans democrats or independents it could not work
[03:16:53.400 --> 03:16:58.200]  we have to stop it as americans this case must stop at this administration
[03:16:58.200 --> 03:17:02.680]  and any future administrations please do not believe any politicians to come to
[03:17:02.680 --> 03:17:05.880]  you and tell you they believe in something where the republicans or
[03:17:05.880 --> 03:17:10.200]  democrats they're all full of bs because all they care about is their own
[03:17:10.200 --> 03:17:13.800]  narcissism their own desire for power very few people
[03:17:13.800 --> 03:17:17.080]  are really interested in serving the government and then they would leave
[03:17:17.080 --> 03:17:20.600]  without pay i really have never found any of these people except
[03:17:20.600 --> 03:17:25.400]  in my case i found bush senior i found baker who really didn't need money even
[03:17:25.400 --> 03:17:30.200]  dance on both sides but most people that i knew were very power hungry in this
[03:17:30.200 --> 03:17:33.240]  administration you have a president totally
[03:17:33.240 --> 03:17:37.640]  totally incapable of telling the truth what about those narcissistic photos
[03:17:37.640 --> 03:17:41.400]  with them all posing i mean you can see they did over and over again till they
[03:17:41.400 --> 03:17:46.200]  got it but shifting gears back uh to this key issue
[03:17:46.200 --> 03:17:51.000]  there you are this hot guy high level in these republican administrations
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:54.600]  the son of someone you say you admire and who from your perspective is a good
[03:17:54.600 --> 03:17:57.240]  guy obviously hardworking and intelligent
[03:17:57.240 --> 03:18:01.080]  george herbert walker bush anyway you slice it when he didn't become a cia
[03:18:01.080 --> 03:18:05.720]  director you know how to hold cloth folks if you know why he became cia
[03:18:05.720 --> 03:18:09.640]  director even jet bush didn't know that he became cia director because donal
[03:18:09.640 --> 03:18:14.120]  rumsfeld wanted to neutralize them from running for the president for 20 years
[03:18:14.120 --> 03:18:18.040]  most people don't realize either cheney or rumsfeld were allowed in the white
[03:18:18.040 --> 03:18:21.560]  house because they tried to neutralize the
[03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:26.760]  the future of this quiet man who never never promoted itself
[03:18:26.760 --> 03:18:30.440]  i remember his saying to me and others that i never speak about myself because
[03:18:30.440 --> 03:18:34.600]  my mother wouldn't let me do you believe that well you know it's it's
[03:18:34.600 --> 03:18:37.720]  i mean it's interesting that you bring that up because it's actually come out
[03:18:37.720 --> 03:18:42.680]  that george w did bring in cheney and rumsfeld because
[03:18:42.680 --> 03:18:47.800]  of that split and and that that's then later when baker
[03:18:47.800 --> 03:18:51.000]  and then we're sent back in to kind of shut down what they were doing
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:54.600]  that would right that would go one of the reasons why i got on the phone in the
[03:18:54.600 --> 03:18:58.280]  middle when i was in montan and i told baker i called him up i said what god's
[03:18:58.280 --> 03:19:01.400]  name are you doing sending out the chairman of the republican party who
[03:19:01.400 --> 03:19:05.240]  was whatever a very bizarre and unusual in his
[03:19:05.240 --> 03:19:09.400]  orientations and talking about abortion and i said get rid of these guys and
[03:19:09.400 --> 03:19:13.400]  what are you doing with cheney rumsfeld i mean these guys were persona non grata
[03:19:13.400 --> 03:19:17.960]  for 20 years in our administration so basically you have to understand within
[03:19:17.960 --> 03:19:21.480]  the american part within the american public has to understand that even on the
[03:19:21.480 --> 03:19:25.240]  bush junior we had basically a quiet civil war
[03:19:25.240 --> 03:19:29.080]  that was going on between his father's people who are non ideological
[03:19:29.080 --> 03:19:33.080]  and those who try to implement ideology and their own narcissism what we have
[03:19:33.080 --> 03:19:37.800]  now is a very narcissistic incompetent president with a very dysfunctional
[03:19:37.800 --> 03:19:41.240]  white house and a dysfunctional intelligence community well that was my

[03:24:20.360 --> 03:24:23.960]  just an average guy who started reading history books when i was 12 and thought
[03:24:23.960 --> 03:24:28.440]  they were interesting and entertaining and reading history i learned so much
[03:24:28.440 --> 03:24:32.520]  about how the world works today and then i talked to the general public
[03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:36.360]  who many of them are informed and have street smarts but if they would really
[03:24:36.360 --> 03:24:39.960]  start researching they would find out how much they're being lied to and that
[03:24:39.960 --> 03:24:43.000]  the culture is getting more and more entitled in washington
[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:46.200]  the corporations that have grown up around it the crony system are so out of
[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:49.400]  control your phone calls for dr steve pacenic

[03:24:52.600 --> 03:24:56.200]  in the very near future and i keep asking him this question he's answered it
[03:24:56.200 --> 03:24:59.800]  in many ways but but but just boiling it down
[03:24:59.800 --> 03:25:03.160]  in a language that the mainstream media can understand and government can
[03:25:03.160 --> 03:25:08.840]  understand why would they do something that is so
[03:25:08.840 --> 03:25:14.920]  cartoonishly satirical where and i'm not just saying this can make it come
[03:25:14.920 --> 03:25:17.880]  true because i was pretty depressed yesterday but
[03:25:17.880 --> 03:25:22.360]  now the tables are turning it is exploding in their face
[03:25:22.360 --> 03:25:26.200]  i mean it's almost more scary doctor that you're probably right
[03:25:26.200 --> 03:25:29.640]  that they have the power they have the control so they're able to do what they
[03:25:29.640 --> 03:25:33.080]  want they think they're smart but the end of the day
[03:25:33.080 --> 03:25:36.440]  they're making a lot of things that look like big mistakes
[03:25:36.440 --> 03:25:41.640]  as the republic slides towards collapse so so so why
[03:25:41.640 --> 03:25:44.440]  i'm during the break i said so you're saying they just did this to make obama
[03:25:44.440 --> 03:25:48.040]  look good you said no to make him survive
[03:25:48.040 --> 03:25:52.920]  it's about the word that you want to use right now the key word that it did all
[03:25:52.920 --> 03:25:58.120]  of this syops resurrection of osama ben lon which is a joke and a
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:26:02.760]  sick joke and a cynical joke on the american public treating them as if we
[03:26:02.760 --> 03:26:07.080]  were stupid is desperation they are so desperate
[03:26:07.080 --> 03:26:13.320]  to make obama viable to negate the fact that he may not have been born here
[03:26:13.320 --> 03:26:17.480]  any questions about his backgrounds any irregularities about his background to
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:21.080]  make him look assertive to make sure that gates goes out
[03:26:21.080 --> 03:26:25.320]  in a clean sweep and that he's done what he's good this is a good man gates and
[03:26:25.320 --> 03:26:28.840]  bringing in a man who was questionably qualified to be secretary
[03:26:28.840 --> 03:26:31.640]  defense who was questionably qualified to be cia
[03:26:31.640 --> 03:26:36.760]  director panetta to bring in a whole other staff that really has not been
[03:26:36.760 --> 03:26:41.560]  very effective and to reelect this president against the american public
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:45.720]  can be do once again after we've been do by bush jr
[03:26:45.720 --> 03:26:50.840]  and clinton the point is they've under over underestimated the american public
[03:26:50.840 --> 03:26:54.280]  again you can think able to axle rod at the white house
[03:26:54.280 --> 03:27:00.760]  is very self-aggrandizing a very pretentious man who thinks he understands
[03:27:00.760 --> 03:27:05.400]  the american public as he pulls them every minute and basically what we have
[03:27:05.400 --> 03:27:09.640]  here is a desperate situation on behalf of an incompetent
[03:27:09.640 --> 03:27:14.120]  president who's not told the truth who hopes to be reelected because he has
[03:27:14.120 --> 03:27:18.040]  nothing to offer but words which are totally meaningless
[03:27:18.040 --> 03:27:21.880]  and will hopefully get forth on the other hand let me warn you that the
[03:27:21.880 --> 03:27:27.160]  republicans and other parties have no candidates that are capable of filling
[03:27:27.160 --> 03:27:31.480]  the role that american needs today which is a pragmatic
[03:27:31.480 --> 03:27:37.480]  non-narcissistic non-egoistic practical man or woman who has served our
[03:27:37.480 --> 03:27:40.760]  country on behalf of our country hopefully in the
[03:27:40.760 --> 03:27:44.200]  military hopefully in business and hopefully
[03:27:44.200 --> 03:27:48.280]  has had a clean history and can understand where we're going strategically
[03:27:48.280 --> 03:27:52.680]  and tactically that has not happened in the past 24 years
[03:27:52.680 --> 03:27:57.880]  that's basically where we are today in desperation with capital pronyism
[03:27:57.880 --> 03:28:03.400]  corruption and non-transparency what we need now is to re-square
[03:28:03.400 --> 03:28:07.480]  in washington dc and all over the country where people are going to talk about
[03:28:07.480 --> 03:28:09.880]  that when we come back and then take calls but in the minute or two we have
[03:28:09.880 --> 03:28:13.400]  left in this short segment why did you go public
[03:28:13.400 --> 03:28:17.320]  in 2002 with something at the time you know that
[03:28:17.320 --> 03:28:20.280]  sounded a little bit wild to some people but i i knew it had a historical
[03:28:20.280 --> 03:28:24.280]  basis and say everybody who has accused me of making
[03:28:24.280 --> 03:28:27.160]  wild statements regretted it ten years later
[03:28:27.160 --> 03:28:30.760]  Aldo Morrow did, Pol Pot did, Noriega all
[03:28:30.760 --> 03:28:34.680]  presented, regretted the fact when i said to them you're leaving
[03:28:34.680 --> 03:28:39.560]  and you're not staying they were gone the reason i came forth and i said i
[03:28:39.560 --> 03:28:42.440]  warned bush jr and chainie and ronestell
[03:28:42.440 --> 03:28:46.360]  you will pay for the crimes you've committed against the american public
[03:28:46.360 --> 03:28:50.680]  and part of that is this nonsense of Osama bin Laden being the leader
[03:28:50.680 --> 03:28:55.320]  of some nonsensical group that we created under the card administration
[03:28:55.320 --> 03:29:00.440]  was fostered through tens of years and going into Pakistan
[03:29:00.440 --> 03:29:03.720]  through the nonsensical war that didn't exist
[03:29:03.720 --> 03:29:08.280]  to allow men and women to die are you bottom line saying they ran the attacks
[03:29:08.280 --> 03:29:12.840]  or they hired some criminal group to do it no no no they ran the attacks that
[03:29:12.840 --> 03:29:18.440]  9-11 is a total manufacturer of one organization the white house
[03:29:18.440 --> 03:29:22.760]  under bush jr bush jr chainie ronestell
[03:29:22.760 --> 03:29:26.680]  unbelievable what stay there sir stay there
[03:29:26.680 --> 03:29:32.040]  alien avers is now to see it far stay there repeat that happy to confront
[03:29:32.040 --> 03:29:34.840]  stay stay there let's come back and repeat that because the music was playing
[03:29:34.840 --> 03:29:39.640]  this is absolutely devastating uh dr steve paceniks got
[03:29:39.640 --> 03:29:43.400]  major credibility and he is going all the way today
[03:29:43.400 --> 03:29:48.520]  putting it on the table this is off the charts we'll be right back stay with us

[03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:17.960]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[03:30:17.960 --> 03:30:20.520]  happen again so our friends at solutions from

[03:34:51.880 --> 03:34:56.280]  the event of 9-11 was carried out for one purpose it was carried out to
[03:34:56.280 --> 03:34:59.800]  mobilize the american public to go to a war that they didn't
[03:34:59.800 --> 03:35:03.480]  need to go to that they knew nothing about where we had pre-positioned
[03:35:03.480 --> 03:35:08.280]  soldiers in afghanistan and iraq six to nine months beforehand
[03:35:08.280 --> 03:35:12.360]  and what it was done it was based on paul wolff who it is richard
[03:35:12.360 --> 03:35:16.440]  uh... cainy uh... dick saw a dick cainy
[03:35:16.440 --> 03:35:20.840]  uh bush jr steve hadley elliott abrams in the white house
[03:35:20.840 --> 03:35:25.720]  tell me how is that dennis ross who's now our still on boy who's never been held a
[03:35:25.720 --> 03:35:30.200]  cannibal you have uh... condoleezza rice
[03:35:30.200 --> 03:35:34.120]  you have all the people who were in the white in the uh... military
[03:35:34.120 --> 03:35:37.800]  uh... particularly the air force generals who were involved they can deny it
[03:35:37.800 --> 03:35:41.720]  any much they want but i have a whole list of names they know who they are
[03:35:41.720 --> 03:35:46.200]  and the intel the cia operatives who worked under solik special operations
[03:35:46.200 --> 03:35:48.920]  low intensity conflict were all involved
[03:35:48.920 --> 03:35:53.720]  it was called a stand down a false flag operation in order to mobilize the
[03:35:53.720 --> 03:35:58.440]  american public on the false pretense that we were attacked by al-qaeda and
[03:35:58.440 --> 03:36:02.600]  osama ben laden which was an absolute unmitigated lie
[03:36:02.600 --> 03:36:06.680]  it was told to me even by the general and the staff of all for it i will go in
[03:36:06.680 --> 03:36:10.200]  front of a federal committee and swear on
[03:36:10.200 --> 03:36:13.960]  territory who the name was of the individual so that we could break it
[03:36:13.960 --> 03:36:17.960]  open i was furious i knew what had happened i thought stand
[03:36:17.960 --> 03:36:21.560]  down in false flag operations at the national war college
[03:36:21.560 --> 03:36:25.240]  i've caught it with all my operatives so i knew exactly what was done to the
[03:36:25.240 --> 03:36:30.280]  american public believe it or not i had worked on george bush juniors campaign
[03:36:30.280 --> 03:36:34.040]  with bob zealot not with a ball can fill with bob zealot in order to work
[03:36:34.040 --> 03:36:38.840]  against gore which i regret today because i've been loyal to his father
[03:36:38.840 --> 03:36:44.120]  and that issue of osama ben laden that had already who had already been dead
[03:36:44.120 --> 03:36:48.040]  really brought up the issue of the great lie and the great war that was
[03:36:48.040 --> 03:36:51.960]  created for us to make sure that we had some type
[03:36:51.960 --> 03:36:56.200]  of commitment to a war that it was not necessary
[03:36:56.200 --> 03:37:00.200]  where blood and guts were shed for unnecessary reason for men and women
[03:37:00.200 --> 03:37:03.880]  dr pacenic dr pacenic i've got to stop because this is so
[03:37:03.880 --> 03:37:06.840]  dangerous i believe this is the first time
[03:37:06.840 --> 03:37:10.440]  you've gone this far and when the dc madam was on my show
[03:37:10.440 --> 03:37:13.400]  and she was trying to tell me during the break names of people and i said i don't
[03:37:13.400 --> 03:37:15.960]  want to know this you've got to go public with this
[03:37:15.960 --> 03:37:19.240]  they're going to end up you know committing arkansas and obviously you're
[03:37:19.240 --> 03:37:23.480]  a tough guy you're not worried about about that but i mean i don't think so
[03:37:23.480 --> 03:37:26.680]  well do you want to go ahead i mentioned understands that they
[03:37:26.680 --> 03:37:31.720]  we all have a mutual let's say a mutual deterrent relationship it's not going to
[03:37:31.720 --> 03:37:34.760]  be to their benefit no i understand but i mean you don't
[03:37:34.760 --> 03:37:39.560]  want then you don't want to then say the name of the general
[03:37:39.560 --> 03:37:43.720]  the general who sorted me not on i'm not no i will do that in the federal court
[03:37:43.720 --> 03:37:47.800]  so that we can unravel this legally not with the stupid 9 11 commission that
[03:37:47.800 --> 03:37:52.040]  was absurd that was the most absurd thing i had heard that's why it came on your
[03:37:52.040 --> 03:37:54.600]  show alex one of the reasons when i went on the
[03:37:54.600 --> 03:37:57.880]  shows like chris matthews seeing in all of that nonsense
[03:37:57.880 --> 03:38:01.320]  because they wanted me to say certain things and matthews had no idea what we
[03:38:01.320 --> 03:38:04.120]  were talking about and going to iraq at the time
[03:38:04.120 --> 03:38:07.800]  you had all these anchor men and basically pretty boys up there
[03:38:07.800 --> 03:38:11.320]  i've met some of these people they are like children i think i'm not even
[03:38:11.320 --> 03:38:15.320]  saying i'm children they had no idea whether i was a deputy
[03:38:15.320 --> 03:38:18.600]  assistant secretary of what that meant all they wanted me to do was to give
[03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:23.240]  sound bites and i said i refuse then they asked basically so i found you
[03:38:23.240 --> 03:38:26.200]  by chance and i said you know what i heard your show
[03:38:26.200 --> 03:38:30.120]  i told you extremely bright that's not flattery as we talked about
[03:38:30.120 --> 03:38:34.280]  and i was more than grateful to be on your show when i went on your show and i
[03:38:34.280 --> 03:38:38.600]  told you some of them line was dead in 2011 to
[03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:43.960]  i wasn't hypothesizing i knew it because he had marfan syndrome i knew the cia
[03:38:43.960 --> 03:38:48.520]  had investigated had treated him in a dubai hospital american hospital they
[03:38:48.520 --> 03:38:51.160]  didn't deny anything they want that's all they do
[03:38:51.160 --> 03:38:54.600]  they run around creating problems by the way after you said that
[03:38:54.600 --> 03:38:58.600]  see uh dan rather didn't report on it and interviewed the people at the hospital
[03:38:58.600 --> 03:39:01.800]  who saw it oh they did i didn't even see that
[03:39:01.800 --> 03:39:06.120]  with dan rather but by point is you still maintain your credibility
[03:39:06.120 --> 03:39:10.520]  and because ten years later nine years later you mentioned my name
[03:39:10.520 --> 03:39:14.760]  i was stunned i had no idea because i was working on another company i was
[03:39:14.760 --> 03:39:19.080]  paid i'm basically an entrepreneur who volunteers my time for the military to
[03:39:19.080 --> 03:39:23.160]  help them out and basically as an american i said i'm sick of this
[03:39:23.160 --> 03:39:26.520]  and i went back on your show to say this is disgusting
[03:39:26.520 --> 03:39:29.720]  this is so some of them lot an issue again
[03:39:29.720 --> 03:39:34.920]  he stones the issue about an incompetent dysfunctional administration that is
[03:39:34.920 --> 03:39:38.120]  lying once again to the american public
[03:39:38.120 --> 03:39:41.400]  we can't continue this this is why i went on your show
[03:39:41.400 --> 03:39:47.160]  i don't care whether obama's desperate or he's incompetent or he's narcissistic
[03:39:47.160 --> 03:39:51.080]  i care that he does not get reelected i care that the republicans don't get
[03:39:51.080 --> 03:39:54.280]  reelected i care that the american people stand up
[03:39:54.280 --> 03:39:57.880]  once again and say we've had enough of this bullshit
[03:39:57.880 --> 03:40:01.880]  with all these politicians on the republican and democratic side the
[03:40:01.880 --> 03:40:06.600]  capital cronyism the entire incompetency the transnational
[03:40:06.600 --> 03:40:09.960]  corporations and believe me i don't come from the left to the right you don't
[03:40:09.960 --> 03:40:13.240]  serve nixon reagan and bush and come out with these comments
[03:40:13.240 --> 03:40:17.240]  i'm not losing friends and i'm not making friends i don't really care about
[03:40:17.240 --> 03:40:20.680]  those things i do care that is an american
[03:40:20.680 --> 03:40:24.520]  don't mess with me you can imagine the real word i wanted to
[03:40:24.520 --> 03:40:28.360]  you know i understand did you hear my story about don't mess with any of my
[03:40:28.360 --> 03:40:32.440]  people in america that's it and the politicians think they can mess with
[03:40:32.440 --> 03:40:36.120]  you're not their slave and you hate seeing america being gutted by crony
[03:40:36.120 --> 03:40:39.320]  capitalist you got it not only crony capitalist but the
[03:40:39.320 --> 03:40:44.440]  stickable lies and manipulation and men did you hear my story about linel
[03:40:44.440 --> 03:40:48.200]  chetwin uh the the the the white house media head
[03:40:48.200 --> 03:40:52.040]  for propaganda i'm absurd i mean it's absurd you need a white
[03:40:52.040 --> 03:40:55.560]  house think about it for a moment alex to which you need somebody to come out
[03:40:55.560 --> 03:40:59.720]  and talk to say to interpret to a bunch of what sick offense
[03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:04.200]  and reporters in the day of the internet what do you have reporters there for
[03:41:04.200 --> 03:41:08.200]  to translate on a piece of paper what you were taking i mean take of the
[03:41:08.200 --> 03:41:11.160]  notion of the newspaper now it makes no sense
[03:41:11.160 --> 03:41:15.880]  alex well it's an arcane concept my point is they all think
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:18.120]  they all think they're a bunch of gangsters because they're not about to
[03:41:18.120 --> 03:41:21.800]  go on a tv show i'm in the bathroom here comes linel chetwin who
[03:41:21.800 --> 03:41:25.320]  made the made for tv movie about bush being a hero in 911
[03:41:25.320 --> 03:41:28.920]  and he came over like a gangster and started getting my face going we're
[03:41:28.920 --> 03:41:33.400]  gonna f and get you and as soon as i bowed up to him he he almost urinated
[03:41:33.400 --> 03:41:37.240]  on himself and ran out of the room i'm saying these are the type of people i
[03:41:37.240 --> 03:41:40.600]  mean if you're going to threaten somebody in a bathroom you better be ready i
[03:41:40.600 --> 03:41:44.360]  mean do you see what i'm saying yes you got it but they're not most of the
[03:41:44.360 --> 03:41:47.880]  politicians are cowardly in the terms of the dynamics i'm now
[03:41:47.880 --> 03:41:51.560]  speaking of somebody who's a political psychiatrist and treated many of them
[03:41:51.560 --> 03:41:55.800]  they're very insecure very very cowardly they have the same dynamics of movie
[03:41:55.800 --> 03:42:00.600]  stars and actresses they want to say to you love me love me i want more more
[03:42:00.600 --> 03:42:04.440]  more affection they cannot perform they cannot produce
[03:42:04.440 --> 03:42:08.280]  they have no capability to finish anything that they started
[03:42:08.280 --> 03:42:12.280]  they've never been held accountable it is not an accident for the past three
[03:42:12.280 --> 03:42:16.440]  presidents we have had people who've never had a mortgage who have never
[03:42:16.440 --> 03:42:20.920]  been able to have a job clinton left the white house said oh poor me poor me i
[03:42:20.920 --> 03:42:24.120]  have no money a year later he's a hundred million dollars
[03:42:24.120 --> 03:42:28.760]  supporting dubai bringing in a port while hillary clinton comes in and say oh
[03:42:28.760 --> 03:42:31.720]  no we shouldn't have a port george bush jr says i'm
[03:42:31.720 --> 03:42:35.880]  going to go to texas and start a oil company unfortunately his father started
[03:42:35.880 --> 03:42:40.760]  when it had a handed in and he screwed that one up now you have an organizer
[03:42:40.760 --> 03:42:44.200]  in the ghettos of chicago who has done nothing
[03:42:44.200 --> 03:42:49.720]  absolutely nothing has never really held the job has never been a but perhaps
[03:42:49.720 --> 03:42:53.960]  he's given a few lectures as a professor god only knows he was what at
[03:42:53.960 --> 03:42:56.840]  harvard and everybody thinks that's a great position
[03:42:56.840 --> 03:43:01.880]  and somehow mysteriously from the most crooked city in this country
[03:43:01.880 --> 03:43:05.560]  chicago we get a president how is that possible
[03:43:05.560 --> 03:43:09.560]  with ramion manuel who has a master's degree in ballet
[03:43:09.560 --> 03:43:14.360]  now that is really impressive to me and we know what that really means he has a
[03:43:14.360 --> 03:43:17.720]  master's degree and uh he's a staff for a man who's
[03:43:17.720 --> 03:43:22.840]  never been in the presidency and it's really was shocking and then he talks
[03:43:22.840 --> 03:43:28.360]  about the end and under bush jr we have a major crisis in the banking system he
[03:43:28.360 --> 03:43:32.200]  doesn't know what to do he brings in paulson who had no idea what he was
[03:43:32.200 --> 03:43:36.360]  doing because i was a banker by the way one of my positions was his managing
[03:43:36.360 --> 03:43:40.520]  director of investment bank taking it down for six months and left wall street
[03:43:40.520 --> 03:43:44.360]  it was so disgusting and i knew paulson had no idea and when i talked to the
[03:43:44.360 --> 03:43:47.640]  congressman i said listen guys you don't have a banker there they have
[03:43:47.640 --> 03:43:50.760]  no idea what they're doing lo and behold that whole thing
[03:43:50.760 --> 03:43:54.520]  unfolded and now we have such a crippled banking well sir you like
[03:43:54.520 --> 03:43:58.600]  betray us and i respect that but it was also
[03:43:58.600 --> 03:44:03.080]  henry paulson repeatedly did collapse in closed sessions two different days
[03:44:03.080 --> 03:44:06.680]  betray us collapsed what's all this collapsing business
[03:44:06.680 --> 03:44:09.960]  uh basically i don't know about paulson collapse betray us
[03:44:09.960 --> 03:44:14.440]  i it's public he has cancer the prostate that's not that's not classic but
[03:44:14.440 --> 03:44:18.520]  oh really those things but haven't it's not a well man he's also a man who
[03:44:18.520 --> 03:44:22.760]  overreaches but paulson i would not say is the hero of this country i understand
[03:44:22.760 --> 03:44:25.960]  i understand working too hard and then collapsing i've i've i've
[03:44:25.960 --> 03:44:30.600]  i've uh now betray us i think has had an illness which was not classified he has
[03:44:30.600 --> 03:44:34.680]  had cancer the prostate i assume he's better but he's worked very hard but
[03:44:34.680 --> 03:44:38.840]  the issue with paulson is that man was incompetent he's an investment banker
[03:44:38.840 --> 03:44:43.080]  he has nothing to do with cash flow physical policy then you had green
[03:44:43.080 --> 03:44:47.080]  span he told you he was doing a wonderful job and he put the foot
[03:44:47.080 --> 03:44:52.040]  the accelerator to the paddle and boy we went right over the abyss and then he
[03:44:52.040 --> 03:44:55.320]  comes back and says oh no that was a minor incident
[03:44:55.320 --> 03:44:59.640]  derivatives were really very effective let me throw a few more
[03:44:59.640 --> 03:45:03.000]  questions in for him we'll take a few calls this is unbelievable dr pacenek
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:07.000]  steve pacenek.com um the anthrax attacks you know they
[03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:09.400]  said it was brewed in a bathtub later they admitted
[03:45:09.400 --> 03:45:13.800]  super u.s weapons grade miniaturized hundreds of millions of dollars of
[03:45:13.800 --> 03:45:17.080]  equipment needed what was the anthrax attack
[03:45:17.080 --> 03:45:20.760]  i really don't know that one i have to bow out i i i don't know
[03:45:20.760 --> 03:45:24.680]  you know what that was bad but you know what's your intel on obama
[03:45:24.680 --> 03:45:29.720]  uh and and and and why they're been suppressing so many of his records what
[03:45:29.720 --> 03:45:33.320]  what are you picking up on that you know what at this particular point in time
[03:45:33.320 --> 03:45:37.160]  i think it's best that your audience figure out what the history of obama
[03:45:37.160 --> 03:45:40.200]  was in chicago i really don't want to get into the
[03:45:40.200 --> 03:45:42.840]  birthing thing i think that's been discussed
[03:45:42.840 --> 03:45:46.520]  but there are other issues and i think it's best that this country
[03:45:46.520 --> 03:45:50.200]  do its own homework you have a very intelligent audience and i think they
[03:45:50.200 --> 03:45:53.320]  should find out about themselves what he did in chicago
[03:45:53.320 --> 03:45:58.040]  what's his relationship to rami immanuel why was rami immanuel brought in
[03:45:58.040 --> 03:46:02.280]  and why is and why is he now mayor of chicago
[03:46:02.280 --> 03:46:07.560]  a masters in ballet who had no other profession we got it so so so it looks
[03:46:07.560 --> 03:46:11.000]  like immanuel's blackmailing obama somehow with the
[03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:14.520]  fact that they like to i didn't say that i just want your audience to do that
[03:46:14.520 --> 03:46:18.680]  due diligence as you have i want them to follow you and what you said
[03:46:18.680 --> 03:46:24.040]  and that is to be in and educated self-educated and informed well we know
[03:46:24.040 --> 03:46:27.560]  we all we know all about male ballet dancers we'll just leave it at that
[03:46:27.560 --> 03:46:31.800]  statistically it's not a ballet dancer this is a master in ballet
[03:46:31.800 --> 03:46:35.960]  should be on that ballet you know well i mean there are occasional black sheep
[03:46:35.960 --> 03:46:39.000]  who are male ballet dancers i don't know about that all i know is his
[03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:42.520]  brother and one brother's an agent in hollywood and his other brother's
[03:46:42.520 --> 03:46:46.520]  court is a physician at the united well what about their family connections
[03:46:46.520 --> 03:46:50.920]  to uh eargun uh in israel father was in your goon say looming
[03:46:50.920 --> 03:46:54.360]  that it's true it's father was a pediatrician it was part of a terrorist
[03:46:54.360 --> 03:47:00.680]  plane he himself i think served in the ida for a period of time
[03:47:00.680 --> 03:47:04.200]  unbelievable sir uh in the last 12 minutes we have let's uh take some phone
[03:47:04.200 --> 03:47:07.880]  calls i'll try to tomorrow take take more calls folks but this has been
[03:47:07.880 --> 03:47:11.800]  unbelievable anything else about the inside job that was 9 11 i mean you're
[03:47:11.800 --> 03:47:15.480]  saying you've talked to high level u.s government officials millard side job
[03:47:15.480 --> 03:47:19.400]  is that nobody has been held accountable kenneth should never received an award
[03:47:19.400 --> 03:47:23.000]  he should have been put on trial bush should have been put on trial janey
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:27.000]  should be put on trial as ronsel instead they all received books
[03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:31.800]  condoleezza should be put on trial and investigated under perjury on charges
[03:47:31.800 --> 03:47:35.720]  of perjury and war crime it's as simple as that by the way abc news
[03:47:35.720 --> 03:47:40.840]  the left hand did report that people elliott abrams you've got woeful widths
[03:47:40.840 --> 03:47:45.480]  out there and you've got a lot of potential criminals if this country
[03:47:45.480 --> 03:47:49.560]  doesn't come to its resolution instead of creating this nonsense that we have a
[03:47:49.560 --> 03:47:54.440]  war and we have heroes and and we do have victims we have to stop this
[03:47:54.440 --> 03:47:59.480]  otherwise we can't go forward well it was an abc news that top military brass
[03:47:59.480 --> 03:48:02.440]  a week before cancel their september 11th flight to new york
[03:48:02.440 --> 03:48:05.800]  mayor willie brown uh services go chronicle this was confirmed
[03:48:05.800 --> 03:48:09.640]  called condoleezza i know she called him and said don't fly
[03:48:09.640 --> 03:48:13.720]  to new york i mean these guys are just red-handed caught
[03:48:13.720 --> 03:48:17.320]  then lying about never hearing chatter about flying planes in the buildings
[03:48:17.320 --> 03:48:20.360]  went on record they ordered fbi agents nationwide
[03:48:20.360 --> 03:48:26.120]  who were on the trail of the legend they were building the fake decoy history
[03:48:26.120 --> 03:48:29.320]  and they were and they demoted or fired those agents
[03:48:29.320 --> 03:48:36.200]  and gave record bonuses to the fbi bosses who who who who blocked the fbi
[03:48:36.200 --> 03:48:41.000]  trying to stop the attacks i mean and it goes on and on and on and on
[03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:45.000]  you know it's time again that i say we have our own
[03:48:45.000 --> 03:48:50.440]  diarrhea square the young kids of egypt went for us and and did what they did
[03:48:50.440 --> 03:48:54.360]  america needs a second revolution that second revolution
[03:48:54.360 --> 03:48:59.160]  has to entail the peaceful means by which we can get rid of this type of
[03:48:59.160 --> 03:49:05.000]  capital cronyism corruption and criminal activity it's again we were
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:10.200]  born of a revolution a real revolution we fought england twice not once but
[03:49:10.200 --> 03:49:16.200]  twice and we need to now understand that our government has no longer serve the
[03:49:16.200 --> 03:49:20.600]  people for the people by the people and that's why i came back on your show i
[03:49:20.600 --> 03:49:25.880]  was so disgusted to hear this nonsense about osama bin latin
[03:49:25.880 --> 03:49:31.240]  being resurrected and and that they are shot in unless they attacked a mortuary
[03:49:31.240 --> 03:49:35.640]  no idea what this nonsense was but the point is it underlie
[03:49:35.640 --> 03:49:40.600]  another cancerous administration with lies the seats
[03:49:40.600 --> 03:49:44.040]  the trail including the republicans and democrats
[03:49:44.040 --> 03:49:48.280]  and the legislation i'm not you know right winger
[03:49:48.280 --> 03:49:51.800]  i'm not a conspiracyist i trained at harvard
[03:49:51.800 --> 03:49:56.120]  miti i've been under five presidency so no matter what the press tells you
[03:49:56.120 --> 03:50:01.160]  no matter what they'll say alex jones had the courage enough to put me on the
[03:50:01.160 --> 03:50:04.680]  air and i had the goal enough to go on the air
[03:50:04.680 --> 03:50:09.080]  which is by the way not unusual for me because i told some president to leave
[03:50:09.080 --> 03:50:13.480]  go screw yourself but because i saved lives my job isn't to take down
[03:50:13.480 --> 03:50:18.920]  countries only it's to save hostages i saved many hundreds of hostages lies
[03:50:18.920 --> 03:50:23.960]  now i was so disgusted i went back on your show that thank you for allowing me to
[03:50:23.960 --> 03:50:28.520]  address the incredible public well thank you thank you dr pacenica moment that
[03:50:28.520 --> 03:50:31.800]  say this is enough and that's all i want to say
[03:50:31.800 --> 03:50:35.800]  wow wow let's jam some calls in here this is an unbelievable interview
[03:50:35.800 --> 03:50:39.160]  uh ladies and gentlemen it's it's all of our job to get this interview on the
[03:50:39.160 --> 03:50:43.400]  podcast and the youtube's and the audio of it out to everybody
[03:50:43.400 --> 03:50:46.920]  let's talk to alex and michigan you're on the air alex go ahead
[03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:51.400]  hi mr jones and dr pacenic my question for you doctor
[03:50:51.400 --> 03:50:55.800]  is that when we deal with this as you aptly put this nonsense with
[03:50:55.800 --> 03:50:59.800]  osama bin laden allegedly being captured and killed
[03:50:59.800 --> 03:51:03.640]  if this operation was allegedly authorized and carried out a couple of
[03:51:03.640 --> 03:51:07.080]  weeks ago in april so why did obama wait
[03:51:07.080 --> 03:51:11.000]  that long a time and then announced this out of all places
[03:51:11.000 --> 03:51:16.280]  uh... sunday night at ten thirty and my second part of the question of that is
[03:51:16.280 --> 03:51:21.320]  if we go back uh... a week ago after a bin laden would have
[03:51:21.320 --> 03:51:25.560]  supposedly been killed we see the shuffle with paniera and patria into the
[03:51:25.560 --> 03:51:30.600]  defense department and cia what does all of this mean what is the purpose of
[03:51:30.600 --> 03:51:35.640]  waiting but what is that it's very good question i have the timing i can't
[03:51:35.640 --> 03:51:39.400]  i can speculate basically they did it so late so that nobody could comment on
[03:51:39.400 --> 03:51:44.120]  its uh reason for the uh timing and and now at this particular point time
[03:51:44.120 --> 03:51:48.840]  his gaze is leaving and panera had to establish some credibility where he
[03:51:48.840 --> 03:51:52.440]  had none before the pakistanis were extremely
[03:51:52.440 --> 03:51:56.440]  angry that he had killed many civilians which he had also if you remember
[03:51:56.440 --> 03:52:01.560]  correctly two years ago he had made a major mess where cia operatives were
[03:52:01.560 --> 03:52:03.640]  killed because there was no clearance
[03:52:03.640 --> 03:52:08.040]  secondly you have to remember now the cia is not the cia
[03:52:08.040 --> 03:52:11.640]  of the cold war or the people the brave people i worked with
[03:52:11.640 --> 03:52:15.000]  in the eighties and nineties this is a very different cia now
[03:52:15.000 --> 03:52:20.120]  eighty percent of the cia right now are contract employees listen to what i'm
[03:52:20.120 --> 03:52:24.280]  saying that means their mercenaries we have primarily mercenaries
[03:52:24.280 --> 03:52:28.840]  underneath canada and that is not an intel operative he's basically i've
[03:52:28.840 --> 03:52:31.240]  got to give him his credit he's a budget man
[03:52:31.240 --> 03:52:35.640]  and the reason they're moving him to the state of the defense department now is
[03:52:35.640 --> 03:52:39.480]  gates is leaving because gates was an excellent secretary's defense but don't
[03:52:39.480 --> 03:52:44.760]  mercenaries open you up to total uh infiltration
[03:52:44.760 --> 03:52:47.960]  oh yeah because you don't know who they're loyal to only one thing the
[03:52:47.960 --> 03:52:51.640]  dollar the american public has to understand we have primarily
[03:52:51.640 --> 03:52:55.400]  mercenaries in most of what we have in contract
[03:52:55.400 --> 03:52:58.920]  offices when they say we have contract fees we have mercenaries
[03:52:58.920 --> 03:53:02.520]  many of our troops are very disgusted with that because i've got a soldier who
[03:53:02.520 --> 03:53:04.920]  makes thirty five thousand dollars and next to him
[03:53:04.920 --> 03:53:09.000]  i'm the same man making a quarter of a million with no better with no taxes
[03:53:09.000 --> 03:53:13.400]  whatsoever and no restrictions in terms of he has immunity
[03:53:13.400 --> 03:53:17.400]  alex i appreciate your basic alex what i'm saying to you is the timing had to
[03:53:17.400 --> 03:53:20.440]  do with gates leaving panetta having been switched
[03:53:20.440 --> 03:53:23.560]  into the secretary defense although i suspect you didn't really want to be
[03:53:23.560 --> 03:53:27.960]  sick death you want to remain as dc i direct to the cia and and
[03:53:27.960 --> 03:53:32.760]  betray us is heading up the cia which is unusual for a general because he ran the
[03:53:32.760 --> 03:53:35.800]  special forces units and sent com and he ran
[03:53:35.800 --> 03:53:40.680]  uh much of the war in afghanistan in iraq and he knows the drone and he knows
[03:53:40.680 --> 03:53:45.000]  the uh so called out we've got a jump here that's why you sure and and i agree
[03:53:45.000 --> 03:53:48.360]  with you ten o'clock at night so the papers were already lined up to not
[03:53:48.360 --> 03:53:52.120]  question to them to have total control the message the next morning
[03:53:52.120 --> 03:53:55.480]  to control the entire week with the announcement and the whole thing was
[03:53:55.480 --> 03:53:58.840]  scripted uh let's talk to adrian are you agree dr
[03:53:58.840 --> 03:54:02.280]  pacenic i'm sorry no you said something
[03:54:02.280 --> 03:54:06.360]  i'm sorry did you say no i didn't say okay adrian
[03:54:06.360 --> 03:54:13.160]  in missouri you're on the air hi doctor um my question is after all the
[03:54:13.160 --> 03:54:17.320]  disrespect all this this this shenanigans is going on with
[03:54:17.320 --> 03:54:22.200]  osama being dead and everything and obama trying to get reelected
[03:54:22.200 --> 03:54:30.120]  after all of this is done you know um after that announcement in 2012
[03:54:30.120 --> 03:54:33.960]  that he has won the presidency again or whatever
[03:54:33.960 --> 03:54:38.600]  how do you think america is going to react you know i'm saying like
[03:54:38.600 --> 03:54:44.200]  what is approval radios going to be and if they stoop so low again
[03:54:44.200 --> 03:54:47.400]  how will you try to get america back on board what
[03:54:47.400 --> 03:54:51.240]  what you know that's an excellent question adrian i really think about it
[03:54:51.240 --> 03:54:55.000]  and i don't know the answer but this is what i would speculate our unemployment
[03:54:55.000 --> 03:54:59.400]  is still remaining high we have had capital investments but we're not
[03:54:59.400 --> 03:55:03.160]  doing it into major uh projects like railroads which we need
[03:55:03.160 --> 03:55:06.920]  breaches that have to be reconstructed houses that have to go we need to get
[03:55:06.920 --> 03:55:10.920]  that unemployment tends to 19 million people back on the job
[03:55:10.920 --> 03:55:14.440]  he will get reelected and he will probably do whatever he needs to do
[03:55:14.440 --> 03:55:17.960]  which is an agenda that is not clear at this point
[03:55:17.960 --> 03:55:21.800]  but he will continue to push through obama care which will be a disaster for
[03:55:21.800 --> 03:55:25.640]  our health program unemployment will probably remain high
[03:55:25.640 --> 03:55:29.720]  and he will remain he will keep the military positioned in the areas where
[03:55:29.720 --> 03:55:33.800]  we don't need it and basically our capital cronyism will
[03:55:33.800 --> 03:55:39.720]  will continue but i warned of two things the food prices and gas prices will
[03:55:39.720 --> 03:55:43.800]  continue to rise food prices have risen 35 percent
[03:55:43.800 --> 03:55:47.960]  because we decreased the value of the dollar the commodity prices went up but
[03:55:47.960 --> 03:55:51.880]  adrian it's an excellent question the sheet does not
[03:55:51.880 --> 03:55:55.080]  change his color i mean basically he's going to be
[03:55:55.080 --> 03:55:58.680]  what he's always been he's going to accommodate to the moment and to the
[03:55:58.680 --> 03:56:02.680]  interest of the people for whom he works which is not the united states of
[03:56:02.680 --> 03:56:06.280]  america the banking primarily in wall street in the transnational
[03:56:06.280 --> 03:56:09.400]  corporation but it's an excellent question i can't really
[03:56:09.400 --> 03:56:12.920]  further detail things out other than the fact that we're headed for more and
[03:56:12.920 --> 03:56:16.360]  more economic crisis all right default on our debt
[03:56:16.360 --> 03:56:20.280]  we are a major major problem and that's already basically
[03:56:20.280 --> 03:56:24.600]  happening with the monetization they're just not doing it one big bang they're
[03:56:24.600 --> 03:56:29.160]  slowly uh killing it but but geithner wanted to raise the debt
[03:56:29.160 --> 03:56:33.880]  ceiling now treasury is announcing uh that they are
[03:56:33.880 --> 03:56:37.400]  maybe going to keep it under here's the headline treasury to take steps to stay
[03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:40.600]  below debt ceiling that's what standard and poor said they said it's the
[03:56:40.600 --> 03:56:43.640]  increase spending raising the debt ceiling is why
[03:56:43.640 --> 03:56:47.000]  we have a negative outlook on you keeping triple a
[03:56:47.000 --> 03:56:50.360]  and then he came out two weeks ago and said that if we didn't raise it that
[03:56:50.360 --> 03:56:54.200]  would cause the default but now they're shifting gears saying okay they
[03:56:54.200 --> 03:56:58.600]  they may have to cut are they starting to get some reality dr pacinic
[03:56:58.600 --> 03:57:01.720]  no not really what they're doing is playing with money remember
[03:57:01.720 --> 03:57:04.920]  every phenomenon every currency is denominated still in
[03:57:04.920 --> 03:57:08.360]  in the dollar system and as long as the dollar system is there the federal
[03:57:08.360 --> 03:57:11.000]  reserve will control it that breton woods
[03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:14.760]  right after world war two and new Hampshire a lot of smart men made sure
[03:57:14.760 --> 03:57:17.560]  that everything around the world was denominated dollars
[03:57:17.560 --> 03:57:21.240]  where we're going to have the major problem in crisis is that
[03:57:21.240 --> 03:57:25.000]  we will have an inflationary spiral that they cannot control
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:28.360]  and so that's why gold keeps going up out of fear
[03:57:28.360 --> 03:57:32.680]  yeah in and of itself gold has no value other than the historical value
[03:57:32.680 --> 03:57:36.760]  aesthetic value whatever but the bottom line is economically
[03:57:36.760 --> 03:57:40.920]  we're not in a position unless we keep manufacturing one of the great things
[03:57:40.920 --> 03:57:44.360]  about the state of texas is that you really are very independent of many
[03:57:44.360 --> 03:57:47.640]  ways in terms of resources manufacturing and oil
[03:57:47.640 --> 03:57:51.080]  we have enough oil in the united states to start drilling here
[03:57:51.080 --> 03:57:56.680]  gas oil everywhere from montana to down to texas opaloma but the cronies want
[03:57:56.680 --> 03:58:00.360]  to keep it shut down so they can make more money on their
[03:58:00.360 --> 03:58:04.280]  foreign investments another form of artificial scarcity dr pechenek i want
[03:58:04.280 --> 03:58:10.360]  to put bookends on this historic uh now almost two hour interview

[04:01:16.200 --> 04:01:19.720]  there's a lot that's happened it's compounded but as you and i said there
[04:01:19.720 --> 04:01:23.640]  is a very self-destructive element of these leaders that we've elected
[04:01:23.640 --> 04:01:27.800]  and that is and alex and i just talked about in the private session
[04:01:27.800 --> 04:01:31.160]  as people who are basically liars and contrivers and
[04:01:31.160 --> 04:01:35.400]  deceivers and deceptives what happens is like any bank robber
[04:01:35.400 --> 04:01:39.000]  they eventually get to the point where john billinger was caught
[04:01:39.000 --> 04:01:42.600]  they want to get caught and they have they get a certain thrill out of the
[04:01:42.600 --> 04:01:46.440]  notion that the more crises they create and the more deceptions they create
[04:01:46.440 --> 04:01:51.080]  that really is a turn on for them and it allows them to exert the power and
[04:01:51.080 --> 04:01:54.520]  manipulation deception that they're trained in they're not trained for
[04:01:54.520 --> 04:01:58.040]  honesty they're not trained to implement they're not trying to be direct
[04:01:58.040 --> 04:02:01.640]  they're not trying to accomplish or create assets they're trying to deceive
[04:02:01.640 --> 04:02:05.880]  manipulate and lie that's the nature of most politicians because basically
[04:02:05.880 --> 04:02:10.280]  the mendicants they're asking you up front please vote for me why
[04:02:10.280 --> 04:02:13.880]  well i'm a nice guy and i'll do whatever you want well if i give you the money
[04:02:13.880 --> 04:02:17.400]  what are you then well i'm nothing more than a prostitute well that's
[04:02:17.400 --> 04:02:21.480]  basically what happens they're either panders or they become prostitutes but
[04:02:21.480 --> 04:02:25.800]  you don't expect them to affect your lives in a way where you're going to be
[04:02:25.800 --> 04:02:30.360]  submissive to them so what i said to alex and alex agreed and he said the
[04:02:30.360 --> 04:02:34.280]  point to me that through history what happens to the mendicants who are
[04:02:34.280 --> 04:02:37.480]  elected and the sociopaths who come to power is
[04:02:37.480 --> 04:02:41.800]  eventually they self-destruct but the important thing in this self-destruction
[04:02:41.800 --> 04:02:46.440]  is that we do not go with them and under george busch we began the
[04:02:46.440 --> 04:02:50.760]  self-destruction of the united states and unfortunately we're continuing that
[04:02:50.760 --> 04:02:55.320]  under obama and that has to stop and that's why i came back onto the alex
[04:02:55.320 --> 04:03:00.360]  jones show and said listen this is an honest man who's done an incredible job
[04:03:00.360 --> 04:03:05.160]  alex and basically people who've listened who are smart
[04:03:05.160 --> 04:03:08.680]  who work hard in this country and i've said it again
[04:03:08.680 --> 04:03:14.360]  we are in a self-destructive spiral that began 20 years ago decades ago with
[04:03:14.360 --> 04:03:20.840]  liars deceivers and manipulators who have destroyed the integrity and
[04:03:20.840 --> 04:03:25.720]  viability of our country and have been reinforced by the laziness and
[04:03:25.720 --> 04:03:29.800]  incompetency of dysfunctional people both in the government
[04:03:29.800 --> 04:03:33.640]  and in congress do not think that they're any better they will become
[04:03:33.640 --> 04:03:38.760]  braver or more effective now the power has to come back to the united states of
[04:03:38.760 --> 04:03:43.640]  america to we the people where the individual is supreme
[04:03:43.640 --> 04:03:47.320]  absolutely and doc you're showing a lot of courage
[04:03:47.320 --> 04:03:51.080]  because clearly you can see it's degenerating it's degenerating faster
[04:03:51.080 --> 04:03:54.120]  and faster we've got to get real or we're not going to be able to fix these
[04:03:54.120 --> 04:03:58.280]  problems but but but just my me i'm not showing any courage let me be
[04:03:58.280 --> 04:04:01.800]  frank with you alex i fought for this country and i've been in eight different
[04:04:01.800 --> 04:04:07.480]  combat situations where my life was at risk i don't have a problem
[04:04:07.480 --> 04:04:12.200]  affording myself the next opportunity to be on your show and if it takes a nice
[04:04:12.200 --> 04:04:14.920]  time that they want to take me out that's fine
[04:04:14.920 --> 04:04:18.600]  but the issue is i'm not any more courageous than an american who has to go
[04:04:18.600 --> 04:04:22.680]  to work has to take two jobs has to support his family
[04:04:22.680 --> 04:04:25.880]  has to pay food prices that are 30 higher
[04:04:25.880 --> 04:04:31.320]  medicare that's unbelievably uh not a reflective of the times where doctors
[04:04:31.320 --> 04:04:35.720]  have to be on call 24 seven or your father has to be a dental surgeon
[04:04:35.720 --> 04:04:39.800]  and has no backup and no guarantee that he will make a living
[04:04:39.800 --> 04:04:44.280]  this is not the american way all i'm trying to say to america i'm not a hero
[04:04:44.280 --> 04:04:48.520]  i'm just another american who happened to have the opportunity to serve five
[04:04:48.520 --> 04:04:51.960]  president i left i didn't ask for now i understand but you're
[04:04:51.960 --> 04:04:55.240]  and i mean you're and you're engaging in common sense and dealing with a
[04:04:55.240 --> 04:04:59.800]  problem but that's all i am it doesn't matter what my degree is but i am
[04:04:59.800 --> 04:05:05.240]  disgusted beyond belief to tell you this can not continue
[04:05:05.240 --> 04:05:09.000]  the deception and lies of just another president
[04:05:09.000 --> 04:05:12.280]  with another congress and another white house creating this
[04:05:12.280 --> 04:05:18.440]  non-sensible psychological operation treating it as if we were children
[04:05:18.440 --> 04:05:21.880]  stupid and the media is if they were stupid and
[04:05:21.880 --> 04:05:27.720]  children and creating this ridiculous circus of nationalism patriotism when
[04:05:27.720 --> 04:05:30.680]  in fact they're cowardly they're deceptive
[04:05:30.680 --> 04:05:34.040]  they're ineffectual and they're dysfunctional
[04:05:34.040 --> 04:05:38.600]  that's not acceptable that's sick in closing before we take two final calls
[04:05:38.600 --> 04:05:42.920]  doctrine this has been amazing before we go any further just going back to the
[04:05:42.920 --> 04:05:47.960]  basic criminology the psychology doesn't take a rocket scientist for me to see
[04:05:47.960 --> 04:05:52.040]  the serial killers they start getting wilder and wilder
[04:05:52.040 --> 04:05:55.320]  wanting to be caught or they send letters to the police
[04:05:55.320 --> 04:05:58.760]  taunting them and and and really i think that's what this is with these
[04:05:58.760 --> 04:06:03.640]  ridiculous lies uh where it's of course i mean they
[04:06:03.640 --> 04:06:06.040]  want to be caught but i will leave with two really
[04:06:06.040 --> 04:06:09.320]  complex comments i once said on your radio show and i don't mean to be very
[04:06:09.320 --> 04:06:13.080]  arrogant about it i said the voice of the people
[04:06:13.080 --> 04:06:17.800]  is the voice of god let us hear the voice of your people and the american
[04:06:17.800 --> 04:06:22.040]  people let us say again it's enough we don't want any more
[04:06:22.040 --> 04:06:25.800]  it's basically opus deus folks off populace
[04:06:25.800 --> 04:06:29.400]  folks deus the voice of the people is voice of god
[04:06:29.400 --> 04:06:33.640]  we fought a revolution against britain now let us fight a revolution
[04:06:33.640 --> 04:06:37.160]  against the tyranny of what we see a suppression
[04:06:37.160 --> 04:06:41.800]  deception crony capitalism it doesn't have to be violent
[04:06:41.800 --> 04:06:46.120]  it does have to be effective and i have no greater faith than in the american
[04:06:46.120 --> 04:06:50.520]  people than i have in any other country only in this country can i serve a
[04:06:50.520 --> 04:06:55.080]  president and also disagree with the president and remember that
[04:06:55.080 --> 04:07:00.520]  well beautifully said beautifully said but i see the sickness of the modern
[04:07:00.520 --> 04:07:05.080]  heroes with their megalomania through the media pushing their
[04:07:05.080 --> 04:07:09.800]  false realities infecting my fellow americans they're trying to sell us on
[04:07:09.800 --> 04:07:12.920]  their delusional sickness it's like i'm sure you saw this doctor the carl
[04:07:12.920 --> 04:07:16.040]  rove quote to the new york times reporter where they said
[04:07:16.040 --> 04:07:19.720]  you're lying about wmds you're setting up a police state
[04:07:19.720 --> 04:07:23.160]  and he said you are what we call the reality-based community
[04:07:23.160 --> 04:07:27.480]  trying to look for facts but we're an empire now we control reality even if
[04:07:27.480 --> 04:07:31.400]  it isn't what we say it is and he was almost trying to
[04:07:31.400 --> 04:07:35.880]  break their will and just say like oh brian torturing winston
[04:07:35.880 --> 04:07:39.640]  in 1984 i don't want you to say two plus two equals five
[04:07:39.640 --> 04:07:44.440]  i want you to say and believe it's whatever i tell you
[04:07:44.440 --> 04:07:48.040]  freedom is not having a mind freedom is being a slave
[04:07:48.040 --> 04:07:51.880]  and and and right so there's seven remember what we remember what thomas
[04:07:51.880 --> 04:07:55.240]  jefferson said very clearly every generation must
[04:07:55.240 --> 04:07:59.560]  fight to have its own freedom if we do not do this now
[04:07:59.560 --> 04:08:04.360]  we will never do it again trust me carl rove is nothing but a second hand
[04:08:04.360 --> 04:08:08.360]  sick offense criminal he is a disgusting individual
[04:08:08.360 --> 04:08:12.520]  there's no reason why he should have come back he's one of those war crimes
[04:08:12.520 --> 04:08:17.000]  but that's not the issue the issues to the american public to come out again
[04:08:17.000 --> 04:08:20.360]  and do what they do whether it's twitter internet and
[04:08:20.360 --> 04:08:23.720]  talk among themselves and we're gonna have you back we're gonna have you back
[04:08:23.720 --> 04:08:27.240]  doctor very soon to talk about happy to talk about you with that with your
[04:08:27.240 --> 04:08:30.920]  research in this audience enough you've been wonderful and i thank you for the
[04:08:30.920 --> 04:08:33.880]  opportunity to express my idea you bet we're gonna cram in
[04:08:33.880 --> 04:08:37.560]  two final calls and we're done or three bill in kinetica quickly run the air
[04:08:37.560 --> 04:08:42.520]  with dr pechenek thank you yes uh wow what a show alex
[04:08:42.520 --> 04:08:48.120]  um dr pechenek uh yes sir from two sources from a gentleman by the name of
[04:08:48.120 --> 04:08:51.800]  john perkins who wrote a book confessions of an economic
[04:08:51.800 --> 04:08:57.080]  an assassin and lindsay williams uh both were on the alex
[04:08:57.080 --> 04:09:00.200]  john show um had indicated that back in the early
[04:09:00.200 --> 04:09:06.280]  seventies uh kissinger went over to the saudis and made a deal whereby
[04:09:06.280 --> 04:09:09.880]  we would buy their oil if they bought our debt
[04:09:09.880 --> 04:09:14.760]  and with the interest on that debt we would uh build their infrastructure
[04:09:14.760 --> 04:09:20.840]  and and uh their oil refineries uh flash forward to the present
[04:09:20.840 --> 04:09:24.600]  now we're in a position whereby supposedly
[04:09:24.600 --> 04:09:29.720]  uh the the elites want to implode and devalue the dollar
[04:09:29.720 --> 04:09:34.360]  uh in order to bring out bring up either a one-world currency or the emerald
[04:09:34.360 --> 04:09:37.800]  starting with that uh and i'd like your take on that
[04:09:37.800 --> 04:09:41.400]  and then the follow-up question is on the banks what
[04:09:41.400 --> 04:09:44.920]  can we do to prosecute these criminals and bring
[04:09:44.920 --> 04:09:48.520]  almost out of time great question the banks is the most important one that
[04:09:48.520 --> 04:09:52.600]  has to be demanded that the criminals be prosecuted there's no question about it
[04:09:52.600 --> 04:09:54.760]  and then you can withdraw money from the banks
[04:09:54.760 --> 04:09:57.880]  they're the major one bank of america city bank
[04:09:57.880 --> 04:10:02.360]  you've got jp morgan the issue of kissinger i i don't approve of him i
[04:10:02.360 --> 04:10:05.240]  didn't work directly for him i i worked for eagles burger but you're
[04:10:05.240 --> 04:10:08.920]  corrected what he said in terms of the money i go back to the brettanwood
[04:10:08.920 --> 04:10:13.240]  conference in the late 40s right after the war where all the currencies were
[04:10:13.240 --> 04:10:17.160]  denominated in the dollar it will be very very hard it costs
[04:10:17.160 --> 04:10:21.480]  trillions of dollars to break that currency and to create other currency
[04:10:21.480 --> 04:10:26.040]  but one will not be possible the russians tried it the arabs tried it
[04:10:26.040 --> 04:10:29.640]  it's not going to work everything's denominated the dollar no matter how you
[04:10:29.640 --> 04:10:33.800]  look at it as long as the dollar is there it will be controlled by the federal
[04:10:33.800 --> 04:10:37.800]  reserve it will be a currency to remain there for several years the
[04:10:37.800 --> 04:10:40.520]  the reason the dollar is going down now quite frankly
[04:10:40.520 --> 04:10:44.760]  is really because we're in an economic war which is an effective war against
[04:10:44.760 --> 04:10:47.720]  right now china because we want to export our products
[04:10:47.720 --> 04:10:51.720]  and we're doing quite well at that but the real reason is it's very hard to get
[04:10:51.720 --> 04:10:56.200]  a one one state or one currency element other than the dollar it's just very
[04:10:56.200 --> 04:10:59.080]  bad all right final caller this is amazing
[04:10:59.080 --> 04:11:02.600]  trevor in nevada you're on the air go ahead
[04:11:02.600 --> 04:11:06.920]  hi yeah um i just had a question uh well first of all good show great show
[04:11:06.920 --> 04:11:11.800]  um i just had a question if they're not able if they're not producing a body
[04:11:11.800 --> 04:11:16.280]  then uh is that going to expand into like the courts
[04:11:16.280 --> 04:11:19.720]  now that they don't have to produce anybody or anything to convict anybody
[04:11:19.720 --> 04:11:23.640]  or any dna evidence i really don't know that i mean
[04:11:23.640 --> 04:11:27.640]  if when you have a lie and you distort the line you make it into a circus i
[04:11:27.640 --> 04:11:31.320]  don't know who's attending the circus and who's going to prosecute but honestly
[04:11:31.320 --> 04:11:36.520]  with all due respect i you know this is such a travesty of reality that i don't
[04:11:36.520 --> 04:11:39.720]  even know how they're going to do anything and why they should do it well
[04:11:39.720 --> 04:11:42.120]  dr pacenic and we'll get another question from trevor hold on a second
[04:11:42.120 --> 04:11:43.960]  forever so i want to get this in now before i forget
[04:11:43.960 --> 04:11:48.280]  how about every new channel this proves torture is good torture is wonderful
[04:11:48.280 --> 04:11:53.080]  this proves extra judicial killing is good this proves rendition is good this
[04:11:53.080 --> 04:11:56.600]  proves it i mean i mean it's like saying it proves the moon is made out of
[04:11:56.600 --> 04:12:01.800]  cheese it's just sick it's sick and first of all rendition
[04:12:01.800 --> 04:12:07.000]  created by clint was a disaster and it was unconstitutional torture does not
[04:12:07.000 --> 04:12:10.360]  work if you have to be tortured it's disgusting it's unethical
[04:12:10.360 --> 04:12:13.160]  it really doesn't work i've never had to use it
[04:12:13.160 --> 04:12:16.440]  and i've had more than enough terrorists reveal what i needed to have
[04:12:16.440 --> 04:12:21.080]  without any torture thirdly this is beyond the pale again you have
[04:12:21.080 --> 04:12:25.880]  distortion denial deception and the denigration of the american public
[04:12:25.880 --> 04:12:29.240]  and its intelligence and it can't come out trevor your final point and then
[04:12:29.240 --> 04:12:32.680]  we're going to end it the final point is we've had enough
[04:12:32.680 --> 04:12:36.680]  let's ask for a new way of government a new government sure new people to run
[04:12:36.680 --> 04:12:40.840]  it trevor you had one more point people yeah i i was gonna say you know the
[04:12:40.840 --> 04:12:45.000]  the um the when i first heard it it was a mass hysteria
[04:12:45.000 --> 04:12:48.520]  and i told my girlfriend uh the exact same thing this is just going to
[04:12:48.520 --> 04:12:51.800]  justify war and torture and more war and more torture
[04:12:51.800 --> 04:12:55.000]  and i'm already seen it on twitter and facebook with people saying
[04:12:55.000 --> 04:12:58.760]  um if it wasn't for information from quick tonimo bay none of this would have
[04:12:58.760 --> 04:13:01.960]  been or rah rah rah i don't know but that's all i have to say thank you for
[04:13:01.960 --> 04:13:05.480]  the opportunity to speak about tonimo wasn't effective a lot of them shouldn't
[04:13:05.480 --> 04:13:09.080]  be there a lot of them were not even criminals the whole thing is that is it
[04:13:09.080 --> 04:13:13.240]  is a farce this war against terrorism is a total farce because it starts with a
[04:13:13.240 --> 04:13:17.480]  farce of 9 11 it starts with a body that never existed or some of that
[04:13:17.480 --> 04:13:22.280]  lot so you have one endless perception so let's get back to the real issue
[04:13:22.280 --> 04:13:26.360]  we need new people new um america which stands up for itself
[04:13:26.360 --> 04:13:29.320]  and a new government without any of this nonsense that's right
[04:13:29.320 --> 04:13:32.600]  shouldn't be found we had enough the system's trying to give us their
