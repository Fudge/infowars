[00:00.000 --> 00:24.180]  In the words of England's Prince of Paradox, G.K. Chesterton, the whole point of the eugenics
[00:24.180 --> 00:29.680]  pseudo-scientific theories is that they are to be applied wholesale by some more sweeping
[00:29.680 --> 00:36.880]  and generalizing money power than the individual husband or wife or household. Eugenics asserts
[00:36.880 --> 00:43.360]  that all men must be so stupid that they cannot manage their own affairs and also so clever
[00:43.360 --> 00:48.640]  that they can manage each other's. Tyranny was merely unleashed by the jab of a syringe
[00:48.640 --> 00:58.320]  extinguishing the natural rights of a now crippled and disenfranchised populace. Dr.
[00:58.320 --> 01:05.040]  Fauci should be seen for who he truly is, a tyrannical eugenicist twisting your own free
[01:05.040 --> 01:08.720]  will against you. You don't think Americans' liberties have been threatened the last year,
[01:08.720 --> 01:13.400]  Dr. Fauci? They've been assaulted. They're liberties have. I don't look at this as a
[01:13.400 --> 01:19.080]  liberty thing, Congressman Jordan. Well, that's obvious. But it is only those liberties that
[01:19.080 --> 01:25.360]  will deliver us from the clutches of the fourth industrial revolution as CRISPR gene modification
[01:25.360 --> 01:32.560]  technology, AI, and technocracy intend on slowly rendering all of humanity a slave population
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.640]  utilizing silent weapons for quiet wars circumventing the laws of governments worldwide. If you
[01:38.640 --> 01:45.960]  take a genetic editing, just as an example, it's you who are changed. And of course, this
[01:45.960 --> 01:53.760]  has a big impact on your identity. There is a fear that technology, robots, just to take
[01:53.760 --> 02:02.760]  one. You get positivity from machines. Exactly. And it replaces maybe the workforce or jobs
[02:02.760 --> 02:09.440]  that are faster than we can replace them with new jobs. Not everybody can be a robot polish
[02:09.440 --> 02:16.760]  up. It will be new jobs. The populace feels the weight of suicide rates rising among teenagers,
[02:16.760 --> 02:22.760]  a rate that has increased by 51%. No matter how many children the police tear gas for merely
[02:22.760 --> 02:28.360]  holding a sign up complaining that they want to play outside, no matter how hard the medical
[02:28.360 --> 02:35.360]  overlords demonize how the unvaccinated choose to treat themselves with small doses of ivermectin,
[02:35.360 --> 02:40.760]  for instance, and as early treatment medications and therapies become the norm with exponential
[02:40.760 --> 02:46.940]  victories, the public actually gets healthier, stronger, and becomes acutely aware of their
[02:46.940 --> 02:52.240]  own freedoms rather than the mandates of despots. If you do it early, I mean, you just
[02:52.240 --> 02:56.600]  talk to some of the people going through these sites across the state. They will say 24,
[02:56.600 --> 03:02.440]  48 hours, a lot of their symptoms have been resolved. Can the antibodies from Lamas help
[03:02.440 --> 03:09.320]  the fight against COVID? And the answer may be yes. Lamas have a particular kind of second
[03:09.320 --> 03:14.560]  kind of antibody as compared to humans, for example. They're called heavy chain only antibodies,
[03:14.560 --> 03:18.800]  so they're much more simple. The researchers also say that their early studies have shown
[03:18.800 --> 03:23.600]  effectiveness against several variants of the disease, including the highly infectious
[03:23.600 --> 03:29.920]  delta variant. A spin off of the biotech center called Xovir says it could be a game changer
[03:29.920 --> 03:36.720]  if successful. A study from June 2020 showed effectiveness in the lab in the reduction
[03:36.720 --> 03:43.080]  of SARS-CoV-2 virus in ivermectin treated cells compared to control samples, indicating
[03:43.080 --> 03:49.160]  that ivermectin treatment resulted in the elimination of all evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus
[03:49.160 --> 03:54.680]  by 48 hours. And as the Associated Press reports, top U.S. professional groups for
[03:54.680 --> 04:01.160]  doctors and pharmacists appealed for an immediate end to the drug's use outside of research.
[04:01.160 --> 04:08.720]  The real resistance will surge as early treatment options are eliminated. I demand an apology
[04:08.720 --> 04:13.120]  from the media, talk about CNN, CNN, BCN, all the like New York Times and all those
[04:13.120 --> 04:17.520]  people that called me crazy from Hollywood. I mean, from people that have sat there and
[04:17.520 --> 04:21.560]  made videos calling me crazy. When I said address the cocaine works and we should not
[04:21.560 --> 04:26.120]  allow people to die, now you have all these studies that are saying it works. What about
[04:26.120 --> 04:30.440]  the 500,000 plus people that have died? Who is going to be responsible for them?
[04:30.440 --> 04:35.960]  All has been revealed. The sun is already setting on the socialist insurgence of medical
[04:35.960 --> 04:41.880]  tyranny of all the free people of planet earth. All you need to do is to stop complying.
[04:41.880 --> 04:47.880]  Now, the only thing that has ever introduced tyranny in any country, any time through history,
[04:47.880 --> 04:53.560]  is the failure of order follows to disobey illegal and corrupt commands. That's the
[04:53.560 --> 05:00.360]  only thing that has ever brought you back.
[05:00.360 --> 05:05.000]  Just a week ago we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock and it was
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.880]  only half of the order we wanted to get. But because we won't cut corners on the quality
[05:09.880 --> 05:14.360]  of what goes into it, the factory can only get limited supply. So again, it was half
[05:14.360 --> 05:19.440]  the order we wanted. But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off so everybody
[05:19.440 --> 05:23.200]  on the fence will get it. It's critical for your immune system and your whole body. All

[06:05.120 --> 06:14.160]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[06:14.160 --> 06:28.600]  you are the resistance. From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting
[06:28.600 --> 06:42.120]  worldwide AIDS Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live
[06:42.120 --> 06:48.680]  September 6, 2021 worldwide transmission. We're only here because of your support and
[06:48.680 --> 06:53.880]  your prayers. Thank you so much. All right. To say that today's broadcast is going to
[06:53.880 --> 07:02.960]  be an absolute overload is, again, not being strong enough. I mean, this is just going
[07:02.960 --> 07:09.440]  to be one hell of a broadcast. The news and information we've got is just over the top.
[07:09.440 --> 07:18.000]  And Dr. Peter McCullough will also be joining us in studio. Well-known doctor and academic
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.240]  from Dallas has been very critical of the whole COVID tyranny rollout, the McCullough report.
[07:24.240 --> 07:29.040]  He will be in studio with us for an hour and a half today, in the third hour and halfway
[07:29.040 --> 07:36.480]  into the fourth hour. Now, I could sit here and talk about all the U.S. citizens still
[07:36.480 --> 07:41.520]  stranded in Afghanistan. And now Trump was right last week when he said that Biden wasn't
[07:41.520 --> 07:50.640]  letting him leave. That has now been confirmed. And I could talk about the largest satanic
[07:50.640 --> 07:57.080]  organization in the U.S., the satanic temple that lobbies in all 50 states, puts out major
[07:57.080 --> 08:03.040]  movies, saying, yes, when we abort babies, it's a human sacrifice. And it's our religious
[08:03.040 --> 08:07.200]  right that violates the First Amendment. And I told you, I've been around these people
[08:07.200 --> 08:12.680]  in person. I've protested in mortuaries. And the satanists come out, the doctors come out,
[08:12.680 --> 08:16.800]  and they tell you, they're satanists. And their private lives, a lot of them are satanists.
[08:16.800 --> 08:24.600]  So that's coming out. And I will cover all of that today. We also have Arizona State
[08:24.600 --> 08:31.480]  Senator Wendy Rogers says the audit is coming, guys. I promise you, this is real, keep the
[08:31.480 --> 08:42.560]  faith. Or Jim Acosta saying that conservatives and nationalists are Taliban and are terrorists.
[08:42.560 --> 08:46.600]  And that talking point is being put out by Biden. It's being put out by his other surrogates,
[08:46.600 --> 08:50.360]  Michael Moore, and where that's going into the future as they shift away from trying
[08:50.360 --> 08:55.320]  to counter radical Islamic terror to the American people.
[08:55.320 --> 08:58.520]  I could talk about all of that. I could talk about a really huge story I will be getting
[08:58.520 --> 09:05.840]  to today. China goes to war with the liberal world order. And this is a huge story and
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.960]  it's seismic to the very core of humanity. So we're going to be hitting that as well.
[09:10.960 --> 09:18.560]  That's an incredibly important area. And I can talk about the Rolling Stone picking
[09:18.560 --> 09:23.400]  up the story out of Oklahoma that was planted in the national news, then put in every major
[09:23.400 --> 09:28.360]  newspaper in the world that we've looked at, from Japan to England, the London Guardian,
[09:28.360 --> 09:33.880]  the New York Times. Hospitals filled with thousands of people poisoned with liver failure
[09:33.880 --> 09:40.040]  from ivermectin, from horse dewormer. And it was a totally fake story. The doctor didn't
[09:40.040 --> 09:44.560]  work there. Not one person had come into that hospital chain that he mentioned, sick with
[09:44.560 --> 09:51.320]  ivermectin. The hospital put a press release out. And the biggest news to deal with this
[09:51.320 --> 09:57.840]  is that I said last night on there, I said, let's see if USA Today, let's see if the London
[09:57.840 --> 10:02.200]  Guardian, let's see if Rachel Maddow, let's see if Business Insider, let's see if the
[10:02.200 --> 10:09.480]  Hill, let's see if any of them retract. Rolling Stone Dick is the first to run it in print.
[10:09.480 --> 10:16.440]  They ran the hospital's press release saying he doesn't work here and no one's ever come
[10:16.440 --> 10:22.360]  in sick with that and there's no lines and there's plenty of ambulances. Now scroll down
[10:22.360 --> 10:26.640]  a little bit and we'll show the retraction on the article for TV viewers. So all that's
[10:26.640 --> 10:35.640]  going on. But the bigger story is the others aren't even retracting. Now there's a retraction.
[10:35.640 --> 10:40.280]  So what does that say? It means they're a foreign multinational globalist group engaged
[10:40.280 --> 10:48.960]  in war with you, engaged in trying to deceive you. They're on the deceivers team. We'll go
[10:48.960 --> 10:55.560]  over all of that today and give you the news behind the nose. The rest of the story is
[10:55.560 --> 11:09.440]  Paul Harvey would say, or as I would say in full wars, tomorrow's news today or the history
[11:09.440 --> 11:22.320]  of the future now. But what do I want to hit first right up front in the next segment?
[11:22.320 --> 11:30.880]  I was sent by a family friend, an old family friend, an extraordinary story from an extraordinary
[11:30.880 --> 11:36.920]  organization on mass psychosis. And I watched the 21 minute report and I have to say this
[11:36.920 --> 11:43.400]  is the best work in totality of what we face that I've ever seen in one piece. And I just
[11:43.400 --> 11:50.320]  really am blown away by the group called After School SKOOL. I've seen some of their other
[11:50.320 --> 11:56.760]  reports as well. But then I thought I'd pull some of the history of this. Is mass psychosis
[11:56.760 --> 12:04.280]  the greatest threat to humanity? Mass psychosis is the most visible explanation for what we're
[12:04.280 --> 12:08.480]  seeing in America today and the world. But I want to explain that it was even in the
[12:08.480 --> 12:16.480]  WikiLeaks that Hillary said we are going to trigger mass psychosis. So they're doing it
[12:16.480 --> 12:20.400]  and that's why the statistics, in fact, it was in a couple of days ago stacked. But you
[12:20.400 --> 12:24.360]  repulled me a bunch of articles about the left being the most mentally ill in all the studies
[12:24.360 --> 12:32.880]  because they've bought into a false reality and they're involved in a mass psychosis.
[12:32.880 --> 12:36.640]  And that's why they are lying because they believe they're the elite and it's for our
[12:36.640 --> 12:40.560]  own good. But when you tell lies, you start believing them yourself. And so I'm going
[12:40.560 --> 12:44.000]  to explain how they're trying to recreate. We can put the full show headline up in a
[12:44.000 --> 12:50.280]  moment. How they're trying to recreate a global French revolution on a mass scale. And that
[12:50.280 --> 12:56.240]  was primitive psychologist, the Jacobins, the Illuminati. That's in the history books,
[12:56.240 --> 13:00.920]  by the way, that's a real group. Adam Weissop out of Germany weren't trying to overthrow
[13:00.920 --> 13:09.360]  the royals of the church to get rid of a hierarchy they wanted to be. The hierarchy they wanted
[13:09.360 --> 13:19.360]  to be in full and total absolute control and actually overturn reality and turning the
[13:19.360 --> 13:26.600]  public into a giant subclass. There it is. Monday Live, globalist behavioral psychologists
[13:26.600 --> 13:37.200]  are purposely invoking mass psychosis. Mass psychosis. Social engineers, the great reset,
[13:37.200 --> 13:42.440]  are purposely destabilizing the planet who launched a worldwide French Revolution 2.0
[13:42.440 --> 13:47.760]  to collapse civilization, which was the plan of the French Revolution. They didn't want
[13:47.760 --> 13:51.960]  the general public to have civilization. They said we're going to build little subcastle
[13:51.960 --> 13:57.280]  cities that have all the technology and then no one else will have it outside. So we're
[13:57.280 --> 14:03.360]  going to explain the world they're building. They are the offspring, the physical genetic
[14:03.360 --> 14:08.200]  offspring and also the spiritual offspring. They are of the lineage of the satanic great
[14:08.200 --> 14:14.800]  reset. We're going to also hit the fact that the Taliban has always worked for the US government,
[14:14.800 --> 14:19.280]  the criminals, the US government. That's coming up as well.
[14:19.280 --> 14:26.840]  Separately, we are going to have to end the sale on all the products we've had on sale
[14:26.840 --> 14:31.720]  except for vitamin mineral fusion and it's going to sell out the next week and a half.
[14:31.720 --> 14:34.840]  It's all the vitamins, all the minerals that are essential, so good for your immune system
[14:34.840 --> 14:38.440]  with a bunch of key amino acids that are better upload, plus it's a powder. You put it into
[14:38.440 --> 14:42.960]  water that makes it delicious, tasty, natural organic fruit punch, great for children, great
[14:42.960 --> 14:47.680]  for adults, essential for everybody, but really important for old folks whose guts don't absorb
[14:47.680 --> 14:54.720]  much with the pills. We're going to keep it on sale until it sells out, but everything
[14:54.720 --> 14:59.400]  else we're not getting in for so long that I'm going to have to just take off sale this
[14:59.400 --> 15:05.000]  weekend, pollen block, 40% off, living defense, 40% off, ultimate krill oil, 40% off, vaso
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.920]  beats, 50% off, hair and beard support, the newest addition, Info Wars, life. It's also
[15:09.920 --> 15:13.280]  a great multi-vitamin mineral. I'm going to keep that at 52. We've got a good amount
[15:13.280 --> 15:19.200]  of that, but those are at InfoWarsStore.com. I want to thank you all for your support.
[15:19.200 --> 15:22.800]  Everything we've been able to do has been because of you spreading the word, you praying
[15:22.800 --> 15:27.560]  for us and you buying the products. You know who you are all across the country, all across
[15:27.560 --> 15:32.000]  the world. I know it's hard to get the stuff in Canada or overseas, but you still do it.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.720]  You jump through the hoop, so thank you so much. We wouldn't be here without you. So

[17:58.480 --> 18:05.360]  In late August, info or saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that
[18:05.360 --> 18:11.580]  the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[18:11.580 --> 18:16.800]  and financial collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been
[18:16.800 --> 18:20.480]  something that's important to have. It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking
[18:20.480 --> 18:25.720]  care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[18:25.720 --> 18:30.000]  But now, more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in. Now, we're ready
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.720]  to ship to you within 24 hours of your order. It's high quality. It's very, very low cost

[18:40.280 --> 18:44.360]  you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place. So lock in
[18:44.360 --> 18:50.200]  your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infoorstore.com. That's

[18:57.200 --> 19:03.440]  Do you think it's a bad trait of Mike Lindell that he's so optimistic that he's so positive?
[19:03.440 --> 19:08.120]  No. It's that type of optimism that built this country. We would have never defeated
[19:08.120 --> 19:12.720]  the British 250 years ago if we didn't have a lot of optimism and we didn't persevere.
[19:12.720 --> 19:17.120]  George Washington lost most of his major battles that he kept fighting for six years
[19:17.120 --> 19:21.600]  and finally we won. Well, Mike Lindell has been fighting as a man in the arena and he's
[19:21.600 --> 19:26.280]  continuing to expose serious issues with the 2020 election. We need to keep him in the
[19:26.280 --> 19:30.880]  fight. Plus, he's got hundreds of incredible, made in American products, not just pillows,

[19:47.440 --> 19:51.240]  millions of people when you just support it and support info awards at the same time

[20:26.440 --> 20:34.440]  Well, I always knew the globalists were going to use the threat of a virus to collapse the
[20:34.440 --> 20:39.880]  world economy, make us all carry smartphones to track our every movement and then bring
[20:39.880 --> 20:45.480]  in a carbon tax calorie counting system that doesn't just track everywhere you go. It tells
[20:45.480 --> 20:49.520]  you when you can get in a car, when you can drive, where you can go, who you can visit,
[20:49.520 --> 20:56.160]  what type of job you can have. I mean, just hellish level of control. And then they're
[20:56.160 --> 21:00.920]  going to organize the people that do opt into it and do a mob of people that hate those
[21:00.920 --> 21:06.040]  of us that aren't part of it, claiming that because we didn't join the authoritarianism,
[21:06.040 --> 21:10.080]  that's why they're sick. That's why they're starving. That's why they're dying. And as
[21:10.080 --> 21:14.200]  the tyranny gets worse and worse and worse, by the time the sheep wake up, they're already
[21:14.200 --> 21:20.200]  basically in the gulag. That's how this process works. And of course, those that lower the
[21:20.200 --> 21:24.280]  drawbridge to tyranny, those that help bring in the oppression, they always think they're
[21:24.280 --> 21:29.520]  going to get some cush job in the new utopia, the new dystopia where they enslave everybody.
[21:29.520 --> 21:36.400]  But then those that are the operatives that betray the nation are always the first people
[21:36.400 --> 21:45.640]  either executed or sent the slave labor. This is an extremely formulaic system that the
[21:45.640 --> 21:50.520]  globalists are carrying out. And if you read the WikiLeaks and you see what they're doing
[21:50.520 --> 21:55.960]  and you look at the Yale and Harvard reports, how years ago they studied how to use a pandemic
[21:55.960 --> 22:03.360]  to create fear and to create a post-industrial world. And I actually have a stack of news
[22:03.360 --> 22:14.200]  here where the Journal of Nature has come out, and I'll be covering this next hour, and said,
[22:14.200 --> 22:20.200]  yes, we are going to use the COVID lockdowns now to bring in not climate lockdowns every
[22:20.200 --> 22:24.960]  two years, but every month. See, they always announce something that is horrible but sounds
[22:24.960 --> 22:30.000]  not as bad. Oh, climate lockdowns every two years. I'll sit at home and watch Netflix.
[22:30.000 --> 22:35.320]  All production goes down. But now they're like, oh, actually, it'll be every month. And then,
[22:35.320 --> 22:40.400]  oh, actually, it's going to be what the smartphone says you can do. That's all officially been
[22:40.400 --> 22:45.760]  announced by Australia, by Canada, by the UN. Next segment, I've got clips of them announcing
[22:45.760 --> 22:50.960]  it. I've played for you children's cartoons from 11 years ago in the UK, saying in the
[22:50.960 --> 22:55.160]  future your smartphone will say what job you have. When you can go outside, you'll get
[22:55.160 --> 22:59.000]  meat once a year. And people would look at that and think this is a joke, Alex, back
[22:59.000 --> 23:04.240]  when I aired it 11 years ago. The Plandopolis isn't real, put out by the UN and the Rockefeller
[23:04.240 --> 23:08.440]  Foundation. Because back then, I mean, come on, we're not going to stay in our houses
[23:08.440 --> 23:12.480]  and have smartphones tell us what to do. But Australia is now implementing it. They're
[23:12.480 --> 23:17.840]  the beta test. And New York has already implemented the apps on phones that are now saying, oh,
[23:17.840 --> 23:23.040]  your paper cards aren't good enough. You got to have the Excelsior pass. England's announced
[23:23.040 --> 23:30.240]  it's in, starting this month, a few days. So it isn't coming. It's here now. You don't
[23:30.240 --> 23:34.160]  need me to tell you 20 years ago or 10 years ago, and you've seen those videos where I
[23:34.160 --> 23:42.160]  say word for word what's coming because it's a plan. It's a program. So here it is.
[23:42.160 --> 23:47.800]  An excellent piece. Mass psychosis at the end of the broadcast today. It's 20 minutes
[23:47.800 --> 23:51.640]  long. I'm going to air it. We're going to have it posted under the live show feed today
[23:51.640 --> 23:59.160]  at infowars.com. The masses have never thirsted after truth. They turn aside from evidence
[23:59.160 --> 24:07.560]  that is not to their taste, preferring to defer error. To defy error, give error, seduces
[24:07.560 --> 24:17.200]  them. We're going to play some of that report coming up. But the issue here is that they
[24:17.200 --> 24:22.240]  said stay at home, watch Netflix for 15 days to flatten the curve. Come on. It's a vacation.
[24:22.240 --> 24:29.240]  Be lazy. And as soon as you accepted that, boom, the mask of the symbol of slavery, then
[24:29.240 --> 24:32.800]  the shots come in. I said, hey, they plan to give you 10 shots a year. Here's the Rockefeller
[24:32.800 --> 24:39.640]  document. That's ridiculous. It's only two. Now they announced this week 10 shots. Israel
[24:39.640 --> 24:46.280]  said five shots last week, 10 shots today. I have the articles. It's all a blueprint.
[24:46.280 --> 24:51.760]  It's all a plan. And again, do you set a bear trap up just to hurt a bear's foot? No, you
[24:51.760 --> 24:57.680]  set it up so it clamps down. You're in a cabin, you know, a quarter mile away. You hear the
[24:57.680 --> 25:03.520]  bell dinging because you also put a big cowbell on it. You hear the banging and the, oh, the
[25:03.520 --> 25:08.560]  bear is caught. You then walk up and shoot the bear or the rifle from 50 yards away.
[25:08.560 --> 25:13.800]  We're now in the bear trap. And if you think sticking your foot in another bear trap is
[25:13.800 --> 25:17.320]  going to help you, you're wrong. We're going to have to collectively get our foot out of
[25:17.320 --> 25:27.320]  the bear trap. And if we don't do it, God help us. So behavioral psychologists and psychiatrists
[25:27.320 --> 25:36.240]  admittedly run this whole thing and they brag about it. And so during the French Revolution,
[25:36.240 --> 25:41.920]  the Jacobin group, which was run by the Illuminati, this is in mainline history books, they went
[25:41.920 --> 25:44.920]  to a nine day work week. They were going to abolish the family. They were going to quill
[25:44.920 --> 25:49.520]  back the primitive times. They themselves were going to live in castles with high technology
[25:49.520 --> 25:53.720]  but keep everybody at a dumb down surf level. They had a plan that the general public would
[25:53.720 --> 25:59.160]  be reduced to animals and not be allowed to learn how to speak or you would be killed.
[25:59.160 --> 26:03.000]  You see Pol Pot killing folks that had a first grade education or wearing glasses. If you
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.200]  had glasses, that was the sign that you were an elitist.
[26:06.200 --> 26:11.440]  This is all an extension of the Jacobins, the French Revolution that grew into the Red
[26:11.440 --> 26:19.320]  Terror with Lenin, Stalin and Mao Zedong and Pol Pot, the El Castro, the rest is history.
[26:19.320 --> 26:24.680]  They destroy civilization for you. They live on a hill with electricity and caviar. You
[26:24.680 --> 26:32.120]  live in a mud hut. And so there's some articles you can read about this. Is a mass psychosis
[26:32.120 --> 26:40.080]  the greatest threat to humanity? Carl Jung on mass psychosis. Mass psychosis is the most
[26:40.080 --> 26:49.320]  visible explanation for what we're seeing in America today. Mass psychogenic illness
[26:49.320 --> 26:57.920]  is the technical name for it. Mass psychosis. New York Times confirms a liberal mass called
[26:57.920 --> 27:06.880]  us here to stay and it's part of the mass psychosis. Mass madness in the depth of science.
[27:06.880 --> 27:12.560]  And so if you get enough followers to get in the habit of being lied to and reward them
[27:12.560 --> 27:19.080]  for lying and reward them for going along with fantasies, perception becomes reality.
[27:19.080 --> 27:25.400]  Now again, if you have the perception you can fly an airplane, but you never even flown
[27:25.400 --> 27:29.560]  a simulator and you go and push the throttle down and are going 100 miles an hour on the
[27:29.560 --> 27:34.800]  tarmac, you're probably going to die. The perception you can fly a plane is not real.
[27:34.800 --> 27:38.840]  The perception that you know how to climb a mountain, but you've never actually rock
[27:38.840 --> 27:42.880]  climbed. So you climb up a face 50 feet and fall off and kill yourself. That's your perception
[27:42.880 --> 27:47.440]  you're a rock climber is not true. Your perception you're a heavyweight boxer. So you can get
[27:47.440 --> 27:52.120]  in the ring with the current heavyweight champion is not true. You're going to get your ass kicked.
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.480]  If you're on five hits of LSD and think you're a butterfly and jump off a 20 story building,
[27:56.480 --> 28:03.720]  you're going to die. Even if your perception is you're flying. But they've created this
[28:03.720 --> 28:11.640]  perception and now people are disconnected from reality and they think they can argue
[28:11.640 --> 28:19.000]  or create their own psychotic break to believe whatever they want to believe that a man can
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.480]  have a baby. But then when Jen Psaki says, Hey, don't you bring up abortion if you're
[28:23.480 --> 28:29.280]  a man? Men can't have babies. Then it's okay when she says it. See, or oh, we're going to
[28:29.280 --> 28:35.880]  have convicted sex offenders in your elementary school girls shower for sports. That's normal
[28:35.880 --> 28:40.400]  that that's gaslighting. You know that's not true. But a lot of people that aren't leaders,
[28:40.400 --> 28:45.840]  you do that to them. They have mass psychosis. Then they organize the mass psychosis group
[28:45.840 --> 28:49.520]  like the French Revolution to go kill the middle class. And that's what the mega banks
[28:49.520 --> 28:55.360]  offshore in Fiji in places like Larry Page are preparing for us a mass culling and collapse
[28:55.360 --> 29:01.280]  society. Hey, everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture. Me too.
[29:01.280 --> 29:05.640]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[29:05.640 --> 29:10.440]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on. It's that immune system health can literally
[29:10.440 --> 29:14.960]  be the difference between life and death. You probably already believe that I certainly
[29:14.960 --> 29:19.960]  do. So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based
[29:19.960 --> 29:25.720]  substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support. Now you'll
[29:25.720 --> 29:30.840]  have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefense.com.
[29:30.840 --> 29:35.840]  No cures or treatments there. Instead, little known, but shocking immune system research
[29:35.840 --> 29:41.360]  and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called immune 10 X.

[29:45.280 --> 29:50.480]  supply of immune 10 X without paying anything today. Crazy, right? Learn more about this

[29:57.000 --> 30:02.280]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists. I wanted
[30:02.280 --> 30:07.680]  to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[30:07.680 --> 30:12.520]  before they went operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're
[30:12.520 --> 30:19.080]  not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[30:19.080 --> 30:23.920]  great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[30:23.920 --> 30:28.000]  tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  the truth. So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.640]  We've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is
[30:35.640 --> 30:39.360]  high quality, horrible food. We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable
[30:39.360 --> 30:44.480]  prices at infowarstore.com. So whether it's a month or six months or a year supply or

[31:57.560 --> 32:04.480]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class, not
[32:04.480 --> 32:10.880]  in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere. Is there a real
[32:10.880 --> 32:16.680]  study of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by design. The large central banks that
[32:16.680 --> 32:22.600]  basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into, say,
[32:22.600 --> 32:26.800]  the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the trilateral commission,
[32:26.800 --> 32:31.680]  the United Nations, the whole project of the Ross Charles and the Rockwells. Until ten
[32:31.680 --> 32:36.520]  years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg group, didn't exist.
[32:36.520 --> 32:41.480]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public. And its former head, show on the steering committee,
[32:41.480 --> 32:47.520]  is Klaus Schwab. And he has set up the great reset in global government. And as a liberty
[32:47.520 --> 32:52.160]  movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the second figure of worldwide
[32:52.160 --> 32:55.960]  authoritarian corporate takeover. We don't have a shot. We do expose them. We can beat
[32:55.960 --> 33:00.040]  them easily.
[33:00.040 --> 33:21.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.040 --> 33:48.040]  Welcome back to the most attacked line about broadcast in the world because we're on the
[33:48.040 --> 33:54.240]  enemy's tail. And we know their game. We know how to stop them. And there's a lot of other
[33:54.240 --> 33:59.640]  great people out there that think just like we do, and they aren't crawling into our graves
[33:59.640 --> 34:05.400]  and giving the planet over to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and Prince Charles. If they want
[34:05.400 --> 34:10.120]  it, they're going to have to fight for it. I tell you, Prince Charles and his long history
[34:10.120 --> 34:15.520]  with Jimmy Savelle and Jeffrey Epstein, not just his brother, it leaked last week their
[34:15.520 --> 34:22.920]  plan to make him the king of England when Queen Elizabeth dies and not Prince Charles'
[34:22.920 --> 34:29.160]  son. And Prince Charles, he must be the ruler of the earth. Prince Charles wants carbon
[34:29.160 --> 34:35.880]  taxes for us. He agrees with his father that he wants 80% of the world's population reduced.
[34:35.880 --> 34:42.560]  How about the people of the UK and the world discover that and realize what a monster that
[34:42.560 --> 34:49.560]  individual is? How about we do that? Okay, I'm going to get into the great reset and
[34:49.560 --> 34:55.760]  the global lockdown and Israel announcing, oh, actually, you're going to get five shots
[34:55.760 --> 35:00.640]  a year and maybe 10. And then now they're announcing that here. And now they're announcing
[35:00.640 --> 35:06.560]  it in Australia. We have all the videos, all the clips, all the articles. The head of the
[35:06.560 --> 35:12.840]  Australian Medical Board, Dr. Chant. COVID will be with us forever. People will have
[35:12.840 --> 35:20.000]  to get used to it and endless booster shots up to every month. That's all coming up. This
[35:20.000 --> 35:26.160]  is not a vaccine. It's a gene therapy that literally removes your immune system. And
[35:26.160 --> 35:30.280]  so now you have to rely on the synthetic injections that are obviously very poisonous
[35:30.280 --> 35:33.920]  and very toxic. And the people that have given up their immune system, they're not going
[35:33.920 --> 35:38.520]  to admit this. They like being abused. They like being deceived. And so they're going
[35:38.520 --> 35:42.720]  to come out for those of us saying they're sick because of us. I told you that almost
[35:42.720 --> 35:48.440]  two years ago when this all started, what, 19 months ago and now it's happening because
[35:48.440 --> 35:54.640]  we know their blueprint. But first, let's let's hit this. Everybody wants me to talk
[35:54.640 --> 36:01.440]  about Afghanistan. People on the street, everywhere I go, the grocery store, a restaurant, a pool
[36:01.440 --> 36:08.160]  supply store, a hiking bike trail. Hey, man, are you pissed about Afghanistan? What are
[36:08.160 --> 36:11.040]  you making this? What are you making a bike? How long is it going to be in there? And I
[36:11.040 --> 36:17.000]  just sit back and I say, you know, under Jimmy Carter and then Ronald Reagan, the CIA set
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.360]  up the Taliban. They're a very small group in Afghanistan. And they never had control
[36:21.360 --> 36:30.600]  over the maybe 10% of the country. But now 45 years later, 45 years, that's how long
[36:30.600 --> 36:35.360]  the relationship has been strong with the quote US government, whatever that thing is.
[36:35.360 --> 36:45.080]  They have the entire country under their control now, absolutely under their total control
[36:45.080 --> 36:55.560]  right now. And do you remember back in 2001, right after 9 11, the green berets and the
[36:55.560 --> 37:02.280]  navy seals in just a few weeks totally kicked the Taliban and al-Qaeda out of the country.
[37:02.280 --> 37:08.960]  But suddenly they defeated us when we had hundreds of thousands of troops. 300,000 of
[37:08.960 --> 37:19.840]  the Afghan army, tens of thousands of US. Why did that happen? Wouldn't you like to know
[37:19.840 --> 37:23.600]  why that happened? Because overhead shop, please, you had all the articles about while
[37:23.600 --> 37:33.320]  hostages are held in Afghanistan, Kamala Harris playing the campaign for Gavin Newsom. Everybody
[37:33.320 --> 37:37.360]  gets so upset. Well, let's just cut right to the heart of the matter. Instead of just
[37:37.360 --> 37:42.920]  focusing on the poison fruit, let's look at the roots. Here's a smart article out of the
[37:42.920 --> 37:49.880]  Gateway pundit. Biden effect. Taliban now controls more territory in Afghanistan today
[37:49.880 --> 38:00.400]  than they did on 9 11 20 years ago. You can look at the map here and see that they have
[38:00.400 --> 38:08.920]  now taken full and absolute control of the whole country, something they never had in
[38:08.920 --> 38:16.520]  their entire history. You know, back in the 1970s, they only had the south. They only
[38:16.520 --> 38:25.800]  had this area. But now they've got it all. And that's what they had on 9 11. They didn't
[38:25.800 --> 38:32.400]  control this zone, this zone, this area up here, your TV viewer. Always got to remember
[38:32.400 --> 38:35.680]  where some will cast some hundreds of stations. I've got to remember that a Taliban claim.
[38:35.680 --> 38:42.040]  They have seized the last resistance point in Afghanistan in the north. Now let's look
[38:42.040 --> 38:45.800]  at the facts. There's even a Wikipedia on this. I don't just always remember or believe
[38:45.800 --> 38:50.440]  Wikipedia, but you can follow the links to London Guardian, other places that did reports
[38:50.440 --> 38:58.240]  on at the time. The Kunduz airlift, more than 30,000 Taliban and al Qaeda leaders who were
[38:58.240 --> 39:10.320]  bottled up in the north were flown out into Pakistan, out into Pakistan. Our military,
[39:10.320 --> 39:17.760]  you see, the Taliban made on average 14 year olds and younger and older, but on average
[39:17.760 --> 39:26.000]  14 was the number around Kabul and other areas go out in lines of defenses while they evacuated.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.800]  So one group of the US government, the CIA, flew them out to safety and then the Green
[39:31.800 --> 39:36.040]  Berets needed somebody to kill. And they actually thought they were taking out al Qaeda and ISIS,
[39:36.040 --> 39:39.720]  ISIS came along later out of al Qaeda. They thought they were taking out the Taliban and
[39:39.720 --> 39:45.720]  al Qaeda. And really they were just killing cat and fodder, 14 year old sex toys of the
[39:45.720 --> 39:50.240]  pedophile army that is the Taliban and al Qaeda. And I'm serious, they actually left their
[39:50.240 --> 39:57.320]  sex toys with weapons in five foot deep trenches and then they all got killed. And then later,
[39:57.320 --> 40:01.000]  this is a long relationship, Saudi Arabia and the criminal US government, it's not our
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.240]  government, it's a criminal group, running it. They've always been with them. They protected
[40:06.240 --> 40:11.440]  them on 9 11. They protected them after they protected them ever since. And now they've
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.280]  turned the country back over to them now that they've given them a big infrastructure and
[40:15.280 --> 40:22.400]  invested $2 trillion plus an $80 billion in weapons. Now the Taliban said we work with
[40:22.400 --> 40:26.720]  China and we're now going to put in all the Chinese businesses and they can have all the
[40:26.720 --> 40:32.880]  rare earth minerals worth $7 trillion. So all we were doing was building the Belt and
[40:32.880 --> 40:40.480]  Road Initiative for the Chinese. And now it's supposed to be the end of the American century.
[40:40.480 --> 40:45.840]  We hand the keys for the Chinese century over to them. And you notice now that that's happened,
[40:45.840 --> 40:49.240]  China double crossed the left and said we're not going to work with you. We're going to
[40:49.240 --> 40:53.800]  have three children while you kill your children and we're not going to have the feminization
[40:53.800 --> 40:58.200]  of men and we're going to basically ban video games. We're going to basically ban porn and
[40:58.200 --> 41:04.080]  we're going to become 1950s America and we're going to be quasi free market but fascist
[41:04.080 --> 41:09.240]  and just kill Christians, Muslims and Buddhists in slave camps. But for the rest of our people,
[41:09.240 --> 41:16.120]  we're going to colonize you and take over the world. And that's actually in the news today.
[41:16.120 --> 41:21.360]  And so you've got the leftist academics here in their shrinking empire that they believe
[41:21.360 --> 41:25.440]  they were going to have worldwide. But the whole time that was always meant to just weaken
[41:25.440 --> 41:30.200]  the U.S. and collapse it wasn't supposed to be an ideology that actually took the planet
[41:30.200 --> 41:37.120]  over. And so Europe has been taught to be very passive. The men have been taught to
[41:37.120 --> 41:42.680]  be very, very weak-need. The women have been taught to not trust their men or their families
[41:42.680 --> 41:49.360]  or not even have families. And so we've been set up like an old rotting structure when
[41:49.360 --> 41:53.080]  a tornado comes by and blows over. You can hear it creaking and part of it's already
[41:53.080 --> 41:59.760]  fallen down. And then in that process of collapse, they want to claim the collapse is because
[41:59.760 --> 42:04.400]  of race war, but really it's been prepared to be economic collapse. And then they're
[42:04.400 --> 42:08.280]  going to tell the middle class in the new Arish, invest in globalism, invest in the
[42:08.280 --> 42:14.600]  great reset, sign over most of your wealth to these consortiums, do what we say, become
[42:14.600 --> 42:20.680]  leaders in the new transformation and you'll be able to keep part of your position in the
[42:20.680 --> 42:26.920]  middle class, but it'll be a fascist alliance and then everybody else will be cut out of
[42:26.920 --> 42:33.160]  it. And that'll go for about 10 years and then it'll go completely Soviet style. While
[42:33.160 --> 42:38.480]  all the bankers and the big tech people own private islands in the Pacific Ocean and other
[42:38.480 --> 42:43.000]  areas and they're just going to sit back while we all kill each other and laugh about it,
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.880]  and they can just punch into millions of cameras they've got and just watch it burn and watch
[42:46.880 --> 42:52.040]  it happen. They believe from the safety of their armored fortresses. So we need a lot
[42:52.040 --> 42:53.760]  of fire to their ass so they're not safe.
[42:53.760 --> 43:00.120]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.
[43:00.120 --> 43:04.480]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[43:04.480 --> 43:08.760]  the years. It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[43:08.760 --> 43:12.920]  you, the listeners of this show. I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[43:12.920 --> 43:16.360]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter. You've got
[43:16.360 --> 43:21.160]  red blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we
[43:21.160 --> 43:26.400]  are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work
[43:26.400 --> 43:30.280]  with you over the years. And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working into the
[43:30.280 --> 43:36.160]  future. But again, that's really up to you and up to God. So please, I hope God works
[43:36.160 --> 43:40.840]  through you and puts a message in your heart to support us. But again, that's up to you
[43:40.840 --> 43:44.520]  and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support
[43:44.520 --> 43:48.440]  you've given us and what you've done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask
[43:48.440 --> 43:52.680]  what God's vision is for you and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support
[43:52.680 --> 43:54.600]  Him for worse. God bless.
[43:54.600 --> 43:59.880]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists. I wanted
[43:59.880 --> 44:05.280]  to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[44:05.280 --> 44:10.080]  before they went operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're
[44:10.080 --> 44:16.600]  not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[44:16.600 --> 44:21.440]  great respect. And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[44:21.440 --> 44:25.560]  tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[44:25.560 --> 44:26.560]  the truth.
[44:26.560 --> 44:29.880]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda. We've
[44:29.880 --> 44:33.680]  also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality

[46:58.480 --> 47:26.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:26.480 --> 47:40.720]  Thank you so much for joining us. And so I don't want to be violent to David Rockefeller's
[47:40.720 --> 47:46.960]  project. I don't be violent to Ted Turner or Prince Charles or Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab
[47:46.960 --> 47:55.080]  until they've been arrested and indicted and tried like the Nazis at Nuremberg. And that's
[47:55.080 --> 48:00.760]  not my job. My job is to expose them. When I say a lot of fire under their ass, we need
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.560]  protest at their houses. We need protest at their corporations. We need to go to Fiji
[48:05.560 --> 48:11.160]  and protest. We need to expose how they're hiding out in Kauai. We need to go protest
[48:11.160 --> 48:16.000]  at Mark Zuckerberg's house because these people are out of control. You know, I went
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.520]  in front of Sundar Pichai about selling out the kindness of China to his face. So I don't
[48:20.520 --> 48:27.480]  need to just talk to talk. I walk the walk and it's exhilarating. But that said, let
[48:27.480 --> 48:33.440]  me address something. Last week, I said, where is Senator Paul? Where is Senator Holly? Where
[48:33.440 --> 48:40.960]  is Senator Cruz? Where is Senator Cotton? Where is Ron DeSantis? Where is Trump? They
[48:40.960 --> 48:46.920]  need to address Operation Lockstep that is the policy of the U.S. government and the
[48:46.920 --> 48:53.160]  COVID tyranny rollout. They need to address Event 201. They need to address Crimson contagion.
[48:53.160 --> 49:02.520]  They need to address SPARS 2325. They need to address the Great Reset Documents. I mean,
[49:02.520 --> 49:09.400]  you got Crado and you've got all these other world leaders saying build back better. You
[49:09.400 --> 49:14.000]  got Nancy Pelosi saying build back better. That's the Great Reset to shut down the regular
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.280]  economy and force you onto their new economy and start the third world and then organize
[49:18.280 --> 49:26.280]  the third world to invade us. Kettler wrote Mein Kampf when he was in prison in what, like
[49:26.280 --> 49:34.760]  1929 or something? I forget. You look it up. Then he came to power in Germany in 1933.
[49:34.760 --> 49:37.760]  And people didn't really pay attention to him saying I'm going to invade and attack the
[49:37.760 --> 49:42.960]  Russians and attack everybody in his book. But once he invaded people in 1940, people
[49:42.960 --> 49:48.000]  paid attention. So it's one thing to ignore the Great Reset and Operation Lockstep from
[49:48.000 --> 49:56.240]  the U.N. and the globalist when it was theoretical. But the big megabanks and the Fortune 100
[49:56.240 --> 50:02.240]  are on TV. I played all the clips last month saying this is a post-industrial world. We're
[50:02.240 --> 50:07.080]  cutting off your resources. We're involved in a hostile takeover of democracies and we're
[50:07.080 --> 50:11.440]  capturing countries and we're in control. I mean, that's on the Davos Groups website.
[50:11.440 --> 50:17.440]  That's on Klaus Schwab's Wikipedia. So they're declaring we've seized control of big tech.
[50:17.440 --> 50:21.840]  We've got control of big pharma. We're taking over with a medical ID that will be a carbon
[50:21.840 --> 50:26.960]  ID that will tax everywhere you go and track what you do. And then now it's being implemented
[50:26.960 --> 50:33.160]  and you could hear a pin drop. Mark Moreno over at Climate Depot pointed out, maybe we
[50:33.160 --> 50:38.720]  could pull the document up on Friday that the Journal of Nature and the U.S. government
[50:38.720 --> 50:42.800]  came out and called for your smart phones to track everywhere you go and have carbon
[50:42.800 --> 50:50.080]  taxes and Trudella announced it last week. But there's almost no resistance to completely
[50:50.080 --> 50:56.280]  illegal world corporate government. Ally with Communist China. But Communist China's
[50:56.280 --> 51:02.040]  got nuclear weapons and they bitch slapped the Anglo-American leftist arm. I got the
[51:02.040 --> 51:06.240]  article right here. China goes to war with the liberal world order. I'll cover that
[51:06.240 --> 51:09.760]  next hour. And they're saying, you know, we're going to have three or five kids. We're
[51:09.760 --> 51:15.200]  going to basically stop being communists. We're going to be totally fascist and just
[51:15.200 --> 51:18.560]  kill Christians, Buddhists and Westerners. And we're going to take the world over. We
[51:18.560 --> 51:22.760]  got the people get out of the way. You got a bunch of China files like Gates and others
[51:22.760 --> 51:27.640]  that are invested with them. So this whole leftist thing is poison in Europe and America
[51:27.640 --> 51:32.400]  and Australia to make us a bunch of the words not effeminate because it's with men acting
[51:32.400 --> 51:39.720]  like women. It's not effeminate. They're just they're acting like punks. And so this is
[51:39.720 --> 51:44.240]  a joke and the people pretending on the left, like they're part of the ruling class and
[51:44.240 --> 51:48.320]  they're in on the lying and they plant the fake stories and they put out the disenfocus.
[51:48.320 --> 51:53.720]  They're the good guys and it's for a greater good. Most of them are delusional, but a lot
[51:53.720 --> 51:56.880]  of them actually know they're just taking a paycheck. I mean, they I've seen numbers
[51:56.880 --> 52:04.640]  that the Biden administration has given money to more than 200,000 influencers. The average
[52:04.640 --> 52:21.880]  payment $5,000 over 200,000 people have been paid $5,000 on average. Some are paid hundreds
[52:21.880 --> 52:27.160]  of thousands NBA stars and like that. And NBA stars have gone public today. I was offered
[52:27.160 --> 52:34.840]  $200,000. Same number that actually bought off of people. And that's just the federal
[52:34.840 --> 52:42.160]  government. Imagine what Merck and Pfizer are doing. It's come out. They're paying people.
[52:42.160 --> 52:45.280]  Some folks are paid more than $200,000 to go out and say, I took it. It's great. You
[52:45.280 --> 52:49.840]  should take it. I wonder how much run DMC got paid to make all those rap songs about fight
[52:49.840 --> 52:54.360]  the races, fight the white races, fight the eugenics, take the shot. And it's coming literally
[52:54.360 --> 53:01.280]  from the King Daddy eugenicist Bill Gates. Now there's another report. Social media influencer
[53:01.280 --> 53:06.400]  admits being offered money for vaccines. Now they had thousands of them gone public. Good
[53:06.400 --> 53:11.320]  for them. So let me read you some of these headlines. I'm going to play some clips. Israel
[53:11.320 --> 53:16.000]  planning to administer fourth COVID jab. They just said last week, third. Now it's fourth.
[53:16.000 --> 53:20.640]  And they went, Hey, it could be up to five percent a year. It's out of the Daily Mail.
[53:20.640 --> 53:25.960]  Dr. Chant, health minister, one of the major provinces of Australia, COVID will be with
[53:25.960 --> 53:29.800]  us forever. People will have to get used to it. Chelsea says, don't go outside. Don't
[53:29.800 --> 53:33.640]  talk to your neighbors. And others there say, don't look at the sun. And by the way, you'll
[53:33.640 --> 53:39.720]  have no life if you don't take the shot shots. For scientists, past the COVID in game remains
[53:39.720 --> 53:44.760]  uncertain. Y'all know this. Oh my God. Now they're like, Oh, five shots a year. Oh, two
[53:44.760 --> 53:51.120]  pills a day. You've got to take it on your app with a face scan. They've actually announced
[53:51.120 --> 53:55.680]  in Spain and Australia that you have to take the shots now on an app. They don't even trust
[53:55.680 --> 53:59.880]  the people giving you the shot because they know folks are squirting it off to the side.
[53:59.880 --> 54:04.720]  They're pulling out, you could say. And so, oh, you got to now do it on video. See, talk
[54:04.720 --> 54:11.760]  about dystopia, but all these little soft people that grew up in a free country are now submitting.
[54:11.760 --> 54:17.040]  And yes, in Australia, in Canada, in the EU, they just announced, we showed you clips of
[54:17.040 --> 54:21.160]  people reporting it happening two weeks ago in France. They said, we're setting up 7,000
[54:21.160 --> 54:25.160]  clinics and schools, including elementary, and we're giving it without parental consent.
[54:25.160 --> 54:28.120]  And if you don't let us, we'll come arrest you, even though it's not even authorized
[54:28.120 --> 54:34.240]  for children. They're just doing it. And look at this dystopic video of your radio
[54:34.240 --> 54:39.480]  listener, go to infowars.com. There's a zero hedge article about it. RoboCop is here. Singapore
[54:39.480 --> 54:44.760]  deploys robots to detect undesirable behavior, including groups of more than five people.
[54:44.760 --> 54:52.520]  You know more than five people in your backyard or your home. You notice it's permanent. It's
[54:52.520 --> 55:01.200]  Xavier the robot. It's like a dolly from Dr. Who exterminate, exterminate. That's where
[55:01.200 --> 55:06.560]  we are. And now New York's doing it, and now London's doing it, and now Paris is doing
[55:06.560 --> 55:14.440]  it again. Watch Don Blast BBC ever declares vaccine
[55:14.440 --> 55:20.120]  passports to start this month, even though it's not the law. Canada's conservative government
[55:20.120 --> 55:25.600]  says if they win the election, they will have vaccine passports now competing with the left.
[55:25.600 --> 55:30.720]  Dear white people, National Health Service says whites are inherently evil and bad officially.
[55:30.720 --> 55:35.280]  That's Marxist Leninist division of the country while they flood it with foreigners. We'll
[55:35.280 --> 55:41.280]  be getting to that. That's just some of the stories up on infowars.com. Oregon police
[55:41.280 --> 55:49.160]  and firefighters suing governor in resistance of vaccine mandate. Unhinged teacher wearing
[55:49.160 --> 55:54.360]  a mask under their nose screams at a student wearing a mask under their nose, call student
[55:54.360 --> 56:00.200]  a piece of for not wearing the mask over the nose. That's just some of the news. But when
[56:00.200 --> 56:06.360]  I start the next hour, I'm going to play you. Leader saying don't look at the sun that said
[56:06.360 --> 56:10.600]  don't talk to your neighbors and there's going to be endless shots all over the world. Who's
[56:10.600 --> 56:15.080]  running these countries? Who who's preparing it? Well, we know the Rockefeller Foundation,
[56:15.080 --> 56:21.720]  the UN and Pfizer. It's all the same group. I'm going to go to break. I just want to remind
[56:21.720 --> 56:25.720]  listeners that Michael and Dell is one of our biggest sponsors. He's got really high
[56:25.720 --> 56:31.400]  quality sheets, pillows, towels, shoes, and he's a real fighter. He's under attack and
[56:31.400 --> 56:38.000]  it's made in America. So if you need any of these great items, these got clothes as well.

[57:49.000 --> 57:52.960]  of the order we wanted to get. But because we won't cut corners on the quality of what
[57:52.960 --> 57:57.520]  goes into it, the factory can only get limited supplies. So again, it was half the order
[57:57.520 --> 58:02.920]  we wanted. But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off so everybody on the fence will

[58:45.560 --> 58:53.000]  saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalist are destabilizing
[58:53.000 --> 58:59.440]  the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[58:59.440 --> 59:03.240]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important
[59:03.240 --> 59:07.120]  to have. It's a check box that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with

[59:40.840 --> 59:50.920]  now at info wars store.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:50.920 --> 1:00:04.400]  All right, coming up, I am going to just cover the waterfront, the incredible globalist takeover,
[1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:08.640]  how to counter it. Jim Acosta on the left saying that Trump supporters are Taliban terrorists
[1:00:08.640 --> 1:00:12.680]  while they actually back the Taliban. That's coming up start of the next segment. But Harrison
[1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:16.920]  Smith and the crew have always had a good show, great show, but it's just fabulous.
[1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:21.720]  The great guests they get every day. I'm watching almost every day or at night. If I've missed
[1:00:21.720 --> 1:00:25.960]  it weekday mornings, 8am. Here's part of a great interview they did with the manager
[1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:31.120]  at Rocco's in New York, who's been fighting back against the ongoing COVID lockdowns and
[1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:38.800]  the so-called Excelsior Pass. New York is because this is the biggest city on the planet. If
[1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:44.520]  it takes hold here, it will take hold everywhere. So I think that the reason why there's such
[1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:48.440]  a big push for this to happen on the West Coast and LA and the East Coast of New York
[1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:53.240]  City is because once it happens here, they will make sure that they will push it to the
[1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:57.720]  center of the country. This is not a fight for me. I mean, I'm very uncomfortable to
[1:00:57.720 --> 1:01:03.240]  even have a give-send go or a zeal that's up there on Instagram for people to donate
[1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:07.240]  to. They have to understand that I'm not fighting for me. I'm fighting for them. I'm fighting
[1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:10.920]  for their children. I'm fighting for the United States of America. I'm fighting to make sure
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:16.240]  that we keep our country. You need to defend your civilization against the onslaught of
[1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:21.600]  this cancer of progressivism, liberalism and globalist brainwashing. This is a life or
[1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:27.680]  death situation, no messing around. The prescription is two doses of info wars taken daily.
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:36.680]  You're watching the American Journal with your host, Harrison Smith. Watch live right
[1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:37.680]  now at banned.video.
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:43.680]  Well, back folks to American Journal, my guess, I'm very happy to have Mary Josephine
[1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:48.960]  Generoso is the manager of Rocko's, a fine dining establishment that's been making headlines
[1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:54.000]  for refusing to discriminate against unvaccinated patrons. Mary's taking a stand for your civil
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:58.360]  liberties and freedoms and needs your support. On September 13th, the city will begin issuing
[1:01:58.360 --> 1:02:03.600]  fines starting at $1,000 for the first offense, $2,000 for the second time, to indoor businesses
[1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:08.360]  that fail to ensure their venues are off limits to those who remain unvaccinated. It's imperative
[1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:11.640]  to call New York businesses and tell them you will not give them your business if they
[1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:16.640]  enforce this policy. Rocko's has a donation page to help them in the fight against tyranny
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:24.400]  at GiveSendGo.com slash Rocko's, R-O-C-C-O-S. Their Instagram is at Rocko's Pastry and
[1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:30.720]  the website Rocko's.nyc, again R-O-C-C-O-S. Very happy to have the manager of Rocko's,
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:34.120]  Mary Josephine Generoso on with me today. Thanks so much for coming on, Mary.
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:35.920]  Oh, thanks for having me.
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:40.160]  Well, I'm very happy to have you. And I love this picture from the New York Post that has
[1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:44.360]  this sign that you posted. It says, we do not discriminate against any customer based
[1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:49.040]  on sex, gender, race, creed, age, vaccinated or unvaccinated. All customers who wish to
[1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:54.000]  patronize are welcome in our establishment. What inspired you to do this and to stand
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  up against this mandate?
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:01.760]  Well, honestly, the mayor inspired me. I mean, second, he came out and said that we were
[1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:07.800]  now going to be checking people based on a vaccine. I immediately was just like, no,
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:11.600]  absolutely not. I mean, my first reaction, I think, was a little bit of despair. And
[1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:17.280]  immediately, I think five to 10 minutes after hearing him speak, that, you know, sign was
[1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:21.040]  conceived in my mind. I sent a text to my husband who was sitting right next to me and
[1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:25.920]  I'm like, what do you think? Can we make a sign that we can put up? And he was all for
[1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:33.560]  it. And here we are today. I mean, Bill de Blasio is probably the most unlike man in
[1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:38.040]  the city. I don't know anybody, even if they voted for him, who actually likes him. So
[1:03:38.040 --> 1:03:44.360]  we have one man telling restaurants what they can and cannot do. You know, New York, the
[1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:49.840]  reason why this is happening in New York is because this is the biggest city on the planet.
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:55.680]  If it takes hold here, it will take hold everywhere. So I think that the reason why there's such
[1:03:55.680 --> 1:04:00.280]  a big push for this to happen on the West Coast and LA and the East Coast, New York City,
[1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:05.000]  is because once it happens here, they will make sure that they will push it to the center
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  of the country.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.480]  You are a very powerful voice against this. And I so appreciate you coming on and speaking
[1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:13.080]  your mind because you said some really powerful stuff here today. And I hope that our audience
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:20.280]  supports you by going to givesendgo.com slash Rockos or go to your Instagram, Rockos Pastry
[1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:25.400]  or the website Rockos.nyc. And people can reach out to you there and support you there.
[1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:30.560]  Is there anything else people can do for you? Because we need people like you. And so whatever
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:34.360]  we can do to support you, I'm all in favor of it. Anything else they can do to support
[1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:35.360]  Rockos?
[1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:39.600]  I just need the audience to know that this is not a fight for me. I mean, I'm very uncomfortable
[1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:44.800]  to even have a givesendgo or, you know, a zeal that's up there on Instagram for people
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:48.520]  to donate to. They have to understand that I'm not fighting for me. I'm fighting for
[1:04:48.520 --> 1:04:53.120]  them. I'm fighting for their children. I'm fighting for the United States of America.
[1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:57.840]  I'm not funded by George Soros. I'm not funded by the Democratic Party. I'm funded by you.

[1:06:17.280 --> 1:06:29.560]  Across the world. Robots are now patrolling the streets in Tokyo, in New York, in London.
[1:06:29.560 --> 1:06:36.440]  And on your screen of your TV viewer in Singapore to make sure that groups of more than five
[1:06:36.440 --> 1:06:42.400]  or more do not get together. It marks orders at you and then takes scans of your face.
[1:06:42.400 --> 1:06:48.240]  The general public where wristbands to be able to leave their homes. This is the technocracy.
[1:06:48.240 --> 1:06:52.240]  This is the globalist creating all this fear. There's all these articles out now saying we
[1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:57.480]  must replace humans with robots because humans are dirty. They don't have restaurants in
[1:06:57.480 --> 1:07:02.760]  Austin that robots serve you. But of course, humans cook the food. It's all just ridiculous
[1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:06.580]  theater. And coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to get to the globalist master
[1:07:06.580 --> 1:07:12.160]  plan and all these new stories admitting that they're going to use COVID to train you
[1:07:12.160 --> 1:07:19.440]  for lockdowns and apps on your phone that the UN runs through a global energy council,
[1:07:19.440 --> 1:07:25.880]  global carbon council, global food council. This is all been announced. It will tell you
[1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:34.880]  how many calories and credits you get in a global social score. It is absolutely insane.
[1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:41.920]  That is coming up. But first, I wanted to hit this. Jim Acosta has come out many times
[1:07:41.920 --> 1:07:48.240]  and said that Trump and his supporters are liars. That CNN is not an enemy of the American
[1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:52.680]  people. No, they just support the end of the country. They support Antifa. They support
[1:07:52.680 --> 1:07:57.400]  lies. They support sending sick people to nursing homes to kill them in mass. They defended
[1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:04.240]  Cuomo doing that. You know the crimes of CNN run by Ted Turner, the depopulationist globalist
[1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:09.240]  that actually runs this whole thing with the late David Rockefeller Foundation along with
[1:08:09.240 --> 1:08:19.280]  Bill Gates. And so here he is with the Communist News Network. We have the clip saying leading
[1:08:19.280 --> 1:08:23.480]  figures on the far right have been sounding the alarm on Afghanistan and Iraqis all week.
[1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:28.040]  The refugees are coming. The refugees are coming, Acosta said. Yeah, bunch of them are
[1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:35.320]  terrorists. Over on Fox, human manure spreader Tucker Carlson has floated yet another race
[1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:39.480]  spading conspiracy theory that tens of thousands of Afghan refugees are being sent over this
[1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:42.800]  country in order to change the outcomes of the elections. Yeah, they're sending them
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:47.560]  all to battleground states. Look, the Somalis. Acosta claimed Trump's supporters operated
[1:08:47.560 --> 1:08:53.400]  on a combination of theocracy and thugocracy. That's the Democrats pointing to Texas based
[1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:57.480]  law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. Some members of the far right in this country
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:01.920]  have apparently decided they will resort to intimidation. And in some cases even violence
[1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:06.440]  to get what they want. No, that's the Democrats burn out cities. They could sweep into power
[1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:12.000]  faster than experts thought possible. Yeah, over your election fraud sound familiar, sort
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:16.200]  of like American Taliban, Acosta said, it's starting to look like a combination of the
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:22.200] ocracy and thugocracy. You want to say these people are the new Taliban? No, you guys are
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:28.960]  fighting the Taliban. You're the ones shipping them into the country. You're the ones protecting
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:35.600]  them and censoring people to criticize Orthodox and radical Islam. So here's Acosta. Here's
[1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:41.320]  Michael Moore saying, bring our troops home, he said two weeks ago, because we need them
[1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:45.880]  for the January six people and the insurrection is to the terrorist and all the rest of it.
[1:09:45.880 --> 1:09:50.440]  They burned down all these cities, billions of dollars of damage out of a million people
[1:09:50.440 --> 1:09:56.880]  at Trump's rally, maybe 600, 700 go in, maybe 50 are violent. And now we're all bad collectively
[1:09:56.880 --> 1:10:00.400]  and need the CIA and the FBI to come after us. You're like, well, that's just Acosta.
[1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:05.840]  That's just that's just Michael Moore. No, the official US government policy since June
[1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:12.960]  7th of 2021 is the main terror threat is the American people are those that question the
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:17.320]  elections and those that question future lockdowns that Biden would love to put in but doesn't
[1:10:17.320 --> 1:10:21.360]  have the popularity to do. There it is the national strategy for countering domestic
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:36.040]  terrorism June 2021. So this is their new talking point on every front. And we have to recognize
[1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:40.360]  that they're the globalist, they're the anti Americans, they're the outside globalist group
[1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:44.840]  with the UN with the big corporations in the great reset in Klaus Schwab's own words that
[1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:51.560]  is quote, capturing the former democracies of Europe and North America, Australia and
[1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:57.080]  Canada. They say they've captured us and the corporations now call the shots. They call
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:11:02.120]  for the lockdowns. They call for the shutdowns. And they admit it's to collapse small businesses
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:09.600]  and consolidate control. So Jim Acosta now says that we are the new Taliban because we're
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:14.520]  resisting their takeover. And you know, maybe in the end, they're right because they're
[1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:19.040]  an outside globalist force. At least the Taliban is from their country. I don't defend the
[1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:23.920]  Taliban. They're the ones working with the Taliban. But facts are facts. So let's go
[1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:29.600]  ahead and go to a, this has got to be like three years old, little promo we did of Mars
[1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:35.600]  attacks with Jim Acosta in it. And then of course, there's another one with Wolf Blitzer
[1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:39.760]  saying we're not the enemy of the American people as well with this talking point. But
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:43.760]  yeah, they are the enemies of the American people. That's why they lie to us with the
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:47.440]  fake Rolling Stone story that went everywhere that hasn't been retracted by all the other
[1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:52.680]  newspapers. Rachel Maddow, New York Times, London Guardian, still haven't retracted saying,
[1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:58.880]  Oh, thousands of the hospital there. People are dying. Gunshot wound. Pregnant women can't
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:04.160]  get in. There's no ambulances. All of it alive. Hospital group came out and said no one has
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:09.640]  been here with this poisoning. They've had nine phone calls. Nobody's sick. Asking to
[1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:14.680]  see if it was safe for them to take it at the whole poison control system in Oklahoma.
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:20.120]  All alive. Why I took the ivermectin paste type. I took actually a two double D warmers
[1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:25.200]  in it last night, but one was ivermectin on air to show you and solve your position before
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:28.600]  you do it. But these people are lying to you because they see you as the enemy. Here's
[1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:38.080]  Jim Acosta. What will we tell the Afghan refugees who just fled those schools for girls back
[1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:45.600]  in their home country? I guess the girls here will have to fill them in. Unfortunately, what
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:49.480]  we will tell them is that some members of the far right in this country have apparently
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:54.960]  decided they will resort to intimidation and in some cases even violence to get what they
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:13:03.000]  want. And they could sweep into power faster than the experts thought possible. Sound familiar?
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:10.680]  Sort of like an American Taliban. It is starting to look like a combination of theocracy and
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:20.560]  thugocracy. The leaders of this magaband movement, people like Marjorie, Madison and Tucker,
[1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:25.360]  they're not counting on an intelligence failure or a lack of planning on your part. They're
[1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:31.360]  counting on a lack of courage to stand up for your rights in this country. Is that Ring
[1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:37.800]  a Bell? The anti-immigration, anti-democratic, anti-women's rights forces have all sought
[1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:44.760]  these kinds of changes for years, even decades in this country. Their operation to change
[1:13:44.760 --> 1:13:50.520]  America forever is well underway. It's just changing in a way they don't want you to
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:55.320]  see. I'm standing in this briefing room right now. There is no government official here,
[1:13:55.320 --> 1:14:12.520]  but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people. But I'll say that the press
[1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:18.120]  is not the enemy of the people. The Press is not the enemy of the people. The Press
[1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:20.120]  is not the enemy of the people.
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:22.120]  They came in peace.
[1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:42.120]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue
[1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:44.120]  like these folks who chant CNN sucks
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:46.120]  and fake news.
[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:48.120]  Maybe we should go out, all journalists
[1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:50.120]  should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:52.120]  and chant we're not the enemy of the people.
[1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:05.120]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:07.120]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:15.120]  This is CNN.
[1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:17.120]  This is CNN.
[1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:47.120]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:17.120]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:47.120]  Simply go to handgunconversion.com
[1:16:47.120 --> 1:17:07.120]  That's handgunconversion.com

[1:17:53.440 --> 1:17:56.280]  This headline is not a joke.
[1:17:56.280 --> 1:18:00.920]  This is America in September of 2020.
[1:18:00.920 --> 1:18:01.920]  T.C.
[1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:08.120]  Court sends man to jail for watching conspiracy theory videos online.
[1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:16.680]  Yes, it says the police did a spot check for, quote, compliance at his home and found him
[1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:25.320]  in his garage watching rumble social media site, which they say is a conspiracy site.
[1:18:25.320 --> 1:18:30.320]  Also, he admitted to watching Mike Lindell's three-day cyber symposium.
[1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:33.400]  Yes, it was part of the conditions of his bail.
[1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:38.920]  The judge said he could not look at any videos questioning the election.
[1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:39.920]  No joke.
[1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:44.120]  And so they sent the stars into his house and caught him doing it, so now he's going
[1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:46.600]  into solidary confinement.
[1:18:46.600 --> 1:18:51.160]  Communism has come to America, the republic has fallen.
[1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:55.960]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[1:18:55.960 --> 1:18:58.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:03.720]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:04.720]  But we failed.
[1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:06.160]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:11.960]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:14.320]  deindustrialization great reset.
[1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:18.600]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:23.200]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:26.120]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[1:19:26.120 --> 1:19:28.320]  And we've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:19:28.320 --> 1:19:31.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, horrible food.

[1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:15.480]  to administer fourth covid vaccine which could be adjusted to fight new variants.
[1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:20.000]  Oh a new shot and of course the booster they always said a year and a half ago you would
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:24.200]  have to take then they said in their academic papers it will be 10 shots a year just for
[1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:27.920]  the cold virus and you're going to take two pills a day.
[1:21:27.920 --> 1:21:33.080]  Pfizer has now announced and government apps will watch you and make sure you do it boy
[1:21:33.080 --> 1:21:38.200]  couldn't come up with a more dystopic movie or film than that or book could you but it's
[1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:39.600]  the real world.
[1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:41.480]  Truth is worse than fiction.
[1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:46.200]  Truth is scarier than fiction and we now have Trudeau in Canada we now have the Democrats
[1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:52.000]  here in the U.S. in New York and in California and it's all coming here wherever you're at
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:59.800]  they're all announcing the vaccine passport which again is the covid control system the
[1:21:59.800 --> 1:22:09.160]  medical ID for the carbon trading system in the Journal of Nature plows swab Trudeau last
[1:22:09.160 --> 1:22:14.800]  week they all announced it and I'm going to say this again do I need to go protest at
[1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:18.920]  Senator Rand Paul's office I need to go protest at Josh Holly's office I need to go protest
[1:22:18.920 --> 1:22:24.680]  at Ted Cruz's office not that they're bad men but we know Pelosi was here in Austin
[1:22:24.680 --> 1:22:28.800]  promoting the great reset and build back better she used both those terms and said shut down
[1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:31.480]  all their business.
[1:22:31.480 --> 1:22:34.600]  She was in Austin didn't tell anybody she was coming but she was here and had a press
[1:22:34.600 --> 1:22:43.600]  conference what was it Thursday we're in her stupid mask so she's out pushing their agenda
[1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:50.720]  I mean they've announced a U.N. world carbon tax agenda saying the covid was just the beginning
[1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:56.160]  in the words of Klaus Schwab it's just the cut the groove now now we add the carbon we
[1:22:56.160 --> 1:23:02.240]  add the app for your carbon calorie will you then get permission to leave home we have
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:06.960]  captured your governments you own nothing you have nothing I mean these are folks those
[1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:14.040]  are real close you own nothing you have nothing you live in 250 square foot apartment every
[1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:20.120]  10 apartment share one bathroom you are in communal areas you own nothing you have nothing
[1:23:20.120 --> 1:23:28.480]  you eat bugs you drink swamp water and sewage water these are real close.
[1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:31.960]  Oh do not look at the sun you're not go to the sunset you're not talk to your neighbors
[1:23:31.960 --> 1:23:35.520]  oh sorry get used to it there'll be lots of shots you'll have no free unless you take
[1:23:35.520 --> 1:23:41.440]  it I mean these are freaking hostage takers trying to get us to go into mass psychosis
[1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:45.680]  mass Stockholm syndrome and have psychotic breaks because we can't handle the stress
[1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:49.600]  and just accept it and then say those of us that don't take all the shots we're the reason
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:59.200]  the people that took the shots are sick even though with the antibody dependency enhancement
[1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:07.760]  that they the scientists warned this would cause unbelievable the people perish for lack
[1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:16.640]  of knowledge so here's here's a few of these clips and the end one is new it's the premier
[1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:24.360]  New South Wales premier most popular area of Australia says when the state opens up only
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:29.360]  the vaccinated will be allowed to interact with each other the police will beat everyone
[1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:34.440]  else run them over with cars with horses I mean this ain't North Korea baby here it
[1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:35.440]  is.
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:38.280]  You know the whole bunch of people down the right back beach last night I thought the
[1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:43.080]  best thing to do is to go and watch the sunset I'm sure it was a beautiful sunset but that's
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:47.240]  not in the spirit or in or in the letter of these rules.
[1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:55.080]  But we're now watching countries like Israel see their cases surge despite high vaccination
[1:24:55.080 --> 1:25:01.160]  rates how important are boosters to maintaining this no lockdown plan and how soon we need
[1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:05.160]  to get them so that we can maintain these freedoms of being promised.
[1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:11.080]  We need to get used to being vaccinated with COVID vaccines for the future.
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:18.440]  I can't see that COVID is not going to be with us forever maybe in the future we can
[1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:21.800]  have even better vaccines and coverage across the world to achieve that.
[1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:28.680]  I mean as a public health doctor we always want to have diseases go get totally eliminated
[1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:33.800]  but that's not on the horizon in the near future so booster doses repeat doses will
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:38.920]  be part of it you know there'll be different advice about different schedules which doses
[1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:45.640]  you get but at the moment our priority has to be getting first and second doses into people
[1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:51.480]  and there will be recommendations about booster doses in the future and I can assure you that
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:58.600]  Commonwealth Government has produced has purchased a large quantities of vaccine into 2022 and this
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:05.560]  will be a regular cycle of vaccination and revaccination as we learn more about when immunity
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:13.240]  waits. Whilst it is in human nature to engage in conversation with others to be friendly
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:19.880]  unfortunately this is not the time to do that so even if you run into your next door neighbour
[1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:27.400]  in the shopping centre in the Coles washer at Coles wars or Aldi or any other grocery shop
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:33.880]  don't start up a conversation now is the time for minimising your interactions with others
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:40.920]  even if you've got a mask do not think that affords total protection we want to be absolutely
[1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:46.760]  sure that as we go about our daily lives we do not come into contact with anyone else that would
[1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:52.840]  pose a risk. About one day learning to live with this virus so I'm wondering at what point does
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:59.880]  the pandemic end and COVID-19 becomes endemic? I think that's the reality that most of the world
[1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:06.600]  has been confronting what we're really pleased to say is we've got great vaccines and I think
[1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:12.280]  I've indicated before that you know we will be getting vaccinated regularly there will be new
[1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:17.880]  strains that emerge potentially and will have boosters a bit like seasonal flu so every year
[1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:23.640]  in seasonal flu they try and predict which strains are the predominating strains and we have a vaccine
[1:27:23.640 --> 1:27:30.360]  what's really useful is some of the technology we've made vaccines quicker than we've ever made
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:36.600]  them before. Those are not vaccines in which? It gives us hope that we'll be able to accommodate
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:45.000]  to any changes in the virus but that's where we're going to be and the key message is we need to get
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:52.040]  that second dose protection so whilst I'm very pleased we are very pleased as you know I've
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:57.480]  previously said I want to see the sky as a limit I think Australia can be the most vaccinated
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:02.280]  country in the world because we believe in science and we believe in vaccines and we believe in
[1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:09.000]  science but what I also need to do is get that second dose into people because two doses protects.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:16.520]  When we do open up a 70% double dose anyone who interacts with each other will be completely
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:21.160]  vaccinated so that massively reduces the chance of anybody requiring hospitalisation.
[1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:25.400]  But they're going to have to surveil you and watch you with an app to make sure you're only
[1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:29.960]  close to someone that is doing that and they're saying it's a law to have the now apps on your
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:36.200]  phones that's the future a hell on earth big article about it on info wars.com fight back

[1:33:05.720 --> 1:33:12.760]  i've been waiting so long to be where i'm going
[1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:17.800]  in the sunshine of your love
[1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:24.120]  who there's eric claptin
[1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:34.680]  to barely survive his Pfizer shot and is fighting back against the tyranny
[1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:41.720]  everything clinton does is great work and that's going to be their big problem is covering up all
[1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:45.960]  the damage these shots are causing and the fact that they're not vaccines they're gene therapies
[1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:49.400]  they they were always planning to do this because it gets rid of your immune system
[1:33:49.400 --> 1:33:55.560]  and addicts you to the shots where they only work for about two months but they also make you super
[1:33:55.560 --> 1:34:04.760]  super sick unbelievable that they would do something like this but it's also unbelievable
[1:34:04.760 --> 1:34:12.920]  isn't it ladies and gentlemen that the current head of the FDA was the head regulator what was
[1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:20.600]  it 20 years ago and respectively 10 years ago and she authorized oxy cotton and then oxy cotton
[1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:29.880]  for children which is heroin synthetic heroin and then fentanyl which is 50 to 100 times depending
[1:34:29.880 --> 1:34:36.840]  on the type they make stronger than heroin she got that authorized the chinese just cloned it
[1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:46.200]  now what type of monsters people like janet woodcock would do that well evil eugenicist
[1:34:46.200 --> 1:34:55.960]  depopulationist i remember fiser put out the artisil shot that was a live virus vaccine
[1:34:55.960 --> 1:35:00.040]  and killed a bunch of people and sterilized them so fiser even pulled out of this vaccine operation
[1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:05.560]  last year and said this doesn't work in our trials this is killing lab animals because even though
[1:35:05.560 --> 1:35:11.480]  they said you have to do tests they still did them they said we're getting antibody dependent
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:17.080]  enhancement and they said we we don't want to kill a bunch of people but you know who
[1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:21.400]  doesn't kill people bear you know you know them for aspirin the rest of it that's really just a
[1:35:21.400 --> 1:35:28.200]  plant but bear pharmaceuticals work for the nazis they still had that attitude and in the 90s for
[1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:34.520]  over a decade they know only got blood from one state that didn't do any screening that was arkansas
[1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:39.560]  with a certain governors there and then when they were president this is all mainline news
[1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:46.920]  held back when msnbc wasn't totally evil they covered it even and they knowingly
[1:35:46.920 --> 1:35:51.800]  shipping around the world and millions got hepatitis and hiv from it and they reached a 10
[1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:57.320]  billion dollar settlement just recently in roundup so that's the type of stuff that they're involved
[1:35:57.320 --> 1:36:04.760]  in and so now they've done something a hundred times worse than roundup which is hard to say
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:17.960]  probably a 200 times bigger than bear with the hiv i mean this is hundreds of millions of people
[1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:22.760]  in the west have been given something that in the lab studies kills rats and mice within about six
[1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:28.520]  months so they estimate two to five years with humans and now people are getting blood clots
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:33.160]  are dying even quicker than scientists thought and the hospitals are full of people that took the
[1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:42.520]  two shots whether it's rock stars that take it or whether it's oscar delahoya who takes the
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:48.520]  second shot was in the hospital they tell them oh you've got covid and if you die of covid the feds
[1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:57.080]  have fed cdc and were vaccinated they don't call it covid so the fact that the majority of people
[1:36:57.080 --> 1:37:03.960]  dying worldwide have had the shot they're just suppressing that information here so folks nobody's
[1:37:03.960 --> 1:37:07.880]  going to come to your aid they've got liability protection when they inject you with this so it's
[1:37:07.880 --> 1:37:13.480]  a life and death situation they get the word out so why am i on rand paul's butt
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:19.880]  he's the best he calls fouchy opera gain a function being a liar fouchy sponsored the
[1:37:19.880 --> 1:37:25.320]  conferences he sponsored the luhan lab he directed it all he directed the cover up and and paul has
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:31.240]  said you need to be criminally investigated okay that's great but bring in operation lock step bring in
[1:37:33.800 --> 1:37:40.680]  quote claus swab running the agenda with bill gateson saying we're capturing and taking countries over
[1:37:40.680 --> 1:37:46.600]  using the the virus fear i mean my god they don't even deny their battle plans
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:56.440]  you know at least cruise and paul and holly and cotton camp and china which should be stood up against
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:38:03.160]  but let me tell you china's of the biggest outside threat but the satanic gorilla on our backs
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:10.200]  is bill gates and ted turner and all these globalists and it's just insane and their plan is racial
[1:38:10.200 --> 1:38:16.520]  division cultural division division of the sexes creating mass psychosis dividing the people further
[1:38:16.520 --> 1:38:22.520]  it's in all their documents and then claiming society falls because of racial issues look at this
[1:38:22.520 --> 1:38:26.760]  out of the nih they teach the same stuff in europe same stuff in australia same stuff in canada
[1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:32.920]  same stuff here in all the public schools both primary and secondary dear white people
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:40.360]  nhs lectures brits about their privilege that's the national health service that's published a
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:46.120]  blog on its official website called dear white people in the uk which lectures brits about their
[1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:49.960]  white quote privilege and says they should be uncomfortable about their whiteness that's those
[1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:55.080]  are quotes as they invade the country and as they bring in the foreigners that don't say adopt our
[1:38:55.080 --> 1:38:59.400]  culture which are obviously moving here you think it's it's superior or you want to be part of it
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:08.360]  no the culture of free market and self-defense and all this is bad get rid of it all and your bag is
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:17.320]  your white and the nih is there praying on you the article written by a sheenie benjamin a quality
[1:39:17.320 --> 1:39:24.040]  diversity and inclusion lead at the nursing and midwife council not a real job it orders white
[1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:29.400]  people to read numerous far left screeds about intersexuality and why white people should feel
[1:39:29.400 --> 1:39:32.920]  guilty about the color of their skin this is why the globalists are killing everybody invading
[1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:37.880]  and listen to what black and minority ethnic people are saying you mean the black and
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:41.480]  ethnic people the globalists have hired other spokespersons as the corporations hide behind
[1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:45.720]  them don't say i'm not political to excuse yourself from this conversation this is classic
[1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:51.880]  marx's takeover the text marx right now ignorance isn't an excuse you can't unsee what you've seen
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:58.360]  what the un killing a million Africans in rwanda with their land christians no i can't unsee what
[1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:02.680]  i've seen we're cutting off the world economy and starving 20 million people extra to death in the
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:06.600]  last year and a half most of maverick and no i can't unsee what i've seen so while you murder
[1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:10.920]  the africans while you build abortions in their communities the ones that live you try to fill
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:15.320]  full of racial hatred so they'll go out and beat the stab and murder innocent white people you let
[1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:25.960]  us are sick scum you know i am just totally overwhelmed here but i tell you what i'm going
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:32.200]  to cover i said i'd get into the public announcement of the u.s. government now there's about the
[1:40:32.200 --> 1:40:37.480]  carbon taxes on your app as part of the vaccine app we'll get to that i'll dig it out of the stack
[1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:41.480]  here i don't have it here probably so i'm not covering it yet but i'll i'll find it during
[1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:47.080]  the break and get to it but the first thing i want to hit are these two big juicy nuggets because
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:56.200]  they tie together and that is china goes to war when the liberal world order will cover that next
[1:40:56.200 --> 1:41:01.240]  and how that ties into satanic temple attacks texas abortion law argues that it violates religious
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:06.760]  freedom to abortion rituals and the killing babies is a ritual which by the way the satanist
[1:41:06.760 --> 1:41:12.120]  tell you they are they get pregnant on purpose to kill the baby and they've got fetishes online
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:18.120]  they have ceremonies um and a lot of these groups i've told you it's come out there's been a rest
[1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:23.000]  they get whitewashed they have sex with a little baby after they pull it out that's why the prize
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:27.560]  is like a eight and a half month partial birth and they take the baby out and have their way with it
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:32.200]  and then dismember it now this group is just saying it's a ritual they want to kill the baby and
[1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:36.600]  they've already told you enough but i mean it's a fact that some of these groups do that and there's
[1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:40.920]  just no end to what they do they believe they get dark power from their god we're going to go to break

[1:48:11.720 --> 1:48:22.680]  facts what we face comes out of the french revolution and adam weiss hop and a group of
[1:48:22.680 --> 1:48:31.080]  professors from universities across europe and england scotland and ireland they wanted to overthrow
[1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:39.000]  the church and they wanted to overthrow the nobility and in its place replace themselves
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:45.560]  in those positions and their writings are public towards washington actually confronted them and
[1:48:45.560 --> 1:48:51.400]  blocked them we launched our own revolution there's more than 16 letters 16 or 17 letters
[1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:57.640]  from the president on that this is all real history the public thinks it's something in movies
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:06.360]  or you know something in just fiction books and so out of the jackabins and the french revolution
[1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:11.880]  that was just a mass psychosis kind of like the witch hunts that happened in switzerland and
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:18.760]  salem massachusetts here in the united states that killed tens of thousands of innocent women
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:26.600]  they sought to bring in their own hysteria and they wanted a nine-day work week they
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:29.960]  wanted to get rid of christianity it was a satanic religion
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:36.600]  yeah there's yours washington all free masonry should be disbanded america
[1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:40.920]  because our organization has been infiltrated by the illuminati and they have bad intention for
[1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:46.040]  america in the world that's in his letters the national archive that's not fake see debate
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:50.680]  whether masons are good or not oh jones is secretly a mason uh he said he had a family
[1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:56.040]  who were mason's wasn't even mean you judge a tree by its fruits i'm a christian that loves god
[1:49:56.040 --> 1:50:01.560]  i i have a relationship with god and i and i believe in life but you've always got the
[1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:05.160]  Pharisees that are always claiming this person is not pure that person's not pure
[1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:09.560]  well i just asked those Pharisees what are you doing to fight evil but but moving on oh
[1:50:09.560 --> 1:50:15.400]  jorge washington wasn't good he was a mason yeah well so was king solomon it's even mean
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:20.840]  masons were the secret colleges you didn't just let anybody go to college back then
[1:50:20.840 --> 1:50:26.440]  so it was the mystery schools of mathematics and science and astronomy and yes you'd have lots of
[1:50:26.440 --> 1:50:29.320]  different ancient secrets of occult groups in it as well
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:35.800]  ain't the secrets of greece and egypt and babelon all of that but yeah by the time of
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:40.520]  george washington's time the satanists had taken over most of the masonic lodges around the world
[1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:46.280]  according to george washington so it became not just a mystery school it became a luciferian school
[1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:53.720]  so china goes to war with the liberal world order china's announcing they're going to incentivize
[1:50:53.720 --> 1:50:58.360]  having three children not only having one they are going to put anyone who is a homosexual in
[1:50:58.360 --> 1:51:03.400]  prison anyone acting girly or a feminine who's a man will be banned from tv have a social credit
[1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:09.720]  score lower anyone telling children to rebel on their parents will be dealt with they don't allow
[1:51:09.720 --> 1:51:14.840]  any of the race baiting garbage but they finance owning four of the big six production firms
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:21.000]  movie houses movie studios here in the united states so china is bombarding us with things that
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:29.800]  will break us up and that will destroy us but at the same time they've outlawed it all there
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:34.040]  and that has totally pissed off george soros here he is right here
[1:51:36.120 --> 1:51:43.320]  soros green to turn china into a neoliberal globalization opportunity of of nobodies who
[1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:47.560]  won't stand up for themselves and are atomized basically cultural satanist shouldn't even know
[1:51:47.560 --> 1:51:54.120]  they're satanist and so president jiji ping is cracking down on every element of liberal world
[1:51:54.120 --> 1:52:00.520]  order use convert our societies and forming the most intensely nationalistic country in the world
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:04.840]  there's a reason george soros this week's ago once again labeled she the most dangerous enemy
[1:52:04.840 --> 1:52:10.520]  of open societies in the world so the globalists put because you know i really respect some of my
[1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:18.600]  guests that i've had on and we need to get some of those guests back on but have one of those
[1:52:19.560 --> 1:52:24.760]  alzheimer's moments who's the guy that puts out the christian comic books we've had him on a lot
[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:30.360]  he's bald lives in italy he's a great guy he's reporting out that he's totally broken with
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:34.280]  the new world order he said like on my show like four or five years ago what's his name it'll
[1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:39.640]  box day we didn't get fox day back on this week or next week because he's been dead
[1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:44.120]  he was first guy like on the show like four years ago going gg ping will betray the new world order
[1:52:44.120 --> 1:52:48.760]  to be a nationalist and then stop them and actually secretly is opposing them and they hate him i'm
[1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:54.040]  like dude come on i don't like gg ping and he does some bad stuff but he is definitely breaking with
[1:52:54.040 --> 1:53:02.680]  him so is putin our media doesn't want to lay out the common sense reforms g has initiated over the
[1:53:02.680 --> 1:53:10.040]  past few years because they don't want us to get any ideas anti-white woke ism is our only
[1:53:10.040 --> 1:53:14.840]  state ideology that's the religion and all that goes against it must be silenced or destroyed
[1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:20.760]  nonetheless some anon and fortune laid it out in a thread friday and it's a really good article

[1:53:55.400 --> 1:54:01.640]  satanic temple attacks texas abortion law argues that it violates their religious freedom
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:09.320]  to abortion rituals gateway pundit dot com the satanic temple is trying to fight the new abortion
[1:54:09.320 --> 1:54:14.520]  law in texas by arguing it violates their religious freedom to abortion rituals and that's not a
[1:54:14.520 --> 1:54:22.280]  gimmick that's what they really do lucian grieves the temple spokesperson and co-founder argued
[1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:25.560]  in a letter to the food and drug administration that access to abortion
[1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:34.200]  drugs and must be allowed under the religious freedom restoration act to be used for their
[1:54:34.200 --> 1:54:39.000]  abortion rituals it goes on to say this is part of our religion to kill babies
[1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:43.960]  and it just goes on from there and you know they always do it tongue in cheek and they have a
[1:54:43.960 --> 1:54:47.240]  movie called hell satan about this group it's really popular with democrats all over the country
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:50.360]  i sat there in the movie theater in austin while everybody got really excited about it
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:55.000]  and then i saw the rituals i saw the groups i saw the really unhappy people that were involved
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:59.320]  and these are real satanists they're like oh we just do this to freak out the christians uh no
[1:54:59.320 --> 1:55:03.000]  ladies and gentlemen this is very serious i don't know if they themselves in this group
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:08.280]  take part in rituals killing babies but it's come out and they're saying that they support that
[1:55:09.720 --> 1:55:15.640]  but they busted people having sex with the dead babies the living babies keeping them alive selling
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:21.640]  body parts and doing rituals and they've had nurses go public and they've arrested them in what
[1:55:21.640 --> 1:55:26.440]  missouri texas illinois and there's been a lot of cases of this but this stuff gets buried in the
[1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:31.400]  local news so i've been around it folks it's satanism here's another one satanists admit
[1:55:31.400 --> 1:55:37.320]  they are making child sacrifice through abortion an official ritual by the satanic temple
[1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:46.840]  in 2015 satanist raised cash to support the democrat abortion on demand policy 2017
[1:55:46.840 --> 1:55:50.520]  plan parenthood teamed up with satanist to expand the missouri abortion business
[1:55:52.200 --> 1:55:56.040]  and it just goes on to have their and they go out in front of the abortion clinics and
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:56:00.760]  hump each other and dress like babies and simulate raping each other and it's just all a bunch of
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:06.200]  degenerates that are all alone and super unhappy and pathetic and at the end of the day they can
[1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:11.960]  make excuses about oh raper ancestor oh deformed baby doctors say it's a medical issue when that's
[1:56:11.960 --> 1:56:16.360]  going on and wink wink then they do a procedure that's the way it's always been and and that's
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:20.600]  still not good because the end of this is satanism you can have all the excuses and all things all
[1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:25.000]  day but it's about killing babies it's about making humans a commodity and now it's about

[1:58:55.400 --> 1:59:01.320]  ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset and that's why it's more important
[1:59:01.320 --> 1:59:06.520]  than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people
[1:59:06.520 --> 1:59:10.760]  are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[1:59:10.760 --> 1:59:14.680]  and trying to stop their agenda but we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the
[1:59:14.680 --> 1:59:18.760]  number one things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the best food ready to ship at

[1:59:57.320 --> 2:00:05.720]  at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one from the front lines of the
[2:00:05.720 --> 2:00:29.160]  information war it's alex jones
[2:00:29.160 --> 2:00:34.920]  the upcoming anniversary of the horrible events of 9 11 and not just the ones the media sold you
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:39.960]  is not one of the ironies of these last several years for so many years al-qaeda and ices the number
[2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:45.960]  one terror threat to the united states now the number one terror threat homegrown that is exactly
[2:00:45.960 --> 2:00:51.640]  right they're more concerned about far right radicals they've killed more people in this country
[2:00:51.640 --> 2:00:58.120]  since 9 11 than foreign-based terrorists they're more concerned about the fact that ices and al-qaeda
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:01:04.920]  through social media can basically brainwash people thousands of miles away to act independently
[2:01:04.920 --> 2:01:10.040]  without command and control from them that is the concern this week and i can tell you combined
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:15.160]  with the domestic terror threat and that threat law enforcement is as antsy as i've seen them in
[2:01:15.160 --> 2:01:20.760]  quite some time what many of us labeled as conspiracy theorists were screaming from the
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:28.440]  rooftops has now become accepted ancient history what i didn't know in that morning is the secret
[2:01:28.440 --> 2:01:33.400]  decisions that were made at the highest levels of the government and what the government was
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:40.760]  willing to do under the blanket of national security what they were willing to do
[2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:48.520]  and going way outside the law immediately i mean within days and weeks verbal authorization
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:55.720]  was being granted for a program called stellar wind in which they're turning the extraordinary
[2:01:55.720 --> 2:02:03.960]  power of nsa and pointing it not just foreign but also domestic parts of it are still classified
[2:02:03.960 --> 2:02:09.960]  i'll just call it a warrantless wiretapping program that involved large metadata collection
[2:02:10.840 --> 2:02:17.960]  and also collection of content much of it happening in the homeland will we avenge their deaths
[2:02:17.960 --> 2:02:24.600]  and reclaim what was stolen from us following the new pearl harbor as was outlined by the neocons in
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:30.280]  their project for a new american century there are many theories surrounding the events of 9 11
[2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:36.680]  and they will be continued to be debated ad nauseam but what can't be denied is that americans
[2:02:36.680 --> 2:02:43.160]  continued to be attacked from within as their liberties were discarded for a creeping new world
[2:02:43.160 --> 2:02:48.120]  order surveillance state and we get different views now on just what these spying powers mean and
[2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:54.440]  what might happen if they expire and as the elitist social engineers gathered over two decades to
[2:02:54.440 --> 2:03:02.200]  formulate humanity's demise at davos and bill berg that system has evolved into a medical tyranny
[2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:09.480]  united nation cloward and piven great reset for the fort industrial revolution aimed at helping
[2:03:09.480 --> 2:03:17.880]  stable society meet the challenges presented by the rapid technological change there is a small
[2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:24.360]  bump in the road joe biden has actually managed to sign an executive order instructing the us
[2:03:24.360 --> 2:03:30.120]  attorney general to personally examine the merits of all cases where the government had invoked state
[2:03:30.120 --> 2:03:35.720]  secrets privilege and to err on the side of disclosure in cases where the events in question
[2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:42.920]  occurred two decades ago or longer biden finally caved after the families of 9 11 victims requested
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:49.080]  biden not attend any anniversary events until he honored his campaign promise to release the
[2:03:49.080 --> 2:03:54.280]  documents time for the truth to come out and we would assign this letter regardless of who it was

[2:06:13.880 --> 2:06:20.920]  spoken dr peter mccullough academic physician from dalas my hometown and he drove down here to graciously
[2:06:20.920 --> 2:06:26.200]  be with us in studio he'll be with us 30 minutes into the next hour and i'm going to do a special
[2:06:26.200 --> 2:06:31.880]  report on the left and how they are under mass psychosis and some of the studies and documentation
[2:06:31.880 --> 2:06:37.240]  of that in the war room 3 p.m. central today dr peter mccullough is here he wants to get into
[2:06:37.240 --> 2:06:42.440]  vaccine failure he wants to get into now we know what these supposed shots are doing and where he
[2:06:42.440 --> 2:06:48.360]  thinks it's all going but also he wants to get into some censorship first you've seen big tech go
[2:06:48.360 --> 2:06:54.760]  around and block senator ran paul uh when uh he says things they don't like even though it's true
[2:06:54.760 --> 2:07:00.920]  the natural immunity is better than a vaccine immunity uh donald trump censored off twitter i
[2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:06.920]  mean this is so dangerous and the big group they're trying to silence is doctors and scientists
[2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:13.240]  and nurses so dr peter mccullough thank you so much america out loud dot com and you do your
[2:07:13.240 --> 2:07:17.240]  great mccullough report as well thanks for coming in sir thanks for having me well i'm gonna try to
[2:07:17.240 --> 2:07:20.680]  give you the floor because you're a very well spoken guy and a lot of their shows a lot of their
[2:07:20.680 --> 2:07:25.160]  guests usually have five minutes or whatever where do you want to start first well by introduction
[2:07:25.160 --> 2:07:30.680]  i'm an academic internist and cardiologist in dalas texas i see patients every week i'm the
[2:07:30.680 --> 2:07:35.800]  editor of two major journals uh that are cited by the national library of medicine i'm the senior
[2:07:35.800 --> 2:07:40.760]  associate editor of the longest standing journal in cardiology and as many of your listeners know
[2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:46.360]  i've dedicated the last year and a half to covet nineteen in a sense i've done a a self-directed
[2:07:46.360 --> 2:07:52.360]  fellowship in infectious disease and in covet nineteen and as you implied i've been subject to
[2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:59.080]  censorship as many other academic physicians have largely because we are publicly participating
[2:07:59.080 --> 2:08:05.560]  in a topic of national importance and this is very very critical uh in a time like this
[2:08:05.560 --> 2:08:12.840]  we need many doctors and we need many scientists to put their ideas together to help guide america
[2:08:12.840 --> 2:08:17.800]  forward and that's one of the reasons why myself and others are frequent commentators
[2:08:17.800 --> 2:08:24.040]  on national media programs like this one and unfortunately my healthcare system in dalas
[2:08:24.040 --> 2:08:30.600]  is suing me personally uh related to issues in a separation agreement but i am declaring no
[2:08:31.160 --> 2:08:37.560]  opinions on behalf of any affiliation organization my opinions are only those of myself as they are
[2:08:37.560 --> 2:08:43.240]  with any doctor in any scientific discourse it's and again the group you're with my family's
[2:08:43.240 --> 2:08:48.040]  youths really respected really a lot but you only want their name said you've never brought them in
[2:08:48.040 --> 2:08:53.320]  and the idea that you as a family man as a doctor as a respected academic the fact that you're not
[2:08:53.320 --> 2:08:58.280]  supposed to have speech in america that's preposterous since when it's not like you're in the cia and
[2:08:58.280 --> 2:09:02.360]  you violated some non-disclosures not like you told them what's going on it's scott and white
[2:09:03.800 --> 2:09:08.120]  all we're doing is discussing the data and one of the things that i want your fact checkers
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:14.040]  who who watch your show and they follow me carefully have them fact check every single citation
[2:09:14.040 --> 2:09:18.120]  i'm going to give today over the next few minutes because all we're going to do is talk about scientific
[2:09:18.120 --> 2:09:24.280]  data and apply the results to the path forward in the pandemic give us a prelude and then please
[2:09:24.280 --> 2:09:28.120]  get into your gracious to be here sir as millions are watching right now millions will watch later
[2:09:28.120 --> 2:09:32.840]  when it's archived of what you want to lay out the next hour and 25 minutes i think one of the
[2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:38.360]  biggest topics and it's a really of public health importance is that the covet 19 vaccines that were
[2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:44.840]  so heavily leveraged and relied upon in our federal response to the pandemic are failing and patients
[2:09:44.840 --> 2:09:48.600]  who are fully and partially vaccinated are contracting covet 19 and we gotta talk about them
[2:09:49.720 --> 2:09:53.320]  what are some of the other areas you want to get into i think we really should cover
[2:09:53.880 --> 2:09:59.240]  the issue of what's called early sequence multi-drug therapy because it applies to both
[2:09:59.240 --> 2:10:03.560]  those vaccinated and unvaccinated who are high risk and develop covet 19 all right y'all have
[2:10:03.560 --> 2:10:07.400]  the forum we come back we've got five six minutes to break let me ask you a few questions what do
[2:10:07.400 --> 2:10:12.680]  you make of australia saying up to five shots a year israel now saying a fourth shot maybe a fifth
[2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:17.400]  or sixth every year phizer is talking about therapeutic pills you're gonna take and now
[2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:21.720]  they're sending what smartphones to document you're taking your pills daily it sounds like the drug
[2:10:21.720 --> 2:10:26.360]  companies are literally involved in a hostile takeover trump said last week on national tv that
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:32.120]  yeah phizer basically had more power than when he was president than he did there's a there's a real
[2:10:32.120 --> 2:10:41.960]  clear theme of progressive loss of medical freedom tied to progressively reduced personal freedom and
[2:10:41.960 --> 2:10:47.640]  we know from these vaccine platforms uh there were 24 of them messenger RNA and adrenoviral
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:54.120]  dna platforms none of them were actually designed to be vaccines they were designed to be genetic
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:11:00.600]  transfer technology program programs with intermittent injections wow it's it's it's just
[2:11:00.600 --> 2:11:05.720]  amazing and i remember reading i'm no doctor like you and i remember 18 months ago gates is like well
[2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:10.280]  you'll need a lot of boosters and then i went and looked it up and they go yeah the the chief scientist
[2:11:10.280 --> 2:11:13.880]  in in in england with their big government lab there he goes well these are really gene
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:18.440]  therapies he's for it and he's saying you'll need one every five or six months i mean they're admitting
[2:11:18.440 --> 2:11:25.160]  it and then playing dumb like it's a new thing well gene transfer technology for what for most
[2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:31.400]  individuals is a form of a common cold uh is certainly not justified i can tell you this much
[2:11:31.400 --> 2:11:37.400]  that a definition of a successful vaccine is it would at least have to last a year at least a year
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:43.400]  and it would have to have 50 protection and what we know now uh is that the israeli health minister
[2:11:43.400 --> 2:11:50.200]  has visor fully vaccinated at 39 protection pure neck and colleagues from the male clinic large
[2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:57.240]  study has visor at 42 protective and then the imperial college of london uh with the react
[2:11:57.240 --> 2:12:04.280]  study group has visor at 44 protection and so there's no secret why visor basically is a
[2:12:04.280 --> 2:12:12.120]  non-viable failing vaccine and is first up for now boosters into a failing commercial product
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:16.680]  and we've still got four minutes to break so dr macala please start now you were wanting to get
[2:12:16.680 --> 2:12:21.800]  into vaccine failure first well the cdc is telling us and i think this is really important for
[2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:30.760]  americans to know the cdc has on its website uh a total of uh of uh thousands of cases
[2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:36.360]  of fully vaccinated americans who are failed and they're in the hospital they have um
[2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:44.120]  paper out by havers and colleagues from the cdc uh in the month of june they had of those
[2:12:44.120 --> 2:12:53.240]  hospitalized in america with covet 19 23.4 percent were partially or fully vaccinated we know from
[2:12:53.240 --> 2:13:01.400]  posting on the cdc website in late august that uh 78 to 80 percent of those who died
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:07.240]  with covet 19 uh that were fully vaccinated were over age 65 so unfortunately the people
[2:13:07.240 --> 2:13:11.880]  who need the vaccinations the most are not having the vaccines pulled through for them
[2:13:12.840 --> 2:13:18.680]  and people can say well if you look at israel if 90 percent are vaccinated of course most
[2:13:18.680 --> 2:13:23.560]  people in the hospital are going to be vaccinated but in the old days most vaccines pretty much
[2:13:23.560 --> 2:13:29.800]  worked since since since when does the does the immunity go away in just a few months well in israel
[2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:35.800]  we had a pre vaccination curve to look at so that was very clear you could see the height of the
[2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:40.200]  curve anybody can go to world o meter or anyone of these covet tracker websites and look at the
[2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:45.480]  pre vaccination curve now look at the post vaccination curve with essentially all eligible
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:51.400]  adults vaccinated israel the post vaccination curve the delta curve is larger than the pre
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:55.960]  vaccination curve so there in many ways the vaccine has made the outbreak worse and this
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:14:00.360]  was predicted by many experts in the field wow we're going to go to break in a minute and a
[2:14:00.360 --> 2:14:06.040]  half but please continue we know more that uh paper that just hit new england journal medicine
[2:14:06.040 --> 2:14:11.240]  by keener and colleagues from the university of california at san diego where they had 83
[2:14:11.240 --> 2:14:18.600]  percent of health care workers fully vaccinated they now have more vaccinated cases 94 compared to
[2:14:18.600 --> 2:14:25.000]  unvaccinated cases of health care workers getting covet 19 an example we're here in the health care
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:30.520]  arena where there's vaccine mandates across health systems in the united states it's actually
[2:14:30.520 --> 2:14:38.040]  making it worse that we were better off before mass vaccination and again i'm not a respected
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:43.480]  doctor and an academic like you but i can look at the curves here all over the world as they get the
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:49.960]  first shot the second shot suddenly mass hospitalizations mass deaths illnesses trailing right
[2:14:49.960 --> 2:14:55.560]  efforts it's like i pull a trigger with a 308 shoot a deer at 100 yards i watch the deer fall over
[2:14:55.560 --> 2:15:00.200]  i watch them take the shot i watch them fall over i mean i'm not a rocket scientist but this looks
[2:15:00.200 --> 2:15:07.080]  bad doctor sure we have israel we have gibraltar singapore iceland united kingdom united kingdom
[2:15:07.080 --> 2:15:12.840]  does some of the best data uh analyses that we have we have the technical briefing september
[2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:22.440]  third 492 528 cases of delta 55.4 percent are vaccinated stay there start over on this this
[2:15:22.440 --> 2:15:27.000]  is huge when we come back and i've got some of the graphs out of israel out of gibraltar out of
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:33.960]  singapore that you mentioned when we come back and he is the host of the mccullough report mc
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:41.240]  cullough report find it at america out loud dot com and he's fighting hard for all of us
[2:15:42.760 --> 2:15:46.760]  if you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:15:46.760 --> 2:15:52.680]  electricity this will be the most important message you'll hear this year here's why we now
[2:15:52.680 --> 2:15:58.280]  have a small number of solar generators back in stock these emergency backup systems provide
[2:15:58.280 --> 2:16:04.760]  lifesaving backup power when you need it most and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly

[2:16:45.640 --> 2:16:50.920]  storable survival food i've got great news in fact i'll be the best news you've heard in a while
[2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:57.400]  here's the thing we've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans survival soup beans
[2:16:57.400 --> 2:17:03.400]  these beans are gorgeous highly nutritious and above all with no hesitation whatsoever the best
[2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:09.480]  tasting beans in the entire world the best part we've dropped the price by 33 percent this week for
[2:17:09.480 --> 2:17:15.080]  listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat
[2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:19.640]  if you want to gets even better with your permission and with a high regard for your
[2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:25.480]  health and well-being i also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most
[2:17:25.480 --> 2:17:31.320]  underrated superfood in the world period go to soup bean survival dot com that soup bean
[2:17:31.320 --> 2:17:37.160]  survival dot com and discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away at soup
[2:17:37.160 --> 2:17:45.480]  bean survival dot com that soup bean survival dot com i've been fighting as hard as i can for
[2:17:45.480 --> 2:17:51.960]  almost 28 years against the globalist i wanted to stop their agenda i wanted to wake up the world
[2:17:51.960 --> 2:17:57.720]  and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people
[2:17:57.720 --> 2:18:03.240]  are awake yes we're not getting caught flat footed but they are going ahead with their full
[2:18:03.240 --> 2:18:08.280]  operational deindustrialization great reset and that's why it's more important than ever
[2:18:08.280 --> 2:18:12.360]  that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[2:18:12.360 --> 2:18:16.440]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information
[2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:20.920]  warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda we've also got to get personally prepared and
[2:18:20.920 --> 2:18:24.360]  one of the number one things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the best food
[2:18:24.360 --> 2:18:29.640]  ready to ship at very important prices at infowarstore.com so whether it's a month or a six
[2:18:29.640 --> 2:18:35.160]  month or a year supply or specialty diets it's ready to ship right now lock your orders in before
[2:18:35.160 --> 2:18:40.440]  food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits because believe me serious times are
[2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:46.840]  coming get ready at infowarstore.com the purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is
[2:18:46.840 --> 2:18:53.400]  plenty to be afraid of today half the population has lined up for an untested deadly and debilitating
[2:18:53.400 --> 2:18:58.840]  experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease
[2:18:58.840 --> 2:19:04.120]  the perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80 of the population
[2:19:04.120 --> 2:19:09.640]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years for those of us
[2:19:09.640 --> 2:19:14.280]  who have awoken from the spell we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably
[2:19:14.280 --> 2:19:20.360]  unsettling to see but there's only two things to do we continue sounding the alarm because it's a
[2:19:20.360 --> 2:19:26.200]  numbers game if enough people awaken from the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we
[2:19:26.200 --> 2:19:32.280]  eventually will the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare get up to
[2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:39.480]  a year's worth of storable foods water filtration survival gear seeds shortwave radios and life
[2:19:39.480 --> 2:20:04.920]  saving knowledge at infowarstore.com you're listening to the alex jones show i tell you i don't like
[2:20:04.920 --> 2:20:10.120]  going to break with this guy because he's saying amazing stuff Dr. Peter McCullough americanoutlaw.com
[2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:15.160]  he is with us and i've got all the graphs out of israel showing right after they get the shots
[2:20:15.160 --> 2:20:19.240]  first second third exploding he's got all the statistics and he was telling me how really
[2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:24.200]  serious delta is now now last year i said hey this is overblown there there's people that die
[2:20:24.200 --> 2:20:29.000]  car wrecks are saying have it this mutation which i think came from the vaccinated and
[2:20:29.960 --> 2:20:34.360]  is super deadly and super bad and he was just telling me how bad it is and i don't need
[2:20:34.360 --> 2:20:39.320]  you to tell me i believe him i experienced that my family and my crew and around austin so please
[2:20:39.320 --> 2:20:44.280]  continue dr and repeat what you said no i agree i i understood underestimated delta as well i was
[2:20:44.280 --> 2:20:49.400]  on national tv a couple times mentioning that it was going to be more mild and it is true it has
[2:20:49.400 --> 2:20:54.760]  a lower case fatality rate than the other versions and this is shown in the uk variant report even
[2:20:54.760 --> 2:20:58.920]  up to september 3rd but it's because largely because younger people get it but the younger people who
[2:20:58.920 --> 2:21:03.400]  get it it's a difficult illness but it's way more contagious right and it's it's way more
[2:21:03.400 --> 2:21:08.280]  contagious and let me tell you we've always had delta we've always had about a dozen different
[2:21:08.280 --> 2:21:14.520]  variants and what happened was uh during the pre-vaccinated era there was an ecological diversity
[2:21:14.520 --> 2:21:20.520]  and when we started vaccinating we basically allowed a dominant variant to come forward and
[2:21:20.520 --> 2:21:24.600]  this actually started in india at amashra where they started using the synavac vaccine a couple
[2:21:24.600 --> 2:21:31.320]  spots there and once we get a dominant mutant to go forward it finds a way of walking on the vaccines
[2:21:31.320 --> 2:21:35.560]  take your time and start over take your time and explain just in all the literature that these
[2:21:35.560 --> 2:21:40.040]  that these live these live vaccines or whatever you're the doctor create these dominant mutants
[2:21:40.040 --> 2:21:44.840]  just like in chickens and you get this americ disease yes that's exactly right so what happened is
[2:21:44.840 --> 2:21:49.960]  in this with using the coronavac or synavac vaccine which is a whole killed vaccine whole
[2:21:49.960 --> 2:21:57.000]  virus killed vaccine that it creates an environment where the the diversity of the different strains
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:01.720]  reduces in a paper from a clinic in boston by nissen and colleagues showed when you get to
[2:22:01.720 --> 2:22:07.400]  about 25 vaccinated in a population you're no longer going to have ecological diversity
[2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:12.760]  and it will narrow what happened in the united states following india and the uk is we went from
[2:22:12.760 --> 2:22:19.960]  about two percent delta early in the spring to most recent estimates end of august by cdc 99.1
[2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:25.160]  percent delta well never had 99 percent of a single strain in the united states that is a
[2:22:25.160 --> 2:22:30.120]  product of vaccination changing the ecological diversity of the variant explain how that works
[2:22:30.920 --> 2:22:36.120]  it turns out that in a paper by fahrenholt another one by vincada christian and and then
[2:22:36.120 --> 2:22:43.160]  actually by our cdc director getting on tv americans learned that the delta variant which has
[2:22:43.160 --> 2:22:48.040]  seven mutations in the spike protein several in the nukko capsa it has basically achieved
[2:22:48.040 --> 2:22:53.160]  antigenic escape what that means is that the antibodies that are raised by the vaccines
[2:22:53.160 --> 2:22:57.960]  cannot hit the virus and can't hit it well enough to stop it and that's the reason why
[2:22:58.600 --> 2:23:04.520]  for instance delta is having such an easy time with fizer now fizer's 30 micrograms per shot
[2:23:04.520 --> 2:23:09.320]  it's the weakest of all the vaccines maderna is 100 micrograms of messenger RNA per shot
[2:23:09.320 --> 2:23:15.480]  maderna is holding up a bit better in the purenex study from male clinic at 72 protection
[2:23:15.480 --> 2:23:20.280]  with delta johnson and johnson we don't know but i can tell you it's clear at 99.1
[2:23:20.280 --> 2:23:26.040]  percent delta it is all about delta delta appears to be beating the vaccines the vaccines are not
[2:23:26.040 --> 2:23:32.280]  being adjusted to cover delta and if we have any type of booster that comes in sooner than a year
[2:23:32.280 --> 2:23:39.400]  that's a basically a marker of a failed vaccine now how did you and so many other doctors a year
[2:23:39.400 --> 2:23:44.600]  ago you're gonna have to go predict it would fail predict it would cause all these problems and and
[2:23:44.600 --> 2:23:48.760]  then why do you think i don't even like to speculate would the establishment go forward
[2:23:48.760 --> 2:23:53.720]  with something they knew would be a fiasco linus pauling predicted it a long time ago linus pauling
[2:23:53.720 --> 2:24:00.600]  said listen don't try to vaccinate for the common cold why because we have a respiratory virus it
[2:24:00.600 --> 2:24:08.760]  is going to use the nasal and oral pharyngeal air passages for its initial uh a touchdown in the human
[2:24:08.760 --> 2:24:14.840]  body that's not well protected by systemic vaccines we know that the lymph nodes and and
[2:24:14.840 --> 2:24:19.640]  i g a and the other components of the immune system up in the nose and mouth are not well
[2:24:19.640 --> 2:24:26.360]  juiced by a vaccine that goes in the arm the other reason why we knew this is that corona viruses
[2:24:26.360 --> 2:24:33.080]  are a family of common cold viruses and prior attempts at trying to vaccinate against them
[2:24:33.080 --> 2:24:39.880]  have failed to make matters worse it wasn't that it was chose alive attenuated or a a killed vaccine
[2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:44.680]  which has been tried and failed or a pure protein vaccine which is still on the way instead the
[2:24:44.680 --> 2:24:50.680]  decision was a genetic vaccine and the genetic vaccines have a dangerous mechanism action they
[2:24:50.680 --> 2:24:57.000]  trick the body cells into producing the dangerous wuhan spike protein the original wild type spike
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:25:03.480]  protein this spike protein uh is the product of gain of function research out of the wuhan lab
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:09.560]  and now uh the human body is tricked into producing it by synthetic messenger RNA which has very strong
[2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:15.720]  nucleoside uh analog caps which don't allow the messenger RNA to be broken down very easily
[2:25:15.720 --> 2:25:20.360]  or the adenoviral DNA which comes in in billions and billions of particles through the j and j
[2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:25.880]  vaccine what you need to know is we've never had a vaccine before with that distributed to the brain
[2:25:25.880 --> 2:25:31.000]  that distributed to the heart and the other vital organs and then set up shop in producing a dangerous
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:36.280]  foreign protein in our own body and that was my next question because again i i use layman terms
[2:25:36.280 --> 2:25:39.640]  i just knew that like the polio vaccine they're using is the number one cause of polo because
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:44.520]  it's a live virus vaccine and i talked to other scientists and i read the reports this genetic
[2:25:44.520 --> 2:25:49.880]  system understands the genetic vaccine so it's like synthetic or wrong i'm just saying that sounds
[2:25:49.880 --> 2:25:56.040]  closer to a live virus vaccine because it does go into your body and produce a synthetic copy
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:25:59.960]  so it sounds similar to that so i'm trying to understand how it's creating variants or how
[2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:04.600]  it's how it's shedding if it's not a live virus no it's different because you know in a live it
[2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:09.560]  anyway let's say even a replication incompetent you're getting exposed to the entire virus that
[2:26:09.560 --> 2:26:16.280]  would be like the inactivated flu but the point is here we actually have the genetic code for the
[2:26:16.280 --> 2:26:22.680]  worst part of the virus going into our cells our cells produce this protein in an uncontrolled
[2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:27.480]  fashion for an uncontrolled duration of time it's expressed on the cell surface which is wrong
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:32.680]  and then the body attacks its own cells because it recognizes spike protein and you and others
[2:26:32.680 --> 2:26:37.720]  warned about it over a year ago so why the hell did the system do this i published an op-ed in the
[2:26:38.360 --> 2:26:45.000]  hill this summer before all this took off and the title of the paper was uh the great gamble of the
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:50.440]  covid-19 vaccine development program and you know i didn't predict all of it but i said you know what
[2:26:50.440 --> 2:26:56.920]  this looks very very much to be a gamble we are putting all of our eggs in one basket there was a
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:27:03.800]  defocus on early in late treatment we were hyper focusing on a fear isolation lockdowns wearing
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:09.000]  a mask and waiting to be saved by a vaccine there was almost this vaccine prep that was going on
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:13.480]  from a psychological perspective and then when these vaccines were rolled out there was really
[2:27:13.480 --> 2:27:18.360]  weren't too many questions asked like what is this stuff how long did it last in the human body
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:23.400]  and so we learned everything after the fact for instance a paper from ogata and colleagues from
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:28.520]  harvard shows the spike protein circulates in the human body for two weeks afterwards we know
[2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:35.080]  this spike protein damages blood cells it it damages uh uh blood vessels cells endothelial
[2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:41.720]  cells and causes thrombosis and blood so is it true that it can uh shed it infect others
[2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:46.040]  it's true that the chinese have shown the whole virus gets into sweat it gets into oral pharyngeal
[2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:51.400]  and your general secretions and it makes sense the spike protein a subunit of the virus clearly
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:56.200]  would be in these body secretions and shedding probably does occur i can tell you clinically
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:28:02.280]  the most significant shedding i've ever seen clinically is uh a recipient of the shedding
[2:28:02.280 --> 2:28:08.680]  event that the young person uh expressed shingles as an example or can it can change menstrual
[2:28:08.680 --> 2:28:12.600]  periods or feel somewhat that's what we've seen in the news is people that have partners that
[2:28:12.600 --> 2:28:18.680]  took it are getting rashes right and so in fact it was uh basically a close context sexual context
[2:28:18.680 --> 2:28:24.440]  so it's reasonable advice based on what's known uh no close contact for about four weeks with the
[2:28:24.440 --> 2:28:29.000]  vaccinated individual wow dr stay there this is incredible i want you to go wherever you want
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:33.960]  we come back back into the vaccine failure where you think this goes and what you think is going
[2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:38.360]  to happen now that this is all coming out i mean the world's learning about this this thing's falling
[2:28:38.360 --> 2:28:44.680]  apart if you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:28:44.680 --> 2:28:50.680]  electricity this will be the most important message you'll hear this year here's why we now
[2:28:50.680 --> 2:28:56.200]  have a small number of solar generators back in stock these emergency backup systems provide
[2:28:56.200 --> 2:29:01.880]  lifesaving backup power when you need it most and unlike gas generators solar generators run
[2:29:01.880 --> 2:29:08.120]  quietly emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun
[2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:13.160]  whether it's wildfires dangerous whether power grid issues or just getting off the grid you'll
[2:29:13.160 --> 2:29:18.520]  never have to suffer through painful power outages again even better all this week radio
[2:29:18.520 --> 2:29:24.200]  listeners get over seven hundred dollars in free off the grid bonuses too go to my solar backup

[2:29:52.840 --> 2:29:58.600]  attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide now ladies and gentlemen
[2:29:58.600 --> 2:30:02.600]  storable food has always been something that's important to have it's a checkbox that everybody
[2:30:02.600 --> 2:30:07.960]  needs to have taken care of right along with water filtration self-defense and a relationship with
[2:30:07.960 --> 2:30:13.560]  god but now more than ever you need to get your storeable food orders in now we're ready to ship
[2:30:13.560 --> 2:30:18.920]  to you within 24 hours of your order it's high quality it's very very low cost at info or store
[2:30:18.920 --> 2:30:23.880]  dot com because in the future you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see
[2:30:23.880 --> 2:30:28.920]  food supply price increases that are already taking place so lock in your storeable food now at a
[2:30:28.920 --> 2:30:35.640]  lower price and fund the info war at infowarstore.com that's how you fight the great reset is by being
[2:30:35.640 --> 2:30:40.440]  self-sufficient and not under their control so get prepared now at infowarstore.com
[2:30:42.040 --> 2:30:49.800]  there is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class not in communist
[2:30:49.800 --> 2:30:57.400]  china not in mexico not in the united states not anywhere is there a real study of the planet's
[2:30:57.400 --> 2:31:02.840]  ruling class and that's done by design the large central banks that basically control the planet
[2:31:02.840 --> 2:31:09.080]  will penalize and target any academics that look into say the anglo-american establishment
[2:31:09.080 --> 2:31:13.160]  the fount of the bilberberg group the trilateral commission of the united nations the whole project
[2:31:13.160 --> 2:31:19.160]  of the ross shawls and the roganfels until 10 years ago the media said the control corporate media
[2:31:19.160 --> 2:31:24.120]  that the bilberberg group didn't exist well now the bilberberg group is public in its former head
[2:31:24.120 --> 2:31:29.720]  show on the steering committee is claus schwaab and he has set up the great reset at global
[2:31:29.720 --> 2:31:35.640]  government and if as a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the globalist head on about the
[2:31:35.640 --> 2:31:40.200]  second figure of worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover we don't have a shot we do expose them
[2:31:40.200 --> 2:31:45.160]  we can beat them easily just a week ago we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion
[2:31:45.160 --> 2:31:50.440]  back in stock and it was only half of the order we wanted to get but because we won't cut corners

[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:46.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:32:56.840 --> 2:33:08.680]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:33:08.680 --> 2:33:13.640]  dr peter mccullough is in studio we were asking him to come on via skype he said hey i'll just
[2:33:13.640 --> 2:33:19.160]  help my car and drive down from my old hometown dallas so here he is with us in the info wars
[2:33:19.160 --> 2:33:24.920]  new studio so doc you wanted to continue with the vaccines not working uh why they thought
[2:33:24.920 --> 2:33:29.400]  you'd send in something that makes your body create a spike protein explain what they thought
[2:33:29.400 --> 2:33:34.120]  this would do because i looked at all these other studies where they tried to make vaccines for the
[2:33:34.120 --> 2:33:40.280]  cold or for sars in animals and it killed most of them and so what do we expect now these vaccines
[2:33:40.280 --> 2:33:45.400]  to do over time if we've seen so much bad reactions i mean that's a whole other subject so just
[2:33:46.200 --> 2:33:51.880]  tackle whatever you want okay the hope was uh that small amount of genetic material messenger RNA
[2:33:51.880 --> 2:33:59.720]  adenoviral DNA in the arm it basically injects new genetic material into some local cells in the
[2:33:59.720 --> 2:34:05.240]  arm produces the spike protein locally gets immunity that was the perfect story what we've
[2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:11.240]  learned is lipid nanoparticles go everywhere there were the papers from china uh years ago
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:14.840]  showing these lipid nanoparticles go everywhere they go into the brain they go into the heart
[2:34:14.840 --> 2:34:18.920]  they're designed to pierce things they go into reproductive they're taken up because their lipids
[2:34:18.920 --> 2:34:23.480]  they're taken up by reproductive organs that are producing steroid based hormones and what we've
[2:34:23.480 --> 2:34:29.000]  learned is a they go everywhere uh the japanese knew this uh when visor came with their application
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:33.240]  the japanese said you know we don't believe you it doesn't stay in the arm show us where it goes
[2:34:33.240 --> 2:34:38.440]  the visor had to do a biodistribution study in animals go back and show them when the lipid
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:43.080]  nanoparticles go they hyper concentrate in in the animal ovaries we assume the same thing
[2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:47.720]  is true in humans that's not good news for women by the way i saw the the the data sheet
[2:34:47.720 --> 2:34:53.480]  from the chemical companies they say not for human ingestion that type of lipid oil particle
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:34:58.680]  it's been modified with polyethylene glycol which makes it a little bit more stable in the human
[2:34:58.680 --> 2:35:03.240]  so antifreeze makes it better antifreeze well you know polyethylene glycol is used in other cosmetic
[2:35:03.240 --> 2:35:08.280]  products but but what you but the listeners need to know is these are brand new technologies
[2:35:08.280 --> 2:35:13.320]  and unfortunately everything we've learned about them since the time they've been released has been
[2:35:13.320 --> 2:35:19.240]  bad a they're distributed everywhere b this spike protein is expressed on cell surfaces the body
[2:35:19.240 --> 2:35:24.680]  attacks our own cells the spike protein breaks free circulates for two weeks now a recent basic
[2:35:24.680 --> 2:35:31.400]  science study done in china shows the vaccine itself in animals directly causes the myocarditis
[2:35:31.400 --> 2:35:35.400]  it causes the inflammation that's here a heart doctor so you can really speak to that and i've
[2:35:35.400 --> 2:35:41.240]  seen cases of this it's basically the heart basically goes on fire it becomes inflamed as it's
[2:35:41.240 --> 2:35:45.560]  expressing spike protein locally and having spike protein delivered to heart muscle cells
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:50.200]  it's not supposed to be there the heart does not like it the heart you need it to beat all the beats
[2:35:50.200 --> 2:35:53.960]  of your life it doesn't like it i'll tell you another organ doesn't like it is the brain
[2:35:53.960 --> 2:35:59.400]  and so when we have local spike production in spike protein production in the brain we're asking
[2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:05.960]  for trouble and the FDA agrees so now the FDA FDA has warnings on phison moderna for myocarditis
[2:36:05.960 --> 2:36:12.200]  broad warnings on j&j has warnings regarding the neurologic system for Guillain-Barre as well as
[2:36:13.400 --> 2:36:18.200]  blood clots and in fact all of them through spike protein production cause blood clots the final
[2:36:18.200 --> 2:36:24.200]  common pathway in terms of death in COVID-19 is actually due to micro blood clots in the lungs
[2:36:24.200 --> 2:36:29.400]  the last thing we need is a vaccine that causes blood clots and i say the final thing that is
[2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:35.160]  really disturbing is that a recent paper shows an interaction between the spike protein and two
[2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:41.320]  cancer producing genes one is BRCA well known for breast cancer and other female cancers
[2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:47.080]  and the other one p53 which is the tumor suppressor gene spike protein interacts with these
[2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:52.760]  uh in a way that could be oncogenic now the company skipped all the cancer uh
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:58.280]  tritogenicity oncogenicity mutagenicity studies and even in the um a conditional approval of slow
[2:36:58.280 --> 2:37:03.800]  down doc to talk to us like we're five years old explain wow connected to cancer the slow down
[2:37:03.800 --> 2:37:10.440]  it tells what mutagenic means the theory is that if the spike protein occurs over a prolonged
[2:37:10.440 --> 2:37:16.520]  period of time based on the basic science data it could be cancer promoting and why is this concerning
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:21.640]  because we have shot one shot two now it's being proposed shot three and four if these continue
[2:37:21.640 --> 2:37:27.560]  to those are called insults that well it's just it's more induction of spike protein which is
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:33.320]  gonna cause trouble in the human body it doesn't look good why did they say a year ago in england
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:37.000]  when the shot started eight months ago when it started here oh don't worry if your uterus swells
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:41.880]  ever you have bleeding or if you get lymph nodes swell up or and just tell your doctor it's no big
[2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:47.080]  deal that looks like cancer but then they rush them in and it's like stage four roger stone's wife
[2:37:47.080 --> 2:37:53.080]  got the Pfizer huge things swell up two weeks later under her arm lymphomic i mean right there it's
[2:37:53.080 --> 2:37:57.640]  doing a bunch of weird stuff what's happening my interpretation i've been called in these cases too
[2:37:57.640 --> 2:38:02.520]  i don't think the vaccine is causing those cancers but it's causing the inflammation in the reaction
[2:38:02.520 --> 2:38:07.240]  that makes the cancer evident and our radiologists we're telling this because after a woman takes
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:11.960]  the vaccine in the arm it distorts the breast tissue and lymph nodes enough where the mammogram
[2:38:11.960 --> 2:38:17.240]  becomes difficult to read and so probably these ovarian cases uterine and breast cancer cases
[2:38:17.240 --> 2:38:21.800]  it's really an issue of discovery so this inflammation the spike protein causes makes it
[2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:26.520]  clinically apparent what about the bleeding like 80 year old women getting menstrual bleeding
[2:38:26.520 --> 2:38:32.120]  after the shots well it makes sense that the idea is the spike protein is distributed to the uterus
[2:38:32.120 --> 2:38:36.600]  as well as the ovaries invariably there's going to be some changes in female hormones all we need
[2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:41.560]  is a little relative estrogen withdrawal progesterone dominance and then we have uterine bleeding
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:48.280]  in layman's terms well the bottom line is the vaccine is causally related to these menstrual
[2:38:48.280 --> 2:38:53.880]  abnormalities wow uh please continue i mean i gotta ask questions but you've you've you've got so
[2:38:53.880 --> 2:38:59.320]  much to say well the big news is if the vaccines are failing and they clearly are and we're getting
[2:38:59.320 --> 2:39:05.560]  calls every day more and more people who are either partially fully vaccinated getting COVID-19
[2:39:05.560 --> 2:39:10.200]  we need to reduce the risks of hospitalization and death we've been through two administrations
[2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:15.560]  we have not seen a team of qualified doctors running the show who have experienced in treating
[2:39:15.560 --> 2:39:22.040]  COVID-19 and reducing these events if we can actually have this illness survivable in the home
[2:39:22.040 --> 2:39:26.360]  it's going to be rough but if we survive in the home and don't require hospitalization and don't
[2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:31.560]  die we actually have a victory and that takes called sequence multi-drug therapy for COVID-19
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:36.040]  that's what i published in the american journal medicine in august of 2020 reviews and cardiovascular
[2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:41.800]  medicine in december 2020 that is the basis of the home treatment guide that is fully supported by
[2:39:41.800 --> 2:39:48.440]  the association of american physician insurgents the truth for health organization very similar to
[2:39:48.440 --> 2:39:52.280]  the frontline critical care consortium they have additional protocols and the american frontline
[2:39:52.280 --> 2:39:56.600]  doctors what america needs to know is we have four major organizations one of them which has
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:40:02.520]  a chapters in every state in america supporting early treatment and america should look to these
[2:40:02.520 --> 2:40:09.000]  treatment organizations and not be chilled by the messaging that's coming down through major media
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:14.680]  as well as some of our government agencies which basically imply don't treat the illness i can
[2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:19.960]  tell you it is a giant mistake in a high-risk person to not treat yeah why would they say last
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:24.520]  year this year oh just stay at home so you can't breathe and their answer is put a tube down your
[2:40:24.520 --> 2:40:29.800]  throat when when when my parents were deathly ill and as soon as we got them on the oral steroids
[2:40:29.800 --> 2:40:38.440]  the inhalable steroids the ivermectin and the corsetin and aspirin and my dad was on oxygen
[2:40:38.440 --> 2:40:43.400]  he was like in the low 80s the next day he was putting chairs together that got delivered and
[2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:49.080]  was he was like 80 percent better the next day 90 percent the next day i mean it was miraculous
[2:40:49.640 --> 2:40:54.120]  well that's what it takes what you you know i just provided commentary on the national tv
[2:40:54.120 --> 2:40:59.480]  about joe rogan joe rogan got on and said listen i got the sequence combination and i said listen
[2:40:59.480 --> 2:41:03.960]  that's how i drew it up for america and it wasn't just me i had 57 authors and we said listen we've
[2:41:03.960 --> 2:41:07.800]  got to treat this problem we use a combination for folks who don't know you were one of the original
[2:41:07.800 --> 2:41:11.320]  folks that brought up that protocol that's been adopted by a lot of people thank god i mean i'm
[2:41:11.320 --> 2:41:16.360]  the first author of the two major peer review publications that brought this to the world
[2:41:16.360 --> 2:41:21.960]  the most widely used protocols in the world and it involves drugs that reduce the replication of
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:27.800]  the virus early it involves drugs that influence and reduce inflammation called cytokine storm
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:32.200]  and then lastly thrombosis or blood cutting when people die every autopsy has ever been done on
[2:41:32.200 --> 2:41:37.400]  someone with COVID-19 in the end the lungs are filled with blood clots and what people need to know
[2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:42.840]  is we need drugs to influence all three phases of the illness not a single drug is a cure
[2:41:44.200 --> 2:41:48.840]  wow and and so many hospitals are doing it having great success they're having it all over the world
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:54.200]  the japanese scientists the head of their union in tokyo says 100 success give early they have
[2:41:54.200 --> 2:41:59.480]  all the african numbers but then you and others all get demonized i guess this big pharma doesn't
[2:41:59.480 --> 2:42:04.040]  want any competition well there's a variety of stakeholders and the thing that's most disturbing
[2:42:04.040 --> 2:42:13.000]  is we had um national institutes of health staffers fda staffers and major media basically say that uh
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:19.640]  there are no there's no evidence for ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine and that there's no support
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:25.160]  for early treatment and it's just the opposite hydroxychloroquine 280 supportive studies dozens
[2:42:25.160 --> 2:42:30.040]  of clinical trials clearly works when it's you hold on doc stay there this is amazing this is so
[2:42:30.040 --> 2:42:36.520]  incredibly important check out his website american out loud america out loud dot com the dash
[2:42:36.520 --> 2:42:42.600]  macula ads report we'll be right back even more than trump michael indell has been out there exposing
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:49.000]  the fact of the 2020 election was stolen and his symposium was amazing 90 plus percent of the
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:54.920]  information was accurate and was damning and was groundbreaking a few poison pills a few pieces of
[2:42:54.920 --> 2:43:00.120]  this info were slipped in to try to discredit the whole thing folks i'm surprised the conference
[2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:05.640]  even happened they had infiltrators and others that really disrupted it and tried to shut it down
[2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:11.640]  because mike lindell is over the target and you're over the target when you support his important
[2:43:11.640 --> 2:43:16.520]  investigation that is every americans right to do to contest an election if you think that there
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:21.080]  were issues look what the democrats have done over the years and he's continuing his investigations
[2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:25.560]  and continuing his work so it's more important than ever to support what he's doing at my fellow
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:32.440]  dot com and to support info awards at the same time with promo code alex up to 66 off on hundreds of
[2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:38.920]  amazing made america products at my pillow dot com promo code alex so check it out today i've been
[2:43:38.920 --> 2:43:45.400]  fighting as hard as i can for almost 28 years against the globalist i wanted to stop their agenda
[2:43:45.400 --> 2:43:50.840]  i wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational
[2:43:50.840 --> 2:43:56.200]  but we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting caught flatfooted but they are
[2:43:56.200 --> 2:44:02.840]  going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset and that's why it's more important
[2:44:02.840 --> 2:44:08.040]  than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people
[2:44:08.040 --> 2:44:12.280]  are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[2:44:12.280 --> 2:44:16.440]  and trying to stop their agenda and we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number
[2:44:16.440 --> 2:44:20.520]  one things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the best food ready to ship at very
[2:44:20.520 --> 2:44:26.040]  important prices at info or store dot com so whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or

[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:47:15.520]  Hey, you know who that is, Dr. Peter McCullough, it's somebody that our little bird told me
[2:47:15.520 --> 2:47:20.200]  is a big fan of you, Eric Clapton, well what do you think of what happened to him?
[2:47:20.200 --> 2:47:25.800]  Well, you know Eric's a terrific guy and he is making the point that medical freedom
[2:47:25.800 --> 2:47:29.800]  really matters, and we need medical freedom not only in terms of choosing a vaccine or
[2:47:29.800 --> 2:47:34.000]  not, understanding the risks and benefits, but also early treatment, and as I was mentioning
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:39.440]  hydroxychloroquine well supported and still in mainstay in front line in so many countries,
[2:47:39.440 --> 2:47:44.520]  huge surge in hydroxychloroquine last spring in 2020, and then there was a giant effort
[2:47:44.520 --> 2:47:49.200]  to suppress hydroxychloroquine, guess what we're seeing this year, ivermectin, ivermectin,
[2:47:49.200 --> 2:47:53.400]  a drug that's very useful in treating COVID-19, 61 supportive studies, 31.
[2:47:53.400 --> 2:47:57.600]  Talk about, because if you go to the NIH website, they say you're not a horse, don't take it,
[2:47:57.600 --> 2:48:02.240]  but then you type in studies, ivermectin, they're almost all positive as antiviral,
[2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:05.200]  so explain what it is, why they're suppressing and what it does.
[2:48:05.200 --> 2:48:10.680]  This is really important, ivermectin works to reduce the entry of the virus into the
[2:48:10.680 --> 2:48:15.060]  nucleus of the human cell, but it's the only drug we also have that antagonizes the effect
[2:48:15.060 --> 2:48:20.600]  of the spike protein, the dangerous spine on the ball of the virus, and ivermectin is
[2:48:20.600 --> 2:48:25.720]  versatile in terms of almost all the outpatient and inpatient studies are positive in terms
[2:48:25.720 --> 2:48:31.200]  of reducing mortality, and the courts agree, there are so many cases in America where there's
[2:48:31.200 --> 2:48:36.840]  a loved one in the hospital suffering with COVID-19, they're not getting a good treatment,
[2:48:36.840 --> 2:48:40.560]  they're not getting ivermectin, the families go to the courts and demand ivermectin, Ralph
[2:48:40.560 --> 2:48:45.360]  Lorego is the lead attorney on most of these cases, and the judges give an order to tell
[2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:47.740]  the doctors to give ivermectin.
[2:48:47.740 --> 2:48:49.240]  That's just amazing.
[2:48:49.240 --> 2:48:53.200]  Can you imagine going to the court to demand high quality care for a loved one, yet it's
[2:48:53.200 --> 2:48:56.880]  happening across the United States, but what happened in the last few days is there was
[2:48:56.880 --> 2:49:02.500]  a messaging campaign that came out from the staffers at the NIH and FDA that ivermectin
[2:49:02.500 --> 2:49:07.400]  is a horse dewormer, that they claim that there was no evidence in using treatment for
[2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:13.760]  COVID-19, they claimed that there was an overrun of calls to the National Poison Control Center
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:19.360]  on this, in fact there was even false claims of hospitals coming in with safety events,
[2:49:19.360 --> 2:49:23.800]  while Trousite News led by Daniel Conner recently broke the story, they went to the National
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:28.320]  Poison Control Center and said what's going on, turns out they had over a thousand calls,
[2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:34.280]  zero deaths, there was a few issues of concern that the poison control center helped out
[2:49:34.280 --> 2:49:38.680]  on, the vast majority of calls were simply dose or administrative related calls because
[2:49:38.680 --> 2:49:39.680]  ivermectin-
[2:49:39.680 --> 2:49:43.560]  And it turns out that that story and the rolling stone they had to retract it, nobody
[2:49:43.560 --> 2:49:49.080]  in the hospital stick with ivermectin, none of it was true, no backlogs, no gunshot victims
[2:49:49.080 --> 2:49:54.520]  not getting help, it was all a giant lie, and even racial mad-out and the London Guardi
[2:49:54.520 --> 2:49:57.680]  and others have not retracted yet, though rolling stone has.
[2:49:57.680 --> 2:50:03.160]  And those media individuals and the government representatives, in my view, are costing American
[2:50:03.160 --> 2:50:04.160]  lives.
[2:50:04.160 --> 2:50:09.720]  This isn't a joke, they're costing American lives, the ivermectin is part of our approved
[2:50:09.720 --> 2:50:14.080]  protocols supported by four major societies, in fact the Association of American Physicians
[2:50:14.080 --> 2:50:19.240]  and Surgeons fired off a letter to the AMA basically saying listen shut down this messaging
[2:50:19.240 --> 2:50:24.440]  because you're hurting Americans, we're costing lives and unneeded hospitalizations, Japan
[2:50:24.440 --> 2:50:30.200]  and so many first world countries use ivermectin frontline in sequence multi-drug therapy.
[2:50:30.200 --> 2:50:34.000]  I just can't believe rolling stone retracted it and said okay nobody was sick, it was all
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:38.920]  made up, but racial mad-out and others as of showtime, hundreds of publications will
[2:50:38.920 --> 2:50:41.960]  not retract it, they're still saying this, this is going to kill people.
[2:50:41.960 --> 2:50:47.520]  Well misinformation put out by government officials, NIH and FDA staffers, and then
[2:50:47.520 --> 2:50:52.760]  parroted by major media is hurting Americans, hurting Americans worldwide.
[2:50:52.760 --> 2:50:59.320]  This idea that we have high quality sequence multi-drug therapy, we talked about the antivirals,
[2:50:59.320 --> 2:51:04.120]  we actually have monoclonal antibodies, we use Regeneron antibodies, we've seen former
[2:51:04.120 --> 2:51:08.480]  President Trump, Joe Rogan, Governor Abbott, everyone received these antibodies.
[2:51:08.480 --> 2:51:12.120]  We had staff members that were super sick, couldn't breathe, instead of going to the
[2:51:12.120 --> 2:51:16.240]  hospital, they got Regeneron five to six hours later, 100% better, that sounds like
[2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:17.240]  a miracle.
[2:51:17.240 --> 2:51:21.040]  Well listen, when I came down here and testified in the Texas Senate, I fried the Department
[2:51:21.040 --> 2:51:25.960]  of Health and Human Services, I said where are these antibodies, where's the 1-800 number,
[2:51:25.960 --> 2:51:26.960]  how does it-
[2:51:26.960 --> 2:51:27.960]  As you're saying there's 500 million doses.
[2:51:27.960 --> 2:51:32.800]  There's 500 million pre-purchase doses, now Lily the Bamliva Mab is no longer effective,
[2:51:32.800 --> 2:51:36.680]  but we have Regeneron and other products, and the bottom line is Americans need to demand
[2:51:36.680 --> 2:51:39.960]  this, and if it's given earlier, patients do better.
[2:51:39.960 --> 2:51:43.800]  And don't play around with this folks, I mean I've had experience with the Delta, it's
[2:51:43.800 --> 2:51:44.800]  not fine.
[2:51:44.800 --> 2:51:48.200]  Exactly, and I guess to tell you what, the antibodies, we follow it up with a sequence
[2:51:48.200 --> 2:51:50.880]  of other drugs, really important is steroids.
[2:51:50.880 --> 2:51:55.840]  We can use Inhalbuidesanide, Innovator Richard Bartlett, the West Texas Maverick, he was
[2:51:55.840 --> 2:52:00.880]  the first one to show this, he was on national TV, they later on called him a snake oil salesman.
[2:52:00.880 --> 2:52:05.840]  Two randomized trials support his idea, Richard Bartlett was right all along about Inhalbuidesanide.
[2:52:05.840 --> 2:52:06.840]  Not Dr. Bartlett.
[2:52:06.840 --> 2:52:08.240]  Yeah, terrific guy.
[2:52:08.240 --> 2:52:12.760]  We have oral steroids and prednisone works fine, dexamethasone is probably a bad choice
[2:52:12.760 --> 2:52:13.760]  by the British.
[2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:18.320]  We use prednisone in our protocols, and the bottom line is Colchicine, show by the Canadians,
[2:52:18.320 --> 2:52:22.880]  the largest clinical trial in all of COVID-9, the Co-Corona trial, show Colchicine, give
[2:52:22.880 --> 2:52:27.320]  them for 30 days, reduce the risk, Colchicine, a gout drug, in combination with these other
[2:52:27.320 --> 2:52:32.600]  drugs work, nobody gives a word to this, this is a 4,000 patient, double-blind randomized
[2:52:32.600 --> 2:52:33.800]  placebo-controlled trial.
[2:52:33.800 --> 2:52:38.560]  The highest quality science that we have in COVID-19 is with Colchicine, and our government
[2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:40.480]  staffers will make no mention of it.
[2:52:40.480 --> 2:52:43.360]  All right, let's talk about this.
[2:52:43.360 --> 2:52:47.160]  You're right, the vaccine failure is the biggest news, and I think they do all along, and other
[2:52:47.160 --> 2:52:54.600]  kinds of crap people in endless shots in Ropadote, but what about having the number one and number
[2:52:54.600 --> 2:53:00.600]  two head virologist, head vaccine experts at the FDA quit last week, the UK scientists
[2:53:00.600 --> 2:53:04.720]  didn't quit, they said, we're not giving this to under 16s, and Europe's saying we're not
[2:53:04.720 --> 2:53:08.720]  going to give the booster shot, it's not going to work.
[2:53:08.720 --> 2:53:14.040]  That is all the regulatory people in the EU, the UK, and the US turning against the governments,
[2:53:14.040 --> 2:53:21.520]  but now Boris Johnson and the EU head, and also, I guess LeGron's her name, and Biden
[2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:25.200]  are saying we don't care, we're going ahead, whatever happened to trust the science.
[2:53:25.200 --> 2:53:31.760]  So what does it say when the pro-vaccine vaccine experts over the government agencies say this
[2:53:31.760 --> 2:53:35.320]  is political and this is wrong, oh, and by the way, we didn't really authorize these
[2:53:35.320 --> 2:53:39.000]  vaccines, we did another emergency authorization, that sounds like some serious covering the
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  ass.
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:44.480]  But we've actually got malfeasance, and that's wrongdoing by those in position of authority.
[2:53:44.480 --> 2:53:49.520]  We have leading scientists say, listen, shut this down, Dr. Tess Lowry, who leads the evidence-based
[2:53:49.520 --> 2:53:56.280]  consulting group in the UK, the lead consulting group to the WHO in May put forward her recommendation
[2:53:56.280 --> 2:54:02.040]  based on the yellow card system to the MHRA, shut down the program, not appropriate for
[2:54:02.040 --> 2:54:07.240]  human use, not safe for human use, and then we move forward, when August 23rd, what happened
[2:54:07.240 --> 2:54:12.920]  is the FDA, with the Pfizer-BioNTech meeting, there was no briefing booklet, where's the
[2:54:12.920 --> 2:54:13.920]  briefing booklet?
[2:54:13.920 --> 2:54:18.000]  There's normally a briefing booklet from the sponsor, one done by the FDA, no advisory
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:24.680]  panel, no public citizen comment, basically behind closed doors, Pfizer does not get approved,
[2:54:24.680 --> 2:54:30.800]  it actually gets continuation of the EUA, there is a switch and bait, where now BioNTech
[2:54:30.800 --> 2:54:34.560]  gets conditional approval of commonality, but it's illegally distinct, maybe medicinally
[2:54:34.560 --> 2:54:39.240]  distinct entity, yet doesn't exist in the United States, that gets conditional approval
[2:54:39.240 --> 2:54:44.240]  with a whole litany of myocarditis studies, they have to be done post-marketing, the talking
[2:54:44.240 --> 2:54:49.040]  point that comes out of the meeting is that Pfizer is FDA approved, it's not, that talking
[2:54:49.040 --> 2:54:52.920]  point goes all the way up to the President of the United States, and there's a whole
[2:54:52.920 --> 2:54:57.560]  wave of vaccine mandates, what happened on August 23rd was probably one of the biggest
[2:54:57.560 --> 2:55:00.280]  examples of regulatory malfeasance of all time.
[2:55:00.280 --> 2:55:06.400]  Wow, and again, a talking point now becomes the lie that it's approved and they order
[2:55:06.400 --> 2:55:13.960]  the military to take it, that is beyond, beyond sensational, that is just so crazy.
[2:55:13.960 --> 2:55:19.280]  And beyond that, Dr. Gruber, one of the two senior FDA officials who resigned, the one
[2:55:19.280 --> 2:55:24.360]  who signed the letter to commonality for the conditional approval to BioNTech, she's one
[2:55:24.360 --> 2:55:27.960]  of the ones who resigned seven days later.
[2:55:27.960 --> 2:55:30.480]  What do you make of those resignations?
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:36.400]  I think in a busy regulatory cycle where there's briefing booklets, where there are applications,
[2:55:36.400 --> 2:55:42.400]  a lot of data, listen, I do this, I've testified for the FDA, I've been on day safety monitoring
[2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:48.160]  boards, I've been the lead consultant for companies, I can tell you in the big regulatory
[2:55:48.160 --> 2:55:53.400]  cycle like this, the last thing you need is people leaving, and when they do, it's a sign
[2:55:53.400 --> 2:55:55.680]  of things going bad.
[2:55:55.680 --> 2:56:01.520]  That's right, it's, well, they said that we were not consulted and it shouldn't be politicians
[2:56:01.520 --> 2:56:05.200]  making this decision, and they also said, why is the CDC making the decisions?
[2:56:05.200 --> 2:56:07.560]  We are the cabinet level agency, which is true.
[2:56:07.560 --> 2:56:11.560]  There's going to be a lot of shame and a lot of guilt on people's shoulders when they look
[2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:16.440]  back in history, and I think that's what these regulators are thinking of.
[2:56:16.440 --> 2:56:19.440]  We're going to do 30 more minutes to the next hour, you're so gracious to be here, doctor.
[2:56:19.440 --> 2:56:21.240]  What are we going to cover next hour?
[2:56:21.240 --> 2:56:24.360]  We're going to pick up on the issue of how to move forward in the pandemic.
[2:56:24.360 --> 2:56:28.960]  I think it's really important because this has to end at some point in time, and I can
[2:56:28.960 --> 2:56:30.960]  help you guide things forward.
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:33.840]  All right, tell people the best place to find your show.
[2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:37.480]  Go to America Out Loud Talk Radio and look for the McCullough Report.
[2:56:37.480 --> 2:56:42.680]  I put out a weekly podcast with a write-up, and importantly, I'm going outside the United
[2:56:42.680 --> 2:56:46.560]  States to talk to experts all over the world regarding the pandemic, because one thing you'll
[2:56:46.560 --> 2:56:51.280]  never see on mainstream media is no window to the outside world on how they're handling
[2:56:51.280 --> 2:56:52.280]  COVID-19.
[2:56:52.280 --> 2:56:55.040]  All right, amazing, we'll be right back.
[2:56:55.040 --> 2:56:59.200]  Remember, infowars.com, and our hundreds of radio stations and all of this cannot be
[2:56:59.200 --> 2:57:00.200]  on air without your support.

[2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:07.400]  aren't buying stuff in Asia and Africa and Eastern Europe.
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:08.400]  That's fine.

[2:57:24.120 --> 2:57:25.120]  Stay with us.
[2:57:25.120 --> 2:57:26.120]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome.
[2:57:26.120 --> 2:57:27.120]  Go ahead.
[2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:28.120]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:57:28.120 --> 2:57:29.120]  Good.
[2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:30.120]  Great last caller.
[2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:31.120]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[2:57:31.120 --> 2:57:32.120]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore, with all the gaslighting, the moralization,
[2:57:32.120 --> 2:57:33.120]  and absurdity.
[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:34.120]  It's like we're living at a twilight zone.
[2:57:34.120 --> 2:57:35.120]  All right.
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:36.120]  Eric's in New Hampshire.
[2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:37.120]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[2:57:37.120 --> 2:57:38.120]  Go ahead.
[2:57:38.120 --> 2:57:39.120]  Hey, Alex.
[2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:40.120]  Thanks for calling.
[2:57:40.120 --> 2:57:41.120]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:57:41.120 --> 2:57:42.120]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:43.120]  Good.
[2:57:43.120 --> 2:57:44.120]  How's it going, Alex?
[2:57:44.120 --> 2:57:45.120]  Good.
[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:46.120]  Great last caller.
[2:57:46.120 --> 2:57:49.720]  Eric's in New Hampshire, Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[2:57:49.720 --> 2:57:50.720]  Hey, Alex.
[2:57:50.720 --> 2:57:51.720]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:57:51.720 --> 2:57:54.720]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the product.
[2:57:54.720 --> 2:57:55.720]  The X2 does wonders.
[2:57:55.720 --> 2:57:56.720]  They recommend it to everybody.
[2:57:56.720 --> 2:57:57.720]  You're on the fence about it.
[2:57:57.720 --> 2:57:58.720]  Get off the fence.
[2:57:58.720 --> 2:57:59.720]  Get the product.
[2:57:59.720 --> 2:58:00.720]  Support the info wars.
[2:58:00.720 --> 2:58:01.720]  Tyler in Maine.
[2:58:01.720 --> 2:58:02.720]  You're on the year.
[2:58:02.720 --> 2:58:03.720]  Thanks for holding.
[2:58:03.720 --> 2:58:04.720]  Go ahead.
[2:58:04.720 --> 2:58:05.720]  Hey, Alex.
[2:58:05.720 --> 2:58:06.720]  It's great to be on with you.
[2:58:06.720 --> 2:58:07.720]  It's an honor.
[2:58:07.720 --> 2:58:08.720]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[2:58:08.720 --> 2:58:09.720]  Awesome.
[2:58:09.720 --> 2:58:12.720]  So, firstly, I wanted to do is say I love the product, alpha power, even at 29.
[2:58:12.720 --> 2:58:14.720]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[2:58:14.720 --> 2:58:16.720]  All right, it helps in the bedroom.
[2:58:16.720 --> 2:58:18.720]  So, just number one for a few years.
[2:58:18.720 --> 2:58:19.720]  I think that only works.
[2:58:19.720 --> 2:58:20.720]  It's not a joke.
[2:58:20.720 --> 2:58:21.720]  Absolutely.
[2:58:21.720 --> 2:58:32.420]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[2:58:32.420 --> 2:58:34.480]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[2:58:34.480 --> 2:58:39.720]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[2:58:39.720 --> 2:58:40.720]  But we failed.
[2:58:40.720 --> 2:58:42.720]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[2:58:42.720 --> 2:58:44.720]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed.
[2:58:44.720 --> 2:58:50.720]  But they are going ahead with their full operational, deindustrialization, great reset.
[2:58:50.720 --> 2:58:54.920]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[2:58:54.920 --> 2:58:59.520]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:58:59.520 --> 2:59:02.520]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda.
[2:59:02.520 --> 2:59:04.520]  And we've also got to get personally prepared.
[2:59:04.520 --> 2:59:07.520]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[2:59:07.520 --> 2:59:12.320]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:12.320 --> 2:59:17.320]  So whether it's a month or six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[2:59:17.320 --> 2:59:22.320]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[2:59:22.320 --> 2:59:25.320]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[2:59:25.320 --> 2:59:45.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:45.320 --> 2:59:47.320]  All right, Dr. Peter McCullough is here.
[2:59:47.320 --> 2:59:51.320]  He helped write the first big protocol that's saved millions of lives around the world.
[2:59:51.320 --> 2:59:56.320]  And he's here with us right now, americaoutlaw.com.
[2:59:56.320 --> 3:00:02.320]  You wanted to finish up with what it means.
[3:00:02.320 --> 3:00:07.320]  I guess when the captain abandoned shipped the US regulators to head people over the vaccine program,
[3:00:07.320 --> 3:00:12.320]  number one, number two, 40 plus years, 45 years together, leaving and saying,
[3:00:12.320 --> 3:00:14.320]  we disagree with the boosters.
[3:00:14.320 --> 3:00:18.320]  We don't want to give it to under 16s and you overwrote us and we're out of here.
[3:00:18.320 --> 3:00:21.320]  I mean, that is a sign the wheels came off, right?
[3:00:21.320 --> 3:00:29.320]  Yeah, the wheels definitely came off at the FDA division of virology and vaccine products division.
[3:00:29.320 --> 3:00:35.320]  But importantly, I think it's really a telltale of what's going on there in terms of regulatory malfeasance.
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:40.320]  And what I mean by that is that even the conditional approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech,
[3:00:40.320 --> 3:00:45.320]  the 30 microgram shot of messenger RNA, was all based on legacy data.
[3:00:45.320 --> 3:00:50.320]  Meaning the old variants, the original Wuhan variant, the alpha beta and gamma variant,
[3:00:50.320 --> 3:00:52.320]  there was no delta variant data.
[3:00:52.320 --> 3:00:59.320]  And I told you we are at 99.1% delta, which Pfizer and the new camaraderie vaccine don't cover
[3:00:59.320 --> 3:01:01.320]  or certainly don't cover adequately enough.
[3:01:01.320 --> 3:01:04.320]  So how in the world can they possibly approve boosters?
[3:01:04.320 --> 3:01:09.320]  And that probably was the reason why they're walking off is they had a legacy data approval,
[3:01:09.320 --> 3:01:11.320]  which is really no longer applicable.
[3:01:11.320 --> 3:01:16.320]  It's just a conditional approval for BioNTech, which doesn't exist in the United States.
[3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:20.320]  And now boosters, which are just at this point in time not feasible.
[3:01:20.320 --> 3:01:22.320]  Dr, what do you expect to come out of this scandal?
[3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:27.320]  I mean, we think OxyCottons big, we think FinFins big, we think Bayer and the blood scandal is big.
[3:01:27.320 --> 3:01:30.320]  This looks like a hundred times bigger than all those combined to me.
[3:01:30.320 --> 3:01:36.320]  Well, I'm told that a blockbuster drug is a billion dollars a year in its first year of revenue.
[3:01:36.320 --> 3:01:42.320]  Pfizer right now is at, I think, from Fortune and another major business magazine, 33 billion.
[3:01:42.320 --> 3:01:44.320]  So this is the biggest blockbuster ever?
[3:01:44.320 --> 3:01:46.320]  This is the biggest one ever.
[3:01:46.320 --> 3:01:50.320]  And it's really been on the backs of Americans and people around the world.
[3:01:50.320 --> 3:01:53.320]  You know, we've had over 600,000 Americans lose their lives.
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:57.320]  We know that those who have been admitted to the hospital and those who died,
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:02:00.320]  the majority died in the hospital, they receive no early treatment.
[3:02:00.320 --> 3:02:04.320]  And there's been a suppression of early treatment that I think has been very intentional
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:09.320]  by a whole variety of stakeholders in order to prepare the population to receive the vaccine
[3:02:09.320 --> 3:02:11.320]  in the sense to be saved by the vaccine.
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:18.320]  And what they're learning now is the vaccine doesn't work well enough in everyone to prevent hospitalization or death.
[3:02:18.320 --> 3:02:23.320]  And everything you've been saying for a year and a half has been vindicated, it's been proven, it's come true.
[3:02:23.320 --> 3:02:24.320]  And oh, you don't want to talk about it.
[3:02:24.320 --> 3:02:27.320]  You said that's a condition of the interview and I'm not going to break comments on that.
[3:02:27.320 --> 3:02:32.320]  But you work for a major healthcare provider and they're suing you because in your own private life,
[3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:35.320]  you're speaking up and going on Tucker Carlson, that's preposterous.
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:43.320]  You know, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingram, you and others, reach out to me for my opinions.
[3:02:43.320 --> 3:02:47.320]  And the U.S. Senate did. Multiple individuals, both in the House and the Senate,
[3:02:47.320 --> 3:02:52.320]  I can tell you, stakeholders all over the world reach out to me and people in my circles.
[3:02:52.320 --> 3:02:56.320]  Why? Because they want a second opinion. What goes on in medicine?
[3:02:56.320 --> 3:03:00.320]  We get second opinions all the time. Doctors work in teams.
[3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:06.320]  What we're not seeing on national TV and we're not seeing from our agencies is we're not seeing teamwork.
[3:03:06.320 --> 3:03:10.320]  You're supposed to have a science question-question debate and that's how you get better answers.
[3:03:10.320 --> 3:03:16.320]  That's right. In fact, in one of the newspapers after this lawsuit was levered at me,
[3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:22.320]  one of the local newspapers in Dallas, they accused me of being a vaccine skeptic.
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:27.320]  A vaccine skeptic. Well, I'm going to tell you, as a scientist and a doctor, I'm a skeptic on everything.
[3:03:27.320 --> 3:03:32.320]  And I think it's good to be a skeptic on. If I was going to have heart surgery, I'm going to talk to people and go get ratings.
[3:03:32.320 --> 3:03:36.320]  And I'm going to go to the top guy like you or somebody. I mean, that's being skeptical is normal.
[3:03:36.320 --> 3:03:42.320]  Being skeptical is normal. I'm not going to go down to South America and do it in the back of a van.
[3:03:42.320 --> 3:03:49.320]  And it's very important to be fair balance. And what I said in the most recent post on the McCullough Report is this.
[3:03:49.320 --> 3:03:56.320]  The vaccine program has been out for eight months and the report card on the vaccines is overdue.
[3:03:56.320 --> 3:04:02.320]  And what I mean by that is, come on, we've had half of Americans take one of these vaccines.
[3:04:02.320 --> 3:04:09.320]  Our agencies have not told us which vaccine is the winner, which one's the loser, which one's holding up the bus, which one's the safest.
[3:04:09.320 --> 3:04:12.320]  How can we actually give a vaccine and have a good outcome?
[3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:16.320]  In fact, now they've got articles everywhere like this one out of Yahoo News.
[3:04:16.320 --> 3:04:21.320]  For scientists, half the COVID end game remains uncertain. They're just not telling us anything.
[3:04:21.320 --> 3:04:26.320]  It's all just a big mess. They're saying, just give us more power. Give us more control. Have a vaccine passport.
[3:04:26.320 --> 3:04:32.320]  Let us control you. We'll be back with two more segments with our amazing guests. Stay with us.
[3:04:36.320 --> 3:04:40.320]  Just a week ago, we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock.
[3:04:40.320 --> 3:04:43.320]  And it was only half of the order we wanted to get.
[3:04:43.320 --> 3:04:49.320]  But because we won't cut corners on the quality of what goes into it, the factory can only get limited supply.
[3:04:49.320 --> 3:04:51.320]  So again, it was half the order we wanted.
[3:04:51.320 --> 3:04:56.320]  But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off, so everybody on the fence will get it.
[3:04:56.320 --> 3:04:59.320]  It's critical for your immune system and your whole body.
[3:04:59.320 --> 3:05:04.320]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals, and a bunch of key amino acids at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:04.320 --> 3:05:11.320]  So while supplies last until it runs out, we're selling it for 33% off, and it'll be months until more comes in.
[3:05:11.320 --> 3:05:16.320]  So get yours today at infowarstore.com, because it's not just a great product.
[3:05:16.320 --> 3:05:19.320]  We need those funds to keep operating as well. We're all in it occasionally, too.
[3:05:19.320 --> 3:05:25.320]  But we have another great product, hair and beard formula, that's really a great multivitamin mineral system.
[3:05:25.320 --> 3:05:30.320]  That's one of the best multivitamin mineral systems out there. It's just called hair and beard.
[3:05:30.320 --> 3:05:47.320]  So get that as well for your immune system. It's great for women, great for children, but it's designed for men in infowarstore.com.
[3:06:00.320 --> 3:06:04.320]  All right, we have Dr. Peter McCullough in the studio with us, one of the main leaders in the last year and a half,
[3:06:04.320 --> 3:06:10.320]  exposing this whole fraud completely vindicated, and you wanted to get into boosting our body's natural defenses,
[3:06:10.320 --> 3:06:16.320]  but also early treatment with this situation. And I want to get your predictions.
[3:06:16.320 --> 3:06:19.320]  We've already seen mutations and escaped mutants. The media makes jokes.
[3:06:19.320 --> 3:06:26.320]  Jones says it's going to turn us into mutants. No, mutant viruses, mutant stuff being released by these vaccines.
[3:06:26.320 --> 3:06:32.320]  I just read the science. You can explain it to us. What can we expect of new variants or what's coming next?
[3:06:32.320 --> 3:06:37.320]  And what can we expect in the studies I've seen of the Pfizer shot particularly lowering immunity?
[3:06:37.320 --> 3:06:43.320]  Is it true that it's turning off killer T's? And then we have this spin that the hospitals are full of unvaccinated.
[3:06:43.320 --> 3:06:46.320]  But when I go look at the real numbers, that's not what's happening.
[3:06:46.320 --> 3:06:51.320]  There's a new article on infowarstore.com, whistleblower nurses exposed media's false pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[3:06:51.320 --> 3:06:56.320]  They say, no, we're seeing the hospitals filled with the vaccinated like we see in Israel.
[3:06:56.320 --> 3:06:58.320]  That's true. What's causing it, doctor?
[3:06:58.320 --> 3:07:07.320]  Yeah, well, on the way down here, driving from Dallas to Austin, there was a billboard saying 91% of hospitalized patients are unvaccinated.
[3:07:07.320 --> 3:07:11.320]  Now, why in the world would hospitals blow money on a billboard for that?
[3:07:11.320 --> 3:07:13.320]  Don't they have better things to spend their money on?
[3:07:13.320 --> 3:07:24.320]  I can tell you the CDC and its own data from June by Havers and colleagues have shown that 23.4% of those hospitalized have been partially or fully vaccinated.
[3:07:24.320 --> 3:07:32.320]  By CDC data in June, I can tell you in July and August, it's going to be more, a greater proportion of those in the hospital are vaccinated.
[3:07:32.320 --> 3:07:40.320]  And again, you're saying in India, I know they've admitted that, that Delta came from a group of vaccinated people. Explain the mechanism.
[3:07:40.320 --> 3:07:46.320]  So we always have variants. I want people to understand this. So Delta has always been there, as well as Ada and Alpha Beta.
[3:07:46.320 --> 3:07:49.320]  And they basically pick the Greek alphabet. So they've always been there.
[3:07:49.320 --> 3:08:00.320]  But when we apply a non-lethal pressure and evolutionary pressure, the virus that can best survive in the vaccinated people is going to move forward.
[3:08:00.320 --> 3:08:07.320]  And that's Delta. And what we know now from two studies, one from Chow and then one from Louis from Guizhan.
[3:08:07.320 --> 3:08:13.320]  Chow was from Ho Chi Minh City. Louis was from Guizhan, China. And then also from Farenholt in Houston.
[3:08:13.320 --> 3:08:28.320]  They've all showed that fully vaccinated individuals can carry in their nose and mouth about 251 to 1,000 fold increased viral load of Delta compared to other variants in the pre-vaccination era.
[3:08:28.320 --> 3:08:34.320]  So what I'm telling you is that vaccinated are super spreaders, if you will, of the Delta variant.
[3:08:34.320 --> 3:08:41.320]  Wow, that is so amazing. People are going to know more about this. You explained it, but just a little bit more how that works.
[3:08:41.320 --> 3:08:56.320]  Because, again, I'm not a doctor, but bottom line, I was reading about this Merrick's disease in chickens where they give them vaccines for the bird flu that's very similar to SARS and COVID, according to what they're saying, correct me if I'm wrong.
[3:08:56.320 --> 3:09:05.320]  And that over time, when they get vaccinated four or five times, suddenly it creates a virus that's super and kills 95 to 100 percent.
[3:09:05.320 --> 3:09:13.320]  Then they've got to give them a super vaccine that stops that, but then the bird always has it and is, quote, leaking, and then you have to just kill the whole flock.
[3:09:13.320 --> 3:09:16.320]  Now, is that apples and oranges or is that kind of what you're talking about?
[3:09:16.320 --> 3:09:26.320]  Well, it's partly interwoven and supportive. You know, I did a seminar with Dr. Geert van den Bosch on CoVexit on the platform. You can go find it.
[3:09:26.320 --> 3:09:30.320]  And, you know, he used to work for Gates Foundation. He warned of this. This is before the vaccines.
[3:09:30.320 --> 3:09:43.320]  He said, listen, the vaccines are going to, in a sense, promote a little mini petri plate and that the antibodies, the weak antibodies that are raised by the vaccines are going to allow a resistant virus to be held in the nose and mouth
[3:09:43.320 --> 3:09:48.320]  and then have a vaccinated person become a spreader. And that's exactly what we're seeing with Delta.
[3:09:48.320 --> 3:09:55.320]  It's interesting that Delta is hitting the younger people. All the seniors, you know, we have 75 percent of people over 65 in America took the vaccine.
[3:09:55.320 --> 3:10:01.320]  So it's the seniors who, in a sense, are passing Delta to the younger individuals. We have, you know, several studies now.
[3:10:01.320 --> 3:10:07.320]  So when Mitt Romney says it's the unvaccinated or hurting him and assaulting him, that's not what the science shows. It's Mitt Romney.
[3:10:07.320 --> 3:10:16.320]  In fact, yeah, it was just the opposite. I mentioned a paper from Keener and colleagues from UC California and San Diego in the health system.
[3:10:16.320 --> 3:10:25.320]  You're better off being unvaccinated. If you were a patient and you were looking at that New England General Medicine paper, you'd rather have an unvaccinated nurse than a vaccinated nurse.
[3:10:25.320 --> 3:10:32.320]  All right. I asked you this. You got a little bit into how we're going to get the solutions and immunity and early treatment right now.
[3:10:32.320 --> 3:10:40.320]  But before you go, I heard about 15 minutes again. Where do you expect this to go now that's clearly failed? It's falling apart.
[3:10:40.320 --> 3:10:48.320]  They're trying to cover it up. They're saying three shots, four shots, five shots, seven shots. I mean, it just it's it's it's crazy how this is falling apart in front of our eyes.
[3:10:48.320 --> 3:10:50.320]  And their answer is just keep doubling down.
[3:10:50.320 --> 3:11:01.320]  We have to follow leading organizations. You know, Cleveland Clinic published a paper and colleagues that looked at unvaccinated, naturally immune people, people who had COVID-19 and recovered.
[3:11:01.320 --> 3:11:09.320]  And they went back into the workplace. They had plenty of COVID ambiently in the Cleveland Clinic, 2,500 workers, zero infections.
[3:11:09.320 --> 3:11:18.320]  You can't get COVID-19 twice. There hasn't been a bona fide case of someone who had PCR antigen and sequencing to kind of prove two separate illnesses.
[3:11:18.320 --> 3:11:27.320]  Now, people get COVID-19. They can test intermittently positive afterward for months. Most health care systems, including mine, do not test somebody to come back to work.
[3:11:27.320 --> 3:11:33.320]  Why? Because the tests are always positive for months afterwards. So there's a myth out there that you can get COVID over and over again.
[3:11:33.320 --> 3:11:41.320]  The bottom line is just like SARS-CoV-1 chickenpox. It's one and done. Natural immunity is robust, complete and durable.
[3:11:41.320 --> 3:11:48.320]  And the path forward is to recognize the naturally immune like they're doing in the city, state of Monaco and probably elsewhere, like the Cleveland Clinic.
[3:11:48.320 --> 3:11:51.320]  The Cleveland Clinic is not having vaccine mandates.
[3:11:51.320 --> 3:12:01.320]  That's my next question. How crazy is it to have the Surgeon General, through you see the clip, say natural immunity is not as good as the vaccine immunity when all the studies show the opposite?
[3:12:01.320 --> 3:12:03.320]  I mean, he knows that's not true.
[3:12:03.320 --> 3:12:15.320]  He must know it's not true. And also our head of the National Immunology Division has said that. So Surgeon General, we've had two high ranking officials who probably have never seen a COVID-19 patient themselves.
[3:12:15.320 --> 3:12:21.320]  They're not probably licensed and capable of taking care of a COVID-19 patient. But having said that, they should be looking at the data.
[3:12:21.320 --> 3:12:29.320]  There's 15 studies showing natural immunity is robust, complete and durable, far superior, infinitely superior to vaccine immunity.
[3:12:29.320 --> 3:12:35.320]  If the CDC has thousands of vaccine failures on the website, they don't have a single failure of natural immunity.
[3:12:35.320 --> 3:12:42.320]  Any American is going to know that the vaccine immunity is simply not durable.
[3:12:42.320 --> 3:12:53.320]  Well, I knew by biology classes 7th grade that natural immunity is better than vaccine immunity. I don't know how they get up on TV and say that.
[3:12:53.320 --> 3:12:59.320]  I think they're going to be embarrassed when historians look back on this. And there's going to be plenty of documentaries on it.
[3:12:59.320 --> 3:13:08.320]  There's going to be a load of embarrassment. One of the reasons why I'm so careful when I come on TV with you, Alex and others, is I cite the literature because I don't want historians to go back and say,
[3:13:08.320 --> 3:13:16.320]  Makala said something that was absolutely crazy. Everything I'm saying is grounded in the science. I'm personally COVID recovered.
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:23.320]  I had the Alpha variant. I was in an FDA-approved research protocol. I took hydroxychloroquine as part of FDA-approved research.
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:33.320]  I got through COVID-19. I had pulmonary involvement. I recovered. That was back in October. I can tell you now, in the Delta pandemic, I have come face-to-face with red-hot Delta patients.
[3:13:33.320 --> 3:13:40.320]  No mask or personal protective equipment. I'm at the point I'm doing house calls. And I can tell you, I didn't get Delta.
[3:13:40.320 --> 3:13:44.320]  So the good news is people telling me that you can keep getting reinfected. You think that's wrong.
[3:13:44.320 --> 3:13:47.320]  You can't. In fact, I helped the Sri Lankans.
[3:13:47.320 --> 3:13:50.320]  So that's huge down there move to make us take new vaccines for every variant?
[3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:58.320]  Absolutely not. Once somebody gets through COVID-19, the vaccine has no role. And I've told America, I've been on with Laura Ingram on Ingram Angle saying,
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:05.320]  listen, there's three studies showing if you've already had COVID-19, you take the vaccine, all you do is get side effects at a higher rate.
[3:14:05.320 --> 3:14:13.320]  So the vaccine is absolutely contraindicated in someone who is COVID-recovered. It can only harm them and can't help them.
[3:14:13.320 --> 3:14:20.320]  And obviously the scientists at Bill Gates and Fauci know all this. So why are they up there saying the opposite?
[3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:27.320]  And the FDA knew it. The FDA excluded COVID-recovered, even suspected COVID-recovered, even people who actually missed the original infection
[3:14:27.320 --> 3:14:31.320]  who are antibody or T-detect positive, they should not get the COVID-19 vaccine.
[3:14:31.320 --> 3:14:35.320]  And according to state and federal law, there's no way they can be considered a public health threat.
[3:14:35.320 --> 3:14:39.320]  The vaccine mandates cannot apply to a COVID-recovered patient.
[3:14:39.320 --> 3:14:42.320]  Dr. Peter McCullough is our guest final segment with him.
[3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:45.320]  AmericanOutloud.com.
[3:14:45.320 --> 3:14:57.320]  And everybody should get that weekly show. They should share it. Everybody should take this interview after it's archived. We're live right now.
[3:14:57.320 --> 3:15:03.320]  But this afternoon, when it's a banned on video and free world news.tv, and share it like people's lives depend on it because it does.
[3:15:03.320 --> 3:15:07.320]  That's why they're putting out fake news that thousands are in the hospitals and gunshot wounds.
[3:15:07.320 --> 3:15:13.320]  Pregnant women can't get in. It's a total hoax because this is part of a larger world ID control system.
[3:15:13.320 --> 3:15:17.320]  It's all you and run. It's all come out of Bill Gates and it's got to be stopped.
[3:15:17.320 --> 3:15:22.320]  Final segment, I'm going to really shut up for this and let you get into what you can take to boost your immune system
[3:15:22.320 --> 3:15:27.320]  and what the regimens are for people once they know they've gotten sick with this.
[3:15:27.320 --> 3:15:44.320]  I'm going to play around with this. Dr. Peter McCullough is our guest, infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today.
[3:15:57.320 --> 3:16:09.320]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too.
[3:16:09.320 --> 3:16:16.320]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:16.320 --> 3:16:23.320]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death. You probably already believe that. I certainly do.
[3:16:23.320 --> 3:16:33.320]  So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:33.320 --> 3:16:40.320]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com. No cure or treatments there.

[3:17:09.320 --> 3:17:14.320]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:14.320 --> 3:17:19.320]  I've got the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[3:18:34.320 --> 3:18:43.320]  Do you think it's a bad trait of Mike Lindell that he's so optimistic that he's so positive? No. It's that type of optimism that built this country.
[3:18:43.320 --> 3:18:49.320]  We would have never defeated the British 250 years ago if we didn't have a lot of optimism and we didn't persevere.
[3:18:49.320 --> 3:18:54.320]  George Washington lost most of his major battles, but he kept fighting for six years and finally we won.
[3:18:54.320 --> 3:19:03.320]  Well, Mike Lindell has been fighting as a man in the arena and he's continuing to expose serious issues in the 2020 election. We need to keep him in the fight.
[3:19:03.320 --> 3:19:09.320]  Plus, he's got hundreds of incredible, made in American products, not just pillows, not just towels, not just sheets, not just beds.
[3:19:09.320 --> 3:19:19.320]  And he's got up to 66% off at MyPillow.com with promo code Alex. You get the best deals. It's made America. He's investigating the election.
[3:19:19.320 --> 3:19:27.320]  He's fighting the globalist. He's standing up against force inoculations. His organization is reaching millions of people when you just support it and support info wars.

[3:19:57.320 --> 3:20:00.320]  So what a line. Give it three maybe four days. I bet I'll be fine.
[3:20:00.320 --> 3:20:06.320]  He said, no, you must not. You must wait for the shot. Everybody's got to get it or society stops.
[3:20:06.320 --> 3:20:11.320]  I said, dog, I don't know. Is that all really true? These shots are brand new. They ain't fully approved.
[3:20:11.320 --> 3:20:17.320]  He said, no, you can trust us. It's the latest in science. Never mind the people dying. Just give up their compliance.
[3:20:17.320 --> 3:20:22.320]  I said, dog, you must have me mistaken with someone pliable. I can't trust you if none of these companies are liable.
[3:20:22.320 --> 3:20:29.320]  So I will say the course like a one-way road. Take your vaccine and shove it on the chest. They never say no.
[3:20:29.320 --> 3:20:39.320]  Wow. I haven't seen R.C. Rapper just say no. My buddy Chris Sky on there. You're kind of a, you know, a cool dude there, Dr. Peter McCullough bringing that up.
[3:20:39.320 --> 3:20:48.320]  Well, he's a good guy. I tell you, R.C. Rapper and Chris Sky, they're making a point about medical freedom and how to a young person, none of this makes sense.
[3:20:48.320 --> 3:20:54.320]  Absolutely. All right. The time we've got left, you're going to be on Owen Schreuer and the War Room today. Do you know an hour?
[3:20:54.320 --> 3:20:55.320]  Five o'clock.
[3:20:55.320 --> 3:21:01.320]  Perfect. It's the last hour of the show. Okay. We got eight minutes left. You've got the floor. What to do to boost your immune system?
[3:21:01.320 --> 3:21:04.320]  What to do when you're sick? Do you even wait or do you go on the regimen?
[3:21:04.320 --> 3:21:11.320]  Okay. Boosting the immune system. If everybody can lose a few pounds, get in shape and get ready for COVID.
[3:21:11.320 --> 3:21:15.320]  I know I did last year. I was taking a lot of risks. I was one of the leading doctors treating COVID.
[3:21:15.320 --> 3:21:23.320]  I knew I was going to take a hit. In fact, I did. I survived it. No hospitalization. Everybody, physical fitness is survival of the fetus.
[3:21:23.320 --> 3:21:32.320]  Now, deficient in anything puts you at risk. So why be deficient? Zinc, vitamin D, vitamin C, cursitin or cursitin.
[3:21:32.320 --> 3:21:37.320]  These form a base of nutrition supplements that can help boost your immune system.
[3:21:37.320 --> 3:21:45.320]  Now, prophylaxis. Very important. Singapore has been doing this. Asia, we recently put into the guidelines. Oral and nasal hygiene every day.
[3:21:45.320 --> 3:21:51.320]  Either dilute polydone iodine. Very dilute. A few drops in a glass of water, swish and gargle and spit.
[3:21:51.320 --> 3:21:58.320]  Nose spray or Q-tips. Twice a day reduces the viral contamination in the nose and mouth that can happen.
[3:21:58.320 --> 3:22:05.320]  If iodine allergic, we can use dilute hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite or even regular listerine.
[3:22:05.320 --> 3:22:09.320]  So that's prophylaxis. There are some medical prophylaxis regimens.
[3:22:09.320 --> 3:22:12.320]  I do that every day. You've got a chance when it first starts replicating and knocking out.
[3:22:12.320 --> 3:22:19.320]  Right. And so I learned that from anti-infective dentist Dr. Paul Gossett and is supported by the American Dental Association for other viruses.
[3:22:19.320 --> 3:22:27.320]  And it makes perfect sense. They've been using Asia elsewhere, polydone iodine. The best, very inexpensive to get. Just very dilute.
[3:22:27.320 --> 3:22:30.320]  Just enough to be brown water and that kills the virus.
[3:22:30.320 --> 3:22:37.320]  By the way, we talked about poison control. Another thing I learned about, we talked about ivermectin hydroxyl poison control.
[3:22:37.320 --> 3:22:42.320]  There's actually been more calls to poison control about hand sanitizer than ivermectin.
[3:22:42.320 --> 3:22:49.320]  So just as a talking point, just like a variety of different hand sanitizers work and it doesn't take much to kill the virus.
[3:22:49.320 --> 3:22:56.320]  Once a week, hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis or twice a week, ivermectin prophylaxis also are partially effective.
[3:22:56.320 --> 3:23:05.320]  But I want everyone to know, vaccinated or not, high risk senior, over age 65, early severe symptoms, get a monoclonal antibody infusion.
[3:23:05.320 --> 3:23:11.320]  Call ahead of time, find out what local hospital or urgent care center socks them and be ready to get the infusion.
[3:23:11.320 --> 3:23:16.320]  You come in, it's a one hour infusion, one hour observation, go home and then start the other.
[3:23:16.320 --> 3:23:22.320]  I noticed Delta kind of, everybody I know kind of hit them slow, feel tired, allergies about a day and then your chest starts hurting.
[3:23:22.320 --> 3:23:25.320]  Then you get a headache, a fever and then you can't get out of bed.
[3:23:25.320 --> 3:23:31.320]  Don't wait to that level. I'm telling you, it's so deceptive. Everybody starts out early with mild symptoms.
[3:23:31.320 --> 3:23:34.320]  My patients tell me, Dr. McCullough, I just have a mild case.
[3:23:34.320 --> 3:23:40.320]  And I said, no, you don't. It's mild on the first day. You're going to be flat on your back by day three. Let's get the antibody.
[3:23:40.320 --> 3:23:43.320]  So what I've experienced is what's happened. Day three hit by a truck.
[3:23:43.320 --> 3:23:47.320]  Absolutely. That's the reason why it's called sudden acute respiratory distress syndrome.
[3:23:47.320 --> 3:23:51.320]  So the bottom line is then we move into these after the monoclonal antibodies for high risk.
[3:23:51.320 --> 3:23:56.320]  We move into hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin plus doxycycline or azithromycin.
[3:23:56.320 --> 3:24:01.320]  Then in Helbidescine, oral predisone, oral culturacy.
[3:24:01.320 --> 3:24:09.320]  And very importantly, full dose aspirin, 325 milligrams for 90 days like the Japanese do because there's a late risk of stroke and heart attack.
[3:24:09.320 --> 3:24:11.320]  That's to keep the stuff open.
[3:24:11.320 --> 3:24:13.320]  Yeah, keep the blood from clotting.
[3:24:13.320 --> 3:24:18.320]  And high risk seniors, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, prior blood disorders, cancer, lovinox.
[3:24:18.320 --> 3:24:22.320]  Lovinox injections and milligram per kilogram or oral anticoagulants.
[3:24:22.320 --> 3:24:27.320]  When people die of this illness and the autopsy show is micro blood clots in the lungs.
[3:24:27.320 --> 3:24:32.320]  When the oxygen saturation goes down, that's not time for Remdesivir. That's time for blood thinners.
[3:24:32.320 --> 3:24:37.320]  Why did Fauci recommend Remdesivir when I saw it only had like an 8% effective rate?
[3:24:37.320 --> 3:24:45.320]  Remdesivir is a fairly toxic polymerase inhibitor and it maybe it could have been a good idea for day one.
[3:24:45.320 --> 3:24:49.320]  But the bottom line is the average person comes in the hospital on day 14 to 28.
[3:24:49.320 --> 3:24:53.320]  It's too late for Remdesivir. It's too toxic. It has liver and kidney toxicity.
[3:24:53.320 --> 3:24:56.320]  I've rarely seen a patient get through five days of treatment.
[3:24:56.320 --> 3:25:02.320]  The bottom line is Remdesivir has mixed data. We're much better off treating early at home and not getting into.
[3:25:02.320 --> 3:25:05.320]  Also, what about usually when you're sick, they say stay in bed.
[3:25:05.320 --> 3:25:08.320]  I know that Dr. Bartlett and others said, get people up.
[3:25:08.320 --> 3:25:13.320]  And as soon as I made my folks get up and got them on the treatment, they were like almost better than in a day or two.
[3:25:13.320 --> 3:25:20.320]  Get fresh air. Open the windows. If able to get outside away from others, take the mask off.
[3:25:20.320 --> 3:25:23.320]  Exercise outside. Yvette Lozano and Dallas, I give her a lot of credit.
[3:25:23.320 --> 3:25:26.320]  She ran one of the biggest COVID treatment units outpatient.
[3:25:26.320 --> 3:25:30.320]  She actually has an exercise machine in her office and actually helps blood flow,
[3:25:30.320 --> 3:25:33.320]  even in those who have low oxygen saturation.
[3:25:33.320 --> 3:25:36.320]  If you can do that with supplemental oxygen, get some blood flow through the lungs.
[3:25:36.320 --> 3:25:38.320]  You can have sustained improvement.
[3:25:38.320 --> 3:25:41.320]  So it's key or even if you feel like total crap, you got to get up and walk around.
[3:25:41.320 --> 3:25:42.320]  Absolutely.
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:45.320]  So you lay there like the hospital, say what happens?
[3:25:45.320 --> 3:25:50.320]  Well, what happens there is we have sluggish blood flow through the pulmonary circulation
[3:25:50.320 --> 3:25:53.320]  and the impairment of oxygen exchange worsens.
[3:25:53.320 --> 3:25:56.320]  And we get to the point where some people, they can only lay on their stomachs
[3:25:56.320 --> 3:25:58.320]  because they otherwise can't maintain oxygen saturation.
[3:25:58.320 --> 3:26:00.320]  Let me say one other thing now.
[3:26:00.320 --> 3:26:04.320]  We're very comfortable now with oxygen concentrators at home through medical supply
[3:26:04.320 --> 3:26:08.320]  or even ordering through Amazon, giving oxygen support at home.
[3:26:08.320 --> 3:26:13.320]  So the only real need for the hospital is high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation.
[3:26:13.320 --> 3:26:14.320]  Hopefully it never comes.
[3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:16.320]  In closing, you're amazing, doctor.
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:20.320]  What about the situation with the new booster shot?
[3:26:20.320 --> 3:26:23.320]  And now Israel is saying they're going to give a new shot for Delta.
[3:26:23.320 --> 3:26:26.320]  Will that cause new mutations?
[3:26:26.320 --> 3:26:29.320]  I think the booster shot is going to be progressive side effects.
[3:26:29.320 --> 3:26:31.320]  And we haven't really covered this.
[3:26:31.320 --> 3:26:35.320]  From shot one to shot two, there's an 80-fold increased risk of side effects.
[3:26:35.320 --> 3:26:40.320]  In America, now we've already had 13,000 Americans lose their lives with these vaccines.
[3:26:40.320 --> 3:26:44.320]  We've had 545,000 Americans injured, certified by the CDC.
[3:26:44.320 --> 3:26:49.320]  And each successive shot, I anticipate, will be more and more complications.
[3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:51.320]  We've got a minute and a half left.
[3:26:51.320 --> 3:26:57.320]  Well, I tell you, the decision on taking a vaccine needs to be a free decision.
[3:26:57.320 --> 3:27:03.320]  The decision on a doctor and a patient choosing treatment needs to be a free decision.
[3:27:03.320 --> 3:27:10.320]  We are seeing a loss of freedoms occur through a series of events that's happened worldwide.
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:12.320]  We think things are bad in America.
[3:27:12.320 --> 3:27:19.320]  I tell you, go to Australia, go to Europe, and we see a linkage between the loss of medical freedom,
[3:27:19.320 --> 3:27:25.320]  a series of events that's promoting fear, suffering, hospitalization, and death, and forced vaccination.
[3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:32.320]  That's a clear theme tied to now restrictions, limitations, and loss of personal and financial and economic freedoms.
[3:27:32.320 --> 3:27:37.320]  Sounds like a plan. Sounds like a great reset. Sounds like a depopulation, medical tyranny operation.
[3:27:37.320 --> 3:27:40.320]  Sounds like a dark cloud over the earth right now.
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:42.320]  Now's the time for Americans to show backbone.
[3:27:42.320 --> 3:27:46.320]  It's now's the time for people who love freedom, who want freedom to fight for it.
[3:27:46.320 --> 3:27:51.320]  That's right. AmericaOutloud.com forward slash D dash McCulloch report.
[3:27:51.320 --> 3:27:55.320]  Or just type in Dr. Peter McCulloch and one of the first things that pops up.
[3:27:55.320 --> 3:27:58.320]  There's a lot of attack pieces and a lot of diseases because you're articulate.
[3:27:58.320 --> 3:28:01.320]  You're a research doctor. You've done a great job.
[3:28:01.320 --> 3:28:04.320]  We appreciate your courage and no wonder they want to shut you up.
[3:28:04.320 --> 3:28:06.320]  Well, I say bring it on.
[3:28:06.320 --> 3:28:11.320]  Absolutely. And folks, you can fight back by sharing the archive of this interview.
[3:28:11.320 --> 3:28:16.320]  It's live now. In a few hours, it'll be up at freeworldnews.tv and Bandai Video.
[3:28:16.320 --> 3:28:21.320]  All right. I'm going to come back and talk about the psychological war and air something very special.
[3:28:21.320 --> 3:28:24.320]  And the doctor will be on at five o'clock today on the war room.
[3:28:24.320 --> 3:28:25.320]  So please tune in and share that link.
[3:28:25.320 --> 3:28:28.320]  That's how we win the info war. It's how we save lives. Thank you so much, doctor.
[3:28:28.320 --> 3:28:32.320]  Thank you.
[3:28:32.320 --> 3:28:44.320]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[3:28:44.320 --> 3:28:46.320]  And we're all this together.
[3:28:46.320 --> 3:28:51.320]  And you know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air.
[3:28:51.320 --> 3:28:58.320]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:28:58.320 --> 3:29:03.320]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups and we're still here.
[3:29:03.320 --> 3:29:07.320]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[3:29:07.320 --> 3:29:11.320]  That's why we've got to be taken off air. That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:11.320 --> 3:29:15.320]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still was I free.
[3:29:15.320 --> 3:29:21.320]  You can't have info wars has been proven right me on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:29:21.320 --> 3:29:23.320]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.

[3:29:32.320 --> 3:29:43.320]  In late August, info war saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design
[3:29:43.320 --> 3:29:48.320]  and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:29:48.320 --> 3:29:52.320]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important to have.
[3:29:52.320 --> 3:29:59.320]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with water filtration, self defense and a relationship with God.
[3:29:59.320 --> 3:30:03.320]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in now.

[3:30:13.320 --> 3:30:17.320]  and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[3:30:17.320 --> 3:30:23.320]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infowarstore.com.
[3:30:23.320 --> 3:30:28.320]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.

[3:30:34.320 --> 3:30:36.320]  This headline is not a joke.
[3:30:36.320 --> 3:30:41.320]  This is America in September of 2020.
[3:30:41.320 --> 3:30:49.320]  TC Court sends man to jail for watching conspiracy theory videos online.
[3:30:49.320 --> 3:30:56.320]  Yes, it says the police did a spot check for quote compliance at his home
[3:30:56.320 --> 3:31:02.320]  and found him in his garage watching rumble social media site,
[3:31:02.320 --> 3:31:06.320]  which they say is a conspiracy site.
[3:31:06.320 --> 3:31:11.320]  Also, he admitted to watching Mike Lindell's three-day cyber symposium.
[3:31:11.320 --> 3:31:14.320]  Yes, it was part of the conditions of his bail.
[3:31:14.320 --> 3:31:19.320]  The judge said he could not look at any videos questioning the election.
[3:31:19.320 --> 3:31:20.320]  No joke.
[3:31:20.320 --> 3:31:24.320]  And so they sent the stars into his house and caught him doing it.
[3:31:24.320 --> 3:31:26.320]  So now he's going into solitary confinement.
[3:31:26.320 --> 3:31:32.320]  Communism has come to America, the republic has fallen.
[3:31:32.320 --> 3:31:34.320]  It's always critical. It's always vital.
[3:31:34.320 --> 3:31:38.320]  It's always essential to have enough high quality vitamins and minerals in your body.
[3:31:38.320 --> 3:31:42.320]  That's why essential vitamins and minerals are called essential. You must have them.
[3:31:42.320 --> 3:31:48.320]  But in today's crazy times, it is more important than ever to stay on top of it.
[3:31:48.320 --> 3:31:51.320]  And the vitamin mineral fusion has been sold out for months and months and months.
[3:31:51.320 --> 3:31:54.320]  It's got all the essential vitamins and minerals and amino acids.
[3:31:54.320 --> 3:31:57.320]  It is 33% off while supplies last.
[3:31:57.320 --> 3:32:00.320]  X2's been sold out for a while. It's now back in stock.

[3:32:31.320 --> 3:32:56.320]  Please take action now.
[3:32:56.320 --> 3:33:04.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:04.320 --> 3:33:08.320]  Well, I tell you, it's crazy to be inside the New World Order takeover.
[3:33:08.320 --> 3:33:12.320]  But it's even more crazy to see humanity waking up and fighting back
[3:33:12.320 --> 3:33:14.320]  and the tide starting to turn.
[3:33:14.320 --> 3:33:16.320]  I want to air most of this.
[3:33:16.320 --> 3:33:20.320]  We'll be able to air 90% of it 21 minutes long in this segment and the next.
[3:33:20.320 --> 3:33:26.320]  The masses have never had real freedom.
[3:33:26.320 --> 3:33:28.320]  America has never been perfect.
[3:33:28.320 --> 3:33:33.320]  We've just been starting to reach for it and just starting to imagine it.
[3:33:33.320 --> 3:33:37.320]  So in this segment, the next, and then in the first five minutes,
[3:33:37.320 --> 3:33:42.320]  I guess if they won on the war room or maybe tomorrow I'll air all of it,
[3:33:42.320 --> 3:33:48.320]  we're going to play this mass psychosis how an entire population becomes mentally ill.
[3:33:48.320 --> 3:33:51.320]  This is one of the most important videos I've ever seen.
[3:33:51.320 --> 3:33:52.320]  I sent it to Tucker Carlson.
[3:33:52.320 --> 3:33:53.320]  I sent it to Joe Rogan.
[3:33:53.320 --> 3:33:54.320]  I sent it to Trump.
[3:33:54.320 --> 3:33:56.320]  I sent it to everybody yesterday.
[3:33:56.320 --> 3:33:59.320]  And I just said in all caps, you need to watch this.
[3:33:59.320 --> 3:34:00.320]  It's very, very important.
[3:34:00.320 --> 3:34:01.320]  I'm going to have it posted.
[3:34:01.320 --> 3:34:05.320]  If it hasn't already been posted in the live show feed under our live show today
[3:34:05.320 --> 3:34:08.320]  on infowars.com, we're going to post it under my live feed.
[3:34:08.320 --> 3:34:13.320]  If somebody hadn't done that, please have somebody do that separately.
[3:34:13.320 --> 3:34:17.320]  This is high quality Chiapas mountain coffee.
[3:34:17.320 --> 3:34:21.320]  Naturally crafted, even above organic, handcrafted, handpicked,
[3:34:21.320 --> 3:34:25.320]  but they call it wild, wild source coffee.
[3:34:25.320 --> 3:34:27.320]  I drank this like 15 years ago.
[3:34:27.320 --> 3:34:28.320]  I thought it was the best coffee ever.
[3:34:28.320 --> 3:34:32.320]  I got a connection with the growers association and we sell the same coffee
[3:34:32.320 --> 3:34:37.320]  the whole food sells under another name for about $5 to $10 depending on what's on sale
[3:34:37.320 --> 3:34:41.320]  for the cost that we've never gone up in price on a wake up America coffee.
[3:34:41.320 --> 3:34:46.320]  It's got 4.9 stars, 98% reviews out of 600 plus reviews.
[3:34:46.320 --> 3:34:48.320]  We've got two different types of it.
[3:34:48.320 --> 3:34:49.320]  It really is high quality coffee.
[3:34:49.320 --> 3:34:50.320]  It's very, very affordable.
[3:34:50.320 --> 3:34:52.320]  We only make about 35% on it.
[3:34:52.320 --> 3:34:54.320]  We sell a lot of it to fund ourselves.
[3:34:54.320 --> 3:34:56.320]  Get it at infowars.com.
[3:34:56.320 --> 3:35:00.320]  You heard Dr. McCullough talking about how great iodine is for your whole body.
[3:35:00.320 --> 3:35:04.320]  Well, I use it and it's also good for your immune system, but it's essential.
[3:35:04.320 --> 3:35:07.320]  We have X2 discounted right now, infowars.com.
[3:35:07.320 --> 3:35:09.320]  That sells about the end of vitamin mineral fusion.
[3:35:09.320 --> 3:35:15.320]  33% off that sale is about to end as well because we're going to sell out of it.
[3:35:15.320 --> 3:35:19.320]  And then we've got other items that are going to have to end this weekend before we do sell
[3:35:19.320 --> 3:35:20.320]  out of it.
[3:35:20.320 --> 3:35:25.320]  That's Living Defense Plus, column block, ultimate krill oil, the highest grade of krill oil,
[3:35:25.320 --> 3:35:28.320]  bazobeads, and so much more, infowars.com.
[3:35:28.320 --> 3:35:34.320]  But I'd like to get these guys on and the artists that are involved are just amazing.
[3:35:34.320 --> 3:35:38.320]  And I'm really a big fan of After School, S-K-O-O-L on YouTube.
[3:35:38.320 --> 3:35:42.320]  Don't get me in trouble saying that, but this is really intellectual, really powerful.
[3:35:42.320 --> 3:35:46.320]  The masses have never really been freed, and that's what this is all about.
[3:35:46.320 --> 3:35:50.320]  Because ruling elites use mass spec calls, you can manipulate them.
[3:35:50.320 --> 3:35:53.320]  And now the globalists just want to collapse society and get rid of us.
[3:35:53.320 --> 3:35:59.320]  So we're going to air the report here, go to break, and come back and air most of the rest of it.
[3:35:59.320 --> 3:36:20.320]  Let's see the full thing at infowars.com here at us.
[3:36:30.320 --> 3:36:37.320]  According to the psychologist Carl Jung, the greatest threat to civilization lies not with the forces of nature,
[3:36:37.320 --> 3:36:43.320]  nor with any physical disease, but with our inability to deal with the forces of our own psyche.
[3:36:43.320 --> 3:36:47.320]  We are our own worst enemies, whereas the Latin proverb puts it,
[3:36:47.320 --> 3:37:00.320]  Man is a wolf to man.
[3:37:00.320 --> 3:37:06.320]  In civilization and transition, Jung states that this proverb is a sad yet eternal truism,
[3:37:06.320 --> 3:37:11.320]  and our wolf-like tendencies come most prominently into play at those times of history
[3:37:11.320 --> 3:37:16.320]  when mental illness becomes the norm rather than the exception in a society,
[3:37:16.320 --> 3:37:20.320]  a situation which Jung termed a psychic epidemic.
[3:37:20.320 --> 3:37:28.320]  Indeed, it is becoming ever more obvious, he writes, that it is not famine, not earthquakes, not microbes,
[3:37:28.320 --> 3:37:33.320]  not cancer, but man himself, who is man's greatest danger to man,
[3:37:33.320 --> 3:37:38.320]  for the simple reason that there is no adequate protection against psychic epidemics,
[3:37:38.320 --> 3:37:43.320]  which are infinitely more devastating than the worst of natural catastrophes.
[3:37:43.320 --> 3:37:50.320]  In this video we are going to explore the most dangerous of all psychic epidemics, the mass psychosis.
[3:37:50.320 --> 3:37:53.320]  A mass psychosis is an epidemic of madness,
[3:37:53.320 --> 3:38:00.320]  and it occurs when a large portion of a society loses touch with reality and descends into delusions.
[3:38:00.320 --> 3:38:03.320]  Such a phenomenon is not a thing of fiction.
[3:38:03.320 --> 3:38:09.320]  Two examples of mass psychoses are the American and European witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries,
[3:38:09.320 --> 3:38:12.320]  and the rise of totalitarianism in the 20th century.
[3:38:12.320 --> 3:38:17.320]  During the witch hunts, thousands of individuals, mostly women, were killed,
[3:38:17.320 --> 3:38:23.320]  not for any crimes they committed, but because they became the scapegoats of societies gone mad.
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:26.320]  In some Swiss villages, writes Francis Hill,
[3:38:26.320 --> 3:38:33.320]  there were scarcely any women left alive after the frenzy had finally burned itself out.
[3:38:33.320 --> 3:38:37.320]  When a mass psychosis occurs, the results are devastating.
[3:38:37.320 --> 3:38:42.320]  Jung studied this phenomenon and wrote that the individuals who make up the infected society
[3:38:42.320 --> 3:38:45.320]  become morally and spiritually inferior.
[3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:49.320]  They sink unconsciously to an inferior, intellectual level.
[3:38:49.320 --> 3:38:55.320]  They become more unreasonable, irresponsible, emotional, erratic, and unreliable,
[3:38:55.320 --> 3:38:59.320]  and worst of all, crimes the individual alone could never stand,
[3:38:59.320 --> 3:39:03.320]  are freely committed by the group smitten by madness.
[3:39:03.320 --> 3:39:09.320]  What makes matters worse is that those suffering from a mass psychosis are unaware of what is occurring,
[3:39:09.320 --> 3:39:15.320]  for just as an individual gone mad cannot step out of his mind to observe the errors in his ways,
[3:39:15.320 --> 3:39:23.320]  so, too, there is no Archimedean point from which those living through a mass psychosis can observe their collective madness.
[3:39:23.320 --> 3:39:25.320]  But what causes a mass psychosis?
[3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:30.320]  To answer this question, we must first explore what drives an individual mad.
[3:39:30.320 --> 3:39:36.320]  While there are many potential triggers of madness, such as an excessive use of drugs or alcohol,
[3:39:36.320 --> 3:39:41.320]  brain injuries, and other illnesses, these physical causes will not concern us here.
[3:39:41.320 --> 3:39:46.320]  Our concern is with psychological, or what are called psychogenic triggers,
[3:39:46.320 --> 3:39:50.320]  as these are the most common culprits of the mass psychosis.
[3:39:50.320 --> 3:39:55.320]  The most prevalent psychogenic cause of a psychosis is a flood of negative emotions,
[3:39:55.320 --> 3:40:00.320]  such as fear or anxiety, that drives an individual into a state of panic.
[3:40:00.320 --> 3:40:05.320]  When in a state of panic, an individual will naturally seek relief,
[3:40:05.320 --> 3:40:10.320]  as it is too mentally and physically draining to subsist in this hyper-emotional state.
[3:40:10.320 --> 3:40:14.320]  While escaping from the state of panic can be accomplished through adaptive means,
[3:40:14.320 --> 3:40:18.320]  such as facing up to and defeating the fear-generating threat,
[3:40:18.320 --> 3:40:22.320]  another way to escape is to undergo a psychotic break.
[3:40:22.320 --> 3:40:28.320]  A psychotic break is not a descent into a state of greater disorder, as many believe,
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:33.320]  but a reordering of one's experiential world, which blends fact and fiction,
[3:40:33.320 --> 3:40:38.320]  or delusions and reality, in a way that helps end the feelings of panic.
[3:40:38.320 --> 3:40:43.320]  Silvano Arietti, one of the 20th century's foremost authorities on schizophrenia,
[3:40:43.320 --> 3:40:47.320]  explains the psychogenic steps that lead to madness.
[3:40:47.320 --> 3:40:53.320]  Firstly, there is the phase of panic, when the patient starts to perceive things in a different way,
[3:40:53.320 --> 3:41:01.320]  is frightened on account of it, appears confused, and does not know how to explain the strange things that are happening.
[3:41:01.320 --> 3:41:05.320]  The next step is what Arietti calls a phase of psychotic insight,
[3:41:05.320 --> 3:41:12.320]  whereby an individual succeeds in putting things together by devising a pathological way of seeing reality,
[3:41:12.320 --> 3:41:16.320]  which allows him to explain his abnormal experiences.
[3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:23.320]  The phenomenon is called insight, because the patient finally sees meaning and relations in his experiences.
[3:41:23.320 --> 3:41:27.320]  But the insight is psychotic, because it is based on delusions,
[3:41:27.320 --> 3:41:32.320]  not on adaptive and life-promoting ways of relating to whatever threats precipitated the panic.
[3:41:32.320 --> 3:41:39.320]  The delusions, in other words, allow the panic-stricken individual to escape from the flood of negative emotions.
[3:41:39.320 --> 3:41:43.320]  But at the cost of losing touch with reality, and for this reason,
[3:41:43.320 --> 3:41:50.320]  Arietti says that a psychotic break can be viewed as an abnormal way of dealing with an extreme state of anxiety.
[3:41:50.320 --> 3:41:58.320]  If a panic-triggering flood of negative emotions in a weak and vulnerable individual can trigger a psychotic break,
[3:41:58.320 --> 3:42:04.320]  then a mass psychosis can result when a population of weak and vulnerable individuals
[3:42:04.320 --> 3:42:09.320]  is driven into a state of panic by threats real, imagined, or fabricated.
[3:42:09.320 --> 3:42:15.320]  But as delusions can take many forms, and as madness can manifest in countless ways,
[3:42:15.320 --> 3:42:24.320]  the specific manner in which a mass psychosis unfolds will differ based on the historical and cultural context of the infected society.
[3:42:29.320 --> 3:42:38.320]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first-ever Kavakava root supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:42.320]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today,
[3:42:42.320 --> 3:42:48.320]  though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[3:42:48.320 --> 3:42:54.320]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[3:42:54.320 --> 3:42:58.320]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[3:42:58.320 --> 3:43:04.320]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[3:43:04.320 --> 3:43:09.320]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[3:43:09.320 --> 3:43:15.320]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava-Kava,
[3:43:15.320 --> 3:43:22.320]  but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama-Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Valerian root.
[3:43:22.320 --> 3:43:29.320]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:43:29.320 --> 3:43:34.320]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[3:43:34.320 --> 3:43:36.320]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[3:43:36.320 --> 3:43:41.320]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[3:43:41.320 --> 3:43:44.320]  But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[3:43:44.320 --> 3:43:52.320]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[3:43:52.320 --> 3:43:58.320]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[3:43:58.320 --> 3:44:01.320]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:44:01.320 --> 3:44:04.320]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda,
[3:44:04.320 --> 3:44:06.320]  but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:44:06.320 --> 3:44:09.320]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[3:44:09.320 --> 3:44:14.320]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:44:14.320 --> 3:44:19.320]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[3:44:19.320 --> 3:44:24.320]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.

[3:44:30.320 --> 3:44:33.320]  Let's go back in time, say, to the mid-1990s.
[3:44:33.320 --> 3:44:39.320]  And then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020 where a world government is being established,
[3:44:39.320 --> 3:44:43.320]  where members of Congress and former presidents are censored by big tech,
[3:44:43.320 --> 3:44:50.320]  and where you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood plots and pions all over your body
[3:44:50.320 --> 3:44:54.320]  that you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[3:44:54.320 --> 3:44:56.320]  Think about that, because that's where we are.
[3:44:56.320 --> 3:45:00.320]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago,
[3:45:00.320 --> 3:45:03.320]  if somebody told you this would be happening.
[3:45:03.320 --> 3:45:05.320]  But it is happening now.
[3:45:05.320 --> 3:45:08.320]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy,
[3:45:08.320 --> 3:45:11.320]  and it doesn't really work, so you got to take it every few months.
[3:45:11.320 --> 3:45:18.320]  And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID.
[3:45:18.320 --> 3:45:20.320]  Even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[3:45:20.320 --> 3:45:25.320]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus.
[3:45:25.320 --> 3:45:27.320]  And that's in mainline studies.
[3:45:27.320 --> 3:45:30.320]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[3:45:30.320 --> 3:45:35.320]  Just a week ago, we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock,
[3:45:35.320 --> 3:45:38.320]  and it was only half of the order we wanted to get.
[3:45:38.320 --> 3:45:41.320]  But because we won't cut corners on the quality of what goes into it,
[3:45:41.320 --> 3:45:45.320]  the factory can only get limited supplies, so again, it was half the order we wanted.
[3:45:45.320 --> 3:45:50.320]  But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off, so everybody on the fence will get it.
[3:45:50.320 --> 3:45:54.320]  It's critical for your immune system and your whole body, all the essential vitamins,

[3:46:15.320 --> 3:46:19.320]  hair and beard formula, that's really a great multivitamin mineral system.

[3:46:22.320 --> 3:46:24.320]  It's just called hair and beard.
[3:46:24.320 --> 3:46:26.320]  So get that as well for your immune system.
[3:46:26.320 --> 3:46:42.320]  It's great for women, great for children, but it's designed for men in infowarstore.com.
[3:46:56.320 --> 3:46:59.320]  It's a phenomenon of total centralized state power,
[3:46:59.320 --> 3:47:03.320]  coupled with the obliteration of individual human rights.
[3:47:03.320 --> 3:47:06.320]  In the totalized state, there are those in power,
[3:47:06.320 --> 3:47:11.320]  and there are the objectified masses, the victims.
[3:47:11.320 --> 3:47:16.320]  In a totalitarian society, the population is divided into two groups,
[3:47:16.320 --> 3:47:22.320]  the rulers and the ruled, and both groups undergo a pathological transformation.
[3:47:22.320 --> 3:47:26.320]  The rulers are elevated to an almost god-like status,
[3:47:26.320 --> 3:47:32.320]  which is diametrically opposed to our nature as imperfect beings who are easily corrupted by power.
[3:47:32.320 --> 3:47:39.320]  The masses, on the other hand, are transformed into the dependent subjects of these pathological rulers
[3:47:39.320 --> 3:47:44.320]  and take on a psychologically regressed and child-like status.
[3:47:44.320 --> 3:47:49.320]  Hannah Arendt, one of the 20th century's preeminent scholars of this form of rule,
[3:47:49.320 --> 3:47:55.320]  called totalitarianism an attempted transformation of human nature itself.
[3:47:55.320 --> 3:48:00.320]  But this attempted transformation only turns sound minds into sick minds,
[3:48:00.320 --> 3:48:06.320]  for as the Dutch medical doctor who studied the mental effects of living under totalitarianism wrote,
[3:48:06.320 --> 3:48:19.320]  there is in fact much that is comparable between the strange reactions of the citizens of totalitarianism and their culture as a whole, on the one hand, and the reactions of the sick schizophrenic on the other.
[3:48:19.320 --> 3:48:26.320]  The social transformation that unfolds under totalitarianism is built upon and sustained by delusions,
[3:48:26.320 --> 3:48:32.320]  for only deluded men and women regress to the child-like status of obedient and submissive subjects,
[3:48:32.320 --> 3:48:37.320]  and hand over complete control of their lives to politicians and bureaucrats.
[3:48:37.320 --> 3:48:46.320]  Only a deluded ruling class will believe that they possess the knowledge, wisdom, and acumen to completely control society in a top-down manner,
[3:48:46.320 --> 3:48:54.320]  and only one under the spell of delusions would anyone believe that a society composed of power-hungry rulers, on the one hand,
[3:48:54.320 --> 3:49:02.320]  and a psychologically regressed population on the other, will lead to anything other than mass suffering and social ruin.
[3:49:02.320 --> 3:49:06.320]  But what triggers the psychosis of totalitarianism?
[3:49:06.320 --> 3:49:14.320]  As was explored in the previous video of this series, the mass psychosis of totalitarianism begins in a society's ruling class.
[3:49:14.320 --> 3:49:24.320]  The individuals that make up this class, be it politicians, bureaucrats, or crony capitalists, are very prone to delusions that augment their power,
[3:49:24.320 --> 3:49:32.320]  and no delusion is more attractive to the power-hungry than the delusion that they can and should control and dominate a society.
[3:49:32.320 --> 3:49:40.320]  When a ruling elite becomes possessed by a political ideology of this sort, be it communism, fascism, or technocracy,
[3:49:40.320 --> 3:49:49.320]  the next step is to induce a population into accepting their rule by infecting them with the mass psychosis of totalitarianism.
[3:49:49.320 --> 3:50:00.320]  This psychosis has been induced many times throughout history, and as Mirlu explains, it is simply a question of reorganizing and manipulating collective feelings in the proper way.
[3:50:00.320 --> 3:50:13.320]  The general method by which the members of a ruling elite can accomplish this end is called menticide, with the etymology of this word being a killing of the mind, and as Mirlu further explains,
[3:50:13.320 --> 3:50:19.320]  menticide is an old crime against the human mind and spirit, but systematized anew.
[3:50:19.320 --> 3:50:33.320]  It is an organized system of psychological intervention and judicial perversion through which a ruling class can imprint their own opportunistic thoughts upon the minds of those they plan to use and destroy.
[3:50:33.320 --> 3:50:39.320]  Priming a population for the crime of menticide begins with the sowing of fear.
[3:50:39.320 --> 3:50:49.320]  When an individual is flooded with negative emotions such as fear or anxiety, he or she is very susceptible to a descent into the delusions of madness.
[3:50:49.320 --> 3:50:59.320]  Threats real, imagined, or fabricated can be used to sow fear, but a particularly effective technique is to use waves of terror.
[3:50:59.320 --> 3:51:14.320]  After this technique the sowing of fear is staggered with periods of calm, but each of these periods of calm is followed by the manufacturing of an even more intense spell of fear, and on and on the process goes, or as Mirlu writes,
[3:51:14.320 --> 3:51:26.320]  each wave of terrorizing creates its effects more easily after a breathing spell than the one that preceded it because people are still disturbed by their previous experience.
[3:51:26.320 --> 3:51:37.320]  Morality becomes lower and lower, and the psychological effects of each new propaganda campaign become stronger. It reaches a public already softened up.
[3:51:37.320 --> 3:51:52.320]  While fear primes a population for menticide, the use of propaganda to spread misinformation and to promote confusion with respect to the source of the threats and the nature of the crisis helps to break down the minds of the masses.
[3:51:52.320 --> 3:52:10.320]  Government officials and their lackeys in the media can use contradictory reports, nonsensical information, and even blatant lies, as the more they confuse the less capable will a population be to cope with the crisis and diminish their fear in a rational and adaptive manner.
[3:52:10.320 --> 3:52:27.320]  Confusion, in other words, heightens the susceptibility of a dissent into the delusions of totalitarianism, or as Mirlu explains, logic can be met with logic, while illogic cannot. It confuses those who think straight.
[3:52:27.320 --> 3:52:42.320]  The big lie and monotonously repeated nonsense have more emotional appeal than logic and reason. While the people are still searching for a reasonable counter-argument to the first lie, the totalitarians can assault them with another.
[3:52:42.320 --> 3:53:04.320]  Never before in history have such effective means existed to manipulate a society into the psychosis of totalitarianism. Smartphones and social media, television and the Internet, all in conjunction with algorithms that quickly censor the flow of unwanted information, allow those in power to easily assault the minds of the masses.
[3:53:04.320 --> 3:53:15.320]  What is more, the addictive nature of these technologies means that many people voluntarily subject themselves to the ruling elite's propaganda with a remarkable frequency.
[3:53:15.320 --> 3:53:35.320]  Modern technology, explains Mirlu, teaches man to take for granted the world he is looking at. He takes no time to retreat and reflect. Technology lures him on, dropping him into its wheels and movements. No rest, no meditation, no reflection, no conversation.
[3:53:35.320 --> 3:53:45.320]  The senses are continually overloaded with stimuli. Man doesn't learn to question his world any more. The screen offers him answers. Ready made.
[3:53:45.320 --> 3:53:58.320]  But there is a further step the would-be totalitarian rulers can take to increase the chance of a totalitarian psychosis. And this is to isolate the victims and to disrupt normal social interactions.
[3:53:58.320 --> 3:54:08.320]  When alone and lacking normal interactions with friends, family and co-workers, an individual becomes far more susceptible to delusions for several reasons.
[3:54:08.320 --> 3:54:23.320]  Firstly, they lose contact with the corrective force of the positive example, for not everyone is tricked by the machinations of the ruling elite, and the individuals who see through the propaganda can help free others from the mentocidal assault.
[3:54:23.320 --> 3:54:43.320]  If, however, isolation is enforced, the power of these positive examples greatly diminishes. But another reason that isolation increases the efficacy of menticide is because, like many other species, human beings are more easily conditioned into new patterns of thought and behavior when isolated.
[3:54:43.320 --> 3:55:00.320]  Or as Mirlu explains with regards to the physiologist Yvon Pavlov's work on behavioral conditioning, Pavlov made another significant discovery. The conditioned reflex could be developed most easily in a quiet laboratory with a minimum of disturbing stimuli.
[3:55:00.320 --> 3:55:20.320]  Every trainer of animals knows this from his own experience. Isolation and the patient repetition of stimuli are required to tame wild animals. The totalitarians have followed this rule. They know that they can condition their political victims most quickly if they are kept in isolation.
[3:55:20.320 --> 3:55:30.320]  Alone, confused, and battered by waves of terror, a population under an attack of menticide descends into a hopeless and vulnerable state.
[3:55:30.320 --> 3:55:46.320]  The never-ending stream of propaganda turns minds once capable of rational thought into playhouses of irrational forces. And with chaos swirling around them and within them, the masses crave a return to a more ordered world.
[3:55:46.320 --> 3:55:57.320]  The would-be totalitarians can now take the decisive step. They can offer a way out and a return to order in a world that seems to be moving rapidly in the opposite direction.
[3:55:57.320 --> 3:56:15.320]  But all this comes at a price. The masses must give up their freedom and cede control of all aspects of life to the ruling elite. They must relinquish their capacity to be self-reliant individuals who are responsible for their own lives and become submissive and obedient subjects.
[3:56:15.320 --> 3:56:22.320]  The masses, in other words, must descend into the delusions of the totalitarian psychosis.
[3:56:22.320 --> 3:56:36.320]  The totalitarian systems of the twentieth century represent a kind of collective psychosis, whether gradually or suddenly, reason and common human decency are no longer possible in such a system.
[3:56:36.320 --> 3:56:50.320]  There is only a pervasive atmosphere of terror and a projection of the enemy imagined to be in our midst. Thus society turns on itself, urged on by the ruling authorities.
[3:56:50.320 --> 3:57:01.320]  But the order of a totalitarian world is a pathological order by enforcing a strict conformity and requiring a blind obedience from the citizenry.
[3:57:01.320 --> 3:57:09.320]  Okay, folks, you can see there's like five minutes left. We're going to add it when we post this to Band-Aid video. You can see this is what they've done with the lockdowns. This is what they've done with everything.
[3:57:09.320 --> 3:57:17.320]  This is all a psychological takeover for society to break your will, give you a World ID card, inject you with deadly poison that kills you. This is the takeover to your population.
[3:57:17.320 --> 3:57:26.320]  Even more than Trump, Mike Lindell has been out there exposing the fact that the twenty-twenty election was stolen. And his symposium was amazing.
[3:57:26.320 --> 3:57:36.320]  Ninety-plus percent of the information was accurate and was damning and was groundbreaking. A few poisoned pills, a few pieces of this info were slipped in to try to discredit the whole thing.
[3:57:36.320 --> 3:57:46.320]  Folks, I'm surprised the conference even happened. They had infiltrators and others that really disrupted it and tried to shut it down because Mike Lindell is over the target.
[3:57:46.320 --> 3:57:56.320]  And you're over the target when you support his important investigation that is every American's right to do to contest an election if you think that there were issues.
[3:57:56.320 --> 3:58:08.320]  Look what the Democrats have done over the years. And he's continuing his investigations and continuing his work, so it's more important than ever to support what he's doing at mypillow.com and to support info wars at the same time with promo code Alex.
