[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[00:08.000 --> 00:12.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:19.000 --> 00:24.000]  Welcome my friends, welcome and thank you so much for joining us. We are live.
[00:24.000 --> 00:33.000]  It is the sixth day of June 2010 and we're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.000]  With the abbreviated Sunday broadcast, of course, so we come back weekdays 11am to 3pm central.
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  That's 12 noon to 4pm Eastern. I want to thank everybody for joining us.
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  Three or four days ago huge guest that my producers snagged.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  Now it's all over ABC News, Wall Street Journal, New York Times.
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  They're struggling to spin it but they're not having a lot of success.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  And we've got Deborah Cohen, features editor of the British Medical Journal.
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000]  One of the most, if not the most prestigious medical journal in the world.
[01:11.000 --> 01:18.000]  She'll be joining us coming up in the next hour. World Health Organization and the pandemic flew.
[01:18.000 --> 01:28.000]  And it deals with the fact that they're just confirming what Wolfgang Wudarg of the EU Commission broke here six months ago.
[01:28.000 --> 01:40.000]  That the big vaccine makers paid off government officials in Europe, England and the US to come out in light of the public to scare them into taking the deadly vaccine.
[01:40.000 --> 01:47.000]  And this is now the British Medical Journal and hundreds of other mainstream publications caught red-handed.
[01:47.000 --> 01:55.000]  This is important because before you know it will be another flu season with a biological slash chemical attack being run against free humanity.
[01:55.000 --> 02:02.000]  And we already had record low amounts of people take the seasonal and the H1N1 shot.
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.000]  Both the seasonal and the special flu for this upstart flu that appeared in the wrong hemisphere, wrong time of year.
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.000]  Obviously genetically engineered, designed to scare virologists who looked at it.
[02:16.000 --> 02:29.000]  But they also reported in the major medical journals out of Canada and Europe that people more than doubled their chances of getting the H1N1 if they'd taken the seasonal flu shot.
[02:29.000 --> 02:40.000]  And why is that? Well, it just so happens that they were putting, quote, marker viruses or test attenuated viruses.
[02:40.000 --> 02:48.000]  Simulance was the exact term in the regular seasonal flu shot.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  I mean, I laugh because it's so sickening.
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  There's no end to the depths of the evil that comes from these people.
[02:58.000 --> 02:59.000]  And we had all the documents.
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  We had all the research.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  We had all the experts at the time.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  And a lot of people did listen because record low numbers of people took the regular seasonal.
[03:08.000 --> 03:16.000]  And so you had record low numbers of people with these, quote, novel flu coming down with it.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  And the media got caught lying about deaths.
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  They would take some 85-year-old heart patient who'd had both legs amputated with diabetes.
[03:25.000 --> 03:26.000]  And they would die.
[03:26.000 --> 03:33.000]  And they would just say it was the H1N1 or there'd be some child who'd already had chemotherapy and was on the verge of death.
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  I mean, I saw hundreds of these cases who they would then say died of the H1N1.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  Sometimes they were positive for the H1N1 but were compromised.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  But more often than not, you'd see a month later, oh, that was a false positive.
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  They didn't die of that.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  They had the regular flu.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  The regular flu does kill around 35,000 people a year in North America.
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  So it's not something to play games with.
[03:55.000 --> 04:05.000]  But the problem is in the last seven, eight years that I've seen, they've never guessed the right different combo of mutations of regular seasonal flu.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  Three or four different variants, sometimes more in the shot.
[04:08.000 --> 04:09.000]  They've never guessed it right.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  So it's never protected anyone.
[04:11.000 --> 04:12.000]  It's just completely fake.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  Now, could there be good vaccines for, say, smallpox or polio?
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  Could there be good vaccines for spinal meningitis?
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  Could there be, yes.
[04:22.000 --> 04:30.000]  But you can't trust this elite, 90-plus percent of the vaccines now being made in China, just because they don't care and are sloppy.
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  A, but B, they're a bunch of eugenicists who are always talking about population reduction.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  And they've been caught over and over again, tainting and spiking the vaccine.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  So I already went off the deep end on that rant.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  In about 55 minutes, she'll be joining us.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  We're going to come back and get into all of the incredible news today, my friends.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  This is a very important broadcast.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  Please call your friends and family.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  Tell them to tune in right now on the local AM&FM dial or infowars.com.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  We're also live at principle.tv.
[04:59.000 --> 05:02.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[05:02.000 --> 05:07.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  My answer would be all I can get.
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  Food is your only ammunition.
[05:14.000 --> 05:15.000]  How much do you want?
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.000]  When do you want it?
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  Now or after the battle starts.
[05:18.000 --> 05:19.000]  When will you need it?
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  Will there be any food?
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.000]  Will it make your children sick?
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  How much will you need?
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  We don't know.
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  How much do you want?
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  All you can get.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[05:46.000 --> 05:53.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[06:23.000 --> 06:33.000]  Well, I hope that the live listeners tuning in and people watching this later archived
[06:33.000 --> 06:40.260]  at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv or on YouTube or the Drudge Report, who is now linking
[06:40.260 --> 06:45.760]  to us on a weekly basis for whoever is tuning into the live radio show or for whoever is
[06:45.760 --> 06:48.000]  dialing in to a podcast.
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  I really do hope that you will pay particular attention to today's transmission.
[06:53.000 --> 07:00.000]  We do have Deborah Cohen, features editor of the British Medical Journal, joining us
[07:00.000 --> 07:09.680]  for 30 minutes in the first half of the second hour today because the information that is
[07:09.680 --> 07:16.040]  documented in the British Medical Journal and it's a lengthy report proves conclusively
[07:16.040 --> 07:24.760]  that governments, media and academia and top health officials were paid off by the big
[07:24.760 --> 07:33.040]  vaccine makers to lie and create a mass hoax to scare the public into taking the H1N1 vaccine.
[07:33.040 --> 07:41.720]  So that is coming up today in the first 30 minutes of the second hour.
[07:41.720 --> 07:43.760]  Vital, vital information.
[07:43.760 --> 07:50.840]  Now, in the meantime, let me just mention the stacks of news here I have in front of
[07:50.840 --> 07:51.840]  me.
[07:51.840 --> 07:58.720]  BP chief Tony Hayward sold shares weeks before oil spill, his biggest sale ever.
[07:58.720 --> 08:01.480]  He sold over a third of his stock.
[08:01.480 --> 08:10.360]  Now, you dovetail that with Goldman Sachs dumping 44% and then subsequently even more.
[08:10.360 --> 08:20.040]  Now it's more than half or millions and millions of shares of their BP stock in the days before.
[08:20.040 --> 08:22.480]  Very, very suspicious.
[08:22.480 --> 08:26.880]  We'll be talking about that a little bit later in the transmission today.
[08:26.880 --> 08:34.560]  Also, Israeli forces board Gaza Aidship, the Rachel Corey, she was a activist in Palestine
[08:34.560 --> 08:38.680]  run over by an Israeli bulldozer, that's what the ships named after and they boarded that
[08:38.680 --> 08:41.200]  without any violence, reportedly.
[08:41.200 --> 08:45.960]  So I guess that's a good thing that nobody was hurt.
[08:45.960 --> 08:52.480]  But Israel is certainly having a PR disaster with this worldwide, so we'll get more into
[08:52.480 --> 08:53.480]  that.
[08:53.480 --> 08:58.520]  Obviously, we've had a big victory against the global government.
[08:58.520 --> 09:03.840]  If you went back just five years ago, you might have seen five or six, seven, eight,
[09:03.840 --> 09:09.480]  maybe a dozen mainstream news articles worldwide every year when the Bilderberg group would
[09:09.480 --> 09:10.800]  meet in secret.
[09:10.800 --> 09:16.520]  You go back past a decade ago, I've had the New York Times attack yours truly and say,
[09:16.520 --> 09:20.240]  Bilderberg doesn't exist, I am insane.
[09:20.240 --> 09:22.520]  There is no world government.
[09:22.520 --> 09:25.960]  Elites don't meet.
[09:25.960 --> 09:29.280]  The highest level of power is presidents and prime ministers.
[09:29.280 --> 09:31.400]  Go back to sleep, nothing to see here.
[09:31.400 --> 09:32.400]  Move along.
[09:32.400 --> 09:33.400]  Move along.
[09:33.400 --> 09:35.720]  That's what you're looking for.
[09:35.720 --> 09:39.640]  And now it's in the Wall Street Journal, it's in the New York Times, it's all over the
[09:39.640 --> 09:40.640]  Drudge Report.
[09:40.640 --> 09:45.000]  The Drudge Report is linking to our articles throughout the week when we pointed out that
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.280]  Bill Gates was in attendance and we're just doing our job.
[09:48.280 --> 09:55.320]  It was in the German, the Dutch, and the Swiss as well as the Spanish news that Bill Gates
[09:55.320 --> 09:59.440]  was caught sneaking into the country, got caught by the media and admitted he was there
[09:59.440 --> 10:03.920]  for the Global Government Summit, basically calling for population reduction.
[10:03.920 --> 10:09.360]  He was there calling for global carbon taxes and forced inoculations and things like that.
[10:09.360 --> 10:14.720]  But so I see a confirmed and foreign press that Bill Gates is there and I say, hmm,
[10:14.720 --> 10:18.120]  I think people are going to be interested in the fact that he's scurrying around over
[10:18.120 --> 10:19.120]  there.
[10:19.120 --> 10:23.440]  So, with the Queen of the Netherlands and the representatives of the British royalty
[10:23.440 --> 10:29.920]  and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, I am going to have one of my writers write
[10:29.920 --> 10:31.920]  a article about this.
[10:31.920 --> 10:39.440]  I am going to put a story out and then it gets linked on Drudge and gets conservatively
[10:39.440 --> 10:41.640]  around a million readers.
[10:41.640 --> 10:46.160]  Now, you don't, I mean, you know the mainstream media isn't stupid.
[10:46.160 --> 10:47.840]  They know what the people want.
[10:47.840 --> 10:50.120]  They know the people want to know about these secretive grips.
[10:50.120 --> 10:55.160]  If you had 150 top golfers meeting in secret, there would be 30 or 40 helicopters, fixed
[10:55.160 --> 10:57.640]  wing aircraft, thousands of reporters.
[10:57.640 --> 11:00.680]  They want to know what was going on inside the hotel for four days.
[11:00.680 --> 11:05.160]  If you had 150 of the most powerful people in Hollywood meeting in secret, you'd have
[11:05.160 --> 11:09.480]  scores of helicopters and literally hundreds of reporters.
[11:09.480 --> 11:18.280]  But you get 150 presidents, prime ministers, central bank heads, royalty together and we've
[11:18.280 --> 11:19.280]  broken in.
[11:19.280 --> 11:20.920]  We've stolen documents.
[11:20.920 --> 11:24.480]  We've ferreted it out myself, Jim Tucker and many others.
[11:24.480 --> 11:28.640]  And we come out and say, Obama is going to be the president, Hillary will step down in
[11:28.640 --> 11:30.600]  two days and it happens.
[11:30.600 --> 11:36.880]  Or they're going to attack Iraq in 2003 in March, not in March of 02, as the media was
[11:36.880 --> 11:38.040]  saying they were.
[11:38.040 --> 11:42.040]  Because we literally risk our lives to bring you this type of information.
[11:42.040 --> 11:47.000]  I've been arrested and detained for 15 hours in Canada and that's in the London Guardian.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.120]  They arrested a bunch of people in Spain.
[11:49.120 --> 11:51.200]  We get followed around by men in dark sunglasses.
[11:51.200 --> 11:53.960]  They break into your hotel rooms.
[11:53.960 --> 11:56.800]  Some of the reporters like Tucker have been shot at.
[11:56.800 --> 11:59.280]  This isn't a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:59.280 --> 12:01.760]  Now why am I going over all this?
[12:01.760 --> 12:07.800]  The good news is the electronic Berlin wall is down.
[12:07.800 --> 12:13.920]  And we confirmed from the London Guardians report and they got thrown out by the way
[12:13.920 --> 12:18.840]  on the day the resort was closed, the closing, they were already there and they, he's dropped
[12:18.840 --> 12:21.960]  it overheard the head of the Bilderberg group.
[12:21.960 --> 12:22.960]  That is the head minion.
[12:22.960 --> 12:28.400]  They had organizers and they had badges that said it and I've been inside the start of
[12:28.400 --> 12:29.400]  the Bilderberg.
[12:29.400 --> 12:35.680]  You know, they all do wear the badges, color-coded blue, red, green, black and they were talking
[12:35.680 --> 12:40.960]  about my gosh, you know, Alex Jones bullhorned us in Canada.
[12:40.960 --> 12:43.200]  It was, it was, it was horrifying.
[12:43.200 --> 12:44.440]  He was quite close.
[12:44.440 --> 12:45.440]  Yes.
[12:45.440 --> 12:46.960]  They may be here this year again.
[12:46.960 --> 12:48.360]  Did they attack?
[12:48.360 --> 12:51.400]  No, but oh, they're so scary.
[12:51.400 --> 12:55.560]  And then Tucker confirmed from his inside Bilderberg source, I'll just not a Bilderberg
[12:55.560 --> 13:01.600]  member, but a high level minion that indeed this is the first year in the 50 plus years
[13:01.600 --> 13:04.240]  they've been meeting since, since 1954.
[13:04.240 --> 13:12.080]  So I guess that's 56 years that a large portion of Bilderberg group, top globalists did not
[13:12.080 --> 13:13.920]  come.
[13:13.920 --> 13:15.440]  They did not come.
[13:15.440 --> 13:18.060]  They are scared.
[13:18.060 --> 13:23.440]  When we saw this in 2008, Obama and Hillary pulled in the media kept saying, where are
[13:23.440 --> 13:24.440]  they?
[13:24.440 --> 13:25.440]  They're in a secret meeting.
[13:25.440 --> 13:26.440]  No one knows.
[13:26.440 --> 13:29.520]  They locked up the press corps on Obama's plane and flew him to Chicago.
[13:29.520 --> 13:30.600]  Well we knew where they were going to be.
[13:30.600 --> 13:32.320]  We were at the Bilderberg group meeting.
[13:32.320 --> 13:36.840]  And so here comes Hillary and Obama with the black SUVs and limousines and they got machine
[13:36.840 --> 13:41.680]  guns out the window pointed at us and it's secret service with the, with the flashing
[13:41.680 --> 13:47.120]  police lights and they go in and sure enough, I go talk at the hotel.
[13:47.120 --> 13:50.960]  We were staying at a few miles away to Tucker and he got the phone call and he said, Obama's
[13:50.960 --> 13:51.960]  in.
[13:51.960 --> 13:55.640]  Hillary's going to step down in the next couple of days.
[13:55.640 --> 13:58.080]  You know, she's going to be his secretary of state.
[13:58.080 --> 13:59.480]  And then it was announced.
[13:59.480 --> 14:02.480]  See presidents come and go folks.
[14:02.480 --> 14:05.320]  They're nothing but puppet minions of these people.
[14:05.320 --> 14:08.020]  And so you can throw all the Democrats out in the next election.
[14:08.020 --> 14:13.280]  The Republicans are going to sell you out and you'll throw them out and then they'll put
[14:13.280 --> 14:14.960]  the Democrats back in.
[14:14.960 --> 14:19.040]  What the elite, what the global controllers are scared of is that you're realizing that
[14:19.040 --> 14:21.400]  these people are puppets and bought and paid for.
[14:21.400 --> 14:28.920]  And here is our huge breaking news up on prisonplanet.com and infoawards.com today.
[14:28.920 --> 14:31.840]  Both these stories are exclusives.
[14:31.840 --> 14:35.360]  Bilderberg group green lights attack on Iran.
[14:35.360 --> 14:38.360]  This is some of the intel that Tucker got.
[14:38.360 --> 14:41.600]  They have green lighted the operation.
[14:41.600 --> 14:48.040]  It's actually horrible news and so there's a very good chance this is the first time
[14:48.040 --> 14:52.600]  the majority of them and they have a vote are in favor of striking Iran.
[14:52.600 --> 14:58.200]  Now things may change, but it looks like that's moving forward and Israel's got new capable
[14:58.200 --> 15:02.840]  subs off the coast saying they may nuke Iran at any time and that could start World War
[15:02.840 --> 15:03.840]  III.
[15:03.840 --> 15:07.920]  That key article, Bilderberg's green light attack on Iran is up on prisonplanet.com and
[15:07.920 --> 15:09.040]  infoawards.com.
[15:09.040 --> 15:11.200]  I suggest you read it.
[15:11.200 --> 15:12.200]  Here's another one.
[15:12.200 --> 15:13.200]  Alex Jones.
[15:13.200 --> 15:14.200]  Bilderberg is running scared.
[15:14.200 --> 15:18.760]  That's why they want to start a new war as a political diversion so they can implode
[15:18.760 --> 15:22.680]  Europe and the U.S. financially and bring in their new global carbon tax, their new
[15:22.680 --> 15:27.200]  global VAT tax, which they admit is a, quote, global government.
[15:27.200 --> 15:28.200]  This is the U.N.
[15:28.200 --> 15:30.120]  This is Herman von Rumpia, the head of the E.U.
[15:30.120 --> 15:31.120]  This is mainstream news.
[15:31.120 --> 15:35.200]  We're being conquered right now, but unless they have a war, they're not going to get
[15:35.200 --> 15:36.200]  away with it.
[15:36.200 --> 15:40.200]  And even if they launch a war as a political distraction, they won't get away with it.
[15:40.200 --> 15:45.920]  So that is up on prisonplanet.com and infoawards.com with an accompanying 10-minute special news
[15:45.920 --> 15:50.880]  analysis piece that just went up last night for those that want to get that key info and
[15:50.880 --> 15:51.880]  spread the word.
[15:51.880 --> 15:52.880]  All right.
[15:52.880 --> 15:57.240]  Now, we're hurting them bad, so now they're going to move in and try to censor us.
[15:57.240 --> 15:58.360]  That's coming up next.
[15:58.360 --> 15:59.360]  Stay with us.
[15:59.360 --> 16:00.360]  Hi, folks.
[16:00.360 --> 16:05.840]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[16:05.840 --> 16:10.680]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[16:10.680 --> 16:14.680]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[16:14.680 --> 16:18.880]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[16:18.880 --> 16:24.560]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[16:24.560 --> 16:31.440]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream, with continued
[16:31.440 --> 16:34.880]  legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[16:34.880 --> 16:40.480]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[16:40.480 --> 16:45.760]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[16:45.760 --> 16:51.720]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the
[16:51.720 --> 16:53.320]  Silver Lungs Generator.
[16:53.320 --> 16:59.880]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[16:59.880 --> 17:03.920]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered
[17:03.920 --> 17:04.920]  generator.
[17:04.920 --> 17:08.840]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[17:08.840 --> 17:13.160]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[17:13.160 --> 17:14.480]  allows you to have.
[17:14.480 --> 17:20.200]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[17:20.200 --> 17:24.520]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[17:24.520 --> 17:28.520]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[17:28.520 --> 17:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.680]  Over a year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[17:35.680 --> 17:40.440]  Number five, a solar-powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[17:40.440 --> 17:44.240]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[17:44.240 --> 17:45.640]  one of my old sponsors.
[17:45.640 --> 17:49.880]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[17:49.880 --> 17:51.480]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[17:51.480 --> 17:58.480]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[17:58.480 --> 18:03.960]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[18:03.960 --> 18:08.240]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family
[18:08.240 --> 18:10.280]  owned and operated American company.
[18:10.280 --> 18:15.080]  My family, staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[18:15.080 --> 18:17.720]  these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[18:17.720 --> 18:21.720]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps
[18:21.720 --> 18:22.720]  anywhere.
[18:22.720 --> 18:29.760]  You can find free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com
[18:29.760 --> 18:31.280]  or infowars.com.
[18:31.280 --> 18:35.280]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[18:35.280 --> 18:42.080]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[18:42.080 --> 18:46.080]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[18:46.080 --> 18:57.440]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website, 5starsoap.com, for buying a 1-2 month soap
[18:57.440 --> 18:58.440]  sampler.
[18:58.440 --> 18:59.440]  Thank you.
[18:59.440 --> 19:03.600]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[19:03.600 --> 19:04.600]  Terany is here.
[19:04.600 --> 19:08.720]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[19:08.720 --> 19:11.120]  It really says that the state is God.
[19:11.120 --> 19:15.640]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[19:15.640 --> 19:16.880]  on earth.
[19:16.880 --> 19:21.680]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cams, now being
[19:21.680 --> 19:23.520]  expanded nationwide.
[19:23.520 --> 19:27.800]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[19:27.800 --> 19:29.520]  powerful shadow state.
[19:29.520 --> 19:33.640]  Police state forward chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[19:33.640 --> 19:38.080]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[19:38.080 --> 19:43.920]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[19:43.920 --> 19:47.440]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[19:47.440 --> 19:49.480]  The police state isn't coming.
[19:49.480 --> 19:50.480]  It's here.
[19:50.480 --> 20:20.240]  Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[20:20.240 --> 20:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  The news is so off the charts that I myself have trouble believing it.
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.600]  I myself have trouble facing it.
[20:48.600 --> 20:57.200]  I have seen three new prestigious studies out this week that genetically modified strain
[20:57.200 --> 21:06.560]  of corn, soybeans and also wheat all sterilize close to 100% of the guinea pigs and rats
[21:06.560 --> 21:11.520]  that it's fed to within three generations.
[21:11.520 --> 21:14.560]  And they're also just completely mentally retarded.
[21:14.560 --> 21:22.120]  They have more morbidity five times higher than any other test group in the studies.
[21:22.120 --> 21:24.460]  And this is what humans are being fed.
[21:24.460 --> 21:26.800]  And I've got the folders right here.
[21:26.800 --> 21:31.120]  I've got the GMO folder from this week and I've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[21:31.120 --> 21:39.480]  with their 76 new things they're funding and 30 plus of them are sterilization vaccines.
[21:39.480 --> 21:44.760]  A nanotech vaccine that they just put on somebody's skin and it sterilizes you.
[21:44.760 --> 21:47.200]  This is forced medical tyranny.
[21:47.200 --> 21:49.120]  That's what this whole system is.
[21:49.120 --> 21:51.160]  How do I sit here and calmly talk about this?
[21:51.160 --> 21:54.760]  And then over the years, we've gotten Bilderberg group documents.
[21:54.760 --> 21:58.480]  We've had the maids inside the hotels, you know, you get there before the event, you
[21:58.480 --> 22:00.640]  tell them, look, you're going to have these evil people here.
[22:00.640 --> 22:02.520]  You're not going to be able to look them in the eyes.
[22:02.520 --> 22:03.800]  They're going to treat you bad.
[22:03.800 --> 22:05.960]  We know you're not going to help us now.
[22:05.960 --> 22:11.360]  But after you see how evil they are, steal the minutes, steal their paperwork, you know,
[22:11.360 --> 22:12.360]  give us the information.
[22:12.360 --> 22:15.280]  That's just one way we get the info.
[22:15.280 --> 22:17.280]  And they always say, no way.
[22:17.280 --> 22:20.560]  And then days after the event ends, they go, these people are pure evil.
[22:20.560 --> 22:21.840]  Do you know what they're planning?
[22:21.840 --> 22:23.760]  They're planning to take over the planet.
[22:23.760 --> 22:25.960]  They're planning forced population reduction.
[22:25.960 --> 22:30.280]  Remember the times of London last year from the Bilderberg and then they had a sub meeting
[22:30.280 --> 22:35.400]  in New York headline, global elite meet to discuss overpopulation.
[22:35.400 --> 22:38.520]  And then what did Bill Gates go there this year for?
[22:38.520 --> 22:40.320]  That's all they're into.
[22:40.320 --> 22:45.720]  You have to understand that while the general public is involved in baseball and work and
[22:45.720 --> 22:52.480]  playing golf and taking their kids to music lessons, the elite are into controlling society.
[22:52.480 --> 22:57.120]  The easiest way to describe it is basically like this.
[22:57.120 --> 22:59.600]  The Matrix or the Truman Show.
[22:59.600 --> 23:05.160]  More and more, our lives are literally like the Truman Show where, where all the major
[23:05.160 --> 23:10.400]  decisions are made for us and we're distracted by all these petty things.
[23:10.400 --> 23:14.520]  And it's my job to get you to basically think for yourselves out there.
[23:14.520 --> 23:23.240]  Now, now listen, I've got all the stunning news on North Korea, on the economy.
[23:23.240 --> 23:27.600]  NASA is announcing suddenly that the sun is putting off solar flares that are going
[23:27.600 --> 23:29.560]  to be the greatest threat in human history.
[23:29.560 --> 23:34.280]  How on earth do they know that?
[23:34.280 --> 23:37.720]  They weren't monitoring things a thousand years ago, they weren't doing it a hundred
[23:37.720 --> 23:38.720]  years ago.
[23:38.720 --> 23:44.000]  NASA hasn't been around since the, since the fifties, but very bizarre from NASA, it's
[23:44.000 --> 23:52.160]  up on Drudge Report right now, we're going to be covering that, it's just so strange.
[23:52.160 --> 24:00.760]  It is information overload, but when I read this Washington Times article Friday evening,
[24:00.760 --> 24:07.800]  it really concerned me because I already knew everything in the article and more.
[24:07.800 --> 24:13.000]  And I saw other blogs and news reports about the Washington Times story and, and people
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.920]  saying, oh, it can't be true or, oh, it's not that bad or, oh, you know, this will never
[24:17.920 --> 24:21.800]  happen or, or maybe this is good.
[24:21.800 --> 24:23.360]  And what am I talking about?
[24:23.360 --> 24:25.400]  We have a chance to beat these eugenicists.
[24:25.400 --> 24:29.040]  We have a chance to beat these globalists that want to set up world government.
[24:29.040 --> 24:36.560]  We have a good chance of stopping them if we are able to have alternative media.
[24:36.560 --> 24:41.240]  The alternative media about two years ago, past the Rubicon, national news reported that
[24:41.240 --> 24:45.600]  more people get their news from alternative media and the internet than from mainstream
[24:45.600 --> 24:51.280]  newspapers and TV.
[24:51.280 --> 24:54.940]  So the system is panicking and, and that's accelerating.
[24:54.940 --> 24:58.200]  Now I've seen polls of over 80%.
[24:58.200 --> 24:59.200]  You've seen them as well.
[24:59.200 --> 25:00.480]  It's all over the news.
[25:00.480 --> 25:06.520]  Trust alternative media versus the less than 20% that do trust mainstream media.
[25:06.520 --> 25:09.680]  And so the establishment knows the jig is up.
[25:09.680 --> 25:14.680]  And so that's why Elena Kagan, the White House nominee for Supreme Court has openly written
[25:14.680 --> 25:16.280]  she's anti-free speech.
[25:16.280 --> 25:23.480]  And we've read the quotes in her law school papers where she says we can ban free speech
[25:23.480 --> 25:28.120]  at Harvard and at Chicago at the business school there.
[25:28.120 --> 25:32.520]  And she's a former Goldman Sachs minion, of course, partner.
[25:32.520 --> 25:37.440]  We know Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are on record says put a tax on alternative
[25:37.440 --> 25:42.240]  media and that's the first phase next arrest people that criticize the government and you'll
[25:42.240 --> 25:44.400]  have to have a license federally.
[25:44.400 --> 25:51.920]  That's now being proposed by Michigan, by California, by, I mean, it's happening.
[25:51.920 --> 25:58.800]  So what's scary is the FCC and the Obama White House.
[25:58.800 --> 26:01.740]  And again, they've got all the mainstream media supporting this because the mainstream
[26:01.740 --> 26:03.840]  media is getting their, their behinds kick.
[26:03.840 --> 26:07.800]  Now who is wedded together?
[26:07.800 --> 26:09.560]  What's the battlefield?
[26:09.560 --> 26:13.360]  Internet media, internet news blogs and talk radio.
[26:13.360 --> 26:18.680]  Those are the enemies in the federal announcement I'm about to cover, which is so chilling.
[26:18.680 --> 26:19.760]  And this has all been announced now.
[26:19.760 --> 26:21.400]  I mean, you can go read these federal filings.
[26:21.400 --> 26:25.480]  They are, they, this is what they are going to do and they're doing it real calmly like
[26:25.480 --> 26:26.480]  it's no big deal.
[26:26.480 --> 26:31.440]  Now, now you thought they couldn't take over healthcare with, with a government takeover
[26:31.440 --> 26:33.360]  written by the insurance companies to rip you off.
[26:33.360 --> 26:35.760]  And of course they phase it in over three, four years.
[26:35.760 --> 26:37.160]  So you don't notice it right away.
[26:37.160 --> 26:40.480]  It's like boiling the frog incrementally.
[26:40.480 --> 26:44.120]  You know, you didn't think Obama could spend more than old presidents before him combined
[26:44.120 --> 26:45.720]  in less than a year in office.
[26:45.720 --> 26:50.320]  Now we're a year and a half in and it's, it's even getting worse.
[26:50.320 --> 26:53.400]  You didn't think they'd put it a Supreme Court nominee forward who wants to ban free
[26:53.400 --> 26:55.200]  speech and the second amendment.
[26:55.200 --> 26:57.560]  They're doing it.
[26:57.560 --> 27:00.800]  Stop thinking it can't happen.
[27:00.800 --> 27:05.480]  So you got a perfect storm of government and mainstream media that are being annihilated
[27:05.480 --> 27:06.920]  by the truth.
[27:06.920 --> 27:11.040]  And so they are enemies of two things, the internet and talk radio.
[27:11.040 --> 27:12.040]  Why?
[27:12.040 --> 27:14.520]  Because talk radio, you can call into it.
[27:14.520 --> 27:19.600]  There's a lot of local hosts that are libertarian or constitutional who have transcended the
[27:19.600 --> 27:21.520]  left, right paradigm.
[27:21.520 --> 27:24.720]  What Cass Sunstein calls anti-government conspiracy theorist.
[27:24.720 --> 27:25.880]  You don't believe in global warming.
[27:25.880 --> 27:26.880]  You're going to be arrested.
[27:26.880 --> 27:27.880]  Oh yeah.
[27:27.880 --> 27:30.680]  They're not just going to tax you or shut you down.
[27:30.680 --> 27:36.240]  The White House is announcing they're going to put pop ups by federal law over your website
[27:36.240 --> 27:37.920]  and under cybersecurity.
[27:37.920 --> 27:41.800]  They've already announced it and they're taking control of all ISPs.
[27:41.800 --> 27:47.200]  Any internet service provider that serves a hundred or more people, the smallest ISPs
[27:47.200 --> 27:48.200]  serve more than a hundred.
[27:48.200 --> 27:53.320]  I mean, I've never seen one that smaller than, I mean, everything's being taken over.
[27:53.320 --> 27:54.680]  Federal certification.
[27:54.680 --> 27:59.640]  They're calling it an AmeriCorps where all of the high school kids will have to serve
[27:59.640 --> 28:05.360]  two years out of high school as cyber officers on a power trip, running around with the power
[28:05.360 --> 28:09.960]  to go into your website or onto your talk radio blog and control it.
[28:09.960 --> 28:12.520]  Folks, this is mainstream news.
[28:12.520 --> 28:17.200]  But, see, when I read this Washington Times article, it just brought home that I've already
[28:17.200 --> 28:20.680]  seen all of this from the actual documents and I've been screaming about it for the
[28:20.680 --> 28:26.120]  last year and that now it's all in this Washington Times article boiled down and no one can
[28:26.120 --> 28:27.120]  believe it.
[28:27.120 --> 28:31.360]  Well, you'll believe it when they do it.
[28:31.360 --> 28:32.840]  And this is so un-American.
[28:32.840 --> 28:34.000]  This is so corrupt.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.480]  This is so evil.
[28:35.480 --> 28:40.840]  So I'm going to read this article when we get back, then get into the NASA announcement.
[28:40.840 --> 28:48.320]  It's like something out of the movie, um, knowing.
[28:48.320 --> 28:54.360]  I mean, just unbelievable, bizarre, crazy, uh, the world, we've got volcanoes blowing
[28:54.360 --> 28:58.720]  up, oil spills, they're talking about nuclear war, it's insane.
[28:58.720 --> 29:07.320]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[29:07.320 --> 29:12.320]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[29:12.320 --> 29:21.080]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[29:21.080 --> 29:28.200]  They're so bright in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[29:28.200 --> 29:34.280]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[29:34.280 --> 29:39.280]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[29:39.280 --> 29:46.080]  We turned jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[31:00.200 --> 31:03.280]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[31:03.280 --> 31:07.640]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[31:07.640 --> 31:08.640]  do you want?
[31:08.640 --> 31:10.640]  My answer would be all I can get.
[31:10.640 --> 31:15.640]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[31:15.640 --> 31:16.880]  How much do you want?
[31:16.880 --> 31:17.960]  When do you want it?
[31:17.960 --> 31:21.040]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[31:21.040 --> 31:23.160]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[31:23.160 --> 31:24.520]  Will there be any food?
[31:24.520 --> 31:25.960]  Will it make your children sick?
[31:25.960 --> 31:30.120]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[31:30.120 --> 31:31.280]  and be immunized?
[31:31.280 --> 31:35.040]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[31:35.040 --> 31:38.640]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[31:38.640 --> 31:39.880]  How much will you need?
[31:39.880 --> 31:40.880]  We don't know.
[31:40.880 --> 31:41.880]  How much do you want?
[31:41.880 --> 31:42.880]  All you can get.
[31:42.880 --> 31:43.880]  I'm Alex Jones.
[31:43.880 --> 31:47.040]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[31:47.040 --> 31:54.600]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[31:54.600 --> 31:59.280]  Find that number 1-800-409-5633.
[31:59.280 --> 32:03.920]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[32:03.920 --> 32:08.240]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[32:08.240 --> 32:12.560]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[32:12.560 --> 32:13.880]  allows you to have.
[32:13.880 --> 32:14.880]  It's true.
[32:14.880 --> 32:19.600]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[32:19.600 --> 32:23.920]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[32:23.920 --> 32:27.960]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:27.960 --> 32:31.440]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[32:31.440 --> 32:35.160]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[32:35.160 --> 32:39.840]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[32:39.840 --> 32:43.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[32:43.680 --> 32:45.080]  one of my old sponsors.
[32:45.080 --> 32:49.320]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[32:49.320 --> 32:50.920]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[32:50.920 --> 32:58.600]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[33:20.920 --> 33:34.320]  Now, Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes have probably written more than
[33:34.320 --> 33:37.680]  20-30 articles the last few months, collectively.
[33:37.680 --> 33:44.840]  On the FCC, all the other federal agencies, they are openly saying no free speech in America.
[33:44.840 --> 33:51.360]  I mean, actually saying they're going to tax you and make you on radio, on TV, and the
[33:51.360 --> 33:58.000]  Internet give equal time and place their messages on your radio station.
[33:58.000 --> 33:59.720]  This isn't going to be just, quote, equal time.
[33:59.720 --> 34:02.680]  You decide who you give equal time to.
[34:02.680 --> 34:06.560]  This is going to be government programming, a, quote, government megaphone.
[34:06.560 --> 34:08.920]  And they'll start slow with it.
[34:08.920 --> 34:13.320]  Just to get their nose under the tent flap, you've got to say no to this now.
[34:13.320 --> 34:20.000]  Now, here's The Washington Times, and this was put out by The Washington Times.
[34:20.000 --> 34:21.720]  That means no writer.
[34:21.720 --> 34:26.480]  This is the editorial page of the newspaper saying this.
[34:26.480 --> 34:29.120]  And again, this is not their opinion.
[34:29.120 --> 34:30.680]  I have read over all of this.
[34:30.680 --> 34:32.600]  It's worse than what I'm about to read.
[34:32.600 --> 34:36.720]  The Federal Trade Commission is seeking ways to reinvent journalism.
[34:36.720 --> 34:38.200]  That's a quote.
[34:38.200 --> 34:41.760]  We've linked to the big thick, they're going to reinvent it.
[34:41.760 --> 34:49.040]  And they say the Internet is destroying mainstream newspapers and TV.
[34:49.040 --> 34:52.800]  Yeah, yeah, no one wants to believe CNN or MSNBC.
[34:52.800 --> 34:56.600]  No one, Chris Matthews has like half a million viewers.
[34:56.600 --> 35:00.000]  The top show on CNN has a million.
[35:00.000 --> 35:05.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, this Sunday radio show is on over 40 radio
[35:05.600 --> 35:06.600]  stations.
[35:06.600 --> 35:11.840]  Conservatively over a half a million, just on AM and FM, number one on the Internet, hundreds
[35:11.840 --> 35:15.640]  of thousands tuning in over the two hours on the Internet, hundreds of thousands later
[35:15.640 --> 35:19.280]  listening to the podcast, over 200,000 a day downloaded.
[35:19.280 --> 35:22.960]  The weekday show is getting near to 80 stations right now.
[35:22.960 --> 35:28.040]  Okay, I mean, I can't even believe I have over a million listeners a day, at least two million
[35:28.040 --> 35:29.040]  a week.
[35:29.040 --> 35:31.840]  People say, well, if it's a week, you should have five million.
[35:31.840 --> 35:32.840]  That's not how it works.
[35:32.840 --> 35:36.240]  You have regular listeners and then straggler groups, but it comes out to about two million
[35:36.240 --> 35:40.080]  AM and FM listeners and then another million or so that listened to podcasts and the rest
[35:40.080 --> 35:41.080]  of it.
[35:41.080 --> 35:46.160]  The point is, I mean, of course the ego maniacs in mainstream media don't like Alex Jones
[35:46.160 --> 35:48.640]  here just annihilating them.
[35:48.640 --> 35:52.680]  You think Bill Gates likes getting up and going to the biggest news website out there,
[35:52.680 --> 35:57.120]  the Drudge Report every week and reading infowars.com and prisonplanet.com articles.
[35:57.120 --> 36:01.800]  I mean, you think they like the fact that I'm mainstream, that I have forced myself
[36:01.800 --> 36:06.600]  into the mainstream by proving everything I say, no, they want to shut us down.
[36:06.600 --> 36:09.720]  They can't play on a level playing field.
[36:09.720 --> 36:15.800]  It'd be like a football game where the other team isn't even allowed to field one player
[36:15.800 --> 36:17.560]  against the other 11.
[36:17.560 --> 36:19.520]  That's the mainstream whore media.
[36:19.520 --> 36:22.960]  Oh, you're laughing saying you just don't read the newspaper anymore.
[36:22.960 --> 36:24.520]  You don't tune in to Chris Matthews.
[36:24.520 --> 36:26.040]  Well, he doesn't care.
[36:26.040 --> 36:28.280]  He's just going to shut you down with government power.
[36:28.280 --> 36:30.760]  You're going to watch him.
[36:30.760 --> 36:34.080]  He's going to tell you it's racist to not want to have government health care.
[36:34.080 --> 36:36.160]  He's going to tell you Rand Paul's evil.
[36:36.160 --> 36:41.500]  He's got a special coming out the 16th about myself and Rand Paul, an hour long demonization
[36:41.500 --> 36:42.500]  piece.
[36:42.500 --> 36:45.800]  They're scared.
[36:45.800 --> 36:48.600]  They can't laugh anymore about the Bilderberg group, can they?
[36:48.600 --> 36:54.000]  No, no, now it's world governments now openly being discussed.
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.880]  The Federal Trade Commission, not just the FCC seeking ways to quote re-invent journalism
[36:58.880 --> 37:02.200]  and that's a cause for concern, according to May 24th's wrath proposal.
[37:02.200 --> 37:03.800]  This is a proposal.
[37:03.800 --> 37:07.560]  The agency thinks government should be at the center of a media overhaul.
[37:07.560 --> 37:12.760]  Oh, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting
[37:12.760 --> 37:18.240]  the free exercise thereof or the press or the people's right to peaceably assemble or
[37:18.240 --> 37:20.360]  petition the government for redress of grievance.
[37:20.360 --> 37:24.880]  That government isn't supposed to be in religion 50 years ago, 55 years ago, they took over
[37:24.880 --> 37:29.480]  all the churches with 501c3, they're not supposed to be able to make a law.
[37:29.480 --> 37:31.400]  They're going to take the press over.
[37:31.400 --> 37:32.760]  Do you understand?
[37:32.760 --> 37:38.000]  And I'll be here in 10 years, you know, I guess with a private newsletter saying, see
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.240]  it happened, see it happened, and mainstream media control government would be like, yes,
[37:44.240 --> 37:46.680]  the first amendment does not say you have a right to speech.
[37:46.680 --> 37:49.720]  It means you have a right to government sort of any...
[37:49.720 --> 37:50.720]  I'm about to define it.
[37:50.720 --> 37:52.040]  I'm sorry I'm ranting, folks.
[37:52.040 --> 37:55.040]  This is just the total Soviet Union.
[37:55.040 --> 37:56.800]  Okay, this is Nazi Germany.
[37:56.800 --> 37:58.040]  This is so crap.
[37:58.040 --> 37:59.960]  This is Hugo Chavez on steroids.
[37:59.960 --> 38:06.560]  This is Fidel Castro.
[38:06.560 --> 38:07.560]  It goes on.
[38:07.560 --> 38:10.560]  The bureaucracies, it is a problem that the internet has introduced a well of information
[38:10.560 --> 38:14.720]  options to consumers, forcing media companies to adapt and experiment to meet challenging
[38:14.720 --> 38:15.880]  market needs.
[38:15.880 --> 38:20.560]  The FTC's policy staff fears this new reality, quote, there are reasons for concern.
[38:20.560 --> 38:23.160]  This is from the Federal Trade Commission.
[38:23.160 --> 38:26.800]  This is the Commerce Clause, just like they took over healthcare with the Commerce Clause.
[38:26.800 --> 38:29.720]  They're going to take over everything under the Commerce Clause.
[38:29.720 --> 38:31.920]  Of course, they have no right to do it.
[38:31.920 --> 38:33.400]  They don't care.
[38:33.400 --> 38:38.240]  There are reasons for concern that experimentation may not produce a robust and sustainable business
[38:38.240 --> 38:40.900]  model for commercial journalism, the report states.
[38:40.900 --> 38:45.360]  With no faith that the market will work there, things out for the better, government thinks
[38:45.360 --> 38:49.840]  it must come in to the rescue with a bailout to mainstream media.
[38:49.840 --> 38:55.360]  Your money and the end of your free speech, you're going to pay to be gagged.
[38:55.360 --> 38:58.880]  The idea is being batted around to save the industry, share a common theme.
[38:58.880 --> 39:02.400]  They are designed to empower bureaucrats, not consumers, for instance.
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.200]  One proposal would allow news organizations to agree jointly on a mechanism to require
[39:07.200 --> 39:12.920]  news aggregators and others to pay for the use of online content, perhaps through the
[39:12.920 --> 39:15.640]  use of copyright licenses.
[39:15.640 --> 39:22.160]  In the articles titled, FTC Floads Drudge Tax, Journalism Can't Reinvent Itself Without
[39:22.160 --> 39:28.320]  Government Help, and they're saying that if, and this is what the industry's already
[39:28.320 --> 39:32.240]  proposed, this is what Cass Sunstein wants, this is what the New York Times promoted six
[39:32.240 --> 39:38.400]  months ago, was a kindler, gentler internet where if I link to an article, which is doing
[39:38.400 --> 39:44.120]  them a favor, by the way, and if Drudge links to an article, you're going to pay them for
[39:44.120 --> 39:45.920]  the right to do that.
[39:45.920 --> 39:51.360]  But that's nothing, that's nothing, as if we want to link to your crud anyways.
[39:51.360 --> 39:55.280]  All the articles that get read are the ones we write, we'll go see a piece of legislation,
[39:55.280 --> 39:58.840]  we'll write about it and give the subsections, and it'll get a half million viewers.
[39:58.840 --> 40:01.040]  We can write the article in an hour.
[40:01.040 --> 40:06.920]  How are you lazy mainline reporters that just repeat what the government tells you ever
[40:06.920 --> 40:11.840]  going to compete with real journalists, with real muckrakers, you can't, so you want to
[40:11.840 --> 40:17.320]  shut us up, you're pathetic.
[40:17.320 --> 40:18.320]  It goes on.
[40:18.320 --> 40:21.520]  In other words, government policy would encourage tax on websites like the Drudge Report and
[40:21.520 --> 40:26.000]  must read source for news links of the day, so that the agency can redistribute the funds
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.240]  collected to various newspapers.
[40:28.240 --> 40:33.200]  Such a tax would hit other news aggregators such as Dig, Fark, Reddit, which not only
[40:33.200 --> 40:36.880]  gather links but provide a forum for lively entertaining discussion.
[40:36.880 --> 40:41.920]  Oh my God, how dare you link to something and say go read it and comment here of the
[40:41.920 --> 40:47.640]  issues raised by the stories fostering a robust public policy debate, not saving a particular
[40:47.640 --> 40:51.480]  business model, should be the goal of journalism in the first place, but then it gets a hundred
[40:51.480 --> 40:52.480]  times worse.
[40:52.480 --> 40:54.840]  These articles always start with the low level stuff first.
[40:54.840 --> 40:59.840]  The report also discusses the possibility of offering tax exemptions to news organizations
[40:59.840 --> 41:04.480]  establishing an AmeriCorps for reporters, that's already passed folks, they've already passed
[41:04.480 --> 41:07.400]  a bill, and it's also in the Cybersecurity Act, they haven't passed, but it's on the
[41:07.400 --> 41:13.360]  verge of it, where all high schoolers, remember the White House Chief of Staff on C-SPAN said
[41:13.360 --> 41:18.320]  you will be forced to serve every year for two years after high school and in high school
[41:18.320 --> 41:22.880]  for the government domestically, and you will go to a boot camp, and they now tell you it's
[41:22.880 --> 41:28.160]  going to be writing government propaganda that is then forced on our websites in government
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.760]  pop-ups that are put in over your server, through your ISP.
[41:32.760 --> 41:36.400]  I mean this is just so unbelievable.
[41:36.400 --> 41:40.480]  I mean not even China goes this far.
[41:40.480 --> 41:44.160]  The report also discusses the possibility of offering tax exemptions to news organizations
[41:44.160 --> 41:49.920]  establishing an AmeriCorps for reporters and creating a national fund for local news organizations.
[41:49.920 --> 41:55.640]  The money for those benefits would come from a suite of new taxes.
[41:55.640 --> 41:57.760]  What did Cass Sunstein talk about a year ago?
[41:57.760 --> 42:00.440]  White House regulations are.
[42:00.440 --> 42:07.360]  A 5% tax on consumer electronic devices such as iPads and Kindles, that's already introduced.
[42:07.360 --> 42:14.280]  You're going to pay to have any internet access, and then it's given to select mainline government
[42:14.280 --> 42:17.760]  whore media, media prostitutes.
[42:17.760 --> 42:22.200]  The money for those benefits, see because they, she's a free market folks, people won't
[42:22.200 --> 42:26.120]  buy mainstream garbage media anymore, so the government's going to fund it, they're already
[42:26.120 --> 42:31.320]  doing it with product placement, behavior placement, propaganda placement.
[42:31.320 --> 42:35.960]  The money for those benefits would come from a suite of new taxes, a 5% tax on consumer
[42:35.960 --> 42:40.640]  electronic devices such as iPads, Kindles and laptops, that let consumers read the news
[42:40.640 --> 42:45.480]  without being used to encourage people to keep reading the dead tree version of the news.
[42:45.480 --> 42:51.120]  Other taxes be levied on radio and television spectrum, advertising and cell phones, get
[42:51.120 --> 42:53.720]  ready and then they'll give it to who they want.
[42:53.720 --> 42:58.200]  I'm going to finish up when we get back and then take your phone calls, ah, I'm getting
[42:58.200 --> 42:59.200]  angry.
[42:59.200 --> 43:04.360]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, you've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for
[43:04.360 --> 43:05.360]  years.
[43:05.360 --> 43:09.680]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find
[43:09.680 --> 43:10.680]  in stores.

[43:24.360 --> 43:29.360]  Since 1947, Calden Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and
[43:29.360 --> 43:30.800]  gentle on the environment.

[43:58.560 --> 44:00.000]  Thank you.
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.400]  They helped to create a new world order.
[44:02.400 --> 44:07.880]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[44:07.880 --> 44:12.120]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[44:12.120 --> 44:13.120]  documents.
[44:13.120 --> 44:17.520]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[44:17.520 --> 44:20.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.760]  The United Nations would take over America.
[44:22.760 --> 44:26.080]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[44:26.080 --> 44:31.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.520]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[44:33.520 --> 44:38.000]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[44:38.000 --> 44:39.000]  financial system.
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.880]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[44:41.880 --> 44:45.560]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[44:45.560 --> 44:47.880]  When I got news for you, you're everyone else.
[44:47.880 --> 44:54.440]  Invisible Empire, secure your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or watch
[44:54.440 --> 44:57.880]  it online in the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[44:57.880 --> 45:02.960]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[45:02.960 --> 45:07.840]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[45:07.840 --> 45:08.840]  do you want?
[45:08.840 --> 45:10.840]  My answer would be all I can get.
[45:10.840 --> 45:15.880]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[45:15.880 --> 45:17.120]  How much do you want?
[45:17.120 --> 45:18.120]  When do you want it?
[45:18.120 --> 45:20.160]  Now or after the battle starts.
[45:20.160 --> 45:21.280]  When will you need it?
[45:21.280 --> 45:23.400]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[45:23.400 --> 45:24.720]  Will there be any food?
[45:24.720 --> 45:26.200]  Will it make your children sick?
[45:26.200 --> 45:30.320]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[45:30.320 --> 45:31.480]  and be immunized?
[45:31.480 --> 45:35.280]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[45:35.280 --> 45:38.880]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[45:38.880 --> 45:40.120]  How much will you need?
[45:40.120 --> 45:41.120]  We don't know.
[45:41.120 --> 45:42.120]  How much do you want?
[45:42.120 --> 45:43.120]  All you can get.
[45:43.120 --> 45:44.120]  I'm Alex Jones.
[45:44.120 --> 45:47.320]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[45:47.320 --> 45:54.840]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[45:54.840 --> 45:59.600]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[45:59.600 --> 46:04.600]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[46:04.600 --> 46:05.600]  What have we got?
[46:05.600 --> 46:07.880]  A republic or a monarchy?
[46:07.880 --> 46:11.760]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[46:11.760 --> 46:15.960]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[46:15.960 --> 46:20.640]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education,
[46:20.640 --> 46:21.640]  our money.
[46:21.640 --> 46:25.720]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[46:25.720 --> 46:29.240]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[46:29.240 --> 46:30.240]  You have been warned.
[46:30.240 --> 46:31.520]  We have the facts.
[46:31.520 --> 46:32.680]  We have the constitution.
[46:32.680 --> 46:33.680]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[46:33.680 --> 46:34.680]  We have common law.
[46:34.680 --> 46:39.040]  The privilege is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[46:39.040 --> 46:40.040]  Don't tread on me.
[46:40.040 --> 46:41.040]  Rise of the republic.
[46:41.040 --> 46:45.720]  Terrany is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[46:45.720 --> 46:47.520]  A new tool in the info war.
[46:47.520 --> 46:48.520]  Don't tread on me.
[46:48.520 --> 46:56.640]  Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support
[46:56.640 --> 47:01.160]  independent patriotic liberty films.
[47:01.160 --> 47:08.160]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:31.160 --> 47:40.960]  That's right.
[47:40.960 --> 47:45.320]  But the bottom line is the people do know now they're not living in denial.
[47:45.320 --> 47:50.340]  And so the globalists want to shut down free talk radio and the internet, but also taxes
[47:50.340 --> 47:53.440]  on TV, taxes on advertising.
[47:53.440 --> 47:58.000]  It's the government, state-owned, controlled, lap dog media.
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.560]  And of course, most media will pile on to be cronies and get their tax exemption.
[48:03.560 --> 48:07.480]  But after they're done taking over the media, they'll then take the tax exemption away.
[48:07.480 --> 48:11.680]  Have you noticed they're now announcing they're getting rid of many tax exemptions for churches
[48:11.680 --> 48:13.080]  and other organizations?
[48:13.080 --> 48:16.120]  After they got you domesticated, you don't get the tax exemption.
[48:16.120 --> 48:17.120]  It's illegal.
[48:17.120 --> 48:18.120]  It's unlawful.
[48:18.120 --> 48:22.320]  But hey, it's illegal and unlawful to have the government run into healthcare or to have
[48:22.320 --> 48:24.480]  the federal government involved in gun control.
[48:24.480 --> 48:26.560]  This stuff's all unconstitutional.
[48:26.560 --> 48:30.120]  It's illegal for the government to steal tens of trillions of dollars and give it to foreign
[48:30.120 --> 48:35.520]  banks and then tell you, the Congress, the people's representative that they won't tell
[48:35.520 --> 48:36.920]  you where the money went.
[48:36.920 --> 48:42.640]  So I'm reading this editorial, FTC Floats Drudge Tax.
[48:42.640 --> 48:46.520]  Journalism can't reinvent itself without government help.
[48:46.520 --> 48:52.200]  And it goes on a 5% tax on consumer electronic devices such as iPads, Kindles, laptops, so
[48:52.200 --> 48:54.680]  a tax on knowledge.
[48:54.680 --> 49:00.880]  And it goes on and it says taxes levied on radio, television, spectrum, advertising,
[49:00.880 --> 49:01.880]  and cell phones.
[49:01.880 --> 49:04.320]  You know, they love those hidden taxes.
[49:04.320 --> 49:08.200]  You ever get your cell phone bill and there's all these added fees to the state and the
[49:08.200 --> 49:12.800]  feds and one of them Al Gore got passed decades ago?
[49:12.800 --> 49:15.920]  This is how they rip you off.
[49:15.920 --> 49:23.360]  And then they give it to their own quasi-government media like the Obama girl, the conflict of
[49:23.360 --> 49:27.760]  interest and having the government pay or contribute to a newsman's salary could not
[49:27.760 --> 49:29.960]  be more obvious.
[49:29.960 --> 49:34.480]  Reporters and columnists would have little incentive to offer critical analysis of tax
[49:34.480 --> 49:37.880]  incentives that might mean a boost in their pocketbook.
[49:37.880 --> 49:42.560]  Once Congress has the power to fund the news, it can at any time attach strings designed
[49:42.560 --> 49:45.640]  to promote certain viewpoints in the name of fairness, of course, which they're already
[49:45.640 --> 49:46.640]  proposing.
[49:46.640 --> 49:51.200]  Each year at budget time, the Fourth Estate would scramble to be worthy in the eyes of
[49:51.200 --> 49:52.880]  Capitol Hill for increased support.
[49:52.880 --> 49:57.840]  It is hardly a surprise that the heavily subsidized national public radio frequency
[49:57.840 --> 50:02.440]  presents issues in a way favorable to Washington's tax and spend agenda.
[50:02.440 --> 50:04.160]  Yeah, no kidding.
[50:04.160 --> 50:10.160]  So in the age of media and the age of thousands of choices, we need the government to tax
[50:10.160 --> 50:14.840]  it and run it and have a government megaphone through the media.
[50:14.840 --> 50:17.040]  And they now admit what I told you 15 years ago.
[50:17.040 --> 50:20.960]  They call it behavior placement.
[50:20.960 --> 50:25.960]  When you watch any Hollywood movie, a big budget movie, you watch any TV show.
[50:25.960 --> 50:31.600]  It's all anti-gun, anti-family, pro-world government, pro-vaccination, pro-surveillance,
[50:31.600 --> 50:34.320]  pro-police state, anti-homeschool.
[50:34.320 --> 50:35.320]  It's on record.
[50:35.320 --> 50:40.600]  Eight years ago, the Congress talked about tens of billions being spent for fake news.
[50:40.600 --> 50:44.320]  The General Accounting Office and others said it was illegal that Bush was doing that.
[50:44.320 --> 50:50.400]  Obama has gone to levels never before seen, where ABC and NBC and CBS have been on record
[50:50.400 --> 50:56.960]  saying, we've handed programming over to the White House for their messages.
[50:56.960 --> 51:00.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, all over the country, they train kids that the earth is dying and
[51:00.440 --> 51:03.080]  that developments kill bunny rabbits, literally.
[51:03.080 --> 51:06.520]  They show images of bunny rabbits with their heads cut off, and then children cry when
[51:06.520 --> 51:11.040]  they see a house being built and come home and tell their parents, don't take a hot bath
[51:11.040 --> 51:14.600]  and boss them around and tell them, don't run the water while you brush your teeth.
[51:14.600 --> 51:16.400]  They're taking your children away from you.
[51:16.400 --> 51:20.360]  It's total brainwashing everywhere.
[51:20.360 --> 51:25.800]  Self-respecting journalists must reject the tempting government bribe as the FCTC brings
[51:25.800 --> 51:30.240]  its proposals to a roundtable discussion, scheduled for June 15th, when it comes to
[51:30.240 --> 51:35.600]  the media consumers lose most when government suppresses innovation in the name of saving
[51:35.600 --> 51:36.920]  old business models.
[51:36.920 --> 51:41.160]  So the New York Times is on the verge of collapsing.
[51:41.160 --> 51:44.240]  The San Francisco Chronicles on the verge of collapsing.
[51:44.240 --> 51:46.080]  All these other big papers are collapsing.
[51:46.080 --> 51:51.960]  Folks, if those papers gave people the news and information they wanted, they'd be doing
[51:51.960 --> 51:52.960]  great.
[51:52.960 --> 51:53.960]  Okay?
[51:53.960 --> 51:59.480]  People, and of course, Rupert Murdoch has said this, he's going to subscriber base,
[51:59.480 --> 52:04.320]  and he'll be able to have a good model.
[52:04.320 --> 52:11.920]  But the truth is that people don't want this government brainwashing, but regardless, it's
[52:11.920 --> 52:12.920]  illegal.
[52:12.920 --> 52:16.640]  The government does not control the media in the United States, yes.
[52:16.640 --> 52:17.640]  They do in Zimbabwe.
[52:17.640 --> 52:21.120]  Yes, they do in Communist China to a certain extent.
[52:21.120 --> 52:25.200]  This is more draconian than even that, and I wanted to add the Cybersecurity Act that's
[52:25.200 --> 52:31.360]  passed the House and the Senate states, ISPs, Internet Service providers with over 100 customers
[52:31.360 --> 52:38.120]  will be under full federal control and will have EAS, Homeland Security control boxes
[52:38.120 --> 52:41.160]  in their switches, and you will pay for it.
[52:41.160 --> 52:46.760]  Now, for those who don't know, in 96, all radio stations went from dialing to a central
[52:46.760 --> 52:53.080]  emergency channel to having, at their tower and at their final relay center, everything
[52:53.080 --> 52:55.920]  wired through a FEMA control box.
[52:55.920 --> 53:01.680]  The Internet, every sector of the web, and by the way, China already has something similar
[53:01.680 --> 53:04.440]  and it slows it down big time, that's another problem.
[53:04.440 --> 53:07.600]  That's what Congress has raised, it's the problem that it's going to screw it up, that
[53:07.600 --> 53:13.840]  anyone with an IT job must have a government certification and pay to go get an additional
[53:13.840 --> 53:20.160]  at least 12 months of continuing education and be licensed as a federal agent.
[53:20.160 --> 53:25.520]  Just like CPAs, I can't hire a CPA, I mean I still pay the tax, I choose my enemies,
[53:25.520 --> 53:30.240]  we didn't have until 1913, it's a tax to offshore banks, just like what Greece is paying is
[53:30.240 --> 53:34.640]  to offshore banks, yes we've been captured, yes it's illegal, yes I shouldn't be doing
[53:34.640 --> 53:38.440]  it, but I run a pretty big operation, I choose my battles and I know they're the mafia, they'll
[53:38.440 --> 53:39.440]  come after me.
[53:39.440 --> 53:44.080]  But still, I go into CPAs and I say, I want my tax exemptions, it says I get, and every
[53:44.080 --> 53:47.520]  CPA says, I'm sorry for four years, we're now under federal control and we're liable
[53:47.520 --> 53:51.840]  for anything, so we give them extra money, I serve, I mean just everything is about
[53:51.840 --> 53:57.400]  serving and worshiping and paying more than you're even supposed to.
[53:57.400 --> 54:01.560]  And so that's the new system, just everyone a federal officer, everyone under federal
[54:01.560 --> 54:09.840]  control, everyone forced to sign articles of confederation agreeing, waving your rights.
[54:09.840 --> 54:14.600]  And hundreds of federal and international officials and Time Magazine and Newsweek and
[54:14.600 --> 54:18.960]  the New York Times saying, we want to shut the old web down, have internet too with only
[54:18.960 --> 54:23.720]  approved websites, oh it's coming and they're already building the new hubs that we won't
[54:23.720 --> 54:29.040]  be allowed on, because we're kicking their butts, it'd be like an NFL team that always
[54:29.040 --> 54:32.640]  won the Super Bowl, they might just finally disqualify them.
[54:32.640 --> 54:37.000]  It's like a rollerball or something where they say, you know, Houston isn't allowed
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.360]  to win anymore, you're not allowed to win, Jones, you're not allowed to kick the butt
[54:41.360 --> 54:45.040]  of the New World Order, you're not allowed to expose and route the media, you're not
[54:45.040 --> 54:50.040]  allowed to have three million visitors a week to your websites and growing exponentially.
[54:50.040 --> 54:55.000]  Because they have seen the math, they have seen the numbers, they, folks, I have moles
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.600]  in Bilderberg, it's in the London Guardian with the moles have reported, the Guardian
[55:00.600 --> 55:05.320]  was in there hours after they shut the resort down, security threw him out, but not before
[55:05.320 --> 55:11.080]  they were walking around saying, we are scared of Alex Jones, he isn't coming, is he, oh
[55:11.080 --> 55:16.320]  my gosh, you should have seen him bullhorn us, they're so scary, these people are scared
[55:16.320 --> 55:20.720]  to death of the truth, they know the crimes they've committed, they know what they've
[55:20.720 --> 55:25.080]  done, they understand what they're up against, they understand we're committed, they know
[55:25.080 --> 55:30.360]  we're not going away, we know that we can beat them and they know that we know their
[55:30.360 --> 55:33.360]  game plan.
[55:33.360 --> 55:39.160]  You know, I'm going out to break here and I may not even take calls today, I usually
[55:39.160 --> 55:43.000]  take calls but I really got a lot I want to cover and we have this, you know, what did
[55:43.000 --> 55:50.000]  I tell you in January of last year, that's 16, no, that's 18 months ago, what did I tell
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.120]  you 18 months ago, it's on record, podcaster there, the articles are there, video cast
[55:56.120 --> 56:04.360]  is there, because I had emergency managers call me from Indiana and I had the Indiana
[56:04.360 --> 56:11.440]  newspaper on and people called me from upstate New York and I was sent the Bureau of Cemetery's
[56:11.440 --> 56:16.400]  internal secret documents that were confirmed to be real later by the national news, just
[56:16.400 --> 56:22.400]  like we broke in thousands of other major reports because we get this of the intel
[56:22.400 --> 56:27.720]  and the government said flu is coming, millions will die, there will be martial law.
[56:27.720 --> 56:32.200]  So in January, three months before the flu hype started in Mexico, I went on air and
[56:32.200 --> 56:35.400]  said they're going to launch some type of flu hype and they're training for martial
[56:35.400 --> 56:36.400]  law.
[56:36.400 --> 56:39.720]  I don't know if this is going to be real or not.
[56:39.720 --> 56:44.280]  I don't know if they'll be really a deadly flu but they're gearing up like never before
[56:44.280 --> 56:48.400]  and law enforcement and emergency managers are concerned, they're saying harden your
[56:48.400 --> 56:52.080]  police stations, get ready for martial law.
[56:52.080 --> 56:56.720]  Then the flu hype came, then we analyzed the attack and said it was a fake fraud to
[56:56.720 --> 56:59.800]  get you to take the shots and that the shots were deadly.
[56:59.800 --> 57:06.600]  Now the head of the UU medical commission came on this show and said their hearing found
[57:06.600 --> 57:07.720]  it was a fraud.
[57:07.720 --> 57:12.880]  Now the British medical journal has come out and said it's a fraud, that's coming up
[57:12.880 --> 57:17.640]  in the next hour for 30 minutes and then we'll get to, I guess, Francesco, Jeff, Eddie, and
[57:17.640 --> 57:19.840]  many others that are patiently holding.
[57:19.840 --> 57:25.400]  I'm a filmmaker, I'm a syndicated radio host and I run info wars.com and President Blana.com
[57:25.400 --> 57:33.520]  and I bleed deep red blood and I love freedom and I love humanity and I know you do as well
[57:33.520 --> 57:35.880]  and I know we can beat these people together.
[57:35.880 --> 57:39.600]  They wouldn't be trying to shut down our free speech and overthrow the First Amendment
[57:39.600 --> 57:43.240]  if we weren't absolutely routing this scum.
[57:43.240 --> 57:46.560]  We can win together but the battle is now joined.
[57:46.560 --> 58:16.520]  Stay with us, Transmission Continues.
[58:16.560 --> 58:44.120]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap from Marty Schachter and see what he has
[58:44.120 --> 58:56.000]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.920]  losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[58:59.920 --> 59:05.880]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union,
[59:05.880 --> 59:10.800]  resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[59:10.800 --> 59:15.520]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and
[59:15.520 --> 59:16.520]  our families.
[59:16.520 --> 59:20.320]  Action now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy
[59:20.320 --> 59:22.000]  of your own home.
[59:22.000 --> 59:26.600]  Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural
[59:26.600 --> 59:30.760]  alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[59:30.760 --> 59:37.760]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by
[59:37.760 --> 59:40.920]  producing your own colloidal silver right from home.
[59:40.920 --> 01:00:08.760]  It's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:36.760]  It's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:01:05.760]  It's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:27.760]  It's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:55.760]  It's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:21.760]  It's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.120]  I generally have an open mind about it, and I don't have proof that it was an accident
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.760]  or it wasn't an accident, but it's beginning to lean, as I've been saying in the last week,
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.960]  if there's a viral video on YouTube where I talk about it, just with the Goldman Sachs
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960]  dumping on the stock.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.880]  But I don't have a crystal ball, Mike, but the fact that BP's the top globalist Queen
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.320]  Beatrix owns it along with the Queen of England, that they do want carbon taxes, that Obama's
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:52.520]  now proposing carbon taxes, you know, because of this catastrophe, the fact that they didn't
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:57.160]  burn the oil off, they didn't put microbes in it, they sat on their butt for a month
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.320]  before they started real mitigation, it does look suspicious, doesn't it, Mike?
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.120]  Well, they deployed a known failed part, but even more than that, they didn't wait up
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:12.280]  for the setup times on the materials, so the expectation would be for it not to hold something
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.720]  in place, not that you would have any expectation for this to work.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:20.600]  Well, now they're saying that it may go on for years, I appreciate your call, Francisco
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.960]  in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:30.080]  My Alex, I've been a long time listener, I'm 19, I really want to join this cause and
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.000]  I really want to help you out.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.160]  I think that a revolution should take place as we speak right now, right now as, right
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.640]  now that they haven't taken away our freedom of speech, they haven't taken away anything,
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.040]  yes, they have the martial law.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.920]  Oh, they're taking our money away, they're taking our sovereignty, they're taking our
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.160]  privacy naked body scanning little kids and saving it and passing it around, they now
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:59.600]  admit they record it all and, so they're taking a lot, the issue is they're the revolutionaries,
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:04.360]  they're overturning our freedom, we need to restore our freedom and that's starting
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.600]  to happen.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:12.760]  That's why we should take action now as we have a chance before the new police has come
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:17.720]  in and completely shut us out and shut us up, we need to do something else.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.720]  Well, how do you take action?
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.320]  I mean, I'm trying to warn people right now.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:30.640]  Yes, warning people is good, but taking action and making what Bob Marley did, he would have
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.280]  a, how would you say, a...
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:40.680]  He'd smoke giant, giant, giant, giant marijuana cigarettes, spliffs or whatever you call it.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:46.320]  I appreciate your call, sir, nothing against the weed heads, but I don't think any army
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.200]  ever won a war smoking pot, I'll tell you that right now.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:59.280]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:03.920]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:08.240]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.600]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.920]  allows you to have.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:19.640]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:23.960]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:27.960]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:31.440]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:35.160]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:39.840]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.080]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:49.320]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.880]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:06:00.120]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:06.040]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:31.320]  a war on for your mind.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:35.960]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, for the next 25 minutes or so that I'm going to get back into
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:43.800]  the news and your phone calls, we are joined by Dr. Deborah Cohen and she is the features
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:48.760]  editor of the British Medical Journal, probably the most prestigious medical journal in the
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.760]  world.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:55.160]  You know, one of the most respected out there and they have an article, World Health Organization
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.520]  and the Pandemic Flew Conspiracies.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:04.320]  Now, going back to February 4th of this year, we had Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg on the syndicated
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:08.800]  radio broadcast and he's now stepped down from that position on the rotating post, but
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:14.120]  he's a medical doctor out of Germany and he was the head of the European Union Health
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:22.120]  Commission and they did find in their hearing that there was a systematic payoffs by the
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:28.800]  big five vaccine makers to government health spokesmen to come out and scare people and
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:34.240]  say basically, you know, run for the hills, hundreds of millions may die, take the H1N1
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:39.160]  and he also went on to say the H1N1 was unproven and did have bad side effects like Guillain-Barré
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.760]  disorder and did cause some serious health problems.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:48.360]  And so that's what the European Union Health Commission found, but separately there is
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:55.440]  a detailed, I mean, this is a thick scientific lengthy report here that was contributed to
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:00.240]  by quite a few people and Dr. Deborah Cohen features editor of the British Medical Journal
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:06.160]  joins us from the UK and Dr. Great to have you on with us on a Sunday.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.880]  By the way, her report is an ABC News, Wall Street Journal, New York Times.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.680]  So this is big national news.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:18.880]  I'm proud of the fact that we were already trying to get her on before it became national
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880]  news.
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.800]  Her report from the British Medical Journal.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.280]  So thank you for joining us, Dr. Thank you for having me on.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:26.280]  You bet.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:30.920]  Now, you've got the floor breakdown in layman's terms because we're not all doctors like
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.440]  yourself, obviously.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:35.800]  What happened and what this investigation shows?
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:45.000]  Essentially, it shows how closely the World Health Organization has worked with people
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.400]  that are paid by pharmaceutical companies to develop policy about tackling the pandemic.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:55.760]  So it all starts off in 1999 when there were fears coming from Hong Kong about the chicken
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:01.480]  flu outbreak and that started in 1997, but they decided to draft some guidance about
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.080]  how to deal with a potential pandemic.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.760]  Now, the group that they started working with was something called the European Scientific
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.560]  Working Group and Influenza.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.000]  Now, they published the guidance and what they didn't say in the guidance that this
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:22.480]  working group is 100% pharmaceutical company funded, funded by the manufacturers of vaccines
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:27.440]  and also funded by the manufacturers of antiviral.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.880]  So, yeah, there's Rillenza and Tamiflo.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:36.160]  And a couple of the people that actually wrote this report, well, one of them in particular
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:43.320]  was actually promoting Tamiflo on behalf of BROSH at the time of writing this report.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:49.920]  Then we fast forward slightly to 2004 and this is when the definitive guidance on stop piling
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:55.560]  the likes of Rillenza and Tamiflo came out and this is in 2004 the World Health Organization
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.560]  produced a report.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.560]  Now, this was given to governments around the world.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:05.480]  Now, if you cast your mind back to 2005, there was a lot of scare about an avian pandemic,
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:09.400]  avian flu pandemic and there were deaths in the Far East.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.400]  And SARS.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.400]  And SARS.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.600]  So, there was a lot of scare around the place, you know, that we did have these outbreaks
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:21.280]  of illnesses and there was a lot of scare around the place and rightly governments wanted
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:26.080]  to kind of figure out what they should do about it before it started affecting lots of
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.080]  people.
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:33.720]  And governments looked to the World Health Organization for guidance and how to deal
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.720]  with these global illnesses.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:41.200]  But what we found in our investigation is three key authors, Professor Hayden, who's
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:48.200]  from the University of Virginia, and Dr. Monto, who is from the University of Michigan, and
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.080]  Professor Cole Nicholson, who is from the University of Leicester in the UK.
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:58.080]  All three of them were on the payroll of pharmaceutical companies when they drafted this key guidance
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:04.280]  that went out to governments around the world but instructed them to stop how these drugs.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.880]  Now, this wasn't made clear by the World Health Organization.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:12.800]  If you work for a scientific journal and you're an expert that receives money from the pharmaceutical
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:17.200]  industry, you're supposed to declare it alongside your article.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.920]  The WHO didn't do that.
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:25.160]  Now, what we never established, because I think they should rank slightly, is whether
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.760]  the WHO looked into the fact that these people had ties to the pharmaceutical industry, not
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:37.320]  just any pharmaceutical companies, companies that were set to benefit from mass purchase
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.320]  of these drugs.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:43.920]  Well, a lot of them that made the recommendations, and not just the three chief ones you mentioned,
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.360]  just from separate reports, would also then got jobs.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.560]  They would make the recommendations four, five, six years ago, depending on the incident.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:57.320]  Then they would rotate through and get a job at the very company that they recommended
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:02.000]  the government buy these goods from, and vice versa.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:09.520]  And the EU report on it said that it was the World Health Organization, just all of them.
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:14.560]  EU in people getting paid off, doctors getting paid off, just systematic, and then they had
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:20.120]  state health experts that we found were on the payroll of these wealthy groups, making
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.080]  billions off the vaccine.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.480]  And then they would have local doctors come out in fear monger who were also on the payroll.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:32.120]  But I know your report just focuses in on the conflict of interest with these key leaders
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.320]  who were top advisors to government.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:40.400]  But certainly this coming from the British Medical Journal is going to get a lot of attention.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.760]  What are you expecting to come from this, if anything?
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.240]  I mean, because obviously, just a month or so ago, the World Health Organization said,
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:56.120]  okay, we did hype things, we did fear monger, we have lost credibility, sorry we cried wolf,
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.920]  but next time you still need to listen to us.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:06.280]  I think what we hope for it is that the WHO really looks at how they deal and how they
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:10.000]  use experts with industry ties, really.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.720]  I mean, what they've got to sit back and think is, how do you feel as a taxpayer, knowing
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:21.880]  that somebody that is on the payroll of a big pharmaceutical company that is set to
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.520]  make billions out of a drug, how do you feel about them developing your policy?
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:30.560]  Is that acceptable, and our feeling it probably isn't acceptable.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:34.000]  We have no problem with experts working with industry.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.680]  We need experts to work with the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.680]  We need new drugs.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.680]  We need to develop new drugs.
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.840]  But they shouldn't be the government experts that make the recommendation on what vaccine
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.840]  to buy.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:44.840]  No, absolutely not.
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.400]  And there should be an absolute firewall.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:51.960]  Interestingly enough, the expert that is leading the investigation into the World Health
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:57.000]  Organization, Dr. Harvey Feinberg, who is from the Institute of Medicine, the US Institute
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.200]  of Medicine, he takes quite a hard line on this, and he actually says that declaring
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:07.360]  conflicts isn't enough, but actually people with industry ties should not be making policy
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.360]  decisions.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.360]  And he's actually welcome the report.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.640]  It'll be interesting to see what happens.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.920]  Well, yeah, because if the medical system does this a couple more times, they're going
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:16.920]  to lose all credibility.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:22.560]  And that is the danger in the World Health Organization, rather than deflecting criticism,
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.280]  I think it really has to take stock now and say, how are we going to deal with this in
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.280]  the future?
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:32.360]  And if there is stuff that's gone wrong, and clearly there has been, because there wouldn't
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:39.560]  be investigations by the European Parliament, by the Council of Europe that produced a report
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:44.800]  only on Friday as well, by the French government, by the British government, there wouldn't
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.240]  be all these big investigations going on if everything has gone right.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.720]  And I think there are a couple of things that have gone wrong, but one of the key things
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.720]  has been has been a lack of transparency.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.280]  And I don't think, you know, at one point I think people would have accepted that doctors
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.320]  making decisions, they were unquestioned, but we'll pass that now.
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:08.920]  And I think we're in a day and age where we want transparency, and we expect decision
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.680]  makers to be accountable for their actions.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:18.000]  And so hopefully, you know, there will be some good that comes out of this, and we see,
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.640]  and to be fair to the United States, you guys are a lot further ahead than we are in Europe.
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:29.560]  Your institutions, and your universities, and your Senate are taking this, you know,
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:33.640]  Charles Grassley, for example, Republican Senator, is taking all this really, really
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:34.640]  seriously.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:37.640]  We're quite far behind in Europe, and we really need to address it here.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:40.800]  That's not to say the United States should get complacent.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.880]  All right, Dr. Deborah Cohen, one more segment with us, because I've got a few other important
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.280]  questions and other points that you might want to make.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.920]  It's bmj.com, British Medical Journal.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:56.200]  The article is Who and the Pandemic Flu Conspiracy.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.200]  Stay with us.

[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:21.360]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:28.480]  They sew pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:34.560]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:39.520]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:46.320]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.760]  Charity is here.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.680]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.080]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.600]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:17.840]  on earth.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:22.680]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.520]  expanded nationwide.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:29.200]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.600]  shadow state.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.600]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:39.080]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.

[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:48.400]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.440]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:51.440]  It's here.

[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:03.840]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:08.200]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.200]  do you want?
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.200]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:16.240]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.480]  How much do you want?
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:18.480]  When do you want it?
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.480]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.600]  When will you need it?
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.720]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.080]  Will there be any food?
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.520]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:30.680]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.840]  and be immunized?
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.600]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.440]  How much will you need?
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.440]  We don't know.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.440]  How much do you want?
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.440]  All you can get.

[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:05.040]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:15.500]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:19.480]  We all want good health care we can trust, but having the government take over health
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:24.800]  care and having the government being basically run by special interest, big pharma, 90 plus
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:29.200]  percent of our vaccines are now made in China and you try to say, hey, I don't trust these
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:35.720]  vaccines or hey, kids are dying from this Gardasil shot or major states in Australia
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.720]  have banned.
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:40.000]  I saw this in the news last week giving shots to kids under five because so many of them
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.600]  were dying and now they're not just mandating five or six vaccines, now it's 50 plus shots
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.240]  and these big companies have hundreds of new vaccines a year.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:52.480]  They want them all mandated, they want to make you take them all.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.760]  We're talking to medical doctor Deborah Cohen, a features editor of the British Medical
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:04.120]  Journal, detailed report that's been picked up by ABC News, you name it, World Health
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:07.840]  Organization scientists linked to swine flu vaccine makers.
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:11.080]  She was telling me during the break that she sees, you know, women's magazines and others
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:14.960]  quoting experts saying everything's fine, but then she happens to know those experts
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:15.960]  are on the payroll.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:20.160]  I mean, we do have a crisis in confidence.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:26.760]  Children's Vaccine Health Center, pig virus DNA found in rotovirus vaccine, FDA says one
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:32.280]  million kids have been given the virus study show it can hurt children, but FDA says no
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.280]  problem.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:36.160]  I mean, it's getting crazier and crazier.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:41.440]  So we're supposed to question formula from China with melamine, but don't question vaccines
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.440]  from China doc.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:50.480]  Well, I think, I mean, I think on the whole, you know, things are tested very, very well
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:57.640]  and, you know, and I mean, I can't comment specific, I mean, I focused specifically on
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:58.640]  swine flu.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:04.000]  So I can't comment specifically on Gardasil or, or anything else.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  Sure.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  So let's talk about Australia.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.560]  They've suspended shots in one state at least because of the H1N1 trial, correct?
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.560]  Yeah.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:13.560]  I mean, that is correct.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:20.000]  I mean, I don't know the results of the investigation yet, but they were concerned that children
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  were having adverse reactions in one of the states in Australia and they suspended their
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  immunization program.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.680]  I mean, and they, that was due, they were due to test the vaccine and I, I don't know.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:34.880]  And that's quite an adverse reaction dying.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.680]  Well, I don't know.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.760]  I can't categorically say that is what they were dying from.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:45.720]  I mean, I, I haven't seen sure, but the investigation is, and they've got Australian doctors saying
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.720]  it was the shots.
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:52.320]  Yeah, I did, Australian doctors are saying it's, it's the shots then I would listen to
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.320]  them.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.080]  I can't comment specifically because I haven't been directly.
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.080]  No, no, absolutely.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:00.200]  Specifically, you're looking mainly, Doc, at the conflict of interest then.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:04.200]  What else can you tell us about that and, and how deep it went in your report?
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:11.600]  Well, I think what, what we know is there is a network of people that, that go to conferences
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.000]  that are funded by industry.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.560]  And I think one of the problems is that every expert wants their illness to be taken seriously,
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:24.840]  wants their expertise to be taken seriously because taken seriously, that means investment
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:31.600]  in that condition, research funding, it means, you know, it means high turnover for the drug
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:32.600]  companies.
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:39.280]  And so, and so we do know there is a network of key people, but, but our pharmacies company
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:45.960]  funded that sit on the World Health Organization that sit on government bureaus that sit on,
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:46.960]  that make big decisions.
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:53.360]  I mean, that even extends the neuro to our, our equivalent for the FDA, the European Medicines
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.360]  Agency.
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:24:00.000]  And, and I think you need to decide how we want to deal with this, whether it, whether
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  it's acceptable.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.480]  And like you guys in America are quite far ahead of us in Europe.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.480]  We are behind.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:10.720]  But also when, when I see quotes like I was saying to you, you know, I saw a quote from
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:15.320]  Blamama being about swine, swine, swine, swine, this is the zone today.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:19.580]  And actually the person quoting that was saying, I don't worry in the UK, we're fine, we've
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.600]  got lots of tamiflu and relenza.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.920]  You know, it's all great.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:28.560]  I know that that person, that expert is on the payroll of Rache.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:35.080]  So and, and what that does, what you worry about is there will be a lapse in confidence.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:44.080]  And that can extend to legitimate, hard-working, honest experts and doctors and you know, you're
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.680]  worried that there will be a lapse in confidence if this continues and health bodies don't
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:49.680]  sort it out.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.300]  Well, doctor, is it the bigger issue and affect a lot of other medical doctors who are concerned?
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:55.800]  Take Obama's health care bill.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:00.680]  I mean, a lot of that is where these boards decide the type of care that doctors can give
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:05.960]  and so instead of a knee surgery, you get a cortisone shot or a cane or instead of eye
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:17.200]  surgery, you get glasses or drugs and so it's really the pharmaceutical companies are trying
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:22.480]  to basically expand their markets by changing the way medicine is practiced.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:28.960]  I think pharmaceutical companies will use any methods that they can and you mean market
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:34.120]  directly to doctors, they market directly to patients, something that you guys have
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:39.120]  that we don't have is you have direct to consumer advertising where drug companies can market
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.120]  directly to patients.
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:46.320]  I mean, drug companies are sophisticated and you know, imagine how dumb that is.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:52.080]  They're telling the public to go ask your doctor about restless leg syndrome and then
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:58.160]  the side effects may make you kill yourself or go crazy or be obsessive gambling.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.160]  I'm not kidding.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:04.000]  I mean, these side effects to most of these drugs, it's like having trouble sleeping,
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  jump off a cliff.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.760]  But I think you've said something that's quite interesting there is this idea of disease
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:18.800]  mongering is what we call it, so this creation of syndromes to enable them to market drugs
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:25.280]  and we see, we are seeing more and more of this where you might have prediabetes so a
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.720]  drug company can market a drug based on prediabetes, you might have prehypertension so that is
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:32.440]  just before you have high blood pressure.
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:40.120]  Now these are new conditions and it's what, it's a new term, it's called disease mongering
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.240]  and so there's creation like restless leg syndrome like you're saying, you know, and
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:51.560]  there is this blurring of boundaries where diseases are being almost created to market
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.560]  drugs.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.800]  That is something that we are seeing more and more of and it's something I think that
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.280]  we have to be as a medical profession that we have to be aware of.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:05.080]  Well amazing doctor, we're almost out of time and as this develops maybe in the next month
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:11.600]  or so we can have you pop back in but British Medical Journal is BMJ.com, Dr. Deborah Cohen,
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:15.720]  the article making headlines in literally hundreds of newspapers, it's Conflict of
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:21.880]  Interest Who and the Pandemic Flu Conspiracies, who of course stands for World Health Organization
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:27.760]  and the minute and a half left we've got here, I mean do you think I'm correct in saying
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:33.080]  that the next big pandemic, whether real, hyped or whatever, that if we ever face something
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:38.400]  that really is dangerous, people may not respond like they should because of all the other
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.800]  crying wolf we've seen.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.800]  What's your take on that?
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:48.080]  I don't think that is a real risk and I think one of the problems is that it's very difficult
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:53.480]  to communicate and as a doctor it's very difficult to communicate uncertainty so it's very difficult
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:57.240]  to say to people look guys we're not sure what's going to happen and this is one of
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:01.400]  the problems that's happened with pandemic flu, is that level of uncertainty hasn't been
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:08.360]  communicated and it has been hyped and I think the danger is is when serious does happen
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:14.440]  that people won't listen or just say oh that same thing again and that is the risk and
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:20.880]  hopefully that won't happen and hopefully things won't be hyped and risk will be communicated
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:27.880]  a lot better than it has been, here's the hoping but that is the danger and unless the major
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:33.760]  health organization is addressed certain issues then it will be the public health system that
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:34.760]  loses out.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:41.000]  Absolutely, alright Dr Deborah Cohen from the British Medical Journal, go ahead and get
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.120]  some sleep now we appreciate you staying up to 11, 12 at night and enjoy your British
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.120]  summer over there.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.440]  Thank you very much, thank you for having me on.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.760]  You bet thanks for spending time with us.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.960]  Okay folks I'm going to come back and do a bunch of other news jamming some of your phone
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:29:00.520]  calls, key info straight ahead on the sun, what in the world is going on with the sun?
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.920]  They helped to create a new world order.
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:08.880]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.600]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:13.600]  documents.
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:18.040]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:20.520]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:25.360]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.360]  world.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:31.560]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.040]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:38.520]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.520]  financial system.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:42.400]  Global governance with the establishment of a G20.
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:46.120]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.920]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.

[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000]  Well Marty what do you have to say?
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  Expounder and owner for over 63 years satisfaction is guaranteed on W-Dirtback call us at 1-800-340-7091

[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:05.000]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000]  What have we got?
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.480]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:12.360]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:16.560]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:21.240]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education,
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.240]  our money.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:26.320]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:30.960]  Marty is going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising in the U.N.B.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:31.960]  War.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:34.680]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the bill of rights, we have common
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:35.680]  law.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:39.640]  Knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen and I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:44.320]  Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.280]  that is the American people is rising.

[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:04.600]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:08.920]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:13.240]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.560]  allows you to have.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:20.240]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:24.600]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:28.600]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:32.080]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:35.800]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:40.600]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:44.400]  Folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.720]  my old sponsors.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:51.960]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:33:01.280]  Remember the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:05.040]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:14.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:22.600]  By the way, I coined the term Obamatrons and Obamanoids and it's now popularly used all
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:23.600]  over the media.
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:38.240]  I'm not mad about it, it's just that it's interesting to see stuff we coined being used.
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:46.240]  Remember when he won and had just tuned in, this doesn't mean that we're saying McCain
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.240]  would have been good.
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:49.560]  No, they're both bad, can't you understand?
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.680]  We know it's a false choice.
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:56.520]  But Obama was the heir apparent, they had plates, coins made about him, they described
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.240]  him as if he was Jesus in the mainstream media, people were crying saying, I'm not going to
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:06.600]  have to pay for my car or house or cell phone, oh thank you so much Mr. President, thank
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.600]  you for everything.
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:12.320]  Now the health care bills pass and they go, oh, it doesn't cover pre-existing condition
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:17.400]  and doesn't give you health care and it cuts Medicare and Medicaid and raises taxes, oh
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:22.360]  I'm afraid the insurance companies wrote it as a way to rip you off and make you buy that
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.360]  product.
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:31.200]  Oh yes, oh it's so good, oh it's so enjoyable.
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:35.160]  But here's the good news, Obama loses the left.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:39.680]  Really it's cool to bash about a rock, real name Barry Cetero, everything's fake about
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:40.680]  this guy.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:45.320]  His real name is admittedly Barry Cetero, it's incredible, everything's fake.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:52.440]  Europeans still worship him and Washington's Obamatrons remain smitten, oh they're smitten.
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:59.160]  But former supporters are turning on the president and the article gets into that, oh yeah, in
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.120]  polls like Rasmussen and others, he's below 40.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:07.960]  We've got cooked polls nationally where he's 45, 46, still that's the lowest of any president
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.680]  this far in ever.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:14.720]  The bigger they are, the harder they fall, okay, and it's also been confirmed, we told
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:20.760]  you a month ago, they hire between $400,000 and a million, it varies every month, census
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:24.680]  workers and then they fire them the next month, it's temporary.
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:30.120]  They lay them off and hire them again and then they count that and even with that, I
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:37.000]  have the mainstream media reports here, here's Bloomberg, government jobs account for 95%
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.400]  of May job increases.
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:44.840]  A government job takes two private sector jobs, a green job which isn't a green job,
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:49.880]  it's just the local mafia stealing from you and funding themselves costs two jobs.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:56.040]  So you better figure this out, okay, we're in a depression, we have 23% unemployment,
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:57.960]  not 10 like they tell you.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:02.600]  We have higher inflation than they tell you, you know that, Austin is supposedly the best
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:07.200]  sitting in the country right now, according to Forbes and Money and all these other, and
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.960]  half the restaurants I try to go to are shut down.
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:17.640]  I've been going to this Mexican food restaurant about twice a year for 15 years or longer.
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:21.760]  It's a nice place in North Austin, I'm just going to leave it at that, it's over off of
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:24.160]  around 45th Street or so.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:28.920]  I've been in there twice in the last six months and it's not even half full, they've
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:33.560]  got one little dining room partially full of people.
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:40.880]  Five years ago, you couldn't get in there, okay, everything is falling apart, all right,
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:45.880]  the economy is shot and everything's going to these offshore bankers and on all the money
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:50.280]  goes to interest to the IMF and World Bank, money goes into Africa, it turns right around
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.360]  and goes right back into the bank's hands.
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:56.880]  They have a banker bailout here supposedly for your mortgages, none of it goes to that,
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:59.280]  goes right back to the bankers and bonuses.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:03.760]  They're doing great, they're getting record money, they're setting up their world government,
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:09.600]  they're meeting a Bilderberg group, they're laughing at you, they think this is funny.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:13.040]  And I want to get to a few calls, at least Eddie, Mark, Doug and a few others that are
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:17.600]  holding Colonel Six, 888-201-2244, I've given the number out today, it's always going to
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:26.240]  give the number out, 888-201-2244 on this live six day of June of the Sunday edition.
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:30.360]  But let me get really focused here quickly.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:35.480]  I'm just going to play a minute or two of this, the whole video is up on infowars.com.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:43.120]  This is just such a big deal, the headline is 94% of laws are never read, they're voted
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.640]  on from cell phones.
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:51.600]  The senators don't even have to be there and they don't even read them and that's why 13,
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.640]  he says 13 trillion, it's more like 14 trillion and that's what we currently owe.
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:03.280]  Just like if you have a mortgage and say $2,000 is due this month, but the $200,000 mortgage
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:07.480]  you really owe $400,000 on the note because of interest.
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:11.880]  So if they're telling you 13 trillion and currently it's 14 trillion, Senator DeMitt's
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.680]  wrong, it's almost 14 trillion now, it's currently due right now, but that's like you owe $2,000
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:25.440]  this month on a $400,000 mortgage, comprende, but just to understand the level of the criminality,
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:29.880]  the government throws the book at you, the government squeezes you and audits you and
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:34.080]  takes money you don't owe and puts penalties on you and they've got all these new taxes.
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:39.440]  But meanwhile, they don't read 94% of the bills and lobbyists just come in and just
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:44.720]  give them the bill and they say basically how Hitler and they pass it.
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:48.960]  That's why it's Obama spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:54.920]  Bush spent more than the last, you know, group of presidents triple the size of government.
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.900]  They are raping everything.
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:57.900]  They are looting.
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:58.900]  They're going for broke.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:00.620]  They're not going to stop.
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:02.040]  Do you understand?
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.040]  They're not going away.
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:08.040]  They have made the criminal decision to rob everything.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:12.960]  None of you are safe, not your first amendment, not your private property, not your farms,
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:16.320]  your ranches, your businesses, the carbon taxes.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.120]  This is a criminal takeover.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:23.760]  This is a revolution by offshore financial interest with a corporate takeover.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.760]  It's a whole other story.
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.280]  I'm going to try to tell it tomorrow.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:27.280]  I've got video.
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:28.280]  I'm going to get it off my iPhone.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:33.680]  I took my kids fishing on Barton Creek in Austin and it's been raining a lot in the
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:34.680]  last few months.
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.680]  So it was flowing.
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:39.040]  I'm going to try Bed Creek, but little perch get in it because it's been wet the last year.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:43.400]  And, you know, it's easy to catch perch and the kids have fun in my two-year-old, two-and-a-half-year-old
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:44.400]  caught her first fish.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.600]  It was very exciting.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:53.240]  And I saw the commies destroying the dam.
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:57.040]  Little rock dam that the city puts up so that when the creek stops flowing, little areas
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.720]  still have pools.
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.160]  And the commies just tore the dam out and let the water out.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.520]  And I was there two weeks ago with them and saw one of them creeping around, trying to
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:07.920]  move rocks when nobody was looking.
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:13.000]  Well, I went down there and they had removed all the big rocks and had let almost all the
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.520]  water out.
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:19.280]  And because they don't like human progress, it's a gang takeover.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:22.880]  They bash out your SUV windows at Zilker Park.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:23.880]  They attack people.
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:26.380]  You know about them burning down ski resorts.
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:27.480]  They want your property.
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:28.480]  They want your house.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.680]  And they work for the big banks.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:30.920]  Now, they don't know it.
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:40.360]  They're like little colt, automaton robots, Obamatrons, Obamatons, Obama, Obama.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:44.000]  But they think, they want to wild things.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.320]  They call it rewilding.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:50.840]  They think a little dam, which the water goes over, is about two feet high, just rocks piled
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:54.640]  up that the city put there, by the way, they think those are evil.
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.120]  And they put sticks across the paths, not wanting you down there.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:03.200]  Folks, these are very dangerous people, but side issue, I'm already digressing.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:08.120]  Because it goes into the mindset, they're akin to people that drive in the fast lane
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:12.040]  slow and sit there with enjoyment and get mad when you drive around them and try to
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:14.360]  block you.
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:15.360]  They're mentally retarded.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.520]  They have no destiny.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:17.880]  They have no soul.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:22.960]  All they want to do is hold people back, trying to develop a name for them, but basically
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:29.480]  destructo goblins or control freak creatures.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.480]  Progress haters.
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:33.880]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.000]  They're the ones that want your guns.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  They want your property.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.160]  They can't produce anything.
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.160]  They just want to run your life.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.600]  They want to suck you dry.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.800]  And they run the Congress, the big banks do, and 94% of the bills aren't even voted on.
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:47.360]  Let's go ahead and play this clip, just to give you an idea of how totally lawless the
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.440]  government is.
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.440]  Here is Senator DeMitt.
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:54.640]  And I appreciate him willing to put some solutions forth here.
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:42:00.400]  But I think it's really important that we talk about the bigger picture when we talk
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:02.440]  about secret holes.
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:05.800]  And I do want to make it clear I'm not interested in holding anything in secret.
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:10.120]  As a matter of fact, whenever we do, as part of steering or personally, we let the cloak
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:15.520]  room know they can tell anyone they want that we're holding a bill.
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.400]  So I'm not trying to preserve any kind of aspect of a secret hole, but I think it is
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:25.800]  important that America know what we're talking about here.
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:33.080]  At this point in the Senate, 94% of all the bills are past unanimous consent.
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.080]  94%.
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:38.600]  So this is hardly a lack of productivity.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:40.200]  We're going to come back with this.
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:43.720]  We're going to come back and finish it and then take a few calls and get to a bunch of
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:44.720]  the news.
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:46.440]  We're going to come back with a sign.
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:49.680]  And again, with all this government fair mongering, it's probably just that.
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:54.600]  But I mean, I'm reading this NASA report and they're acting like, you know, this is
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:57.960]  the movie, The Knowing or something with Nick Cage.
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:59.960]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:04.200]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:08.520]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:09.520]  do you want?
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:14.680]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:16.560]  Food is your only ammunition.
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:17.800]  How much do you want?
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:18.800]  When do you want it?
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.840]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:21.960]  When will you need it?
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:24.080]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.440]  Will there be any food?
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.880]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:31.040]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:32.200]  and be immunized?
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:36.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.560]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.800]  How much will you need?
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:41.800]  We don't know.
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:42.800]  How much do you want?
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:43.800]  All you can get.
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:44:06.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.680]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.160]  into the bloodstream.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:16.600]  By breathing the solution through the lungs, the respiratory system is the first line of
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:19.480]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:24.720]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:31.000]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.320]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:40.640]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:45.920]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:52.160]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.440]  Lungs Generator.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:45:00.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.640]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:04.640]  generator.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.960]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:13.320]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.320]  allows you to have.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:20.320]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:24.640]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:28.640]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:32.120]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:35.840]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.520]  Number five, a solar-powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:44.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.760]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.560]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:04.080]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:08.680]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:10.360]  and operated American company.
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:15.160]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.840]  these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:21.800]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:22.800]  anywhere.

[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:42.200]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:46.080]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:28.840]  All right, I want to jam in a few calls here.
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:31.600]  I'm sorry I didn't take many today, it's just so much news.
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:34.360]  Get back tomorrow at 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:40.520]  If you've been on your local AM and FM station, you can just check out infowars.com, brismplanet.com.
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:46.280]  XM carries the last hour every night, re-hears it, and they re-hear the full show on Saturdays,
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:49.680]  but they're looking around to pick up the whole show, so that's good too.
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:54.600]  This is from NASA, this is from the NASA website.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:48:00.600]  It says, as the sun awakens, NASA keeps a wary eye on space weather, and then they go
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:05.040]  on to say it's the most incredible thing, the sun did cool off, but now looks like it's
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:12.720]  going to put off some of the biggest ejections of radiation and Coriolis gases we've ever
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.720]  seen, these big solar flares, and then later you find out they want a bunch of satellites
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:19.000]  to monitor it.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.400]  So they're just fear-mongering to get funding.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:24.440]  But the point is, the Earth is always changing.
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.160]  We get hit by meteorites.
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:27.160]  We have earthquakes.
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.360]  We have giant volcanoes.
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:29.360]  We have tornadoes.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:33.080]  And I heard about the tornadoes today, and they were saying global warming is doing it.
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:35.160]  We've always had tornadoes, folks.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:42.880]  What do you think, you know, in Wizard of Oz, Dorothy has a storm cellar.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.360]  I know Wizard of Oz isn't real.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:47.360]  The point is, that's why people used to have storm cellars.
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.720]  Now you just pay Al Gore some money, and then he waves a magic wand and fixes it.
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:55.560]  As the sun awakens, NASA keeps a wary eye on space weather.
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:49:00.280]  Earth and space are about to come into contact in a way that's new to human history.
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:01.760]  What does that mean?
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:02.760]  Total fear-mongering.
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:06.920]  To make preparations, authorities in Washington, D.C. are holding a meeting, the Space Weather
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:10.720]  Enterprise Forum at the National Press Club on June 8th.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:16.520]  Richard Fisher, head of NASA's Hello Physics Division, explains what it's all about.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.840]  The sun is waking up from a deep slumber.
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:22.920]  And in the next few years, we expect to see much higher levels of solar activity.
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:28.200]  At the same time, our technology, society has developed an unprecedented sensitivity
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:29.520]  to solar storms.
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:35.080]  The intersection of these two issues is what we're beginning to discuss together.
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:37.960]  And it goes on to say, you know, record ejections from the sun.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.960]  You can go read the full report.
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:45.440]  I mean, really, fear-mongering here, but don't worry, they'll have a tax you can pay.
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:49.480]  Bill Gates has got a trillion-dollar program you can pay for as taxpayers.
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:55.480]  He'll have stuff added to jet fuel to spray aluminum dioxide in the sky to block the sun's
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.480]  radiation.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:58.080]  Oh, I'm afraid they're already doing it.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.400]  It's called Kim Drills, but now they've announced it to everyone.
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:01.920]  I have all the documents.
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:03.480]  I'm working on a film on it right now, folks.
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:05.680]  They're terraforming, geoengineering.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:06.960]  These people think they're God.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:11.960]  They've already done all sorts of crazy stuff and basically spinning to the public what
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.520]  they're really up to.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:20.720]  Partly, you know, I know this is going down to Galveston all my life and taking the tours
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:26.160]  and having the local, you know, people with degrees in it describe how one beach will
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:28.480]  get bigger while another gets smaller.
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:29.880]  And some years the water goes up.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.080]  Some years the water goes down.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:32.960]  The moon is what's powering it.
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:36.360]  Man has no control over the tides.
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:37.880]  And some islands get bigger.
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:38.880]  Some get smaller.
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:41.880]  You can go Google, say, San Francisco water levels.
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:46.000]  Goes back over 150 years where they've kept an exact measurement there at the port.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.600]  And overall, 150 years ago it was a lot higher.
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:51.600]  Then it went lower.
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:52.600]  Then it went higher again.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:54.520]  But right now it's several inches lower.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:56.440]  And so is the rest of the world, on average.
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.440]  Doesn't matter.
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:58.440]  They teach your kids.
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:50:59.440]  We're all drowning.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:00.440]  The ice caps already melted.
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:01.440]  We're all dead.
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:02.440]  It's not true.
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:05.360]  They get bigger in the winter, smaller in the summer.
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:08.240]  Every summer they point a satellite at it and say, look, it's shrinking.
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:10.480]  They don't tell you it gets big again in the winter, though.
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:12.920]  They trade you like morons.
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:15.720]  And there's just hundreds of reports out in the last week.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:18.640]  Pacific islands growing, not shrinking due to climate change.
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:21.640]  Is that a one in telegraph?
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:26.960]  Low-lying Pacific islands, regardless of this poster child, they always have the land grabbing.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:27.960]  They're not environmentalists.
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:28.960]  They're pirates.
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:30.160]  They go, give us your property.
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:31.160]  It's for the earth.
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:32.960]  And you go, OK, gee, I will.
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:33.960]  They go, thank you.
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:34.960]  It's mine.
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:36.720]  You know, we're the Green Police.
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:38.280]  We got submachine guns.
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:40.200]  I mean, that's what they're into, folks.
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:42.560]  They're not playing games.
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:46.200]  Low-lying Pacific islands, regardless of this poster child, examples of the threat from rising
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:51.000]  sea levels, are expanding, not sinking, a new study has revealed.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.360]  Scientists have been surprised by the findings, which show that some islands have grown by
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:01.560]  almost one-third over the last 60 years because the water level's going down.
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:04.440]  And it doesn't matter.
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:07.880]  Islands get built by volcanic thrust.
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:10.120]  They can get built by tectonic thrust.
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:15.040]  They can get created by changes in the moon and the sun that drive the atmosphere that
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:20.000]  change the currents of the ocean of their sandbar islands, like the inner coastal on
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.160]  Texas.
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.440]  It's not going anywhere, boys and girls.
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:28.240]  Some beaches on the Texas coast aren't there that were there 50 years ago.
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:31.360]  And areas 50 years ago that didn't have beach have got beach.
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:32.360]  It changes.
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.760]  You know, they're now saying it isn't global warming.
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:36.280]  It's climate change.
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.400]  We can't have change.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.960]  We got seasons.
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:41.400]  We got cycles.
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:46.560]  There was a drought almost bankrupt my farming family, and he's Texas in the 50s.
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:48.440]  Then they had times when it flooded.
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:52.480]  It had nothing to do with cars, ladies and gentlemen, zero.
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:56.760]  But if they can scare the daylights out of your kids in school and get them to give up
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:53:01.840]  their property rights in the future, the social engineers would love it.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:02.840]  And it goes on.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:06.400]  It's just, look, you better find out what they're teaching your kids because everywhere
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.640]  they're brainwashing them.
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:11.960]  Meanwhile, real environmental issues like genetic engineering, and I didn't even get
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:12.960]  to that today.
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:14.120]  I covered it some Friday.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:16.120]  I mean, look at these articles.
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:19.720]  I've got two folders full of mainstream news articles and the studies.
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:28.200]  U.S., Russia, China, you name it, brain reprogramming vaccines that attack your brain, PBS, billionaire
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:34.200]  club, bid to overpopulation again, GMO, GMO food lobby, help drop critical report.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:38.400]  I mean, crucial report on Britain's food supplies, saying it's safe.
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:43.000]  Then I've got all the other real reports, the actual studies, genetically modified foods
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:48.160]  causing long-term sterility in every mammal species, including humans they tested on.
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:50.600]  Research links, genetically modified food to long-term sterility.
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:52.600]  I mean, you're being sterilized.
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:53.960]  They've engineered them to do it.
[01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:55.080]  I've got all the documents.
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:54:00.600]  I've got the White House science are who talks about Kim trailing you and controlling the
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:07.400]  weather in eco science talking about GMO food to sterilize your bite and fluoride that reduces
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:08.400]  fertility.
[01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:10.120]  They're not playing games.
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:13.000]  Comprende, Eddie in New Hampshire, you're on the air.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  Go ahead.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:21.880]  Hey, Alex, regarding the H1N1, I know the mainstream media pumped that we're going to have a lot
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:25.640]  of deaf tools, but luckily we didn't see that.
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:29.720]  How likely is the population reduction in their main goal that they release something
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:30.720]  more lethal?
[01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:31.720]  Oh, yeah, they are.
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:34.880]  And that's what I said a year and a half ago, and I appreciate your good point, is that
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:39.800]  I believe that beta test of the flu, and I announced it three months before it was news,
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:44.560]  was going to be just a big drill to put the federalization, internationalization, to put
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:50.200]  the who, the you in, in charge of all global responses instead of blow up in their face.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:51.200]  These people are not God.
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:53.200]  They're not invincible.
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:55.760]  And yes, they've got weather weapons.
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:55:00.400]  I've interviewed the former head of naval weapons, Ben Livingston, meteorologists.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:02.760]  They could control hurricanes in 67.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:04.680]  That's in my new film.
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:09.880]  So they can carry out all sorts of tyrannical weather attacks to scare us into, you know,
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:11.400]  I'll give all my freedom up.
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:14.200]  Just don't make the, you know, the thunder god get me.
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:17.440]  I mean, this is the way which doctors control people 10,000 years ago.
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:20.880]  They'd say, give me the best hut, the best women, the best food, or the Boonga Boonga
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:22.280]  guy will eat the moon.
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:23.840]  Then there'd be an eclipse.
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:24.840]  Everybody'd freak out.
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.880]  See the Boonga Boonga God ate it.
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:27.880]  Give me more power.
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:28.880]  Booga Booga.
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:30.360]  Then the, the eclipse would end.
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:32.760]  He'd say the snake got to spit it back out.
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:33.760]  That's all they're doing.
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:36.400]  They just come in with some weather weapons, cause some floods.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:37.400]  You bag them up.
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:38.680]  Oh, take my ranch.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.680]  That will fix it.
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:42.760]  Al Gore's like, absolutely that will fix everything.
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:44.520]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Texas.
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.520]  You're on the air.
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:46.520]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:52.000]  Hey, hey, boy, um, monkey business or creator creature.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.960]  I think we've, we're, we're dealing with all these crazy people.
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:58.080]  I, I just, I guess, you're dealing with con artists.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:03.520]  The world is run by made off type con artists and they, and they run scams on everybody
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:05.120]  and the public loves being scammed.
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.960]  The scammers told the public that there's no elite and that powerful groups don't meet
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:12.560]  and that there's no such thing as special interest.
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:17.840]  And so the public went, I'll just suck my thumb and watch TV, I'll, I'll watch football.
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:21.400]  And now they wonder why everything's being robbed because the public acted like a bunch
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:22.400]  of idiots.
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:23.400]  Sorry.
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:24.400]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.400]  Yeah.
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:26.400]  No way.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:27.400]  You're right.
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:30.720]  I'm, I'm trying to correct and do the best I can with things and drink more fluoride.
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:31.720]  It's good.
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:34.640]  It's completely normal that they put a chemical weapon in the water supply.
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:36.560]  No one should try to get it taken out of the city water.
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:38.000]  The government loves us.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  Everything is fine.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  Doesn't matter.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.600]  I have government textbooks by the White House science are how they're murdering us with
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:43.600]  it.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:44.600]  Does it matter?
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:45.600]  I'm the crazy one.
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:47.600]  I shouldn't get upset about that, Mark.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:49.680]  I should drink more government water here.
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:50.680]  I've got some right here.
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:52.680]  I'm going to drink it right now.
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:57.760]  This whole, uh, this whole insurance, these people are all tied in together too.
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:03.440]  It's almost, uh, I'm wondering if there's something that, um, we could, I don't know
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:07.200]  if I could take some, uh, the opinions from people on something about that Hebrews nine
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:09.840]  that we read last week that seemed to give us some power to help.
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:10.840]  I hear you, Mark.
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:11.840]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:12.840]  We're just flat out of time.
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:14.600]  And I'm sorry, everybody else.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:17.600]  It's holding Ernie, Randy, Sonny, David, colonel six, everybody else.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:22.040]  You can call me back tomorrow, 11 to three central or back next Sunday, four to six PM.
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:23.040]  Uh, you know what?
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:26.160]  I mean, it's, it's, it's normal to be upset about this.
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:31.840]  You got 76 new vaccines being put out by Bill Gates, 30 plus of them are for sterilization.
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:33.520]  You understand this isn't a game.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:37.840]  Uh, you understand you, yuppies out there go good, get rid of all the poor people.
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:40.120]  The globalists see you as trash too.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:43.280]  Did you get a memo not to drink the sodium fluoride water?
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:46.240]  You know, why don't you get up off your butt and get the government to take it out of
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:47.240]  the water?
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:48.240]  Well, I'm crew.
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.240]  God bless you all.
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:58:17.240]  Thank you.
