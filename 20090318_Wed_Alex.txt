[00:54.120 --> 01:00.040]  Missouri back on not because he's introduced legislation to reaffirm the 9th and 10th amendment
[01:00.040 --> 01:05.880]  of state sovereignty but because he is aware of the Missouri State Police document issued by the
[01:05.880 --> 01:11.800]  governor the Mayak report stating that bumper stickers Ron Paul support libertarian support
[01:11.800 --> 01:16.120]  if you're against the North American Union that you want to basically kill police and that you're
[01:16.120 --> 01:22.680]  a white supremacist I mean that's what it says and a audio interview with one of the Mayak officers
[01:22.680 --> 01:27.560]  that we talked to so we've confirmed we've talked to this individual but we didn't record it
[01:28.440 --> 01:32.760]  a reporter did talk to them and record it and we're gonna be playing that audio
[01:32.760 --> 01:38.680]  coming up here where they deny that bumper stickers are mentioned when bumper stickers are
[01:38.680 --> 01:44.120]  mentioned repeatedly in the document in the Mayak report also Lou Dobbs has done a report on Mayak

[08:29.400 --> 08:31.560]  do you want to chime in
[08:34.680 --> 08:41.160]  on the fact that 9.7 trillion has been stolen by foreign banks and they won't tell the public
[08:41.160 --> 08:46.040]  where the money went meanwhile barack obama and his minions are running around saying they do nothing
[08:46.040 --> 08:51.480]  about the bailout they're angry about the bailout they had no idea this was going to bonuses when
[08:51.480 --> 08:57.560]  he engineered the bailout his entire administration on the financial end of the very people that
[08:57.560 --> 09:03.800]  engineered this back in the 90s bush of course worked with them closely it's one unified group
[09:06.200 --> 09:10.520]  and then now they're running around saying we promise now chuckie shivers all over the news
[09:10.520 --> 09:15.800]  senator schumer who was calling for a total gunman for the american people an absolute tyrant
[09:15.800 --> 09:24.200]  he says hey give the money back or we will take it 160 million dollars out of 9.7 trillion and so
[09:24.200 --> 09:29.400]  they'll have endless debates and endless discussions and probably even hearings and they'll call in
[09:29.400 --> 09:34.840]  these ceo's and people and say how dare you take three million dollars and there won't be any
[09:34.840 --> 09:42.920]  discussion about the shareholders of the private central banks that got 9.7 trillion that is the
[09:42.920 --> 09:51.240]  big issue and you won't hear it discussed anywhere it'll be there so mad about the 169 million the
[09:51.240 --> 10:01.960]  people are so upset that the same bait and switch was done with rick perry saying i'm a conservative
[10:01.960 --> 10:08.760]  i'm not going to take the tens of billions of bailout money and the economic stimulus package
[10:09.480 --> 10:16.120]  that was sent to texas i'm going to give 555 million back which is a very small amount of the
[10:16.120 --> 10:21.800]  money but it creates the illusion oh perry gave all the bailout money back perry gave all the
[10:21.800 --> 10:28.200]  stimulus package money back just more stunts we like if you caught somebody robbing a bank
[10:28.200 --> 10:33.160]  and they've got a van just full of hundred dollar bills and the police pull up and they say you know
[10:33.160 --> 10:38.120]  what i'm going to give you a hundred dollars back and i'm going to keep the million how does
[10:38.120 --> 10:42.200]  that sound and then the police have a big investigation about the hundred dollars and
[10:42.200 --> 10:47.000]  there's big newscast about the hundred dollars and what's going to be done with it will somebody
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.080]  get in trouble for the hundred dollars and then never the discussion of the million dollars
[10:51.080 --> 11:03.720]  and they just run this scam over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[11:03.720 --> 11:13.080]  and over and over and over again this is how they operate this is what they do and until the public
[11:13.080 --> 11:17.800]  figures out the tricks they're going to continue to be enslaved we're going to continue to lose
[11:17.800 --> 11:21.320]  more and more liberties and freedoms in this country period
[11:26.200 --> 11:29.640]  nevertheless the public is beginning to figure out a little bit
[11:34.680 --> 11:36.920]  analysis aig bosses
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.280]  are going to have to give back the money again the hundred and sixty
[11:44.280 --> 11:46.280]  something
[11:53.560 --> 11:56.680]  but nothing going on with the trillions
[11:58.520 --> 12:05.080]  and you try to explain to the public 160 million dollars is not 9.7 trillion they just don't
[12:05.080 --> 12:09.400]  understand they just know how to drink fluoride and watch football and act tough and that's why
[12:09.400 --> 12:13.160]  they're slaves and they're taking all the rest of us that are aware and awake right over the
[12:13.160 --> 12:25.640]  edge of the cliff with them and it's a very very disgusting sad thing to have all of this going
[12:25.640 --> 12:32.120]  on but it's part of the awakening process we have to go through pain first aig bosses
[12:35.160 --> 12:40.840]  are in deep deep trouble 400 executives and traders at american international group
[12:40.840 --> 12:46.920]  oh my gosh they're in deep trouble that's kind of like after they did the banker takeover bill
[12:46.920 --> 12:53.080]  october 3rd of last year the media then shifted into should 40 something billion be given to
[12:56.760 --> 13:02.680]  american automakers and then that became the big debate about the 40 something billion instead
[13:02.680 --> 13:06.440]  of the trillions being stolen they use that as a diversion as a distraction
[13:06.440 --> 13:15.240]  and the same thing is being done here aig bonuses new cloud over treasury boss
[13:18.200 --> 13:23.720]  if not distancing itself from treasury secretary timothy geithner the white house is placing firmly
[13:24.920 --> 13:31.000]  on his shoulders responsibility for how the government handled the 165 million and bonuses
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.560]  paid to about 400 executives and traders at american international group ink see geithner's
[13:37.560 --> 13:44.120]  a mid-level minion so they'll burn him they'll make it look like he caused the problem maybe
[13:44.120 --> 13:48.280]  they'll make him leave in a few years after a bunch of hearings and oh every american will
[13:48.280 --> 13:54.600]  know about the 165 million 169 million there's different numbers out there i know i keep repeating
[13:54.600 --> 13:59.720]  that it's just seeing this trick played and boy geithner sure got it and obama sure got punished
[13:59.720 --> 14:05.480]  and oh obama's approval ratings plunging more obama he's running an all-know discussion of
[14:05.480 --> 14:14.440]  the private shareholders of the banks secretary geithner last week engaged with the ceo of aig
[14:16.600 --> 14:23.160]  to communicate what we thought were outrageous and unacceptable bonuses white house spokesman
[14:23.160 --> 14:31.160]  robert gibbs said tuesday then he volunteered to answer a question being asked all over washington
[14:32.440 --> 14:37.640]  did geithner still enjoy president barack obama's confidence given the whopping bonuses
[14:38.600 --> 14:43.640]  the failed insurance giant paid friday after receiving taxpayer bailout money the president
[14:43.640 --> 14:49.480]  has complete confidence in geithner gibbs said is obama satisfied with geithner's information
[14:49.480 --> 14:54.520]  informed him of the impending bonus payments in a timely fashion yes the president is satisfied
[14:59.880 --> 15:05.800]  but then you read this today out from abc news obama administration we didn't find out about
[15:05.800 --> 15:11.240]  aig bonuses until this month i mean they just had bonuses a few months ago these people are
[15:11.240 --> 15:16.440]  constantly this is just one of hundreds of companies sources in the obama administration
[15:16.440 --> 15:21.880]  tuesday said despite previous media reports administration officials did not know until
[15:21.880 --> 15:27.320]  a couple of weeks ago that the officials of the controversial aig financial product division
[15:27.320 --> 15:35.720]  were set to receive 165 million in bonuses on march 13 it wasn't until thursday march 5th
[15:35.720 --> 15:41.320]  2009 administration sources till abc news that officials of the federal reserve bank of new
[15:41.320 --> 15:48.600]  york informed officials of the treasury department of the full extent of the 165 million bonuses
[15:48.600 --> 15:53.880]  pending for the controversial fiscal products subsidiary this was three days after the obama
[15:53.880 --> 16:01.080]  administration had already announced a new commitment from an additional 330 billion for aig
[16:01.720 --> 16:07.800]  that's 30 billion for aig treasury secretary tim geithner was alerted oh he was alerted last
[16:07.800 --> 16:15.400]  thursday march 10th he phoned aig ceo edward liddy on wednesday evening march 11 to protest the
[16:15.400 --> 16:22.920]  bonuses sources told abc news i mean do any of you believe this he put in the executive order
[16:22.920 --> 16:29.560]  a month and a half ago obama did that all the major banks and brokerage firms were exempt
[16:29.560 --> 16:39.720]  from any money that they were previously given in the bailout or under that current
[16:41.960 --> 16:42.920]  bailout plan
[16:51.720 --> 16:56.120]  but the american people aren't paying attention they know they're being robbed but they don't
[16:56.120 --> 17:01.400]  know just how egregious or out in the open it is i mean obama comes out and says listen
[17:01.400 --> 17:06.520]  we're not rewarding failure this is outrageous what you banks and brokerage firms have done
[17:06.520 --> 17:11.640]  and we're not going to allow you to have bonuses and then you read the executive order and it's
[17:11.640 --> 17:15.400]  just like his guantanamo bay thing well we might close it in a year but we're going to open up all
[17:15.400 --> 17:19.960]  these other camps around the world and we're still not going to give people any constitutional
[17:19.960 --> 17:24.360]  rights or even geneva convention rights and we're going to back bush on all of his uh
[17:24.360 --> 17:28.440]  uh court hearings that are going on in the tortures court proceedings that are going on
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.600]  and we're just going to continue the rendition and everything else the kidnapping
[17:34.120 --> 17:38.200]  but it was announced obama closes all the camps he closed guantanamo and i hear
[17:38.760 --> 17:45.320]  you know quote liberals which are just establishment lap dogs posing as liberals all over talk radio
[17:45.880 --> 17:51.720]  and on the left channel on xm you know every day hey close guantanamo what more he asking for
[17:51.720 --> 17:59.800]  now the thing is still open but it's just like for these ceo's and executives they say in there
[17:59.800 --> 18:04.200]  that oh any bailout money previously or any bailout deals that were agreed to last year
[18:04.200 --> 18:09.800]  which go on in perpetuity i mean you read that bailout bill unlimited money in total secrecy
[18:09.800 --> 18:16.200]  forever so under the unlimited authority unlimited power no investigation allowed can do whatever they
[18:16.200 --> 18:22.360]  want under that plan sure as long as you're signed on to that plan you can do whatever you want
[18:24.680 --> 18:29.240]  and that's why the white house went and encouraged and obama encouraged when he was a senator and
[18:29.240 --> 18:34.040]  the whole gaggle of crooks encouraged every company out there hey take this money you're
[18:34.040 --> 18:41.160]  getting in on the ground floor of the looting you know us pirates we take care of each other

[25:36.680 --> 25:41.800]  did a youtube video with this interview and show close-ups of the my act federally written
[25:41.800 --> 25:45.320]  report that goes out to all the state police around the nation this is just the missouri version

[25:56.200 --> 26:01.160]  but continuing with the financial news so the obama administration saying they're not involved
[26:01.160 --> 26:05.240]  with the bailout they're not involved with the bonuses and their grandstanding with the diversion
[26:05.240 --> 26:09.800]  over a hundred and sixty five million dollars not the nine point seven trillion that's the bottom
[26:09.800 --> 26:19.720]  line there uh meanwhile billions and billions of dollars a week are being injected into foreign
[26:19.720 --> 26:24.520]  banks by the private federal reserve of your tax money and they're not telling congress where the
[26:24.520 --> 26:28.440]  money's going and refused to answer the questions and we played house members and members of the
[26:28.440 --> 26:32.840]  senate asking those questions of bernacky head of the private federal reserve of course treasury
[26:32.840 --> 26:37.160]  secretary tim geithner and they just want to answer the question meanwhile the moscow times
[26:37.160 --> 26:45.640]  reports at g20 kremlin to pitch new global currency now the reason this is happening is the european
[26:45.640 --> 26:50.680]  union and the private central banks in the west that form the new world order are setting up their
[26:50.680 --> 26:55.480]  new global currency that will be issued by a private group of banking families that's the
[26:55.480 --> 27:01.160]  one in telegraph and russia and china are saying no we need a new global currency
[27:01.160 --> 27:06.440]  that we have a say in so they're all at the table debating how they're going to set up their world
[27:06.440 --> 27:11.560]  government bottom line it'll be a new global currency controlled by banks the kremlin published
[27:11.560 --> 27:16.360]  its priorities monday for an upcoming meeting of the g20 calling for the creation of a super
[27:16.360 --> 27:21.800]  national reserve currency to be used by international institutions as part of a reform of the global
[27:21.800 --> 27:28.600]  financial system that means the end of the dollar that's all we had left not manufacturing not jobs
[27:28.600 --> 27:37.240]  nothing all we really had left other than sports teams and hollywood uh was the fact that we had
[27:37.240 --> 27:44.040]  the world reserve fiat currency that's now coming to an end very very soon and then all the tens
[27:44.040 --> 27:48.280]  of trillions the bankers print up of our money to buy things won't be worth anything anymore but they
[27:48.280 --> 27:53.320]  don't care they're moving on to a new currency they're creating international monetary funds
[27:53.320 --> 27:58.200]  should investigate the possible creation of a new reserve currency widening the list of reserve
[27:58.200 --> 28:05.320]  currencies or using its already existing special drawing rights or sdr's as a super reserve currency
[28:05.320 --> 28:10.280]  accepted by the whole international community the kremlin said in a statement issued on its website
[28:10.280 --> 28:16.040]  the sdr is a international reserve asset created by the imf in 69 to supplement the existing
[28:16.680 --> 28:22.520]  official reserves of member countries the kremlin has persistently criticized the dollar status as
[28:22.520 --> 28:27.160]  the dominant global reserve currency and has lowered its own dollar holdings the last few years
[28:27.160 --> 28:35.480]  both president dmitry uh medvedev and president uh prime minister vladimir putin have repeatedly
[28:35.480 --> 28:41.800]  called for the ruble to be used as a regional reserve currency although the idea has received
[28:41.800 --> 28:46.680]  little support outside of russia analysts said the new kremlin proposal would elicit little
[28:46.680 --> 28:53.240]  excitement among the g20 members this is all in the realm of fantasy said sergey premivo
[28:53.240 --> 29:00.280]  chief strategist at ray man and gore there was a situation that resembled what they're talking
[29:00.280 --> 29:04.920]  about it was called a gold standard and it ended very badly alternatives to the dollar are still
[29:04.920 --> 29:10.200]  hard to find he said the kremlin's call for a common currency is not the first in recent days
[29:10.920 --> 29:18.600]  speaking at a economic conference in kazikistan last week the president proposed a global currency
[29:18.600 --> 29:30.840]  called the ak metal a conflation of the world's akmi and capital all right we come back i'm going

[33:28.600 --> 33:35.160]  joe clark of mayak out of missouri uh saying things that aren't true saying there's nothing about

[33:41.640 --> 33:45.640]  can go read the report it's right there but it doesn't matter the public's still in denial about
[33:45.640 --> 33:50.120]  it anyway so they're still in denial about a north american union or that there's even an
[33:50.120 --> 33:54.600]  international banking cartel known as the new world order and that is why you're going to be
[33:54.600 --> 34:02.600]  hurt very very bad us kicks iran war prep into high gear this on the heels of benjamin yetan yahu
[34:02.600 --> 34:10.120]  the newly elected um israeli prime minister for the second time now back in office saying that
[34:10.120 --> 34:15.880]  they are preparing for a huge war with iran just days after the top u.s commander sketched out plans
[34:15.880 --> 34:22.520]  to strike iran the u.s military claims tehran sent a drone into iraq in february the u.s military
[34:22.520 --> 34:27.720]  on monday claimed that american jets had shot down an iranian unmanned surveillance aircraft 97
[34:27.720 --> 34:37.240]  kilometers northeast of bagdad in february the ababil 3 was tracked for 70 minutes before it
[34:37.240 --> 34:44.360]  was shot down well inside iraqi airspace reads a statement from the army even if that's true they
[34:44.360 --> 34:49.800]  admit that for six years well hobbyist that's al qaeda backed groups including the number three
[34:49.800 --> 34:54.920]  men in al qaeda have been attacking iran inside backed up by the united states and that's the
[34:54.920 --> 35:00.120]  white house admits that that's right al qaeda works for the white house i'm sorry that sounds crazy
[35:00.120 --> 35:07.080]  that's just a fact um the statement also suggests the aircraft's presence over iraq was not an
[35:07.080 --> 35:13.240]  accident u.s claims comes just two days after admiral michael mullen chairman of the joint
[35:13.240 --> 35:20.120]  jesus staff spoke of the next possible u.s target iran what i worry about in terms of an attack on
[35:20.120 --> 35:25.960]  iran is in addition to the immediate effect the effect of the attack is the unintended consequences
[35:25.960 --> 35:31.560]  mullen said we've got a very strong strategic reserve in our air force and our navy and in that
[35:31.560 --> 35:38.280]  fact in that part of the world is a maritime part of the world where the emphasis would certainly be
[35:38.280 --> 35:45.240]  on those two forces he told charlie rose the on the cfr bill deberg group tv show charlie rose is
[35:45.240 --> 35:49.320]  like their official spokesman's where they go on to make their world government announcements iran
[35:49.320 --> 35:55.000]  on tuesday said it has no information on the alleged drone which has been described as a
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.480]  surveillance and intelligence gathering plane with a maximum range about 150 kilometers
[35:59.480 --> 36:07.400]  foreign ministry spokesman haseen koshavi told reporters in tehran that the ministry was unaware
[36:07.400 --> 36:12.280]  of the incident mentioned in the vague report issued by the u.s military now remember that
[36:13.400 --> 36:18.520]  many many times i mean it's got to be more than 20 times we've heard this that i ran as giving arms
[36:19.800 --> 36:26.760]  to shiites in iraq in the south and in the east and then it always turns out it's not true
[36:26.760 --> 36:33.640]  and remember this is the same crowd that claimed iraq had wmds and was about to attack the us
[36:33.640 --> 36:37.560]  and had nukes and all the rest of it and lied about it they weren't wrong they lied about it
[36:38.840 --> 36:44.920]  this is the same crowd that claimed that iranian pt boats pulled up beside us destroyers and said
[36:44.920 --> 36:52.920]  we're going to kill you we're going to bomb you we're firing in 30 seconds and i went on air and
[36:52.920 --> 36:59.800]  i said listen to the recording i mean it's clearly a westerner even faking a voice yes i'm going to
[36:59.800 --> 37:05.640]  get you now going to blow you up and later they admitted oh it was some prank on a ham radio
[37:06.920 --> 37:13.800]  and then it came out msnbc new yorker magazine that dick chaney wanted to stage in that very area
[37:13.800 --> 37:24.760]  and the straight of hormose fake blue us manufactured fake iranian pt boats with navy
[37:24.760 --> 37:34.040]  seals dressed up like iranians on board attacking large us surface vessels
[37:34.040 --> 37:44.200]  okay so remember the crowd we're dealing with and then fox fowlin the head of scent com at the time
[37:45.480 --> 37:53.000]  out there on the aircraft carrier said that's it i resign and it came out that he was upset about
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.720]  the stage terror plan but also the plan which they executed to order the entire fleet within range
[37:59.720 --> 38:07.480]  of iranian sunburn missiles they have more than 11 000 sunburn missiles even with the
[38:07.480 --> 38:14.280]  different gatling gun systems they have to shoot down missiles surface to air anti-missile guns
[38:16.680 --> 38:23.640]  the naval war college and others and top brass predicted that every ship would be heavily damaged
[38:23.640 --> 38:34.280]  and some would be lost i mean can you imagine 11 000 plus french and russian may they don't just
[38:34.280 --> 38:43.800]  have sunburns silkworms the list goes on and on being launched at one time at the vessels but
[38:45.080 --> 38:53.320]  their range is only about 150 miles so what did the bush administration do they had the aircraft
[38:53.320 --> 38:58.760]  carriers moved into within 50 miles close in range you know even if you're going to be 100
[38:58.760 --> 39:02.040]  miles out that gives you more time to track the missiles to prepare a response to them
[39:03.080 --> 39:07.400]  to try to shoot them down what's it called the aegis system those huge high-powered gatling
[39:07.400 --> 39:13.240]  guns that they've got out on the decks of those ships that from miles away can you know shoot
[39:13.240 --> 39:20.120]  down a whole covey of missiles coming in it's a missile defense system and they've got other
[39:20.120 --> 39:27.240]  systems as well they've got c-130s and dc-10s with chemical lasers in them they reportedly
[39:27.240 --> 39:32.200]  have more than a dozen of those flying around out there in the gulf and they can sit there at a
[39:32.200 --> 39:42.360]  distance zapping missiles oh but no we have to move the ships right up against iranian territory
[39:42.360 --> 39:46.760]  also so there can be all that shipping and all those iranian patrol boats and so they can
[39:46.760 --> 39:52.440]  you know try to get some event going we had a lot of former top cia analysts on like rama govern and
[39:52.440 --> 39:57.320]  others and they said their number one fear this is a year before it broke in the news that they'd
[39:57.320 --> 40:00.920]  heard word they were planning to stage some type of gulf of tonkin event right there in the straight
[40:00.920 --> 40:05.720]  of our moose so so it's on record i know some of you think it's patriotic to attack our own ships

[49:25.400 --> 49:31.720]  to think of the magnitude that's what i'm telling police and military when you're done following
[49:31.720 --> 49:36.280]  their orders to bring down america and enforce the takeover you're gonna you would have destroyed
[49:36.280 --> 49:41.640]  yourself you're cutting your own nose off despite your face you know what i had a thought about
[49:41.640 --> 49:48.760]  that mr jones and that is i think that the powers that be are trying to incite the people to violence
[49:48.760 --> 49:55.160]  i agree i agree so that they can round us all up and put us away why do you think they keep
[49:55.160 --> 49:59.800]  introducing the idea of rioting and and and even i think like it's a good thing on the news
[50:00.520 --> 50:06.840]  and they want rioting they want dead cops in military and then society will break down
[50:06.840 --> 50:11.960]  then they'll bring in more troops behind them they want it and they want it bad and i want i think
[50:11.960 --> 50:17.640]  the listeners the ones that are the militias that listen to this show should cooler heads prevail
[50:17.640 --> 50:21.720]  it's got to be done by stealth get a coordinated if they're going to do something make sure it's
[50:21.720 --> 50:28.040]  coordinated and fast well what's going to happen is they're going to push people into corners
[50:28.920 --> 50:34.520]  with gun confiscation you know when rioting is going on food confiscation and so when people
[50:34.520 --> 50:38.200]  just fight back because they don't want to see their kid pulled away from them put on an army
[50:38.200 --> 50:42.920]  truck you'll be called a terrorist if you don't want to be injected with a deadly smallpox or
[50:42.920 --> 50:48.760]  anthrax or bird flu shot you'll be a terrorist and then they want to have society break down

[56:03.640 --> 56:08.360]  well perry perry would have lost the election but they did that big four-way race so he could win
[56:08.360 --> 56:16.040]  you know he won with the minority what was it like 39 of the vote and uh it's just a criminal
[56:16.040 --> 56:22.600]  elite and education is the way to go i mean the texas legislature breaks state law every time
[56:22.600 --> 56:28.360]  they vote they allow the representatives to vote for each other and they do it right there on camera
[56:28.360 --> 56:34.360]  not even caring that's how corrupt the culture is we're just like mexico or north korea we are
[56:34.360 --> 56:39.560]  collapsing because the criminals are just snatching and grabbing all the money for themselves and they
[56:39.560 --> 56:44.440]  don't care and most of the elites are moving out of the country they know they've stolen is so blind
[56:44.440 --> 56:48.840]  they're just going to let us collapse and then be a third world cesspit with paramilitary police
[56:48.840 --> 56:54.440]  running all over it's just like mexico well i i guess what i was getting at is if you could

[57:34.920 --> 57:39.800]  the border themselves the minute that happened the fed sent more trips to the border um
[57:40.680 --> 57:45.480]  we are trying to educate the public we're trying to get them to realize what's happening but for
[57:45.480 --> 57:50.040]  decades they were told there's no globalism there's no corruption government's only good
[57:50.040 --> 57:54.920]  there's no bad elites and so the bankers are robbing us blind in front of everybody and
[57:54.920 --> 58:00.200]  i'm just here trying to educate the public on how serious the level of thieving and stealing and
[58:00.760 --> 58:07.640]  just outright corruption is see as corruption accelerates it just gets worse and worse and
[58:07.640 --> 58:12.120]  of course that's obvious as it accelerates it gets worse and worse but i mean it literally does
[58:12.760 --> 58:17.320]  and then the criminals get more and more bold and as they commit more and more crimes and don't
[58:17.320 --> 58:22.840]  get in trouble for it they just commit bigger and bigger crimes and so crime becomes goodness

[1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:47.160]  recorded yes it's real it's really happening it's really going on it's got a lot of attention
[1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:52.360]  as they demonize libertarians gun owners people that say they don't want a new world order
[1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:56.360]  basically say we're cop killing terrorist is is what the document states and then we have
[1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:02.520]  bumper stickers were dangerous and evil that have ron paul on them uh so uh that's coming up
[1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:08.840]  right now let's go to dan in wisconsin dan you're on the air alex you're the man
[1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:17.000]  man love your show brother hey um i wanted to uh ask you about a business idea but i'm starting
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:22.040]  up a newspaper in a blog spot we got to spread this information anybody who tells us that we need
[1:01:22.040 --> 1:01:28.360]  to stand down or this is of the lord is ridiculous we need to stand up get off our horses and get
[1:01:28.360 --> 1:01:35.400]  going but uh i was thinking about showing your uh your new film the obama deception in a public
[1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:43.080]  forum and a player radio show also my parents sports bar restaurant what i know how how good of
[1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:48.280]  a business idea you think that would be with the spreading of this liberty movement and how hot it
[1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:57.160]  is with everybody what a business idea of selling the obama deception uh no uh airing your radio
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:02.840]  show during business hours um catching on with this liberty movement how many people are waking
[1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:08.760]  up to what's going on here yeah i think the way to do it is it first do it the way the global
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:14.520]  is to it phase it in have it on a smaller radio at one corner i don't know how big your facility is
[1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:19.960]  and have people start getting into it and listening so they're not overall assaulted by it and then
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:26.280]  as people start liking it then in a month or so uh you could you know have it on a few hours a day
[1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:33.160]  and then start putting it on most of the time all over the uh restaurant and and and then if somebody
[1:02:33.160 --> 1:02:37.000]  doesn't like it sometimes say hey sure what do you want to hear and just flip it to something else
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:41.480]  and not make a big issue out of it and then i would have a big stack of obama deception dvds
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:47.400]  which are in and shipping out right now is you know obama's hot period and people will buy these
[1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:54.120]  and that's also something that's a good business decision excellent excellent um also uh i tried

[1:09:57.560 --> 1:10:03.640]  report uh that was done by a reporter uh and we're trying to get this reporter on by the way
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:06.840]  the next few days we try to get him on today but they haven't contacted us back yet conversation
[1:10:06.840 --> 1:10:11.960]  with sergeant joe clark at mayak and we called and checked joe clark is one of the spokesman at
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:18.440]  mayak in missouri we've also talked to two other captains enlisted their names we they didn't want
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:23.720]  us to record the conversation with them so we didn't uh but that's on record this mayak report is
[1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:29.400]  real some people are still in denial about it but this is joe clark a sergeant joe clark at mayak
[1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:35.400]  says oh it doesn't mention you know bumper stickers in there with ron paul well yes it
[1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:40.040]  does it does mention bumper stickers and we have the report and the video up there is conversation
[1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:47.000]  with sergeant joe clark of mayak we are not terrorist that's the headline um the folks
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:52.920]  that made this video did a great job because they blew up the document and and you know
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:59.640]  showed hyperlinks and and and arrows to where it does say bumper stickers and the whole thing is
[1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:03.960]  about who wants to kill cops the whole thing's there to scare police and say oh my gosh these
[1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:08.280]  libertarians these bob bar supporters these ron paul people people to talk about north american union
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:12.760]  they're dangerous they're tied into white supremacists that want to kill you uh so i thought i would
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:18.120]  get state representative jim guest of missouri on with us for a little while he introduced the
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:23.080]  legislation we've got an update on that to redeclare ninth and tenth amendment he spoke out against
[1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:27.240]  the north american union and the globalist here on this show which is publicly being put all over
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:32.040]  the news now and so i wanted to get his response to the mayak report we called his office and he
[1:11:32.040 --> 1:11:38.120]  said that he was aware of the mayak report uh there in his state so we're representative jim
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:43.640]  guest thanks for coming back on with us uh thank you alex and i thank you for helping uh spread
[1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:50.120]  the word and exposes the gosh another intrusion into our freedom and our personal privacy that we
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:56.120]  think we've that we have but every day it seems like there's a an attack on it well this is outrageous
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:00.840]  uh when you tell us when you first learned of this federally written and prepared but issued by
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:07.000]  the governor's office and the state police report in your state that was last thursday we were last
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.920]  day of session before we took our spring break here just before when the session and when i got a
[1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:17.400]  quick couple emails that uh sort of brought it up but the report was rather hazy and honestly
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:22.280]  i was very skeptical but i thought surely they haven't gone this far and we were busy that day
[1:12:22.280 --> 1:12:26.040]  and probably about the middle of the afternoon when i got back my staff had contacted a couple
[1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:31.720]  public information officers over at mayak and i talked to them and they confirmed that it is
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:37.800]  authentic and anybody out there that disputes this i guarantee it is authentic it's the real thing
[1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:43.320]  and i would have to say when i was talking to them they were giving the canned public information
[1:12:43.320 --> 1:12:48.040]  response but you could kind of tell with the tone of their voice that they actually didn't believe it
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:53.720]  that they had gone too far i am setting up a meeting i'm gonna get back to capo next week
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:59.960]  with uh i'm not sure whether i get a i'm gonna get a meeting with fan gossy the director hopefully
[1:12:59.960 --> 1:13:05.960]  with doug mentalton he's a cia that's criminal intelligence analyst to sit down in my office
[1:13:05.960 --> 1:13:11.960]  and we're going to have a uh get down to your feeding here and i think we certainly demand
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:18.040]  an apology they need to come out and explain where they are on it if they want to include all of us
[1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:24.120]  in there and you know i'm sure that i'm one of not mentioned but i've got my uh my committee
[1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:28.520]  for america's freedom which outlines all these things which kind of oppose some of the things
[1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:32.680]  our federal government i've got lori it's legislation against real idea it's a nationwide
[1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:42.440]  coalition to stop the real id and you know those that all tie into the rfid capsule so it all ties
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:49.480]  together there it's outrageous they say that there are a lot of peaceful groups that help police and
[1:13:49.480 --> 1:13:54.760]  have soup kitchens but they're really secret and dangerous too and there's groups that don't like
[1:13:54.760 --> 1:14:01.160]  the rfid and there's those that don't like gun control and there's those that like the libertarians
[1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:05.960]  and ron paul and then they sandwich it in between groups that want to kill police i mean this is
[1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:12.040]  clear guilt by association absolutely he says well it's not all inclusive i think when you put
[1:14:12.040 --> 1:14:16.840]  something this broad and i was one of the first ones i think to introduce uh ron paul and he kicked
[1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:22.200]  off his presidential campaign about two years ago in kansas city and then a couple weeks later
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:27.640]  i helped introduce him in the Des Moines and i spent a couple days traveling with him and i
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:34.360]  worked on his campaign and i was in uh worson dc and one of those who spoke there at the camp
[1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:40.520]  the uh freedom march out there so uh i'm sure that i'm one that uh they include in there but
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:46.680]  you know who what better patriot do you have somebody like ron paul to start with who always
[1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:53.000]  votes according to the constitution and believes in protecting america chuck baldwin is following
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:59.560]  in his steps and you got bob bar who is that the libertarian party you know these are not the
[1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:06.120]  militant people out there they are peaceful people people that want to see what's right
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:09.800]  you know they keep talking about this tenth amendment that we want to overthrow the government
[1:15:09.800 --> 1:15:15.400]  all we want to do is get back to govern the way the constitution says that's what it says not to
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:19.720]  throw the government out we want them to just abide with the rules that's right the states
[1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:24.280]  created the federal government the states control it and that's in the declaration of
[1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:28.840]  independence it's in the constitution it's in the bill of rights and anyone that claims
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:35.800]  that that is a lie is lying you bet and you know they uh talk about these bumper stickers i guarantee
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:41.960]  it and when you they pull somebody over it says in the fed or stop the irs or listen to alex
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:45.720]  ron's who knows what kind of bumper stickers up there they're going to include those people in
[1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:51.240]  there as being uh people to be watched before but they list i mean they list ron paul bob bar
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:55.720]  and others and list bumper stickers and there's actually youtube videos people have shot out
[1:15:55.720 --> 1:16:00.920]  of their cars in los vegas and other places where the police do pull them over for ron paul stickers
[1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:07.160]  so there have been people who've had their houses busted into for ron paul signs uh or for upside
[1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:11.240]  down flags which is not a disrespect it's even if it was it's free speech but it's a sign of
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:18.200]  distress so we have seen persecution against ron paul supporters it is and uh you know just because
[1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:23.960]  he uh has a movement going he's got his campaign for liberty now and uh where they i guess they
[1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:28.920]  obviously consider that a oh no they list that they list that they list that as you know i know
[1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:35.480]  and uh you know these are people who obviously we need more of what gets me when they take sovereign
[1:16:35.480 --> 1:16:41.320]  citizens you know that's what i'm working for here sovereign citizens and a sovereign government
[1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:47.640]  sovereign state that's what it's all about then try and demonize this and put us in that category
[1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:53.800]  that is just it's outrageous what they're well why why do you think they were trying to keep it
[1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:59.560]  secret i mean clearly they're embarrassed of what they're doing this is dirty dark propaganda
[1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:04.680]  uh it's lies and guilt by association so that's why they try to keep this so secret but i don't
[1:17:04.680 --> 1:17:09.400]  want you to feel bad just for your fine state the show me state missouri uh we have gotten these
[1:17:09.400 --> 1:17:15.720]  reports in different variants different forms different permutations from all 50 states yeah
[1:17:15.720 --> 1:17:21.960]  luckily we got somebody here who uh realized the danger that this was but you know on the back page
[1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:28.680]  of this you know it says unclassified law enforcement sensitive and it says all information
[1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:35.880]  considered in this newsletter should be considered law enforcement sensitive no report or segment
[1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:43.400]  thereof may be released to any media sources hmm why would that be the information here in may not
[1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:53.960]  be max m is a originated intelligence unless written noted so um they've uh they've got caught here
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:59.880]  and uh i hopefully i'll do the right thing and come out there and make a public apology
[1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:05.720]  but then uh you know i'm sure that this came from a higher level down when you start looking at
[1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:10.360]  everything is delineated in there you know this wasn't something that just originated to state level
[1:18:10.360 --> 1:18:16.280]  i think they can go back several years and see some similar uh propaganda or that was uh back
[1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:21.240]  i think even during the Clinton administration now the FBI know i mean we know this was put into my
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:26.680]  act uh via the threat integration center with the feds the feds wrote this southern property
[1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:32.040]  law center wrote this ad l wrote this i've seen the paragraph by paragraph in articles they've
[1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:39.080]  written uh so so this is just federally disseminated through your state i think people need to realize
[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:45.080]  i'm sure most of them do listen to your program alex on 9 11 president george bush said an attack
[1:18:45.080 --> 1:18:51.720]  on one is an attack on all my words in other words an attack on one's freedom is going to be
[1:18:51.720 --> 1:18:56.680]  attacked on everybody's freedoms whether you're included as part of the ron paul moving or the
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:02.520]  constitution party or not when you allow if you stand back and allow somebody else's freedom
[1:19:02.520 --> 1:19:08.840]  to take away you're going to be next in line absolutely sir we're going to break and i want
[1:19:08.840 --> 1:19:13.240]  to come back for one more quick segment with you and specifically talk about uh how you're
[1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:18.200]  trying to get the director of your state police or the director of the mayak program in your office
[1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:21.480]  but but they are saying that one of them will be coming to your office next week
[1:19:23.400 --> 1:19:28.440]  down with the meeting with me when i left last week there so they're saying they will be coming
[1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:33.240]  to have a meeting with you that's what they said then we'll see uh since in the meantime of course
[1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:38.600]  this is right after broke and they may not have uh realized the full repercussions of what was
[1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:44.600]  happening and certainly we've been putting out a public statement on it and if not we'll continue
[1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:51.160]  to hit the media with it all right representative at jim guest of missouri you heard him there at

[1:24:54.440 --> 1:24:59.000]  jim guest out of missouri confirming again from another source we've called them ourselves that
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:04.440]  yes the feds gave them this report they put it out the state demonizing basically the only people
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:10.200]  fighting the takeover by the foreign banks of the united states representative in the last few
[1:25:10.200 --> 1:25:15.320]  weeks i mean it was dozens of articles a day now it's hundreds of articles a day the mainstream
[1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:21.720]  news saying world government's real but it's good and the banks will issue the global currency you
[1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:26.600]  will pay taxes to them and then meanwhile the police everywhere being taught we're insane and
[1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:31.960]  terrorist if we believe in it or fight it i mean this is a classic takeover here where they're
[1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:36.040]  teaching the enforcers who should be the defenders of the bill of rights and constitution who swore
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:44.200]  oaths to it that it's bad i mean this is insane it is i just uh you know the real scary parties
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:50.440]  here they're trying to indoctrinate the police into thinking that those who support the constitution
[1:25:50.440 --> 1:25:55.400]  party libertarian are the enemy and actually if you look down through this here a lot of this
[1:25:55.400 --> 1:25:59.960]  stuff pretty well mirrors the platform of the republican party enforcement of the second
[1:25:59.960 --> 1:26:06.680]  amendment to pro-life and some other things out there and my committee for america's freedom you
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:13.960]  know i oppose the real id act the national animal and i my second one is to stop this north american
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:20.600]  union that's right in line with it i say this repeal revise the patriot act so many of my issues
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:27.720]  that i and others are working for they would put in this category here so i think it's very important
[1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:35.240]  for people realize just because they've uh pointed at the constitution the libertarian party and chuck
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:41.400]  baldman those that's not who all they're after they just happen to be the figurehead hero they're
[1:26:41.400 --> 1:26:48.200]  pointing at so just because you don't think you're included in this right now well the next go around
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:53.720]  the next round that you will be well let's just go down the line here in most polls 65 percent or
[1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:58.520]  more of americans are now against abortion in most polls upwards of 70 percent of americans are pro
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:04.600]  second amendment in most polls 91 percent in gallup polar against open borders it lists those people
[1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:11.160]  is basically terrorist it lists what not just what is constitutional and then our bill of rights
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:17.640]  but our american way of life is evil but it also lists basically all americans is bad because what's
[1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:22.840]  constitutional is also always very popular because the constitution is a beautiful document
[1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:27.720]  compared to what we have today in closing how is the resolution to declare tenth amendment
[1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:33.640]  state sovereignty going in Missouri it's going well it'll be up for a vote on the house floor
[1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:39.160]  possibly next week we have to take up our budget so it's one of the those issues that the body has
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:46.360]  been alerted to prepare for so i think we've got solid support for and hopefully we'll get that
[1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:50.680]  through but in the session there so hopefully we can join the other states that have got that
[1:27:50.680 --> 1:27:57.080]  pastry so it's i think it sends a strong message that we do want to get back to the basic uh
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:28:03.160]  philosophy of this country that the we have states rights and individual rights and that the fact
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:08.280]  that the federal government has overstepped its bounds we got to get back to what our forefathers
[1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:14.360]  envisioned and set up in the constitution absolutely i know there's always a rush of
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:18.840]  bills and that's the toughest part uh you believe you have the votes but the question is can you
[1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:22.680]  get into the floor uh would you say you're 80 percent certain it's going to pass or should
[1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:28.920]  people call their representatives i'm 80 percent certain it'll pass the house and floor there and
[1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:35.000]  i've got a senator over there that's very strongly very strong supportive of it to uh help carry it
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:40.040]  through the senate so even though we do get busy here towards the end while we're in session longer
[1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:45.320]  but i just that between that i've got a very strong bill to support the second amendment that we
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:51.080]  missouri will not register together you can defend ourselves in any manner in fact here in missouri
[1:28:51.080 --> 1:28:57.160]  it also expands the castle dock which says that you can protect yourself any place on your own
[1:28:57.160 --> 1:29:02.840]  property don't have to retreat to your house for you representative jim guest enclosing uh were
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:09.160]  other members of the legislature they're outraged by the myack report they were it's a matter of
[1:29:09.160 --> 1:29:13.960]  most of them i probably hadn't even heard of it so like i said that was the last day we went out of
[1:29:13.960 --> 1:29:20.520]  session and i know many of them have received emails from supporters of my legislation so they'll

[1:39:25.640 --> 1:39:33.960]  it mike in georgia you're on the air go ahead mike good afternoon mr jones hi uh this morning on
[1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:41.080]  the uh washington journal on c span the last guest that they had on there was a uh writer from the
[1:39:41.080 --> 1:39:49.880]  politico and i got my call in at that time and uh he was invited on to speak to speak to the uh
[1:39:49.880 --> 1:39:57.640]  bailout of aig and i referenced back to the uh other article in politico the uh builder bergs
[1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:06.200]  excite conspiracist and then was able to uh mention that they got quoted you uh the producer
[1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:12.680]  of the obama deception and that they used information from both your websites and was able to uh
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:19.640]  uh name them on there the job and specifically uh that the part of the reference was to the
[1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:25.800]  builder berg group and the trilateral commission and the cfr and how did this gentleman feel
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:31.640]  that it impacted on the uh planning and the implementation of the new world order isn't
[1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:38.680]  so far as the banking problem and uh i was also able to suggest that they invite either yourself
[1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:46.920]  or mr reviro or mr rince on and interview them and what are they saying uh they the last part
[1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:51.240]  they just said they would consider it it's not that i have suggested that before too you know and
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:57.560]  they always say well we'll we'll take it under advisement or whatever and but when the uh gentleman
[1:40:57.560 --> 1:41:05.080]  the uh writer uh mr jabbers uh he knew who had written the article but he said he hadn't read
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:11.000]  the article so he couldn't really comment on it and he didn't you know he really didn't tie any
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:15.640]  anything that i have mentioned back in hey no matter you got a lot of info out from what you
[1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:21.560]  just said well and i was going to kind of suggest that maybe you know at one point before the election
[1:41:21.560 --> 1:41:27.080]  lots of people were calling in to the washington journal and ron paul was appearing on there
[1:41:28.040 --> 1:41:33.320]  and you know after they got their man and then basically it was always you know they were just
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:39.320]  to how how are we going to continue with our criminal activity but you know occasionally they
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:44.280]  let somebody on that's uh worth watching you know like i said i've seen well i'm paul on there
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:50.200]  was more than once and i thought maybe some of your audience might like to call in you know we
[1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:56.920]  have contacted c span probably i don't know 75 or more times saying hey we're having an event
[1:41:56.920 --> 1:42:01.720]  would you like to cover it live or tape it and they've done that one time for our 911 uh truth
[1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:06.360]  symposium they covered about an hour and 46 minutes of it uh they told me at an hour and a half that
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:12.760]  we went for an hour and 46 minutes in one particular panel and that's the extra on terror storm
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:18.600]  is part of that panel but you can see it there in that film on the dvd but also you can you know just
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:24.680]  911 truth symposium c span you can google that you can find the video up on the web on youtube and
[1:42:24.680 --> 1:42:30.360]  google but the other times they've just ignored us and then brian lamb and others will have people
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:36.120]  on there for hit pieces against me where they attack me at nauseam but that's fine people's
[1:42:36.120 --> 1:42:41.000]  have such mistrust for mainstream media and even c span which is one of the better ones out there
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:45.560]  they allow more diversity of ideas um that it's good when they attack me it's just as good because
[1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:50.760]  people know oh wait these are this is the corrupt establishment i better check out alex jones
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:57.320]  because the liars are saying that he's bad so that you know they have such little credibility
[1:42:57.320 --> 1:43:03.560]  they keep shoveling their their horsemen are at the public and it's not working anymore so i say
[1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:09.880]  continue the attacks intensify them it's wonderful please please come after me i love it i mean that
[1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:15.240]  that's the best well and i was able to mention a lot of things to an audience you know i can call
[1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:22.280]  into your show and preach you know to the choir but i named a number of things that an audience
[1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:28.280]  that might not be uh calling in you're looking at your show would now be aware of you know and
[1:43:28.280 --> 1:43:33.880]  identified you as an expert in the field no no i appreciate you and good to hear from you mike
[1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:39.880]  super job uh this is preaching to the choir overall i mean i would say 90 percent of our audience
[1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:44.680]  are folks that tune in every day or every few days but every day there's that 10 percent or more
[1:43:44.680 --> 1:43:49.880]  who are driving down the road listening i am fm or sent an audio clip or sent a link to the audio
[1:43:49.880 --> 1:43:54.520]  streams or tuning around on shortwave or tuning around on satellite are people that i've gone
[1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:59.320]  you know i go i did interviews almost every day i did one this morning doing a couple later today
[1:43:59.320 --> 1:44:03.480]  and i plugged the website and so people all the time him oh i'm a i'm a listener now i you know
[1:44:03.480 --> 1:44:08.520]  i heard you on this talk show uh and so uh that's so you're not just talking to the choir when you're
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:13.480]  on this show and people know that it's constantly expanding uh hunter in utah hunter you're on the
[1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:22.680]  air click okay ronnie in texas you're on the air ronnie thanks for holding rejoice alec hey
[1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:29.000]  here's a couple weird phrases thanks to congress mexico excuse me mexico leads the way to freedom
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:34.600]  and for all of us and it's true because you know yesterday morning mexico announced new tariffs
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:41.240]  against the u.s. in retaliation to the congress of the u.s. that congress as you know um that's
[1:44:41.240 --> 1:44:46.280]  right congress won't open the borders up to mexico that's collapsing they're only partially open to
[1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:51.400]  30 million and so mexico says they're going to break with nafta and gat and things are now unraveling
[1:44:51.400 --> 1:44:55.560]  see the globalists have made a major gamble to bring in their new world order and i think it's
[1:44:55.560 --> 1:45:00.760]  going to explode in their face look they failed with the south american union uh three years ago
[1:45:00.760 --> 1:45:04.920]  they finally let the french vote and they said we don't want to expand the e u they finally let the
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:09.480]  irish vote they said we don't want to be part of the e u globalism is in retreat everywhere
[1:45:09.480 --> 1:45:13.160]  that's why the new world order is staging terror attacks trying to launch new wars
[1:45:13.160 --> 1:45:17.240]  and causing the world financial crisis to bankrupt everybody where we've got to go hat
[1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:21.560]  in hand to the very bankers that make all the money out of fiat with a stroke of a pin
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:26.040]  instead we say no we don't go hat in hand to you we arrest you for all the crimes you've committed
[1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:29.880]  you're right now i mean that i think it's great that that uh mexico
[1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:37.160]  denies us or is angry about us denying access because it violates nafta which is great well
[1:45:37.160 --> 1:45:43.000]  under the north american union agreements that is exactly what's going on and the most important
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:48.600]  provision of nafta allows for the u.s mexico or canada too at any time unilaterally withdraw
[1:45:48.600 --> 1:45:54.120]  from the treaty and here it is people now i believe we have the ways means and and motivation
[1:45:54.120 --> 1:45:59.560]  obvious motivation to unilaterally withdraw from nafta the public demand is well i mean you've
[1:45:59.560 --> 1:46:05.480]  got polls of 90 plus percent against what was 90 plus percent against it when they passed it back
[1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:11.800]  in 94 but absolutely the people wanted to destroy our economy and nafta and got which was the major
[1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:16.440]  stepping stone of the north american union good to hear from you excellent points uh let's talk
[1:46:16.440 --> 1:46:22.840]  to james and pennsylvania james you're on the air hi alex i have a question for you i'm a senior
[1:46:22.840 --> 1:46:27.400]  in high school right now and i've been accepted at pittsburgh university and they're the honors
[1:46:27.400 --> 1:46:32.040]  colleges i'm pretty proud about but i really don't know if i should go if that's going to be good
[1:46:32.040 --> 1:46:37.000]  in the next two or three years but even be able to finish my degree what's your thoughts on that
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:41.880]  and how colleges will play out in the next couple years i mean specifically you're asking if you
[1:46:41.880 --> 1:46:46.440]  should stay in college you're asking what i think is going to happen um well i'm not a college yet
[1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:51.240]  i'm just a senior in high school i'm saying well how will college is doing in this financial time
[1:46:52.120 --> 1:46:57.560]  and if things go to hell pardon my french will i even be able to finish my degree do you think
[1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:01.880]  well what's going to happen is in four or five years or even sooner they're going to be forced to
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:08.600]  in this bubble you know where they're charging 30 40 50 000 a year to go to mediocre colleges
[1:47:09.160 --> 1:47:13.720]  and the fact is that uh the degree you're going to get for a long time you're not going to probably
[1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:19.320]  be able to even get a job that will even come close to being able to pay off the debts associated
[1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:23.880]  with that and people are doing the math and figuring this out uh i personally was going to
[1:47:23.880 --> 1:47:31.560]  college but i started my access tv show and i was a sophomore in college uh and boom i had a radio
[1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:36.200]  job a few months later and so i just quit college because i didn't have time to continue what i was
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:41.480]  doing starting to make films and uh you know doing a radio show and doing a local tv show so i
[1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:47.080]  took the opportunity there are certainly opportunities within the college system especially
[1:47:47.080 --> 1:47:54.120]  for engineers or medical workers or nurses or you know things like that but the fine arts degrees a
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:48:00.600]  lot of those i mean i've seen the studies there's really not not much of a future to make any real
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:06.680]  you know money that could even come close to paying off your debts i mean uh but the good news is
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:11.080]  because the economy is coming back to reality the colleges are going to be forced and it's already
[1:48:11.080 --> 1:48:17.560]  happening to lower two issues uh and so that's uh in a process right now but you know that's a very
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:24.040]  complex question that's a decision you've got to make for yourself but uh you know i'll tell you
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:29.560]  this sir i mean if you just want to make money uh even in this bad economy uh you know going and
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:33.800]  getting a truck and lawn mowers and hiring a crew and going out and mowing yards every day or
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:41.640]  doing landscaping or uh you know starting hot dog stands uh i mean there look bill gates quit
[1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:47.480]  college rush limbaugh didn't go to college most and then and they've done studies on this most
[1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:53.720]  really successful executives and most really except successful entrepreneurs didn't go to
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:58.360]  college or quit college because they were go getters they were already successful before
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:03.560]  they went to the college process college is kind of a place to warehouse uh people for four to eight
[1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:09.080]  more years so they don't go into the workforce workforce and saddle them with debt uh and you
[1:49:09.080 --> 1:49:13.960]  know that's an over generality and i'm not attacking college itself uh it's just that um
[1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:21.160]  i'm i mean it depends on what you want to do in life what what professions are you alert by
[1:49:22.520 --> 1:49:27.000]  uh well i was accepted for astrophysics and that's all well and good to me but
[1:49:27.800 --> 1:49:31.640]  uh it seems to me that they've covered up the real science what was like tacky on field and
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:38.760]  everything that i'm finding on the internet and you were so you were accepted for for the physics
[1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:46.520]  of space travel and stuff like that yeah uh well i mean if you're extremely gifted in that area
[1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:50.920]  the the probably be university and research jobs i mean you want to work with the government about
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:56.360]  90 percent of most of that type of research is black op budget secret programs or you'll be
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:50:01.800]  doing research to then give it to the globalist uh but no i'm that's where college really is
[1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:08.680]  needed is in the real scientific fields in biology you know uh in uh electrical engineering
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:14.280]  structural engineering uh you know mathematics and things like that uh so i think college would
[1:50:14.280 --> 1:50:21.800]  probably be good for you and you're going to need that uh in that uh you know genre uh of uh work
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:29.080]  uh if you're so so for folks in the scientific field college is a must pretty much okay great
[1:50:29.080 --> 1:50:33.080]  and well i mean i've never listened to you and jason and what i really like to do is just you
[1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:37.880]  know then uh and tell people about this stuff maybe i can have a radio station at the college
[1:50:37.880 --> 1:50:43.320]  or something like that who knows absolutely you know have your major be science and your minor
[1:50:43.320 --> 1:50:49.640]  be rtf and uh you know whatever and then separately while you're going to school start your own blog
[1:50:49.640 --> 1:50:54.040]  start your own internet radio show don't wait you know do do do lots of things

[1:55:00.200 --> 1:55:06.200]  yes sir alex is a great pleasure and an honor to be with you um uh let's see here i had a couple
[1:55:06.200 --> 1:55:11.240]  quick questions one of the members of our group that we organize here is we're talking about peter
[1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:18.280]  schiff and the schiff family being uh funders of the bolshevik revolution or one of the funders
[1:55:18.280 --> 1:55:23.240]  so i mean yeah there's probably tens of thousands of shifts in the united states that's like saying
[1:55:23.880 --> 1:55:29.480]  am i related to john paul jones i don't believe i am the first navy um first navy admiral in the
[1:55:29.480 --> 1:55:35.480]  in the in the revolutionary war or am i related to uh jim jones the answer is no but am i guilty
[1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:40.680]  because of something jim jones has done somewhere back in wales uh did i have somebody related to
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:44.920]  jim jones probably you know 50th cousins or 100th cousins i don't know i'm probably related to john
[1:55:44.920 --> 1:55:51.240]  paul jones as well i'm probably related you know to the james jones the you know one of the heads
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:57.080]  of homeland security setting up the police state of the national security council but no uh everyone
[1:55:57.080 --> 1:56:02.280]  shifts the father of peter schiff is in prison for exposing the private federal reserve so
[1:56:02.280 --> 1:56:05.640]  you know there's just a lot of anybody who's prominent fighting the new world order gets
[1:56:05.640 --> 1:56:10.920]  attacked by the government and the media but they also get attacked just by crazies that are jealous
[1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:15.160]  of anybody who has any success on the internet and they just make up new things constantly
[1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:19.800]  yeah that's enough right thought i mean as far as my own research goes i mean everything peter's
[1:56:19.800 --> 1:56:24.040]  ever said it seems pretty consistent well i mean look i mean look he's giving financial news take
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:29.800]  it or leave it he's just another person out there talking and i mean it's all this obsession
[1:56:29.800 --> 1:56:33.480]  about who's talking about the new world order they're openly setting up world government it's
[1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:38.360]  all over the newspapers and most of our movement spends their time just attacking everybody else
[1:56:38.360 --> 1:56:42.520]  and it's it's it's jealousy it's envy i'd love to say they were government agents they're not
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:47.560]  government agents i appreciate your call i mean that's not what this show is about is is this guy
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:53.480]  good or is that guy good or is this lady good we're just here covering the news and information
[1:56:53.480 --> 1:56:58.120]  you know i told you last week that they had marines army excuse me out running around with
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:57:02.280]  checkpoints after the alabama shooting and we called up and had the colonel on who was there
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:09.240]  and he admitted they were now it's in the houston chronicle uh army reviews troop use at fatal alabama
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:15.160]  shootings here c and s news army investigating how and why troops were sent into alabama town
[1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:19.640]  after murder spree and they have the army here saying it it looks like it's illegal what they
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:23.320]  did carrying out law enforcement activities the colonel said it wasn't law enforcement activities
[1:57:23.320 --> 1:57:30.200]  but it clearly was control and cordon and running running checkpoints running roadblocks uh you know
[1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:35.160]  the military is trying to get rid of posse common taught us right now but uh it's kind of interesting
[1:57:35.160 --> 1:57:38.840]  that they've announced they're going to put 20 000 regular troops on the streets but now they're
[1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:43.560]  saying these guys may be in trouble it looks like they're in trouble because they exceeded their orders
[1:57:43.560 --> 1:57:47.560]  and we're out here doing this on their own and i don't think they should get in trouble for this
[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:51.320]  they just they need to you know say they're not going to do it again because they've been told
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:56.280]  by the brass we're going to start policing america that's been in the news been in the army times
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:58:02.280]  and so then there's a shooting they try to show up to help thinking this is their orders and now
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:07.320]  they may get in trouble uh you know it's it's because the illusion of that order has been given
[1:58:08.280 --> 1:58:12.520]  and you know they see troops at the super bowl and troops on the tv in new york so they think
[1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:17.160]  this is normal now they're learning their lesson this is a federal crime this is a violation of
[1:58:17.160 --> 1:58:26.280]  federal law i appreciate um everybody's call we've got to go to break here and start the
[1:58:26.920 --> 1:58:32.520]  next hour already into the third hour today simulcasting at prison planet dot tv when we come

[2:03:57.520 --> 2:04:01.960]  all of just how hundreds of mainstream news articles all week are saying there
[2:04:01.960 --> 2:04:05.320]  is a new world order global government will be run by the very banks that are
[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:06.880]  collapsing society
[2:04:06.880 --> 2:04:08.400]  by design we will pay
[2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:10.080]  carbon taxes to them
[2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:13.720]  here is a time magazine headline new world order and they say a new bank of the
[2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:14.440]  world
[2:04:14.440 --> 2:04:19.160]  will rule the united states uh... here is uh... the financial times of london and
[2:04:19.160 --> 2:04:22.600]  now for a world government is the headline they're openly announcing that
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:24.320]  the banks will rule the planet
[2:04:24.320 --> 2:04:26.920]  will pay our carbon taxes to them for the phony
[2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:28.560]  global warming and
[2:04:28.560 --> 2:04:32.440]  but it's not a state rep on confirming the modern militia movement document
[2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:36.320]  my act saying ron paul supporters libertarians anybody with a ron paul
[2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:37.280]  bumper sticker
[2:04:37.280 --> 2:04:41.360]  are dangerous terrorist that the north american union doesn't exist
[2:04:41.360 --> 2:04:45.400]  uh... that anybody that uh... talks about freedom or liberty issues is
[2:04:45.400 --> 2:04:49.200]  basically an evil terror so so we're exposing the new world order here judge
[2:04:49.200 --> 2:04:54.520]  well i i i appreciate what you're going to run for you just mention will be on
[2:04:54.520 --> 2:04:57.200]  freedom watch with me in about uh... twenty minutes
[2:04:57.200 --> 2:05:00.720]  i'm not telling you that there was a time when the types of things that you
[2:05:00.720 --> 2:05:02.400]  are warning against
[2:05:02.400 --> 2:05:05.360]  was not discussed openly and publicly
[2:05:05.360 --> 2:05:06.240]  but i was
[2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:09.760]  scandalized when uh... british prime minister gordon brown
[2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:11.400]  tipped his hand
[2:05:11.400 --> 2:05:14.720]  when he spoke to a joint session of congress two weeks ago
[2:05:14.720 --> 2:05:16.640]  and said he was looking for
[2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:19.760]  these are the words that caused me a couple of sleepless nights alex and i
[2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:21.320]  bet you as well
[2:05:21.320 --> 2:05:24.080]  and many of the folks watching and listening to us
[2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:26.800]  a global new deal
[2:05:26.800 --> 2:05:30.520]  now what under the sun is a global new deal
[2:05:30.520 --> 2:05:34.760]  unless it consists of the type of thing that you have just warned against
[2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:36.480]  which american taxpayers
[2:05:36.480 --> 2:05:40.280]  will be enriching bank some banks will be deciding what we can pay but it will
[2:05:40.280 --> 2:05:41.480]  be happening
[2:05:41.480 --> 2:05:44.360]  irrespective of the boundaries
[2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:46.240]  of the united states of america
[2:05:46.240 --> 2:05:48.080]  and other countries as well
[2:05:48.080 --> 2:05:51.880]  absolutely here is yesterday's london telegraph i m s
[2:05:51.880 --> 2:05:55.160]  poised to print billions of dollars in global
[2:05:55.160 --> 2:05:56.980]  uh... easing and it says
[2:05:56.980 --> 2:06:01.040]  that the international monetary fund will create a new global super
[2:06:01.040 --> 2:06:02.160]  currency
[2:06:02.160 --> 2:06:06.600]  that will replace the dollar and that americans will pay tax money in
[2:06:06.600 --> 2:06:09.240]  to fund the world government so
[2:06:09.240 --> 2:06:10.480]  this is all
[2:06:10.480 --> 2:06:11.600]  out in the open
[2:06:11.600 --> 2:06:15.040]  that's why uh... on our news guide will never say what the plan is what are you
[2:06:15.040 --> 2:06:16.400]  gonna do how you gonna fix it
[2:06:16.400 --> 2:06:19.120]  but when the g twenty meet when they had the breton woods meeting the new one
[2:06:19.120 --> 2:06:20.480]  coming up in a few days
[2:06:20.480 --> 2:06:25.440]  they admit they're setting up a world government run by private banks what the
[2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:26.640]  trilateral commission
[2:06:26.640 --> 2:06:28.800]  said back in the seventies listen i never
[2:06:28.800 --> 2:06:31.560]  you discovered any of this this was never my opinion
[2:06:31.560 --> 2:06:33.680]  and people saying how are you right about all this how do you know this
[2:06:33.680 --> 2:06:34.960]  fourteen years ago
[2:06:34.960 --> 2:06:38.280]  i was reading i m f world bank united nations
[2:06:38.280 --> 2:06:42.080]  uh... ran corporation council on foreign relations documents where they
[2:06:42.080 --> 2:06:43.160]  said
[2:06:43.160 --> 2:06:46.960]  and the s p p documents the judicial watch suit and got a few years ago they
[2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:51.200]  were going to use a financial meltdown to bring in the north american union
[2:06:51.200 --> 2:06:55.360]  the new transatlantic agreement to merge that with the european union we are
[2:06:55.360 --> 2:06:59.320]  already deep into this merger and it's all over the foreign press
[2:06:59.320 --> 2:07:02.840]  let me raise your blood pressure a little bit more out because this also what
[2:07:02.840 --> 2:07:06.200]  i'm now about to discuss with you raised my blood pressure
[2:07:06.200 --> 2:07:08.760]  uh... secretary of state hillary clinton
[2:07:08.760 --> 2:07:11.600]  visited her counterpart in b g
[2:07:11.600 --> 2:07:14.960]  about eight or nine days ago and i don't know who else she thought but we saw
[2:07:14.960 --> 2:07:16.200]  pictures of her
[2:07:16.200 --> 2:07:21.200]  with the chinese foreign minister about four days after that at the g twenty
[2:07:21.200 --> 2:07:23.320]  summit to which you just referred
[2:07:23.320 --> 2:07:28.200]  a meeting of the finance ministers of the twenty largest country united in the
[2:07:28.200 --> 2:07:29.600]  country in the world
[2:07:29.600 --> 2:07:33.080]  which control collectively about eighty five percent of the economy
[2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:34.980]  for some reason the chinese
[2:07:34.980 --> 2:07:36.280]  premier was there
[2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:38.160]  he was the only head of state there
[2:07:38.160 --> 2:07:40.760]  other than gordon brown as as the host
[2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:44.080]  and the chinese premier before the g twenty started
[2:07:44.080 --> 2:07:47.720]  gave an interview to the uh... one of the international
[2:07:47.720 --> 2:07:49.240]  appraise and said
[2:07:49.240 --> 2:07:51.120]  seriously worry
[2:07:51.120 --> 2:07:55.560]  about whether the united states will be able to meet its obligation yes
[2:07:55.560 --> 2:07:58.560]  calculated that the chinese government itself
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:02.480]  or government-supported enterprises supported by the chinese
[2:08:02.480 --> 2:08:03.600]  uh... government
[2:08:03.600 --> 2:08:09.160]  has uh... purchased in excess of one trillion dollars in american security
[2:08:09.160 --> 2:08:11.080]  what do you think hillary said to him
[2:08:11.080 --> 2:08:14.440]  you think she toned down what he said it was going to be worse
[2:08:14.440 --> 2:08:15.860]  before she got there
[2:08:15.860 --> 2:08:18.980]  or do you think she caused it to say that in the first place
[2:08:18.980 --> 2:08:21.600]  but whatever she whispered into his ear and bg
[2:08:21.600 --> 2:08:24.520]  well we know in separate meetings he's had with the chinese leadership in
[2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:27.720]  several trips in europe and in china she said please
[2:08:27.720 --> 2:08:31.280]  keep buying the dollar please keep buying our debt
[2:08:31.280 --> 2:08:35.560]  just long enough for us to set up this new global monetary system the russians
[2:08:35.560 --> 2:08:38.080]  are calling for a new global currency
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:42.800]  the only thing the u.s. has left is its fiat dollar the globalist of the based
[2:08:42.800 --> 2:08:47.520]  our nation they've made us a better nation they destroyed our uh... capacity
[2:08:47.520 --> 2:08:48.680]  to manufacture
[2:08:48.680 --> 2:08:50.040]  and so the globalist
[2:08:50.040 --> 2:08:53.680]  are creating a global fire sale they're destroying the world economy in their
[2:08:53.680 --> 2:08:58.520]  own documents so that then they'll be the only lender to the planet and they'll
[2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:03.400]  create more fiat currency backed by u.s. and european taxpayers to then fund
[2:09:03.400 --> 2:09:06.980]  setting up their world government so absolutely the chinese have been bad
[2:09:06.980 --> 2:09:08.280]  mounting the u.s.
[2:09:08.280 --> 2:09:11.680]  that they've been bad-mouthing uh... the country uh... that that they own over
[2:09:11.680 --> 2:09:12.680]  trillion dollars
[2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:16.520]  of our t-bills and uh... this is the birth of the new world order and so you've
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:18.120]  got all these different hanchos
[2:09:18.120 --> 2:09:21.120]  from the private central banks the private federal reserve and others all
[2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:24.240]  meeting deciding on the final architecture
[2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:27.120]  of the world government the very banks that have engineered
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:30.680]  the economic collapse are now posing as our saviors
[2:09:30.680 --> 2:09:33.360]  bring this in but the good news is
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:36.360]  i've never seen an awakening this big and i'm seeing you know people like
[2:09:36.360 --> 2:09:39.440]  when back talk about the new world order on fox i'm seeing you talk about it for
[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:40.200]  years
[2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:41.680]  before him i was seeing
[2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:43.600]  blue doves talk about it we're seeing
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:46.980]  uh... you know mainline talk show host limbaugh's even talking about global
[2:09:46.980 --> 2:09:49.600]  government now michael savages talking about
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:54.080]  uh... how he thinks you obama may stage crises to bring in marshal law so all
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:56.880]  the things that i was talking about in the wilderness ten
[2:09:56.880 --> 2:09:58.600]  plus years ago is now
[2:09:58.600 --> 2:10:00.640]  hitting main stream
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:03.440]  and it is great so it shows me the sleeping giant
[2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:07.320]  that is the united states and all this liberty and freedom we're rediscovering
[2:10:07.320 --> 2:10:10.160]  our roots our declaration of independence our constitution
[2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:14.440]  you call for states to not succeed but you know redeclare their tenth amendment
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:17.280]  ninth amendment you're a judge you know the constitution well
[2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:20.760]  constitutional scholar and so they're trying to get the feds back in line the
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:24.760]  battle draw a lines are being drawn here and the american people are finding
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:28.360]  out that washington's been seized by offshore banks
[2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:32.080]  well uh... that this will make your blood boil a little bit more as we keep
[2:10:32.080 --> 2:10:35.520]  ratcheting this up and and and i thought that the summer you just gave a
[2:10:35.520 --> 2:10:36.440]  terrific
[2:10:36.440 --> 2:10:39.240]  adjust for those of us that are turning into a political panel
[2:10:39.240 --> 2:10:42.600]  simulcasting from freedom watch at box dot com
[2:10:42.600 --> 2:10:46.200]  with alex jones the great alex jones on the alex jones radio show
[2:10:46.200 --> 2:10:47.840]  we only have another minute or so
[2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:49.160]  i suspect
[2:10:49.160 --> 2:10:50.720]  that mrs clinton
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:54.360]  and the president will begin saying nice things about the chinese
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:56.220]  human rights record
[2:10:56.220 --> 2:10:59.520]  none of the are now they are and and and that's why we've made the obama
[2:10:59.520 --> 2:11:00.240]  deception
[2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:01.600]  but because if we
[2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:03.520]  there to criticize
[2:11:03.520 --> 2:11:06.160]  if we dare to use our first amendment right
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:09.600]  against one of the most oppressive giant from the world
[2:11:09.600 --> 2:11:13.020]  they might just stop voting up money alex
[2:11:13.020 --> 2:11:14.880]  what would we do that
[2:11:14.880 --> 2:11:17.680]  well things would basically collapse and that's what the globalist want we're
[2:11:17.680 --> 2:11:20.280]  all interconnected and control and that's what my new film
[2:11:20.280 --> 2:11:23.000]  the obama deception and info wars dot com
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:24.880]  covers is how this guy
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:29.300]  is controlled by the very banks that did the bailout geithner help write it
[2:11:29.300 --> 2:11:33.600]  he's claiming he's going after all the ceo's bonuses when they wrote a loophole
[2:11:33.600 --> 2:11:36.560]  in there where they're all exempt from
[2:11:36.560 --> 2:11:39.640]  uh... the other rules for other banks and insurance companies so there's one
[2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:43.440]  rule for the big global bankers another rule for the main street bankers this
[2:11:43.440 --> 2:11:46.520]  film doesn't just expose barack obama the obama deception

[2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:54.560]  uh... what his agenda
[2:11:54.560 --> 2:11:57.920]  uh... is for forced national service which they're now admitting what his
[2:11:57.920 --> 2:12:02.320]  agenda is to bankrupt this country and bring in total police state control but
[2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:05.160]  again the good news is the people are waking up by the way the obama

[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:08.920]  network
[2:15:08.920 --> 2:15:11.160]  has the audio of this
[2:15:11.160 --> 2:15:14.000]  but instead of the networks as for some casting a prison planet on tv i'm still
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:14.760]  getting used to this
[2:15:14.760 --> 2:15:16.400]  will you guys come get this
[2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:17.920]  you to but pull it up

[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:23.600]  you know we didn't call up and take the state police
[2:15:23.600 --> 2:15:26.320]  we gave you their names and phone numbers when we put out the mic report
[2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:27.520]  people still denied it
[2:15:27.520 --> 2:15:30.720]  we had a state rep on last hour documenting
[2:15:30.720 --> 2:15:33.600]  uh... that uh... he indeed
[2:15:33.600 --> 2:15:35.400]  uh... called the state police
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:38.120]  as the head of the state police coming over to his office next week
[2:15:38.120 --> 2:15:41.360]  when the legislators back in session so you heard jim gas representative tell
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:42.240]  you it's real
[2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:43.480]  but i thought i'd play
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:46.440]  this tape as well going into break and coming out of break about a minute or
[2:15:46.440 --> 2:15:47.200]  so
[2:15:47.200 --> 2:15:48.040]  uh... of it
[2:15:48.040 --> 2:15:50.560]  will be left but
[2:15:50.560 --> 2:15:54.640]  again what's happened here is we laid out no matter how much we got laughed at
[2:15:54.640 --> 2:15:57.960]  no matter how many times i got fired no matter how many stations we lost no
[2:15:57.960 --> 2:15:58.840]  matter
[2:15:58.840 --> 2:16:03.240]  you know how much monetary uh... damage it caused my small operation i
[2:16:03.240 --> 2:16:05.720]  i never wavered
[2:16:05.720 --> 2:16:09.920]  and i remember i saw other people i'm not bashing and started ron paul network
[2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:12.480]  will run paul thing during that they said oh no new world order no nine
[2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:13.480]  eleven truth
[2:16:13.480 --> 2:16:16.320]  none of this because this is how we're gonna be big and this is how we're gonna
[2:16:16.320 --> 2:16:18.720]  have a huge success and i remember saying
[2:16:18.720 --> 2:16:20.240]  you know
[2:16:20.240 --> 2:16:24.780]  imagine if you were offered real power how fast you would sell out
[2:16:24.780 --> 2:16:28.480]  imagine if you were offered real power like i have been millions of dollars a
[2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:30.040]  year power real power
[2:16:30.040 --> 2:16:33.080]  on all over the country on hundreds and hundreds of a mn fm's
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:35.320]  and i've turned it down repeatedly
[2:16:35.320 --> 2:16:37.400]  and i haven't seen many other people
[2:16:37.400 --> 2:16:40.760]  who will turn down hard cold cash
[2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:44.440]  i haven't seen people will turn down hard cold fame
[2:16:44.440 --> 2:16:45.920]  and i don't understand that
[2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:47.640]  who i am being
[2:16:47.640 --> 2:16:50.060]  accurate being honest telling it
[2:16:50.060 --> 2:16:53.820]  like it is and doing it my way is a numeral
[2:16:53.820 --> 2:16:55.440]  uno
[2:16:55.440 --> 2:16:56.760]  period
[2:16:56.760 --> 2:17:01.640]  and that's why i do what i do and i'm not bashing people
[2:17:01.640 --> 2:17:05.080]  and they started several ron paul you already on networks i've seen last year
[2:17:05.080 --> 2:17:05.800]  that
[2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:07.980]  went away the guinea bird because
[2:17:07.980 --> 2:17:10.000]  it was controlled it was censored
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:10.920]  uh...
[2:17:10.920 --> 2:17:13.880]  we don't do that here ladies and gentlemen i tell it like it is
[2:17:13.880 --> 2:17:15.760]  and i tell it as the you know best
[2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:18.720]  of my ability to understand it does that mean i'm perfect no we all see
[2:17:18.720 --> 2:17:20.080]  through
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:21.400]  arose color darkly
[2:17:21.400 --> 2:17:24.080]  we all see the world distorted from what it really is
[2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:26.960]  but i've always had to train myself to extricate myself
[2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:28.120]  from
[2:17:28.120 --> 2:17:31.720]  a motion down i coldly analyze and i get emotional on air
[2:17:31.720 --> 2:17:34.200]  that that's my nature but i coldly analyze
[2:17:34.200 --> 2:17:36.760]  make the decision
[2:17:36.760 --> 2:17:39.840]  uh... what the proper courses to take and i do it
[2:17:39.840 --> 2:17:40.680]  i do it
[2:17:40.680 --> 2:17:43.980]  and we've just had unbelievable success and it's like

[2:17:45.320 --> 2:17:49.140]  rocket off underneath us because we are just i mean it is
[2:17:49.140 --> 2:17:51.760]  it is bracing it is staggering

[2:24:56.360 --> 2:25:00.360]  recording this call i'm just like to ask you a few questions trying to clarify
[2:25:00.360 --> 2:25:05.360]  uh... there's a lot of uh... as you know a lot of information circulating on the
[2:25:05.360 --> 2:25:09.360]  internet regarding this recent my act report that was circulated
[2:25:09.360 --> 2:25:12.360]  well i don't know i've not been on the internet to see but i've certainly
[2:25:12.360 --> 2:25:15.360]  taken a bunch of calls you're familiar with this report
[2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:18.360]  yeah i'm looking at the report if we're talking about the same report
[2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:22.360]  okay uh... just a quick question there's a lot of concern
[2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:25.360]  uh... with people who are members of uh... what
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:28.360]  with some people deemed as the liberty movement or who are ron paul supporters
[2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:29.360]  okay
[2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:32.360]  members of the campaign for liberty which is a grassroots organization
[2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:36.360]  that was actually very well received recently at c-pack
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:40.360]  uh... and many of the members of uh... this organization
[2:25:40.360 --> 2:25:44.360]  uh... are predominant members in the leading parties and uh...
[2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:48.360]  again well received politically on a national level and and so i don't doubt
[2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:52.360]  that at all and i and i and i commend you and and those folks for everything
[2:25:52.360 --> 2:25:53.360]  that they've done
[2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:56.360]  okay i guess the question is uh...
[2:25:56.360 --> 2:26:00.360]  and one of the concerns why are why are people that are part of this liberty movement
[2:26:00.360 --> 2:26:05.360]  uh... being labeled or targeted or potentially profiled in this report as
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:10.360]  uh... really leads you to want to believe that this is this is a list
[2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:14.360]  of potential domestic domestic terrorist suspects
[2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:18.360]  well if you read that i don't see anywhere in that report where it targets
[2:26:18.360 --> 2:26:23.360]  anybody where profiles anybody or where it labels anybody of anything
[2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:27.360]  uh... is a terrorist or a militia group member anything like that
[2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:31.360]  and to think that uh... any law enforcement officer or agency
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:35.360]  would target somebody for political affiliation i think is uh...
[2:26:35.360 --> 2:26:39.360]  is is inappropriate and and and the uh...
[2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:42.360]  and and the report is simply does not say that
[2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:45.360]  would uh... i i appreciate that uh... what is your
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:47.360]  what is your understanding of why
[2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:51.360]  uh... the constitution party chuck paul win bob barron ron paul
[2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:53.360]  uh... mention of uh...
[2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:57.360]  people displaying ron paul bumper stickers why is there a mention of that in the report
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:27:01.360]  well if you read the report i don't think there's a mention of bumper stickers at all
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:04.360]  anywhere in the eight page report so obviously
[2:27:04.360 --> 2:27:08.360]  uh... obviously haven't read the entirety of the report or your
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:11.360]  you're looking at a report that
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:16.360]  yeah hit pause i want to comment there will continue back up about fifteen seconds
[2:27:16.360 --> 2:27:20.360]  i love this video because they put little bubbles up with arrows to where it says
[2:27:20.360 --> 2:27:23.360]  ron paul bumper stickers
[2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:26.360]  it's the last page
[2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:29.360]  so i mean i'm just getting more and more sick of this
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:31.360]  in fact i have the original report
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:35.360]  that everybody's talking about here i just showed it on judge napolitano's
[2:27:35.360 --> 2:27:37.360]  radio and tv show
[2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:40.360]  here it is where it all came from
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:42.360]  next to last page
[2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:45.360]  ron paul right up here is bumper stickers down here
[2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:48.360]  let's go ahead and show folks that again here it is
[2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:50.360]  mention of uh...
[2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:54.360]  people displaying ron paul bumper stickers why is there a mention of that in the report
[2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:58.360]  well if you read the report i don't think there's a mention of bumper stickers at all
[2:27:58.360 --> 2:28:01.360]  anywhere in the eight page report so obviously
[2:28:01.360 --> 2:28:05.360]  uh... obviously haven't read the entirety of the report or your
[2:28:05.360 --> 2:28:07.360]  looking at a report that's
[2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:11.360]  it's been altered or something else i can't speak for why you think that there's
[2:28:11.360 --> 2:28:13.360]  something in the report that says
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:18.360]  people who have a ron paul bumper sticker or any political affiliation
[2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:23.360]  bumper sticker on their car would be targeted that's just simply not true and it's not in the report
[2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:26.360]  is there a reference to the so-called patriot movement or
[2:28:26.360 --> 2:28:31.360]  people who are opposed to north american union or the new world order in there
[2:28:31.360 --> 2:28:35.360]  there's some information in there regarding certain militia groups and
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:41.360]  those violent factions that uh... operate within those uh... militia groups
[2:28:41.360 --> 2:28:45.360]  it details their certain belief systems
[2:28:45.360 --> 2:28:51.360]  and uh... what political parties or candidates they might associate themselves with
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:55.360]  but certainly the document doesn't say that anybody who's affiliated with a certain
[2:28:55.360 --> 2:28:59.360]  political candidate or a political party is certainly
[2:28:59.360 --> 2:29:03.360]  a militia member or terrorist or anything like that
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:07.360]  he's a militia member or terrorist as if being a militia
[2:29:07.360 --> 2:29:11.360]  which is in the constitution bill of rights is terrorism
[2:29:11.360 --> 2:29:16.360]  and it's all these people want to kill you here's the stickers they have ron paul
[2:29:16.360 --> 2:29:19.360]  bob bar libertarian party and it says it right there
[2:29:19.360 --> 2:29:24.360]  this is the document the state police have confirmed this is the document it's not been altered

[2:33:48.360 --> 2:33:50.360]  Peter Del Scott joins us to talk about the shadow government
[2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:52.360]  how they control the phony right wing
[2:33:52.360 --> 2:33:54.360]  how they control the phony left wing
[2:33:54.360 --> 2:33:56.360]  and where he sees all that going
[2:33:56.360 --> 2:33:58.360]  we've been interviewing over the last decade
[2:33:58.360 --> 2:34:00.360]  okay
[2:34:00.360 --> 2:34:02.360]  let's go ahead and finish up with the Mayak
[2:34:02.360 --> 2:34:04.360]  Sergeant and state police
[2:34:04.360 --> 2:34:06.360]  trying to spin
[2:34:06.360 --> 2:34:08.360]  and that's putting kindly
[2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:10.360]  the information in the report
[2:34:10.360 --> 2:34:12.360]  let's go back to it
[2:34:12.360 --> 2:34:14.360]  that document does is actually
[2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:16.360]  not true it's unsubstantiated
[2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:18.360]  and if the report
[2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:20.360]  or the training document is read
[2:34:20.360 --> 2:34:22.360]  and you would simply see
[2:34:22.360 --> 2:34:24.360]  that that's just not the case in the report
[2:34:24.360 --> 2:34:26.360]  okay
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:28.360]  well I certainly appreciate that
[2:34:28.360 --> 2:34:30.360]  what has the response been from the public
[2:34:30.360 --> 2:34:32.360]  in general on this
[2:34:32.360 --> 2:34:34.360]  from your perspective
[2:34:34.360 --> 2:34:36.360]  and is it supportive of the report or
[2:34:36.360 --> 2:34:38.360]  I don't
[2:34:38.360 --> 2:34:40.360]  I don't really know how to say
[2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:42.360]  to answer that because I really don't know
[2:34:42.360 --> 2:34:44.360]  what the general public
[2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:46.360]  in general has to say about
[2:34:46.360 --> 2:34:48.360]  we've taken some calls here
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:50.360]  at the Mayak
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:52.360]  in reference to this thing
[2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:54.360]  as far as the general public as a whole
[2:34:54.360 --> 2:34:56.360]  I really don't know what they're
[2:34:56.360 --> 2:34:58.360]  and for me to say
[2:34:58.360 --> 2:35:00.360]  what the general public's perception
[2:35:00.360 --> 2:35:02.360]  of this report is would be absolutely
[2:35:02.360 --> 2:35:04.360]  speculative in my opinion
[2:35:04.360 --> 2:35:06.360]  in terms of the I guess
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:08.360]  you're serving as a public liaison
[2:35:08.360 --> 2:35:10.360]  in regards to this report to anybody that
[2:35:10.360 --> 2:35:12.360]  calls in is that really a role that you've
[2:35:12.360 --> 2:35:14.360]  taken on here
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:16.360]  well my duty is within the Missouri
[2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:18.360]  Highway Patrol the public information officer
[2:35:18.360 --> 2:35:20.360]  for the criminal division of the highway patrol
[2:35:20.360 --> 2:35:22.360]  so anything in regards to
[2:35:22.360 --> 2:35:24.360]  the Mayak Center
[2:35:24.360 --> 2:35:26.360]  when it comes to public information
[2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:28.360]  and dissemination of information
[2:35:28.360 --> 2:35:30.360]  yes that falls into the scope of my
[2:35:30.360 --> 2:35:32.360]  responsibility and you personally don't have
[2:35:32.360 --> 2:35:34.360]  any belief that Ron Paul supporters
[2:35:34.360 --> 2:35:36.360]  or people who are supporters of the Constitution
[2:35:36.360 --> 2:35:38.360]  pose any threat to
[2:35:38.360 --> 2:35:40.360]  society at large I'm assuming correct
[2:35:40.360 --> 2:35:42.360]  personally for speaking for myself
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:44.360]  I don't find anybody
[2:35:44.360 --> 2:35:46.360]  just because they're affiliated
[2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:48.360]  with a certain political group or party
[2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:50.360]  or any danger to society
[2:35:50.360 --> 2:35:52.360]  or should be labeled that way
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:54.360]  and members of my act they take an oath
[2:35:54.360 --> 2:35:56.360]  they swear an oath to the Constitution
[2:35:56.360 --> 2:35:58.360]  I don't know what
[2:35:58.360 --> 2:36:00.360]  how about you personally I specifically don't know
[2:36:00.360 --> 2:36:02.360]  what is entailed when
[2:36:02.360 --> 2:36:04.360]  an employee at the Mayak Center when they're
[2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:06.360]  hired on what oath or what agreement
[2:36:06.360 --> 2:36:08.360]  or what they do to obtain their employment
[2:36:08.360 --> 2:36:10.360]  that's something that you'd have to speak to
[2:36:10.360 --> 2:36:12.360]  our human resources
[2:36:12.360 --> 2:36:14.360]  how about you personally as you're an officer
[2:36:14.360 --> 2:36:16.360]  of the state right of course
[2:36:16.360 --> 2:36:18.360]  taking an oath to
[2:36:18.360 --> 2:36:20.360]  you swarmed up holding to defend the Constitution
[2:36:20.360 --> 2:36:22.360]  that's correct well thank you very much
[2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:24.360]  I appreciate that thank you
[2:36:24.360 --> 2:36:26.360]  I thank you for your time sir
[2:36:26.360 --> 2:36:28.360]  good day
[2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:30.360]  okay
[2:36:30.360 --> 2:36:32.360]  so there you have it ladies and gentlemen
[2:36:32.360 --> 2:36:34.360]  notice when I had that Army Colonel
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:36.360]  who sent the 20 plus
[2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:38.360]  Army MPs
[2:36:38.360 --> 2:36:40.360]  into Alabama after that tragic shooting
[2:36:40.360 --> 2:36:42.360]  last week notice
[2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:44.360]  that when I said you swore an oath to protect the
[2:36:44.360 --> 2:36:46.360]  Constitution he wouldn't answer
[2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:48.360]  he said I'm not getting into all of that
[2:36:48.360 --> 2:36:50.360]  and along those lines
[2:36:50.360 --> 2:36:52.360]  here it is in the Houston Chronicle today
[2:36:52.360 --> 2:36:54.360]  and in CNS News, Cyber News Service
[2:36:54.360 --> 2:36:56.360]  Army reviews
[2:36:56.360 --> 2:36:58.360]  troop use after fatal
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:00.360]  Alabama shootings
[2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:02.360]  the Army has launched an inquiry into weather
[2:37:02.360 --> 2:37:04.360]  federal laws are broken when soldiers were sent
[2:37:04.360 --> 2:37:06.360]  to an Alabama town after 11 people
[2:37:06.360 --> 2:37:08.360]  died in the shooting spree
[2:37:08.360 --> 2:37:10.360]  the Army confirmed Wednesday that 22 military police
[2:37:10.360 --> 2:37:12.360]  an officer from Fort Rucker
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:14.360]  we had the Colonel on were sent to a nearby
[2:37:14.360 --> 2:37:16.360]  town of Samson after the slangs
[2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:18.360]  last week the town's tiny police force
[2:37:18.360 --> 2:37:20.360]  and County officers were stretched to the limit
[2:37:20.360 --> 2:37:22.360]  after the government killed 10 people in themselves
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:24.360]  this is a PR piece
[2:37:24.360 --> 2:37:26.360]  authorization from the governor or president is typically required
[2:37:26.360 --> 2:37:28.360]  for the deployment of federal troops on
[2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:30.360]  US soil it's not clear who ordered the troops
[2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:32.360]  to be sent into Samson
[2:37:32.360 --> 2:37:34.360]  an Army spokesman says the military is trying to determine
[2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:36.360]  what happened among the question is
[2:37:36.360 --> 2:37:38.360]  why the troops were sent and what they did there
[2:37:38.360 --> 2:37:40.360]  while they were there I mean I read
[2:37:40.360 --> 2:37:42.360]  all these mainstream articles from Oregon
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:44.360]  and Washington State and other places
[2:37:44.360 --> 2:37:46.360]  where they're putting regular Army troops
[2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:48.360]  in police departments
[2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:50.360]  as liaison officers they're announcing
[2:37:50.360 --> 2:37:52.360]  they're going to be at checkpoints helping at
[2:37:52.360 --> 2:37:54.360]  car wrecks, Marines, Army
[2:37:54.360 --> 2:37:56.360]  this is happening they've announced the Army times
[2:37:56.360 --> 2:37:58.360]  20,000 troops on the streets of America
[2:37:58.360 --> 2:38:00.360]  it's all happening
[2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:02.360]  but they still have a completely repealed
[2:38:02.360 --> 2:38:04.360]  positive comment on us they just put loopholes in it
[2:38:04.360 --> 2:38:06.360]  you can drive a 747 through
[2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:08.360]  Army investigating how
[2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:10.360]  and why troops were sent into Alabama
[2:38:10.360 --> 2:38:12.360]  town after a murder spree
[2:38:12.360 --> 2:38:14.360]  US Army has launched an inquiry into how and why
[2:38:14.360 --> 2:38:16.360]  active duty troops in Fort Rucker, Alabama
[2:38:16.360 --> 2:38:18.360]  can be placed on the streets of Samson, Alabama
[2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:20.360]  during last week's murder spree
[2:38:20.360 --> 2:38:22.360]  in that tiny South Alabama community
[2:38:22.360 --> 2:38:24.360]  the use of the troops was a possible violation
[2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:26.360]  of federal law on March 10th after a report
[2:38:26.360 --> 2:38:28.360]  on an apparent mass murder
[2:38:28.360 --> 2:38:30.360]  in Samson, Alabama 22 military police
[2:38:30.360 --> 2:38:32.360]  from Fort Rucker, Alabama
[2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:34.360]  along with the provost Marshall were sent to the city
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:36.360]  of Samson Harvey
[2:38:36.360 --> 2:38:38.360]  Preritt, spokesperson for the US Army Training
[2:38:38.360 --> 2:38:40.360]  and Doctrine Command at Fort Monroe, Virginia
[2:38:40.360 --> 2:38:42.360]  told CNS News Monday
[2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:44.360]  the purpose for sending the military police
[2:38:44.360 --> 2:38:46.360]  the authority in doing so and what duties they performed
[2:38:46.360 --> 2:38:48.360]  is a subject of an ongoing command
[2:38:48.360 --> 2:38:50.360]  inquiry directed by the commanding
[2:38:50.360 --> 2:38:52.360]  general of US Army Training and Doctrine
[2:38:52.360 --> 2:38:54.360]  Command General Martin Dempsey
[2:38:56.360 --> 2:38:58.360]  the TRA dock is
[2:38:58.360 --> 2:39:00.360]  the headquarters commanded Fort Rucker
[2:39:00.360 --> 2:39:02.360]  now by the way we still get emails and comments on the
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:04.360]  Info Wars and Prison Planet comment section
[2:39:04.360 --> 2:39:06.360]  we made all this up this isn't happening
[2:39:06.360 --> 2:39:08.360]  it doesn't matter if it's in the Houston Chronicle
[2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:10.360]  PsyOps is in there saying it doesn't exist
[2:39:14.360 --> 2:39:16.360]  the purpose for sending the military police
[2:39:16.360 --> 2:39:18.360]  it continues in addition to determining the facts
[2:39:18.360 --> 2:39:20.360]  the inquiry will also determine whether law, regulation
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:22.360]  or policy were followed, Preritt added until
[2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:24.360]  those facts are determined would be an appropriate
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:26.360]  new speculator comment further
[2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:28.360]  Jim Stormninger
[2:39:28.360 --> 2:39:30.360]  a dispatcher for the Samson Police Department
[2:39:30.360 --> 2:39:32.360]  confirmed the MP's presence in the town telling
[2:39:32.360 --> 2:39:34.360]  that the troops came in to help with traffic control
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:36.360]  and to secure the crime scene and the department
[2:39:36.360 --> 2:39:38.360]  was glad with the help so as violation
[2:39:38.360 --> 2:39:40.360]  positive commentators goes on from there
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:44.360]  so that's just some
[2:39:44.360 --> 2:39:46.360]  of what I have
[2:39:46.360 --> 2:39:48.360]  there
[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:54.360]  let me go ahead and
[2:39:54.360 --> 2:39:56.360]  cover this article
[2:39:56.360 --> 2:39:58.360]  this group of articles and we're going to your calls
[2:39:58.360 --> 2:40:00.360]  carbon
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:02.360]  global carbon price
[2:40:02.360 --> 2:40:04.360]  unlikely for 10 to 15 years
[2:40:04.360 --> 2:40:06.360]  analysts this out of Reuters
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:08.360]  now they always do this
[2:40:08.360 --> 2:40:10.360]  they have the European Union
[2:40:10.360 --> 2:40:12.360]  50 year celebrations in 2007
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:14.360]  but they claim it was founded in 2000
[2:40:14.360 --> 2:40:16.360]  so we're already
[2:40:16.360 --> 2:40:18.360]  Bush it's in in game on the White House law
[2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:20.360]  admitted they've already merged the EU with the North American Union
[2:40:20.360 --> 2:40:22.360]  Merkle and Moroso they're all up there saying
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:24.360]  leaders of Europe
[2:40:24.360 --> 2:40:26.360]  and this is what they do they go oh
[2:40:26.360 --> 2:40:28.360]  carbon tax for a while don't worry about
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:30.360]  but we've got to agree on one
[2:40:30.360 --> 2:40:32.360]  meanwhile here's one telegraph
[2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:34.360]  and literally scores whether publications
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:36.360]  saying the IMF
[2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:38.360]  is printing a
[2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:40.360]  super currency already and issuing it
[2:40:40.360 --> 2:40:42.360]  to banks but it's all secret
[2:40:42.360 --> 2:40:44.360]  so you pay your taxes
[2:40:44.360 --> 2:40:46.360]  through the federal government the IMF and World Bank
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:48.360]  and then they basically issue it to their cronies and their buddies
[2:40:50.360 --> 2:40:52.360]  then it goes on the International Monetary Fund
[2:40:52.360 --> 2:40:54.360]  is poised to embark on what analysts have described
[2:40:54.360 --> 2:40:56.360]  global quantitative easing
[2:40:56.360 --> 2:40:58.360]  by printing billions of dollars worth of global super currency
[2:40:58.360 --> 2:41:00.360]  and an unprecedented new effort
[2:41:00.360 --> 2:41:02.360]  to address the economic crisis we've got a story
[2:41:02.360 --> 2:41:04.360]  up on infowars.com right now
[2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:06.360]  it's here in my stack
[2:41:06.360 --> 2:41:08.360]  I'm trying to find it
[2:41:08.360 --> 2:41:10.360]  where they say they're already issuing it
[2:41:10.360 --> 2:41:12.360]  so that's how
[2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:14.360]  they work and how they operate
[2:41:14.360 --> 2:41:16.360]  they say we're going to start doing this
[2:41:16.360 --> 2:41:18.360]  and you find out they've already been doing it
[2:41:18.360 --> 2:41:20.360]  and the private Federal Reserve has been issuing secret
[2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:22.360]  secret new funds
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:24.360]  three times three months ago
[2:41:24.360 --> 2:41:26.360]  so that's why Geithner will never answer
[2:41:26.360 --> 2:41:28.360]  what they're doing because they're setting up a global government
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:30.360]  and they don't want the public to know about it
[2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:32.360]  but then when you read the financial publications
[2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:34.360]  they admit what's happening
[2:41:36.360 --> 2:41:38.360]  okay let's go ahead and go to your phone calls
[2:41:38.360 --> 2:41:40.360]  Matthew in Montana
[2:41:40.360 --> 2:41:42.360]  you're on the air welcome
[2:41:42.360 --> 2:41:44.360]  hello Alex from Montana
[2:41:44.360 --> 2:41:46.360]  long live the Republic and long live the truth
[2:41:46.360 --> 2:41:48.360]  we're doing our job over here
[2:41:48.360 --> 2:41:50.360]  in Montana and getting hours of your
[2:41:50.360 --> 2:41:52.360]  documentaries out on access
[2:41:52.360 --> 2:41:54.360]  television
[2:41:54.360 --> 2:41:56.360]  every week for years now
[2:41:56.360 --> 2:41:58.360]  has it had an effect in your area?
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:00.360]  yeah definitely
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:02.360]  I think Montana
[2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:04.360]  is at the forefront of freedom
[2:42:04.360 --> 2:42:06.360]  in the Second Amendment as you know
[2:42:06.360 --> 2:42:08.360]  the state sovereignty movement
[2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:10.360]  and now the latest
[2:42:10.360 --> 2:42:12.360]  that's on GCN
[2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:14.360]  page the hard money
[2:42:14.360 --> 2:42:16.360]  issue is going through
[2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:18.360]  the state legislature right now
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:20.360]  you know we're
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:22.360]  fighting a good fight
[2:42:22.360 --> 2:42:24.360]  we've got a
[2:42:24.360 --> 2:42:26.360]  I mean we're still a minority
[2:42:26.360 --> 2:42:28.360]  but a much larger minority
[2:42:28.360 --> 2:42:30.360]  compared to
[2:42:30.360 --> 2:42:32.360]  like you were pointing out 10 or 20 years ago
[2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:34.360]  but that's just because the general public
[2:42:34.360 --> 2:42:36.360]  all of them don't know about us
[2:42:36.360 --> 2:42:38.360]  if you ask the public are you against the banks robbing you blind
[2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:40.360]  or you're against the unelected world government
[2:42:40.360 --> 2:42:42.360]  run by the banks that did it
[2:42:42.360 --> 2:42:44.360]  are you against open borders
[2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:46.360]  they're against everything they agree with us
[2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:48.360]  yeah no you're absolutely right
[2:42:48.360 --> 2:42:50.360]  and we are a threat to the
[2:42:50.360 --> 2:42:52.360]  new rule order or they wouldn't be secretly demonizing us
[2:42:52.360 --> 2:42:54.360]  to every police agency out there
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:56.360]  oh you're absolutely right
[2:42:56.360 --> 2:42:58.360]  and when I say a minority
[2:42:58.360 --> 2:43:00.360]  I mean that in a positive way
[2:43:00.360 --> 2:43:02.360]  I mean we
[2:43:02.360 --> 2:43:04.360]  years ago we were a small percentage and now
[2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:06.360]  I don't know what we are
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:08.360]  10-20% you know so
[2:43:08.360 --> 2:43:10.360]  we're definitely having
[2:43:10.360 --> 2:43:12.360]  an impact and as you point out
[2:43:12.360 --> 2:43:14.360]  the truth is exploding
[2:43:14.360 --> 2:43:16.360]  exponentially
[2:43:16.360 --> 2:43:18.360]  oh my gosh it's frightening
[2:43:18.360 --> 2:43:20.360]  that's implications
[2:43:20.360 --> 2:43:22.360]  I was doing this years ago
[2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:24.360]  during Gulf War I was publishing a paper
[2:43:24.360 --> 2:43:26.360]  and going on radio and TV and just like you were pointing out
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:28.360]  I'd come home and my
[2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:30.360]  answering machine would just be full
[2:43:30.360 --> 2:43:32.360]  of calls calling me a traitor
[2:43:32.360 --> 2:43:34.360]  and anti-American and
[2:43:34.360 --> 2:43:36.360]  everything else because of that time
[2:43:36.360 --> 2:43:38.360]  we were talking about
[2:43:38.360 --> 2:43:40.360]  the new world order bringing out the documents
[2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:42.360]  showing everybody and of course we were called
[2:43:42.360 --> 2:43:44.360]  anti-American and everything else
[2:43:44.360 --> 2:43:46.360]  but
[2:43:46.360 --> 2:43:48.360]  thank god
[2:43:48.360 --> 2:43:50.360]  going in the 21st century
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:52.360]  people like yourself have taken the lead
[2:43:52.360 --> 2:43:54.360]  and going forward
[2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:56.360]  with the truth
[2:43:56.360 --> 2:43:58.360]  and getting it out there because
[2:43:58.360 --> 2:44:00.360]  like you point out the truth will ultimately prevail
[2:44:00.360 --> 2:44:02.360]  and it is prevailing
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:04.360]  absolutely sir I appreciate your call
[2:44:04.360 --> 2:44:06.360]  I was just watching on prisonplanet.tv
[2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:08.360]  they put the website up there with rotating articles
[2:44:08.360 --> 2:44:10.360]  and I saw and confirmed
[2:44:10.360 --> 2:44:12.360]  a bunch of Facebook accounts
[2:44:12.360 --> 2:44:14.360]  with hundreds and in some cases thousands of members
[2:44:14.360 --> 2:44:16.360]  erasing links to the Obama deception
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:18.360]  banning accounts that put out
[2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:20.360]  the Obama deception
[2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:22.360]  and
[2:44:22.360 --> 2:44:24.360]  I was just looking on the screen I'm trying to pull it up
[2:44:24.360 --> 2:44:26.360]  I saw a new
[2:44:26.360 --> 2:44:28.360]  censorship article
[2:44:28.360 --> 2:44:30.360]  dealing with the Obama deception
[2:44:30.360 --> 2:44:32.360]  but my computer my little $300
[2:44:32.360 --> 2:44:34.360]  Acer is not loading
[2:44:34.360 --> 2:44:36.360]  it says Christian
[2:44:36.360 --> 2:44:38.360]  YouTube censors Obama deception
[2:44:38.360 --> 2:44:40.360]  what does that mean
[2:44:40.360 --> 2:44:42.360]  it says a site that brands itself
[2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:44.360]  as a kind of YouTube for Christians
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:46.360]  which
[2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:48.360]  was formerly known
[2:44:48.360 --> 2:44:50.360]  as
[2:44:50.360 --> 2:44:52.360]  GodTube.com has censored
[2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:54.360]  Alex Jones's newest film the Obama deception
[2:44:54.360 --> 2:44:56.360]  after claiming the documentary
[2:45:00.360 --> 2:45:02.360]  contains slander and libel I was reading it across the room
[2:45:02.360 --> 2:45:04.360]  one of our readers tried to upload
[2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:06.360]  the Obama deception to the Tangle website
[2:45:06.360 --> 2:45:08.360]  in four parts
[2:45:08.360 --> 2:45:10.360]  but two of these sections ever baited and the reader was
[2:45:10.360 --> 2:45:12.360]  subsequently contacted
[2:45:12.360 --> 2:45:14.360]  by the community care administrator for Tangle
[2:45:14.360 --> 2:45:16.360]  hello and thank you for using
[2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:18.360]  Tangle so the email your video
[2:45:18.360 --> 2:45:20.360]  contains slander and libel really a court found
[2:45:20.360 --> 2:45:22.360]  that huh we cannot allow this content
[2:45:22.360 --> 2:45:24.360]  on the site without documented
[2:45:24.360 --> 2:45:26.360]  proof of the accusations please refer
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:28.360]  to our terms of use information
[2:45:28.360 --> 2:45:30.360]  well that's fine it's their little miserable
[2:45:30.360 --> 2:45:32.360]  censorship channel I mean you know I don't
[2:45:32.360 --> 2:45:34.360]  know about this site but most of the big churches
[2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:36.360]  publicly Obama's continuing the faith
[2:45:36.360 --> 2:45:38.360]  based initiative tens of billions of churches
[2:45:38.360 --> 2:45:40.360]  and they're buying them off the clergy response
[2:45:40.360 --> 2:45:42.360]  teams you know to go out and tell people
[2:45:42.360 --> 2:45:44.360]  to accept martial law and obamas of God
[2:45:44.360 --> 2:45:46.360]  and of the Lord we've shown you
[2:45:46.360 --> 2:45:48.360]  what they teach in Catholic
[2:45:48.360 --> 2:45:50.360]  Protestant churches it doesn't matter
[2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:52.360]  and so there you have it
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:54.360]  more and more censorship of the Obama deception
[2:45:54.360 --> 2:45:56.360]  and I read
[2:45:56.360 --> 2:45:58.360]  in the first hour how all over the world
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:00.360]  Canada
[2:46:00.360 --> 2:46:02.360]  Australia they're just saying we're going to ban
[2:46:02.360 --> 2:46:04.360]  political websites it's now happening
[2:46:04.360 --> 2:46:06.360]  this is really going on ladies and gentlemen
[2:46:06.360 --> 2:46:08.360]  and
[2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:10.360]  so I suggest that everybody go to the
[2:46:10.360 --> 2:46:12.360]  website
[2:46:12.360 --> 2:46:14.360]  that give me the specific address
[2:46:14.360 --> 2:46:16.360]  we scroll down a bit so I can see you guys
[2:46:16.360 --> 2:46:18.360]  or just print me the story
[2:46:18.360 --> 2:46:20.360]  it's kind of hard to read it when I can't see it thanks
[2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:24.360]  the website is
[2:46:24.360 --> 2:46:26.360]  Tangle.com
[2:46:26.360 --> 2:46:28.360]  people should just go and upload lots of
[2:46:28.360 --> 2:46:30.360]  short videos saying go to
[2:46:30.360 --> 2:46:32.360]  TheObamaDeception.net
[2:46:32.360 --> 2:46:34.360]  and find out what's being censored just keep uploading
[2:46:34.360 --> 2:46:36.360]  it over and over again they won't be able to
[2:46:36.360 --> 2:46:38.360]  stop you doing that just upload
[2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:40.360]  20 second videos
[2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:42.360]  basically it's a quick and easy to get that done
[2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:44.360]  but yes
[2:46:44.360 --> 2:46:46.360]  and as Obama deception is more and more viral
[2:46:46.360 --> 2:46:48.360]  you're going to see more and more of this censorship
[2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:50.360]  let's go ahead
[2:46:50.360 --> 2:46:52.360]  and go back to the
[2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:54.360]  callers here
[2:46:54.360 --> 2:46:56.360]  let's talk to Jeff
[2:46:56.360 --> 2:46:58.360]  in Ohio Jeff you're on the air
[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:00.360]  yeah what's up Alex
[2:47:00.360 --> 2:47:02.360]  I just have a couple questions for you
[2:47:02.360 --> 2:47:04.360]  I don't know if you know anything about
[2:47:04.360 --> 2:47:06.360]  St. Dusky, Ohio being built
[2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:08.360]  after the Square and Compass
[2:47:08.360 --> 2:47:10.360]  I know a lot of major cities
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:12.360]  and even small towns like
[2:47:12.360 --> 2:47:14.360]  the place where Scull and Bones
[2:47:14.360 --> 2:47:16.360]  is located
[2:47:16.360 --> 2:47:18.360]  in Connecticut
[2:47:18.360 --> 2:47:20.360]  that they are set up
[2:47:20.360 --> 2:47:22.360]  according to the sacred
[2:47:22.360 --> 2:47:24.360]  geometry or architecture yes
[2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:26.360]  alright well I was just wondering
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:28.360]  they have a
[2:47:28.360 --> 2:47:30.360]  here in Ohio on Saturday they have
[2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:32.360]  every Masonic lodge
[2:47:32.360 --> 2:47:34.360]  has got an open house
[2:47:34.360 --> 2:47:36.360]  and I was just wondering
[2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:38.360]  on your opinion you think it would be a good idea
[2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:40.360]  a bad idea to go and try and ask questions
[2:47:40.360 --> 2:47:42.360]  oh I think it's great
[2:47:42.360 --> 2:47:44.360]  look you're going to find
[2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:46.360]  I want to be clear about this
[2:47:46.360 --> 2:47:48.360]  and I always mention this and people act like it's some big secret
[2:47:48.360 --> 2:47:50.360]  and they found me out when it was on my show
[2:47:50.360 --> 2:47:52.360]  we're on air right now
[2:47:52.360 --> 2:47:54.360]  they'll cut clips out and go this was secretly behind scenes
[2:47:54.360 --> 2:47:56.360]  with Alex on TV
[2:47:56.360 --> 2:47:58.360]  and we have it and they clip it to real short
[2:47:58.360 --> 2:48:00.360]  with me going I have family that are Masons
[2:48:00.360 --> 2:48:02.360]  and then look
[2:48:02.360 --> 2:48:04.360]  we caught the secret video
[2:48:04.360 --> 2:48:06.360]  it's all sorts of deception is used
[2:48:06.360 --> 2:48:08.360]  it's a lone star state
[2:48:08.360 --> 2:48:10.360]  Texas was founded by predominantly Masons
[2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:12.360]  and George Washington
[2:48:12.360 --> 2:48:14.360]  was a Mason
[2:48:14.360 --> 2:48:16.360]  I guess about half the founders were
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:18.360]  but they were what you'd call porch Masons
[2:48:18.360 --> 2:48:20.360]  and
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:22.360]  it's such a complex situation
[2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:24.360]  technology
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:26.360]  mathematics, knowledge has always been power
[2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:28.360]  and you go back
[2:48:28.360 --> 2:48:30.360]  2000, 3000, 4000 years ago in Babylon
[2:48:30.360 --> 2:48:32.360]  in Egypt or then in Israel later
[2:48:32.360 --> 2:48:34.360]  or in Tyre or in Greece or in Rome
[2:48:34.360 --> 2:48:36.360]  knowledge was
[2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:38.360]  very coveted and they had secret
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:40.360]  mystery schools, when you hear mystery schools
[2:48:40.360 --> 2:48:42.360]  it had all these gods and mumbo jumbo
[2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:44.360]  and temple prostitutes and everything else
[2:48:44.360 --> 2:48:46.360]  but it was also mathematics
[2:48:46.360 --> 2:48:48.360]  and they called
[2:48:48.360 --> 2:48:50.360]  basically metalwork alchemy
[2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:52.360]  so science was mixed in
[2:48:52.360 --> 2:48:54.360]  with superstition and mumbo jumbo
[2:48:54.360 --> 2:48:56.360]  and so you have these fraternal
[2:48:56.360 --> 2:48:58.360]  brotherhoods but clearly
[2:48:58.360 --> 2:49:00.360]  Masonry has been used as a vehicle
[2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:02.360]  in the last 300 years
[2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:04.360]  for dark forces
[2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:06.360]  secret societies before
[2:49:06.360 --> 2:49:08.360]  were what we call intelligence agencies today
[2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:10.360]  and George Washington before he died
[2:49:10.360 --> 2:49:12.360]  so there's something terrible in Masonry, something bad
[2:49:12.360 --> 2:49:14.360]  and there's bad people at the higher levels of it
[2:49:14.360 --> 2:49:16.360]  and so there's been a fight
[2:49:16.360 --> 2:49:18.360]  within it but then it turns people
[2:49:18.360 --> 2:49:20.360]  off and then they think
[2:49:20.360 --> 2:49:22.360]  this shows lying about them
[2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:24.360]  when 98% of masons are
[2:49:24.360 --> 2:49:26.360]  porch masons that is their outer masons
[2:49:26.360 --> 2:49:28.360]  they're compartmentalized, they don't know what they're part of
[2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:30.360]  and I mean
[2:49:30.360 --> 2:49:32.360]  Colonel Travis was a Mason
[2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:34.360]  Sam Houston was a Mason
[2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:36.360]  they were not bad people
[2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:38.360]  I believe Andrew Jackson
[2:49:38.360 --> 2:49:40.360]  was a Mason but he fought the global bankers
[2:49:40.360 --> 2:49:42.360]  in the New World War, the British Masons
[2:49:42.360 --> 2:49:44.360]  so it's an oversimplification
[2:49:44.360 --> 2:49:46.360]  to think
[2:49:46.360 --> 2:49:48.360]  that you're going to go into any Masonic lodge
[2:49:48.360 --> 2:49:50.360]  and there are a bunch of devil worshipers, they don't know
[2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:52.360]  that in the higher degrees, and this is a fact
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:54.360]  Morals and Dogma
[2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:56.360]  Albert Pike
[2:49:56.360 --> 2:49:58.360]  the books that Manly P. Hall wrote
[2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:00.360]  which are published and available
[2:50:00.360 --> 2:50:02.360]  go to the library and read them
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:04.360]  they openly say at the higher levels
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:06.360]  it is Lucifer they're worshiping
[2:50:06.360 --> 2:50:08.360]  and that's a bad thing but they believe Lucifer is really the good God
[2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:10.360]  and the other God is like
[2:50:10.360 --> 2:50:12.360]  his brother in his bag as he tried to keep the knowledge
[2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:14.360]  from the people, in fact pull up that YouTube
[2:50:14.360 --> 2:50:16.360]  just Google
[2:50:16.360 --> 2:50:18.360]  Mason says he loves Lucifer
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:20.360]  where he goes oh sweet Lucifer
[2:50:20.360 --> 2:50:22.360]  and you know people watch this, you see Mason's commenting
[2:50:22.360 --> 2:50:24.360]  oh well, he was just joking
[2:50:24.360 --> 2:50:26.360]  because they're lower Masons and don't know
[2:50:26.360 --> 2:50:28.360]  this is really what's going on, so I would go to them
[2:50:28.360 --> 2:50:30.360]  and explain to them in that way
[2:50:30.360 --> 2:50:32.360]  and ask them questions and give them a copy
[2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:34.360]  of the Obama deception
[2:50:34.360 --> 2:50:36.360]  because we've got to go after Jews, Muslims, Christians,
[2:50:36.360 --> 2:50:38.360]  Masons

[2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:42.360]  with the message of Liberty and Freedom
[2:50:42.360 --> 2:50:44.360]  so they can wake up and then make informed decisions
[2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:46.360]  does that answer your question?
[2:50:46.360 --> 2:50:48.360]  Yeah, it actually does
[2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:50.360]  Yeah, but I mean I had great grandpas
[2:50:50.360 --> 2:50:52.360]  and people that were Masons, they were not bad people
[2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:54.360]  but
[2:50:54.360 --> 2:50:56.360]  yes, at the top it has certainly been

[2:52:04.360 --> 2:52:06.360]  that's just as powerful
[2:52:06.360 --> 2:52:08.360]  just as strong
[2:52:08.360 --> 2:52:10.360]  just as well funded
[2:52:10.360 --> 2:52:12.360]  The Obama deception
[2:52:12.360 --> 2:52:14.360]  completely destroys the myth
[2:52:14.360 --> 2:52:16.360]  that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:52:16.360 --> 2:52:18.360]  of the American people

[2:52:36.360 --> 2:52:38.360]  and finance oligarchs
[2:52:38.360 --> 2:52:40.360]  that's fascism

[2:54:08.360 --> 2:54:10.360]  The Dallas Observer just did a
[2:54:10.360 --> 2:54:12.360]  review of the Obama deception
[2:54:14.360 --> 2:54:16.360]  But they said, oh, Jones
[2:54:16.360 --> 2:54:18.360]  is claiming millions of years
[2:54:18.360 --> 2:54:20.360]  But it only says 160,000
[2:54:20.360 --> 2:54:22.360]  on a YouTube channel
[2:54:22.360 --> 2:54:24.360]  There's hundreds of versions
[2:54:24.360 --> 2:54:26.360]  of it posted on YouTube
[2:54:26.360 --> 2:54:28.360]  and Google
[2:54:28.360 --> 2:54:30.360]  And you'll see one with
[2:54:30.360 --> 2:54:32.360]  200 and something thousand views
[2:54:32.360 --> 2:54:34.360]  and another with 160,000 views
[2:54:34.360 --> 2:54:36.360]  and another with 120,000 views
[2:54:36.360 --> 2:54:38.360]  and another with 80,000 views
[2:54:38.360 --> 2:54:40.360]  and another with 120,000 views
[2:54:40.360 --> 2:54:42.360]  and another with 250,000 views
[2:54:42.360 --> 2:54:44.360]  That's what we're sexy
[2:54:44.360 --> 2:54:46.360]  See how people think
[2:54:46.360 --> 2:54:48.360]  kind of two-dimensionally
[2:54:48.360 --> 2:54:50.360]  to the three-dimensionally
[2:54:50.360 --> 2:54:52.360]  They say, oh, I'm seeing one copy of it
[2:54:52.360 --> 2:54:54.360]  It says 160,000 views
[2:54:54.360 --> 2:54:56.360]  So that means there's not millions watching
[2:54:56.360 --> 2:54:58.360]  What does that mean?
[2:54:58.360 --> 2:55:00.360]  I mean, why don't people's brains work right?
[2:55:00.360 --> 2:55:02.360]  We're not even trying
[2:55:02.360 --> 2:55:04.360]  to go see where it's posted everywhere
[2:55:04.360 --> 2:55:06.360]  It's all over every video site we've looked at
[2:55:06.360 --> 2:55:08.360]  Hundreds that we've looked at
[2:55:08.360 --> 2:55:10.360]  Burmese is obsessed with this stuff
[2:55:10.360 --> 2:55:12.360]  And they're just hours loving it
[2:55:12.360 --> 2:55:14.360]  He loves to communicate with humanity

[2:55:18.360 --> 2:55:20.360]  But the best quality copy is changed
[2:55:20.360 --> 2:55:22.360]  to Channel's channel on YouTube
[2:55:22.360 --> 2:55:24.360]  Super good end code for YouTube
[2:55:24.360 --> 2:55:26.360]  That's the one we've linked to
[2:55:26.360 --> 2:55:28.360]  at infowars.com and prismplanet.com
[2:55:28.360 --> 2:55:30.360]  We want to make that number one
[2:55:30.360 --> 2:55:32.360]  There's a bunch of cruddy copies with 200 and something thousand views
[2:55:32.360 --> 2:55:34.360]  above it
[2:55:34.360 --> 2:55:36.360]  So that's what's linked all over the web
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:38.360]  when you Google the Obama deception
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:40.360]  In fact, that's Kurt and Paul
[2:55:40.360 --> 2:55:42.360]  And just to post again
[2:55:42.360 --> 2:55:44.360]  for the next few days so people can find it easy
[2:55:44.360 --> 2:55:46.360]  Not just in sub pages or it moves down the page
[2:55:46.360 --> 2:55:48.360]  The change to channel version
[2:55:48.360 --> 2:55:50.360]  So we can drive that up to number one
[2:55:50.360 --> 2:55:52.360]  So people are going to take two hours out to watch it
[2:55:52.360 --> 2:55:54.360]  We'll see it in high quality

[2:56:06.360 --> 2:56:08.360]  Speaking of sponsors

[2:57:12.360 --> 2:57:14.360]  I wish I knew about this thing years ago
[2:57:14.360 --> 2:57:16.360]  yeah it's really neat. For 10 years these folks

[2:59:56.360 --> 2:59:58.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network

[3:00:08.360 --> 3:00:10.360]  will also take calls during that
[3:00:10.360 --> 3:00:12.360]  this is the type of stuff that comes in our mail
[3:00:12.360 --> 3:00:14.360]  every day
[3:00:14.360 --> 3:00:16.360]  not just secret state police reports
[3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:18.360]  saying anybody who loves America is a terrorist basically
[3:00:18.360 --> 3:00:20.360]  Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
[3:00:20.360 --> 3:00:22.360]  in conjunction with the officers
[3:00:22.360 --> 3:00:24.360]  of Superior Gloria Molina First District
[3:00:24.360 --> 3:00:26.360]  that says
[3:00:26.360 --> 3:00:28.360]  GIFs for guns, exchanger farms for gift cards
[3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:30.360]  Walmart
[3:00:30.360 --> 3:00:32.360]  Ralph's supermarkets
[3:00:32.360 --> 3:00:34.360]  Food for less supermarkets and Target stores
[3:00:34.360 --> 3:00:36.360]  no questions asked, no strings attached
[3:00:36.360 --> 3:00:38.360]  and every time we check this it's not true
[3:00:38.360 --> 3:00:40.360]  no strings attached
[3:00:40.360 --> 3:00:42.360]  you remain anonymous, please leave your firearms
[3:00:42.360 --> 3:00:44.360]  in the trunk of your car
[3:00:44.360 --> 3:00:46.360]  because they come to your car to get your license plate
[3:00:46.360 --> 3:00:48.360]  when they take it, oh my god
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:50.360]  join us March 28, 2009
[3:00:50.360 --> 3:00:52.360]  the cops live folks, they're trained to
[3:00:52.360 --> 3:00:54.360]  register
[3:00:54.360 --> 3:00:56.360]  and it says
[3:00:56.360 --> 3:00:58.360]  rear parking lot, so you register your name
[3:00:58.360 --> 3:01:00.360]  you go in, they go to your car and register you
[3:01:00.360 --> 3:01:02.360]  but oh, it's anonymous
[3:01:02.360 --> 3:01:04.360]  right here it contradicts itself
[3:01:04.360 --> 3:01:06.360]  here it is ladies and gentlemen
[3:01:06.360 --> 3:01:08.360]  you register, they come out of your car, they get it
[3:01:08.360 --> 3:01:10.360]  you register but they don't know you gave them a gun
[3:01:10.360 --> 3:01:12.360]  for a gift certificate
[3:01:14.360 --> 3:01:16.360]  this is the type of crap
[3:01:16.360 --> 3:01:18.360]  and they always have news cameras there
[3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:20.360]  to create the image of
[3:01:20.360 --> 3:01:22.360]  to condition people, they did this in England and Australia
[3:01:22.360 --> 3:01:24.360]  before they confiscated guns
[3:01:24.360 --> 3:01:26.360]  to have the images of people lined up turning guns in
[3:01:26.360 --> 3:01:28.360]  they're doing this in Dallas, Texas
[3:01:28.360 --> 3:01:30.360]  they're doing this in every state
[3:01:30.360 --> 3:01:32.360]  I mean this is unbelievable
[3:01:32.360 --> 3:01:34.360]  it doesn't say what you get here
[3:01:34.360 --> 3:01:36.360]  there's a little asterisk
[3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:38.360]  that says for gift cards
[3:01:38.360 --> 3:01:40.360]  and I don't see the asterisk
[3:01:40.360 --> 3:01:42.360]  it says while supplies last
[3:01:42.360 --> 3:01:44.360]  so that means they'll just go, go ahead and give me that gun
[3:01:44.360 --> 3:01:46.360]  they're going to arrest some people
[3:01:46.360 --> 3:01:48.360]  they run the backgrounds on the guns
[3:01:48.360 --> 3:01:50.360]  what idiots, but hey, they want to be slaves, go ahead
[3:01:50.360 --> 3:01:52.360]  let's go ahead and talk to William
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:54.360]  in Michigan, Groom, Melissa, Danny
[3:01:54.360 --> 3:01:56.360]  Alex and others, oh wait
[3:01:56.360 --> 3:01:58.360]  stop, Alex disagrees
[3:01:58.360 --> 3:02:00.360]  I miss seeing that
[3:02:00.360 --> 3:02:02.360]  so let's go to the head of the line
[3:02:02.360 --> 3:02:04.360]  for him, if he can remain civil
[3:02:04.360 --> 3:02:06.360]  we'll keep him on a minute, go ahead sir
[3:02:06.360 --> 3:02:08.360]  I don't
[3:02:08.360 --> 3:02:10.360]  I wanted to, can you hear me alright first of all
[3:02:10.360 --> 3:02:12.360]  is this the guy always calling in
[3:02:12.360 --> 3:02:14.360]  plugging his music videos
[3:02:14.360 --> 3:02:16.360]  no, no, I don't even know who that is
[3:02:16.360 --> 3:02:18.360]  okay, because I got calls with different names
[3:02:18.360 --> 3:02:20.360]  okay, go ahead and make your point sir
[3:02:20.360 --> 3:02:22.360]  okay, well you were talking about pre-masonry
[3:02:22.360 --> 3:02:24.360]  and you make the point a lot
[3:02:24.360 --> 3:02:26.360]  where you say
[3:02:26.360 --> 3:02:28.360]  that there were porch masons
[3:02:28.360 --> 3:02:30.360]  I don't think that's the case at all, like per case in point
[3:02:30.360 --> 3:02:32.360]  Andrew Jackson
[3:02:32.360 --> 3:02:34.360]  that guy who shut down the
[3:02:34.360 --> 3:02:36.360]  first two national banks
[3:02:36.360 --> 3:02:38.360]  that they tried to set up in our country
[3:02:40.360 --> 3:02:42.360]  he wasn't just some kind of porch mason
[3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:44.360]  he was the grandmaster of Tennessee
[3:02:44.360 --> 3:02:46.360]  Freemasonry
[3:02:46.360 --> 3:02:48.360]  I knew I'd read that he was a
[3:02:48.360 --> 3:02:50.360]  mason, yeah
[3:02:50.360 --> 3:02:52.360]  that's what I said five minutes ago
[3:02:52.360 --> 3:02:54.360]  he was the grandmaster
[3:02:54.360 --> 3:02:56.360]  of Tennessee Freemasonry
[3:02:56.360 --> 3:02:58.360]  well I just said Texas
[3:02:58.360 --> 3:03:00.360]  was founded by masons
[3:03:00.360 --> 3:03:02.360]  and I just, I mean
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:04.360]  are you saying that
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:06.360]  there aren't all these top masons that have published
[3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:08.360]  books saying they're God is Lucifer
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:10.360]  oh sure, but they
[3:03:10.360 --> 3:03:12.360]  think Jesus is Lucifer though
[3:03:12.360 --> 3:03:14.360]  so they have this weird like take on it
[3:03:14.360 --> 3:03:16.360]  that's kind of a no, that's a mid-level
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:18.360]  no, they think it's dual
[3:03:18.360 --> 3:03:20.360]  but it's two different creatures
[3:03:20.360 --> 3:03:22.360]  look, I mean
[3:03:22.360 --> 3:03:24.360]  okay, so you disagree with that
[3:03:24.360 --> 3:03:26.360]  you're right, some of them weren't porch masons
[3:03:26.360 --> 3:03:28.360]  my point is
[3:03:28.360 --> 3:03:30.360]  is that George Washington did speak out about
[3:03:30.360 --> 3:03:32.360]  what was happening in Masonry, that's on record
[3:03:32.360 --> 3:03:34.360]  okay
[3:03:34.360 --> 3:03:36.360]  top level masons in England spoke about
[3:03:36.360 --> 3:03:38.360]  what was happening in Masonry too
[3:03:38.360 --> 3:03:40.360]  talking about like a son
[3:03:40.360 --> 3:03:42.360]  I forgot who his name was
[3:03:42.360 --> 3:03:44.360]  one of the top grandmasters
[3:03:44.360 --> 3:03:46.360]  of English Freemasonry
[3:03:46.360 --> 3:03:48.360]  talking about some son order
[3:03:48.360 --> 3:03:50.360]  taking over Freemasonry and calling
[3:03:50.360 --> 3:03:52.360]  black son
[3:03:52.360 --> 3:03:54.360]  black son
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:03:56.360]  but
[3:03:56.360 --> 3:03:58.360]  this is where it gets kind of
[3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:02.360]  let me ask you a question
[3:04:02.360 --> 3:04:04.360]  we have people like Chiang Kai-shek
[3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:06.360]  the guy who fought
[3:04:06.360 --> 3:04:08.360]  Mao Zedong
[3:04:08.360 --> 3:04:10.360]  that guy was a big Freemason
[3:04:10.360 --> 3:04:12.360]  and the CIA betrayed him
[3:04:12.360 --> 3:04:14.360]  and kicked him out and didn't give him the weapons
[3:04:14.360 --> 3:04:16.360]  and put Mao in and that's now declassified
[3:04:16.360 --> 3:04:18.360]  look at something like the CIA
[3:04:18.360 --> 3:04:20.360]  I haven't seen any Freemasons in the CIA
[3:04:20.360 --> 3:04:22.360]  are you joking
[3:04:22.360 --> 3:04:24.360]  Alan Dulles
[3:04:24.360 --> 3:04:26.360]  I got a big nine
[3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:28.360]  hold on a second
[3:04:28.360 --> 3:04:30.360]  you're not letting me talk
[3:04:30.360 --> 3:04:32.360]  you just keep mumbling
[3:04:32.360 --> 3:04:34.360]  I'm letting you make your points
[3:04:34.360 --> 3:04:36.360]  but you just said you haven't seen
[3:04:36.360 --> 3:04:38.360]  any Freemasons in the CIA
[3:04:40.360 --> 3:04:42.360]  seeing in my research
[3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:44.360]  well you aren't researching very hard
[3:04:44.360 --> 3:04:46.360]  it's filled with Freemasons
[3:04:46.360 --> 3:04:48.360]  and there's knights of Malta
[3:04:48.360 --> 3:04:50.360]  that are masons big p2 lodge over there
[3:04:50.360 --> 3:04:52.360]  it's all interconnected
[3:04:52.360 --> 3:04:54.360]  and there's these obsessions on this group or that group
[3:04:54.360 --> 3:04:56.360]  but we didn't have time to go to other calls
[3:04:56.360 --> 3:04:58.360]  we'll try everybody else
[3:04:58.360 --> 3:05:20.360]  this will be right back
[3:05:28.360 --> 3:05:30.360]  it's every bit organic
[3:05:30.360 --> 3:05:32.360]  and more nutritious than our modern diets
[3:05:32.360 --> 3:05:34.360]  well respected in her field
[3:05:34.360 --> 3:05:36.360]  Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes

[3:05:58.360 --> 3:06:00.360]  a little knowledge makes starvation impossible
[3:06:00.360 --> 3:06:02.360]  in the new world order's
[3:06:02.360 --> 3:06:04.360]  war against humanity
[3:06:04.360 --> 3:06:06.360]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[3:06:06.360 --> 3:06:08.360]  we've got to have a civilian national security force
[3:06:08.360 --> 3:06:10.360]  that's just as powerful
[3:06:10.360 --> 3:06:12.360]  just as strong
[3:06:12.360 --> 3:06:14.360]  just as well funded
[3:06:14.360 --> 3:06:16.360]  the Obama deception
[3:06:16.360 --> 3:06:18.360]  completely destroys the myth
[3:06:18.360 --> 3:06:20.360]  that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:06:20.360 --> 3:06:22.360]  of the American people
[3:06:22.360 --> 3:06:24.360]  well Obama's already fudging
[3:06:24.360 --> 3:06:26.360]  fudge since day one in this election
[3:06:26.360 --> 3:06:28.360]  if you have a demagogue
[3:06:28.360 --> 3:06:30.360]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:06:30.360 --> 3:06:32.360]  who is imposing the program
[3:06:32.360 --> 3:06:34.360]  of a group of extreme bankers
[3:06:34.360 --> 3:06:36.360]  and finance oligarchs
[3:06:36.360 --> 3:06:38.360]  that's fascism
[3:06:38.360 --> 3:06:40.360]  it's not about left or right
[3:06:40.360 --> 3:06:42.360]  it's about a one world government
[3:06:42.360 --> 3:06:44.360]  this film documents who Obama works for
[3:06:44.360 --> 3:06:46.360]  the lies he is told

[3:06:58.360 --> 3:07:00.360]  the people strike back
[3:07:00.360 --> 3:07:02.360]  did you know that pH balance
[3:07:02.360 --> 3:07:04.360]  is one of the most important factors
[3:07:04.360 --> 3:07:06.360]  in maintaining high energy
[3:07:06.360 --> 3:07:08.360]  and vibrant health? most experts agree
[3:07:08.360 --> 3:07:10.360]  that the water you drink should be at a pH level
[3:07:10.360 --> 3:07:12.360]  of 9 or higher
[3:07:12.360 --> 3:07:14.360]  plasma pH drops
[3:07:14.360 --> 3:07:16.360]  combine a unique formula of the most alkaline
[3:07:16.360 --> 3:07:18.360]  minerals and elements
[3:07:18.360 --> 3:07:20.360]  this product is a one of a kind in its strength
[3:07:20.360 --> 3:07:22.360]  and effectiveness
[3:07:22.360 --> 3:07:24.360]  using plasma pH drops
[3:07:24.360 --> 3:07:26.360]  is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline
[3:07:26.360 --> 3:07:28.360]  while helping you get rid of acid
[3:07:28.360 --> 3:07:30.360]  and regaining your health and energy
[3:07:30.360 --> 3:07:32.360]  with just 10 drops
[3:07:32.360 --> 3:07:34.360]  you can raise the pH level of the water you drink
[3:07:34.360 --> 3:07:36.360]  up to the pH of 10
[3:07:36.360 --> 3:07:38.360]  alkalizing water helps the body rid itself
[3:07:38.360 --> 3:07:40.360]  of acidic waste
[3:07:40.360 --> 3:07:42.360]  and increases the oxygen content
[3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:44.360]  of your body
[3:07:44.360 --> 3:07:46.360]  disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[3:07:46.360 --> 3:07:48.360]  cannot survive in an alkaline environment
[3:07:48.360 --> 3:07:50.360]  normal pH balance
[3:07:50.360 --> 3:07:52.360]  increases in your body
[3:07:52.360 --> 3:08:13.680]  or
[3:08:13.680 --> 3:08:15.040]  you haven't changed much
[3:08:15.040 --> 3:08:17.000]  it continues to fish under a huge sun
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:23.800]  up at the bottom of the hour. Professor Peterdell Scott is our guest, author, researcher, just
[3:08:23.800 --> 3:08:29.040]  an amazing individual. Peter, you've got such an interesting bio and you've wrote seminal
[3:08:29.040 --> 3:08:35.400]  works exposing government, narcotics trafficking, how these operation works. I don't even know
[3:08:35.400 --> 3:08:41.320]  where to start with you, but he's a Canadian poet and former English professor, University
[3:08:41.320 --> 3:08:46.120]  of California Berkeley, the son of noted Canadian poet and constitutional lawyer, F.R. Scott.
[3:08:46.120 --> 3:08:49.720]  He is known for his anti-war stance and his criticism of U.S. foreign policy dating back
[3:08:49.720 --> 3:08:53.440]  to Vietnam War. He's researched and written several investigative books about the role
[3:08:53.440 --> 3:08:58.160]  of deep state as opposed to the public state or I'd call shadow government. However, Scott
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:02.240]  rejects the label of conspiracy theory and has used the phrase deep politics to describe
[3:09:02.240 --> 3:09:07.600]  his heavily footnoted political writing. The investigative bent has spilt over into his
[3:09:07.600 --> 3:09:13.640]  works of poetry, some of which must contain marginal notes to explain to readers which
[3:09:13.640 --> 3:09:18.440]  documents or real world news events are being referred to as most recent book, The Road to
[3:09:18.440 --> 3:09:22.680]  9-11 from the University of California Press to Tales with historical and geopolitical
[3:09:22.680 --> 3:09:30.080]  context, the events of 9-11, and it goes on from this. Professor Peterdell Scott, good
[3:09:30.080 --> 3:09:33.720]  to have you here with us today. I want to get your view on Obama, the people behind
[3:09:33.720 --> 3:09:37.960]  him, the overarching banking structure, what is at the heart from your research of the
[3:09:37.960 --> 3:09:42.880]  deep state and what Carol quickly wrote about at Georgetown. Then I want to get into kind
[3:09:42.880 --> 3:09:47.280]  of a left-wing management groups that manage the left and how they control the anti-war
[3:09:47.280 --> 3:09:51.480]  movement and then some of the right-wing control groups as well and how they kind of have
[3:09:51.480 --> 3:09:53.720]  that synthesis. It's good to have you here with us.
[3:09:53.720 --> 3:09:59.600]  I'm glad you're back on the show. You've given me a tall agenda there to deal with
[3:09:59.600 --> 3:10:07.880]  in one hour, but yes, I think that people are probably more aware now than they were
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:14.320]  a couple of years ago, just how little wiggle room there is in American politics that we
[3:10:14.320 --> 3:10:20.680]  had a huge bailout for the banks under when Bush was president. Now we have a new president
[3:10:20.680 --> 3:10:25.760]  and we have another huge bailout that looks remarkably like the first one, which seems
[3:10:25.760 --> 3:10:33.560]  to validate what Gordy Dall said once, that we have only one political party in this country,
[3:10:33.560 --> 3:10:39.080]  the property party with two right-wings. Both parties, I think, are very indebted to
[3:10:39.080 --> 3:10:44.720]  the money that gets them elected and that money comes from the same sources for both
[3:10:44.720 --> 3:10:51.840]  parties, the big oil companies, the big banks, what's now called the Petroleum Financial
[3:10:51.840 --> 3:10:59.200]  Military Complex that has really been taxing this country for its own ends since World
[3:10:59.200 --> 3:11:09.440]  War II. Please continue. Well, when we talk about one party with
[3:11:09.440 --> 3:11:16.840]  two right-wings, for a long time, people thought with some truth that the Council on Foreign
[3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:24.640]  Relations in New York, representing Wall Street banks and law firms, was the real power in
[3:11:24.640 --> 3:11:31.640]  determining U.S. foreign policy. As evidence for that, you could point to the fact that
[3:11:31.640 --> 3:11:39.000]  it was really they who pushed Truman into creating a CIA, which back in 1947, which
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:48.440]  was then populated at the top, I think of the seven known deputy directors of the CIA
[3:11:48.440 --> 3:11:56.360]  in its first two years. All but one were from Wall Street banks and firms, and in addition
[3:11:56.360 --> 3:12:03.000]  to that, they were also all, one of those, were from the New York social register, the
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:12.680]  kind of high society that represented the real wealth of New York. Now, the CFR doesn't
[3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:17.560]  have the power now that it used to have them, and that's largely because of the Reagan
[3:12:17.560 --> 3:12:23.560]  Revolution. And what I say in my book is a real power grab that happened really under
[3:12:23.560 --> 3:12:31.720]  Ford in 1975, when Cheney and Rumsfeld, two names that were being very powerful in American
[3:12:31.720 --> 3:12:36.120]  politics from the time that they were both in Ford's White House.
[3:12:36.120 --> 3:12:40.000]  That's right. They were there when the National Security Dictatorship said they're continuity
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:43.840]  of government. This is our chance to take over, and we saw them pretty much try to repeat
[3:12:43.840 --> 3:12:50.160]  that under Bush, didn't we? Yeah, well, they planned for the whole continuity
[3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:56.720]  of government. It's not surprising they were doing it under Reagan, but it was a little
[3:12:56.720 --> 3:13:00.920]  surprising because Rumsfeld wasn't in the government, but he still was empowered by
[3:13:00.920 --> 3:13:08.480]  a secret Reagan executive order to plan essentially for a suspension of the Constitution. It's
[3:13:08.480 --> 3:13:14.120]  really remarkable. The two of them kept on planning right through the 90s, and in the
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:19.800]  second half of the 90s, neither Cheney nor Rumsfeld was in the government, and you had
[3:13:19.800 --> 3:13:24.680]  a Democratic president who, according to Andrew Coburn, didn't have only the vaguest idea
[3:13:24.680 --> 3:13:29.480]  of what was going on. They were planning for all these big changes we've seen since
[3:13:29.480 --> 3:13:37.480]  9-11, and neither of them was in the government, and this was all empowered by a Reagan executive
[3:13:37.480 --> 3:13:44.760]  order back in 1981. So there is a good way of seeing how what's going on on the surface
[3:13:44.760 --> 3:13:53.920]  is really being subordinated to other forces not visible that have only the flimsiest of
[3:13:53.920 --> 3:14:00.640]  constitutional authorizations that trump the Constitution, because we've seen the suspension
[3:14:00.640 --> 3:14:07.200]  of habeas corpus, we've seen the preparations for martial law in a very big way, and all
[3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:14.200]  of these major, major changes were not debated through Congress or even through the normal
[3:14:14.200 --> 3:14:20.920]  executive. It was done by what you like to call a shadow government, a special committee
[3:14:20.920 --> 3:14:26.200]  that was secretly authorized by Reagan back in 1981.
[3:14:26.200 --> 3:14:31.720]  Sure. Do you want me to go on a bit more?
[3:14:31.720 --> 3:14:36.960]  Yeah, continue, because now the deep state is openly becoming the entire state. It looks
[3:14:36.960 --> 3:14:42.760]  like Obama's lockstep with PDD-51, John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the announcement
[3:14:42.760 --> 3:14:48.200]  of 20,000 battle-hardened troops on the streets of America, suddenly Marines are at DWI checkpoints,
[3:14:48.200 --> 3:14:55.240]  we're putting liaison officers into the police departments, and Congress isn't allowed to
[3:14:55.240 --> 3:14:59.680]  see PDD-51, though the cover sheet basically says the president's a dictator, and now,
[3:14:59.680 --> 3:15:04.520]  I wanted to get your take on a few weeks ago, the John U-Memos come out, one good thing
[3:15:04.520 --> 3:15:08.680]  that President Obama's done, and it says what we already knew, they wanted to get rid of
[3:15:08.680 --> 3:15:13.240]  free speech, they said the president's basically a dictator, and that that's constitutional.
[3:15:13.240 --> 3:15:14.240]  Go ahead.
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:23.000]  Yes. Well, you know, there's a bunch of, I'm not alone in being upset about constitutional,
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:30.200]  what they call continuity of government, COG, which I insist we should call change of government.
[3:15:30.200 --> 3:15:37.120]  We are in, still, in a state of emergency, which was declared officially three days after
[3:15:37.120 --> 3:15:44.560]  9-11. There is actually a statute that requires Congress to review every proclamation of an
[3:15:44.560 --> 3:15:51.160]  emergency within six months, and to decide whether to allow it to stand or to get rid
[3:15:51.160 --> 3:15:57.680]  of it. And for about two years now, I've been appealing to the Democrats in Congress
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:05.560]  to do their statutory requirement and conduct that review. And since Obama was elected,
[3:16:05.560 --> 3:16:11.840]  Dan Hamburg is a former congressman, and I have written to the Obama White House, and
[3:16:11.840 --> 3:16:17.880]  we've written to Nancy Pelosi, and we've used all the back channels that we know of,
[3:16:17.880 --> 3:16:22.720]  which are not very many in my case. I have written to somebody who speaks to Dennis
[3:16:22.720 --> 3:16:30.160]  Kucinich, and all these people do what the law says you have to do and look at the state
[3:16:30.160 --> 3:16:36.600]  of emergency, and either publicly affirm it or get rid of it. In that case, that would
[3:16:36.600 --> 3:16:44.720]  sweep away the foundation for all these secret memos, which Congress ought to be able to
[3:16:44.720 --> 3:16:46.440]  see, but hasn't been allowed to look at.
[3:16:46.440 --> 3:16:51.120]  Let me bring a microcosm up of that. The Delta Force has been operating really since
[3:16:51.120 --> 3:16:58.740]  the 60s, but they publicly founded it in 1980 in December. And we heard this week from
[3:16:58.740 --> 3:17:04.560]  Sy Hirsch and MSNBC with Overman, a secret death squad operating in the U.S. spying but
[3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:09.840]  killing people overseas, outside the CIA's control. And then it mentioned it was the
[3:17:09.840 --> 3:17:14.800]  Delta Force. Well, Obama's continuing that. It was going on before Bush. By making it
[3:17:14.800 --> 3:17:18.320]  just about Bush, people think, oh, this is all over, but that's the...
[3:17:18.320 --> 3:17:25.280]  It's older than Bush, and we still have it. It's JSOC. And I've been around for a while,
[3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:30.960]  so I remember... I actually went to Washington to investigate these things, worked for a
[3:17:30.960 --> 3:17:38.280]  think tank in 1987, and we were very considered about this Joint Special Operations Command,
[3:17:38.280 --> 3:17:45.880]  which the Delta Force is under. That was set up in the 1980s, and they were doing all kinds
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:53.880]  of shady things then. And I was particularly trying to pin down the rumors that we kept
[3:17:53.880 --> 3:17:58.640]  hearing over and over that this had to do with the flow of drugs into the country, which
[3:17:58.640 --> 3:18:06.920]  was a tremendous problem then and still is. It was really acute then. We had the cocaine
[3:18:06.920 --> 3:18:13.000]  epidemics, we turned into the crack epidemic, and it was so much of it was as a result of
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:21.040]  what the CIA was doing. It's now official that in the first year that the CIA started
[3:18:21.040 --> 3:18:31.120]  operations in Afghanistan back in 1980, within months, certainly within that year, we went
[3:18:31.120 --> 3:18:35.760]  from virtually no heroin coming from that part of the world to the United States to
[3:18:35.760 --> 3:18:42.980]  40 percent of our heroin coming from that part of the world to the United States. Now,
[3:18:42.980 --> 3:18:52.240]  and it's very striking right now that we can't get the people who are in Afghanistan to target
[3:18:52.240 --> 3:19:02.840]  the big drug lords. Drug refineries, they process the heroin right there in Afghanistan, and
[3:19:02.840 --> 3:19:03.840]  the-
[3:19:03.840 --> 3:19:10.240]  Well, Mr. Scott, I was listening to BBC on XM in my car this weekend driving home, and
[3:19:10.240 --> 3:19:15.440]  they had a whole report admitting that the U.S. basically guards the drugs, and it was
[3:19:15.440 --> 3:19:19.520]  these different military commands putting orders out to leave them alone because that
[3:19:19.520 --> 3:19:24.800]  brings tranquility, and we've seen this almost 1,000 percent increase in heroin pouring out
[3:19:24.800 --> 3:19:30.000]  since the liberation of Afghanistan in 2001, 2002. So this is an open secret. I mean, it
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:33.840]  was on BBC, but they were saying they were doing it for our good though.
[3:19:33.840 --> 3:19:39.000]  The British and the Americans see it differently because most of that heroin is going to Europe
[3:19:39.000 --> 3:19:40.560]  and to Britain.
[3:19:40.560 --> 3:19:45.560]  Yeah, stay there. Let's continue with the deep state, Obama, who's behind him, and then
[3:19:45.560 --> 3:19:51.040]  let's get into some of the groups that you write about and talk about, because specifically
[3:19:51.040 --> 3:19:54.440]  I've had listeners ask me about this, that are controlling right wing groups and left
[3:19:54.440 --> 3:19:59.960]  wing groups. So some more of the structure of the shadow government. Stay with us, Peter
[3:19:59.960 --> 3:20:01.280]  Dell-Scott's our guest.
[3:20:01.280 --> 3:20:05.840]  Hello, this is Steve Shank. Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food, but
[3:20:05.840 --> 3:20:09.920]  Alex and I decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[3:20:09.920 --> 3:20:14.400]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods direct. If you agree with
[3:20:14.400 --> 3:20:20.000]  one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the earth is
[3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:24.280]  cooling, don't call eFoods direct. If you think growing food for cars is better than
[3:20:24.280 --> 3:20:28.320]  feeding people, don't get food. If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime
[3:20:28.320 --> 3:20:32.600]  is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods direct. If you
[3:20:32.600 --> 3:20:37.240]  believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food. If you think the warnings on the
[3:20:37.240 --> 3:20:43.200]  Alex Jones show are foolish, don't call eFoods direct. For the rest of you, go to eFoodsDirect.com

[3:21:02.280 --> 3:21:08.440]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[3:21:08.440 --> 3:21:13.160]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[3:21:13.160 --> 3:21:18.600]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[3:21:18.600 --> 3:21:23.480]  the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, fudged since
[3:21:23.480 --> 3:21:28.600]  day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[3:21:28.600 --> 3:21:35.480]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:21:35.480 --> 3:21:38.400]  that's fascism.
[3:21:38.400 --> 3:21:43.120]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents
[3:21:43.120 --> 3:21:50.080]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama

[3:22:32.560 --> 3:22:37.480]  fiat currency in the history of mankind. Gold has held its purchasing power for over
[3:22:37.480 --> 3:22:46.320]  6,000 years. Contact me, Peter Crouch novel, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 108. Once again,

[3:24:11.200 --> 3:24:16.920]  In 1814, we took a little trip along the Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi. We took
[3:24:16.920 --> 3:24:20.920]  a little bacon and we took the little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town
[3:24:20.920 --> 3:24:24.800]  in New Orleans. We fired our guns and the British kept coming.
[3:24:24.800 --> 3:24:29.000]  We are back live. Professor Peter L. Scott, author, researcher, is our guest. This is
[3:24:29.000 --> 3:24:33.080]  a short segment. Peter, from your deep research, let's just cut right off the chase. I mean,
[3:24:33.080 --> 3:24:38.200]  obviously, Carol Quigley in the documents and, you know, it's a global banking cartel,
[3:24:38.200 --> 3:24:42.720]  rules things. Let's get your view on that, your info on that. And then, who are their
[3:24:42.720 --> 3:24:47.720]  minion groups? How are they controlling the Democratic and Republican parties in this
[3:24:47.720 --> 3:24:51.600]  country? And, you know, what are some of the subgroups?
[3:24:51.600 --> 3:24:58.200]  Well, let me begin with a quote from Franklin Roosevelt back in 1933, which I believe is
[3:24:58.200 --> 3:25:04.160]  still true and very visibly demonstrated in the last six months with the bailouts.
[3:25:04.160 --> 3:25:09.880]  This was a private letter of Roosevelt to a close friend, Colonel House, and he said,
[3:25:09.880 --> 3:25:18.240]  the real truth is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers
[3:25:18.240 --> 3:25:23.480]  has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson. Now, you know, I used to
[3:25:23.480 --> 3:25:27.840]  teach political science and we never taught this and I left political science because
[3:25:27.840 --> 3:25:33.560]  they don't address this fundamental fact. So, you know, Marxist would say, ah, yet there's
[3:25:33.560 --> 3:25:42.000]  a ruling class, but I think the Marxists don't understand it properly either because he said
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:50.280]  in the larger centers, New York, of course, was the dominant center and still is to some
[3:25:50.280 --> 3:25:55.320]  extent. And that's why I was talking about the Council on Foreign Relations before, but
[3:25:55.320 --> 3:26:02.000]  we've seen a lot of new wealth come up in Houston and Dallas and Los Angeles. And in
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  1980, there was the creation of a group which was consciously designed to combat the influence
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:19.160]  of the CFR and that's called the Council for National Policy. They resented the connections
[3:26:19.160 --> 3:26:25.800]  of the banks in New York to the international global financial network and they wanted one
[3:26:25.800 --> 3:26:34.600]  which would be more nationalistic in its approaches. And they've got the people who financed that
[3:26:34.600 --> 3:26:40.660]  creation of the CNPs, we call it as opposed to the CFR, are people like Richard Mellon
[3:26:40.660 --> 3:26:46.800]  Stathes who simultaneously financed the moral majority. The moral majority was not a grassroots
[3:26:46.800 --> 3:26:53.920]  organization. It was very much a top-down organization funded by Paul Warrish and by
[3:26:53.920 --> 3:26:58.920]  Richard Mellon Stathes, which really meant that the Mooneys were putting money into
[3:26:58.920 --> 3:27:03.760]  not a totally American institution. It had its own international connections.
[3:27:03.760 --> 3:27:08.880]  But have you studied the Hunt Brothers and the rest of them financing all of that and
[3:27:08.880 --> 3:27:14.400]  then even putting out a lot of anti-CFR stuff? I see it more of the CFR, which was British
[3:27:14.400 --> 3:27:19.640]  Intelligence 1922 founded, you know, to control New York and to bring us into the New World
[3:27:19.640 --> 3:27:25.040]  Order, that that's their way to co-op conservative movements and control it. I mean, are you
[3:27:25.040 --> 3:27:29.600]  saying the Mooneys and groups like this are at the top because we see the international
[3:27:29.600 --> 3:27:35.420]  bankers openly taking everything over right now and I just see liberal control arms, Ford
[3:27:35.420 --> 3:27:39.600]  Foundation over the Liberals and Rockefeller Foundation and others and then the group you're
[3:27:39.600 --> 3:27:43.960]  talking about and some others that are, you know, trying to control and influence what
[3:27:43.960 --> 3:27:49.720]  would be seen as the right wing? Well, you know, we live in an imperfect world.
[3:27:49.720 --> 3:27:57.800]  By the way, when I listened to all those anti-Obama ads, I think we have to see what Obama's
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:28:02.800]  going to do because, you know, in 1932 when Roosevelt was elected, a lot of people would
[3:28:02.800 --> 3:28:09.840]  have said, there's the New York ruling class flirting themselves again, but then Roosevelt,
[3:28:09.840 --> 3:28:15.920]  although there was a limit to what he could do, certainly did enough to mildly offend
[3:28:15.920 --> 3:28:19.680]  the financial elements. Yeah, we do know that fascist interest in
[3:28:19.680 --> 3:28:23.200]  the McCormick-Dickstein committees covered this, tried to overthrow him and Spendley
[3:28:23.200 --> 3:28:26.800]  Butler blew the whistle, so that does show there's infighting.
[3:28:26.800 --> 3:28:32.560]  Spendley Butler, exactly, and those were, you know, DuPonts and Morgan people behind
[3:28:32.560 --> 3:28:38.080]  Spendley Butler. I wonder if everybody in this audience knows that there was an attempt
[3:28:38.080 --> 3:28:44.320]  to mount a military coup in 1935. It didn't go anywhere. This is a much healthier country
[3:28:44.320 --> 3:28:49.680]  actually than one might think when just by reading the headlines right now, we have some
[3:28:49.680 --> 3:28:56.280]  very major problems, but I'm prepared to wait and see what Obama's going to do, but
[3:28:56.280 --> 3:29:02.080]  there's also, I'm quite certain in my own mind, that Obama got where he got because
[3:29:02.080 --> 3:29:08.000]  some of the money elements in America backed him from the very beginning, and I think we
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:14.880]  can talk specifically about the Pritzker family. I've written about, if you go to my website,
[3:29:14.880 --> 3:29:21.520]  www.peterdalescot.net, I have some rather nasty things to say about the Pritzker's,
[3:29:21.520 --> 3:29:27.280]  and yet there was Penny Pritzker, who was the treasurer of the Obama campaign until
[3:29:27.280 --> 3:29:35.120]  her connection to the subprime lending scandal forced her to resign. We have something that
[3:29:35.120 --> 3:29:38.800]  can look good or look bad depending on what you choose to do. Okay, Peter Del Scot, stay
[3:29:38.800 --> 3:29:42.800]  there. I want to come back and get into more of these right-wing control grips. You say
[3:29:42.800 --> 3:29:48.880]  you're vying for power against the CFR interlateral commission, so we'll get your analysis on
[3:29:48.880 --> 3:29:54.880]  that and take calls. Coming up, Peter Del Scot. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.760 --> 3:29:58.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:58.560 --> 3:30:06.880]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have
[3:30:06.880 --> 3:30:11.440]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's
[3:30:11.440 --> 3:30:16.240]  because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:30:16.240 --> 3:30:21.440]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce
[3:30:21.440 --> 3:30:27.760]  chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[3:30:27.760 --> 3:30:32.800]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever
[3:30:32.800 --> 3:30:37.360]  comes first. Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce
[3:30:37.360 --> 3:30:42.880]  chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally

[3:31:06.880 --> 3:31:12.960]  the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as
[3:31:12.960 --> 3:31:19.760]  strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[3:31:19.760 --> 3:31:25.280]  for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day
[3:31:25.280 --> 3:31:30.080]  one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[3:31:30.080 --> 3:31:36.960]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's
[3:31:36.960 --> 3:31:42.880]  fascism. It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government. This film documents
[3:31:42.880 --> 3:31:50.400]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception

[3:31:58.320 --> 3:32:04.560]  the people strike back. There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a
[3:32:04.560 --> 3:32:09.840]  lower incidence of cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[3:32:09.840 --> 3:32:15.280]  Neutriadine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal
[3:32:15.280 --> 3:32:20.720]  balance and can assist in detoxification from fluoride, bromide, and chloride toxins,
[3:32:20.720 --> 3:32:25.920]  and helps provide protection from radioactive iodine from nuclear fallout. Neutriadine is made
[3:32:25.920 --> 3:32:31.120]  with a proprietary high energy field from pure crystalline iodine. Neutriadine should be used
[3:32:31.120 --> 3:32:36.880]  by all ages every day. If you suffer from chronic fatigue, low thyroid, and mitochondria function,
[3:32:36.880 --> 3:32:41.600]  or if you just want to feel better from day to day, Neutriadine drops are for you. There are
[3:32:41.600 --> 3:32:46.560]  several forms of iodine. Neutriadine is the only trusted source available now by calling

[3:33:07.600 --> 3:33:12.480]  Okay, Professor Peter Del Scott, researcher on what he calls the deep state, continue. You were
[3:33:12.480 --> 3:33:19.680]  getting into CFR, CMP, different management systems for the shadow government. Please continue.
[3:33:19.680 --> 3:33:25.600]  Well, first of all, that kind of split would be there with or without the CFR and the CMP.
[3:33:27.280 --> 3:33:33.920]  You go back before the war, you were in the days of the National Association of Manufacturers.
[3:33:33.920 --> 3:33:39.520]  They represented what you might call homegrown industry that was not interested in exports,
[3:33:39.520 --> 3:33:46.640]  was interested in the local economy, and was very mistrustful of the banking connections
[3:33:46.640 --> 3:33:52.800]  in New York. It's out of the NAM, the National Association of Manufacturers, that you got the
[3:33:52.800 --> 3:34:00.400]  John Birch Society, which was, you know, it was always depicted in what you might call the CFR
[3:34:00.400 --> 3:34:06.400]  controlled big media as being a kooky organization, but they were powerful because they had roots
[3:34:06.400 --> 3:34:12.720]  not just in what was left of the NAM, but also in the military. They were at quite a high level
[3:34:12.720 --> 3:34:18.960]  in the military, people like General Walker and so on. We're indoctrinating their troops with
[3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:26.160]  John Birch material, and we have the legacy of that today. That tradition is what produced
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:32.720]  the CMP, the Council on National Policy in Dallas in 1980. You mentioned yourself,
[3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:39.680]  the Hunts, Nelson Bunker, let's take the current generation where they're dying off now, that
[3:34:39.680 --> 3:34:50.640]  Nelson Bunker had financed the John Birch Society, had paid for the ad that attacked Kennedy on the
[3:34:50.640 --> 3:34:58.000]  day he came to Dallas in 1963, that fateful day, and he was one of the big sources of money for
[3:34:58.640 --> 3:35:04.320]  the Council on National Policy. In other words, Richard Melonscape, who's a grandson of Andrew
[3:35:04.320 --> 3:35:11.920]  Melon, the very wealthy, the Melons were extremely wealthy from Gulf oil, but they also controlled
[3:35:11.920 --> 3:35:21.920]  Alcoa and the Bank. You have these different powerful groups so that you can't just, and this
[3:35:21.920 --> 3:35:26.640]  is where I disagree with John Chomsky, for example, he thinks that America is a great big system
[3:35:27.200 --> 3:35:32.960]  devoted to exploiting the rest of the world. I see Washington as being a cockpit between
[3:35:32.960 --> 3:35:39.920]  competing interests and the original. He used the United States as an engine for their operations.
[3:35:39.920 --> 3:35:44.480]  Globally, we were already incredibly wealthy before these elites take over. They always act like
[3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:49.760]  America stole everything it's got. No, really, we've seen our, in my opinion, long decline since
[3:35:49.760 --> 3:35:55.360]  we became an empire. Do you agree with that statement? I can't assess it. I mean, there are
[3:35:55.360 --> 3:36:03.760]  visible sources of decline. Well, I mean, let's assess this, but okay, go ahead. Well, I'll just say,
[3:36:03.760 --> 3:36:10.560]  a little earlier, we've been living on a priority currency ever since the Nixon went off the gold
[3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:17.280]  standard, but I think that's where there's an argument, and it would be a CNP argument,
[3:36:17.280 --> 3:36:23.520]  for maintaining a very strong military, because strong men maintain a very strong military.
[3:36:23.520 --> 3:36:33.360]  People are nervous about challenging the use of the American currency as the currency that oil
[3:36:33.360 --> 3:36:38.480]  deals. I understand all that. You know, my whole issue is that people call in and ask me,
[3:36:38.480 --> 3:36:43.440]  you know what the CNP is, and I've heard of it. I know it's a bunch of kind of fake right wingers
[3:36:43.440 --> 3:36:46.640]  that meet and have these dinners and things, and I know there's a lot of... Well, I think they're
[3:36:46.640 --> 3:36:53.120]  fake. I think, you know, if they're fake, who are the real right wingers? Well, I mean, I'm
[3:36:53.120 --> 3:36:59.840]  past this whole left-right thing. I see things as tyranny or liberty, and my whole issue with this
[3:36:59.840 --> 3:37:04.960]  is, I see the list of people that are involved in this group, and I see them also involved in a lot
[3:37:04.960 --> 3:37:10.000]  of the other major groups, and it's clear the international banking cartel is the top of the
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:15.760]  pyramid, and I know that the Hunts and people, because I remember reading stuff on the UT website,
[3:37:15.760 --> 3:37:21.680]  there was several chairs, for those that don't know, it's like a research body funded by them,
[3:37:21.680 --> 3:37:26.080]  putting out stuff when I was researching all this, you know, that was like anti-New World Order,
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:31.360]  so I know that's going on, but then I see them always going along with, you know,
[3:37:31.360 --> 3:37:35.760]  massing power, because even if there are different factions, they all want more power.
[3:37:36.560 --> 3:37:45.920]  I just read some of your... My take on that is, Alex, and you know, I mean, part of me thinks the
[3:37:45.920 --> 3:37:53.200]  way you do, but part of me thinks that in order to be visible in this struggle, you have to be
[3:37:53.200 --> 3:37:59.600]  powerful, and in order to be powerful, you have to have connections to the wealthy in this country,
[3:37:59.600 --> 3:38:06.480]  and once you start developing those connections, you start becoming co-opted into this whole system
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:11.920]  whereby wealth controls the politics of the country. So a true liberty party, you know,
[3:38:11.920 --> 3:38:16.560]  we've had some real libertarians in this country, like Murray Rospart and so on,
[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:22.560]  but most people never heard of them because they... And even he had wealthy connections.
[3:38:23.440 --> 3:38:31.600]  Somebody like me, I swear to God, I don't have any connection to wealth. I also have no visibility
[3:38:31.600 --> 3:38:39.360]  in this country except on your show, because to be visible in this country, you somehow have to
[3:38:39.360 --> 3:38:45.360]  fit into this system whether you're at the CFR side of it on the left. But the internet is changing
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:51.680]  that. That's why we exist, but I'm trying to understand, because I really respect your research,
[3:38:51.680 --> 3:38:56.400]  you know, you're absolutely right about, you know, the Delta Force and the command above it.
[3:38:58.160 --> 3:39:02.880]  Everything I read from you, about 98% of it is stuff I already discovered on my own,
[3:39:02.880 --> 3:39:07.920]  and then you take it at many times a level deeper, and then I research it and find out your
[3:39:07.920 --> 3:39:15.440]  accurate. So I really respect you, and I'm trying to learn your perspective on this. My whole issue
[3:39:15.440 --> 3:39:25.280]  is that, you know, if things like the C&P are so powerful, then why did George Bush, who I guess
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:30.080]  some would say was involved with this, why would he triple the size of government? I mean,
[3:39:30.080 --> 3:39:34.800]  if these guys are so powerful, why are they wrecking the country if they really are these
[3:39:34.800 --> 3:39:39.520]  hardcore right-wingers that are pro-America? I mean, I'm trying to... Okay, let me just address
[3:39:39.520 --> 3:39:48.400]  that. The Hunt brother that George W. Bush is close to is the Ray Hunt, who doesn't really
[3:39:48.400 --> 3:39:54.240]  share the politics of his two brothers. They're half brothers, by the way. He's the son from a
[3:39:54.240 --> 3:40:00.800]  later marriage, and I would not classify Ray Hunt as being C&P. I would classify him as being
[3:40:00.800 --> 3:40:12.400]  Texas mega-rich, the Sunbelt faction in the ruling class. George W. Bush, I think, is mostly
[3:40:12.400 --> 3:40:19.040]  indebted to... People should, if they're interested in this, get my friend Russ Baker's book,
[3:40:19.040 --> 3:40:26.800]  Family of Secrets, and he goes at great lengths into who funded George W. Bush's little oil
[3:40:26.800 --> 3:40:31.600]  company, our boost store. Is it grew and grew and grew? But isn't that at CIA connected,
[3:40:31.600 --> 3:40:35.920]  and then Scullin' Bones, I thought, is Bush's main power? Well, yeah, but you know, there's
[3:40:35.920 --> 3:40:40.400]  a lot of Texas scullin' bones. No, I know. I'm not... So, I mean, you really... Are you saying you
[3:40:40.400 --> 3:40:48.320]  believe that the C&P thing is the top of the pyramid? No. Actually, I don't think it's a pyramid.
[3:40:48.320 --> 3:40:53.920]  Let's start there. I think these things go up into a kind of... Bipolar...
[3:40:53.920 --> 3:41:02.800]  Bipolar area where there is so much infighting going on that nobody's at the top. And specifically,
[3:41:02.800 --> 3:41:08.560]  Alex, I think one of the places you and I disagree most is that we both think this is a
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:16.720]  basically healthy country, but where we differ is that you try to localize the source of the evil
[3:41:16.720 --> 3:41:23.280]  in the international bankers and something outside the country. I don't think... I think that the
[3:41:23.280 --> 3:41:29.440]  international banking system, as it's called, that we now have was first of all the creation of Britain,
[3:41:29.440 --> 3:41:36.320]  and then after that, of the United States, the hard core of the international banking system...
[3:41:36.320 --> 3:41:41.680]  Is the U.S. and England, Anglo-American? London, London, and New York, and we cannot
[3:41:41.680 --> 3:41:46.320]  blame everything that's wrong. Peter, Peter, you don't... No, no, you misunderstand my position.
[3:41:47.040 --> 3:41:51.520]  I mean, I go off their own... I agree. It's the Anglo-American establishment. The United States
[3:41:51.520 --> 3:41:56.560]  and England are the international banking cartel or the dominant force, but it's allied with some
[3:41:56.560 --> 3:42:03.120]  European factions, so I'm not disagreeing with you there. Well, how about the moral tone of it?
[3:42:03.120 --> 3:42:10.480]  Because I don't see them as being inherently evil. For example, you know, I hate war. I've spent my
[3:42:10.480 --> 3:42:18.240]  life fighting the wars that have happened in my adulthood, but when the Anglo-American establishment
[3:42:18.240 --> 3:42:23.520]  united to stop Hitler, I think that was probably a good thing. I mean... What about the Milner...
[3:42:23.520 --> 3:42:27.840]  What about the Milner Group wanting to fund a fascist movement in Germany to counterbalance
[3:42:28.720 --> 3:42:34.000]  the Communist move, and then you have here in the U.S. all the big... And that goes back
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:39.120]  to the right-wing faction trying to fund Hitler and him funding them here, so again, we come back.
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:45.440]  These are splits which separated John Foster Dulles from his brother Allen Dulles. Sure,
[3:42:45.440 --> 3:42:50.880]  I'm not saying it's a... Look, look, it's just like in The Godfather, you know, that's a composite
[3:42:50.880 --> 3:42:55.200]  of three stories where you've got the 12 families meeting around the table and they kill each other
[3:42:55.200 --> 3:42:59.360]  and they fight over turf, but they don't go out and blow the whistle on their rackets to the general
[3:42:59.360 --> 3:43:05.200]  public. So obviously, it's not one, you know, everything perfectly scientifically oiled together.
[3:43:05.200 --> 3:43:08.640]  It's these big corrupt elites and their think tanks and their systems of control and their
[3:43:08.640 --> 3:43:14.880]  propaganda arms just expanding power and destroying the middle class and impoverishing the planet.
[3:43:14.880 --> 3:43:20.480]  I mean, it's like, you know, Mexico's one elite, but it works with the U.S. elite. I mean, so that's
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:27.840]  what I believe. Well, let's talk a bit about Mexico, because now you have essentially a dozen
[3:43:27.840 --> 3:43:35.520]  or so super-rich people, many of whom have got rich on the drug traffic, and they really do work
[3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:42.000]  as a unit and meet together to pool their money to back a candidate to the next president.
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:48.240]  That's not my model for America. I think that there is more confusion than that in America,
[3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:54.320]  and that's why we, you know, let's face it, we have a healthier political society in America than
[3:43:54.320 --> 3:43:58.960]  you have in Mexico. And that goes back to the separation of powers that the founders set up
[3:43:58.960 --> 3:44:05.040]  to tie down dominant men. Here, here. And that is very threatened right now. That is what I've
[3:44:06.240 --> 3:44:11.200]  on my website. I mean, doing these various things to see, see, and you know, where you brought
[3:44:11.200 --> 3:44:18.720]  up the John U. memos and so on. I think to get to restoration of real separation of powers and
[3:44:19.680 --> 3:44:26.240]  restoration of constitutional primacy over everything else, we have to undo this idea that
[3:44:26.240 --> 3:44:35.120]  we're at war against, you know, terrorists who are as powerful as we are. Our constitution is our
[3:44:35.120 --> 3:44:41.200]  best defense. And somehow we've got to get the Congress to reassert its primacy and to reassert
[3:44:41.200 --> 3:44:47.680]  their rights and to end this state of emergency. What is it? They're required by law to examine
[3:44:47.680 --> 3:44:52.800]  this thing. And you know, hey, hey, they had, as you know, sir, they had emergencies before 9 11.
[3:44:52.800 --> 3:44:58.400]  I have been watching C span live. My dad called me one morning. He saw it to a separate year and
[3:44:58.400 --> 3:45:03.440]  they go, uh, you know, madam speaker speaker, I have a message from the president of the United
[3:45:03.440 --> 3:45:07.200]  States and he brings in the message of the emergency and then they pass it through or
[3:45:07.200 --> 3:45:10.880]  they agree to it. So you're right. We've been living under the state of emergency for a long
[3:45:10.880 --> 3:45:16.160]  time and we've got a, you know, I may be wrong on this because I haven't really researched it,
[3:45:16.160 --> 3:45:23.360]  but I was going to write about that. And then someone assured me that the state of emergency
[3:45:23.360 --> 3:45:29.280]  in the Congress means a special way of dealing with the bailout. For example, they were under a
[3:45:29.280 --> 3:45:35.520]  state of emergency discussing the bailout, but that's just within Congress. That's not the national
[3:45:35.520 --> 3:45:40.800]  state of emergency that we've had since, uh, no, I've seen them bring it in. No, no, I understand
[3:45:40.800 --> 3:45:45.200]  separately. They call it martial law in Congress when some of the rules are suspended. I mean,
[3:45:45.200 --> 3:45:49.280]  there's a lot of different systems, but then separately, we're getting martial law in this
[3:45:49.280 --> 3:45:55.360]  country and very elaborate preparations for it. And it's not just this country because Canada's
[3:45:55.360 --> 3:46:01.920]  army now is pretty well melded into the American one. And they, Canada is also, uh, we never had
[3:46:01.920 --> 3:46:08.480]  a policy comment tattoo fact in Canada, but we do have a tradition of doing things through parliament.
[3:46:08.480 --> 3:46:13.680]  Well, Peter, briefly, briefly, sure, sure. And I keep it rubbing as we have limited time here.
[3:46:13.680 --> 3:46:16.240]  I'm going to have to have you back up. We'll do it maybe for a couple hours or really break
[3:46:16.240 --> 3:46:20.400]  all this down specifically because I've had listeners ask me about it. I know some about
[3:46:20.400 --> 3:46:27.680]  the CNP. Tell me who's in that now and what it's doing. Oh, my, you know, I'm an old man.
[3:46:28.400 --> 3:46:33.360]  I can tell you who was in it at the beginning. It was the Korean family. It was the Richard
[3:46:33.360 --> 3:46:39.840]  Mellon scape. It was, um, there is a website, you know, if people have a computer, they can
[3:46:39.840 --> 3:46:48.560]  Google and Google for a council on national policy and you'll get a very big, uh, website
[3:46:48.560 --> 3:46:53.520]  that gives you all the members that are known. It's, but by the way, it's very secret. Uh,
[3:46:53.520 --> 3:46:59.200]  then, uh, they, they don't publish any of their findings as opposed to the council on foreign
[3:46:59.200 --> 3:47:06.320]  relations, which runs, has a magazine, foreign affairs and is always publishing papers on this
[3:47:06.320 --> 3:47:12.640]  and that. This other thing is they talk among themselves and we can only guess, but outsiders
[3:47:12.640 --> 3:47:19.520]  are being able to reconstitute a kind of membership list. It's a lot of the people who are involved
[3:47:19.520 --> 3:47:26.880]  in the radical religious right. Uh, the Blackwater guys in it too, isn't it? I think so. Yes.
[3:47:26.880 --> 3:47:32.160]  He's now converted to Catholicism and people are saying, how does the Catholic Church in Israel
[3:47:32.160 --> 3:47:35.200]  play into this? Cause I get that question all the time. What's your view on those groups?
[3:47:35.200 --> 3:47:41.360]  Well, again, the Catholic Church is very much a mixture of different forces. You know, they,
[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:46.880]  they, they have been, I think the leading, uh, Catholic intellectual in this country,
[3:47:46.880 --> 3:47:53.280]  Thomas Merton, I just gave a talk about him and he was pretty much at war with his own,
[3:47:54.080 --> 3:48:00.880]  he was a trappist monk and his added general forbade him to write anything about politics in
[3:48:00.880 --> 3:48:06.080]  the early sixties. I tend to think the Catholic Church is super corrupt, uh, calling for world
[3:48:06.080 --> 3:48:09.680]  government. Once you're up to be the senator of power, they've said that and is rotting
[3:48:09.680 --> 3:48:15.040]  from the head down. You know what, Alex? I think any big organization is going to have a lot of
[3:48:15.040 --> 3:48:19.680]  corruption in it. I agree with the American government and the Catholic, they also can
[3:48:19.680 --> 3:48:26.640]  have a lot of good in them. I just want your view because listeners, they obsess on groups.
[3:48:26.640 --> 3:48:30.800]  So if people want that, we'll do it. And then I respect you. I don't want your view on CMP,
[3:48:30.800 --> 3:48:35.200]  Catholic Church. What about Israel? Where is it in the power structure from your research?
[3:48:35.200 --> 3:48:43.200]  Well, Israel, uh, at this point is so embattled that, you know, it began as a quite progressive
[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:51.440]  left of center, uh, secular state. It's become completely changed over the years. The disaster
[3:48:51.440 --> 3:48:58.000]  for Israel was in 1967, whether or not they were right temporarily to occupy the West
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:04.160]  Bank. They should have got out of it immediately and a lot of very sane heads at the top of
[3:49:04.160 --> 3:49:09.200]  Israel's government said we must do that, but they haven't. And since then, they've been in a
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:17.680]  virtual state of siege. And I was in Israel, uh, a little over a year ago, everybody I met
[3:49:17.680 --> 3:49:24.880]  were individually, they were charming people, but their ideas, they fear peace at this point
[3:49:24.880 --> 3:49:29.680]  more than they fear war because they know if they have peace, they're going to have to give
[3:49:29.680 --> 3:49:34.400]  that land back. And they don't know how to do that. So it's a perpetual state of war. Uh,
[3:49:34.400 --> 3:49:39.840]  and, and, and I have a way to some extent, you know, there was, there was a man, a right-winger
[3:49:39.840 --> 3:49:45.680]  called Harry Elmer Barnes in the fifties, and he wrote a book, perpetual war for perpetual.
[3:49:46.560 --> 3:49:51.840]  He was violently opposed to the CFR and what they were doing, but his title had a lot of
[3:49:51.840 --> 3:49:59.120]  truth in it. You know, America maintains an absurdly over, uh, over enlarged military
[3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:04.960]  establishment and we have to invent enemies for it. Like Osama bin Laden in a cave. Well,
[3:50:04.960 --> 3:50:10.240]  I'll tell you where I agree with your CNP theory. Uh, I know it's powerful. I know there's some
[3:50:10.240 --> 3:50:14.160]  other right-wing groups and it's kind of a constellation of them. At least, I don't believe
[3:50:14.160 --> 3:50:17.440]  I'm left right, but the point is they call themselves right-wing is that I do see the
[3:50:17.440 --> 3:50:22.480]  very people you write about infesting the whole Israeli lobby and there's this sick
[3:50:22.480 --> 3:50:29.440]  relationship between the Lacudniks and the CNP people and they are in a lot of key areas, uh,
[3:50:29.440 --> 3:50:33.440]  of government and I agree it's a, it's a way over representation.
[3:50:34.160 --> 3:50:39.920]  And some of that sheer madness because they, uh, because of what's in the book of revelation,
[3:50:39.920 --> 3:50:46.400]  you know, that these, uh, Christian right people who are trying to breed a red heifer because
[3:50:46.400 --> 3:50:52.240]  that's what in the Old Testament is going to be a sign of the Messiah. This is, uh,
[3:50:52.240 --> 3:50:56.080]  their electrical rational representation of financial influence.
[3:50:56.080 --> 3:51:00.080]  Peter, we gotta break the, the break's gonna cut you off. Final segment Peter Del Scott, stay with us.
[3:51:01.920 --> 3:51:06.560]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[3:51:06.560 --> 3:51:10.640]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[3:51:10.640 --> 3:51:14.720]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[3:51:14.720 --> 3:51:18.640]  all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[3:51:18.640 --> 3:51:23.760]  again. So our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[3:51:23.760 --> 3:51:30.560]  seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[3:51:30.560 --> 3:51:35.040]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in
[3:51:35.040 --> 3:51:40.560]  any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today
[3:51:40.560 --> 3:51:53.760]  at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365.
[3:51:53.760 --> 3:51:59.520]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones
[3:51:59.520 --> 3:52:07.200]  for survivalseedbank.com. In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip
[3:52:07.200 --> 3:52:13.120]  of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all
[3:52:13.120 --> 3:52:18.800]  of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[3:52:18.800 --> 3:52:23.840]  for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since
[3:52:23.840 --> 3:52:28.960]  day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[3:52:28.960 --> 3:52:35.840]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's
[3:52:35.840 --> 3:52:43.600]  fascist. It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government. This film documents who
[3:52:43.600 --> 3:52:50.880]  Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception

[3:52:58.800 --> 3:53:06.480]  the people strike back. Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic. This very special mineral
[3:53:06.480 --> 3:53:11.280]  has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world. Utopia, Texas is home to
[3:53:11.280 --> 3:53:16.720]  a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced
[3:53:16.720 --> 3:53:22.320]  in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions. Because our colloidal
[3:53:22.320 --> 3:53:27.280]  silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level,
[3:53:27.280 --> 3:53:31.920]  and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[3:53:31.920 --> 3:53:36.000]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver,
[3:53:36.000 --> 3:53:40.960]  gold and copper, with a money-bag guarantee on the colloidal products we produce. For four years,
[3:53:40.960 --> 3:53:45.520]  Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our
[3:53:45.520 --> 3:53:51.040]  God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech. Visit us today at utopiasilver.com,

[3:54:22.000 --> 3:54:26.160]  All of yous and perspectives here to get a clearer picture of what's going on in the world.
[3:54:26.160 --> 3:54:32.160]  Got about two minutes left, sir. Any closing information? You're saying don't judge Obama yet.
[3:54:33.520 --> 3:54:38.880]  He says he's not doing CEO bonuses, but he writes a loophole in it. He says he's not going to hire
[3:54:38.880 --> 3:54:43.360]  lobbyists, that's all he does. All these Wall Street banking people, all the Bush people,
[3:54:43.360 --> 3:54:52.160]  keeping the key neocon in there. As Secretary of Defense, talk about the CMP or whatever.
[3:54:52.160 --> 3:54:58.240]  It's just Obama bad news in my book, and I've done the research, but you want to talk about that
[3:54:58.240 --> 3:55:04.880]  in closing or? Well, I'd like to go back to what you said. Now we have the internet. You can be
[3:55:04.880 --> 3:55:11.840]  heard. You're a real force in this country, and even I, readers, can reach me through my website,
[3:55:11.840 --> 3:55:17.280]  and then they learn about my books. The most important thing for the future of this country
[3:55:17.280 --> 3:55:26.480]  is to preserve the internet, because the mass media are more centralized now than they were 40
[3:55:26.480 --> 3:55:31.760]  years ago, but it was a problem even then. There are so many important things they just won't talk
[3:55:31.760 --> 3:55:40.400]  about. We're talking about the populist reaction to the bank bailouts. The New York Times writes
[3:55:40.400 --> 3:55:47.200]  about that as if this is kind of a dangerous phenomenon, whereas I think it's the health of
[3:55:47.200 --> 3:55:52.720]  the country that is protesting these bailouts. So we need the internet to do it, and we risk
[3:55:52.720 --> 3:56:01.440]  losing the internet. That's right. And the COG, they've had war games in which they were targeting
[3:56:01.440 --> 3:56:07.280]  bloggers. That was the official point. Oh, they admit they have the Pentagon. They admit they have
[3:56:07.280 --> 3:56:10.880]  the Pentagon. People are propagandizing on the web and the millions of dollars worth.
[3:56:10.880 --> 3:56:17.440]  Right. Well, so I talk about this in my book The Road to 9-11, and the last chapter tries
[3:56:17.440 --> 3:56:27.760]  to be optimistic, which I am some days, like today, not always. And it all hangs on the internet
[3:56:27.760 --> 3:56:33.840]  and whether people can use it to mobilize a kind of common front. I agree with you,
[3:56:33.840 --> 3:56:39.440]  one that overcomes the artificial differences between left and right. They'll have to learn
[3:56:39.440 --> 3:56:45.360]  to give privacy to some different topics. I agree. Peter Del Scott, we're out of time. I want to
[3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:50.080]  invite you back in the near future to expand on your intriguing thoughts. Thank you so much, sir.
[3:56:50.080 --> 3:56:54.160]  Thank you. I enjoyed this. You better take care. There he goes, PeterDelScott.net. Now, for the
[3:56:54.160 --> 3:56:57.440]  last minute and a half of the show, then it goes into retransmission with all the key info we
[3:56:57.440 --> 3:57:02.000]  covered today, or I think a very informative show today. Ted Anderson, because Gold shot up
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:06.400]  30-something dollars today, it's only going to go up. Folks, it could go down, but in the overall
[3:57:06.400 --> 3:57:10.800]  graph, it's going up with the destruction of the dollar, the new world order, all of this system.
[3:57:11.440 --> 3:57:15.120]  And Ted has got some amazing gold and silver deals for you today. Don't have much time.
[3:57:15.120 --> 3:57:19.680]  Ted, tell folks the offer, because you've got gold prices, what, when it was 50, 60 bucks less,
[3:57:19.680 --> 3:57:23.440]  you've still got those offers for folks that want to take advantage of it on silver and gold.
[3:57:23.440 --> 3:57:27.280]  Yeah, you're right about that, Alex, because I had been buying. I do take advantage of the lower
[3:57:27.280 --> 3:57:33.600]  prices right now. I do have the Frank at 218. I've got the British sovereign at 272. I also
[3:57:33.600 --> 3:57:41.840]  have the Franklin half dollar at 869. I just got to say, many other coins that are in smaller
[3:57:41.840 --> 3:57:46.080]  volume, I just can't talk about them on air. We don't have enough time, but the prices are going
[3:57:46.080 --> 3:57:52.560]  up, gold went up to 944. The Fed's buying US Treasuries. That's driving the stake further
[3:57:52.560 --> 3:57:54.960]  into the heart of the United States economy. So tell folks what you've got and give them the
[3:57:54.960 --> 3:57:59.280]  number. I mean, you bought this gold 50, 60 bucks less than it is now. You can pass that saving on
[3:57:59.280 --> 3:58:08.240]  right now, Ted. Give them the number. Yeah, 1-800-686-2237. Again, 1-800-686-2237. I'd suggest
[3:58:08.240 --> 3:58:14.720]  people get involved right now. And you've got what, Franks and sovereigns at that price?
[3:58:14.720 --> 3:58:17.920]  Yeah, Franks, sovereigns, all that stuff is just. And you're saying you've got some other stuff,
[3:58:17.920 --> 3:58:24.560]  folks who just call and ask about it. Yeah. And 800-800-686-2237. You've got some silver,
[3:58:24.560 --> 3:58:32.240]  too, right, Ted? Yeah, silver as well. 800-800-686-2237. Folks, protect yourself today in this crazy
[3:58:32.240 --> 3:58:38.480]  economy. 800-686-2237. Thank you, Ted. Thanks, Alex. We had a simulcast with Judge Napolitano.

[3:58:49.040 --> 3:58:55.200]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important
[3:58:55.200 --> 3:58:59.200]  to be self-sufficient. And today, that's more important than ever. We need to be independent,
[3:58:59.200 --> 3:59:03.520]  and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a red line until you have your own
[3:59:03.520 --> 3:59:07.840]  bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[3:59:07.840 --> 3:59:11.760]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family
[3:59:11.760 --> 3:59:16.640]  in the final equation but you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's
[3:59:16.640 --> 3:59:21.520]  safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports. And they do it at almost half
[3:59:21.520 --> 3:59:28.800]  the cost of last year's grocery prices. Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
