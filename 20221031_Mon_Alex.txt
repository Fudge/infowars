[00:00.000 --> 00:28.400]  For Live, it's Monday, October 31st.
[00:28.400 --> 00:34.200]  The official president of the United States has warned the world they will face Armageddon
[00:34.200 --> 00:38.320]  if Russia uses tactical nukes in Ukraine.
[00:38.320 --> 00:43.560]  And when the Russian president said that the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine is senseless,
[00:43.560 --> 00:50.400]  the Biden administration reversed the no-first use and sole-purpose policies regarding nuclear
[00:50.400 --> 00:58.120]  warfare, meaning that the US will now consider first-strike nuclear attacks against non-nuclear
[00:58.120 --> 01:00.180]  threats.
[01:00.180 --> 01:07.120]  In a surprising break from projection and gaslighting, US Congressman Jamie Raskin recently explained
[01:07.120 --> 01:11.000]  the truth behind the current US policy with Russia.
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.880]  Russia is an Orthodox Christian country with traditional social values, and for that reason
[01:16.880 --> 01:21.960]  it must be destroyed no matter what the cost to us.
[01:21.960 --> 01:26.480]  So this is not a conventional war, this is a jihad.
[01:26.480 --> 01:30.720]  Jamie Raskin said that out loud, but many in Washington agree with him.
[01:30.720 --> 01:35.240]  In both parties, they would like to see World War Trans immediately.
[01:35.240 --> 01:37.920]  On the surface, that's what this is.
[01:37.920 --> 01:39.840]  World War Trans.
[01:39.840 --> 01:42.160]  That is what the United States has become.
[01:42.160 --> 01:48.160]  To the rest of the world, America has become the land of abortions, castrations, death
[01:48.160 --> 01:49.480]  and lies.
[01:49.480 --> 01:55.200]  Meanwhile, our diesel fuel is set to run out before the winner, and our leadership could
[01:55.200 --> 01:56.200]  care less.
[01:56.200 --> 02:01.120]  What are we doing to increase the supply of diesel given that the Energy Information
[02:01.120 --> 02:06.640]  Administration said as of October 14th, the US only had about a 25-day supply.
[02:06.640 --> 02:11.840]  You have Northeast and New York already rationing home heating oil.
[02:11.840 --> 02:15.920]  What are we doing to prepare for the winter and to ramp up supply of diesel?
[02:15.920 --> 02:19.720]  I'll take the question on the diesel, because I just don't have the data on that in front
[02:19.720 --> 02:20.720]  of me.
[02:20.720 --> 02:23.280]  So let me take that, and we'll get back to you on that.
[02:23.280 --> 02:28.920]  At large, the President has been working very, very hard to make sure that we're not only
[02:28.920 --> 02:33.880]  are we ready for fluctuations that could come, and of course, the prices are going down,
[02:33.880 --> 02:36.640]  and we think that's important.
[02:36.640 --> 02:41.400]  But that we are also doing what we can to help our European friends and partners who
[02:41.400 --> 02:43.480]  are also going to be facing a long cold winter.
[02:43.480 --> 02:48.240]  We have doubled our commitment, the commitment he made in March for natural gas exports to
[02:48.240 --> 02:49.240]  Europe.
[02:49.240 --> 02:50.240]  We've doubled that commitment.
[02:50.240 --> 02:56.840]  The President has cut off our fuel and given away our emergency reserves.
[02:56.840 --> 03:02.400]  Without diesel fuel, the entire nation comes to a halt, and at this point, nothing is being
[03:02.400 --> 03:03.680]  done to stop it.
[03:03.680 --> 03:07.400]  The problem is, at this point, there may not be an answer, because there may not be a way
[03:07.400 --> 03:09.520]  to avoid a disaster.
[03:09.520 --> 03:13.200]  Diesel fuel is not just low in this country, it's low in every western nation that has
[03:13.200 --> 03:16.080]  aligned itself with Ukraine.
[03:16.080 --> 03:20.120]  All these nations preparing for World War Trans are running out of diesel fuel.
[03:20.120 --> 03:25.760]  While millions may be scratching their heads over World War Trans, too afraid to speak
[03:25.760 --> 03:31.400]  against it, Russian President Vladimir Putin recently explained what it's all about and
[03:31.400 --> 03:33.880]  how Russia has already been there.
[03:33.880 --> 03:40.960]  He said, after the 1917 revolution, the Bolsheviks also said that they would change existing
[03:40.960 --> 03:47.480]  ways and customs, and not just political and economic ones, but the very notion of human
[03:47.480 --> 03:51.400]  morality and the foundations of a healthy society.
[03:51.400 --> 03:58.360]  The destruction of age-old values, religion and relations between people, up to and including
[03:58.360 --> 04:00.880]  the total rejection of family.
[04:00.880 --> 04:06.840]  All this was proclaimed progress, widely supported around the world back then, and was quite
[04:06.840 --> 04:09.920]  fashionable, same as today.
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.440]  Parent number one, and parent number two, birthing parent instead of mother.
[04:15.440 --> 04:20.800]  I repeat, this is nothing new, and they made such a mess, it still makes one shudder at
[04:20.800 --> 04:22.800]  times.
[04:22.800 --> 04:27.480]  President Putin says America should do what they want, but leave Russia out of it.
[04:27.480 --> 04:29.200]  They've already been there.
[04:29.200 --> 04:34.400]  And seeing as how Americans have become nothing but submissive spectators, it seems as if
[04:34.400 --> 04:40.240]  the United States will be going there as well, starting this winter.
[04:40.240 --> 04:57.640]  Coming for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:57.640 --> 05:06.560]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[05:06.560 --> 05:07.560]  you.
[05:07.560 --> 05:11.880]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence Infowars, because they rightly see
[05:11.880 --> 05:17.000]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.200]  the world, for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[05:21.200 --> 05:27.240]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for Infowars.com
[05:27.240 --> 05:31.600]  and to also financially support Infowars.com at the most critical time on our fight by
[05:31.600 --> 05:36.800]  using promo code 1776 at checkout to get an additional 10% off.
[05:36.800 --> 05:40.400]  These people are coming for your birthright, they're coming for your First Amendment, they
[05:40.400 --> 05:43.680]  admit once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[05:43.680 --> 05:47.680]  I'm in your hands, and I'm asking of your support now, you have my commitment to never
[05:47.680 --> 05:51.040]  give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.
[05:51.040 --> 05:54.480]  Thank you for all your past support, and I'm encouraging you now to redouble your efforts
[05:54.480 --> 06:00.000]  at Infowarsstore.com with promo code 1776 for an additional 10% off on the already big
[06:00.000 --> 06:03.000]  sales.
[06:03.000 --> 06:32.440]  Thank you for joining us on this Monday, October 31st.
[06:32.440 --> 06:52.000]  All right, let me just do it this way, let me just read you some of the headlines.
[06:52.000 --> 06:59.160]  The United States has moved hydrogen bomb-loaded B-52 bombers to Australia, preparing for open
[06:59.160 --> 07:01.480]  nuclear war with China.
[07:01.480 --> 07:06.600]  Much of Ukraine's capital without power and water after new Russian missile strikes, the
[07:06.600 --> 07:14.600]  world's most heavily armed governments are becoming explicitly hostile towards one another.
[07:14.600 --> 07:21.880]  Massive protest in Europe to get out of NATO as prices explode and the lights go out.
[07:21.880 --> 07:29.120]  It goes on and on, that's just part of the global military crisis.
[07:29.120 --> 07:36.560]  Then obviously we've got diesel set to run out according to the Department of Energy
[07:36.560 --> 07:39.560]  within several days of the 16th.
[07:39.560 --> 07:48.000]  They say we'll be completely out by the 19th of November, just 19 days away, completely
[07:48.000 --> 07:49.000]  out of diesel.
[07:49.000 --> 07:55.880]  Of course, everybody knows that over 70% of everything that's shipped in this country,
[07:55.880 --> 08:08.240]  from food to medicine to machine parts, is shipped by 18-wheelers that are diesel.
[08:08.240 --> 08:16.720]  Across the country, even most of the charging stations for electric cars are powered by
[08:16.720 --> 08:22.560]  diesel generators on site.
[08:22.560 --> 08:24.800]  Absolutely incredible.
[08:24.800 --> 08:31.440]  Then even bigger news, remember what broke three weeks ago, that Boston University, with
[08:31.440 --> 08:40.320]  the same old suspects, Fauci Bill Gates and others, had produced last year and this year
[08:40.320 --> 08:48.760]  multiple strains of supercovid that kill 80% of the humanized mice that are part of human
[08:48.760 --> 08:55.400]  chimeric clones, so that has the exact same effect on them as it has on humans, 80% kill
[08:55.400 --> 08:59.760]  rate in humanized mice.
[08:59.760 --> 09:07.360]  Well, now it turns out they've produced the same type of combinations that kill the vast
[09:07.360 --> 09:13.640]  majority of humans at a major facility in London.
[09:13.640 --> 09:22.960]  That's just one of 60-plus articles on the COVID takeover I have in the stack.
[09:22.960 --> 09:30.360]  We have obviously the David de Papa story, now the police confirm two men and their underwear
[09:30.360 --> 09:39.480]  in the bedroom, the window smashed from the inside out, it's all in the 911 tape, the
[09:39.480 --> 09:43.880]  official story we were given the first three days with Democrats, that he was a right-wing
[09:43.880 --> 09:50.840]  extremist saying, where's Nancy, like right out of The Shining, here's Johnny, where's
[09:50.840 --> 09:57.920]  Nancy, was all a lie as usual, but if you try to challenge it, you'll be taken off the
[09:57.920 --> 10:05.000]  Internet, be a fry, the well-known popular online lawyer, he has a practice also, very
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.640]  successful in Canada, but very successful online, tell us with Bob Barnes, he was suspended
[10:10.640 --> 10:17.280]  on Twitter for daring to point out the anomalies, and a lot of folks are in total panic mode,
[10:17.280 --> 10:21.800]  they said, look, Elon Musk is screwing us, there was a big purge over the weekend of
[10:21.800 --> 10:26.960]  more conservatives, I'm not saying he's perfect and I'm not saying that we know what's going
[10:26.960 --> 10:33.600]  to happen to the juries out, but obviously they are doing that as activists inside Twitter
[10:33.600 --> 10:39.880]  to purge as many people as they can before he gets his managers in place, he just fired
[10:39.880 --> 10:47.640]  the head censor lawyer and the CEO Thursday evening, so I have a small crew here and
[10:47.640 --> 10:51.920]  if they weren't behind me and working hard, they could sabotage this place in minutes
[10:51.920 --> 10:59.400]  and I would know who did it, imagine a giant company like that, so people got to give this
[10:59.400 --> 11:04.360]  time to see what's happening, we've got some big news on that, the European Union says
[11:04.360 --> 11:09.200]  they'll criminally charge Musk, they'll find millions of dollars, if he doesn't keep the
[11:09.200 --> 11:15.160]  censorship going, he's got a lot of hurdles to get past, may not be able to surmount them,
[11:15.160 --> 11:22.120]  but left wing EU commissioner warns Musk, the bird will fly by our rules, close quote,
[11:22.120 --> 11:26.840]  so that's what we're dealing with, we also have the ADL that decides who can talk and
[11:26.840 --> 11:31.400]  who can have a bank account and who can live, they decide if you go to a gulag or not, both
[11:31.400 --> 11:38.360]  digital and soon physical, the ADL's come out and threaten Elon Musk, ADL melts down
[11:38.360 --> 11:46.800]  over Trump, Alex Jones, Steve Bannon may return to Twitter, said would lead to dire consequences,
[11:46.800 --> 11:53.240]  so that's what we've got going on there, Bolsonaro in most polls was five to ten points ahead
[11:53.240 --> 12:00.000]  but polls don't matter because Bolsonaro never got control of the regional bureaucracies allied
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.880]  with the communists and the drug dealers who were celebrating the streets, Brazil's Bolsonaro
[12:03.880 --> 12:11.160]  yet to concede after Lula's election victory, Bolsonaro's still silent after election defeat
[12:11.160 --> 12:17.160]  as world leaders congratulate Lula, Lula defeats Bolsonaro in Brazil election, stopped the
[12:17.160 --> 12:21.600]  steel leader Ali Alexander calls for a military coup in Brazil, intervening of the presidential
[12:21.600 --> 12:30.000]  election of Bolsonaro defeat, he did not call for that, when you actually read the quote,
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.200]  he said people need to peacefully investigate the election and that the military needs to
[12:34.200 --> 12:41.080]  be standing by to stop any type of giant violence which is going on, you have the truckers
[12:41.080 --> 12:47.200]  and the farmers blocking the roads saying they don't buy it that Bolsonaro won and you've
[12:47.200 --> 12:52.120]  got the drug cartels running around shooting police and blowing things up and firing machine
[12:52.120 --> 12:58.840]  guns in the air saying they're so happy that the communist, it looks like her back just
[12:58.840 --> 13:07.040]  like the left here is allied with God's children as Nancy Pelosi called MS 13, so we have that
[13:07.040 --> 13:12.640]  news coming up, a lot of election news with only eight days out with this incredibly
[13:12.640 --> 13:19.680]  critical midterm situation, with a big national poll out, eight out of ten Americans say
[13:19.680 --> 13:25.640]  things are out of control and the majority blame Democrats and won't change, but again
[13:25.640 --> 13:29.480]  the Democrats have something very special called all the mail in balance and already
[13:29.480 --> 13:35.680]  in key battleground states like Pennsylvania and Arizona, they're saying oh, it may be
[13:35.680 --> 13:40.640]  a few days now, just like last time till we know who the winners are because they better
[13:40.640 --> 13:45.280]  figure out how many of those absentee ballots and how many of the fake ballots and how many
[13:45.280 --> 13:48.560]  of the ballots dead people voted on or folks that moved out of the state have got to be
[13:48.560 --> 13:54.600]  crammed into the system, we've got all of that news coming up, we've got a bunch of
[13:54.600 --> 14:02.160]  pedo news all over the world, pedos don't dress up like grandma, the old parable of
[14:02.160 --> 14:09.080]  the wolf in sheep's clothing or little red riding hood, now they dress up like babies
[14:09.080 --> 14:15.040]  or children in demand to be identified as children and have access to your children,
[14:15.040 --> 14:23.160]  we've got some shocking videos of that coming up, also largest group we've ever seen swarm
[14:23.160 --> 14:29.600]  of illegals invade Texas ranch, we're going to be laying that out, this is going to be
[14:29.600 --> 14:38.680]  a big, big broadcast, Judge Joe Brown is also going to be joining us to cover the election,
[14:38.680 --> 14:45.320]  the mounting censorship, the insanity in the streets of America and around the world,
[14:45.320 --> 14:51.360]  the situation escalating out of control in Ukraine and so much more, by the way I didn't
[14:51.360 --> 14:56.200]  get to this yesterday on the Sunday show, we'll get to it today, have you guys repulled
[14:56.200 --> 15:01.680]  that out of the yesterday stack, the incredible footage shot and released by the Ukrainians
[15:01.680 --> 15:08.920]  of drone boats that are about 25 feet long loaded with explosives, they use Starlink
[15:08.920 --> 15:16.520]  to target their attacks that drive up the side and sunk one frigate a few months ago
[15:16.520 --> 15:23.120]  and damaged a minesweeper and another frigate over the weekend on Saturday, there was a
[15:23.120 --> 15:29.000]  ceasefire in a key port area, an agreement signed in July between Russia and Ukraine
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.160]  brokered by Turkey that they would not attack ships at that port allowing the Ukrainian
[15:34.160 --> 15:40.440]  grain out to the world, but being a terrorist Zelensky of course is taking credit, we're
[15:40.440 --> 15:49.960]  not just blowing up the bridge, but now attacking the ships in the harbor with torpedoes, drone
[15:49.960 --> 15:59.840]  torpedoes, it's all coming up, infowars.com, Hamara's news today.

[18:28.640 --> 18:32.840]  your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[18:32.840 --> 18:39.280]  So X3, despite the fact that it was a run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right
[18:39.280 --> 18:45.080]  now at infowarsstore.com and it funds the info war, which is a 360 win.
[18:45.080 --> 18:49.200]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, takes two weeks to kick out on average, you've
[18:49.200 --> 18:59.960]  got to go to infowarsstore.com and get X3 50% off, X3 50% off infowarstore.com.
[18:59.960 --> 19:04.600]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the global stone documents, from their own
[19:04.600 --> 19:10.400]  admissions is now happening, info wars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[19:10.400 --> 19:15.800]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship
[19:15.800 --> 19:21.400]  and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air, but now we're reaching the most
[19:21.400 --> 19:25.360]  critical juncture in the fight together.
[19:25.360 --> 19:29.800]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[19:29.800 --> 19:33.720]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[19:33.720 --> 19:39.240]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[19:39.240 --> 19:40.240]  It's unsustainable.
[19:40.240 --> 19:44.960]  So please visit saveinfowars.com.
[19:44.960 --> 19:50.320]  Saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, five, 10, $50, $100, whatever you
[19:50.320 --> 19:52.800]  can so that I can continue to persevere.
[19:52.800 --> 19:53.800]  I'll never give up.
[19:53.800 --> 19:56.000]  I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.000]  Thank you for your support.
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.680]  Wouldn't be without you, saveinfowars.com.
[20:00.680 --> 20:25.160]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:25.160 --> 20:27.160]  Welcome back, my friends.
[20:27.160 --> 20:36.360]  What we're facing is mega corporations directing authoritarian takeovers across the world unifying
[20:36.360 --> 20:42.560]  it under the rubric of the COVID virus.
[20:42.560 --> 20:48.880]  And obviously I have met with Bolsonaro's son, who is a member of the Congress.
[20:48.880 --> 20:52.800]  They're big supporters of the broadcast, they're big patriots, we have a lot of connections
[20:52.800 --> 20:53.800]  to Bolsonaro.
[20:53.800 --> 20:58.720]  He's invited down there to interview Bolsonaro, but have just been too tied down to do it.
[20:58.720 --> 21:03.520]  We reached out to one of his personal friends, one of his best friends, who's a national
[21:03.520 --> 21:07.440]  media figure, and said, can you come on?
[21:07.440 --> 21:10.680]  And he just told us, I cannot come on.
[21:10.680 --> 21:14.640]  We are having to evacuate Brazil.
[21:14.640 --> 21:19.360]  Not Bolsonaro, but they're going to target and try to put in prison Bolsonaro.
[21:19.360 --> 21:21.560]  He's going to stay and go down with a ship.
[21:21.560 --> 21:29.360]  But that's how serious the situation is, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:29.360 --> 21:34.240]  So this is not a game.
[21:34.240 --> 21:38.400]  Bolsonaro's already been brutally stabbed, you name it, wildly popular, probably one
[21:38.400 --> 21:40.720]  by 20 points.
[21:40.720 --> 21:46.720]  But he got control of the drug gangs and shielded resilience from the deadly shot to a great
[21:46.720 --> 21:52.520]  extent, the U.N. has been trying to indict him over that, calling it a crime against
[21:52.520 --> 21:57.440]  humanity to not give him poison, experimental shots that violate the Nuremberg Code.
[21:57.440 --> 22:01.080]  And so now they're openly saying they're going to put him in prison.
[22:01.080 --> 22:09.800]  He doesn't have any shot, but either escaping or he can go with the military and stand up
[22:09.800 --> 22:12.120]  to this communist takeover.
[22:12.120 --> 22:18.240]  Now, notice, Democrats want to overthrow every election, they said when Trump won, they would
[22:18.240 --> 22:19.320]  never accept it.
[22:19.320 --> 22:20.800]  That's what the New York Times said.
[22:20.800 --> 22:25.840]  It's what Rahm Emanuel said, it's what Hillary Clinton said, they were all in the New York
[22:25.840 --> 22:26.840]  Times saying it.
[22:26.840 --> 22:31.240]  Pelosi was on TV saying he will go one way or another, we'll just have our own inauguration
[22:31.240 --> 22:33.880]  somewhere else and say that Biden's the president.
[22:33.880 --> 22:37.560]  But then when we questioned Claire Fraud, oh, we're crazy conspiracy theorists, we're
[22:37.560 --> 22:40.960]  terrorists, we're evil.
[22:40.960 --> 22:50.560]  And now the focus is on the fraud in Brazil.
[22:50.560 --> 22:51.560]  It's a coup.
[22:51.560 --> 22:56.280]  Team Biden bragged about rigging Brazil election against President Bolsonaro before election
[22:56.280 --> 23:01.080]  day, says stop the steel leader, Ali Alexander, that joins us next hour.
[23:01.080 --> 23:06.400]  And they indeed did brag and said on Friday that the United States, meaning Biden and
[23:06.400 --> 23:14.960]  Obama will not tolerate anyone challenging an election.
[23:14.960 --> 23:19.080]  Only they are allowed to do that.
[23:19.080 --> 23:27.640]  But Bolsonaro is not conceded yet, so everything is still up in the air.
[23:27.640 --> 23:34.000]  Meanwhile, here in the United States, Hillary Clinton and other Democrats have taken to
[23:34.000 --> 23:40.680]  the airwaves, the videos on infowars.com and said that if Republicans win the House
[23:40.680 --> 23:54.760]  and or the Senate, that it is fraud and that the election has been stolen.
[23:54.760 --> 24:04.720]  So DCCC chair defends Hillary Clinton declaring next election may be stolen, appearing on
[24:04.720 --> 24:09.920]  CBS Face the Nation Sunday, Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee chair, Sean Patrick Maloney
[24:09.920 --> 24:13.400]  defended Hillary Clinton's baseless assertion that right-wing extremists are plotting to
[24:13.400 --> 24:16.280]  steal the next presidential election.
[24:16.280 --> 24:21.000]  So talk about true double think here.
[24:21.000 --> 24:29.080]  You can't question trucks the middle of the night arriving, ballots only marked for Biden,
[24:29.080 --> 24:36.200]  all of them for Biden, running the same stacks over and over again on surveillance video,
[24:36.200 --> 24:40.520]  postal workers showing public and others saying they were had whole trucks, whole vehicles
[24:40.520 --> 24:48.480]  full of nothing but Biden ballots being shipped across state lines into places like Pennsylvania,
[24:48.480 --> 24:52.960]  all the drop boxes with hundreds of people per drop box with sometimes dozens and dozens
[24:52.960 --> 24:56.160]  of ballots putting them in, all the illegal ballot harvesting.
[24:56.160 --> 25:01.360]  As we highlighted last week, Hillary claimed that right-wing extremists already have a
[25:01.360 --> 25:05.400]  plan to literally steal the next presidential election, and they're not making a secret
[25:05.400 --> 25:10.320]  of it, adding that the right-wing controlled Supreme Court may be poised to rule on giving
[25:10.320 --> 25:13.520]  state legislators the power to overturn presidential elections.
[25:13.520 --> 25:18.440]  Just think if that happens in 2024, they're also talking about it happening here in just
[25:18.440 --> 25:20.960]  the next few days.
[25:20.960 --> 25:24.880]  Poll, almost 8 out of 10 Americans say things are out of control.
[25:24.880 --> 25:31.960]  CBS News, Battleground, Tracker, Poll, find 79% think the country's out of control, majority
[25:31.960 --> 25:36.320]  blame Biden.
[25:36.320 --> 25:41.480]  This is a big, big deal.
[25:41.480 --> 25:47.960]  So we'll continue to track and monitor the situation in Brazil, but you notice they're
[25:47.960 --> 25:53.920]  trying to arrest the populist political opposition to the globalist.
[25:53.920 --> 25:59.240]  Let's roll with audio some of the video of truckers blocking roads protesting, the farmers
[25:59.240 --> 26:05.320]  protesting that Bolsonaro's having the election stolen, meanwhile the drug cartels and criminals
[26:05.320 --> 26:18.600]  are celebrating.
[26:18.600 --> 26:46.400]  Let's jump ahead to the narcos celebrating.
[26:46.400 --> 27:01.800]  You notice the communists have guns, it's not the general public, but Bolsonaro was
[27:01.800 --> 27:02.800]  changing that.
[27:02.800 --> 27:08.080]  They don't like it, only the communists and the drug gangs that work for them get the
[27:08.080 --> 27:16.760]  guns in communist areas around the world in blue cities in America.
[27:16.760 --> 27:17.760]  Wow.
[27:17.760 --> 27:20.320]  All right, in a few minutes we're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and
[27:20.320 --> 27:24.920]  drill into the diesel shortage and how huge that is, I mean words can't describe it and
[27:24.920 --> 27:30.520]  then more labs we learn in the West have weaponized, covered the kills 80% of humans that come
[27:30.520 --> 27:31.800]  in contact with it.
[27:31.800 --> 27:34.080]  They're just reporting it like it's no big deal.
[27:34.080 --> 27:37.840]  This is so illegal, so criminal, so insane.
[27:37.840 --> 27:45.400]  Now, let me just tell the listeners, we have been so busy and so overwhelmed here that
[27:45.400 --> 27:48.440]  we have not ended the biggest sale of the year yet, but we have to because as much of

[31:57.520 --> 31:58.520]  support.
[31:58.520 --> 32:04.680]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a coworker that's on
[32:04.680 --> 32:09.160]  drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their
[32:09.160 --> 32:11.720]  aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.

[33:01.480 --> 33:12.480]  Using a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:12.480 --> 33:35.680]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:35.680 --> 33:43.040]  The evidence of organized election fraud in key regions against Bolsonaro and his populace
[33:43.040 --> 33:49.480]  movement are coming in, we'll get to more of that coming up, but first I want to hit
[33:49.480 --> 33:53.600]  the big immediate crisis, not just here but around the world, but it's going to hit Americans
[33:53.600 --> 33:55.800]  so hard.
[33:55.800 --> 34:01.600]  Already the average price of diesel is over $5 a gallon and some areas it's approaching
[34:01.600 --> 34:13.080]  $9 a gallon, that will pass on massive increases in prices of everything, but never in US history
[34:13.080 --> 34:24.320]  have we had no diesel and it is estimated by the Department of Energy and the Department
[34:24.320 --> 34:34.480]  of Transportation that we will be 100% out of diesel on the 19th.
[34:34.480 --> 34:42.280]  This is direct sabotage, shutting down refineries, shutting down pipelines, shutting down drilling,
[34:42.280 --> 34:49.840]  shutting down imports of Russian diesel, which was still just a few percentage points of
[34:49.840 --> 34:54.640]  what we got, but that's enough to cause the chain reaction when we've been running for
[34:54.640 --> 35:00.520]  decades on just enough, just in time delivery, and what has Biden been doing, Obama, the
[35:00.520 --> 35:06.120]  Third Administration, draining the strategic oil reserve as well to the lowest point it's
[35:06.120 --> 35:09.480]  ever been.
[35:09.480 --> 35:13.440]  We are being maneuvered into total collapse and remember what I started telling you two
[35:13.440 --> 35:17.880]  and a half years ago, I said next they're going to have climate lockdowns and say for
[35:17.880 --> 35:21.800]  the earth you're not allowed to leave your house unless you have a carbon ration on your
[35:21.800 --> 35:22.960]  smartphone.
[35:22.960 --> 35:24.720]  How did I know that?
[35:24.720 --> 35:30.000]  Because the World Economic Forum and the big globalist universities like Oxford and Harvard
[35:30.000 --> 35:36.400]  and the rest of them had been proposing for decades a carbon credit with a carbon ration
[35:36.400 --> 35:38.440]  score.
[35:38.440 --> 35:45.600]  I don't predict this stuff, I'm following their battle plan and within a year of me
[35:45.600 --> 35:51.160]  telling you that was going to happen, the London Guardian, the New York Times, the Australian,
[35:51.160 --> 35:57.160]  all of them came out and said the lockdowns have been good for the earth and we need the
[35:57.160 --> 36:03.120]  equivalent of a COVID lockdown every two years to lower carbon and even India in major cities
[36:03.120 --> 36:07.200]  has had days we are not allowed to drive.
[36:07.200 --> 36:11.640]  Report world needs equivalent of pandemic lockdown every two years to meet Paris carbon
[36:11.640 --> 36:20.960]  emission goals and now here they are and it's not my opinion, what did booty judge say?
[36:20.960 --> 36:26.080]  They had the department of transportation, what did Grandholm, they had the department
[36:26.080 --> 36:32.480]  of energy say, they've said it over and over again, so was Biden, they said this is a transition,
[36:32.480 --> 36:39.520]  so the Clintons, so has Bill Gates two weeks ago, he said this is a healthy transition
[36:39.520 --> 36:44.120]  to make us go electric even though there's not enough rare earth minerals in the world
[36:44.120 --> 36:49.560]  to make all the cars be able to operate off batteries, it's all a fraud, they're giving
[36:49.560 --> 36:53.440]  you this excuse for the shell game of oh this will replace it but there's no plan to replace
[36:53.440 --> 36:57.360]  it and they can't replace it.
[36:57.360 --> 37:02.240]  How the diesel shortage is being felt globally, big NPR article, the diesel market is a perfect
[37:02.240 --> 37:08.400]  storm as prices surge, supplies dwindle ahead of winter, fuel company issues, diesel shortage
[37:08.400 --> 37:14.840]  warning, such conditions rapidly developing, diesel shortage update as prices skyrocket
[37:14.840 --> 37:23.440]  over fears, supply could run out, it's not a fear, the department of energy says it
[37:23.440 --> 37:32.000]  will be gone, they will be out and then it's almost impossible to scale back up quickly
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.520]  because it's mainly trucks that are delivering the diesel, yes a lot of diesel gets delivered
[37:36.520 --> 37:40.960]  by pipelines but then it has to be broken up in the pipeline in the big tanks and then
[37:40.960 --> 37:46.520]  delivered to the stations, they don't have the infrastructure at the tank yards to fill
[37:46.520 --> 37:53.960]  the 18 wheelers, guys just search engine, last time I checked it years ago it was 70%,
[37:53.960 --> 38:02.920]  so 72%, let's see what it is now, search the term, what percentage of freight is moved
[38:02.920 --> 38:15.400]  in the United States by 18 wheelers, by trucks, 20% rail, then the small part is canals and
[38:15.400 --> 38:22.560]  the rest is all 18 wheelers, so that number still holds, I haven't checked it in a while,
[38:22.560 --> 38:28.800]  and 70% of everything is delivered by trucks, what does that tell you and even the stuff
[38:28.800 --> 38:36.720]  delivered by canal, by river, or by train has to be broken up at the warehouse and put
[38:36.720 --> 38:48.760]  on diesel trucks, and we've already got supply chain right now, here's the original article,
[38:48.760 --> 38:56.080]  diesel supply down to 25 days left, but the Rockies are in good shape because they've
[38:56.080 --> 39:09.760]  got stockpiles, wow, so that's where our country is right now, massive diesel shortages are
[39:09.760 --> 39:22.000]  already here, okay I said 70% from memory, I apologize that was incorrect, what are the
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.560]  four main types of freight transportation, there are four major types of freight transportation
[39:26.560 --> 39:30.560]  available for shippers to use in the world of freight shipping, the primary ones are
[39:30.560 --> 39:35.880]  ground, road, rail, ocean and air, but it's all going to be broken up by trucks, what
[39:35.880 --> 39:45.160]  percentage of goods is transported by road, 77.4%, but I think that's smaller vans and
[39:45.160 --> 39:57.560]  stuff is the other 7%, it's still 70 last time I checked, so 77%, 70% by 18 whalers,
[39:57.560 --> 40:00.800]  that's the memory, see I don't just spout, people say this guy just spouts stuff, he
[40:00.800 --> 40:04.240]  didn't know what he was talking about, I got a pretty good memory, the point is it doesn't
[40:04.240 --> 40:14.760]  matter, 70 plus percent is delivered by 18 whalers, can you imagine what's going to happen
[40:14.760 --> 40:18.880]  ladies and gentlemen, oh but the big companies, they've already stockpiled diesel, it'll be
[40:18.880 --> 40:23.840]  the small operators that will be shut down, just like the COVID shutdowns, kill the small
[40:23.840 --> 40:29.800]  farmers, the small ranchers, the small businesses, the small auto repair shops, the small restaurants
[40:29.800 --> 40:33.880]  and what did Germany say this year, they said oh we're getting rid of small businesses,
[40:33.880 --> 40:47.800]  they're bad, we have a fetish for small businesses and we are getting rid of it, oh we've heard
[40:47.800 --> 40:52.360]  similar statements I played 3 weeks ago of a council on foreign relations trial lateral
[40:52.360 --> 40:58.440]  commission member at the Kato Institute saying we fetishize small businesses in factories
[40:58.440 --> 41:06.440]  because it makes white men powerful, what, it makes the average person independent, and
[41:06.440 --> 41:16.000]  if you look up who owns small factories per capita, who the biggest owners are, it's Asians,
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.800]  but that doesn't even matter, it's just a total red herring, hey we're shutting off
[41:19.800 --> 41:26.680]  all your jobs, we're going to get the white people, yay!
[41:26.680 --> 41:32.080]  They've already shipped most of our jobs to China with one-sided trade deals and now they're
[41:32.080 --> 41:39.080]  coming into crisis again turning off our gas, restricting our gasoline, our natural gas
[41:39.080 --> 41:44.480]  and cutting off our diesel, that's called warfare.
[41:44.480 --> 41:51.600]  We come back, the latest on Brazil, oh interesting numbers coming in, turns out Bolsonaro won
[41:51.600 --> 41:59.800]  by huge margins in almost every part of the country except one and that's the big area
[41:59.800 --> 42:05.600]  controlled by Lula and the communists and just magically that counterweighed all the
[42:05.600 --> 42:14.880]  other regions in the country and pushed Lula over the edge with 69% of the vote in that
[42:14.880 --> 42:23.640]  key region of Nordetest, if I'm pronouncing that right, isn't that just interesting ladies
[42:23.640 --> 42:33.000]  and gentlemen, so we're going to be covering all that as we watch that very closely, but
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.800]  I want to shift gears into the big enchilada, so let you know again who's behind the next
[42:38.800 --> 42:42.840]  thing, the new world order, who made the virus, who's cooked it up to kill 80% of us and now
[42:42.840 --> 42:47.720]  we learn more labs it's in, these are some really nice people aren't they, but the ADL
[42:47.720 --> 42:51.200]  on the left points the finger at me and says I'm the bad man because I don't believe a
[42:51.200 --> 42:54.760]  damn thing comes out of their mouth, we're going to beat these people together and we
[42:54.760 --> 42:59.920]  are winning, they're going to strike back.
[42:59.920 --> 43:05.240]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[43:05.240 --> 43:10.280]  you, and the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly
[43:10.280 --> 43:15.600]  see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[43:15.600 --> 43:20.520]  the world to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny, that's why
[43:20.520 --> 43:26.400]  it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from info wars.com and to also
[43:26.400 --> 43:30.920]  financially support info wars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo

[44:01.760 --> 44:09.240]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist, I have come from nowhere to the
[44:09.240 --> 44:15.120]  very heights of politics, not just in America, but the world, we are engaging the globalist
[44:15.120 --> 44:21.000]  at point blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit, yes I've persevered,
[44:21.000 --> 44:26.200]  but the listeners and viewers who support info wars for the real reason we've had this
[44:26.200 --> 44:31.640]  success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever
[44:31.640 --> 44:39.000]  had, we are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.160]  important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue
[44:43.160 --> 44:47.920]  in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them, God bless you all, I salute
[44:47.920 --> 44:53.160]  you, I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over
[44:53.160 --> 44:57.680]  the target and this street is happening, the fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's
[44:57.680 --> 45:00.720]  our fight, God bless you all.
[45:00.720 --> 45:07.560]  Think about a world without info wars, just take a moment and sit back and think about
[45:07.560 --> 45:12.440]  all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family
[45:12.440 --> 45:19.320]  that is info wars, think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and
[45:19.320 --> 45:27.000]  Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards
[45:27.000 --> 45:33.240]  firing up their main base to defeat the new world order, the only reason humanity is still
[45:33.240 --> 45:38.760]  in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken
[45:38.760 --> 45:45.200]  action and supported this show, I don't take the credit, I give you the credit and now
[45:45.200 --> 45:49.920]  info wars is facing its darkest hours, it isn't going to give up, without your support
[45:49.920 --> 45:56.960]  we can be shut down, please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate
[45:56.960 --> 46:00.400]  for our legal defense fund.
[46:00.400 --> 46:06.280]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[46:06.280 --> 46:11.640]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[46:11.640 --> 46:15.480]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[46:15.480 --> 46:16.480]  to speak freely.
[46:16.480 --> 46:19.720]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon or
[46:19.720 --> 46:21.160]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[46:21.160 --> 46:25.440]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years and I knew they were planning all
[46:25.440 --> 46:29.360]  of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it
[46:29.360 --> 46:32.920]  without your support and now because we've been so successful warning the population
[46:32.920 --> 46:37.040]  of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the global
[46:37.040 --> 46:38.040]  agenda.
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.880]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars has been
[46:41.880 --> 46:43.560]  because of your past support.
[46:43.560 --> 46:47.360]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[46:47.360 --> 46:51.800]  free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[46:51.800 --> 46:52.800]  on air.
[46:52.800 --> 46:58.400]  On the 1776 promo code, the destination is infowarstore.com and I thank you all for your
[46:58.400 --> 47:01.400]  support.
[47:01.400 --> 47:28.240]  Including a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:28.240 --> 47:44.960]  I wanted to talk about something that it was big news a week ago but that I never really
[47:44.960 --> 47:51.120]  responded to and I need to respond to it here, so I'm going to respond to it briefly because
[47:51.120 --> 47:53.640]  it affects everybody.
[47:53.640 --> 47:59.440]  We saw the show trials run by the Democratic Party and they now admit big PR firms.
[47:59.440 --> 48:02.800]  With judges finding me guilty, they're not letting me put on evidence to defend myself
[48:02.800 --> 48:08.400]  and allowing fraudulent evidence to be put on to these kept juries to decide how guilty
[48:08.400 --> 48:15.480]  I was and so they ruled in Connecticut, their verdict was guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty
[48:15.480 --> 48:21.960]  down the line, $965 million or almost a billion.
[48:21.960 --> 48:31.960]  But then there were other damages and other charges they made that I was lying on air
[48:31.960 --> 48:38.440]  as they found me guilty of as the judge did for selling products that I supposedly lied
[48:38.440 --> 48:45.000]  about by questioning Sandy Hook when the rest of the public was questioning as well to make
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.760]  money and now the lawsuit against Kanye West are saying, well, he said George Floyd had
[48:50.760 --> 48:53.560]  been a fentanyl and assisted to kill him in the coroner said that might have killed him
[48:53.560 --> 48:54.560]  which is true.
[48:54.560 --> 48:58.040]  So we're going to sue you for 200 and something million because you're making money off of
[48:58.040 --> 48:59.040]  it.
[48:59.040 --> 49:02.760]  That's not even in the law, but I told you look for the judge to hit me with something
[49:02.760 --> 49:03.760]  even bigger.
[49:03.760 --> 49:05.320]  Now, why are these numbers so large?
[49:05.320 --> 49:10.400]  I said 900 and something million might as well be a trillion, might as well be a quadrillion
[49:10.400 --> 49:17.640]  or a Googleplex, might as well be infinity, all money on earth, past and present.
[49:17.640 --> 49:25.240]  It's meant to crush our resolve, make it sound like an insurmountable mountain decline
[49:25.240 --> 49:27.040]  because it's a joke.
[49:27.040 --> 49:31.400]  The way bankruptcy law works, the way things work is that you've only got to pay what you
[49:31.400 --> 49:32.840]  got and guess what?
[49:32.840 --> 49:39.200]  They know because in the record discovery, they got my finances and went and did subpoenas
[49:39.200 --> 49:40.700]  and found that it was all true.
[49:40.700 --> 49:44.920]  They know I don't have $10 million or $5 million or that fake expert they had up in
[49:44.920 --> 49:49.040]  Texas saying he's worth $400 million.
[49:49.040 --> 49:55.280]  And off what he said about me, if you go online and type in my net worth, I'm worth $260 million
[49:55.280 --> 50:02.000]  and my company is worth $140 million, which is $400 million.
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.400]  And they told the jury he's worth $400 million and the jury later told Reuters, well, we
[50:07.400 --> 50:10.080]  gave 10% of his wealth to each of the plaintiffs.
[50:10.080 --> 50:13.760]  There were two in Texas, so we gave him $50 something million.
[50:13.760 --> 50:19.840]  They believed I had $400 million, but I don't have $2 million cash, barely enough to have
[50:19.840 --> 50:22.240]  as our operating budget.
[50:22.240 --> 50:24.280]  So it is a joke.
[50:24.280 --> 50:26.160]  They made it a joke.
[50:26.160 --> 50:33.280]  They made it a fraud and when they came out two Fridays ago, a week and a half ago and
[50:33.280 --> 50:40.440]  Bloomberg reported what they asked the court for and they did, they asked for $2.75 trillion
[50:40.440 --> 50:49.960]  due to the Kutma Unfair Trade Practices Law, $2.75 trillion, the biggest verdict ever
[50:49.960 --> 50:51.960]  by a hundredfold.
[50:51.960 --> 50:55.600]  I mean, it's just totally insane.
[50:55.600 --> 51:00.280]  When you see companies that kill hundreds of thousands of people with their drugs, they
[51:00.280 --> 51:02.760]  pay a few billion.
[51:02.760 --> 51:03.760]  I didn't kill anybody.
[51:03.760 --> 51:07.640]  I just questioned something that looked synthetic and political and so did the general public.
[51:07.640 --> 51:11.320]  The public demanded I questioned it because it just didn't look real.
[51:11.320 --> 51:26.160]  Now, that said, they put all of that out there, the $2.75 trillion, that's $2,750 billion.
[51:26.160 --> 51:36.080]  That's $2,750 billion or thousands and thousands and thousands of times what the previous verdict
[51:36.080 --> 51:41.640]  by the jury is, the plaintiff's lawyers have asked for $2.75 trillion.
[51:41.640 --> 51:44.680]  That's why I made the joke back when the first verdict was being read for a billion bucks.
[51:44.680 --> 51:46.480]  I said, I expect a trillion.
[51:46.480 --> 51:52.320]  I want to be number one here and again, that's meant to demoralize people and scare people.
[51:52.320 --> 51:59.480]  I've also got a lot of calls and people on the street and family you name it going, man,
[51:59.480 --> 52:02.760]  you have hundreds of millions of dollars and people calling up wanting to meet a loan of
[52:02.760 --> 52:07.960]  money and stuff because still the numbers so high, people imagine, well, he's got at
[52:07.960 --> 52:10.000]  least have something big for them to say that.
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.400]  No, it's all a joke.
[52:11.400 --> 52:12.920]  It's all hutzpah.
[52:12.920 --> 52:13.920]  It's all fraud.
[52:13.920 --> 52:16.000]  It's all arrogance to crush your will.
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.400]  It's a joke.
[52:17.400 --> 52:22.200]  It's the Wizard of Oz, man behind the curtain, projection and if the big wizard's 100 feet
[52:22.200 --> 52:25.560]  tall and that doesn't scare you, they'll make him 1,000 feet tall and if that doesn't
[52:25.560 --> 52:29.080]  scare you, he'll be a million feet tall, but it's a projection.
[52:29.080 --> 52:30.320]  It's a hologram.
[52:30.320 --> 52:32.640]  It's a fraud.
[52:32.640 --> 52:37.880]  Right now I can walk out this door and go do a show in a studio that reaches the same
[52:37.880 --> 52:41.720]  amount of people, but I love our infrastructure, our crew and the special reports and things
[52:41.720 --> 52:46.040]  we do.
[52:46.040 --> 52:49.360]  And so we're keeping a free speech on air and we're going to continue the show and
[52:49.360 --> 52:56.400]  that's the way it is because under Chapter 11, Sub Chapter 5, emergency reorganization,
[52:56.400 --> 53:00.680]  whatever extra money we have is paid to them for five years and everything else goes around
[53:00.680 --> 53:05.960]  this operation with the crew and the rest of it and that's how that works.
[53:05.960 --> 53:10.200]  Plus, we're appealing for two years all that, but we're already in bankruptcy to put our
[53:10.200 --> 53:13.800]  cards at the table that we don't have any money.
[53:13.800 --> 53:17.320]  That's why they knew this six months ago they had our own financials, but then found
[53:17.320 --> 53:19.240]  us in defaults and we gave them nothing.
[53:19.240 --> 53:20.840]  That's why they said just shut him down.
[53:20.840 --> 53:21.840]  Our goals are shutting down.
[53:21.840 --> 53:23.480]  That was always their goal.
[53:23.480 --> 53:24.480]  It's not money.
[53:24.480 --> 53:26.000]  They want to shut you down.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.400]  They want to silence you.
[53:28.400 --> 53:33.880]  So 2.75 trillion, that is the GDP of France.
[53:33.880 --> 53:37.840]  That is the GDP of India, the gross domestic product.
[53:37.840 --> 53:42.360]  That is 10 times the amount of money the U.S. spent on World War II.
[53:42.360 --> 53:45.320]  That's bigger than the COVID stimulus packages.
[53:45.320 --> 53:53.560]  That's over three times bigger than the yearly Pentagon budget and when I laughed at it, the
[53:53.560 --> 53:58.600]  million dollar verdict, and then I laughed at this last week, just when I called into
[53:58.600 --> 54:02.360]  the show, they had headlines, Jones defies the court, arrest him.
[54:02.360 --> 54:06.320]  He refuses to pay the 2.75 trillion.
[54:06.320 --> 54:15.200]  Well if I get a checkbook out and I got a million bucks in the bank account and I write
[54:15.200 --> 54:19.480]  a check for 2.75 trillion, is it that bouncing a check?
[54:19.480 --> 54:21.400]  Isn't that a crime?
[54:21.400 --> 54:27.920]  So this is basically them just trying to run a scythe up on people and it's disgusting
[54:27.920 --> 54:29.760]  and they just want to scare everybody else.
[54:29.760 --> 54:34.000]  They're all over Twitter, all over Instagram, all over CNN, all over MSNBC, all over every
[54:34.000 --> 54:39.960]  single channel saying we're now going to get to DeNester Susan, we're not going to
[54:39.960 --> 54:43.240]  get Tucker Carlson, we're not going to get everybody and all we got to do is say somebody
[54:43.240 --> 54:44.240]  hurt our feelings.
[54:44.240 --> 54:49.200]  We're not going to sue Elon Musk because he tweeted, you know, was this guy really
[54:49.200 --> 54:56.640]  a visitor as some are saying to the house at Pelosi's, oh well now if that isn't correct,
[54:56.640 --> 55:02.960]  though it is increasingly looking like it is, then he owes trillions too, this is how
[55:02.960 --> 55:03.960]  they do it.
[55:03.960 --> 55:08.080]  Rig courts that find you guilty, tell a jury you're guilty and then the jury sits there
[55:08.080 --> 55:13.120]  and doesn't, they're told because they're being told by a judge this person's guilty
[55:13.120 --> 55:17.360]  and they sow dumb down a lot of the public, especially in blue cities, that they don't
[55:17.360 --> 55:21.040]  know their head from a hole in the ground and they don't understand that a judge is
[55:21.040 --> 55:24.360]  supposed to find you guilty, they don't understand that the other side is supposed to put on
[55:24.360 --> 55:28.760]  evidence, they just get in there and feel good and feel righteous and say all right, we'll
[55:28.760 --> 55:38.640]  give you a billion dollars and then the lawyers are like that's not enough, we want 2.75 trillion,
[55:38.640 --> 55:47.000]  2,750 billion dollars and let me just finish with this, when they did that last week the
[55:47.000 --> 55:51.360]  worm totally turned, it went from the majority of people saying this is BS, this is targeting
[55:51.360 --> 55:56.160]  free speech, he didn't get a fair trial, he didn't do anything wrong, he hardly covered
[55:56.160 --> 56:01.920]  Sandy Hook, you guys are a fraud, to almost everyone saying we apologize, this is absolutely
[56:01.920 --> 56:07.200]  fraudulent, this is a total scam, this is the end of the First Amendment and that's
[56:07.200 --> 56:11.240]  what the EU is doing threatening Elon Musk with 100 billion dollar fines if he allows
[56:11.240 --> 56:15.720]  free speech on Twitter, it's the same thing, it's these bureaucracies, these authoritarian
[56:15.720 --> 56:22.200]  regimes, local, state, federal, international, coming after everybody's free speech, so listen,
[56:22.200 --> 56:26.480]  we're going to stay on the air as long as the good Lord allows us and we don't just
[56:26.480 --> 56:32.880]  have a plan, it's 100%, if we can just pay the bills, which I've told you we're close
[56:32.880 --> 56:38.000]  to not being able to for the last few years, with the supply chain breakdowns and the problems,
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.280]  then we will do the Chapter 5, we'll be out of it by February and then okay, any profit
[56:43.280 --> 56:48.040]  these guys get, which is not very much and then they're openly saying, no we don't want
[56:48.040 --> 56:53.120]  the money, we want him off air, well sorry that's not how federal law works, so we're
[56:53.120 --> 56:58.640]  forcing him out in the open saying we want him off air, it doesn't work like that, so
[56:58.640 --> 57:03.600]  all you gotta do is go to infowarstore.com and get products you already need that are amazing
[57:03.600 --> 57:08.320]  and keep spreading the word about the broadcast that everybody's tuning into now, it's totally
[57:08.320 --> 57:13.680]  backfired on him and we will stay on air in defiance of George Soros and the New World
[57:13.680 --> 57:18.480]  Order and the Democratic Party and Barack Obama and Biden and all the rest of them.
[57:18.480 --> 57:23.280]  Now the sale will end Tuesday, I've extended it and extended it because we've been so busy

[57:46.000 --> 57:55.760]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[57:55.760 --> 58:01.440]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[58:01.440 --> 58:05.080]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[58:05.080 --> 58:09.480]  They know of the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over and
[58:09.480 --> 58:15.520]  all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back and our main
[58:15.520 --> 58:19.840]  tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[58:19.840 --> 58:25.080]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com

[58:49.760 --> 58:52.920]  Look it's not hype that info wars has changed the world.
[58:52.920 --> 58:57.480]  It's not hype that your support of info wars is the reason we were able to do this so I
[58:57.480 --> 58:59.120]  salute you and I thank you.
[58:59.120 --> 59:03.080]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[59:03.080 --> 59:07.040]  Well high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride and when
[59:07.040 --> 59:10.120]  you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge yourselves, it doesn't just give
[59:10.120 --> 59:14.640]  you energy, it doesn't just boost your immune system but it also blocks the bad halogens
[59:14.640 --> 59:18.320]  in the fluoride chlorine bromide bromine family.

[59:22.800 --> 59:28.240]  few drops every day and almost everyone has dramatic results plus it funds the info war.

[59:49.040 --> 1:00:18.640]  Okay, I've got a few more things I want to say about the 2.75 trillion garbage that
[1:00:18.640 --> 1:00:23.160]  has been mainly focused on war and inflation, economy, and bloating, open borders, pedofall,
[1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:25.240]  drag queen time, all of it.
[1:00:25.240 --> 1:00:29.000]  And next segment I'm going to drill into more labs in the western world with weaponized
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:30.680]  cover that kills 80% of human.
[1:00:30.680 --> 1:00:36.200]  That's coming up next segment ahead of Ollie Alexander joining us, the latest Bolsonaro,
[1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:41.400]  the latest on the diesel shortages, this is going to be a jam-packed two hours, Judge
[1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:44.000]  Joe Brown's coming up and then the great Gerald Salente.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:51.840]  But I wanted to speak, I wanted to talk about how these globalists operate and how they're
[1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:55.040]  always trying to play mind games with people.
[1:00:55.040 --> 1:01:00.960]  So they default me, they rig these court cases, won't let us put on evidence, have a jury
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:09.440]  in Texas say 50 million, a jury in Connecticut in a literal kangaroo court say 965 million,
[1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:10.440]  almost a billion.
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:16.200]  Now the judge, the lawyers are asking in these extra damages that deal with unfair trade
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:26.360]  practices that the judge has found me guilty on, not the jury, for 2 trillion 750 million.
[1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:32.480]  Excuse me, 2 trillion 750 billion, it's hard to get numbers like that right.
[1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:36.240]  That is meant to demoralize you, to break your will, to think that we've got to give
[1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:38.240]  up and it's all over, it's the opposite.
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:42.960]  They totally woke up almost everybody and blew up in their face spectacularly and the
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:48.040]  big Democrat party PR firm that now admits they ran the whole show is running around
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:53.560]  like a chicken with their head cut off saying, well, we didn't really want 2.75 trillion.
[1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:57.080]  But they did ask for it and they've already got their quote billion, which they'll never
[1:01:57.080 --> 1:02:01.520]  get because I'll never make a hundred million dollars profit in my life.
[1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:02.520]  Never did.
[1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:03.520]  It's just insane.
[1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:07.520]  And the media spends it, you're saying you won't pay.
[1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:12.240]  Yes, because I can't because it's made up because it's a fraud to intimidate and scare
[1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:16.360]  everybody and they know on appeal, it's going to be overturned.
[1:02:16.360 --> 1:02:20.240]  So the bankruptcy is there just to show the world we don't have all this extra money and
[1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:21.520]  it's an emergency reorganization.
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:23.680]  Then there's 2 years of appeals.
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:28.880]  So the only group that can take us off air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[1:02:28.880 --> 1:02:33.360]  If you don't go to infowarstore.com and get incredible products, take the great reset
[1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:34.360]  and war for the world.
[1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:38.200]  There's signed or unsigned copies at infowarstore.com.
[1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:41.320]  The signed copy is a fundraiser to keep us on air.
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:44.800]  And we are right there slipping back into the red right now and the bankruptcy could
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:46.520]  fail if you don't support.
[1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:50.640]  So I'm asking you now, get the historic book that's been number one in the last few months,
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:57.120]  off and on on Amazon, not just nonfiction, not just fiction, not just political, not
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:01.080]  just political science, number one in the world, the great reset and the war for the
[1:03:01.080 --> 1:03:08.040]  world at infowarstore.com, that's the place to get it so that we get the funds into this
[1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:09.640]  operation.
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:15.960]  When you come in and you get the signed copies at infowarstore.com, all of that money goes
[1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:20.320]  to keep free speech on the air and to keep the crew here and to make us solvent for
[1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:21.320]  the bankruptcy.
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:22.320]  Okay?
[1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:23.560]  So they can't take us off air.
[1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:27.160]  So that's why you should get the signed copy for $99 if not for 20 something bucks, get
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:32.520]  the unsigned copy, whatever you can afford, but do it now at infowarstore.com.

[1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:39.920]  fight, this is a war and wars take money and we're going to win this thing.

[1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:04.880]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:10.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced when it feel and how healthy
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:14.480]  it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller and it's been sold out

[1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:36.840]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:40.960]  It is critical to bolster our body defenses with a product like this.
[1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:44.400]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the

[1:05:58.320 --> 1:06:24.280]  So hiding in plain view is the biggest crime against humanity ever committed and they're
[1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:30.840]  just rolling it out there and plausibly setting up the deniability when they release a weaponized
[1:06:30.840 --> 1:06:35.000]  COVID that kills 80% of humans that come in contact with it.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:40.040]  And they're even telling people where the bio weapons are at universities so when they
[1:06:40.040 --> 1:06:44.520]  release it, they can claim some terrorists did it, guaranteed it's their plan.
[1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:47.840]  The last three years is just a drill for when they really kill everybody.
[1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:51.360]  And you know, Alex Jones is almost always right folks, we don't need me to tell you
[1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:52.360]  this.
[1:06:52.360 --> 1:06:53.360]  We're going to lay it all out.
[1:06:53.360 --> 1:06:54.360]  We're going to talk about it.
[1:06:54.360 --> 1:06:56.080]  But why is the FBI not rating them?
[1:06:56.080 --> 1:06:59.200]  Why are they not taking it to Fort Dietrich and incinerating it?
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:01.000]  Why are they not getting rid of it safely?
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:02.920]  Why are they not arresting the people doing it?
[1:07:02.920 --> 1:07:06.280]  Because the eugenics death cult is in control.
[1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:10.080]  And remember to be able to carry this out, they've got to have us off the ear.
[1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:14.760]  Remember, first they came for Alex Jones, we're going to play this short special report
[1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:19.080]  and then we're going to go to the biggest news ever.
[1:07:19.080 --> 1:07:26.080]  Alex Jones has been ordered to pay Sandy Hook victims' families nearly $1 billion.
[1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:35.520]  A billion dollar verdict, almost a billion dollars in damages, $965 million in damages,
[1:07:35.520 --> 1:07:43.440]  $965 million, a billion dollars, $100 billion.
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:48.280]  This is actually a larger warning for other liars and conspiracy theorists in our society
[1:07:48.280 --> 1:07:49.280]  and our politics.
[1:07:49.280 --> 1:07:53.680]  It's a rebuke and a punishment that we believe, according to a lot of legal experts, will
[1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:55.240]  set this new precedent.
[1:07:55.240 --> 1:08:02.640]  The mother of George Floyd's daughter, now filing a $250 million lawsuit against Kanye
[1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:03.640]  West.
[1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:08.360]  Kanye West made, quote, false statements about the manner of Floyd's death.
[1:08:08.360 --> 1:08:13.840]  He says the family could sue for intentional infliction of emotional distress, citing the
[1:08:13.840 --> 1:08:17.280]  recent Alex Jones trial as an example.
[1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:21.440]  Alex Jones is patient zero.
[1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:22.440]  Take him out.
[1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:23.440]  Now, what does this mean?
[1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:28.440]  An illegal limit and punishment for other individuals in that country.
[1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:31.640]  Lying and conspiracy theories, part of their business model or politics.
[1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:34.320]  Fox News is clearly watching this closely.
[1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:39.120]  They are facing this suit by Dominion Voting Systems for over a billion dollars.
[1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:46.480]  You heard that right, billion with a capital, bye.
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:47.680]  This is not a trial.
[1:08:47.680 --> 1:08:50.240]  There was no jury trial in this case.
[1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:54.640]  No judge in U.S. history has ever told somebody what they can and can't say.
[1:08:54.640 --> 1:08:58.520]  Everybody knows you're supposed to get your day in court, yet the one person who is being
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:01.400]  denied any day in court is Alex Jones.
[1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:02.920]  Alex Jones didn't kill anybody.
[1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:06.360]  You were clear in that you had a change of heart or you believed that you were wrong
[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:08.960]  or you believed you made a mistake, which I think is admirable.
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:13.280]  And I think the fact that they want to browbeat you after that is what is so scary.
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:15.120]  And I think that people out here would do well.
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:19.800]  If you're watching to understand that apologies do nothing with these monsters.
[1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:23.240]  The whole purpose of the First Amendment is to keep the government the hell out of the
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:30.360]  business of speech, totally disregarded by the Connecticut courts when they decided to
[1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:32.360]  write their Alex Jones rule.
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:37.440]  This judge, Barbara Nellis, is a disgrace to the rule of law, a disgrace to the judiciary,
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:39.640]  a disgrace to the justice system.
[1:09:39.640 --> 1:09:41.880]  So the regime has come for Alex Jones.
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:44.360]  They always start with Alex Jones when it comes to these things.
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:49.120]  They don't have to be an Alex Jones fan to understand that he is most definitely being
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:50.520]  made an example of.
[1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:57.520]  The law industrial complex in collusion with the media can work in harmony to completely
[1:09:57.520 --> 1:09:59.880]  obliterate somebody financially.
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:04.760]  That's a billion dollars for expressing an opinion, which under the prevailing Supreme
[1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:08.400]  Court case law is absolutely protected.
[1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:13.840]  The question is, do they really care about what Alex Jones said, or do they want to
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:15.520]  destroy Alex Jones?
[1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:21.960]  Do you now believe that the First Amendment is absolute, or do you believe that the First
[1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:24.080]  Amendment has limitations?
[1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:29.600]  I believe that the First Amendment is absolute and that you can't be privately constrained.
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:34.920]  Obviously, if you get found guilty by a real jury in a real trial for defamation or libel,
[1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:38.240]  then it doesn't have absolutes.
[1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:40.560]  It does have limits, but I wasn't given a free trial.
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:42.360]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:43.360]  Most countries don't have that.
[1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:46.840]  The United States is the only country that has this, right?
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:50.920]  This enshrined freedom of speech in our highest law.
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:52.360]  That's what they want to take away.
[1:10:52.360 --> 1:10:53.840]  This is our rights being taken.
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:55.360]  This is a Hollywood production.
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:57.000]  I'm not saying Sandy Hook didn't have it.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.640]  I'm saying the production of what I supposedly did and how big it became in this huge event.
[1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:03.280]  I'm not the Sandy Hook guy.
[1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:06.960]  I'm the guy that wrote the number one best-selling book in the world, The Great Reset and the
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:08.480]  War for the World.
[1:11:08.480 --> 1:11:12.960]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:24.320]  And the real reason they want to software is for what we do, we expose their plans.
[1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:29.480]  I told you first that they made it to the lab, I told you that they were going to kill
[1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:30.480]  you with the shots.
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:33.920]  I told you they'd bring out a World ID, and I told you that they were developing stuff
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:37.720]  far worse than the first COVID-19 they released.
[1:11:37.720 --> 1:11:38.960]  It was a beta test.
[1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:44.840]  And now they admit at Boston University a month ago or three weeks ago that they cooked
[1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:47.640]  it up in the last year that kills 80% of humans.
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:55.040]  Well now, the reports on infowars.com, it links to mainstream news in the UK, report
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:12:02.120]  potentially lethal news super stream, just like the one that they admit kills 8% of humans,
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:09.120]  like Boston, has been produced in Imperial College London, a hybridized gain-of-function
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:13.600]  version completely, absolutely illegal.
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:20.480]  At least four labs on two continents have now constructed non-natural lab-generated viruses
[1:12:20.480 --> 1:12:27.200]  that retain the high immune escape of Omicron and acquire higher severity than Omicron,
[1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:32.360]  and that is such a reasonably expected to increase transmission of pathogenesis in humans.
[1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:36.600]  So they kind of whitewash what's happening in the UK, but it's the same mix to create
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:44.720]  the super strain that kills 80% of those that come in contact with it that was made in Boston.
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:49.080]  Outrage is Boston University creates Omicron strain that has a 80% kill rate in humanized
[1:12:49.080 --> 1:12:54.680]  mice that act the same as humans.
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:13:00.640]  Like the sign a protester had, if my dog got three rabies vaccines in a year and still
[1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:06.160]  got rabies, I'd start to ask questions, yeah.
[1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:11.400]  Good news, the representative Roy, Chip Roy, and colleagues calling Republican leadership
[1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:18.560]  to investigate CDC's politicization of COVID-19 child vaccine vote, we even have Ben Shapiro
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:22.280]  coming out saying he was lied to and shouldn't have taken the shot, talk about a rat leaving
[1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:26.120]  the sinking ship, how much money was he paid to push those lies.
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:31.040]  Back when he said the vaccine's 95% effective is preventing you from getting the virus and
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:35.600]  also mitigates the severity of the disease, none of that's true, 99% of those who actually
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:37.720]  get COVID-19 will survive.
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:41.640]  He was responding to Elijah Shaffer saying your immune system is two years ago, has
[1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:46.120]  a higher success rate at combating COVID-19 than the actual vaccine, and he said in other
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:51.280]  words, get the vaccine dopes.
[1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:55.200]  Think of all the brainwashing and all the fear mongering and the psychosis, they put
[1:13:55.200 --> 1:14:00.560]  the public under when it was the shot that was going to kill you all along.
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:09.720]  Now, these are the people calling you a conspiracy theorist, very, very sad, and we've got clips
[1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:16.080]  of Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Rachel Maddow all saying it's 100% effective, you
[1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:19.240]  should be made to take it because if you don't take it, you can spread it to other people,
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:21.360]  but if you take the shot, you can't spread it, you're protected.
[1:14:21.360 --> 1:14:23.840]  And they said, well, you're not protected, but then you can't spread it.
[1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:27.040]  Oh, well, actually, you spread it more and you're more likely to spread it and get it
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:28.480]  and get sick and die.
[1:14:28.480 --> 1:14:31.760]  All of that now admitted.
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.960]  Meanwhile, the Chinese government began COVID-19 vaccine research in 2019.
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:38.160]  Oh, yeah, really?
[1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:40.040]  Think so?
[1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:43.080]  Bodybuilder to the challenge everybody and said he was taking the vaccine and prove it
[1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:46.760]  was safe out of a heart attack.
[1:14:46.760 --> 1:14:49.680]  And it goes on and on and on.
[1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:55.520]  The Holy Grail is a global QR code ID system where you can't leave your house, buy or sell
[1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:56.520]  without it.
[1:14:56.520 --> 1:15:03.720]  They've beta tested it in China and Australia and Canada and Italy and now it's coming here.
[1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:05.720]  It's a big, big deal.
[1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:11.440]  All right, we're going to look at the midterms with a great political analyst, a good friend
[1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:15.240]  of mine, Ali Alexander, will also look at what's happening in Brazil.
[1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:19.880]  He's been demonized for pointing out the evidence points towards this being another
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:20.880]  major steal.
[1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:25.200]  We know the Biden administration was involved down there in the manipulation.
[1:15:25.200 --> 1:15:29.880]  Also the ADL calling for more censorship of yours truly and President Trump just outrageously
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:36.040]  self-appointed globalist and the true authoritarianism, but the totalitarianism, they are raining
[1:15:36.040 --> 1:15:38.400]  down on us, but humanity's not giving up.
[1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:44.800]  And all over the world, we see the numbers people are absolutely breaking their conditioning
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:48.520]  at a massive, massive accelerated rate.
[1:15:48.520 --> 1:15:52.720]  So we have only begun to fight info wars.com is the tip of the spear.
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:54.960]  You are the resistance will be right back.
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:57.960]  Stay with us.
[1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:03.280]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:04.280]  you.
[1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:08.520]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see
[1:16:08.520 --> 1:16:13.640]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[1:16:13.640 --> 1:16:17.840]  the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.

[1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:11.080]  aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:14.280]  Well it's the same thing for America the rest of the world.
[1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:18.960]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people
[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:22.920]  don't listen and they don't supplement it's literally an intervention.
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:25.000]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:31.400]  I don't play with Mr. Health but if I wasn't taking products like x3 from info wars store.com
[1:19:31.400 --> 1:19:34.720]  I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:39.840]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible and despite the
[1:19:39.840 --> 1:19:46.160]  fact that selling out x3 is 50% off right now exclusively at info wars store.com.
[1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:48.800]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:50.040]  We're not selling it for that.
[1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:53.520]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.
[1:19:53.520 --> 1:19:59.520]  At x3 today 50% off at info wars store.com all supplies last.
[1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:28.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:45.280]  We just got hit with a bio weapon and now our enemies are telling us that they've cooked
[1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:51.840]  up weaponized strains of COVID in England and the United States that are in major universities
[1:20:51.840 --> 1:20:53.960]  that will kill 80% of us.
[1:20:53.960 --> 1:21:00.080]  This is an exterminity population cult that lied to us and held us hostage until we accepted
[1:21:00.080 --> 1:21:07.360]  the shots and then as many people could be forced into it, did it, the rest of us didn't
[1:21:07.360 --> 1:21:12.040]  and now they're hoping we just forget about what they did so they can do it again with
[1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:14.780]  a more deadly virus in the near future.
[1:21:14.780 --> 1:21:17.120]  This is a ticking time bomb.
[1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:21.560]  The entire civilization is on the edge of a precipice.
[1:21:21.560 --> 1:21:26.440]  Do not forget what people like Rachel Maddow and Bill Gates and others told you that it
[1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:29.600]  was totally effective and would protect you when it was the opposite.
[1:21:29.600 --> 1:21:30.840]  It destroys your immune system.
[1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:32.000]  It makes you get sick.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:33.560]  It makes you die.
[1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:37.920]  Remember who the real disinformation criminals are when they point their filthy fingers at
[1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:38.920]  us.
[1:21:38.920 --> 1:21:39.920]  Here is Maddow.
[1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:46.040]  Instead of the virus being able to hop from person to person to person, potentially mutating
[1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:50.480]  and becoming more virulent and drug resistant along the way, now we know that the vaccines
[1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:56.840]  work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person.
[1:21:56.840 --> 1:22:00.920]  A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus.
[1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:02.840]  The virus does not infect them.
[1:22:02.840 --> 1:22:06.800]  The virus cannot then use that person to go anywhere else.
[1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:12.920]  It cannot use a vaccinated person as a host to go get more people.
[1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:20.040]  That means the vaccines will get us to the end of this.
[1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:22.960]  If we just go faster.
[1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:23.960]  So there you go.
[1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:26.240]  If we just submit to them, it will get us to the end of it.
[1:22:26.240 --> 1:22:28.040]  Just take the shot and go back outside.
[1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:32.680]  The reason I played this is we will get into Bolsonaro and the U.S. midterms and all that
[1:22:32.680 --> 1:22:33.680]  next segment.
[1:22:33.680 --> 1:22:37.960]  With one of the smartest political analysts I know, Ali Alexander.
[1:22:37.960 --> 1:22:42.680]  And also we are in the same class of people targeted by the deep state for destruction
[1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:44.760]  because we are loyal Americans.
[1:22:44.760 --> 1:22:47.040]  How vindicated are you and I and others?
[1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:48.440]  It is not about being vindicated.
[1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:49.440]  It is about we were right.
[1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:51.040]  People better listen to us.
[1:22:51.040 --> 1:22:53.160]  About how deadly these shots were, how it wouldn't work.
[1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:57.040]  And how discredited is the political system with all the numbers from around the world
[1:22:57.040 --> 1:23:03.440]  coming in that establishment big pharma, U.N. connected leftist are reviled everywhere
[1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:09.240]  at an accelerated rate and their whole attempted COVID takeover backfired on them in my view.
[1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:13.240]  What is your view on the state of the world and just the trust the people have for the
[1:23:13.240 --> 1:23:14.240]  system?
[1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:17.240]  Because I think, in fact, I know it is completely gone.
[1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:21.680]  Yeah, I think that we are in act three of their play.
[1:23:21.680 --> 1:23:28.480]  I think that they intend by any means necessary to usher in a great reset.
[1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:33.760]  Like I said, I think that we are going to experience a crash, not just a market crash,
[1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:37.640]  not just a famine, but maybe a World War III.
[1:23:37.640 --> 1:23:44.400]  And how we bounce back from that, how we equip our neighbors with calls to get back
[1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:49.840]  to the basics instead of like a new, new deal, you know, an international new deal.
[1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:51.760]  That is how humanity survives.
[1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:57.880]  So when I'm looking at all these crises, I've never seen a greater opportunity to wake
[1:23:57.880 --> 1:24:03.440]  up people to stand against the elites in a peaceful and patriotic way.
[1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:05.480]  And I welcome the contrast.
[1:24:05.480 --> 1:24:10.640]  I mean, the hour is late, but I welcome the contrast and we are entirely vindicated.
[1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:16.960]  An illegitimate election led to massive inflation, the rise in food prices and energy crisis
[1:24:16.960 --> 1:24:22.680]  that is going to kill Europeans and like I said, the potential of a nuclear war.
[1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:28.760]  And now they're doing the same thing in Brazil so that they can collapse South America and
[1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:31.480]  hand it over to the CCP.
[1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:35.160]  We'll talk about that next segment and how you're being demonized for pointing that
[1:24:35.160 --> 1:24:42.440]  out by business inside another establishment, mouthpieces, but pulling back, the globalists
[1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:45.560]  admit they need all these crises to bring in their new world government, their new
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:49.760]  castle society, their new universal basic income based on the CCP, as you rightfully
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:50.920]  say.
[1:24:50.920 --> 1:24:56.000]  How do you think their attempt at imposing this great reset is going?
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:59.600]  From my perspective, it's not going well, but that's only making them double down that
[1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:03.160]  much harder, which makes the situation that much more explosive.
[1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:09.600]  Yeah, that's my analysis too, and I've said this before, we're dealing with the grandchildren
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:16.320]  and great-grandchildren of these kind of benevolent oligarchs, but at least those oligarchs were
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:23.720]  competent as they were redrawing the world and dividing and conquer.
[1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:31.440]  These people like Boris Johnson and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Barack Obama, Emmanuel
[1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:38.240]  Macron, in a lot of ways, these people are hugely incompetent at this kind of death cult
[1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:39.600]  that they're running.
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:47.160]  So I agree, I think that they're failing to get the opt-in from even good faith liberals,
[1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:53.840]  which is frankly dwindling, their under attack from the Marxist and progressives, the Antifa,
[1:25:53.840 --> 1:25:59.040]  and frankly now out and out, Luciferians doing un-baptisms.
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:02.720]  It's remarkable that they're revealing their hand, and people are waking up and we're using
[1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:05.200]  the internet to communicate what their plans are.
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:12.200]  So I agree with your analysis exactly is they are being defeated, we are winning, we are
[1:26:12.200 --> 1:26:18.960]  pushing back, we are developing martyrs, unfortunately, on our side, but that's causing them to double
[1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:19.960]  down.
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:27.040]  And I've said, I've declared, in December, they're going to push for a false flag so
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:33.440]  that an aid package for Ukraine is actually proposed under the speakership of McCarthy,
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:34.440]  not Pelosi.
[1:26:34.440 --> 1:26:35.440]  Why?
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:41.200]  Because they need to cook and compromise McCarthy and a bunch of Republicans early.
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:46.600]  This way, it cuts off Donald Trump and he's having to run against his own party effectively
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:47.600]  in the narrative.
[1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:52.880]  And so look for a false flag in December, because January and February, they are going
[1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:57.240]  to do a coup d'etat with the narrative.
[1:26:57.240 --> 1:27:00.760]  I've also noticed that the left, major think tanks, Democratic Party groups now admit they
[1:27:00.760 --> 1:27:03.920]  ran the whole Sandy Hook show trials against us.
[1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:07.560]  They are in full panic mode to get us off air, but not just us, to get everybody, because
[1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:10.800]  they know if we're here challenging the narrative, if you're there, it's game over.
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:15.960]  That's why listeners have to really let it sink in, that you have all the power.
[1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:22.040]  Only listeners and viewers can take our information, Ali Alexander's information, Steve Bannon's
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:26.120]  information, Roger Stone's information, Donald Trump's information, and get it past the censors
[1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:27.720]  and you're doing a great job.
[1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:33.120]  Text messages, emails, word of mouth, take clips, reupload them yourself, realize whether
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:37.160]  you reach 10 people or a million, it's changing the world and keep doing it and understand
[1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:38.800]  you've got to send people to our URLs.
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:40.560]  Hey, Alex Jones is still on air.
[1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:41.560]  Oh, really?
[1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:42.560]  I want to hear what he has to say.
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:47.440]  And we're getting massive new numbers of new people tuning in and also support Ali Alexander
[1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:54.440]  in his great work and the shows he does, find him on telegram, t.me forward slash Ali Alexander,
[1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:59.000]  Ali Alexander dot org and give send go dot com forward slash Ali Alexander because he's
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.240]  been through hell.
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:03.840]  He was the only guy that had the courage to go and not take the fifth, which was a smart
[1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:08.200]  move I think for myself, but he eloquently exposed the whole fraud that it wasn't a
[1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:11.200]  staged event and the grand jury knew that was the truth.
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:12.720]  He went before the grand jury, everything.
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:16.320]  So Ali just did a excellent job telling the truth.
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:20.840]  The whole truth is about the truth and you get a just a superlative job, my friend.
[1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:23.240]  Well, I really appreciate that.
[1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:26.400]  You know, and I was talking with the mutual friend today, you know, Jason Jones and he
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:28.840]  said, you know, tell Alex he was right.
[1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:29.840]  He was right.
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:30.840]  He was right.
[1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:35.360]  And only Bob Marley beat him to describing what we are actually facing.
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:40.480]  And I'm just happy to be in the foxhole with you, with info wars and the info warriors
[1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:45.000]  who are spreading these links, spreading our messages, funding our legal defenses, buying
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  products and we're winning and they're losing.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  That's right.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:50.880]  And by the way, I was listening to Bob Marley again the other day.
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:55.200]  I was on a Bob Marley Jag and I'm like, this guy was Alex Jones before I was born.
[1:28:55.200 --> 1:28:58.120]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:58.120 --> 1:28:59.120]  It's our best seller.
[1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:04.600]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller, but as folks tried
[1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:09.160]  vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made him feel and how healthy it made
[1:29:09.160 --> 1:29:13.800]  him, it has become our number one overall best seller and it's been sold out for a while,
[1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:15.680]  but it's finally back at stock.
[1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:21.120]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:22.120]  function of the body.
[1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:26.920]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:29.480]  need to live and be healthy.
[1:29:29.480 --> 1:29:33.520]  Essential means without these things, you die and so much of the food is debased.
[1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:35.720]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[1:29:35.720 --> 1:29:39.640]  It is critical to bolster our body defenses with a product like this.
[1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:43.280]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[1:29:43.280 --> 1:29:46.800]  very best and it's a low price and it funds the info war.
[1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:50.960]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally

[1:29:57.720 --> 1:30:03.880]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy.
[1:30:03.880 --> 1:30:09.560]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[1:30:09.560 --> 1:30:13.160]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[1:30:13.160 --> 1:30:16.680]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[1:30:16.680 --> 1:30:22.800]  It's came over and all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:30:22.800 --> 1:30:27.920]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[1:31:06.520 --> 1:31:07.520]  of the spear.

[1:32:06.200 --> 1:32:10.640]  My credibility has never been higher and it's because of your backing of this operation
[1:32:10.640 --> 1:32:16.520]  that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits
[1:32:16.520 --> 1:32:22.640]  stay on air, but now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[1:32:22.640 --> 1:32:27.800]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:32:27.800 --> 1:32:31.720]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[1:32:31.720 --> 1:32:37.240]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[1:32:37.240 --> 1:32:38.240]  It's unsustainable.
[1:32:38.240 --> 1:32:46.480]  So please visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, $5,
[1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:50.760]  $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[1:32:50.760 --> 1:32:54.000]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  Thank you for your support.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:59.680]  Wouldn't be without you, saveinfowars.com.
[1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:29.520]  Including a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:52.460]  we are now Saac.
[1:33:52.460 --> 1:34:09.260]  We bet the horror, oh, hurry, oh, hurry, oh, now, cause we've got no time to lose.
[1:34:09.260 --> 1:34:11.700]  Some people got facts and claims.
[1:34:11.700 --> 1:34:13.720]  Some people got frightened.
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:18.300]  Powerful song he goes into talking about the technocracy and the scientific elite wanting
[1:34:18.300 --> 1:34:27.780]  kill humanity, destroy our children. Every song's poetry. We're the survivors. All right.
[1:34:27.780 --> 1:34:31.940]  Ali Alexander is definitely a survivor. The balance of the sound, I'm trying to give you
[1:34:31.940 --> 1:34:36.660]  the floor, my friend, to get into the midterms here, Bolsonaro. I mean, they're saying they're
[1:34:36.660 --> 1:34:40.460]  going to arrest Bolsonaro if he lost, and people are having to flee now. Will he stand
[1:34:40.460 --> 1:34:44.500]  in fight? Will the military stand against the election fraud? We know that there's a
[1:34:44.500 --> 1:34:49.100]  lot of evidence of that coming out that I'm going to show some of the viewers here in
[1:34:49.100 --> 1:34:53.060]  the moment. It was only one region where he lost and it was overwhelmingly just like we
[1:34:53.060 --> 1:34:57.860]  saw here in the last election, but you got demonized. Stop the steel leader Ali Alexander
[1:34:57.860 --> 1:35:01.500]  calls for military coup in Brazil to intervene in the presidential election. But when I read
[1:35:01.500 --> 1:35:06.820]  your quotes, you didn't say that, Ali. So what's really going on?
[1:35:06.820 --> 1:35:11.260]  Yeah, it's quite amazing, right? Because here you have a headline that doesn't really match
[1:35:11.260 --> 1:35:15.420]  the story and certainly doesn't match the source material, which you can find at my
[1:35:15.420 --> 1:35:20.180]  telegram and my true social account and, you know, gab and all the other social networks
[1:35:20.180 --> 1:35:25.140]  that haven't kicked me off. These are patriot networks. But all I called for is what Brazil's
[1:35:25.140 --> 1:35:31.380]  constitution allows and really compels. We don't understand it here in America, but because
[1:35:31.380 --> 1:35:38.260]  the judiciary and socialists and Marxists and other military coups have happened in
[1:35:38.260 --> 1:35:44.780]  South America, it's developed very differently. And the Brazilian constitution allows and
[1:35:44.780 --> 1:35:50.060]  gives the military kind of oversight power at balancing the checks and the balances between
[1:35:50.060 --> 1:35:55.580]  the various branches of government, for example, even have like a court system there that has
[1:35:55.580 --> 1:36:01.540]  a military arm, a Victorian guard of sorts. And so what we have is that the national military
[1:36:01.540 --> 1:36:07.100]  there needs to conduct an audit. Apparently they've already done a report on the previous
[1:36:07.100 --> 1:36:11.260]  of the first round of election. This was round two, and they haven't released it yet. And
[1:36:11.260 --> 1:36:17.340]  so all I called for was a simple audit. And that is that the AP, the Associated Press
[1:36:17.340 --> 1:36:23.700]  and you know, kind of the Anglosphere's intelligence agencies, they don't get to certify elections,
[1:36:23.700 --> 1:36:29.500]  government certify elections. And that includes the military. So I called for a peaceful military
[1:36:29.500 --> 1:36:35.740]  intervention. I did not call for a military violent coup. The press knows this. And yet
[1:36:35.740 --> 1:36:40.940]  they ran it on Yahoo. They ran it on AOL. They ran it on Business Insider. And then
[1:36:40.940 --> 1:36:47.380]  they used a bot army against me as the State Department and the CIA using a bot army on
[1:36:47.380 --> 1:36:50.980]  Elon Musk's Twitter to amplify, you know, these calls.
[1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:54.700]  By the way, let me stop you. We said that years ago when Obama left state behind networks
[1:36:54.700 --> 1:36:58.980]  in there under Trump and millions in funding, they now admit that even when Trump was in
[1:36:58.980 --> 1:37:04.060]  and now under Biden, they are have the CIA and State Department coordinating with big
[1:37:04.060 --> 1:37:08.260]  tech on how to censor totally illegal.
[1:37:08.260 --> 1:37:12.380]  Totally, totally illegal. And Alex, while I was prepping for your show right before,
[1:37:12.380 --> 1:37:17.260]  I think right when I was coming live, the intercept dropped a piece. I'm telling you,
[1:37:17.260 --> 1:37:22.420]  you know, this, this lid is about to blow wide open. Okay. You know, I think that there
[1:37:22.420 --> 1:37:26.620]  need to be people like you and Pete need to be people like me who were dismissed from
[1:37:26.620 --> 1:37:31.340]  Twitter. And we tell Elon Musk, we're not looking for a financial remedy. We're simply
[1:37:31.340 --> 1:37:38.660]  looking for evidence that the government colluded with Twitter employees. We will, we will enter
[1:37:38.660 --> 1:37:44.780]  in with the new Twitter incorporated a settlement, a no cash settlement agreement in exchange
[1:37:44.780 --> 1:37:49.820]  for evidence that our government was coordinating against us. And we know that we know that
[1:37:49.820 --> 1:37:54.540]  they were, we know that DHS was involved in this, just like they were involved in Brazil.
[1:37:54.540 --> 1:37:58.140]  You know, you wouldn't believe it. And I've outlined this in my piece at the Gateway
[1:37:58.140 --> 1:38:03.660]  pundit that you didn't have mid level deputies or managers with the Biden administration
[1:38:03.660 --> 1:38:06.940]  getting involved with the Brazil election. And they've been involved for months and
[1:38:06.940 --> 1:38:13.100]  months and months. You have the CIA director. You have the secretary of defense. You had
[1:38:13.100 --> 1:38:18.580]  our national security advisors and they were threatening Brazil behind the scenes. They
[1:38:18.580 --> 1:38:23.620]  were leaking to the press and they were at conferences, effectively making sub tweets
[1:38:23.620 --> 1:38:27.380]  and overtures saying, well, Brazil is going to lose his diplomatic status. If you don't
[1:38:27.380 --> 1:38:34.260]  hand over the election to the socialist who, yeah, has promised basically to kill or arrest
[1:38:34.260 --> 1:38:39.220]  Basel in our own. So I'm very glad that the president, the legitimate president of Brazil
[1:38:39.220 --> 1:38:44.940]  has not conceded. He has met with political advisors, lawyers, and yes, he's meeting
[1:38:44.940 --> 1:38:50.580]  with the military to assess what options need to be done to safeguard constitutionally
[1:38:50.580 --> 1:38:58.980]  and peacefully. The integrity of the actual vote there in Brazil. Now, the reason obviously
[1:38:58.980 --> 1:39:01.740]  they came out and twisted what you said is they're always putting out the narrative that
[1:39:01.740 --> 1:39:05.860]  we wanted to coup on January 6 and that we're calling for coups. It was Pelosi and all the
[1:39:05.860 --> 1:39:09.380]  Democrats on the news saying, we're going to have the military remove Trump. We have
[1:39:09.380 --> 1:39:12.980]  all the Peter Strock emails. They said we're not going to accept the election if Trump
[1:39:12.980 --> 1:39:18.620]  does get elected. So they're the ones pushing violence, the mostly peaceful protest. It's
[1:39:18.620 --> 1:39:24.100]  a copy and paste like nothing I've ever seen, Alex. Not only did they for months and months
[1:39:24.100 --> 1:39:30.220]  and months, this international order put pressure on Basel and Nero, which was intended to affect
[1:39:30.220 --> 1:39:36.260]  middle of the road swing voters, right? But they also decided to subvert him with this
[1:39:36.260 --> 1:39:40.100]  narrative meme saying, well, he might do a coup. How are you going to be the head of
[1:39:40.100 --> 1:39:44.500]  state and organize a coup? How are you going to say that there's a coup when you really
[1:39:44.500 --> 1:39:49.860]  have a lawless court there in Brazil and all these elites against Basel and Nero and the
[1:39:49.860 --> 1:39:50.860]  people?
[1:39:50.860 --> 1:39:56.580]  Basel and Nero had larger rallies than Trump. They're the largest rallies I've ever seen
[1:39:56.580 --> 1:40:01.820]  in my adult life. Maybe the largest rallies ever, and he's very wildly popular. And it
[1:40:01.820 --> 1:40:06.140]  looks like, again, they use an algorithm. They use an algorithm. Maybe we'll talk about
[1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:12.860]  that next segment. All we want, all we're doing is calling for an audit. By the way,
[1:40:12.860 --> 1:40:18.620]  the Brazilian constitution says that you need your elections to be transparent. The people
[1:40:18.620 --> 1:40:19.620]  need that.
[1:40:19.620 --> 1:40:23.700]  And that's where I'm going next with Bolsonaro, or Bala Senaro, as you pronounce it correctly.
[1:40:23.700 --> 1:40:25.420]  What do you think you're going to do next?
[1:40:25.420 --> 1:40:30.780]  Well, I look, what I think that he needs to do is he needs to choose not to die. He needs
[1:40:30.780 --> 1:40:35.100]  to choose not to be arrested. And if he has the support of the military, I think that
[1:40:35.100 --> 1:40:41.260]  the military does need to do whatever they need to do to basically freeze the country
[1:40:41.260 --> 1:40:46.460]  for a week or two, bring in international auditors, bring in American auditors, bring
[1:40:46.460 --> 1:40:47.460]  in voters.
[1:40:47.460 --> 1:40:49.940]  Well, sure. Just like, just like Venezuela, the communists get in this time, they're never
[1:40:49.940 --> 1:40:52.500]  going to have a real election again.
[1:40:52.500 --> 1:40:57.580]  Never. Never. And they're going to kill and arrest opposition leaders. I mean, what we're
[1:40:57.580 --> 1:41:03.300]  watching is actually a coup. Actually a coup against the Brazilian people, against sovereign
[1:41:03.300 --> 1:41:08.620]  states. They want who, they want the world economic form, they want the UN to have control
[1:41:08.620 --> 1:41:14.300]  over Brazil and take away the one bright light in South America. And I think that this positions
[1:41:14.300 --> 1:41:16.500]  us very, very, very poorly going forward.
[1:41:16.500 --> 1:41:19.980]  And by the way, you're not just saying that the UN is hopping mad that he wouldn't do
[1:41:19.980 --> 1:41:25.820]  forced injections and keep the lockdowns going. So they're trying to get war crime charges
[1:41:25.820 --> 1:41:29.340]  against him for crimes against humanity.
[1:41:29.340 --> 1:41:33.180]  It's entirely possible. It's entirely, you know, what their agenda is. And they've said
[1:41:33.180 --> 1:41:37.740]  it and they're bragging about it. Just like after the 2020 election in Time magazine, they
[1:41:37.740 --> 1:41:42.080]  said, Oh, we, we fortified the election. We fortified the election claims that they had
[1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:46.780]  previously said that we were conspiracies for believing, right? This arrangement between
[1:41:46.780 --> 1:41:52.820]  a county level bureaucrats, NGOs, the press and all of them, they bragged about it in
[1:41:52.820 --> 1:41:58.220]  Time magazine. Well, they just did it in foreign policy magazine. Now, three days ago with
[1:41:58.220 --> 1:42:03.020]  the Brazilian election, the Biden team is bragging and bragging about interfering with
[1:42:03.020 --> 1:42:08.220]  the election. And Alex, again, there's these weird things happening with the winner. Again,
[1:42:08.220 --> 1:42:15.540]  just like we saw in America, Lula has small rallies, Boston narrow has large rallies.
[1:42:15.540 --> 1:42:20.860]  And then we see that there's violence in the street by the winning party. Why are there's
[1:42:20.860 --> 1:42:26.820]  these BLM Antifa like looting and arson's happening? If they're guy one, there's these
[1:42:26.820 --> 1:42:33.540]  powerful videos of jail cells and prisons with them screaming Lula's name. And so it's
[1:42:33.540 --> 1:42:41.620]  a very dark day for sovereign states, for, for free citizens and, you know, actual elections
[1:42:41.620 --> 1:42:42.620]  that matter.
[1:42:42.620 --> 1:42:47.340]  All right, Ali Alexander, let's look at US elections only eight days away. When we return
[1:42:47.340 --> 1:42:52.820]  one of the smartest political analysts out there, Ali Alexander, I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[1:42:52.820 --> 1:43:00.820]  Tomorrow's news today, Ali Alexander.org. Once a tragedy reaches a level of national
[1:43:00.820 --> 1:43:07.460]  significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in
[1:43:07.460 --> 1:43:09.420]  any way that they deemed fit.
[1:43:09.420 --> 1:43:13.260]  The first amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away your ability
[1:43:13.260 --> 1:43:16.460]  to speak freely. So they're going to go from Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go
[1:43:16.460 --> 1:43:18.940]  for Steve Bannon, or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[1:43:18.940 --> 1:43:23.100]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew that we're planning
[1:43:23.100 --> 1:43:27.060]  all of this. And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done
[1:43:27.060 --> 1:43:30.740]  it without your support. And now because we've been so successful warning the population
[1:43:30.740 --> 1:43:34.820]  of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one, when it comes to the global
[1:43:34.820 --> 1:43:39.060]  agenda. That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars
[1:43:39.060 --> 1:43:42.940]  has been because of your past support. So I salute you and I thank you. And I ask you

[1:48:41.260 --> 1:48:46.860]  in to the domestic side the diesel running out on the 19th. The positioning what are
[1:48:46.860 --> 1:48:53.580]  they positioning us for all the numbers I'm seeing showed blood bath the Democrats. What
[1:48:53.580 --> 1:49:00.460]  is your intel and also your discernment telling you Ali Alexander. Yeah so you know this cycle
[1:49:00.460 --> 1:49:06.180]  is interesting as you pointed out you know you and I have faced a tremendous a law fair
[1:49:06.180 --> 1:49:10.940]  by the Biden administration and our federal government and so this is the first cycle
[1:49:10.940 --> 1:49:17.220]  in my career where I'm not actually working a race and it's a little bittersweet but it
[1:49:17.220 --> 1:49:21.700]  also means that I'm not pressing my sources in the more than 35 states that I've worked
[1:49:21.700 --> 1:49:29.860]  in as as much as I would during a normal cycle right I used to make for my patrons on election
[1:49:29.860 --> 1:49:33.900]  night worksheet and I'm not doing that this midterm but what I will tell you is that I
[1:49:33.900 --> 1:49:39.300]  did put up a piece at the American spectator three and a half weeks ago that said that
[1:49:39.300 --> 1:49:45.580]  the red wave was stunted well on the eve in the of the prospect of a world war three
[1:49:45.580 --> 1:49:53.100]  and the Saudis intervening and and and and effectively swatting down Joe Biden's attempt
[1:49:53.100 --> 1:49:58.180]  to rig the midterm elections by artificially lowering the gas prices and said the gas prices
[1:49:58.180 --> 1:50:03.940]  went up all undecided started breaking for the Republicans polling flooded that literally
[1:50:03.940 --> 1:50:09.140]  the day after I published my piece that all the red waves shrinking the red wave came back
[1:50:09.140 --> 1:50:14.300]  and that wasn't due to GOP leaders that was actually due to the information networks like
[1:50:14.300 --> 1:50:22.300]  info wars like gab like truth social like telegram like the folks on getter and why did the Saudi
[1:50:22.300 --> 1:50:28.860]  slap down Biden well I think that the Saudis do not want a democrat controlled DC quite
[1:50:28.860 --> 1:50:36.280]  frankly listen to you yeah so I mean I effectively I think that you know instead of artificially
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:42.820]  lowering the prices of gas for the Bidens you know that the Biden administration and
[1:50:42.820 --> 1:50:47.220]  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are tearing apart this world you know it's only a matter
[1:50:47.220 --> 1:50:52.500]  of time before Taiwan falls and I'm I'm pretty confident that Taiwan is going to fall we're
[1:50:52.500 --> 1:50:58.900]  going to see a false flag endorsed by the Western world that that so linsky does and I don't
[1:50:58.900 --> 1:51:05.380]  think that the Saudis think that they can be as prosperous in a world that is split between
[1:51:05.380 --> 1:51:09.660]  allies and axis again and what you said is so key because take Trump he made the US the
[1:51:09.660 --> 1:51:15.820]  number one energy exporter overnight stood up to the Saudis made them lower prices but
[1:51:15.820 --> 1:51:20.460]  they respected that because they saw overall global prosperity they respected someone actually
[1:51:20.460 --> 1:51:26.260]  talking to him as equals instead of all the sneakiness and manipulation of the Obama you
[1:51:26.260 --> 1:51:33.220]  know whole new world order system that's exactly right Alex and he built a win-win not only
[1:51:33.220 --> 1:51:38.220]  did the Saudi royal family start diversifying some of their investments they put a lot of
[1:51:38.220 --> 1:51:43.900]  a lot of money in the United States they normal more normalized relationships with with other
[1:51:43.900 --> 1:51:48.420]  countries so they bet on America and I'm not lionizing it's true they bet on America and
[1:51:48.420 --> 1:51:54.500]  now they see Biden betting against their investment they're pissed yeah they are pissed and so
[1:51:54.500 --> 1:51:58.620]  you know I mean imagine this when you're not allowed to export oil to half the world or
[1:51:58.620 --> 1:52:03.220]  you're in these agreements to track down terror funding and then the Biden administration is
[1:52:03.220 --> 1:52:08.180]  actually going to use that to hurt you know Russia and hurt other countries that are taking
[1:52:08.180 --> 1:52:14.060]  a neutral stance towards with the conflict that's happening in a Ukraine civil war and
[1:52:14.060 --> 1:52:19.980]  their or their war with Russia so you know it's it's a complicated world out there right
[1:52:19.980 --> 1:52:24.500]  now and I always tell people look you know none of these countries are my brothers I'm
[1:52:24.500 --> 1:52:29.900]  America first but where we can find allies for get any given amount of time I'm gonna
[1:52:29.900 --> 1:52:33.700]  look for allies that's why I'm passionate about what's happening in Brazil that's why
[1:52:33.700 --> 1:52:40.140]  I look at the Saudis as allies right now I'm glad frankly for example like Israel there
[1:52:40.140 --> 1:52:44.820]  they're bright you know although they're on this Ukraine narrative they're not giving
[1:52:44.820 --> 1:52:50.180]  Ukraine the weapons that you Ukraine wants and thereby it's not escalating the conflict
[1:52:50.180 --> 1:52:54.500]  I was about to say they see where the escalation goes like Netanyahu was on TV last week he
[1:52:54.500 --> 1:52:59.860]  said this leads to nuclear war this has got to stop even the Pope says that yeah even
[1:52:59.860 --> 1:53:05.340]  the Pope says that and Putin has reached out to the Pope and he wants to do some mediation
[1:53:05.340 --> 1:53:08.900]  with the Pope and and I think that there's a tremendous opportunity look I'm not a fan
[1:53:08.900 --> 1:53:13.580]  of the Pope I'm not a fan of what Ukraine is doing I'm not you know I'm not I'm not
[1:53:13.580 --> 1:53:17.940]  a Putin shield but what's happening is so bad that even Israel and the Pope don't want
[1:53:17.940 --> 1:53:23.460]  this exactly and so like I think that there are some nefarious players like the Pope
[1:53:23.460 --> 1:53:28.660]  and like Israel but look we all got to be rolling together and everyone is standing against
[1:53:28.660 --> 1:53:32.900]  the Biden administration and that's a good thing when our when our opponents and our
[1:53:32.900 --> 1:53:36.660]  enemies and people that we don't normally get along with are standing and saying you
[1:53:36.660 --> 1:53:42.700]  know what the Biden regime is effectively illegitimate on the world stage that is good
[1:53:42.700 --> 1:53:45.860]  for the American people it's going to be good for us in the midterms.
[1:53:45.860 --> 1:53:50.020]  No I agree so what were the globalists thinking doing this because everything they're touching
[1:53:50.020 --> 1:53:52.220]  turns to crap now.
[1:53:52.220 --> 1:53:57.300]  I think you you hit it two segments ago it causes them to double down and what we really
[1:53:57.300 --> 1:54:01.780]  want and this is this is my theory I'm curious about yours is is I've always been under this
[1:54:01.780 --> 1:54:07.140]  since 2020 is that we must spiritually defeat them we must politically defeat them and and
[1:54:07.140 --> 1:54:13.140]  we have other options if necessary but aren't aren't options right now and what that means
[1:54:13.140 --> 1:54:18.140]  is that then they go away for 50 years or they go away for a hundred years and then
[1:54:18.140 --> 1:54:23.300]  they reimplement their plan and so I think we have a real chance Alex at pushing away
[1:54:23.300 --> 1:54:29.020]  the globalist for a century and this this next 10 years really determines a lot this
[1:54:29.020 --> 1:54:34.900]  next 10 years determines the next millennia for the world the baby boom in Africa the
[1:54:34.900 --> 1:54:41.140]  the the the conflict between India and China I mean this really really is the most pivotal
[1:54:41.140 --> 1:54:45.620]  decade in again like I said you know what's going to be a millennial totally agree what
[1:54:45.620 --> 1:54:51.340]  else is on your radar well look I think that I am concerned about the fraud though Republicans
[1:54:51.340 --> 1:54:56.820]  have not in any red state taken out the Dominion machines I would have done that if I was an
[1:54:56.820 --> 1:55:02.020]  elected Republican or if I was the RNC chair unfortunately Trump endorsed all of these
[1:55:02.020 --> 1:55:07.220]  people and so these people aren't serving the public Trump has to kind of go along to
[1:55:07.220 --> 1:55:12.980]  keep allies because he's being persecuted in Pennsylvania they're sending out ballots
[1:55:12.980 --> 1:55:16.380]  they're sending out double ballots in some cases a registered voters who don't even live
[1:55:16.380 --> 1:55:22.700]  there in Nevada they've codified the pandemic rules and so there are drop-off boxes and
[1:55:22.700 --> 1:55:27.340]  universal mailing of registered voters I think that that's going to put us two or three points
[1:55:27.340 --> 1:55:31.860]  behind what we're currently polling and we're only point polling in that US Senate seat there
[1:55:31.860 --> 1:55:36.700]  two points ahead I think they'll in Nevada they'll give us the governor's race which
[1:55:36.700 --> 1:55:42.940]  I'm not a fan of that Rhino but they they'll try to take away the US Senate seat so there
[1:55:42.940 --> 1:55:50.020]  might be some disappointment on on on election night but I think that we'll see Herschel
[1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:57.780]  Walker in Georgia outperform his polling we're safe in Ohio I'm not a fan of Dr. Oz and personally
[1:55:57.780 --> 1:56:03.020]  I wouldn't vote for him but I understand that a lot of that I'll say this Federman is worse
[1:56:03.020 --> 1:56:08.860]  Federman is a Satanist and so you know Patriots have a tough choice to make there so I think
[1:56:08.860 --> 1:56:13.140]  that Dr. Oz will also perform by the way Federman really is a Satanist I've looked into him
[1:56:13.140 --> 1:56:18.260]  that guy is super evil right and I and I and I was the first person to say it even though
[1:56:18.260 --> 1:56:22.020]  people are trying to take credit for it now they don't plan to have him serve out a full
[1:56:22.020 --> 1:56:28.420]  term they plan to give his seat to his wife who's even worse than he is and so we're watching
[1:56:28.420 --> 1:56:32.100]  a full think about this you know I was again I was on the phone with our mutual friend
[1:56:32.100 --> 1:56:37.740]  Jason Jones last night and I said we've now live in democracies without the consent of
[1:56:37.740 --> 1:56:42.180]  the people what is that he said well it's not a democracy at all you know it's a it's
[1:56:42.180 --> 1:56:46.300]  a meme it's effectively a meme and all we're calling for I think you and I are calling
[1:56:46.300 --> 1:56:50.540]  for is you know if the public wants to go left or the public wants to go right there
[1:56:50.540 --> 1:56:55.100]  ought to be a fair debate not a center debate not a deep platform debate we exchange the
[1:56:55.100 --> 1:57:00.220]  ideas we go to the ballot box it's transparent we're able to audit and then we go that way
[1:57:00.220 --> 1:57:04.700]  and we see if it works and if it doesn't then we go another way that's all we want
[1:57:04.700 --> 1:57:09.660]  all in a constitutional republic Ali Alexander do five more minutes with us I got two quick
[1:57:09.660 --> 1:57:14.100]  questions on the other side and then judge Joe Brown's coming on how big is this Pelosi

[1:57:21.460 --> 1:57:26.580]  mean and then to Sanis Trump with this growing riff is that real or what do you see on that

[2:00:07.980 --> 2:00:12.060]  final segment of the alexander judge your browns coming up all you heard my questions
[2:00:12.060 --> 2:00:16.980]  for the break this policy situation what do you really think is going on there and separately
[2:00:16.980 --> 2:00:22.660]  this whole trump santa's left what's happening there yeah I think with the policy situation
[2:00:22.660 --> 2:00:31.640]  we're seeing an exaggerated hopes this is an attempt to obviously the republicans as
[2:00:31.640 --> 2:00:37.820]  domestic terrorist or natural alien or whatever never mind that you know because we were going
[2:00:37.820 --> 2:00:44.900]  to appeal to obama care they they had a democrat activist a democrat pain volunteer go down
[2:00:44.900 --> 2:00:50.380]  and gun down steve scholesan in his pocket he had the names of the house freedom caucus
[2:00:50.380 --> 2:00:55.540]  most conservative members of congress never mind that you know that was a thing so I think
[2:00:55.540 --> 2:00:59.980]  that this is a hoax I'm looking forward to digging into it I've talked to some other
[2:00:59.980 --> 2:01:06.940]  people there's going to be foyer request that obtain the body cam footage and so I'm following
[2:01:06.940 --> 2:01:11.580]  this pretty closely you know in public there's great reporting at info wars dot com great
[2:01:11.580 --> 2:01:17.220]  reporting at the gateway planet dot com and you know there's questions about this assailants
[2:01:17.220 --> 2:01:22.100]  this alleged assailants the authenticity of the accusation that he's responsible for these
[2:01:22.100 --> 2:01:25.660]  blogs that put up so I don't think we really know what happened except for I think it's
[2:01:25.660 --> 2:01:30.900]  too late Nancy I think quite frankly I you know I hate to say this the american public
[2:01:30.900 --> 2:01:36.000]  doesn't care about the domestic violence that's happening because it's mainly been left wing
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:40.580]  quite frankly and so the left normalized it and now they're trying to accuse us of it
[2:01:40.580 --> 2:01:44.820]  while people are paying a hundred a hundred and ten dollars to fill up their tanks they're
[2:01:44.820 --> 2:01:49.260]  looking at the prospect of a of a of a world war three and getting you know supplements
[2:01:49.260 --> 2:01:54.580]  to make sure that they could survive you know radiation poisoning so quite frankly people
[2:01:54.580 --> 2:02:00.540]  don't care about domestic disputes or you know whatever is actually happening there and so
[2:02:00.540 --> 2:02:05.820]  I think that it was a hit and a miss it was a wrap up smear by Nancy Pelosi that's my
[2:02:05.820 --> 2:02:11.020]  view on the Pelosi situation what about the reports that are all over the news of imminent
[2:02:11.020 --> 2:02:15.820]  indictment of Trump after the midterms and how does that feed into the sands don't buy
[2:02:15.820 --> 2:02:22.020]  it I you know I it's kind of weird just like right before the midterm or right before the
[2:02:22.020 --> 2:02:26.980]  2020 election I went to my viewers and I said for the first time ever right as someone who
[2:02:26.980 --> 2:02:31.900]  doesn't guess but tries to forecast events or have no opinion my head is telling me something
[2:02:31.900 --> 2:02:37.740]  than my different than my spirit and this is again the second time for it ever to happen
[2:02:37.740 --> 2:02:42.660]  you know my head for some reason is telling me that Donald Trump will not be indicted that
[2:02:42.660 --> 2:02:47.540]  the deep state overplayed its hand and yet my gut you know where maybe there's a little
[2:02:47.540 --> 2:02:52.700]  bit of fear says he will be indicted but I think that this recent leak is actually a
[2:02:52.700 --> 2:02:58.220]  push an internal push by mid-level managers or investigators to try to get him indicted
[2:02:58.220 --> 2:03:05.060]  and and their desperation is actually a good sign for Donald Trump look I've said this
[2:03:05.060 --> 2:03:08.820]  you know I was talking to you about this last year when a lot of people are telling me like
[2:03:08.820 --> 2:03:12.060]  oh this is going to go away soon this is going to go away soon I said I think this is the
[2:03:12.060 --> 2:03:16.380]  next two or three years of our life and I strongly suspect that they're trying to set
[2:03:16.380 --> 2:03:21.860]  up Donald Trump for either a process crime or process crime and then an immediate pardon
[2:03:21.860 --> 2:03:27.860]  by Joe Biden to taint him and so we're looking at a very complex international coup whether
[2:03:27.860 --> 2:03:33.660]  it's in Brazil whether it's in the United States whether it's in you know the UK we're
[2:03:33.660 --> 2:03:37.900]  seeing a lot of a lot of people with their grubby hands into it and so you know I'm praying
[2:03:37.900 --> 2:03:42.260]  that Donald Trump isn't indicted because of what it will do in breaking this country it
[2:03:42.260 --> 2:03:47.060]  will be worse than Watergate it'll be frankly worse than the Civil War and I say that as
[2:03:47.060 --> 2:03:51.620]  a black man and and we can't afford for it if they're going to beat Donald Trump beat
[2:03:51.620 --> 2:03:57.060]  him fair and square and you know Ron DeSantis and his donors they're hedging they're saying
[2:03:57.060 --> 2:04:00.300]  well there's a good chance that Donald Trump is going to get indicted so why don't we wait
[2:04:00.300 --> 2:04:04.940]  in the wings I think this is sacrificing a little bit of part of unity but months and
[2:04:04.940 --> 2:04:08.700]  months and months ago I told you look I hope that these men sharpen each other I hope that
[2:04:08.700 --> 2:04:14.060]  Donald Trump sharpens DeSantis's critique against the deep state and I hope that DeSantis
[2:04:14.060 --> 2:04:18.340]  sharpens Donald Trump on these poison jabs.
[2:04:18.340 --> 2:04:24.020]  Perfectly said absolutely superb that is exactly my view of it and all I know is the
[2:04:24.020 --> 2:04:30.460]  general public's the real arbiter here or or the real unknown the people are engaged
[2:04:30.460 --> 2:04:34.140]  and informed and don't take this election for granted and get out there and vote and
[2:04:34.140 --> 2:04:35.780]  expose corruption we're going to win.

[2:06:08.980 --> 2:06:28.220]  I've seen the Democratic Party playing down fentanyl which we know in the blue cities
[2:06:28.220 --> 2:06:32.500]  I've witnessed it for myself in LA and other areas they're telling the police to stand
[2:06:32.500 --> 2:06:38.300]  down on it's killing over a hundred thousand people a year we know of and here's Jimmy
[2:06:38.300 --> 2:06:43.340]  Kimmel making jokes about fentanyl and making fun of Herschel Walker acting like fentanyl
[2:06:43.340 --> 2:07:09.740]  is no big deal this makes me want to throw up.
[2:07:09.740 --> 2:07:17.500]  So last night Jimmy Kimmel did a skit on kids and people have passed away died from fentanyl
[2:07:17.500 --> 2:07:25.900]  so distasteful people are cancelled on TV for ridiculous things this guy is joking
[2:07:25.900 --> 2:07:34.220]  about a pandemic epidemic of deaths in this country by fentanyl in this country and I
[2:07:34.220 --> 2:07:41.500]  don't see where the humor is from it's disgusting when he's done what he said there's somebody
[2:07:41.500 --> 2:07:45.180]  that should be cancelled talking about the death of my daughter and other people that
[2:07:45.180 --> 2:07:50.900]  are suffering in this country for the last couple of years with 300 deaths or better
[2:07:50.900 --> 2:08:16.380]  a day thanks everybody I appreciate it.
[2:08:16.380 --> 2:08:21.380]  Now let's talk about evil they knew that the covid shots would erase your immune system
[2:08:21.380 --> 2:08:27.460]  give you heart attacks and make you get sick from covid everything they said was a lie
[2:08:27.460 --> 2:08:32.020]  but how long has this been going on if you go back to the two anthrax rounds they did
[2:08:32.020 --> 2:08:39.540]  the 90s and in 2000 it conservatively congress found killed over 40,000 people that was a
[2:08:39.540 --> 2:08:43.500]  beta test to see if this criminal group in our government could kill that many people
[2:08:43.500 --> 2:08:48.540]  and then get away with it and since they got away with it now they've scaled up with the
[2:08:48.540 --> 2:08:54.780]  shots and have killed conservatively 10 million people and it's going to kill more but let's
[2:08:54.780 --> 2:08:59.340]  talk about chemotherapy that almost never works and almost always brings the cancer
[2:08:59.340 --> 2:09:06.740]  back and that the doctors get kickbacks from well the doctors also got kickbacks if they
[2:09:06.740 --> 2:09:10.900]  said you were a covid patient if they put you on a ventilator they got 50 plus thousand
[2:09:10.900 --> 2:09:18.260]  dollars it's a bounty to kill people and they're just ratcheting up and expanding the level
[2:09:18.260 --> 2:09:24.340]  of these operations to have the institutions be mercenary to carry out these crimes and
[2:09:24.340 --> 2:09:28.700]  have the doctors and scientists who know covid was a fraud made in the lab who know the shots
[2:09:28.700 --> 2:09:34.300]  are deadly go along with all of this and be corrupted and now as it all comes out they're
[2:09:34.300 --> 2:09:39.380]  involved the cover up further corrupting them there's a club of a well-known doctor I've
[2:09:39.380 --> 2:09:43.820]  interviewed many times laying out what really happens with chemotherapy about cancer a little
[2:09:43.820 --> 2:09:52.100]  bit various types out there what are some of the things that you've seen in terms of
[2:09:52.100 --> 2:09:55.980]  your patients and what some of the things that you've been able to do a better thing
[2:09:55.980 --> 2:10:02.780]  to talk about in relationship to you I will talk about that right a better thing to talk
[2:10:02.780 --> 2:10:08.660]  about however is their relationship between profits and cancer in the United States and
[2:10:08.660 --> 2:10:14.620]  there was a study that was published I believe it was in 1994 it was a 12 year program 12
[2:10:14.620 --> 2:10:21.580]  year study they looked at adults who had developed cancer as an adult not childhood cancer but
[2:10:21.580 --> 2:10:27.020]  adult cancer right this is the main types of cancer that we get here in the United States
[2:10:27.020 --> 2:10:31.580]  they did a meta-analysis of these people all around the world who developed cancer as adults
[2:10:31.580 --> 2:10:36.780]  for 12 years and were treated with chemo and they looked at the results and they published
[2:10:36.780 --> 2:10:47.580]  the results in the Journal of Clinical Oncology and the results 97% of the time chemotherapy
[2:10:47.580 --> 2:10:54.940]  does not work 97% of the time it doesn't work so why is it still used it's one reason and
[2:10:54.940 --> 2:11:01.860]  one reason only money if you go to a medical doctor at MD with a sinus infection and that
[2:11:01.860 --> 2:11:10.900]  doctor prescribes an antibiotic he gets no financial kickback now if he prescribes 5000
[2:11:10.900 --> 2:11:15.540]  you know of that antibiotic in one month the drug company that makes it might send him
[2:11:15.540 --> 2:11:22.500]  to Cancun for a conference right he gets no direct remuneration it's not with with chemo
[2:11:22.500 --> 2:11:29.540]  therapeutic drugs it's different chemo therapeutic drugs are the only classification of drugs
[2:11:29.540 --> 2:11:35.620]  that the prescribing doctor gets a direct cut up so if your doctor prescribes chemotherapy
[2:11:35.620 --> 2:11:41.340]  for you here's how it goes more or less the doctor buys it from the pharmaceutical company
[2:11:41.340 --> 2:11:51.300]  for $5000 sells it to the patient for $12000 insurance pays $9000 and the doctor pockets
[2:11:51.300 --> 2:11:59.340]  the $4000 difference and there ought to be a lot the only reason chemotherapy is used
[2:11:59.340 --> 2:12:08.620]  is because doctors make money from period it doesn't work 97% of the time if Ford Motor
[2:12:08.620 --> 2:12:14.420]  Company made an automobile that exploded 97% of the time would they still be in business
[2:12:14.420 --> 2:12:26.620]  no this is the tip of the iceberg of the control that the pharmaceutical industry has on us
[2:12:26.620 --> 2:12:32.420]  we most people have no idea of this at all now I wrote a book it's called the MD emperor
[2:12:32.420 --> 2:12:41.020]  has no clothes right in my book I have a bulleted list of 10 questions that every cancer patient
[2:12:41.020 --> 2:12:48.540]  should ask their doctor 10 questions I've had patients kicked out literally kicked out
[2:12:48.540 --> 2:12:53.900]  of the oncologist's office because the doctor was peoed that the patient was asking them
[2:12:53.900 --> 2:12:59.580]  these questions these are just common sense questions cancer treatment in the United States
[2:12:59.580 --> 2:13:07.860]  we have lost the war on cancer we have lost the war on cancer why because cancer is not
[2:13:07.860 --> 2:13:14.980]  a reductionistic phenomenon cancer is a holistic phenomenon when you try to bring a reductionistic
[2:13:14.980 --> 2:13:20.820]  methodology like drugs and surgery to bear on a holistic phenomenon you will completely
[2:13:20.820 --> 2:13:27.420]  miss the boat each and every time you cannot do it medical doctors are like color blind
[2:13:27.420 --> 2:13:35.140]  art critics they can see that that's a boat they can see the black and white outline but
[2:13:35.140 --> 2:13:41.500]  they're completely blind to all of the colors and textures that make up the substance of
[2:13:41.500 --> 2:13:48.380]  this thing there's no difference with cancer the reason that people get cancer in the United
[2:13:48.380 --> 2:13:53.060]  States and the reason that we have completely lousy outcomes is because medical doctors
[2:13:53.060 --> 2:13:59.940]  are driving the research bus when women get together and do a 5k run for breast cancer
[2:13:59.940 --> 2:14:03.780]  all of that money do you think any of that money goes to nutritional research do you
[2:14:03.780 --> 2:14:08.180]  think any of that money goes to homeopathic research acupuncture or traditional Chinese
[2:14:08.180 --> 2:14:15.060]  medicine or naturopathic research no all of it goes to drugs and surgery which do not
[2:14:15.060 --> 2:14:23.980]  work now why aren't those women running for selenium if every girl in this country took
[2:14:23.980 --> 2:14:30.100]  200 micrograms of selenium in one generation we'd eliminate breast cancer by 82% that's
[2:14:30.100 --> 2:14:36.740]  a big number why aren't we doing that because medicine in the United States is a for-profit
[2:14:36.740 --> 2:14:44.660]  industry and most people are completely unaware of this and most people bow down to the altar
[2:14:44.660 --> 2:14:52.180]  of MD directed high tech I've interviewed him in years I'm going to get him back on
[2:14:52.180 --> 2:15:00.340]  so they're just upping the scale of the cancer industry and all these other scams they run
[2:15:00.340 --> 2:15:07.220]  with COVID of course they know the shot doesn't work except it makes you sicker it's deliberate
[2:15:07.220 --> 2:15:10.380]  does some of the doctors not know what they're part of yeah and the ones that do know what's
[2:15:10.380 --> 2:15:16.260]  happening like Dr. Peter McCullough who's done 600 major studies run FDA major trials
[2:15:16.260 --> 2:15:20.380]  one of the top cardiologists in America they're trying to strip him of his medical license
[2:15:20.380 --> 2:15:25.860]  because he said the shots won't work and they're dangerous which is all proven correct but they
[2:15:25.860 --> 2:15:29.660]  can't have him celebrated they can't have him proven right no they've got to punish
[2:15:29.660 --> 2:15:36.660]  him and say the doctor that says this is bad is being sued and lost his medical license
[2:15:36.660 --> 2:15:41.100]  they got you have to rally around the people the enemies attacking and we've been proven
[2:15:41.100 --> 2:15:46.340]  right Dr. Peter McCullough is flying in Saturday we're in a special two hour broadcast with

[2:21:06.340 --> 2:21:11.060]  wild but it's what we knew was going on but it's all being externalized it's not being
[2:21:11.060 --> 2:21:16.580]  hidden anymore we know obama put several billion dollars in a stay behind network when trump
[2:21:16.580 --> 2:21:22.940]  got elected countering far disinformation propaganda act which was then used by the agencies domestically
[2:21:22.940 --> 2:21:27.820]  to attack the america people and censor and control and that it was democrat deep state
[2:21:27.820 --> 2:21:36.100]  stay behind groups that then coordinated all the attacks and disinformation election fraud
[2:21:36.100 --> 2:21:41.700]  that we then witnessed after that and we know the groups like g2 that's the so-called international
[2:21:41.700 --> 2:21:46.540]  credit agency based in boston and others that have been running the establishment of a secret
[2:21:46.540 --> 2:21:56.620]  social credit score operation and then now it's coming out that under obama and even under
[2:21:56.620 --> 2:22:01.100]  trump because he wasn't running it it was a rogue group and then now under biden's expanded
[2:22:01.100 --> 2:22:08.380]  that they have the state department the cia the big banks with legacy media they're seen as the
[2:22:08.380 --> 2:22:13.500]  professionals surveilling even your private messages and email if you're on google mail or
[2:22:13.500 --> 2:22:18.940]  using twitter or facebook or instagram you name it so they're illegally spying on you not just
[2:22:18.940 --> 2:22:26.540]  the nsa but they're illegally spying on you and then they farm out to the minions at the big tech
[2:22:26.540 --> 2:22:33.500]  companies who to go and shut down it's incredible so now the intercept just came out with a huge
[2:22:33.500 --> 2:22:43.980]  bombshell report truth cops with these foyer requests that were honored and in it what's going on you
[2:22:43.980 --> 2:22:52.380]  have the department of homeland security working with legacy dinosaur media and other federal

[2:23:08.620 --> 2:23:14.540]  scandal beyond anything ever known no wonder they're so arrogant because they've got a bunch of
[2:23:14.540 --> 2:23:20.380]  leftist sjw's that went and got their college degree and were invoked into the cult of absolute

[2:24:28.620 --> 2:24:35.420]  technocracy run by big banks and they're here to hurt us and they will if we don't recognize
[2:24:35.420 --> 2:24:39.980]  what criminals they are and completely break with them and realize how deep we are in this
[2:24:41.260 --> 2:24:47.500]  left-wing eu commissioner warns musk the bird will fly by our rules threatens criminal and

[2:25:18.060 --> 2:25:24.940]  count of the bag about three years ago they had uh umpty dumpy up there brian stelter on his weekend
[2:25:24.940 --> 2:25:31.340]  show reliable sources with oliver d'arcy and they said yes we've banned him on all these things but
[2:25:31.340 --> 2:25:36.700]  we're checking with facebook to see if he has a whatsapp and to see if he's using it next week
[2:25:36.700 --> 2:25:42.380]  they go well we found out all shows is not a whatsapp so they call up facebook facebook goes

[2:25:50.540 --> 2:25:58.220]  they want that's who they are and they think they're going to beat us they have all the money and all
[2:25:58.220 --> 2:26:04.300]  the systems but everybody hates them everybody knows they're scum so i want to play this clip
[2:26:04.300 --> 2:26:11.020]  but i've got to get this living legend back on the show soon g Edward griffin who was very successful
[2:26:11.020 --> 2:26:14.780]  in business heard about the new world order didn't believe in investigative found that was true
[2:26:14.780 --> 2:26:21.100]  and in the 60s and on made films and best-selling books that we stand on those shoulders today here
[2:26:21.100 --> 2:26:29.340]  he is in the 60s early 60s producing a tv program about communist documents that came out in 43
[2:26:29.340 --> 2:26:35.580]  of how they plan to call american populist anti-semitic or fascist and you hear this playbook you know
[2:26:35.580 --> 2:26:40.620]  that's the exact playbook today why do they keep running it because it's worked until now because
[2:26:40.620 --> 2:26:46.620]  we didn't warn of people about the playbook so here from the historic vault is g Edward griffin
[2:26:47.420 --> 2:26:53.900]  in 1943 the following directive was issued from party headquarters to all communists in the united
[2:26:53.900 --> 2:27:01.740]  states it read when certain obstructionists become too irritating label them after suitable
[2:27:01.740 --> 2:27:09.100]  build-ups as fascist or nazi or anti-semitic and use the prestige of anti-fascist and
[2:27:09.100 --> 2:27:15.660]  tolerance organizations to discredit them in the public mind constantly associate those who oppose
[2:27:15.660 --> 2:27:21.980]  us with those names which already have a bad smell the association will after enough repetition
[2:27:21.980 --> 2:27:32.460]  become fact in the public mind and that is exactly where we are today and they know they
[2:27:32.460 --> 2:27:38.700]  need to cut you off from god to be purely evil so there's no way you could ever turn back to the
[2:27:38.700 --> 2:27:44.060]  holy spirit and get out of their cult so the the entrance pass the ticket is to have sex with small
[2:27:44.060 --> 2:27:48.620]  children or cut their balls off cut their genitals off cut their breasts off like okay you don't want
[2:27:48.620 --> 2:27:54.300]  to screw kids at least mutilate them give them poison drugs have them induct it into a group to
[2:27:54.300 --> 2:27:59.500]  cut their genitals off so they can't have children let us murder their genetic potential and murder
[2:27:59.500 --> 2:28:05.020]  their future and and then we'll let you in the cult and once you understand that you understand
[2:28:05.020 --> 2:28:12.220]  it all someone to play a clip but I played yesterday when we come back and then the new clips where I
[2:28:12.220 --> 2:28:20.140]  said hey at least Paul Pelosi was having you know weird s&m sex with a man there were no kids there
[2:28:21.660 --> 2:28:25.820]  the police report not on one tape they go in draw guns or beat each other with hammers in their

[2:33:14.380 --> 2:33:19.980]  if you're receiving this transmission if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:33:19.980 --> 2:33:25.820]  live from austin texas you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:29.420 --> 2:33:36.140]  so the police show up late last week at one of the policy compounds in san francisco
[2:33:37.420 --> 2:33:42.700]  and they suppress what really went on there we're told them trump supporter hours after it
[2:33:42.700 --> 2:33:47.420]  happened broke in and said we're as Nancy and did all this but then we hit the 911 table already aired
[2:33:47.420 --> 2:33:53.260]  a couple times we're going to air it again and the police are like we told he knows him his name
[2:33:53.260 --> 2:33:58.940]  is david he's a friend they're in the bedroom they're in their underwear with hammers beating each
[2:33:58.940 --> 2:34:03.980]  other when the police come in that that's the police report the police press conference
[2:34:05.180 --> 2:34:10.060]  so two dudes in the bedroom in their underwear beating each other with hammers okay an unknown
[2:34:10.060 --> 2:34:17.660]  person let them in they won't say who that person is and then they go into overdrive to demonize
[2:34:17.660 --> 2:34:21.980]  anybody who threatened to sue anybody that talks about it but it's too late now there's like the
[2:34:21.980 --> 2:34:27.420]  hunter biden laptop with the rest of it so i said on the sunday show last night i said well at least
[2:34:27.420 --> 2:34:37.740]  no children were involved well paul polozzi's attacker nudist ex-lobber who the media talked to
[2:34:37.740 --> 2:34:45.260]  and got involved who he lived with for a decade is a pedophile who ran porn sites all sorts of
[2:34:45.260 --> 2:34:50.380]  weird stuff all sorts of psychedelic institutes and who got arrested for stalking and trying to
[2:34:50.380 --> 2:34:58.060]  sexually pick up 14-year-old boys and bought sex dolls for their sons to use that's david
[2:34:58.060 --> 2:35:11.180]  the papa's progressive lover so that's who he was set in the records is living with you gotta
[2:35:11.180 --> 2:35:18.060]  look into this but it's just par for the course for these people but don't worry rob riner claims
[2:35:18.060 --> 2:35:23.500]  trump directly responsible for attack on paul polozzi calls for indictment
[2:35:23.500 --> 2:35:29.420]  they're calling for you on must be arrested for questioning what's happening that's that's the
[2:35:29.420 --> 2:35:34.140]  left now they go just like alex jones sue them or arrest them you can't question anything we're
[2:35:34.140 --> 2:35:42.700]  doing and this guy is in all these photos and videos at nudist colonies where children are
[2:35:45.660 --> 2:35:52.780]  what a group of creeps and as i've said over and over again the big bad wolf doesn't come
[2:35:52.780 --> 2:35:56.220]  at the little kid is a big bad wolf in that parable children were always taught to not get
[2:35:56.220 --> 2:36:02.300]  molested or assaulted or raped or killed he dresses up like grandma the serial killer pedophile
[2:36:03.020 --> 2:36:06.620]  dresses like a woman in the famous european archetype
[2:36:09.740 --> 2:36:17.100]  and we've got all these videos in europe u k u s canada australia it's the same cult of men
[2:36:17.100 --> 2:36:22.300]  men dressed up like women going out for children at playgrounds
[2:36:23.660 --> 2:36:30.540]  as their disguise or now the new thing is as babies so here's footage grown man who identifies
[2:36:30.540 --> 2:36:36.780]  as a baby gets kicked out of a children's park approaching children i'm gonna play this clip
[2:36:38.620 --> 2:36:41.180]  because that's how they they dress as women or they dress as children
[2:36:42.940 --> 2:36:46.460]  and the argument by the left as well if you identify as a child well you can be a child
[2:36:46.460 --> 2:36:51.900]  and you heard this head of spain's cultural federal agency say well children should have
[2:36:51.900 --> 2:36:57.500]  sex with adults it's a good thing played that a month ago so this is a pedophile cult that wants
[2:36:57.500 --> 2:37:05.580]  our children but the wolf likes to dress up like a child or like a woman so they're not as threatening
[2:37:05.580 --> 2:37:10.220]  to the little girls and boys so here's the footage grown man who identifies as a baby
[2:37:10.220 --> 2:37:19.260]  gets kicked out of children's park
[2:37:21.980 --> 2:37:24.460]  wearing a diaper and a onesie
[2:37:24.460 --> 2:37:37.500]  this is something u k
[2:37:45.100 --> 2:37:46.780]  and they're told this is their identity
[2:37:46.780 --> 2:37:56.460]  and this is who they are that's this is all about but this guy is less of a threat than
[2:37:56.460 --> 2:38:00.860]  the school teachers giving bounties and the school nurses giving bounties if they convince
[2:38:00.860 --> 2:38:04.780]  your seven-year-old or five-year-old to get on the fast track having their breasts or genitals
[2:38:04.780 --> 2:38:11.260]  cut off then it's liberal and loving here's laura logan talking about why they're really coming
[2:38:11.260 --> 2:38:16.780]  after our children while they're obsessed with hurting children period that's their goal here it is
[2:38:16.780 --> 2:38:24.300]  um because one of the things i asked him was i said i don't i get it but i don't get it the
[2:38:24.300 --> 2:38:30.140]  children you just you've got to i still have i have such a problem with this you've got to explain
[2:38:30.140 --> 2:38:36.140]  this one to me and he said um well first of all you're looking at it the wrong way i said what
[2:38:36.140 --> 2:38:41.420]  do you mean and he said well they don't define children the way you do they don't define the
[2:38:41.420 --> 2:38:47.180]  world the way you do the choices that you face are not their choices right they have a they look
[2:38:47.180 --> 2:38:53.820]  at it completely differently and uh and i said well okay so how do they look at it and he said
[2:38:53.820 --> 2:39:01.980]  for them everything is defined by their one fundamental all-consuming purpose i said which
[2:39:01.980 --> 2:39:10.700]  is what he said to defeat god right because this is the moment i mean for them it's about uh the real

[2:48:25.740 --> 2:48:33.740]  not russia held and you have western powers openly talking about nuclear war and the pentagon
[2:48:33.740 --> 2:48:37.980]  last week saying well we now reserve the right for first strike in a non-nuclear conflict we'll
[2:48:37.980 --> 2:48:42.140]  hit the dark as we want with nukes which then escalates the nukes day clock up a bit further
[2:48:42.140 --> 2:48:46.620]  why are the big central banks doing this because they're losing control they know their Ponzi
[2:48:46.620 --> 2:48:52.700]  scheme is coming to an end the bubble's bursting and if anything they're bold they're planning
[2:48:52.700 --> 2:49:00.540]  even more crises to get us in line and anybody that serves this system that is predatory and
[2:49:00.540 --> 2:49:06.940]  destroying all of us is insane much of ukraine capital out power and water after new russian
[2:49:06.940 --> 2:49:11.580]  airstrikes much of ukrainian capital and the rest of countries without electricity or water
[2:49:11.580 --> 2:49:18.540]  after the latest round of major russian airstrikes today russian military announced successful
[2:49:18.540 --> 2:49:25.900]  strikes on multiple the country's vital infrastructure facilities the world's most
[2:49:25.900 --> 2:49:31.340]  heavily armed governments are becoming explicitly hostile towards one another with nuclear weapons
[2:49:32.460 --> 2:49:38.380]  a very important zero hedge article upon info wars dot com it's another headline on advice
[2:49:38.380 --> 2:49:44.300]  you asked to put nuclear capable b-52s in australia as taiwan invasion fears grow
[2:49:46.140 --> 2:49:51.500]  b-52s have a combat range of 14 000 kilometers capable of delivering both nuclear conventional
[2:49:51.500 --> 2:49:59.580]  weapons the u.s. deceptive deploy six nuclear capable 52 bombers to northern australia and
[2:49:59.580 --> 2:50:06.060]  build dedicated facilities to house them according to abc news published on monday the australian
[2:50:06.060 --> 2:50:11.020]  broadcaster current affairs program four corners revealed u.s. documents detailing an expansion
[2:50:11.020 --> 2:50:17.980]  plan for the tendal airbase south of darwin in australia's northern territory which included a
[2:50:17.980 --> 2:50:24.140]  squadron operation facility in addition to a maintenance center and parking areas of b-52s
[2:50:25.820 --> 2:50:29.500]  so that's again sleepwalking into armageddon breaking
[2:50:29.500 --> 2:50:38.140]  disaster's escalation nato to place nukes in finland on russia's border in another massive
[2:50:39.500 --> 2:50:49.740]  massive provocation in all of this let's get out of nato discontent soars across europe
[2:50:49.740 --> 2:50:55.340]  as russian sanctions backfire russian sanctions against russia have been considered a powerful
[2:50:55.340 --> 2:51:01.180]  foreign policy tool of the us of u to paralyze moscow back to the stone age through sanctions
[2:51:01.180 --> 2:51:06.060]  against moscow entirely backfired sparking the worst possible in crisis for europeans in the
[2:51:06.060 --> 2:51:14.540]  generation and now there's massive protest taking place across the continent russia has now officially
[2:51:14.540 --> 2:51:20.780]  come out and accused the british navy of destroying nord screen pipeline and they've given specific
[2:51:20.780 --> 2:51:30.300]  details of the nato-led operation but the southern border is wide open and fentanyl is flooding
[2:51:30.300 --> 2:51:34.940]  across the border the globalists don't care that china's shipping in fentanyl they love that
[2:51:34.940 --> 2:51:40.700]  what they don't like is china's not taking orders directly from them when china has been a
[2:51:42.140 --> 2:51:46.220]  project of that operation but look at this footage right now of your tv viewer this is one of the
[2:51:46.220 --> 2:51:56.460]  admitted drone attack boats loaded with explosives going towards a russian frigate you see a helicopter
[2:51:56.460 --> 2:52:02.220]  flying around shooting at it finally stopping the drone who released this footage the ukrainians
[2:52:03.260 --> 2:52:08.540]  and and why is this important they had a peace steels agreed to in july brokered by turkey
[2:52:08.540 --> 2:52:20.460]  that around that particular port they would not attack anybody's ships the russians haven't done
[2:52:20.460 --> 2:52:28.540]  that and that's the port bringing grain out 30 of the world's wheat production to the planet
[2:52:29.660 --> 2:52:34.700]  like the middle east and africa and the united states and the places that's the bread basket
[2:52:34.700 --> 2:52:41.660]  and so now they've attacked a humanitarian mission but that's okay because he's a linsky
[2:52:42.220 --> 2:52:50.220]  he can do whatever he wants whenever he wants however he wants any way they want
[2:52:51.020 --> 2:52:57.580]  and it just gets more and more insane and dangerous from then and then we just sit here
[2:52:58.780 --> 2:53:03.420]  perhaps tomorrow's just open the phones up and talk to truck drivers everybody knows diesel's
[2:53:03.420 --> 2:53:09.980]  five dollars a gallon on average but it runs out by the 19th sure there'll be a few stockpiles here
[2:53:09.980 --> 2:53:17.820]  and there but the the national capacity is gone no deserves and then they can't keep up and there
[2:53:17.820 --> 2:53:26.300]  won't be enough fuel and you will have a real lockdown because 77 percent in the latest numbers
[2:53:26.300 --> 2:53:35.420]  of all commerce is carried by 18 wheelers by major diesel trucks in this country i'd said 70
[2:53:35.420 --> 2:53:39.580]  because that was the number i saw before they looked it up today and it's increased the last
[2:53:39.580 --> 2:53:46.620]  few years so 70 plus percent they haven't upgraded our rail lines those are falling apart what is
[2:53:46.620 --> 2:53:52.460]  that going to look like and how was that allowed to happen by shutting down refineries by regulations
[2:53:52.460 --> 2:53:58.380]  biden a year ago shut down the biggest diesel refinery in the us just did it because he said
[2:53:58.380 --> 2:54:02.540]  it's part of a transition we're going to teach you how this works remember what biden said
[2:54:02.540 --> 2:54:06.780]  he said he got the clip right here maybe you guys can find it i meant to send it to you
[2:54:08.380 --> 2:54:15.500]  biden in syracuse yesterday when i took office the economy was in ruins
[2:54:15.500 --> 2:54:22.460]  no you put the economy attempted to with your lockdowns the democrats ran trumpeting along
[2:54:22.460 --> 2:54:29.100]  with it but since you got in it's gotten 10 times worse and now he's got the nerve to say it was in
[2:54:29.100 --> 2:54:40.700]  ruins but now it's strong as hell everybody knows that's a bald face lie so what are they trying to do
[2:54:40.700 --> 2:54:47.340]  create unrest create hunger create fear have new lockdowns say we'll give you money if you take
[2:54:47.340 --> 2:54:54.540]  a shot that's what this is i need to get you so poor they can dictate the terms of our surrender
[2:54:56.540 --> 2:55:04.300]  but surrendering if you knew ted bundy the famous serial killer when he pulled a gun
[2:55:04.300 --> 2:55:07.260]  on you in a parking lot and said get in the Volkswagen i'm going to take you in torture
[2:55:07.260 --> 2:55:11.580]  you for a couple weeks to death you'd fight back even though maybe had a 55th chance of not getting
[2:55:11.580 --> 2:55:15.500]  killed because you know that's the only shot you got and it's the same thing with these people
[2:55:16.300 --> 2:55:23.740]  giving in to them only makes it worse and only ensures our destruction that's why we've got to
[2:55:23.740 --> 2:55:29.420]  stand up that's why we've got to say no terrell salante always knocks out of the park he's about
[2:55:29.420 --> 2:55:35.100]  to take over for an hour and then no one shroyer the cuck destroyer will take over three p.m central
[2:55:35.100 --> 2:55:41.100]  remember the new older hates this broadcast and if you want to stand up for yourself and your family
[2:55:41.100 --> 2:55:46.700]  and not back down to soros and the globalist then this is the broadcast to take articles from videos

[3:00:39.900 --> 3:00:44.700]  it's so important to listen to infos the people they have on the things that they say the news
[3:00:44.700 --> 3:00:52.860]  broadcast that they put up because we are in a critical time we're all we're being sold as propaganda
[3:00:52.860 --> 3:01:02.060]  and what they and those of us that don't swallow the propaganda it's uh they call us conspiracy
[3:01:02.060 --> 3:01:10.940]  theorists and thinking about misinformation yeah i think that word propaganda is they they're
[3:01:10.940 --> 3:01:19.500]  spelling it wrong it should be uh in propaganda i mean this is terrible what's going on and it's
[3:01:19.500 --> 3:01:31.180]  only going to get worse as you recall i had a big rally up here on july 23rd in kigston new york on
[3:01:31.180 --> 3:01:37.500]  the four corners of freedom the only place with pre-revolutionary warstone buildings on each corner
[3:01:37.500 --> 3:01:50.060]  and i had big-name people here i had judge andrew napolitana scott ridder phil geraldie gary hall
[3:01:51.260 --> 3:02:00.380]  and myself hot damn band music food about 500 people showed up
[3:02:00.380 --> 3:02:07.340]  not a word in the media was called a peace and freedom rally
[3:02:12.220 --> 3:02:13.180]  or freedom and peace
[3:02:16.060 --> 3:02:19.740]  matter of fact my tenant in one of my buildings rough draft
[3:02:19.740 --> 3:02:32.140]  they despise peace and freedom so much that they closed down their place at two o'clock
[3:02:32.140 --> 3:02:38.540]  when the rally began this is my tenant in a beautiful place that i redid that makes it
[3:02:38.540 --> 3:02:46.300]  look spectacular and they're doing a great business they closed down because they said
[3:02:46.300 --> 3:02:56.700]  it was a political rally that's how arrogantly stupid that little war-mongering freaks
[3:02:56.700 --> 3:03:14.700]  believe that peace and freedom is a political rally and they do it all the time
[3:03:14.700 --> 3:03:27.740]  they buy the government crap and boy do they hate you when you won't swallow government crap
[3:03:29.740 --> 3:03:39.900]  who's your favorite crap head yep there's the rally is gary knoll progressive radio network

[3:39:30.060 --> 3:39:39.740]  what father dot com bus 9 11 and as that was down 66 before 9 11 little georgey pushes
[3:39:39.740 --> 3:39:46.220]  ratings started going into the toilet where he belongs 9 11 happened 88 percent of the people
[3:39:46.220 --> 3:39:52.620]  were so stupid again war we're going off to get that guy's uh osama bin laden dead or we're gonna
[3:39:52.620 --> 3:39:57.740]  get we're gonna get osama bin laden dead or alive and people swallowed the crap and that's what i'm
[3:39:57.740 --> 3:40:07.820]  trying to tell you war covid war ukrain war world war people followed the covid war just like that
[3:40:07.820 --> 3:40:16.140]  brilliant quote i read to you from rfk jr please repeat this in your mind and tell everyone it
[3:40:16.140 --> 3:40:24.300]  was talking about covid there was tremendous fear in our country that was generated by the press
[3:40:24.300 --> 3:40:28.940]  was i call them the prostitutes media whores they get paid to put out by the corporate pins
[3:40:28.940 --> 3:40:36.620]  and government hall masters and the medical cartel which i call drug dealers quote when people
[3:40:36.620 --> 3:40:43.580]  get fearful their capacity for critical thinking gets disabled and it's a human
[3:40:43.580 --> 3:40:53.100]  inclination to look for reassurance and leadership from their leadership of authority
[3:40:55.180 --> 3:41:00.300]  so that's what the people do so i'm telling you we must stop this war
[3:41:03.660 --> 3:41:07.420]  and there there are no winners in war so everybody get this in your head
[3:41:07.420 --> 3:41:15.260]  i mean what world war two ended what you know 77 years ago it's not ancient history

[3:41:59.100 --> 3:42:08.220]  uh monetary fund christine legard videnet putin is a terrifying person unlike george bush
[3:42:08.220 --> 3:42:18.220]  unlike obama who's killed many many many many and clinton yeah and bushy bush who killed millions
[3:42:18.220 --> 3:42:29.580]  combined is a terrifying person she said and that he was not as sick as he is today
[3:42:31.340 --> 3:42:39.820]  unlike the mentally ill from before but she goes on to say that um she's very concerned

[3:50:34.940 --> 3:50:42.940]  dot com okay i said about the economy this is global and it's serious
[3:50:44.460 --> 3:50:50.300]  germany's inflation worse than expected this is the headline today inflation in germany
[3:50:50.300 --> 3:50:56.460]  is expected to peak 10.4 percent in october according to preliminary figures released by the country's
[3:50:56.460 --> 3:51:05.420]  national statistics authority 10.4 percent what was it over there in the uk like 9.1
[3:51:05.980 --> 3:51:14.060]  or 10.1 then we've got the 9.9 it was 8.3 8.2 in the united states they'd look where wages are
[3:51:14.780 --> 3:51:21.500]  so when they come out with this data about you know uh gross domestic product growing and sales
[3:51:21.500 --> 3:51:29.820]  growing that's a lot of BS it's costing people to buy to pay more to buy less
[3:51:32.300 --> 3:51:36.380]  october looks to be the second consecutive month where the EU economic powerhouse will
[3:51:36.380 --> 3:51:48.060]  see inflation in double digits you ready for this energy prices were 43 higher in october 2022
[3:51:48.060 --> 3:51:54.060]  than this time last year okay
[3:52:00.380 --> 3:52:08.620]  wonder why oh it couldn't be because quote we're going to punish Putin end quote with the sanctions
[3:52:08.620 --> 3:52:19.340]  that bs biden and the nato freaks followed to put on russia to cut off their energy supply
[3:52:19.340 --> 3:52:27.980]  into europe which gets some 40 percent of their energy they used to buy it from Moscow from russia
[3:52:27.980 --> 3:52:38.540]  from russia and over 50 percent from germany brilliant brilliant move really really smart
[3:52:42.220 --> 3:52:48.540]  and then you guy was talking about the arrogant clown and again as i keep saying i'm tired of
[3:52:48.540 --> 3:52:53.340]  this crap you know if only women were in charge good and bad comes in every race creed and color
[3:52:53.340 --> 3:53:01.740]  so take it easy inflation came from nowhere christine legard said again force you with this
[3:53:01.740 --> 3:53:07.260]  she was the head of the international mafia a monetary fund and now the european central banks
[3:53:07.260 --> 3:53:13.580]  which would you add you know negative interest rates what eight ten years eight years and now
[3:53:13.580 --> 3:53:23.980]  they're bragging that they brought them up to 1.5 oh when you have inflation skyrocketing
[3:53:23.980 --> 3:53:30.460]  so anyway european central bank is double its key interest rate blah blah blah
[3:53:34.140 --> 3:53:42.780]  in october the inflation rate in eurozone ready reached 10.7 percent so going back again on
[3:53:42.780 --> 3:53:48.940]  investments to me and i don't give financial advice and the model of the trends journals
[3:53:48.940 --> 3:53:55.900]  think for yourself to meet gold silver and bitcoin gold number one the top safe haven asset because
[3:53:55.900 --> 3:54:01.740]  this thing is going to collapse big time sometime and when wars break out and stuff gold is the one
[3:54:01.740 --> 3:54:08.220]  it's the top you want to buy your freedom you buy it with gold and that the prices are this low
[3:54:08.220 --> 3:54:15.020]  you know for me is you know you can see russia they have it right there in china may be preparing
[3:54:15.020 --> 3:54:22.620]  for new gold back currency the safest currency today the only reason the dollar is the safest
[3:54:22.620 --> 3:54:27.660]  currencies because the other ones are so weak as info wars makes clear with this article they just
[3:54:27.660 --> 3:54:33.900]  put up there and and so the dollar is strong because the other ones are so weak you got inflation
[3:54:33.900 --> 3:54:41.660]  skyrocketing again in europe at 10.7 percent you got a one point what a five oh interest rate
[3:54:42.460 --> 3:54:45.900]  and they used to say they're going to raise interest rates when they hit two percent so
[3:54:45.900 --> 3:54:51.260]  they're lying freaks they denied it would ever happen so again talking about the freaks that
[3:54:51.260 --> 3:55:04.460]  are in charge and an interview with the state broadcast or rte on friday legard said quote
[3:55:04.460 --> 3:55:08.860]  we do it what they're doing raising interest rates because we are fighting inflation
[3:55:10.060 --> 3:55:14.460]  no you're not you're not fighting inflation when inflation is at 10.7 percent and your
[3:55:14.460 --> 3:55:18.860]  interest rate is down there so you're not talking to a sixth grader yeah maybe they are but i'm not
[3:55:18.860 --> 3:55:30.140]  and then she goes on to say you're ready that inflation pretty much came from nowhere i'm not
[3:55:30.140 --> 3:55:40.940]  making this up the energy crisis she writes was caused by putin who has decided in an unjustified
[3:55:40.940 --> 3:55:48.460]  way to invade another country yeah oh she's french huh you never invaded another country
[3:55:48.460 --> 3:55:53.340]  did a great job down there in algeria that was just going on into the 60s yeah vietnam before
[3:55:53.340 --> 3:56:00.700]  the americans got there oh all your other colonies all over the place unjustified well let's go back
[3:56:00.700 --> 3:56:05.980]  to the facts again we write about them in the trends journal but maybe you're too stupid to read
[3:56:06.620 --> 3:56:12.620]  go back to our spring 2014 issue when it used to be a quarterly then it went to a monthly
[3:56:12.620 --> 3:56:17.180]  announce a weekly and how the united states over through the democratically elected government
[3:56:17.180 --> 3:56:23.020]  of viktor yana kovic in ukraine and well on and on but anyway
[3:56:26.780 --> 3:56:33.180]  she said that's what he putin is trying to do cause chaos and destroy as much of europe as he
[3:56:33.180 --> 3:56:40.140]  can the energy crisis is causing massive inflation which we have to defeat number one the inflation
[3:56:40.140 --> 3:56:52.540]  was coming before the energy crisis you denied it you said it wasn't real number two it's not
[3:56:52.540 --> 3:57:01.900]  putin that caused it it's the europeans that caused it by putting the sanctions on russia you
[3:57:01.900 --> 3:57:07.500]  closed it down but this is the propaganda that they're selling and that's why you need to go
