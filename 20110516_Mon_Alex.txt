[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:36.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.800 --> 00:42.760]  we are live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us it is Monday the
[00:42.760 --> 00:50.000]  16th day of May 2011 and we're gonna be live here for the next three hours at
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.040]  least Joel Scowles in a World Affairs brief will be joining us coming up at
[00:54.040 --> 00:59.520]  the bottom of the next hour we will also have open phones today on all the
[00:59.520 --> 01:04.520]  different things happening in the world Dominique Strauss-Kahn and the upcoming
[01:04.520 --> 01:13.280]  indictment arrested for reportedly now person was attempted forced oral sex and
[01:13.280 --> 01:18.440]  attempted sodomy now they're seeing sodomy of a 32-year-old maid and his
[01:18.440 --> 01:24.880]  $3,000 a night taxpayer paid for hotel room remember US taxpayers finance the
[01:24.880 --> 01:32.520]  IMF and the World Bank I was also reading how they keep on every French
[01:32.520 --> 01:40.400]  Airways airline they keep a seat open for him and I guess if it's full they
[01:40.400 --> 01:43.920]  just throw somebody out of the first-class seat for Dominique Strauss-Kahn
[01:43.920 --> 01:48.200]  who was going to be the socialist candidate they're reporting to run
[01:48.200 --> 01:53.760]  against Nicholas Sarkozy and French polls showed that he was gonna win hmm
[01:53.760 --> 02:00.480]  an international banker had who openly goes in and destroys third-world
[02:00.480 --> 02:07.920]  countries and puts loan sharking level interest rates on them IMF World Bank
[02:07.920 --> 02:11.280]  maneuvering the US towards debt insolvency in the laws of the triple A
[02:11.280 --> 02:18.000]  rating but he was set to be the leader of the socialist party the bankers want
[02:18.000 --> 02:23.360]  you under socialism what is in the communist manifesto finance for the
[02:23.360 --> 02:30.800]  big British banks over 120 years ago what is in the 10 planks of the
[02:30.800 --> 02:35.840]  communist manifesto a graduated income tax a central bank a private central
[02:35.840 --> 02:39.860]  bank I mean they wrote this to collectivize your wealth so they can
[02:39.860 --> 02:43.760]  control the general population so the general population is on their payroll
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.720]  and the rest of the public is being sucked off of by them and then they
[02:48.720 --> 02:54.320]  basically transfer our wealth so I'm gonna be going over that because it's
[02:54.320 --> 03:00.040]  very interesting timing the word is and more lawsuits are being filed one by a
[03:00.040 --> 03:06.640]  prominent reporter that Khan began acting like a wild quote chimpanzee
[03:06.640 --> 03:12.840]  ripping her clothes off and quote hunching on her so that's standard
[03:12.840 --> 03:17.880]  globalist operating procedure they are like a bunch of demonic wild chimpanzees
[03:17.880 --> 03:23.040]  Khan the evidence shows just likes to jump women which is bad enough Paul
[03:23.040 --> 03:27.520]  Watson has a detailed report that it's very painful to read and it's four pages
[03:27.520 --> 03:31.920]  long and I'm not a news reader but I will struggle through this coming up
[03:31.920 --> 03:36.880]  later in the hour globalist like to rape women as well as nations and it gets
[03:36.880 --> 03:42.960]  into the cases of the little dungeons with little kids in them with the top
[03:42.960 --> 03:48.560]  EU people and then the police even come to the house as little girls beg but
[03:48.560 --> 03:53.280]  they don't help them and then they they starve little girls the death is how
[03:53.280 --> 03:57.560]  they like to do it because the and again it's not just the raping them they
[03:57.560 --> 04:01.760]  enjoy it's the begging and the pleading the longer the better that's their
[04:01.760 --> 04:05.360]  favorite thing that's why the UN gets caught up with the world injecting kids
[04:05.360 --> 04:09.960]  with syphilis and live polio because that's their religion the more innocent
[04:09.960 --> 04:14.120]  the more good the more decent the more these pit demons enjoy torturing them
[04:14.120 --> 04:18.520]  to death and I mentioned some of this yesterday and without me even asking
[04:18.520 --> 04:23.280]  obviously Watson was listening last night he did a full detailed report with
[04:23.280 --> 04:27.440]  hyperlinks to mainstream news admitting all of this so I thought we look at the
[04:27.440 --> 04:32.760]  mindset of these predators so we can understand them I mean you've got to at
[04:32.760 --> 04:37.760]  least be somebody chasing after male pages or who likes to rape women to be
[04:37.760 --> 04:43.160]  in their club but you don't rise to the highest levels unless you like little
[04:43.160 --> 04:47.920]  children down in torture dungeons and then you go right to the top so we'll
[04:47.920 --> 04:55.320]  be talking about our rulers our owners the psychopathic child torturers on the
[04:55.320 --> 05:02.480]  other side stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[05:02.480 --> 05:06.920]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[05:06.920 --> 05:10.920]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[05:10.920 --> 05:14.360]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[05:14.360 --> 05:18.840]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[05:18.840 --> 05:23.400]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[05:23.400 --> 05:27.440]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.440 --> 05:31.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.240 --> 05:34.880]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:34.880 --> 05:39.200]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.200 --> 05:42.440]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar powered
[05:42.440 --> 05:46.040]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[05:46.040 --> 05:50.800]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar

[07:12.760 --> 07:18.120]  home turning menace influence on our president in Congress and they really
[07:18.120 --> 07:22.920]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[07:22.920 --> 07:27.280]  citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[07:27.280 --> 07:32.560]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[07:32.560 --> 07:36.840]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[07:36.840 --> 07:40.360]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[07:40.360 --> 07:45.600]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[07:45.600 --> 07:51.280]  have seen a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD
[07:51.280 --> 07:56.600]  at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[07:56.600 --> 08:05.280]  prison planet dot TV ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN
[08:05.280 --> 08:30.720]  radio network
[08:30.720 --> 08:39.320]  we are live my friends it is Monday the 16th day of May 2011 Joel Scalzen world
[08:39.320 --> 08:42.640]  affairs brief will be joining us coming up about an hour and a half from now to
[08:42.640 --> 08:47.800]  give us his take on the exploding unrest in the Middle East we're gonna be
[08:47.800 --> 08:53.280]  breaking down the latest on Fukushima which has continued to have explosions
[08:53.280 --> 09:01.040]  and fires and smoke with radiation off the charts one correction listeners
[09:01.040 --> 09:04.160]  didn't correct me I wouldn't look it up last night after the show they had
[09:04.160 --> 09:09.280]  reported 10 million times safe levels of or normal levels of radiation I look
[09:09.280 --> 09:16.000]  that up and that was the equivalent of you know flying by a exploding star that
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.760]  was a misreading I believe and that's what they later said then they said that
[09:20.760 --> 09:27.280]  it was over 7 million I believe that's a miss reading it's 7,500 times safe
[09:27.280 --> 09:32.280]  levels were confirmed over a month ago in the ocean right off Fukushima and
[09:32.280 --> 09:37.160]  that was in the Associated Press and ABC News so I said 7 million times last night
[09:37.160 --> 09:46.360]  and obviously it was not 7 million times okay let me I will also talk to Joel
[09:46.360 --> 09:51.440]  Scalzen about the bin Laden situation the Dominic Strauss-Kahn will cover a
[09:51.440 --> 09:56.880]  whole raft a whole laundry list of issues with him obviously I should talk
[09:56.880 --> 10:01.000]  some about Ron Paul declaring late last week that he will be running for
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.560]  president but that's really old news for this audience it's the right thing to do
[10:06.560 --> 10:11.560]  even if Ron Paul doesn't win the nomination or the presidency after that
[10:11.560 --> 10:16.200]  he will win in the realm of ideas I mean if you thought it was pertinent
[10:16.200 --> 10:20.800]  three years ago with him up there nationally on in the big debates bringing
[10:20.800 --> 10:25.240]  up that it's not conservative to launch all these preemptive imperial wars that
[10:25.240 --> 10:29.160]  the dollars being devalued that we have an inflation tax that a world
[10:29.160 --> 10:34.040]  government is being established by the crooks at the IMF and the World Bank now
[10:34.040 --> 10:38.720]  imagine how powerful that information is going to be when Ron Paul's up there
[10:38.720 --> 10:43.280]  calling for an audit of the Fed on national television in the debates in
[10:43.280 --> 10:50.160]  his TV ads it will only further mainline the true Americana constitutionalist
[10:50.160 --> 10:56.000]  movement against the globalist and you notice Ron Paul is out in the news all
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.320]  over the weekend without even trying to watch television I saw him here in the
[11:00.320 --> 11:06.680]  break room last night on Fox I saw him on CNN when I was at a restaurant last
[11:06.680 --> 11:12.520]  night on the big screen TV talking about Dominic Strauss-Kahn and he pointed
[11:12.520 --> 11:17.920]  out that these are the types of people that we have running the IMF and World
[11:17.920 --> 11:23.760]  Bank here is the Fox News headline IMF implicated after chief arrested on
[11:23.760 --> 11:28.280]  attempted rape charge Ron Paul says these are the kind of people that are
[11:28.280 --> 11:32.920]  running the IMF and we want to turn world finances and control of the money
[11:32.920 --> 11:38.200]  supply over to them Paul said continuing to quote that should awaken
[11:38.200 --> 11:43.520]  everybody to the fact that they ought to look into the IMF and find out why we
[11:43.520 --> 11:48.120]  shouldn't be sacrificing more sovereignty to an organization like that
[11:48.120 --> 11:52.600]  and an individual like he was and he went on to say we should not hand over
[11:52.600 --> 11:57.760]  world government power to this individual he went on to say I would like a
[11:57.760 --> 12:02.680]  sound American currency but others want to go to a world currency they want to
[12:02.680 --> 12:08.680]  use the IMF as the model Ron Paul said so there's Ron Paul with real issues and
[12:08.680 --> 12:13.680]  every show he goes on that I catch is they say what about you saying you
[12:13.680 --> 12:17.480]  didn't want to kill who some have been lauding and Ron Paul says that's not
[12:17.480 --> 12:22.560]  what I said in fact it's been Ron Paul since 2001 when he plays along with the
[12:22.560 --> 12:28.880]  official fable saying look we shouldn't have spent trillions of dollars in Iraq
[12:28.880 --> 12:32.400]  and Afghanistan to get to someone been locked member member our media said to
[12:32.400 --> 12:37.560]  someone been lauding was in Iraq to oh he'd run from Afghanistan to Iraq and
[12:37.560 --> 12:42.720]  they had the the airplanes grounded that they were doing Al Qaeda hijacking
[12:42.720 --> 12:47.680]  drills in and it was all made up but Ron Paul said instead of spending these
[12:47.680 --> 12:51.840]  trillions of dollars and killing a million Iraqis why didn't we just send
[12:51.840 --> 12:56.240]  special forces in to kill bin Laden because there were all those reports that
[12:56.240 --> 13:00.760]  special forces had him in their sights but weren't ever allowed to killing well
[13:00.760 --> 13:06.400]  it's just like the Deputy Secretary of State came out last week under Colin
[13:06.400 --> 13:13.840]  Powell and said look Bush didn't want him dead he wanted to use him as a boogeyman
[13:13.840 --> 13:17.200]  well of course they did what did Governor Ridge in a book now written two
[13:17.200 --> 13:21.920]  years ago say he was ordered to issue fake terror alerts Homeland Security as
[13:21.920 --> 13:30.160]  a political stunt to get support of President Bush's policies and what do
[13:30.160 --> 13:34.760]  you think Obama's doing now with this new terror alert system and and in
[13:34.760 --> 13:40.760]  individualized text and video break-ins over your phone and TV set and in radio
[13:40.760 --> 13:45.240]  this is the federal government moving towards taking over the media and
[13:45.240 --> 13:50.240]  acclimating us first with short break-ins and text to more and more
[13:50.240 --> 13:54.040]  government break-ins so when they finally totally drop the hammer and take
[13:54.040 --> 13:58.720]  over all media so they can put out their message so there's no resistance when
[13:58.720 --> 14:03.360]  they set off a nuke in a city or a small town notice al-Qaeda wants to target
[14:03.360 --> 14:09.640]  small towns now with nukes that is in the latest documents found in the
[14:09.640 --> 14:13.320]  million pages of documents found in the al-Qaeda
[14:13.320 --> 14:24.160]  hovel the al-Qaeda warren the al-Qaeda rat hole a spider nest and oh now so
[14:24.160 --> 14:29.880]  obama can personalize this 10-year saga with bin Laden bin Laden wanted to kill
[14:29.880 --> 14:36.280]  Obama and Obama's tough man he's he got even with that guy he's tough I mean you
[14:36.280 --> 14:39.720]  can just imagine how they would script this to make them look like heroes and
[14:39.720 --> 14:42.920]  sell the police state and that's what they're gonna come out with because they
[14:42.920 --> 14:46.920]  sit around and say let's say we got a million pages we can make up whatever we
[14:46.920 --> 14:51.440]  want forever let's say that we are not gonna release the photo because nobody
[14:51.440 --> 14:55.300]  will believe it anyways and we threw it in the ocean but we're we've got the
[14:55.300 --> 15:00.840]  navy seal video cam feeds but they're so shaky that when we release that you
[15:00.840 --> 15:04.720]  won't be able to tell what what you're looking at and let's shoot him from the
[15:04.720 --> 15:08.240]  side let's get one of the lookalikes in there and shoot him from the side well
[15:08.240 --> 15:12.000]  hey boss we got caught releasing all those other fake ones and they won't
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.160]  remember that they love hating a foreigner yeah I mean you can see how
[15:16.160 --> 15:23.600]  this is all going down so that's just some of what I've got there I don't even
[15:23.600 --> 15:34.240]  feel worthy to bring you information of this magnitude I don't and as things get
[15:34.240 --> 15:39.040]  darker and darker as everything that we've basically broken down begins to
[15:39.040 --> 15:43.280]  manifest itself as we follow the globalist roadmap we're just following
[15:43.280 --> 15:47.840]  their blueprint and and tracking where they're going to go next it's not very
[15:47.840 --> 15:52.640]  hard to really do this job it's not hard to understand the information it is
[15:52.640 --> 15:58.360]  hard to face it every day it is hard to continue to track it and to have to look
[15:58.360 --> 16:03.320]  at the crimes of these people and watch them get away with it it is very very
[16:03.320 --> 16:13.240]  frustrating and it makes me want to not run and hide run and hide is not the
[16:13.240 --> 16:23.560]  word it's not run and hide out of fear it's more I just want to imagine this
[16:23.560 --> 16:28.680]  isn't going on I mean the deeper I get into this the the the more I confirm my
[16:28.680 --> 16:32.640]  worst fears and concerns I mean it's always worse than I originally thought
[16:32.640 --> 16:38.800]  the arrogance how bold they are what they've gotten away with how how how
[16:38.800 --> 16:47.560]  vicious this ruling class is what they're into who they are it just makes me
[16:47.560 --> 16:56.560]  want to move to Wyoming and buy a tiny cabin and selfishly have a farm and
[16:56.560 --> 17:02.640]  just disappear and never be seen again and I'm gonna be honest with the
[17:02.640 --> 17:08.040]  listeners of this show if I thought that this corruption would just kind of
[17:08.040 --> 17:14.560]  stagnate where it where it is and that and and that I could just get away from
[17:14.560 --> 17:20.520]  it and be left alone it would be a temptation very hard to turn down to
[17:20.520 --> 17:26.240]  remove myself from this equation and drive 50 miles once a week to a grocery
[17:26.240 --> 17:31.240]  store and see no one and be around no one that really is what I lust after not
[17:31.240 --> 17:40.200]  power not money not women and not fame all of that is actually a curse it
[17:40.200 --> 17:48.680]  really is instead I realize I do need some money and power to just protect
[17:48.680 --> 17:53.880]  myself to a certain extent so that I can defend myself if I'm going to continue
[17:53.880 --> 18:01.880]  down this road I have just learned too much about human nature I have gone
[18:01.880 --> 18:10.600]  over the mountain I guess you could say and I am changing I don't want to sit
[18:10.600 --> 18:19.160]  here and talk about myself but here's what I have to say I will not leave I
[18:19.160 --> 18:26.720]  will never leave I will never stop because my flesh wants to just get away
[18:26.720 --> 18:33.680]  from all of this and go hide somewhere again not out of even out of fear the
[18:33.680 --> 18:38.320]  fighter in me wants to fight these people but at the same time my selfish
[18:38.320 --> 18:42.960]  side just wants to be separate from them but I realize I can't go running hide
[18:42.960 --> 18:49.000]  you can't go hide in a farmhouse and get away from these people it is not
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.520]  going to go away it's going to get worse and it's those of us that want to be left
[18:53.520 --> 18:58.480]  alone that the system is coming after there is an obsession coast to coast
[18:58.480 --> 19:05.000]  with rating organic farmer markets with cops with guns drawn to act like it's
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.320]  dirty and bad and evil to have a farmer's market we see countless
[19:08.320 --> 19:11.920]  surveillance videos coming in of just cops freaking out slamming people down
[19:11.920 --> 19:17.160]  the ground who were selling rutabaga and strawberries they'll do a year long
[19:17.160 --> 19:21.440]  half million dollar investigations of Amish people publicly and legally
[19:21.440 --> 19:25.960]  selling milk just to act like and fool the domesticated jury see it's all part
[19:25.960 --> 19:29.720]  of theater that we had an investigation and we did this and here's how we got
[19:29.720 --> 19:34.400]  the milk and how we sold it so the dumb down domesticated jury that doesn't know
[19:34.400 --> 19:41.280]  how to screw in a light bulb thinks that coining your own silver coins is
[19:41.280 --> 19:46.640]  illegal or selling your neighbor's milk is illegal and then I realized how the
[19:46.640 --> 19:49.720]  feds do all this premeditated Lee and they know they're putting on a show and
[19:49.720 --> 19:56.200]  they like it and they're just say no masochistic bullies and and and they
[19:56.200 --> 19:59.880]  had a big 60 minutes special last night I just can't handle it

[23:04.560 --> 23:08.280]  benefit at all from protein your body must first be able to break down protein
[23:08.280 --> 23:12.720]  into amino acids once amino acids are liberated from proteins your body uses
[23:12.720 --> 23:16.400]  them to make brain chemicals that make you feel alert and peaceful at the same
[23:16.400 --> 23:20.960]  time your pancreas uses them to regulate blood sugar and insulin people are
[23:20.960 --> 23:24.600]  waking up and doing an about face when it comes to nutrition they're learning
[23:24.600 --> 23:28.840]  that a high carbohydrate diet may encourage obesity and diabetes they are
[23:28.840 --> 23:33.000]  now emphasizing proteins more to compensate one protein source that is

[24:15.280 --> 24:23.120]  ashes it can be resurrected anytime we rediscovered it and enforce it by
[24:23.120 --> 24:27.520]  educating others by standing up by filing lawsuits against criminals in
[24:27.520 --> 24:32.120]  government there's a whole cocktail of things you can do to resist them but the
[24:32.120 --> 24:37.840]  system is now demonizing anyone that points this out and coming after them
[24:37.840 --> 24:44.840]  and they are harassing anyone who simply tries to be left alone they want you to
[24:44.840 --> 24:49.640]  be part of this Babylon system they want you to take the poison vaccines they
[24:49.640 --> 24:53.120]  want you to have the cell phones and fry your brain they want you to take the
[24:53.120 --> 24:57.240]  prescription drugs that they know are killing you they openly in Europe have
[24:57.240 --> 25:02.560]  now put in codex alimentarius are banning vitamin C over the counter in
[25:02.560 --> 25:06.720]  most nations I read those articles last week I mean they are coming for
[25:06.720 --> 25:11.520]  everybody big business is openly writing the laws to shut down their
[25:11.520 --> 25:16.560]  competition big business openly gets to keep their cold power plants everybody
[25:16.560 --> 25:22.120]  else gets them shut down the big establishment boys get to lobby and get
[25:22.120 --> 25:25.760]  waivers from having to buy health care for their employees you've got to buy it
[25:25.760 --> 25:30.240]  and if you stand up and say I'm not going to do this this is unconstitutional
[25:30.240 --> 25:35.680]  and it's discriminatory you're not enforcing this uniformly they will come
[25:35.680 --> 25:40.520]  and arrest you and they have federal juries that they kept seated of hand
[25:40.520 --> 25:46.840]  picked evil people evil people and useful idiots and others who will send a
[25:46.840 --> 25:55.640]  baby kitten to the gas chamber for murder they they would send a rock to
[25:55.640 --> 26:04.680]  the gallows 98% conviction rate 98% conviction rate and I've seen much of
[26:04.680 --> 26:08.880]  an incredible 60 minutes piece last night we're gonna post the 60 minutes
[26:08.880 --> 26:13.760]  piece demonizing sovereign citizens up on info wars calm jaren brought it to my
[26:13.760 --> 26:17.920]  attention this morning a look at the sovereign citizen movement and they go
[26:17.920 --> 26:23.480]  on to say well most of our 30 year old males they've lost their job and they
[26:23.480 --> 26:26.880]  don't have any money and their terrorist and we want to arrest them and
[26:26.880 --> 26:33.160]  they're evil and and they think they're above the law no it's the UN and the
[26:33.160 --> 26:37.120]  bureaucrats that have the diplomatic immunity and are allowed to engage in
[26:37.120 --> 26:41.320]  all these crimes it's the IMF and World Bank as the front groups for the private
[26:41.320 --> 26:45.920]  central banks that have gotten $27 trillion of American taxpayer money
[26:45.920 --> 26:49.880]  at least in the last three years and won't tell Congress where the money went
[26:49.880 --> 26:56.560]  but we found out where some of it went and went to private individuals you're
[26:56.560 --> 27:01.360]  the people that are above the law because you say you are bush put memos
[27:01.360 --> 27:07.920]  out saying well tortures illegal unless I say we can that's above the law in
[27:07.920 --> 27:11.840]  those White House memos put out by John you and Alberto Gonzalez saying well if
[27:11.840 --> 27:16.960]  the president says it it well we Nixon tried that and no the president's not
[27:16.960 --> 27:21.920]  above the law nobody is above the law not dominate Strauss con not any of them
[27:21.920 --> 27:25.600]  I'm gonna cover that coming up in the next segment and I'm gonna spend a lot of
[27:25.600 --> 27:30.680]  time in the third hour on the sovereign citizen movement that is an entire
[27:30.680 --> 27:35.080]  spectrum of ideas and people some of it I don't agree with and I think it's
[27:35.080 --> 27:39.800]  criminal most of it is absolutely legitimate makes sense here's the point
[27:39.800 --> 27:45.480]  I want to make this morning I heard local talk radio news playing national
[27:45.480 --> 27:52.560]  news and Fox was saying Fox radio was saying well Texas you know the House and
[27:52.560 --> 27:58.040]  the Senate passed the law that's expected to go to Governor Perry's desk to
[27:58.040 --> 28:03.040]  say it's against the law for the TSA to stick their hands on people's genitals
[28:03.040 --> 28:07.760]  on the outside or the inside of the pants but it doesn't matter it's really
[28:07.760 --> 28:16.320]  only ceremonial because the federal law trumps it well you know what I've had
[28:16.320 --> 28:20.600]  constitutional lawyers on but I've also read the TSA regulations these are
[28:20.600 --> 28:26.200]  regulations put out by Homeland Security and Homeland Security just says we can
[28:26.200 --> 28:30.880]  do whatever we want we can download your iPad your iPhone your laptop with no
[28:30.880 --> 28:36.080]  warrant really FBI agent can't do that that's cuz it's all been litigated out
[28:36.080 --> 28:38.880]  with the FBI agents they've got at least follow most the Bill of Rights
[28:38.880 --> 28:44.080]  Constitution a local state police cop in New Hampshire or Texas or Oklahoma
[28:44.080 --> 28:52.720]  can't do that why can these people in little blue outfits do it I mean can a
[28:52.720 --> 28:56.160]  state police officer just pull up in a park and say I just want to stick my
[28:56.160 --> 28:59.280]  hands down your pants you might be a terrorist no you're innocent till
[28:59.280 --> 29:02.680]  proven guilty there's new process but they create these little federal
[29:02.680 --> 29:07.240]  reservations and they say they're above the law on radiation testing from the
[29:07.240 --> 29:12.840]  scanners every other system run by doctors you name it has to be checked
[29:12.840 --> 29:18.080]  every month by radiologists but not this it's just exempt because an agency said
[29:18.080 --> 29:23.560]  so and we're exempt from federal and state laws on sexual molestation and
[29:23.560 --> 29:28.480]  assault we're allowed to do it sworn cops can't do it sworn FBI can't do it
[29:28.480 --> 29:35.680]  Secret Service can't do it but this new group can do it now that's a sovereign
[29:35.680 --> 29:41.160]  government pimp not a sovereign citizen and see if citizens aren't sovereign and
[29:41.160 --> 29:45.560]  have basic rights then we have government gods somebody's got rights
[29:45.560 --> 29:50.000]  they're saying we don't have them but they do well they ride back stay with us

[33:49.160 --> 33:56.080]  central time okay finishing up the point I was trying to get to in the third
[33:56.080 --> 33:59.480]  hour I'm gonna talk more about what sovereign citizens are what
[33:59.480 --> 34:04.000]  constitutionalists are and how the media and the government are trying to imply
[34:04.000 --> 34:10.680]  that anybody that argues with any edict of a federal or state agency is some
[34:10.680 --> 34:16.720]  type of bizarre dangerous crazy terrorist and that's basically what the
[34:16.720 --> 34:22.680]  60 minutes hit piece did last night is talk about 300 plus thousand they
[34:22.680 --> 34:26.440]  estimate it's a lot more than that folks that call themselves sovereign
[34:26.440 --> 34:30.400]  citizens who aren't paying the income tax who aren't paying the property tax
[34:30.400 --> 34:35.200]  and most of them have just decided that if they ever try to take me into jail
[34:35.200 --> 34:40.680]  I'm gonna go ahead and stand up against them and that's the end of it and they
[34:40.680 --> 34:43.920]  admit in the piece their people that have been pushed to the edge and that's
[34:43.920 --> 34:49.560]  what happens and meanwhile the illegal aliens are the real sovereign
[34:49.560 --> 34:54.920]  citizens at the grassroots most of them don't pay taxes they have fake IDs or no
[34:54.920 --> 34:59.720]  IDs but the cops have been told leave them alone they're part of the system
[34:59.720 --> 35:04.240]  here driving down wages when we legalize them they'll vote to take the guns
[35:04.240 --> 35:08.680]  we're gonna use the illegals as our voting block and our army against the
[35:08.680 --> 35:12.320]  American people and that's what the Ford Foundation and others are on record
[35:12.320 --> 35:18.680]  setting up so so they're a group that is literally above the constitutional laws
[35:18.680 --> 35:27.920]  because they're allied with the IMF World Bank type people get my coffee here
[35:27.920 --> 35:34.240]  because they're allied with the folks who at the top have set up this world
[35:34.240 --> 35:39.080]  government where they are exempt from the laws that they pass for us the
[35:39.080 --> 35:49.040]  little people that's kind of like Congress exempting itself from social security and
[35:49.040 --> 35:53.800]  every other major program they foist upon the American people that's always a
[35:53.800 --> 36:00.240]  big telltale sign of serious tyranny now I could go on for a long time along this
[36:00.240 --> 36:04.080]  point but as I said I'm gonna get into it more and play part of the 60 minutes
[36:04.080 --> 36:09.440]  piece and analyze it coming up in the third hour today we do have Joel
[36:09.440 --> 36:15.040]  Scousen coming up who's going to join us when I get on air and I say that I
[36:15.040 --> 36:22.360]  don't feel worthy to cover this information
[36:22.360 --> 36:38.920]  by worthy this information is so horrible so evil that it's something that
[36:38.920 --> 36:46.320]  all people should be standing up and fighting and that the more gifted
[36:46.320 --> 36:54.520]  researchers and legal minds and law enforcement people should be turning
[36:54.520 --> 37:00.280]  their energies towards but really everybody sees corruption is something
[37:00.280 --> 37:04.920]  that somebody else who's got more answers or somebody else who's more
[37:04.920 --> 37:10.880]  well-spoken should have to deal with but at the end of the day justice falls to
[37:10.880 --> 37:20.000]  all of us when we attempt to always give that responsibility to somebody else
[37:20.000 --> 37:26.120]  or some other group invariably the groups that we empower to keep us safe
[37:26.120 --> 37:32.960]  and to be guardians of the republic become corrupted become overtaken and
[37:32.960 --> 37:38.560]  we see more and more corrupt people being recruited into those positions
[37:38.560 --> 37:49.240]  until the entire power structure is run by very abusive evil avarice filled
[37:49.240 --> 38:02.400]  bloodthirsty type of personages and if you've looked at history that's the
[38:02.400 --> 38:09.080]  norm that's why every philosopher worth their salt has pointed out that if you
[38:09.080 --> 38:12.000]  want to know what's happening currently and you want to know what's going to
[38:12.000 --> 38:18.440]  happen in the future all you need to do is study history because societies
[38:18.440 --> 38:25.360]  empires individuals religions philosophies they all basically go
[38:25.360 --> 38:33.120]  through the same cycles and permutations and we have definitely come
[38:33.120 --> 38:43.800]  into a very very dangerous time period in our society I think the best thing
[38:43.800 --> 38:51.480]  for me to do is to just read in its entirety this article by Paul Joseph
[38:51.480 --> 38:58.800]  Watson globalists like to rape women as well as nations and this is a very
[38:58.800 --> 39:07.120]  important article because every claim every statement that is made here is
[39:07.120 --> 39:12.000]  directly linked to the actual court records documents mainstream media
[39:12.000 --> 39:19.520]  reports and knowing all of these cases that are in the article I have to say
[39:19.520 --> 39:27.920]  that it's actually only the surface of it even though this article basically
[39:27.920 --> 39:33.600]  sounds like it's off the charts reality the full import of the reality is so
[39:33.600 --> 39:39.800]  much worse I mean just to watch the Associated Press video that is posted in
[39:39.800 --> 39:46.640]  this article of Dominic Strauss-Kahn proudly being led out of the police car
[39:46.640 --> 39:52.760]  and bugging his eyes out hatefully at the police and trying to intimidate them
[39:52.760 --> 39:59.040]  and the police generally in that culture worship power and so they are
[39:59.040 --> 40:03.560]  definitely freaked out by him they didn't even handcuff him when they picked
[40:03.560 --> 40:12.640]  him up from the airport off of the French Airways jet and then once they
[40:12.640 --> 40:19.640]  bring him in the way he is strutting around I mean you can just see what an
[40:19.640 --> 40:26.880]  avarice filled bull this guy is and this is the globalist religion it's about
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.480]  dominating innocence it's about forcing yourself on people the last thing I
[40:31.480 --> 40:39.080]  would ever want to do but that's because I'm normal somewhat normal you know at
[40:39.080 --> 40:44.640]  least from my perspective I am the entire thrill is in the woman wanting
[40:44.640 --> 40:56.080]  you I am repulsed by what you know many globalist philosophers have talked
[40:56.080 --> 41:01.440]  about taking the woman forcing yourself I mean that just doesn't even doesn't
[41:01.440 --> 41:11.160]  even compute but but but but but but in that aggressive stance in that mindset
[41:11.160 --> 41:16.760]  is the essence of the globalist and so somebody like Dominic Strauss-Kahn who
[41:16.760 --> 41:25.080]  has a long history of being accused of trying to force himself on women i.e.
[41:25.080 --> 41:31.800]  rape them that is basically just a doorway a window into the wider world
[41:31.800 --> 41:36.800]  of the New World Order and this is what goes on at Bohemian Grove it's what goes
[41:36.800 --> 41:42.680]  on at Skull and Bones it's what goes on in the halls of Congress and it's their
[41:42.680 --> 41:47.160]  attitude and that's why they go after the Amish it's why they go after the
[41:47.160 --> 41:52.960]  little farms selling selling tomatoes up on the highway or peaches or pecans it's
[41:52.960 --> 41:58.280]  it's why they seek out anyone who just wants to be wholesome and good and
[41:58.280 --> 42:03.440]  strong see I never get sick of walking around in the woods I never get tired of
[42:03.440 --> 42:08.400]  looking out on onto a lake I never get tired of watching birds hop around in
[42:08.400 --> 42:13.800]  my backyard in the tree I never get tired of reading dozens and dozens of books
[42:13.800 --> 42:20.600]  to my children every day I never get tired of cheese enchiladas I never get
[42:20.600 --> 42:25.520]  tired of the way my wife looks I don't need more I don't need to do something
[42:25.520 --> 42:31.080]  twisted to find satisfaction I have complete satisfaction in what I was
[42:31.080 --> 42:40.440]  designed to be I'm not aberrant you understand that and and and this whole
[42:40.440 --> 42:45.680]  culture and system tells us that we're not fulfilled and we're not happy in
[42:45.680 --> 42:50.800]  in in what is seen as vanilla plain Jane and so when you're really
[42:50.800 --> 42:56.480]  intellectual you're into this you're into that and when you study history this
[42:56.480 --> 43:00.440]  is what Caligula did this is what Nero did this is what the Chinese emperors
[43:00.440 --> 43:06.160]  did this is what the Aztecs did every culture degenerates as psychopaths
[43:06.160 --> 43:11.200]  start getting into power and sociopaths that serve them and then cultures aren't
[43:11.200 --> 43:18.560]  about intellect and engineering and being being being being explorers and
[43:18.560 --> 43:23.280]  trailblazers it's always the explorers and trailblazers and hard workers that
[43:23.280 --> 43:31.160]  build the civilization and then the parasites come in they take control they
[43:31.160 --> 43:36.160]  sell you on public torture and death as the Romans did they try to infect the
[43:36.160 --> 43:43.400]  general population and basically convert things over to their system I liken it to
[43:43.400 --> 43:47.560]  John Carpenter's the thing where you dig it up out of the snow and it absorbs
[43:47.560 --> 43:53.080]  you and becomes you and then basically turns you in to something else though on
[43:53.080 --> 44:00.560]  the surface you look normal and so I'm gonna read this article now and I would
[44:00.560 --> 44:04.480]  challenge folks to go through this check every link check it for yourself
[44:04.480 --> 44:13.280]  because it starts with just the latest with Khan the the wrath of Khan and then
[44:13.280 --> 44:19.280]  it gets into just a few examples of the legions of small children begging for
[44:19.280 --> 44:22.560]  help with the police doing nothing to help them I remember times of London
[44:22.560 --> 44:29.440]  article 12 years ago where women broke out of a that time was a Rothschild owned
[44:29.440 --> 44:34.480]  castle and got to the local police station and got to the medias and then
[44:34.480 --> 44:38.600]  when the police went there were women you know dead in these cages and they
[44:38.600 --> 44:42.080]  dug up a bunch of dead women but then it was all swept in the rug and see
[44:42.080 --> 44:47.040]  France has had these vampiric like people operating there for more than a
[44:47.040 --> 44:54.360]  thousand years oh they die but they might as well be vampires I mean with
[44:54.360 --> 45:00.640]  every legend there is a truth and it continues globalist like to rape women
[45:00.640 --> 45:05.840]  as well as nations now let's go over this article given the fact that the
[45:05.840 --> 45:11.560]  likes of the IMF had Dominique Strauss Khan and other top globalist are intent
[45:11.560 --> 45:17.080]  on raping the national and monetary sovereignty of countries in pursuit of
[45:17.080 --> 45:21.880]  their new world order it is no surprise that they also seem preoccupied with
[45:21.880 --> 45:26.560]  raping women amongst a host of other sorted and predatory perversions
[45:26.560 --> 45:33.880]  remember that Nero would dress up as a werewolf at the big Roman parties at
[45:33.880 --> 45:38.800]  his palace everybody laying on the floor with the low tables eating and that
[45:38.800 --> 45:44.360]  they would then chain a beautiful slave down and he dressed in a wolf skin he
[45:44.360 --> 45:48.200]  would come and rip their throats out being sprayed with blood that's mainline
[45:48.200 --> 45:53.120]  stuff now down the road Caligula that's mainline history Caligula wanted to
[45:53.120 --> 45:58.520]  insult everyone so he married his horse and he would have the Roman priest
[45:58.520 --> 46:02.800]  instead of splitting the gut of a bull and reading the guts instead of tea
[46:02.800 --> 46:07.320]  leaves he would have them read the horsemaner
[46:11.400 --> 46:17.920]  now continuing with this article globalists like to rape women as well
[46:17.920 --> 46:24.400]  as other nations Strauss Khan was pulled off a jet at Kennedy Airport in
[46:24.400 --> 46:29.960]  New York by police Sunday after a hotel maid accused him of attacking and
[46:29.960 --> 46:35.600]  attempting to sodomize her the fact that Strauss Khan left his mobile phone at
[46:35.600 --> 46:40.960]  the hotel room suggests he tried to make a quick getaway however it's not the
[46:40.960 --> 46:46.520]  first time the IMF chief has been accused of rape French writer Tristan
[46:46.520 --> 46:51.920]  Bannon is now considering legal action after Strauss Khan for alleged sexual
[46:51.920 --> 46:56.160]  molestation that occurred in 2002 and people are scared of powerful folks and
[46:56.160 --> 47:00.600]  a lot of times won't report it till later according to Bannon during the
[47:00.600 --> 47:05.960]  course of an interview Strauss Khan acted like a rutting chimpanzee as he
[47:05.960 --> 47:10.480]  violently attempted to tear off her clothes Strauss Khan's alleged
[47:10.480 --> 47:14.960]  penchant for sexual assaulting women brings to mind the claims against his
[47:14.960 --> 47:19.120]  fellow globalist Al Gore which became public last year
[47:19.120 --> 47:26.320]  masseuse Molly Hagerty alleges that Gore invited her to his hotel room before
[47:26.320 --> 47:31.760]  pinning her down like a crazed sex poodle before groping her as she
[47:31.760 --> 47:36.000]  struggled to escape well he did more than that he hunched on her like a
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.840]  rutting chimpanzee till he and she reportedly has the clothing to private
[47:39.840 --> 47:44.560]  but the cops don't want it but Gore's behavior is a relatively tame compared
[47:44.560 --> 47:49.760]  to former president Bill Clinton Juanita Broderick went public in 98 to claim
[47:49.760 --> 47:53.960]  that Clinton raped her two decades earlier Broderick alleged that Clinton
[47:53.960 --> 47:58.720]  forced her down on the bed the hotel room tore away her underwear and began
[47:58.720 --> 48:03.120]  aggressively raping her while biting her lips well he better to hold her down
[48:03.120 --> 48:08.560]  that's Ted Bundy stuff as she begged him to stop although Clinton denied the
[48:08.560 --> 48:13.920]  charges he agreed to pay $850,000 to her in a settlement to avoid the case going
[48:13.920 --> 48:19.360]  to court a lot of money for someone who claims he did nothing as Larry Elder
[48:19.360 --> 48:23.360]  wrote despite the fact that Clinton publicly lied to the American people
[48:23.360 --> 48:28.320]  during the Monica Lewinsky scandal when he said I did not have sexual relations
[48:28.320 --> 48:32.240]  with that woman the numerous other women who have alleged affairs or who
[48:32.240 --> 48:35.520]  claimed they have been raped or molested by Clinton were all dismissed as
[48:35.520 --> 48:39.920]  liars because the feminist actually like this feminism isn't about empowering
[48:39.920 --> 48:43.680]  women it's about creating a cult of women to break up the family to isolate
[48:43.680 --> 48:49.600]  them so they can be sterilized and forced to work as slaves in the factories
[48:49.600 --> 48:54.080]  and so the state gets the kids continuing where all dismissed as liars by
[48:54.080 --> 48:59.040]  the corporate media just as Lewinsky was branded deceitful before she produced
[48:59.040 --> 49:03.600]  the semen stained dress that proved her story was true and just as
[49:03.600 --> 49:07.440]  Jennifer Flowers was also savaged by the establishment
[49:07.440 --> 49:11.040]  before Clinton during the Paula Jones deposition was forced to admit
[49:11.040 --> 49:15.680]  he did indeed have sex with Flowers however sexual molestation of women
[49:15.680 --> 49:19.120]  only scratches the surface of the deep and sorted
[49:19.120 --> 49:22.480]  circles that the power elite prefer to move in
[49:22.480 --> 49:25.600]  when it comes to acting out the forbidden perversions
[49:25.600 --> 49:29.680]  politicians such as Larry Craig and Mark Foley are lightweights
[49:29.680 --> 49:34.320]  in comparison to the horrors both those guys work closely in stopping crimes
[49:34.320 --> 49:36.960]  against children they help run the groups that protect the
[49:36.960 --> 49:41.440]  children politicians such as Larry Craig and Mark Foley are
[49:41.440 --> 49:45.200]  lightweights in comparison to the horrors of the underground sex child
[49:45.200 --> 49:49.360]  trafficking networks run exclusively for the pleasure of the elite
[49:49.360 --> 49:52.560]  as we documented almost every major pedophile network
[49:52.560 --> 49:56.560]  that has come under public knowledge has included tentacles that stretch high
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.720]  to the upper echelons of the global power structure
[50:00.720 --> 50:03.440]  and he could give you hundreds of examples he just gives a few
[50:03.440 --> 50:07.840]  on june 29th 1989 the washington times paul m rodriguez
[50:07.840 --> 50:12.640]  and george archibald reported on washington dc prostitution ring
[50:12.640 --> 50:15.120]  that had intimate connections with the winehouse
[50:15.120 --> 50:19.040]  all the way up to president george h w bush male prostitutes
[50:19.040 --> 50:22.800]  have been given access to the winehouse and
[50:22.800 --> 50:26.800]  the article also cited evidence of abduction and use of minors for sexual
[50:26.800 --> 50:33.840]  perversion uh member uh the congressman barney frank
[50:33.840 --> 50:37.280]  underage prostitutes out of his house he gave a press conference and he slapped
[50:37.280 --> 50:40.800]  his hand down on the table and he said you're going to drop this right now
[50:40.800 --> 50:44.160]  or i'm going to start giving names of congress and the fbi went yes sir
[50:44.160 --> 50:47.200]  have all the little kids you want he said that's right
[50:47.200 --> 50:51.360]  that's how it works so we've got to ask why they're busting con right now
[50:51.360 --> 50:54.880]  well he is the big socialist leader set to run against sarcosi the globalist
[50:54.880 --> 50:57.840]  minion so there's probably a little inner power struggle you know they're
[50:57.840 --> 51:01.120]  normally allowed to do this but now you're in trouble

[54:47.120 --> 54:52.960]  jeff gannon uh the gay porn star uh bringing in hundreds of male escorts
[54:52.960 --> 54:57.760]  under the white house on hundreds of occasions
[54:57.760 --> 55:01.920]  and then it continues in almost every case human trafficking for child sex
[55:01.920 --> 55:06.480]  slavery from chili to australia to bosnia to portugal to belgium
[55:06.480 --> 55:09.920]  court proceedings get shut down or diverted when a clear connection to
[55:09.920 --> 55:13.360]  the elites arises in the mid-1990s this caused
[55:13.360 --> 55:20.480]  national riots and demonstrations uh convicted child rapist mark doran new
[55:20.480 --> 55:23.680]  built a secret prison cell in his basement
[55:23.680 --> 55:29.040]  where he kept abducted young girls uh hostage at the behest of what he called a
[55:29.040 --> 55:33.920]  big crime ring which in 2004 court case was brought
[55:33.920 --> 55:40.480]  by many uh to encompass some of belgium's top politicians judges and
[55:40.480 --> 55:44.720]  policemen see psychopaths are into authority
[55:44.720 --> 55:47.520]  and so that's why they want to be cops they want to be judges they want to be
[55:47.520 --> 55:50.400]  politicians they don't want to be left alone
[55:50.400 --> 55:53.920]  they don't want to just have freedom to be

[55:57.360 --> 56:01.120]  have their people stick their hands down their your pants they want to break
[56:01.120 --> 56:05.120]  your will the reason why it took so long to
[56:05.120 --> 56:09.280]  apprehend doran new was he was being illegally
[56:09.280 --> 56:12.960]  protected by the same individuals and Watson has links to those mainstream
[56:12.960 --> 56:15.360]  articles material witnesses at the trial

[56:22.720 --> 56:26.400]  victims that manage to survive most were butchered snuff style
[56:26.400 --> 56:31.440]  after being raped verified the claims police actually visited doran news
[56:31.440 --> 56:36.320]  home and heard the cries for help from children
[56:36.320 --> 56:39.920]  concealed in his basement yet believed doran news explanation
[56:39.920 --> 56:47.760]  that the sounds were coming from kids playing soccer in the street
[56:47.760 --> 56:51.920]  he was eventually convicted for his role in the pedophile ring
[56:51.920 --> 56:54.960]  but the involvement of the elite of the country was never
[56:54.960 --> 56:58.720]  properly investigated and then the article continues after dinecore and
[56:58.720 --> 57:02.480]  Halliburton contractors were exposed as having operated child
[57:02.480 --> 57:05.520]  prostitution rackets we have links to mainstream articles there
[57:05.520 --> 57:08.720]  in the Balkans in the late 90s onwards and more recently

[57:11.360 --> 57:15.280]  attempted to get answers as to why the u.s government continued to do business
[57:15.280 --> 57:21.760]  with these corporations on march 11th 2010 we have a video link there
[57:21.760 --> 57:26.480]  McKinney grills secretary rumsfeld and general Myers
[57:26.480 --> 57:31.840]  on the dinecore scandal and its protection by the u.s government
[57:31.840 --> 57:36.240]  they responded by saying that they had been put in the penalty box for a short
[57:36.240 --> 57:39.680]  period but we're now being given government contracts again
[57:39.680 --> 57:44.400]  she pointed out they were never stopped from getting government contracts see
[57:44.400 --> 57:48.000]  they don't even get in trouble because they have this globalist
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.560]  fake immunity because they say they do just like tsa is saying we don't care
[57:52.560 --> 57:55.840]  what texas says or does we're still going to stick our hands down your
[57:55.840 --> 58:01.280]  daughter's pants because we like it because we're your bosses
[58:01.280 --> 58:06.000]  because we own you we're going to sexually molest you publicly

[58:10.160 --> 58:13.440]  worked in tandem with the pentagon to stall legislation
[58:13.440 --> 58:16.960]  that was specifically banned trafficking in humans for forced labor
[58:16.960 --> 58:21.600]  and prostitution by u.s contractors we have a link there the chicago tribune

[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.880]  coming up and i haven't even gotten through two pages
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.440]  appalled joseph watson's article dealing with
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.040]  the fact that if you want to be a part of the globalist upper inner circle
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:53.200]  you've got to at least be a rapist because it's just a manifestation of
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.880]  their attitude that we are all basically just
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.840]  pray to be fed on by them and that's why the whole media culture
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:07.760]  the whole mpr simpering
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:15.520]  hypnotizing voice is designed to put us in an in a childlike
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:21.440]  diminutive subservient position so the system can basically rape us
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.360]  financially and physically and it's why any type of
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.560]  strength from the citizenry any type of armament
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.560]  by the citizenry is seen as evil and horrible and dirty and dangerous but
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.840]  giant paramilitary forces erected against the people is seen as good
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.480]  this is just simply another signpost on our road to tyranny
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:46.000]  and we come back to the next segment i'm i'm going to finish up this
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.920]  article by paul joseph watson globalists like to rape women
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:54.960]  as well as nations i think we should add to this globalists like to rape
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:01.600]  women and children as well as nations and after all i mean they're all over
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.880]  the news selling us the torture is as american
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.960]  as apple pie attempting to twist us and turn us
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:14.880]  into basically versions of what they are
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.400]  artificially turning us into these suboid
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:27.120]  kind of ren fielesque a sister's helpers attendance
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.240]  to them so that the world can be turned into a hierarchical
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:38.400]  system playground a charnel house for the new world order control freaks
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.440]  so i'll finish up with that in the next segment
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.200]  and then secret weather weapons can kill millions
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:51.360]  warns top russian politician this is absolutely amazing they just brought

[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.960]  this coming up a little bit later secretary of defense
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:11.120]  cohen back in april 28th 2007 told army times
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.680]  that there are weather weapons tectonic weapons
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:19.520]  we know that there is a giant quasi-secret
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.480]  geoengineering program launched by the department of energy back in the
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:26.160]  mid 90s and they're just now getting around to having the cfr and others
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.280]  promoted to the general public so there's no doubt these programs are going
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.040]  on and then the globalists come out and say see
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.840]  pay us carbon taxes or protection money and then the earth will stop going
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.360]  through all this climate change it's just classic
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.400]  stage terror but secret weather weapons can kill millions warns top russian
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.120]  politician a top duma political leader
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.400]  caused shockwaves in recent television interview when he warned that russia
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.280]  could deploy an arsenal of new technology to destroy
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.400]  any part of the planet and kill over a hundred million people using secret
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.240]  weather weapons if the united states the u and in georgia tried to stop russia's

[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:22.800]  after the fall of communism the ldpr has deep links with the former kgb and
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.080]  communist party has become a significant force in russian politics
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:31.120]  despite zerenoski himself being branded as a militant neo fascist
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.400]  according to the translation provided by a russian speaker i'm going to cover
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.240]  this after i finish up uh yeah the russians have got it the chikoms have

[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:23.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:27.280]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:31.120]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.320]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose

[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:26.000]  there is an incredible breaking news report at prison planet dot com
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.840]  we're going to get this red linked up on info wars dot com
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:35.280]  secret weather weapons can kill millions warrants top russian politician
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:38.320]  i'm going to go over this article here in a few minutes
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:42.080]  when i finished up with this article that i started covering last hour
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.800]  by paul joseph watson and the point i'm trying to get at is this
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.080]  those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.680]  have you studied the decline of the roman empire and then the Byzantines that
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.560]  came after them have you studied what the french
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:00.080]  and british royalty did have you studied what the chinese royalty did if you
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.600]  studied what the toll tax and then the mayans and then the
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.680]  Aztecs did it's always the same like a tropism
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.160]  like a plant grows towards the sun societies
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:15.760]  have their flowering and science and technology and honor
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:20.480]  they become wealthy and then over time people begin to worship the sycophantic
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:24.080]  institutions and in the end it always
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:27.680]  you have top elites raping murdering killing
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:32.240]  bizarre sexual behavior gladiatorial events
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:40.240]  public sacrifices all basically designed to ensure
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:44.800]  that the general population will submit to whatever they're told to do
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.920]  these are rituals of submission to the kim jong il types
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:55.360]  like you have in north korea where the people are just under hellish degradation
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.520]  and like out of 1984 most parents have their
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:02.960]  children taken at birth and sent to other parts of the country
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:06.800]  so you never have a mother and a father in 1984 they talk about we're going to
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.760]  get to the point wenston obrien tells him as he's
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.880]  torturing him where children are taken at birth
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.640]  like eggs from a hen well north korea has already achieved that
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:21.200]  government and centralized dictatorial systems always
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.680]  even if you get a benevolent philosopher king up front
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:31.360]  always degenerate into abject hell with caligula marrying his horse and making
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.920]  it the head of the senate and nero running around dressed up as a werewolf
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.480]  publicly chaining people down and ripping their
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:42.960]  throats out with blood spraying all over him i mean i could go through more
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.680]  examples of this if you'd like the aztecs people
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.520]  begging to have their children's hearts cut out because it was such a
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:54.160]  such an honor the main meat supply that funded the priest class was
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:57.920]  humans hanging by their heels and the public coming up into the meat
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.760]  stalls getting select cutlets for themselves
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.680]  and people would say well that's just a culture well the nazis were a culture
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:09.120]  and we need to learn to judge these cultures now
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.640]  what comes up over and over and over again time after time
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.960]  in every culture with corrupt elites and what comes up time after time
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.880]  with the washington elite the imf world bank elite the british elite
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:26.320]  it constantly comes out and then no one is prosecuted
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:29.680]  or gets in trouble with these people raping women
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:34.400]  kidnapping children and i was reading cases
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:39.600]  out of europe uh and australia the list goes on and on with with with links to
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:43.600]  the un caught running giant child kidnapping rings
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:49.040]  halliburton dinecore uh having lobbyist full time and this is even in major
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.920]  newspapers just straight up who who who say we don't want it to be a
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.040]  federal crime for our contractors to run child kidnapping
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:02.720]  ranks i mean this is so incredible and we have
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:06.480]  links to the chicago tribune we have links to all the mainstream articles
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.680]  where they were the straight face i mean somebody grabs your kid off the
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:13.040]  street corner it's a big three alarm fire and the cops race
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.200]  around but when it's the globalist doing it or big contractors doing it
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.440]  is they don't even have a law
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.520]  in 2005 halliburton subsidiary kbr and dinecore lobbyist worked in tandem
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.680]  with the pentagon to stall legislation that worked specifically
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.400]  would specifically ban trafficking in humans for forced labor and prostitution
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:43.040]  by us contractors it's one of their biggest businesses
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.000]  where were the investigators and convictions in the cases of
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.520]  establishment orchestrated child slavery and prostitution like the nato
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.560]  officials responsible for the mushrooming of child prostitution in
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.080]  kosovo have a link to that bbc what happened to
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.920]  un officials identified as using a ship chartered
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.720]  for peacekeepers to bring young girls from thailand to east timor as
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.480]  prostitutes in every example the case seems to get
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.320]  shut down when the direct ties to people in positions of high power
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:17.200]  are established that's why they want a world government
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.240]  you ask why do the globalist want to set up a world government
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.760]  and then release bio weapons and reduce the world's population why do they
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:27.280]  openly state that why do they openly push for that in the united
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.840]  nations biological diversity assessment 1996 why do they openly push for that
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:36.080]  and state apartment random 200 why do they openly push for all of this because
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:41.120]  it's what they like they like the power over everyone they want the power of
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.160]  god a globalist sees an innocent three-year-old
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.920]  child and wants to rape and kill them wants to put cigarettes out in their
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:51.920]  eyes wants to keep them in a dungeon begging
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.520]  and pleading the sounds of a begging pleading three or four five-year-old
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:59.920]  girl is music to their ears it is abject
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:05.360]  torture for a normal wholesome person but a normal wholesome person
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:09.440]  just wants a decent house a car that works and wants to go play golf
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:15.200]  or wants to go see movies or wants to make pottery in their garage
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.880]  or wants to do woodwork or wants to go fishing
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.480]  we don't have this hunger for power these people do
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.840]  and and good people are gonna have to get organized and grow up
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.400]  because good people have a blind spot for this i can play you congressional
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.800]  hearings i played it many times where rumsfeld
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.800]  is confronted by congresswoman mckinney and she reads the reports about the
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.160]  child kidnapping rings and says why isn't dinecore in trouble
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.120]  and he says well i believe they were put in the penalty box they they weren't
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.480]  given contracts for a year and she says no they weren't he goes well
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.440]  that's just the way it is
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.960]  and he got very quiet and was scared rumsfeld never acts scared
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:59.120]  he got very quiet just just search rumsfeld confronted over
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:05.200]  child sex slaves into youtube and it'll come up
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:09.760]  the behavior of Strauss con gore clinton every other globalist underscores
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.280]  how our planet is being seized by people who are predators in more than one
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:17.440]  sense and those conduct and whose conduct illustrates
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:20.560]  how they deserve to be behind bars more than they do
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:26.160]  accumulating more and more power in a move towards global governance
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:31.040]  and i only read part of the article because we don't have time but
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:36.480]  it's very painful to know that in plain view
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.920]  they are allowed to do this and get away with it and then that begs the question
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.320]  why has dominique strauss con been busted because there's all these reporters
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:47.520]  and other women and people coming out in cases of the imf
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:51.280]  having to cover things up behind the scenes and make cash payments
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.400]  like clinton for raping the woman reportedly i mean he settled for
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:00.240]  eight hundred fifty thousand dollars that that's guilty right there folks

[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:04.160]  rutting chimpanzee jumping on you ripping your clothes off and uh it's this hyper competitive
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:11.040]  psychopathic energy that they have and quite frankly trying to rape women uh is literally the
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:18.000]  tip of the iceberg uh with these demons and uh this article by paul watson is so important
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:28.320]  because it details uh the entire history uh of these people and uh well it's a snapshot of many
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:34.000]  of their crimes to to prove to you that this is hidden in plain view you will read mainstream
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:41.680]  news articles about fortune 100 companies with lobbyists openly lobbying that that the u.s.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:47.520]  government not withhold contracts from them for kidnapping small children many of which
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.400]  that are shipped off to be raped and then have their heads blown off and they just do it in plain
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:26:03.040]  view so of course it came out six months ago in late 2010 uh that secret deals were signed
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:08.880]  with prudential and other top insurance companies to take all death benefits of world war two vets
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:14.960]  through current vets of course it's in the news today that obama is moving to take public and
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:23.040]  private pension funds of course these people uh are allowed to run giant child kidnapping rings
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:30.480]  publicly they do whatever they want whenever they want in our face and train us and break our will
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:40.720]  that they get to behave and act however they want now continuing here uh with the other news
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:46.880]  this is just incredible and i'll definitely bring this up to joel scowson
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:54.960]  because he does a lot of research on russia vladimir verinowski uh is the uh he's like
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.760]  probably the third most powerful person in russia heads up the only big opposition party
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:05.680]  secret weather weapons can kill millions warrants top russian politician this is up on prison
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:13.120]  planet dot com and i believe it is now up on info wars dot com uh but it just came out
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:20.640]  a little while ago uh yes it's up there secret weather weapons can kill millions warrants top
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:26.640]  russian politician a top demopolitical leader caused shockwaves in a recent television interview
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:32.240]  when he warned that russia could deploy an arsenal of new technology to destroy any part of the planet
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:36.960]  and kill over a hundred million people using secret weather weapons if the united states
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.440]  the un or georgia tried to stop russia's entry into the world trade organization
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:48.000]  vladimir verinowski is the vice chairman of the russian state duma and leader of the liberal
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:54.320]  democratic party of ldpr the first officially sanctioned opposition party after the fall of
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:00.800]  communism he almost became the prime minister via uh well the fall of the soviet union and
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:08.160]  then what happened with yeltsin the ldpr has deep links with the former kgb and the communist party
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:13.440]  and has become a significant force in russian politics despite verinowski himself being branded
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:18.480]  as a militant neo fascist according to a translation provided by the russian speaker
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:24.320]  during the interview uh verinowski went off on a bizarre tangent after he was asked how russia
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:28.880]  would treat countries like georgia and the united states who tried to block russia's entry into the
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.200]  world trade organization saying the american government in washington dc had no future
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:39.520]  and would collapse verinowski cited russia's supremacy in space stated the country had lots
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:45.120]  of money resources and new weapons that no one knows about with them we will destroy any part
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:51.680]  of the planet within 15 minutes he sensationally warned not an explosion not a ray burst not some
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:58.000]  kind of laser not lightning but a quiet and peaceful weapon added verinowski warning that
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:05.440]  whole continents would be put into sleep forever sounds like a tectonic weapon and that 120 million
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:14.000]  people would die if anyone interfered with russia's claim on the uh url islands which are subject to
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.960]  a territorial dispute with uh japan i guess that's the curl islands the female presenter of the news
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:26.560]  program smirked as he made the comments but verinowski's manner was far from jovial verinowski
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:31.840]  made a reference to the recent tsunami in japan suggesting the new weapons which he refers are
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:37.680]  related to weather control technology which has been intensely studied by both the us and russia
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:43.280]  since the 1950s and is commonly used today threatening to annex georgia completely verinowski
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:48.640]  warned and then there will be another tsunami on the other side of the planet in the caucuses we'll
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:57.600]  be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:14.960]  the v for victory uh folks you need to get this shirt and get it out in public this will be a
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:20.160]  great way to get people to initiate conversations with you and it's a great way to support the
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:26.080]  broadcast info wars dot com now joining us uh 15 minutes or so into the next hour if you can do it
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:31.840]  uh is joel scalson he's a political scientist by training specializing in the philosophy of law
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:38.320]  constitutional theory he of course is the nephew of clion scalson who wrote some of the
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:45.680]  premium of tomes uh on how the big mega banks fund the socialism and the communism to consolidate
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:51.360]  wealth and basically finance their communist uh and not see opposition he was also in the marine
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:56.960]  corps during the vietnam era and was a fighter bomber pilot uh and we appreciate joel scalson
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:04.160]  joining us he's the editor in chief of world affairs brief joel scalson dot com uh joel great
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:11.440]  having you here with us today uh so much happening uh let's get into the osama ben laden uh raid and
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:19.520]  and and and what your research shows is behind that well alex this was a carefully crafted political
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:26.480]  piece of theater uh that was uh made do i think had several first of all i think how it was pulled
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:31.680]  off so that legitimate steel team six could in fact think that they were killing bin laden and
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:36.320]  the pictures that they were shown the the various congressmen selective congressmen that could be
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:40.720]  being believable as i think that they had one of the two or three lookalikes that they have
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:45.840]  of osama bin laden but they've been parading for before the american public for the past ten years
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:54.400]  set up to be killed and uh it's very suspicious uh that uh you know there was no dialysis machine
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:40:01.840]  you can't have a man with near kidney failure in 1999 and clear into 2001 survived in the so-called
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:07.040]  caves of torah borah without a dialysis machine and even with a dialysis machine it's very rare
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:12.560]  to live that long uh of course two pakistani prime ministers former prime ministers have said that he
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:18.480]  was dead uh a long time ago and i think they're right so i think what happened is that you have
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:24.960]  used this lookalike for many many years to produce these propaganda videos you set him up to be killed
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:31.120]  look you know look at this compound in uh in this small city just blocks away from a military
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:36.160]  training school and headquarters i'm sure the people in the military in pakistan said yeah we
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:40.480]  know that's the u.s compound down there they control that so we don't go in there the biggest
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:46.160]  tallest house in the entire city you know ringed with barbed wire there's no way that anybody in
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:51.280]  this town wouldn't know that there was something going on there so you can't hide there but not
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.480]  wouldn't have been hiding in plain sight like that so i think this was a carefully crafted setup
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:03.280]  and its purpose frankly i think is to get obama reelected i think and i've analyzed in my world
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:10.320]  the first brief how that's going to happen you know flooding the republican uh candidacy with as
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:15.920]  many people they can jam in there they're throwing donald trump into the mix to try to pull off a
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:21.600]  ross perot type uh siphoning off of independent votes i think it's very very clear they're heading
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.200]  to give us another four years of obama incredible if that may sound
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:36.000]  you know what you're saying joel is exactly what my gut instantly told me we have the spy talk
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:46.640]  may 25th uh 2010 where they just had a high level cia agents off record tell the washington
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:53.520]  post that yes we did make a fake bin laden video showing him as a you know with as a homosexual
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:42:00.000]  but we didn't release that and then we have uh top experts cutting the other videos
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:06.720]  showing that uh it wasn't him and we have the fat bin laden uh who had suddenly gained a hundred
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:12.480]  pounds and had a bigger nose you have the old videos that our government had to admit were edited
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:20.160]  re-releases of real bin laden videos from 99 2000 so we have this history of admitted faking
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:26.720]  and that's what you need to do is get rid of the lookalights once the sum of bin laden era is over
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:31.040]  we have bbc talking to his neighbors saying i knew that guy and saying his name and saying
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:38.080]  yeah he looked like bin laden but he wasn't you know bin laden i mean ron paul looks like the
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:44.320]  actor that plays the guy in the uh x-men magneto i mean they they look almost identical that doesn't
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:49.840]  mean that that famous actor uh who i guess also plays gandalf and lord of the rings i forget his
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:54.320]  name doesn't mean that you know they're one and the same there are a lot of people that i've run
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:58.320]  into people in my life who look almost like me it's it's incredible you walk into a store and
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:05.040]  you're going uh you look like me well i look like you uh and and and so that fits exactly how they
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:09.840]  would operate i have to say that uh that's what jesse ventura said is they said they could have had
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:15.040]  a guy in there that looked like him uh and then how ridiculous to say they threw him in the ocean
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:20.480]  but you can trust us we've got a face print and we've got a dna test this is a government that's
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:26.800]  been caught lying about wmds you name it but you can't check out anything that the government has
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:31.520]  claimed me because virtually all the sources are owned by the government i mean even they say we've
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:36.640]  done a dna test well where did you get the original sample and if you didn't get an original sample
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:42.080]  which is difficult to get if unless he really was their agent uh but if you if you're using
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:47.120]  relative samples it takes far more than 24 hours to get a proper dna test and they were announcing
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:54.160]  this within 18 hours of when they claimed to have killed it so that's all all very very uh suspect
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:00.640]  what about i mean not just the reelection bit i mean that's pretty obvious i concur with you on
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:05.840]  that what about these saying well now that he's been killed the terror threats greater brace for
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:13.360]  160 al-qaeda nukes to go off uh then ap even ran with the ksm a guy been tortured for more than five
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:20.640]  years uh saying yes if you kill bin laden nukes will be detonated in europe or the us this released
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:26.800]  two weeks before the bin laden killing so you saw the prescripting and and and priming of the pump
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:33.840]  ahead of that i mean i'm really concerned about a false flag right now especially with the tsa
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:38.400]  rolling out the new presidential alerts they want to have commandeering the cell phones
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:44.640]  well i'm worried about uh false flag operation or an amtrak train it's not coincidental that
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:50.160]  senator charles schumer of new york is is touting that we need tsa type controls on amtrak
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:55.920]  and amtrak lackeys are going along saying yes we need that too they have used trains in europe
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:00.720]  they did one in spain they did one in england the us is uh is due for those and so that's
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:06.240]  probably the most likely thing i don't think we're going to see a uh a nuclear dirty bomb
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:12.000]  the reason i say that is i don't think they want people in america preparing against nuclear attack
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.840]  or war in any way whatsoever and that's my my reluctance to accept that but i do think that
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:24.320]  this is very very too good to be true to have a hundred thousand pages suddenly coming out
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:30.080]  uh you know with uh in their claiming too much that laden supposedly running around from safe
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:35.440]  house to safe house is not going to be able to accumulate a hundred thousand pages of intelligence
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:39.120]  for them to find in this particular house they wouldn't keep it in one place for one thing
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:44.720]  they never distributed but they never coded i mean this is just like the c i decided not
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:50.240]  only to bring in this lookalike to staff in the house but to load the house preloaded in fact
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:54.880]  they may not even had to actually preload anything who can tell what they found do you know what it
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:00.160]  would take to have to haul away that much material you know from this house well i saw headlines
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:04.720]  that there was a million pages not just a hundred thousand documents oh really it's up to a million
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:10.400]  now well they're obviously talking about and now they can say oh look here's the proof of 9 11
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:14.560]  i'm betting and i'm predicting that there it's at some point near the election they'll say here
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:19.920]  was the whole plan here's how they did 9 11 that's a replay of two magic passports falling
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:27.040]  down from the towers being found that day on 9 11 uh one of the hijackers bags getting stuck
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:34.000]  not getting on the plane with all the admissions i mean the evidence of the uh throw down weapon
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:41.600]  i mean that's evidence of it being staged yes absolutely there's so many uh indication that
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:47.280]  this was staged i mean hijackers don't take tax or don't take a van and leave uh you know
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:53.120]  perfectly uh tracing and they don't use credit cards to buy they use cash they take taxis
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:58.080]  to where they're going to do something like these are no more trained terrorists than these are you
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:02.080]  know paps is just like the underwear bomber and the shoe bomber i mean there's no trained
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:06.400]  terrorists who would not have known that you cannot light plastic explosives with a match
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:11.920]  and expected to to go up they must take americans for fools these are drugged out zombies i mean
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:17.840]  we first broke a month plus before the undersecretary of state kennedy had to admit an unnamed u.s
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:22.800]  intelligence agency said give him a visa help get him on the plane our witnesses saw the sharp
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:28.400]  dressed uh english-speaking man demanded security let him on the plane this person was so high
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:34.480]  powered he got him on the plane and mutala looked like he was drugged out of his mind oh and i think
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:39.520]  he was i think he was under drugs they really don't do mind control very well without the use of
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:44.960]  of some of these moods altering and mind-altering drugs sir hands sir hands now come out and said
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:50.400]  what people said from the beginning uh that he was drugged up and and and it was the same thing but
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:56.560]  regardless the the police there admitted that the shots were fired from another firearm uh they found
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:00.880]  the article throw that back up there oh some have been lauded and plotted to kill president obama
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:07.280]  report u.s intelligence officials who are currently analyzing over one million over one million pages
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:15.040]  of data why not two million joel why not a hundred billion well we do learn some of these things you
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.000]  know we learned that finally they got these stealth helicopters into operation i had a subscriber and
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.560]  to the world affairs brief who uh had an encounter with those in wyomingston three or four years ago
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:29.440]  and he said they really are silent sounds like just a big swooshing fan going by they have so many
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:35.600]  blades on these helicopters uh so they really can get in there and they of course had some stealth
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:40.240]  they probably made some composite type helicopters so that the radar signature would be very very
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:46.000]  low and they'd have to be very shielding uh discs around the blades but well as soon as i saw the
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.320]  tail section i said before it was even on the news not that i'm smart it's not hard i said that's
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:56.880]  stealth i said it's obviously some type of plastic look at the edges of it that are designed uh to
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:02.800]  absorb radar and then it did come out that it was a stealth helicopter i i mean i wonder what else
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:08.000]  they've got yeah and that's what keeps the russians and the chinese at day two they just keep
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.880]  wondering what else is the united god do we dare go to war with them and that's why they you know
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:18.880]  the u.s. has to keep goading them almost and it's like hillary clinton this week goading china about
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:22.880]  the human rights and attacking them that's not been the policy the government they've been
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:29.840]  toutowing and they've been excusing uh chinese behavior and all of a sudden hillary clinton comes
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:35.120]  out and attacks them full force in their own turf and that tells me they're trying to provoke
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:40.720]  more um bad blood there i think they're having trouble getting russian china to actually spring
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:45.920]  this world war three on the world but they've been planning for so long so this is one of the
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:53.040]  additional signs that they're starting to change tactics what do you make of the colorful latimer
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:59.760]  verinowski uh saying russia's got super powerful uh weather or tectonic weapons and that they can
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:04.880]  destroy the us whenever they want well you know i think that the russians have been putting out
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:10.240]  a steady stream of disinformation experts uh that have been focusing on the right wing in
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:14.240]  united states who have been full of a lot of conspiracy theories about harp and about the
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:18.960]  chemtrails and while i'm a believer in chemtrails because i have actually seen them with my own eyes
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:25.360]  going on uh nevertheless i've done a lot of research on this and it just the powerful
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:31.520]  forces necessary the multipliers necessary to induce earthquake or even weather changes are in the
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:38.720]  gajillion jewels and it's just incapable i'm very very skeptical that this is the reality
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:42.720]  happening though they're trying and i will admit they've been trying but i don't believe they've
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:49.760]  got the power to do that we know there's a lot of secret programs but uh you're saying the
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:55.120]  amount of power would be needed to generate this they don't have and i tend to agree with you unless
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:51:01.440]  you look at some of the 60s documents on using underwater nukes to cause tsunamis hi this is
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:06.320]  alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:10.880]  vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:15.360]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in

[01:53:55.600 --> 01:54:11.360]  canning lids the original since 1976 i tend to agree with joe about the fact that it takes
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:16.960]  more power than the globalist tab to trigger these massive events but we know they do have a lot of
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:23.760]  atmospheric manipulation with the barium salts aluminum dioxide to redirect or intensify weather
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:27.760]  systems that are already in place i've interviewed been living son the father of weather weapons who
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:33.600]  was successfully did this in vietnam but he did it with weather systems that were already developing
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:38.720]  we know that the stanford research institute certified in 68 that they could strengthen
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:44.080]  weaken or even kill hurricanes with classic cloud seeding technologies but shifting gears
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:51.280]  joel incredible news out of the economy china cuts holdings of us treasuries for the fifth month
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:57.040]  and so the federal reserves having to monetize more and more of those now the washington post says
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:04.400]  treasury to tap pensions to help fund government by cutting government pensions now again no
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:09.440]  no cutting of the trillions of the foreign bankers but now they're moving to cut government pensions
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:15.520]  only obama can do that with quote left cover uh claiming it that it's the republicans that
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:21.520]  want to slash everything but then meanwhile we see the imf and world bank in ireland going after
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:26.720]  the private pensions and we see the feds more and more moving to do that here what's your view of
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:32.720]  the state of our economy joel scalson well i think that uh we've got a situation which is
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:37.600]  unresolvable there's no way that either europe united states or any of the other major countries
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:44.880]  including japan are ever going to get out of their debt problems uh this is uh i mean we have shown
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:50.320]  just by the attempt by the republicans to try to turn back a measly 500 billion that they couldn't
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:56.080]  do it there's no political will there's so many large minority constituencies each one i don't
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:00.640]  want to give up my benefits whether it's medicare whether it's social security whether it's all of
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:06.880]  these they have huge constituencies there is no political will even those constituencies if they
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:13.120]  knew that the country would collapse if they didn't give up the benefits which benefits would say
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:17.920]  i still want them until the country collapsed that's the kind of mentality that we've got
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:24.960]  there's nobody who's got the courage to stop this now given that notice that the government did not
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:31.600]  when they ran up against the debt ceiling today they didn't say well we can't stop or we can't
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:38.240]  have any more debt they basically said baloney on the law we're going to go and tap into the federal
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:47.600]  pension fund but alex there is no federal pension fund to tap there is no iou fund for social security
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:54.080]  there is no fdic fund all of that has been admitted by govern is simply journal entries
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:58.320]  and they simply have to print the money and create the money with journal entries so this
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:03.920]  is going on as we speak the debt limit is not a hard feeling there is no way out of this they're
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:09.920]  simply going to continue to create fun to keep government going and i think everyone
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:14.560]  who's in the benefit corrupted class of america is going to support that that's why there is no
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:25.440]  solution and so what's going to happen well i think ultimately they have a problem come 2020
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:32.240]  2023 24 when they in fact all of the tax revenues go to pay the interest on the national debt
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:35.680]  then they've got a problem because they're technically bankrupt and that's why i think
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:41.360]  i will guarantee you alex they will give us a third world war before that happens so that
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:47.440]  they can have an excuse to walk away from all the debts debts because america has been taken down
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:52.080]  with a nuclear preemptive strike which these globalists have wanted now they have their
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:57.280]  bunkers they will continue to come out and they always of course put these contracts for the
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:01.440]  rebuilding of the world out to their own people just like they did in world war two so these
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:06.720]  people are not going to be hurt ultimately but the american people are and that will be the excuse
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:11.920]  to walk away that it was it's not our fault just like 9 11 this was an external attack
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:16.320]  we just have to start over and everyone will just nod their heads and go along and i think that's
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:23.600]  the the resolution they're looking at but i see the monetization of debt bringing this crisis to
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:30.960]  ahead within two or three years not 2020 but i agree with you regardless it's going to be the
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:35.760]  same aftermath we're back in one minute with jose calzen i saw an article last week about

[01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:12.720]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:21.680]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:27.920]  there's the headline from bloomberg apocalypse angst adds to terrorist threat as rich russians
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:37.760]  acquire bunkers we've got the u.s the russians building giant bunkers for their elites private
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:42.320]  individuals in government building them everywhere but then telling the public there's no threat
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:50.080]  there's no problem what's going on with the c o g system here and what do you make of the fact
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:55.280]  that the russians are expanding their own government bases underground and the new
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:00.000]  voration and billionaires over there are building these big deep bunkers for themselves
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:04.960]  i mean i don't think they're building money for nothing what's coming joel well i have a
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:09.520]  lot of information about this because i've been a high security architect for some 30 years and
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:16.560]  that's what i do in the architectural field is design and implement these bunker systems for
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:22.320]  people but fortunately i work for people on the on the right who are wise enough to see what's
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:28.240]  coming that the u.s is setting us up for war but let me tell you in my work around the united
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:34.080]  states i have found numerous builders especially in the colorado area telling me that they just
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:40.160]  done a bunker complex under various resorts and under private homes from and they're all from
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:46.640]  x t i a x n f a x government people these people know that something big is coming and they're
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:52.480]  building bunker systems underground and the russians know it too and that's why despite all
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:59.360]  the the ploy that has been perpetrated american people at the demise of the soviet union it never
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:03.840]  went into demise it was a carefully crafted deception the soviets are continuing to build
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:09.360]  look at yaman toe mountain yazinski mountain he's a huge underground bunker complex at the
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:15.680]  size of the washington dc metro area and our cia when the press talks about what do you think about
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:19.840]  yaman toe man ah we're not worried it's just defensive why do you know it's defensive they
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:25.840]  never been in it and uh you know you satellite photos i've seen the satellite photos against
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:30.400]  the five railroad track lines going into those entrances you don't see any cold cars going in
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:35.920]  there this is not a mining complex you know this is where they're building missile factories they're
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:41.040]  hiding most of their production which they intend to bring out i think after war starts but they're
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:46.880]  clearly both russians and chinese building for a time when they can strike the west and then come
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:51.440]  out on the other side uh winners in a nuclear by the way what about all the intel on germany
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:57.040]  secretly building up huge weapon systems uh just like they did before war war two have you gotten
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:04.160]  that intel well i'm pretty skeptical of that right now the the only thing that the germans are doing
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:09.520]  is preparing in their nato rule to essentially become the military force of the of the world
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:16.080]  government uh and to that extent they are building up some forces but it's not to you know because
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:20.640]  germany's planning on attacking europe they're planning on being in my opinion the military
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:31.840]  force of the new world order oh absolutely other ships submarines rapid deployment forces
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:38.240]  fighter aircraft they they are really building up as the heart of the e u military that's correct
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:43.360]  and that's why uh we're going to see that those forces continue to be used because nato needs
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:48.960]  to practice the u.s wants them to be drawn into this and over time they want to convince the europeans
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:53.520]  that there is a legitimate rule and that's why the uh german supreme court just ruled
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:04:00.880]  that in fact um parliament could not stop uh the german forces from rebuilding in their nato rule
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:10.000]  and a lot of this is uh obama openly said and put out a public letter he said his authority
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:17.920]  to have the u.s join and lead the nato attack on libya was the credibility of the un so congress
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:23.680]  hasn't even consulted the credibility of the un that is the precedent for nato the army of the
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:30.480]  un to go in and attack a country to try to kill its leader and to be backed by al-qaeda forces on
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:36.560]  the ground that's right and what's worse is you know i think the long-term goal is not only to
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:43.600]  capture the oil countries in africa to squeeze china just like they squeeze japan but i think
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:49.840]  they're getting america's use to continue a war under the un flag let's talk about that strategy
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:54.480]  on the other side and closing thoughts on other issues with joel scowles and straight ahead we'll
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:05:02.640]  get his take on what israel's doing right now libya you name it a very wealthy u.s citizen is
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:08.880]  predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in america in more than 50 years

[02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:29.760]  of gm bannie may freddy mac and america's biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact barons

[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:44.320]  96 with this info because it was public and last the last three years they've admitted this you
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:49.520]  know tacitly with atnt and the rest of it but it appears they're now getting ready to roll out
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:55.920]  the whole grid with headlines google wants to control your house and about all the new devices
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:01.840]  being standardized for government wireless systems to dial in and take control of them the smart
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:09.200]  meters uh on every front this system is going into high gear right now with the domestic police
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:14.720]  state and i think the timetables a little quicker than some people have been saying but uh what do
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:19.840]  uh what do you make of this uh announcements of the president's gonna be breaking in on your cell
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:23.520]  phone now and things is this getting us ready for the internet kill switch which is really a
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:30.720]  government takeover system well frankly i think it takes longer because you're gonna have a massive
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:35.680]  rebellion you start tampering with the internet right now unless you have a massive excuse to do
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:40.320]  so and that's why i don't think these in the martial law or taking down of the internet will
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:45.600]  occur until there's a major war scenario to justify that please me when i don't have to
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:50.720]  say this to you if you know that when you have a major attack going whether it's libya or whether
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:56.640]  it's uh any of the other nine eleven happened people just lay down and and acquiesce to whatever
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:00.880]  government wants i think they are prepping people i think they're getting used to it for
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:06.480]  frankly i wouldn't give uh two cents for any of the uh tenth amendment resolutions that any of the
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:12.960]  states passed for example utah passed it ten years ago and yet they have never enforced it once
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:18.560]  this is what i'd better say is governor perry of texas actually been enforced by arresting a tfh
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:24.720]  and having a confrontation with the fed over this i think they're bluffing and i think the fred
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:29.920]  will call their bluff just like they are in court now over the uh various states that have uh
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:35.520]  said that uh weapons are exempt from uh federal statute but the movement's bigger than it was
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:40.480]  ten years ago absolutely and we the people you know have to move in this direction just as the
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:46.160]  globalist incrementally build we've got a build towards that and i mean i agree with you that
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:50.560]  that a lot of states are still going to roll over that's our job is we the people to enforce this
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:56.560]  yeah i agree the movement is going it's getting bigger but boy i'll tell you i don't trust these
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:00.240]  state governors to actually stand up to any of this thing i think they're back down and so
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:05.280]  of a state attorney general's uh virginia attorney general's pretty good though could you know any
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:10.080]  this guy's uh i think the closest is somebody who could really champion this stuff but i'm not
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:15.840]  sure he will well i agree with you that people like perry i mean perry's an admitted bill
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:22.800]  de bergeron globalist all the way but something else is happening i have the state rep uh simpson
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:28.160]  on last week who wrote the bill and got it passed and they groped his wife they groped his children
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:34.320]  they upset him miss america up in dallas they stuck their hand down her pants uh jesse ventura
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:38.160]  i've been flying with him when they grabbed his genitals and they were laughing and they loved
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:42.000]  having the celebrity there and he was getting mad going this is each germany it's why i want to
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:47.280]  leave america i mean he he he was we went in eight after that because our plane was delayed
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:52.240]  and he was literally seething with anger this is not an act ron paul they've grabbed his genitals
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:58.400]  repeatedly when he flies to texas he's very mad they singly mount uh this is happening
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:02.960]  to so many prominent people that i think as the tyranny gets hotter and hotter i think they've
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:08.320]  gotten to the incremental point where they found the point in the sand where people are getting mad
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:12.640]  i mean it doesn't even matter if you're a globalist uh most of these you know people can't afford
[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:17.920]  private jets even dominate strouse com was flying on you know french airways at a certain point even
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:23.920]  if you're an insider somebody sticking their hands down your pants isn't going to cut it well you
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:28.800]  know it's amazing how easy it is to diffuse that just by tsa coming on saying oh we're going to
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:33.280]  modify this rule it doesn't matter if they modified only two percent as long as they come out and say
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:38.800]  that it's amazing what happens when the media uh you know it says something like that it's just
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:43.840]  like uh you know your guest uh steven pechenik would say you can't fly off the american people
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:48.880]  that's baloney you can fly up the american people every day and they do it every day
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:52.400]  you know as a psychological expert i can't believe that he'd make a statement you don't
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:57.120]  fly off the american people 9-11 was a tryout well he's trying to give people confidence
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:01.200]  and what he's saying is you can't sigh up american people uh that are thinking but but
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:04.960]  obviously when you're swimming in a sea of sigh up obviously the american people
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:10.240]  i mean he said they they got away with it on 9-11 i can't believe they're still getting away with
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:13.920]  it and in fact you were telling me there in a break you've got questions for dr pechenik
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:18.640]  i'm gonna be getting him back on soon to take calls and take questions what are some questions
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:25.680]  you've got for him joel well you know my questions are first of all this is the major question his
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:31.520]  solution to this his problem that is to us is our country is under great assault because of
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:37.360]  brock obama and because of george w bush here's a man who says he respects george h w bush the
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:41.760]  arch globalist who mentioned the new world order numerous times during the speeches he
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:47.520]  his mentor was laurence egilberger who's a globalist he's talked about advising and working
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:54.080]  with and having great respect for brent skokroft and henry kissinger bill gates i can't see how
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:59.920]  a person can ten years ago have fingered the establishment for 9-11 quoting a general saying
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:06.960]  9-11 was an inside job and not seeing that there was a massive movement behind that inside dark
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:13.360]  side of government and it's not george bush and not brock obama who are running the show you can't
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:20.560]  be as deep inside as dr pechenik says he is and not have seen that there's a dark side establishment
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:26.160]  i'd like you to ask him have you seen that dark side is there a conspiracy deep inside government
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:31.680]  that uses puppets like obama and george w bush as but aren't who aren't running the show have you
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:39.200]  seen that i'd like you see did you ask him that i will 100 asking that uh look i mean it's completely
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:46.160]  clear what's going on with steve pechenik when we have him on it is not a endorsement of everything
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:53.840]  he says or has done he is a high-powered insider he did co-author many of clancy's books and tv
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:58.720]  shows movies he is big you know big on the international movie database he is this top
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:03.680]  psychiatrist with these two degrees that did write a psychological warfare manual i look him
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:08.240]  up and there's london telegraph articles about him running the overthrow of you know italian
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:14.960]  prime ministers and and so the point is he's an insider who i had on once nine and a half years
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:20.080]  ago who said bin laden's been dead so obviously we get him back on when they now bring out this
[02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:25.920]  bin laden thing and so we i mean i i don't expect him to be jolescals and ron paul or alex jones
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:33.520]  uh i mean it is what it is he's an insider here giving us his view on things and if he came up
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:40.560]  and worked with reagan and worked with bush uh it's like albert spear the you know hitler's
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:44.320]  big architect he's they said well why didn't you know hitler was bad and he said when the
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:48.240]  devil's got his arm around you you don't know it uh but but i'm going to ask you some of those
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:54.560]  questions uh when we get him back on with us i've had him on to cover his bin laden angle
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:58.640]  and the intel he had uh you're not just saying well he had you know kidney failure and all
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:01.920]  this other stuff and couldn't live in the mountains this long i mean that's obvious
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:06.640]  that's just a side doctor statement it's the main issue is he had sources that said he was dead
[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:11.840]  and i've pressed him tell us who this top general is and he says i'm ready to go before a federal
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:16.800]  grand jury i didn't even know that was going to happen on the show you know it's kind of like
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:21.520]  we have the dc madam on the you know it doesn't mean everything the dc madam is saying and doing
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:27.600]  we're endorsing uh we're having the dc madam on so she can give us information i said i said hun
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:31.440]  if you know more info i wouldn't try to you know just go to prison they're going to kill you and a
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:36.880]  few months later they did kill her and so i told dr pechenek i said you know i mean look he's a guy
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:41.600]  from that inside he's anti-communist he thinks you know it's great all the things they did against
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:47.920]  the communist uh and uh you know maybe i should have you pop in if he agrees but i mean i don't
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:51.920]  know if he will or i mean i've certainly got your questions written down here to bring up some of
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:57.680]  those uh i mean what do you expect when a big insider comes out and starts whistleblowing i mean
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:01.600]  that's why a lot of whistleblowers don't come out because people are going to say well you come
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:08.880]  from this system and so we don't like you or we don't trust you uh i mean i think it's a process
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:14.000]  for people you know as you're being a whistleblower to come out it's kind of like civil edmunds coming
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:21.440]  out and saying she was breaking down the fbi transcripts of uh uh of uh you know al qaeda
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:25.200]  being run by the west and look at all what she went through yeah but look at the difference
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:29.520]  alex look at the difference she doesn't claim that she's still consulting for government that
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:35.520]  they still hire pechenek is claiming that he still got insider kind of believe me if he'd taken
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:42.000]  this position uh and really openly pushed it he wouldn't have been able to uh stay within government
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.240]  wouldn't have been able to hire he wouldn't have been cut off from all of his uh his contact just
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:52.240]  like civil edmunds has done every true whistleblower has literally been black i do believe in fact i've
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:56.000]  talked to him privately i think he got kicked lost his at the check with him i believe he lost his
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.880]  fellowship at the cfr and actually nine and a half years ago when he came on this is on record
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:05.600]  i talked about at the time he called and he said i'm losing my pentagon contracts i got big heat
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:11.440]  on me right now can you take down in fact i'll bring this up next time he's on can you take down
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:18.240]  the transcript and i said sorry doc it's already out so he did go through the ringer for it and i
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:22.800]  think i'm doing more research on him at least he said he said he did but he's also been saying
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:28.800]  that he still you know works for government and uh well i think his statement is joel his statement
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:34.160]  is and again i'm not even defending him i'm putting out what he said is that he still admires the
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:41.360]  military believes they're good people and and and i mean he's basically separating corrupt
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:46.080]  influences of the dark side as you talk about with what he's saying do you see where i'm going with
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:51.840]  that yeah i do let's ask him that see how you respond okay i don't want to end on this point
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:54.880]  joel i want you to be able to say any other points you got about pechenik let's come back to one more

[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:29.200]  to him when we get him back on the show uh hopefully later this week i need to call him back
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:35.840]  called me over the weekend very good questions i i i think the larger question is as the more
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:42.240]  research i do on pacenic actually the more high power and i found out he is i just just i search
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:48.560]  his name and find all sorts of just incredible stuff going back in for decades and major newspapers
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:55.520]  what he's done behind the scenes and obviously he has spoken for the establishment many times and
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:02.560]  basically been a powerful powerful gopher for them and my mother thinks that this is some
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:07.680]  segment of the establishment threatening another segment of the establishment she said that and
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:11.920]  i had him back on and hadn't really said that and pacenic basically said that i know this
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:17.280]  is going right in the white house you better listen don't do another false flag but i will
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:22.000]  specifically drill down and ask him those questions and i'm glad that joel scalson of world affairs
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:29.120]  brief has uh brought that up joel any other questions for him when i get him on yeah i wanted
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:33.440]  to address that specific threat i heard that interview where he talks about you know don't
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:38.240]  dare pull another false flag the american people won't stand for it and then he did that but the
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:43.200]  military and intelligence community won't stand for it now look i've been in government myself
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:49.440]  uh and in the military and i'll tell you they don't allow real dissenters to stay within the
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:54.720]  military the intelligence community they are all yes man especially at the highest levels
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:26:00.400]  i just frankly do not believe he knows what he's talking about and i even question is inside a
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:06.080]  relationship if he actually with a straight face claims that there are as a significant body of
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:11.920]  intelligence and and military people who rebel against the president i don't believe it well we
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:16.800]  have seen colin pal's deputy come out and say that bush didn't want bin laden and we are seeing a lot
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:22.960]  of uh people i mean we saw ray mcgovern get arrested bringing up the lies about w md's
[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:29.840]  you know talk are being thrown out uh with rumsfeld um i mean joel but he's out nobody in the office
[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:35.120]  has ever bucked him it's just like butch kneel you know when pdd 60 came out uh instructing the
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:40.880]  mill for forces you know not to absorb a nuclear first strike which is just suicide and he didn't
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:46.560]  say a thing when he got out of office he told me he said you know yeah i i said privately it's
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:51.840]  you know retaliate with what once you take away but he didn't come out publicly i mean even good
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:27:00.800]  people like butch kneel so i'm just not very uh i just don't think but a person is is is talking
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:06.400]  reality when he claims that there's a movement within the american uh military or intelligence
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:10.960]  community buck the establishment the president it's more than just the president there's a powerful
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:15.920]  establishment that can knock off dense foster and anybody else that gets in the way hey what do you
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:24.080]  make of this dominates trouse con situation well you know these globalists uh whether it's the uh
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:29.040]  the thotties that go along with the globalists that they're corrupt is can be they have immunity
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:33.520]  they know they can get away with it but i think you hit on something which you talked about
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:39.040]  it's the fact that here he was threatening sarcosi and there is infighting that goes on there is a
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:45.280]  leftist element with the globalist in in europe and there's a pro-american anglo anglo america
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:50.560]  and con is the admitted leader of the socialist notice international banker leader of the socialist
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:55.040]  i get these idiot emails going well socialists are against the bankers oh really it's the big
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:28:01.200]  bankers that wrote the communist manifesto folks i mean uh they want a central bank and a uh
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:09.120]  gradual income tax public school uh i mean all the things they've set up this guy's rape numerous
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:14.080]  people before and they're threatened to come out of the woodwork now to add to his charges even in
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:19.840]  europe so this guy may be just uh they may just have put a news around his neck yeah i agree it's
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:25.120]  not that he didn't do the rape uh he's got a long history of this type behavior it's that now they're
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:31.680]  burning him yeah they're they're they're burning him sometimes you know uh they have to play like
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:36.640]  this i mean it'll really be telling if they let this guy off then you know that he still got the
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:40.720]  immunity that was promised that he made it he made a mistake and they had to cover up and it took
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:45.760]  him a while to cover up but if they burn this guy it's because they were trying to protect sarcosi
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:52.000]  because he's been a good lapdog uh what for the angle american absolutely especially in
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:57.120]  this liviant thing i mean the sarcosi has taken all the hit you know for getting nato back into
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:02.000]  this liviant thing even against the wishes of their people and it's not over yet i'll tell you what's
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:06.800]  interesting about this international scenario is they've engendered all of these arab revolts around
[02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:11.280]  them but the arab tyrants are really digging in their heels and they're not going down easy they saw
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:16.800]  what happened in mubarak and liviant's digging in qaddafi's digging in and asad and siri is really
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:23.520]  digging in he wants to do what barain did and beat this rap and uh so i think that even though the
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:28.880]  global has started this they're not going to be able to finish this necessarily as easy as they thought
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:35.040]  we ran out of time on the sovereign citizen 60 minute piece but we're going to be covering that
[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:40.480]  tomorrow and we've got one of the guys demonized on joel scousen thank you so much for spending
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:44.480]  time with us we'll be right back folks with the demonization of the patriot movement

[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:06.240]  structure and his world outlook are genocide this is a book called ecoscience this is a cookbook
[02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:14.160]  for the extermination of humanity to provide a high quality of life for all there must be fewer
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:22.400]  people says holdren he says you could do this by putting chemicals in food and water he wants to
[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:29.760]  have licenses for birth what happens to people that are born illegitimately meaning without a birth
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:37.680]  permit compulsory abortion think about that he even writes about infanticide in order to enforce
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:47.280]  this he talks about a supranational monstrosity that he calls a planetary regime this means
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:55.840]  a world empire a supranational one world government that would attempt to control all details of human
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:44:01.680]  life this is an ultra hitlerian genocidalist who's today operating out of the white house
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:09.040]  in washington dc and it's time to kick him out oh it's powerful oh man i was supposed to go home
[02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:13.600]  the other night date dither and the phone was off my wife was ringing and ringing and i sat in there
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:21.120]  for an hour and a half watching what what uh jacobson's put together and and and the trailer
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:26.160]  doesn't even do it justice i could not stop watching it even though i've read most of ecoscience
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:30.720]  and these other documents and knew it the way tarply laid it all out in the history of mouth us and
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:35.600]  their whole this is the globalist philosophy why shouldn't they rape women in hotel rooms or
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:40.320]  kidnapped little kids they think we're cockroaches that are there to serve them they believe it's
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:45.520]  their right to kill us because they're in control i'm telling you folks good people have got to grow
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:50.400]  up look i know why a lot of you don't believe this stuff or won't check it out it's because
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:57.280]  you can't believe people are like this you can't believe nero dressed up in werewolf outfits and
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:02.240]  killed people publicly biting their throats out it's on record mainline roman history
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:07.200]  caligula that came after him uh was it before him uh married his horse and made it the head of the
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:13.040]  senate and basically worshipped its droppings i mean you can't make this up the astex cut little
[02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:19.040]  kids hearts out i mean i could go on for hours here every culture at the end of the day demands
[02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:25.120]  people hand their kids over for the priest class to murder them and rape them oh that went on all
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:30.480]  these places too i mean what you get is child murdering rapists that like to dress up as demons
[02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:37.360]  and bite chunks out of people run things okay when societies allow it and and and societies always
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:43.680]  fall once the vampires get controlled the vampires start taking control the society starts getting
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:50.320]  sick the vampires take control of the culture they sell their murderous death and stink as something good
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:58.320]  and uh then things fall apart and finally we hold the vampires out in the full light of day
[02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:03.200]  that's a metaphor and they burst into flames ladies and gentlemen it's like why couldn't i see it
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:10.000]  before why didn't i do something about him before i don't like bullies i don't like thugs i don't

[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:38.800]  believe the incredible birthright we've been given to live on this beautiful planet and to enjoy
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:45.520]  all of these incredible blessings and i see all these unhappy people that do not appreciate
[02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:53.040]  the food we've got and the success and the shelter and because we have had all our basic
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:47:00.400]  needs satiated on the surface people have forgotten what's really valuable and what created all the
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:11.120]  wealth the basic rights the basic hard-earned liberties and i just love life i love beauty i
[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:16.000]  love good things i want to protect beauty i want to protect innocence and anytime i get a little

[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:05.680]  and if i die in the process so what that's what i'm supposed to do nothing the tree of liberty
[02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:10.000]  must be water with the blood of patriots and tyrants and i am fighting in the info war

[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:20.800]  supreme court cases even the last few decades so they teach you you will follow whatever government
[02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:25.600]  says we're allowed to torture but that's against the law shut up conspiracy theorist we're allowed
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:30.720]  to stick our hands down your pants well no you're not shut up conspiracy theorist sovereign citizen
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:36.400]  and in this piece they they show somebody in a shootout with the cops and it cuts to the cop
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:41.280]  going if we didn't know and they were sovereign citizens you know those cops would still be alive
[02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:46.400]  saying they've got to track everybody that wants to end the fed track everybody that wants to get
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:52.960]  america back sure there are nuts out there they're gonna you know get into any movement uh but the
[02:55:52.960 --> 02:55:59.440]  point is they want to freak cops out and when you get the documents over 90 percent of it is all
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:04.640]  about sovereign citizens but then they lump people into the more extreme sovereign citizens
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:10.720]  who are just mainline ron paul supporters or get us out of the un then the feds bomb oklahoma city
[02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:15.600]  to then try to tie the whole movement to that and that's on record so this is how they're
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:22.160]  operating they infiltrate our groups try to radicalize us they do all of this uh and they
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:27.040]  go on to talk about paper terrorism well people are having their farm their ranch taken so the
