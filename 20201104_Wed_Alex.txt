[00:00.000 --> 00:14.560]  Well, thank you very much.
[00:14.560 --> 00:19.120]  Thank you.
[00:19.120 --> 00:20.120]  Thank you very much.
[00:20.120 --> 00:21.120]  Please sit.
[00:21.120 --> 00:22.120]  Thank you.
[00:22.120 --> 00:32.520]  This is, without question, the latest news conference I've ever had.
[00:32.520 --> 00:37.400]  I appreciate it very much, and I want to thank the American people for their tremendous
[00:37.400 --> 00:38.400]  support.
[00:38.400 --> 00:46.400]  Millions and millions of people voted for us tonight, and a very sad group of people
[00:46.400 --> 00:52.000]  is trying to disenfranchise that group of people, and we won't stand for it.
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.320]  We will not stand for it.
[00:57.320 --> 01:03.640]  I want to thank the First Lady, my entire family, and Vice President Pence, Mrs. Pence,
[01:03.640 --> 01:14.680]  for being with us all through this, and we were getting ready for a big celebration.
[01:14.680 --> 01:19.640]  We were winning everything, and all of a sudden it was just called off.
[01:19.640 --> 01:25.440]  The results tonight have been phenomenal, and we are getting ready, I mean literally,
[01:25.440 --> 01:31.880]  we were just all set to get outside and just celebrate something that was so beautiful,
[01:31.880 --> 01:36.080]  so good, such a vote, such a success.
[01:36.080 --> 01:39.600]  The citizens of this country have come out in record numbers.
[01:39.600 --> 01:40.600]  This is a record.
[01:40.600 --> 01:42.600]  There's never been anything like it.
[01:42.600 --> 01:47.840]  To support our incredible movement, we won states that we weren't expected to win Florida.
[01:47.840 --> 01:48.840]  We didn't win it.
[01:48.840 --> 01:57.280]  We won it by a lot.
[01:57.280 --> 02:01.600]  We won the great state of Ohio.
[02:01.600 --> 02:16.680]  We won Texas by 700,000 votes, and they don't even include it in the tabulations.
[02:16.680 --> 02:28.880]  It's also clear that we have won Georgia, and we're up by 2.5 percent or 117,000 votes
[02:28.880 --> 02:31.120]  with only 7 percent left.
[02:31.120 --> 02:32.120]  They're never going to catch us.
[02:32.120 --> 02:33.920]  They can't catch us.
[02:33.920 --> 02:45.840]  Likewise, we've clearly won North Carolina, where we're up 1.4 percent or 77,000 votes
[02:45.840 --> 02:48.560]  with only approximately 5 percent left.
[02:48.560 --> 02:50.640]  They can't catch us.
[02:50.640 --> 02:58.600]  We also, if you look and you see Arizona, we have a lot of life in that, and somebody
[02:58.600 --> 03:03.560]  said, somebody declared that it was a victory for us, and maybe it will be.
[03:03.560 --> 03:05.680]  I mean, that's possible, but certainly not.
[03:05.680 --> 03:08.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I told you this was coming.
[03:08.640 --> 03:10.520]  It wasn't hard to predict it.
[03:10.520 --> 03:12.520]  In fact, it wasn't a prediction.
[03:12.520 --> 03:16.800]  The Democrats war-gamed it, and they said, we're going to lose.
[03:16.800 --> 03:21.240]  We're going to call it a red mirage, and then we're going to stop the ballot boxes with
[03:21.240 --> 03:27.800]  hordes of the 80 million ballots we've got in facilities around the battleground states.
[03:27.800 --> 03:32.280]  And now we have the videos in Pennsylvania, the videos in Michigan, the videos in Wisconsin,
[03:32.280 --> 03:37.080]  the videos in Georgia, the videos in North Carolina, the videos in Nevada, the videos
[03:37.080 --> 03:43.920]  in all these places, Arizona, of just poll workers unauthorized with just boxes of ballots
[03:43.920 --> 03:47.040]  going in and out, putting them in their cars, leaving, driving around with machines.
[03:47.040 --> 03:50.240]  I've got all these videos right here, all these different articles.
[03:50.240 --> 03:54.000]  But of course, it's all the COVID lockdown.
[03:54.000 --> 03:55.000]  It's the fraud.
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.880]  It's the 80 million ballots that are illegal.
[03:56.880 --> 03:57.880]  It's all of it.
[03:57.880 --> 04:02.680]  It's the illegal alien stressed around the block in California and New York and other
[04:02.680 --> 04:06.160]  places to get driver's license so they can vote.
[04:06.160 --> 04:10.600]  And so we're having a multinational consortium take this election from us.
[04:10.600 --> 04:18.960]  I didn't want to scare people, and so it's not lying, but I hinted at it, but I didn't
[04:18.960 --> 04:19.960]  want to say it.
[04:19.960 --> 04:20.960]  Trump's going to lose.
[04:20.960 --> 04:21.960]  Okay?
[04:21.960 --> 04:22.960]  He's going to get removed.
[04:22.960 --> 04:24.160]  They're going to probably send nukes off.
[04:24.160 --> 04:25.160]  Okay?
[04:25.160 --> 04:26.160]  You're all going to be starving to death soon.
[04:26.160 --> 04:27.160]  I'm not kidding.
[04:27.160 --> 04:29.320]  This is a chai-comg globalist takeover, people.
[04:29.320 --> 04:32.240]  We're all in grave damn danger.
[04:32.240 --> 04:33.240]  I'm serious.
[04:33.240 --> 04:35.040]  They're getting ready to take this country down.
[04:35.040 --> 04:40.080]  Now, Trump can still win, but the way things are going, they're probably going to say he
[04:40.080 --> 04:41.560]  lost and they're going to kill him.
[04:41.560 --> 04:43.560]  I got to smell it.
[04:43.560 --> 04:47.240]  And you know, I told you Fox News would start declaring states first early.
[04:47.240 --> 04:48.920]  You saw them do it.
[04:48.920 --> 04:50.920]  I've got these enemies figured out.
[04:50.920 --> 04:58.480]  I'm going to tell you what I really think when we come back and stay with us.
[04:58.480 --> 05:03.600]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshiped for thousands
[05:03.600 --> 05:05.400]  of years by ancient civilizations.
[05:05.400 --> 05:09.280]  But with modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[05:09.280 --> 05:11.120]  It's antioxidant effect.
[05:11.120 --> 05:14.080]  It's anti-inflammatory effect.
[05:14.080 --> 05:16.280]  Everything it does is simply amazing.
[05:16.280 --> 05:19.880]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[05:19.880 --> 05:29.600]  They're 3 to 5% curcuminoid, but we have bodies ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid
[05:29.600 --> 05:30.600]  level.
[05:30.600 --> 05:34.800]  We have other organic products in there that accelerated and bring it to the cells of the
[05:34.800 --> 05:35.800]  body.
[05:35.800 --> 05:36.800]  It's been sold out for months.
[05:36.800 --> 05:37.800]  It's back in stock.
[05:37.800 --> 05:44.120]  And despite that, bodies ultimate turmeric formula at InfoWarsTour.com is 50% off with
[05:44.120 --> 05:48.280]  free shipping and triple-patriot points at InfoWarsTour.com.
[05:48.280 --> 05:50.400]  It's bodies ultimate turmeric formula.
[05:50.400 --> 05:56.080]  If you haven't tried it, learn why it's got thousands of 5-star reviews at InfoWarsTour.com
[05:56.080 --> 05:57.080]  and you can't lose.
[05:57.080 --> 06:04.080]  So here's what's the InfoWarsTour.
[06:04.080 --> 06:18.880]  Well, it's now November 4th and the election's not over.
[06:18.880 --> 06:32.600]  In fact, even corporate media is calling it the days of hell.
[06:32.600 --> 06:37.480]  The nightmare is here because they're going to really love to moralize in this country
[06:37.480 --> 06:39.160]  further and split it down the middle.
[06:39.160 --> 06:40.920]  And why shouldn't they try to steal it?
[06:40.920 --> 06:44.000]  Because they're not going to get in trouble for doing it.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.840]  They don't get in trouble flying little kidnapped kids around on airplanes.
[06:46.840 --> 06:50.920]  They don't get in trouble having the crazy man Bill Gates that says he wants to be populate
[06:50.920 --> 06:54.320]  the earth, announced that he's your doctor.
[06:54.320 --> 06:58.400]  You're going to have to have medical passports to travel and to have a job and it's being
[06:58.400 --> 06:59.760]  rolled out now.
[06:59.760 --> 07:05.160]  He told you nine months ago it was coming, now it's here.
[07:05.160 --> 07:10.200]  Like the shining with Jack Nicholson hacking through the door with his fire axe, except
[07:10.200 --> 07:11.560]  this isn't a movie.
[07:11.560 --> 07:18.400]  This is Bill Gates hacking through with his fire axe of deadly mRNA vaccine and you read
[07:18.400 --> 07:25.040]  what it does and how it makes everyone sick in one study, 100% get deathly ill.
[07:25.040 --> 07:27.880]  Another study, 80% get sick, 20% go to the hospital.
[07:27.880 --> 07:37.200]  He's hacking through the door going, here's Johnny and we're just supposed to love it.
[07:37.200 --> 07:42.800]  They want to visit violence on us and not have us have a way to fight back and again
[07:42.800 --> 07:46.200]  if Hitler would have just had an inoculation program in Europe he could have killed everybody
[07:46.200 --> 07:49.720]  to make sure the vaccine kills you in 5, 10 years.
[07:49.720 --> 07:51.800]  There's all these new diseases, no one knows what hits them.
[07:51.800 --> 07:52.800]  The media covers it up.
[07:52.800 --> 07:59.360]  I mean that's really where all this is going and Trump was trying to derail this absolute
[07:59.360 --> 08:08.640]  champion working his ass off 4, 5, 6 rallies a day that we have the satellite feed, Biden
[08:08.640 --> 08:12.440]  set to have a rally in Atlanta, Georgia and how do you know it's a Biden rally because
[08:12.440 --> 08:13.440]  there's no one there.
[08:13.440 --> 08:16.800]  What do you call an empty parking lot, a Biden rally?
[08:16.800 --> 08:23.000]  What do you call an empty church, a Biden rally?
[08:23.000 --> 08:33.120]  And that is the creature that the global CHICOM establishment is about to force on us just
[08:33.120 --> 08:38.080]  like they're going to force everything else until we start saying no.
[08:38.080 --> 08:39.080]  But it's crazy.
[08:39.080 --> 08:40.080]  He can hardly talk.
[08:40.080 --> 08:46.760]  His sons call the laptop with him in total corruption being bought off by the head of
[08:46.760 --> 08:51.520]  Chinese intelligence and it's all confirmed and the FBI is going to do nothing but shine
[08:51.520 --> 08:57.080]  his shoes when he gets into office and then within six months they'll say he's got a brain
[08:57.080 --> 09:02.400]  tumor or he died of COVID or something and then he'll fade off into the sunset and we'll
[09:02.400 --> 09:07.840]  have Kamala and God only knows probably she'll pop another woman up there so when you criticize
[09:07.840 --> 09:12.440]  her you're like you just don't like a strong woman that got less than 2% of the Democrat
[09:12.440 --> 09:13.440]  primaries.
[09:13.440 --> 09:14.440]  I mean they don't even want her.
[09:14.440 --> 09:19.320]  It's like force feed, force feed, force feed, force feed, force feed.
[09:19.320 --> 09:24.000]  I mean Tulsi Gabbards has enough charm, I don't agree with all of her policies that she probably
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.680]  would have beaten Trump, but see she doesn't follow all their orders.
[09:28.680 --> 09:31.480]  She's anti-war.
[09:31.480 --> 09:37.760]  She's not devil-worshipper material and so she can't be in the club because she's not
[09:37.760 --> 09:43.160]  a hunchbacked Crip Keeper pedophile with a bunch of pedophile kids and a bunch of drug
[09:43.160 --> 09:49.880]  addict trash that literally have sold the country out, I mean you could get billions
[09:49.880 --> 09:54.600]  personally from the Chinese for what Biden sold out, but he was doing it for millions.
[09:54.600 --> 09:58.480]  I mean he's a cheap thug.
[09:58.480 --> 10:08.280]  He's a pimp and that's who the globalists want, someone ugly and stupid like them because
[10:08.280 --> 10:11.680]  you know the globalists have inherited all their wealth three or four generations down.
[10:11.680 --> 10:16.360]  They just have bureaucracies that do it all for them and they have so much money they're
[10:16.360 --> 10:19.680]  able to buy whatever they damn well want, don't they?
[10:19.680 --> 10:25.360]  Now I'm going to tell you what I really think and I told you what I think and I begged all
[10:25.360 --> 10:26.360]  the Q people.
[10:26.360 --> 10:31.160]  I said the storm's got to be you and the storm's got to be us countering them.
[10:31.160 --> 10:36.520]  You cannot hope for these secret groups because it's not going on.
[10:36.520 --> 10:41.880]  There are good patriots inside government, but they tell me they're outnumbered, outgunned,
[10:41.880 --> 10:43.960]  surrounded and they need our help.
[10:43.960 --> 10:47.400]  Not everything's handled trust the plan.
[10:47.400 --> 10:51.680]  And so I know so many people that just said, oh Alex relax, you know, they're real experts
[10:51.680 --> 10:53.000]  and I handle all this.
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.000]  It's delusional.
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.960]  Fucking Raiders the Lost Ark at the end.
[10:59.960 --> 11:02.600]  They're the two top guys on it and they're like, hey, we're going to follow up and research
[11:02.600 --> 11:05.880]  the ark down and we have it and they go, oh, we don't need you anymore.
[11:05.880 --> 11:10.520]  You've got top men.
[11:10.520 --> 11:12.120]  The truth is they don't have anything.
[11:12.120 --> 11:14.320]  They go stick it in a damn warehouse.
[11:14.320 --> 11:20.920]  And so that's where your freedom is going is into a black hole.
[11:20.920 --> 11:24.640]  So here's the deal.
[11:24.640 --> 11:31.200]  They're going to deliver as many balances they need in Pennsylvania and in Michigan and
[11:31.200 --> 11:34.600]  in North Carolina and all these places.
[11:34.600 --> 11:39.000]  Nevada, Nevada was releasing balance up to the minute.
[11:39.000 --> 11:40.720]  Now they go, oh, we're pausing.
[11:40.720 --> 11:46.280]  We'll tell you who the winner is tomorrow so they can broker power deals and get all
[11:46.280 --> 11:49.200]  their stuff together because there's so much fraud.
[11:49.200 --> 11:53.120]  They don't want to do what happened in Wisconsin where more people voted for Biden than were
[11:53.120 --> 11:54.680]  registered voters.
[11:54.680 --> 11:56.920]  He got over 100% of the votes.
[11:56.920 --> 12:00.480]  I went to the New York Times, his own numbers, the Washington Post own numbers and checked
[12:00.480 --> 12:02.720]  them with the federal numbers.
[12:02.720 --> 12:03.840]  I've got that in the stack.
[12:03.840 --> 12:09.560]  Did you hear what I just said, Wisconsin, Joe Biden got over, we're trying to do the
[12:09.560 --> 12:21.480]  math right now, over 100% of the vote for registered Democrats.
[12:21.480 --> 12:26.040]  That's Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Lucky Charms territory right there.
[12:26.040 --> 12:28.000]  Because they just don't care.
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.080]  They don't care anymore.
[12:29.080 --> 12:31.360]  They tell you there's not men and women.
[12:31.360 --> 12:32.360]  There's not two genders.
[12:32.360 --> 12:35.640]  You know, they tell you convicted pedophiles come to your school and your five-year-old
[12:35.640 --> 12:39.880]  bounces on their erection through their pants.
[12:39.880 --> 12:44.840]  I mean, dudes come to your school with no pants on, with glitter on their penis, and
[12:44.840 --> 12:52.240]  children jump on it, but then listeners will call and complain as I said the P word.
[12:52.240 --> 12:59.160]  That's like they say in Full Metal Jacket, Colonel Kurtz is saying, we drop napalm on
[12:59.160 --> 13:03.760]  villages of children, but the generals get mad if we, if the men write cuss words on
[13:03.760 --> 13:17.640]  the sides of their airplanes, exactly, that's exactly, it's sick.
[13:17.640 --> 13:18.640]  It's sick.
[13:18.640 --> 13:22.520]  So let me tell you the territory we're in.
[13:22.520 --> 13:27.720]  I've looked at every outcome in my mind of this and again, when you get this knowledge,
[13:27.720 --> 13:29.560]  you just know what they're going to do.
[13:29.560 --> 13:30.560]  You know the play.
[13:30.560 --> 13:34.760]  Like I said yesterday, maybe ask Drew or somebody to get the first hour of the show.
[13:34.760 --> 13:42.120]  Look through it on high speed and find where I said like five times, Fox News will announce
[13:42.120 --> 13:47.640]  key states first to give their deception credibility.
[13:47.640 --> 13:55.800]  And I said like Michigan or Arizona or Pennsylvania and damn it, they did it in two of those states
[13:55.800 --> 14:02.360]  in Nevada and they did it in, no, not, it was in Arizona and it was in Michigan.
[14:02.360 --> 14:05.400]  I mean just right on time, man, right on time.
[14:05.400 --> 14:09.480]  So let me tell you what's going to happen next.
[14:09.480 --> 14:11.960]  The Supreme Court will probably extend the deadlines more.
[14:11.960 --> 14:16.240]  One state's got nine days, one's got three days, they'll, they've got all those 80 million
[14:16.240 --> 14:20.680]  ballots, huge stores of them in warehouses, in Democrat party officials' houses, and
[14:20.680 --> 14:21.680]  the cars are pulling up.
[14:21.680 --> 14:22.680]  It's all over the news.
[14:22.680 --> 14:23.680]  Oh, what's that car?
[14:23.680 --> 14:27.880]  Let's get back, oh, we just got, well, where'd that come from?
[14:27.880 --> 14:32.720]  You'll see.
[14:32.720 --> 14:36.760]  Because they don't respect this, my God, I mean they've gotten away with anything they
[14:36.760 --> 14:39.920]  want to do.
[14:39.920 --> 14:43.200]  And then the president comes out and gives an exact statement last night.
[14:43.200 --> 14:50.400]  I was so tired, I was cross-eyed at 3 AM when I got home and I'm 46, 47.
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.080]  I'm 74, he's up at 4 in the morning giving a best, slickest speech I've ever seen him
[14:55.080 --> 14:56.280]  give.
[14:56.280 --> 15:02.800]  And everything he said was true, dead on, not exaggerated.
[15:02.800 --> 15:06.280]  And the media's like, he's a dictator, look, exactly what he said what they do.
[15:06.280 --> 15:12.360]  He is outrageous, he's saying he's got, you know, he's five points ahead in this state,
[15:12.360 --> 15:16.360]  seven points ahead here and two points ahead there and there's no way you should, and they're
[15:16.360 --> 15:21.800]  like, well, we are gonna have to have 75% of the ballots in Pennsylvania coming in
[15:21.800 --> 15:26.000]  from the Democrat and just magically there's 76% right now.
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.920]  It's just perfect, it's just right what they need when Trump's like, investigate that.
[15:31.920 --> 15:35.440]  This whole thing's illegal, the whole damn thing's fraudulent and you're like, oh, the
[15:35.440 --> 15:40.240]  Supreme Court, I bet Amy Comey Barrett pulls a dagger out and stabs Trump right in the
[15:40.240 --> 15:44.720]  neck or one up, you know, Roberts or somebody because you saw the Supreme Court's allowing
[15:44.720 --> 15:49.560]  all these extensions, oh, the mythical conservative Supreme Court.
[15:49.560 --> 15:52.880]  They're all a bunch of coward lawyers, that's why they were brought in by the globalists
[15:52.880 --> 15:56.320]  because the cowards are not Americans.
[15:56.320 --> 16:01.240]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your
[16:01.240 --> 16:03.160]  GPS location.
[16:03.160 --> 16:08.760]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[16:08.760 --> 16:13.800]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on
[16:13.800 --> 16:18.960]  Droids, don't just track your location but your surfing history, where you go, who you
[16:18.960 --> 16:24.240]  talk to, your relationships and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing
[16:24.240 --> 16:29.920]  on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just
[16:29.920 --> 16:36.040]  like Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those
[16:36.040 --> 16:38.120]  systems to be saved forever.
[16:38.120 --> 16:42.320]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based
[16:42.320 --> 16:43.400]  on information.
[16:43.400 --> 16:46.600]  This is the global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[16:46.600 --> 16:52.440]  Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy
[16:52.440 --> 16:56.720]  tracks, infowarstore.com.
[16:56.720 --> 16:57.720]  Look it up for yourself.
[16:57.720 --> 17:02.800]  The head of the Davos Group issued a report more than six months ago calling for world
[17:02.800 --> 17:08.400]  government to be openly established to respond to COVID-19 and the COVID-19 was a blessing
[17:08.400 --> 17:11.720]  to lower the planet's carbon footprint.
[17:11.720 --> 17:17.360]  Since then, Prince Charles and countless others have come out and said the exact same thing.
[17:17.360 --> 17:24.240]  The most ancient form of total war is called siege and that's when you cut people off from
[17:24.240 --> 17:25.240]  their resources.
[17:25.240 --> 17:30.240]  That's when you lock them down and this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalist
[17:30.240 --> 17:31.440]  or just get rid of Donald Trump.
[17:31.440 --> 17:32.440]  That's only part of it.
[17:32.440 --> 17:36.640]  This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt.
[17:36.640 --> 17:42.440]  So then, the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social
[17:42.440 --> 17:44.560]  credit score surveillance grid.
[17:44.560 --> 17:48.480]  You've heard the U.S. Army saying our job is to kill people and break things.
[17:48.480 --> 17:50.400]  Well, that's what the lockdown's doing.
[17:50.400 --> 17:52.840]  It's starving the third world, millions and millions of death.
[17:52.840 --> 17:55.080]  It's breaking down the supply chain in society.
[17:55.080 --> 18:21.080]  That's their mission.
[18:21.080 --> 18:47.080]  It's breaking down the supply chain in society, millions and millions of death.
[18:47.080 --> 18:58.320]  I'm here to tell you something.
[18:58.320 --> 19:05.840]  Info wars, that means you put Trump in office and Trump is only one man.
[19:05.840 --> 19:11.600]  Right now, this country is on a razor's edge and you're going to see as I predicted and
[19:11.600 --> 19:18.520]  as Robert Barnes predicted, betrayals by the Supreme Court against President Trump.
[19:18.520 --> 19:20.000]  Because he is trying to restore the Republic.
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.280]  He is trying to get us out of under Chai Khan control.
[19:22.280 --> 19:24.360]  He is trying to do all of that.
[19:24.360 --> 19:30.360]  But the establishment is arrogant and used to getting what they want.
[19:30.360 --> 19:33.240]  I mean, let me explain the psychology of this.
[19:33.240 --> 19:35.200]  I'll get to the latest numbers and tell you who's coming up.
[19:35.200 --> 19:37.280]  We've got a big list of guests today.
[19:37.280 --> 19:39.640]  The crews are doing an incredible job.
[19:39.640 --> 19:42.280]  The audience has done an incredible job spreading the word.
[19:42.280 --> 19:43.280]  I salute you all.
[19:43.280 --> 19:46.680]  It was an article in New York Times 10 or 11 years ago.
[19:46.680 --> 19:47.880]  I made a big deal about it at the time.
[19:47.880 --> 19:48.880]  I forget the exact headline.
[19:48.880 --> 19:57.360]  I think the headline was United Nations clash with tribes, African Congo tribes.
[19:57.360 --> 20:04.920]  It was one of those countries, Congonese tribes over carbon set aside sinks.
[20:04.920 --> 20:05.920]  That was what the article was about.
[20:05.920 --> 20:10.040]  I'm just reading this article, and I already knew all this stuff, that the UN goes in and
[20:10.040 --> 20:11.960]  just murders whole villages.
[20:11.960 --> 20:18.800]  They killed a million Rwandan Christians to take their land and use the animus-based
[20:18.800 --> 20:20.800]  devil worshipers to take over to do it.
[20:20.800 --> 20:21.800]  The Clintons ran that.
[20:21.800 --> 20:24.960]  The UN didn't just let one tribe in to kill the others.
[20:24.960 --> 20:29.800]  They set up machine guns and killed those that tried to get out for six months straight.
[20:29.800 --> 20:31.560]  That was Rwanda.
[20:31.560 --> 20:39.760]  But in Central Africa, it was describing these villagers, some of them pygmies, that had
[20:39.760 --> 20:40.760]  been there forever.
[20:40.760 --> 20:42.760]  It's their land, but they didn't have a deed to it.
[20:42.760 --> 20:44.760]  It's everything, oh, we took it from the Native Americans.
[20:44.760 --> 20:47.400]  All the stuff we hear about how bad we are back then.
[20:47.400 --> 20:55.640]  But the UN, it said, just went in and just slaughtered everyone with army tanks and helicopters.
[20:55.640 --> 20:57.440]  I'm reading this in the New York Times.
[20:57.440 --> 20:58.440]  They're not even hiding it.
[20:58.440 --> 21:02.480]  It's like, yeah, there's three million Uyghurs in death camps, and yeah, there's a million
[21:02.480 --> 21:08.000]  Christians in Buddhist-estimated and Chinese camps, and yeah, Apple gets its main supply
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.680]  parts made by the Uyghurs, and they take the Uyghurs' organs, and you can pull that out.
[21:12.680 --> 21:16.760]  It's just like, but America's bad.
[21:16.760 --> 21:22.520]  And it's just like, what, what?
[21:22.520 --> 21:28.440]  And then I see hundreds of articles every few days about Muslims just randomly killing
[21:28.440 --> 21:34.640]  Europeans, and little kids, women, just, I mean, every day, a woman is pushed in front
[21:34.640 --> 21:37.760]  of a subway train in Europe and killed.
[21:37.760 --> 21:42.040]  Every day, I just see, you know, it's a Muslim that killed them, and if you say, oh, that
[21:42.040 --> 21:46.320]  Muslim killed her and screamed Allah Akbar, it's always a hot woman, too.
[21:46.320 --> 21:50.800]  I think it really upset us hot, use some hot blonde, you know, old, sexy train guy, you
[21:50.800 --> 21:54.520]  know, it's just like, that's his dominance, kick him down the stairs, whatever.
[21:54.520 --> 22:00.280]  And if you talk about it, the police come and arrest you in Germany, in Sweden.
[22:00.280 --> 22:05.960]  I mean, that's it, cops come to your house because you put a Facebook article out about
[22:05.960 --> 22:08.520]  a woman being murdered and you get, you go to jail.
[22:08.520 --> 22:12.400]  This is just ridiculous.
[22:12.400 --> 22:16.800]  We're not approaching tyranny, we are in it, and everything that's been done in Europe
[22:16.800 --> 22:19.960]  is about five years ahead of us, and that's all coming here now.
[22:19.960 --> 22:24.560]  And with COVID, it's six months ahead of us.
[22:24.560 --> 22:26.040]  So I'm going to explain something again.
[22:26.040 --> 22:30.360]  I don't predict any of this.
[22:30.360 --> 22:35.960]  I understand the criminology and the psychology and the modus operandi of these people.
[22:35.960 --> 22:36.960]  Again, how did I know?
[22:36.960 --> 22:39.120]  In fact, did you guys get the clip?
[22:39.120 --> 22:46.360]  Fox News is all over, Fox in trouble for declaring Arizona when it was not done and when clearly
[22:46.360 --> 22:48.040]  the numbers were going towards Trump.
[22:48.040 --> 22:51.560]  Now, again, what did I say yesterday?
[22:51.560 --> 22:57.480]  I said, I looked for Fox News to declare key battleground states early first for Biden.
[22:57.480 --> 23:01.720]  And of course, they did it, not just there, but in one other state as well.
[23:01.720 --> 23:06.680]  This is what these scumbags do, you know, there it is on screen.
[23:06.680 --> 23:07.960]  This is how they operate.
[23:07.960 --> 23:11.880]  Now, why did I say it'd be Fox?
[23:11.880 --> 23:15.080]  Because then it's not seen as bias.
[23:15.080 --> 23:20.120]  And they get together and have wargamed all this and got seven media groups together that
[23:20.120 --> 23:24.920]  have interlocking directorates and ownership, and they've wargamed out the whole thing.
[23:24.920 --> 23:27.560]  Pull up dredgerport.com.
[23:27.560 --> 23:31.960]  It's frozen up there with the delegate count for Biden and the delegate count for Trump.
[23:31.960 --> 23:36.400]  They froze it at a point when Trump was about to surpass Biden and win just like four years
[23:36.400 --> 23:37.400]  ago.
[23:37.400 --> 23:47.040]  He froze it at 238 Biden, 213 Trump for that emblematic image of 50.12, 48.26 so that you
[23:47.040 --> 23:52.240]  look at that and it says Biden is the winner, then it becomes self-fulfilling prophecy when
[23:52.240 --> 23:54.960]  all the fake ballots they've got warehoused flood in.
[23:54.960 --> 23:57.840]  It's two plus two equals four.
[23:57.840 --> 24:01.560]  And the ability to be free is to be able to say two plus two equals four.
[24:01.560 --> 24:03.400]  That is such an incredible statement.
[24:03.400 --> 24:05.240]  I think that's an overly simplistic statement.
[24:05.240 --> 24:09.080]  The first time I read 1984, I laughed at it when I was like 12 years old.
[24:09.080 --> 24:13.440]  It's not funny now because they actually teach in European and U.S. schools that two plus
[24:13.440 --> 24:16.400]  two could equal whatever you want.
[24:16.400 --> 24:19.280]  And this is a war on logic.
[24:19.280 --> 24:22.280]  It's like all of the COVID testing they admit is totally fake.
[24:22.280 --> 24:23.280]  All the numbers are fake.
[24:23.280 --> 24:24.280]  They just don't care.
[24:24.280 --> 24:32.480]  It's the victory of fraud over reality.
[24:32.480 --> 24:35.920]  And so last night we were flipping through all the channels, CBS, Fox, CNN.
[24:35.920 --> 24:40.840]  It was all just wild different numbers on purpose just to totally spin you around, spin
[24:40.840 --> 24:42.240]  you around, spin you around.
[24:42.240 --> 24:43.240]  You're all dizzy.
[24:43.240 --> 24:44.240]  You don't know where you are.
[24:44.240 --> 24:45.240]  We know where you are.
[24:45.240 --> 24:46.880]  They put us in a fake COVID lockdown.
[24:46.880 --> 24:48.680]  They sent out 80 million fake ballots.
[24:48.680 --> 24:49.680]  They war game.
[24:49.680 --> 24:51.200]  The Democrats said we will not contest.
[24:51.200 --> 24:54.840]  It'll look like a red wave.
[24:54.840 --> 24:56.240]  It's a red mirage.
[24:56.240 --> 24:59.920]  And then we will magically have the ballots that come in because their people all voted
[24:59.920 --> 25:04.320]  two or three times the names of dead people, dead cats, and they steal it.
[25:04.320 --> 25:11.040]  And so if America puts up with this, we deserve what we get because let me tell you something.
[25:11.040 --> 25:15.480]  When they get Joe Biden in and then they select whoever they want to replace him, they're
[25:15.480 --> 25:20.000]  going to punch the stock market, start huge wars.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.120]  They're going to trigger more race rioting and they're going to gut this country because
[25:23.120 --> 25:24.960]  they don't want this country to be powerful.
[25:24.960 --> 25:30.320]  They want it to be an EU Chinese access with the United States as a third party that's
[25:30.320 --> 25:38.760]  been been made broke back, but can still be a nuclear Trump card against the Chinese held
[25:38.760 --> 25:39.760]  over their head.
[25:39.760 --> 25:44.120]  They want to loot us like Russia and drag us around in the dirt because it makes all
[25:44.120 --> 25:50.640]  these hunchback devil worshiping Rothschilds and new older people feel powerful.
[25:50.640 --> 25:51.640]  That's all it is.
[25:51.640 --> 25:55.200]  You're like, why do they want to do this because they don't like you.
[25:55.200 --> 25:56.360]  They want to hurt you.
[25:56.360 --> 25:57.360]  They enjoy it.
[25:57.360 --> 25:58.600]  They're bad people.
[25:58.600 --> 26:02.080]  Stop projecting your goodness on them and grow up.
[26:02.080 --> 26:07.420]  The Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the whole political class are psychotics.
[26:07.420 --> 26:09.840]  They're devil worshiping pedophiles.
[26:09.840 --> 26:11.340]  They rape children.
[26:11.340 --> 26:13.040]  They kill children.
[26:13.040 --> 26:14.880]  They kill countries.
[26:14.880 --> 26:19.880]  They go into African countries and inject everyone with steroids and cancer viruses.
[26:19.880 --> 26:23.880]  And now, like Bill Gates said, no reason only the Africans should be getting all this.
[26:23.880 --> 26:27.120]  He said in a speech and opened up the mosquitoes and started laughing.
[26:27.120 --> 26:32.400]  He wants to kill you just as much as he wants to kill those black people because they don't
[26:32.400 --> 26:34.360]  like strong people.
[26:34.360 --> 26:35.760]  They want to dominate you.
[26:35.760 --> 26:37.200]  They want to kill you.
[26:37.200 --> 26:38.440]  Get it through your head.
[26:38.440 --> 26:39.920]  They want to murder you.
[26:39.920 --> 26:41.320]  They want to take you over.
[26:41.320 --> 26:42.680]  They want to conquer you.
[26:42.680 --> 26:44.160]  They want to annihilate you.
[26:44.160 --> 26:45.160]  They want to destroy you.
[26:45.160 --> 26:54.520]  So stop putting up with them and start resisting now or just blow your damn brains out.
[26:54.520 --> 26:56.020]  It's all on record.
[26:56.020 --> 27:02.880]  Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago, and then again six
[27:02.880 --> 27:08.440]  months ago, to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic and
[27:08.440 --> 27:12.680]  how to get the public to take inoculations and they talk about calling people heroes
[27:12.680 --> 27:13.680]  that do it.
[27:13.680 --> 27:15.440]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[27:15.440 --> 27:17.880]  This has all been psychologically tested.
[27:17.880 --> 27:23.240]  It's all been psychologically prepared and once they get you to lock down for 15 days,
[27:23.240 --> 27:25.320]  you notice now they say it's permanent.
[27:25.320 --> 27:26.320]  That's how it works.
[27:26.320 --> 27:28.280]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[27:28.280 --> 27:32.480]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right.
[27:32.480 --> 27:33.480]  No.
[27:33.480 --> 27:37.320]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van.
[27:37.320 --> 27:42.080]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death.
[27:42.080 --> 27:43.080]  That's the allegory.
[27:43.080 --> 27:44.920]  We got to bust out of this thing now.
[27:44.920 --> 27:45.920]  We got to say no now.
[27:45.920 --> 27:50.400]  We got to make a run for it now and we still can't once he gets us in that base, but it's
[27:50.400 --> 27:54.160]  going to get a lot, lot worse, folks, so stop submitting.
[27:54.160 --> 27:58.520]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when
[27:58.520 --> 27:59.520]  it comes to the show?
[27:59.520 --> 28:04.080]  And it's the fact that info war is more than 25 years ago doing basic research with what
[28:04.080 --> 28:08.960]  the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed the hypothesis
[28:08.960 --> 28:13.600]  that communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then
[28:13.600 --> 28:16.640]  make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[28:16.640 --> 28:18.240]  Well, now China owns the debt.
[28:18.240 --> 28:21.800]  Now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals.
[28:21.800 --> 28:26.440]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[28:26.440 --> 28:31.320]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus
[28:31.320 --> 28:32.320]  on that issue.
[28:32.320 --> 28:33.320]  We did.
[28:33.320 --> 28:36.240]  And you focused on it by supporting us at info wars.
[28:36.240 --> 28:40.680]  So when you go to infowarstore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts,
[28:40.680 --> 28:44.640]  films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that
[28:44.640 --> 28:47.320]  literally helped make up the world what's really happening.
[28:47.320 --> 28:49.320]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[28:49.320 --> 29:04.840]  I want to thank you for your support.
[29:04.840 --> 29:09.300]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone.
[29:09.300 --> 29:12.680]  Simply go to band.video with your Safari browser.
[29:12.680 --> 29:15.920]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[29:15.920 --> 29:19.400]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[29:19.400 --> 29:21.520]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[29:21.520 --> 29:23.760]  I suggest band.video.
[29:23.760 --> 29:28.360]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[29:28.360 --> 29:29.360]  to stop it.
[29:29.360 --> 29:33.480]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[29:33.480 --> 29:37.720]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[29:37.720 --> 29:41.840]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below.
[29:41.840 --> 29:46.280]  On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure and share
[29:46.280 --> 30:11.560]  band.video.
[30:11.560 --> 30:25.000]  Sometimes being defeated is winning, sometimes being destroyed is God's choice to bring a
[30:25.000 --> 30:32.000]  solution.
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.840]  Others wouldn't stand for that.
[30:34.840 --> 30:39.120]  The cross was a solution.
[30:39.120 --> 30:42.120]  Thanks to the renegades.
[30:42.120 --> 30:48.240]  All right, my friends, we are back live here and we have Joe Hoft, a businessman contributor
[30:48.240 --> 30:50.960]  to his brother's great great great pundit.
[30:50.960 --> 30:55.920]  He's crunched the best numbers, so I was trying to get his brother on, he said, no, my brother
[30:55.920 --> 30:57.800]  is better when it comes to this.
[30:57.800 --> 31:01.640]  So he's been really breaking it down again with pundit.com, Patrick Halley with Epic
[31:01.640 --> 31:05.560]  Times, and also, of course, the nationalfile.com.
[31:05.560 --> 31:07.760]  He's with us as well.
[31:07.760 --> 31:11.960]  We got Roger Stone coming up, we got everybody here on the broadcasts, Chad Prather, Lee
[31:11.960 --> 31:17.680]  and Macadoo, and so many others, Bishop Larry Gators, and we're going to be live right through
[31:17.680 --> 31:20.320]  late tonight as well, right through.
[31:20.320 --> 31:23.960]  We told you it would be the 79 days of hell starting an election day.
[31:23.960 --> 31:26.800]  Now they're even calling it hell and all the rest of it.
[31:26.800 --> 31:30.440]  So we'll go over the latest numbers, but here's what you have to understand.
[31:30.440 --> 31:36.000]  We had to fight for this country to have it, and now we're having to fight for it again,
[31:36.000 --> 31:39.760]  and we have multinational forces coming in, engaging in classical fraud with all these
[31:39.760 --> 31:42.120]  male and fake ballots, and this was always their game plan.
[31:42.120 --> 31:45.720]  They always said they were going to do it, and so instead of even letting Trump have
[31:45.720 --> 31:50.760]  his red mirage, they went ahead as soon as he was about to surpass Biden, and they shut
[31:50.760 --> 31:51.760]  it all down.
[31:51.760 --> 31:56.800]  Now, that's what they've done, and the Supreme Court betrayed Trump and the Constitution
[31:56.800 --> 32:02.200]  and allowed this crap with all this COVID BS, so let's go first to gateway pundit analyst
[32:02.200 --> 32:03.200]  Joe Hoff.
[32:03.200 --> 32:11.040]  Joe, thanks for joining us, and you've got a raft of info, so lay it out for us.
[32:11.040 --> 32:12.040]  Great to be here again.
[32:12.040 --> 32:13.040]  Great to see you.
[32:13.040 --> 32:16.040]  Yeah, I've been a late night for a lot of people, I think.
[32:16.040 --> 32:22.440]  We stayed up and watched President Trump at 3.15 a.m. Eastern time come out, and he did
[32:22.440 --> 32:27.000]  a great job of presenting himself and sharing that, hey, we won this thing, and basically
[32:27.000 --> 32:28.000]  we're going to try this.
[32:28.000 --> 32:29.000]  We're not trying.
[32:29.000 --> 32:33.000]  We're going to stop this fraud, and it was very encouraging, and he was absolutely
[32:33.000 --> 32:34.000]  right.
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  All sorts of fraud.
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.800]  I'd probably put it into a couple buckets.
[32:37.800 --> 32:43.960]  One bucket is, there's three states, well, actually four, that just decided to stop counting
[32:43.960 --> 32:45.960]  last night.
[32:45.960 --> 32:52.320]  As Trump's getting ready to win, we saw North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona, and Pennsylvania
[32:52.320 --> 32:53.320]  just stop.
[32:53.320 --> 32:57.760]  They decided we're going to stop counting, which is just unreal.
[32:57.760 --> 32:58.760]  What's going on here?
[32:58.760 --> 33:05.080]  This is America, count until you're done, and still today at this point.
[33:05.080 --> 33:07.080]  That's the big tell, Joe, as you said.
[33:07.080 --> 33:08.800]  They didn't just say, oh, we'll keep counting.
[33:08.800 --> 33:12.640]  They've now got to decide what to do, get together, and then get their voter rolls of
[33:12.640 --> 33:17.960]  who hasn't voted to then falsely fill out those extra ballots and have the big steal.
[33:17.960 --> 33:18.960]  It's on.
[33:18.960 --> 33:19.960]  Well, absolutely.
[33:19.960 --> 33:23.880]  And then the other thing that they did, and Trump said this at a 3.00 a.m. talk, and said,
[33:23.880 --> 33:29.800]  hey, we don't want 4.00 a.m. voter dumps, ballot dumps, and sure enough, in Michigan
[33:29.800 --> 33:35.000]  and Wisconsin, in each state, there was over 100,000 votes that got dumped.
[33:35.000 --> 33:39.320]  In Wisconsin, more than 100,000, Michigan, more than around 200,000.
[33:39.320 --> 33:43.440]  You can see it in some charts we put up on a couple posts this morning.
[33:43.440 --> 33:45.440]  So clearly, that was a dump.
[33:45.440 --> 33:50.120]  We've actually talked to somebody in Michigan who said they know, some people say there's
[33:50.120 --> 33:55.480]  three cars pulled up to one of the ballot stations and dropped off a bunch of ballots.
[33:55.480 --> 33:59.160]  One of the cars was a real expensive, I think it was a Lamborghini or something.
[33:59.160 --> 34:01.360]  And they didn't take any pictures.
[34:01.360 --> 34:03.320]  But there was like 200,000 ballots.
[34:03.320 --> 34:06.760]  Just all of a sudden, 200,000 for Biden, none for Trump.
[34:06.760 --> 34:09.480]  And so now both of these states are real close.
[34:09.480 --> 34:15.400]  By the way, there are a lot of photos in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania and in other areas and in
[34:15.400 --> 34:20.840]  Nevada of people pulling up and taking in and out boxes unauthorized, I mean, you've
[34:20.840 --> 34:22.600]  got that a gateway pun too.
[34:22.600 --> 34:23.600]  Yeah, that's right.
[34:23.600 --> 34:28.300]  And with Wisconsin, we also see that they now have like an 88% voter turnout with still
[34:28.300 --> 34:29.800]  some votes to count.
[34:29.800 --> 34:31.600]  So that's almost statistically impossible.
[34:31.600 --> 34:33.680]  What have we ever seen that in the U.S.?
[34:33.680 --> 34:35.960]  It's usually around, what, 50% or so?
[34:35.960 --> 34:40.840]  So Wisconsin, clearly there's something going on there, along with there are 100,000 ballots
[34:40.840 --> 34:43.160]  that got dumped in the middle of the night.
[34:43.160 --> 34:47.560]  So the question is today right now, why isn't North Carolina and Georgia finishing their
[34:47.560 --> 34:49.840]  job and reporting Trump as president?
[34:49.840 --> 34:52.440]  And why isn't, or as winning these states?
[34:52.440 --> 34:58.240]  And here's why, Alex, Nevada is saying, we're just magically going to stop counting until
[34:58.240 --> 34:59.240]  tomorrow too.
[34:59.240 --> 35:00.240]  What the hell?
[35:00.240 --> 35:01.240]  What does that signify?
[35:01.240 --> 35:02.240]  What does that signify?
[35:02.240 --> 35:05.080]  Well, it's fraud, right?
[35:05.080 --> 35:12.240]  And it also, there's been a pattern here and an effort to continue to show Joe Biden
[35:12.240 --> 35:13.360]  as the winner.
[35:13.360 --> 35:18.640]  All last night, they could have called Florida and Texas for hours, and they refused to,
[35:18.640 --> 35:21.200]  so that they could say Biden was in the lead.
[35:21.200 --> 35:28.360]  And finally, once Biden picked up California, then they said, oh, Florida, yeah, that's
[35:28.360 --> 35:29.720]  for Trump and Texas later.
[35:29.720 --> 35:33.320]  And that's when they froze us to have him ahead to make it look legitimate.
[35:33.320 --> 35:34.320]  Yeah.
[35:34.320 --> 35:38.240]  And so Texas, Trump won by 6%, Florida by 3.5%.
[35:38.240 --> 35:39.840]  These weren't even close.
[35:39.840 --> 35:42.720]  And so that's their tactics.
[35:42.720 --> 35:45.200]  They're trying to make it look like Biden's ahead.
[35:45.200 --> 35:46.200]  That's BS.
[35:46.200 --> 35:49.440]  And they're saying in Pennsylvania, they got to get 75% to override Trump.
[35:49.440 --> 35:52.520]  That is ridiculously obvious a steal if they do that.
[35:52.520 --> 35:53.520]  So here's where we're at.
[35:53.520 --> 35:55.800]  We got three states, and I'll just kind of summarize this.
[35:55.800 --> 36:00.120]  Three states, Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, that it looks like there's really
[36:00.120 --> 36:02.640]  no way that the Democrats can win.
[36:02.640 --> 36:08.600]  And so the remaining states then would be Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
[36:08.600 --> 36:15.520]  If Trump wins Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, he only needs one of those four
[36:15.520 --> 36:17.440]  states to win.
[36:17.440 --> 36:22.400]  So whether it be Arizona, and we just heard something from the Republicans in Arizona
[36:22.400 --> 36:26.360]  saying, we believe that we've won by 30,000 votes.
[36:26.360 --> 36:30.240]  The votes that aren't counted are all these Republican votes that came in yesterday.
[36:30.240 --> 36:31.240]  They weren't male.
[36:31.240 --> 36:32.960]  All the male and votes are counted.
[36:32.960 --> 36:35.000]  So Arizona's looking good.
[36:35.000 --> 36:41.600]  If Trump can pull that out and then make sure Pennsylvania doesn't get stole, he wins.
[36:41.600 --> 36:43.720]  So there's some real possibilities.
[36:43.720 --> 36:46.120]  Trump's in the lead, but the media won't report that.
[36:46.120 --> 36:47.120]  Let's be clear.
[36:47.120 --> 36:48.120]  We're not the mainstream media.
[36:48.120 --> 36:50.320]  If he wasn't the lead, we'd tell you clearly there's been fraud.
[36:50.320 --> 36:52.440]  It would mean their fraud had been successful.
[36:52.440 --> 36:56.560]  You can see that all the real metrics show he won in a landslide.
[36:56.560 --> 37:00.560]  Despite all the fraud, he still made it over the top.
[37:00.560 --> 37:05.840]  I mean, other areas of fraud here, Joe Hoffman, this is insane.
[37:05.840 --> 37:11.440]  Well, that's probably, I could pause there and let our colleagues share some.
[37:11.440 --> 37:15.880]  But I think that's kind of it, really, if I were to summarize it at a high level.
[37:15.880 --> 37:19.400]  There's a couple states they need to call Georgia and North Carolina.
[37:19.400 --> 37:20.400]  Here it is.
[37:20.400 --> 37:22.040]  It's almost one o'clock Eastern time.
[37:22.040 --> 37:24.040]  They haven't changed for like 12 hours.
[37:24.040 --> 37:25.040]  All right.
[37:25.040 --> 37:26.040]  Stay there.
[37:26.040 --> 37:27.040]  Stay there.
[37:27.040 --> 37:29.920]  We're going to come back and ask you, because you're highly respected as an analyst.
[37:29.920 --> 37:34.040]  What you think, Trump, and what we need to do right now, but I call the fraud out and
[37:34.040 --> 37:38.640]  say, damn it, you know, you need, you got time to count your manufacturing stuff.
[37:38.640 --> 37:39.840]  This is so insanely obvious.
[37:39.840 --> 37:43.560]  They want to have time to manufacture so they don't get caught.
[37:43.560 --> 37:44.560]  This is a moment of truth.
[37:44.560 --> 37:48.120]  Talk about a nail biter, Patrick Howley of nationalfile.com.
[37:48.120 --> 37:51.080]  What do you think needs to happen and what is your eye focused on right now?
[37:51.080 --> 37:55.880]  Well, it's great to be with you, Alex, and also Joe, who I have great respect for for
[37:55.880 --> 37:57.480]  a number of years.
[37:57.480 --> 38:01.880]  And I have heard from Bill Stepien that Bill Stepien is very confident that he's going
[38:01.880 --> 38:05.440]  to win Pennsylvania by 40,000 votes for the Trump campaign.
[38:05.440 --> 38:08.560]  Now look, we can't be defensive on all this stuff.
[38:08.560 --> 38:11.360]  Now you go through a state by state.
[38:11.360 --> 38:16.040]  The states that are on the bubble here are the states that I've been focusing on, which
[38:16.040 --> 38:18.560]  is why I'm getting so many calls.
[38:18.560 --> 38:20.080]  North Carolina looks good.
[38:20.080 --> 38:24.920]  It looks like Tillis has already claimed victory over Cunningham, cheating Cal.
[38:24.920 --> 38:27.800]  So Mitch McConnell owes me for that one.
[38:27.800 --> 38:35.320]  You have, as of this morning, a sizable margin in North Carolina, so I think Trump's going
[38:35.320 --> 38:36.320]  to hold North Carolina.
[38:36.320 --> 38:42.040]  In Michigan, you are seeing exactly what I knew was coming in Michigan in Gretchen Whitmer
[38:42.040 --> 38:43.040]  State.
[38:43.040 --> 38:48.280]  You started with Trump being up about 26,000 votes, and then all of a sudden you see these
[38:48.280 --> 38:49.680]  votes coming in from Detroit.
[38:49.680 --> 38:53.360]  They're now claiming that Joe is up by 31,000 or so.
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.240]  They say there's 400,000 million ballots that are still being counted that, of course, are
[38:57.240 --> 38:58.240]  coming from Detroit.
[38:58.240 --> 39:03.040]  I believe that Joe is right in Arizona, and we are looking very good.
[39:03.040 --> 39:06.880]  Fox News did a terrible job by calling that too early.
[39:06.880 --> 39:13.120]  I think that there is a situation where a lot of the votes there were actually disqualified
[39:13.120 --> 39:17.120]  by virtue of the fact that they had people filling them out with Sharpie markers instead
[39:17.120 --> 39:18.520]  of ballpoint pens.
[39:18.520 --> 39:21.480]  They're only counting the ballpoint pen ballots I have heard.
[39:21.480 --> 39:25.760]  There's a video on my Twitter where I showed this, and they had people, they had even the
[39:25.760 --> 39:30.600]  sheriff enforcing, oh, you have to do it with a Sharpie in Republican areas.
[39:30.600 --> 39:34.280]  So this is massive, and you want to talk about Pennsylvania, because this is where it's all
[39:34.280 --> 39:35.280]  going to come down to.
[39:35.280 --> 39:36.280]  Let's stay there.
[39:36.280 --> 39:37.880]  Let's talk about that, and getting back to the pens, we'll show that video when we come
[39:37.880 --> 39:38.880]  back.
[39:38.880 --> 39:40.800]  They're using it to overwrite the other vote.
[39:40.800 --> 39:43.000]  These people are out of control.
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.400]  They just say that they never get in trouble, so they're like bad children.
[39:46.400 --> 39:47.880]  We've got Joe Hoff, Gateway Pundit.
[39:47.880 --> 39:50.960]  We've got Patrick Alley, National Followdown Show for them for wars.
[39:50.960 --> 39:51.960]  We'll be right back.
[39:51.960 --> 39:52.960]  Stay with us.
[39:52.960 --> 39:56.560]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[39:56.560 --> 40:00.880]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[40:00.880 --> 40:05.600]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[40:05.600 --> 40:09.720]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[40:09.720 --> 40:14.880]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[40:14.880 --> 40:20.640]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[40:20.640 --> 40:26.600]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[40:26.600 --> 40:33.240]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[40:33.240 --> 40:37.840]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[40:37.840 --> 40:43.640]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[40:43.640 --> 40:46.440]  facts that pertain to reality.
[40:46.440 --> 40:52.760]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[40:52.760 --> 40:58.720]  Infowars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government corruption
[40:58.720 --> 41:00.720]  for over two decades.
[41:00.720 --> 41:08.120]  It is why they attack us, and it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.
[41:08.120 --> 41:13.040]  The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[41:13.040 --> 41:18.280]  Evil has infested governments everywhere, but the evil establishment is censoring content
[41:18.280 --> 41:20.920]  across all media platforms.
[41:20.920 --> 41:25.000]  They blocked you from sharing banned.video on social media.
[41:25.000 --> 41:32.520]  So go to electionnight.news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[41:32.520 --> 41:39.840]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and big
[41:39.840 --> 41:40.840]  pharma.
[41:40.840 --> 41:48.240]  Go to electionnight.news to find all the information the crooked establishment is most afraid of.
[41:48.240 --> 42:18.200]  Go to electionnight.news and share now.
[42:19.240 --> 42:39.760]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and big
[42:39.760 --> 42:40.760]  pharma.
[42:40.760 --> 42:45.760]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and big pharma.
[42:45.760 --> 42:55.780]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about near the end of the road.
[42:55.780 --> 43:03.560]  Go to electionnight.news to find all the information the crooked establishment is most afraid of
[43:03.560 --> 43:15.400]  COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and big pharma.
[43:15.400 --> 43:18.180]  And then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[43:18.180 --> 43:20.780]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[43:20.780 --> 43:22.420]  The two formulas are different,
[43:22.420 --> 43:24.020]  but both are concentrates.
[43:24.020 --> 43:25.860]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[43:25.860 --> 43:27.940]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[43:27.940 --> 43:30.100]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[43:30.100 --> 43:31.500]  Some like bodies better.
[43:31.500 --> 43:33.260]  For me, they're both amazing
[43:33.260 --> 43:35.620]  for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[43:35.620 --> 43:36.820]  And they fund the M4.

[43:56.780 --> 43:59.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[43:59.820 --> 44:14.900]  On.
[44:14.900 --> 44:20.540]  79days.news is the new website to get around the censors
[44:20.540 --> 44:21.900]  that takes you to man.video.
[44:21.900 --> 44:24.060]  The 79 Days of Hell is here.
[44:24.060 --> 44:25.540]  79days.news.
[44:25.540 --> 44:26.500]  Am I in a day?
[44:26.500 --> 44:27.340]  Am I in in a week?
[44:27.340 --> 44:28.140]  Am I in in a month?
[44:28.140 --> 44:29.500]  The Democrats, they're internal battle plans
[44:29.500 --> 44:33.260]  on public. John Podesta and others said they're going to push to the January 20th. They can't
[44:33.260 --> 44:37.420]  get a clear victory and break the country up. Why shouldn't they? They won't get in trouble.
[44:37.420 --> 44:43.100]  Succession. Here's what President Trump had to say about it. At 4 a.m. in the morning,
[44:43.100 --> 44:48.380]  Titan-like energy. I was totally exhausted. Went to bed at 3. Trump's up there looking like he was,
[44:48.380 --> 44:53.180]  you know, at high noon. I mean, this is who we need. God's giving us such a choice. This guy
[44:53.180 --> 45:00.060]  versus this chai-com agent. Here's President Trump. North Carolina. Big victory with North Carolina.
[45:02.860 --> 45:11.180]  So we won there. We lead by 76,000 votes with almost nothing left. And all of a sudden everything
[45:11.180 --> 45:19.660]  just stopped. This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country.
[45:19.660 --> 45:26.700]  We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.
[45:32.380 --> 45:39.420]  So our goal now is to ensure the integrity for the good of this nation. This is a very big moment.
[45:40.300 --> 45:47.180]  This is a major fraud in our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner.
[45:47.180 --> 45:56.540]  So we'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don't want them to
[45:56.540 --> 46:07.500]  find any ballots at 4 o'clock in the morning and add them to the list. It's a very sad moment.
[46:07.500 --> 46:13.740]  To me, this is a very sad moment. And we will win this. And as far as I'm concerned, we already
[46:13.740 --> 46:21.420]  have. Joe Hoft, what can we do? What can the president do? What is the path to legitimate
[46:21.420 --> 46:25.900]  victory? This has all been a giant fraud. Trump's absolutely right. We're not rooting for our guy.
[46:25.900 --> 46:31.820]  He clearly is the winner. This is so vital. If they get Biden in, they're going to declare war on
[46:31.820 --> 46:37.740]  America even more. His taxes, his regulations will kill us. I mean, this is like a suicide pack.
[46:37.740 --> 46:44.380]  What do we do? The sense of urgency in my life has never been anywhere near this.
[46:44.380 --> 46:52.060]  That's a great question, Alex. As you know, I was an auditor, an executive auditor, vice president
[46:52.060 --> 46:56.220]  in Hong Kong, where I ran a team of auditors. I've been to audit committees around the world,
[46:57.180 --> 47:01.180]  presented at audit committees, et cetera, board meetings, et cetera. So you know fraud when you
[47:01.180 --> 47:06.620]  see it? I think, y'all, this is fraud. This is definitely fraud. I think the two clear indications
[47:06.620 --> 47:12.620]  of fraud were last night. Just like we said earlier, at 4 a.m., Michigan and Wisconsin both dumped a
[47:12.620 --> 47:18.860]  massive 300,000 total ballots, all for Biden, none for Trump. That needs to be investigated.
[47:19.660 --> 47:25.420]  For sure. I hope Trump has massive teams on site. Oh, there should be 100 lawyers at that one place
[47:25.420 --> 47:30.300]  in Michigan where that got dumped. Well, you know, lawyers are great, but we need some people that
[47:30.300 --> 47:34.460]  understand the numbers and the data and how to audit this stuff. So I hope he's got the right
[47:34.460 --> 47:38.940]  professionals there and investigators to look at this, to check signatures. Yeah, people like
[47:38.940 --> 47:42.540]  Bev Harris. So who do we need you? Who should Trump send? He's got to do it now.
[47:43.420 --> 47:47.740]  Yes, right now, absolutely. So he needs to lock. The first thing he needs to do is absolutely lock
[47:47.740 --> 47:55.260]  everything down right now. Stop any more attempts or ability to commit fraud. You've got to cover
[47:55.820 --> 47:59.420]  what you've got and make sure nobody knows that. That's what Roger Stone said my month ago. He said,
[47:59.420 --> 48:04.220]  Trump's going to win, but they're going to steal it and do data ballot dumping. He said federal
[48:04.220 --> 48:07.980]  marshals in places like Nevada where frauds are already going on, they've got to go in and seize
[48:07.980 --> 48:12.460]  them. People go, that's political. Well, if it's fraud, you've got to prosecute the damn law.
[48:13.020 --> 48:17.020]  Yeah, that's right. And the thing that people can do, and I recommended this a month ago or so on
[48:17.020 --> 48:22.380]  Gateway Pundit, is if you're working at these various places, bring your iPhone. And Breitbart
[48:22.380 --> 48:27.100]  taught us all that, you know, anybody can be a reporter today with their iPhone. And that's what
[48:27.100 --> 48:32.060]  people need to do is if they see something fraudulent to take, to just take a picture of that. Say that
[48:32.060 --> 48:36.940]  again, Joe. It's us. It's up to people in those battleground areas. It's up to everybody who's
[48:36.940 --> 48:43.180]  been a poll watcher to get involved. Alex, and people can still do that. There's still room for
[48:43.180 --> 48:48.380]  fraud. So what people need to do if they're concerned is get together. I know of a group in
[48:48.380 --> 48:55.180]  Michigan of women that went out to these ballot boxes that were suddenly set up around these
[48:55.180 --> 49:01.580]  states and had people sitting there guarding them on and they've set up timetables, etc.
[49:01.580 --> 49:05.820]  So that these places were guarded so nobody could mess with them because this whole this whole
[49:05.820 --> 49:12.620]  process of these ballot boxes and drop off points, total, total fraud. That's what happened in
[49:12.620 --> 49:18.700]  California a few years ago. They just it's just it's not controlled in the post office. At least
[49:18.700 --> 49:23.580]  things are postmarked with these things. Nothing was postmarked. It's dropped in. You don't know
[49:23.580 --> 49:28.620]  who's dropped them in David David Knight's family members. I tried to get him on the show. He was
[49:28.620 --> 49:33.660]  too exhausted. I got to get it. He was he talked to his brother, his brother-in-law, and they went
[49:33.660 --> 49:38.140]  into vote in Virginia to register and they're just like we need to register here. Just just vote. I
[49:38.140 --> 49:42.940]  mean, it's crazy what's going on. Yeah, you're right. So there's the there's the thing that
[49:42.940 --> 49:48.860]  individuals can do right now. Volunteer still. I'm sure the Trump team needs help and and then
[49:48.860 --> 49:53.580]  you know be your be your own private eye. Work with some others and then make sure that you still
[49:53.580 --> 49:59.100]  guard these places where the ballots can be still manipulated. Alright, I'm gonna ask you one more
[49:59.100 --> 50:02.940]  question in a moment. We really appreciate you from Gateway Punnett. Patrick Howley again with
[50:02.940 --> 50:08.300]  National File Front and Center. You're sounding confident. I always go with my gut and then I
[50:08.300 --> 50:12.300]  analyze the material. I have a really bad feeling and not that we're gonna lose but that we better
[50:12.300 --> 50:16.300]  do a lot of we're gonna lose. I think it's I think we could still win but there's so much fraud here.
[50:16.300 --> 50:22.220]  Why are you confident? Well, look, I'm confident for a number of reasons and I know that there's
[50:22.220 --> 50:26.860]  a nightmare playing out. However, I'm confident for a number of reasons because I know that if it's
[50:26.860 --> 50:31.340]  comes down to the merits, we're gonna win every single one of these states. Now let's just go
[50:31.340 --> 50:37.580]  through it very quickly if I could in Georgia. We are still up. Okay, we're still up by over 100,000
[50:37.580 --> 50:43.660]  votes. They were so panic that when they were counting at State Farm Arena, they had to have
[50:43.660 --> 50:49.580]  a burst water pipe, a burst water main and we said, Oh, so did the ballots get wet? No, the
[50:49.580 --> 50:54.380]  ballots didn't get wet. Well, what happened? Oh, the it was kind of wet in the auditorium. So we
[50:54.380 --> 50:59.580]  had to delay it by four hours. Now we need until Friday to count the votes. The mainstream media
[50:59.580 --> 51:03.500]  doesn't vet it. And so it just goes on. Oh, yeah, they need until Friday. They think they can do
[51:03.500 --> 51:08.140]  whatever they want. But we're calling it out. Fulton County, of course, is the fraud county
[51:08.140 --> 51:13.260]  in Georgia. That's where Stacey Abrams tried to steal the thing last time in 2018. So Brian Kemp
[51:13.260 --> 51:19.100]  is onto this and he is plugged in. I'm not too worried about Georgia. I have a good feeling
[51:19.100 --> 51:23.260]  about Georgia. I have a great feeling about North Carolina. Now when it comes down to Pennsylvania,
[51:23.260 --> 51:28.700]  this is the real war and this is my area of expertise. Now when the morning began, Trump was
[51:28.700 --> 51:35.340]  up by over 618,000 votes since the day has gone on that lead has been cut to just over 500,000
[51:35.340 --> 51:39.500]  because they're chipping away. You see them in Philadelphia, you know, going through the envelopes
[51:39.500 --> 51:47.500]  as quickly as they possibly can. But if they actually get into a standoff with us in Pennsylvania,
[51:47.500 --> 51:51.500]  they don't want to get into that because they know that we've got the data. For instance,
[51:51.500 --> 51:57.580]  in Butler County, a pro Trump County where 30,000 Trump supporters presumably were denied
[51:58.220 --> 52:03.820]  mail-in ballots. And so they get provisional ballots now. And so we get 30,000 votes for
[52:03.820 --> 52:07.580]  Trump then with those provisional ballots. There's stuff like that all over the state.
[52:07.580 --> 52:11.740]  And I'm not even going to reveal right now. But if they want to get into it with me in Pennsylvania,
[52:11.740 --> 52:18.300]  bring it on. Okay. Now this is what they're doing until November 6th at 5 p.m. The Pennsylvania
[52:18.300 --> 52:23.500]  Secretary of State, the lady there just confirmed that they are going to be accepting ballots with
[52:23.500 --> 52:29.020]  no postmark on it. And the signature doesn't have to match the voter registration. This is a blank
[52:29.020 --> 52:33.420]  check for them to just stuff the ballot box with literally ballots that nobody even knows what the
[52:33.420 --> 52:39.260]  name is on it. So we need the Supreme Court to override this right now. Absolutely right. But
[52:39.260 --> 52:44.220]  if this, you know, it doesn't have to be the Supreme Court. Look, we can go in there. We can
[52:44.220 --> 52:51.260]  go in there with DOJ. William Barr sent attorneys into Fulton County, into Philadelphia, into a lot
[52:51.260 --> 52:55.900]  of these places in order to monitor. They need to do their job, but they are going to do their job.
[52:55.900 --> 53:00.940]  We are going to go into court and we're going to fight over every single ballot. But I don't think
[53:00.940 --> 53:04.620]  we're even going to need to do that because I honestly think we're going to win. And you know
[53:04.620 --> 53:11.980]  what? If we stick to our plan and we go, we go at it and Bill Stepien is convinced we're going
[53:11.980 --> 53:17.980]  to win Pennsylvania by 40,000 votes. I'm confident in Georgia. Wisconsin is going to be a battle,
[53:17.980 --> 53:23.580]  but we're going to challenge all of those Milwaukee votes. Virginia, oh, there was an error.
[53:23.580 --> 53:29.660]  Fairfax County, they had to throw out 100,000 Biden votes. This is nonsense. And that our
[53:29.660 --> 53:34.620]  non-guy on Fox needs to go because he's... By the way, look at this footage of Philly with a lady
[53:34.620 --> 53:40.140]  stuffing a mailbox with ballots. I mean, this is just ridiculous. And Philly, they're running around
[53:40.140 --> 53:46.460]  with, put them in cars, boxes of them. This is ridiculous. Yep. I have a tape of lunch ladies,
[53:46.460 --> 53:52.540]  proving lunch ladies handed out absentee ballots to the elementary school children,
[53:52.540 --> 53:56.460]  including illegal immigrants. There's so much of this. They don't want to go into court on this.
[53:56.460 --> 54:01.740]  They are hoping that the media can... Yeah, he's up on Trump. Silence is Trump. I agree. Let's come
[54:01.740 --> 54:06.140]  back and do five more minutes. I'm going to ask you both. At this moment in history, what happens
[54:06.140 --> 54:11.020]  if they do steal it? I don't want to be negative, but it's almost worse for the globalist because,
[54:11.020 --> 54:18.140]  I mean, an addled CHICOM agent with all these investigations hanging over him. We've got Joe
[54:18.140 --> 54:22.060]  Hoffs and we've got Patrick Halley. I didn't even plug the sour. We need you to fund this.
[54:22.060 --> 54:27.020]  We've got great products. DNA Force Plus with the PQQ, the CoQ10. So good for your immune system.
[54:27.020 --> 54:32.140]  The Rolls Royce of products. Cleaning out your telomeres, your mitochondria. It's 50% off.
[54:32.140 --> 54:36.380]  Free shipping for triple pay for your points. We also have the body's ultimate tumor formula
[54:36.380 --> 54:44.940]  back in stock. Also discounted. We'll be right back. The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces
[54:44.940 --> 54:49.820]  for any big corporation or government that'll pay them. It's that simple. They've used our open free
[54:49.820 --> 54:55.100]  society against us. The controlled media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years
[54:55.100 --> 54:59.580]  and obsess over it. They see he's a liar on purpose, even though our success rate, our
[54:59.580 --> 55:05.020]  accuracy rate is way, way better than theirs. We try to tell the truth. They try to lie. They try
[55:05.020 --> 55:10.380]  to deceive. I'm trying to get people to realize that the globalist operate and how they manipulate,
[55:10.380 --> 55:16.540]  how they bamboozle the public. I'm trying to get the public to ask questions and to not believe
[55:16.540 --> 55:23.340]  what they're told in the face. I'm trying to get people to research for themselves. The globalists
[55:23.340 --> 55:28.220]  of their controlled corporate press say that researching and not trusting media is evil and
[55:28.220 --> 55:34.300]  is a conspiracy theory. But again, on its face, that is a fraud. Question everything. Question
[55:34.300 --> 55:38.540]  info wars. Add your own research to it and then decide what you're going to promote to others
[55:38.540 --> 55:42.060]  and what news sources are accurate. I believe info wars is the best source out there.
[55:42.060 --> 55:52.460]  It's all on record. Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago and
[55:52.460 --> 55:58.460]  then again six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic
[55:58.460 --> 56:03.900]  and how to get the public to take inoculations. And they talk about calling people heroes that do it.
[56:03.900 --> 56:08.140]  They talk about shaming those that don't. This has all been psychologically tested.
[56:08.140 --> 56:13.340]  It's all been psychologically prepared. And once they get you locked down for 15 days,
[56:13.340 --> 56:18.380]  you notice now they say it's permanent. That's how it works. Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[56:18.380 --> 56:23.660]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right. No. Now,
[56:23.660 --> 56:29.660]  we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van. He's taking us to his
[56:29.660 --> 56:34.620]  shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death. That's the allegory. We got to bust out of this
[56:34.620 --> 56:39.260]  thing now. We got to say no now. We got to make a run for it now. We still can't. Once he gets us
[56:39.260 --> 56:43.340]  in that basement, it's going to get a lot, lot worse, folks. So stop submitting.
[56:43.340 --> 57:05.260]  Hey, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. I looked into someone's eyes again, and it's been all so long.
[57:05.260 --> 57:10.940]  Globalists keep coming back for more running their scams. Joe Hoff, David London. Final
[57:10.940 --> 57:13.660]  question. We really appreciate you and your brother and all the great work you guys do.
[57:13.660 --> 57:16.140]  And then I'm going to ask the same question to Patrick Alley, the land market is coming in. We
[57:16.140 --> 57:22.060]  got a bunch of clubs and breaking analysis. What is the enemy's path to victory? We need to know
[57:22.060 --> 57:25.980]  their mind. And I mean, they're not doing this for no reason. They have an intent to steal it.
[57:27.100 --> 57:30.380]  And they just think the media will cover for all their fraud. This is naked fraud.
[57:30.380 --> 57:32.140]  What happens if they're able to remove Trump?
[57:35.660 --> 57:39.100]  This sounds pretty scary, Alex, doesn't it? I think it's frightening. I think,
[57:39.100 --> 57:44.540]  I think we have to do everything we can to make this not happen. Everything we can with everything
[57:44.540 --> 57:51.180]  we got. I mean, I'm really concerned that if Biden does win with all the corruption that we
[57:51.180 --> 57:56.300]  already know about from the last time he was in office, when that guy's a total crook, he doesn't
[57:56.300 --> 58:02.620]  know what's going on now, but he is a crooked senile old man. And his whole administration
[58:02.620 --> 58:10.780]  would be insane and very, very corrupt. The individual who's been behind all this, gosh,
[58:10.780 --> 58:16.940]  I forgot his name now. It just slipped out of my mind. But Obama's ethics czar was put in place.
[58:16.940 --> 58:21.660]  Everything but ethics. This guy was an animal and now he's put in the country through this.
[58:21.660 --> 58:26.700]  I think we got to fight everything. I remember that czar. He was the weirdo that said we can
[58:26.700 --> 58:32.780]  suspend reality and quote outlaw getting sunshine. But what was his name? It'll pop my head in a
[58:32.780 --> 58:38.460]  minute. I mean, these are like crazy people. Yeah. And he was behind the impeachment. He was
[58:38.460 --> 58:44.700]  behind the Mueller investigation. He set up 10 different reasons to impeach Trump. He actually
[58:44.700 --> 58:50.300]  was a witness at the impeachment. He's been behind everything and they believe he's behind this as
[58:50.300 --> 58:56.300]  well. So this is not the kind of people that we need run in our country. We need good men and
[58:56.300 --> 59:02.700]  Christian men and women. And and so, you know, Judeo Christian. Anyways, we've got to get this.
[59:02.700 --> 59:07.900]  We got to get this fixed. We got to fight with every ounce of that we have. We cannot allow them
[59:07.900 --> 59:14.860]  to steal this. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's Eisen. Yes. Norm. Norm Eisen. That's right.
[59:14.860 --> 59:20.700]  And I forget the other czar was the one that said outlaw getting sunshine. I swear to God, folks.
[59:20.700 --> 59:24.860]  He said fact checkers. We need to take over the news. This is like 10 years ago and they've done
[59:24.860 --> 59:29.420]  it now. And what was his name upon my head a minute? He said, like an example is those that
[59:29.420 --> 59:35.420]  claim sunshine is good for you. I mean, these are crazy people. Yeah, they are. And they're evil.
[59:35.420 --> 59:40.700]  They're evil people. And I tell you what, a four years of more evil. I don't know if I don't,
[59:40.700 --> 59:45.100]  I guess I don't believe our country can make it. I want, I want my son to enjoy freedom.
[59:45.820 --> 59:49.900]  I agree. Joe, we'll talk to you soon. Thank you so much. Amazing job. Thank you. Patrick
[59:49.900 --> 59:55.260]  Halle saying question to you. I stand with the president. I'm 100% committed to victory and
[59:55.260 --> 59:59.420]  I predict victory. I believe that we will win every single one of these states that are still there,
[59:59.420 --> 1:00:03.580]  including by challenging these votes. And what they're going to do is they're going to launch
[1:00:03.580 --> 1:00:09.260]  the riot squads as soon as the media puts Joe at 270. But you know, they're going to launch
[1:00:09.260 --> 1:00:14.140]  shutdown DC and Antifa is going to mobilize. And so they think that will scare the suburbanites
[1:00:14.140 --> 1:00:19.180]  into backing away from Trump. They're trying to break our coalition. Our job is to keep our people
[1:00:19.180 --> 1:00:22.620]  together. Is to say, look, we're going to win this thing. It's just going to take a little
[1:00:22.620 --> 1:00:27.100]  while longer. We need to hold together. Don't let them intimidate you. Because in the long
[1:00:27.100 --> 1:00:31.580]  run, we're going to win this thing. I've got the numbers. I've got the data. We have the lawyers.
[1:00:31.580 --> 1:00:36.620]  We're going to win because they're stealing this thing with ridiculous paper ballots that don't
[1:00:36.620 --> 1:00:40.940]  actually exist. I agree. We got Leanne McAdoo coming up and I'm going to war game that more
[1:00:40.940 --> 1:00:43.740]  with you because I just want to say it. I don't want to go on a plane. I want to go up to DC.
[1:00:43.740 --> 1:00:46.540]  I don't want to be around Antifa or the stabbing people and all the rest of it.
[1:00:46.540 --> 1:00:56.140]  But they are literally stabbing people and doing all this. We have to surround the White House.
[1:00:56.140 --> 1:00:59.340]  So they can't just point at this mob of communists and say, oh, look, the people
[1:00:59.340 --> 1:01:03.020]  want Trump out. It's legitimate. We're going to have to hit the streets. And I want to warn the
[1:01:03.020 --> 1:01:07.500]  establishment. If they think they've seen anything yet with these peaceful crowds of millions,
[1:01:07.500 --> 1:01:11.420]  they've not seen anything yet. Patrick, at a sick level, I want to tell us when we come back,
[1:01:11.420 --> 1:01:17.500]  Leanne McAdoo is coming in. If I was McAvelli long term and would do evil stuff for greater
[1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:21.020]  good, I don't believe in that, it justifies the means of fraud. It's the Ring of Bordor.
[1:01:21.020 --> 1:01:24.700]  I would have them remove Trump and pull this camp because they're sowing seeds so
[1:01:25.420 --> 1:01:29.740]  destructive to the new border. I mean, if they think they've seen resistance, they are going to
[1:01:29.740 --> 1:01:37.500]  create a hellstorm of resistance if they remove our great president so fraudulently and so,
[1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:42.540]  so openly. I mean, this is an input. I mean, one thing was a slick operator. I mean, Joe Biden
[1:01:42.540 --> 1:01:48.620]  doesn't know what damn planet he's on. Our gladiator can be defeated by this pipsqueak idiot. No one's
[1:01:48.620 --> 1:01:56.700]  going to buy this. There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed. And why is
[1:01:56.700 --> 1:02:02.060]  that? It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree like bush grows from it that
[1:02:02.060 --> 1:02:08.940]  produces more mustard seeds. Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing
[1:02:08.940 --> 1:02:13.500]  health effects. They didn't know why. Well, with modern science, we know it's one of the purest,
[1:02:13.500 --> 1:02:20.620]  cleanest, organic forms of selenium. We have bio-true selenium sold out for months back in
[1:02:20.620 --> 1:02:28.780]  stock at InfoWarsStore.com at 50% off, store-wide free shipping, and triple the Patriot points.
[1:02:28.780 --> 1:02:36.540]  Bio-true selenium at InfoWarsStore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing in that it
[1:02:36.540 --> 1:02:42.620]  funds our operation. But if you don't know about selenium, research it. It is an essential nutrient
[1:02:42.620 --> 1:02:48.060]  in the body that you actually have to have. It's back in stock 50% off, triple Patriot points
[1:02:48.060 --> 1:03:02.940]  at InfoWarsStore.com and with free shipping.
[1:03:02.940 --> 1:03:11.100]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[1:03:11.100 --> 1:03:19.740]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:03:21.740 --> 1:03:25.340]  I would say that globalization is inevitable unless someone really moves in to stop it.
[1:03:28.860 --> 1:03:35.580]  We have all agreed to pursue the sustainable development goals to 2030. The fourth industrial
[1:03:35.580 --> 1:03:41.900]  revolution, particularly digital technology, has fundamentally changed the global economic
[1:03:41.900 --> 1:03:47.420]  landscape. Globalization is an inevitable and irreversible trend.
[1:03:55.500 --> 1:03:59.900]  We should not avoid challenges brought by the economic globalization.
[1:03:59.900 --> 1:04:06.220]  Instead, we should look directly at the gap of wealth and of development.
[1:04:06.220 --> 1:04:15.020]  Well, the foundation can't achieve ambitious goals in global health without deep partnerships with
[1:04:15.660 --> 1:04:19.580]  the rich countries that provide most of the aid.
[1:04:19.580 --> 1:04:30.300]  Everything that is broken today can be fixed and every failure can be turned into a truly
[1:04:31.180 --> 1:04:39.340]  great success. We must replace the present policy of globalism, which has just taken
[1:04:39.340 --> 1:04:47.180]  so many jobs out of our communities and so much wealth out of our country, and replace it with
[1:04:47.180 --> 1:04:58.060]  a new policy of Americanism. America first. Remember that.
[1:04:58.700 --> 1:05:05.180]  Now the world is awakening to globalism and the forces of globalism are striking back
[1:05:05.980 --> 1:05:08.380]  in incredibly vicious ways.
[1:05:08.380 --> 1:05:23.420]  And then there's the 79 days of hell that I've been talking about that start the day of the
[1:05:23.420 --> 1:05:28.780]  election. The Democrats have openly said first in internal statements that in white papers,
[1:05:28.780 --> 1:05:33.420]  that in war-gamed operations, then in Democrat think tank statements, then in the New York
[1:05:33.420 --> 1:05:38.940]  Times three months ago, that they are going to contest, they know Trump's going to win, and
[1:05:38.940 --> 1:05:44.140]  that they're going to have Western states split off, tank the dollar in the stock market, have
[1:05:44.140 --> 1:05:50.700]  race riots nationwide as the cover, and try to drive President Trump from office. The big corporations,
[1:05:50.700 --> 1:05:58.540]  the banks, Hollywood, the chai comms, the Democrats, all of these systems, along with radical Islam
[1:05:58.540 --> 1:06:05.820]  and Communist China are allied against us right now. We told you when they were in the secret
[1:06:05.820 --> 1:06:09.980]  phases that this was happening, but now they've prepared themselves, they've prepared the public,
[1:06:09.980 --> 1:06:14.300]  it's why they flooded us with the 80 million ballots, a lot of people got three or four ballots,
[1:06:14.300 --> 1:06:19.180]  dead cats, dead dogs, dead people got them, so that even if Trump is winning by three,
[1:06:19.180 --> 1:06:23.580]  four points in battleground states and statistically has a majority, and you can see that there's a
[1:06:23.580 --> 1:06:27.820]  bunch of votes that haven't been cast, but still he'd win if all of those went Democrat,
[1:06:27.820 --> 1:06:31.420]  they're going to say we don't care, they're all going to be counted, and they put out so many
[1:06:31.420 --> 1:06:36.060]  millions of fake ones that he may never be able to get to that number because they'll never be
[1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:41.100]  able to count enough of the ballots to give him that clear victory. But the easiest thing for him
[1:06:41.100 --> 1:06:47.500]  to do is to stand up like a man and accept the results of an election of the American people.
[1:06:48.140 --> 1:06:55.500]  For him to make these kinds of statements shows his lack of patriotism. I feel very confident
[1:06:55.500 --> 1:07:04.540]  that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday, whatever the end count is, but on the
[1:07:04.540 --> 1:07:10.220]  election that occurs on Tuesday he will be elected on January 20th, he will be inaugurated president
[1:07:10.220 --> 1:07:15.340]  of the United States. Now notice that's not a slip, that's what he's been saying for months,
[1:07:15.340 --> 1:07:19.740]  that it doesn't matter what the election says, we're not going to accept it, and then we're going
[1:07:19.740 --> 1:07:28.060]  to have states secede, and then we will seat him geographically from another location, and that
[1:07:28.060 --> 1:07:32.780]  geography doesn't matter, the White House doesn't matter, it matters who they say the president is.
[1:07:32.780 --> 1:07:47.980]  Well you want to fight the new world order, Trump put the Davos and told them point blank,
[1:07:48.700 --> 1:07:55.500]  it's over, we're not your bitch, now they're striking their attack. So if they get in,
[1:07:55.500 --> 1:08:00.620]  they're going to bankrupt and gut the country, they said they are, and so I guess folks will
[1:08:00.620 --> 1:08:03.980]  finally wake up then, Patrick Howley was making a great point in the last segment, I want him to
[1:08:03.980 --> 1:08:08.220]  recap the path to victory, what the real numbers are, what we're facing, Leigh Ann McAdoo is going
[1:08:08.220 --> 1:08:12.300]  to be riding shotgun with us into the next hour, Leigh Ann you were here late last night, did a
[1:08:12.300 --> 1:08:17.420]  great job, a lot of folks were telling me be confident he's going to win tonight, and I said no,
[1:08:17.420 --> 1:08:20.940]  I don't think so, the Democrats have said they're going to freeze these states and not let him win,
[1:08:20.940 --> 1:08:25.180]  I mean they said what they were going to do. Right, they started to see him take a strong
[1:08:25.180 --> 1:08:29.340]  lead in Pennsylvania and just said you know what, we're going to go ahead, this is the super bowl
[1:08:29.340 --> 1:08:33.500]  of the elections, we've been preparing for this all year, but we're going to go ahead and just go
[1:08:33.500 --> 1:08:38.780]  call it, put a lid on it, go take a nap, get some rest, I mean it's unprecedented what's
[1:08:38.780 --> 1:08:44.700]  happening, and I've had, I woke up with just like anger in my soul because we're really seeing that
[1:08:44.700 --> 1:08:51.100]  there is no limit to how low the Democrats will go, how dark they will take this country.
[1:08:51.100 --> 1:08:54.380]  This is a real moment of truth, it's a wake up call, we're going to be covering all these articles
[1:08:54.380 --> 1:08:58.220]  of breaking news you've got in the hour, Patrick we appreciate you national file.com,
[1:08:58.220 --> 1:09:01.340]  recap what you were saying earlier, some stations don't care that first five minutes
[1:09:01.340 --> 1:09:06.140]  about the real path to victory and your realist view and the sources you've got in the real numbers
[1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:09.420]  right now and what we need to do because they're trying to take our liberty right now,
[1:09:09.420 --> 1:09:13.420]  they're trying to steal our election right now. Well I believe that we're going to win the
[1:09:13.420 --> 1:09:18.700]  outstanding states and I've just received this statement from Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien
[1:09:19.340 --> 1:09:23.740]  and this is breaking news, he says despite ridiculous public polling used as a voter
[1:09:23.740 --> 1:09:28.700]  suppression tactic, Wisconsin has been a razor thin race as we always knew that it would be.
[1:09:28.700 --> 1:09:32.860]  There have been reports of irregularities in several Wisconsin counties which raised serious
[1:09:32.860 --> 1:09:38.220]  doubts about the validity of the results. The president is well within the threshold to request
[1:09:38.220 --> 1:09:43.660]  a recount and we will immediately do so. So already we're going to recount it in Wisconsin.
[1:09:43.660 --> 1:09:48.460]  So the president is engaging, yes, right, yes, the first X-wings are away.
[1:09:48.460 --> 1:09:55.660]  Now, we are confident that Trump is going to win Pennsylvania by at least 40,000 votes,
[1:09:55.660 --> 1:10:00.940]  that this massive more than half a million vote margin that President Donald Trump has right
[1:10:00.940 --> 1:10:05.420]  now even with all of the rampant fraud in Philadelphia is not going to be overturned.
[1:10:05.420 --> 1:10:10.140]  And by the way, they do not want to fight us in the courts in Pennsylvania. They do not want to go
[1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:16.540]  through ballot by ballot in Philadelphia. Georgia is a joke. Georgia, they are so desperate,
[1:10:16.540 --> 1:10:21.260]  they had to do the burst water pipe, okay, the burst water pipe. And now they want until Friday
[1:10:21.260 --> 1:10:27.740]  to cook up ballots in Fulton County. It's the biggest joke ever. Trump's up by over 100,000
[1:10:27.740 --> 1:10:32.540]  as of the last counting. Even the new updates, they're not moving the lever at all in Georgia.
[1:10:32.540 --> 1:10:37.740]  Everybody knows Trump is winning Georgia. Wisconsin, we're recounting. We have no idea
[1:10:37.740 --> 1:10:40.860]  even what the real numbers are because of all these ridiculous ballots that we're
[1:10:40.860 --> 1:10:46.460]  about Nevada that Fox evenly called as we predicted early, uh, playing the part of Judas Iscariot.
[1:10:47.500 --> 1:10:51.500]  Nevada is very much in play. And in fact, Jason Miller and Steppien said earlier today that
[1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:56.940]  they believe both Arizona and Nevada is in play. The last count that we have for Nevada
[1:10:56.940 --> 1:11:05.900]  at 86% and it cuts off at 86%. Biden is only up by 7,647 votes. We know Trump's super popular in
[1:11:05.900 --> 1:11:11.100]  Las Vegas and we know a ton of people in Nevada want to get back to work at casinos and resorts and
[1:11:11.100 --> 1:11:15.020]  entertainment. They don't want to be locked in. Who believes that they want the lockdown to
[1:11:15.020 --> 1:11:20.860]  continue? This is pure horse manure. Right. Absolutely not. Every casino owner in Las Vegas.
[1:11:20.860 --> 1:11:24.380]  So what about Arizona? Fox did falsely claim that too. What about Arizona?
[1:11:25.580 --> 1:11:30.620]  So here's the deal in Arizona. They claim Biden's up by about 93,000 votes with 84%
[1:11:30.620 --> 1:11:35.900]  reporting. I don't believe it for, for a minute. And I believe that there are massive irregularities
[1:11:35.900 --> 1:11:40.460]  with the numbers stemming from, and this is a, this is a real scoop. The Sharpie problem,
[1:11:40.460 --> 1:11:45.660]  they were giving out Sharpies to conservatives to sign the ballots. And then I believe it has been
[1:11:45.660 --> 1:11:50.220]  alleged that only the ballpoint pen ballots were being counted in addition to various other
[1:11:50.220 --> 1:11:54.460]  irregularities. So Arizona is going to end up in court. No question about it. The Trump campaign
[1:11:54.460 --> 1:11:59.260]  was livid at Fox news. I think the Fox news calling that early was the most shameful thing
[1:11:59.260 --> 1:12:03.820]  they've ever done, including cheerleading for the Iraq war. It was awful. Tucker Carlson
[1:12:03.820 --> 1:12:08.940]  questioned it to them on the air, you know, right to their faces, but Fox is ridiculous that Arnon
[1:12:08.940 --> 1:12:13.740]  guy is a joke. Nobody's ever heard of them. And yet he's like the new Fauci. Oh, Arnon,
[1:12:13.740 --> 1:12:18.860]  tell us what to think. Who cares about Arnon info wars is way better than Fox news. Fox isn't
[1:12:18.860 --> 1:12:23.660]  running this. And I think the Trump White House and the Trump campaign needs to realize that
[1:12:23.660 --> 1:12:29.420]  Fox is not running this because the Fox top government executive in Washington, DC, their
[1:12:29.420 --> 1:12:34.220]  top guy was Biden's chief of staff. And they've got Donna. That's right, Patrick Halley. Join
[1:12:34.220 --> 1:12:38.060]  us again as things develop, stay in contact, pop in throughout the day. Rodgers Jones coming
[1:12:38.060 --> 1:12:42.220]  up as well. Thank you so much, Patrick Halley. We're right back with Lee Ann McAdoo. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:12:42.220 --> 1:12:54.300]  Remember, don't worry, be happy. Everything's going to be all right. Over and over, you ever
[1:12:54.300 --> 1:13:01.020]  told, let the technocracy spy on you. Let big tech control what you do. They will never abuse their
[1:13:01.020 --> 1:13:06.060]  power. They will never hurt you. And just as soon as they got their global AI grid in,
[1:13:06.060 --> 1:13:11.820]  they use communist China as the beta test to sell the world. I'm just topic martial law lockdown.
[1:13:12.380 --> 1:13:16.220]  When it all started eight, nine months ago, I told you it's never going to end. They're never
[1:13:16.220 --> 1:13:20.700]  going to turn loose this power. They're going to make you have internal passports on your phones
[1:13:21.580 --> 1:13:25.500]  to leave your house to have a job to travel. They're going to add more and more restrictions
[1:13:25.500 --> 1:13:32.060]  on of how you get that travel pass. Remember the running man, sports dagger movie, the mid 80s,
[1:13:32.060 --> 1:13:36.860]  written by Stephen King about a future police state. Watch that movie and then compare it to
[1:13:36.860 --> 1:13:46.060]  today. We are in the absolute brand, the absolute mold of a classic authoritarian dystopic nightmare.
[1:13:46.060 --> 1:13:51.260]  We've got to reject this now before it's cemented. Look it up for yourself. The head of the Davos
[1:13:51.260 --> 1:13:57.820]  group issued a report one six months ago calling for world government to be openly established
[1:13:57.820 --> 1:14:04.300]  to respond to COVID-19. The COVID-19 was a blessing to lower the planet's carbon footprint.
[1:14:04.300 --> 1:14:09.260]  Since then, Prince Charles and countless others have come out and said the exact same thing.
[1:14:10.060 --> 1:14:17.180]  The most ancient form of total war is called siege. That's when you cut people off from their
[1:14:17.180 --> 1:14:22.540]  resources. That's when you lock them down. And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the
[1:14:22.540 --> 1:14:26.860]  globalist or just get rid of Donald Trump. That's only part of it. This is siege to literally train
[1:14:26.860 --> 1:14:32.860]  us to be poor and to get us into deep debt. So then the globalist social engineers can dictate
[1:14:32.860 --> 1:14:38.460]  how we live our lives with the social credit score surveillance grip. You've heard the U.S.
[1:14:38.460 --> 1:14:43.020]  Army saying our job is to kill people and break things. Well, that's what the lockdown is doing.
[1:14:43.020 --> 1:14:46.620]  It's starving the third world, millions and millions of death. It's breaking down the supply
[1:14:46.620 --> 1:15:02.540]  chain in society. It's their mission. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:16.780 --> 1:15:21.580]  here for election coverage. She's been here for eight years or so. Good to have her back visiting.
[1:15:22.380 --> 1:15:26.380]  Leigh Ann, your perspective on this is really what I should have been saying from the very
[1:15:26.380 --> 1:15:30.940]  start of the show. There's one set of responsibilities for Trump, another for the media and the
[1:15:30.940 --> 1:15:36.300]  Democrats. It's more transparent than ever, but they're just doing it. Right. Only the media is
[1:15:36.300 --> 1:15:41.500]  allowed to call the election. You know, New York Times actually had to delete their tweet where
[1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:47.740]  they said it's the media who gets to say who is elected president and, you know, how dare Trump
[1:15:47.740 --> 1:15:52.300]  declare an early victory. And they've been kind of massaging this into our brains, preparing us for
[1:15:52.300 --> 1:15:57.740]  Oh, if he even dares try to declare early victory, how evil would he be? Meanwhile,
[1:15:57.740 --> 1:16:02.940]  they all stop and pause their broadcast so that they can bring Joe Biden out last night before he
[1:16:02.940 --> 1:16:07.740]  needs to go get in bed and take a nap, you know, that he can come out and say, we think we've
[1:16:07.740 --> 1:16:14.140]  definitely won. Trump says basically the same thing and gets taken to Twitter. Yeah, I mean,
[1:16:14.140 --> 1:16:19.820]  it's just it's and then of course, Fox News and all these other networks, they really go after him
[1:16:19.820 --> 1:16:26.220]  hardcore forcefully calling him out networks repudiate the president. How dare he say that and
[1:16:26.220 --> 1:16:32.620]  call the election integrity into question. Remember, they never said he was they said,
[1:16:32.620 --> 1:16:36.860]  though he wasn't legitimate for all those years as a Russian agent when it was Joe Biden and
[1:16:36.860 --> 1:16:43.580]  Obama and Hillary hanging off the Russian TPs. Nancy Pelosi. I mean, we've only scratched the
[1:16:43.580 --> 1:16:49.340]  surface of of the family members who have been enriched by these politicians that have been
[1:16:49.340 --> 1:16:54.620]  in office for 40 plus years. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want anyone to peel back the curtain on her family
[1:16:54.620 --> 1:17:02.380]  and how they've become so massively wealthy, you know, on her salary. So, you know, this is just
[1:17:02.380 --> 1:17:07.340]  we're just at the beginning here. And Michael Moore came out and said how afraid we should all
[1:17:07.340 --> 1:17:12.140]  be that Trump is going to have the nuclear codes for the next 60 plus days. He's horrible. He's
[1:17:12.140 --> 1:17:15.980]  been pulling us out of all these wars. So he's going to nuke us. Yeah, everything's upside down
[1:17:15.980 --> 1:17:21.660]  world. It's absolutely opposite of everything that's going on. In fact, if if that's the case,
[1:17:21.660 --> 1:17:27.900]  I hope Trump does go nuclear on all the people that have been involved in this coup for the last
[1:17:27.900 --> 1:17:32.220]  40. Remember, Swallows well said if Americans won't turn their guns in will nuke them. So you're not
[1:17:32.220 --> 1:17:36.540]  literally saying nuke them. You're saying he's to go nuclear politically, but he's just got a bunch
[1:17:36.540 --> 1:17:41.580]  of not need lawyers in the Justice Department. Yes, I mean, he has he has had everything going
[1:17:41.580 --> 1:17:47.020]  against him for the last four years. Every, you know, he's he's had people pushed into his
[1:17:47.020 --> 1:17:53.340]  administration that were just there to take him out and he had a Herculean job like cleaning out
[1:17:53.340 --> 1:17:57.900]  the Aegean stables and he's done that. And now he's under now he's fighting the Hydra. I mean,
[1:17:57.900 --> 1:18:03.980]  this is so real, so epic. I can't turn away, but it's horrifying. Right. And China, they want Biden
[1:18:03.980 --> 1:18:09.260]  in there. They're and they say they do. They're so excited for the potential that Biden might be
[1:18:09.260 --> 1:18:14.540]  back in. They said that he is in sync with them. Right. That's a quote. They said he is literally
[1:18:14.540 --> 1:18:20.540]  them. Right. And I think that that's what we were being prepared for. Back in 2016, 2013,
[1:18:20.540 --> 1:18:25.180]  2014, 15, when President Obama was basically telling us that we needed to get used to just
[1:18:25.180 --> 1:18:30.460]  not being the superpower anymore. We need to just get used to it when our jobs aren't coming back.
[1:18:30.460 --> 1:18:34.780]  China's going to enjoy how he screwed you. Right. And they thought Hillary Clinton would get in and
[1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:40.060]  just be able to do that peaceful. I'm a woman. So I'm allowed to cut the country. I'm a woman.
[1:18:40.060 --> 1:18:44.780]  Did you don't don't hurt a woman? And then of course, President Trump got in. He he started to
[1:18:44.780 --> 1:18:49.420]  really turn things around and as a smart businessman say, wait, why are we selling America out?
[1:18:49.420 --> 1:18:52.700]  None of them. Why do we have we just we just said we're not having one side of deals anymore.
[1:18:52.700 --> 1:18:57.660]  Right. A lot of minorities were doing so much better under under President Trump that it was
[1:18:57.660 --> 1:19:03.260]  starting to really actually rattle the Democratic Party. So there was no there was there was no
[1:19:03.260 --> 1:19:10.220]  other option for the globalist than to send out COVID to crash the economy worldwide to take
[1:19:10.220 --> 1:19:17.500]  everybody out. And I really do feel like this was a pandemic and not necessarily the most
[1:19:17.500 --> 1:19:23.340]  vicious of the diseases they have laying in wait. But just something that could, you know,
[1:19:23.340 --> 1:19:28.380]  give them a little bit of opportunity to take down and sort of do do some projection mapping
[1:19:28.380 --> 1:19:32.540]  to see how a global pandemic would actually affect. Exactly. This was a giant drill. And
[1:19:32.540 --> 1:19:36.300]  we've passed the test as good slaves. And now Bill Gates says the more deadly weapons coming
[1:19:36.300 --> 1:19:41.340]  on Colbert. And I just cannot believe the amount of people that have voted for Joe Biden knowing
[1:19:41.340 --> 1:19:45.820]  that they're going to have more lockdowns, more masks. And everyone's like, Oh, well,
[1:19:45.820 --> 1:19:49.420]  maybe it'll be peaceful if he gets in and there won't be any more violence. No,
[1:19:49.420 --> 1:19:54.140]  they're going to be sending out the military and using their power to come round up anyone who
[1:19:54.140 --> 1:19:58.060]  refused. They've said what you've seen in Europe, what you've seen in Australia is coming under
[1:19:58.060 --> 1:20:01.820]  Biden. And they have Stockholm syndrome. Lee and they're not a leader like you or other of our
[1:20:01.820 --> 1:20:06.380]  listeners. They literally just cannot believe they're faced with an oppressor. So they go,
[1:20:06.380 --> 1:20:11.340]  this is not an oppressor. Right. He loves me. They want what's best for us. They said they care
[1:20:11.340 --> 1:20:17.180]  about he had to knock my teeth out. I deserved it. Yes, I had it come in. I was bad. Yeah. So
[1:20:17.180 --> 1:20:22.700]  it's I try to think for myself. And that's it. It's like everything is we're living in the total
[1:20:22.700 --> 1:20:27.900]  opposite world. The peaceful protests that get violent where people are being stabbed in DC
[1:20:27.900 --> 1:20:33.660]  and elsewhere, looting, rioting, burning things down. That's peaceful. That's totally fine. But
[1:20:33.660 --> 1:20:39.660]  if anyone dares question the election or, you know, the things that are going on there at the polls
[1:20:39.660 --> 1:20:47.180]  that you get shut down, you get silenced. And I mean, it's driving people mad. It makes you feel
[1:20:47.180 --> 1:20:52.140]  like you are powerless at this point, because they're just so dastardly and they'll stop it.
[1:20:52.140 --> 1:20:59.100]  Nothing. It almost makes you want to just retreat, give up, white flag, surrender. Okay. But then
[1:20:59.100 --> 1:21:02.700]  you learn they don't just want the power. They want to put stuff in our bodies. They want to kill
[1:21:02.700 --> 1:21:06.860]  us. And they want to rape our kids. I mean, you tell stories about family in Houston, where at
[1:21:06.860 --> 1:21:12.300]  the hospitals where you have some family works, the women, the lesbian women bring in the adopted
[1:21:12.300 --> 1:21:16.140]  little boy they've got. They want to chop his four-year-old balls off and they're pissed because
[1:21:16.140 --> 1:21:20.860]  the hospital won't do it. I mean, it's like a weird like, we want to testicles. You said it made
[1:21:20.860 --> 1:21:24.940]  you physically sick. Right. Well, it's like, it's an elective surgery. So we're not going to do it.
[1:21:24.940 --> 1:21:31.500]  Oh, well, how dare you? This is a, you know, this, this is my daughter, you know, maybe she's born
[1:21:31.500 --> 1:21:36.940]  a male and they're so fetishizing this surgery. And it's like, no, they're so fed that there's
[1:21:36.940 --> 1:21:41.820]  a way that they're fetishized. They get off on it. And it's just become this, this massive thing to,
[1:21:41.820 --> 1:21:47.900]  to neuter everyone. It's a war on humanity. And these women have so turned to Satan. They literally
[1:21:47.900 --> 1:21:54.220]  want the sacrament of mutilating their boy. And then they make it a victory, a female victory.
[1:21:54.220 --> 1:21:59.900]  That's not feminine to chop your son's balls off. That's satanic. No, it's the opposite of feminine.
[1:21:59.900 --> 1:22:05.020]  Yeah. I mean, I just, I don't, I don't understand. That's a cult matter. There's a cult of women
[1:22:05.020 --> 1:22:10.700]  that chop their son's balls off. And that's what we're doing. Yeah. Or if it's a, if I find out
[1:22:10.700 --> 1:22:15.340]  I'm pregnant with a boy, I'm getting an abortion, you know, I'm either having a girl or an abortion.
[1:22:15.340 --> 1:22:20.140]  Oh, that's a big feminist thing. Kill your son. Right. And it's just, you know, I just, I'm not
[1:22:20.140 --> 1:22:26.140]  sure why maybe that is part of the whole psychological thing of just having America submit
[1:22:26.140 --> 1:22:30.860]  and just turning us all into America. I mean, it's liberal cuts your son's balls off. Yes,
[1:22:30.860 --> 1:22:35.580]  we don't need any strong men in our country. Um, you know, but imagine an enemy that said,
[1:22:36.300 --> 1:22:39.580]  we're coming, we're taking over, we're going to force inject you with deadly stuff and we're
[1:22:39.580 --> 1:22:43.900]  going to chop your son's balls off. We would go to war with that. Right. You know, that's what
[1:22:43.900 --> 1:22:49.980]  Moses and that's actually in the Egyptian stuff against Ramses. His dad had the firstborn Israelites
[1:22:49.980 --> 1:22:54.620]  killed the boys. Right. So this is just, so instead of just killing the boys, they can say
[1:22:54.620 --> 1:22:59.500]  trans is now dead. Like my son's a ghost. We split his throat. And so it's just to chop the balls
[1:22:59.500 --> 1:23:03.900]  off. Like my son's trans. He's dead. He identifies as a dead person. So you shoot your kid in the
[1:23:03.900 --> 1:23:07.740]  head. I mean, they can't go that far yet. So it's like, we'll just get the, the way of us.
[1:23:07.740 --> 1:23:13.420]  Right. No, it's, it's actually a sick trajectory that we're on. And I don't know if anyone else got
[1:23:13.980 --> 1:23:18.620]  massively creeped out when Joe Biden did his little speech last night and he did that weird,
[1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:24.220]  creepy puppet smile where only half of his face went up and pull up Biden's speech last night,
[1:23:24.220 --> 1:23:27.580]  guys. Let's play that when we come back. Oh, and Leanne, you mentioned nuclear war and how Trump's
[1:23:27.580 --> 1:23:32.860]  against it. Big bring that amazing video with you comparing the Barry Goldwater, the anti
[1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:38.140]  Barry Goldwater ad from 68 with, with the one you did about nuclear war of Hillary got in.
[1:23:38.140 --> 1:23:41.180]  We'll play that when we come back and then we'll play the original
[1:23:42.380 --> 1:23:47.420]  anti Barry Goldwater LBJ nuclear ad little girl in the daisies. When we come back, stay with us.
[1:23:47.420 --> 1:23:52.620]  The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites, the most cunning, smart,
[1:23:52.620 --> 1:23:59.020]  inventive people believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore. They don't believe in being
[1:23:59.020 --> 1:24:04.220]  aristocrats trying to hold up civilization and power the people. And once the establishment
[1:24:04.220 --> 1:24:09.100]  has that predatory idea, civilization collapses very, very quickly. You can't treat the least of
[1:24:09.100 --> 1:24:14.700]  us like garbage and not treat your own family like that. And so it is this lack of empathy that's
[1:24:14.700 --> 1:24:20.300]  going to destroy us. The globalists can try to be heartless devil worshipers that commit rituals
[1:24:20.300 --> 1:24:25.580]  of all sorts of horrible crimes, try to get away from a humanity, but really they can't escape the
[1:24:25.580 --> 1:24:31.020]  laws of the universe. They may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves,
[1:24:31.020 --> 1:24:35.900]  but the repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the
[1:24:35.900 --> 1:24:41.820]  very structure itself. Wealth is created by loving God. Wealth is created by having connection to God.
[1:24:41.820 --> 1:24:46.620]  God is the source of all creation, all success, all power. We deny that you'll be destroyed.
[1:24:46.620 --> 1:24:52.060]  Two info wars best selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.

[1:25:58.380 --> 1:26:04.940]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with your
[1:26:04.940 --> 1:26:10.300]  safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes
[1:26:10.300 --> 1:26:16.620]  up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest band.video.
[1:26:17.260 --> 1:26:22.140]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to
[1:26:22.140 --> 1:26:26.460]  stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override
[1:26:26.460 --> 1:26:31.980]  them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app. So it's up to you
[1:26:31.980 --> 1:26:36.700]  whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook,
[1:26:36.700 --> 1:26:40.860]  on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[1:27:07.260 --> 1:27:13.340]  the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[1:27:13.340 --> 1:27:19.900]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just
[1:27:19.900 --> 1:27:27.100]  like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[1:27:27.100 --> 1:27:32.780]  They're voting for peace on planet earth if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for Hillary,
[1:27:32.780 --> 1:27:40.860]  it's war. We came, we saw, we died. With her, you'll end up in world war three.
[1:27:40.860 --> 1:27:44.620]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[1:27:44.620 --> 1:27:50.540]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war
[1:27:51.260 --> 1:27:58.860]  against Syria and Russia. The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEF CON 2.
[1:27:58.860 --> 1:28:03.660]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action
[1:28:03.660 --> 1:28:08.540]  following unconfirmed reports of further hacking. It's like she's not even concerned about the
[1:28:08.540 --> 1:28:16.460]  repercussions. Of course not because she's really loud noise. All right, looks like we're having a
[1:28:16.460 --> 1:28:20.220]  little bit of technical difficulties. We'll try to get Leigh Ann back on in a few minutes.
[1:28:20.220 --> 1:28:28.380]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[1:28:51.100 --> 1:28:54.540]  November 8th, vote like here. World depends on it.
[1:28:54.540 --> 1:29:18.700]  From the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.
[1:29:24.540 --> 1:29:42.700]  These are the stakes
[1:29:43.900 --> 1:29:49.900]  to make a world in which all of God's children can live or to go into the dark.
[1:29:49.900 --> 1:29:56.220]  We must either love each other or we must die.
[1:29:57.020 --> 1:30:02.380]  Vote for President Johnson on November 3rd. The stakes are too high for you to stay home.
[1:30:03.660 --> 1:30:07.820]  And that was the globalist that sold us out and Barry Goldwater, the patriot against the
[1:30:07.820 --> 1:30:11.660]  New World Order, was kicked out even though he was anti-war. And it's the same thing, Leigh Ann,
[1:30:11.660 --> 1:30:16.700]  a total inversion of reality where Trump's trying to make good deals in these wars,
[1:30:16.700 --> 1:30:20.780]  take care of the troops of the VA, and then he's the warmonger. It's just the left are disgusting
[1:30:20.780 --> 1:30:27.020]  liars. Absolutely. And the fact that Hillary Clinton and others, these globalists, have been
[1:30:27.020 --> 1:30:31.820]  planning to steal this election, they've been planning to say that it's going to drag out for
[1:30:31.820 --> 1:30:36.780]  a long time, they've known that this was going to happen. How did they know? How were they prepared
[1:30:36.780 --> 1:30:41.420]  for this? Why were they telling people that perhaps the House is going to have to decide
[1:30:41.420 --> 1:30:44.700]  who won the election because it's going to drag out for so long or it's going to be
[1:30:44.700 --> 1:30:50.140]  such a close race? I mean, they already knew what was going to happen and they've been getting us
[1:30:50.140 --> 1:30:55.980]  mentally. You always talk about that. The globalists, they always put their plans out
[1:30:55.980 --> 1:30:59.500]  prior to it happening. They have to. It's like a sickness. They have to tell you what they're
[1:30:59.500 --> 1:31:07.020]  going to do. And they have. They have been. Hillary Clinton said Biden should not concede
[1:31:07.020 --> 1:31:12.220]  to President Trump under any circumstances whatsoever because she thinks it's going to drag
[1:31:12.220 --> 1:31:18.060]  out. And eventually she does believe he will win if we do not give an inch. And how is that
[1:31:18.060 --> 1:31:21.660]  going to happen once people are saying right now, Jones, how'd you predict it all again?
[1:31:21.660 --> 1:31:27.180]  I didn't think they had a damn blueprint. Right. I think Jones, be positive. It's a landslide.
[1:31:27.180 --> 1:31:32.300]  Yeah. And they've got a fraud slide to block it. I mean, it's just incredible that they will stop
[1:31:32.300 --> 1:31:38.780]  at nothing to do this. Last night when I was watching the electoral votes being added to
[1:31:38.780 --> 1:31:44.060]  Joe Biden and they gave him California before the polls had even closed in California and everyone
[1:31:44.060 --> 1:31:47.260]  says, Oh, well, it's just a given that they're going to. So, so they would freeze it with him on
[1:31:47.260 --> 1:31:52.300]  top. Right. Exactly. They want to freeze it. It's so transparent. It's so. But meanwhile, they
[1:31:52.300 --> 1:31:57.580]  wouldn't give Trump Texas or any of these other states that, you know, he was over 80,000 votes
[1:31:57.580 --> 1:32:02.380]  or so. Oh, it's still too close to call. You know, meanwhile, they give him Arizona and these
[1:32:02.380 --> 1:32:07.580]  other places. And then they say it was an error in the AP's tallying, but we were watching real
[1:32:07.580 --> 1:32:12.300]  time going, what the heck? They're giving it to Biden when Trump said, by the way, did you guys
[1:32:12.300 --> 1:32:16.940]  find his creepy speech? I saw it last night. Did you find the creepy speech? Oh, gives me the.
[1:32:17.820 --> 1:32:23.260]  You say you did. Yeah, I don't want to listen to his voice, but just roll the video that he was
[1:32:23.260 --> 1:32:29.500]  talking about. He looked animatronic is the word like a Chuck E cheese thing. It sends a
[1:32:29.500 --> 1:32:34.860]  shiver into my soul. I mean, listen, listen, listen, if I was, if I walked into business
[1:32:34.860 --> 1:32:39.180]  and a guy was acting like him and had that with that fake smile, I'd walk right back out. Yeah,
[1:32:39.180 --> 1:32:44.300]  you know, you're talking to a Shicer. He's a used car salesman, you know, trying to sell you
[1:32:44.300 --> 1:32:50.380]  something you don't need at way over price. It's fake charm. Absolute fake charm. And the same
[1:32:50.380 --> 1:32:54.940]  with Kamala Harris, like this is the best the Democrats could roll out for the country. I'll
[1:32:54.940 --> 1:32:58.700]  tell you why the chai comms and others want a weak vessel. Absolutely. They want somebody that
[1:32:58.700 --> 1:33:03.580]  could push her own and they've already pushed him around. They've already bought him out. I hate him.
[1:33:03.580 --> 1:33:09.020]  I mean, look, uh, uh, uh, that kook wife of his, look at what she's wearing. Oh, they're just
[1:33:09.020 --> 1:33:15.100]  disgusting. Yeah. She's like, look at me. Smirking. He's just smirking. Oh, man. Nobody's around me,
[1:33:15.100 --> 1:33:20.300]  but I'm going to wear my white shoe boy globalist club. It just is a parasites on this country.
[1:33:20.300 --> 1:33:24.300]  Couldn't believe that they didn't win the last election. They had the whole plan to topple
[1:33:24.300 --> 1:33:29.980]  our country to take us out. They had already made Americans feel like we suck. We're bad.
[1:33:29.980 --> 1:33:34.460]  You know, we need to take all of these white privilege courses so we can realize how terrible
[1:33:34.460 --> 1:33:40.460]  and awful we are in America was never great. And just really preparing us to, to bend over
[1:33:40.460 --> 1:33:45.500]  to China and whoever you're on, whoever else was going to come in and become the new super power.
[1:33:45.500 --> 1:33:49.740]  And then that, of course, did not happen. President Trump turned things around and,
[1:33:49.740 --> 1:33:53.660]  you know, I still feel like that's their plan. They're like, we got to get this back on track.
[1:33:53.660 --> 1:33:58.220]  But I'll tell you the fact that it is even a bigger landslide, the fact that 95% of Americans,
[1:33:58.220 --> 1:34:01.500]  I mean, if 5% of America was either dumb or psychotic, I'd be ashamed.
[1:34:02.060 --> 1:34:06.940]  Let me tell you a good 30, 40% are followers. They actually believe he's a Nazi. Okay. I mean,
[1:34:06.940 --> 1:34:10.940]  these are idiots. And, and the fact is we've been such an open, free, wealthy country.
[1:34:10.940 --> 1:34:13.980]  They're a lot of lazy, stupid people because they've never lived in the real world.
[1:34:13.980 --> 1:34:17.500]  And then they just, they're idiots. Right. I mean, these are the same people that are like,
[1:34:17.500 --> 1:34:23.260]  no, anti-foss stands for anti-fascist. So even though they're using fascist tactics,
[1:34:23.260 --> 1:34:26.940]  they're fighting fascism. And look, they do a drive-in thing because of COVID. They keep the
[1:34:26.940 --> 1:34:31.020]  whole fraud going. I mean, because they have such small numbers. I mean, these people are sick.
[1:34:31.020 --> 1:34:33.340]  Yeah. Oh, look, punch up the Georgia satellite feet.
[1:34:33.340 --> 1:34:36.380]  They said, how do you know a Biden rally? It's because it's a parking lot of empty.
[1:34:38.380 --> 1:34:42.060]  Let me ask you this question. If they're able to steal the election, which they're damn well
[1:34:42.060 --> 1:34:45.020]  going to try them, they keep these things open. They've got a limited 80 million ballots all
[1:34:45.020 --> 1:34:49.020]  stocked up in warehouses. They keep, they're flooded. They've been arresting people,
[1:34:49.020 --> 1:34:54.620]  catching them. The news hardly carries it. If, if they steal it, or if Trump challenges the
[1:34:54.620 --> 1:34:59.020]  steal, then they just act like people to burn the cities down. I mean, this is a disaster.
[1:34:59.020 --> 1:35:02.780]  And that's why they're saying there could potentially be a civil war, because they've
[1:35:02.780 --> 1:35:08.380]  already got their little Antifa troops and others out ready to fight, ready to contest the election,
[1:35:08.380 --> 1:35:13.580]  ready to say that it's illegitimate. But what happens when the Patriots finally decide?
[1:35:13.580 --> 1:35:18.700]  Yeah, because they want to piss on our grave. When we finally say, no, absolutely not. This
[1:35:18.700 --> 1:35:23.180]  is illegitimate. We know you've stolen it. And we've seen it. We've got it on video. This is
[1:35:23.180 --> 1:35:26.540]  why they don't want you to take your video, any video cameras or have any of the poll
[1:35:26.540 --> 1:35:33.020]  watchers in there, seeing how the machines are broken. Oh, a pipe burst. Oh, you know, we, we,
[1:35:33.020 --> 1:35:38.700]  we can't have any, come back later and we'll put your ballot in. I promise. I promise. Or
[1:35:38.700 --> 1:35:43.260]  throwing, throwing away a bunch of votes that were for President Trump. And that's the scary part
[1:35:43.260 --> 1:35:48.140]  is they've converted the corruption at the top of the Democratic Party and they've gotten a large
[1:35:48.140 --> 1:35:54.460]  portion of their followers to be pro war, pro death, pro abortion, pro pedophilia. They'll just
[1:35:54.460 --> 1:36:00.700]  sign on to anything now. And that's what's so dangerous is that Democrats are like a criminal
[1:36:00.700 --> 1:36:06.940]  mob now. Right. And how powerful was that that they could just point the finger at one man,
[1:36:06.940 --> 1:36:12.780]  President Trump and put all the blames and all the ills of all the world on him and that the
[1:36:12.780 --> 1:36:19.020]  solution to all of our problems, it will, will arrive when we get him out of office. Then everything
[1:36:19.020 --> 1:36:23.340]  is going to be wonderful and great again. Don't look at the fact that Joe Biden's been in office
[1:36:23.340 --> 1:36:28.540]  47 years and was the vice president and is a compromised Chinese agent. And he was, you know,
[1:36:28.540 --> 1:36:33.020]  didn't fix the things while he had the chance. But believe me, he's going to this time around.
[1:36:33.020 --> 1:36:36.220]  Yeah. So what happens if they we're going to come back and talk about that and play some more
[1:36:36.220 --> 1:36:39.180]  clubs? So much happening. I'm going to give a number later. We got a special guest joining us
[1:36:39.180 --> 1:36:44.140]  as well. Land Macadoo is in studio. Tell folks about the live feeds and ban our video. You're
[1:36:44.140 --> 1:36:51.100]  the way to start hunts. Election 2020 is here. And whether Trump wins or loses, we have all won
[1:36:51.100 --> 1:36:56.060]  by exposing the common Chinese, by exposing the globalist, by exposing the pedophile rings,
[1:36:56.620 --> 1:37:02.300]  by exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil. I'm personally a
[1:37:02.300 --> 1:37:06.140]  Christian and I believe in God and I know God's real and I've experienced it in my life.
[1:37:06.140 --> 1:37:10.300]  But even you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is good in this world.
[1:37:10.300 --> 1:37:14.700]  There is evil. There are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing that.
[1:37:15.500 --> 1:37:21.420]  And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally get
[1:37:21.420 --> 1:37:26.860]  that. They finally understand that they're not being naive anymore. Don't ever project your
[1:37:26.860 --> 1:37:32.860]  decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what they stand for and who they
[1:37:32.860 --> 1:37:36.780]  are or you're going to get hurt. But those of you out there have done your own research and
[1:37:36.780 --> 1:37:41.180]  discovered who's good and who is faithful will then come together with those organizations and
[1:37:41.180 --> 1:37:48.140]  support them like Info Wars. Without your support, Info Wars would not exist. Info Wars has been
[1:37:48.140 --> 1:37:54.460]  reporting on the dark unpleasant truths of big government corruption for over two decades.
[1:37:54.460 --> 1:38:00.780]  It is why they attack us. And it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.
[1:38:00.780 --> 1:38:05.900]  The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[1:38:06.620 --> 1:38:12.220]  Evil has infested governments everywhere. But the evil establishment is censoring content
[1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:19.820]  across all media platforms. They blocked you from sharing banned.video on social media. So go to

[1:40:46.540 --> 1:40:58.380]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:16.860 --> 1:41:24.540]  so there's trump winning florida bigger than last time there's trump winning texas
[1:41:25.500 --> 1:41:29.660]  and he clearly was projected to win those other states so they froze it so the magic
[1:41:29.660 --> 1:41:36.300]  balance could come in which violates the previous law supreme court back in october 28th virtue
[1:41:36.300 --> 1:41:41.740]  signaled and said no we're gonna let these things stay open and so uh trumps put in his faith in
[1:41:41.740 --> 1:41:45.740]  supreme court either the supreme court you know people need to be rallying outside the supreme
[1:41:45.740 --> 1:41:49.020]  court we need to be rallying outside the white house and not just let the communists run around
[1:41:49.020 --> 1:41:52.620]  the streets and you know claim that they have the moral high ground we are negative absolutely
[1:41:52.620 --> 1:41:57.260]  and i think that was you know part of the psychological decision last night to shut
[1:41:57.260 --> 1:42:02.380]  the the electoral vote tally keep it frozen where it's showing joe biden with the majority
[1:42:02.380 --> 1:42:06.380]  because of course they gave him california very early in the night even though the polls hadn't
[1:42:06.380 --> 1:42:13.260]  closed in california meanwhile they didn't give trump texas under that same sort of theory that
[1:42:13.260 --> 1:42:18.380]  it would just most likely go to him too close to call we can't give him texas yet so i think that
[1:42:18.380 --> 1:42:24.700]  was a psychological thing also probably kind of holding out hope that if they were to shut down
[1:42:24.700 --> 1:42:30.700]  the east coast states from tallying all their votes that maybe joe biden would be able to
[1:42:30.700 --> 1:42:36.700]  clench the 270 electoral votes once all the west coast states came in yeah that's the plan by the
[1:42:36.700 --> 1:42:42.700]  way for tv viewers radio listeners back up biden last night notice it's sponsored by general motors
[1:42:42.700 --> 1:42:48.460]  that obama bailed out with taxpayer money and it's all jeeps with his campaign people it's even
[1:42:48.460 --> 1:42:54.300]  fake they even have fake groups of cars it's just everything is synthetic everything is garbage the
[1:42:54.300 --> 1:42:59.740]  whole thing looks like you're on a movie set like you're you know you're in hollywood at the mgm
[1:42:59.740 --> 1:43:04.380]  studios or something and it's all sort of set up for this and i just zoom in on that woman's
[1:43:04.380 --> 1:43:12.780]  face smiling and look it's all jeeps it's a jeep commercial spot spot wow brand new jeeps perfectly
[1:43:12.780 --> 1:43:17.980]  detailed they're perfectly shiny perfectly separated i mean everything is choreographed bs
[1:43:18.540 --> 1:43:22.780]  they're like showing off the chinese like look we can have parades too yeah like you know the nazis
[1:43:22.780 --> 1:43:28.220]  had all those parades it's it's sick it's sick wow yeah i didn't even notice that talk about just
[1:43:28.220 --> 1:43:33.660]  just it's all you're programmed we're programmed everything is ordered everything is the only thing
[1:43:33.660 --> 1:43:39.020]  of course it's american flags they hate the very existence of the country right well and and the
[1:43:39.020 --> 1:43:44.860]  more that i see the news anchors the msm taking off their masks and showing who they really are it
[1:43:44.860 --> 1:43:50.460]  it really makes me feel like i'm i'm in they live and at any moment we're going to see them morphing
[1:43:50.460 --> 1:43:55.820]  into those skeleton i've got one that can see exactly i mean that's what i feel like we're in
[1:43:55.820 --> 1:44:00.540]  right now it's very spiritual like you must cover yourself we cover ourselves right right and that
[1:44:00.540 --> 1:44:04.860]  is like a cult means covered right and that's the dark and the light and and that's even how
[1:44:04.860 --> 1:44:10.940]  they're trying to hide information they're they're hiding your ability to access the truth they are
[1:44:10.940 --> 1:44:16.780]  they're covering and hiding anyone who tries to have a dissenting voice that's because that's like
[1:44:16.780 --> 1:44:23.100]  Darth Vader wears a mask i mean it's it's it's very archetypal mm-hmm darkness and silencing
[1:44:23.100 --> 1:44:29.260]  and hiding uh that's their power that's what they have and so the light is really that's like the
[1:44:29.260 --> 1:44:33.980]  silent majority people need to be speaking up now they need to be sharing the sharing the
[1:44:33.980 --> 1:44:38.220]  what do you think are qanon i love the qanon followers they're good people they're researching
[1:44:38.220 --> 1:44:42.940]  they're fighting the same enemy but they follow this esoteric stuff and and and believe everything's
[1:44:42.940 --> 1:44:47.820]  okay now back when qanon was staying your basements the media loved it once it once good people took
[1:44:47.820 --> 1:44:52.380]  it over they hated it i just hope people understand that you know you're the secret army folks there's
[1:44:52.380 --> 1:44:56.540]  not a secret army out there fighting for you let me just tell you right yeah i mean i've literally
[1:44:56.540 --> 1:45:00.380]  had the president tell me press the attack jones you're one of few we've got get as many recuders
[1:45:00.380 --> 1:45:04.460]  you can we need help and i'm like and i talk you know people like oh you got you didn't talk to him
[1:45:04.460 --> 1:45:10.060]  i mean q's above the president right right well and i think a lot of that too is you have you have
[1:45:10.060 --> 1:45:14.380]  your instincts and a lot of people are they're feeling a certain way about things and then it's
[1:45:14.380 --> 1:45:19.260]  like oh no no no just trust the plan trust the plan and so you're like well no i i kind of want to
[1:45:19.260 --> 1:45:23.980]  trust my instincts and my gut on there something's not right well trust the plan and like look where
[1:45:23.980 --> 1:45:29.020]  we're at now whenever it first came out i mean i don't really follow q that much so i don't have a
[1:45:29.020 --> 1:45:33.980]  very strong opinion about it but i just thought what a way to manipulate people i mean i don't want
[1:45:33.980 --> 1:45:39.420]  a name drop i can call any of the big top fox news host right now they'll answer i'd call joe
[1:45:39.420 --> 1:45:43.340]  rogan answer i can call i want to talk to trump i'm gonna call me within a day and then it's like
[1:45:43.340 --> 1:45:49.500]  oh jones you i'm a proven entity okay i talked to trump's main people i could pick up the phone
[1:45:49.500 --> 1:45:53.100]  right now and call this personal lawyer that's how we talk i'm gonna leave it at that okay i mean
[1:45:53.100 --> 1:45:57.340]  one of his main lawyers you might have heard of them but the point is is that it's not about
[1:45:57.340 --> 1:46:01.980]  name dropping this is real and they say we're in desperate straits and that they don't want to
[1:46:01.980 --> 1:46:05.260]  scare the public how much trouble we're in how there's chinese agents everywhere okay you heard
[1:46:05.260 --> 1:46:09.820]  caputo come out and say that i mean i'm just telling you to directly talking to the president
[1:46:09.820 --> 1:46:14.220]  we're in trouble folks he doesn't want to scare you too much and then i hear oh everything's fine
[1:46:14.220 --> 1:46:19.340]  no it's not it's not it's not okay it's not all right no it's absolutely not all right this is
[1:46:19.340 --> 1:46:24.460]  like this is this is absolutely a war right now we talk about the the war between the dark and the
[1:46:24.460 --> 1:46:29.100]  light and it's it's in our face which is why i think the amish rallied around and they said you
[1:46:29.100 --> 1:46:33.260]  know they they know it's like they they try to stay out of politics and live in their own little
[1:46:33.260 --> 1:46:38.940]  their own and let's explain what a war is i mean it it's existential if you're in the world war one
[1:46:38.940 --> 1:46:43.100]  trench warfare you know the old-fashioned lineup against the enemy and somebody's walking around
[1:46:43.100 --> 1:46:46.780]  going we're winning everything's fine don't keep your eyes peeled don't fight hard don't keep your
[1:46:46.780 --> 1:46:51.260]  head down you know that person's a damn agent i mean you let you get arrested like that be court
[1:46:51.260 --> 1:46:57.500]  marshal right that's what i'm saying this is classic scyop folks right the provocateurs trust the
[1:46:57.500 --> 1:47:03.020]  plan don't you know it's just well one of the things that i was really proud to see they had to
[1:47:03.020 --> 1:47:07.980]  call florida so early last night at the 2016 remember florida was the one it dragged out all
[1:47:07.980 --> 1:47:11.660]  night long because we had to wait for crooked broward county to come in and see if they were
[1:47:11.660 --> 1:47:15.740]  going to swing it so what are you predicting if they're able to install by uh what do they do
[1:47:15.740 --> 1:47:20.380]  replacing with harris who who who depends on the vice president well it it's got to be here that's
[1:47:20.380 --> 1:47:25.420]  why they're already you know but biden's already saying you think i'm you think it's not a harris
[1:47:25.420 --> 1:47:29.580]  biden administration she's going to be the next president i mean he's our and her husband says my
[1:47:29.580 --> 1:47:34.460]  wife should be the next president yeah and and how ridiculous is that because even the democrats
[1:47:34.460 --> 1:47:40.540]  voters did not like her when she was you know being promoted as a potential they rejected her
[1:47:40.540 --> 1:47:45.900]  they rejected her and then they chose her in the end and even people still don't why does the
[1:47:45.900 --> 1:47:50.300]  establishment love someone she's even more disingenuous that biden which is hard to do right
[1:47:50.300 --> 1:47:54.940]  but that just that just lets you know that she's going to just come out and be this friendly face
[1:47:54.940 --> 1:48:00.700]  and she's a woman and nobody can nobody can question her and if if you do then you're just a sexist
[1:48:00.700 --> 1:48:06.140]  misogynist part of the patriarchy you know but really it's she doesn't have any power she doesn't
[1:48:06.140 --> 1:48:11.100]  have any enthusiasm she doesn't i would love to have a pro america powerful woman i i love it
[1:48:11.100 --> 1:48:14.460]  i mean you i have daughters but it was never even before i had daughters it wasn't like i don't want
[1:48:14.460 --> 1:48:18.860]  women in charge of things i just want women and men in charge of things that got the right stuff
[1:48:18.860 --> 1:48:23.100]  she's not going to be in charge she's going to be a happy little she's a total puppet she'll do
[1:48:23.100 --> 1:48:29.020]  whatever it takes she's she's just happy a little smile along and when the news anchor you know asked
[1:48:29.020 --> 1:48:36.460]  her was that a socialist agenda oh no not me i don't we wouldn't be doing that behind the scenes
[1:48:36.460 --> 1:48:42.540]  and they just laugh right in your face at you and try to make you doubt your instincts and doubt
[1:48:42.540 --> 1:48:49.100]  your gut and to see what's happening but but miami cubans who are a lot of them exiled from cuba
[1:48:49.100 --> 1:48:53.820]  they know what's happening they see the writing on the wall and other hispanics have been from
[1:48:53.820 --> 1:48:58.940]  socialist countries like venezuela absolutely and a lot of those people live in florida and so
[1:48:59.580 --> 1:49:04.780]  the democrats are saying oh well you know trump just won him because he just focused so much on
[1:49:04.780 --> 1:49:09.980]  state on message that it's you know socialism socialism socialism well trump stayed on that
[1:49:09.980 --> 1:49:13.820]  message because that's what's happening because hey guys under communism which is it really
[1:49:13.820 --> 1:49:18.860]  segues into communism right everything's free but you can't get anything right everything's free
[1:49:18.860 --> 1:49:22.940]  you get a free car when you went on a wedding less 10 years maybe everything's free but you
[1:49:22.940 --> 1:49:27.500]  don't have any parts for your car so you got to use a plastic coke bottle you know as you're
[1:49:27.500 --> 1:49:32.620]  exhaust or something because you can't get any new parts for it's like and i look at harris every
[1:49:32.620 --> 1:49:39.740]  photo every video it's he's the most disingenuous fraud i mean look at this person people who like
[1:49:39.740 --> 1:49:46.860]  maniacally laugh at everything even when it's like a serious she thinks that that laugh makes her
[1:49:46.860 --> 1:49:52.700]  approachable because she's a psychotic she's a psychotic like when you laugh maniacally at things
[1:49:52.700 --> 1:49:57.820]  that when inappropriate times i mean that's just weird what's she gonna be laughing when she goes
[1:49:57.820 --> 1:50:02.220]  it's all she does he's just walking on cackling she's like here iran here's some more pallets of
[1:50:02.220 --> 1:50:08.700]  cash he don't you know don't bomb us or we're gonna but i mean this is what traders look like
[1:50:08.700 --> 1:50:13.980]  this is what the chikoms had to get so we wonder why they look like sacks of garbage they are yeah
[1:50:13.980 --> 1:50:21.180]  yeah i mean it's like they can't even really hide their kind of putrid evil that just seeps out from
[1:50:21.180 --> 1:50:27.340]  them where people who are good aware awake when they look you in the eye and make that little
[1:50:27.340 --> 1:50:31.900]  smile like you sense it you sense that you're in the presence of evil that you're in the presence
[1:50:31.900 --> 1:50:37.660]  of darkness that you're being taken advantage of but so many people don't have that sensibility
[1:50:37.660 --> 1:50:41.340]  about it once they go under evil they might not be evil but a lot of people i know get scared when
[1:50:41.340 --> 1:50:44.780]  you're real with your genuine they get scared by that right they've never had anybody be genuine to
[1:50:44.780 --> 1:50:49.660]  them so they think that's weird right and a lot of people they've been they've been so
[1:50:49.660 --> 1:50:54.140]  gaslit by the media for so many years that they don't even trust their own instincts they don't
[1:50:54.140 --> 1:50:59.100]  trust themselves they're like oh well dr. fauchy said it doesn't really make sense about the mask
[1:50:59.100 --> 1:51:04.540]  but dr. fauchy said you know and the cdc keeps changing now we know almost all the despectral
[1:51:04.540 --> 1:51:08.700]  pneumonia we're right back with leanne macadoo another special guest so much we're gonna go
[1:51:08.700 --> 1:51:13.020]  in live until late tonight this is the 79 days of hell i don't know if it'll go that long until
[1:51:13.020 --> 1:51:17.420]  inauguration but the democrats say that's their plan try to steal the election night that's
[1:51:17.420 --> 1:51:21.820]  failed so they're gonna hold it up try to stuff all the ballots and and and then and then just
[1:51:21.820 --> 1:51:28.380]  have a secession and total hell on earth so stay with us 79 days dot news 79 days this is a new site
[1:51:28.380 --> 1:51:32.620]  they should be a dot video to circumvent the censors 79 79 days
[1:51:32.620 --> 1:51:40.860]  the controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation or government that'll
[1:51:40.860 --> 1:51:46.700]  pay them it's that simple and they'd use our open free society against us the controlled media will
[1:51:46.700 --> 1:51:51.740]  talk about a few mistakes i've made over the years and obsess over it they see he's a liar on purpose
[1:51:51.740 --> 1:51:57.580]  even though our success rate our accuracy rate is way way better than theirs we try to tell the truth
[1:51:57.580 --> 1:52:02.860]  they tried a lot i tried to see i'm trying to get people to realize that the globalist operate how
[1:52:02.860 --> 1:52:09.660]  they manipulate how they bamboozle the public i'm trying to get the public to ask questions and
[1:52:09.660 --> 1:52:15.580]  do not believe what they're told in the face i'm trying to get people to research for themselves
[1:52:16.300 --> 1:52:21.500]  the globalists and their controlled corporate press say that researching and not trusting media is
[1:52:21.500 --> 1:52:27.980]  evil and as a conspiracy theory well again on its face that is a fraud question everything question
[1:52:27.980 --> 1:52:32.220]  info wars add your own research to it and then decide what you're going to promote to others
[1:52:32.220 --> 1:52:35.740]  and what news sources are accurate i believe info wars is the best source out there
[1:52:38.140 --> 1:52:46.300]  it's all on record yale harvard princeton stanford they were all hired a year ago and then
[1:52:46.300 --> 1:52:52.060]  against six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic
[1:52:52.060 --> 1:52:57.500]  and how to get the public to take inoculations and they talk about calling people heroes that do it
[1:52:57.500 --> 1:53:01.740]  they talk about shaming those that don't this has all been psychologically tested
[1:53:02.860 --> 1:53:07.420]  it's all been psychologically prepared and once they get you to lock down for 15 days you notice
[1:53:07.420 --> 1:53:12.700]  now they say it's permanent that's how it works oh just put these handcuffs on the serial killer
[1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:17.980]  says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right no now we've already put the
[1:53:17.980 --> 1:53:24.700]  handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van he's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly
[1:53:24.700 --> 1:53:30.060]  torture us to death that's the allegory we gotta bust out of this thing now we gotta say no now
[1:53:30.060 --> 1:53:34.700]  we gotta make a run for it now but we still can't once he gets us in that basement it's gonna get a
[1:53:34.700 --> 1:53:43.020]  lot a lot worse folks so stop submitting you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:43.020 --> 1:53:51.340]  oh
[1:54:01.100 --> 1:54:05.340]  well i'm very excited at lean in mackley right shotgun brothers we have a very special guest
[1:54:05.340 --> 1:54:12.060]  coming up at the start of the next segment chad braither and we're gonna be breaking down the
[1:54:12.060 --> 1:54:16.860]  election get his really informative and interesting take on things lean you got a bunch of their
[1:54:16.860 --> 1:54:20.940]  articles there what else is on your radar well i mean i'm just i cannot believe that we are
[1:54:20.940 --> 1:54:26.460]  allowing social media to censor our ability to question the results of an election i mean
[1:54:26.460 --> 1:54:34.140]  they're still actively censoring anyone who dares question the results in wisconsin michigan i mean
[1:54:34.140 --> 1:54:40.540]  it's it's just where are we headed i mean i'm hoping that after this election we can just see a huge
[1:54:40.540 --> 1:54:46.780]  exodus from twitter facebook and these other social media sites that are are trying to control us
[1:54:46.780 --> 1:54:52.060]  and sifal our ability to communicate with each other and communicate the truth and get access
[1:54:52.060 --> 1:54:57.100]  to information i mean this is boy didn't trump drop the ball though i'm not stopping big tech
[1:54:57.100 --> 1:55:02.540]  he was too damn confident with that with that par scale idiot yeah i agree on that and there was um
[1:55:03.180 --> 1:55:07.980]  you know i think we just also have a lot of people in charge who have no idea how the internet
[1:55:07.980 --> 1:55:12.940]  even works and you know they don't know how to ask the right questions and then you have these um
[1:55:12.940 --> 1:55:18.540]  that the tech gods go in and they they basically just give as little information as possible and
[1:55:18.540 --> 1:55:23.420]  laugh because they're not even being asked the proper questions that allow them to skirt around
[1:55:23.420 --> 1:55:30.060]  those laws and um you know it's just it's kind of scary and we're we're having people actively
[1:55:30.060 --> 1:55:35.580]  voting for the prison planet they're they're spelling it all out palantir is trying to work
[1:55:35.580 --> 1:55:40.140]  with the track and trace you know with foreign governments it's just the writing is on the
[1:55:40.140 --> 1:55:45.100]  wall you've been telling us about this for 20 plus years now and we're here we're here and again
[1:55:45.100 --> 1:55:49.500]  there's so many fake ideologies by designed to confuse people i'm going directly to club of
[1:55:49.500 --> 1:55:55.660]  roam directly to cfr directly today of us directly to bill deberg i mean one time i was covering
[1:55:55.660 --> 1:55:59.820]  bill deberg like 12 years ago in virginia and a guy just pulls up on a motorcycle and goes
[1:55:59.820 --> 1:56:05.420]  here i work for a dead u.s senator and archive he's dead now here's 500 pages of secret documents
[1:56:05.420 --> 1:56:10.140]  and it was all how we're gonna bankrupt america how we're gonna take control how we're gonna take
[1:56:10.140 --> 1:56:15.260]  over the unions how we're gonna sell out to china in the 80s this is all secret agreements and we
[1:56:15.260 --> 1:56:21.820]  posted on info wars and people are like i mean it's like death star plans man that it should be game
[1:56:21.820 --> 1:56:26.700]  over just those right it's just it's it's so unbelievable that people they just cannot wrap
[1:56:26.700 --> 1:56:32.060]  their heads around it and that's why they want to go and listen to you know the news media that
[1:56:32.060 --> 1:56:37.340]  that tells them what they want to hear and and tells them or even like traps them and locks
[1:56:37.340 --> 1:56:42.940]  them in this fear mode whenever i got the covid and i was you know quarantining and staying home
[1:56:43.820 --> 1:56:49.820]  being a good little citizen my neighbor came out and i told him that i was i was getting out of
[1:56:49.820 --> 1:56:53.820]  quarantine whatever and i said oh yeah well i had it i've been in my house for a couple weeks you
[1:56:53.820 --> 1:57:00.380]  know he he never would have known if i hadn't told him but i did and he's like oh just get away
[1:57:00.380 --> 1:57:06.380]  i'll die if i get it i'll die if i get it and he's like this very healthy person he then is sick
[1:57:06.380 --> 1:57:11.420]  they get into the fear and the selfishness like being into fear gives them a value wearing a mask
[1:57:11.420 --> 1:57:15.660]  even though they care about themselves they check the statistics and find out it's like a bad flu
[1:57:15.660 --> 1:57:22.060]  right and maybe yeah they don't care about the 99.98 percent survival rate they don't care about that
[1:57:22.060 --> 1:57:27.820]  they they want to feel important it gives them this like camaraderie a sense of standing a sense
[1:57:27.820 --> 1:57:32.460]  of standing like like you're a plaintiff in a case like i'm i'm i'm i'm a i'm a hero going through
[1:57:32.460 --> 1:57:36.060]  all this right now meanwhile you're destroying generations of wealth starving the third world
[1:57:36.060 --> 1:57:39.660]  to death it's a total scam and you just bought into it being a chump you're not part of the
[1:57:39.660 --> 1:57:45.100]  winning team you're called a schmuck a sucker a dumbass an idiot right you're like literally
[1:57:45.100 --> 1:57:50.060]  guzzling on a big gulp and then you're like scared of you know catching something that's less deadly
[1:57:50.060 --> 1:57:55.580]  than the flu oh it's gonna kill me like oh i'll die if i get it like really dude that's your
[1:57:55.580 --> 1:58:01.580]  mentality that the news has told you what happened to america we ran a hyped up virus they all ran
[1:58:01.580 --> 1:58:07.820]  their houses and the world collapsed how did you get to be so old and be so stupid that's what i want

[2:00:25.100 --> 2:00:32.380]  they're on youtube well my friend uh we talked months ago about the fraud about their plan they
[2:00:32.380 --> 2:00:37.180]  were public about it then you've been talking about it so many others and i wish we weren't
[2:00:37.180 --> 2:00:42.540]  the few the proud we're like jones it's gonna be a landslide relax and i'm like well the democrats
[2:00:42.540 --> 2:00:46.380]  aren't wargaming this for no reason and getting all this lined up and then preparing all the
[2:00:46.380 --> 2:00:50.780]  censorship so uh they intend to steal this from the american people let's talk about what you
[2:00:50.780 --> 2:00:56.300]  think's gonna unfold what your takeaway is and then what happens if trump does get back in
[2:00:56.300 --> 2:01:02.220]  both of you versus what if they actually put that crazy man in there and my sick part of my mind
[2:01:02.220 --> 2:01:05.900]  sees even bigger defeat for the globalist if they actually take trump from us what do you think
[2:01:07.660 --> 2:01:12.860]  isn't it interesting that we spent time over these last months even this last year telling them
[2:01:12.860 --> 2:01:17.020]  telling the american public this is what they were going to do this is what was going to happen
[2:01:17.020 --> 2:01:22.460]  and they called us idiots they called us liars they called us fake news they called us frauds
[2:01:23.020 --> 2:01:29.180]  we were conspiracy theorists and then they turn around and they do it and now when we call them
[2:01:29.180 --> 2:01:33.500]  out for doing it they want to call us all the same names again we just can't accept loss
[2:01:34.060 --> 2:01:39.420]  we just can't take defeat all these different things uh we know that it's there look if joe
[2:01:39.420 --> 2:01:44.140]  biden were to win this election fair and square that would be fine that would be one thing tip of
[2:01:44.140 --> 2:01:49.820]  the cap to him move on down the road let's make america the best we can but you can't convince me
[2:01:49.820 --> 2:01:54.940]  alex that this man won this election or will win this election fair and square without some kind of
[2:01:54.940 --> 2:01:59.740]  fraudulent dealings that are going on and then the frauds everywhere it's ridiculous it's it's
[2:01:59.740 --> 2:02:06.700]  everywhere i mean i put on i put on twitter this morning i said hey i just found 200 000 michigan
[2:02:06.700 --> 2:02:14.140]  ballots for trump uh does that sound believable to anyone but yet they wanted to fend this idea
[2:02:14.140 --> 2:02:20.700]  that somewhere out there there were you know 138 139 000 ballots for joe biden in michigan that
[2:02:21.260 --> 2:02:25.100]  then zero for trump that doesn't make sense to me i've got it right here in one of the states
[2:02:25.660 --> 2:02:31.260]  100 percent of registered democrats voted for biden that's impossible 100 percent oh we just found
[2:02:31.260 --> 2:02:35.420]  all these ballots and they're all for joe biden gotta count them i've got it right here i mean i
[2:02:35.420 --> 2:02:39.180]  saw that this morning and twitter didn't believe it i wouldn't pull all the numbers it's true i'll
[2:02:39.180 --> 2:02:42.860]  pull it in a minute just crazy yeah all the count all the ballots we don't need to check and make
[2:02:42.860 --> 2:02:48.540]  sure they're legal ballots we got these democrat judges saying we don't need signature verification
[2:02:48.540 --> 2:02:52.540]  address verification these things are literally just coming out of warehouses you know what's going
[2:02:52.540 --> 2:02:57.900]  to stop them chat it's going to be patriots in the battleground states everybody's got to do this
[2:02:57.900 --> 2:03:01.420]  folks i've got guys about to do it i'm actually i'm gonna tell what i'm gonna do we need people to
[2:03:01.420 --> 2:03:05.580]  stake out these key polling places and key areas and follow folks around this is coming
[2:03:05.580 --> 2:03:09.180]  down to just us doing it what do you think yeah there's got to be some accountability
[2:03:09.180 --> 2:03:15.340]  somewhere doesn't there uh you i mean i can file my taxes online i can do every major thing that
[2:03:15.340 --> 2:03:21.580]  that is required for me to do in my life online through the internet uh and i trust that process
[2:03:21.580 --> 2:03:26.620]  but yet i got kathy who's going to give me a scantron and a pencil and i'm supposed to
[2:03:26.620 --> 2:03:33.260]  uh trust you know ted who's farsighted to count these things uh it's insane this process that
[2:03:33.260 --> 2:03:38.220]  we've got they've had ballots this election's been going on for months already with mail-ins with
[2:03:38.220 --> 2:03:43.340]  absentees they should have already had all of this crap counted and here we are here's our situation
[2:03:43.340 --> 2:03:47.100]  and now we're gonna say well we we're gonna need more days we're gonna need more months you're
[2:03:47.100 --> 2:03:50.780]  right well it's time to fight back i mean that's the that's the area right there that really pisses
[2:03:50.780 --> 2:03:56.300]  me off is we've rolled over and we've taken it over and over again and that's what we're gonna
[2:03:56.300 --> 2:04:02.860]  do again and again until ultimately we're gonna look just like venezuela uh i mean what what are
[2:04:02.860 --> 2:04:07.340]  we looking forward to the most the bread lines or the gulags because that's where we're headed
[2:04:07.340 --> 2:04:13.180]  with with kamala harris who's gonna be president in six months if joe biden wins this election
[2:04:13.740 --> 2:04:18.060]  and by the way you're right we're going to be venezuela most these blue cities are i've been
[2:04:18.060 --> 2:04:23.660]  there they look and act like venezuela right i mean the whole covet thing was sort of a preparation
[2:04:23.660 --> 2:04:29.100]  to get us ready for the bread lines because so many people they're if they're continued to be
[2:04:29.100 --> 2:04:33.100]  shut down in their states they're they're gonna need it they're gonna need that handout and by the
[2:04:33.100 --> 2:04:38.460]  way the debauchery would have said that they're like oh this will teach us to be poor chad yeah
[2:04:38.460 --> 2:04:43.740]  yeah leah is exactly right this covet thing has has trained us right it's made us into sheep it's
[2:04:43.740 --> 2:04:49.900]  it's made us bow down at the altar of safetyism the mask is our talisman uh and and you know who's
[2:04:49.900 --> 2:04:55.820]  a part of the cult based on the mask wears and the fear fear is collateral they can spend that
[2:04:55.820 --> 2:05:00.060]  and the more they can make you fear and afraid for your life they can control you and that's
[2:05:00.060 --> 2:05:04.700]  exactly what they've done so they've they've they've socially distanced us they've put us behind
[2:05:04.700 --> 2:05:09.420]  plexiglass they've made our transactions different they've shut our businesses down they've killed
[2:05:09.420 --> 2:05:15.500]  an economy so that now when we we turn around and we're looking for a stimulus check to show up every
[2:05:15.500 --> 2:05:20.700]  month uh then what is going to be is now we're on the government cheese we're on the government
[2:05:20.700 --> 2:05:27.260]  bread we're on the government uh tits so to speak constantly looking for now they can dictate
[2:05:27.260 --> 2:05:32.380]  now they can exactly now they can dictate the the terms of our surrender yeah how do we break free
[2:05:32.380 --> 2:05:38.700]  of that chad pray they're in leah and maggot it you know at some point in time we got to stand up
[2:05:38.700 --> 2:05:43.180]  and let our voices be heard and unfortunately we've we've picked the wrong platforms to do that
[2:05:43.180 --> 2:05:48.940]  twitter facebook uh all of these social media platforms youtube google we've picked the wrong
[2:05:48.940 --> 2:05:53.020]  platforms uh we're gonna have to take to the streets we're gonna have to stand up we're gonna
[2:05:53.020 --> 2:05:58.380]  have to be vocal i'm sick of seeing riots from antifa and blm i'm tired of seeing this nonsense
[2:05:58.380 --> 2:06:02.620]  without anybody fighting back i'm not advocating for violence but at some point in time you got
[2:06:02.620 --> 2:06:08.220]  to pick a fight and you got to take it to the street uh we're about to say is that they attack
[2:06:08.220 --> 2:06:12.620]  our vehicles and stuff and i just got to the point where i'm not looking for a fight but
[2:06:12.620 --> 2:06:16.460]  next time we usually retreat in a certain point it's time to beat the living hell out of these
[2:06:16.460 --> 2:06:23.100]  people i'm sorry go ahead well i you know what i came into the studio and i'm not i'm like you
[2:06:23.100 --> 2:06:26.780]  you guys are you're burning the midnight oil i mean you guys are burning the candle at both ends
[2:06:26.780 --> 2:06:29.980]  i know you're tired we're tired we were here till three o'clock in the morning we're going to
[2:06:29.980 --> 2:06:35.580]  continue to be here every day as well and you know i i came locked and loaded man i came into the
[2:06:35.580 --> 2:06:40.140]  studio uh with my go bag ready to go i didn't know what i was going to encounter in the streets of
[2:06:40.140 --> 2:06:43.740]  dallas on my way home last night in the middle of the night i didn't know what i was going to see
[2:06:43.740 --> 2:06:46.940]  i should that's not my america that's not the america i want to live in and that's not the
[2:06:46.940 --> 2:06:50.620]  america i'm going to live in and they're gonna they're going to pick on the wrong people they
[2:06:50.620 --> 2:06:55.900]  keep going after these elderly suburban nights who are i'm sorry urbanites who are already unarmed
[2:06:55.900 --> 2:07:00.540]  and can be bullied and pushed around and they're going to push too far on the wrong people sit down
[2:07:00.540 --> 2:07:04.700]  at the wrong damn table and that's when it's going to start it's going to be like that and he found
[2:07:04.700 --> 2:07:09.420]  austin he said these people are wimps i'm going to go intimidate them they won't do anything and he
[2:07:09.420 --> 2:07:14.140]  goes up and points a gun at an army veteran uh decorated combat vet and the guy kills him well
[2:07:14.140 --> 2:07:19.020]  what do you expect he's dead 10 minutes after he says these people are wimps they'll never push back
[2:07:19.020 --> 2:07:24.060]  and all this guy saw was a guy pointing a gun at him he just you know yeah and you know our own
[2:07:24.060 --> 2:07:28.620]  you know elijah shaffer was on the streets in dc at blm plaza well i can't believe there's a place
[2:07:28.620 --> 2:07:33.820]  called black lives matter plaza and they were putting out active tweets that were saying we're
[2:07:33.820 --> 2:07:38.380]  looking for elijah shaffer with the intention of assassinating him as soon as there's no police
[2:07:38.380 --> 2:07:42.540]  presence had to pull him off the streets that's strong language when you start using the words
[2:07:42.540 --> 2:07:48.220]  we're looking for him in order to assassinate him that's real stuff right there that's when the world
[2:07:48.220 --> 2:07:52.940]  gets real uh at what point in time do you push back on that and say nope we're not going to put
[2:07:52.940 --> 2:07:58.380]  up with that well you're absolutely right and elijah shaffer's got uh our old savannah nanda's
[2:07:58.380 --> 2:08:02.220]  working with him and savannah's a great lady she's mad at us that i wouldn't let her go out alone
[2:08:02.220 --> 2:08:05.820]  i'd make her take security and then that would actually blow her cover we get it but then as
[2:08:05.820 --> 2:08:09.820]  soon as she said she was going to go there she got beat up once and she's got a lot of courage but
[2:08:09.820 --> 2:08:15.020]  again why would they beat up a woman videotaping them they're scum yeah they are scum and that's
[2:08:15.020 --> 2:08:20.700]  exactly what was going on last night uh and and even with arm security or any assets that you have
[2:08:20.700 --> 2:08:25.100]  around you when you're surrounded by 200 antifa members that are threatening violence you're
[2:08:25.100 --> 2:08:29.180]  mobbed there's nothing you can do you know elijah got tuned up last week in philadelphia when you
[2:08:29.180 --> 2:08:34.780]  got punched in the mouth yeah got his lips split open uh it's a it's a crappy situation uh to go
[2:08:34.780 --> 2:08:39.500]  into that uh he's he's got bigger balls than me quite honestly i was i was about to say why are we
[2:08:39.500 --> 2:08:44.060]  having to send women and male reporters in when the police should do their job but in these blue
[2:08:44.060 --> 2:08:48.140]  cities they've been ordered to stand out right yeah and people don't want to be exposed i mean
[2:08:48.140 --> 2:08:52.460]  that's that's the big issue there they don't want to be filmed doing what they're doing they want
[2:08:52.460 --> 2:08:56.540]  to be anonymous that's why they're wearing the damn masks they don't want to be seen uh and so
[2:08:56.540 --> 2:08:59.980]  exposing the darkness like that's going to lead to violence and i think one of the keys is we got
[2:08:59.980 --> 2:09:03.660]  to continue exposing the violence because law enforcement apparently is not going to do that
[2:09:03.660 --> 2:09:09.020]  that let's come back and talk about what happens if trump gets in what he should do and then what
[2:09:09.020 --> 2:09:13.500]  happens if they're able to steal it which they intend to do but everybody better get like well
[2:09:13.500 --> 2:09:18.540]  there's no way it's a fraud they don't care they've already taken over almost every country in the
[2:09:18.540 --> 2:09:24.220]  world leon tell folks about your twitter leon macadoo while you guys still have it hopefully

[2:10:18.060 --> 2:10:23.740]  they're going to add more and more restrictions on of how you get that travel pass remember the
[2:10:23.740 --> 2:10:29.340]  running man sword stagger movie the mid eighties written by steven king about a future police state
[2:10:29.340 --> 2:10:37.020]  watch that movie and then compare it to today we are in the absolute brand the absolute mold
[2:10:37.020 --> 2:10:42.060]  of a classic authoritarian dystopic nightmare we've got to reject this now before it's submitted
[2:10:43.180 --> 2:10:48.860]  we're only here on air facing the globalist onsots the dnc funded lawsuits and everything
[2:10:48.860 --> 2:10:54.140]  that's happening because of you we built the only truly multimedia independent radio tv print film
[2:10:54.140 --> 2:10:58.140]  organization in the world that promotes the truth against the globalist we've had a devastating
[2:10:58.140 --> 2:11:03.340]  effect we're a national treasure you're a national treasure for supporting us and so go get a t-shirt
[2:11:03.340 --> 2:11:08.940]  go get a historic t-shirt we've got a funny one that's the biden groping a woman it's it's a woman's
[2:11:08.940 --> 2:11:13.180]  design shirt my wife really likes it you sent me this gift it's pretty cute here it is and it just
[2:11:13.180 --> 2:11:17.180]  you know it's a little historic thing i think trump's gonna win but if biden's able to steal it we'll
[2:11:17.180 --> 2:11:21.420]  be probably shut down pretty quick so it'll be a historic thing to have you'll be able to fight them
[2:11:21.420 --> 2:11:25.740]  in the third dimension on the street with graffiti with handbills you hand out and with
[2:11:25.740 --> 2:11:30.620]  non-compliance not paying taxes and pulling your kids out of the schools and uh just making it a
[2:11:30.620 --> 2:11:35.500]  full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal foreign takeover of america we've
[2:11:35.500 --> 2:11:39.500]  gotten to that point biden for nursing home i hope to retire biden that'd be a collector's
[2:11:39.500 --> 2:11:47.900]  item get it while you still can we're not ordering more info war store dot com you're listening to the
[2:11:47.900 --> 2:12:03.260]  alex jones show waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines
[2:12:03.260 --> 2:12:13.020]  of the info war
[2:12:23.740 --> 2:12:27.020]  gotta help him i'm bleeding i know but you gotta help him
[2:12:27.020 --> 2:12:30.620]  come on no get off
[2:12:37.900 --> 2:12:43.260]  yeah girl they tried to he tried to stab you they stabbed me they stabbed me
[2:12:43.260 --> 2:12:47.260]  he's bleeding really bad yeah they stabbed bevelen bitty right now
[2:12:47.260 --> 2:12:57.260]  they just stabbed bevelen bitty call 911
[2:13:01.260 --> 2:13:05.980]  this isn't about saying we're right it's what chad braver pointed out 15 minutes ago
[2:13:07.420 --> 2:13:12.060]  when he first joined us we're laying out what they say they're gonna do and then they go oh
[2:13:12.060 --> 2:13:17.100]  your cooks jones and others you know they're claiming that we're gonna contest it and we're
[2:13:17.100 --> 2:13:21.660]  gonna have antifas around the white house and we're gonna stab people and now they're doing it
[2:13:21.660 --> 2:13:25.980]  chad now they're doing it lian so so let's walk through those scenarios and get any points you
[2:13:25.980 --> 2:13:32.380]  want to what happens if they're able to remove trump versus if trump can get back in and can
[2:13:32.380 --> 2:13:36.540]  stop the steal what does he need to do immediately i think he'll be on the war path more now than ever
[2:13:36.540 --> 2:13:43.180]  yeah i think the white house is on the war path i think they're i think they're in a situation
[2:13:43.180 --> 2:13:50.460]  and they're looking at what their proper recourses are but beyond the white house you know american
[2:13:50.460 --> 2:13:57.340]  citizens uh just the the hate that they're experiencing for supporting one candidate or the
[2:13:57.340 --> 2:14:02.700]  other it's it's insane to watch uh from the footage you were just showing there i mean you look at
[2:14:02.700 --> 2:14:06.860]  the wall they built around the white house it looks like the burlin wall it's i mean you know
[2:14:06.860 --> 2:14:13.180]  double gated it's the idea that we need something like that that people are out there and and right
[2:14:13.180 --> 2:14:18.060]  now they don't know whether to riot or not to riot uh it's like it's like a pit bull that's
[2:14:18.060 --> 2:14:22.380]  eating a chicken right and then you you pointed another chicken and said i don't eat that chicken
[2:14:22.380 --> 2:14:25.260]  now they've already tasted blood they're gonna keep coming they're gonna keep coming they're
[2:14:25.260 --> 2:14:31.740]  gonna keep coming and i hope trump uses the full the full arsenal of everything he's got to go after
[2:14:31.740 --> 2:14:37.500]  them with this i hope the recounting wisconsin i hope uh juliani goes to philadelphia i hope they
[2:14:37.500 --> 2:14:43.100]  do everything that they can do to push this thing and fight this because this is massive fraud that's
[2:14:43.100 --> 2:14:47.420]  going on they told us they were gonna do it alex leon they told us they were gonna do it and they
[2:14:47.420 --> 2:14:52.220]  did it you're gonna stop an election in the middle of the night see how many count how many votes
[2:14:52.220 --> 2:14:56.620]  you're behind and then come up with a number that puts you in the lead and that's exactly what they
[2:14:56.620 --> 2:15:02.940]  did last night it's incredibly obvious right right they were saying for months they were
[2:15:02.940 --> 2:15:07.900]  saying that trump's not going to leave office what do we do if he refuses to leave he's going to
[2:15:07.900 --> 2:15:12.940]  say that the that the results are illegitimate he's gonna fight it and of course so they create
[2:15:12.940 --> 2:15:16.860]  the fraud they create the scenario he's forced to block it because it is a scam and then it's a
[2:15:16.860 --> 2:15:20.540]  self-fulfilling prophecy for their idiot supporters that he's actually a dictator right and then they
[2:15:20.540 --> 2:15:24.540]  could say oh we got to get him out he's refusing to leave and of course now the trump campaign
[2:15:24.540 --> 2:15:30.620]  they have filed suit in michigan to halt the ballot counting and one other state uh wisconsin
[2:15:30.620 --> 2:15:34.780]  but until the campaign is granted meaningful access to numerous counting locations and a
[2:15:34.780 --> 2:15:39.740]  review of all opened and counted ballots so they know that there's a steal going on they want to
[2:15:39.740 --> 2:15:44.460]  make sure oh how how all of a sudden did you find these hundred and thirty eight thousand ballots
[2:15:44.460 --> 2:15:48.940]  just so happen to be one hundred percent for biden something's a little bit fishy there where you
[2:15:48.940 --> 2:15:52.860]  just hide knees back in the storage closet and trump predicted it thirty minutes before it happened
[2:15:52.860 --> 2:15:57.740]  last night right and they said oh how dare he put out that by the way chat i'm not trying to kiss
[2:15:57.740 --> 2:16:03.660]  people's ass but president trump literally 74 looked like he'd been resting for two weeks of the
[2:16:03.660 --> 2:16:09.100]  bahamas last night at 4 a.m. gives an incredibly accurate speech i mean this guy's freaking phenomenal
[2:16:09.900 --> 2:16:15.580]  dude listen guys i was dead last night we were sitting here waiting on on the president to come
[2:16:15.580 --> 2:16:20.940]  out and give his speech and we were just saying please come on come on donnie t get on stage man
[2:16:20.940 --> 2:16:26.460]  so we can get out of here uh he comes out looking refreshed renewed i mean this doesn't look like
[2:16:26.460 --> 2:16:34.140]  a guy who had corona virus what five weeks ago uh he's looking good man strong bullet energy
[2:16:34.140 --> 2:16:39.340]  and you can't tell me that joe biden who has given up put a lid on life waived the white flag of
[2:16:39.340 --> 2:16:44.940]  surrender on living in and can't even remember who his granddaughter or his wife or his sons or
[2:16:44.940 --> 2:16:49.980]  anybody else you can't he doesn't know who he is 70 million people voted for this guy you can't tell
[2:16:49.980 --> 2:16:54.460]  me he doesn't know his own name he can't find his way out of the basement you're going to tell me
[2:16:54.460 --> 2:16:59.500]  70 million americans voted for this man so let me ask you that question if they're able to steal it
[2:16:59.500 --> 2:17:03.340]  one of the repercussions in a snapshot i think i don't want this to happen because i'm not mackey
[2:17:03.340 --> 2:17:08.540]  of ellie i don't believe it in justifies the means but i can look at the awakening the backlash the
[2:17:08.540 --> 2:17:14.380]  really people have really stopped being complacent if they steal this they have sowed massive seeds
[2:17:14.380 --> 2:17:20.620]  for their destruction well in many cases one could look at it you know to an extreme you could say
[2:17:20.620 --> 2:17:25.740]  well this is the end of the republic i mean you you're got a guy who is incapable of running a
[2:17:25.740 --> 2:17:30.940]  country much less being the leader of the free world in joe biden secondly if he steps down and
[2:17:30.940 --> 2:17:37.260]  there's so many scenarios whereby he could step down maybe uh in grief because his son hunter
[2:17:37.260 --> 2:17:42.460]  od's uh maybe because of scandal that's there maybe they he's putting his shoes on the wrong
[2:17:42.460 --> 2:17:47.500]  feet and they can't you know they can't he's walking into walls and he's just not it for
[2:17:47.500 --> 2:17:53.260]  service in that capacity so now you have a socialist a far left socialist who steps into
[2:17:53.260 --> 2:18:00.700]  the oval office in kamala harris um you could paint a picture for an end of the republic
[2:18:00.700 --> 2:18:05.980]  because now this critic this becomes a critical election this becomes the transformation of
[2:18:05.980 --> 2:18:11.340]  the democratic party now we're no longer democratic party but it's a socialist party uh
[2:18:11.340 --> 2:18:15.820]  that's right it's a socialist revolution so you're right i see people waking up in a backlash but
[2:18:15.820 --> 2:18:19.740]  you're right they intend they know that's their weakness they're gonna go peer authoritarian
[2:18:19.740 --> 2:18:23.820]  they've said they are and really try to mop up the country i think you're right i think it's just
[2:18:23.820 --> 2:18:29.820]  it's so it just can't be allowed to happen we can't let this happen no and now now they're coming
[2:18:29.820 --> 2:18:35.340]  they do come out you know as beto orork says hell yeah we're coming for your guns uh so and they will
[2:18:35.340 --> 2:18:40.220]  they can basically pack the courts write the laws do anything they want to do god forbid they get the
[2:18:40.220 --> 2:18:45.660]  senate uh and if that were the situation where they had the house the senate and the white house
[2:18:45.660 --> 2:18:50.540]  they can they could write anything they want to do scrap the constitution scrap the bill of rights
[2:18:50.540 --> 2:18:56.060]  get rid of the so this is an overthrow of america backed by communist china on record they hide it
[2:18:56.060 --> 2:19:01.820]  in plain view they're not even hiding it we really i'll be honest i have a responsibility i think you
[2:19:01.820 --> 2:19:06.780]  do all men do women as well i just think we have to do whatever's necessary at this point uh but we
[2:19:06.780 --> 2:19:10.540]  can't play with their plan we don't want to be offensively violent but at a certain point we just
[2:19:10.540 --> 2:19:16.060]  can't let biden take over yeah no you can't let that we can't let that happen uh you got to fight
[2:19:16.060 --> 2:19:21.340]  that with every means necessary that's out there uh use the court use the supreme court uh push this
[2:19:21.340 --> 2:19:25.900]  thing as far as you can fight it like i said if joe biden won this election fair and square that's
[2:19:25.900 --> 2:19:30.460]  one thing but i just can't believe that he did that he's a tricon agent no no what do you think
[2:19:30.460 --> 2:19:36.220]  happens that biden can get in i just had a scary thought what if you know biden he's obviously
[2:19:36.220 --> 2:19:41.340]  gonna get taken out within the first six months he's gonna you know step down whatever um what about
[2:19:41.340 --> 2:19:48.140]  third in line speaker of the house Pelosi president well under the constitution how does that usually
[2:19:48.140 --> 2:19:52.300]  if a president leaves the vice president comes in yes and i forget who then who were who makes the
[2:19:52.300 --> 2:19:58.860]  vice president i think the president does right like that person how's that work chad well you
[2:19:58.860 --> 2:20:02.860]  would have it depends on the scenario that's in there i mean obviously you could have a situation
[2:20:02.860 --> 2:20:07.980]  where the speaker of the house has to step in uh but if kamala harris becomes the president of
[2:20:07.980 --> 2:20:11.580]  united states of course she has an opportunity then to appoint her own vice president which
[2:20:11.580 --> 2:20:16.460]  could be interesting if you have someone like let's say hillary clinton uh there's a lot of
[2:20:16.460 --> 2:20:21.820]  scenarios they talked about that actually they get really really scary that are in there i i wouldn't
[2:20:21.820 --> 2:20:27.020]  surprise me at all if something like that were to happen the rise of the witches all right all right
[2:20:27.020 --> 2:20:30.700]  i've been asking the questions when we come back in the next segment with chad brather and liam
[2:20:30.700 --> 2:20:34.620]  macadoo i'm gonna ask what you guys think is next and what we should do and what other angles of
[2:20:34.620 --> 2:20:39.820]  the start we have a lot of news a lot of clips and what's gonna happen um ib trump gets in how
[2:20:39.820 --> 2:20:44.220]  does he go on the warpath what does he need to do i mean i once saw a bumper sticker that read
[2:20:44.940 --> 2:20:51.020]  if you want your children to listen to you whisper and it's true a lot of times if somebody's
[2:20:51.020 --> 2:20:56.060]  shouting and yelling even of what they're talking about is important people tend to tune it out
[2:20:56.060 --> 2:21:02.140]  you know why i know that because i'm alex jones and i've been pretty obnoxious over the years
[2:21:02.140 --> 2:21:06.940]  because i'm worried about the new world order and i read about all their plans to lock down
[2:21:06.940 --> 2:21:12.940]  civilization start of the third world and then enslave the first world so i've been really
[2:21:12.940 --> 2:21:17.820]  really loud and really really aggressive and we've had a big effect but but now it's time to think
[2:21:17.820 --> 2:21:23.420]  about every different angle and every different way we can get people to think for themselves
[2:21:23.420 --> 2:21:29.980]  before it's too late the lockdown social distancing the mask is meant to end human civilization
[2:21:30.540 --> 2:21:37.420]  we are under a civilization collapse weapon so this is live and death please share info wars
[2:21:37.420 --> 2:21:43.580]  dot com and band our video and watch our live election coverage i get asked all the time by
[2:21:43.580 --> 2:21:48.620]  listeners and by the media what am i most proud of when it comes to the show and it's the fact that
[2:21:48.620 --> 2:21:53.900]  info wars more than 25 years ago doing basic research with what the club of rome and the cfr
[2:21:53.900 --> 2:21:59.260]  and others were actually saying developed the hypothesis that communist china had been set up
[2:21:59.260 --> 2:22:03.900]  to take our jobs and transfer them to china and then make us economically destitute and position
[2:22:03.900 --> 2:22:08.940]  us into debt well now china owns the debt now china owns hollywood all the one side of trading
[2:22:08.940 --> 2:22:15.260]  deals it turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on but again it wasn't that hard the cfr and
[2:22:15.260 --> 2:22:20.940]  others admitted what they were doing but still others didn't want to focus on that issue we did
[2:22:20.940 --> 2:22:26.380]  and you focused on it by supporting us at info wars so when you go to info wars store dot com and
[2:22:26.380 --> 2:22:31.260]  get all the great supplements books t-shirts films water filtration air filtration all of it
[2:22:31.260 --> 2:22:35.660]  you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world what's really happening
[2:22:35.660 --> 2:22:38.700]  so that's a big accomplishment for all of you i'm gonna thank you for your support
[2:22:38.700 --> 2:22:48.060]  much of the time on big issues and societal developments info wars is many many years ahead
[2:22:48.620 --> 2:22:54.460]  and almost all the time we are tomorrow's news today but there's a blind spot that info wars has
[2:22:54.460 --> 2:22:59.260]  i've noticed that really informed people have this as well i know a lot of you tuning in are
[2:22:59.260 --> 2:23:02.860]  some of the most conformable out there so i want you to be retrospective and kind of examine
[2:23:02.860 --> 2:23:09.740]  yourself because that's what i do every day this hunter bite laptop is important but the new audio
[2:23:09.740 --> 2:23:15.180]  confirmed to be him where he admits he works under the communist chinese spy chief he should be
[2:23:15.180 --> 2:23:22.220]  arrested right now that is so huge that is hiding in plain view and it's getting almost no attention
[2:23:23.020 --> 2:23:27.420]  we have to get that information out to everybody it's all posted on info wars dot com
[2:23:27.420 --> 2:23:33.420]  so many other major patriotic sites but we need to get it out to everybody and remember that we
[2:23:33.420 --> 2:23:37.980]  know all of this we knew it a long time ago so when it breaks now we kind of go okay tell us
[2:23:37.980 --> 2:23:46.700]  that we didn't know the point is now it's documented now it's proven you're listening to the alex
[2:23:46.700 --> 2:23:59.500]  jones show
[2:23:59.500 --> 2:24:08.300]  so

[2:25:31.900 --> 2:25:37.260]  crap like that because they're all in it together at the top and uh breaking trump wins main second
[2:25:37.260 --> 2:25:42.220]  congressional district so that's one point it's to split up in two pieces there trump campaign
[2:25:42.220 --> 2:25:46.940]  statement on michigan lawsuit they're calling for every bit of accounting to stop until there's
[2:25:46.940 --> 2:25:53.020]  lawyers and eyeballs on what these little gremlins are up to and i totally agree with that and makado
[2:25:53.020 --> 2:25:58.300]  that's what you know we're saying he has to block it it's a fraud they're illegal it's been proven
[2:25:59.500 --> 2:26:03.340]  it's a democrat strategy they admitted they were going to do this so he's got that for court
[2:26:03.340 --> 2:26:08.220]  and so now they're going to say he's trying to block votes right are any of these boxes that
[2:26:08.220 --> 2:26:12.700]  they miraculously find with these ballots from the military are they military mail-in ballots
[2:26:12.700 --> 2:26:17.180]  because they're notoriously bad at counting those votes those always get lost and no one ever cares
[2:26:17.180 --> 2:26:22.060]  about no one ever is able to find those but they can find these hundred percent joe biden votes
[2:26:22.060 --> 2:26:26.460]  that were locked up in the storage closet or sitting in a mail truck somewhere chad brother
[2:26:26.460 --> 2:26:31.820]  what do you make of these latest developments well it's amazing when you look at the graphs how
[2:26:31.820 --> 2:26:36.540]  they're going up they're going up they're going up and then they stop and then they go directly
[2:26:36.540 --> 2:26:44.220]  vertical up for joe biden and then they start going up more uh it's just incredible to see
[2:26:44.220 --> 2:26:49.020]  graphs don't work like that i i understand if there's a if there's a if there's an upward
[2:26:49.020 --> 2:26:54.300]  growth you know it's going forward but just to stop and then all of a sudden jump up by a hundred
[2:26:54.300 --> 2:26:59.980]  thousand and keep going is insane um i do think they need somebody looking over their shoulder
[2:26:59.980 --> 2:27:04.540]  somebody needs to be there i you know i don't know if we need to start having you know these
[2:27:04.540 --> 2:27:09.100]  armored cars that are coming in with armed security that are grabbing these boxes and taking them out
[2:27:09.100 --> 2:27:14.940]  and i mean is anybody objective anymore i don't know um but somebody needs to be looking over
[2:27:14.940 --> 2:27:19.820]  their shoulder i'm gonna steal that phrase from you alex these little gremlins uh that are that
[2:27:19.820 --> 2:27:24.860]  are counting these ballots because you're exactly right there's something fresh out of the pit of
[2:27:24.860 --> 2:27:29.660]  hell going on here we're we're we're this we're in a battle for the soul of our country this is the
[2:27:29.660 --> 2:27:36.620]  soul this is the identity of america that is at stake this is everything that we have uh that
[2:27:36.620 --> 2:27:41.900]  that's the things that we love about this country the things that we value and make us patriots all
[2:27:41.900 --> 2:27:46.700]  of that is on the altar at this point in time and for folks that don't know you called for the graph
[2:27:46.700 --> 2:27:51.980]  there it is the graph uh we haven't read a several states wisconsin michigan it as soon as those drop
[2:27:51.980 --> 2:27:56.700]  it's a straight up line no graph is straight if it's organic and real it goes up and down this is
[2:27:56.700 --> 2:28:02.460]  just boom perfectly uh straight up like a rocket for joe biden i mean that's ridiculous right and they
[2:28:02.460 --> 2:28:06.380]  they called out the and then it continues on perfect line that's an artificial line of fraud
[2:28:06.380 --> 2:28:11.260]  sorry the president you know that how dare he say that they're going to find a bunch of boxes of
[2:28:11.260 --> 2:28:16.140]  of votes at four o'clock in the morning we wouldn't do that we have integrity how dare he but that's
[2:28:16.140 --> 2:28:19.420]  what they always do exactly what happened i mean that's exactly what happened now they got their
[2:28:19.420 --> 2:28:23.260]  operatives hoarding them and they go okay we need this many okay bring them in right and they're just
[2:28:23.260 --> 2:28:26.940]  holding on didn't think they might they don't roll them out because maybe they won't need them
[2:28:26.940 --> 2:28:31.660]  they thought there was going to be this blue wave um but you know then they all that that's right
[2:28:31.660 --> 2:28:35.260]  the senate that they're not getting well looks like we're going to make the senate stronger
[2:28:35.260 --> 2:28:39.180]  house is about the same you'd imagine if trump wasn't so much trouble they would have taken the
[2:28:39.180 --> 2:28:43.340]  senate i mean that looks to me that's another indicative sign well people are just waking up i
[2:28:43.340 --> 2:28:49.100]  mean even in in kenosha county it was it's very slim margin there but for trump and i think you
[2:28:49.100 --> 2:28:53.820]  know they had they experienced the riots there and the looting and they and the the call to
[2:28:53.820 --> 2:28:59.500]  defund the police um and they're thinking they're actually seeing it similar to the cubans and
[2:28:59.500 --> 2:29:04.140]  miami and venezuelans and those people living there in exile from their communist countries
[2:29:04.140 --> 2:29:09.740]  they see the writing on the wall and they're voting absolutely against that happening here in our
[2:29:09.740 --> 2:29:15.660]  country so people with eyes to see can definitely see what's going on what about written house he's
[2:29:15.660 --> 2:29:20.860]  facing two million dollar bond uh it turns out the three guys that attacked him were all criminals
[2:29:20.860 --> 2:29:25.660]  one a pedophile one and they were all criminals and he's on record they were shooting at him
[2:29:25.660 --> 2:29:29.660]  he now know another guy had a gun aimed at him but i read about people now killing people out
[2:29:29.660 --> 2:29:36.060]  of the jail like a week i mean it's insane but oh written house he's got to pay chad yeah call
[2:29:36.060 --> 2:29:40.940]  written house is a good example uh if you're not going to defend us and i'm talking about the police
[2:29:40.940 --> 2:29:45.180]  if you're talking i'm talking about law enforcement talking about national guard whoever comes in on
[2:29:45.180 --> 2:29:48.940]  the scene if you're not going to defend us we have to have the right to defend ourselves and you see
[2:29:48.940 --> 2:29:53.420]  too many of these call written house situations where someone defended themselves and you can
[2:29:53.420 --> 2:29:57.100]  make the argument all day long well maybe call written house shouldn't have been out there with
[2:29:57.100 --> 2:30:05.820]  an ar-15 well he's got the right to do that look i support uh numerous organizations that have shown
[2:30:05.820 --> 2:30:11.260]  up you know and i support their right to bear arms you want to walk out there with an ar-15 you
[2:30:11.260 --> 2:30:16.620]  want to march down the street with the ar-15 we've seen you know you got like a liberal zombie
[2:30:16.620 --> 2:30:22.940]  pedophile apocalypse uh i mean i mean the one guy he shot first literally is convicted of raping
[2:30:22.940 --> 2:30:30.700]  little boys yeah i mean they're chasing him beating him and how dare he defend himself i mean i look
[2:30:31.900 --> 2:30:37.020]  people get people get up in arms because it's as they say an assault style weapon right look i don't
[2:30:37.020 --> 2:30:42.220]  i don't go anywhere that i'm not armed i don't go anywhere i look i got him in texas i you know i
[2:30:42.220 --> 2:30:48.380]  have the right i've i've done everything to have that right i mean i've got i've got a police shot
[2:30:48.380 --> 2:30:52.780]  gun in my truck and i've got a non-millimeter and it's not because i'm living fear i'm living
[2:30:52.780 --> 2:30:59.900]  in charge i'm not gonna be pushed around exactly i i don't i don't want to match might for might i
[2:30:59.900 --> 2:31:05.260]  want to i want to overcome the might that's coming against me so i make sure that i'm protected my
[2:31:05.260 --> 2:31:09.740]  family makes sure i'm protected we're defensive and offensive listen i've got body armor my family
[2:31:09.740 --> 2:31:14.620]  everybody my family's got body armor uh we've got protection around our house we don't want to shoot
[2:31:14.620 --> 2:31:18.940]  anybody but by god if you come down our street and you start causing trouble at our house it's
[2:31:18.940 --> 2:31:23.180]  going to be a different story that's why all the crimes in areas where there's not good old boys
[2:31:24.300 --> 2:31:28.940]  yeah that's why they're doing everything they're doing burning down urban areas because they're
[2:31:28.940 --> 2:31:34.060]  bullies they know that in most urban areas that are democratic run cities these people are unarmed
[2:31:34.060 --> 2:31:39.180]  and they can get away with a lot of stuff and then enter a Kyle Rittenhouse who defended himself and
[2:31:39.180 --> 2:31:43.420]  now they're wanting to crucify him and make an example out of him and he was well within his
[2:31:43.420 --> 2:31:47.980]  rights and he can't he did everything he could to try to get away from these people and and finally
[2:31:47.980 --> 2:31:53.500]  felt threatened for his life and he shot him and let's say it he's not a big imposing guy he's got
[2:31:53.500 --> 2:31:58.860]  courage he did a good job defending himself he was very proficient but he he doesn't look like
[2:31:58.860 --> 2:32:02.860]  you know a big tough guy and so that's why they picked on him they also beat up women they beat
[2:32:02.860 --> 2:32:07.580]  up handicaps I mean these pieces are sad that's why the guy first guy killed that was attacking
[2:32:07.580 --> 2:32:12.620]  you know in rape two eight-year-old boys I mean this is what these two these people are yeah and
[2:32:12.620 --> 2:32:16.540]  at what point time do we say enough's enough at what point time is do we say enough is enough
[2:32:16.540 --> 2:32:20.700]  you're burning down buildings you're looting you're vandalizing you're killing you're murdering you
[2:32:20.700 --> 2:32:25.900]  showed a clip earlier somebody being stabbed in Washington DC at what point time do you say that's
[2:32:25.900 --> 2:32:31.980]  enough and we're going to fight back right this can't be the new normal we can't have people just
[2:32:31.980 --> 2:32:38.300]  targeting this this woman bevelen baby who was stabbed she's the one who had previously dumped
[2:32:38.300 --> 2:32:43.500]  paint over the black lives matter mural outside the trump tower so they believe that they were
[2:32:43.500 --> 2:32:52.140]  targeting her because she dared to stand up and and and you know not go along with with the resistance
[2:32:52.140 --> 2:32:56.300]  how dare you be a black woman who isn't going along with the black lives matter movement so
[2:32:56.300 --> 2:33:00.860]  they stabbed her they they targeted her and let's play that you think they're not targeting people
[2:33:00.860 --> 2:33:05.260]  if you think they're not targeting individuals we saw that with Elijah last night you're stupid
[2:33:05.260 --> 2:33:08.620]  they are definitely targeting individuals that they thought that's what I told uh
[2:33:09.260 --> 2:33:15.580]  Savannah I said listen you're targeted now they know I don't even I care about Savannah and she's
[2:33:15.580 --> 2:33:20.300]  out there every day she's got courage but they're targeting her because they're terrorists that's
[2:33:20.300 --> 2:33:24.540]  exactly right all right final segment coming up what do you want to hit when we come back Kyle
[2:33:24.540 --> 2:33:31.820]  you're not Kyle you're Chad so much Kyle yeah yeah I don't want a $2 million bond that's right
[2:33:31.820 --> 2:33:37.180]  dude at this point in time I need a drink Alex I've already had one don't worry let's talk about
[2:33:37.180 --> 2:33:41.580]  what it looks like between now and the election I'm sorry the inauguration that's right look it up
[2:33:41.580 --> 2:33:47.500]  for yourself the head of the devos group issued a report one six months ago calling for world
[2:33:47.500 --> 2:33:53.900]  government to be openly established to respond to COVID-19 the COVID-19 was a blessing to lower
[2:33:53.900 --> 2:33:59.980]  the planet's carbon footprint since then Prince Charles and countless others have come out and said
[2:33:59.980 --> 2:34:07.580]  the exact same thing the most ancient form of total war is called siege and that's when you cut
[2:34:07.580 --> 2:34:13.580]  people off from their resources that's when you lock them down and this isn't siege to make us
[2:34:13.580 --> 2:34:17.820]  capitulate to the globalist or just get rid of Donald Trump that's only part of it this is siege
[2:34:17.820 --> 2:34:23.260]  to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt so then the globalist social
[2:34:23.260 --> 2:34:29.420]  engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social credit score surveillance grip
[2:34:29.420 --> 2:34:33.740]  so you've heard the u.s. army saying our job is to kill people and break things well that's what
[2:34:33.740 --> 2:34:37.820]  the lockdown's doing it's starving the third world millions and millions of death it's breaking
[2:34:37.820 --> 2:34:45.340]  down the supply chain in society it's their mission it's all on record Yale Harvard Princeton
[2:34:45.340 --> 2:34:52.460]  Stanford they were all hired a year ago and then against six months ago to war game how to get the
[2:34:52.460 --> 2:34:58.220]  public to stay locked down during a pandemic and how to get the public to take inoculations and they
[2:34:58.220 --> 2:35:03.340]  talk about calling people heroes that do it they talk about shaming those that don't this has all
[2:35:03.340 --> 2:35:08.540]  been psychologically tested they told that psychologically prepared and once they get
[2:35:08.540 --> 2:35:13.340]  it locked down for 15 days you notice now they say it's permanent that's how it works oh just put
[2:35:13.340 --> 2:35:18.540]  these handcuffs on the serial killer says the woman in the parking lot everything will be all right
[2:35:18.540 --> 2:35:24.860]  no now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van he's taking us
[2:35:25.420 --> 2:35:31.020]  to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death that's the allegory we got to bust
[2:35:31.020 --> 2:35:35.340]  out of this thing now we got to say no now we got to make a run for it now and we still can't
[2:35:35.340 --> 2:35:39.580]  because once he gets us in that base but it's going to get a lot a lot worse folks so stop
[2:35:39.580 --> 2:35:46.140]  submitting dna force plus if you did one thing for your immune system it would be get all the
[2:35:46.140 --> 2:35:52.220]  essential things and that's the clean i9 x2 or x3 that's the bio tricillinium that is the vitamin
[2:35:52.220 --> 2:35:56.060]  d3 that is the c that is the zinc there's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential without
[2:35:56.060 --> 2:35:59.740]  them you die and studies show you really need the other ones too but dna force goes beyond that it
[2:35:59.740 --> 2:36:05.020]  helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with pqq and coq 10 of the highest quality sources
[2:36:05.020 --> 2:36:11.100]  with other ingredients that clean out the cells that unclog them so all that stuff can get in
[2:36:11.100 --> 2:36:15.260]  viruses don't get in the good stuff gets in as the NIH website says that if you have all the
[2:36:15.260 --> 2:36:19.580]  proper things they can't replicate like they could but i do this because it's essential like oxygen
[2:36:19.580 --> 2:36:25.100]  like water dna force sold out for months 50 off out of the gates triple patriot points free shipping
[2:36:25.100 --> 2:36:29.340]  infowarstore.com dna force election special that's gonna have to end in a week because we got a
[2:36:29.340 --> 2:36:33.100]  limited supply and it was very hard to get the pqq this time a lot of our stuff is you can't get
[2:36:33.100 --> 2:36:36.140]  any more a lot of our products because the supply chain is broken down that's part of the global's

[2:37:06.460 --> 2:37:11.820]  and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well including
[2:37:11.820 --> 2:37:17.980]  having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like siri or alexa do and then putting
[2:37:17.980 --> 2:37:24.060]  databases transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever your phone is

[2:37:44.300 --> 2:37:58.300]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:58.300 --> 2:38:09.980]  i was looking at the numbers and i just gotta tell you uh right now looks like trump's gonna lose okay
[2:38:10.700 --> 2:38:16.540]  if he doesn't flip vichigan back if he doesn't get nevada if he doesn't get herizona uh it's
[2:38:16.540 --> 2:38:21.180]  it's it's it's bye bye time and of course it's all been done by fraud the covid the lockdown the
[2:38:21.180 --> 2:38:25.820]  fake ballots the deadcats voting and he's set in georgia let's punch up the satellite feed it's
[2:38:25.820 --> 2:38:30.860]  still empty how do you know a biden campaign because it's an empty parking lot um he's set to
[2:38:30.860 --> 2:38:36.460]  declare victory at four o'clock today we'll be live on air covering this disgusting spectacle and
[2:38:37.340 --> 2:38:40.940]  again i'm gonna tell you that they said if biden wins they're gonna come after trump supporters
[2:38:40.940 --> 2:38:45.980]  and quote level us persecute us put us in prison it's not just keith oberman saying that it's high
[2:38:45.980 --> 2:38:52.220]  level democrats so this is a communist overthrow this is not a normal you know just like our guess
[2:38:52.220 --> 2:38:57.660]  was just saying this is not a normal political handoff if this happens they are literally looking
[2:38:57.660 --> 2:39:02.380]  to submit things and have one party rule leon right and even if joe biden comes out and announces
[2:39:02.380 --> 2:39:07.420]  that he's the winner even prematurely then that's still going to feed into that narrative
[2:39:07.420 --> 2:39:14.700]  that trump's uh refusing to concede refusing to step down i mean hillary clinton still four years
[2:39:14.700 --> 2:39:20.860]  later tells everyone well i won the popular vote i mean it's just it's just a way to maybe they're
[2:39:20.860 --> 2:39:25.660]  gonna wait till the weekend to roll out their rioters and their looters um because trump is
[2:39:25.660 --> 2:39:30.140]  going to refuse to leave the white house they are exactly what it is gathering to force him out we're
[2:39:30.140 --> 2:39:34.300]  going to force him out because he's going to refuse i though it's count i though it's count
[2:39:35.180 --> 2:39:39.820]  chad prather uh i don't want to have a sinking feeling i have a feeling fight for my life like
[2:39:40.300 --> 2:39:43.260]  you know we need to be doing something like do i get on a plane to go to dc
[2:39:43.740 --> 2:39:47.980]  do i i mean i'm getting the point where i'm not going to have some chi-com kami run in my country
[2:39:47.980 --> 2:39:52.860]  i can't have it yeah it's bad i'm when i when we left the studio in the wee hours of the morning
[2:39:52.860 --> 2:39:57.260]  i just felt something empty in my soul like there was something that just wasn't complete yet there
[2:39:57.260 --> 2:40:01.580]  was something you nailed it i'm interrupting it's emptiness that's the feeling it's empty why are
[2:40:01.580 --> 2:40:08.460]  we feeling that yeah and and i i said this is the first time you know i i remember the election i
[2:40:08.460 --> 2:40:13.420]  stayed up in the wee hours as long as i could the election of 2000 uh george w bush now gore
[2:40:13.420 --> 2:40:18.860]  stayed up as long as i could and we know the rest of the history on that uh this is a weird one they
[2:40:18.860 --> 2:40:23.180]  just stopped counting and it just said we're just going to stop and we're just going to
[2:40:23.180 --> 2:40:27.740]  parlay this thing over and see how many we need and we'll go from there and that's exactly what
[2:40:27.740 --> 2:40:31.980]  they did we've called it over and over again you know joe biden's going to come out and he's going
[2:40:31.980 --> 2:40:36.700]  to announce victory because he wants to look presidential in the mind in the eye of people
[2:40:36.700 --> 2:40:41.180]  that are out there and you're exactly rightly and to your point they're going to say well this is
[2:40:41.180 --> 2:40:46.300]  trump being a little desperate who doesn't want to give up power uh this is exactly what happened
[2:40:46.300 --> 2:40:52.780]  actually in 2000 in a different scenario when when george w bush stepped out and basically
[2:40:52.780 --> 2:40:58.060]  announced that he was the winner al gordon stepped up and and assert himself in any form of a leadership
[2:40:58.060 --> 2:41:03.820]  capacity and people just accepted it as the trump's got to go on at the same trump's got to go out
[2:41:03.820 --> 2:41:10.460]  the same time and just indict this son of a bitch that's exactly right you come out you are the
[2:41:10.460 --> 2:41:16.060]  president go be the president announce it uh and you're right i you know michigan you can't tell me
[2:41:16.060 --> 2:41:24.220]  that michigan is going to flip is is going to not flip red is not going to go to i mean that
[2:41:24.220 --> 2:41:31.020]  with red last time it was so big delivered trump delivered yeah the lead was so big and to tell me
[2:41:31.020 --> 2:41:35.740]  that michigan is going to go blue is insane uh you look at the numbers in georgia you look at the
[2:41:35.740 --> 2:41:41.020]  numbers in nevada look at the numbers in pennsylvania the lead was so big in pennsylvania he that's
[2:41:41.020 --> 2:41:46.060]  insurmountable i mean in georgia you know you take clayton county which is a is a demographic
[2:41:46.060 --> 2:41:50.060]  democratic stronghold they didn't have a big turnout in clayton county georgia they didn't
[2:41:50.060 --> 2:41:55.260]  have a big turnout there uh obama used to get crowds of 50 000 people like trump
[2:41:55.260 --> 2:42:00.700]  biden can't get them anywhere when obama came out he's got 12 people sitting in a hula hoop yeah
[2:42:00.700 --> 2:42:05.660]  yeah say that again leon obama just was out campaigning for biden the other day and there
[2:42:05.660 --> 2:42:11.100]  was like 12 people in the crowd i mean he's lost to the luster this is a giant fraud wow
[2:42:11.100 --> 2:42:16.780]  and they expected to have a fraudulent landslide but it didn't work no and you see this i mean
[2:42:16.780 --> 2:42:21.020]  the clip you guys are showing right now i mean you got what 15 people sitting in a hula hoop on the
[2:42:21.020 --> 2:42:26.620]  floor are on the grass there it's insane and in this long walk the same day donald trump lands
[2:42:26.620 --> 2:42:32.860]  and one of 30 000 people yeah and then people act like this is this is the guy that 70 million
[2:42:32.860 --> 2:42:37.340]  people voted for you can't tell this guy doesn't know how to tie his shoes and you're gonna tell
[2:42:37.340 --> 2:42:41.340]  me that 70 million people voted for a guy who can't remember the words that are coming out of his
[2:42:41.340 --> 2:42:46.140]  mouth his wife wears a mask so she can whisper next to him what he needs to be saying she's
[2:42:46.140 --> 2:42:49.980]  his teleprompter in his ear that's why she wears a mask so nobody can see her lips moving
[2:42:49.980 --> 2:42:54.300]  yeah this guy doesn't know where he's at and it's gonna be you know what and there's a part of me
[2:42:54.300 --> 2:42:58.300]  guys there's a part of me that wants to say you know what i hope you get what you deserve
[2:42:58.300 --> 2:43:04.620]  you vote for this kind of nonsense in bs i hope you get what you deserve because uh because look
[2:43:04.620 --> 2:43:08.460]  i'm pretty resilient and you know a lot of folks out there like us we're resilient we're prepared
[2:43:08.460 --> 2:43:12.300]  we can put up with some hard times but these folks these basement dwellers that have never
[2:43:12.300 --> 2:43:16.860]  exercised any muscle but the thumbs that they use to play video game they're not prepared for this
[2:43:16.860 --> 2:43:22.060]  they have no idea they have no aces in the hole and and all we've got is card decks in the hole
[2:43:22.060 --> 2:43:25.980]  and i'm just being honest that's right good old boys do i think be black white old young
[2:43:25.980 --> 2:43:30.140]  we've got our act together these people don't know anything they don't even know what a trot
[2:43:30.140 --> 2:43:34.300]  line is they don't know how to even imagine it's kidding a buck they don't know how to pay a payroll
[2:43:34.300 --> 2:43:38.540]  they don't know how to get up take care of their kids they're all just a bunch of loser idiots that
[2:43:38.540 --> 2:43:45.180]  would actually believe this chi-com agent is good this is pathetic yeah no they've they've been on
[2:43:45.180 --> 2:43:49.260]  they've been on the government dole for so long they don't know any different from from the baby
[2:43:49.260 --> 2:43:54.140]  boomer grandparents to their generation x parents they've never heard the word no they've never
[2:43:54.140 --> 2:43:59.020]  done without uh they've never gone hungry they don't have any concept of a hard day's work and
[2:43:59.020 --> 2:44:03.980]  they certainly don't understand this idea of working six days a week and worshiping on a seventh
[2:44:03.980 --> 2:44:08.780]  and and and you know they don't have any concept of these values the things that made america great
[2:44:08.780 --> 2:44:13.100]  it's like benjamin franklin said we're going to build a republic if we're going to have a republic
[2:44:13.100 --> 2:44:19.660]  if you can keep it and we need we need true and fair and honest and strong resilient people to
[2:44:19.660 --> 2:44:24.380]  stand up right now uh before this thing goes completely absolutely and that's why big tech
[2:44:24.380 --> 2:44:28.940]  wants everybody censored and said we won't listen to anyone's election views other than these seven
[2:44:28.940 --> 2:44:34.700]  media outlets and they're the ones that are covering up all the fraud covering up the scams
[2:44:34.700 --> 2:44:39.180]  because they need this victory against nationalism against our repudiation of them against our
[2:44:39.180 --> 2:44:44.860]  repudiation of the communist chinese this is for all the marbles chad prather is our guest at watch
[2:44:44.860 --> 2:44:48.940]  chad on twitter and on youtube chad prather i'm gonna be popping it on his show tomorrow really

[2:45:21.980 --> 2:45:27.580]  if president trump does win nevada then he will not need michigan or wisconsin and so we don't
[2:45:27.580 --> 2:45:32.220]  really know what's going on there i guess with the the election close to call the nevada officials
[2:45:32.220 --> 2:45:38.140]  said that they were going to just pause releasing the new totals for 24 hours why i'm not sure this
[2:45:38.140 --> 2:45:42.540]  is all unprecedented fraud it's exactly what they said they do and they're just doing it because they
[2:45:42.540 --> 2:45:48.620]  think they've got media cover right they think possibly if they pause then joe biden can get
[2:45:48.620 --> 2:45:54.060]  those other electoral votes to reach 270 if they can stop these other states from getting their
[2:45:54.060 --> 2:45:59.420]  electoral votes in pennsylvania some counties there they said oh it's due to the covid restrictions
[2:45:59.420 --> 2:46:04.940]  that we can't safely count the ballots oh but oh but the cdc said if you have covid still go vote
[2:46:04.940 --> 2:46:09.980]  i mean it's all first turn it on turn it off they control it as a gatekeeping mechanism on us guys

[2:51:09.180 --> 2:51:12.780]  going to declare victory today and they're going to try to stop the recounts they're waiting for
[2:51:12.780 --> 2:51:20.220]  trump's strategy uh they've they've got the fix in nevada they got the fix in uh in arizona the
[2:51:20.220 --> 2:51:25.340]  governor's come out and said it's a scam i told you fox news would announce key states because i
[2:51:25.340 --> 2:51:30.060]  just because they're part of that seven group and and and they're really globalist at the top
[2:51:30.060 --> 2:51:33.260]  and so they would think that would have the credibility i mean i did call that leon yeah
[2:51:33.260 --> 2:51:37.660]  i mean you've got like never trump or paul ryan making some decisions there at fox news they
[2:51:37.660 --> 2:51:41.900]  they're never trumpers there that sit on the board and so they want to say that they're the
[2:51:41.900 --> 2:51:48.620]  voice of the conservatives but they're they're not it's they're it's coming through a filter
[2:51:48.620 --> 2:51:54.300]  it's coming through with bias well tucker exactly used to be i didn't like trump guy and and more
[2:51:54.300 --> 2:51:58.300]  libertarian so they thought he was safe and then he really showed who he was and now he's so powerful
[2:51:58.300 --> 2:52:01.580]  they're scared of him but other than him and maybe hanity and ingram i don't know the inside baseball
[2:52:03.260 --> 2:52:09.580]  they want to control they have over a thousand people that they pay $50,000 a year to $100,000
[2:52:09.580 --> 2:52:15.260]  a year to control them they call them pundits they tell people don't even say you're signed with us
[2:52:15.260 --> 2:52:20.620]  you're a paid pundit they say you can't go on other shows they call it threaten them so their pay
[2:52:20.620 --> 2:52:25.980]  is a $50,000 and they get to go on fox once a week and most of those people you see are paid
[2:52:25.980 --> 2:52:32.300]  to be under the stable of fox news or like donna brazil coming in i mean that should have been
[2:52:32.300 --> 2:52:37.740]  the first sign for people that it was something weird was going on you know when you bring her
[2:52:37.740 --> 2:52:43.260]  in to be a commentator but the one that rigged the debates yeah the rigged the debates gave hillary
[2:52:43.260 --> 2:52:48.780]  clinton the questions you know it just it doesn't and it's it's it's to come off to be fair and
[2:52:48.780 --> 2:52:54.620]  balanced but no none of the other networks are doing anything like that um you know so i just
[2:52:54.620 --> 2:53:01.420]  think we really are we really are under assault from these media corporations who are wanting
[2:53:01.420 --> 2:53:05.980]  to control they think they own a city they're not just lying media they control the censorship
[2:53:05.980 --> 2:53:10.140]  they say they control like you said that new york times we did like we will decide yeah it's the
[2:53:10.140 --> 2:53:15.980]  media who gets to declare the president you know no you don't uh first of all you think you've got
[2:53:15.980 --> 2:53:23.900]  so much power um but but see trump's so good and so real that just he uh he overturns their whole
[2:53:23.900 --> 2:53:27.180]  thing so they don't know what to do now i mean they have to do this leon yeah they have to steal
[2:53:27.180 --> 2:53:31.660]  this well and then so now is biden going to come out and say that he's the winner but then of course
[2:53:31.660 --> 2:53:35.580]  some of these other slower states are going to roll in and we'll find out no in fact he isn't
[2:53:35.580 --> 2:53:40.940]  the winner but then it's just going to create all of this confusion so that they can say trump's
[2:53:40.940 --> 2:53:46.540]  refusing to concede he's confusing or refusing to leave um this sets up the possibility for the
[2:53:46.540 --> 2:53:51.340]  military to go in and pull him out because we've already seen that we have a lot of trader traders
[2:53:51.340 --> 2:53:55.340]  in there who who lie on the and you know what this means for the lockdown it's going to get a lot
[2:53:55.340 --> 2:54:00.540]  worse everybody said oh as soon as biden wins it'll go away no once they get you in handcuffs baby
[2:54:00.540 --> 2:54:05.500]  you ain't you ain't ever getting out yeah now without a fight i mean they already have told us they're
[2:54:05.500 --> 2:54:11.580]  going to mask us up and lock us down so that's that's the plan that's what we're muzzle on
[2:54:12.700 --> 2:54:17.740]  doors locked on your knees nobody's are allowed to go and bell gates is coming with a special shot
[2:54:17.740 --> 2:54:23.020]  that they say don't kill granny but oh if if she does die you can't even go to her funeral
[2:54:23.020 --> 2:54:25.980]  you know you can't go you can't go see what's happened when we kill her in the hospital with
[2:54:25.980 --> 2:54:29.820]  a tube down her throat right you can't go visit her in the in the nursing home she's got to spend her
[2:54:29.820 --> 2:54:37.100]  last days uh her dying days alone separated from the family i mean it's just it's a pathetic
[2:54:37.100 --> 2:54:40.700]  existence that they're wanting to take us away from our human well they're going to start paying a
[2:54:40.700 --> 2:54:47.260]  lot of people are really tired of this and so uh man i gotta tell you though can you imagine lian
[2:54:47.260 --> 2:54:53.820]  the inauguration with that skeleton that that clown up there i mean watching and kamala cackling
[2:54:53.820 --> 2:55:00.620]  like a witch i'm gonna win i'm gonna be your next president literally installed literally because
[2:55:00.620 --> 2:55:06.060]  even the democratic voters rejected her rejected her it wasn't until for whatever reason president
[2:55:06.060 --> 2:55:11.020]  of former president obama came out and made a few phone calls and then all of a sudden the
[2:55:11.020 --> 2:55:15.100]  remaining democrats in the race dropped out and finally they were they were like all right joe
[2:55:15.100 --> 2:55:19.900]  biden he's the best one we've got let's he's the only one we have that can take out trump but i
[2:55:19.900 --> 2:55:24.220]  guess it's just because he's the only one compromising and he's gotta be a chinese agent well the other
[2:55:24.220 --> 2:55:28.220]  thing is he's been totally caught we're gonna we're gonna come back we got big breaking news
[2:55:28.220 --> 2:55:32.780]  trump campaign statement on michigan lawsuit trump campaign demands recount in wisconsin
[2:55:32.780 --> 2:55:37.180]  developing trump campaign to hold press conference in philadelphia 330 eastern standard
[2:55:40.140 --> 2:55:45.900]  there are many references in the holy bible to the mustard seed and why is that it's one of
[2:55:45.900 --> 2:55:52.300]  the tiniest seeds out there but a giant tree like bush grows from it that produces more mustard
[2:55:52.300 --> 2:55:58.060]  seeds mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects they
[2:55:58.060 --> 2:56:04.460]  didn't know why well with modern science we know it's one of the purest cleanest organic forms of
[2:56:04.460 --> 2:56:12.140]  selenium we have bio true selenium sold out for months back in stock at info wars store dot com

[2:56:36.780 --> 2:56:49.580]  store dot com and with free shipping
[2:56:51.100 --> 2:56:57.580]  you thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever but you rode upon a steamer
[2:56:57.580 --> 2:57:08.380]  to the violence of the sun broadcasting goodbye in defiance of global history
[2:57:13.420 --> 2:57:21.020]  gotta love that crane gotta love it uh seriously folks pastor gators and take over next segment
[2:57:21.020 --> 2:57:26.140]  and then we got the warm at 3 p.m. we covered all these live press conferences it was illegal it
[2:57:26.140 --> 2:57:29.820]  was unconstitutional to send out the 80 million ballots it was all done under the covetous area
[2:57:29.820 --> 2:57:33.340]  the democrats set our strategy will be hold it up and then count all these that come in
[2:57:34.060 --> 2:57:39.180]  they never even lied about it they were honest about the fraud and so if we let them take this
[2:57:39.180 --> 2:57:44.700]  election from us we deserve what we get and i'll say it again god is in control and you get trump
[2:57:44.700 --> 2:57:49.740]  and and and and and we reject it and and all the rest of it then you know we those little babies
[2:57:49.740 --> 2:57:54.380]  nobody came to save them when they were getting chopped up 60 million of them nobody stood up
[2:57:54.380 --> 2:57:57.900]  when the un you know was running around injecting people with sterilants and so
[2:57:58.540 --> 2:58:02.060]  you know i would hope we wake up and trump is reluctant we turn things around but
[2:58:03.260 --> 2:58:06.620]  but but but instead oh they take it away from us and then they really hurt us bad
[2:58:07.180 --> 2:58:10.540]  which the globalists have said they're gonna do so here's what the president said
[2:58:10.540 --> 2:58:15.020]  at like 3 30 in the morning and 30 minutes later exactly what he talked about of all the ballots
[2:58:15.020 --> 2:58:19.260]  being dumped and then the graphs going straight up because you know the a real organic rap is up
[2:58:19.260 --> 2:58:25.020]  and down and it's it's it's it's it's it's it's organic but artificial straight lines well these
[2:58:25.020 --> 2:58:30.780]  are straight lines it's 100 biden and that's what they did in a bunch of states and magic ballots
[2:58:30.780 --> 2:58:36.780]  just appeared they mean business and that's why i mean the vod in arizona they had fox announced
[2:58:36.780 --> 2:58:43.580]  oh they've lost trump's lost so people would then accept what was coming and now the key to all this
[2:58:43.580 --> 2:58:48.540]  is even the governors are like especially in in arizona like no actually looks like trump probably
[2:58:48.540 --> 2:58:54.540]  won so this is big time corruption ladies and gentlemen this is big time uh so the media has
[2:58:54.540 --> 2:58:59.500]  been discredited the system's been discredited though they need this win to try to resubmit
[2:58:59.500 --> 2:59:03.740]  that they've got power so you keep getting that corporate money it's about that money here's the
[2:59:03.740 --> 2:59:13.260]  president had to say carolina big victory with north carolina and so we won there we lead by
[2:59:13.260 --> 2:59:20.380]  76 000 votes with almost nothing left and all of a sudden everything just stopped
[2:59:22.140 --> 2:59:28.300]  this is a fraud on the american public this is an embarrassment to our country
[2:59:29.820 --> 2:59:35.420]  we were getting ready to win this election frankly we did win this election
[2:59:35.420 --> 2:59:43.980]  so our goal now is to ensure the integrity
[2:59:45.420 --> 2:59:51.020]  for the good of this nation this is a very big moment this is a major fraud in our nation
[2:59:51.980 --> 2:59:59.980]  we want the law to be used in a proper manner so we'll be going to the u.s supreme court
[2:59:59.980 --> 3:00:08.220]  right we want all voting to stop we don't want them to find any balance at four o'clock in the
[3:00:08.220 --> 3:00:17.740]  morning and then put the rest okay it's it's a very sad moment to me this is a very sad moment
[3:00:17.740 --> 3:00:23.180]  and we will win this and we'll be stars on this channel about eight months ago i began to play
[3:00:23.180 --> 3:00:28.860]  air raid sirens the start of every broadcast you know that why did i do that because we're in an
[3:00:28.860 --> 3:00:34.780]  emergency we're under attack and only by facing that can we turn this around vote fraud in michigan
[3:00:34.780 --> 3:00:41.420]  massive dump of over 200 000 ballots at biden all the sudden appear oversight update officials call
[3:00:41.420 --> 3:00:49.900]  it a typo but it isn't a typo but they have been caught red freaking handed we are right all of
[3:00:49.900 --> 3:00:54.700]  them for biden and there's just so many different tactics they have to steal this election one of
[3:00:54.700 --> 3:01:00.060]  those being calling the states early before the polls were even closed so they call arizona they
[3:01:00.060 --> 3:01:07.260]  call nevada oh what that does is it causes people who were going to vote in those states to stay home
[3:01:07.260 --> 3:01:11.260]  because we know conservatives are voting on the day i've left us before on average exactly that gives
[3:01:11.260 --> 3:01:15.340]  them that yeah that's that's election fixing right there that's that is total election meddling
[3:01:15.340 --> 3:01:18.460]  because you had the mail-in ballots that were already starting to be counted because they're
[3:01:18.460 --> 3:01:23.580]  scared on the west coast we were saying california might go red yeah oh i mean you see the 96 mile
[3:01:23.580 --> 3:01:31.820]  trump rally the trump train in nevada 96 miles of vehicles there with trump flags representing
[3:01:31.820 --> 3:01:37.660]  showing up so then if they call these states early anyone who's trying to go vote the day of
[3:01:37.660 --> 3:01:41.500]  maybe they're going to be a little bit dismayed they're going to think their vote doesn't matter
[3:01:41.500 --> 3:01:46.620]  why should i go wait in line for several hours because they've already called the state absolute
[3:01:46.620 --> 3:01:51.900]  election meddling there that's why you know your vote does matter you got to show up but how
[3:01:51.900 --> 3:01:57.500]  how incredible that even fox news would call it so early we were looking at the the numbers and the
[3:01:57.500 --> 3:02:02.540]  percentages last night just looking at each other like this is crazy why are they calling it it's 57
[3:02:02.540 --> 3:02:08.380]  percent trump why would they say it's provided and that was happening in multiple states and so i
[3:02:08.380 --> 3:02:15.740]  just think that the entire thing is just uh to to make people just comfortable with whatever they
[3:02:15.740 --> 3:02:21.420]  declare whoever they they declare to be the winner even if it doesn't make sense and let's explain
[3:02:21.420 --> 3:02:26.700]  that doesn't add up trump can come out and say this is a scam i i think i won the evidence shows he
[3:02:26.700 --> 3:02:32.300]  did but biden can say similar things that's okay right i mean again this is a total fraud all right
[3:02:32.300 --> 3:02:36.380]  i know you're taking a lot of calls in the war room we've got uh pastor gator's coming up here in
[3:02:36.380 --> 3:02:40.940]  just a moment here's trump campaign statement on michigan lawsuit his votes in michigan continue to
[3:02:40.940 --> 3:02:46.060]  be counted presidential race in the state remains extremely tight as we always knew it would be
[3:02:46.060 --> 3:02:49.980]  president trump's campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting
[3:02:49.980 --> 3:02:54.140]  locations to observe the opening of ballots the counting process is guaranteed by michigan law
[3:02:54.780 --> 3:02:59.980]  we have filed suit today in michigan court of claims to halt continuing until meaningful
[3:02:59.980 --> 3:03:04.620]  access can be granted we also demand to review those ballots which were opened and counted
[3:03:04.620 --> 3:03:08.940]  while we did not have meaningful access president trump is committed to ensuring that all legal
[3:03:08.940 --> 3:03:15.020]  votes are counted in michigan and everywhere else bill steven stephen trump 2020 campaign
[3:03:15.020 --> 3:03:20.540]  manager again trump campaign demands recount in wisconsin developing juliani campaign the whole
[3:03:20.540 --> 3:03:28.300]  press conference philadelphia pa 330 p.m eastern standard time so that's uh 230 and uh you know
[3:03:28.300 --> 3:03:32.460]  we always love our great guest coasts uh that come in here but they've always hit that warning
[3:03:32.460 --> 3:03:36.140]  that sometimes we've got to break away so gators has come up next segment but then we're gonna go
[3:03:36.140 --> 3:03:39.260]  to that juliani thing and he'll be able to come on after we get him on as the cast as well look
[3:03:39.260 --> 3:03:44.220]  forward to we have to say also root off juliani is in route to philly with legal team uh that's all
[3:03:44.220 --> 3:03:49.660]  coming up again biden campaign is aiming to declare victory by 4 p.m i'm just gonna end with
[3:03:49.660 --> 3:03:56.940]  this and hand it over to mr gators um i told everybody that the fix is in the enemy didn't
[3:03:56.940 --> 3:04:01.900]  put out these war plans they didn't prepare all this to play games okay and all hell's about
[3:04:01.900 --> 3:04:05.500]  the brake loose i think they're gonna run false flags to start a race war all sorts of horrible
[3:04:05.500 --> 3:04:11.100]  crap bishop larry gators will give you his take on this on the other side but these are the times
[3:04:11.100 --> 3:04:15.980]  that try everyone's souls and so just pray for america pray for the world pray for president
[3:04:15.980 --> 3:04:20.780]  trump pray that this evil be brought to light these hidden things be exposed i know pastor gators is
[3:04:20.780 --> 3:04:27.020]  about to cover that um this is all coming up we should probably get pastor gators back up uh
[3:04:27.020 --> 3:04:29.980]  tonight during the seven to nine i'll be up here with folk when we get him off for 30 minutes
[3:04:29.980 --> 3:04:33.340]  then as well as i want to cut into this time we really appreciate him and leon macadoo will be here
[3:04:33.340 --> 3:04:38.380]  as well but he'll come up next segment then we'll have the the uh press conference there with juliani
[3:04:38.380 --> 3:04:43.260]  this is also critical and then separately i'm not complaining and if it's god's will that's just the
[3:04:43.260 --> 3:04:47.180]  way it is the amount of money we brought in the last two or three days if i did that every day we
[3:04:47.180 --> 3:04:53.180]  go bankrupt about six months i'm not bitching we had millions of a new listeners yesterday millions

[3:07:42.220 --> 3:07:47.980]  them it's that simple and they'd use our open free society against us the controlled media will
[3:07:47.980 --> 3:07:53.020]  talk about a few mistakes i've made over the years and obsess over and say see he's a liar on purpose
[3:07:53.020 --> 3:07:58.860]  even though our success rate our accuracy rate is way way better than theirs we try to tell the truth
[3:07:58.860 --> 3:08:03.980]  they try a lot they try to deceive i'm trying to get people to realize that the globalists operate
[3:08:03.980 --> 3:08:10.060]  how they manipulate how they they have booze with the public i'm trying to get the public to ask
[3:08:10.060 --> 3:08:16.140]  questions and do not believe what they're told in the face i'm trying to get people to research
[3:08:16.140 --> 3:08:19.980]  for themselves the globalists and their controlled corporate press say that
[3:08:19.980 --> 3:08:26.140]  researching and not trusting media is evil and is a conspiracy theory but again on its face
[3:08:26.140 --> 3:08:31.500]  that is a fraud question everything question info wars add your own research to it and then
[3:08:31.500 --> 3:08:35.740]  decide what you're going to promote to others and what new sources are accurate i believe info
[3:08:35.740 --> 3:08:51.660]  wars the best source out there you're listening to the alex jones show

[3:10:01.100 --> 3:10:08.140]  so then i woke up this morning seeing joe sleepy creeping biden who can't remember his left foot
[3:10:08.140 --> 3:10:19.580]  from his right thumb taken the lead in the state of michigan this is a scam okay this is the biggest
[3:10:19.580 --> 3:10:27.900]  cootie talk in american political history now when you look at the family of joe biden when i was on
[3:10:27.900 --> 3:10:33.020]  the alex jones show a couple weeks ago and we talked about um the coming fall of the biden
[3:10:33.020 --> 3:10:42.940]  crime family how is it that you faith faith leaders faith-based pastors who are supposed to be pro-life
[3:10:43.820 --> 3:10:53.740]  but yet you are supporting a pro-death potential president joe biden is anti god anti christ
[3:10:53.740 --> 3:11:05.340]  anti bible anti america but yet you have pastors in michigan and wisconsin okay here in new york
[3:11:05.340 --> 3:11:12.540]  city and around the country supporting the most corrupted political leader in in the
[3:11:12.540 --> 3:11:20.060]  annals of american history and that is joe sleepy creeping biden now for the next four years god
[3:11:20.060 --> 3:11:29.180]  forbid if joe biden gets elected this is what this thing is going to bring the end of what we call
[3:11:29.180 --> 3:11:36.460]  the united states of america now i am not a prophet of of gloom and boom and destruction but my
[3:11:36.460 --> 3:11:45.340]  assignment during this next 30 minutes to 45 minutes is to break down this foundation this
[3:11:45.340 --> 3:11:51.420]  political and spiritual foundation concerning exposing the war against the invisible enemy
[3:11:52.380 --> 3:12:00.300]  this is what joe biden is going to do okay joe biden is going to shut down the churches
[3:12:01.180 --> 3:12:09.580]  joe biden is going to increase abortion on demand joe biden is going to attempt to destroy the first
[3:12:09.580 --> 3:12:20.220]  constitution from 1776 that was later ratified three times thereafter in 1781 87 in 89 by enacting
[3:12:20.860 --> 3:12:29.260]  the second constitution of 1871 that was put upon uh pressure put upon the united states of america
[3:12:30.140 --> 3:12:36.380]  by the roth chown dynasty out of great britain with the religious backing of the vatican order
[3:12:36.380 --> 3:12:47.740]  in 1871 through pope pious tonight had put undue pressure upon president ulysses s grant to destroy
[3:12:47.740 --> 3:12:58.620]  the first constitution of 1776 that was ratified three times thereafter in 1781 87 in 89 so then
[3:12:58.620 --> 3:13:07.260]  now we are called the united corporation of america so we were never designed patriots to be
[3:13:08.460 --> 3:13:17.500]  a corporation who were designed by god through the framers to be a christian constitutional
[3:13:17.500 --> 3:13:29.020]  republic but what i witnessed last night was nothing short of a coup you had joe biden who
[3:13:29.020 --> 3:13:38.940]  cannot remember his left foot from his right arm who cannot speak anything within a coherent sentence
[3:13:40.060 --> 3:13:45.260]  who has to be propped up every morning afternoon and when the sun goes down but yet
[3:13:45.260 --> 3:13:53.740]  you're telling me that more than half of the country is voting for this man this has brock
[3:13:53.740 --> 3:14:02.620]  hussein obama's handprints all over this brock obama doesn't care about joe biden brock obama
[3:14:02.620 --> 3:14:11.180]  cares about brock obama and there is no way and i want you guys to hear me today because there is
[3:14:11.180 --> 3:14:17.500]  a righteous indignation within bishop gators and to all of our patrons my name is bishop larry
[3:14:17.500 --> 3:14:22.620]  gators i am the host in the moderator of the nationally syndicated radio talk show global
[3:14:22.620 --> 3:14:27.500]  spiritual revolution radio through the eye heart radio network in the eye heart meter group here
[3:14:27.500 --> 3:14:34.700]  near exceeding new york we're also internationally syndicated through the w or 7 10 am family where
[3:14:34.700 --> 3:14:41.980]  we are reaching 200 million people around the world exposing the war against the invisible enemy
[3:14:43.980 --> 3:14:53.740]  when donald trump was elected four years ago there were multiple uh kudita attempts on his
[3:14:53.740 --> 3:15:03.260]  political life because of the russian hopes because of the fake dossier that was compiled
[3:15:03.260 --> 3:15:11.340]  by the forming mi6 agent christopher steele with the financial backing of the dnc through the clinton
[3:15:11.340 --> 3:15:20.300]  family through bonnie and clide bill and hillary clinton and hiring glenn r simpson of fusion gps
[3:15:21.500 --> 3:15:30.620]  to contort a story blaming the president for fixing the election and that didn't work and
[3:15:30.620 --> 3:15:39.420]  thereby from the russian hopes it brought us to the ukrainian hopes concerning the uranium one deal
[3:15:39.420 --> 3:15:47.900]  which president trump had nothing to do with president obama harry clinton sold 20 percent
[3:15:47.900 --> 3:15:56.380]  of our uranium to the russians and thereby barack obama who has a multi-million dollar home not
[3:15:56.380 --> 3:16:04.460]  just in the hamptons not just in chicago but also in washington dc why because he received millions
[3:16:04.460 --> 3:16:11.020]  of dollars from vladimir putin out of russia because of the uranium one deal including president
[3:16:11.020 --> 3:16:20.060]  obama letting out gangsters drug king pings and killers now joe biden is trying to take over
[3:16:20.060 --> 3:16:29.660]  the presidency and this is what's going to happen america will become a third world nation
[3:16:30.940 --> 3:16:37.740]  this is a righteous indignation within bishop gators again america will become a third world
[3:16:37.740 --> 3:16:43.340]  nation i don't blame those on the left because you know what these devils are going to do
[3:16:43.340 --> 3:16:54.620]  do i'm blaming you the pastors who were paid off by the biden campaign to succumb to the
[3:16:54.620 --> 3:17:01.500]  political pressure of the left now in the second segment of our fourth hour we're going to break
[3:17:01.500 --> 3:17:08.860]  down what happened last night and i want us patris to fight this all the way to the supreme court

[3:22:31.980 --> 3:22:39.100]  forbid if this devil joe biden gets in now as a side point it was joe biden who had given up
[3:22:39.100 --> 3:22:48.300]  uh numerous uh ci spies who were mowls within the chinese government joe biden is a compromise
[3:22:48.300 --> 3:22:53.580]  asset of the ministry of state security which is the chinese equivalent of the american ci
[3:22:54.940 --> 3:23:02.220]  now joe biden had said a few weeks ago during the town hall when he was asked by a mother concerning
[3:23:02.220 --> 3:23:10.940]  uh sex change operations for children joe biden said unequivocally that he would wholeheartedly
[3:23:10.940 --> 3:23:19.420]  and politically approve for eight-year-old children to become uh a sexual disoriented type
[3:23:19.420 --> 3:23:27.660]  of person in other words he's four in eight-year-old child a man a boy to be a girl in a girl to be
[3:23:27.660 --> 3:23:37.020]  a boy this is madness joe biden is going to open the borders again another words you're going to
[3:23:37.020 --> 3:23:42.700]  have all of the policies that are great president president donna j chump for the past three and
[3:23:42.700 --> 3:23:50.140]  a half almost four years those policies will be destroyed by the radical left joe biden is going
[3:23:50.140 --> 3:23:58.860]  to initiate this contact tracing bill that was written by congressman bobby rush out of the
[3:23:58.860 --> 3:24:04.460]  state of illinois bobby rush a former black panther who had his best friend frank hampton
[3:24:04.460 --> 3:24:13.660]  killed another time before another day so this contact tracing bill of hr 6666 that is promoted
[3:24:13.660 --> 3:24:20.540]  by bill gates through the bill and melinda robbing williams gates foundation is pushing for the federal
[3:24:20.540 --> 3:24:29.340]  government to enact into law a policy that will force the government to force their entry into
[3:24:29.340 --> 3:24:37.020]  your home and if you are tested positive for covet 19 excellent length their guys then you can be sent
[3:24:37.020 --> 3:24:43.260]  to a concentration camp there are fema cams all over the country right now as we speak
[3:24:43.260 --> 3:24:50.620]  through the federal emergency management agency on department here in the united states so joe
[3:24:50.620 --> 3:25:00.540]  biden who is pound for pound the most corrupt politician in american history whose son hunter
[3:25:00.540 --> 3:25:08.540]  is a raper of children but yet half of america they don't care about that they want this man
[3:25:08.540 --> 3:25:16.780]  to be voted into office and why they cause they hate donald trump so through this contact tracing
[3:25:16.780 --> 3:25:25.500]  bill of hr 6666 which is not only politically and financially supported by bill gates but also
[3:25:26.140 --> 3:25:32.700]  politically and financially supported by the former vice chairman of microsoft steed bomber
[3:25:32.700 --> 3:25:41.820]  steed bomber is now the owner of the los angeles clippers yes that steed bomber who was the same
[3:25:41.820 --> 3:25:47.820]  steed bomber who was the vice president and went on to be the chairman of microsoft and now who owns
[3:25:47.820 --> 3:25:54.860]  the l.a. clippers which 98 percent of their team are black men and it was melinda robbing william
[3:25:54.860 --> 3:26:00.620]  gates said that black america would be the first ethnicity to receive the vaccination
[3:26:00.620 --> 3:26:07.580]  it what was she saying she was saying that black people are going to be the first ones to be
[3:26:08.540 --> 3:26:15.020]  exterminated this is what you're going to get with joe biden now i'm going to say this and it
[3:26:15.020 --> 3:26:22.060]  may sound may sound harsh but listen to what the bishop has to say concerning exposing the war
[3:26:22.060 --> 3:26:31.740]  war again seeing visible enemy if you allow joe biden americans to become president anything
[3:26:31.740 --> 3:26:41.260]  that happens in the next four years you deserve it let me say this again if you allow joe biden
[3:26:41.820 --> 3:26:50.380]  block with a thousand different alices obama in the radical left to assume power anything
[3:26:50.380 --> 3:26:59.100]  that happens to this country we deserve it so joe biden is going to initiate this hr 6666
[3:26:59.100 --> 3:27:09.100]  program in connection to microsoft including the activation of the 2020 wo 0600606 deal
[3:27:10.060 --> 3:27:19.340]  this cryptocurrency data activating system joe biden is a manchurian candidate let me say this
[3:27:19.340 --> 3:27:28.860]  again joseph robinette biden who may very well be a clone i don't know okay he is a controlled asset
[3:27:29.740 --> 3:27:40.140]  and why is it for the life of me that spiritual leaders pastors who are supposed to be pro-life
[3:27:40.140 --> 3:27:48.060]  and a lot of you are african-american pastors but you're voting for a man who is backing for the
[3:27:48.060 --> 3:27:59.900]  extermination of not only babies but also black children since 1973 close to 19 million black babies
[3:27:59.900 --> 3:28:08.620]  have been slaughtered why because of this witch marquess anchor marquess anchor once said and i
[3:28:08.620 --> 3:28:17.740]  quote that black america must be exterminated as human weeds this is the sign of joe biden
[3:28:18.860 --> 3:28:26.700]  joe biden said to you black americans you ain't black if you're going to vote for donna j
[3:28:26.700 --> 3:28:35.100]  trump this is the same joe biden who signed the bill in 1974 promoting busing segregation
[3:28:35.100 --> 3:28:43.580]  between black and white kids this is the same joseph robinette biden who then 20 years later
[3:28:43.580 --> 3:28:55.100]  from 1974 to 1994 co-wrote along with bonnie and clive bill and harry clinton the 1994 crime bill
[3:28:55.100 --> 3:29:05.020]  which put 2.7 million black men in prison that at the time between 1994 and the year 2000
[3:29:05.900 --> 3:29:15.500]  was 10 percent of the black male population so why are you black people voting for joe biden
[3:29:15.500 --> 3:29:24.300]  and especially the preachers pastors you can't have it both ways you can't say that your pro
[3:29:24.300 --> 3:29:31.660]  life that yet you're voting for the complete opposite of what you believe in as a theologian
[3:29:31.660 --> 3:29:41.180]  you cannot have it both ways pastors you cannot vote for joe biden who is pro-death but you yet
[3:29:41.180 --> 3:29:47.260]  are remaining pro-life it doesn't work like that now during the third segment we're going to break
[3:29:47.260 --> 3:29:55.340]  this down even further that god forbid if joe robinette biden wins this election by default
[3:29:55.340 --> 3:30:03.100]  because he cheated his way these are the repercussions that's going to happen to america
[3:30:03.100 --> 3:30:08.700]  concerning exposing the war against the invisible enemy this is your host and moderated bishop
[3:30:08.700 --> 3:30:14.460]  layer gators during the fourth hour of the alex jones show and we see you here in the next two
[3:30:14.460 --> 3:30:24.620]  to three minutes time
[3:30:24.620 --> 3:30:32.620]  you
[3:30:34.860 --> 3:30:40.300]  look it up for yourself the head of the devos group issued a report more than six months ago calling
[3:30:40.300 --> 3:30:46.780]  for world government to be openly established to respond to covid-19 the covid-19 was a blessing
[3:30:46.780 --> 3:30:53.020]  to lower the planet's carbon footprint since then prince charles and countless others have come out
[3:30:53.020 --> 3:31:00.940]  and said the exact same thing the most ancient form of total war is called siege and that's when
[3:31:00.940 --> 3:31:07.020]  you cut people off from their resources that's when you lock them down and this isn't siege to
[3:31:07.020 --> 3:31:10.780]  make us capitulate to the globalist or just get rid of Donald Trump that's only part of it this is
[3:31:10.780 --> 3:31:17.020]  siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt so then the globalist social
[3:31:17.020 --> 3:31:23.420]  engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social credit score surveillance trip so you've
[3:31:23.420 --> 3:31:27.660]  heard the u.s. army saying our job is to kill people and break things well that's what the
[3:31:27.660 --> 3:31:31.740]  lockdown's doing it's starving the third world millions and millions of debt it's breaking down

[3:31:50.140 --> 3:31:54.940]  and once the establishment has that predatory idea civilization collapses very very quickly you
[3:31:54.940 --> 3:32:00.860]  can't treat the least of us like garbage and not treat your own family like that and so it is this
[3:32:00.860 --> 3:32:06.220]  lack of empathy that's going to destroy us the globalists can try to be heartless devil worshipers

[3:32:16.780 --> 3:32:21.820]  not feel it themselves but the repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and

[3:35:18.460 --> 3:35:26.060]  going to happen for the next four years god forbid if joe biden becomes elected and thereby steals
[3:35:26.060 --> 3:35:33.420]  this election he's going to have those of antifa who are the military arm of black lives matter
[3:35:33.420 --> 3:35:40.860]  and black lives matter is the propaganda arm of antifa led by three stinking witches now you

[3:36:01.500 --> 3:36:08.540]  to overthrow the united states of america through tyranny through discombobulation so if joe biden
[3:36:08.540 --> 3:36:16.860]  who's a white house whose presidency would be hijacked not only by antifa in black lives matter
[3:36:16.860 --> 3:36:27.580]  but also would be hijacked by the lgbtq rs community including the squad led by a former bar

[3:36:47.340 --> 3:36:54.540]  these four witches that you see right now these are witches they're not witches because they're
[3:36:54.540 --> 3:37:01.020]  women and they're not witches because they are women of color ladies and gentlemen they are
[3:37:01.020 --> 3:37:11.100]  witches because they're operating under a spirit that is not a god concerning exposing the war
[3:37:11.100 --> 3:37:19.260]  against the invisible enemy including no don't be surprised if um president biden brings in a
[3:37:19.260 --> 3:37:27.580]  little kid by the name of gretta funberg to initiate on the climate control policy this is madness
[3:37:27.580 --> 3:37:36.380]  here but who i blame not so much barack obama because we know he's a devil i don't blame uh

[3:38:08.300 --> 3:38:14.700]  is to destroy america and that's joe biden and so also god quavid if joe biden gets in
[3:38:14.700 --> 3:38:26.140]  it he is going to ship your jobs overseas by uh re and nafting nafta that president bill clinton
[3:38:26.940 --> 3:38:33.100]  in his witch of a wife hillary had instituted during the 1990s during the clinton administration

[3:38:41.420 --> 3:38:50.780]  your jobs overseas and the entire united states for these america will end up like baltimore
