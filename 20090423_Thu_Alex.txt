[11:07.080 --> 11:12.960]  can carry to humans like water still operating in Iraq under new name I ran
[11:12.960 --> 11:18.840]  warrants of mock assassination rings so the United States has hit teams in there
[11:18.840 --> 11:22.720]  trying to destabilize the country and Israel the United States admit they're
[11:22.720 --> 11:26.760]  doing that you imagine if Iran admitted they had hit teams killing
[11:26.760 --> 11:32.960]  officials in the u.s. what would happen giant airstrikes on Iran but the
[11:32.960 --> 11:41.760]  globalists do it I ran and it's just incredible so we'll go over that also
[11:41.760 --> 11:49.160]  Senate report rice Cheney okayed CIA use of waterboarding we already knew this
[11:49.160 --> 11:56.120]  but now it's mainstream news CIA ludicrously claims torture prevented
[11:56.120 --> 12:02.400]  debunked la terror plot this is story from prison planet calm and Paul Watson
[12:02.400 --> 12:07.080]  really a recap what reported years ago remember he had been this was about last
[12:07.080 --> 12:14.120]  year Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been held for more than six years they were
[12:14.120 --> 12:19.600]  waterboarding him three times a day for years that's that's been admitted and it
[12:19.600 --> 12:23.600]  took them six plus years of torture and they finally started threatening
[12:23.600 --> 12:27.360]  tortures kids and that's the they're saying now they threaten to torture
[12:27.360 --> 12:32.480]  not coming out they may have put them in boxes with spiders and things but the
[12:32.480 --> 12:38.080]  point is yeah it's out of Hellraiser that then he said look I'll say whatever
[12:38.080 --> 12:40.800]  you want and they had him confessed because they have total contempt for
[12:40.800 --> 12:44.480]  the American people they had him confessed to things that happened four
[12:44.480 --> 12:49.320]  years after he was in custody and the bombing buildings that weren't built
[12:49.320 --> 12:54.040]  till three years after he was in custody and they still say he bombed those
[12:54.040 --> 13:01.800]  buildings that weren't built yet when he was captured so and then the media has
[13:01.800 --> 13:06.280]  the nerve to go look at Iran they we don't really like their court system
[13:06.280 --> 13:11.360]  over there she may have confessed and it was a public trial but it's not a fair
[13:11.360 --> 13:15.680]  system we need to bomb them they've they've grabbed an American reporter in
[13:15.680 --> 13:19.760]  Tehran and convicted her for eight years
[13:19.760 --> 13:24.280]  meanwhile Congresswoman Bragg that foreign spy agencies basically run them
[13:24.280 --> 13:31.400]  and it's oh that's okay go ahead you know it's okay if that's happening I mean
[13:31.400 --> 13:35.760]  it's just total hypocrisy oh we secretly grab people and torture them and their
[13:35.760 --> 13:41.520]  kids for years and that's good but we don't like your system of courts we're
[13:41.520 --> 13:46.920]  gonna we ought to bomb you and you believe them those backwards people all
[13:46.920 --> 13:52.800]  over there they actually give people somewhat fair trials the outrage of it
[13:52.800 --> 13:57.840]  here we just torture you water board you three times a year three times a day
[13:57.840 --> 14:08.400]  year after year oh man just amazing explosive Senate report reveals what
[14:08.400 --> 14:12.600]  we've already known for three and a half years massive continual torture we'll
[14:12.600 --> 14:25.240]  go over that China deflection able muscle in unprecedented show biggest lie of
[14:25.240 --> 14:31.280]  2009 Hillary claims Obama has followed words with actions in her testimony
[14:31.280 --> 14:36.120]  yesterday before the house she said he has done everything he said he would do
[14:36.120 --> 14:41.360]  including cutting the budget the list goes on and on ladies and gentlemen he
[14:41.360 --> 14:46.280]  has spent more money in two months in two weeks a hundred days two and a half
[14:46.280 --> 14:52.880]  months he has spent more money in giving it to foreign offshore banks than all
[14:52.880 --> 14:58.240]  budgets of all presidents combined that's a fact it doesn't matter Hillary
[14:58.240 --> 15:09.200]  says he's cut the budget it wouldn't it'd be funny if I wasn't so sick oh man I
[15:09.200 --> 15:12.960]  you know I see these reports literally four or five times a week I never cover
[15:12.960 --> 15:18.080]  them in the US and Canada and England autistic kids retarded kids getting
[15:18.080 --> 15:23.600]  tasered getting beat up getting beat to death getting shot and I just saw this
[15:23.600 --> 15:26.880]  one this is one where at least they didn't hurt him I mean the guy's so
[15:26.880 --> 15:33.600]  autistic I mean he looks obviously like he's got serious mental deficiencies
[15:33.600 --> 15:37.520]  here doesn't matter walking home they say you're not supposed to be walking
[15:37.520 --> 15:43.560]  home he didn't respond he looked funny to the police yeah I mean he's the
[15:43.560 --> 15:47.160]  government already hurt him enough I mean it's just your mommy did what the
[15:47.160 --> 15:51.480]  government said and gave him the shots I mean that isn't enough for you that
[15:51.480 --> 15:55.600]  brain inflammation enough and now they took him to jail for a couple days no
[15:55.600 --> 15:59.760]  phone call she thought he'd been kidnapped or something so good job on
[15:59.760 --> 16:05.040]  that so I'd mention it mayor supports chief's restriction and interest of
[16:05.040 --> 16:12.400]  public safety this is out of Milwaukee WISN TV it says you're allowed to have
[16:12.400 --> 16:17.520]  guns but the police chief says you're not even though there's no law in the
[16:17.520 --> 16:22.360]  mayor says he backs the chief on that so we'll just hey there's no law but we
[16:22.360 --> 16:28.200]  say and we got the guns so sit out and shut up and look at their watches the
[16:28.200 --> 16:31.400]  bank robbery goes on they go oh we've already stolen so much there's no way
[16:31.400 --> 16:35.680]  you'll ever fix it but we're gonna steal even more gonna put you even more in
[16:35.680 --> 16:41.000]  debt and now the paramilitary forces will enforce that you know I was thinking
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.760]  about it how every day I Google it in the morning and I see news articles about
[16:46.760 --> 16:51.000]  the military around a checkpoint here a checkpoint there the Marines running DWI
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.440]  checkpoints of the army running checkpoints are you know towns and
[16:54.440 --> 16:59.600]  cities and hamlets and parishes going oh yeah the armies put a couple of
[16:59.600 --> 17:05.520]  military intel officers as liaison officers and are in the police office
[17:05.520 --> 17:09.560]  and they help us with intelligence gathering now they're not they're not
[17:09.560 --> 17:15.200]  arresting citizens they just they just go out and advise the police and help with
[17:15.200 --> 17:20.880]  the citizens high treason total police state total covert takeover and then
[17:20.880 --> 17:24.360]  they're putting military intel in the media and military intel in your local
[17:24.360 --> 17:37.120]  environmental groups and I mean it's chilling it is it is bracing to know
[17:37.120 --> 17:46.600]  that all of this is going on it really is I mean it's really happening they
[17:46.600 --> 17:53.040]  really do have a covert operation for the covert takeover of the United
[17:53.040 --> 18:03.760]  States more sophisticated but similar to the way Western governments and the
[18:03.760 --> 18:09.280]  Soviets previously took over hundreds of third world and old world and first
[18:09.280 --> 18:16.840]  world nations that they ran covert option and they admit they're doing they
[18:16.840 --> 18:21.840]  say Congress does no authority over anything now the legislators don't PDD
[18:21.840 --> 18:27.760]  51 John Ward defense authorization act all of them they are announcing in plain
[18:27.760 --> 18:32.320]  view hey army intel runs the local environmental groups well they're here
[18:32.320 --> 18:37.520]  to help I mean you know oh yeah the groups made up of army intel they're here
[18:37.520 --> 18:41.880]  making sure you I don't overwater your yard and they're gonna be running
[18:41.880 --> 18:49.720]  community taxes on carbon well what's wrong with that you know there this is
[18:49.720 --> 18:55.240]  freedom and yeah public schools all over the country just are training the
[18:55.240 --> 18:59.000]  children how to tattle on their parents and how to watch their neighbors and
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.440]  starting in the sixth grade nationwide they have a law enforcement class they
[19:03.440 --> 19:07.280]  give kids and parents sign their kids up to the oh that sounds fun you'll take
[19:07.280 --> 19:12.600]  that class and a lot of schools it's not elective though you have to and it says
[19:12.600 --> 19:19.280]  oh you write dossiers on your parents and what they do on a computer and then
[19:19.280 --> 19:23.440]  that's filed and it's a federal grant for the classes in your local school and
[19:23.440 --> 19:26.920]  then they have federal dossiers on mommy and daddy written by the sixth graders

[26:02.360 --> 26:06.880]  is about breaking people's backs and it's in the government documents it's in
[26:06.880 --> 26:13.320]  the UN documents IMF World Bank documents this is what they do they really
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.520]  have your bad interest at heart they really want you enslaved that's what

[26:25.840 --> 26:28.600]  things get worse they have a new solution that only makes it worse and
[26:28.600 --> 26:31.440]  then people follow that solution and then it gets worse and they got another
[26:31.440 --> 26:36.480]  solution then it gets worse leading you down that path JC in Florida than John
[26:36.480 --> 26:44.640]  Barbara Matt and on JC go ahead okay JC's not there let's go ahead and go to
[26:44.640 --> 26:49.680]  John in Tennessee John you're on the air how are you doing it's been a little
[26:49.680 --> 26:54.320]  while since I called in but there's few things I really wanted to go ahead touch
[26:54.320 --> 26:59.080]  on this off did you have you covered the the Supreme Court case about the the
[26:59.080 --> 27:02.200]  third-year-old honor student that was kept searched I was being argued this
[27:02.200 --> 27:07.120]  week there's a member that all over the country they've been strip searching
[27:07.120 --> 27:11.600]  people can you turn your radio off hold on just a minute just a minute can you
[27:11.600 --> 27:17.800]  turn your radio off I'm on a cell phone okay well something's echoing back okay
[27:17.800 --> 27:24.640]  sorry yes I am aware of the case of the Supreme Court hearing the strip search
[27:24.640 --> 27:29.840]  at the school what happened with the case well I don't know if it's been
[27:29.840 --> 27:33.920]  decided yet but in the argument it was basically she was accused of having a
[27:33.920 --> 27:41.480]  an aspirin and that's that's all and they I remember yeah yeah she she wasn't
[27:41.480 --> 27:45.640]  she caught giving a friend an aspirin and then they would not she wasn't caught
[27:45.640 --> 27:50.960]  a friend that he said was not really even a her friend anymore told that
[27:50.960 --> 27:54.160]  somebody got caught the aspirin and then a friend that wasn't really a friend
[27:54.160 --> 27:58.040]  said that oh she's the one that had it and she said that you know they said
[27:58.040 --> 28:00.480]  they searched the backpack they searched her clothes that's right they
[28:00.480 --> 28:05.520]  stausied they stausied her and then even when they said you know what yeah I guys
[28:05.520 --> 28:08.960]  print me the aspirin strip search case so I know the facts because I forget it
[28:08.960 --> 28:13.760]  but here you go ahead and tell me what happened okay then they made her I'm
[28:13.760 --> 28:18.860]  actually pulled down her to open up her bra they shake out the bra and they
[28:18.860 --> 28:22.840]  shake out the crotch of her panties and get told humiliations to the honor
[28:22.840 --> 28:29.080]  student and I'm in the in the case in the argument the the Supreme Court was
[28:29.080 --> 28:31.520]  with that it's not like they're with the justice is we're saying okay well this
[28:31.520 --> 28:34.120]  sounds like it's too much in this case but then the within when they were
[28:34.120 --> 28:38.560]  interviewing for ACLU or they're saying well what about in methamphetamine
[28:38.560 --> 28:41.440]  there shouldn't be could there be some cases where we could do this so they
[28:41.440 --> 28:45.720]  it looks like they might rule against the school district in this case with a
[28:45.720 --> 28:49.600]  kind of set of precedent to say well maybe in future cases it's gonna be okay
[28:49.600 --> 28:53.160]  what I could tell well that's what the Supreme Court did they said oh you've
[28:53.160 --> 28:58.560]  got a second amendment right but it can be restricted by law and so Obama said
[28:58.560 --> 29:02.680]  yeah I can ban all your guns the second amendment means I ban your guns and
[29:02.680 --> 29:06.240]  that's what the holder and everybody else has been saying it gives us the
[29:06.240 --> 29:11.280]  right to ban your guns you have a right to hand them over and yeah I mean they
[29:11.280 --> 29:15.680]  do that in case after case those they'll say yes it's wrong they strip search
[29:15.680 --> 29:20.280]  this little girl but sometimes we can strip search you and there's been a
[29:20.280 --> 29:25.240]  bunch of these cases they've even had cases where men strip search girls and
[29:25.240 --> 29:30.240]  they just say that's the way it is we well I mean they're putting cameras in
[29:30.240 --> 29:35.840]  boys and girls showers in public schools in one case in Tennessee the
[29:35.840 --> 29:41.160]  visiting girls basketball team went in and saw cameras in the showers ran out
[29:41.160 --> 29:45.640]  screaming it was a big scene and they said well we video type your neck a dog

[33:42.400 --> 33:47.040]  old girl and it goes through the liberal and conservative justices from
[33:47.040 --> 33:51.240]  court watchers reports saying they agreed with it and they said it's
[33:51.240 --> 33:57.000]  reasonable and so they said that that's what these prison camps are for it's
[33:57.000 --> 34:08.200]  to strip search 13-year-old honor students now remember what the head of
[34:08.200 --> 34:17.240]  the NSA many became head of the CIA Hayden said when he got questioned by
[34:17.240 --> 34:20.680]  constitutional lawyer at press conference he said the fourth amendment
[34:20.680 --> 34:23.680]  says that you've got to have overathermation particular place in
[34:23.680 --> 34:27.840]  person's to be searched with you know listing what's being searched for and
[34:27.840 --> 34:32.120]  you've got to have a warrant from a judge and that that's probable cause and
[34:32.120 --> 34:38.240]  then that's the definition and he said no all we have to do the government has
[34:38.240 --> 34:41.360]  to think it's reasonable any age no government can just say it's reasonable
[34:41.360 --> 34:46.120]  and the lawyer said that's not what the fourth amendment says well that's what
[34:46.120 --> 34:51.560]  the Supreme Court said and so they were having arguments with the lawyers for
[34:51.560 --> 34:57.120]  and con no more fourth amendment pro and con and that's what they said but let me
[34:57.120 --> 35:01.280]  just turn to the fourth amendment itself I've pretty much got it memorized but

[37:19.120 --> 37:23.440]  put you in the prison system it literally is the girl was forced to strip
[37:23.440 --> 37:27.320]  down to her brawn panties while school officials looked for an aspirin
[37:27.320 --> 37:32.040]  substitute ibuprofen so they even knew it was supposedly and folks they sent
[37:32.040 --> 37:36.400]  kids to juvie hall for aspirin moms don't know send them aspirin or something
[37:36.400 --> 37:40.560]  it's in their lunchbox but they arrested a girl a few weeks ago for giving
[37:40.560 --> 37:45.240]  somebody a Ludens it had no drugs not even menthol in it was the type that was
[37:45.240 --> 37:51.120]  just really a candy will you google girl arrested for a cough drop things because
[37:51.120 --> 37:55.560]  this is a prison their job is to get you in the system right here in Austin
[37:55.560 --> 37:59.520]  you're late to class three times they charge you with truancy it matter the
[37:59.520 --> 38:03.400]  losses that's not truancy then they call the dad's in the mom's into the
[38:03.400 --> 38:08.560]  little portable building where they have court every week and they threaten them
[38:08.560 --> 38:12.680]  they say sign this or I'll take your kids and the dad signs them through a
[38:12.680 --> 38:16.760]  furred adjudication deferred adjudication waving their rights
[38:16.760 --> 38:21.160]  contractually into probation now they got them and then they're paid off it's
[38:21.160 --> 38:26.520]  on record all over the country the judges and uh... even their lawyers are paid
[38:26.520 --> 38:28.840]  school officials have been caught as well
[38:28.840 --> 38:30.400]  as a nationwide
[38:30.400 --> 38:34.640]  putting here in austin but they don't care the felonies just going on a bed
[38:34.640 --> 38:38.640]  and they they are paid by the private juvie halls
[38:38.640 --> 38:42.920]  and the private foster homes that get and that's why immediately when they get
[38:42.920 --> 38:46.160]  your kid sixty seven percent of the time even when they're in they put them on
[38:46.160 --> 38:47.960]  prozac or one of those drugs
[38:47.960 --> 38:51.560]  because then your child is mentally ill and instead of getting
[38:51.560 --> 38:55.040]  four five thousand dollars a month and then they barely feed them and so
[38:55.040 --> 38:57.560]  you know that the person keeps about two grand of that
[38:57.560 --> 38:59.800]  they're getting ten twelve fifteen
[38:59.800 --> 39:01.440]  and then the cash flows
[39:01.440 --> 39:02.880]  and then the payoffs are made
[39:02.880 --> 39:04.720]  and that's on record that's that's done
[39:04.720 --> 39:09.000]  and that's how they roll and they'll continue rolling
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.360]  uh... just living around pure criminals running everything other just as her
[39:12.360 --> 39:17.080]  arguments in the case of savannah ready who was an eighth grade honor student
[39:17.080 --> 39:21.360]  in the late summer two thousand and three in the small community of
[39:21.360 --> 39:23.040]  shafford arizona
[39:23.040 --> 39:26.320]  despite having a history with no disciplinary problems
[39:26.320 --> 39:29.160]  the girl was forced to strip down their brawn panties will school officials
[39:29.160 --> 39:29.920]  looked
[39:29.920 --> 39:32.600]  for an aspirin substitute i'd be proud of any of you and this is kind of a
[39:32.600 --> 39:35.400]  whitewash that she may or pull the panties down for that on the news
[39:35.400 --> 39:36.920]  another girl

[39:38.840 --> 39:41.160]  uh... truck
[39:41.160 --> 39:44.200]  they really don't call it aspirin they call it the drug

[40:00.760 --> 40:03.400]  uh... ready was also forced to pull her
[40:03.400 --> 40:06.240]  her brawn panties away from her skin all they they did tell the truth in her
[40:06.240 --> 40:08.200]  sorry i read that yet
[40:08.200 --> 40:09.320]  shaking them
[40:09.320 --> 40:11.720]  to show they contain no pills
[40:11.720 --> 40:15.800]  but exposing her breast to public area yet was a bunch of enjoying themselves
[40:15.800 --> 40:18.800]  what do you think it's in the schooling i mean well most of our normal but the
[40:18.800 --> 40:20.640]  pervs are also there
[40:20.640 --> 40:24.600]  on average five to one it's above five times many pervs in schooling
[40:24.600 --> 40:27.280]  as truancy officers as juby hall people
[40:27.280 --> 40:31.280]  as cps is any other group where do you think smart pervs go
[40:31.280 --> 40:33.960]  so they're always getting caught
[40:33.960 --> 40:37.480]  another girl had been found with the drug of the drug that blamed
[40:37.480 --> 40:38.720]  ready for giving a tour
[40:38.720 --> 40:42.080]  ready was also forced to pull her brawn panties away from her skin
[40:42.080 --> 40:44.440]  shaking them to show they contain no pills
[40:44.440 --> 40:46.760]  exposing her breast to public area
[40:46.760 --> 40:48.360]  the federal appeals court said
[40:48.360 --> 40:49.720]  the federal
[40:49.720 --> 40:53.160]  appeals court ruled the search was unconstitutional well they've been over
[40:53.160 --> 40:55.880]  ruled haven't they and school officials had no immunity
[40:55.880 --> 40:58.600]  from a lawsuit fall on behalf of the girl
[40:58.600 --> 40:59.840]  but in an argument
[40:59.840 --> 41:00.920]  to the
[41:00.920 --> 41:05.240]  even traditionally liberal supreme court justice is over so liberal
[41:05.240 --> 41:09.600]  appeared ready to concede that the threat of drugs the government ships and
[41:09.600 --> 41:13.000]  and the brutal and pros that are pushing on but the threat of aspirin
[41:13.000 --> 41:14.080]  not problem
[41:14.080 --> 41:18.840]  outweigh the threat of embarrassment
[41:18.840 --> 41:21.360]  scott u.s. blood reported
[41:21.360 --> 41:24.600]  though the obama administration lawyer in civil liberties
[41:24.600 --> 41:27.960]  attorney argue that strip searches should be strictly limited to see how they
[41:27.960 --> 41:29.640]  spent their arguing for it
[41:29.640 --> 41:31.120]  they say to be strictly limited
[41:31.120 --> 41:33.540]  even liberal justice david suitor
[41:33.540 --> 41:36.520]  suggested readings or deal was acceptable under the fourth amendment
[41:36.520 --> 41:37.800]  which bands
[41:37.800 --> 41:41.600]  unreasonable searches see how they
[41:41.600 --> 41:45.040]  go and i mean soon they'll just say one word searches for them it says we search
[41:45.040 --> 41:45.440]  you
[41:45.440 --> 41:47.160]  he says searches there
[41:47.160 --> 41:49.160]  so they take out a context
[41:49.160 --> 41:52.960]  uh... sooner said from the bench in the school officials thought
[41:52.960 --> 41:54.520]  process was
[41:54.520 --> 41:56.360]  i'd rather have a kid embarrassed
[41:56.360 --> 41:57.240]  rather than
[41:57.240 --> 42:00.400]  some kid be dead although he has from the aspirin
[42:00.400 --> 42:02.640]  it's that reasonable under the fourth amendment
[42:02.640 --> 42:05.360]  and now they're talking about arresting kids that sneak peanuts to school because
[42:05.360 --> 42:06.800]  you know that can kill the kids because
[42:06.800 --> 42:10.280]  they give you all the shots that make a lot of mean problems and you know
[42:10.280 --> 42:13.240]  uh... liberal justice of steven bryer
[42:13.240 --> 42:15.920]  uh... said uh... the key
[42:15.920 --> 42:17.080]  swing vote
[42:17.080 --> 42:19.360]  justice anthony kennedy
[42:19.360 --> 42:20.880]  also appeared ready to
[42:20.880 --> 42:22.520]  consider the search reasonable
[42:22.520 --> 42:26.600]  the website said supreme court's rule in the case before it's summer recess so
[42:26.600 --> 42:29.280]  i said i get your call the caller brings up a big deal
[42:29.280 --> 42:33.360]  so thanks for bringing that to our attention
[42:33.360 --> 42:36.840]  the ns a could never legally spy on you about a war before but now they say
[42:36.840 --> 42:39.320]  well we don't need no stinking warrants
[42:39.320 --> 42:42.440]  it means reasonable and we've decided it's not
[42:42.440 --> 42:45.440]  unreasonable
[42:45.440 --> 42:52.320]  it doesn't matter what the fourth amendment says in clear english
[42:52.320 --> 42:55.520]  they say it's okay they say tortures okay now
[42:55.520 --> 42:56.560]  or they say
[42:56.560 --> 42:59.680]  and put the kid in a box with spiders or
[42:59.680 --> 43:03.880]  waterboarding somebody drowning them three times a day is not torture you know
[43:03.880 --> 43:06.800]  raping somebody's wife in front of us not torture
[43:06.800 --> 43:10.600]  they go and you're right it's not side jack bowers a hero and he's dropping
[43:10.600 --> 43:12.480]  people's fingers off on tv and
[43:12.480 --> 43:15.560]  he gets the answers and we all fantasize about it and live through him so you
[43:15.560 --> 43:18.480]  know
[43:18.480 --> 43:22.400]  they're out of the people to be secure in their persons

[43:35.600 --> 43:37.720]  above probable cause
[43:37.720 --> 43:41.000]  supported by other affirmation a particularly describing the place to be
[43:41.000 --> 43:41.800]  searched
[43:41.800 --> 43:43.720]  and the person's are things to be seized
[43:43.720 --> 43:46.680]  i guess while she was in their clutches waving your rights in the
[43:46.680 --> 43:51.680]  schools have argued in federal state court they are your children
[43:51.680 --> 43:54.480]  they could have held her there till they got a warrant
[43:54.480 --> 43:59.160]  and then had a female juvenile officer and boy you know who they are
[43:59.160 --> 44:01.080]  and like little girls do you

[44:52.000 --> 44:54.800]  particularly describing the place to be searched in the person's are things to be
[44:54.800 --> 44:55.600]  seized
[44:55.600 --> 44:57.720]  they gotta have a judge
[44:57.720 --> 44:59.120]  but not anymore they go
[44:59.120 --> 45:02.760]  and we don't need no stinking warrant to take your blood at checkpoints and they
[45:02.760 --> 45:05.480]  lose lawsuits all over the country federal grants
[45:05.480 --> 45:07.680]  to have the cops take blood at checkpoints they go okay
[45:07.680 --> 45:09.480]  will have a judge issue
[45:09.480 --> 45:11.580]  a mass warrant

[45:25.560 --> 45:29.760]  all right there you go it's all trees and it's all criminal
[45:29.760 --> 45:32.320]  and they're just gonna push and push and push
[45:32.320 --> 45:35.560]  because criminals run the government and they're shipping in the drugs
[45:35.560 --> 45:37.840]  and making money on the other side putting people in prison they're
[45:37.840 --> 45:38.800]  dumb enough to use it
[45:38.800 --> 45:41.760]  while they push all the legal drugs are even worse than illegal drugs on the
[45:41.760 --> 45:42.400]  kids
[45:42.400 --> 45:47.520]  and now they say they want to forcibly put all women who have babies on drugs
[45:47.520 --> 45:54.020]  standard mentally ill for six months after they have a baby

[48:28.560 --> 48:30.720]  friendly homeschooling state
[48:30.720 --> 48:32.240]  and uh...
[48:32.240 --> 48:33.680]  as a matter of fact
[48:33.680 --> 48:36.080]  it's very friendly a lot of people
[48:36.080 --> 48:38.040]  can actually receive money
[48:38.040 --> 48:40.640]  from the state to um... homeschool
[48:40.640 --> 48:41.560]  of which
[48:41.560 --> 48:44.640]  we don't do we know that's because people have been for those that don't know
[48:44.640 --> 48:46.320]  so spread out
[48:46.320 --> 48:49.120]  that people have been homeschooled there since the beginning so it's in the
[48:49.120 --> 48:50.760]  infrastructure
[48:50.760 --> 48:51.480]  and it's
[48:51.480 --> 48:53.520]  it's very uh...
[48:53.520 --> 48:57.240]  i mean that the lawyers talk about a lot of that's the way for

[48:58.880 --> 49:01.400]  i was a great state well
[49:01.400 --> 49:03.640]  it can be but uh...
[49:03.640 --> 49:07.280]  the thing you talk about even on hold out on hold the other day and
[49:07.280 --> 49:09.120]  that pastor anderson
[49:09.120 --> 49:10.600]  with his uh...
[49:10.600 --> 49:12.280]  border patrol story
[49:12.280 --> 49:14.240]  which is unbelievable
[49:14.240 --> 49:17.960]  and while you were talking to him and you guys were talking about
[49:17.960 --> 49:20.120]  the king james version of the bible
[49:20.120 --> 49:21.920]  uh... i was just going to give you a little
[49:21.920 --> 49:25.000]  hint i don't know if you've heard about the janeva bible
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.720]  uh...
[49:26.720 --> 49:27.960]  as soon as uh...
[49:27.960 --> 49:31.080]  we began hearing about it there's been a
[49:31.080 --> 49:34.960]  uh... several men are several groups of an organization to drop back the
[49:34.960 --> 49:39.040]  reprinting of the janeva bible which was the version uh...
[49:39.040 --> 49:40.480]  printed before
[49:40.480 --> 49:41.920]  king james
[49:41.920 --> 49:42.920]  uh...
[49:42.920 --> 49:46.640]  decided that uh... some of the
[49:46.640 --> 49:50.960]  uh... marginal notes in the bible uh... were very
[49:50.960 --> 49:53.520]  he he was just calling them seditious
[49:53.520 --> 49:55.440]  because uh...
[49:55.440 --> 49:58.040]  he wanted his own version of bible written
[49:58.040 --> 50:01.160]  so that people would i'm not a huge bottle scholar by now there's a big
[50:01.160 --> 50:03.720]  difference in reportedly the janeva's older
[50:03.720 --> 50:07.240]  uh... is but uh... maybe we can have a scholar on to talk about the differences
[50:07.240 --> 50:08.800]  between the two
[50:08.800 --> 50:12.440]  uh... but when we finally realize that one day my husband and i don't know
[50:12.440 --> 50:16.560]  how dark can we be king james version i mean
[50:16.560 --> 50:17.560]  of course
[50:17.560 --> 50:21.520]  we're going to have to you know and and the janeva is what the reformers and
[50:21.520 --> 50:24.840]  the people who came over here on the mayfair brought with them
[50:24.840 --> 50:27.520]  and so you know they were fleeing for
[50:27.520 --> 50:30.800]  perfect religious persecution reasons but um...
[50:30.800 --> 50:34.320]  you know to bring that back and when i heard your people yesterday
[50:34.320 --> 50:35.640]  or day before yesterday that
[50:35.640 --> 50:40.360]  talk about the old keepers and how the people that they were listening to
[50:40.360 --> 50:43.160]  had these monosyllabic uh...
[50:43.160 --> 50:46.640]  words that they were using in the family like reformers
[50:46.640 --> 50:49.680]  these men are the men that have brought back this uh...
[50:49.680 --> 50:50.480]  janeva
[50:50.480 --> 50:51.600]  reprinting
[50:51.600 --> 50:55.680]  but uh... i'm calling specifically about what's going on up here and

[1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:14.520]  no transportation in or out and we will literally be an island
[1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:18.040]  they're only the only way to get into our town
[1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:22.040]  seward is known as the northernmost ice report in alaska
[1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:25.720]  we have cruise ships coming in all summer long
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:29.800]  people can come in by cruise and there's also the rail which goes straight from
[1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:36.280]  here seward into fairbanks now it makes a stop in anchorage and
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:41.880]  the town was literally outraged that we had no
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:48.040]  previous um no previous notice that this was going to happen
[1:02:48.040 --> 1:02:52.760]  businesses um this is called our shoulder season we have a huge season

[1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:18.520]  notices um via the chamber of commerce they sent out via email
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:23.240]  that our town will literally be cut off well the man who conducted the meeting
[1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:26.440]  at city council said this is totally inexcusable for a professional
[1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:30.200]  organization there's no way you can cut off our town
[1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:34.200]  and strip us of our livelihood without giving us an alternative they did not
[1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:37.960]  give us an alternative roadway out or in

[1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:07.080]  what am i supposed to do and then i try to interview people i try to do job
[1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:10.360]  interviews in the public so brain damage and so messed up
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:13.160]  it's hard to find people that can even understand what we're doing here
[1:16:13.160 --> 1:16:17.720]  and know how to do this or those that we know who are fans can't be trusted
[1:16:17.720 --> 1:16:21.160]  because those are generally infiltrators
[1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:24.120]  i don't know how to hire people or how to do it i don't know why other sites and
[1:16:24.120 --> 1:16:28.120]  other patriot groups don't get the full analysis down i wish other people had
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:31.080]  this figured out i find a few people i try to hire
[1:16:31.080 --> 1:16:34.280]  sometimes who seem like they know what's going on with the new world order that
[1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:38.520]  turns out they're ego maniac mentally ill and go after me so i don't know i don't
[1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:41.080]  understand it but uh
[1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:46.040]  caught almighty caught almighty they're doing brainwashing camps everywhere
[1:16:46.040 --> 1:16:50.600]  right now with your children uh i've probably seen
[1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:53.640]  50 plus reports i mean i see them every few weeks
[1:16:53.640 --> 1:16:57.560]  where they lock the school down for the day generally with elementary students
[1:16:57.560 --> 1:17:02.040]  third to fourth grade because they found they can be controlled and
[1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:04.840]  won't break down and freak out too much because then it
[1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:08.280]  causes a whole panic they have the children
[1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:11.400]  locked down they say in the news articles in the news articles report just
[1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:15.000]  like it's normal this is this is run by psychiatrists
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:18.520]  they have the children humiliated they defecate in front of each other in
[1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:21.800]  trash cans they're not allowed and i'm sorry defecations
[1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:29.080]  part of this i keep mentioning that it's gross this is what's going on
[1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:31.720]  they don't let them go to the bathroom they don't it says they don't give them
[1:17:31.720 --> 1:17:34.680]  lunch that day to give them low blood sugar to make
[1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:38.440]  the terror attack more real quote so they'll be safe when the terrorists
[1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:41.240]  really attack so see that's the way it's for their
[1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:45.880]  safety the children aren't given food uh and then they're kept till their
[1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:48.680]  parents come the parents always get upset the school just laugh at them
[1:17:48.680 --> 1:17:52.520]  they're setting the precedent to do hardcore mind control
[1:17:52.520 --> 1:17:57.080]  and then um by the sixth period
[1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:00.600]  but again this is in the earlier classes but that's how they describe it but
[1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:03.000]  later in the afternoon they don't have periods then but the point is later in
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:07.240]  the afternoon they come and then the SWAT team comes
[1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:11.160]  with with drugs barking at the kids and drags them around
[1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:15.960]  don't believe me i've i've seen more than 50 of those so they're doing this
[1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:19.240]  everywhere i just remembered another one we were
[1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:22.120]  sent video was not even in the news later the news reported on it
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:27.320]  the Ozarks bordering arkansas in missouri is what i remember we have video
[1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:29.960]  of it don't have the staff to even dig it out and play it we played it on
[1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:33.240]  local access this was 10 years ago
[1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:37.240]  they would put guns to the kids heads take put them on fema buses and take
[1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:41.480]  them to a nearby fema camp and tell them we're getting you ready for this
[1:18:41.480 --> 1:18:45.080]  did the phone system come back up
[1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:52.680]  this is absolutely ridiculous it's just unbelievable
[1:18:52.680 --> 1:19:00.360]  you know almost feel like just a moment of silence to get people's attention
[1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:03.080]  like i should just go off the air right now
[1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:06.600]  like not even have a rebroadcast just have dead air
[1:19:06.600 --> 1:19:10.120]  because almost talking about this almost makes it like it's commonplace
[1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:14.200]  and no big deal do you understand how the soviet mind control camps worked
[1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:17.160]  you understand how the soviet reeducation schools
[1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:21.080]  all of this sensitivity training and all of this crap has been to turn each
[1:19:21.080 --> 1:19:23.880]  other at each other's throats think about all our differences
[1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:27.000]  nanny with each other have men and women fight with each other

[1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:19.000]  they're just bringing me stacks of articles right now i'm gonna cover
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.720]  later uh kevin in canada you're on the air
[1:42:21.720 --> 1:42:24.280]  sir go ahead
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:32.040]  go ahead you're on the air kevin okay we lost kevin
[1:42:32.040 --> 1:42:37.240]  uh let's go to richard in north carolina richard you're on the air
[1:42:37.240 --> 1:42:42.680]  yeah hey alex uh thanks for taking my call thanks for calling
[1:42:42.680 --> 1:42:46.760]  shouldn't in a statement if i could um i was wondering what you thought of how
[1:42:46.760 --> 1:42:53.160]  you know this how russia and china both came out calling for the end of the
[1:42:53.160 --> 1:42:57.800]  dollar and uh one world currency and i was wondering how
[1:42:57.800 --> 1:43:01.320]  what do you think they somehow manipulated them into
[1:43:01.320 --> 1:43:04.680]  doing that or or they're controlled by a new world
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:08.280]  order they are when they come out and say what the new world order exactly
[1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:11.640]  wanted well look do you see how republicans and
[1:43:11.640 --> 1:43:13.880]  democrats fight with each other but it's over
[1:43:13.880 --> 1:43:22.520]  who controls the levers of the system and so they're all for the system
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:25.720]  the system is one thing the new world order is one thing
[1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:29.000]  then the globalists at the top fight and argue
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:32.200]  one of the few things but that's been holding them back partially over who
[1:43:32.200 --> 1:43:37.000]  gets to control the levers you see it's kind of like you can have a new
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  university president bidding for control to fire the chancellor of the
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:43.320]  university and you know he's trying to get
[1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:47.080]  the rest of the alumni and the board of directors on his side or her side
[1:43:47.080 --> 1:43:51.080]  still the university is there the university has its goals what it teaches
[1:43:51.080 --> 1:43:54.200]  what it does its philosophy its history
[1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:57.560]  okay kind of like you'll have a ship that's had four or five captains
[1:43:57.560 --> 1:44:01.880]  the ship's still there it just gets a new captain and so it's in the news today
[1:44:01.880 --> 1:44:07.400]  with the league of arab states and others meeting
[1:44:07.400 --> 1:44:10.840]  the arab league and others saying we want an arab new world order
[1:44:10.840 --> 1:44:13.880]  so they're all saying you know the elitists are all we want one world
[1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:16.760]  government we all want to enslave people that's what elites all want
[1:44:16.760 --> 1:44:19.320]  that's the nature of government power in high places
[1:44:19.320 --> 1:44:22.440]  wickedness in high places what the founding fathers said what the bible
[1:44:22.440 --> 1:44:26.120]  says what philosophy states what history shows
[1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:30.360]  and so you got the Arabs you got the muslims you got the chinese
[1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:35.640]  the japanese the latin americans the us the british the germans the russians
[1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:40.440]  they're all fighting for their piece of the new world order and it's on record
[1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:45.400]  so it's kind of like a pirate ship and you got a hundred pirates on it and
[1:44:45.400 --> 1:44:48.840]  there's four or five really tough mean pirates and there's the one toughest
[1:44:48.840 --> 1:44:53.400]  meanest slyest smartest captain and you've got some of the
[1:44:53.400 --> 1:44:57.800]  second and third and fourth mates going i it'd be nice if i were the captain
[1:44:57.800 --> 1:45:02.200]  maybe the new world order should be mine shut up there bluebeard
[1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:05.960]  you know last time you made a move you lost your eye with me
[1:45:05.960 --> 1:45:09.960]  you understand it's like a crime commission meeting and the godfather
[1:45:09.960 --> 1:45:14.280]  where there's 15 of them around and he's like i am here to make my peace
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:19.080]  will another vendetta bring back your son or my son santino
[1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:24.280]  no i'm here saying until my death that i will not be the one to break the peace
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:28.760]  but if a bolt of lightning should strike my son or have a police officer
[1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:31.480]  should shoot him in the head on his way to work
[1:45:31.480 --> 1:45:34.600]  then i will blame some of the people in this room
[1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:39.560]  you understand now right right um what else i wanted to say was kind of goes
[1:45:39.560 --> 1:45:44.200]  along with what you've been saying a lot about um arrest the bankers
[1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:47.560]  um i wanted to like put out a call say to like
[1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:54.120]  all lawyers and attorney generals and prosecutors and da's and
[1:45:54.120 --> 1:45:58.120]  seems like if we could get them we like we wouldn't be able to arrest the
[1:45:58.120 --> 1:46:01.320]  bankers unless you get people like that involved and
[1:46:01.320 --> 1:46:05.640]  a lot of them like da's and like i know that guy buried the uh
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:09.560]  don't bust me guys running for attorney general and just things like that and
[1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:14.520]  get people to to get lawyers and district attorneys and stuff
[1:46:14.520 --> 1:46:18.680]  and it's kind of like you know vince and boogly osi wrote that book saying
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:23.080]  the you know how to prosecute george bush and he said that
[1:46:23.080 --> 1:46:28.360]  he established jurisdiction for every any da anywhere in america that somebody
[1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:33.080]  got killed in that war they could uh convene a grand jury and
[1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:37.320]  start looking into that and uh you know there's so many
[1:46:37.320 --> 1:46:41.400]  questions they're just so glad he's like specifically
[1:46:41.400 --> 1:46:44.280]  that one about the world trade center seven where
[1:46:44.280 --> 1:46:49.400]  that fire captain was talking to brian williams on msnbc and said
[1:46:49.400 --> 1:46:52.760]  we were told that that building was going to fall down
[1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:56.600]  or else if it didn't it would have to be taken down on its own
[1:46:56.600 --> 1:47:01.320]  sir sir we have we have we have more than 15 videos and i'm just going from
[1:47:01.320 --> 1:47:06.040]  memory it's probably 20 or 30 we got more than 15 videos of cops firemen
[1:47:06.040 --> 1:47:09.880]  city officials you name it going yeah we're going to blow up building seven
[1:47:09.880 --> 1:47:15.320]  get back it's coming down then bbc fall starts 25 minutes before on both
[1:47:15.320 --> 1:47:21.000]  channels the same script simultaneously bbc world bbc
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:25.960]  24 and the fox and seeing in all simultaneously
[1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:29.560]  and what did i say i said that was probably a roiders report
[1:47:29.560 --> 1:47:32.360]  an internal roiders report false start scripting
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:36.920]  and boom a year and a half after that news broke they admitted yeah roiders told
[1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:40.440]  us the building seven had come down just the way it came down
[1:47:40.440 --> 1:47:44.920]  i've caught me that's what i mean it's just ridiculous couldn't i could
[1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:49.400]  couldn't any district attorney who had someone in their in their
[1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:55.560]  dead city died at 9 11 convene a grand jury and subpoena that fire captain
[1:47:55.560 --> 1:47:59.080]  is they did that told you they did that in oklahoma city they had the police
[1:47:59.080 --> 1:48:01.960]  officers the firemen the the medical workers
[1:48:01.960 --> 1:48:05.960]  coming into the grand jury and the and the foreman and the bombs being
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:10.040]  removed and and and all of it and the fbi came with their guns to
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:13.160]  hoppy hollberg's house and they said you're keep your mouth shut and they
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:16.920]  had him removed off the grand jury and then they killed some of the police and
[1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:19.960]  and and medical workers i mean i mean the cops with radio
[1:48:19.960 --> 1:48:23.400]  i got feds behind me i'll call you in a minute and they'd find the cop all
[1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:27.240]  tortured and murdered in the field i mean these people don't play games but
[1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:31.880]  yes we've got to have bold district attorney i'm risking my life saying
[1:48:31.880 --> 1:48:35.000]  arrest them that believe me they don't like that
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:38.840]  seems like i mean we could talk all day about yeah it was 9 11 was an inside
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:42.360]  job and we need to do this for that but we gotta it seems like if we don't fight
[1:48:42.360 --> 1:48:46.520]  them with lawyers and the law like the way they try to do everything
[1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:50.600]  and but we'll answer those questions you know
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:57.000]  who told that fire well elliott happen listen that there was
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:01.560]  and i appreciate your call there was talk with barry jennings

[1:49:09.160 --> 1:49:12.600]  and private investigators have been hired to look into it and they come back
[1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:17.640]  on record saying we quit you call the police this is a police matter
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:20.280]  we're not touching this and they're scared to death
[1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:25.720]  okay so uh... you know i mean these people
[1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:32.200]  these people will murder anybody now i'm not saying they're invincible
[1:49:32.200 --> 1:49:36.120]  i'm not saying they're invincible you just let everybody know they staged the

[1:49:49.080 --> 1:49:56.200]  and you just continue to expose them and you point out that the bankers
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:49:59.080]  that run the country now that have stolen 12.8 trillion in six months and
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:03.880]  growing they are the ones who are now setting

[1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:16.120]  to the limits of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for
[1:51:16.120 --> 1:51:19.400]  electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge
[1:51:19.400 --> 1:51:22.680]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country

[2:01:05.880 --> 2:01:10.280]  this is more than 20 articles they just printed the last 30 minutes
[2:01:10.280 --> 2:01:14.440]  now i want you guys to google death education
[2:01:14.440 --> 2:01:22.440]  columbine 2020 this is in my film please say to the takeover
[2:01:22.440 --> 2:01:25.400]  the mainstream news articles that they taught the kids how to get in coffins
[2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:28.920]  how to hang themselves so they wouldn't do it and of course massive suicides
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:32.920]  exploded at the school the whole thing was a federally
[2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:35.560]  run brainwashing camp that's been proven it was a test model
[2:01:35.560 --> 2:01:38.600]  and they staged the shootings there of course that's on record
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:42.280]  we've proven that oh you didn't you didn't know about that
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:47.160]  um but regardless i start mentioning how they don't
[2:01:47.160 --> 2:01:50.600]  feed the kids all day they make them use the bathroom and trash cans
[2:01:50.600 --> 2:01:53.480]  they tell them that real terrorists are coming to kill them
[2:01:53.480 --> 2:01:57.400]  they tell the kids in many of these drills some they
[2:01:57.400 --> 2:02:00.760]  just asked for volunteers doing the weekend it's the drama department and
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:04.360]  that's reasonable we want to be clear
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:07.800]  that i've gone and videotaped some of the ones that are reasonable
[2:02:07.800 --> 2:02:12.600]  they still are meant to create fear uh they still are meant to train everybody
[2:02:12.600 --> 2:02:15.400]  to kind of live in a police state and hate guns
[2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:18.200]  uh and we're showing some of those right now but those are at least with kids
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:20.840]  that volunteer they have other ones all over the
[2:02:20.840 --> 2:02:24.280]  country where they go in unannounced showing the mindset
[2:02:24.280 --> 2:02:30.520]  of these people so i said i would go over those and i have some news
[2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:39.000]  here uh dealing with missing ampule three missing ampules
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:43.640]  yeah there's death education at calm about high excellent 1999 you found it
[2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:48.920]  there's another one 2002 2000 no 2000 1991 1992
[2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:53.640]  um with them in the coffins even if they didn't want to be on the coffins they
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:56.680]  would sit on top of them till they felt like they were
[2:02:56.680 --> 2:02:59.960]  suffocating to quote it's kind of like waterboarding to show them what death is
[2:02:59.960 --> 2:03:02.360]  like and then this is where they teach you that
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:04.440]  terrorists are coming and are going to kill you and
[2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:08.120]  guns are bad and the police state's good and and that's all this is for a bunch
[2:03:08.120 --> 2:03:11.880]  of crap uh so uh and then i already showed you
[2:03:11.880 --> 2:03:15.000]  martial law drills where they practice taking over our cities but

[2:09:00.920 --> 2:09:05.080]  know rick perry what's he's still doing sitting up there on his feet
[2:09:05.080 --> 2:09:08.680]  well he's he's feeling the heat so he's saying i'm a patriot i'm against the
[2:09:08.680 --> 2:09:13.160]  new world war i'm against federal okay but we have actual proof that he has
[2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:16.440]  committed treason why is he not jail right now
[2:09:16.440 --> 2:09:20.360]  because the state police and everybody else are under his control
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:25.880]  well then i guess citizens arrest i mean
[2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:29.880]  i appreciate your call let me let me really is if the system is set up to
[2:09:29.880 --> 2:09:33.720]  prevent them or prevent us from getting to them and
[2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:38.360]  putting them on trial then really seriously what are we going to do
[2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:41.640]  well they've overthrown our system and we've got to get it back let me try to
[2:09:41.640 --> 2:09:45.320]  break this down if enough people are just awake to their crimes that don't go
[2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:48.360]  along with it and and just start saying criminal criminal everywhere they go
[2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:51.960]  instead of groveling to authority and badges and uniforms and
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:56.120]  you know signants of authority and we're already on our way to discrediting
[2:09:56.120 --> 2:09:59.480]  them in their system falling that's why they're taking the velvet glove off the
[2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:03.960]  iron fist and coming in aggressively now
[2:10:03.960 --> 2:10:08.280]  so that's one issue that's all i pretty much had to say thank you for your show
[2:10:08.280 --> 2:10:11.240]  thank you so much we're gonna let you go thank you
[2:10:11.240 --> 2:10:18.840]  uh jessica um from texas now
[2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:24.200]  talking about fantasy i mean what's the quickest way to get the bankers
[2:10:24.200 --> 2:10:28.280]  arrested you have a couple dozen grand juries
[2:10:28.280 --> 2:10:33.800]  in diet start uh in dieting or calling for indictments of
[2:10:33.800 --> 2:10:37.960]  geitner and summers and everybody who engineered the crisis were in and did
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:41.480]  all this illegal stuff they can't kill all the grand juries
[2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:45.480]  it would become obvious if they did they'd probably still try it
[2:10:45.480 --> 2:10:50.520]  and that would really wake folks up see as more people stand up and say no
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:56.280]  others start standing up and saying no that's why when elliot spitzer
[2:10:56.280 --> 2:10:59.160]  wrote one article saying it was a criminal fraud what was going on as
[2:10:59.160 --> 2:11:03.080]  governor he had skeletons in his closet he was visiting a hooker
[2:11:03.080 --> 2:11:05.800]  and they burned him with it and turned out he was under fbi surveillance the
[2:11:05.800 --> 2:11:08.360]  whole time just like every member of congress
[2:11:08.360 --> 2:11:13.000]  is under nsa surveillance 24 7 and i told you that for years and it's now
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:17.400]  public and they admit they do without warrants that's you wonder why congress
[2:11:17.400 --> 2:11:20.840]  is told by the presidency you run nothing and they say yes or boss
[2:11:20.840 --> 2:11:24.040]  when they are equal to the president or above the president
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:30.520]  in the structure of power because they're spying on them and they got all
[2:11:30.520 --> 2:11:34.360]  the dirt or they'll make dirt up i mean they blow up congressman's planes and
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:38.440]  senators planes all the time i mean these people are in power because they
[2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:44.840]  are murderers they are their criminals and a lot of americans and also what
[2:11:44.840 --> 2:11:47.640]  that's how america gets stuff done but now they're going to take your pension
[2:11:47.640 --> 2:11:50.440]  funds now they're going to brainwash your kids against you
[2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:53.480]  see they want it all
[2:11:55.720 --> 2:11:59.320]  so you would have a dozen or so grand juries move for indictments
[2:11:59.320 --> 2:12:03.320]  on different issues and would just start start a snowball
[2:12:03.320 --> 2:12:07.800]  just like it is now with all these big globalists like made-off and others
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:11.560]  caught stealing tens of millions of dollars and being at the highest
[2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:14.200]  echelons that shows people these are crooks
[2:12:14.200 --> 2:12:18.920]  we're getting to that point hell 98 percent of americans don't like the
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:22.680]  bankers see we are the majority they got a tiger
[2:12:22.680 --> 2:12:28.840]  by the tail okay let's go ahead and uh
[2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:33.400]  talk to brian in texas who disagrees go ahead brian
[2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:38.520]  going uh hey alex i was going and um listen what i disagree about was nothing
[2:12:38.520 --> 2:12:41.160]  you talked about today but i got a little bit
[2:12:41.160 --> 2:12:44.520]  i don't know not fended because this is such as important stuff but
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:48.600]  i'm a former i guess republican right winger who
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:52.440]  you know just didn't believe i just thought this stuff was too dastardly
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:55.720]  to believe and yesterday you were going on and on about
[2:12:55.720 --> 2:12:59.720]  we want to be scammed we love it we're we're stupid we want and
[2:12:59.720 --> 2:13:03.560]  but dude that's just not it people don't know
[2:13:03.560 --> 2:13:07.320]  and i didn't know this stuff and i i listened to you
[2:13:07.320 --> 2:13:10.760]  i researched it myself i didn't just swallow what you said
[2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:14.760]  and i'm shocked and i believe it but you know i i think what's happening alex
[2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:18.200]  is so there's fixing to be a big cabal because
[2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:21.560]  you know i used to be a big rush van until i started listening to you and
[2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:25.080]  dude he is getting closer and closer he's dancing around everything you're
[2:13:25.080 --> 2:13:28.760]  saying and i don't know but i think if these two
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:32.280]  forces come together you you need to claim credit
[2:13:32.280 --> 2:13:36.120]  and and and and and and you can become
[2:13:36.120 --> 2:13:39.640]  i mean bigger than everybody but but i wouldn't
[2:13:39.640 --> 2:13:42.680]  i wouldn't go in and start throwing rocks at everybody who
[2:13:42.680 --> 2:13:49.480]  who can't get their arms around this i understand it's just that when i see
[2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:53.640]  that every major vaccines killing people left and right and killing people i
[2:13:53.640 --> 2:13:57.240]  know and
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:13:59.960]  you know i'm talking about i'm not talking about you i'm talking about the
[2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:03.160]  people that still go out and take the vaccines
[2:14:03.160 --> 2:14:06.200]  that still think the federal reserve is governmental
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:09.720]  uh that still think the government's legitimate i'm not talking about you and
[2:14:09.720 --> 2:14:12.520]  i listen the reason this radio show is popular
[2:14:12.520 --> 2:14:16.600]  is because i'm this is real this isn't entertainment this isn't a stick
[2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:20.280]  this is what i mean they see me here at the office they know i'm freaked out i
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:23.720]  mean i mean this i'm like get me more documents get me more proof we've got
[2:14:23.720 --> 2:14:27.800]  to fight them we've got a i've got to control myself to just go home even
[2:14:27.800 --> 2:14:30.840]  though i love my family and my children and want to spend time with them
[2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:33.880]  they have no future if i don't stay down here in the boiler room
[2:14:33.880 --> 2:14:39.160]  and get these pipes fixed and and man you know it shakes me up it freaks me
[2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:43.560]  out to study soviet brainwashing techniques in schools
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:47.240]  and then to see exactly that in the united states
[2:14:47.240 --> 2:14:51.320]  i'm freaked out man and i don't know how everybody else
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:57.000]  doesn't see it and isn't freaked out and as for rush limbaugh
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:01.320]  uh rush has been consistently the way he is so i don't really attack him
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:04.120]  like i do at glenn beck glenn beck is an operative and i'll tell you right now
[2:15:04.120 --> 2:15:06.440]  i can tell he is and i know what i'm talking about
[2:15:06.440 --> 2:15:10.200]  limbaugh i know is having to dance around this hillary clinton came out
[2:15:10.200 --> 2:15:15.000]  yesterday and said she loves ron paul and they introduced her on hardball
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:18.680]  i saw the intro to it we have a clip from later in the show as oh yeah she used
[2:15:18.680 --> 2:15:23.720]  to be a uh very goldwater girl and and suddenly
[2:15:23.720 --> 2:15:28.760]  fox and cnn love ron paul and msnbc does because they know sir we are the
[2:15:28.760 --> 2:15:32.120]  majority now we just don't know we're the majority
[2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:37.720]  so they're trying to it's like a us tank attacking the battle of
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:40.680]  the bulge paint itself gray so the germans don't shoot at it
[2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:45.400]  you know they have taken the colorations
[2:15:45.400 --> 2:15:49.480]  there's lots of beetles and things that have the colorations of poison
[2:15:49.480 --> 2:15:52.920]  beetles but they're not really poisonous they're the false poison beetle
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:56.920]  so that birds don't eat it and so you got the real poison beetle to the new
[2:15:56.920 --> 2:16:00.600]  world order myself ron paul you know the real movement
[2:16:00.600 --> 2:16:03.880]  so you got them trying to look like the false poison beetle
[2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:08.040]  you understand and they're doing that because rush limbaugh has said for
[2:16:08.040 --> 2:16:11.240]  decades there's no world government no new world order there's not a banking
[2:16:11.240 --> 2:16:13.960]  cabal and now it's all being announced so great
[2:16:13.960 --> 2:16:17.160]  let rush come along i know he's come along but
[2:16:17.160 --> 2:16:21.400]  he still reinforces its left versus right and and so if you took that
[2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:24.920]  personally sir i wasn't talking about you i was once ignorant to all of this
[2:16:24.920 --> 2:16:29.080]  as well i'm just telling you
[2:16:29.080 --> 2:16:34.040]  maybe the stress gets to me i mean it does and and i get very very aggressive
[2:16:34.040 --> 2:16:37.080]  anything else yeah yeah let me tell you my
[2:16:37.080 --> 2:16:40.040]  fear and what i see happening alex is i see
[2:16:40.040 --> 2:16:44.200]  some of this resistance that is almost a hundred percent attributable to you and
[2:16:44.200 --> 2:16:47.800]  your circle uh... being absorbed like you talked about
[2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:51.000]  and and that this guy obama over reaches
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:54.680]  and the storm dissipates but what happens then is you are
[2:16:54.680 --> 2:16:59.240]  really in the shadows at that point and the war continues and you become very
[2:16:59.240 --> 2:17:02.120]  vulnerable when they are not about to take over
[2:17:02.120 --> 2:17:07.400]  it's when they recede and start to regroup is when your life is in danger
[2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:10.200]  well they're they're always on the move and uh...
[2:17:10.200 --> 2:17:14.360]  i'm so visible that they're that i they're more likely to keep trying to
[2:17:14.360 --> 2:17:18.120]  destroy me in the media and i'm just committed idea at this point
[2:17:18.120 --> 2:17:21.240]  it one way or the other i'm just doing what i'm doing but i appreciate your
[2:17:21.240 --> 2:17:25.480]  call i just uh... girl growing up i never
[2:17:25.480 --> 2:17:29.160]  knew i'd be in this position and i never imagined i was just like you i never
[2:17:29.160 --> 2:17:31.960]  imagined that they were doing stuff like this
[2:17:31.960 --> 2:17:35.400]  i mean who i don't blame people who can't wake up to this
[2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:40.200]  but at this point it's so obvious i've still gotten major newspapers attacking
[2:17:40.200 --> 2:17:44.360]  me saying none of this exist
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:47.960]  i mean they'll ha ha he says there's a new world to run by banks and i've got
[2:17:47.960 --> 2:17:55.080]  literally six articles in my stack mainstream news today announcing it
[2:17:55.080 --> 2:17:59.960]  and and and obama's got the public conned he's got like half the public still con
[2:17:59.960 --> 2:18:02.280]  going oh i think things are getting better under obama
[2:18:02.280 --> 2:18:06.440]  oh yeah i agree meanwhile he knows he's destroyed them financially
[2:18:06.440 --> 2:18:10.760]  uh... let's talk to another caller here let's go to revo seventy six year on the
[2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:12.120]  air

[2:26:57.480 --> 2:27:02.040]  and there hasn't been an outbreak in the united states at 71
[2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:04.840]  the vials had been in the research institute's facility at fort detrick
[2:27:04.840 --> 2:27:07.000]  home of the army's top biological research facility
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  for more than a decade the three missing vials were among
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:15.080]  thousands of vials that were under the control of senior scientists
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:19.160]  they retired 2004 when another fort detrick scientist recently

[2:28:37.320 --> 2:28:40.600]  turns out it's the most weaponized anthrax ever seen
[2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:44.200]  and the media says no it was made in a bathtub in a basement
[2:28:44.200 --> 2:28:47.400]  no it didn't come out of a base then it turns out it was the aim strain fort
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:51.960]  detrick maryland miniaturized and then weaponized
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:28:59.720]  and had wings in a nano tech facility that only fort detrick can do

[2:33:30.760 --> 2:33:34.600]  down and said oh we lost some vials or somebody stole
[2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:38.520]  some vials of foot and mouth the day that was supposedly being spread two
[2:33:38.520 --> 2:33:41.560]  days later it pops up in locations all over the country
[2:33:41.560 --> 2:33:45.080]  one person two people ten people couldn't have done it
[2:33:45.080 --> 2:33:48.200]  they sneak into a level four bio weapons lab
[2:33:48.200 --> 2:33:52.760]  that somebody steals it it's got machine gun nests barbed wire minefields
[2:33:52.760 --> 2:33:55.960]  underground pressure facilities big vault doors
[2:33:55.960 --> 2:33:59.160]  that's level four they sneak in they get it and they spread it all over the
[2:33:59.160 --> 2:34:01.800]  country and the government goes around killing
[2:34:01.800 --> 2:34:06.760]  eight million sheet four million cows that weren't even infected
[2:34:06.760 --> 2:34:10.200]  and the images you know those big piles of cows burning
[2:34:10.200 --> 2:34:12.840]  and then we predicted the government wouldn't let people restock and they
[2:34:12.840 --> 2:34:17.880]  said yes it's not sustainable you're not allowed to restock cows and sheep
[2:34:19.080 --> 2:34:23.400]  they're waging war on agriculture they want control of it they want to use it
[2:34:23.400 --> 2:34:26.200]  as a tool of control for their one-child policies
[2:34:26.200 --> 2:34:29.560]  by the way england and australia two days ago we haven't even gotten to that
[2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:33.320]  that's in the stack on obama's covered it have announced they want officially a
[2:34:33.320 --> 2:34:37.480]  one-child policy now i told you when i made in game two years ago
[2:34:37.480 --> 2:34:42.360]  almost two years ago when i have talked on air that these new rules about oh we
[2:34:42.360 --> 2:34:46.760]  want to tax you if you have more than one child
[2:34:46.760 --> 2:34:49.400]  that's a one-child policy and now they're admitting it so
[2:34:49.400 --> 2:34:52.680]  that's happening that's what all this control is about but then you have
[2:34:52.680 --> 2:34:57.240]  um us officials track new flu strain from pigs
[2:34:57.240 --> 2:35:00.760]  and they're saying you could you know it's it's similar to the bird flu
[2:35:00.760 --> 2:35:05.160]  on and on and on we may have to take vaccines they just so happened to have
[2:35:05.160 --> 2:35:09.080]  a vaccine mass produced for this pig
[2:35:09.080 --> 2:35:13.240]  virus they just so happened to have this uh horse virus
[2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:16.600]  notice the government of australia last year
[2:35:16.600 --> 2:35:20.440]  accidentally released the horse virus we were just talking about that earlier in
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:24.280]  the week they can kill humans and they said oh an
[2:35:24.280 --> 2:35:28.760]  accident from our laboratory okay well let's just say this is all
[2:35:28.760 --> 2:35:33.000]  accidents it's an accident that in fake you know arab
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:35.160]  handwriting in english you know it's meant to look like somebody who couldn't
[2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:39.320]  speak english wrote it with all is great death of the west gets
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:42.200]  mailed out from fort day trick just an accident
[2:35:42.200 --> 2:35:46.280]  and foot and mouth gets released from port and down by accident and gets
[2:35:46.280 --> 2:35:50.600]  released from australia by accident and you just continue come on in what's
[2:35:50.600 --> 2:35:54.840]  going on
[2:35:54.840 --> 2:35:59.240]  every 15 minutes oh you found the program yeah
[2:35:59.240 --> 2:36:03.560]  erin found me their basic printouts what you're saying it's just amazing
[2:36:03.560 --> 2:36:07.000]  i mean it's off the hook tell us what you found well so let's turn this mic on
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:09.960]  what you find go ahead there's a death notice right here
[2:36:09.960 --> 2:36:12.600]  that they're going to inform the parents yeah i'm talking to mike they're saying
[2:36:12.600 --> 2:36:16.360]  there's a permission slip to participate in the program okay and then it goes on
[2:36:16.360 --> 2:36:19.000]  to let's see he talks about health information
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:24.360]  media release mock death notification i agree to receive a mock death notification
[2:36:24.360 --> 2:36:27.640]  for my son and daughter as part of the every 15 minutes program
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:32.760]  obituary information um so basically we'll see it's a death call but see
[2:36:32.760 --> 2:36:35.560]  that's for dwi so people think it sounds reasonable
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:38.760]  they have it where it's unannounced they come and say they're gonna kill you
[2:36:38.760 --> 2:36:42.840]  i'm i'm the grim reaper will come to class and take one of the students away
[2:36:42.840 --> 2:36:47.800]  and then someone will read the students obituary
[2:36:47.800 --> 2:36:51.400]  so well they have the studies this cause of suicide and kids think about death
[2:36:51.400 --> 2:36:54.120]  they shouldn't be thinking about it yeah that's all part of messing their brains
[2:36:54.120 --> 2:36:59.320]  up all right thank you so much okay um
[2:36:59.320 --> 2:37:02.840]  let me just go ahead and get into that now let me go ahead and start
[2:37:02.840 --> 2:37:05.800]  the presentation
[2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:13.640]  for everybody on this subject go ahead and get that out of my stack
[2:37:13.640 --> 2:37:19.800]  go ahead and focus and go over this in fact while i take a break to go back
[2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:22.840]  over these notes because i want to do this as a focus presentation
[2:37:22.840 --> 2:37:28.120]  let me play an important blurb here uh did the network send you the the
[2:37:28.120 --> 2:37:32.440]  ron paul clip oh well that's okay because the network
[2:37:32.440 --> 2:37:36.040]  has the audio of it uh so the network has the audio of this
[2:37:36.040 --> 2:37:40.360]  youtube's down so we can't play it from their servers
[2:37:40.360 --> 2:37:45.400]  last night i just turned the tv on when hardball was re-airing before i went for
[2:37:45.400 --> 2:37:50.520]  a jog and i saw
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:54.680]  chris matthew saying coming up the girl that used to love
[2:37:54.680 --> 2:37:59.080]  berry goldwater hillary clinton she uh
[2:37:59.080 --> 2:38:05.000]  compliments ron paul and they're now being forced to do this
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:14.440]  because they know that we are becoming the majority
[2:38:14.440 --> 2:38:19.640]  and so she's there trying to kiss up to him so you won't ask her tough questions
[2:38:20.280 --> 2:38:24.440]  but also you see this on fox cnn msnbc everywhere they talk about ron paul and
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:27.960]  how great he is and bill marr doesn't because they recognize
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:36.920]  he is the figurehead of probably 80 90 million people in this country
[2:38:36.920 --> 2:38:39.480]  so all we've got to do is stand up and take action for all of you out there
[2:38:39.480 --> 2:38:43.160]  that said oh the ron paul revolution he didn't win we failed
[2:38:43.160 --> 2:38:46.600]  that was only one benchmark in educating and growing our numbers and then we
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:49.160]  grow them again we grow them again we grow them again
[2:38:49.160 --> 2:38:51.880]  and they're scared of us because they don't care if you're wandering off as a
[2:38:51.880 --> 2:38:55.400]  liberal and that control paradimer wandering off as a fake
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:38:58.680]  republican and that control paradigm you really get into liberty and freedom
[2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:01.560]  declaration of independence constitutional rights
[2:39:01.560 --> 2:39:06.600]  that scares the establishment that scares them in a big way
[2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:11.320]  so uh let's go ahead and play the audio of this clip here it is
[2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:15.320]  the gentleman from texas uh mr paul is recognized for five minutes
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:19.560]  uh thank you mr chairman and welcome madam secretary
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:24.520]  i have a general question i want to ask about foreign policy but uh
[2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:28.040]  leading up to that question i would like to mention first that
[2:39:28.040 --> 2:39:31.560]  the election had something to do with bringing about change in tone with our
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:35.480]  foreign policy and i think there has been some very positive changes
[2:39:35.480 --> 2:39:41.480]  uh in tone and uh many of us have argued for more diplomacy rather than
[2:39:41.480 --> 2:39:45.720]  more threats so uh many of us are pleased with that
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:50.120]  uh it goes back to the old saying of speaking softly and still being willing
[2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:55.480]  to carry a big stick but sometimes uh i wonder whether that big stick doesn't
[2:39:55.480 --> 2:40:01.800]  get wielded a little too often and uh too often but i do want to caution
[2:40:01.800 --> 2:40:05.720]  all of us that what we say is very important and can be very beneficial
[2:40:05.720 --> 2:40:09.800]  but what we do is also uh very important so that may cancel out the
[2:40:09.800 --> 2:40:14.120]  benefits of speaking more softly and being willing to talk and negotiate
[2:40:14.120 --> 2:40:17.720]  some people say that we shouldn't talk to our enemies but
[2:40:17.720 --> 2:40:21.480]  i remember the cold war rather well and we did talk to khrushchev and
[2:40:21.480 --> 2:40:26.440]  myeltsuk tong when uh they were great threats to us so
[2:40:26.440 --> 2:40:31.320]  sometimes i think that when we uh look at how we stood up to tens of thousands
[2:40:31.320 --> 2:40:35.560]  of nuclear weapons that we should be cautious as far as what we might do in
[2:40:35.560 --> 2:40:41.960]  pakistan and put it into a proper uh perspective but my my big concern is
[2:40:41.960 --> 2:40:45.880]  uh whether or not we can reverse the empire mentality that i think we have
[2:40:45.880 --> 2:40:49.560]  adopted over these many many decades and also the
[2:40:49.560 --> 2:40:53.480]  relationship of this to our financial burden uh
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:58.440]  though we are speaking more softly and would like to get some troops home
[2:40:58.440 --> 2:41:03.160]  uh the first thing that was done was our dod budget was increased by
[2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:08.200]  nine percent in a time when our national debt in the last 12 months went up two
[2:41:08.200 --> 2:41:13.000]  trillion dollars all great nations have been brought to the news for economic
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:15.880]  reasons we didn't have to fight the soviets and the
[2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:21.160]  afghanistan adventure that the russians the soviets were involved with it was
[2:41:21.160 --> 2:41:24.280]  very significant and i don't know how we can uh
[2:41:24.280 --> 2:41:30.280]  can ignore that so i would like to uh ask the question about
[2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:34.280]  whether or not you can give me some signs or indication or some encouragement
[2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:37.960]  that maybe we shifted policies in the slightest manner
[2:41:37.960 --> 2:41:42.760]  have we brought any troops home are we less involved in iraq
[2:41:42.760 --> 2:41:47.320]  will that war ever end or are we really going in the opposite direction
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:52.520]  because we're we're seeing pakistan is so necessary we need more troops more
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:55.880]  expansion more money more dd dod funds
[2:41:55.880 --> 2:41:59.960]  so coming from my perspective i can't see the difference
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:04.200]  even though like i said i am pleased that there's a willingness to talk
[2:42:04.200 --> 2:42:08.360]  and try to work things out and i think that is very positive i always think
[2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:11.080]  that people who aren't willing to talk are insecure
[2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:17.560]  this whole idea that uh we are so strong it to to me it seems that we lack
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:21.400]  confidence if we can't talk to people and we are strong enough nobody's going to
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:26.360]  attack us militarily uh so i i see it very important that we
[2:42:26.360 --> 2:42:30.440]  we change our tone i think i think it's good that you got rid of the war on
[2:42:30.440 --> 2:42:34.840]  the the term war on terrorism how can you have war against the tactic
[2:42:34.840 --> 2:42:39.000]  it doesn't make any sense but i'm not sure overseas contingency operation
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:43.160]  is more specific so could you address that and maybe give me some hints as
[2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:48.120]  far as may seem maybe seeing actual some shift in our policy
[2:42:48.120 --> 2:42:52.040]  well thank you congressman i think that uh the president's actions in these
[2:42:52.040 --> 2:42:56.520]  nearly 100 days uh do uh match actions with words
[2:42:56.520 --> 2:42:59.400]  although i admit there is a lot more to be done we are
[2:42:59.400 --> 2:43:02.520]  still sorting out everything we've inherited and trying to make sense of
[2:43:02.520 --> 2:43:05.640]  it you know we want to protect america's national security
[2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:09.240]  but we think there are better and more effective ways of doing that
[2:43:09.240 --> 2:43:12.680]  so we are ending the war in iraq there is a definite
[2:43:12.680 --> 2:43:17.400]  end date for our troops to be there the president did close guantanamo
[2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:22.040]  the president is looking for ways to engage with those who
[2:43:22.040 --> 2:43:28.840]  nobody wanted us to talk to which is a c shift in how we are proceeding
[2:43:28.840 --> 2:43:33.080]  words and actions both matter i mean at the end of the day
[2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:38.760]  actions count more but you have to begin by at least articulating a new
[2:43:38.760 --> 2:43:42.440]  approach john stop right there for a minute later she
[2:43:42.440 --> 2:43:45.560]  grovels to him and says how great he is and how he has the most
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:48.920]  enthusiastic supporters i don't know we'll have time to get to that this is a
[2:43:48.920 --> 2:43:51.160]  different clip than i thought i'd sent the network i mean he
[2:43:51.160 --> 2:43:54.760]  she's in there later groveling you can watch it up at info wars dot com and
[2:43:54.760 --> 2:43:58.680]  prism planet dot com but that's a whole other subject i had in my stack her
[2:43:58.680 --> 2:44:02.680]  saying he's matched his his his words with deeds
[2:44:02.680 --> 2:44:06.280]  he signed an order saying we might close guantanamo in a year
[2:44:06.280 --> 2:44:08.920]  but we're going to use all the other holding facilities in the u.s and
[2:44:08.920 --> 2:44:14.280]  overseas and continue holding detainees without rights in fact google
[2:44:14.280 --> 2:44:17.640]  obama backs bush on no rights for detainees
[2:44:17.640 --> 2:44:22.120]  let's put that on screen for folks that's uh ap
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:26.840]  and he said that all of this continues the secret rendition continues
[2:44:26.840 --> 2:44:33.840]  uh... all of this is continuing
[2:44:35.720 --> 2:44:37.160]  obama
[2:44:37.160 --> 2:44:41.160]  backs bush on the rights for detainees he's hired nothing but lobbyist he's
[2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:43.720]  increasing the wars
[2:44:43.720 --> 2:44:47.960]  and she just says she goes on because i've got the text of it
[2:44:47.960 --> 2:44:51.000]  or she's given another speech for so many she gives where she says and he's
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:53.960]  balancing the budget what on earth are they talking about
[2:44:53.960 --> 2:44:58.440]  they're spending more money uh...
[2:44:58.440 --> 2:45:02.680]  then all the presidents before combined there and he keeps saying he's gonna
[2:45:02.680 --> 2:45:05.800]  cut the budget deficit in half of two years and balance it by the end of four
[2:45:05.800 --> 2:45:07.880]  years
[2:45:07.880 --> 2:45:11.480]  obama backs bush on policy on detainee rights
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:16.360]  and the exact headline that's uh... what is that out of u.s news and world
[2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:19.640]  report that cbs news i couldn't read the top
[2:45:19.640 --> 2:45:24.680]  the exact one is obama backs bush on the rights for detainees but
[2:45:24.680 --> 2:45:28.200]  there you get the idea the point is they're keeping the camps open
[2:45:28.200 --> 2:45:33.560]  it's all continuing uh... and always told you want on those not even the real
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:38.440]  camp long time was kind of a advertisement camp or or or what they show
[2:45:38.440 --> 2:45:41.400]  you publicly not the black sites all over the world and that's now been
[2:45:41.400 --> 2:45:45.560]  declassified in the white house memos saying they wanted bush to be dictator
[2:45:45.560 --> 2:45:50.280]  and then to restrict the pre press in the united states and this is all being
[2:45:50.280 --> 2:45:54.360]  set up and it's continuing under obama we did get barbed back
[2:45:54.360 --> 2:45:58.600]  the phone systems went down earlier she called in and talked about how they're
[2:45:58.600 --> 2:46:02.840]  doing this death education at the school how they're gonna lock down the
[2:46:02.840 --> 2:46:06.680]  school how it coincides with a weird lockdown drill
[2:46:06.680 --> 2:46:11.960]  uh... of uh... sewered alaska and we asked her to fax us proof of that
[2:46:11.960 --> 2:46:16.120]  and she faxed us the homeland security officer transportation secretary
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:18.440]  administration she talked to
[2:46:18.440 --> 2:46:24.040]  uh... and so just a briefly tell us exactly what's happening at the school
[2:46:24.040 --> 2:46:28.760]  exactly what they're doing in the town cuz i keep getting calls and emails
[2:46:28.760 --> 2:46:32.280]  they're not specific about they told us they're locking the town down
[2:46:32.280 --> 2:46:36.200]  for a fema drill what is going on
[2:46:36.200 --> 2:46:41.960]  okay uh... the the card that i sent to you was given to me
[2:46:41.960 --> 2:46:48.200]  by a man whom i mysteriously met uh... i dropped my daughter off to a coffee
[2:46:48.200 --> 2:46:51.720]  shop to work and i'm sitting on the couch looking out the window
[2:46:51.720 --> 2:46:54.600]  and a friend is with me and we're watching this man walking up and down the
[2:46:54.600 --> 2:46:57.640]  street looking at our cars kind of strange and holding something in his
[2:46:57.640 --> 2:47:01.480]  hand and looking at the building and where he's kind of looking underneath
[2:47:01.480 --> 2:47:05.240]  and around up and down the streets and we're going what is he doing i said
[2:47:05.240 --> 2:47:08.840]  well i'm going to go find out so i walked right out in approach and said hi
[2:47:08.840 --> 2:47:13.560]  may i help you and he um... continued he picked up some
[2:47:13.560 --> 2:47:15.320]  pictures that were black and white photos of
[2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:20.120]  sewered buildings and he said oh uh... yeah i used to
[2:47:20.120 --> 2:47:23.240]  you know it's funny i used to work here when i was about nineteen and i'm just
[2:47:23.240 --> 2:47:26.600]  kind of traveling back and looking around at sewered scene if i can

[3:01:50.520 --> 3:01:53.640]  a recent incident in which armed riot police
[3:01:53.640 --> 3:01:57.480]  rated a michigan junior high school as part of a drill that the children were
[3:01:57.480 --> 3:02:02.520]  not aware of was about to take place raises the bar in the pursuit
[3:02:02.520 --> 3:02:06.280]  of an agenda that's fully transformed public schools into prison training camps
[3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:10.920]  set up to breed continuous generations of obedient slaves the ap
[3:02:10.920 --> 3:02:15.240]  reports and here's the quotes a school safety drill that included police
[3:02:15.240 --> 3:02:19.080]  officers and riot year-end weapons has caused concern among some people
[3:02:19.080 --> 3:02:22.600]  who say it was too realistic and frightened some students students who
[3:02:22.600 --> 3:02:25.480]  were unaware police were conducting a drill were taken from their classroom
[3:02:25.480 --> 3:02:28.920]  in the halls padded down by officers and asked what they had in their pockets
[3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:31.640]  on his paper said some of the kids were so scared
[3:02:31.640 --> 3:02:34.760]  so they called it a drill to get around the fourth amendment some of the kids
[3:02:34.760 --> 3:02:37.640]  were so scared they just about wet their pants while i talked to parents they
[3:02:37.640 --> 3:02:41.080]  did what i'm said marjorie bradshaw a parent
[3:02:41.080 --> 3:02:44.120]  with four children in the godfrey lee schools i think it's
[3:02:44.120 --> 3:02:47.400]  pure wrong that the students and the parents were not informed of this the
[3:02:47.400 --> 3:02:50.520]  students were not told the drill was about to take place and the teachers
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:54.680]  were given just a moment's notice this follows an incident in early
[3:02:54.680 --> 3:02:57.400]  october where another michigan school was locked down for hours if their
[3:02:57.400 --> 3:03:00.760]  teenager was seen in the woods wearing a halloween mask
[3:03:00.760 --> 3:03:04.040]  the rape is similar to those in goose creek south carolina
[3:03:04.040 --> 3:03:07.880]  where armed police raided a high school with weapons drawn
[3:03:07.880 --> 3:03:11.160]  supposedly in search of drugs shouting police officers aimed guns at students
[3:03:11.160 --> 3:03:13.560]  heads were ordered face up against the wall

[3:03:23.640 --> 3:03:27.480]  as well as the berkeley county school district had to pay 1.6 million

[3:08:25.320 --> 3:08:30.280]  last four years he's alan combs a tv
[3:08:30.280 --> 3:08:35.640]  commentator on fox television and of course he has a syndicated radio show
[3:08:35.640 --> 3:08:39.480]  via fox and that's the show that i've been on quite a few times lord hannity
[3:08:39.480 --> 3:08:43.800]  would never have me on uh... but uh... he would have me on when i was busy
[3:08:43.800 --> 3:08:46.680]  bashing bush but would also you know criticizing quite a bit
[3:08:46.680 --> 3:08:50.520]  you know we've had some nice sparring in debates and then he's still having me on
[3:08:50.520 --> 3:08:54.280]  now that lord obama continuing all the exact same policies
[3:08:54.280 --> 3:08:58.680]  is in power so we have uh... the great alan combs on with us and i'll get back
[3:08:58.680 --> 3:08:59.480]  into the
[3:08:59.480 --> 3:09:02.440]  reeducation camps that they've turned the public schools into

[3:09:05.320 --> 3:09:06.120]  here with us
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:10.440]  i'll tell you i don't just put you on what it favors my side
[3:09:10.440 --> 3:09:14.040]  now that's what i was acknowledging as i think they're acknowledging that
[3:09:14.040 --> 3:09:17.640]  yeah absolutely and we don't uh... we don't uh... you know play the whole
[3:09:17.640 --> 3:09:19.320]  left-right paradigm ourselves
[3:09:19.320 --> 3:09:22.920]  uh... and i think the country starting to get away from these labels or or at
[3:09:22.920 --> 3:09:24.200]  least trying to
[3:09:24.200 --> 3:09:27.880]  well i think we have much of you might be critical of obama i believe his tone
[3:09:27.880 --> 3:09:30.560]  and the fact that he's got uh... bipartisan cabinet
[3:09:30.560 --> 3:09:33.960]  goes a long way toward back healing those wounds and having us
[3:09:33.960 --> 3:09:36.760]  and live in a postpartum america to some extent
[3:09:36.760 --> 3:09:40.000]  they left my just a few baggers
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:42.600]  you know uh... that was one of the questions i wanted to ask you i mean
[3:09:42.600 --> 3:09:48.120]  that is really a derogatory term though uh... right to to to have
[3:09:48.120 --> 3:09:50.840]  seeing and doing an msnbc doing it
[3:09:50.840 --> 3:09:54.840]  yeah uh... uh... sexual derogatory term there was any question they they
[3:09:54.840 --> 3:09:56.360]  admit it's a sexual term
[3:09:56.360 --> 3:09:58.480]  and then they were calling themselves
[3:09:58.480 --> 3:10:01.440]  and and then to say they're all i'm not saying you're doing this i'm asking
[3:10:01.440 --> 3:10:03.880]  what you think that they're all racist
[3:10:03.880 --> 3:10:06.840]  and they all hate black people do you believe that i don't know
[3:10:06.840 --> 3:10:08.320]  i i that's not my take
[3:10:08.320 --> 3:10:09.840]  i keep getting accused
[3:10:09.840 --> 3:10:12.680]  of saying they're all racist i've never said anything of the kind i don't
[3:10:12.680 --> 3:10:13.560]  think the
[3:10:13.560 --> 3:10:16.520]  people the fact that people hate obama some of them
[3:10:16.520 --> 3:10:18.760]  hate them or don't like him or criticize them
[3:10:18.760 --> 3:10:21.160]  because of the race issue there is some of that
[3:10:21.160 --> 3:10:23.680]  uh... but uh... i'm not blaming the
[3:10:23.680 --> 3:10:25.560]  the teabag uh...
[3:10:25.560 --> 3:10:28.920]  people whatever you want to call them for being racist some of them are
[3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:32.720]  uh... some of the most of them were barely very peaceful and well-behaved
[3:10:32.720 --> 3:10:33.520]  i just think
[3:10:33.520 --> 3:10:34.880]  my problem with that is
[3:10:34.880 --> 3:10:38.480]  i was just ingenious what it was it was corporately sponsored
[3:10:38.480 --> 3:10:40.760]  to say that somehow this was a grassroots movement
[3:10:40.760 --> 3:10:42.280]  to say it was bipartisan
[3:10:42.280 --> 3:10:43.440]  and it wasn't about
[3:10:43.440 --> 3:10:45.480]  being against obama when clearly
[3:10:45.480 --> 3:10:46.880]  it was a criticism
[3:10:46.880 --> 3:10:50.400]  of democratic policies is disengaged to say that is anything else is
[3:10:50.400 --> 3:10:51.400]  disingenuous
[3:10:51.400 --> 3:10:55.640]  yeah but clearly ellen your employer tried to hide jack
[3:10:55.640 --> 3:10:57.320]  fox and others
[3:10:57.320 --> 3:11:00.480]  and talk radio neocontact radio tried
[3:11:00.480 --> 3:11:05.480]  to take it over and did to a certain extent but i was there we had ron paul
[3:11:05.480 --> 3:11:06.520]  tea parties
[3:11:06.520 --> 3:11:08.840]  here in austin last october
[3:11:08.840 --> 3:11:13.120]  uh... we and and and they had them in dc in boston and san diego
[3:11:13.120 --> 3:11:16.680]  we we started that the tea parties
[3:11:16.680 --> 3:11:21.400]  along came shot hannity and rush limbaugh
[3:11:21.400 --> 3:11:26.040]  they try to make this a republican versus democratic thing but then claim
[3:11:26.040 --> 3:11:27.520]  it was bipartisan
[3:11:27.520 --> 3:11:29.440]  if it had nothing to do with parties
[3:11:29.440 --> 3:11:32.440]  but it certainly was at least what it became was not what you originally
[3:11:32.440 --> 3:11:33.400]  started
[3:11:33.400 --> 3:11:37.520]  what it evolved into was let's bash obama let's bash the democrats
[3:11:37.520 --> 3:11:39.920]  but we're going to claim it's grassroots we're going to claim
[3:11:39.920 --> 3:11:41.240]  that it's bipartisan
[3:11:41.240 --> 3:11:44.040]  none of which it was at least in terms of the recent
[3:11:44.040 --> 3:11:45.360]  april fifteenth
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:47.640]  so-called tea party with people forget to
[3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:49.800]  meeting at the tea party the original tea party
[3:11:49.800 --> 3:11:52.840]  was about taxation with that representation
[3:11:52.840 --> 3:11:57.760]  is representation they just lost an election that's what that was about
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:01.600]  well i mean alan is bipartisan ninety eight percent of americans and gallup
[3:12:01.600 --> 3:12:04.080]  poll and they were saying that they were getting thousand one phone calls in
[3:12:04.080 --> 3:12:06.640]  congress against the banker bailout
[3:12:06.640 --> 3:12:10.480]  i mean that is bipartisan that folks don't like what happened at the party's
[3:12:10.480 --> 3:12:13.760]  i'm talking about the fact that the tea party was basically organized
[3:12:13.760 --> 3:12:15.880]  by three conservative groups
[3:12:15.880 --> 3:12:18.880]  groups like dick army's group newt gingrich was involved in it
[3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:19.760]  to say that
[3:12:19.760 --> 3:12:21.920]  this is a with a bipartisan effort
[3:12:21.920 --> 3:12:24.920]  i'm talking about specific the what happens to the people that would happen
[3:12:24.920 --> 3:12:26.000]  on april fifteenth
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:27.200]  was not bipartisan
[3:12:27.200 --> 3:12:28.440]  was not grassroots
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:32.240]  well my issue is when i see people are jenny garofalo
[3:12:32.240 --> 3:12:36.160]  get up and say everyone is a racist that is racism
[3:12:36.160 --> 3:12:39.160]  that is what i did that isn't a racism
[3:12:39.160 --> 3:12:39.960]  go ahead
[3:12:39.960 --> 3:12:42.280]  if i'm sorry alex here's my problem
[3:12:42.280 --> 3:12:44.840]  i don't agree with what jenny garofalo said
[3:12:44.840 --> 3:12:47.360]  my problem is those who don't agree with me
[3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:48.480]  who will hold up
[3:12:48.480 --> 3:12:50.000]  comment like that and say
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:51.400]  see you liberals
[3:12:51.400 --> 3:12:53.480]  this is the way you liberals are
[3:12:53.480 --> 3:12:55.720]  just like alex i know you get lumped in with people
[3:12:55.720 --> 3:12:57.360]  you may not want to be lumped in with
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:12:59.440]  but every time some left-wing wacko
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:01.160]  said something about something stupid
[3:13:01.160 --> 3:13:03.800]  it becomes this is how the right will define the left
[3:13:03.800 --> 3:13:05.640]  any and that shouldn't happen anymore
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:07.480]  that people who are members of the clan
[3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:11.080]  to define the right for example but i wasn't trying to lump you in i'd
[3:13:11.080 --> 3:13:14.680]  like to tell you but listen i figured that you were gonna not like what she
[3:13:14.680 --> 3:13:18.040]  said because i think i know you pretty well right but it's the same thing
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:20.600]  some guy visits my website out of hundreds
[3:13:20.600 --> 3:13:22.200]  shoots three cops
[3:13:22.200 --> 3:13:25.240]  and then the southern parvy law center associates
[3:13:25.240 --> 3:13:29.880]  me with him and it comes out later what he was doing on my site was attacking
[3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:33.080]  me now that's really not fair look as i said to you
[3:13:33.080 --> 3:13:34.920]  uh... the other day when you did my show
[3:13:34.920 --> 3:13:36.760]  i was followed around new york
[3:13:36.760 --> 3:13:39.880]  by nine eleven truthers many of whom do things in your name
[3:13:39.880 --> 3:13:43.240]  i was harassed by these people i know that many of them are followers are
[3:13:43.240 --> 3:13:45.800]  least uh... listeners and supporters of you
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:50.520]  but i don't hold you i don't hold you personally accountable for their behavior
[3:13:50.520 --> 3:13:54.200]  well i appreciate that and i'm glad that uh... but
[3:13:54.200 --> 3:13:57.320]  i mean that's overall just another issue i don't get sidetracked completely on
[3:13:57.320 --> 3:14:00.840]  that i just wanted to ask you about it you brought up the team parties
[3:14:00.840 --> 3:14:04.040]  in the media keep saying teabagging so much almost just said it
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:08.520]  uh... allen allen wrote what do you really think of obama i mean has any
[3:14:08.520 --> 3:14:12.040]  gone back on a lot of his promises
[3:14:12.040 --> 3:14:13.400]  though he's not
[3:14:13.400 --> 3:14:14.200]  uh...
[3:14:14.200 --> 3:14:17.960]  we all know that governing and running for office to different things i don't
[3:14:17.960 --> 3:14:20.840]  see him as somebody who went back a lot of his promises
[3:14:20.840 --> 3:14:24.120]  he said we get out of a rock in sixteen months in terms of
[3:14:24.120 --> 3:14:28.280]  uh... you know combat troops okay it's going to be what uh... a few more months
[3:14:28.280 --> 3:14:31.880]  because he compromised with the generals on the ground listening
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:35.400]  to generals on the ground uh... he said he's going to lower taxes for ninety
[3:14:35.400 --> 3:14:36.280]  five percent
[3:14:36.280 --> 3:14:39.560]  of tax-paying americans that seems to be in play
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:42.280]  uh... he said he'd have a bipartisan a cabinet
[3:14:42.280 --> 3:14:45.400]  he's got real hood transportation he kept great gates and uh...
[3:14:45.400 --> 3:14:46.760]  defense he tried to give
[3:14:46.760 --> 3:14:47.960]  jude greg uh...
[3:14:47.960 --> 3:14:51.000]  jude greg punkton he tried to give greg uh... a position
[3:14:51.000 --> 3:14:53.800]  uh... i think he's a very good thing he changed the tone
[3:14:53.800 --> 3:14:55.160]  he talked to our enemies
[3:14:55.160 --> 3:14:57.520]  he's doing a lot of things he said he would do
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:14:59.800]  and he said if you got republicans saying
[3:14:59.800 --> 3:15:01.720]  oh my god he's doing too much
[3:15:01.720 --> 3:15:04.120]  what you and yet when bush tried to do
[3:15:04.120 --> 3:15:07.720]  things beside prosecute the war terror we were told of course we can walk and
[3:15:07.720 --> 3:15:09.000]  chew gum at the same time
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:13.000]  okay what about what about lobbyist he said i will not hire lobbyist and boy
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:14.040]  this is
[3:15:14.040 --> 3:15:15.960]  uber uber lobbyist
[3:15:15.960 --> 3:15:16.960]  you can't
[3:15:16.960 --> 3:15:19.920]  uh... yeah that's a tough one you know it's you can't
[3:15:19.920 --> 3:15:22.920]  not hire lobbyist because everybody
[3:15:22.920 --> 3:15:26.440]  uh... everybody's lobbyist i mean i'm not everybody but everybody
[3:15:26.440 --> 3:15:29.760]  among those who will apply for jobs in an administration
[3:15:29.760 --> 3:15:31.240]  there are going to be those
[3:15:31.240 --> 3:15:32.720]  who worked as lobbyist
[3:15:32.720 --> 3:15:36.200]  you know john mccain said he would have a lobbyist of his campaign
[3:15:36.200 --> 3:15:39.960]  his campaign was run by lobbyists i mean they shouldn't lie that's my point
[3:15:39.960 --> 3:15:43.000]  i'm not depending on what i'm going to believe that i mean why do they lie
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:46.240]  that why is it just i mean you even just said it all well there's rhetoric
[3:15:46.240 --> 3:15:48.760]  in a campaign alexa there's governing
[3:15:48.760 --> 3:15:52.960]  i mean why lie then i mean why will not hire one lobbyist while you can say i
[3:15:52.960 --> 3:15:56.560]  don't think ever said i'll not hire one lobbyist uh... but
[3:15:56.560 --> 3:15:59.320]  i think it's like anything else if you were to run for office
[3:15:59.320 --> 3:16:02.840]  you would say a bunch of things and then you get into office okay here's the way it really is
[3:16:02.840 --> 3:16:04.920]  i don't think it's a calculated lie
[3:16:04.920 --> 3:16:07.840]  you want to get him on that okay i'll give you that
[3:16:07.840 --> 3:16:09.200]  lobbyist okay
[3:16:09.200 --> 3:16:11.280]  in general though has he done a good job
[3:16:11.280 --> 3:16:12.240]  as he
[3:16:12.240 --> 3:16:14.480]  i've said done pretty much what he said he's going to do
[3:16:14.480 --> 3:16:16.360]  as he changed the tone in dc
[3:16:16.360 --> 3:16:18.520]  as he tried to reach out to all sides
[3:16:18.520 --> 3:16:20.240]  as he talked to other countries
[3:16:20.240 --> 3:16:21.760]  is he getting it out of a rock
[3:16:21.760 --> 3:16:23.440]  is he dealing with the economy
[3:16:23.440 --> 3:16:25.520]  these are all things that are more important
[3:16:25.520 --> 3:16:29.160]  than a few things you can't okay let's talk about the war because we got an
[3:16:29.160 --> 3:16:33.360]  argument about this he i have video clips of them it's in the obama deception
[3:16:33.360 --> 3:16:35.760]  free online folks the obama deception dot net
[3:16:35.760 --> 3:16:37.240]  he says in there
[3:16:37.240 --> 3:16:40.720]  i will start bringing our troops home immediately the first day
[3:16:40.720 --> 3:16:43.640]  then he says sixteen then twenty three now the generals are saying
[3:16:43.640 --> 3:16:47.840]  all wait we may even want to pull down the fifty thousand permanently
[3:16:47.840 --> 3:16:51.880]  uh... friend six more months after that so now we're out well but i'm aware that
[3:16:51.880 --> 3:16:54.080]  the plan is twenty three i'm also aware
[3:16:54.080 --> 3:16:57.280]  that during the campaign i have to say over and over again sixteen
[3:16:57.280 --> 3:16:59.480]  i don't say we'll get it out the first day
[3:16:59.480 --> 3:17:00.960]  he campaign on
[3:17:00.960 --> 3:17:02.600]  what's his campaign is up and running
[3:17:02.600 --> 3:17:05.920]  a sixteen month timeline with two to three brigades a month
[3:17:05.920 --> 3:17:09.120]  that's what he campaign early on he said immediately
[3:17:09.120 --> 3:17:12.360]  then once he started to get steam he did moderate
[3:17:12.360 --> 3:17:16.320]  to sixteen then twenty three and now they're saying even longer and we'll see
[3:17:16.320 --> 3:17:17.160]  also said
[3:17:17.160 --> 3:17:19.760]  you listen to the troops on the ground listen to the generals on the ground
[3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:21.600]  all exactly what he's doing
[3:17:21.600 --> 3:17:22.800]  what you've got to do
[3:17:22.800 --> 3:17:24.680]  okay what i have some credibility
[3:17:24.680 --> 3:17:26.640]  you don't make the decision for the road guard
[3:17:26.640 --> 3:17:28.760]  okay let's take taxes
[3:17:28.760 --> 3:17:29.720]  uh...
[3:17:29.720 --> 3:17:33.400]  they he's saying he's gonna rewrite the tax code and get rid of uh...
[3:17:33.400 --> 3:17:36.000]  some of the exemptions on property tax
[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:38.760]  or on interest on the mortgage that is a big one
[3:17:38.760 --> 3:17:41.120]  for those of us to pay taxes and on houses we know
[3:17:41.120 --> 3:17:42.440]  i'm sure you know well and
[3:17:42.440 --> 3:17:44.960]  uh... he's talking about these green taxes
[3:17:44.960 --> 3:17:47.680]  these carbon taxes those are taxes
[3:17:47.680 --> 3:17:51.640]  uh... that our people under a hundred twenty five thousand individually here
[3:17:51.640 --> 3:17:54.520]  well we were talking about it could actually talk about the tax rate
[3:17:54.520 --> 3:17:55.640]  the tax rate
[3:17:55.640 --> 3:17:59.520]  is going to be lower for the upper-income people that was under Ronald Reagan
[3:17:59.520 --> 3:18:02.880]  and furthermore under reagan who profess lower taxes
[3:18:02.880 --> 3:18:04.840]  there are these other fees and taxes
[3:18:04.840 --> 3:18:05.920]  that they put in
[3:18:05.920 --> 3:18:07.280]  in order to uh...
[3:18:07.280 --> 3:18:08.680]  make up for what they were
[3:18:08.680 --> 3:18:11.360]  losing and also don't forget now all the states
[3:18:11.360 --> 3:18:13.280]  many of the states are raising taxes
[3:18:13.280 --> 3:18:16.280]  because they need to make up the shortfall and there was the george h
[3:18:16.280 --> 3:18:21.120]  w there was the george h w a retroactive tax i mean i look i agree the
[3:18:21.120 --> 3:18:22.520]  republicans are a bunch of
[3:18:22.520 --> 3:18:25.240]  tax and spenders as well i don't mean i'm not saying
[3:18:25.240 --> 3:18:27.360]  uh... but uh...
[3:18:27.360 --> 3:18:30.680]  i don't know alan uh... i mean what about him saying
[3:18:30.680 --> 3:18:32.800]  he no rights for detainees
[3:18:32.800 --> 3:18:36.520]  what about him saying i'm gonna say you followed orders in urmberg doesn't
[3:18:36.520 --> 3:18:39.600]  matter if you didn't even see i a agents
[3:18:39.600 --> 3:18:41.360]  who were carrying out orders
[3:18:41.360 --> 3:18:43.640]  he was right for detainees they have a right
[3:18:43.640 --> 3:18:45.800]  behavior corpus
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:48.120]  something that was denied under the bush administration
[3:18:48.120 --> 3:18:51.000]  uh... i do have a problem with it i would like to see him
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:53.840]  prosecute even those who were just following orders they know what the
[3:18:53.840 --> 3:18:55.800]  rules are they know what the laws are
[3:18:55.800 --> 3:18:57.400]  they should at least go after those
[3:18:57.400 --> 3:18:59.760]  lawyers like by b and u
[3:18:59.760 --> 3:19:02.000]  who were great for you know the people who
[3:19:02.000 --> 3:19:05.240]  uh... we're obviously telling bush and cheney what they wanted to hear
[3:19:05.240 --> 3:19:07.280]  wrote the so-called torture memos
[3:19:07.280 --> 3:19:08.480]  uh... you know
[3:19:08.480 --> 3:19:11.800]  the new york times i'm sure you and your audience love the new york times but
[3:19:11.800 --> 3:19:12.880]  the truth is
[3:19:12.880 --> 3:19:14.920]  but you know that piece two days ago
[3:19:14.920 --> 3:19:18.320]  but if you did if they did the background and look at historically
[3:19:18.320 --> 3:19:19.000]  where these
[3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:21.560]  torture techniques including waterboarding came from
[3:19:21.560 --> 3:19:26.200]  but i don't think we should and we prosecuted people after world war two
[3:19:26.200 --> 3:19:28.160]  for waterboarding of the same kinds
[3:19:28.160 --> 3:19:30.440]  i mean we would have to keep up with the war criminals
[3:19:30.440 --> 3:19:32.200]  but i think that they were not going
[3:19:32.200 --> 3:19:34.280]  now they executed
[3:19:34.280 --> 3:19:37.240]  japanese soldiers for
[3:19:37.240 --> 3:19:38.720]  uh... and then
[3:19:38.720 --> 3:19:41.960]  they really learned it on the modern times from north korea from from the
[3:19:41.960 --> 3:19:44.360]  korean war from what i've read but your ride goes back to the

[3:24:17.280 --> 3:24:21.200]  obama backs bush no rights for background prisoners no geneva convention
[3:24:21.200 --> 3:24:28.200]  no habeas corpus so there you go the agree with obama on uh... that
[3:24:29.600 --> 3:24:36.600]  so you don't agree with him on that
[3:24:41.740 --> 3:24:43.600]  you are very good alex at pulling out
[3:24:43.600 --> 3:24:45.120]  those particular instances
[3:24:45.120 --> 3:24:46.520]  or don't agree with him
[3:24:46.520 --> 3:24:49.200]  does that mean i think he's i but i still think he's doing a great job as
[3:24:49.200 --> 3:24:51.440]  president
[3:24:51.440 --> 3:24:52.720]  i disagree
[3:24:52.720 --> 3:24:54.800]  you went after bush you went after obama
[3:24:54.800 --> 3:24:57.600]  you're going to have to work as an office probably
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:00.840]  uh... generally speaking we have transparency in this
[3:25:00.840 --> 3:25:04.320]  administration like we did that not have before what i find amazing here you
[3:25:04.320 --> 3:25:04.960]  have
[3:25:04.960 --> 3:25:06.880]  obama release the torture memos
[3:25:06.880 --> 3:25:08.720]  cheney comes forward now he says
[3:25:08.720 --> 3:25:10.000]  let's release the stuff
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:11.680]  that shows the torture works
[3:25:11.680 --> 3:25:14.500]  so all of a sudden you got cheney calling for transparency
[3:25:14.500 --> 3:25:15.640]  when he's been
[3:25:15.640 --> 3:25:17.800]  quiet and this is not the most transparent
[3:25:17.800 --> 3:25:19.480]  it by president we've ever had
[3:25:19.480 --> 3:25:21.480]  and that's only the obama's president
[3:25:21.480 --> 3:25:23.000]  what transparency
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:26.680]  no i'm saying it was bad when bush was doing it it's bad now what obama's
[3:25:26.680 --> 3:25:30.240]  doing it you know it was a lot worse when bush at least
[3:25:30.240 --> 3:25:32.120]  with obama you have transparency
[3:25:32.120 --> 3:25:33.440]  he's changing the tone
[3:25:33.440 --> 3:25:35.000]  he's doing both the things right
[3:25:35.000 --> 3:25:38.200]  i don't agree with him on that going after the cia people and i don't agree
[3:25:38.200 --> 3:25:38.760]  with him
[3:25:38.760 --> 3:25:39.400]  retreating
[3:25:39.400 --> 3:25:40.920]  that giving detainees
[3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:43.920]  uh... certain rights uh... human rights attorneys also seem to agree with
[3:25:43.920 --> 3:25:44.720]  the others
[3:25:44.720 --> 3:25:46.920]  on the right side i don't like it
[3:25:46.920 --> 3:25:49.840]  uh... uh... you know again but on balance
[3:25:49.840 --> 3:25:51.640]  he's much better at this stuff
[3:25:51.640 --> 3:25:52.800]  the last administration
[3:25:52.800 --> 3:25:56.080]  okay now let's in the time we've got like i got two final questions for a
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:25:58.480]  really want you to answer these
[3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:02.880]  i heard a audio clip online of you saying more power to the belterberg group
[3:26:02.880 --> 3:26:06.040]  but we've gotten some of their minutes they've admitted they help covertly set
[3:26:06.040 --> 3:26:09.240]  up the e you know i was kidding it was a sarcastic remark
[3:26:09.240 --> 3:26:11.560]  now i don't know but you remember ten years ago in the media said belterberg
[3:26:11.560 --> 3:26:12.800]  group didn't exist
[3:26:12.800 --> 3:26:14.040]  and now
[3:26:14.040 --> 3:26:16.540]  uh... okay so you were kidding about that but but that
[3:26:16.540 --> 3:26:20.200]  all i just want to work out like i don't find me alone about
[3:26:20.200 --> 3:26:21.320]  i understand now
[3:26:21.320 --> 3:26:24.880]  what about hundreds of mainstream news articles saying new world order and then
[3:26:24.880 --> 3:26:25.880]  defining it
[3:26:25.880 --> 3:26:27.600]  a bank of the world
[3:26:27.600 --> 3:26:31.240]  that we pay carbon taxes to the controls the world's interest rates
[3:26:31.240 --> 3:26:32.640]  and currency values
[3:26:32.640 --> 3:26:33.800]  look uh...
[3:26:33.800 --> 3:26:35.960]  alec i know that you are
[3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:40.080]  i believe conspiracy theories will take over the world and i think that uh...
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:43.480]  bill these groups were all leading toward one world government
[3:26:43.480 --> 3:26:46.400]  i don't think our sovereignty is in jeopardy as you might
[3:26:46.400 --> 3:26:50.120]  i i'm not terribly interested in the belterberg and i worried about them
[3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:53.720]  it doesn't really interest me i know we get calls about this all the time
[3:26:53.720 --> 3:26:56.400]  but to me that this is not a true threat
[3:26:56.400 --> 3:26:58.200]  to our sovereignty or democracy
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:01.160]  well i was joking with you in the break singer worried the conspiracy
[3:27:01.160 --> 3:27:03.040]  theory of the world my whole point is
[3:27:03.040 --> 3:27:06.240]  reality is going to win the day in tyranny is going to fail
[3:27:06.240 --> 3:27:09.400]  the world is moving towards a lot of tyranny i mean i wouldn't you say the
[3:27:09.400 --> 3:27:10.560]  the world is in a
[3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:12.720]  trend towards tyranny and
[3:27:12.720 --> 3:27:15.600]  uh... big god now i think it's actually with obama as a leader of the free
[3:27:15.600 --> 3:27:17.520]  world right in the opposite direction
[3:27:17.520 --> 3:27:20.280]  i think when we had the last administration believed in preemptive
[3:27:20.280 --> 3:27:21.160]  war
[3:27:21.160 --> 3:27:24.480]  that believed in violating the constitution to the extent that it did
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:28.040]  that did not believe in habeas corpus i believe during that administration we
[3:27:28.040 --> 3:27:28.800]  were much
[3:27:28.800 --> 3:27:30.680]  more in the direction of tyranny
[3:27:30.680 --> 3:27:31.600]  and we are now
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:32.840]  okay but alan
[3:27:32.840 --> 3:27:35.660]  certainly on the open it was much worse
[3:27:35.660 --> 3:27:38.200]  now because he's got a pretty face on it
[3:27:38.200 --> 3:27:39.480]  and well-spoken
[3:27:39.480 --> 3:27:42.440]  and does a few things like releasing a few of the memos but then says
[3:27:42.440 --> 3:27:43.500]  i agree with it
[3:27:43.500 --> 3:27:47.560]  uh... that it's going to get worse because now he's going to do that
[3:27:47.560 --> 3:27:49.920]  okay fine you don't agree with that but here's the issue
[3:27:49.920 --> 3:27:52.600]  are they not announcing a new world order
[3:27:52.600 --> 3:27:56.560]  all over the news and saying it's exactly what we said it was a private
[3:27:56.560 --> 3:27:59.720]  group of banks ruling the planet
[3:27:59.720 --> 3:28:02.760]  i don't think that i think you believe this is underbelly
[3:28:02.760 --> 3:28:04.320]  it really runs everything
[3:28:04.320 --> 3:28:05.800]  and the building to take over
[3:28:05.800 --> 3:28:07.560]  and we're moving toward one world government
[3:28:07.560 --> 3:28:08.360]  as i'm gonna
[3:28:08.360 --> 3:28:09.640]  and repeating myself
[3:28:09.640 --> 3:28:13.560]  i am more sanguine about our ability to maintain our sovereignty
[3:28:13.560 --> 3:28:16.840]  uh... i'm not threat that stuff doesn't threaten me like it does you there's an
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:19.040]  overbelly this is not an underbelly
[3:28:19.040 --> 3:28:24.440]  uh... i mean this is the head here that is not the belly with text crawling
[3:28:24.440 --> 3:28:28.200]  along it i don't i don't have the fear that you do that this is what's going
[3:28:28.200 --> 3:28:28.680]  to happen
[3:28:28.680 --> 3:28:32.240]  wait a minute i mean you're saying that they're not announcing
[3:28:32.240 --> 3:28:35.520]  you know times of london financial times of london headline
[3:28:35.520 --> 3:28:37.920]  and now for world government
[3:28:37.920 --> 3:28:39.400]  i think there are people
[3:28:39.400 --> 3:28:41.760]  who would prefer probably some people who'd like it
[3:28:41.760 --> 3:28:43.880]  the people like you probably fear it
[3:28:43.880 --> 3:28:46.160]  i don't think it's a realistic fear
[3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:51.160]  do you think global government would be a good thing
[3:28:51.160 --> 3:28:52.240]  i think it would be great
[3:28:52.240 --> 3:28:54.720]  have a relationship with even our enemies
[3:28:54.720 --> 3:28:56.280]  but that doesn't mean global government
[3:28:56.280 --> 3:28:58.360]  i like the fact that obama's reaching out
[3:28:58.360 --> 3:29:02.240]  to our perceived enemies actually touching them by taking their hands
[3:29:02.240 --> 3:29:03.520]  and accepting their books
[3:29:03.520 --> 3:29:04.760]  and saying we should
[3:29:04.760 --> 3:29:08.520]  you know hopefully next will release you know or take to do away with the uh...
[3:29:08.520 --> 3:29:10.080]  embargo in cuba
[3:29:10.080 --> 3:29:12.440]  but i think those are all very good well i don't know
[3:29:12.440 --> 3:29:13.920]  but i don't mean one world government
[3:29:13.920 --> 3:29:17.960]  alan alan dot com and and you're on the radio weeknights uh... what uh...
[3:29:17.960 --> 3:29:21.040]  what is it nine and one eastern
[3:29:21.040 --> 3:29:24.960]  and to one eastern tender yet and one eastern item at night central

[3:29:29.760 --> 3:29:33.320]  when he was at the state in illinois is not demanding that he's not taking away
[3:29:33.320 --> 3:29:36.400]  ammunition your guns are safe ammunition safe enough to go out by the

[3:29:49.280 --> 3:29:51.600]  so you support that alan you're something else
[3:29:51.600 --> 3:29:53.000]  we're on the march

[3:34:36.280 --> 3:34:40.840]  let me just go over some of the background from these articles that i
[3:34:40.840 --> 3:34:45.080]  started covering before our interview with alan combs came up
[3:34:45.080 --> 3:34:48.920]  hey did you hear alan combs say he's giving rights to the detainees
[3:34:48.920 --> 3:34:52.520]  and then i came back from uh during the break i said oh really alan are you in
[3:34:52.520 --> 3:34:55.560]  front of a computer he said yeah and i said google
[3:34:55.560 --> 3:34:59.720]  obama backs bush no rights for detainees and he googled it
[3:34:59.720 --> 3:35:03.320]  and there was all the mainstream news with obama's statement in his executive
[3:35:03.320 --> 3:35:06.440]  order that they would continue to secretly hold them with no habeas corpus
[3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:11.720]  no geneva convention and alan had to say oh i disagree with that
[3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:16.520]  i mean just and we have the videos and his statements he did say
[3:35:16.520 --> 3:35:21.400]  he'd bring the troops some immediately that's 16 and 23 now
[3:35:21.400 --> 3:35:25.800]  they're saying indefinitely that's how it works oh yeah
[3:35:25.800 --> 3:35:32.200]  immediately 16 23 42 never
[3:35:32.920 --> 3:35:35.480]  and they're gonna have parades though for returning brigades you know they send
[3:35:35.480 --> 3:35:38.840]  brigades over and bring brigades back that's how they do it now as a total
[3:35:38.840 --> 3:35:42.360]  force they don't just replace individuals so all of the troops are
[3:35:42.360 --> 3:35:46.200]  marching home victory done done done done done done they'll be like alex the
[3:35:46.200 --> 3:35:49.240]  war is over and i'm like oh really more suicide bombings more death
[3:35:49.240 --> 3:35:52.440]  oh you're just a defeatist
[3:35:54.600 --> 3:35:58.200]  there is no end to the lies folks they're just but see under obama they'll just
[3:35:58.200 --> 3:36:02.360]  say the war is over and that's the end of it
[3:36:02.360 --> 3:36:07.000]  the war is over it's all over for the
[3:36:07.000 --> 3:36:13.160]  unknown soldier it's all over for him
[3:36:14.360 --> 3:36:17.560]  okay i told you about death education just a smattering of what's happening
[3:36:17.560 --> 3:36:20.680]  to schools world end daily death education at columbine
[3:36:20.680 --> 3:36:26.840]  heim and it says uh that uh they admitted that
[3:36:26.840 --> 3:36:30.520]  they were given death education
[3:36:31.080 --> 3:36:34.680]  and they teach you how to die how to hang yourself how to kill yourself
[3:36:34.680 --> 3:36:38.280]  a video was made of tires testimony distributed nationwide by eagle forum
[3:36:38.280 --> 3:36:40.520]  the tape was aired on british television and the
[3:36:40.520 --> 3:36:43.960]  atlantic monthly did a feature story on it the producers of 2020 saw the video
[3:36:43.960 --> 3:36:46.120]  and decided to do a segment on the death education
[3:36:46.120 --> 3:36:50.520]  that was aired in 1990 at columbine and in the video it teaches them how to die
[3:36:50.520 --> 3:36:53.800]  in coffins how to kill themselves
[3:36:54.920 --> 3:37:01.400]  and it just gets into the unbelievable how the suicides just explode so
[3:37:01.400 --> 3:37:05.000]  there you go here's another one armed men
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:09.720]  terrorized school unannounced here's another one all over the country where
[3:37:09.720 --> 3:37:14.520]  they unannounced show up wcau tv and say we're going to kill you
[3:37:14.520 --> 3:37:18.200]  where terrorists and everybody freaks out and
[3:37:18.200 --> 3:37:22.280]  you know passes out from fear i mean that is the most hardcore form of
[3:37:22.280 --> 3:37:26.680]  fear based mind control i've got an ap article
[3:37:26.680 --> 3:37:30.840]  out of michigan where they came in and said we are the home school
[3:37:30.840 --> 3:37:35.800]  defense league and we're going to kill you
[3:37:35.800 --> 3:37:38.200]  and
[3:37:39.400 --> 3:37:45.080]  it just goes on and on on that front but again that's a demonized home
[3:37:45.080 --> 3:37:49.160]  school or second amendment groups and to unannounce freak the kids out and
[3:37:49.160 --> 3:37:52.120]  terrorize them where they're scared of guns for the rest of their life that's
[3:37:52.120 --> 3:37:55.800]  how you kill the second amendment traumatize the children
[3:37:55.800 --> 3:37:58.920]  and also sets the precedent to allow the police and military to do whatever
[3:37:58.920 --> 3:38:03.400]  they want to get away with whatever they want
[3:38:03.400 --> 3:38:08.440]  classroom trash can used as toilet a fifth grade teacher allowed five
[3:38:08.440 --> 3:38:12.360]  students a boy and four girls to use a trash can as a toilet during a school
[3:38:12.360 --> 3:38:15.320]  lockdown drill when no one was supposed to leave the classrooms
[3:38:15.320 --> 3:38:19.480]  the charleston county teacher philip frenando was reprimanded
[3:38:19.480 --> 3:38:22.680]  should have just made him defecate on the ground i guess last year for putting
[3:38:22.680 --> 3:38:26.120]  cardboard around a student's desk and keeping him isolated from his
[3:38:26.120 --> 3:38:29.560]  classmates for two hours from talking
[3:38:29.560 --> 3:38:33.320]  whatever that means on tuesday frenando gave the
[3:38:33.320 --> 3:38:36.600]  charleston academy students permission to use the trash can
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:39.880]  when a girl used the bathroom other girls held up jackets
[3:38:39.880 --> 3:38:43.640]  to shield the view while the students stood on the opposite with the wall
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:47.160]  with their backs turned school district spokesman jenny adams said boys
[3:38:47.160 --> 3:38:51.160]  also did the same for the boy it is not acceptable associate superintendent
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:55.400]  patricia yandall told the newspaper so so yeah they
[3:38:55.400 --> 3:38:58.440]  were supposed to just urinate in their pants i guess
[3:38:58.440 --> 3:39:02.600]  during the drill which lasted less than an hour this is another article they
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:07.480]  found i found when they had to stay in the classroom all day with no lunches
[3:39:07.480 --> 3:39:10.600]  but we tried to google that and couldn't find it during the drill which lasts
[3:39:10.600 --> 3:39:13.560]  less than an hour frenando called the school's main office and said students
[3:39:13.560 --> 3:39:16.760]  needed to use the restroom it was unclear what he was told
[3:39:16.760 --> 3:39:21.720]  but yandell was said he was not told to leave students to use the trash can
[3:39:21.720 --> 3:39:26.600]  so uh that was a lockdown drill here's another one washed in post
[3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:31.480]  school boost preparations for attack many anti-terror plans would stop parents
[3:39:31.480 --> 3:39:34.280]  from picking up children school administration the

[3:43:06.360 --> 3:43:10.520]  students practical applications of what they're learning
[3:43:10.520 --> 3:43:13.960]  see it's part of trauma-based mind control folks and then
[3:43:13.960 --> 3:43:18.280]  people then love their oppressors that's also the psychology they're going for
[3:43:18.280 --> 3:43:21.160]  the people that shocked them some students brought up questions about
[3:43:21.160 --> 3:43:25.240]  coast of a situation and then it's got quotes about
[3:43:25.240 --> 3:43:28.760]  bill clinton wanted you to know what marshal law is like
[3:43:28.760 --> 3:43:32.440]  remember that from 10 years ago let me find the marshal law
[3:43:32.440 --> 3:43:38.520]  bill clinton bill clinton bill clinton

[3:43:42.840 --> 3:43:45.880]  you want i'm going from 10-year memory there maybe
[3:43:45.880 --> 3:43:50.040]  another middle school there was several articles in the
[3:43:50.040 --> 3:43:52.680]  in the principal journal and that's problem with 10-year-old memory i
[3:43:52.680 --> 3:43:54.840]  remember that today and had him google it and they found it but
[3:43:54.840 --> 3:43:59.160]  they were like i'm gonna say three articles about it
[3:43:59.160 --> 3:44:03.560]  so there's others uh michigan school district portrays homeschoolers this
[3:44:03.560 --> 3:44:08.520]  terrorist this is a homeschool world alert but i remember i found this in ap
[3:44:08.520 --> 3:44:13.240]  on monday september 20th the muskagon
[3:44:13.240 --> 3:44:18.040]  chronicle in michigan reported on a mock attack on public school bus to test
[3:44:18.040 --> 3:44:22.280]  terrorism response according to the paper the exercise was a simulated attack
[3:44:22.280 --> 3:44:26.120]  by a fictitious radical group called wackos against schools
[3:44:26.120 --> 3:44:30.200]  and education who believe everyone should be homeschool
[3:44:30.200 --> 3:44:33.080]  now now imagine is that trying to demonize homeschoolers and we've now
[3:44:33.080 --> 3:44:36.600]  the federal documents are out they are demonizing homeschoolers
[3:44:36.600 --> 3:44:40.040]  in federal documents i told you this and then they pay cops
[3:44:40.040 --> 3:44:44.200]  to go out and brainwash the public and imagine the kids go home and go yeah
[3:44:44.200 --> 3:44:47.000]  the unannounced came out and threw fake blood on us put guns to our heads and
[3:44:47.000 --> 3:44:50.840]  said we're wacko homeschoolers against public education
[3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:54.120]  but this this was in the ap
[3:44:54.440 --> 3:44:59.000]  like it's normal but again this goes on everywhere i just read you marines
[3:44:59.000 --> 3:45:02.200]  doing it according to the paper the exercise was simulated attack by a
[3:45:02.200 --> 3:45:05.960]  fictitious group radical group called wackos against schools
[3:45:05.960 --> 3:45:09.160]  and education to believe everybody should be homeschool
[3:45:09.160 --> 3:45:12.680]  that's the way to demonize homeschoolers certainly disaster preparedness is
[3:45:12.680 --> 3:45:16.040]  important but the terrorists are portrayed as homeschoolers who think
[3:45:16.040 --> 3:45:19.720]  everybody should have to homeschool
[3:45:19.720 --> 3:45:23.400]  meanwhile we are trying to ban homeschooling we immediately call them
[3:45:23.400 --> 3:45:28.040]  muskegon chronicle and explain how this is offensive to millions of people
[3:45:28.040 --> 3:45:31.640]  who have chosen to exercise their rights to homeschool
[3:45:31.640 --> 3:45:35.960]  imagine if they said you know wacko black people against home against public
[3:45:35.960 --> 3:45:40.520]  schools or wacko asians or wacko mexicans or wacko
[3:45:40.520 --> 3:45:44.040]  whites folks will get upset but no it's homeschoolers it's okay
[3:45:44.040 --> 3:45:48.200]  but it's the drill itself homeschoolers never have committed violent acts against
[3:45:48.200 --> 3:45:51.560]  the public schools or any terrorist acts it has not been homeschooled children
[3:45:51.560 --> 3:45:54.760]  who have walked in public schools shooting everybody in anyone but rather
[3:45:54.760 --> 3:45:58.040]  public school children comparing us to the most dangerous people in the world
[3:45:58.040 --> 3:46:01.640]  is a terrible insult in the travesty the newspaper promised to print a response
[3:46:01.640 --> 3:46:05.320]  in a follow-up story calls already a poured into muskegon
[3:46:05.320 --> 3:46:11.480]  intermediate school guys google muskegon intermediate

[3:46:35.320 --> 3:46:39.560]  told us we had to do it this way today the homeschool terrorists in a simulated
[3:46:39.560 --> 3:46:42.680]  attack struck a busload of students in the white
[3:46:42.680 --> 3:46:46.920]  hall area killing more than a half dozen and sending dozens more to hospital
[3:46:46.920 --> 3:46:49.720]  although the attack was not real it looked real to the students
[3:46:49.720 --> 3:46:53.720]  emergency personnel and firefighters responded as if it was real
[3:46:53.720 --> 3:46:56.600]  because they come in and not tell them it they you know they tell them it's it's
[3:46:56.600 --> 3:46:59.640]  they don't tell them it's a drill the exercise was funded by the federal
[3:46:59.640 --> 3:47:02.600]  homeland security grants awarded to several area school districts
[3:47:02.600 --> 3:47:07.640]  and muskegon county michigan muskegon area intermediate school district
[3:47:07.640 --> 3:47:10.120]  partner with the muskegon county emergency services
[3:47:10.120 --> 3:47:14.280]  to implement the mock terror attack according to muskegon chronicle the
[3:47:14.280 --> 3:47:17.000]  exercise was simulated attack by a fictitious radical group called the
[3:47:17.000 --> 3:47:20.600]  wackos against schools education and believe everybody should be
[3:47:20.600 --> 3:47:24.600]  homeschool eight or nine
[3:47:26.360 --> 3:47:30.440]  i can't even read that word oh deceased students
[3:47:30.440 --> 3:47:36.680]  represented by mannequins were transported to the county morgue
[3:47:36.680 --> 3:47:40.040]  frantic parents ran to schools and hospital emergency rooms
[3:47:40.040 --> 3:47:44.120]  so that was out of the local newspaper the
[3:47:44.120 --> 3:47:48.120]  whatever it is it's up there in the article the muskegon chronicle
[3:47:48.120 --> 3:47:52.200]  and it says apology issued by the county september 21 2004
[3:47:52.200 --> 3:47:55.400]  the muskegon area intermediate school districts
[3:47:55.400 --> 3:47:58.760]  shared the disappointment of others when we learned that september 21 2004
[3:47:58.760 --> 3:48:01.880]  emergency preparedness drill referenced homeschoolers as the fictitious
[3:48:01.880 --> 3:48:05.720]  group responsible for the mock disaster we apologize according to dan
[3:48:05.720 --> 3:48:10.760]  stout chief deputy emergency services muskegon county the scenario was
[3:48:10.760 --> 3:48:14.760]  constructed in his office a sample scenario
[3:48:14.760 --> 3:48:17.800]  this is where it says the feds in my memory serves i haven't read this yet i
[3:48:17.800 --> 3:48:21.800]  read this no five years ago was required in order to receive the
[3:48:21.800 --> 3:48:25.160]  necessary funding for the staged event the muskegon area
[3:48:25.160 --> 3:48:28.120]  intermediate school district and local schools did not construct a scenario
[3:48:28.120 --> 3:48:32.200]  but participated other county agencies hospitals emergency responders
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:37.000]  and conducting the drill okay the ap said it was federal but you can hear
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:41.000]  him saying it wasn't theirs but you find the ap
[3:48:41.000 --> 3:48:43.640]  you know they they pulled their stuff after a few years
[3:48:43.640 --> 3:48:46.840]  it's kind of like big brother gets rid of what he said before the exercise will
[3:48:46.840 --> 3:48:49.640]  meant to sharpen the skills in response time of our emergency services
[3:48:49.640 --> 3:48:56.280]  personnel was unfortunately clotted by the choice of the fictional group
[3:48:56.280 --> 3:48:59.080]  and it goes on to say homeland security oh yeah they said earlier homeland
[3:48:59.080 --> 3:49:02.440]  security did it uh... with with a grant i'm sorry
[3:49:02.440 --> 3:49:05.800]  uh... in the world that i'm just too obsessed with trying to see my memories
[3:49:05.800 --> 3:49:09.480]  accurate uh... in the world today homeland security is
[3:49:09.480 --> 3:49:13.160]  very important issue the training of our nation responded blah blah blah
[3:49:13.160 --> 3:49:18.920]  homeland security okay girl handing out cough drops accused of selling drugs
[3:49:18.920 --> 3:49:21.800]  at school gave her friend a cough drop
[3:49:21.800 --> 3:49:24.760]  uh...
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:29.160]  bunch of other news and i mean i've just got too much of this okay i'm done i'm
[3:49:29.160 --> 3:49:33.000]  done covering and i'm done i want to bring ted anderson up here at the end
[3:49:33.000 --> 3:49:36.680]  because gold has moved massively back up in the news is saying it's going to go
[3:49:36.680 --> 3:49:39.880]  past nine hundred and probably keep sailing i don't know i just know the
[3:49:39.880 --> 3:49:42.200]  way they're devaluing the dollar it's going to get into gold
[3:49:42.200 --> 3:49:45.960]  but ted's got silver way below what i've seen it being sold everywhere else
[3:49:45.960 --> 3:49:49.960]  and it's a collector coin the Lakota nation and he's selling out of these
[3:49:49.960 --> 3:49:52.920]  folks these are hard to get they're like twenty five bucks everywhere else i've
[3:49:52.920 --> 3:49:56.440]  seen he's got them for what seventeen something ted telling about it
[3:49:56.440 --> 3:50:00.520]  yeah i do actually there at seventeen seventy one right now and now the thing
[3:50:00.520 --> 3:50:05.000]  about the Lakota nation coin is that it's so popular because of the fact that
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:09.160]  they have a currency value on it and uh... and it has to do with the sovereign
[3:50:09.160 --> 3:50:13.480]  nation uh... we see what happened to the liberty dollar and that stuff when they
[3:50:13.480 --> 3:50:17.000]  the government stepped in and and it's like the collector market just moved
[3:50:17.000 --> 3:50:19.720]  in on them and jumped them up over a hundred bucks a piece are you kidding
[3:50:19.720 --> 3:50:23.080]  me there were three hundred four hundred bucks is still over a hundred so yeah this is people waiting
[3:50:23.080 --> 3:50:26.040]  for a train wreck i think that's reason these are selling for so much but you've
[3:50:26.040 --> 3:50:30.280]  got them at what you bought them for right exactly there at seventeen seventy one
[3:50:30.280 --> 3:50:33.800]  and even consider the fact that silver went up today it's that that is a
[3:50:33.800 --> 3:50:36.920]  fabulous price on those it's a great way to get in rounds
[3:50:36.920 --> 3:50:40.760]  gold is up to alex we should talk about that way in the last week i told you last

[3:55:47.480 --> 3:55:51.960]  be lost but when the public finally finds out a lot of us are awake but a lot
[3:55:51.960 --> 3:55:54.840]  of mar and in a way that's kind of a good thing because

[3:55:58.920 --> 3:56:01.400]  that's good because it gives us a chance to get protected
