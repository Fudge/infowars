[00:00.000 --> 00:18.860]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[00:18.860 --> 00:30.320]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Sunday, May 17th, 2015. I'm David Knight. I'll be your host.
[00:30.320 --> 00:35.840]  We're also going to have Paul Joseph Watson joining us in the second hour. In the next
[00:35.840 --> 00:41.040]  segment, Alex is going to be joining us with a special report. He's got a special report about
[00:41.040 --> 00:45.720]  essentially we've been under a lot of attack lately and he's going to break down some of the
[00:45.720 --> 00:50.980]  more ridiculous attacks for you. We are over the target and when that happens we get a lot of
[00:50.980 --> 00:55.420]  attacks. I'm also going to go over there's a lot of news that's on info wars today. Listen to
[00:55.420 --> 01:00.460]  some of these headlines. UK Prime Minister David Cameron proclaims it's not enough that you follow
[01:00.460 --> 01:06.180]  the law. You must love big brother. Listen to what he actually said. Here's the quote. This is
[01:06.180 --> 01:12.380]  from David Cameron. For too long we have been a passively tolerant society saying to our citizens
[01:12.380 --> 01:20.420]  as long as you obey the law, we'll leave you alone. What's he going to do for people? What's he
[01:20.420 --> 01:25.500]  not going? How's he going to change this now? I don't really understand the contract as it's
[01:25.500 --> 01:31.300]  going to be changed in the UK. We have contract law, not a dictatorship in the West. Supposedly
[01:31.300 --> 01:35.540]  we have contracts like the Constitution, like laws that are written by our legislatures,
[01:35.540 --> 01:41.340]  things that recognize the fact that when you obey the law, you are left alone by the government.
[01:41.340 --> 01:46.140]  That's been the contract. That's been the fundamental contract traditionally in English and
[01:46.140 --> 01:52.340]  American law for centuries. So now he's saying for far too long we've done that. We've just been
[01:52.340 --> 01:57.220]  passively tolerant of people who obey the law, but that's not enough. We're not going to leave
[01:57.220 --> 02:02.580]  you alone if you obey the law. Now a lot of people tweeted this out and said, as Glenn
[02:02.580 --> 02:08.020]  Greenwall said, this is really the mentality of Her Majesty's government. It's now not enough for
[02:08.020 --> 02:12.820]  you to obey. You must love Big Brother. Quite frankly, I don't see anything in that about
[02:12.820 --> 02:19.340]  loving Big Brother. I see them analyzing every aspect of your life as we've seen the NSA do,
[02:19.340 --> 02:25.220]  looking at your social media, looking at your metadata from your phone company, following
[02:25.220 --> 02:32.220]  everywhere you go, tracking and taxing you, and constantly analyzing you to see if you are doing
[02:32.220 --> 02:37.060]  something unusual. I mean, that's the whole aspect of mastering the human domain. You know,
[02:37.060 --> 02:43.220]  people are talking about Jade Helm 15. That's what concerns me is the aspect of the surveillance
[02:43.220 --> 02:48.740]  state, the idea that they are going to analyze everything that you do in a pre-crime type of
[02:48.740 --> 02:53.260]  way. They say they're not looking for anybody that's committing any crimes. It fits perfectly with
[02:53.260 --> 02:58.300]  what Cameron is saying in the UK because this is being brought out, rolled out in all the countries
[02:58.300 --> 03:03.740]  at the same time, just like the TPP. They're saying we're not looking for criminals. We're just
[03:03.740 --> 03:08.220]  looking for things that are unusual. And then we'll decide if that's something we should be
[03:08.220 --> 03:12.020]  worried about. Well, let's look at some of the things that they're doing now. We've got a North
[03:12.020 --> 03:16.820]  Carolina woman that's being evicted from her own land because she's living in a tent. Why is she
[03:16.820 --> 03:22.980]  living in a tent? When she was hooked up to the septic system of the local county, they dumped
[03:22.980 --> 03:27.900]  tons of raw sewerage onto her property. She disconnected that. They tried to clean that up,
[03:27.900 --> 03:33.380]  and she refuses to hook back up to that. She wants to stay on her own septic. She's got a tent now,
[03:33.380 --> 03:38.340]  where they've damaged her property. And they say, no, you can't do that unless you are a licensed
[03:38.340 --> 03:42.460]  campground. That's what they're telling her locally. We're seeing that kind of tyranny everywhere.
[03:42.460 --> 03:46.900]  Look at the mandatory vaccines. That's now taken another step in California. The state bill that's
[03:46.900 --> 03:53.740]  there has passed the Senate. It is moving on to the House. People there need to be awakened. That's
[03:53.740 --> 03:57.700]  not the only state, unfortunately, where this is happening. This is happening everywhere. Changing
[03:57.700 --> 04:04.940]  the term of informed consent, taking away our ability, our rights as human beings to look at
[04:04.940 --> 04:09.020]  what we're being given to have a discussion with our doctor to see what we agree with,
[04:09.020 --> 04:13.020]  what's appropriate for us to make those decisions. No, they change the language. They say it's no
[04:13.020 --> 04:19.220]  longer informed consent. It is a personal belief exemption. It's just what you think. It doesn't
[04:19.220 --> 04:23.740]  really matter. We're the ones who have all knowledge. We'll tell you what's good for you. And you don't
[04:23.740 --> 04:27.380]  have any rights. You just have the exemptions that we give you. We're going to take those away.
[04:27.380 --> 04:31.660]  I think it's interesting to see how they use language. You know, for the longest time,
[04:31.660 --> 04:36.500]  we've seen Democrats talking about being pro-choice when the only choice they wanted to give you
[04:36.500 --> 04:41.380]  was whether or not you were going to abort your child. They certainly are not going to give you
[04:41.380 --> 04:45.980]  a choice about what you put into your child, how you medicate or treat your child. Stay with us
[04:45.980 --> 04:59.060]  right after the break. We've got a special report from Alex Jones. We'll be right back.
[04:59.060 --> 05:04.300]  Regardless of what you think about the Jade Helm operation coming up this summer, the main thing
[05:04.300 --> 05:08.420]  to always remember as an American is to question your government. That is something that you have
[05:08.420 --> 05:14.580]  a right to do. Americans have pretty much lost all faith in government at this point in time. The
[05:14.580 --> 05:19.420]  mainstream media is not doing their job whatsoever. They simply sit at their desk, read their
[05:19.420 --> 05:24.740]  teleprompters, and just spew out whatever words the government or Pentagon has told them to say.
[05:24.740 --> 05:30.100]  The fact that Lieutenant Colonel Mark Lestori and Thomas Meade said that the government sat back
[05:30.100 --> 05:36.340]  while these private landowners were approaching them, asking them to use our land to please come
[05:36.340 --> 05:41.740]  out here to ploy your troops and not take any money whatsoever. And now we know as of yesterday,
[05:41.740 --> 05:47.220]  the mayor of Big City in Texas says that they will be getting compensation, they will be receiving
[05:47.220 --> 05:52.940]  money, and in fact the government came to them. So if you'd like to see more about this, go watch
[05:52.940 --> 06:13.420]  a video called Caught in a Lie. It'll be up at infowars.com. You are listening to an infowars.com
[06:13.420 --> 06:22.220]  frontline report. It's Alex Jones. My friends, my fellow freedom lovers worldwide. We're broadcasting
[06:22.220 --> 06:31.460]  worldwide on this live edition of the Alex Jones show, Sunday, May 17th, 2015. Now there's a lot
[06:31.460 --> 06:34.660]  we're going to be breaking down today, and we're going to cut back in a moment to the studio in
[06:34.660 --> 06:39.220]  David Knight Live, breaking down the latest news and information, and then I'll return tomorrow,
[06:39.220 --> 06:46.980]  11 a.m. to 2 p.m. with a weekday broadcast. But the first thing I want to talk about today is why
[06:46.980 --> 06:53.740]  are the people and why are governors and senators and house members not trusting Obama, Homeland
[06:53.740 --> 06:58.420]  Security and the leadership of the Pentagon, when they promise that there's nothing nefarious with
[06:58.420 --> 07:04.940]  military operations like Jade Helm? It's because we live in a climate where we've been lied to on
[07:04.940 --> 07:11.700]  so many fronts over and over again, and we've seen Washington engaged in dictatorial power grabs
[07:11.700 --> 07:20.260]  at a monumental level across the board, and we see a dinosaur mainstream media that continues to
[07:20.260 --> 07:26.220]  arrogantly say they've never lied, they've never deceived, and they don't work for special interest,
[07:26.220 --> 07:32.380]  and that anyone that questions the official narrative is a tyrant. Now before I get into
[07:32.380 --> 07:38.460]  some of these latest lies, let's just talk about the new Mad Max movie that I've now had a chance
[07:38.460 --> 07:48.780]  to see so we can critique that. It's okay if one movie out of ten has an anti-male, anti-family
[07:48.780 --> 07:59.660]  woman cult worldview. It's that every major movie coming out now and the video game industry and
[07:59.660 --> 08:06.420]  others admit that there is a directive by the suits, by the old men that run it, to make it
[08:06.420 --> 08:13.140]  about a women against men paradigm, and in this movie all the men are genocided by the women,
[08:13.140 --> 08:21.020]  because men are inherently bad and women are inherently good, and it's every new movie that
[08:21.020 --> 08:26.220]  comes out where they advertise it's some movie with a guy, because women and men like to go watch
[08:26.220 --> 08:33.260]  heroes, that's just a fact worldwide, they lie and say it's a movie about guys fighting, and you
[08:33.260 --> 08:38.740]  go see it, and it is a movie about how men are inherently bad. Listen, I'm not an award against
[08:38.740 --> 08:45.820]  women, it's divide and conquer by the globalists, that's simple. They're dividing us along every
[08:45.820 --> 08:53.500]  line and there's so much propaganda, it's come out now last week that the NFL is paid every time
[08:53.500 --> 08:58.060]  they make a touchdown to cut the troops in the audience, to create a Pavlovian event so you
[08:58.060 --> 09:06.660]  associate your team winning or a touchdown with troops, and my point is just be aware of the
[09:06.660 --> 09:12.980]  propaganda, I'm not against women having the rights, I'm not against troops, I am saying be
[09:12.980 --> 09:18.740]  aware of the manipulation, the control that's taking place and realize that in the name of a lot
[09:18.740 --> 09:22.100]  of good things that are pushed, we're being sold a lot of bad things, let's go over here to the
[09:22.100 --> 09:30.860]  computer and let's look at some of these latest news articles on this Sunday edition. Arctic
[09:30.860 --> 09:39.740]  ice shelf could crumble says NASA study, they never even developed new lies, they know the public
[09:39.740 --> 09:44.500]  doesn't know how ice shelves work, how glaciers work north and south, the Arctic, the Antarctic,
[09:44.500 --> 09:51.420]  and when Al Gore got his Nobel Prize in 2007 for his film An Inconvenient Truth, which has been
[09:51.420 --> 09:55.260]  proven to be a total fraud, saying that polar bears can't swim and stuff like that when their
[09:55.260 --> 10:00.460]  numbers are up fivefold since 1955, look it up, just type in polar bear numbers explode worldwide,
[10:00.460 --> 10:10.700]  from Russia to the north of Canada, and he got up there and said that within seven years we're
[10:10.700 --> 10:16.100]  going to see this particular ice cap totally melt, well we're going to show you the satellite
[10:16.100 --> 10:21.740]  shots of the Arctic and Arctic where they've both gotten bigger since 2007 in that speech,
[10:21.740 --> 10:28.660]  the truth is rain and snow fall on them, they build up and then they slough off and flow to the
[10:28.660 --> 10:35.900]  sea, they always have, you can read Roman accounts of being in the north of Europe on the coastlines
[10:35.900 --> 10:41.940]  exploring and seeing mountains collapsing into the ocean, I mean this goes on, polar bears are the
[10:41.940 --> 10:48.980]  greatest land animal swimmer, they don't drown, penguins are not all dying in the south, and I
[10:48.980 --> 10:53.060]  assure you this is what glaciers do, Al Gore has been proven to be wrong, we're going to show you
[10:53.060 --> 10:56.780]  some of the satellite images in a moment from NASA, now NASA has come out, I mean they're
[10:56.780 --> 11:02.020]  political scientists, we don't send humans in space anymore, that's all for robots, so we just get
[11:02.020 --> 11:07.740]  dictated to by NASA, that the ocean is going to rise 11 feet and basically there'll be water in
[11:07.740 --> 11:15.860]  Austin, Texas in most areas, I mean just crazy made up bull, if one piece of the southern Antarctic
[11:15.860 --> 11:21.740]  glacier breaks off, so let's go over some of these articles, this is Al Jazeera, Al Jazeera was here
[11:21.740 --> 11:25.460]  in town interviewing me last week, they looked at me in a straight face and said there is no gun
[11:25.460 --> 11:30.220]  control, there is no move to take guns in America, you're making it up Mr. Jones, the peace airs
[11:30.220 --> 11:34.580]  next week and I said no, there are gun bans in all these cities, the Brady campaign says they
[11:34.580 --> 11:39.420]  want our guns, they go no they don't, just like they're going along with a lie that the Arctic
[11:39.420 --> 11:47.140]  ice shelf could crumble says NASA study and we'll be under you know all this water, myth of
[11:47.140 --> 11:55.380]  Arctic meltdown, stunning satellite images show ice cap is thicker and covers 1.7 million square
[11:55.380 --> 12:01.860]  kilometers, look and it's the same thing for the south, this is the Arctic ice shelf, this is
[12:01.860 --> 12:10.220]  2012 and you can see this is 2014, much bigger with the entire northern passage for ships completely
[12:10.220 --> 12:16.940]  blocked off, I mean that is a fact that he said that by 2013 it would be completely gone and it's
[12:16.940 --> 12:24.900]  now the biggest ever recorded by satellites, here it is, CNN study raises concerns over big
[12:24.900 --> 12:30.340]  rapidly thinning Antarctic ice and they first had this back in March but it was back on TV today
[12:30.340 --> 12:36.460]  so I went and looked it up, okay let's continue, here's Al Gore saying that the experts were saying
[12:36.460 --> 12:49.140]  that it was all going to be melted by 2013, here is that audio and video. The third and the fourth
[12:49.140 --> 12:56.460]  and the consistent conclusion restated with increasing distress is that something basic is
[12:56.460 --> 13:05.300]  wrong, we are what is wrong and we must make it right, last September 21st as the northern
[13:05.300 --> 13:11.300]  hemisphere tilted away from the sun, science is reported with unprecedented alarm that the
[13:11.300 --> 13:18.860]  North Polar ice cap is in their words falling off a cliff, one study estimated that it could
[13:18.860 --> 13:26.140]  be completely gone during summer in less than 22 years, another new study to be presented by
[13:26.140 --> 13:33.820]  U.S. Navy researchers later this week warns it could happen in as little as seven years, seven
[13:33.820 --> 13:40.100]  years from now. There he is, this is the same Nobel committee that gave Henry Kissinger and
[13:40.100 --> 13:44.500]  award, now we're going to go to a break at a moment and come back with David Knight and go to
[13:44.500 --> 13:51.940]  part two of my report here but I'm going to continue the time I have left to break this down,
[13:51.940 --> 13:57.900]  we'll be going about seven minutes here. All right, now continuing, there is Al Gore, now this
[13:57.900 --> 14:03.020]  is the rich eugenicist that gave Henry Kissinger an award for peace when he's a total warmonger,
[14:03.020 --> 14:06.620]  this is a eugenicist that want to be able to organize a global government around taxing
[14:06.620 --> 14:12.900]  all carbon while ignoring all the serious real environmental things that are happening. Okay,
[14:12.900 --> 14:17.940]  let's continue, they're the same ones ramming through what Republicans are pushing with
[14:17.940 --> 14:24.500]  Obama right now, Republicans claim enough votes to pass fast-track trade bill, even though it
[14:24.500 --> 14:31.540]  just failed in the Senate. Now, let's continue, this is the same elite that aren't sending humans
[14:31.540 --> 14:35.780]  into space now that are saying everything we've done by machines in the future, that humans
[14:35.780 --> 14:41.180]  really weren't that good, that they're going to merge with computers, these are human hating
[14:41.180 --> 14:46.620]  scum and then we read about the incredible drought in California and other areas and I've had
[14:46.620 --> 14:53.260]  meteorologists on from California who show the videos and show that the Doppler feed of wet
[14:53.260 --> 14:57.620]  weather systems coming in that would normally rain on the state and the whole West Coast and then
[14:57.620 --> 15:03.340]  these aircraft take off on radar and go and fly in front of it, you can just type in Kim Trails
[15:03.340 --> 15:09.140]  and NASA satellite videos, photos and block the weather systems and I've had Ben Livingston,
[15:09.140 --> 15:13.820]  the father of weather weapons on and it was declassified a decade ago admitting that in the
[15:13.820 --> 15:21.740]  60s they could control and steer and create or kill hurricanes and his job was to dry out the
[15:21.740 --> 15:26.500]  north of Vietnam and starve them but flood the central areas where the war was going on,
[15:26.500 --> 15:32.500]  that's all declassified. Meanwhile, they call me a kook and dangerous in Salon for talking
[15:32.500 --> 15:36.620]  about weather modification, the fact that it's a real science now basically perfected,
[15:36.620 --> 15:43.700]  geoengineering but harp itself is able to ignite the atmosphere, it's so powerful, I've had the
[15:43.700 --> 15:51.620]  director of harp on the broadcast. Now let's just continue here. Alright folks, Alex Jones here on
[15:51.620 --> 15:56.060]  this live Sunday World Wide Edition, we'll be right back with the conclusion of this report and
[15:56.060 --> 16:02.820]  David Knight is riding shotgun. Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio where

[19:58.420 --> 20:04.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:04.820 --> 20:32.580]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight live here in Austin. We're going to be
[20:32.580 --> 20:37.860]  joined by Paul Joseph Watson from the UK. But before we do, here's the rest of Alex Jones's special
[20:37.860 --> 20:44.900]  report. Let's just continue here, breaking all of this down. You have all these huge shadow
[20:44.900 --> 20:51.140]  projects going on that are incredibly classified. But the patents on all of these Eastland systems
[20:51.140 --> 21:00.020]  admit with these Tesla technologies that it can literally turn the atmosphere into a weapon
[21:00.020 --> 21:04.340]  system. And there is the article attacking me amongst other things for saying that there's
[21:04.340 --> 21:10.260]  weather control. All right. Now this, if you're watching us on TV, if you're a radio listener,
[21:10.260 --> 21:19.940]  just search UN treaty on weather weapons 1978 convention on prohibition of military and or
[21:19.940 --> 21:25.620]  hostile use of environmental modification techniques. And it goes through all the signatures,
[21:25.620 --> 21:31.780]  the signatories that go over this. And now that we're back from breaking in, I just want to direct
[21:31.780 --> 21:38.420]  all the TV viewers and all of the radio listeners to go look up the weather weapon convention.
[21:38.420 --> 21:42.820]  You can also look up Secretary of Defense William Cohen, admitting that they have weather weapons,
[21:44.260 --> 21:47.780]  admitting that they had developed those and that other governments had.
[21:48.500 --> 21:52.340]  Because you need to understand, we just don't say, hey, it looks like California is a weather
[21:52.340 --> 21:58.500]  weapon. Dubai, Saudi Arabia and others have already begun greening hundreds of thousands,
[21:58.500 --> 22:05.060]  in some cases millions of acres by putting up towers like harp that actually energize the
[22:05.060 --> 22:10.340]  atmosphere in a way that makes the water, particularly the nuclei come together or it
[22:10.340 --> 22:15.300]  resonates potash and sand and things in the atmosphere to make them resonate where water sticks to it.
[22:16.180 --> 22:20.900]  Okay. You just pray other chemicals that makes water disperse and not form droplets.
[22:20.900 --> 22:25.940]  They're now creating the first domed cities in the Middle East and Dubai and other areas. But
[22:26.980 --> 22:32.500]  here, we're going backwards. And here, people are so ignorant. They don't even know this stuff
[22:32.500 --> 22:38.900]  exists. Here's a headline, Daily Mail. Could clouds be zapped for a laser to stop it raining?
[22:38.900 --> 22:44.100]  Scientists should discuss plans to control the weather. Here's another one. Dubai to build
[22:44.100 --> 22:49.300]  temperature-controlled city, world's largest shopping mall. Again, that's the Weather Channel.
[22:49.300 --> 22:55.780]  Here's another one, the Atlantic, the science behind human-controlled weather. Now, they go on to
[22:55.780 --> 23:00.020]  say, hey, geoengineering could save us from global warming. They're trying to introduce it to the
[23:00.020 --> 23:05.380]  public like it's brand new. And they're like, oh, Bill Gates has a big company that can control
[23:05.380 --> 23:10.660]  hurricanes and can make it snow or make it rain. When there's Department of Energy programs and
[23:10.660 --> 23:16.260]  others that we know exist but that are classified, spending one program $5 billion a year to manipulate
[23:16.260 --> 23:25.620]  the weather. And that's what I'm getting at here today. We're not living in 1942. We're living in
[23:25.620 --> 23:31.380]  2015, and the elites in their own words have compartmentalized incredible technologies
[23:32.500 --> 23:38.180]  and not deployed them to the public. Anything we are given, whether it's a new thermostat or an iPhone,
[23:40.180 --> 23:43.700]  is Trojan Horse designed to track control and run our lives
[23:43.700 --> 23:48.820]  and tax us. All the new cars are coming out to tax you by the mile. Told you that 15 years ago.
[23:48.820 --> 23:54.660]  This is a very predatory system, but they're leaving the bobbles, the entertainment, the trinkets,
[23:54.660 --> 24:02.020]  the ceremonial vestiges of liberty there. So the public is basically playing and having a good time
[24:02.660 --> 24:08.100]  while the globalists have the incredible scientific breakthroughs, build their technological
[24:08.100 --> 24:14.180]  reservations, build their corporate reservations separate from humanity. We have a breakaway
[24:14.180 --> 24:20.740]  civilization taking place. And people need to force a major debate about this, and that's why
[24:20.740 --> 24:24.980]  Jay DeHelm is so exciting, because we can force a debate about militarization of police. We can
[24:24.980 --> 24:30.100]  force a debate about federalization. We can force a debate about Obama acting unilaterally,
[24:30.100 --> 24:36.500]  even outside of executive orders, on the borders, on energy, on guns. And people are getting fed up
[24:36.500 --> 24:40.180]  with the power structure, even though they don't know one-tenth of what's really going on. They
[24:40.180 --> 24:45.060]  understand that things aren't right, and they have a bad feeling. And so the mainstream media,
[24:45.060 --> 24:51.140]  the corporate media, is going to engage in disinformation, damage control, and is going
[24:51.140 --> 24:57.140]  to misrepresent what we say and do, and is going to cherry-pick what we say and do to try to demonize
[24:57.140 --> 25:02.980]  us. Because in FullWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and Jakari Jackson and David Knight and Leigh Ann
[25:02.980 --> 25:09.460]  McAdoo and the rest of the great crew, are simply saying what the public's already thinking
[25:09.460 --> 25:13.460]  and pointing it out. We're not even connecting with dots now. We are simply
[25:15.140 --> 25:22.260]  breaking down the fact that there are control freaks and social engineers that really enjoy
[25:22.260 --> 25:27.540]  manipulating our civilization and our future. And it's a very anti-human future and civilization
[25:27.540 --> 25:33.140]  that's being built. Now I'm going to throw it back live here on the Sunday broadcast, 4 to 6 p.m.
[25:33.700 --> 25:38.580]  I did the Sunday show last week. I am only doing part of it here today. I've got some family in
[25:38.580 --> 25:43.060]  town, and I'll be back. Lord willing, tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central with a weekday transmission. But
[25:43.060 --> 25:48.500]  David Knight's got a bunch of news on the TPP, all these globalist treaties, the latest on them
[25:48.500 --> 25:52.420]  trying to start race riots in Cleveland. We're probably going to be sending our reporters there,
[25:52.420 --> 25:58.340]  and so much more. But whatever you do, don't take independent media. For granted, spread the word
[25:58.340 --> 26:04.020]  about infowars.com. Start your own small media operation. It will grow. Whatever you do, speak
[26:04.020 --> 26:09.860]  up, be heard, vote with your dollars, support transparency and freedom, and realize that the
[26:09.860 --> 26:14.820]  corporate media has gone completely rogue with the rogue government. They know they've committed
[26:14.820 --> 26:19.140]  crimes and they're going for broke. They are cornered. They are very, very dangerous. And
[26:19.140 --> 26:23.380]  they want to keep you ignorant about science, about weather modification, about social engineering,
[26:24.340 --> 26:29.780]  about social Darwinism, about how they're using anthropology to control us. They want to keep
[26:29.780 --> 26:34.100]  you ignorant about militarization of police or the army's admission that they're being given the
[26:34.100 --> 26:39.300]  mission to take on the American people. That's why the public's concerned, because a minority of the
[26:39.300 --> 26:44.100]  public of every race, color, and creed is aware of what's happening and is concerned. And no
[26:44.100 --> 26:50.100]  amount of demonization is going to ever shut that down. You may have 50% of people that'll be happy
[26:50.100 --> 26:54.980]  to be slaves, but a large portion of the other 50 will not comply and go along with it. And that's
[26:54.980 --> 26:59.860]  why the power structure has become so arrogant. They think they're invincible, but they're starting
[26:59.860 --> 27:03.700]  to find out that that's not the case. All right. Well, I'm going to go ahead and throw back to
[27:03.700 --> 27:09.060]  David Knight here today on the Sunday broadcast. I want to thank you all for your support. InfoWars
[27:09.060 --> 27:14.900]  is under unprecedented attack right now by the establishment media because what we're saying
[27:14.900 --> 27:19.780]  is so on target. And we couldn't be getting this word out or funding this operation without your
[27:19.780 --> 27:24.820]  help. So I want to thank you all today for what you've done. I want to in closing encourage all

[28:31.380 --> 28:37.460]  take you to the infowars.com news center and David Knight live. Stay with us when we come back.
[28:37.460 --> 28:42.980]  We're going to be talking about the upcoming week. We have a big week. We're standing on the cusp of
[28:42.980 --> 28:48.500]  tyranny, a secret trade agreement. We have Canadian laws that are being changed retroactively,
[28:48.500 --> 28:52.260]  as well as a massive new law in the UK. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[28:52.260 --> 29:05.460]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key
[29:05.460 --> 29:11.140]  concepts of super oxygenation. The next level in cleansing is here with key ingredients backed by
[29:11.140 --> 29:16.420]  real clinical studies. The new oxy powder available through info wars life was invented during
[29:16.420 --> 29:21.940]  doctor group's research on the toxification of our bodies. Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the
[29:21.940 --> 29:27.700]  body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers,
[29:27.700 --> 29:33.460]  GMOs, additives or worse. Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working
[29:33.460 --> 29:38.340]  while you sleep. Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste
[29:38.340 --> 29:44.100]  and concoctions. Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal
[29:44.100 --> 29:50.420]  tract and body. Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[30:49.140 --> 30:53.860]  the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue. Now available in our limited first run at info wars

[31:09.220 --> 31:15.300]  and that's what you'll find at info wars life.com. We have rejected literally hundreds of products
[31:15.300 --> 31:20.660]  from the info wars life line because they are not of the very highest quality or because they're not
[31:20.660 --> 31:26.580]  100% organic or because they don't ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we
[31:26.580 --> 31:33.060]  have listed at info wars life.com whether it's survival shield nascent iodine or dna force, super
[31:33.060 --> 31:40.260]  male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder. I believe that all
[31:40.260 --> 31:45.620]  of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have
[31:45.620 --> 31:52.020]  visited info wars life.com and believed in us and tried the products. Folks check out info wars life.com

[31:59.780 --> 32:05.380]  candy. I love everything again. Fly my life. And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do
[32:05.380 --> 32:10.900]  the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help
[32:10.900 --> 32:16.500]  children focus. All of our children are hit with modern mind control. Television, music, fast food,
[32:16.500 --> 32:21.860]  GMOs, sugars you name it. Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being
[32:21.860 --> 32:27.620]  hammered daily by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then
[32:27.620 --> 32:32.660]  are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs. Working with my team we set out to find the best formula
[32:32.660 --> 32:36.900]  with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take. We worked with the
[32:36.900 --> 32:41.140]  leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most
[32:41.140 --> 32:46.740]  affordable and powerful calming formula out there. Introducing child ease with herbs and calming

[32:58.660 --> 33:14.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:14.580 --> 33:36.100]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight in Austin. We're going to be joined in
[33:36.100 --> 33:41.140]  the next hour by Paul Joseph Watson from the UK. Of course there's been some big news in the UK.
[33:41.140 --> 33:48.180]  There's big news all over the globe. We see tyranny right on the cusp of shutting down freedoms that
[33:48.180 --> 33:54.340]  we have enjoyed for centuries, especially in the UK. Let's take a look at this new counter
[33:54.340 --> 33:59.140]  terrorism act that's been announced by David Cameron and the conservatives right after being
[33:59.140 --> 34:05.940]  reelected. Michael Krieger of Liberty Blitzkrieg points out it's not just those domestic extremists
[34:05.940 --> 34:12.500]  and crazy conspiracy theory kooks who took serious issue with UK Prime Minister David Cameron's recent
[34:12.500 --> 34:19.780]  overtly fascist language. Well, let's talk about this. Would you have thought that was hyperbole
[34:19.780 --> 34:25.940]  or exaggeration for somebody to say this? We've been telling you this is going to be happening
[34:25.940 --> 34:30.260]  for quite some time here at info wars. Alex Jones has been talking about this, documenting the plans
[34:30.260 --> 34:35.860]  to do this for a very long time. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see that this was
[34:35.860 --> 34:41.140]  in the cards. You can see that this was coming. They're incrementally moving towards this. Now
[34:41.140 --> 34:46.580]  listen to what he had to say in introducing this new bill. David Cameron, Prime Minister of the UK
[34:46.580 --> 34:52.500]  said, for far too long, we have been a passively tolerant society saying to our citizens,
[34:52.500 --> 34:59.540]  as long as you obey the law, we will leave you alone. So now the presumption is that they're not
[34:59.540 --> 35:04.900]  going to leave you alone if you obey the law. That has always been the contract. Max Kaiser
[35:04.900 --> 35:10.420]  did a video about it talking about the 26 scariest words kind of referring to Reagan's
[35:10.420 --> 35:14.180]  nine scariest words in the English language where he said, I'm from the government and I'm here to
[35:14.180 --> 35:20.340]  help you. Now we have David Cameron saying, we've been tolerant of people in our society saying,
[35:20.340 --> 35:24.660]  we'll leave you alone if you obey the law, but that's not going to happen anymore. And so people
[35:24.660 --> 35:28.980]  are asking, well, what are they really planning on doing? Well, here's what the Guardian reports.
[35:28.980 --> 35:33.380]  The Guardian says, the measures would give the police powers to apply to the high court for an
[35:33.380 --> 35:39.620]  order to limit the harmful activities, quote unquote, of an extremist individual. The definition
[35:39.620 --> 35:46.660]  of harmful would include a risk of public disorder, a risk of harassment, alarm or distress, or creating
[35:46.660 --> 35:54.180]  a quote threat to the functioning of democracy. How's that for broad? See, what they're doing is
[35:54.180 --> 35:59.860]  they accuse anyone who questions the official government story, anyone who questions the
[35:59.860 --> 36:05.380]  contradicting, obviously, false stories that come from the authorities. If you take exception to that,
[36:05.380 --> 36:10.340]  you're labeled a conspiracy theorist. People will say, you're trying to scare the public.
[36:11.140 --> 36:18.820]  No, the means of taking down our centuries of common law, respect for the rights of the individual,
[36:18.820 --> 36:24.260]  innocent until proven guilty, the contract that if you obey the law, you'll be left alone,
[36:24.260 --> 36:29.380]  and the idea that we should have some input as to what those laws are. All of that is being taken
[36:29.380 --> 36:36.660]  away by conspiracy because they're working together on this, and quite frankly, under our
[36:36.660 --> 36:41.460]  charters that are centuries old, whether it's the Magna Carta or where it's the Constitution,
[36:41.460 --> 36:48.260]  they're working together to do something that is prohibited by those charters. That is the legal
[36:48.260 --> 36:54.980]  definition of a conspiracy. It's not a theory. And they are the ones who are using fear to destroy
[36:54.980 --> 37:00.500]  the foundations of Western society using also political correctness. Now listen to what else
[37:00.500 --> 37:05.540]  they said. They would also include a ban on broadcasting and a requirement to submit to
[37:05.540 --> 37:12.580]  the police in advance any proposed publication on the web and social media or in print. There goes
[37:12.580 --> 37:19.700]  free speech because you might scare somebody, you might offend somebody, you might concern people,
[37:19.700 --> 37:26.020]  you might say something that would harm democracy, quote unquote, not mentioning the fact that taking
[37:26.020 --> 37:34.660]  away our free speech harms democracy. So you would have to get prior permission to broadcast to
[37:34.660 --> 37:38.500]  say anything if it's at all controversial. Now the person who's putting this through is Teresa May,
[37:39.380 --> 37:45.140]  they comment and say essentially she's saying nonviolent groups that are currently not breaking
[37:45.140 --> 37:52.260]  any laws should be criminalized by creating new laws. Bring me the man, I'll find the crime. You
[37:52.260 --> 37:57.220]  understand how that's working? Now, another comment on this, what they're pointing out
[37:57.860 --> 38:02.020]  is that this is a comment from the Islamic Human Rights Council because of course it'll be
[38:02.020 --> 38:09.060]  probably directed at them at first. Remember what Pastor Martin Neimler said about Nazi Germany.
[38:09.060 --> 38:12.260]  First they came for this group, then they came for that group, then they came for me and there
[38:12.260 --> 38:19.300]  was no one left to help me because they had taken everybody else away. We have to stand up for freedom
[38:19.300 --> 38:23.940]  of speech. So this is what they had to say. They said the Counterterrorism and Security Act
[38:23.940 --> 38:29.700]  moved us one step closer to a police state. The current set of proposals is the Orwellian
[38:29.700 --> 38:34.260]  nightmare with all the trappings from vague concepts such as British values that the government
[38:34.260 --> 38:41.220]  manipulates to persecute its opponents to using thought crime to silence them. Precisely because
[38:41.220 --> 38:47.060]  this is all about pre-crime. This is what we're seeing in America as well. This is a very troubling,
[38:47.060 --> 38:52.900]  this is the most troubling aspect of Jade Helm that I personally see. The idea that human domain
[38:52.900 --> 38:57.860]  analytics, that activity-based intelligence, these ideas that have been percolating in Washington
[38:57.860 --> 39:03.460]  and the intelligence community, the military community, homeland security, domestic law enforcement,
[39:04.020 --> 39:10.740]  this is what they're using the NSA for. They're using it as a broad surveillance of the public to
[39:10.740 --> 39:17.620]  see what pops out so they can then focus on the people that they might be political enemies,
[39:17.620 --> 39:21.060]  maybe their political dissonance. This is something that has gone on for a very long time.
[39:22.500 --> 39:26.260]  Many people, I would say not all of us, but most people are familiar with the Church Committee
[39:26.260 --> 39:33.060]  hearings about the CIA. Those were the hearings where you had Richard Helms and others talking
[39:33.060 --> 39:40.420]  about the CIA's assassination programs, attempts to take out Fidel Castro showing a particular type
[39:40.420 --> 39:44.180]  of guns that people had never seen before, that were going to be used for assassination. That was
[39:44.180 --> 39:50.580]  all very sensational. You may not realize that there was another hearing that was going on in
[39:50.580 --> 39:56.740]  the House. It was called the Pike Committee. And the Pike Committee looked into the NSA,
[39:56.740 --> 40:04.180]  not just the CIA. It was a far more insightful investigation, quite frankly. At that point,
[40:04.180 --> 40:11.300]  nobody really knew that the NSA exists. For the longest time, they said it stood for no such
[40:11.300 --> 40:14.980]  agency. So they didn't even know that it existed at that point in time. They certainly didn't know
[40:14.980 --> 40:21.940]  where it came from. Now, the head of that committee was successful in getting the NSA
[40:21.940 --> 40:26.100]  to testify before his committee. And one of the reasons, listen to this, one of the reasons he was
[40:26.100 --> 40:32.180]  able to get him in was because as part of the testimony of the CIA, they pointed out that
[40:32.180 --> 40:39.860]  they as well as the NSA, no such agency, were collecting massive phone surveillance,
[40:40.580 --> 40:47.620]  massive data from people collecting their mail, their phone conversations using AT&T,
[40:47.620 --> 40:52.180]  using Western Union, using the post office. They were spying on people. It was a very,
[40:52.180 --> 40:56.420]  very primitive operation, especially compared to what they can do today. This was in the 1970s.
[40:56.420 --> 41:03.460]  So he was able to get the NSA head to come in for the very first time to even talk about an agency
[41:03.460 --> 41:09.300]  that nobody even knew existed at that point. And he wanted to know where their charter came from,
[41:09.300 --> 41:13.060]  because they'd been talking about the CIA violating its charter about spying on people
[41:13.060 --> 41:19.380]  domestically. And he said, where did you get your authorization? Can we see the authorization for it?
[41:19.380 --> 41:22.500]  He says, well, certainly, you can go down and you can look at the charter at a government
[41:22.500 --> 41:29.380]  location outside of Congress. You can't put this on the Senate record. Does that sound familiar?
[41:29.380 --> 41:33.940]  Does that sound like our Trans-Pacific Partnership that's coming up for authorization this week?
[41:34.660 --> 41:42.020]  You're not going to be able to, we can't see how this massive trade treaty, which goes far beyond
[41:42.020 --> 41:47.140]  just trade. It affects copyright. It affects pharmaceuticals. It affects so many different
[41:47.140 --> 41:52.660]  aspects of our lives. It affects our very sovereignty. It elevates corporations to the level of
[41:52.660 --> 41:58.500]  governments. And it's all being done in secret. Well, that's how the NSA was created as well.
[41:59.060 --> 42:03.540]  It turns out they didn't have a charter. It turns out they were created by executive order,
[42:03.540 --> 42:08.500]  a series of executive orders by President Truman. You see all this stuff that Obama is doing,
[42:08.500 --> 42:12.500]  it's accelerated. Certainly, everything is accelerating. Everything is getting worse.
[42:12.500 --> 42:18.500]  But it is an incremental tyranny. They've been creating the legal infrastructure for this for
[42:18.500 --> 42:24.740]  very long time. And it is accelerating. And it is getting much broader in its scope.
[42:24.740 --> 42:28.340]  I want to just read you a little bit of the back and forth between the head of the NSA
[42:28.900 --> 42:34.260]  and Congressman Pike, who had the committee. Congressman Pike was very upset. He said,
[42:34.260 --> 42:38.100]  you're talking about a document sets up the entire NSA. It's one which all members of Congress
[42:38.100 --> 42:43.700]  are entitled to seeing. Which he said, no, it's got secret material in it. And he says,
[42:43.700 --> 42:46.980]  it seems incredible to me, frankly, we're asked to appropriate large amounts of money
[42:46.980 --> 42:51.700]  for a paper that we can't see how that agency is authorized. And yet, that's what's going to
[42:51.700 --> 42:56.740]  happen this week with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We can see how it worked out for us with the NSA.
[42:56.740 --> 43:09.380]  Stay with us. We'll be right back with more news.
[43:26.740 --> 43:29.380]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9

[46:57.780 --> 47:04.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:09.620 --> 47:16.900]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the
[47:16.900 --> 47:24.660]  problem. From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex
[47:24.660 --> 47:31.860]  to be managed by self-rule. That government by an elite group is superior to government for,
[47:32.660 --> 47:41.060]  by, and of the people. The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[47:42.500 --> 47:49.220]  Fellow me, meet the real me and my misfits waive life. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm
[47:49.220 --> 47:54.500]  David Knight, your host here live in Austin on this Sunday, May 17th, 2015. We're going to
[47:54.500 --> 48:00.100]  be joining Paul Joseph Watson in the next hour from the UK. He's going to break down some of the
[48:00.100 --> 48:04.660]  news there and I was just talking about the massive counterterrorism bill that has come out
[48:05.300 --> 48:10.980]  in the UK. Very frightening the way this is worded saying basically for far too long,
[48:10.980 --> 48:16.100]  we've been very tolerant of people who just obey the law. We've left them alone that those days are
[48:16.100 --> 48:22.180]  going to end because they're going to be fine tuning everything that you do. They're going to be
[48:22.180 --> 48:29.060]  looking at everything you do, analyzing everything you do and mapping it out. That's what the thrust
[48:29.060 --> 48:34.660]  of the NSA has been for a very long time. Going back to 2001, remember James Clapper,
[48:34.660 --> 48:40.260]  the guy who was asked by Ron Wyden directly, are you doing dragnet surveillance and violation
[48:40.260 --> 48:43.140]  of the Constitution and violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
[48:43.700 --> 48:48.100]  on the American public? Are you doing dragnet surveillance? Well, no, we're not really doing
[48:48.100 --> 48:55.860]  that. Now, go back to 2001. September 2001, actually, that date may sound familiar to you,
[48:55.860 --> 49:03.300]  9-11. James Clapper's first directorship was director of geospatial intelligence.
[49:04.260 --> 49:10.340]  Their directive was to map the human domain into the geographical domain, to look to see
[49:10.340 --> 49:16.580]  what people were doing, what they thought, who you are, who you know, what you do and put it in a
[49:16.580 --> 49:22.580]  political religious context, a cultural context. Going from nations, they said they've been looking
[49:22.580 --> 49:27.140]  at different nations down to different regions and now they wanted to take it down to the individual
[49:27.140 --> 49:31.780]  because technology allowed them to do that. And so that's what we have when we look at the
[49:31.780 --> 49:36.420]  Jade Helm logo, mastering the human domain. You need to understand what human domain analytics
[49:36.420 --> 49:42.980]  are set up for. This is really boots on the ground for the NSA. There's no other way to describe it.
[49:42.980 --> 49:48.980]  And of course, it was McRaven himself, the former head of Special Forces that told, sold
[49:48.980 --> 49:54.980]  the Special Forces two years ago in 2013. He was talking about how they had to reinvent Special
[49:54.980 --> 50:01.140]  Forces. People thought of them too much as kinetic operations, as jumping out of planes or fighting
[50:01.140 --> 50:06.340]  on the ground. They wanted to get back to their roots, back to psychological operations, to
[50:06.340 --> 50:11.220]  manipulating people, to ferreting out people. That might be a threat to their regime, to their plans
[50:11.220 --> 50:17.940]  and shutting them down beforehand. Matches perfectly with what our surveillance state is doing all
[50:17.940 --> 50:22.900]  over the world. Look at this story from Canada. The Harper government is retroactively rewriting
[50:22.900 --> 50:27.780]  their gun registry law. Well, actually, the gun registry law has been changed and some people
[50:27.780 --> 50:32.020]  wanted to get access to information about it. Very much like the FOIA request that we have here in
[50:32.020 --> 50:38.660]  America. There was a concern that if they were allowed to look at this, it might expose criminal
[50:38.660 --> 50:45.220]  charges against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. So what did they do? They quietly
[50:45.220 --> 50:51.540]  changed the law. They quietly made it illegal to look at any of those memos. So much for freedom
[50:51.540 --> 50:57.060]  of information. That's Canada. And of course, in Britain, they're talking about the name of
[50:57.060 --> 51:04.420]  protecting the democracy there. Having prior consent for anything that people are going to
[51:04.420 --> 51:10.660]  publish or to write about. And elevating political correctness and thought crimes to
[51:12.100 --> 51:16.340]  a level that we have never before seen. We've all can see this coming, but it's where it's
[51:16.340 --> 51:21.460]  coming. Now, of course, this next week, we're also going to have the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[51:21.460 --> 51:30.180]  being brought up for a vote. There was a attempt to do a, to stall it by the Democrats. They shut
[51:30.180 --> 51:37.060]  that down. They went to cloture. They're not going to have anything beyond voting this week.
[51:37.060 --> 51:42.020]  They will vote for whether or not they're going to take the recommendations, this treaty that has
[51:42.020 --> 51:47.860]  been negotiated in secret for years by corporate lobbyists. They're going to put that before the
[51:47.860 --> 51:52.420]  Congress. And they say they're going to give us two weeks to look at it. Now, you need to understand
[51:52.420 --> 51:58.180]  that this is a vast new treaty, this trade agreement. And it is about many things other than the trade.
[51:58.180 --> 52:02.900]  And it is not about free trade anymore than the bailout of the big banks that collapse
[52:02.900 --> 52:08.180]  real estate markets was about free markets. No, this is crony capitalism writ large.
[52:08.740 --> 52:14.660]  This is legislation that has been created by these corporations. And this is something that
[52:14.660 --> 52:20.260]  after they show this to the Congress for two weeks, it'll be a straight up or down vote.
[52:20.260 --> 52:26.340]  There'll be no amendments, no changes allowed. But as Senator Sessions, one of the very few people
[52:26.340 --> 52:31.300]  who has gone to look at it because they've kept this secret, you can go in, you can read it,
[52:31.300 --> 52:35.140]  but you can't talk about it. You can take notes, but you can't take those notes with you.
[52:35.140 --> 52:40.020]  But Senator Sessions went in and talked about it in a general way. And he said,
[52:40.020 --> 52:45.460]  it is a living document. Once this thing is passed, they'll be able to add new nations in.
[52:45.460 --> 52:49.620]  They will be able to change every aspect of the treaty. So if this treaty doesn't have anything
[52:49.620 --> 52:55.540]  in there about gun control, they can easily put this in without any further input from
[52:55.540 --> 53:01.860]  our legislature, from the Congress, from the Senate. So understand, there's not going to be any
[53:01.860 --> 53:05.780]  amendments in the two week period that they have to take a look at this. But after that,
[53:05.780 --> 53:11.540]  it can be freely changed by these corporate lobbyists. And so John Rappaport asks, he says,
[53:11.540 --> 53:17.300]  what law says that the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP, must remain secret?
[53:18.420 --> 53:22.340]  Congress has to stay silent? Under what authority? Is there a law in the U.S. for
[53:22.340 --> 53:27.460]  bending disclosure? Name that law. Can you recall anything in the Constitution that
[53:27.460 --> 53:33.700]  establishes secret treaties? I can't. Is there any prior treaty that states the text of all
[53:33.700 --> 53:40.020]  treaties can be hidden from the people? No. I can see no authority anywhere that justifies
[53:40.020 --> 53:45.860]  withholding the text of the TPP. Now, like I said, this is about far more than free trade.
[53:45.860 --> 53:51.300]  Many countries have pushed back against big pharma. Many of them don't have the kind of
[53:51.300 --> 53:55.780]  copyright protections that we have in this country, or they don't have their drugs copyrighted for
[53:55.780 --> 54:02.580]  as long a period of time. I want to play for you a clip from a Danish doctor comparing big pharma
[54:02.580 --> 54:08.340]  to organized crime. Here's that clip. My name is Peter Goetje. I'm a director of the Nordic
[54:08.340 --> 54:14.340]  Cochran Center in Copenhagen, and professor of research, design, and analysis at the University
[54:14.340 --> 54:20.340]  of Copenhagen. Two years ago, I found out that our prescription drugs are the third leading
[54:20.340 --> 54:28.660]  course of death after heart disease and cancer. Our drugs kill around 200,000 people in America
[54:28.660 --> 54:37.460]  every year, and half of these people die while they do what their doctors told them. So they die
[54:37.460 --> 54:44.340]  because of the side effects. The other half die because of errors, and it's often the doctors that
[54:44.340 --> 54:51.540]  make the errors because any drug may come with 20, 30, or 40 warnings, contraindications, precautions,
[54:51.540 --> 55:00.100]  and so on. No doctor in the world knows about all this. So they give patients drugs that they
[55:00.100 --> 55:06.100]  should not have given them that interact dangerously with other drugs or food items or so on, and
[55:06.100 --> 55:13.540]  then the patients die. That's the other half. So the other thing I found out two years ago was that
[55:14.980 --> 55:21.220]  much of what the drug industry does fulfills the criteria for organized crime in U.S. law,
[55:22.100 --> 55:28.340]  and they behave in many ways like the mafia does. They corrupt everyone they can corrupt.
[55:28.340 --> 55:34.420]  They have bought every type of person, even including ministers of health in some countries.
[55:34.420 --> 55:41.860]  So there is a huge amount of corruption. In my country, for example, Denmark, we are regarded
[55:41.860 --> 55:49.060]  as having very little corruption, but yet we have thousands of doctors on industry payroll,
[55:49.060 --> 55:56.260]  although we are just 20,000 doctors. So this is an effective kind of corruption. The drug industry
[55:56.260 --> 56:02.500]  buys the professors first, then chiefs of department, then other chief physicians, and so on. They don't
[56:02.500 --> 56:09.220]  buy junior doctors. So when several thousands are on industry payroll, it's really, really bad.
[56:09.940 --> 56:17.060]  And that's why I wrote my book, Deadly Medicines and Organized Crime, How Big Pharma Has Corrupted
[56:17.060 --> 56:24.260]  Healthcare. I hope to convince patients not to take so many drugs because so many die
[56:24.820 --> 56:30.820]  from the drugs they take. Absolutely. And yet we have legislation across the country
[56:30.820 --> 56:36.980]  that will hold a gun to our head and force us to take vaccines that the big pharmaceutical
[56:36.980 --> 56:41.860]  companies have already negotiated that they have no liability. If you haven't heard of the vaccine
[56:41.860 --> 56:45.700]  court, you need to look that up. They have no liability yet they can force us to take their
[56:45.700 --> 56:50.580]  product and they can withhold from us things that we want to take that are good for us.
[56:51.220 --> 56:56.020]  Now, if you want to take control of your health, one thing you can do to support our operation
[56:56.020 --> 57:01.540]  as well as support your health is take some of the safe and effective natural ingredients that

[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.100]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here in Austin. We're going to be joining
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:25.700]  Paul Joseph Watson from the UK in the next segment. When he comes on, I want to talk to him about
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:31.380]  this new counterterrorism bill as well as we're going to talk about banning of cash.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:38.260]  As Prime Minister David Cameron in the UK just recently said, for far too long, we've been
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:42.580]  passively tolerant saying to our citizens, as long as you obey the law, we'll leave you alone.
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.700]  We're not going to do that anymore. One of the things that they're not going to leave you alone
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:51.540]  about is just having cash. They're going to set it up so they can take your cash. This is something
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:57.460]  we see one economist after the other calling for. We've got a couple of articles up on InfoWars.com,
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:02.180]  leading German Keynesian economists calls for a cash ban. Of course, we also had the chief economist
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:08.260]  for Citibank calling for the same thing. Watson is also going to talk about an economist form
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:13.380]  from the UK saying we need to ban cash and force everyone to have government-controlled bank accounts.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:20.900]  See, this is the end game. Keynesianism has essentially been an argument that if you borrow
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:24.340]  money, it doesn't really matter because you're just borrowing it from yourself. I remember when I
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:29.220]  took economics in college, we had microeconomics and we had macroeconomics. Microeconomics were
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:34.180]  the things that you did to balance your own personal checkbook or to balance the checkbook
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:38.500]  of your company, let's say. But of course, they said when you got to the national level,
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:44.340]  none of these things mattered. Somehow, they waived a magic Keynesian one over it, called it
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:50.260]  macroeconomics and said, you know, the laws of the real world don't apply here. You can just borrow
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:55.380]  and print money endlessly. And of course, that was a lie. Most people knew it was a lie. Certainly,
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:59.300]  the Austrian economists pointed out it was a lie. Many others, there were a lot of different
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:05.380]  economics schools that pointed out these guys were nothing but court gestures for an omnipotent
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:12.100]  state that could print money and buy people out until they get to the point where we are today.
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:16.660]  They've already taken it down to zero interest rates. They can't control that anymore. They
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:21.140]  say they've got to go into negative interest rates to try to force people to spend the money they
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:28.740]  get. But it has also brought an unforeseen, for most people, circumstance out of this. And that
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:33.380]  is the massive consolidation of wealth into the hands of a few. That's what this has always been
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:39.540]  about. It's always been about essentially putting us on an interest-only loan to the Federal Reserve.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:44.420]  That's the scheme. And now we see that this, as we've got the consolidation of wealth in the
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:49.620]  hands of a few, as it is being consolidated into the hands of foreign countries, they are starting
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:55.860]  to take control of these assets. One of those assets is going to be cash. But they also want to be
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:01.540]  able to follow everything you do. That's what's behind the new laws in the UK. And of course,
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:07.060]  we also just mentioned in the last segment about how the Canadian government is now retroactively
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:12.020]  written some laws that would essentially open up the freedom of information, access to the
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:16.180]  Information Act. That's what we call the FOIA Request of Freedom of Information Act here in
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:22.340]  America. They're going to shut that down to cover up the criminal actions of the Royal Canadian
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:28.260]  Mounted Police, an unprecedented movement there. And of course, we need to understand that
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:35.620]  we have to always watch the police. That's why we need transparency. Because when they're not
[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:41.940]  watched, we get things like this. In Chicago, remember that black site, that black torture site,
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:48.900]  home and square? Jakarii Jackson and Joe Biggs went to cover it a few months ago because there
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:53.700]  were allegations from many people that they had been tortured. We have another one here,
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:58.980]  Chicago man. This is on info wars.com. Chicago man says, cops brought me to a secret prison,
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:06.500]  anally raped me to force me to become an informant. Subtitle their sadistic Chicago cops
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:12.260]  reportedly torture an innocent man. There's a video that's been obtained by the Guardian,
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:17.620]  and they say it shows him agreeing to meet them at a particular location, Al's beef.
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:21.860]  Camera footage shows him walking over to their car with his hand extended for a handshake,
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:27.620]  unarmed, unassuming. They turn him around, push him against the car, cuff him, take him to home
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:33.460]  and square where he alleges they sexually assaulted him. It says that what he says is they took
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:40.180]  their gun, they jammed it into his anus. He said, I started jerking, going crazy, going into full
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:44.580]  blown panic mode. What did they want? They wanted him to be an informant. They wanted him to do
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:51.860]  $170 deal for heroin, and they would do that to an innocent man. That's why we need to watch
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:56.260]  this secretive government that wants to know everything about us, won't tell us anything
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:03.060]  about this. We'll be right back. Introducing secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife Vitamin B12
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:09.860]  formulation. Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12,
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:15.300]  methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin. Secret 12
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:20.260]  is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed. No needles, no injections.

[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:32.580]  It's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight on this Sunday,
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:38.660]  May 17th, 2015. We're joined right now by Paul Joseph Watson from the UK. Of course,
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:42.820]  you're familiar with his work. If you've seen infowars.com, we're going to talk to him about
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:48.660]  not only the war on cash, but we're going to talk to him first about an article from TPM.
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:55.060]  Five video conspiracies, five videos that conspiracy theorists say are proof of a coming
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:07:02.820]  military takeover, again, spinning things in a very strawman sort of way. But before we do,
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:06.660]  before we go to Paul, just want to read you this article that just came out today.
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:11.700]  Russia and China are starting joint drills in the Mediterranean. Now they say this isn't
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:15.700]  aimed at any third country. There's no mean, you know, they're not trying to offend anybody,
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:21.460]  they're not targeting anybody and see cooperation 2015. They're just military exercises. You know,
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:30.180]  they're not provocative. Look, you train where you fight. We've got our government training all over
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:36.020]  Europe and areas that are close to the Russians and they are coming back and training in the
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:42.100]  Mediterranean. It's about intimidating people. It's about watching their reaction to that intimidation.
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:47.700]  That's what these American exercises being done in American cities are about as well. They say,
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.700]  the war games aren't aimed against any third country. They aren't linked to any political
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:57.140]  situation in the region. Really? I mean, when you look at that, if you find that to be provocative,
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:03.540]  that the Russians are doing drills against NATO with China in the Mediterranean, you got to ask
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:10.100]  yourself then, why do we have our American military doing drills all over the country? And of course,
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:15.780]  that's what this article is about, Paul. Let's talk about what they're saying here. This is
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:23.540]  Heysa Garcia with TPM Muckraker. Yeah, this is an article entitled Five Videos Conspiracy Theorist
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:29.380]  Sale, Proof of a Coming Military Takeover, which of course, we've never said that. The top video
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:34.980]  they featured is the one that we posted on InfoWalls, I believe on Thursday morning, which is out of
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:42.180]  Yuma, Arizona, where the US Marines are practicing subduing Americans inside this Muck internment
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:48.580]  facility. They're chasing them around at gunpoint, arresting them. And this TPM article, which is
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:53.700]  typical of the mischaracterizations that we've seen over the past few weeks, amidst this deluge
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:09:02.580]  of hit pieces, says that this video was described by the conspiracy website InfoWalls as alarming
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:08.180]  alarming evidence of the impending military takeover. If you actually read the article that I
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:14.420]  wrote, the words military takeover appear nowhere in that article, I said it was alarming because
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:20.180]  of the content of the actual video, which is Marines armed Marines chasing around these
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.740]  American roleplayers and arresting them at gunpoint inside a Muck internment facility.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:30.260]  That's why it was alarming. I said nothing about a military takeover. And then they go on to say,
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:36.180]  InfoWalls said, quote, US Army manuals have made it clear such operations also apply to the continental
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:42.100]  United States and will be used against American citizens during a national emergency. They go
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:48.420]  on to say that's a conspiracy theory. Despite the fact that we've had the civil operations manual,
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:53.860]  we've discussed it, highlighted it, documented it, learned the fact that it applies domestically,
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:10:01.940]  you know, talking about rioters within America being put into internment camps again on domestic
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:08.900]  soil, taking on dissidents with lethal force. That's what's in these documents. But notice TPM,
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:15.860]  they excise the link, even though they quote us directly, they excise the link from that quote
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:22.180]  to the actual military document. And then they go on to say it's a conspiracy theory. So these
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:29.060]  are the tricks and tactics they use to mischaracterize everything that we've said and delegitimize the
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:35.060]  fact that much of this has been admitted by the US military itself within its own document.
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:38.660]  Yeah, we've seen the training scenarios. And of course, from the very beginning,
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:44.980]  Alex Jones was saying this is part of getting us accustomed to seeing the military and civilian
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:51.140]  areas and also getting the military accustomed to operating in civilian areas, training and
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:55.620]  operating in those areas. And also to take a look at how people are going to respond to this.
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:11:00.500]  I mean, that's one of the reasons that they do these kinds of exercises in the Mediterranean,
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:06.340]  one country against another. But it's a straw man to say that we're saying this is going to be a
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:09.940]  martial law takedown. That's what you can see. Every one of these articles will come out with
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:16.340]  that straw man argument, which we have specifically said we do not believe. And then repeat endlessly
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:21.940]  the mantra conspiracy theory, conspiracy theory. Yeah. And then, you know, when by the end of
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:26.660]  September, when they don't announce martial law, they'll all come out again and say, oh, look how
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:33.300]  ridiculous these paranoid conspiracy theorists were. I think the US military is actually benefiting
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:39.220]  from this, if not promoting the idea that this is all about domestic martial law takeover.
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:45.380]  Because I made the video where if you slightly rotate the Jade Hell match, the map, sorry,
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:52.980]  the hostile states of Utah and Texas closely approximate Iran and Syria. So I think this is
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:58.740]  definitely all these things are dual purpose, but this is more geared towards foreign military
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:04.500]  occupations. And in fact, it was interesting, this didn't get picked up on, but Colonel Mark
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:12.660]  Lestoria during that Bastrop Town Hall meeting actually suggested that this was about infiltrating,
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:18.900]  potentially infiltrating US troops into Eastern Europe. So we know that, you know,
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:25.700]  Jade Helm is about infiltrating populations undercover without being noticed. People rightly
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:31.300]  asked the question, well, if this was for Middle East occupation, how could, you know,
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:38.660]  predominantly white US troops and special forces infiltrate Muslim communities without
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:43.380]  being noticed? Well, of course, if it's for Eastern Europe where the population is white,
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:49.460]  then that makes a lot more sense. And he actually mentioned that during that Bastrop Town Hall
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:54.900]  meeting, but nobody really picked him up on it. So I think in a sense, this is more geared towards
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:13:01.380]  foreign military occupations, which in terms of Ukraine and Russia is extremely concerning.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:07.380]  And in a way, the focus on all these conspiracy theories about, you know, Walmart centers being
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:12.340]  internment facilities and all that kind of stuff actually takes the attention away
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:17.220]  from what Jade Helm might be geared towards, which is foreign occupations in particular,
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:23.700]  Ukraine and Russia. Yeah, and of course, they talked a lot about the Walmart conspiracy in the
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:30.820]  TPM memo. I think it is, and we've said that we don't believe that that's part of the Jade Helm.
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:36.260]  I don't know what the Walmart is about. I mean, it's quite likely it's a movement against people
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:42.660]  that unionized in those particular Walmarts. But the explanation that we got from Walmart is so
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:47.940]  ridiculously unbelievable that that's what has invited all this speculation. And that's the
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:53.700]  same thing that we see from the US military, from the Pentagon spokesman. It's not believable.
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:58.500]  But there is one thing, Paul, that is there. And that is mastering the human domain. I think
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:02.740]  we could go back and we look at what that means to the military, how they've been using that for
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:08.180]  number of years, a couple of years ago when McRaven was still head of Special Forces. He was continually
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:13.060]  talking about how they needed to get back to their roots, which are basically nation building,
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:19.540]  also nation destroying, the Psyops that they run on different local political leaders. And they're
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:26.260]  moving that together and offering themselves as a handmade to the cyber intelligence, to the geospatial
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:30.740]  intelligence, saying that we need to have boots on the ground to do this effectively. We can't do
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:36.180]  this completely from terminals at a distance. Listen to this, Paul. This is a Joe McRaven
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:41.300]  two years ago saying, understanding and dominating terrain. And remember, mastering the human domain,
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:46.340]  that's the subtitle to Jade Helm 15. He says, dominating terrain is just as important as it
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:52.020]  was 5,000 years ago. But he said, what's important, we have to understand what terrain we're going
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:56.180]  to dominate and what's important to our enemy or to our allies. And by knowing what motivates the
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:15:00.820]  people, what incentivizes the people, what mobilizes the people, what frightens them,
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:08.100]  that will, and what will undermine their will. Say a great deal of the unconventional warfare
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:12.100]  that they're talking about. And they mentioned in these slides that Jade Helm is unconventional
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:19.300]  warfare. That is to undermine the will of the people to fight. It is to monitor how they respond
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:26.900]  to different inputs and to map that out over a human domain, looking at social media, looking at
[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:32.820]  metadata, examining public opinion and manipulating public opinion. So Paul, I think that a large part
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:37.300]  of this operation is psychological. That's what they have been doing for a very long time.
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:44.260]  Yeah, and they use similar language in the Army civil disturbance operations manual. They talk about,
[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:50.340]  you know, reeducating people to appreciate US policies. So that kind of psychological aspect
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:54.180]  is also in there. Yes, we've also had reports. Hang on, Paul. We got to go to a break. We're

[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:41.620]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight your host in austin and joining us from
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:51.140]  the uk is paul joseph watson we were talking in the last segment about the latest effort to discredit
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:58.100]  any investigation of what jade helm is about any discussion about what the appropriate role of the
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:03.780]  military is they also they point out that this is nothing but a conspiracy theory yet what they're
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:09.220]  doing is they're creating a strawman argument for this saying that this is we're saying that this
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:13.700]  is about martial law takeover this is not i don't think and we've said this from the very
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:17.780]  beginning alex has said it paul joseph watson has said it we've said it repeatedly yet they
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:22.020]  continue to say that we're saying this is about martial law beginning let me read you this quote
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:28.020]  from 2013 this was from uh joe mcgraven who when he or admiral mcgraven when he was head of special
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:34.580]  forces he said special forces can't bring a nation to its knees in other words this is jade helm is a
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:39.780]  joint military exercise for all the different branches of special forces so if they're going to do
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:43.620]  martial law they're not going to bring the nation to its knees even if it was going to be something
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:47.220]  like that they wouldn't use it that way but he says we can shape the outcome of the fight well
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:53.860]  before the battle begins by knowing and influencing populations in phase one then once the fight starts
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:58.020]  we can provide insights that will place the right forces in the right place at the right time
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:04.020]  and to me paul that's what i'm concerned about and that is mastering the human domain understanding
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:10.740]  that for over 15 years the intelligence community homeland security and the military have been talking
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:17.620]  about human domain analytics this is a psyop this is what a friend of joe biggs told him from the
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:21.940]  very beginning from socom he said just shut up it's just a jade helm is just a psyop they want to
[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:27.460]  measure our reaction to it they want to give you disinformation they want to discredit people who
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:33.620]  will investigate and question what the government tells us they want to discredit us with a strawman
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:37.140]  argument that saying that it is something that we're not saying what's your take on this paul
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:44.340]  well the bottom line on it is you know jade helm doesn't exist in a vacuum the article
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:49.940]  beyond denial preparations for martial law documents at length the fact that this has
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:56.500]  been going on for at least 20 years if not more we know the federal government and the u.s military
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:23:01.380]  are preparing for riots they say it in their own documents and then we get you know the
[01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:07.060]  davos economic forum people coming out and saying that the elite are buying strips of land in new
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:12.100]  zeland because they're preparing for civil unrest so that's on the record that's not a conspiracy
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:17.380]  theory there are actual conspiracy theories which are completely ridiculous about jade helm and
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:23.060]  they get a lot of attention and you know take the focus away from what's provable what's manifestly
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:28.580]  provable so they only benefit the mainstream media so you know we've documented that this is an
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:35.140]  ongoing preparation for civil unrest the dhs has prepared for it for a mass influx of immigrants
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:40.340]  from mexico that's all on the record it's no conspiracy theory and no matter how many times
[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:45.940]  you use that word that term it just doesn't wash absolutely and when we look at the fact that they
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:51.060]  say well this is for worldwide operations may very well be as you point out some training for
[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:55.940]  something that they're going to do in the ukraine nevertheless well concerned everybody when the
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:24:04.260]  india act was put together and signed by obama that would allow the military to grab people and hold
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:09.540]  them indefinitely people are very concerned about that because that was something that could be done
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:15.300]  worldwide and according to the authorization for the use of military force america is part of the
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:20.820]  world part of that worldwide war of terror that they have going on but of course you mentioned
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:25.620]  if there's an economic collapse let's let's take this now to the ban on cash of course there's an
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:31.860]  article up today leading german kainzian economists calls for cash ban tell us about that well yeah
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:38.500]  this is german council of economic expert peter bowfinger this came out of spiegel he said quote
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:45.060]  coins and bills are obsolete and only reduce the influence of central banks so currently we've got
[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:51.460]  this obsession uh that technocratic interventionism despite the fact that it's it's proven utterly
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:57.780]  flawed in reviving economic growth is now the answer even though it's proven to have never
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:03.620]  worked in the first place so a few days ago we put out the article about jim levis he wrote an
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:08.820]  editorial out of the telegraph which got linked on drudge which said quote forcing everyone to
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:13.380]  spend only by electronic means from an account held at a government run bank would give the
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:19.620]  authorities far better tools to deal with recessions and economic booms so it's basically
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:25.700]  kainzianism on steroids it sounds like something out of adolf hitler's minister of finance what's
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:32.580]  interesting about levis is when i drew attention to his twitter account after he put out this article
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:38.820]  he not only locked his twitter account he actually removed his own picture his own face
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:44.420]  blacked out his own face from his personal twitter account after he began to catch heat
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:51.620]  for this article so it seems as soon as they start to attract criticism they run away like cowards
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:56.900]  because nobody agrees with them whatsoever and you know we've had cities william buter come out
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:04.260]  and say the same thing a few weeks before we've talked about banks in the uk like hsbc interrogating
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:10.340]  people on the money they deposit and the money they take out when it's in um amounts over five
[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:16.820]  thousand pounds so there's a war on cash and basically central bankers are trying to position
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:22.020]  them so themselves for the next economic collapse the the bond apocalypse which everybody says is
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:28.980]  coming to exploit this situation and they don't want people having a significant amount of control
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:34.340]  over their own capital so that's why they're pushing these kind of draconian measures absolutely
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:38.500]  it's all about control it's about central bank control now they like to spin it as saying that
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:43.860]  it is something that is benign and beneficial but of course it isn't going to be benign and
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:49.060]  beneficial if they take away your freedom and your independence and related to that i mean
[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:55.300]  it's what they're doing with the uh automotive cars with self-driving autonomous cars saying
[01:26:55.300 --> 01:27:00.420]  that they're going to take away and of course we've had uh elon must say it won't be that long
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:05.620]  before humans will be banned from driving cars we've got the head of uber saying that once they get
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:12.260]  self-driving taxis then uh individual car ownership will just go away all of these are control points
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:16.980]  your movement uh your physical movement and of course your movement of cash your control of
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:21.940]  cash and they want to know paul everything about you which is what we've just been talking about
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:27.540]  mastering the human domain looking at all of our metadata looking at our social network looking at
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:33.940]  where what we do where we go the cash that we have it's all part of that dominating the human
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:39.940]  domain and that's a very troubling uh idea but that certainly i think describes very well the
[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:45.220]  broad policies of our government not just abroad but certainly directed here in united states
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:52.580]  exactly and they want you to know that they're collecting all your data not really because
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:58.340]  most of the data is very useful simply for the fact that if you know you're being watched you
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:05.380]  self-police you change your behavior you dissuade yourself from engaging in free speech from
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:11.140]  criticizing authority so just the very notion that you're under surveillance never mind what
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:16.900]  information they've got on you is a control mechanism and then going back to this quote this
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:23.060]  column by levis in the telegraph he said quote if notes and coins were abolished and the only way to
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:30.580]  hold money was through a government controlled bank there would be no escape so he's that brazen
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:36.420]  in talking about how people will their finances will be locked down in prison within this central
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:41.460]  bank a controlled system you know it's it's akin to having a bank account where you have to get
[01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:46.100]  government permission to take out your money yes it talks about attacks on financial transactions
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:51.300]  too paul can you stay with us one more segment sure okay we're going to be right back with paul
[01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:58.340]  joseph watson stay with us
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:07.860]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true

[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:41.220]  in the uk we've been talking about one central bank after the other saying that we need to ban
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:47.140]  cash because that will help them to control the economy better will also help them to control
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:52.180]  us as well i want to talk to paul about bill de berg 2015 that's coming up soon he's going to be
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:56.820]  going to that this year before we do quickly though i want to tell you about prostagard

[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:08.180]  different kind of testosterone that you'll get a dihydrotestosterone and it's something that
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:14.260]  basically causes male pattern baldness it's been seen as the driving force behind benign
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:19.540]  prostate enlargement even prostate cancer your body changes over a period of time one of the
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:23.380]  things that's been recognized as being very effective at helping your body to deal with
[01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:32.020]  those changes with those changes as you get older that kind of testosterone is salt palmetto as
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:38.660]  well as lycopene and of course we've added plant sterols zinc vitamin d3 selenium copper and many
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:43.620]  other key ingredients to prostagard and that's available at an introductory price of five

[01:34:55.060 --> 01:35:00.100]  things or anything that you want to have happened to you in large prostate male pattern baldness
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:05.700]  or even prostate cancer salt palmetto has been recognized by many people as being very effective
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:10.980]  it does have some areas where it is not as effective as some other things complemented
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:16.660]  with lycopene however in this formulation that is very effective in terms of controlling
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:23.460]  your hormones as they change as you go through life let's go back to paul paul as we look at
[01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:29.220]  bill de berg coming up it's important to remember that the e you and the euro uh were put out there
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:35.540]  at the very first bill de berg meeting what was that in 1955 i think yeah that's right and the
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:41.060]  e you's going to be a big subject coming up because of course now that the tories have won again in britain
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:46.900]  we're going to have a eu referendum on whether britain stays in the european union before 2017
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:52.820]  last year we saw a massive revolt in the euro elections against that bill de berg model of
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:36:00.180]  european federalism but the security precautions for this year's bill de berg from from what i've
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:05.380]  read so far seem to be way more intense than what we saw last year in Copenhagen which was
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:14.500]  relatively relaxed they've got the cobra anti-terror forces on standby ready to provide security
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:20.260]  at bill de berg 2015 this was an organization formed in response to the attack on israeli
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:27.620]  athletes at 1972 munich olympics and their speciality is postage rescue and basically
[01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:32.740]  dealing with terrorists they're armed with assault rifles pistols and grenade launchers
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:40.500]  they're going to be on hand for what is probably going to amount to about 100 to 200 protesters
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:45.220]  who actually show up to demonstrate against bill de berg because it's in a quite remote area
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:50.100]  in the austrian alps so you kind of got cobra protecting hydra there right
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:59.860]  yeah sorry go ahead the mistake they've made is they're using the same intensity of security
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:05.860]  procedures for g seven which is a few days before in bavaria germany and then basically
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:11.460]  using that same model for bill de berg when we know it's it's a completely different crowd
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:16.500]  in fact the left-wing protesters some of which are you know agitators and black block anarchists
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:22.740]  who protest g seven aren't interested in bill de berg they never have been you never see those
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:28.580]  kind of protesters at bill de berg but now they're saying in austrian media today that
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:34.180]  the police are expecting violent protesters to show up at bill de berg there's never been one
[01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:41.540]  instance of violence at bill de berg protests in the past they're talking about 2100 police
[01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:47.940]  officers on standby for bill de berg i mean if they show up in those numbers they will outnumber
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:53.940]  the protesters about 10 to 1 at least and why would they need this massive police state you know
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:59.460]  this is just a little friendly meeting with a few corporations and politicians you know meeting
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:05.940]  behind closed doors i when we looked at what happened last year uh they were as you pointed
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:10.260]  out it was very lax compared to all the other bill de berg's i mean we were just across the uh
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:17.460]  we were as close as being across a four-lane uh road with a median in between it yeah and that's
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:21.860]  that's the closest anybody's probably ever got where they weren't harassed by police where they
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:28.020]  weren't moved on so that was quite unprecedented obviously bill de berg security were uncomfortable
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:32.100]  with that and i think it's going to be a lot different this time because they're talking about
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:38.740]  black hawk military helicopters they're talking about roadblocks on all the major roads surrounding
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:45.860]  the hotel they're even talking about police presence on these alpine hike and bike trails
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:50.500]  just for like locals and tourists who are going to be on hikes it's like a bunch of way more intense
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:57.220]  than usual they sound like paranoid conspiracy theorists you know though when we look at this
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:02.100]  and we see that they're meeting in secret as they have for decades for many decades uh
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:05.780]  everybody would laugh at you if you even talked about bill de berg of course that doesn't even
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:10.980]  exist they were able to keep that essentially a secret and i think paul when we look at how this
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:19.300]  went on for many decades now of course we've got a massive treaties that will unite uh north america
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:24.580]  with europe unite north america with the pacific the transatlantic the trans pacific partnership
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:30.340]  agreements these things are all coming together coming to fruition being negotiated for years
[01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:36.580]  in secret by corporate lobbyists when we ignore the things like bill de berg like the council on
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:43.620]  foreign relations uh effect on on issues on government this is what we wind up with we wind
[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:48.900]  up with things like the trans pacific partnership i think it's uh people need to understand that
[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:54.260]  they're now talking about in europe taking away the sovereignty of the different nations we've
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:59.460]  had alan greenspan as well as the head of pimp co one of the world's largest bond companies
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:04.100]  talking about how they're not going to solve this greek tragedy without the european nations
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:09.780]  surrendering their sovereignty to the e you which was essentially put together as a trade block
[01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:16.180]  yeah and that's likely what they're going to be talking about at bill de berg i know that they're
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:21.380]  they're going to be talking about agenda 21 and sustainable development which again
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:26.340]  is based around this plan dopless lowering our standard of living and that all ties into this
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:32.500]  restriction on sovereignty which of course is bill de berg's um raise on detra so that's definitely
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:40.660]  going to be um near the top of the agenda yeah well as they as they consolidate wealth and they're
[01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:44.740]  going to be looking at ways that they can take possession of the land of course that's what
[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:51.780]  agenda 21 is about when you look at uh john mccain at arizona selling off this massive
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:56.980]  amount of public lands parklands historical value religious significance to the indians there that
[01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:02.100]  was under treaty since an early 1950s of course selling that off to a foreign corporation that's
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:06.180]  going to create a crater that you'll be able to see from space this is what it looks like
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:12.500]  this is what you see when the senators like mccain or harry reid take an area and they sell it off to
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:17.460]  a foreign corporation we can see elements of it in the keystone pipeline where you've got trans
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:24.580]  canada canadian corporation given the rights of condemnation of imminent domain taking people's
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:30.420]  farms that they've had in their family for over a hundred years allowing a foreign corporation to
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:34.820]  do that for their own private use that's what we're going to see more and more of that's what
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:39.380]  they're probably talking about in terms of agenda 21 at this bill de berg meeting how
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:45.540]  are they going to now take possession of what they own after they've gotten us into so much debt
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:52.740]  yeah and of course with tpp i mean paul rein's trying to make the argument today that we need
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:57.540]  the united states to be in control of these agreements rather than china it's not about that
[01:41:57.540 --> 01:42:02.900]  it's about the fact that foreign corporations are going to have the power to change us laws that's
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:08.980]  not a pro business position that's not a fiscally conservative position that's a direct threat to
[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:13.860]  sovereignty no matter where you stand in terms of the political spectrum so that's why people are
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:18.500]  concerned about tpp and that's why they want to know the details they've been able to laugh for
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:24.100]  decades about the idea that bill de berg was meeting in secret and now what we see is a trade
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:29.780]  negotiation that is being done in secret and his senator sessions has pointed out paul
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:34.580]  once this is given fast-track authority of course they've already negotiated the agreements that
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:39.460]  they want so it'll be a couple of weeks that people have finally a chance to look at the agreement
[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:44.020]  publicly but there will be no amendments made to it but as senator sessions pointed out they will
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:49.540]  be able to amend this without any further input from our elected representatives thank you so
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:56.420]  much for joining us paul joseph wasin stay with us we'll be right back
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:43:08.020]  who do you prefer barack obama or george w bush well if you haven't figured it out by now these
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:14.260]  guys are corporate spokesmen they're not leaders i mean they both started illegal wars hell they
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:20.020]  both tortured people they bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you they both
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:25.940]  violated the constitution and they even committed war crimes so what's it gonna take i mean what will
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:32.260]  it take to finally wake you up think about it if joseph stallin ran for president as a democrat

[01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:35.700]  the info war welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night we've been talking to paul joseph
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:41.380]  watson from the uk we've been covering what i would say is some pretty bad trends of course we see
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:47.940]  the police state ramping up in the uk with recent counter terrorism pronouncements by david cameron
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:52.580]  saying that you know prior to this point if you just uh obeyed the law we would be very tolerant of
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:48:00.260]  you but those days are over signaling a kind of a pre-crime uh scrutiny of people that we've
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:05.540]  not seen before in western societies it's just ramping up incrementally nevertheless there is
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:13.060]  still some good news here's a bit of good news huge victory usda introduces official non gmo
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:17.140]  label this is a story from natural society they point out in response to the sounds of public
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:22.820]  outcry the u.s. department of agriculture is being forced to do something they have now come up with
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:28.900]  a new certification companies can use to show that their products are free of gmo's now as this
[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:33.700]  article points out you have to kind of be careful about how the labels are set up and i guess it
[01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:39.060]  still remains to be seen exactly what they're going to have in this the non gmo projects
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:47.540]  uh verified uh label that says that the uh the whatever you're buying is not gmo does not certify
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:53.780]  that there are no pesticides in other words they could put some very dangerous inorganic
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:49:01.060]  pesticides on the produce and it could still be non gmo as long as the pesticides and the plant
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:06.340]  were not genetically modified that's why organic is so important and of course there's another
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:10.820]  article that's i think is very helpful if you look at this on info wars dot com this is an article
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:17.540]  from dr group where to find natural building materials use all organic products in your next
[01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:22.660]  project because that reminds us that it's not just the food that we eat but it's also many other
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:30.020]  things that we come in contact with that can give us exposure to inorganic chemicals to things that
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:34.260]  can be very toxic this is a great article i'm not going to go over it in detail but again you'll
[01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:40.260]  find that at info wars dot com where to find natural building materials and then finally there's this
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:46.740]  article that comes out of sweden and what they had was uh sweden's co-op and swedish environmental
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:52.660]  research institute decided that they would do an experiment with a family to see how long it would take
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:58.020]  for them to get pesticide levels out of their body if they started eating organic so what they
[01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:05.300]  did was i took a family of four two adults three kids that were aged uh 12 10 and three they started
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:13.220]  giving them uh organic food they measured their urine samples every morning to see uh how many
[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:18.020]  pesticides had 12 known pesticides and meta metabolites that they were looking at and they
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:23.620]  wanted to see how long it would take to purge this out of their system the good news is that it happened
[01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:29.380]  in only two weeks just two weeks of eating organic they could get the pesticides were being sprayed
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:34.180]  on their food that had been stored in their body they could get it out in that amount of time it's
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:39.540]  very important to understand that as i mentioned you can get organics in the food that you eat you
[01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:44.500]  can get it in the materials that you build with what you're exposed to it's also important to
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:49.300]  understand that there are also internal changes that are going on in your body that's why i was
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:55.780]  talking about our new product prostagard mentioned the fact that as you get older you get a form of
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:51:01.860]  testosterone called dihydrotestosterone one way that you can deal with that is with things like
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:06.340]  saw palmetto or lycopene you can find that in our new product prostagard that's available
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:13.140]  at an introductory price of five dollars off we also have a 20 sale on super male and super
[01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:18.900]  female vitality that'll save you 12 dollars per bottle and that's a very important thing too
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:26.500]  because it's a source of non-gmo natural nutrients that you can get that will also help to deal with
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:31.940]  the changes in your body as you're getting older as men age they often experience a slow down in
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:37.060]  vitality and energy overall wellness and super male vitality is specifically designed to assist
[01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:43.860]  the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males so again that's something
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:49.620]  that you can do to try to take care of your own health even if you can't get the government to
[01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:54.660]  stop putting pesticides in the water that's what fluoride is it's essentially a pesticide they sell
[01:51:54.660 --> 01:52:02.420]  it that way in china you can still filter it out you can get nutrients that will help your body to
[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:09.140]  deal with that to help it purge help you to purge that out well that's our good news now i have to
[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:14.660]  tell you some other bad news there's a couple of very disturbing police videos that came out in
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:19.780]  just the last couple of days one of these came out i think it was on it was yesterday that this came
[01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:25.940]  out where a sheriff in kentucky tells reporters about a shooting he says well i'm just glad the
[01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:34.820]  unarmed guy we shot was white pretty amazing pronouncement but of course the local police chief
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:41.700]  that he had the press conference with was also saying there is no such thing as an unarmed
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:49.060]  encounter with law enforcement now he repeated that twice and i think that was just as inflammatory
[01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:53.780]  as what this sheriff said because you have to understand that in this particular instance
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:58.900]  the guy was he did ram the police vehicle multiple times with his car so he was using
[01:52:58.900 --> 01:53:04.820]  his vehicle as a weapon and that was his point using the vehicle as a weapon yet we have still seen
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:10.020]  this lady in washington dc that was panicked and shot dead with a child in the back seat we also
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:17.300]  have the case that is now coming before grand jury about the police officers who shot seven or eight
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:24.100]  police officers that shot about 150 rounds of ammunition at a car the two people in it unarmed
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:29.860]  and at the end of it one of the police officers reloaded jumped on the hood and unloaded into
[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:34.740]  the two occupants that presumably might have still been alive at that moment that particular officer
[01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:40.820]  is being looked at and he was charged and we're looking to see if that's going to be an indictment
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:46.340]  that's a very volatile situation that's going on in cleveland uh joe biggs is going to go to report
[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:51.860]  on that just as he has in the past along with jacari jackson gone to report on furguson as well
[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:58.020]  as baltimore to see what happens uh hopefully there will be justice done hopefully there will not be
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:03.460]  any riots there but just as this sheriff is saying we're glad the unarmed guy that we shot was white
[01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:09.700]  perhaps that was because white people are essentially comatose when it comes to police
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:14.900]  brutality in this country but black people are experiencing it all the time let's take a look
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:21.220]  at this other report where we have a couple of individuals trying to show the difference
[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:26.420]  in the way a white man and a black man are treated in the same town doing an open carry
[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:31.220]  of an ar-15 which is legal let's run that video and i'll narrate it for those who are listening
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:39.140]  on the radio i'm audio recording as well yes sir okay so this is a white guy he's being challenged
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:49.620]  by the police he wants his id okay any particular reason why you're carrying the ar especially around
[01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:55.460]  at this point i understand that but is there a reason why you're wants to know why he's carrying an
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:55:00.260]  ar-15 okay so it kind of hassles them and i thought it was kind of outrageous but they they did that
[01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:06.900]  fairly shortly now we've got a black man walking down the same street with the same gun and what
[01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:14.020]  happens is the cop he pulled off the gun he's getting down the cop jumps out of his car walking
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:19.060]  up and carrying gets behind the door of the car is pointing a right flat and tells him to get down
[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:23.460]  i mean he doesn't even come over to him and talk like he did the white guy he pulls the gun on him
[01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:29.460]  gets him down on the ground and starts shouting to the woman who is recording this telling her to
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:35.300]  get down she says i'm seven months pregnant i can't lay flat on the ground so he continues to hold
[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:45.700]  the gun on him i'm pregnant i'm seven months pregnant i can't let you know i am audio and video
[01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:55.460]  recording you that's fine i'm audio recording too okay so right now he's still got the gun
[01:55:55.460 --> 01:56:00.020]  trained on him he's at a distance he's standing behind the door of his vehicle and what you're
[01:56:00.020 --> 01:56:03.700]  going to see we're not going to run this whole thing but what happens is they get about a half
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:09.780]  a dozen police cars come up all of them trained guns on him he just had the gun slung over his
[01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:15.700]  shoulder and was walking along and again the white guy was harassed by the uh and challenged by the
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:24.180]  cop the black guy they pulled gun on him instantly and then got a massive army there that speaks
[01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:28.900]  volumes about what's wrong with this country both of those encounters the white guys encounter
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:35.300]  would be bad enough but what you saw with the black man is absolutely outrageous there definitely is
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:41.300]  a racial component to this no one can deny it it's not just about harassing people who are open
[01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:47.700]  caring it is also going directly after uh this black man pointing the gun at him do not try that
[01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:51.220]  at home that's a very dangerous thing i saw some people say well that was really stupid for them
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:58.100]  to do that they could have gotten shot they were making a point very bravely making a point about
[01:56:58.100 --> 01:57:03.620]  what's going on with our law enforcement we need to get control of this we need to have a government
[01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:09.780]  that doesn't operate in secret yet demand to know everything about us we need to understand
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:14.820]  what the mission of our government is we need to be able to control it and when we have the police
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:21.220]  who are frightened who shoot people when they're not a threat to them there needs to be consequences
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:27.380]  for the policeman who does that for the department that does that it shouldn't just be consequences
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:31.780]  for the taxpayer who has to pay a judgment to somebody it shouldn't just be consequences
[01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:37.380]  for the innocent people who get shot we need to see some consequences for the police department
[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:41.300]  they should have to pay something out of their budget even if it shuts them down
[01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:45.860]  and we should see some of these people going to jail when they shoot down innocent people
[01:57:45.860 --> 01:58:00.340]  bless it for today join us again tomorrow at 11 central alex jones will be with us
