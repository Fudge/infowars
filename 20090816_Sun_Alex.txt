[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he

[00:20.840 --> 00:32.440]  well it's Sunday the 16th day of August 2009 we're going to be live here for

[00:47.400 --> 00:52.080]  warming and is documenting that it is a plan to bring in world government a
[00:52.080 --> 01:01.080]  eugenicist religion by an elite that hates the general population so he will
[01:01.080 --> 01:11.320]  be joining us coming up Ian Rutherford plumber will be joining us coming up in
[01:11.320 --> 01:16.960]  the final hour today of course we have a syndicated transmission Monday through
[01:16.960 --> 01:22.000]  Friday from 11 a.m. at 3 p.m. and then we come back Sundays for two hours 4 to
[01:22.000 --> 01:31.120]  6 p.m. central standard time coming up at the bottom of the hour I'm going to
[01:31.120 --> 01:38.280]  spend 5 10 minutes on the whole Joker situation it's got a lot bigger than I
[01:38.280 --> 01:44.800]  thought it would my whole view on history is resistance is victory if you've
[01:44.800 --> 01:49.320]  got the facts and you take action and stand up and believe in yourself you
[01:49.320 --> 01:54.720]  can't be defeated and if you have right on your side there's no way you can be
[01:54.720 --> 01:59.320]  defeated the elite know that if somebody takes action they can affect change
[01:59.320 --> 02:04.120]  that's why the social controllers the social engineers are always seeking to
[02:04.120 --> 02:08.320]  make people feel inadequate and powerless so that people will never even
[02:08.320 --> 02:12.840]  start standing up or not just standing up to corruption living their dreams
[02:12.840 --> 02:17.480]  period the establishment the global architects want to be able to shape the
[02:17.480 --> 02:30.200]  future of the world they want to play God the Joker poster contest we launched
[02:30.200 --> 02:36.520]  about eight nine days ago I don't know not last Monday when we launched it it
[02:36.520 --> 02:43.360]  has just had a huge effect and the posters have been put up with the image of
[02:43.360 --> 02:52.000]  Obama as the Joker and clown makeup with the words info wars comm socialism or
[02:52.000 --> 02:59.160]  fascism or new world order there's four different variants have been plastered
[02:59.160 --> 03:09.440]  all over Tokyo Japan San Francisco California Calcutta India Moscow Russia
[03:09.440 --> 03:16.400]  London England Quebec Canada I mean hundreds of videos have come in I'm
[03:16.400 --> 03:21.000]  spending hours every day I'm not complaining but it's hours I don't have
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.680]  watching these and realizing my god this radio shows got a lot of power because
[03:26.680 --> 03:31.720]  of you the listeners taking action also people are very very angry with Obama
[03:31.720 --> 03:35.840]  and the establishment and all of his lies people were counting on him to not
[03:35.840 --> 03:43.360]  betray the people and he's now clearly done that so we're gonna launch in the
[03:43.360 --> 03:47.360]  next few weeks some type of poster campaign telling people not to take the
[03:47.360 --> 03:53.080]  flu vaccine or at least think twice about taking it with a website a simple
[03:53.080 --> 03:58.360]  web address under it that has some basic bullet points and facts on it because
[03:58.360 --> 04:02.680]  regardless of you if you agree with the image or the message we put out it's the
[04:02.680 --> 04:07.640]  idea of people getting involved going out breaking the controlled paradigm of
[04:07.640 --> 04:13.000]  just sitting inside watching television and politically rediscovering the
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.800]  spirit of 1776 of political activism for 15 years leading up to the start of
[04:18.800 --> 04:29.280]  revolution in this nation 230 plus years ago the people put up broad sheets
[04:29.280 --> 04:35.360]  and posters and effigies of corrupt politicians they built their numbers at
[04:35.360 --> 04:41.440]  a grassroots level and this poster project program operation shows what you
[04:41.440 --> 04:48.960]  can do putting up simple messages in your town because in an age of universal
[04:48.960 --> 04:53.520]  deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act as George Arwell said
[04:53.520 --> 04:58.760]  the big news though on the police state on the flu vaccine it's all coming up
[04:58.760 --> 05:02.720]  after this break Jones have you heard of the millionaire Patriot well you

[06:58.880 --> 07:06.280]  p.m. central standard time abbreviated from the weekday 4-hour broadcast okay let
[07:06.280 --> 07:12.720]  me give you a rundown of the headlines and I'm gonna get into them first off
[07:12.720 --> 07:19.360]  we're gonna cover what's happening with the flu and how it's being used to
[07:19.360 --> 07:23.720]  federalize and expand federal control not just in the United States but
[07:23.720 --> 07:28.840]  worldwide it's being used as a tool of the police state when the evidence is
[07:28.840 --> 07:34.480]  conclusive that it's very weak pathetic flu no big deal why then are they
[07:34.480 --> 07:38.880]  preparing mass graves FEMA camps checkpoints force inoculation here
[07:38.880 --> 07:42.960]  inside the United States now we first discovered this was going on in January
[07:42.960 --> 07:47.120]  of this year we gave you exclusive interviews with emergency managers
[07:47.120 --> 07:52.720]  secret documents from the state of New York people wanted to laugh at us now
[07:52.720 --> 07:57.360]  it's all mainstream news so I thought I'd go over that National Guard takes over
[07:57.360 --> 08:04.320]  school and swine flu vaccine riot drill that's out of TV in Maine governors
[08:04.320 --> 08:08.480]  opposed to Department of Defense emergency powers the National Governors
[08:08.480 --> 08:12.320]  Association has sent a letter to the DoD and White House saying they're
[08:12.320 --> 08:18.120]  concerned about martial law in America under the pretext of the of the flu see
[08:18.120 --> 08:22.400]  that's not Alex saying that eight months ago it's not Alex Jones are saying it
[08:22.400 --> 08:26.320]  three months ago it's now the governor's association the governor's
[08:26.320 --> 08:31.080]  association letterhead the official governors of the country saying that
[08:31.080 --> 08:35.200]  there's there's no more time to live in La La Land here's another one
[08:35.200 --> 08:40.160]  congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law Louisville Journal
[08:40.160 --> 08:44.600]  Louisville Kentucky we'll go over that here's another one Pentagon wants
[08:44.600 --> 08:48.960]  authority to post 400,000 Army and Marine Corps regular troops on the
[08:48.960 --> 08:53.760]  streets of America it's out of the progressive directly from the Pentagon's
[08:53.760 --> 08:59.440]  own website announcement and Congress it's really happening so that's some of
[08:59.440 --> 09:03.520]  what we'll be going over today now that's just politically what they're
[09:03.520 --> 09:09.600]  using the flu fear for here is what and I'm gonna go again more over this later
[09:09.600 --> 09:12.800]  I just want to first give you the total picture that we're looking at here so
[09:12.800 --> 09:16.840]  you can make your decision here I'm not telling you what to believe about all
[09:16.840 --> 09:21.960]  this I'm telling you they're getting mass graves and martial law ready you
[09:21.960 --> 09:29.280]  make your own decision about why all this is happening okay now look at this
[09:29.280 --> 09:33.160]  Reuters headline you know they're preparing as if the flu is the end of
[09:33.160 --> 09:37.440]  the world and they've been setting up for decades the homeland security North
[09:37.440 --> 09:42.600]  com takeover you're now seeing so right as the architecture is complete and the
[09:42.600 --> 09:47.400]  system is built magically the flu appears and they're going to use it for
[09:47.400 --> 09:52.160]  that and they're federalizing every city with the federalization threat
[09:52.160 --> 09:56.000]  integration fusion centers I'm going to get into that later totally illegal
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.440]  totally criminal violation of 9th and 10th Amendment it's all happening all
[10:00.440 --> 10:06.240]  these decades of just huge Death Star level construction project trillions
[10:06.240 --> 10:11.040]  and trillions just a massive technological terror of control and totally
[10:11.040 --> 10:16.240]  unconstitutional a worldwide control grid built by MIT and the Pentagon they
[10:16.240 --> 10:20.200]  all brag face scanning tracking everywhere you go license plate reading
[10:20.200 --> 10:26.920]  systems federalizing everything and now right as they finish construction of it
[10:26.920 --> 10:30.640]  in the last three months oh the flu is here we must have martial law to keep
[10:30.640 --> 10:37.360]  you safe so that's another piece of the panoramic shot here's the rest of it
[10:37.360 --> 10:47.520]  Reuters is it safe you as vaccine experts want to build trust and then the
[10:47.520 --> 10:53.480]  article is how wonderful it is how safe it is how great it is how good it is how
[10:53.480 --> 10:58.000]  wonderful it is just take your shots vaccines are perfect there's never any
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.640]  problems and you hear the radio talk show hosts that are doctors and people
[11:01.640 --> 11:06.520]  up saying a vaccine's never hurt anybody it's only good for you everything's fine
[11:06.520 --> 11:11.000]  don't listen to people that tell you you shouldn't take shots it's the law you've
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.680]  got to take hundreds of vaccines when there is no law so so even if you agree
[11:14.680 --> 11:18.040]  with vaccines you shouldn't agree with lying about it and saying it's the law
[11:18.040 --> 11:25.640]  now let's go over news in the last three days now I'm not even searching for
[11:25.640 --> 11:32.440]  this this is stuff that's appeared on drudge pretty main line in the last three
[11:32.440 --> 11:37.240]  days these headlines have come up without me even looking for it to discredit the
[11:37.240 --> 11:42.680]  flu vaccine the current flu vaccine that the u.s. government's bought a hundred
[11:42.680 --> 11:46.280]  and ninety five million dosages of and now they want to buy another couple
[11:46.280 --> 11:50.920]  hundred million so every american can have at least two shots 300 million
[11:50.920 --> 11:55.360]  americans so they're talking about enough to give 300 million americans three
[11:55.360 --> 12:01.560]  shots so I guess that's 900 million injections but they've so far taken
[12:01.560 --> 12:06.240]  delivery of 195 million two weeks ago the next the next batch is ready in a few
[12:06.240 --> 12:12.920]  weeks this is just from one company alone now Reuters didn't feel like doing a
[12:12.920 --> 12:17.680]  google search and telling you what we're about to tell you globin mail swine flu
[12:17.680 --> 12:25.360]  jab linked a killer nerve disease linked leaked letter reveals concern over
[12:25.360 --> 12:32.440]  neurologist over 25 deaths in america now you wonder why there's all these
[12:32.440 --> 12:36.680]  neurological degenerative diseases people who are 25 getting Alzheimer's or
[12:36.680 --> 12:40.840]  or getting all these other brain diseases in the internal literature they
[12:40.840 --> 12:45.320]  know it's the vaccines the viruses in the vaccines the cancer viruses the
[12:45.320 --> 12:50.520]  chemicals the RNA the DNA from the dead fetuses and the dead monkeys and the
[12:50.520 --> 12:55.520]  dead dogs attacks the brainstem in fact I have the actual university and

[13:02.360 --> 13:06.280]  that's with them covering it up they whitewash those numbers just like we
[13:06.280 --> 13:10.440]  knew Gardasil was killing massive amounts of people that took it in trials
[13:10.440 --> 13:14.720]  three years ago and we and we would have the doctors and the families people
[13:14.720 --> 13:18.200]  who have their daughters die you give your nine-year-old the shot blood starts
[13:18.200 --> 13:22.440]  pouring out a day later of every orifice I mean they die of Ebola like type
[13:22.440 --> 13:26.280]  disease I mean that's how it's described by the medical doctors we've had on I
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.360]  mean that's all we do here is go look this is killing you this is the globin

[13:45.120 --> 13:51.920]  another one this is without looking this is build dot DE the biggest paper in
[13:51.920 --> 13:58.040]  Germany biggest newspaper in Germany does virus vaccine increase the risk of
[13:58.040 --> 14:02.440]  cancer the swine flu vaccine has been hit by a new cancer fears that for a
[14:02.440 --> 14:06.760]  German health expert they have a shock warning about its safety lung specialist
[14:06.760 --> 14:11.320]  Wolfgang Woodrug we're getting him on has said that there are many risk
[14:11.320 --> 14:16.880]  associated with the vaccine for the H1N1 virus he gave grave reservations
[14:16.880 --> 14:24.160]  about the firm norvadas who are developing the vaccine and testing it in
[14:24.160 --> 14:30.080]  Germany so that's norvadas you know VAR TIS that's the one they bought the
[14:30.080 --> 14:37.520]  195 million shots from the vaccination is injected with a very hot needle the
[14:37.520 --> 14:41.440]  scientists said the nutrient solution for the vaccine consists of cancerous
[14:41.440 --> 14:46.160]  cells from animals and we do not know if there could be an allergic reaction but
[14:46.160 --> 14:49.720]  more importantly some people fear that the risk of cancer could be increased by
[14:49.720 --> 14:54.920]  injecting the cells and then it goes on and all the major scientific institutes
[14:54.920 --> 14:59.240]  in Germany the United States and England that know this hundreds of millions of
[14:59.240 --> 15:05.120]  Americans the federal government admits got deadly cancers mainly brain cancers

[21:04.840 --> 21:07.720]  build trust and they're like what's wrong with the
[21:07.720 --> 21:11.960]  conspiracy theorist why don't people want to take the shots
[21:11.960 --> 21:15.080]  you know it's the law you've got to take over a hundred shots when there is no
[21:15.080 --> 21:18.920]  law to take any of it but now they're trying to announce
[21:18.920 --> 21:22.760]  under executive orders forced inoculations during a level six
[21:22.760 --> 21:28.520]  pandemic and that's under un treaty so we're under un control
[21:28.520 --> 21:35.000]  and then just in the last three days i see these headlines swine flu jab
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.760]  linked killer nerve disease leaked letters of doctor's testing vaccine
[21:40.760 --> 21:45.080]  reveals concern of neurologist that's brain scientist
[21:45.080 --> 21:48.680]  over 25 deaths in america here's another one
[21:48.680 --> 21:53.240]  about how uh from bill dot d the biggest paper in germany most respected
[21:53.240 --> 21:56.600]  with top scientists and virologists saying it's killing people
[21:56.600 --> 22:01.320]  and it's got live cancer virus in it oh there's a lot of cancer viruses that
[22:01.320 --> 22:06.280]  wouldn't hurt humans it always quote accidentally gets in
[22:06.280 --> 22:10.680]  with these designer viruses that just so happened to ravage humans
[22:10.680 --> 22:17.240]  but tend to burrow in lodge their RNA and be a chronic viral infection
[22:17.240 --> 22:22.920]  until certain via uh hormone fluctuations associated with lower
[22:22.920 --> 22:29.320]  testosterone or lower estrogen then they trigger and kill you
[22:29.320 --> 22:33.960]  it's a logan's run situation when you've served your usefulness
[22:33.960 --> 22:39.080]  they activate you die so i guess go take your shot
[22:39.080 --> 22:43.560]  the white house such science are just writes 1100 page policy books about
[22:43.560 --> 22:46.360]  how they want to give you vaccines to sterilize you and get rid of you and
[22:46.360 --> 22:49.720]  euthanize you and its official united nations biological diversity
[22:49.720 --> 22:54.280]  assessment treaty 1996 and uh we covered all my
[22:54.280 --> 22:57.320]  film in game but just you know just ignore that it's too
[22:57.320 --> 22:59.640]  horrifying to think they're doing this on purpose
[22:59.640 --> 23:02.920]  i guess bayer accidentally with over a million
[23:02.920 --> 23:06.280]  ampoules of factor eight put hiv and hepatitis in it
[23:06.280 --> 23:09.320]  though their court documents came out and show they did it on purpose
[23:09.320 --> 23:12.920]  i guess it's accidental that all of this is happening
[23:12.920 --> 23:19.160]  and here's the associated press this is the associated press uh yesterday
[23:19.160 --> 23:23.640]  polio surge in nigeria after vaccine virus
[23:23.640 --> 23:27.000]  mutates and i see one of these every two or three weeks
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.680]  i'll see in africa oh the polio shot happened to have hiv and it's sorry
[23:32.680 --> 23:37.080]  was an accident oh the polio shot happened to kill everybody or
[23:37.080 --> 23:41.080]  happen to get everybody sick or oh everybody at the went to the un
[23:41.080 --> 23:45.160]  clinic got hiv you got these countries where 40 something percent of the
[23:45.160 --> 23:48.120]  people have hiv and then they'll go do medical
[23:48.120 --> 23:51.480]  test on them and some of these little girls have never had sex
[23:51.480 --> 23:56.200]  they've never had anything but the un shots
[23:56.200 --> 24:00.120]  and then oh the un gets caught adding hormones to tetanus shots to sterilize
[24:00.120 --> 24:03.160]  little girls oh the indian government got caught doing
[24:03.160 --> 24:07.240]  an under un funding oh the brazilian government got caught
[24:07.240 --> 24:13.560]  oh over and over again they're adding it to the vaccines
[24:13.560 --> 24:20.200]  but here's ap oh just ap and it's an accident of course oh but see
[24:20.200 --> 24:23.400]  there's other talk show hosts and people i hear on the radio saying
[24:23.400 --> 24:26.600]  it's all lies i've heard people call in to talk show hosts
[24:26.600 --> 24:30.280]  you know different medical doctors on the air and say hey bear pharmaceutical
[24:30.280 --> 24:32.680]  knowingly did this and the guy just says no they didn't
[24:32.680 --> 24:35.960]  no they didn't doesn't matter if you know we got msnbc associated press
[24:35.960 --> 24:40.120]  Reuters or we'll say hey all these neurological diseases
[24:40.120 --> 24:43.880]  guillian bernays and all these countless others associated with the shots
[24:43.880 --> 24:47.960]  or conclusively proven to be the shots and they'll just say no no such thing
[24:47.960 --> 24:54.600]  with with no proof well here's the proof polio a dreaded paralyzing disease
[24:54.600 --> 24:57.960]  stamped out in the industrialized world is spreading in nigeria
[24:57.960 --> 25:01.800]  despite ever to stamp it out and health officials say in some cases
[25:01.800 --> 25:06.600]  it's caused by the vaccine used to fight it yeah in the fifties the us government
[25:06.600 --> 25:10.600]  i've had guests on about this actually released polio
[25:10.600 --> 25:14.040]  and then their cure was the shot that did
[25:14.040 --> 25:19.080]  protect you from polio but then gave you a time to lay cancer
[25:19.080 --> 25:23.320]  now some people are resistant to it but you wonder why you got 10 year olds down
[25:23.320 --> 25:26.920]  a cancer now left and right some of its toxic waste and chemicals and
[25:26.920 --> 25:30.440]  things but most of it is the official government plan
[25:30.440 --> 25:34.200]  you know you can go read the white house sides are how
[25:34.200 --> 25:38.600]  you know it's all for you and your family you know
[25:38.600 --> 25:42.680]  yeah i know the football games more important you want to laugh at me and
[25:42.680 --> 25:46.760]  oh alex jones they're setting up martial law and oh alex jones says they're
[25:46.760 --> 25:50.600]  gonna have the pentagon takeover america i just said it 12 years ago because i
[25:50.600 --> 25:54.600]  had their own documents and now they just announce it like it's no big deal
[25:54.600 --> 25:57.640]  you better listen to me if you care about your family
[25:57.640 --> 26:01.160]  i'm not risking my life here to play games with people
[26:01.160 --> 26:06.520]  this is real and all of you that serve the corrupt system did you get the memo
[26:06.520 --> 26:10.200]  not to take the shots did you get the memo not to drink the tap water
[26:10.200 --> 26:13.640]  did you get the memo no oh that's also in the white house science are
[26:13.640 --> 26:17.240]  how to poison your water to sterilize you and they do it
[26:17.240 --> 26:20.600]  not just sodium fluoride
[26:21.320 --> 26:25.000]  polio a dreaded paralyzing disease stamped out in the industrialized world
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.280]  is spreading well it didn't really exist in the industrialized world till they
[26:28.280 --> 26:30.520]  spread it but see they create the crisis
[26:30.520 --> 26:35.320]  offer the solution they give you the cure for one poison they gave you
[26:35.320 --> 26:40.040]  one bio weapon and then give you another polio a dreaded paralyzing disease
[26:40.040 --> 26:43.240]  stamped out in the industrialized world is spreading in nigeria despite efforts
[26:43.240 --> 26:46.600]  to stamp it out a health officials say in some cases it's caused by the
[26:46.600 --> 26:49.720]  vaccine used to fight it oh in kind of like you take
[26:49.720 --> 26:55.160]  Gardasil and you have an autoimmune response in almost every
[26:55.160 --> 26:58.520]  case and then in other minority cases you die
[26:58.520 --> 27:01.800]  and in other cases you just are paralyzed
[27:01.800 --> 27:06.440]  i mean i can play 60 minutes pieces for you about it how about the 76 shot
[27:06.440 --> 27:11.800]  that broke out on a military base then they had the the the swine flew already
[27:11.800 --> 27:18.120]  and then they gave it to the public and killed thousands and thousands
[27:18.120 --> 27:21.480]  the polio problem is just the latest challenge to global health authorities
[27:21.480 --> 27:24.360]  trying to convince wary citizens that vaccine can save them from the dreaded
[27:24.360 --> 27:27.880]  disease for years myths have abounded about vaccines
[27:27.880 --> 27:31.080]  that they were the western world's plan to sterilize africans
[27:31.080 --> 27:35.640]  or give them aids and now because africans run and hide and won't take
[27:35.640 --> 27:39.640]  them they're not getting hiv in those areas because it's in the shots
[27:39.640 --> 27:43.240]  this the sad polio reality fuels misguided fears
[27:43.240 --> 27:46.600]  and underscores the challenges authorities face using a flawed
[27:46.600 --> 27:51.560]  vaccine so so then they go on admit well it's it is giving you polio but
[27:51.560 --> 27:56.360]  it's a conspiracy theory that it's giving you polio
[27:56.360 --> 28:01.240]  i mean they'll have whole villages die and so i mean we're almost everybody
[28:01.240 --> 28:03.960]  dies god knows what they're giving them i've had top
[28:03.960 --> 28:08.120]  virologist on a bowlet as a weaponized system created and given to the
[28:08.120 --> 28:12.360]  africans and then it just goes on now as if
[28:12.360 --> 28:19.800]  that isn't bad enough they tried to do hiv vaccine trials in
[28:19.800 --> 28:23.000]  africa they tried it in asia they tried it in latin america and the people
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.680]  there said no way they did a few limited tests and it killed a lot of the
[28:26.680 --> 28:29.160]  people and associated in fact don't believe me just search
[28:29.160 --> 28:35.560]  engine the term uh patients die in
[28:35.560 --> 28:41.000]  aids vaccine trial but now i have the ap in chicago they want to make the
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.520]  school kids take it because americans will do anything they're told
[28:44.520 --> 28:49.720]  they'll do anything and so here we are and then of course
[28:49.720 --> 28:53.080]  hiv will explode and then they'll run around everybody'll wear red ribbons
[28:53.080 --> 28:56.120]  and it's totally sick we're gonna come back into the

[33:17.640 --> 33:24.120]  all right we are back live so i just gave you the associated press
[33:24.120 --> 33:29.080]  german newspapers british newspapers
[33:29.080 --> 33:35.000]  that is just news the last few days about flu vaccine
[33:35.000 --> 33:41.000]  killing people brain damaging people and then you talk about it and and local
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.720]  media will laugh at you like you're a conspiracy theorist
[33:43.720 --> 33:47.640]  because you know how to read the associated press
[33:47.640 --> 33:51.160]  very very confusing and i happen to know
[33:51.160 --> 33:55.240]  the polio shots that they still give people have live cancer virus
[33:55.240 --> 33:59.000]  that is communicable that means even if you
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.920]  haven't taken the shot you can spread it every major sewer supply in the world
[34:04.920 --> 34:08.760]  has had government studies and they they like study to find it and are
[34:08.760 --> 34:12.600]  pleased by it that every sewage system has the sv 40
[34:12.600 --> 34:17.960]  cancer virus and its mutation variants so when we see them hyping up a couple
[34:17.960 --> 34:21.160]  hundred deaths in the u.s less than 2000 worldwide
[34:21.160 --> 34:25.880]  when regular flu kills hundreds and hundreds close to half a million a
[34:25.880 --> 34:30.120]  year 37 thousand a year on average cdc numbers
[34:30.120 --> 34:34.680]  in the u.s what's the big deal i mean if they've basically already
[34:34.680 --> 34:37.640]  shut down many areas of the world for a few thousand deaths
[34:37.640 --> 34:40.920]  what's going to happen when thousands are dying in the united states compared
[34:40.920 --> 34:45.560]  to 37 000 people are going to be freaking out
[34:45.560 --> 34:53.400]  people are going to be freaking out and so the issue isn't the flu
[34:54.120 --> 34:59.400]  the issue is the vaccine what's in it or do they know it's going to mutate
[34:59.400 --> 35:04.360]  into something particularly deadly it could it could be an earlier version
[35:04.360 --> 35:07.400]  of an engineered virus and top virologists we've interviewed here
[35:07.400 --> 35:12.840]  and bbc as reported and and many others that it is an engineered virus
[35:12.840 --> 35:15.720]  that it was made in the lab they know by its pedigree
[35:15.720 --> 35:19.960]  by how it was designed by the human bird and swine
[35:19.960 --> 35:24.040]  mixtures that are involved what is it two parts human one part swine
[35:24.040 --> 35:28.760]  one part bird so we have all of that going on
[35:28.760 --> 35:32.440]  and the trials they're keeping it very quiet that the trials are killing
[35:32.440 --> 35:35.640]  people just like garter still killed a bunch of
[35:35.640 --> 35:40.760]  people and they didn't care very very strange a warning that the new swine
[35:40.760 --> 35:44.200]  flu jab is linked to a deadly nerve disease
[35:44.200 --> 35:48.280]  has been sent by the government a senior neurologist in a
[35:48.280 --> 35:51.720]  confidential letter the letter from the health protection agency the official
[35:51.720 --> 35:56.040]  body that oversees public health has been leaked to the mail on sunday
[35:56.040 --> 36:00.440]  this is the mail on sunday uh leading to demands to know why the
[36:00.440 --> 36:02.440]  information has not been given to the public
[36:02.440 --> 36:05.640]  before the vaccination of millions of people including children begins
[36:05.640 --> 36:09.880]  it tells the neurologist that they must be alert for an increase in brain
[36:09.880 --> 36:13.960]  disorder called gillian bernay's syndrome and that's only the beginning
[36:13.960 --> 36:20.680]  folks i mean this is they the u.s government admits in multiple
[36:20.680 --> 36:23.720]  studies and when i say hundreds it's in the hundreds
[36:23.720 --> 36:28.840]  i haven't counted them up they know three flu shots
[36:28.840 --> 36:32.600]  on average doubles your chance of Alzheimer's why
[36:32.600 --> 36:39.480]  the adjuvants alone that accelerate the autoimmune response
[36:39.480 --> 36:43.640]  cause brain swelling cause basically poison ivy
[36:43.640 --> 36:46.840]  inside your skull i mean it's the sense of poison ivy is
[36:46.840 --> 36:52.920]  is an autoimmune response it swells up it has inflammation your your
[36:52.920 --> 36:56.840]  pancreas does other organs do and it just fries you
[36:56.840 --> 37:01.000]  it fries you it's like taking a hard drive and throwing it up against the wall
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.920]  you know you're going to be lucky that hard drive ever ever works again
[37:04.920 --> 37:08.200]  and so you wonder why you go down the average american street and now this
[37:08.200 --> 37:11.640]  four-year-old's dying of cancer this 10-year-old's dying it's kind of like
[37:11.640 --> 37:15.080]  the parents where the little ribbons and yeah it's what we do now we have
[37:15.080 --> 37:18.840]  kids so they die of cancer or they got tubes coming out and they're all on
[37:18.840 --> 37:22.360]  respirators and it's like yeah the new thing in america is
[37:22.360 --> 37:25.560]  you know you go to a public school of a couple hundred kids and there's 20 of
[37:25.560 --> 37:29.640]  them dying of cancer it's normal inject inject inject
[37:29.640 --> 37:33.400]  oh the brain damage it's wonderful don't listen to alex he's crazy
[37:33.400 --> 37:36.760]  he just reads government documents where they admit they're doing it on purpose
[37:36.760 --> 37:41.640]  it just freaks him out because he's actually normal
[37:43.080 --> 37:47.560]  i'm normal folks it freaks me out
[37:47.560 --> 37:52.120]  i'll read over and over again how they get caught putting hiv and polio and
[37:52.120 --> 37:55.400]  sterilants in the vaccines all over the world
[37:55.400 --> 37:58.840]  i can type into a search engine right now for you
[37:58.840 --> 38:04.200]  tetanus shot sterilization and you'll get hundreds of mainstream news articles
[38:04.200 --> 38:07.960]  documents admissions they did investigations caught the u in doing
[38:07.960 --> 38:13.560]  it it's a fact okay psychos run everything
[38:13.560 --> 38:17.480]  i said i promise to be calm just how are you calm
[38:17.480 --> 38:20.920]  and you've got these gullible poor simple minded people
[38:20.920 --> 38:25.080]  i look at the public and they just are like lambs of the slaughter
[38:25.080 --> 38:28.520]  they're like people in nazi germany the famous film footage of them being run
[38:28.520 --> 38:31.960]  into pits to be shot in the back of the head they don't even fight back when
[38:31.960 --> 38:38.520]  they're being run into the pits well not me i'm fighting back
[38:38.520 --> 38:41.720]  and if people would just wake up and stand up
[38:41.720 --> 38:45.480]  and say no to all this it could end
[38:47.880 --> 38:51.720]  the nightmare could end if you would admit it was going on
[38:51.720 --> 38:56.840]  but just like germans you're in denial and so fine
[38:56.840 --> 39:01.160]  okay drink more tap water take more vaccines i'm not saying there couldn't be
[39:01.160 --> 39:05.000]  good vaccines i'm not saying there isn't acquired immunity
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.600]  but it's been proven in the real studies that it's not even 50 percent
[39:08.600 --> 39:11.640]  acquired immunity and it causes more problems and answers
[39:11.640 --> 39:14.920]  because they grow most vaccines on dead dogs
[39:14.920 --> 39:18.600]  dead monkeys and now that was the majority before you can pull these
[39:18.600 --> 39:23.240]  numbers up now the majority of it's grown on dead babies
[39:23.240 --> 39:26.840]  thank god they're trying to move to caterpillar eggs
[39:26.840 --> 39:32.120]  don't ask me why that's where they grow them it's what works
[39:32.120 --> 39:36.120]  but this and then they'll lie to you and say oh this is grown on eggs
[39:36.120 --> 39:40.840]  egg yolks egg whites and that's technically true
[39:40.840 --> 39:45.400]  but the seed virus or whatever they're going for is grown
[39:45.400 --> 39:49.240]  on the dead babies mainly retinal tissue for some reason
[39:49.240 --> 39:53.080]  and then that's taken and and and then grown on
[39:53.080 --> 39:59.160]  on other things oh i can't handle anymore in fact people
[39:59.160 --> 40:02.760]  don't believe me right now we're simulcasting at prisonplanet.tv
[40:02.760 --> 40:06.600]  search engine the term
[40:07.320 --> 40:12.840]  vaccines grown on fetal tissue we'll give you an ap or Reuters a bbc
[40:12.840 --> 40:16.680]  because i understand you don't believe me that's fine so i went over all that
[40:16.680 --> 40:19.640]  now we have this going on i want to come back over the break and take your calls
[40:19.640 --> 40:22.600]  on this what do you think now about part two
[40:22.600 --> 40:25.880]  you know what's really in the vaccines
[40:25.880 --> 40:29.080]  and this is not me trying to put on my evidence this is nothing
[40:29.080 --> 40:33.800]  this is nothing this is like one thimble of a mountain
[40:33.800 --> 40:37.960]  of evidence oh you know like scooping one thimble there's a mountain
[40:37.960 --> 40:42.600]  of evidence right there look you just got to go down the rabbit hole for
[40:42.600 --> 40:45.400]  yourself folks you're not going to believe how deep it goes it we are
[40:45.400 --> 40:49.080]  living in a total fantasy land with psycho
[40:49.080 --> 40:53.560]  scientific engineers eugenicists running everything now moving into the final
[40:53.560 --> 40:56.840]  phase and the public's all nihilistic unhealthy
[40:56.840 --> 41:01.560]  you know degrading their bodies just you know not even caring what happens
[41:01.560 --> 41:06.040]  next it's all happening
[41:06.040 --> 41:10.120]  let's just play this a little clip from this tv newscast in main
[41:10.120 --> 41:14.600]  state of main and this is they frame it like it's a christmas
[41:14.600 --> 41:17.880]  toy and remember it came out over a decade ago that
[41:17.880 --> 41:21.720]  big toy makers would even produce a hollywood movie to promote a toy
[41:21.720 --> 41:25.880]  for christmas and just to launch a toy
[41:25.880 --> 41:29.000]  and that they would stage fights over the toy
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.920]  with local reporters they'd paid off to report on it like
[41:32.920 --> 41:37.080]  women fighting over this doll or over this this toy
[41:37.080 --> 41:41.960]  basic psychology and they can make 500 a billion dollars in one toy they said
[41:41.960 --> 41:45.000]  made almost a billion bucks one christmas just off a little bit of
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.640]  staged event now
[41:50.280 --> 41:53.800]  that's what they're doing there's so many facets to this story but they're
[41:53.800 --> 41:57.320]  like everyone wants to break in and get the vaccine
[41:57.320 --> 42:01.080]  and they do these drills we told you in january about secret drills
[42:01.080 --> 42:06.360]  of militias trying to kill troops in indiana and get the vaccines and i
[42:06.360 --> 42:08.840]  said i think they're gonna launch a flu thing in the fall
[42:08.840 --> 42:12.440]  because i was getting this intel confirmed so then there's the whole
[42:12.440 --> 42:15.880]  subject of them training for martial law and training with the police and they
[42:15.880 --> 42:19.160]  do this all over the country quietly now they're announcing it and

[47:21.640 --> 47:25.960]  they're putting in federal fusion centers to spy on you
[47:25.960 --> 47:29.160]  this is taking the local police putting them under federal control
[47:29.160 --> 47:33.640]  showing them the face scanning cameras the license plate reading cameras
[47:33.640 --> 47:37.800]  the new pentagon control arm and then next they're putting local
[47:37.800 --> 47:41.080]  regular army liaisons not just national guard
[47:41.080 --> 47:45.720]  in all the major police departments in the intelligence units the u.s. army
[47:45.720 --> 47:49.320]  watching the american people we were sent secret documents earlier this year
[47:49.320 --> 47:53.800]  that later made it in the baltimore sun so again our story ended up breaking
[47:53.800 --> 47:57.400]  nationally and was confirmed that ron paul myself and others
[47:57.400 --> 48:01.560]  are watched by the u.s. army because we're here telling you
[48:01.560 --> 48:05.960]  about the new world order see the private banks of hijacked america
[48:05.960 --> 48:09.560]  they also happen to be eugenicists that's their hobby
[48:09.560 --> 48:15.640]  and they're on power trips and they're using the army to take over america it
[48:15.640 --> 48:17.880]  happens in third world countries all the time
[48:17.880 --> 48:21.160]  if we educate the military though they can't get away with it so here's this
[48:21.160 --> 48:24.280]  newscast where they're selling the public that everybody's
[48:24.280 --> 48:27.560]  got to have the vaccine that everybody wants the vaccine
[48:27.560 --> 48:31.560]  that that that people are fighting to get in to get it to create the idea that
[48:31.560 --> 48:34.280]  it actually helps you here it is in the town of south
[48:34.280 --> 48:39.000]  paris dozens of national guard troops dressed in riot gear spent the day
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  fighting off angry crowds desperately trying to get their hands on vaccinations
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.560]  against the h1n1 flu at least that's what it all looked like this was a drill
[48:47.560 --> 48:51.640]  however for guardsmen in the event of a swine flu pandemic
[48:51.640 --> 48:56.120]  steve medic has more from oxford hills high school
[48:56.120 --> 48:59.560]  now what you see here is a situation these national guardsmen and police hope
[48:59.560 --> 49:03.480]  they never have to deal with but there is the possibility since
[49:03.480 --> 49:10.040]  oxford hills high school is a dispensing point for the vaccination
[49:10.040 --> 49:13.880]  there are riots you know hey there's the medicine we want it now
[49:13.880 --> 49:19.080]  they're going to overwhelm the local pd
[49:19.080 --> 49:24.760]  it's a what if worst-case scenario what if local police were not enough to quell
[49:24.760 --> 49:29.000]  crowds of people so panic to get a flu shot they turn violent
[49:29.000 --> 49:34.120]  well that is when they call in the national guard
[49:34.120 --> 49:37.000]  we're treating every situation as it's actually happening
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.840]  we try to train as we fight we say in the military you guys be loud and
[49:40.840 --> 49:45.000]  boisterous all right cause some confusion this drill is designed to
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.560]  look and feel as realistic as possible okay that's enough
[49:49.560 --> 49:52.600]  because i gotta cover the rest of the news and get the calls and watch the whole
[49:52.600 --> 49:58.280]  video clip up on info wars dot com and prisonplanet.com right now
[49:58.280 --> 50:02.920]  but the issue here is this is also a sigh out for the troops
[50:02.920 --> 50:06.920]  troops have been refusing smallpox and anthrac shots the military says do you
[50:06.920 --> 50:11.160]  got to you don't have rights but then we educated the troops that it's an
[50:11.160 --> 50:14.600]  experimental shot so they can't even force troops to take an
[50:14.600 --> 50:20.200]  experimental shot so it's also meant to make the troops think it's
[50:20.200 --> 50:23.560]  something great everybody wants i've been to femacamp drills where they
[50:23.560 --> 50:26.920]  practice confiscating your guns taking your children breaking up your
[50:26.920 --> 50:29.320]  families putting you in death camps basically
[50:29.320 --> 50:34.600]  said my film police day 2000 and the marines in in in that drill
[50:34.600 --> 50:37.720]  the american people were begging to be led into the camp
[50:37.720 --> 50:41.400]  say they always psychologists write all this up
[50:41.400 --> 50:45.240]  to make it so the troops are like americans want to be in camps
[50:45.240 --> 50:48.840]  now they're having marines and army regular army regular marines
[50:48.840 --> 50:52.680]  in tennessee california all over the country mainstream news articles are up
[50:52.680 --> 50:57.720]  on our side we that state reps on from those states about it
[50:57.720 --> 51:01.800]  the marines set up random checkpoints
[51:01.800 --> 51:05.080]  searching people
[51:06.680 --> 51:09.800]  and they say oh we're looking for drunk drivers you're not
[51:09.800 --> 51:13.240]  for drunk driving are you when the local newspaper was like doesn't that violate
[51:13.240 --> 51:16.760]  federal law the marines said we'll do whatever we can to stop drunk
[51:16.760 --> 51:21.000]  drivers like chief arse is art a saveta will take
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.880]  your blood to stop it and oh and now we got to be
[51:23.880 --> 51:29.480]  federalized to stop crime and again it's all rational and all an excuse
[51:29.480 --> 51:33.240]  as the united states goes into receivership the good news is
[51:33.240 --> 51:37.320]  the people are waking up the good news is
[51:37.320 --> 51:43.000]  the governor's association the hill newspaper reports the big dc paper
[51:43.000 --> 51:48.440]  governors oppose do d emergency powers a bipartisan governors is opposing a new
[51:48.440 --> 51:51.960]  defense department proposal to handle natural and terrorism related
[51:51.960 --> 51:54.840]  disasters contending that the murky chain of command
[51:54.840 --> 51:57.480]  could lead to more problems actually read the letter they say it's the end
[51:57.480 --> 52:01.960]  of posse common taught us a takeover in fact congressman brown who were getting
[52:01.960 --> 52:04.840]  on next week was even more specific
[52:04.840 --> 52:10.120]  obama could use pandemic to declare martial law
[52:10.120 --> 52:14.040]  a letter sent by the national governor's association to the pentagon last week
[52:14.040 --> 52:18.520]  also echoed that and he says domestic emergency deployment may be just the
[52:18.520 --> 52:21.080]  first example of a series of expansions in
[52:21.080 --> 52:25.240]  presidential and military authority or even an increase in domestic
[52:25.240 --> 52:30.680]  surveillance warned anna christensen of the aclu they agreed
[52:31.080 --> 52:34.760]  here's what congressman brown said to the paper
[52:34.760 --> 52:38.040]  they're trying to develop an environment where they can take over he said
[52:38.040 --> 52:42.040]  we've seen that historically this is congressman brown
[52:42.040 --> 52:46.440]  ron paul alex jones the governor's association
[52:46.440 --> 52:50.840]  it's real and they're going to use the flu as their cover
[52:50.840 --> 52:55.720]  unless we expose them then their program will stop
[52:55.720 --> 52:59.240]  ladies and gentlemen every other country falls to tyranny russia china
[52:59.240 --> 53:02.600]  germany germany was more democratic in many respects
[53:02.600 --> 53:05.960]  more upright people and look what happened to them with hitler
[53:05.960 --> 53:10.200]  all it takes is crises and a bad economy and it's over
[53:10.200 --> 53:13.880]  and ladies and gentlemen they have white house enemy list they say tell us if
[53:13.880 --> 53:17.160]  anybody says things fishy about the president report on your neighbors and
[53:17.160 --> 53:21.640]  is this that isn't bad enough the progressives reporting the ap's
[53:21.640 --> 53:25.000]  reporting but of course they're reporting it's good the ap is
[53:25.000 --> 53:29.640]  the pentagon wants authority to post 400 000 military personnel in the u.s
[53:29.640 --> 53:32.360]  the pentagon has gone to congress to grant the secretary of defense the
[53:32.360 --> 53:36.680]  authority to post 400 000 they already announced homeland
[53:36.680 --> 53:42.920]  brigades five brigades 20 000 but now to quote engage and quote

[54:05.000 --> 54:08.840]  martial law subject then get into their global religion of eugenics and and
[54:08.840 --> 54:14.120]  the cap and trade thank you gentlemen the pentagon wants authority to post
[54:14.120 --> 54:20.440]  almost 400 000 military personnel in u.s and uh this is a congress
[54:20.440 --> 54:25.080]  taken together these reserve units would amount to more than 379 000
[54:25.080 --> 54:28.040]  military personnel in thousands of communities across the united states
[54:28.040 --> 54:31.960]  this they want them deployed in your town i mean red dawn
[54:31.960 --> 54:36.120]  troops standing around to make sure the tea parties and the american people
[54:36.120 --> 54:39.480]  they knew you'd rebel against all this so they've been building this
[54:39.480 --> 54:43.240]  architecture saying it was for al-qaeda now they go
[54:43.240 --> 54:47.240]  oh no dhs says it's for gun owners conservatives
[54:47.240 --> 54:51.480]  returning veterans you're the number one threat you are what homeland security
[54:51.480 --> 54:58.120]  are set up for you understand the magnitude of what we're dealing with
[54:58.120 --> 55:02.200]  as a society folks everything i told you was real
[55:02.200 --> 55:05.240]  all these years i mean i would go interview the police chief of san
[55:05.240 --> 55:10.200]  antonio where the delta force came and tried to bribe him in his office
[55:10.200 --> 55:14.040]  just to be friends and help him with covert ops they were just there to make
[55:14.040 --> 55:17.800]  the deal so he would work with them in the future on narcotics trafficking
[55:17.800 --> 55:21.400]  but he didn't go along with it i don't think even the chief police knew that
[55:21.400 --> 55:26.040]  but later that came out folks the government is a criminal enterprise
[55:26.040 --> 55:30.120]  now wholly owned subsidiary of offshore banks
[55:30.120 --> 55:35.880]  all right i mean i i found out about this stuff in 98 99 and people would
[55:35.880 --> 55:41.880]  laugh at me this is real this is real the governor's association congressman
[55:41.880 --> 55:47.000]  saying what i'm saying what's happened is the governors are finally
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.440]  reading the john warner defense authorization act that states
[55:50.440 --> 55:56.840]  north com's main job is suppressing state legislatures and governors
[55:56.840 --> 56:01.080]  yeah abraham lincoln type stuff but there's no excuse of ending slavery this
[56:01.080 --> 56:05.000]  time so that's what's going on and you notice
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.720]  obama keeps calling himself abraham lincoln okay i want to spend two minutes
[56:09.720 --> 56:14.040]  on the joker situation then we're going to come back take calls after the news
[56:14.040 --> 56:18.280]  on the marshal law situation the flu situation and then get a uh expert on
[56:18.280 --> 56:23.000]  about the uh carbon tax but i have never launched something this
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.280]  effective i mean i've made films that have been seen by 30 40 50 million people
[56:26.280 --> 56:30.920]  defending on the film we wrote the book on info war on going
[56:30.920 --> 56:34.040]  and taking over city hall meetings county commissioner meetings
[56:34.040 --> 56:39.000]  on guerrilla information warfare that you now see
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.640]  taking over the you know everything just made sense to us as the way to get the
[56:43.640 --> 56:47.320]  attention out was to get to news conferences get the things get the
[56:47.320 --> 56:50.360]  info out and i'm very proud of that but i've

[57:24.840 --> 57:28.920]  they're even saying it's bad to put it on a wooden post but they didn't care
[57:28.920 --> 57:32.200]  about all the obama signs when he told the washington post readers
[57:32.200 --> 57:36.440]  to post his image up on stop signs remember that during the campaign
[57:36.440 --> 57:40.200]  we're not saying do anything uncivil our contest says

[1:00:32.360 --> 1:00:36.680]  it's just incredible i mean i've just had videos from san francisco
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:41.800]  london new york where people are putting up 300 400 500 a thousand
[1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:47.400]  of the posters in just great shots of it tokyo
[1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:54.920]  uh germany and berlin moscow just incredible listeners and
[1:00:54.920 --> 1:00:58.600]  what happened is when the government came out
[1:00:58.600 --> 1:01:03.880]  in claremont and said they were going to arrest whoever was putting them up
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:07.080]  then people went even more wild in claremont and put
[1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:10.600]  10 times more up the police have said and now the police are kind of getting
[1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:14.840]  sensible and backing off because uh at least they are for now
[1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:17.400]  they say well now we're thinking it may be a first amendment issue but they
[1:01:17.400 --> 1:01:20.200]  shouldn't put it on mailboxes and i agree i told people they should and
[1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:23.240]  people should stop that they've kind of been doing it more aggressively now and
[1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:26.760]  i've told people don't do that because that distracts from the message but
[1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:30.840]  whatever i mean the founding fathers did a lot a lot more than that
[1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:37.080]  you know the bigger issue is it's much worse to have 23.7 trillion stolen
[1:01:37.080 --> 1:01:40.280]  it's much worse to have all these serious government crimes going on
[1:01:40.280 --> 1:01:43.480]  than to have the government then hypocritically
[1:01:43.480 --> 1:01:46.920]  obsessing over someone's putting signs up on
[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:53.080]  on on uh telephone polls it's so scary and they say on the newscast
[1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:57.320]  it should be illegal the president looks scary this is wrong this is
[1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:01.480]  disrespectful so the government look crazy on the news
[1:02:01.480 --> 1:02:04.440]  and the few citizens they showed saying they were against it and it turns out
[1:02:04.440 --> 1:02:07.880]  the vast majority of the public's for it and so it's totally blown up in the
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:10.280]  government's face i'm going to cover it at the end of the show
[1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:14.040]  let's go to sam and florida sam you're on the air welcome
[1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:17.640]  hi i was a long time listener first time caller
[1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:21.240]  welcome just wanted to ask you just a real quick question one
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:25.080]  i live in orlando florida and we're surrounded by water
[1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:28.280]  and i was wondering when martial law just
[1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:32.440]  declared where would you run to first if you lived in the state of florida
[1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:36.840]  to um those my kids i've taken my kids out of the
[1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:41.960]  um osceola county school district um this year because we're not
[1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:45.880]  going to have our kids and you know um given the
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:51.320]  um vaccination shot so it then went drawn and i know that when my wife called
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:55.720]  the school to get them taken out of school um they said jeez another one's
[1:02:55.720 --> 1:02:58.440]  being taken out why are you all withdrawing your kids
[1:02:58.440 --> 1:03:02.280]  well i wonder why because we know the government's run by a bunch of criminals
[1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:05.880]  that's why okay well three we went and posted the
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:09.560]  obama pictures all over orlando over by universal
[1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:14.840]  studios over by disney over by just all over orlando
[1:03:14.840 --> 1:03:18.440]  and on our last night we got approached by an orange county deputy
[1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:23.480]  who advised us that it's illegal to post our posters or any other posters
[1:03:23.480 --> 1:03:28.360]  anywhere in the county on any public telephone call
[1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:32.600]  um but he didn't give you a ticket did he he didn't give you a ticket did you
[1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:36.440]  he did not but the first thing well the issue here's the issue
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:40.200]  different towns allow it some towns does wasn't follow local laws
[1:03:40.200 --> 1:03:43.960]  but if they selectively harass you when it's common law
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:47.160]  or common practice where you see hundreds of posters up
[1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:51.240]  and then you go put your poster up then that's a fraud
[1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:55.480]  and but you know the point is the knitting over it and the whining and
[1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:59.560]  and the news saying you know i had two spanish news stations including a
[1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:03.320]  national one called for my arrest saying it's racist
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:07.000]  so the fact that they're telling us we're racist and trying to intimidate us
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:10.920]  and and saying the poster itself is bad that's why people
[1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:14.920]  are standing up and saying no so follow the laws in your area
[1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:18.200]  uh i certainly want to say that but you know
[1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:21.400]  sometimes you know these little petty laws too are there to be ignored
[1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:24.200]  when you're talking about standing up against the tyranny i mean if we have
[1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:27.160]  martial law they're going to say it's illegal to criticize the government
[1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:30.440]  well that law is a fraud you know they had laws saying black people were
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:33.160]  slaves and finally black stood up and said i'm not
[1:04:33.160 --> 1:04:37.640]  your property i'm a human being so uh but i mean what's your question
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:41.400]  well the question is again the first question i guess i actually answered my
[1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:43.960]  question but the first question is if you had a
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:49.080]  choice is there a place to run to yeah let me say this let me say this
[1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:52.120]  obviously a rural area where you're not close to people
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:55.160]  if the flu outbreak turns out to be a real deadly virus
[1:04:55.160 --> 1:04:59.240]  anywhere where you can stay you know five six acres we'll be right back
[1:04:59.240 --> 1:05:02.520]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider
[1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:05.880]  buying a solar power generator this summer number one new climate
[1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:08.520]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:13.000]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:16.360]  company allows you to have it's true total government control
[1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:19.480]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:23.160]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:26.040]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:29.560]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:05:29.560 --> 1:05:32.680]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:35.800]  outages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:05:35.800 --> 1:05:39.320]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[1:05:39.320 --> 1:05:42.120]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:45.400]  a long time sponsor of ours you can get more information at

[1:06:05.640 --> 1:06:13.400]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:06:13.400 --> 1:06:18.040]  we got one of the most outspoken critics and scientists
[1:06:18.040 --> 1:06:21.400]  against the new religion of global warming and global carbon tax
[1:06:21.400 --> 1:06:24.600]  that's coming up the next segment let's continue with your phone calls here
[1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:28.440]  let's go ahead and talk to ingrid in nevada ingrid you're on the air welcome
[1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:33.480]  worldwide hello alex i wanted to ask you something
[1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:39.000]  my friend made some obama choker posters yesterday
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.320]  and they say the one that's for bank robbery
[1:06:43.320 --> 1:06:47.000]  what is your opinion on that i think it's pure genius i think it's pure
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:50.760]  genius and you've actually hit upon my next contest
[1:06:50.760 --> 1:06:54.520]  i want to keep the uh... friday is any more time to watch
[1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:58.920]  i have to be fair and watch the literally hundreds of videos i've watched a
[1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:02.600]  lot of them but as fast as i watch them more coming into the inbox
[1:07:02.600 --> 1:07:06.760]  they're just incredible we've got to also get them all posted on one page
[1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:10.360]  or a group of pages so they load quickly uh...
[1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:14.920]  and the next i watch a lot of them awesome the next contest
[1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:21.240]  is going to be for the best new term or or slogan and we're going to post
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:24.840]  different slogans different people's photoshop jokers
[1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:30.680]  of obama my graphics lady made an unbelievably good one a bush and
[1:07:30.680 --> 1:07:33.480]  people want to do that this is this is bipartisan
[1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:36.920]  we are exposing these puppets for what they are but obama
[1:07:36.920 --> 1:07:39.720]  is the big puppet right now that has the whole new world order
[1:07:39.720 --> 1:07:44.280]  train hooked up to his engine so we're and and when they said two weeks ago
[1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:47.960]  it's racist and bad to put these up i said put more of them up
[1:07:47.960 --> 1:07:51.240]  uh... because it's a first amendment do it in legal and lawful areas
[1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:54.920]  that's why we did the contest because they were demonizing people calling him
[1:07:54.920 --> 1:07:58.360]  a socialist and msnbc and cnn said it is
[1:07:58.360 --> 1:08:03.160]  the n-word to say socialist no hitler was a national socialist
[1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:07.480]  it's not the n-word this you know to say hugo chavez is a socialist
[1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:12.040]  or obama wants to socialize health care it's the truth
[1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:15.560]  and so this politically correct assault on free speech
[1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:19.240]  they know it's not racist to say socialist they cold-bloodedly
[1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:23.160]  want to win their political takeover of twenty percent of the economy of the
[1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:26.040]  of its left the government doesn't control but
[1:08:26.040 --> 1:08:30.120]  uh... that's a great idea the picture of obama wanted for bank robbery
[1:08:30.120 --> 1:08:34.360]  great idea wanted for being a puppet of the new world order
[1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:37.720]  right on alex and i'm going to help them put it out today
[1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:41.560]  all right god bless you god bless you yeah listen folks
[1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:45.480]  you have to put out our posters you know it's a first amendment
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:50.120]  the power of the people not just going to town halls but calling into talk radio
[1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:54.120]  letters to the editor starting blogs commenting on comment pages
[1:08:54.120 --> 1:08:57.720]  going out standing on a street corner with a sign with a message
[1:08:57.720 --> 1:09:00.680]  uh... putting up uh... you know little printouts with a message
[1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:05.560]  we're going to do one against the flu shot about you know think twice or
[1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:08.440]  you know uh... flu shot causes brain damage
[1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:12.520]  and and and then we'll have links under it to the associated press reporting on
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:14.360]  it
[1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:17.960]  i mean we want to warn we're not going to just sit here and take it anymore
[1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:24.600]  this is about standing up nick in florida you're on the air sir go ahead
[1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:27.960]  hey alex how you doing good buddy yeah i just wanted to tell me i'm really
[1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:30.200]  worried just thought about my son he said it
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:33.800]  and i just read picking him up from school you know and he tells me he got
[1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:36.360]  stuck with a shot or something or that nasal injection
[1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:41.080]  who missed uh... that they have oh man that's the one of all those uh those
[1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:45.080]  aerosolize ones do not have that right so
[1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:47.880]  basically i just wanted to say what physical response do you think america
[1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:50.440]  would have if that happens uh...
[1:09:50.440 --> 1:09:54.360]  would that literally start riots or yes i mean it would have been
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:58.840]  yes now notice the army's training for us rioting wanting the shots
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:03.640]  that's a sigh of they know and they admit the cdc does is going to be riots
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:07.880]  not wanting it we played these uh... internal
[1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:12.520]  uh... you know phone conferences the cdc's doing with with different emergency
[1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:16.360]  managers where they're admitting that they know people don't want it
[1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:19.240]  i mean they know there's 20 percent 30 percent that are total idiots and when
[1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:22.200]  walking to a gas chamber you know they were told to for
[1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:25.400]  or you know run into a pit you know they i mean they can see hitler lower down
[1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:28.760]  but as long as the media said worship him they'd put little mustaches on and
[1:10:28.760 --> 1:10:32.520]  start start bowing it but they know 60 70 percent
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:39.080]  are awake now and so they are planning to order compulsory shots in the fall
[1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:41.960]  and they're going to use the captive audiences of the public schools
[1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:46.920]  and the captive audiences of government buildings and nurses and police and
[1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:50.680]  military and firemen they're gonna try to make first responders take it but
[1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:54.360]  they already refused in 2002 remember that with with the
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:58.280]  model states of the emergency powers act they want to make the enforcers do it
[1:10:58.280 --> 1:11:01.240]  first to make us but police and firemen are already
[1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:04.920]  refusing across the country nurses unions are already refusing
[1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:09.160]  so i see it kind of failing but it's another beta test
[1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:13.880]  so next time we'll give in see they just keep trying and trying and gaining
[1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:17.560]  more ground each time that's why instead of just sitting here taking it
[1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:20.520]  we've got to launch our own info war offensives
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:23.800]  to say no to their system we've got to stop just
[1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:27.960]  defending we've got to get offensive on them in the info war
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:32.120]  and take background which we've been doing we've been doing it with federal
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:36.360]  court rulings on the second amendment and and states rights we're on the march
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:40.360]  the empire is on the run but no no they're gonna have a bunch of hysteria
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:44.360]  and tell you they're about to vaccinate them and you know try to get you to run
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:48.440]  in fear to go do it in most schools in some schools
[1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:51.720]  they're gonna do beta test and we've caught them in hospitals as well
[1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:55.000]  giving newborn baby shots when the parents say no
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:12:00.040]  so uh that's up to you sir okay but i mean do they have a legal right to just
[1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:03.640]  sneak and do it like no no no and you need to send a letter to the school
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:07.320]  nurse and the principal or go in nicely and say hey look i'm sure you've heard
[1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:12.840]  you know here's here's ap here's uh you know the german news the
[1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:16.680]  british news about brain damage this shot brain damaging and killing people
[1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:20.600]  uh just you know i just wanted to educate you first by the way appreciate
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:23.960]  what you did with the school blah blah blah you know be a politician about it
[1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:28.200]  but then say by the way here's a letter put this in the file my son is not to
[1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:30.840]  be vaccinated or given any other medical care
[1:12:30.840 --> 1:12:34.440]  well you know without my consent you understand and that's and that's already
[1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:38.440]  law see they're trying to set the precedent to ignore the law now
[1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:41.880]  they're trying to create new precedent just to do whatever they want
[1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:45.320]  just like the eugenicist 90 years ago just started grabbing kids off the
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:49.400]  street sterilizing them they didn't have a law they just created new fake courts
[1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:53.640]  and did it and people then got mad in the 40s and said no so they had to back
[1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:57.400]  off and just start doing it by other covert means like the
[1:12:57.400 --> 1:13:01.640]  white house science are says by putting it in vaccines in the water
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:05.080]  you understand yeah i got it thanks alex god bless you

[1:13:24.280 --> 1:13:28.040]  with this whole history of this stuff going on
[1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:32.280]  why would we trust anything the establishment says or does why would we
[1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:36.280]  take any shots they push on us and i mean look at this here i mean i just

[1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:15.480]  live cancer viruses in the vaccines look whether you're for or against vaccines
[1:14:15.480 --> 1:14:22.200]  isn't the issue the issue is these these cloned stem cell line
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:26.840]  high-tech vaccines it used to take six nine months to make a
[1:14:26.840 --> 1:14:31.320]  vaccine the old-fashioned way now they do it by cloning the virus
[1:14:31.320 --> 1:14:35.240]  and then the stuff they breed it up in the dead fetal tissue the dead monkeys
[1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:38.840]  the dead dogs the dead humans has got all these other
[1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:42.200]  viruses and rna and dna and it gets all mixed in
[1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:45.400]  and is very very serious we're going to go to break and come back with our
[1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:48.440]  guest we're very very excited to have him on with us joining us very early in
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:53.400]  the morning from the land down under and we're going to get into a host of
[1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:57.960]  important issues dealing with global man-made climate change
[1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:01.480]  if you believe in that i've got a bridge i want to sell you on the moon
[1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:06.040]  global warming is the new religion of first world urban elites
[1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:10.040]  is the vancouver sun headline that's a quote
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:14.200]  from our guest that's coming up after the break geologist
[1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:19.400]  ian climber takes a contrary view arguing that man-made climate change is
[1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:22.760]  a con trick perpetrated by environmentalists but see that's a
[1:15:22.760 --> 1:15:25.720]  con trick right there it's not a contrarian view
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:30.520]  30 what was it 37 000 scientists a few months ago
[1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:36.280]  sent testimony to the congress saying that man-made global warming is a fraud
[1:15:36.280 --> 1:15:41.400]  that it's almost all sun-driven and also ions from space form the
[1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:46.280]  nuclei for clouds so just space radiation and that
[1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:49.640]  that the moons of saturn and jupiter were melting
[1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:53.720]  now have refrozen that the polar ice caps of mars were getting smaller now
[1:15:53.720 --> 1:15:59.800]  are getting bigger again it's the sun but see they call that contrarian
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:04.040]  hello this is alex jones with some important questions

[1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:15.000]  pollutants are present in municipal drinking water
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:18.680]  many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:22.360]  and developmental system diseases now what are you going to do about it

[1:19:03.880 --> 1:19:07.800]  buying a solar power generator this summer number one new climate legislation
[1:19:07.800 --> 1:19:09.880]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:14.360]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[1:19:14.360 --> 1:19:17.720]  company allows you to have it's true total government control
[1:19:17.720 --> 1:19:20.840]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:24.520]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:19:24.520 --> 1:19:27.400]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:30.920]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:34.040]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:19:34.040 --> 1:19:37.160]  outages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:19:37.160 --> 1:19:41.000]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.480]  power generators offered by solutions from science
[1:19:43.480 --> 1:19:46.760]  a long time sponsor of ours you can get more information at
[1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:51.480]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:55.800]  remember the government doesn't own the sun yet so go to mysolarbackup.com
[1:19:55.800 --> 1:20:01.400]  or call toll-free 877-327-0365
[1:20:01.400 --> 1:20:14.280]  all right we're back live take a few phone calls for those that are
[1:20:14.280 --> 1:20:18.120]  holding steve bill ryan and others right at the end of this hour
[1:20:18.120 --> 1:20:22.200]  but for uh most of this hour we're joined by
[1:20:22.200 --> 1:20:26.520]  ian rutherford climber he is an australian geologist
[1:20:26.520 --> 1:20:30.360]  and an academic he is a critic of um
[1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:34.760]  the fact that they're claiming that global warming is man made
[1:20:34.760 --> 1:20:37.960]  and he has a book that's the best seller on the issue
[1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:41.080]  heaven and earth global warming the missing science
[1:20:41.080 --> 1:20:43.960]  he is critical of the greenhouse gas politics and argues that extreme
[1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:47.400]  environmental changes are inevitable well that's what the geological record
[1:20:47.400 --> 1:20:50.760]  shows and so he joins us now from australia
[1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:54.760]  very early in the morning what 5 30 in the morning 5 20 in the morning there's
[1:20:54.760 --> 1:21:00.120]  it's now five minutes to eight okay land australia in the desert where it's
[1:21:00.120 --> 1:21:04.440]  beautifully warm not a cloud in the sky we've just survived a
[1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:09.080]  massive dust storm okay good good because you know the
[1:21:09.080 --> 1:21:12.120]  guys told me they had you on the weekday show would be five in the morning
[1:21:12.120 --> 1:21:14.920]  that's why we're having you on sunday because it could be eight in the morning
[1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:18.600]  well uh doctor it's a doctor it's great to have you here with us
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:22.520]  break it down the new religion you know the media tries to make fun of you for
[1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:27.320]  that but in the biological diversity assessment 96 uh in their own statements
[1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:30.600]  they say this is a guy our religion don't they
[1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:34.680]  well very much so and if we look back in the past we've had massive climate
[1:21:34.680 --> 1:21:39.800]  changes they have been extremely rapid they've been driven by processes other
[1:21:39.800 --> 1:21:43.800]  than carbon dioxide so if you want to ignore all of that
[1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:47.880]  and say oh no just because we're living on earth now it's due to we humans
[1:21:47.880 --> 1:21:51.320]  then you're really taking a religious view because you're ignoring all the
[1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:57.400]  concrete evidence there's a lot of skeptics out there
[1:21:57.400 --> 1:22:02.840]  if you were on say national television in the us and had five minutes to boil
[1:22:02.840 --> 1:22:06.680]  it down you know just the basics for people what
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:09.880]  would you say to them i would say look into the past
[1:22:09.880 --> 1:22:14.680]  look into what's happened in your life and in this century for the last eight
[1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:18.920]  years we've had cooling yet carbon dioxide has been going up
[1:22:18.920 --> 1:22:23.640]  if we look back 2000 years we can see it was very warm in roman times
[1:22:23.640 --> 1:22:27.960]  and very warm in medieval times it was about five degrees warmer
[1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:33.000]  sea level didn't rise people didn't die in fact we had a thriving population
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:36.680]  and the cold periods of the dark ages and the little ice age
[1:22:36.680 --> 1:22:42.200]  are when we had massive depopulation when people died like flies if you look
[1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:46.200]  back further in time in archaeological time we can see that every time it's
[1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:49.640]  warmed up in one of these warming and cooling cycles
[1:22:49.640 --> 1:22:53.880]  800 years later the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere has risen
[1:22:53.880 --> 1:22:58.040]  so there's absolutely no relationship and if we look further back in time
[1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:01.560]  we can see that we've had six great ice ages
[1:23:01.560 --> 1:23:04.680]  two of these were at sea level at the equator
[1:23:04.680 --> 1:23:09.080]  and five that the six had the atmospheric carbon dioxide content
[1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:12.520]  much much higher up to a thousand times higher than now
[1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:17.000]  so there is no relationship no matter what times you look at
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:21.400]  carbon dioxide is a two-bit player it's a follower but it doesn't drive climate
[1:23:21.400 --> 1:23:27.720]  change doctor from your research have you found
[1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:31.400]  because this is what i found that the establishment knows carbon dioxide is
[1:23:31.400 --> 1:23:34.760]  part of the carbon cycle we have sunlight we have water we have carbon
[1:23:34.760 --> 1:23:37.720]  dioxide we have oxygen you got to have that there's no
[1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:41.400]  life on this planet well that they cynically
[1:23:41.400 --> 1:23:45.000]  that they cynically chose carbon dioxide as a way to
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:49.240]  tax and regulate all human activity well yes
[1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:54.440]  very much so it's a tax on thin air and the governments have been trying to
[1:23:54.440 --> 1:23:58.360]  tax us for all sorts of things for a very long period of time
[1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:02.360]  so now we're going to have a tax on cows
[1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:07.000]  farting and belching we humans are having a tax on carbon dioxide
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:10.760]  we're going to be taxed for everything ultimately we will be taxed for how
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:16.520]  quickly our fingernails grow and that's not just you saying that
[1:24:16.520 --> 1:24:19.880]  under obama's law he's trying to pass to get us lined up
[1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:23.480]  for this global treaty they're now admitting it's going to tax sheep
[1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:29.400]  cows pigs chickens taxes on having more than one child
[1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:33.480]  well very much so in in your country your proposed
[1:24:33.480 --> 1:24:37.400]  cap and trade is actually fairly mild compared with what
[1:24:37.400 --> 1:24:40.920]  the government of australia has tried to do and their tax will
[1:24:40.920 --> 1:24:45.160]  send everyone broke it will send all of the agricultural industries broke
[1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:48.600]  the mining industries the smelting industries the agricultural
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:52.920]  and manufacturing industries just will move to somewhere else
[1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:57.800]  so this is a wonderful mechanism of increasing the bureaucracy
[1:24:57.800 --> 1:25:01.960]  having more people in government counting everything we do and controlling our
[1:25:01.960 --> 1:25:08.840]  life this is i think the ultimate aim of government to control us
[1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:12.120]  it really is a stroke of genius though in the club of rome
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:15.240]  back in the 60s first put forward the white papers
[1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:19.480]  to western governments from australia to Canada to the united states in england
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:24.840]  germany to tax air the current head of the council on foreign relations
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:30.200]  richard and haas wrote in 92 that it was the perfect thing to make humans the
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:33.800]  enemy and the state waging war against humanity
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:37.160]  very cold-blooded quotes by these people
[1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:40.200]  when you research them and wrote your book about them you talk about how it's
[1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:44.360]  their religion from your research doctor what is their religion
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:47.800]  at its foundations my research really shows that it's a form of
[1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:53.800]  neo uh eugenics well it's a form of religion in my
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:57.720]  view that has replaced filed western socialism
[1:25:57.720 --> 1:26:02.520]  it's replaced failed western christianity it's a religion that's based
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:07.000]  out of the cities it's an urban atheistic religion
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:10.760]  these are people who claim that they're environmentalists if they have
[1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:14.280]  absolutely no contact whatsoever with nature
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:20.360]  they never ever go bush they never plant crops they don't know where the food
[1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:23.320]  comes from they don't know where the electricity comes from
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:27.720]  and they get all of the information off the internet or off a screen
[1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:31.000]  so we have a total disconnect of these people
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:38.360]  who have the strong body of voting power governments listen to them and those
[1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:42.040]  people based in basements in buildings all over the country
[1:26:42.040 --> 1:26:46.440]  are those who control what we should think what we should eat
[1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:50.360]  how much energy we should use and i argue that these people are taking our
[1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:54.200]  freedoms from us well you're absolutely right
[1:26:54.200 --> 1:26:57.800]  have you heard about the recent book that got a lot of attention it's actually
[1:26:57.800 --> 1:27:02.120]  a compendium or a government proposal white paper
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:05.320]  written with government and foundation funding eco science
[1:27:05.320 --> 1:27:10.280]  by john p holdren the white house science are
[1:27:10.280 --> 1:27:14.040]  that really admits that environmentalism is just
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:18.360]  eugenics and calls for a planetary government to reduce the population by
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:23.000]  75 percent and calls for destroying the industrial base
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:27.240]  yes i'm very much aware of holdren's work um previous to his government
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:30.280]  position now i'm very much aware of his views
[1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:33.720]  and i i think this is something we should be very very careful about
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:37.240]  about because to embrace environmentalism is
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:42.600]  in many ways to actually keep the third world in its third world state to keep
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:46.840]  people dying in the third world to stop them using modern genetic
[1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:50.040]  engineering to stop them using modern power systems
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:54.040]  and we have to remember that half of the third world don't have running water
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:57.720]  and don't have electricity and when we look at some of the other great
[1:27:57.720 --> 1:28:01.720]  political movements of the past we saw the rise of national socialism
[1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:05.640]  in europe from a green movement that's where it came from
[1:28:05.640 --> 1:28:09.720]  it wasn't a right wing movement at all so there are some rather frightening
[1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:15.000]  parallels in history and this is why i use a lot of history in my book
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:21.400]  that's um recently come out because we learned so much from history
[1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:26.040]  absolutely i have uh read large sections of your book haven't gotten through all
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:29.480]  of it yet with time but i have to say i learned a lot but i've
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:32.920]  also confirmed a lot of separate research i've done in my film
[1:28:32.920 --> 1:28:37.320]  endgame blueprint for global enslavement that's exactly what i found
[1:28:37.320 --> 1:28:41.080]  i thought i knew history about hitler but they don't really teach he was a
[1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:45.720]  vegetarian environmentalist who believed he needed to kill the majority of the
[1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:50.760]  world to save the earth uh all for racial hygiene

[1:33:17.320 --> 1:33:20.520]  excited about that folks can get it at amazon.com in different parts of the
[1:33:20.520 --> 1:33:23.640]  world and we'll tell you more about the book
[1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:27.240]  before he leaves us in the final segment
[1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:31.640]  but the book is heaven and earth global warming the missing science
[1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:34.840]  sir i want to let you get into points you want to cover i mean i'm throwing out
[1:33:34.840 --> 1:33:38.200]  questions here but you really are more and more as i research this one of the
[1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:41.080]  leading experts and also one of the most articulate
[1:33:41.080 --> 1:33:44.600]  and informed people on the whole spectrum of what this movement is
[1:33:44.600 --> 1:33:47.480]  the tens of thousands of the scientists per country
[1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:51.640]  the vast majority that say man may global warming is a fraud and a sham
[1:33:51.640 --> 1:33:56.200]  they mainly argue about the science all day and you also go over that but
[1:33:56.200 --> 1:34:00.600]  the political nature the the enslavement the total
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:05.400]  controlling of the environment and all industry the religious nature
[1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:09.000]  of it it's really the religion of control freaks
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:12.120]  in my opinion but i've got one question and i want to give you the floor and
[1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:15.640]  have you go over whatever facets you wish while we have you here today and we're
[1:34:15.640 --> 1:34:19.000]  very thankful when you go and debate them on tv
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:23.160]  and radio and print uh how do they treat you
[1:34:23.160 --> 1:34:27.000]  before you go out on the stage and argue with them uh because
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:29.800]  it describes in some of these newspaper articles that they're actually
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:34.520]  very mad at you and uh saying that uh you're some type of heretic and
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:38.200]  we see news articles not just calling for you to get in trouble but
[1:34:38.200 --> 1:34:42.520]  for other people to be arrested or fined for climate denial
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:48.120]  so we also see this stylistic attempt to silence free speech
[1:34:48.120 --> 1:34:52.680]  well i think that's a worldwide phenomenon and worldwide
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:57.720]  we are having the media the newspapers radio programs and
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:01.400]  environmentalists suggest that people should be arrested for having a
[1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:05.080]  contrary view they are demonizing dissent
[1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:09.160]  they are arguing that this view is against humanity
[1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:13.080]  yet no one wants to stand up in public and argue
[1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:17.720]  evidence with me and my scientific view is married to evidence
[1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:21.080]  it's not married to dogma
[1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:24.280]  continue
[1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:31.240]  mr. plumber yes i'm having real difficulty hearing you
[1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:34.840]  well you are uh how many thousands of miles away are you from the middle of
[1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:38.040]  the united states is it 10 000 12 000
[1:35:38.040 --> 1:35:42.680]  probably probably be 10 000 miles away i can now hear you so you
[1:35:42.680 --> 1:35:47.080]  must be shouting remember i'm talking uphill you're talking down
[1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:51.080]  hey it's a miracle it's you know i'm still one of these guys that thinks it's
[1:35:51.080 --> 1:35:54.920]  neat to be able to put plates in a dishwasher i'm somebody who's still
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:58.840]  you know i mean even though i'm pretty young i enjoy the modern conveniences
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:04.680]  of a car or a lawnmower or uh high-tech thing so i'm
[1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:08.840]  very pleased that your phone sounds so good uh from
[1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:12.200]  australia but to continue sir along that line of thinking
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:15.880]  well i'm very pleased to be able to eat hot food
[1:36:15.880 --> 1:36:19.560]  to be able to have a hot shower to be able to keep my house air conditioned
[1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:23.560]  in summertime to keep it air conditioned and warm in winter
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:27.480]  time to be able to travel by airplane or by car
[1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:30.920]  don't keep me the good old days because they weren't
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:34.680]  and our modern environmental movement wants to
[1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:38.920]  get all the information off television which uses a huge amount of energy
[1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:42.920]  yet they want to deny us a modern life that in my language is
[1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:46.600]  hypocrisy so don't give me the good old days
[1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:51.400]  they weren't it is not a sin to be wealthy it's not a sin to be comfortable
[1:36:51.400 --> 1:36:55.560]  it's not a sin to eat well i think it is a sin to take away someone's
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:59.880]  employment and this is where the environmental movement is going
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:03.640]  well as you said doctor if you go back and look at the royal commission on
[1:37:03.640 --> 1:37:07.960]  population 49 state department random 200
[1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:13.400]  it states that they the western powers wanted to freeze the development of the
[1:37:13.400 --> 1:37:17.080]  third world as a part of a hegemonic domination
[1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:21.080]  so whereas in the streets the modern yuppie it is a religion
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:24.520]  uh they're disconnected from reality and fools
[1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:28.600]  the the the progenitors of this carbon tax and carbon
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:33.240]  tyranny cold-bloodily know that they're going to kill billions of people in the
[1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:36.440]  third world in the aggregate they know it's going to freeze
[1:37:36.440 --> 1:37:40.040]  development they know it is a vertical integration
[1:37:40.040 --> 1:37:44.040]  of the entire economy i mean have you ever had one of these guys admit that
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:46.040]  to you because you can read it in some of their books
[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:50.680]  well they they have often argue about population as if it's a bad thing
[1:37:50.680 --> 1:37:54.600]  the greatest and the easiest way to reduce global population
[1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:58.520]  is to make everyone wealthy and that means in the third world you won't
[1:37:58.520 --> 1:38:03.080]  want to have 13 children hoping that one will keep you alive in your old age
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:07.960]  and i argue very strongly in the last chapter of my book heaven and earth
[1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:12.280]  that in fact the current views of the environmental movement
[1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:15.960]  are actually those views of killing people they
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:19.800]  get very uneasy when i challenge them on this point
[1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:23.400]  and they have no solution to global population they will never mention the
[1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:26.440]  word that is in their mind and that is genocide
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:29.160]  so i think we're dealing with some people who are
[1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:34.280]  chronically unbalanced yet they have the power of the airwaves and it's
[1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:39.160]  only a few conservative newspapers and television and radio networks that
[1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:44.200]  raise the contrary view and raise it fearlessly
[1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:48.680]  now tell us about the website brave new climate dot com is that a good site to
[1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:53.160]  visit to read your material doctor well there's there's many sites out there
[1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:57.240]  um brave new climate is is is one of the numerous sites
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:01.480]  um i'm fairly reticent to look at websites and blog sites because
[1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:05.400]  most of them are not edited and blogs often are
[1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:09.160]  done by people who are a little bit unbalanced i try to get my
[1:39:09.160 --> 1:39:12.760]  my knowledge from reading literature that is refereed
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:16.680]  and has gone through the referee process and we hear with this current
[1:39:16.680 --> 1:39:20.200]  global warming hysteria that there is no
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:24.440]  refereed literature out there saying the contrary view well that's just rubbish
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:28.600]  i have 2311 footnotes in my book heaven and earth
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:33.240]  that is from the major literature like science and nature and the major journals
[1:39:33.240 --> 1:39:36.520]  and if you dig deep into the scientific literature
[1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:40.840]  there's a huge amount of contrary information it just doesn't
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:45.160]  reach the airwaves and the reason i put out the book heaven and earth
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:49.160]  was to start the debate and to give the average person the confidence
[1:39:49.160 --> 1:39:52.280]  that there's a huge amount of science out there that gives an
[1:39:52.280 --> 1:39:56.600]  absolutely entirely different view well dr plumber i'll tell you what shuts
[1:39:56.600 --> 1:40:00.280]  down your average yuppie who's part of the eugenics death
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:04.200]  cult known as a modern environmentalism i say why
[1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:08.040]  were the ice caps on mars getting smaller and now that the sun has
[1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:11.480]  cooled off its activity the last few years they're getting bigger
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:16.280]  again wire moons of saturn and jupiter that were frozen methane and other
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:19.160]  gases why did they become liquid in areas
[1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:24.040]  is your suv causing a solar system wide warming
[1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:28.440]  and then you show them the evidence and they go oh my gosh
[1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:33.160]  obviously the sun is what heats things up and the sun is a good thing
[1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:36.440]  as you said during um you know roman times
[1:40:36.440 --> 1:40:41.080]  kind of at the end of the uh the last big warming period was the hybrion maxim
[1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:45.400]  or whatever they call it uh that uh you had grapes being grown
[1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:49.480]  in in in central england when you can't grow them there today i mean
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:54.920]  warming is a good thing but regardless uh they're trying to list carbon dioxide
[1:40:54.920 --> 1:40:59.240]  as a toxic waste and i found that most adults don't know that plants
[1:40:59.240 --> 1:41:03.480]  breathe carbon dioxide doctor well that's very much the case and for
[1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:07.640]  thousands of years various civilizations have known that the sun
[1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:11.800]  is the bringer of life the egyptians had their sun gods
[1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:17.000]  the mayans and other groups in central and southern america had their sun gods
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:20.920]  we have known that the sun drives photosynthesis
[1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:24.920]  this is the process where we take carbon dioxide out of the air
[1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:28.840]  and put it into plants those plants we ultimately eat
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:33.880]  carbon dioxide is not a toxin it's not a poison it's not a pollutant
[1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:38.680]  it is the key to life none of us want pollution of the atmosphere
[1:41:38.680 --> 1:41:42.920]  the soils and the waterways by particles and dangerous chemicals
[1:41:42.920 --> 1:41:46.920]  but carbon dioxide is plant food it drives the world
[1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:50.760]  now we can see that you gave examples from in our solar system of
[1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:54.680]  global warming driven by the sun we can look at other stars
[1:41:54.680 --> 1:41:58.760]  outside our solar system and look at those planets and we also see
[1:41:58.760 --> 1:42:02.520]  that there's a change in the amount of energy that these stars give out and
[1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:06.520]  that this gives us global warming in other solar systems
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:10.600]  so to me it's absolutely bizarre that that great
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:15.240]  hot mess in the sky that we call the sun that we ignore that
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:19.960]  is the driver of climate because the sun has always been the driver of life
[1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:24.840]  and of course the driver of climate uh doctor have you ever
[1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:31.400]  a thought of the angle that there's a lot of serious environmental stuff that
[1:42:31.400 --> 1:42:34.600]  is going on as you just said a lot of toxic waste dumping
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:38.840]  a pollution things like that but that by making the whole environmental movement
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:41.880]  about carbon it actually becomes a distraction
[1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:46.040]  from real environmental problems we have oh very much so look it's put back the
[1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:49.160]  real environmental problems by at least 50 years
[1:42:49.160 --> 1:42:54.680]  and that kills people absolutely wow let's come back and talk more about the
[1:42:54.680 --> 1:43:00.440]  book and more about hitler the first big environmentalist stay with us
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:03.880]  this is alex jones have you heard of the millionaire patriot

[1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:10.040]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:44:10.040 --> 1:44:14.520]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:17.960]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:21.000]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:24.600]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:27.480]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:44:27.480 --> 1:44:31.080]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:44:31.080 --> 1:44:34.120]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:44:34.120 --> 1:44:37.320]  outages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:40.840]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[1:44:40.840 --> 1:44:44.200]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science a long time

[1:46:06.440 --> 1:46:10.120]  in a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor
[1:46:10.120 --> 1:46:14.200]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal
[1:46:14.200 --> 1:46:17.400]  drinking water many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:20.520]  reproductive immune and developmental system diseases
[1:46:20.520 --> 1:46:24.280]  now what are you going to do about it the acola blue atmospheric water

[1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:08.200]  show with dr ian plumber uh doctor uh
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:11.800]  you talked about hitler the environmentalist hitler who had to
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:15.000]  clean the earth of the scourge of humanity and we see all these other
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:19.160]  scientists and people and ted turner and prince philip
[1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:23.960]  if you go to an elite cocktail party you know with even elite academia
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:27.000]  this is they all come and say what do you think about the people bomb
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:31.400]  i mean when i was going to college that was happening even the wannabe elites
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:36.360]  uh are into this this really is their control freak religion can you
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:39.560]  elaborate more about what you discovered what you cover in your book
[1:48:39.560 --> 1:48:43.800]  about their mindset and then finally we're beginning to gain ground it appears
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:46.120]  to me against them and they are starting to throw
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:50.200]  fits and get more and more aggressive uh how do you see them trying to shut us
[1:48:50.200 --> 1:48:53.000]  up and how do you see this battle playing out
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:56.200]  well it was interesting your opening piece of music there was from the
[1:48:56.200 --> 1:49:01.080]  barker the hard part that was uh hitler's great hero
[1:49:01.080 --> 1:49:05.240]  and the barker was involved in the 1848 revolution
[1:49:05.240 --> 1:49:09.320]  in europe he was actually banned he was actually
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:12.680]  involved in a revolution against government
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:17.160]  and that led to massive immigration of the intellectuals from europe to
[1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:19.880]  countries like the united states to australia
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:24.360]  europe lost its great people due to that revolution that barker was in
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:29.400]  and yet hitler used barker who had totally different ideas
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:34.200]  as his hero and the interesting thing was that hitler was also a vegetarian
[1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:37.480]  and when we look back in the geological record
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:41.880]  we've had human evolution has been very much driven by climate and
[1:49:41.880 --> 1:49:47.000]  every time the climate has got cold the vegetarians have become extinct
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:51.080]  so there is a god in heaven after all
[1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:56.120]  we see some very interesting parallels and we see many many
[1:49:56.120 --> 1:50:02.040]  totalitarian governments that have views um based on the environment in
[1:50:02.040 --> 1:50:06.440]  china we had marxitong's views where we had community health
[1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:10.280]  which was driven by government where we had community environmental
[1:50:10.280 --> 1:50:13.880]  programs so we've seen this throughout history hitler wasn't the
[1:50:13.880 --> 1:50:17.560]  only one we've seen it in the soviet union where they
[1:50:17.560 --> 1:50:23.800]  took one line of science from lysenko who claimed that oh no we can't have
[1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:27.800]  genetics operating because uh this means it's rather like a
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:32.200]  capitalist system so he invented a type of genetics which
[1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:36.600]  created starvation and about 30 million people died
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:43.160]  and i was in the soviet union in 1977 i drove across from the northern part of
[1:50:43.160 --> 1:50:46.760]  the soviet union into finland exactly the same climate
[1:50:46.760 --> 1:50:51.880]  exactly the same soils but the wheat was about three times higher in finland
[1:50:51.880 --> 1:50:56.680]  so we've seen this many many times before people trying to put a political spin
[1:50:56.680 --> 1:51:00.920]  on the way in which we think the way in which we eat and the way in which we
[1:51:00.920 --> 1:51:04.360]  travel so i think we are going in considerable
[1:51:04.360 --> 1:51:07.880]  ground and as i predicted in the last chapter in heaven and earth but as soon
[1:51:07.880 --> 1:51:11.560]  as we start to bring up argument for which there's no answer
[1:51:11.560 --> 1:51:15.320]  people attack us so i've had merciless attacking by
[1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:19.000]  newspapers by the bdc by the australian broadcast
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:23.320]  incorporation they keep attacking me but they don't argue the science
[1:51:23.320 --> 1:51:27.720]  and as for going to elite cocktail parties i have much better things to do
[1:51:27.720 --> 1:51:31.080]  with my time well by elite cocktail parties
[1:51:31.080 --> 1:51:35.000]  anytime i was in college anytime i've been around wealthy people
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:38.760]  anytime i've read either it's just it's all they seem to talk about
[1:51:38.760 --> 1:51:42.520]  uh is how they want to get rid of people and how the general public or
[1:51:42.520 --> 1:51:46.920]  rabble scum and uh how the earth is dying and the people
[1:51:46.920 --> 1:51:51.000]  bomb i mean in college didn't matter if it was math class history class
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:56.520]  psychology anthropology every professor i had except for an art
[1:51:56.520 --> 1:52:00.280]  class i took came in during the school and said there's
[1:52:00.280 --> 1:52:03.640]  too many people we've got to have one child policies
[1:52:03.640 --> 1:52:08.120]  and yes yes very much so and i mean this is why i'm spending a weekend here in
[1:52:08.120 --> 1:52:12.200]  a mining town this is the mining town in the middle of the desert
[1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:15.720]  these are real people that they could think
[1:52:15.720 --> 1:52:19.400]  they're not stupid and they're getting treated by the government as being
[1:52:19.400 --> 1:52:23.640]  stupid they're getting treated by academics and
[1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:27.880]  scientists as being stupid i really enjoy being in
[1:52:27.880 --> 1:52:32.360]  rural areas agricultural areas and mining areas because these are the real
[1:52:32.360 --> 1:52:35.880]  people and these are feeling totally disenfranchised
[1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:39.480]  by the arrogance coming out of many of the college professors
[1:52:39.480 --> 1:52:43.480]  the arrogance of government doctor uh going back to
[1:52:43.480 --> 1:52:47.880]  moussey tongue uh in fact his cultural revolution
[1:52:47.880 --> 1:52:53.000]  greatly forward it was eugenics based and then in the mid 70s the united
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  states and the un and england funded china to set up the one child policy
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:02.920]  and if people have noticed china is now embracing
[1:53:02.920 --> 1:53:06.680]  the selective carbon taxes and people are shocked by that
[1:53:06.680 --> 1:53:10.200]  how how is the establishment able to sell this
[1:53:10.200 --> 1:53:13.400]  to the chinese communist or is it just that communism
[1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:19.880]  believes in this vertical integration so they like it because it's a pretext
[1:53:19.880 --> 1:53:23.880]  to take control well in china for thousands of years it's been a
[1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:27.800]  centrally controlled empire we can't use the word
[1:53:27.800 --> 1:53:32.760]  government and china in the one sentence and that control is on everything
[1:53:32.760 --> 1:53:35.880]  what you plant where how many children you have
[1:53:35.880 --> 1:53:38.920]  and the way you think now the chinese government
[1:53:38.920 --> 1:53:42.680]  is embracing uh carbon and carbon trading
[1:53:42.680 --> 1:53:46.840]  which they will never put into practice and the reason for that is that
[1:53:46.840 --> 1:53:51.080]  the great beneficiary of all of the carbon
[1:53:51.080 --> 1:53:55.400]  cap and trade carbon trading the great beneficiary is going to be china
[1:53:55.400 --> 1:53:59.080]  we are basically going to be shifting huge amounts of money
[1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:04.040]  from the western world into china that's why they're saying they embrace it and
[1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:07.880]  we are doing so many stupid things that the chinese must be laughing
[1:54:07.880 --> 1:54:13.320]  for example we've had to earth our for an hour on this planet a billion people
[1:54:13.320 --> 1:54:17.480]  turned off their lights but the power stations have to keep ticking over
[1:54:17.480 --> 1:54:21.320]  and what happened was that these people were thinking now we'll put less carbon
[1:54:21.320 --> 1:54:26.760]  dioxide in the atmosphere in that hour what they did was that their
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:30.680]  decrease in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was equivalent to six
[1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:34.360]  seconds of china's emissions into the atmosphere
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:37.720]  so we're seeing these religious exercises in futility
[1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:43.800]  we are giving all the power all the trade all the wealth to china well doctor
[1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:48.520]  you just said it they they know it's a ritual
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:53.080]  to use the paper bag they know or the cloth bag they know it's a ritual
[1:54:53.080 --> 1:54:58.280]  to have you submit to them it's like it's a ritual to take your shoes off and
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:00.680]  be searched at the airport to be trained to be a slave
[1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:05.000]  enron got caught turning the power off a few hours a day in california
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:08.760]  their internal documents came out saying if we turn the power off
[1:55:08.760 --> 1:55:13.400]  they'll accept a tripling in power cost we're creating artificial scarcity
[1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:16.040]  and so the social engineers cold-bloodily know
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:20.040]  making everybody turn their lights off or the turning the rifle tower off
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:25.000]  is a symbol it's a mind control it's a jim jones programming
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:29.480]  that energy is bad and living is bad and having something is bad and so
[1:55:29.480 --> 1:55:32.680]  you can give it to the government and then all the promoters of the
[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:37.480]  environmental cult they have four or five kids 1015 jet airplanes
[1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:41.320]  palaces their carbon footprints are bigger than anybody's
[1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:44.600]  well very much so and i think governments
[1:55:44.600 --> 1:55:48.600]  really have to understand that energy drives the economy
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:52.280]  the more energy we have the cheaper the economy
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:57.080]  uh become the more energy we have the more jobs we create
[1:55:57.080 --> 1:56:01.400]  if we add costs to energy we are putting people out of work
[1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:04.600]  and if they're out of work we can control them even more
[1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:08.600]  and it only then becomes the elite who have a lot of money
[1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:11.480]  or those few people lucky enough to have a job
[1:56:11.480 --> 1:56:15.560]  that keep the wheels of the economy spinning but i see that this is a process
[1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:19.880]  where we've got massive health care costs where we've got controls on the way we
[1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:25.400]  think the way we write this is just another way of putting handcuffs on us
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:29.080]  well i hope to have you back up uh sometime during the weekday show so
[1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:33.160]  that audience can hear you doctor uh just amazing the book is heaven and
[1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:37.000]  earth global warming the missing science and closing
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:41.560]  they do appear to be now uh their facade of invincibility is breaking
[1:56:41.560 --> 1:56:46.120]  the their hoax is beginning to be exposed but uh they've got the the
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:50.120]  governments behind them so i think the fight the fight is just beginning
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:53.240]  i would just hope that you and other prominent people as you've been doing
[1:56:53.240 --> 1:56:56.440]  would just dispense with even arguing with these people and say look
[1:56:56.440 --> 1:56:59.880]  we know you're elitist control freak eugenicist and that you just want to
[1:56:59.880 --> 1:57:03.640]  kill the majority of the planet because we have the hundreds of quotes from
[1:57:03.640 --> 1:57:07.640]  i mean i i think it's really time to even turn the heat up on these bastards
[1:57:07.640 --> 1:57:10.920]  even more well i agree and they talk about opening
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:13.720]  their minds my problem is that they've opened their brain so much that the
[1:57:13.720 --> 1:57:17.960]  brains have fallen out all right uh doctor
