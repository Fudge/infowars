[00:00.000 --> 00:04.380]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that
[00:04.380 --> 00:07.240]  is a really, really awful situation.
[00:07.240 --> 00:09.500]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:09.500 --> 00:14.740]  We love the American people.
[00:14.740 --> 00:24.320]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:24.320 --> 00:25.820]  We love the American people.
[00:25.820 --> 00:27.820]  We love the American people.
[00:28.820 --> 00:30.820]  We love the American people.
[00:30.820 --> 00:32.820]  They came in peace.
[00:44.820 --> 00:48.820]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people.
[00:48.820 --> 00:50.820]  This is CNN.
[01:01.820 --> 01:05.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:09.820 --> 01:12.820]  I have the greatest supporters in the world.
[01:12.820 --> 01:15.820]  By the way, they're the smartest. They're the hardest working.
[01:15.820 --> 01:19.820]  They pay taxes. They're incredible. They're loyal.
[01:19.820 --> 01:24.820]  I have the bikers. I have the construction workers.
[01:24.820 --> 01:26.820]  I have them all.
[01:26.820 --> 01:28.820]  By the way, I have the FBI.
[01:28.820 --> 01:31.820]  You go into the FBI and take a poll of the real FBI.
[01:31.820 --> 01:34.820]  Not the scum on top. Not Comey and that group of people.
[01:34.820 --> 01:36.820]  Most of those are gone.
[01:36.820 --> 01:39.820]  Well, I don't know how Peter Strock is still working there, to be honest with you.
[01:39.820 --> 01:41.820]  He's working in HR.
[01:41.820 --> 01:43.820]  That's even worse.
[01:43.820 --> 01:50.820]  We are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[01:54.820 --> 01:58.820]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[01:58.820 --> 02:01.820]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:01.820 --> 02:06.820]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[02:06.820 --> 02:12.820]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend
[02:12.820 --> 02:14.820]  in office.
[02:18.820 --> 02:24.820]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[02:24.820 --> 02:30.820]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[02:30.820 --> 02:34.820]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[02:34.820 --> 02:39.820]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[02:39.820 --> 02:45.820]  From the front lines of the Info World, it's Alex Jones.
[02:50.820 --> 02:56.820]  And here we are a year and a half later, and Trump has miraculously been delivering.
[02:56.820 --> 02:59.820]  I did a little happy birthday live feed last night.
[02:59.820 --> 03:03.820]  So I hadn't really done a happy birthday for the president during my four hours. I did.
[03:03.820 --> 03:07.820]  And I noticed some of the comments on YouTube and on Info Wars were like,
[03:07.820 --> 03:09.820]  oh, grovel to President Trump.
[03:09.820 --> 03:13.820]  Can you get your head any further up his rear end?
[03:13.820 --> 03:17.820]  I love the instant gratification society.
[03:17.820 --> 03:20.820]  We almost had Hillary, and the total shutdown of America was planned.
[03:20.820 --> 03:23.820]  They thought they had us in the back.
[03:23.820 --> 03:33.820]  Then we got Trump, and he has miraculously, like he has a magic wand or something,
[03:33.820 --> 03:37.820]  turned things around, and you can see it's getting so much better,
[03:37.820 --> 03:39.820]  and the globalists are so upset.
[03:39.820 --> 03:42.820]  And, you know, I'm risking my life, my name, my treasure.
[03:42.820 --> 03:44.820]  I'm under massive attack for this.
[03:44.820 --> 03:46.820]  So let me tell you something.
[03:46.820 --> 03:52.820]  It makes it even more valuable to me, and quite frankly, I shaver it.
[03:52.820 --> 03:57.820]  That we're rolling back the abortion garbage.
[03:57.820 --> 04:02.820]  That we're rolling back the death mills, euthanizing the veterans with a death list.
[04:02.820 --> 04:04.820]  That we're rolling back the completely open borders.
[04:04.820 --> 04:06.820]  That we're rolling back Hollywood.
[04:06.820 --> 04:10.820]  That everything in the system is falling apart.
[04:10.820 --> 04:13.820]  And the American system's coming back, and to see the big peace deals.
[04:13.820 --> 04:17.820]  And historic ceasefire now in Afghanistan.
[04:17.820 --> 04:21.820]  Trump knows the globalists wanted to keep all these crises and wars and things going forever.
[04:21.820 --> 04:27.820]  That's why everything's turning so quickly, because he's pragmatically going in and changing it.
[04:27.820 --> 04:33.820]  So, yeah, I've risked my life, and my name, and my treasure, and my honor to try to turn things around.
[04:33.820 --> 04:36.820]  And when I see it turning around, I get tears in my eyes.
[04:36.820 --> 04:39.820]  And then, you know, Trump is doing such a great job.
[04:39.820 --> 04:42.820]  Yeah, I got mad at him about some of the things he's done that I disagree with.
[04:42.820 --> 04:45.820]  But overall, he's doing a great job, and we're blessed.
[04:45.820 --> 04:52.820]  And so I'm very thankful to God, for you, and for Trump, and for my family, and this crew.
[04:52.820 --> 04:54.820]  I mean, we are witnessing history.
[04:54.820 --> 04:58.820]  If we're successful, humanity's got a real shot at the future.
[05:25.820 --> 05:30.820]  When paired with carnivore, our incredible enzyme formula that helps you break down nutrients,

[05:54.820 --> 06:20.820]  Try the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack today.
[06:24.820 --> 06:33.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have Roger Stone riding shotgun with us in the second and third hour.
[06:33.820 --> 06:39.820]  We have the spokesman for Tommy Robinson, Kaelin, Robertson joining us.
[06:39.820 --> 06:48.820]  He gave us the exclusive intel on Tuesday that Tommy had been taken to a high-security prison, 71% Muslim.
[06:48.820 --> 06:52.820]  Despite the fact that lawyers and people were telling him not to go on air, Tommy told him to.
[06:52.820 --> 06:58.820]  And for a day, I saw disinfo articles and comments online saying, Jones made this up.
[06:58.820 --> 07:03.820]  Kind of like they ordered no reporting of Tommy Robinson the first two days he was arrested.
[07:03.820 --> 07:10.820]  And they arrested him for just reporting that there was a trial of Muslims for giant pedophile rings going on.
[07:10.820 --> 07:14.820]  That's how they work it in England.
[07:14.820 --> 07:21.820]  And now it's in the British news today.
[07:21.820 --> 07:31.820]  Three, four days after we broke it that indeed he was taken to a maximum security prison.
[07:31.820 --> 07:33.820]  We just said high security.
[07:33.820 --> 07:36.820]  And that he was put in the Muslim wing.
[07:36.820 --> 07:41.820]  They're spending it going, Jones and others said it was a 71% Muslim prison.
[07:41.820 --> 07:43.820]  Well, that's what Tommy told him.
[07:43.820 --> 07:45.820]  No, no, it's worse than that.
[07:45.820 --> 07:48.820]  Tommy was stuck in the Muslim wing.
[07:48.820 --> 07:54.820]  So another arguing, oh, the prison's only half Muslim.
[07:54.820 --> 07:58.820]  The wing he was stuck in was 70 plus percent.
[07:58.820 --> 08:03.820]  So they play these games to always change the subject.
[08:03.820 --> 08:06.820]  But now it's all over the British news.
[08:06.820 --> 08:09.820]  Why is Tommy Robinson has already been attacked in prison before?
[08:09.820 --> 08:12.820]  They've got all these guys and exposed radical Islam being killed in prison.
[08:12.820 --> 08:15.820]  They got to put a piece of bacon on the front step.
[08:15.820 --> 08:19.820]  Got stabbed to death.
[08:19.820 --> 08:26.820]  So now we're having a debate about should he be killed in prison three days later.
[08:26.820 --> 08:30.820]  And that's what I deal with here.
[08:30.820 --> 08:32.820]  Let me just say this right now.
[08:32.820 --> 08:34.820]  And I got a call right before I went live.
[08:34.820 --> 08:36.820]  So I've got to call them back during the break.
[08:36.820 --> 08:46.820]  But I have multiple sources in and around Elon Musk, in and around Kanye West.
[08:46.820 --> 08:49.820]  And I've told you that Kanye West and Elon Musk are working together.
[08:49.820 --> 08:51.820]  I've told you they're working with Trump.
[08:51.820 --> 08:53.820]  The bad guys know that.
[08:53.820 --> 08:59.820]  But Elon Musk and Kanye West and others would Trump have a rollout of this,
[08:59.820 --> 09:02.820]  where then Kardashian comes down, Kim Kardashian.
[09:02.820 --> 09:07.820]  And then he signs a pardon for a black lady been in prison for 35 years
[09:07.820 --> 09:11.820]  on a nonviolent drug conviction.
[09:11.820 --> 09:14.820]  And then a bunch of leftist black organizations say,
[09:14.820 --> 09:15.820]  oh, you're not going to do anything.
[09:15.820 --> 09:16.820]  He said, really?
[09:16.820 --> 09:18.820]  Give me some legislation.
[09:18.820 --> 09:23.820]  I'm trying to put some together right now to end mandatory sentences that target blacks.
[09:23.820 --> 09:31.820]  I intend to have Congress pass a law removing what Clinton did in 1994.
[09:31.820 --> 09:35.820]  And the Jets football team that was running its mouth and the NAACP,
[09:35.820 --> 09:39.820]  they shut their mouths real fast.
[09:39.820 --> 09:44.820]  We're talking about hundreds of thousands of nonviolent black inmates
[09:44.820 --> 09:48.820]  who, because they were selling crack cocaine,
[09:48.820 --> 09:52.820]  you get three times the sentence for the same amount of powdered cocaine
[09:52.820 --> 09:56.820]  that's the rich white guy drug.
[09:56.820 --> 10:00.820]  And Trump is saying we're going to end that where Hillary called black people dogs
[10:00.820 --> 10:02.820]  that must be brought to heel.
[10:02.820 --> 10:04.820]  Oh, you want to see the video again?
[10:04.820 --> 10:07.820]  I don't like looking at her, hearing her voice.
[10:07.820 --> 10:10.820]  If you want to search engine it when Hillary called black people dogs
[10:10.820 --> 10:13.820]  and said bring them to heel and super predators.
[10:13.820 --> 10:15.820]  I can't look at her.
[10:15.820 --> 10:16.820]  I can't listen to it anymore.
[10:16.820 --> 10:17.820]  I'm serious.
[10:17.820 --> 10:19.820]  And it's not just because she's spouting racist stuff.
[10:19.820 --> 10:27.820]  She's such a disgusting hypocrite who then runs all this race baiting garbage.
[10:27.820 --> 10:33.820]  You want to go watch the clip from C-SPAN 1996.
[10:33.820 --> 10:34.820]  Now there it is.
[10:34.820 --> 10:36.820]  Get it off the screen.
[10:36.820 --> 10:38.820]  Oh, look, she's such a vampire.
[10:38.820 --> 10:40.820]  Oh my goodness.
[10:40.820 --> 10:42.820]  Just get her off, get her off.
[10:42.820 --> 10:44.820]  I've already seen the clip 200 times.
[10:44.820 --> 10:45.820]  I can't look at it.
[10:45.820 --> 10:48.820]  Hillary is triggering to me.
[10:48.820 --> 10:52.820]  She's got her official law firms suing me.
[10:52.820 --> 10:56.820]  They're financing all these demonization attacks on me.
[10:56.820 --> 10:58.820]  And I'm not stupid.
[10:58.820 --> 11:01.820]  But I've talked to high level people that are smarter than I am.
[11:01.820 --> 11:05.820]  They say 100% Alex, they're preparing the ground for you to be assassinated
[11:05.820 --> 11:10.820]  so that you're so demonized pre-assassination people buy it.
[11:10.820 --> 11:12.820]  I'm not stupid.
[11:12.820 --> 11:14.820]  They know they're going to lose all these lawsuits.
[11:14.820 --> 11:20.820]  They are preparing my public crucifixion and then execution.
[11:20.820 --> 11:22.820]  Doesn't matter they're going down.
[11:22.820 --> 11:23.820]  That's all that matters.
[11:23.820 --> 11:24.820]  I feel very satisfied quite frankly.
[11:24.820 --> 11:26.820]  I feel very good.
[11:26.820 --> 11:31.820]  But getting back to the whole Kanye West, Elon Musk situation.
[11:31.820 --> 11:35.820]  They've been trying to crash Elon Musk companies.
[11:35.820 --> 11:38.820]  All of them have been targeted.
[11:38.820 --> 11:43.820]  You notice the vessers to loan has come out in support of Trump.
[11:43.820 --> 11:48.820]  When he ran for president since so they have a woman from 1990.
[11:48.820 --> 11:55.820]  That's 28 years ago saying he raped her.
[11:55.820 --> 11:56.820]  Totally made up.
[11:56.820 --> 11:58.820]  That's what the Democrats do.
[11:58.820 --> 12:00.820]  Because I know people that know Sylvester Stallone.
[12:00.820 --> 12:02.820]  He's super nice to women.
[12:02.820 --> 12:04.820]  Spoils the hell out of them.
[12:04.820 --> 12:06.820]  I've worked out at his private gym.
[12:06.820 --> 12:09.820]  I've never met Stallone but I've worked out with his friends at his private gym.
[12:09.820 --> 12:10.820]  Up there he keeps his cars.
[12:10.820 --> 12:13.820]  He's got like a three story building in the middle of LA.
[12:13.820 --> 12:17.820]  And I know women that know him and it's absolute horse manure.
[12:17.820 --> 12:22.820]  Sylvester Stallone has a lot of courage folks to support Trump during the campaign.
[12:22.820 --> 12:26.820]  And now to support him and to be trying to get black folks out of prison.
[12:26.820 --> 12:28.820]  He's been spearheading that.
[12:28.820 --> 12:29.820]  And what does he get?
[12:29.820 --> 12:33.820]  Some made up 28 year thing when there's not even there's a statute of limitations in California.
[12:33.820 --> 12:38.820]  They passed a law now where there's not one that it's only active after 2017.
[12:38.820 --> 12:46.820]  So you got to ask why on earth would you even be seeing this?
[12:46.820 --> 12:52.820]  Why would the police put this announcement out there in Southern California to purely demonizing?
[12:52.820 --> 12:57.820]  And to smoke screen Weinstein where you've got his driver, his butler, his assistant saying yeah.
[12:57.820 --> 13:01.820]  He raped women basically every night.
[13:01.820 --> 13:03.820]  He weighs 280 pounds.
[13:03.820 --> 13:06.820]  He likes 95 pound women that look like they're 12 years old.
[13:06.820 --> 13:12.820]  He climbs on top of them and rapes them in the back of the limo.
[13:12.820 --> 13:17.820]  That those are real witnesses that those are real people that come forward.
[13:17.820 --> 13:25.820]  These are real indictments, not 28 years ago, but from a couple years ago.
[13:25.820 --> 13:30.820]  So that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:30.820 --> 13:35.820]  And I have experienced this.
[13:35.820 --> 13:39.820]  The main lawyers for the Clintons in California.
[13:39.820 --> 13:43.820]  Gary goes and Gary goes. Remember them? Michael Jackson's lawyers.
[13:43.820 --> 13:48.820]  Filed an EEOC thing on me that is total horse manure fiction.
[13:48.820 --> 13:52.820]  I wear swastika shoes.
[13:52.820 --> 13:54.820]  Total lie.
[13:54.820 --> 13:58.820]  I telepathically try to have gay sex with people.
[13:58.820 --> 14:03.820]  Bizarre.
[14:03.820 --> 14:07.820]  But people talk in Hollywood, people that were on the phone calls.
[14:07.820 --> 14:09.820]  So no weapon formed against the show prosper.
[14:09.820 --> 14:16.820]  But let me tell you, they mean business.
[14:16.820 --> 14:19.820]  That's the headline. Alex Jones, gay grooming.
[14:19.820 --> 14:22.820]  You read 10 pages into the 20 something page daily mail and it says,
[14:22.820 --> 14:26.820]  Jones never said anything sexual towards the male employee.
[14:26.820 --> 14:34.820]  But the male employee felt like Jones wanted to have sex with him.
[14:34.820 --> 14:39.820]  So see, I know what this feels like.
[14:39.820 --> 14:43.820]  And by the way, I know for a fact that Democratic Party has scoured
[14:43.820 --> 14:46.820]  with major bounties for anybody that will lie about me.
[14:46.820 --> 14:55.820]  But the good news is I have led such a pretty boring focused workaholic life
[14:55.820 --> 15:00.820]  that they, despite the fact that they put unbelievable amounts of money on the street
[15:00.820 --> 15:06.820]  and PIs and these slimy so-called reporters, they came up zero.
[15:06.820 --> 15:11.820]  Zero.
[15:11.820 --> 15:13.820]  So now what are they going to do?
[15:13.820 --> 15:16.820]  Just like I predicted, they had all the big labs test my supplements,
[15:16.820 --> 15:19.820]  come up totally clean.
[15:19.820 --> 15:21.820]  We know we're targets.
[15:21.820 --> 15:23.820]  We test our stuff to California standards.
[15:23.820 --> 15:25.820]  What happened next, huh?
[15:25.820 --> 15:28.820]  Wasn't hard to predict, was it?
[15:28.820 --> 15:34.820]  You can leave a can of supplements open in the open air in a parking garage
[15:34.820 --> 15:37.820]  for three seconds and it'll fail test after that.
[15:37.820 --> 15:39.820]  We had the stuff tested.
[15:39.820 --> 15:41.820]  They tested and said they found a little bit of lead in.
[15:41.820 --> 15:42.820]  Didn't have it.
[15:42.820 --> 15:43.820]  We had six labs tested.
[15:43.820 --> 15:45.820]  We're going to court.
[15:45.820 --> 15:47.820]  I had to countersuit.
[15:47.820 --> 15:50.820]  They're not playing games here, so I'm telling you.
[15:50.820 --> 15:51.820]  Gloves are off.
[15:51.820 --> 15:52.820]  Hey, our gloves are off with you.
[15:52.820 --> 15:53.820]  We come back.
[15:53.820 --> 15:57.820]  Trump's powerful announcement at the top of the FBI is led by criminal scum.
[15:57.820 --> 16:01.820]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.

[19:06.820 --> 19:09.820]  Hey, I've been following you since I was 14.
[19:09.820 --> 19:13.820]  I'm 32 now. I remember back when Infowars and Prison Planet
[19:13.820 --> 19:17.820]  it was just blue text on a white screen and it had to load down the page
[19:17.820 --> 19:20.820]  on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool
[19:20.820 --> 19:24.820]  and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests
[19:24.820 --> 19:28.820]  and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield
[19:28.820 --> 19:32.820]  and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman,
[19:32.820 --> 19:36.820]  the Real Red Pill, micro-ZX body. It's all amazing.
[19:36.820 --> 19:37.820]  Thank you, brother.
[19:37.820 --> 19:40.820]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much
[19:40.820 --> 19:43.820]  it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body,
[19:43.820 --> 19:47.820]  you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more you know God,
[19:47.820 --> 19:50.820]  the more you fear God but the more you chase God
[19:50.820 --> 19:53.820]  and I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you,
[19:53.820 --> 19:57.820]  the crew and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[20:02.820 --> 20:06.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:09.820 --> 20:13.820]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people
[20:13.820 --> 20:18.820]  and that is a really, really awful situation. We are not the enemy of the American people.
[20:18.820 --> 20:20.820]  We love the American people.
[20:31.820 --> 20:33.820]  We are not the enemy of the American people.

[20:58.820 --> 21:00.820]  This is CNN.
[21:11.820 --> 21:15.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[21:19.820 --> 21:21.820]  I have the greatest supporters in the world.
[21:21.820 --> 21:25.820]  By the way, they're the smartest. They're the hardest working.
[21:25.820 --> 21:29.820]  They pay taxes. They're incredible. They're loyal.
[21:29.820 --> 21:33.820]  I have the bikers. I have the construction workers.
[21:33.820 --> 21:35.820]  I have them all.
[21:35.820 --> 21:37.820]  By the way, I have the FBI.
[21:37.820 --> 21:40.820]  You go into the FBI and take a poll of the real FBI.
[21:40.820 --> 21:43.820]  Not the scum on top. Not Comey and that group of people.
[21:43.820 --> 21:45.820]  Most of those are gone.
[21:45.820 --> 21:49.820]  Well, I don't know how Peter Strock is still working there, to be honest with you.
[21:49.820 --> 21:51.820]  He's working in HR.
[21:51.820 --> 21:54.820]  I don't know where he is.
[22:00.820 --> 22:05.820]  Well, we've had time to beaver away through the 500 pages.
[22:05.820 --> 22:11.820]  499, excuse me, of actual pages and then a whole bunch of other appendixies.
[22:11.820 --> 22:13.820]  In the appendix.
[22:15.820 --> 22:17.820]  And it's incredible.
[22:17.820 --> 22:23.820]  Obama and his spokespersons lied to Congress and said that they never communicated with Hillary
[22:23.820 --> 22:26.820]  via the secret server email.
[22:29.820 --> 22:31.820]  It's funny how Trump keeps calling it a gang of 13.
[22:31.820 --> 22:35.820]  She communicated with 13 people on the server.
[22:38.820 --> 22:41.820]  We now know, according to the Inspector General report.
[22:41.820 --> 22:48.820]  And remember Richard Reeves during the campaign, early in the campaign.
[22:48.820 --> 22:51.820]  Our incredibly reporter.
[22:51.820 --> 22:58.820]  He asked Hillary, hey, we've got intel that your server was broken into by foreign governments.
[22:58.820 --> 23:00.820]  Let's let's cue that up.
[23:00.820 --> 23:07.820]  Informers reporter asked Hillary about her by foreign governments or about the hacking of her server was the headline early 2016.
[23:07.820 --> 23:12.820]  And she looks at images that's outrageous because we broke that with our sources.
[23:12.820 --> 23:18.820]  Colonel Schaefer with his high level Pentagon sources and the London group on this show.
[23:18.820 --> 23:23.820]  So the word was that she was dumping stuff on the server like a part bench.
[23:23.820 --> 23:28.820]  You know, in the old days, you'd go give the Chinese or the Russians or whoever you were selling the country out to.
[23:28.820 --> 23:34.820]  You put it in a park bench or you put it in a trash can and you put it in a McDonald's bag and throw it in the trash can.
[23:34.820 --> 23:42.820]  And somebody come along, get out of the trash can called a drop box drop site.
[23:42.820 --> 23:47.820]  We put under our own orange traffic cone or under a bush in a certain spot in the park.
[23:47.820 --> 23:50.820]  Well, the way you do it even better than that with plausible liability is.
[23:50.820 --> 23:57.820]  You just have tens of thousands of secret emails from the State Department that you send yourself to have on there.
[23:57.820 --> 24:03.820]  And then you let all these foreign governments kind of originate on it.
[24:03.820 --> 24:09.820]  That's on page 89 exhibit 75.
[24:09.820 --> 24:12.820]  We have it on screen for TV viewers.
[24:12.820 --> 24:26.820]  FBI analyst and prosecutor number two told us that former President Barack Obama was one of the 13 individuals within Clinton had direct contact.
[24:26.820 --> 24:30.820]  Using her Clinton dot com account.
[24:30.820 --> 24:40.820]  Clinton mail dot com account Obama like other high level government officials used a pseudonym for the username on his official government.
[24:40.820 --> 24:42.820]  Email account. Wow.
[24:42.820 --> 24:50.820]  So you've got them on secret legal servers using code names.
[24:50.820 --> 24:55.820]  You know, like when you rob a bank, you don't say, hey, I'm Alex Jones. I'm robbing the bank.
[24:55.820 --> 25:01.820]  You and your buddies go on there wearing, you know, President's mask or whatever you do. I'm bugsy and I'm Bob.
[25:01.820 --> 25:05.820]  And I'm lucky and you're going to be lucky if you hurry up, put that money in the bags.
[25:05.820 --> 25:10.820]  I don't splatter your brains all over the walls.
[25:10.820 --> 25:12.820]  And now it's all out.
[25:12.820 --> 25:14.820]  So can we look that up?
[25:14.820 --> 25:15.820]  Info wars.
[25:15.820 --> 25:18.820]  Ask Hillary about the hacking of her server.
[25:18.820 --> 25:19.820]  That's the headline.
[25:19.820 --> 25:25.820]  Early 2016, Richard Reeves is the report.
[25:25.820 --> 25:27.820]  People ask, where's Richard?
[25:27.820 --> 25:30.820]  Richard's been taking care of his 93 year old mother.
[25:30.820 --> 25:31.820]  And he's a great guy.
[25:31.820 --> 25:32.820]  And he's a private guy.
[25:32.820 --> 25:33.820]  I'll leave it at that.
[25:33.820 --> 25:36.820]  He had a heart attack.
[25:36.820 --> 25:37.820]  He's with us.
[25:37.820 --> 25:38.820]  He's been through a lot.
[25:38.820 --> 25:39.820]  Pray for Richard.
[25:39.820 --> 25:41.820]  That's where Richard's been for two years.
[25:41.820 --> 25:43.820]  I just get asked where's Richard Reeves all the time.
[25:43.820 --> 25:44.820]  So I just went and said it.
[25:44.820 --> 25:45.820]  So everybody knows.
[25:45.820 --> 25:48.820]  Yeah, yeah, let's get the audio of this queued up as soon as we can.
[25:48.820 --> 25:51.820]  Only has 89,000 views.
[25:51.820 --> 25:52.820]  And look, my memory is good.
[25:52.820 --> 25:56.820]  I said January 2016.
[25:56.820 --> 25:58.820]  I just told you early 2016.
[25:58.820 --> 26:04.820]  See, my memory is still on sometimes, but it used to be photographic.
[26:04.820 --> 26:05.820]  It was almost a curse though.
[26:05.820 --> 26:12.820]  But I guess drinking and getting old and stuff like that, missing your sleep, working hard.
[26:12.820 --> 26:14.820]  You kind of lose that magic.
[26:14.820 --> 26:18.820]  You start losing a lot of brain cells by about age 30, just naturally.
[26:18.820 --> 26:20.820]  But see photographic folks.
[26:20.820 --> 26:23.820]  Anyways, I am digressing.
[26:23.820 --> 26:27.820]  I have shadows of the old photographic memory.
[26:27.820 --> 26:33.820]  So we're going to get that clip in to the old tricaster in there and play that for you coming up the next segment.
[26:33.820 --> 26:36.820]  We post this to YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, which probably just add this onto the segment.
[26:36.820 --> 26:41.820]  But side issue, it's a big, big, big deal.
[26:41.820 --> 26:46.820]  And it's one more thing where you get next year's news today.
[26:46.820 --> 26:50.820]  Well, actually, that's the news of a year and a half from now today.
[26:50.820 --> 26:56.820]  And we also told you that Strach was running a whole ring-leading system to bring down the president and keep him from being elected.
[26:56.820 --> 26:58.820]  Now we have that word for word.
[26:58.820 --> 27:05.820]  And again, they all lied to Congress finally and related to nothing.
[27:05.820 --> 27:11.820]  But I just saw my first Bernie Sanders bumper sticker made me want to key the car.
[27:11.820 --> 27:13.820]  See, there's such worshipers of Hillary.
[27:13.820 --> 27:15.820]  He's an idiot like Trump.
[27:15.820 --> 27:18.820]  Figure they cancel each other out.
[27:18.820 --> 27:21.820]  No, Hillary canceled herself out.
[27:21.820 --> 27:25.820]  And as bad as Bernie is, he's no Hillary.
[27:25.820 --> 27:28.820]  Trump's not going to ever become president, right, right?
[27:28.820 --> 27:30.820]  August 8, 2016.
[27:30.820 --> 27:31.820]  No, no, he won't.
[27:31.820 --> 27:33.820]  We'll stop it.
[27:33.820 --> 27:35.820]  There's no need to fear.
[27:35.820 --> 27:39.820]  Peter's truck and his little girlfriend are here.
[27:39.820 --> 27:43.820]  We'll stand in the will of America, the voters.
[27:43.820 --> 27:46.820]  We'll call them Russians, yes.
[27:46.820 --> 27:52.820]  We'll call Roger Stone, Alex Jones, and Donald Trump and all these super patriots.
[27:52.820 --> 27:53.820]  What do we do?
[27:53.820 --> 27:55.820]  We're traders of foreign countries like China.
[27:55.820 --> 27:57.820]  We're all in bed with Russia.
[27:57.820 --> 27:58.820]  It's come out.
[27:58.820 --> 28:00.820]  We covered up the Russia gate for Hillary.
[28:00.820 --> 28:01.820]  What do we do?
[28:01.820 --> 28:03.820]  Let's say they're all traders.
[28:03.820 --> 28:06.820]  Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
[28:06.820 --> 28:08.820]  How do they say in German?
[28:08.820 --> 28:10.820]  Wunderbar.
[28:10.820 --> 28:13.820]  Ha, ha, nein.
[28:13.820 --> 28:16.820]  Du Haast, mage.
[28:16.820 --> 28:19.820]  But I'm afraid we can't take the risk.
[28:19.820 --> 28:21.820]  It's like an insurance policy, the unlikely event.
[28:21.820 --> 28:25.820]  You die before you're 40.
[28:25.820 --> 28:27.820]  That's right.
[28:27.820 --> 28:29.820]  We've got to make up this stuff.
[28:29.820 --> 28:32.820]  We've got to do it right now.
[28:32.820 --> 28:35.820]  But all of it's going up in flames.
[28:35.820 --> 28:42.820]  All the delusions of grandeur falling like little sandcastles made by children
[28:42.820 --> 28:45.820]  as the high tide rushes in.
[28:45.820 --> 28:50.820]  But this high tide is the hard, cold acid of truth
[28:50.820 --> 28:53.820]  that will burn through this cancer.
[28:53.820 --> 28:57.820]  And in the ashes of the cancer, the phoenix is rising.
[28:57.820 --> 28:59.820]  More critical inhales from the head.
[29:27.820 --> 29:29.820]  It's all today.
[29:58.820 --> 30:03.820]  You realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com,
[30:03.820 --> 30:06.820]  when you spread the videos, you are changing the world.
[30:06.820 --> 30:10.820]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Glovelist.
[30:10.820 --> 30:13.820]  It is you, the Info Warriors, across the planet
[30:13.820 --> 30:16.820]  that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure,
[30:16.820 --> 30:19.820]  that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[30:19.820 --> 30:22.820]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us,
[30:22.820 --> 30:24.820]  praying for us, and spreading the word.
[30:24.820 --> 30:25.820]  You are the InfoWars.
[30:25.820 --> 30:28.820]  And now because of their intensifying censorship,
[30:28.820 --> 30:33.820]  it's more important than ever that everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter
[30:33.820 --> 30:37.820]  and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us
[30:37.820 --> 30:41.820]  with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[30:41.820 --> 30:45.820]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles,
[30:45.820 --> 30:49.820]  to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[30:49.820 --> 30:56.820]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[30:56.820 --> 30:59.820]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[30:59.820 --> 31:02.820]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together
[31:02.820 --> 31:07.820]  with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[31:07.820 --> 31:10.820]  that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[31:10.820 --> 31:15.820]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[31:15.820 --> 31:19.820]  Made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature
[31:19.820 --> 31:23.820]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[31:23.820 --> 31:25.820]  It is a classical 360 win.
[31:25.820 --> 31:29.820]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[31:29.820 --> 31:32.820]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[31:32.820 --> 31:35.820]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[31:35.820 --> 31:37.820]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[31:37.820 --> 31:40.820]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[31:40.820 --> 31:44.820]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[31:44.820 --> 31:49.820]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
[31:49.820 --> 31:51.820]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[31:51.820 --> 31:54.820]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[31:54.820 --> 32:16.820]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[32:25.820 --> 32:28.820]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter.
[32:28.820 --> 32:31.820]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[32:31.820 --> 32:35.820]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:35.820 --> 32:40.820]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[32:40.820 --> 32:46.820]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[32:46.820 --> 32:58.820]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:16.820 --> 33:31.820]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:31.820 --> 33:42.820]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[33:42.820 --> 33:46.820]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[33:46.820 --> 33:49.820]  This is the heart of 1776.
[33:49.820 --> 33:54.820]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[33:54.820 --> 34:01.820]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[34:01.820 --> 34:12.820]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[34:12.820 --> 34:18.820]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[34:18.820 --> 34:22.820]  Donald Trump is now president of the United States.
[34:22.820 --> 34:27.820]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[34:27.820 --> 34:33.820]  On the floodlines of the InfoWars, it's Alex Jones.
[34:33.820 --> 34:59.820]  All my goodness, poor white people, please, on my side.
[34:59.820 --> 35:10.820]  While the deep state has struck back, Reuters is reporting that Paul Manafort supposedly violated his terms of his bail with his ankle bracelet.
[35:10.820 --> 35:13.820]  And so they have put him in jail.
[35:13.820 --> 35:16.820]  So he wouldn't make stuff about Trump.
[35:16.820 --> 35:29.820]  The Inspector General report comes out from the Justice Department proving the collusion, the plan to keep Trump from getting into office.
[35:29.820 --> 35:42.820]  And now Manafort, political lobbyist, consultant, lawyer for President Trump's former campaign chairman, Manafort has been indicted on money laundering, tax evasion, and obstruction of justice charges.
[35:42.820 --> 35:46.820]  He's currently incarcerated awaiting trial.
[35:46.820 --> 35:50.820]  So they just put it out there like it's no big deal in U.S. today, Reuters.
[35:50.820 --> 35:58.820]  Not saying that the whole case had fallen apart and the judges had said it was a political fraud and had been striking down stuff Mueller was trying.
[35:58.820 --> 36:05.820]  Now they've revoked his bail and thrown him into the Houskow.
[36:05.820 --> 36:08.820]  Never do that for white collar crime.
[36:08.820 --> 36:10.820]  And there's nothing even there.
[36:10.820 --> 36:18.820]  But this is them turning up the heat.
[36:18.820 --> 36:24.820]  Manafort ordered to jail, bail revoked on witness tampering charge.
[36:24.820 --> 36:34.820]  So we've got struck and we've got other people and we've got the Deputy Director of the FBI at the time, McCabe.
[36:34.820 --> 36:46.820]  And the Chief Legal Counselor James Baker and Attorney Lisa Page and the Deputy Director McCabe and Comey and all these people together.
[36:46.820 --> 36:53.820]  We now learn telling people Congress is about to call you, you're about to get subpoenaed.
[36:53.820 --> 37:02.820]  So you've got some of these people involved in clear witness tampering, but then Manafort, if he supposedly talks to anybody who ever knew or anybody they might call,
[37:02.820 --> 37:08.820]  and they've called hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people, they've grabbed them off airplanes, they've questioned them.
[37:08.820 --> 37:12.820]  Then if he ever talks to one of those people, well, sorry, that's witness tampering.
[37:12.820 --> 37:15.820]  You're going to prison now.
[37:15.820 --> 37:19.820]  So that's how desperate this fight's gotten.
[37:19.820 --> 37:22.820]  You have them trying to stop Trump from being elected.
[37:22.820 --> 37:24.820]  You have them trying to set him up once he's president.
[37:24.820 --> 37:27.820]  All of it's come up dry.
[37:27.820 --> 37:35.820]  It's a little insurance policy and it turns out the insurance policy rolls them all up for massive criminal activity.
[37:35.820 --> 37:46.820]  The Inspector General's report certifies that they've done this, but still says, oh, it's not criminal.
[37:46.820 --> 37:53.820]  Well, it's not the final word on the whole insurance policy and the rest of it.
[37:53.820 --> 38:00.820]  But as you heard the president say, and I want to play that one more time, he calls Comey scum.
[38:00.820 --> 38:06.820]  He calls people the top scum, this Clinton cabal, says the real FBI supports him, which is true, I would say.
[38:06.820 --> 38:13.820]  The average FBI agent responds to kidnappings and bank robberies and murders and child molestation and stuff like that.
[38:13.820 --> 38:14.820]  It is scum.
[38:14.820 --> 38:19.820]  It's a group of 13 people, including Obama now.
[38:19.820 --> 38:21.820]  How bombshell is that?
[38:21.820 --> 38:28.820]  We already knew that, but how bombshell?
[38:28.820 --> 38:37.820]  That we now have it confirm the AG report that he was using a fake name, a pseudonym, an alias.
[38:37.820 --> 38:41.820]  Remember the head of the EPA had to resign?
[38:41.820 --> 38:47.820]  Because she had a pseudonym and was using stuff to get around the Freedom Information Act?
[38:47.820 --> 38:49.820]  That was way low level compared to this.
[38:49.820 --> 38:55.820]  State department, top secret stuff across the board.
[38:55.820 --> 38:56.820]  But why not?
[38:56.820 --> 39:03.820]  They released the offage of personnel management, 21 million names, everybody that ever worked for the government, connections, spies, assets.
[39:03.820 --> 39:13.820]  They gave our entire network to the communist Chinese, who now use it as a database running major U.S. universities, that's in the Washington Post even,
[39:13.820 --> 39:19.820]  deciding who not to hire, whose former military, who they look up and can tell they're conservative.
[39:19.820 --> 39:26.820]  If they're Christian, they ever worked for the CIA, they ever worked for Defense Intelligence, they ever worked for any other agencies or groups,
[39:26.820 --> 39:32.820]  you don't get a job in the military industrial complex at the university level,
[39:32.820 --> 39:40.820]  because it's totally penetrated by the Chai comms and they actually put that name through to the liaison board
[39:40.820 --> 39:43.820]  that the Chinese government funds at every major state school.
[39:43.820 --> 39:46.820]  They basically have taken UT over.
[39:46.820 --> 39:50.820]  I know for a fact that they know, so I'll say this,
[39:50.820 --> 40:01.820]  patriots in our government have sent people in with super top secret backgrounds
[40:01.820 --> 40:11.820]  to watch them be refused when they're way over qualified to be able to do a data test and track the people at UT
[40:11.820 --> 40:20.820]  that are sending the information out through three levels of Chinese communist control.
[40:20.820 --> 40:29.820]  And then it sent back to Chinese army intelligence is in control of the University of Texas.
[40:29.820 --> 40:34.820]  I mean, whoa, whoa.
[40:34.820 --> 40:43.820]  They've got 21 million files.
[40:43.820 --> 40:53.820]  21 million files on everybody.
[40:53.820 --> 41:02.820]  The only thing not in those files is stuff that is ultra secret.
[41:02.820 --> 41:13.820]  They've got 99.9% of everything and now they've got the Apple cloud codes to everybody.
[41:13.820 --> 41:20.820]  Total penetration and Trump is there and they're freaking out because they're fighting like the wheel of a ship.
[41:20.820 --> 41:27.820]  Trump's the captain and the chai comms are going, you got this wheel here.
[41:27.820 --> 41:47.820]  The allegory would be that scene in the running man short story by the great pop sci-fi horror writer Stephen King
[41:47.820 --> 41:54.820]  and the Schwarzenegger character Ben Richards has got the chainsaw and Buzz saws the guy and goes,
[41:54.820 --> 41:57.820]  I'm going to cut you in half a saw as part of me and I'm going to make it part of you.
[41:57.820 --> 41:59.820]  And right now we got the chainsaw with communist China.
[41:59.820 --> 42:02.820]  They're going, we're getting you America, you're done.
[42:02.820 --> 42:04.820]  We got to go no.
[42:04.820 --> 42:07.820]  And just how you like that?
[42:07.820 --> 42:09.820]  That's everybody should be behind Trump.
[42:09.820 --> 42:12.820]  All you fools, all you left is all you chump idiots.
[42:12.820 --> 42:13.820]  Hollywood's collapsing.
[42:13.820 --> 42:16.820]  The globalists are evil.
[42:16.820 --> 42:20.820]  And your best bet at Davos and everything is China.
[42:20.820 --> 42:24.820]  And Obama gave them all the codes, the universities, everything.
[42:24.820 --> 42:26.820]  They got the Panama Canal, all the ports, all the minerals.
[42:26.820 --> 42:30.820]  We've been totally sold out that I cloud keys.
[42:30.820 --> 42:33.820]  Silicon Valley bet on the wrong horse.
[42:33.820 --> 42:36.820]  We're winning no matter what.
[42:36.820 --> 42:44.820]  And the Chinese communist networks are getting busted up everywhere and the Mexican mafia they use and the MS 13.
[42:44.820 --> 42:48.820]  They're taking acid baths right now.
[42:48.820 --> 42:50.820]  If you want to fight, gloves are off.
[42:50.820 --> 42:52.820]  Trump's rolling them up.
[42:52.820 --> 42:54.820]  And the Silicon Valley doesn't get in line.
[42:54.820 --> 43:18.820]  They're all going to start taking dirt naps.

[47:20.820 --> 47:40.820]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people. We love the American people.
[47:40.820 --> 47:54.820]  They came in peace.
[47:54.820 --> 48:05.820]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people.
[48:05.820 --> 48:11.820]  This is CNN.
[48:11.820 --> 48:22.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[48:22.820 --> 48:34.820]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[48:34.820 --> 48:49.820]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[48:49.820 --> 48:54.820]  Ramming speed. We're not giving us quarter. We're not giving them any quarter.
[48:54.820 --> 49:09.820]  Turn the dogs loose. Kill them all politically. They want to fight? They better believe they've got one.
[49:09.820 --> 49:24.820]  The whole criminal network is being imploded. The communist Chinese are our own globalist controllers for 50 years transferred our technology, our money, our science, the ports, the infrastructure to put them in the key position for global economic takeover.
[49:24.820 --> 49:39.820]  They're allied with radical Islam, allied with the globalist Pope, allied with Hollywood, allied with the big multinationals. But they're authoritarian and they're criminal and their own people hate them in China.
[49:39.820 --> 49:53.820]  But I knew Trump was turning things around three months ago when thousands of publications had to admit the truth that UT was run by Chinese intelligence and that they'd penetrated the hiring and firing process.
[49:53.820 --> 50:03.820]  You understand how important that is? Then they can put their people in and have their agents apply.
[50:03.820 --> 50:15.820]  The Chinese communist infiltration of America is 10,000 times bigger than the Russian.
[50:15.820 --> 50:25.820]  They just always try to get resources or better deals and it's just pure. You want stock in a company, you want to be put on a Russian board or you want to have sex with these women.
[50:25.820 --> 50:41.820]  It is completely direct. It's not how the Chinese work. They come in and they take control of universities and your companies and your corporations. They already have Hollywood. God help us.
[50:41.820 --> 50:48.820]  They totally overrun.
[50:48.820 --> 50:51.820]  And now we know the score.
[50:51.820 --> 51:01.820]  Now, we knew, I mean even Wall Street Journal like two weeks ago said, China is spanking Hollywood.
[51:01.820 --> 51:10.820]  Like it was a good thing. Hollywood faces Chinese censorship here in America.
[51:10.820 --> 51:21.820]  In Star Wars movies, if you haven't studied communist China, you don't see it. The uniforms, the emblems.
[51:21.820 --> 51:30.820]  The bombers blowing up the dreadnought in the one before the last Star Wars came out are wearing communist Chinese uniforms and they're Chinese.
[51:30.820 --> 51:37.820]  You got Chinese flying X-wings blowing stuff up. Chinese communist uniforms.
[51:37.820 --> 51:45.820]  Talk about propaganda. Folks, we're far gone. We're far gone. We're a laughing stock.
[51:45.820 --> 51:55.820]  And then Trump comes in and says, no, we're not going to have 290 percent tariffs on us and then we have nothing on you.
[51:55.820 --> 52:02.820]  No. And they go, you're insane. You're evil. No, we've been insane letting this go on.
[52:02.820 --> 52:10.820]  I think China came from nowhere and just outcompeted us. So China is hitting them hard.
[52:10.820 --> 52:13.820]  And we're hitting back.
[52:13.820 --> 52:18.820]  Now that said, Obama has been caught with a code name.
[52:18.820 --> 52:21.820]  It's in the Inspector General Report.
[52:21.820 --> 52:27.820]  Page 89, exhibit 75.
[52:27.820 --> 52:30.820]  There it is on screen.
[52:30.820 --> 52:39.820]  A mega flame-throwing thermonuclear bombshell that he lied to Congress through his surrogates.
[52:39.820 --> 52:42.820]  He lied to everybody. He said he had nothing to do with the server.
[52:42.820 --> 52:47.820]  And now it's all classified info that they were trading back and forth and trading with foreign powers.
[52:47.820 --> 52:53.820]  And it's also in the report that more than 20 foreign governments were in the server.
[52:53.820 --> 53:02.820]  And then Hillary then got donations from their companies in the tune of $3 billion at her foundation.
[53:02.820 --> 53:07.820]  You want something? You give me money. And that's even in her emails, the ones we've got.
[53:07.820 --> 53:10.820]  God, imagine the 30-something thousand we don't.
[53:10.820 --> 53:14.820]  You know, every other government has it. It's not the people. You know, our government has it, too.
[53:14.820 --> 53:22.820]  They're sitting there, here, give me money and I'll put what you want on that server.
[53:22.820 --> 53:26.820]  Of course, all the foreign donors are pulling out now because she hadn't run the State Department.
[53:26.820 --> 53:31.820]  She was supposed to be the President. She was supposed to do whatever she wanted. Think about her.
[53:31.820 --> 53:35.820]  And think about how the Communist Chinese, man, they think they're great.
[53:35.820 --> 53:40.820]  Wow, you gave us your entire worldwide network. You talk about a sabbatura.
[53:40.820 --> 53:46.820]  But people think that's hard to believe that happens. Look at other governments. Look at other things in history.
[53:46.820 --> 53:52.820]  Look at how we had Benedict Arnold, one of our top generals, then turned against us at the end.
[53:52.820 --> 53:59.820]  People sell out in war because they get masses of money for it, especially when they think they're selling out to the winter.
[53:59.820 --> 54:03.820]  That's what the CFR and Hollywood, everybody tells you. It's the Chinese century.
[54:03.820 --> 54:09.820]  America's done, crawl in a hole and die.
[54:09.820 --> 54:17.820]  Well, here's Obama denying that he was ever involved and used any fake names or involved in those emails of the servers.
[54:17.820 --> 54:23.820]  And he's now been caught red-handed, lying to everyone and engaged in criminal treason.
[54:23.820 --> 54:29.820]  As the President, this is high treason, sworn an oath to be the defender of the Republic.
[54:29.820 --> 54:35.820]  And he was there to bring it down with that monster, Hillary. God.
[54:35.820 --> 54:39.820]  You wonder why they're hiring all these America haters. You wonder why the schools teach hating America.
[54:39.820 --> 54:51.820]  They're creating the operatives to plug into Davos and to plug into the Chai comms and to plug into the Vatican and to plug into the Islamists and to take this country down.
[54:51.820 --> 54:55.820]  Here is the flashback of Obama Line.
[54:55.820 --> 54:59.820]  President Obama speaking out on 60 minutes about Hillary Clinton's email controversy.
[54:59.820 --> 55:03.820]  Did you know about Hillary's Clinton use of private email server?
[55:03.820 --> 55:05.820]  No. Well, she was Secretary of State? No.
[55:05.820 --> 55:12.820]  Saying while it's been in his words ginned up for political gain, his former Secretary of State should have held herself to a higher standard.
[55:12.820 --> 55:18.820]  It is important for her to answer these questions to the satisfaction of the American public and they can make their own judgment.
[55:18.820 --> 55:25.820]  I can tell you that this is not a situation in which America's national security was endangered.
[55:25.820 --> 55:35.820]  Says the top globalist agent that blew almost killed the country. We still may not make it. Just blew our entire network.
[55:35.820 --> 55:43.820]  The only thing worse is Apple being now Chinese government run. I mean, it's now they're into everything.
[55:43.820 --> 55:46.820]  God knows what we don't know about. Only God knows.
[55:46.820 --> 55:53.820]  Here is, again, also in the report, we just covered that earlier, that foreign governments were in her servers.
[55:53.820 --> 55:58.820]  Here is info wars in January of 2016. The first to ask Hillary about it.
[55:58.820 --> 56:02.820]  We learned about it from Colonel Schaefer and other patriots. Here it is.
[56:02.820 --> 56:07.820]  Last week, he was reported on info wars.com that your email server was hacked.
[56:07.820 --> 56:11.820]  Did you know and continued to use your email server? Can you comment on that?
[56:11.820 --> 56:13.820]  Yeah, it's totally untrue. Totally.
[56:13.820 --> 56:14.820]  Thanks guys.
[56:14.820 --> 56:16.820]  Okay, here we go.
[56:16.820 --> 56:23.820]  Lying, lying, lying as usual. Okay. That's it for this segment. I have a very important announcement to make.
[56:23.820 --> 56:26.820]  Not just that we have Tommy Robinson, spokesperson coming on.
[56:26.820 --> 56:32.820]  Now mainstream media confirms he's in a Muslim wing of a maximum security present transferred there to be basically killed.
[56:32.820 --> 56:36.820]  That's now news. We reported it Tuesday first and people tried to say it wasn't true.
[56:36.820 --> 56:39.820]  But now it's topdrugreport.com yesterday in the day.
[56:39.820 --> 56:47.820]  So there it is. FBI agent here's drugs said foreign actors access Hillary Clinton's emails. That's now all been confirmed as well.
[56:47.820 --> 56:52.820]  So there you go. You just heard Richard Reeves giving you that news a year and a half ago.
[56:52.820 --> 57:02.820]  That said, we're supposed to be doing this 34 hour broadcast that we're now like six, eight hours left in to raise money to fund the operation and expand the face of the globalist.
[57:02.820 --> 57:04.820]  And I haven't even done any plugging.
[57:04.820 --> 57:10.820]  We have launched Alex Jones legal fund.com and Alex Jones defense fund.com.
[57:10.820 --> 57:20.820]  They have a link to Roger Stone on the side as well for people that want to make just pure straight donations so that we can defeat all these frivolous sorrows and Hillary funded suits.
[57:20.820 --> 57:22.820]  We've already gotten most of them thrown out.
[57:22.820 --> 57:28.820]  But the big ones are here. We're going to win. Thanks to the grace of God, but pure donations are needed.
[57:28.820 --> 57:34.820]  If you'd like to go to infowarstore.com and fund the second American Revolution and put your money where it has the massive bang.

[58:07.820 --> 58:16.820]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula has the strongest curcumin and level of any other brand you're going to find out there at 95%.
[58:16.820 --> 58:20.820]  Leading competitors have a curcumin level of 3%.

[59:06.820 --> 59:10.820]  That stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.

[59:16.820 --> 59:25.820]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[59:25.820 --> 59:31.820]  so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[59:31.820 --> 59:39.820]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[59:39.820 --> 59:46.820]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[59:46.820 --> 01:00:11.820]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:19.820]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:24.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:32.820]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:44.820]  This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review.
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:59.820]  The report does identify errors of judgment, violations of or even disregard for policy and decisions that at the very least with the benefit of hindsight were not the best choices.
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:03.820]  A long awaited Inspector General's report has been released.
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:18.820]  Inspector General Michael Horowitz paints a picture of former FBI Director James Comey as a loose cannon who deviated from Bureau and Justice Department procedures while fumbling the Hillary Clinton email investigation,
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:26.820]  also claiming the Democratic Trump despising Comey was not motivated by political bias.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:48.820]  Inspector General Michael Horowitz concludes,
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:02:04.820]  While we did not find that these decisions were the result of political bias on Comey's part, we nevertheless concluded that by departing so clearly and dramatically from FBI and Department norms,
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:14.820]  the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the Department as fair administrators of justice.
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:19.820]  There's very little in here that we didn't know. Well, there are some emails and there are some texts we haven't seen,
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:25.820]  but in terms of the errors of judgment of Jim Comey, not of Bob Mueller of Jim Comey,
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:30.820]  in terms of the mountain of evidence that's sufficient to charge and convict Mrs. Clinton,
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:35.820]  in terms of the impropriety of Attorney General Lynch's meeting with Bill Clinton, there's nothing new.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:44.820]  It astounds me that there is no recommendation for the indictment of Hillary Clinton as wrong as the judgment was of Jim Comey,
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:54.820]  as critical as many of us have been of his decision to exonerator. That judgment is not permanent and can be reversed and there's no recommendation that it be done.
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:03:05.820]  The AIG report also outlines how Comey used his own Gmail account to handle FBI reports, even after being warned against it.
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:17.820]  Question is, if James Comey wasn't motivated by political bias, how do you explain the environment of the FBI agent's political bias surrounding the former FBI director?
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:25.820]  At the very least, I know they aren't Russians, but will the intelligence fixer's struck-and-page face prison for attempting to, quote,
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:33.820]  stop Trump, a clear usurpation of the presidential election of the democratically elected Donald Trump?
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:41.820]  And although the law required no reason at all to fire an FBI director, the administration then chose to defame me,
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:52.820]  and more importantly, the FBI, by saying that the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader.
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:04:06.820]  Those were lies, plain and simple. First, I want the American people to know this truth. The FBI is honest, the FBI is strong, and the FBI is and always will be independent.
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:11.820]  John Bown reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:47.820]  Amazing, coordinated criminal activity. We're breaking it all down straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones. This is the tale under the historic 34-hour fall of the deep state global transmission.
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:57.820]  However, if you're watching or listening, please tell everybody to listen and share those live video and audio links. It's critical to the rebellion.
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:08.820]  I want to plow into all of this, that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts,
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:17.820]  or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWars.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:30.820]  I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com. I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:38.820]  You cannot beat that for children and adults. We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:50.820]  InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA-253-3139, and your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:06:08.820]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:32.820]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate? Why don't we just try love? Why don't we just try love? We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:41.820]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherf**kers to change something. Steve Jobs is crazy. Now we all know Steve Jobs phones. They say Trump's crazy. They say I'm crazy.
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:48.820]  But I'm here to show love. It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:55.820]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:25.820]  Oh, well, she cried. I'll take you in, and I'll take care of you.
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:38.820]  Take me in, otender woman. Take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, otender woman. Side the vicious snake.
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:48.820]  This could be the great Trojan horse of all time, because you look at the migration, study it, look at it. Now they'll start infiltrating with women and children.
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:59.820]  Take me in, otender woman. Take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, otender woman. Side the vicious snake.
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:10.820]  Now she clutched him to her bosom. You're so beautiful, she cried. But if I hadn't brought you in, by now you might have died.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:24.820]  She stroked his pretty skin, and then she kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:36.820]  I saved you, cried the woman. And you've bit me, heaven's wide. You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:55.820]  Oh, shut up, silly woman. Said the reptile with a grin. You knew damn well I was a snake, before you took me in.
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:59.820]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:05.820]  The guy named Alex Jones. Alex Jones. From Info Wars. From Info Wars. Yeah. Alex Jones. Alex Jones.
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:11.820]  The guy who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11. I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true.
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:16.820]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:21.820]  The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:26.820]  She just had to keep digging, didn't she, Alex? I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true.
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:37.820]  The Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to various stories like the Clinton's body count story that's according to website Info Wars.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:42.820]  And this really, this is so disgusting. The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:48.820]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:51.820]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:57.820]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement like Alex Jones are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:00.820]  If Trump gets elected, he's going to be Secretary of Defense.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:02.820]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.820]  Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.820]  Bill Clinton is a rapist at InfoWars.com.
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:09.820]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:14.820]  Bill Clinton is a rapist at InfoWars.com. InfoWars.com. Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:17.820]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:26.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:43.820]  In November of 2017, an ailing Senator John McCain said that he and Democrat Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed were working on a proposal to update the broad war powers Congress gave the Commander-in-Chief after the 9-11 terrorist attacks.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:49.820]  Fast forward to the Senate debate on the 2019 NDAA raising questions on the Hill.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:59.820]  Corker Kane authorizes war against at least eight groups that are known to operate altogether in over 20 countries. Hardly sounds like we'll have any less war.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:00.820]  Corker Kane.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:14.820]  Look, if the Congress decides to withdraw funds for some military excursion, the President will veto the act of withdrawal and then it will require a two-thirds vote of both houses to overcome that.
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:30.820]  So a President with one-third plus one in either house can wage war on any target at any time the President chooses to do so. That is so contrary to what Madison intended. So contrary to the plain meaning of the Constitution.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:43.820]  So violative of the separation of powers has to be a rejection of the oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. And none of you wants to reject that oath.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:58.820]  We find ourselves at this ignoble moment, not by accident, but by decades of concerted effort by members of this institution to evade the responsibilities given to them by the framers of our Constitution.
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:15.820]  So this body has failed historically to require a declaration. So they got rid of the declarations and then they failed and got rid of the need to specify as to nations were going to go at war against.
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:28.820]  And now they're about to get rid of even the requirement to get any type of prior authorization. It'll make this body a pedestrian to war and it will put war-making on autopilot.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:47.820]  And this law does not even have a sunset provision. It just goes on. You adopt this proposal, we'll have 170 more because this has virtually no standards. It will effectively revise the Constitution of the United States without an amendment.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:13:05.820]  The top priority for this Senate must be to ensure that S.J. Rez 59, the Corker, Cain, AUMF does not become law. The damage would be colossal. Not only would it almost irretrievably see to the executive branch the most fundamental power that Congress has under Article 1 of the Constitution,
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:22.820]  the power to declare war, but it also would give the current president and all future presidents authority from Congress to engage in worldwide war. The Corker, Cain, AUMF would authorize force without operational limitations against eight groups in six countries.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:38.820]  The president could then add to both lists as long as the president reports the expansion of Congress. To be clear, the president would have unilateral authority to add additional countries, including the United States itself, to the list of countries where Congress is authorizing war.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:48.820]  A key bipartisan issue to watch is Turkey making its way off the back burner of tyranny where the 2019 NDAA relevance is concerned.
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:14:06.820]  The adversary in North Korea released three prisoners. We've seen Venezuela release a prisoner. But in Turkey, since October of 2016, we've seen them hold a man for over a year and a half or almost a year and a half without charges.
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:28.820]  And then I saw a man go before a court and witness for a whole day being subjected to some of the most absurd charges possible. If that's the behavior of an NATO ally, is that really where we should be putting in our supply chains and in our defensive systems one of the most sophisticated weapons, one of the most important weapons in our arsenal?
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:43.820]  The Washington Examiner reports senators will now be filing proposed amendments and gearing up for debate and voting that could stretch into next week. The House passed its version of the NDAA on May 24th.
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:53.820]  Once the Senate votes, both chambers armed services committees typically name a conference committee to hammer out a final compromise in the fall.
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:59.820]  John Bown reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:49.820]  This is the heart of 1776. You're a white male!

[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:24.820]  We're going to break down in just a moment, but let's go back to a year and a half ago on the 9th of November 8th,
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:34.820]  and their horror, their panic, their belly aching, their collapse into the Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:58.820]  Help me assemble my colleagues at Trump Tower just a few minutes ago. There's a little optimism here.
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:05.820]  I'm seeing these late-breaking trends. This could hand Trump the presidency. Folks, this is not by any means over.
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:10.820]  I think there's some real jitter-setting in Clinton headquarters right now.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:16.820]  Wolf, the scene here is so different than it was a few hours ago when people were happy and relaxed.
[01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:18.820]  This is most unexpected.
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:22.820]  Certainly is a huge, huge surprise to so many people out there.
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:30.820]  I think we all thought it couldn't happen, and he couldn't do what he did, and guess what? He may just do it.
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:34.820]  Donald Trump has taken the lead. He has 216 electoral votes.
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:37.820]  This is truly the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:43.820]  The number of groups who are likely feeling real fear right now.
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:47.820]  You've got women, immigrants who have been threatened by Donald Trump with deportation.
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:54.820]  How do I explain this to my children? I have Muslim friends who are texting me tonight saying, should I leave the country?
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:22:00.820]  America is crying tonight. I'm not sure how much of America but a very, very significant portion.
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:25.820]  I mean, literally crying.
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:28.820]  People have talked about a miracle.
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:34.820]  I'm hearing about a nightmare.
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:40.820]  This is your life now. This is us. This is our country.
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:43.820]  And that's why they're mad. That's why they're upset.
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:46.820]  You know, mainstream media hypes things that don't exist.
[01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:52.820]  Like Trump feeding the fish wrong, or Trump shouldn't have saluted the North Korean military officer,
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.820]  even though the etiquette says, if you're on friendly terms, you do that.
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:57.820]  He's trying to butter them up to free their people.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:59.820]  They do this stuff constantly.
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:08.820]  But then, meanwhile, you've got the Inspector General report and they kind of soften the iron fist with a velvet glove.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:13.820]  But in the contents of it, it's incredible.
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:19.820]  Obama was one of 13 people inside the illegal server using an alias.
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.820]  Obama used an alias inside the criminal server.
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.820]  It's a drop box to foreign governments.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:27.820]  He lied about it. He lied about it.
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:33.820]  He said he had no idea she was using a private server, so he lied about it.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:35.820]  Isn't this the biggest thing to come out yet?
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:39.820]  I mean, of course, they're also saying, we will stop him. He'll never get in.
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:42.820]  It's our intention to frame him. I mean, we have them.
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:47.820]  See, they attempt to explain it all the way by saying, well, those people, the people who said those things,
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:50.820]  they weren't in decision-making roles.
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:56.820]  I mean, Peter struck the one who questioned General Flynn, who caught him on his alleged lie.
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:00.820]  He's the guy that covered up. He was the special agent of corruption.
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:04.820]  It's why he was such a wonder kid, this, you know, this super mention,
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:09.820]  because he's running around covering up the Hillary investigations,
[01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:11.820]  giving her letters saying it isn't a real investigation.
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:15.820]  This is going to be a fake interview while he's busy trying to set up the Patriots.
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:24.820]  At the same time, that performance by the FBI director yesterday was one of the most phony, outrageous cover-ups I've ever seen.
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:29.820]  It did come off like he had had about four or five of his teeth pulled without anesthesia.
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:33.820]  Well, first of all, he keeps giving lip service to congressional oversight,
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:36.820]  but in fact, they've been thwarting oversight.
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:42.820]  As Devin Nunes said last night, some of the things that he just saw in the IG report are things he's been asking for for months,
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:45.820]  and he's been stonewalled. All right, I'm going to stop you right there,
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:49.820]  because I've done an hour and 24 minutes of broadcast, and I've done one minute of plugging.
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:52.820]  This is supposedly our 34-hour fundraising.
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:58.820]  This, from my mouth to yours, is the intel, and it's a fact.
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:04.820]  If you don't donate to Roger Stone and buy hundreds of thousands of his books,
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:10.820]  he only makes a few dollars off each one, they will successfully bankrupt him,
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.820]  but he's been a key advisor to Trump and somebody we need on the team.
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:15.820]  Take InfoWars.
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.820]  We're having a 34-hour broadcast.
[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:18.820]  We're about to end.
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:23.820]  Specialists have been running for two weeks of free shipping on more than 20 best-selling items and 50% off.
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:29.820]  We need folks to go to AlexJonesLegalFun.com.
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:33.820]  The same URL, AlexJonesDefenseFun.com, takes you there.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:37.820]  And WhoFramedRogerStone.com, and you need to donate.
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:43.820]  You can donate by buying products, you can donate by direct donation,
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:49.820]  but whatever you do, do it because look how we're demonized, look how we're attacked.
[01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:55.820]  After Trump, Roger Stone and AlexJones are the most demonized, the most sued,
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:58.820]  the most lied about people.
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.820]  They edit stuff from the show that we never said.
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:07.820]  Little telltale signage, you'll hear audio on NBC or CNN, and notice it's audio.
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:10.820]  Even though this show is video, because they can then edit it.
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:13.820]  If they edit video, there's jump cuts and people catch them.
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:16.820]  So they're doing incredibly criminal stuff.
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:21.820]  They want me to sue them because they've got all the unlimited stolen Federal Reserve notes,
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:23.820]  so they just want me to fight them for a few years.
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:24.820]  They don't even care about when to judgment.
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:26.820]  They don't care about the money.
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:28.820]  They want to bankrupt us.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:34.820]  They have Hillary's law firms that she works for and that her people are with admittedly saying,
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:36.820]  we want to bankrupt AlexJones.
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.820]  They're in giant disinformation campaigns.
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:42.820]  Now the good news is the public doesn't buy it.
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:44.820]  The general public's a travel the country.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:52.820]  I shook 300 hands or more while I was in Hawaii versus three women that came up to me and said,
[01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:55.820]  you're a horrible person, quit saying no kids died at Sandy Hook.
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:58.820]  And I'd say that's out of context and I haven't said that in years.
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:00.820]  And I have apologized for a shut up.
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:01.820]  Get away from me.
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:02.820]  I'm calling the police.
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:04.820]  Two of the women said, get away from me.
[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:05.820]  Get away from me.
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:08.820]  So they come over to you with their husband walking behind them.
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:12.820]  It's always the same in their kids and they get in your face and then call you these names.
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:17.820]  So the problem is they're suing me in Travis County and they're suing me in New Haven, Connecticut.
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:20.820]  They're going to the places where they know nobody knew the Fair Trial.
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:23.820]  It's the most liberal venues in the country.
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:27.820]  I mean, there's no way the top lawyers have said this is a total lynching.
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:29.820]  You're not getting a fair shake, but still on appeal.
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:33.820]  It's terminated and probably never even get to that because the judges know what a circus it's going to be.
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:39.820]  Because they're also suing people who do think the whole thing's a hoax saying that they work for me when they don't and mixing me in with them.
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:41.820]  I mean, it's a disaster train wreck.
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:44.820]  The lawyers don't want to get into strategy once we get there, but it's crazy.
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:46.820]  The point is you've been sued by the president's group.
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:47.820]  They're coming after you.
[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:49.820]  You just want a defamation suit where they sued you.
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:51.820]  You want that still they're trying to bankrupt you.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:53.820]  So here's the bottom line.
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:54.820]  This is a real world.
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:58.820]  This isn't like watching Netflix or watching football where you're a spectator.
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:00.820]  You are on the field.
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:05.820]  And when you buy products and when you give us donations, it changes the world.
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:09.820]  We need you to go to whoframedrogerstone.com.
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:10.820]  That's the best place, right?
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:11.820]  Or stonedefencefund.com.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:12.820]  Yeah, that's the one.
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:13.820]  Okay.
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:15.820]  Stonedefencefund.com takes you to the same place.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:16.820]  Yes.
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:22.820]  So, so stonedefencefund.com, people need to go there and they need to donate.
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:23.820]  Period.
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:26.820]  Listen, so many of the folks that donate are not wealthy.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:29.820]  They affect their poor people or working class.
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:33.820]  So many of the middle class and wealthy folks sit on the fence in this world.
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:35.820]  Like keeping your head down keeps you safe.
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:38.820]  Keeping your head down almost ruined the country.
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:39.820]  We're the tip of the spear.
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:40.820]  We need your support.

[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:07.820]  your diagnosis may be the result of job-related exposure to asbestos and you may be entitled to compensation.
[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:12.820]  Over 30 billion in trusts have been set aside for individuals who have been affected by asbestos exposure.

[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:40.820]  but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:46.820]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme

[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:24.820]  This is an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:26.820]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:39.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing massive historic things happening right now.
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:42.820]  Roger Stone here riding shotgun with me throughout the next few hours.
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:47.820]  We're going until 6 o'clock tonight with the special 34-hour global transmission.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:51.820]  We're talking about doing a special emergency report tomorrow with Roger Stone,
[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:55.820]  who's here in Austin, but I don't want to just get up here and whine
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:57.820]  and say donate to our legal defense fund.
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:33:59.820]  Help us. This is a war.
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:02.820]  Like donating in World War II, buying U.S. war bonds
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:05.820]  so we get better guns and more munitions to win the war.
[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:10.820]  This is absolutely 1,000% critical to the mission being whine.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:13.820]  And I want to again thank everybody that supported us.
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:18.820]  Back when I first started doing money bombs, I don't know, like 10 years ago,
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:21.820]  we would get 90% of the donations in money.
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:24.820]  And that means you get a dollar, you get to spend a dollar on the broadcast
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:29.820]  and equipment and legal or crew members, things you're doing.
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:34.820]  Nowadays, when you ask for donations, it's like 10% of the money that comes in
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:36.820]  and people just go and they buy product.
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:40.820]  Well, when we're doing 50% off, I'm making like five bucks on a clittle silver right now.
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:43.820]  It's really high quality. It's 50% off right now.
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:45.820]  You've got some of the products out there.
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:55.820]  Again, where I've got like 50% markup left in it when we do the 50% cut
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:59.820]  because normally we mark stuff up 100 to 150%.
[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:03.820]  The average supplement maker marks them up seven fold.
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:07.820]  We don't do that. We put a gigantic amount of product.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:13.820]  Things like alpha power for libido, for stamina, for energy, for everything.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:17.820]  I went to the top developers and I said, I want the strongest thing on the market
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:23.820]  with everything known to be safe and good in it so that it blows people completely out of the water.
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:26.820]  I can't take alpha power. It's so strong.
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:30.820]  Supermobiltality is great. It's not as strong, but it's cold pressed.
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.820]  So you get a different effect, but it's got some of the same things in it,
[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:38.820]  even though it's probably 20%. They've got these big tests and these spectrometer deals
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:43.820]  and I get the reports. I don't understand it all, but the point is,
[01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:46.820]  is that cold press is different with the molecules and what it's got in it.
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:50.820]  It's from fresh herbs. Alpha power is from high quality organic concentrated herbs,
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:53.820]  but it's from the dry ones. So it's a different thing.
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:57.820]  It's way stronger. We have those combo right now, 50% off.
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:35:59.820]  Those specials are about to end.
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:03.820]  But if the listeners just commit to pray for the broadcast,
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:06.820]  to spread the articles, to spread the videos, to buy the product,
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:10.820]  the product you like, like the Wake up America coffee or the other products
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:13.820]  that are perishable or that you're going to reuse,
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:18.820]  then just sign up for auto ship, cancel anytime, every 15, every 30, every 60,
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:24.820]  every 90 days, cancel anytime and an additional 10% off on that order.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:29.820]  Locking in the old original sales price, another great deal and you get 5%
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:33.820]  on every dollar, Patriot points. So you add all this together.
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:36.820]  These are amazing deals. Take Prostagard.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:40.820]  They have saw palmetto stuff and even the FDA admits that helps with your prostate
[01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:44.820]  and other things. It's rarely even admit what herbs do.
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:47.820]  And I see it sold for like 50, 60 bucks out there.
[01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:51.820]  We put stronger saw palmetto and then a bunch of other known things
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:54.820]  that are good for your prostate and then sell it for half the price.
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:58.820]  When it's on sale, it's even less than half the price of leading competitors.
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:01.820]  So it's better. It's stronger. It's a lower price.
[01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:05.820]  You cannot lose with these products unless you don't order them.
[01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:08.820]  This is a non-zero sum game total win-win.
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:13.820]  Now, that said, Roger Stone with his new Stones Rules book
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:17.820]  is not going to be able to pay his legal bills, all the things he's doing,
[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:21.820]  where he makes a couple bucks off each one he sells at the time that, you know,
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:26.820]  he gets 20, 30% from the publisher of what they keep.
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:29.820]  They're selling it, as I know, to like Amazon for 10 bucks
[01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:31.820]  or selling it to the bookstore for 10 bucks.
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:34.820]  And then he gets three bucks. That doesn't float the boat.
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:38.820]  So go get the book at m4store.com. It's excellent.
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:41.820]  How to win at politics, business and style.
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:45.820]  But more importantly, go to whoframedrogerstone.com
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:47.820]  or Stone Legal Defense Fund.
[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:49.820]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:51.820]  That's the one I want on screen. Let's change it.
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:54.820]  StoneDefenseFund.com. We even had meetings about that.
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:57.820]  Then I got this one that said this. So say it again so it's clear for everybody.
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:02.820]  StoneDefenseFund.com. Alex, I think it's important people understand what I'm going through.
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:06.820]  Right now, Robert Mueller's minions are fighting in court
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:11.820]  to drag every young person who's worked for me over the last 10 years in front of a grand jury.
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:16.820]  They're asking them inappropriate questions about my personal life, my business life,
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:19.820]  my friendship with you, my relationship with you.
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:22.820]  Did you vote for Donald Trump? Do you like Donald Trump?
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:25.820]  This is an inquisition. I have broken no laws.
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:28.820]  They're empty-handed on Russian collusion.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:32.820]  They're empty-handed on any hijinks with WikiLeaks.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:35.820]  It's a witch hunt, just like the president says.
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:38.820]  I'm being persecuted for supporting Donald Trump.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:43.820]  That's what this is about. And that segues us into this right now.
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:47.820]  Manafort, you predicted it was coming. Tell folks what just happened to him.
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:53.820]  They have revoked his bail so that he can sit in a jail cell to put additional pressure on him to plead guilty.
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:55.820]  They don't want to go to trial.
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:39:00.820]  The reason they don't want to go to trial is because their surveillance will become known.
[01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:03.820]  And their surveillance, like the surveillance on May through a FISA warrant,
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:06.820]  is most likely unconstitutional and illegal.
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:09.820]  It was surveillance for political purposes.
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:15.820]  Under the FISA law, a U.S. citizen can only be issued a FISA surveillance warrant
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:20.820]  if they are engaged in espionage for a foreign power against the United States.
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:23.820]  That definition does not fit me.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:27.820]  They now admit it's a process thing from over a decade ago where they claim
[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:29.820]  he had an offshore corporation that was wrong.
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.820]  And now they've moved on to jail time for tampering with witnesses.
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:37.820]  There's no Russia there except Strach covering up what Hillary and her foundation was doing.
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:41.820]  This is absolutely cruel and unusual punishment.
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:45.820]  Why don't they just put him in the stocks or hang him up by chains by his ankles to make him talk?
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:48.820]  They just want him to plead because they don't want to go to trial
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:51.820]  because it will expose their illegal surveillance.
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:54.820]  But you predicted correctly that Manafort will not make stuff up.
[01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:56.820]  It's not rolling because there's nothing there.
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:57.820]  It's the same thing.
[01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:01.820]  Look, now that they know there is no Russian collusion on my part,
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:06.820]  there is no collusion or coordination or collaboration with WikiLeaks,
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:11.820]  it's entirely possible that they will conjure up some bogus offense
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:15.820]  and use it to pressure me to testify against Donald Trump.
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.820]  That's what they want.
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:19.820]  They know I have been a Trump confident for 40 years.
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:21.820]  They know that I know many things.
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:24.820]  They want me to testify against the president.
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:29.820]  Alex, it's not going to happen, but fending them off is going to cost me a million dollars
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:32.820]  because they're going to try to give me that Manafort treatment.
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:34.820]  I sleep well at night because I know I've broken no laws
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:39.820]  and everything I did in connection with the 2016 election was entirely legal.
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:42.820]  How long could Manafort sit in jail waiting for a trial that never comes?
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:45.820]  Because it's admitted the judge is trying to speed this along
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:48.820]  and has actually come out and said you guys are full of it.
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:49.820]  This is political.
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:51.820]  Well, then why do the same judge then just throw him in jail?
[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:53.820]  You've got two different states and two different judges.
[01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:59.820]  The judge in Virginia has called Mueller out on the political nature of his inquiry
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:00.820]  and the phoniness.
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:03.820]  Those charges may yet even get thrown out yet,
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:07.820]  but the charges in D.C. are in front of an Obama-appointed judge.
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:11.820]  A swamp creature who is most definitely not sympathetic.
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:13.820]  You know, it's incredible how brazen.
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:18.820]  How can they continue on with this the day after the Inspector General report comes out
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:24.820]  admitting that Obama was using a code name, was using an alias,
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:29.820]  was involved in legal activity, did lie about it with the Hillary server.
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:31.820]  You've got Strock saying he'll never be president.
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:32.820]  We're going to stop him.
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:34.820]  We're going to have our insurance policy.
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:38.820]  This is so huge and we need to see these people indicted.
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:41.820]  We need to see Trump go after them.
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:44.820]  The Russian case is the most egregious example.
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:49.820]  Mr. Mueller brings a case against these 13 Russians assuming they'll never show up for trial.
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:51.820]  They show up and they plead not guilty.
[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:56.820]  Under American jurisprudence, they're entitled to see the evidence against them.
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:57.820]  He won't show it to them.
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:00.820]  He says he can't because it's an ongoing investigation.
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:04.820]  Well, if it's an ongoing investigation, why did he already bring the indictment?
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:07.820]  He doesn't want to demonstrate what he has.
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:11.820]  I can't see any judge going along with that.
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:14.820]  So how long can Manafort sit there potentially?
[01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:16.820]  Well, they're talking about trial now in September.
[01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:19.820]  He could be in jail for three or four months.
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:22.820]  This is meant to induce him to plead.
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:23.820]  But you know him.
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:25.820]  You've been business partners with him for decades.
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:27.820]  You say he's a tough cookie.
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:29.820]  Look, he's an Italian American.
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:31.820]  He knows he's done nothing wrong.
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:36.820]  Certainly no charges against him pertain to the Trump campaign or what he did to elect Donald Trump.
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:39.820]  He's being punished for nominating Donald Trump for president.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.820]  That's why he's being punished.
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:47.820]  And now they're putting fake charges out from 28 years ago on Sylvester Stallone for protecting the president.
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:51.820]  If you defend the president, they make stuff up about you and try to throw you in jail
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:53.820]  because he's a real American president.
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:54.820]  He's bringing the country back.
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:58.820]  We're going to break it all down straight ahead.

[01:43:56.820 --> 01:44:00.820]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:03.820]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:09.820]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:17.820]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:23.820]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:29.820]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:33.820]  Next, we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:40.820]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:46.820]  As it turns out, the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:51.820]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:57.820]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:02.820]  Our team is always looking for new ways to improve our products.
[01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:06.820]  That's why we've created the newest version of a fan favorite formula.

[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:38.820]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:49.820]  Okay, I intend to open the phones up for Roger Stone and myself on the IG report on all the things that are happening.
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:53.820]  Do you think I'm over-optimistic about how Trump's delivering?
[01:47:53.820 --> 01:48:00.820]  Now he's gotten so much done even for an instant gratification society and culture in a year and a half, it's dizzying.
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:09.820]  Your report card on the state of the Union, the state of the world, on Trump and how the deep states can strike back.
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:11.820]  It's making a mistake that they are striking back against us and against you and really trying to suppress this country.
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:16.820]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789.
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:21.820]  Alex is the number on this global Friday transmission.
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:27.820]  Roger and I will be hosting on and off again today, right through 6 o'clock in the 34-hour broadcast.
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:35.820]  I may even go later tonight because there's so much to cover and so much to get into and so much happening, but we'll see.
[01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:45.820]  We're going to go over the IG report in some of the other areas, but I don't feel like I even have words to describe how bizarre this is,
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:52.820]  because they come out and say you didn't do anything wrong, but yes, Trump was illegally spied on, and yes, they lied to do it,
[01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:59.820]  and yes, they violated all the FBI rules, and yes, they lied to Congress, and yes, Obama lied, and yes, he was inside the illegal server
[01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:05.820]  with all this classified stuff and foreign government, clearly a dropbox, just a total sellout America orgy facility
[01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:09.820]  with the President and the State Department head and all these foreign governments.
[01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:16.820]  This is walk the plank stuff, this is firing squad stuff, and I'm not saying I want any harm to come to Hillary or Obama.
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:21.820]  I want them to be charged, to have a trial, and be put in supermax prison.
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:26.820]  But it's confirmed they were sabotaging the country for the Communist Chinese and the globalists.
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:33.820]  That's the plan, that's what happens, you study history, there were always traders in Rome and traders in England and traders in Asia-Japan,
[01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:41.820]  and you'd have some honorable guy that had been known for decades, you know, in the showgun, who would then turn against, you know, the people.
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:48.820]  I mean, Benedict Arnold, this is happening, the Office of Personnel Management, 21 million names, all the codes given to the Chai comms,
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:55.820]  the Apple codes given to them publicly three months ago, a total sellout, all the patriots being targeted, saying we're the enemies.
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:50:00.820]  No, we're the Americans. They think we're dumb, we believe in the country. They believe we're dumb, we're loyal.
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:05.820]  No, we're not scum like you. We don't support mobile execution vans for Christians and Buddhists in China.
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:13.820]  We don't support total surveillance. We don't support totally open borders in the UN and weirdo Nazi collaborators.
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:20.820]  God, there must be a paid talking point out that George Soros was captured by the Nazis and that George Soros was this hero.
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:26.820]  I've seen that on CNN and everywhere else, but then I even saw it on a well-known podcast last night.
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:32.820]  And because it was about me and I looked it up and Alex Jones is wrong, George Soros was captured by the Nazis.
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:37.820]  No, he told 60 Minutes, he helped his father round up Jews. He said it.
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:45.820]  But everybody bows to that son of a piece of crap. And I am not going to do it. Not because I'm macho, but because I'm going to live.
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:51.820]  I'm not rolling over to criminals. Nazi collaborators deserve to be off this planet.
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:59.820]  And some sick twist of fate. Both my grandfathers had almost died in World War II and the Army Air Corps have been dead for a long time.
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:09.820]  And then that person is just slamming around, suing me and attacking me. And the fact is, I think more of Americans to get scum like this off our backs.
[01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:15.820]  I'm trying to get them off your back. You take Bill Maher. In fact, cue that up. I didn't play it yesterday.
[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:23.820]  He gets up there and he says, I want Trump to go belly up. And to do that, I want America to go belly up.
[01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:29.820]  I want to crash this economy. He's worth over $100 million in his own words.
[01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:35.820]  He makes 10 million a year just off doing one show a week with HBO. Not to mention all his other crap.
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:43.820]  And he sits up there and he says he wants to crash our economy. That's the nature of globalism.
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:49.820]  Trump wants prosperity. He believes in you. Let's go ahead and play the Bill Maher clip. Here it is.
[01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:56.820]  Can I ask about the economy? Because this economy is going pretty well. We have to, what? Why is that funny?
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:58.820]  It is going well for now.
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:05.820]  For now, right. That's my question. I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point.
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:10.820]  And by the way, I'm hoping for it because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy.
[01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:19.820]  So please bring on the recession. Sorry if that hurts people, but it's either roof for a recession or you lose your democracy.
[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:27.820]  Unbelievable. I mean, he wants to hurt people. He wants to hurt working people. He wants to hurt people at the bottom of the system.
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:32.820]  You saw that two minute video that Trump had for Kim Jong-un. It's about destiny. The little people. Let's help him.
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:37.820]  Let's be real men of leadership. Let's believe in the human power of the average person. Let's have good will.
[01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:41.820]  Trump is good will. These people are bad will.
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:47.820]  Well, it's just like they're hoping for the collapse of the peace talks in Korea because they're being conducted by Donald Trump.
[01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:51.820]  You know why he wants to collapse? Because he can buy everything up when we are collapsed.
[01:52:51.820 --> 01:53:01.820]  It's pathetic. It reminds me of in Nixon's second term when he signed a strategic arms limitation agreement with the Soviets.
[01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:07.820]  You would think the liberals would be celebrating, but no, because he signed it, they were against it. It's the same thing here.
[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:14.820]  Donald Trump has done what three previous presidents could not do. He's got the North Koreans at the table.
[01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:19.820]  They've already agreed to everything and they've already come across the border. It's done.
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:25.820]  They've already now said America's good and Trump is good. When they've never done that in 60 plus years, it's done. They did the deal.
[01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:27.820]  But the neocons are trying to sabotage.
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:33.820]  Well, the president's smart enough to have a deal that can be verified. He's not a sucker. He's not going to be taken.
[01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:35.820]  No, we're going to take control of the weapons of France.
[01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:40.820]  It's not going to be like the Iranian deal that Barack Obama did, but they don't want to give him.
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:46.820]  They're going to deliver the goods and blow everything up or we'll have him violate the deal and blow the limit snot out of him.
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:49.820]  That's why you see this hysteria in the country.
[01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:57.820]  Robert Mueller's disapproval, 53%, the president's approval rating, climbing, the economy, zoring.
[01:53:57.820 --> 01:53:58.820]  He's come along. He's upset.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:01.820]  By the way, did you see the look on Kim Jong-un's hand when he signed that look to Trump?
[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:05.820]  He looks like he's totally freaked out, but hiring to kite in a good way.
[01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:09.820]  Going back from the dark side like Darth Vader throwing the emperor down.
[01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:14.820]  I mean, look at the look. I mean, he is definitely under the spell of Trump right there and gets it.
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:18.820]  Look when he looks up right here. Boom. He just did it.
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:24.820]  And you see him breathe in. He, it's done. It's done. He's going to bring prosperity to him.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:28.820]  Kim Jong-un has never looked like that in any video I've seen. He's got tears in his eye right there.
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:32.820]  He just did the right thing and I think felt the Holy Spirit for the first time in his life.
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:34.820]  He's going to bring prosperity to his people.
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:37.820]  He's going to, that's got to feel good to try to take care of people, doesn't it?
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:39.820]  Instead of being a piece of crap all day.
[01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:44.820]  Like that idiot Soros that is overthrown more than 20 countries and bankrupted nations.
[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:49.820]  He was a teenager. He was on Lair News Hour that he bankrupted countries and tried to bankrupt Europe
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:54.820]  and tried to bankrupt England and tried to bankrupt Muslim countries and get it and made hundreds of billions on evil.
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:59.820]  And then he came into the U.S. and bought everybody off of the 90s and now he's the second coming of Christ.
[01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:05.820]  There's no question in my mind that he is the one financing all of these bogus lawsuits against you.
[01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:07.820]  That's where the money's coming from. That's where the direction is.
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:10.820]  I have been told, stop saying it.
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:16.820]  I've been told, leave Soros alone and stop saying it's a Nazi. Leave radical Muslims alone and stop covering the child kidnapping and you'll be left alone.
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:20.820]  Well, guess what? I'm sure they've all noticed I'm not shutting up.
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:22.820]  To say the least.
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:25.820]  I'm going to go back to the table again to people right here.
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:29.820]  You have a chance right now to supercharge history.
[01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:33.820]  I'm playing a game of chicken just like Road Warrior here against humongous.
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:36.820]  Okay, I'm not going to turn the 18 wheeler.
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:43.820]  I'm going in against them, but fuel, I have to have fuel in the tank to get the 18 wheeler up to 110 miles an hour.
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:44.820]  There's no governor on this.
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:49.820]  Humongous has got nitrous oxide on him. He's going at me and 180 miles an hour in his tractor.
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:54.820]  Here's the difference. We're bigger. We're heavier. We're going to run them off the road.
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:56:02.820]  But I need to get the gas speed up all the way so that when I ran into these people at 110 miles an hour, they're going 180.
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:07.820]  We're talking 300-something miles an hour here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:18.820]  I want full impact, full absolute rampage, terminal velocity, point of no return, crossing the Rubicon, event horizon.
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:20.820]  I want incineration.
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:26.820]  And so I'm telling you, I want your prayers. I want your will. I want your strength. I want your honor.
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:29.820]  But I don't want your will turned over to me. I want you to turn your will on.
[01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:36.820]  And for all of us to combine forces like Trump has us doing with our spirit, that they can feel and see manifest.
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:40.820]  And I want to see full absolute commitment.
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:46.820]  Spread the article. Spread the video. Support the local stations and go to infowarstore.com and buy a product.
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:51.820]  Go to AlexJonesLegalFund.com and make straight up donations.
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:56.820]  We're not some tax-free thing in the government control. We're an operation-slope-private ship by me.
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:57:01.820]  I need, let me tell you something, money. A $1 to $100,000 to Soros is Trump's hand.
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:04.820]  But we've got to have the $1 seed money to trump him.
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:10.820]  With a few million dollars, we can 100% defeat even 50 more of these fake things and crush the enemy.
[01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:15.820]  But we know they are fully committed to take us down because we are attacking them at point-blank range.
[01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:21.820]  I need everybody to go donate. If you've never donated or never bought product, now is the time for you to get off the bench and in the game.
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:28.820]  We can't do it without you and I want total victory here. I want to go into the enemy and I want to be at ramming speed.
[01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:32.820]  Absolutely to ram down their throat with everything we've got.
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:36.820]  So, go to RogerStoneLegalDefenseFund.com.
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:38.820]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:42.820]  I tell you, it says a different thing here. I cannot have the real thing.
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:46.820]  Hell with Inner, it's Vortex and I wouldn't have it. I love it.
[01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:52.820]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia. You're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:57.820]  Hey, I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[01:57:57.820 --> 01:58:05.820]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and it had to load down the page on my dial-up internet.
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:10.820]  And I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:16.820]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2.
[01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:22.820]  The SuperMail Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, micro-ZX body. It's all amazing.
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:23.820]  Thank you, brother.
[01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:31.820]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:36.820]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:43.820]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:54.820]  We can't extend this free shipping sale much longer with our best-selling items at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:57.820]  In fact, we can only run it a few more days.
[01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:01.820]  We're also running out of some of our best-selling items like our amazing Neutropic Rain Force.
[01:59:01.820 --> 01:59:08.820]  It's $19.95. Leading competitors are $60 and aren't even as good. It's a great deal normally at $39.95.
[01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:11.820]  Rain Force, you've never tried it. This is a great opportunity.
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:19.820]  $19.95. Also, Alpha Power is 50% off. If you don't know what it's done for me and so many others for stamina, focus, libido.
[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:21.820]  It does so many things at X2.
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:26.820]  Even though we're having trouble sourcing the deep earth crystals of the good halogen iodine,
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:33.820]  I am blowing out the stockpile of it we have at least for another few days at 50% off.
[01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:37.820]  And then after that, it's going to go back to full price until we secure more of it.
[01:59:37.820 --> 01:59:42.820]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:57.820]  And thank you all for helping fund the Second American Global Revolution.
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:20.820]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:25.820]  Alright, it's StoneDefenseFund.com. There's like five other URLs. The crew is right as well.
[02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:29.820]  But that's the one that takes you to the easiest StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:33.820]  Everybody should go there and make a donation. The easiest thing to do is go to AlexJonesLegalFund.com.
[02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:38.820]  There's a big fat link right up there. We're going to go to your phone calls basically right now.
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:42.820]  I'm going to recap all the big news. And I'm not bitching. I'm not complaining here.
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:46.820]  It's just Hillary and all these globalists need to be defeated.
[02:00:46.820 --> 02:00:52.820]  And they realize that InfoWars and Roger Stone and others are creating the countervailing narrative
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:55.820]  and the talking points that are accurate versus their talking points that are lies.
[02:00:55.820 --> 02:01:01.820]  So they want to shut us down. The good news is I'm seeing our understanding of things duplicated everywhere now
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:09.820]  with even greater viciousness and truthfulness and just righteousness.
[02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:14.820]  And so we're important in the future on the fight, but I had a gut level at the say as well.
[02:01:14.820 --> 02:01:21.820]  Not the best way to raise money, but even if they destroy us, Roger, it will be a pyrrhic victory for them.
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:25.820]  Well, they're not going to destroy us, but more importantly, they're not going to destroy the country.
[02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:27.820]  But we're ready to be destroyed.
[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:32.820]  I'm ready to make sure Donald Trump succeeds and that this country is saved. That's the most important.
[02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:35.820]  But we're going on to the end. Well, we're going to fight to the bitter end. There's no question.
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:37.820]  Let's just say we are expendable.
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:40.820]  My wife would probably disagree with that, but yeah.
[02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:43.820]  But I mean, that's what we have to just say. We're expendable. We accept that.
[02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:47.820]  But we don't want that to happen. But it's up to you whether we're expendable or not,
[02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:50.820]  because the way they're coming at us is with legal and with dollar signs.
[02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:55.820]  And if they see you respond and they see us keep expanding, they are going to be demoralized
[02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:59.820]  and they're going to fall the wayside. Right now is massive rampage force.
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:00.820]  Go ahead.
[02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:05.820]  There's no question about it. Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingraham.
[02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:07.820]  Laura Ingraham, Angle and Five.
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.820]  By the way, let's save that. Let's find that. Go ahead.
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:15.820]  And I had done that show and show yesterday. I had done the war room.
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:20.820]  She's not on until 940 Central. That's 1040 Eastern. I was exhausted.
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:25.820]  I popped to Brainforce Plus and I was good as new.
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:31.820]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilizing, mentally energizing.
[02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:36.820]  It's at a great price now. I could never have done that broadcast last night.
[02:02:36.820 --> 02:02:40.820]  Tonight I'm on with Tucker Carlson. The same thing.
[02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:42.820]  I'm going to put in a full day here at Infowars.
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:46.820]  I'm going to go on with Tucker tonight. Thank goodness for this great product.
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:51.820]  You've got an extraordinary price on it here. This is my all-time favorite.
[02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:55.820]  And you are supporting the Infowar when you buy this stuff.
[02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:58.820]  But once you buy it, you will go to the auto ship.
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:02.820]  You will become a habitual user because it's so effective
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:06.820]  and it doesn't give you that jacked up energy drink feeling.
[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:10.820]  You know, you can sleep with it.
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:16.820]  We set out to say, what are the top new tropic companies putting out for $67?
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:18.820]  And they said, it's this. We talked to the top labs.
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:20.820]  Well, what would you do to make it stronger?
[02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:22.820]  Better? Well, we'd add this and take out that.
[02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:28.820]  And then when we sell it at $40, you know, we're making $25.
[02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:32.820]  When we're selling at $19.95, folks, we're making like $5 here.
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:37.820]  I'm telling you, Brainforce Plus at $19.95 is almost a lost leader.
[02:03:37.820 --> 02:03:40.820]  For auto ship, it basically is at this point.
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:42.820]  But why am I doing it?
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:47.820]  Because I know it's so good that once you try it and realize that stuff $60 isn't as good,
[02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:51.820]  you will become a habitual user of it and it's healthy and it's good and it's great.
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:57.820]  And when you stack it with the red pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[02:03:57.820 --> 02:04:00.820]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:03.820]  This is the best combination I have found.
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:06.820]  It takes mostly about a week for the real red pill to kick in.
[02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:11.820]  But it really works. It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found.
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:14.820]  And I've tried them all. I wasted a lot of money at Whole Foods, believe me.
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:16.820]  Here's the thing, came to it.
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:20.820]  At age 30, preglonone is a hormone precursor. It starts going down to everybody.
[02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:23.820]  And if you don't have it, your body can't make the hormones.
[02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:26.820]  So it's seen as a steroid precursor, but it's seen as legal, safe and everything.
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:28.820]  And I learned about this years ago from a medical doctor.
[02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:30.820]  He said, you want to lose weight? Take preglonone.
[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:36.820]  So I just said, why don't the ultimate formula, preglonone, with the vitamins and minerals, amino acids, with the preglonone?
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:38.820]  And so that's what you get with real red pill.
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:42.820]  Now we have red pill plus, if you want that, that has energy added to it as well.
[02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:46.820]  It's not as strong as BrainForce Plus, but there you go.
[02:04:46.820 --> 02:04:48.820]  Alright, I promise we're going to your phone call straight ahead.
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:05:01.820]  Roger Stone is in the cockpit.
[02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:22.820]  We're going to take a look at some of the most potent, clinically studied probiotic strains.
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:27.820]  When paired with carnivore, our incredible enzyme formula that helps you break down nutrients.
[02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:33.820]  These formulas fuel your gut and your body to help you fight toxins and stay fueled all day.
[02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:40.820]  These incredible formulas can help keep your body in tip-top shape in the fight against stress, age and outside toxins.
[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:46.820]  There's no better time to try fluorolife and carnivore to see how well they can support your body.
[02:05:46.820 --> 02:05:50.820]  Don't miss out on the chance to fuel your body and support recovery.
[02:05:50.820 --> 02:06:17.820]  Try the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack today.
[02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:22.820]  Alright, Roger Stone is riding shotgun with us right through into the next hour.
[02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:28.820]  And then I told him, he got up at 5 a.m. yesterday, he flew to Texas, did like six, seven hours with us,
[02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:32.820]  then went and did Laura Ingram at, you know, 9, 10 o'clock at night.
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:36.820]  Tonight he's on Tucker Carlson, one of my smartest guys out there.
[02:06:36.820 --> 02:06:41.820]  And so I told him, hey, you know, go take a nap today before this.
[02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:43.820]  He said, no, I got BrainForce.
[02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:47.820]  So I guess he'd forgotten to take some of that morning or hadn't flown with it.
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:48.820]  Well, he had plenty of it here.
[02:06:48.820 --> 02:06:49.820]  He said a big plug for it.
[02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:53.820]  It's 50% off right now because I want you to try it if you haven't tried.
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:59.820]  For the price, because you can get similar stuff at $60, $70, $80, you cannot get a better Neutropic.
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:01.820]  It's clean, it's good, it's amazing.
[02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:04.820]  Some of the stuff in it, they're trying to restrict in Europe.
[02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:05.820]  It is really amazing.
[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:08.820]  It's 1995 right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:11.820]  Almost 6,000 five-star reviews.
[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:17.820]  The Red Pill Plus goes with it great as well, or the regular Red Pill, the real Red Pill.
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:19.820]  It's all there at infowarstore.com.
[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:26.820]  We have free shipping and 50% off all of our best-selling products, but it's got to end Sunday or Monday.
[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:28.820]  In fact, I've got it in the X2.
[02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:29.820]  That's 50% off.
[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:33.820]  We've never done that, but I want people again to get off the fence, even though X2 is close to selling out,
[02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:39.820]  even though we still up the wire, have not secured another source of the pure iodine that they get in these oil rigs
[02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:42.820]  at between 7 and 12,000 feet.
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:43.820]  It's very hard to get.
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:48.820]  It goes with a DEA and get certification, even get it, because it's a precursor for methamphetamine.
[02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:50.820]  It does not have the methamphetamine effect.
[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:57.820]  That's totally legal, but pure atomic iodine that's not bound is what they use to make a bunch of drugs.
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:07:59.820]  I guess LSD, methamphetamine, you name it.
[02:07:59.820 --> 02:08:03.820]  It's one of the precursors, and so it's highly controlled.
[02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:08.820]  It's even got to be in a big locked-up facility inside the manufacturing facility.
[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:13.820]  Everything's certified, and so the oil companies are weird about selling it to you,
[02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:19.820]  and again, we just lucked into this because we had a seaweed source that was the cleanest you'd get,
[02:08:19.820 --> 02:08:22.820]  but it was still bound with the stuff that's in the ocean.
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:29.820]  There was different types of iodine, but it's always sodium iodine, calcium iodine, this iodine.
[02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:35.820]  There's a whole bunch of different types, but it's bound, and it doesn't get absorbed and also to hurt your stomach.
[02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:38.820]  There's 999999.
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:40.820]  It's essentially atomic.
[02:08:40.820 --> 02:08:42.820]  That doesn't mean radioactive.
[02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:45.820]  There are 6,000 plus five-star reviews.
[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:47.820]  It means it's on the periodic table.
[02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:51.820]  It is, and it's like when BuzzFeed had it tested by Mark Cuban's company.
[02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:52.820]  They said, it's weird.
[02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:55.820]  It's not all these different types we've all heard of.
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:58.820]  You take this for nuclear war, you take that, or you take it.
[02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:01.820]  No, it's pure iodine.
[02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:05.820]  Oh, yes, it's the only one they've ever tested.
[02:09:05.820 --> 02:09:07.820]  It's pure iodine.
[02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:08.820]  Look at it.
[02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:10.820]  It's purple crystals.
[02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:17.820]  If you put it on the ground above 89 degrees, it turns into like I dream of genie purple gas.
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:19.820]  It eats holes in concrete.
[02:09:19.820 --> 02:09:25.820]  Now, it doesn't hurt your body because it's put into a gaseous form and injected into the palm oil.
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:30.820]  All I know is it makes me really a bomb because working out super hard, I couldn't lose weight.
[02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:32.820]  I hardly even work out anymore, even though I should.
[02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:36.820]  I'm way less than I did 10 years ago, and I'm telling you, the X2 changed my life.
[02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:38.820]  Okay, we're going to your phone calls.
[02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:45.820]  We've got Tommy Robinson spokesperson popping in as well with an update, and it just gets worse and worse.
[02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:49.820]  A political prisoner, and we've got Manafort sent as a political prisoner today.
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:55.820]  You've got Tommy moved to the Muslim wing of the prison, 70% Muslim, 70 plus percent.
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:09:57.820]  First, the media tried to deny this.
[02:09:57.820 --> 02:09:58.820]  It even happened.
[02:09:58.820 --> 02:09:59.820]  Now, it's all over the British news.
[02:09:59.820 --> 02:10:03.820]  Again, the only reason it's in the British news is because we reported it and drudged link to it two days ago
[02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:06.820]  and kept it at the top for two days until the media was forced to report it.
[02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:09.820]  Instead, the media was saying we'd made it up for the first two days.
[02:10:09.820 --> 02:10:11.820]  That's why we're so critical, Roger.
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:15.820]  This is a story that is hard to understand.
[02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:20.820]  Here you have the United Kingdom, the seat of American jurisprudence, the...
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:21.820]  The Fount.
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:23.820]  The Fount, the Magna Carta.
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:30.820]  And this kind of harassment, this kind of...
[02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:31.820]  I don't know.
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:32.820]  It's totalitarianism.
[02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:33.820]  It's Nazism.
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:37.820]  They're going to destroy and kill this man because he stands up for freedom.
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:39.820]  It's unbelievable.
[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:43.820]  It's just hard to fathom that this could be happening in a civilized country.
[02:10:43.820 --> 02:10:45.820]  I mean, I was setting up infill wars with him.
[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:48.820]  We're still trying to do it over there.
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:53.820]  He told me, if I go to jail, Kaelin is who you talk to, he's my spokesperson.
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:54.820]  I keep my wife out of this.
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:56.820]  Then we have Kaelin on.
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:10:58.820]  People are like, oh, that's not really a spokesman.
[02:10:58.820 --> 02:11:00.820]  Remember the first three days?
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:01.820]  He's not even in jail.
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:02.820]  This is made up.
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:04.820]  That's a media tactic when it's hot.
[02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:06.820]  Oh, Tommy Robinson didn't get arrested.
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:07.820]  He hasn't been sent anywhere.
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:09.820]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:10.820]  They play these mind games.
[02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:12.820]  Like, oh, we weren't ever spying on Trump.
[02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:13.820]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:15.820]  We're going to go to some phone calls.
[02:11:15.820 --> 02:11:18.820]  I usually plug like once an hour for 60 seconds.
[02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:19.820]  We need to raise money.
[02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:21.820]  We got great products you need.
[02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:23.820]  And we've got legal defense funds.
[02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:25.820]  Tell people there's a lot of URLs that go the same place.
[02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:28.820]  But there's a lot of folks out there claiming they're raising money for you who aren't Roger.
[02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:31.820]  They can go to Alex Jones legal fund.com.
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:33.820]  There's a link to your legal fund on there.
[02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:36.820]  Or how do folks go directly to your legal fund?
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:46.820]  StoneDefenseFund.com, StoneDefenseFund.com, you know Alex, my grandson, Nick Stevens, asked me if he could set up a GoFundMe for me because he sees what I'm going through.
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:56.820]  And I said, sure, he was immediately ridiculed by Buzzfeed, by Media 8, because he loves his grandfather, because he doesn't like what's happening to our family.
[02:11:56.820 --> 02:11:57.820]  It is outrageous.
[02:11:57.820 --> 02:11:58.820]  So, StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:11:59.820]  Oh, that's what happened to me.
[02:11:59.820 --> 02:12:00.820]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:01.820]  Staying in good.
[02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:02.820]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:12:02.820 --> 02:12:06.820]  We haven't even made a deal out of this, because this will be national news.
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:08.820]  We've gone to three of the big funding groups.
[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:13.820]  Before we even set it up and they see who it is, they say you violate our terms and we're banned.
[02:12:13.820 --> 02:12:21.820]  So again, they won't even let us go out just like Obama targeted more than 10,000 Christian charities and had them banned or attacked by the IRS,
[02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:28.820]  Patriot groups, veterans groups, gun groups, all attacked, all shut down, all had their 501C3 or other forms stripped.
[02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:32.820]  And the media said, oh, good, they deserve it at the Tea Party.
[02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:36.820]  Now, they won't even let me go online and fund money.
[02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:42.820]  They won't even let me go out and start a GoFundMe or any other platform out there.
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:45.820]  This is like putting the Jews in the ghettos first.
[02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:48.820]  I know what my legal bills are like.
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:53.820]  I can't even imagine what yours are like, given the various jurisdictions where they're trying to take you down.
[02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:58.820]  This can run to millions of dollars to save info wars and save your reputation.
[02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:01.820]  And they're well healed. Make no mistake about it. They have plenty of money.
[02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:06.820]  I don't want to give too much of the strategy away, but I was expecting this to happen for a long time.
[02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:10.820]  I didn't expect them to fall 20. The good news is 10 have been thrown out.
[02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:19.820]  Throwing the 10 out has cost about $370,000 last time I checked a few weeks ago.
[02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:23.820]  Here's the problem. Those were all the overly ridiculous. I mean, cuckoo land.
[02:13:23.820 --> 02:13:29.820]  Now the others are still BS, but they're much more serious where individual ones will cost that much.
[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:32.820]  So they want to cripple us so we don't do the expansion.
[02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:34.820]  And then they want to start squeezing us.
[02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:37.820]  So for a while, again, I didn't have the private jet.
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:44.820]  A lot of times I fly coach. I nested things away, which is one issue.
[02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:46.820]  I'm not going to get into it.
[02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:50.820]  So we could deal with this. So we have emergency fuel to make the jump level.
[02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:53.820]  So when we go in, we're going in full throttle against them.
[02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:55.820]  It's just that I can project out.
[02:13:55.820 --> 02:14:00.820]  And so we need to start gaining fuel for the next move after that.
[02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:05.820]  And I've got a few aces up my sleeve, but it'll really encourage us.
[02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:07.820]  People just flood us with money. Go ahead.
[02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:10.820]  You know what's really insidious? Somebody goes up and puts up on line.
[02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:13.820]  You can find it. Roger Stone is worth $20 million.
[02:14:13.820 --> 02:14:16.820]  No, I'm not. Not even close. I'm not a millionaire.
[02:14:16.820 --> 02:14:18.820]  They say they do the same lies to me.
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:20.820]  They do that so people don't give us.
[02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:23.820]  Why should I send you money, Stone? You're a millionaire. No, I'm not.
[02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:27.820]  That's disinformation that is meant to discourage people from donating.
[02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:29.820]  Don't believe it, folks. It's BS.
[02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:32.820]  Well, I mean, I am a multi-millionaire on the taxes,
[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:35.820]  because I don't do this offshore stuff like all the big globalists do,
[02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:38.820]  because they wouldn't let me. Only globalists could do that.
[02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:41.820]  The equipment in this building, and when I have to pay on income tax,
[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:44.820]  and to pay on state, they really have an income tax in Texas.
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:47.820]  It's this franchise tax, and they've got like an equipment tax.
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:49.820]  Whatever's in the warehouse at the end of the year,
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:51.820]  I've got to pay for every piece of equipment, everything.
[02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:53.820]  And Obama got rid of a bunch of the ride-offs.
[02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:59.820]  So I'm supposedly worth $4 million because of the equipment here.
[02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:03.820]  Well, I couldn't sell this equipment for $1 million now the way it depreciates.
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:05.820]  But yeah, it's $4 million worth of equipment.
[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:06.820]  That's what real equipment costs.
[02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:09.820]  One real big board costs a couple hundred thousand dollars.
[02:15:09.820 --> 02:15:11.820]  Well, we can't run infowars without it.
[02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:12.820]  But that's what I'm saying.
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:16.820]  So on paper, it's insane.
[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:17.820]  I'm trying to get accountants involved.
[02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:19.820]  It just drives me completely insane.
[02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:21.820]  So that's what I'm saying. Absolutely.
[02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:23.820]  What I'm after is winning against the globalist.
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:26.820]  And I want capital and money to get more reporters, more crew.
[02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:28.820]  Look how great Owen is. Look at the other people.
[02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:30.820]  All right, we're going to come back right to your phone calls, I promise.
[02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:36.820]  Phil, Pastor Sam, Josh, Jason, Hitman, Tim, Patrick, and others.

[02:15:46.820 --> 02:15:48.820]  We had that from the U.S. Army.

[02:20:25.820 --> 02:20:31.820]  I am taking over the fourth hour today to take your phone calls.
[02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:37.820]  I was going to go directly to him right now, but Tommy Robinson spokesman needs to come on earlier.
[02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:38.820]  He's in the street in London.
[02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:39.820]  Big developments.
[02:20:39.820 --> 02:20:40.820]  Taylor Robertson.
[02:20:40.820 --> 02:20:42.820]  So we're going to talk to him for this segment.
[02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:43.820]  A little bit of the next.
[02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:47.820]  And I promise we're going to take like 20 year phone calls with Roger Stone about how's Trump doing?
[02:20:47.820 --> 02:20:49.820]  What do you make of the IG report?
[02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:51.820]  North Korea.
[02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:54.820]  I mean, are we thankful for how things have turned around?
[02:20:54.820 --> 02:20:55.820]  I know I sure am.
[02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:57.820]  I wasn't just a negative person before.
[02:20:57.820 --> 02:20:58.820]  I didn't like what the globalists were doing.
[02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:00.820]  We're taking the country back.
[02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:01.820]  History is happening.
[02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:03.820]  And we're such an instant gratification society.
[02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:07.820]  Even a lot of Trump supporters, I know are like, well, he's the guy we needed.
[02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:08.820]  He's a wrecking ball.
[02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:09.820]  He's not perfect.
[02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:19.820]  You know, man, I've sacrificed a lot, but nothing like Tommy Robinson, a political prisoner who they now admit was moved into a Muslim wing and who they are.
[02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:26.820]  He's been who they are saying they're going to kill him and there is an Imam putting the fat to wild and only drudge picked this up two days ago.
[02:21:26.820 --> 02:21:33.820]  Three days ago, the media was saying I made it up, Roger, and it really frustrates me that they're like this.
[02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:42.820]  We broke that Hillary server was broken into from international intelligence sources and Colonel Schaefer in January of 2016.
[02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:46.820]  That's why they hate us because we are so truthful, Roger.
[02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:47.820]  It's extraordinary.
[02:21:47.820 --> 02:22:01.820]  You could expect this to be happening in a in a Muslim country in a Middle Eastern country that is happening in the UK just boggles the mind and the silence of the national media of the mainstream media with the exception of drudge.
[02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:03.820]  It's extraordinary.
[02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:07.820]  Without drudge, you wouldn't even know that I was banned on YouTube.
[02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:12.820]  Then when they reinstated, as Bloomberg said, it was a mutiny, someone did without authorization.
[02:22:12.820 --> 02:22:14.820]  How sensational is that without?
[02:22:14.820 --> 02:22:16.820]  I don't mean to kiss drudges, but it's true.
[02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:21.820]  Without drudge, he's the guy that continues to be the final domino to break open the wall.
[02:22:21.820 --> 02:22:23.820]  He does have enormous reach.
[02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:28.820]  It reminds me of when they said, oh, no, we didn't turn off Sean Hannity's Twitter feed.
[02:22:28.820 --> 02:22:33.820]  Some guy poured spilled Coca-Cola on the on the control board.
[02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:34.820]  It was all a mistake.
[02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:38.820]  And what they're doing is testing it to get us just worn out of hearing about it until they finally ban you or Milo.
[02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:48.820]  Let's go for this segment and then part of the next, we're going to write the calls to Kalen Robertson and he joins us right now on the street.
[02:22:48.820 --> 02:22:51.820]  Again, he had the bravery to go on the air with no one else would.
[02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:52.820]  He's Tommy Spokesperson.
[02:22:52.820 --> 02:22:55.820]  Tommy told me that directly before he even went to jail about a week before.
[02:22:55.820 --> 02:22:59.820]  Tommy is fighting for his life right now in the Muslim wing.
[02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:02.820]  The media spends it and goes, well, it's a Muslim wing.
[02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:05.820]  The whole prison isn't 70%, only that wing.
[02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:13.820]  So they've picked a Islamic prison with a Muslim wing to throw in Tommy Robinson and he's got new developments for us.
[02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:16.820]  Kalen, thank you for joining us and giving us updates.
[02:23:16.820 --> 02:23:21.820]  It's good to see his lawyers coming out confirming everything you said a day after you said it.
[02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:23.820]  Yeah, thanks so much for having us as well.
[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:25.820]  And thank you so much for covering all of this stuff.
[02:23:25.820 --> 02:23:27.820]  Sorry, it's just very busy in London.
[02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:29.820]  We're trying to do this period really quickly right now.
[02:23:29.820 --> 02:23:35.820]  So basically the news reports that you've just been talking about, completely insane.
[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:39.820]  They said that it was 70% made up, nothing out of nowhere.
[02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:42.820]  Tommy told us directly that it looked like that.
[02:23:42.820 --> 02:23:46.820]  It looked about 70% on his wing and they were saying, oh, well, there's no such thing as a 70% Muslim.
[02:23:46.820 --> 02:23:48.820]  So that whole thing's nonsense.
[02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:53.820]  But they're using their usual tactics to try to discredit everything that we're doing and to try to discredit all of the facts.
[02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:55.820]  To try and brush it all over and say that nothing is actually wrong.
[02:23:55.820 --> 02:24:00.820]  So obviously reiterating our phone call a couple of days ago, the facts are still the same.
[02:24:00.820 --> 02:24:04.820]  We have had a little bit of communication since then and he still is okay.
[02:24:04.820 --> 02:24:07.820]  However, I can reconfirm everything we spoke about the other night.
[02:24:07.820 --> 02:24:10.820]  He was moved to a really dangerous prison.
[02:24:10.820 --> 02:24:12.820]  It was really bad.
[02:24:12.820 --> 02:24:14.820]  It has a much higher Muslim population.
[02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:21.820]  It's actually got a record of having terrible violent crime if you look it up as well.
[02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:24.820]  He's actually just been moved to solitary confinement.
[02:24:24.820 --> 02:24:29.820]  And he's sort of in a room with a blue mat on the floor, completely bizarre.
[02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:32.820]  So we know that at least he's safe in that period for now.
[02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:37.820]  But because he's in that situation, it means that communication is going to be a little bit more difficult in the meantime.
[02:24:37.820 --> 02:24:40.820]  So we don't know if he's going to be immediately put back into that really dangerous wing.
[02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:44.820]  We don't know if he's going to be shoved to another prison that's even more dangerous.
[02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:46.820]  Those threats have been passed on to him.
[02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:49.820]  But what we do know is obviously that he's been moved there.
[02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:51.820]  He's been moved to a more dangerous situation.
[02:24:51.820 --> 02:24:54.820]  It wasn't by the governors. It wasn't by the prison guards.
[02:24:54.820 --> 02:24:57.820]  It wasn't by any usual process that normally takes place in a prison like this.
[02:24:57.820 --> 02:25:02.820]  It was sent down straight from the top, from the home office, completely unprecedented.
[02:25:02.820 --> 02:25:04.820]  These things don't normally happen.
[02:25:04.820 --> 02:25:07.820]  And that's why we've got so many people now writing to the home office.
[02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:10.820]  So much pressure from people in America trying to say,
[02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:11.820]  what on earth are you doing?
[02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:16.820]  You're basically putting someone in the firing line with direct orders from the top.
[02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:17.820]  It doesn't make any sense.
[02:25:17.820 --> 02:25:19.820]  And those are the new developments.
[02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:21.820]  And that's the bombshell news.
[02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:23.820]  It's up on infowars.com.
[02:25:23.820 --> 02:25:25.820]  Thank God drudging to it last night.
[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:28.820]  Order to send Tommy Robinson to heavily Muslim populated prison
[02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:35.820]  came from the top activist safety and dangerous result of high risk status being removed from his file.
[02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:39.820]  And now you say that they've thrown him back in solitary confinement,
[02:25:39.820 --> 02:25:45.820]  which is more cruel and unusual punishment for reporting that there was a trial on Muslim grooming gangs,
[02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:47.820]  which even the media reported on.
[02:25:47.820 --> 02:25:49.820]  The trial itself.
[02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:55.820]  And so 13 months in the Islamic wing, a certain death sentence or 13 months in solitary confinement,
[02:25:55.820 --> 02:25:58.820]  silencing him, being able to talk to you every few days.
[02:25:58.820 --> 02:26:05.820]  So I guess you haven't been able to talk to him since you talked to him on Tuesday and gave us that emergency message.
[02:26:05.820 --> 02:26:09.820]  No, it seemed like they really weren't happy about that information going out and they seem to cut off a lot of things.
[02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:14.820]  We have had some communication, but not directly between him and I that he is actually still safe and he's okay.
[02:26:14.820 --> 02:26:17.820]  But they're really clamping down on the information that's coming out.
[02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:19.820]  He doesn't want him talking to the outside world.
[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:21.820]  He doesn't want any, they don't want any fuss being made.
[02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:23.820]  They don't want you doing what you're doing.
[02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:25.820]  They don't want judge putting it on the front page.
[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:27.820]  They want it to be a nothing burger.
[02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:30.820]  They tried to silence it as soon as he got in prison prison as we know, but that didn't work.
[02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:33.820]  And now they're trying to say that it's all nonsense because the statistics are slightly off,
[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:35.820]  but that's what they're trying to do.
[02:26:35.820 --> 02:26:38.820]  So they don't want any information coming out about him because it builds up a frenzy.
[02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:41.820]  It gets people upset to get people up rightfully.
[02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:44.820]  And so the next stages are basically going through the legal process.
[02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:47.820]  That's what we're doing now and doing everything we can to make sure that he's not in that situation,
[02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:51.820]  but he can have communications with the outside world because he wants this information to get out.
[02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:55.820]  He told me directly on Tuesday the facts that he told me he wanted out immediately as fast as possible
[02:26:55.820 --> 02:27:00.820]  because if anything does happen to him and he's at massive risk, he wants the world to know exactly what's going on.
[02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:03.820]  And he knows people are listening.
[02:27:03.820 --> 02:27:10.820]  And again, when he first got arrested, for three days there was a D notice where the media couldn't report he was arrested
[02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:13.820]  and they had news saying, I made that up and you made that up.
[02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:15.820]  Then they confirmed that.
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:17.820]  Then they had an order not to cover the demonstrations.
[02:27:17.820 --> 02:27:21.820]  I mean, this is so authoritarian what the UK is becoming.
[02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:24.820]  And now Roger and I are talking about being political prisoners.
[02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:25.820]  We're under attack.
[02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:28.820]  Paul Manafort has been grabbed and put in jail today.
[02:27:28.820 --> 02:27:31.820]  I mean, this is really wild.
[02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:34.820]  People don't seem to realize that it's going to happen to them next.
[02:27:34.820 --> 02:27:37.820]  It's bizarre because it's Tommy and because he's perceived as extreme.
[02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:40.820]  He's saying, of course, he's getting thrown away. He looks a little bit rough, doesn't he?
[02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:42.820]  He looks like he's capable of that.
[02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:44.820]  But after Tommy, it's going to come for you.
[02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:45.820]  It's going to come for everybody else.
[02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:46.820]  It's going to come for people in the middle.
[02:27:46.820 --> 02:27:51.820]  It's going to come from anyone who's even slightly dissident and who has said anything even slightly against the government
[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:54.820]  or the PC policies or anything that's been going on in the last sort of 10 years in Britain.
[02:27:54.820 --> 02:27:59.820]  And they don't realize how creeping this process is and how slow and how creeping it is.
[02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:00.820]  And they don't care.
[02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:01.820]  It's so blatant as well.
[02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:02.820]  They'll just make him disappear.
[02:28:02.820 --> 02:28:05.820]  One second, Tommy's on the street bringing the facts he's got millions of views.
[02:28:05.820 --> 02:28:09.820]  He's in a public spotlight. The next second, he's in a room for 23 hours a day on a mat on the floor.
[02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:12.820]  They make people disappear within seconds and they can still get away with it.
[02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:14.820]  Well, just about. We'll see what's going to happen soon.
[02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:19.820]  But it's absolutely battling how blatant and open.
[02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:23.820]  Let's talk about what we can do and just what's happening in the UK.
[02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:24.820]  We come back. Go ahead.
[02:28:24.820 --> 02:28:25.820]  We need to pray.
[02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:28.820]  We need to lift Tommy Robinson up with prayer.
[02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:31.820]  All the Info Warriors, we need to be praying for his safety right now.
[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:32.820]  Let's pray for him when we come back.
[02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:33.820]  I think it's important.
[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:34.820]  Absolutely.
[02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:35.820]  This is number one, folks.
[02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:37.820]  It's absolutely number one.
[02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:39.820]  We talked about this the other day.
[02:28:39.820 --> 02:28:40.820]  It's true.
[02:28:40.820 --> 02:28:42.820]  There are no atheists in foxholes.
[02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:43.820]  And my head is spinning.
[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:45.820]  And we're going to all your phone calls.
[02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:47.820]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:48.820]  Wow.
[02:28:48.820 --> 02:28:51.820]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails.
[02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:54.820]  And those that cry to peas-a-peas are hung by those they tried to please.
[02:28:54.820 --> 02:28:58.820]  We call it the crapper, water closet, outhouse or bathroom.
[02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:00.820]  But where do you go when there's nowhere to go?
[02:29:00.820 --> 02:29:02.820]  The answer is the Biffy Bag.
[02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:05.820]  The Biffy Bag is a pocket-sized disposable toilet
[02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:09.820]  that fits in your glove box, tackle box, toolbox, backpack or purse.
[02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:13.820]  The Biffy Bag has everything you need for a sanitary and comfortable relief experience.
[02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:15.820]  It's ready to use in just seconds.
[02:29:15.820 --> 02:29:17.820]  And just toss it in the trash when you're done.
[02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:19.820]  It's your Biffy in a Jiffy.
[02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:20.820]  BiffyBag.com.

[02:34:48.820 --> 02:35:17.820]  BiffyBag.com
[02:35:18.820 --> 02:35:22.420]  That's what Tommy chose you to do that we were honored.
[02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:23.420]  There you are.
[02:35:23.420 --> 02:35:28.140]  Everybody should follow you at Kailin Robb on Twitter so they can actually get the unvarnished
[02:35:28.140 --> 02:35:33.340]  unfiltered information from Tommy who has a fatal out on him.
[02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:36.340]  Let's talk about that E-mom Drudge link to that story yesterday.
[02:35:36.340 --> 02:35:41.460]  Let's give us the latest on that and then talk about how folks can support Tommy because
[02:35:41.460 --> 02:35:43.340]  we're not going to let people forget about him.
[02:35:43.340 --> 02:35:44.340]  That's what they hope happens.
[02:35:44.340 --> 02:35:49.620]  Yeah, I think they got a little bit lost in translation on Tuesday but seriously that
[02:35:49.620 --> 02:35:51.660]  story is actually completely significant.
[02:35:51.660 --> 02:35:57.580]  So when Tommy arrived he realized that the head E-mom of that prison had known about his
[02:35:57.580 --> 02:36:01.260]  arrival two days before he got there.
[02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:04.420]  Now none of the prison guards knew and then none of the governors knew.
[02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:08.700]  None of the governors in the previous prison knew or the previous prison guards knew.
[02:36:08.700 --> 02:36:12.740]  Nobody knew about his move except for the E-mom of that prison.
[02:36:12.740 --> 02:36:13.740]  That doesn't make any sense.
[02:36:13.740 --> 02:36:17.620]  And that's what was such a massive story about this because the orders came from the top
[02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:20.500]  and the E-mom knew about it which doesn't make any sense.
[02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:24.180]  And so he was going around telling everybody two days before that he was going to be arriving
[02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:28.780]  which Tommy said gives them enough time to prepare weapons which gives them that's an
[02:36:28.780 --> 02:36:33.180]  old prison tactic to tell a certain profile whether it's a gangster or someone from a
[02:36:33.180 --> 02:36:37.380]  rival gang that's about to arrive to say that they're about to arrive within 48 hours and
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:41.460]  that gives them enough time to I think it's toilet paper and knives and things like that
[02:36:41.460 --> 02:36:46.500]  to be able to pull everything together to basically formulate a plan to attack them.
[02:36:46.500 --> 02:36:47.740]  And that's what it was about.
[02:36:47.740 --> 02:36:52.300]  And this is why it's such a scandal because who on earth was it that passed that information
[02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:55.220]  down to the E-mom of the prison that he was going to arrive.
[02:36:55.220 --> 02:36:59.180]  That was so much above the governors who knew about it.
[02:36:59.180 --> 02:37:00.180]  It doesn't really make any sense.
[02:37:00.180 --> 02:37:01.940]  And that's what's so shocking about it.
[02:37:01.940 --> 02:37:06.500]  Obviously it's somebody who's been colluding with the high-profile amounts of Muslim of
[02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:07.500]  Britain.
[02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:08.700]  That's what it looks like the situation is.
[02:37:08.700 --> 02:37:13.380]  It's someone who's colluding who knows information that the rest of us seem not to, who's passed
[02:37:13.380 --> 02:37:17.380]  down the orders or who knows the person who's passed down the orders to have him moved on.
[02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:21.540]  It's completely bizarre but you know I don't normally divulge into conspiracy theories but
[02:37:21.540 --> 02:37:26.580]  there is no other reasonable outcome or thought process that you can come to when you look
[02:37:26.580 --> 02:37:27.580]  at the facts.
[02:37:27.580 --> 02:37:28.580]  And you've got Sadiq Khan there.
[02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:34.300]  Tell us about the Islamist's home secretary, the guy that is running all this.
[02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:37.500]  Oh well it's been a complete mess as soon as he was taken in.
[02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:39.420]  It seems to be a very, very sketchy character.
[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:42.860]  He's been going after right-wing and conservative personalities for decades ever since he's
[02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:43.860]  been involved in politics.
[02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:45.100]  He's been going after all of them.
[02:37:45.100 --> 02:37:46.660]  He's been going on about hate speech.
[02:37:46.660 --> 02:37:48.340]  He despises Tommy Robinson.
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:52.660]  I think he's actually mentioned something about this case and he is happy about the fact
[02:37:52.660 --> 02:37:57.700]  that right-wingers being oppressed in Britain and they're being silenced and pushed away.
[02:37:57.700 --> 02:38:03.220]  He is basically a replica of Sadiq Khan totally in bed together, totally colluding together.
[02:38:03.220 --> 02:38:10.580]  It's the same sort of cancerous infestation that's come into our political system and
[02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:16.460]  our government in the last sort of 10 years, this really awful, highly censored ideology
[02:38:16.460 --> 02:38:21.260]  that despises anybody who speaks out against Islam and despises anybody who even resembles
[02:38:21.260 --> 02:38:22.260]  Tommy Robinson.
[02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:26.660]  I absolutely believe that he has something directly to do with this, directly to do with
[02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:27.660]  Tommy being moved.
[02:38:27.660 --> 02:38:31.460]  That didn't come from Tommy that came from me by the way but yeah, the whole thing absolutely
[02:38:31.460 --> 02:38:32.460]  stinks.
[02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:35.540]  And I want to be clear, there has been a golden era of Islam.
[02:38:35.540 --> 02:38:37.220]  They invented a lot of stuff in those countries.
[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:39.460]  The people a lot of them are smart.
[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:44.660]  But the biggest group getting killed by radical Islam are Muslims and these guys are all allied
[02:38:44.660 --> 02:38:45.660]  with it.
[02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:50.300]  The UK brings in former ISIS fighters, al-Qaeda, pays for their houses, there is a red carpet
[02:38:50.300 --> 02:38:55.060]  all over Europe, the most radical Islamists because they want to use them as the muscle
[02:38:55.060 --> 02:38:56.060]  and the enforcers.
[02:38:56.060 --> 02:39:02.700]  So Tommy Robinson dot online, is that the best place, the proper place for people that
[02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:03.700]  want to donate?
[02:39:03.700 --> 02:39:06.420]  That's the best place to do it.
[02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:10.140]  There are a couple of other sites actually who have just started working with Tommy's
[02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:12.820]  family to raise money for them specifically.
[02:39:12.820 --> 02:39:15.100]  I think Rebel Media has just done one.
[02:39:15.100 --> 02:39:20.800]  Those are also actually authorized but their main, main site is Tommy Robinson dot online
[02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:27.660]  slash the port that goes directly to his legal defense fund to fight the, to fight the princesses
[02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:30.620]  and to get him out as soon as possible.
[02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:31.620]  So that's the best.
[02:39:31.620 --> 02:39:32.620]  That's right.
[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:33.900]  I don't want to just get into negative news here.
[02:39:33.900 --> 02:39:34.900]  Tommy chose this.
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:35.900]  He's a hero.
[02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:37.300]  We're backing him to the hill.
[02:39:37.300 --> 02:39:42.860]  But we've got, Soros getting thrown out of his command base in Hungary.
[02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:47.220]  You've got major anti-globalist movements everywhere, Italy's pulling out.
[02:39:47.220 --> 02:39:48.220]  The EU is unelected.
[02:39:48.220 --> 02:39:49.220]  It's falling apart.
[02:39:49.220 --> 02:39:53.100]  We're in full panic mode, nationalism's exploding, Trump's winning.
[02:39:53.100 --> 02:39:56.780]  Those of us that are low hanging fruit though that aren't protected like Trump is to a certain
[02:39:56.780 --> 02:40:01.700]  extent are, are, are going to take the wrath of the zombie forces.
[02:40:01.700 --> 02:40:08.500]  So they want to take out Trump's resistance command that brought him into power.
[02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:10.900]  They don't understand Trump's already moved light years ahead of that.
[02:40:10.900 --> 02:40:15.180]  We're important for the future in the midterms and everything we do because that'll only
[02:40:15.180 --> 02:40:16.660]  embolden if they can take us down.
[02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:23.020]  We're still critical, but I want to explain that we are expendable and that we've already
[02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:24.860]  moved past that and we've already had victory.
[02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:28.620]  So no matter what they do to us and if they kill Tommy, God loves him.
[02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:32.100]  He's going to heaven and, and, and you know, the same time and we should fight for his
[02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:33.100]  life.
[02:40:33.100 --> 02:40:35.660]  But understand, we shouldn't let them demoralize us if they destroy me.
[02:40:35.660 --> 02:40:36.660]  They destroy Roger.
[02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:37.820]  They destroy him.
[02:40:37.820 --> 02:40:38.820]  We're men.
[02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:39.820]  We chose this.
[02:40:39.820 --> 02:40:40.820]  We're not complaining about it.
[02:40:40.820 --> 02:40:42.380]  We want to live.
[02:40:42.380 --> 02:40:43.380]  He's got grandkids.
[02:40:43.380 --> 02:40:44.380]  I've got children.
[02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:46.700]  I want to move on and live to be 150.
[02:40:46.700 --> 02:40:51.060]  I'll never commit suicide, but the big move is standing up the globalist.
[02:40:51.060 --> 02:40:52.060]  So we're winning.
[02:40:52.060 --> 02:40:55.540]  Our sacrifice has not been in vain and illiteracy to know you are the victory.
[02:40:55.540 --> 02:40:57.060]  You're the tip of the spear funding us.
[02:40:57.060 --> 02:41:00.140]  There's no place you can fund better than info wars.
[02:41:00.140 --> 02:41:02.900]  We donated these guys $20,000 equipment.
[02:41:02.900 --> 02:41:06.100]  You name it, because there's no better place than Tommy Robinson.
[02:41:06.100 --> 02:41:07.580]  We are the cutting edge.
[02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:11.980]  So infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three,

[02:41:15.940 --> 02:41:16.940]  shipping.
[02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:17.940]  That's all got to end this weekend, folks.
[02:41:17.940 --> 02:41:22.060]  I've been sending it for a week to do this emergency broadcast with the IG report, infowarstore.com,
[02:41:22.060 --> 02:41:23.060]  infowarslife.com.
[02:41:23.060 --> 02:41:27.020]  Try the super blue fluoride free toothpaste, four to five with iodine and colloidal silver.
[02:41:27.020 --> 02:41:29.060]  It's amazing for children and adults.
[02:41:29.060 --> 02:41:34.140]  The immune gargle, the colloidal silver, it's all there.
[02:41:34.140 --> 02:41:38.140]  But donate straight up so, because a lot of these products were making like $5 on there,
[02:41:38.140 --> 02:41:39.140]  so discount it.
[02:41:39.140 --> 02:41:43.300]  Go to our legal defense fund, alexjoneslegalfund.com.
[02:41:43.300 --> 02:41:46.860]  There's a link to the authorized place there for Roger Stone.
[02:41:46.860 --> 02:41:49.540]  As well, give them that address one more time, Roger.
[02:41:49.540 --> 02:41:50.540]  Stonedefund.com.
[02:41:50.540 --> 02:41:51.540]  All right.
[02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:54.380]  We're going to go to break and I promise the next segment and throughout the entire
[02:41:54.380 --> 02:41:57.420]  next hour, Joel Gilbert's a great guy, but I preempted him easy.
[02:41:57.420 --> 02:41:58.420]  He understands.
[02:41:58.420 --> 02:42:00.820]  He can come back on later, the show if he wants to do the stuff he was going to do.
[02:42:00.820 --> 02:42:04.500]  But I want to take your calls as promised and get more into the IG report.
[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:06.460]  Kailin, I know you got to go.
[02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:07.460]  Thank you so much.
[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:08.460]  We really appreciate you.
[02:42:08.460 --> 02:42:09.460]  Okay, folks.
[02:42:09.460 --> 02:42:11.420]  So there you go.
[02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:17.380]  A very historic time to be alive and I promise you start your engines, Phil, Pastor Sam,
[02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:25.420]  Josh, Jason, Hitman, Ron, Tim Wilde, Alyssa, Susan, and others in the order the calls
[02:42:25.420 --> 02:42:26.420]  are coming in.
[02:42:26.420 --> 02:42:31.220]  We're going boom, boom, bam, bam, bam when we return.
[02:42:31.220 --> 02:42:34.980]  But it doesn't feel good to be in this fight to know we're not just getting our butt kicked.
[02:42:34.980 --> 02:42:38.180]  We're winning the football game even though we're bloody, but the other guy's bloody worse,
[02:42:38.180 --> 02:42:41.780]  Roger, and to see Trump starting to hit on all cylinders, it gives me a lot of hope.
[02:42:41.780 --> 02:42:45.820]  Well, because the movement's bigger than Alex Jones or Roger Stoner, even Donald Trump,
[02:42:45.820 --> 02:42:47.780]  and the movement will never be stopped.
[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:50.740]  When we come back, we'll say that prayer for Tommy and then go to calls.
[02:42:50.740 --> 02:42:51.740]  I forgot to do that.
[02:42:51.740 --> 02:42:52.740]  We're going to do that.
[02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:55.380]  We're going to lift Tommy up in prayer and every other political prisoner.
[02:42:55.380 --> 02:42:59.740]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[02:42:59.740 --> 02:43:04.460]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[02:43:04.460 --> 02:43:05.980]  to detoxify the body.
[02:43:05.980 --> 02:43:08.140]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield.
[02:43:08.140 --> 02:43:10.820]  It's a plastic, metal, and chemical defense support.
[02:43:10.820 --> 02:43:12.340]  It's made in the USA.
[02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:17.260]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[02:43:17.260 --> 02:43:19.100]  the body and it supports the informal war.
[02:43:19.100 --> 02:43:21.340]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:24.900]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[02:43:24.900 --> 02:43:29.780]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:30.940]  you can possibly get.
[02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:34.700]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[02:43:34.700 --> 02:43:39.740]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[02:43:39.740 --> 02:43:44.980]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:47.700]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:43:47.700 --> 02:43:50.980]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:43:50.980 --> 02:43:55.380]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and infowarslife.com.
[02:43:55.380 --> 02:43:59.180]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:59.180 --> 02:44:01.980]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania states.
[02:44:01.980 --> 02:44:06.540]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about
[02:44:06.540 --> 02:44:09.140]  ash and acid rain.
[02:44:09.140 --> 02:44:14.540]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[02:44:14.540 --> 02:44:16.060]  to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:16.060 --> 02:44:22.580]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:26.580]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[02:44:26.580 --> 02:44:27.900]  in the rainwater.
[02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:33.300]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:39.420]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.420 --> 02:44:45.020]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[02:44:45.020 --> 02:44:50.340]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.340 --> 02:44:58.380]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:58.380 --> 02:45:05.100]  This is the last week to get free shipping on all of our best selling items at infowarsstore.com.

[02:45:37.980 --> 02:45:43.580]  It is critical that you go to infowarsstore.com and look at some of those items for yourself,
[02:45:43.580 --> 02:45:49.540]  whether it's water filtration, air filtration, non-gmo heirloom seeds, X2, it's all there
[02:45:49.540 --> 02:45:56.380]  at infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com.
[02:45:56.380 --> 02:46:01.860]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from infowars.com, when you spread the videos,
[02:46:01.860 --> 02:46:04.100]  you are changing the world?
[02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:07.820]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Globlest.
[02:46:07.820 --> 02:46:12.380]  It is you, the infowars, across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:16.260]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:21.140]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[02:46:21.140 --> 02:46:22.140]  You are the infowar.
[02:46:22.140 --> 02:46:27.220]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[02:46:27.220 --> 02:46:32.300]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:38.180]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:46:38.180 --> 02:46:43.700]  So now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:46.100]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:46:46.100 --> 02:46:51.540]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward
[02:46:51.540 --> 02:46:53.180]  slash newsletter.
[02:46:53.180 --> 02:47:20.180]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[02:47:23.180 --> 02:47:47.660]  All right, this should we go to first, Pastor Sam, Josh, Susan, we're going to go to everybody.
[02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:52.460]  Roger Stone's here, we're going to take calls the entire next hour.
[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:54.820]  We're doing a 34 hour broadcast.
[02:47:54.820 --> 02:47:59.340]  I cannot stress enough to all of you out there that history is happening now, not later.
[02:47:59.340 --> 02:48:03.100]  And if you'll just spread the articles, the videos, the links, if you'll tell people,
[02:48:03.100 --> 02:48:06.140]  hey, infowars is under attack, it's telling the truth.
[02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:10.380]  Every day there's some story we wrote two years ago, five years ago, six months ago,
[02:48:10.380 --> 02:48:14.260]  word for word, what we said happening because I've got all the sources.
[02:48:14.260 --> 02:48:15.860]  They're all these good people.
[02:48:15.860 --> 02:48:21.740]  But a lot of the people I get on, I'm not going to say names, they're not allowed to
[02:48:21.740 --> 02:48:27.700]  say what they say on Fox, they're not allowed to say what they say on their radio show.
[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:29.300]  They're not allowed to say what they say.
[02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:31.420]  They can come here and they can do it.
[02:48:31.420 --> 02:48:35.260]  And then they get given the third degree when they do come on.
[02:48:35.260 --> 02:48:37.060]  They put their careers in their hands when they do.
[02:48:37.060 --> 02:48:41.500]  But more and more, there's more courage as people realize, we got to beat the globalist
[02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:42.500]  no matter what happens.
[02:48:42.500 --> 02:48:47.220]  We just got to commit, take the fight to them and not have any half measures.
[02:48:47.220 --> 02:48:49.780]  And Trump is a great example of that.
[02:48:49.780 --> 02:48:54.420]  We're going to go to calls, but let's play this clip from this morning, calling the entire
[02:48:54.420 --> 02:48:57.700]  top of the FBI a bunch of Democrat-controlled scum and Comey.
[02:48:57.700 --> 02:49:03.900]  Because that's what they are, protecting the sellout of us to China and Russia and others.
[02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:07.380]  These people are our enemies, but bigger than these foreign countries are the big corporations
[02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:08.380]  that run them.
[02:49:08.380 --> 02:49:10.620]  So here's the president.
[02:49:10.620 --> 02:49:13.180]  I have the greatest supporters in the world.
[02:49:13.180 --> 02:49:18.540]  By the way, they're the smartest, they're the hardest working, they pay taxes, they're
[02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:20.660]  incredible, they're loyal.
[02:49:20.660 --> 02:49:25.380]  I have the bikers, I have the construction workers.
[02:49:25.380 --> 02:49:27.380]  I have them all.
[02:49:27.380 --> 02:49:29.020]  By the way, I have the FBI.
[02:49:29.020 --> 02:49:33.780]  You go into the FBI and take a poll of the real FBI, not the scum on top, not Comey and
[02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:34.780]  that group of people.
[02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:35.780]  They're total thieves.
[02:49:35.780 --> 02:49:36.780]  Well, most of those are gone.
[02:49:36.780 --> 02:49:40.700]  Well, I don't know how Peter Strock is still working there, to be honest with you, okay?
[02:49:40.700 --> 02:49:41.700]  He's working in HR.
[02:49:41.700 --> 02:49:42.700]  That's even worse.
[02:49:42.700 --> 02:49:48.700]  So we're running the calls, but you know the president well, and we're not gonna do this
[02:49:48.700 --> 02:49:49.700]  now.
[02:49:49.700 --> 02:49:50.700]  We'll do it the bottom of the next hour.
[02:49:50.700 --> 02:49:52.300]  You know, you haven't told me these stories.
[02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:55.140]  I went and looked up the New York Times and then I asked you a few and you said, well,
[02:49:55.140 --> 02:49:59.900]  that's not completely untrue, but you were the president's wingman for many years.
[02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:00.900]  Yes.
[02:50:00.900 --> 02:50:04.500]  So that's really what you, you know, that you did not, you guys have been buddies.
[02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:05.500]  Yes.
[02:50:05.500 --> 02:50:10.620]  And, and they've begun asking, Mueller's people have begun asking about questions about the
[02:50:10.620 --> 02:50:11.940]  president and women.
[02:50:11.940 --> 02:50:14.380]  I think they asked those questions about Jack Kennedy.
[02:50:14.380 --> 02:50:15.380]  What do you think?
[02:50:15.380 --> 02:50:17.100]  So I don't know what it is they want.
[02:50:17.100 --> 02:50:20.900]  Well, I think you should get out front of it because the stuff I read the New York,
[02:50:20.900 --> 02:50:23.620]  they know it's all been back when they loved Trump was on the New York Times, it was in
[02:50:23.620 --> 02:50:28.460]  the New York Post, it was in the New Yorker, you know, about Roger Stone and, and, and,
[02:50:28.460 --> 02:50:31.860]  and, and, you know, Trump seen out again with the, you know, three lovely ladies or whatever.
[02:50:31.860 --> 02:50:34.060]  You know, it was always in between his divorces.
[02:50:34.060 --> 02:50:35.700]  I mean, you've, you told me some of the stories.
[02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:36.700]  We'll sit.
[02:50:36.700 --> 02:50:37.700]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:50:37.700 --> 02:50:38.700]  You didn't tell me anything that wasn't known.
[02:50:38.700 --> 02:50:39.700]  I just asked you about a year ago.
[02:50:39.700 --> 02:50:40.700]  Is this true?
[02:50:40.700 --> 02:50:43.060]  Yeah, in between divorces, you know, we would double date.
[02:50:43.060 --> 02:50:48.900]  One of the great playboys of all time, no question about it, but in, in between marriages
[02:50:48.900 --> 02:50:54.860]  and you predicted this after the election and then even later, they're going to keep
[02:50:54.860 --> 02:51:00.180]  coming back at him with the women and they're, and that's clearly one of the directors.
[02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:03.180]  And the women have said now to ask you that he, if anything, he spoils the hell out of
[02:51:03.180 --> 02:51:04.180]  women.
[02:51:04.180 --> 02:51:10.060]  But why is Mueller going around asking people about questions about the president and women?
[02:51:10.060 --> 02:51:11.660]  It seems totally inappropriate.
[02:51:11.660 --> 02:51:12.660]  Wait a minute.
[02:51:12.660 --> 02:51:16.140]  Is this about Russian collusion and the 2016 election?
[02:51:16.140 --> 02:51:17.140]  Evidently not.
[02:51:17.140 --> 02:51:21.020]  I got to say in this whole corrupt world of everything, it's kind of refreshing, you
[02:51:21.020 --> 02:51:22.540]  know, a guy that likes women.
[02:51:22.540 --> 02:51:25.660]  Well, the president definitely likes women.
[02:51:25.660 --> 02:51:27.140]  Of that, there is no doubt.
[02:51:27.140 --> 02:51:28.740]  I like women too.
[02:51:28.740 --> 02:51:31.060]  What's wrong with that?
[02:51:31.060 --> 02:51:38.220]  It just shows you how far afield and how the resolve of these people to remove the president
[02:51:38.220 --> 02:51:40.040]  and the deep animus they have for him.
[02:51:40.040 --> 02:51:41.040]  And the more so.
[02:51:41.040 --> 02:51:43.900]  But what does it say that they can't find anybody to say anything that's real?
[02:51:43.900 --> 02:51:44.900]  There's nothing.
[02:51:44.900 --> 02:51:47.700]  Well, that's why they're trying to presumably squeeze Michael Cohn.
[02:51:47.700 --> 02:51:50.500]  That's why they're going to try to squeeze me.
[02:51:50.500 --> 02:51:53.620]  You know, we're going to send you to jail for 10 years unless you tell us the president
[02:51:53.620 --> 02:51:54.820]  did X.
[02:51:54.820 --> 02:51:56.060]  I'm not playing that game.
[02:51:56.060 --> 02:51:58.060]  I'm not going to testify against Donald Trump.
[02:51:58.060 --> 02:52:01.100]  Well, it's like the one lady he dated for like six months in the New York Times right
[02:52:01.100 --> 02:52:05.220]  before the election year and a half ago, 18 months ago.
[02:52:05.220 --> 02:52:09.620]  I forget her name, but she said the day she was, no, they misquoted me because he called
[02:52:09.620 --> 02:52:10.620]  her fat and was mean to her.
[02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:13.740]  No, she said all he was was super nice, bought me all these things.
[02:52:13.740 --> 02:52:17.340]  He was so gentlemanly and treated me so good, it was almost off-putting that he was such
[02:52:17.340 --> 02:52:18.340]  a gentleman.
[02:52:18.340 --> 02:52:21.100]  You know, girls don't like guys that are too nice, but he was so great.
[02:52:21.100 --> 02:52:24.140]  And yeah, he did tell me, hey, we both need to lose some weight.
[02:52:24.140 --> 02:52:26.220]  They took that and had it say he told me I was fat.
[02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:32.020]  No, he said, we both ought to at dinner, not eat dessert, we're both getting fat.
[02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:36.140]  I mean, that's the worst thing you ever did to a woman.
[02:52:36.140 --> 02:52:38.060]  It's Trump derangement syndrome.
[02:52:38.060 --> 02:52:39.060]  It really is.
[02:52:39.060 --> 02:52:44.220]  And the more successful he is, the better the economy does, the better the prospects
[02:52:44.220 --> 02:52:47.420]  for peace, the more hysterical the deep state.
[02:52:47.420 --> 02:52:48.420]  And I think that's really revealing.
[02:52:48.420 --> 02:52:49.420]  We're talking about the bottom of the hour.
[02:52:49.420 --> 02:52:52.460]  We want to call in 30 seconds, but let me just ask you this.
[02:52:52.460 --> 02:52:53.460]  You really should.
[02:52:53.460 --> 02:52:56.540]  The way to defend him is just go ahead and tell folks, I mean, you tell me, he treats
[02:52:56.540 --> 02:52:57.540]  women really nice.
[02:52:57.540 --> 02:53:00.220]  I mean, you ever seen Trump mistreating women?
[02:53:00.220 --> 02:53:01.220]  Never.
[02:53:01.220 --> 02:53:03.780]  How would you describe the way he treats women?
[02:53:03.780 --> 02:53:04.780]  Puts them on a pedestal.
[02:53:04.780 --> 02:53:11.000]  Look, he's very respectful, he's also very discreet, but the fact that we're even talking
[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.700]  about this is incredible.
[02:53:13.700 --> 02:53:14.700]  But it's not us doing it.
[02:53:14.700 --> 02:53:15.700]  They're the ones.
[02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:18.540]  Well, clearly, Mr. Mueller is going there.
[02:53:18.540 --> 02:53:24.860]  I have numerous reports of FBI agents fanning out and asking associates and former associates
[02:53:24.860 --> 02:53:27.860]  and those about the president and women.
[02:53:27.860 --> 02:53:29.860]  I thought this was about Russian collusion.
[02:53:29.860 --> 02:53:33.500]  What does this have to do with the 2016 election?
[02:53:33.500 --> 02:53:37.260]  Well, it just gives you some idea where the special counsel may be headed.
[02:53:37.260 --> 02:53:38.260]  Well, there you go.
[02:53:38.260 --> 02:53:41.500]  Trump, Nemesis, Mueller now focusing on women.
[02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:43.460]  Well, it's just like Manafort now.
[02:53:43.460 --> 02:53:45.260]  They're saying obstruction in the case.
[02:53:45.260 --> 02:53:46.260]  There's nothing.
[02:53:46.260 --> 02:53:48.060]  So they just go to obstruction in the case.
[02:53:48.060 --> 02:53:52.300]  Presumably, they could cook up some process crime.
[02:53:52.300 --> 02:53:56.540]  This is why I continue to oppose the idea that the president should give an interview
[02:53:56.540 --> 02:53:57.940]  to the special counsel.
[02:53:57.940 --> 02:54:02.460]  I saw Rudy Giuliani still left the door open a little bit the other night on Fox.
[02:54:02.460 --> 02:54:04.180]  I think that would be an egregious.
[02:54:04.180 --> 02:54:05.460]  You've been right about this day one.
[02:54:05.460 --> 02:54:08.540]  You've told the president, okay, we're going to go to Ron and we're going to everybody.
[02:54:08.540 --> 02:54:09.540]  I promise.
[02:54:09.540 --> 02:54:10.540]  Now, boom, boom, boom.
[02:54:10.540 --> 02:54:11.540]  We're going to your calls.
[02:54:11.540 --> 02:54:12.540]  Ron in Texas.
[02:54:12.540 --> 02:54:14.740]  You're on the air with Roger Stone or the 34 hour broadcast.
[02:54:14.740 --> 02:54:15.740]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:54:15.740 --> 02:54:16.740]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:16.740 --> 02:54:17.740]  Hey, Roger.
[02:54:17.740 --> 02:54:18.740]  How are y'all?
[02:54:18.740 --> 02:54:19.740]  Great.
[02:54:19.740 --> 02:54:20.740]  We're in the thick of the fight.
[02:54:20.740 --> 02:54:21.740]  I can tell you that we're certainly not bored.
[02:54:21.740 --> 02:54:26.540]  I'm telling you, I have two points to make and I'll make them quick.
[02:54:26.540 --> 02:54:32.220]  One is I have a friend, his name's Ron Farrington, and he is friends with a guy named Dr.
[02:54:32.220 --> 02:54:33.220]  William Samuelson.
[02:54:33.220 --> 02:54:45.660]  Dr. William Samuelson was in Buckingwald concentration camp in Nazi Germany with George Soros.
[02:54:45.660 --> 02:54:54.780]  He was there with him and he told my friend, Ron, that Soros would talk to guys, talk to
[02:54:54.780 --> 02:54:56.940]  the people in the prison.
[02:54:56.940 --> 02:54:59.740]  They would end up disappeared.
[02:54:59.740 --> 02:55:06.340]  He would talk to them and their families would disappear.
[02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:10.820]  That's the guys on this truth and I'd like to see y'all get in touch with Dr. William
[02:55:10.820 --> 02:55:11.820]  Samuelson.
[02:55:11.820 --> 02:55:12.820]  He's a professor.
[02:55:12.820 --> 02:55:17.460]  I think he taught at UT and he's also an offer.
[02:55:17.460 --> 02:55:23.780]  You can find him online and I just wanted to get that out there and hopefully y'all
[02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:28.300]  could get him on the show and have him talk about George Soros.
[02:55:28.300 --> 02:55:33.900]  Well, I will, but you got me thinking, Soros reportedly for three years worked with his
[02:55:33.900 --> 02:55:39.900]  stepfather to round it up Jews and took their property and find hidden Jews like Anne Frank,
[02:55:39.900 --> 02:55:47.500]  but not in Poland or Germany, but in Romania and Hungary and he would then help round them
[02:55:47.500 --> 02:55:48.500]  up.
[02:55:48.500 --> 02:55:52.740]  Now, we know that from him on 60 Minutes and on NPR and in a book, but maybe he's such
[02:55:52.740 --> 02:55:57.060]  a liar, you know, they say this guy is him, but reportedly they've checked that's not
[02:55:57.060 --> 02:55:58.060]  him.
[02:55:58.060 --> 02:56:01.940]  But the point is, is I think they didn't put out the disinfo to get us off the track.
[02:56:01.940 --> 02:56:06.660]  I'm not saying you're disinfo, but it's Soros saying he helped round up Jews and then now
[02:56:06.660 --> 02:56:10.140]  they say he was a hero that cut Hitler's head off and, you know, was in a concentration
[02:56:10.140 --> 02:56:11.140]  camp.
[02:56:11.140 --> 02:56:12.140]  That's kind of the line.
[02:56:12.140 --> 02:56:13.140]  They say defend Soros.
[02:56:13.140 --> 02:56:18.740]  So they go the other extreme, but I'll look into your reports, sir.
[02:56:18.740 --> 02:56:22.340]  All I know is what Soros said on 60 Minutes and now that he's got the young Turks and
[02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:28.740]  CNN and other people, you know, saying that he was captured by the Nazis, Soros has never
[02:56:28.740 --> 02:56:29.740]  said that.
[02:56:29.740 --> 02:56:33.220]  But you're saying this individual said that, I mean, that's what Soros did was fair it out
[02:56:33.220 --> 02:56:37.620]  Jews and where they were at, but you're saying he was like a quisling that they would put
[02:56:37.620 --> 02:56:38.860]  into the general population.
[02:56:38.860 --> 02:56:39.860]  Right.
[02:56:39.860 --> 02:56:40.860]  He was like a mole.
[02:56:40.860 --> 02:56:46.500]  He was in there with the prisoners and he would find out information about them and give
[02:56:46.500 --> 02:56:51.340]  it to, you know, the officers, the Nazis that were in charge and these people would end
[02:56:51.340 --> 02:56:52.340]  up disappearing.
[02:56:52.340 --> 02:56:54.580]  That's consistent with what we think he was doing.
[02:56:54.580 --> 02:56:55.580]  Absolutely.
[02:56:55.580 --> 02:57:01.420]  Call me this is the ordained minister and, you know, it's not the truth and, you know,
[02:57:01.420 --> 02:57:09.620]  if y'all can contact Dr. William Samuelson, I'm sure he'd be happy to confirm it because
[02:57:09.620 --> 02:57:18.020]  he told my friend Ron that if he ever saw George Soros, he would take drastic measures
[02:57:18.020 --> 02:57:21.540]  if you know what I mean.
[02:57:21.540 --> 02:57:24.940]  Well, all I know is George Soros made his money overthrowing countries and crashing
[02:57:24.940 --> 02:57:25.940]  pension funds.
[02:57:25.940 --> 02:57:28.180]  So those are the real crimes.
[02:57:28.180 --> 02:57:29.180]  He's committed.
[02:57:29.180 --> 02:57:30.180]  I mean, hell, he helped overthrow Ukraine.
[02:57:30.180 --> 02:57:31.180]  Thank you.
[02:57:31.180 --> 02:57:32.180]  God bless you.
[02:57:32.180 --> 02:57:36.060]  All I know is I've been told to shop about it and imitate something, you old dirty piece
[02:57:36.060 --> 02:57:38.060]  of crap.
[02:57:38.060 --> 02:57:39.060]  You damn demon.
[02:57:39.060 --> 02:57:40.060]  I'm scared of you.
[02:57:40.060 --> 02:57:41.060]  I'm scared of God.
[02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:43.780]  So I just pray that God bring judgment upon George Soros.
[02:57:43.780 --> 02:57:46.420]  Stay with us.

[02:59:40.620 --> 02:59:41.620]  the word.
[02:59:41.620 --> 02:59:48.940]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the second American Revolution.
[02:59:48.940 --> 03:00:07.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:07.020 --> 03:00:11.220]  Changing war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:11.220 --> 03:00:16.020]  All right, we're going right to your phone calls.
[03:00:16.020 --> 03:00:18.540]  Rodgers Stone, Rodgers Shotgun in this hour with me.
[03:00:18.540 --> 03:00:24.740]  I keep saying I'm going to say a prayer for Tommy Robinson and I get embarrassed praying
[03:00:24.740 --> 03:00:27.740]  in public or whatever, but I think you made that point that it's important for us people
[03:00:27.740 --> 03:00:30.620]  to focus and think about God and bring God into it.
[03:00:30.620 --> 03:00:33.260]  So I'll just say a prayer here, you got anything you want, Rodgers.
[03:00:33.260 --> 03:00:39.820]  Tommy Robinson is an honorable person, Lord and savior, and we just ask you to be your
[03:00:39.820 --> 03:00:44.900]  son, Jesus Christ, that you send a hedge of protection and angels around him.
[03:00:44.900 --> 03:00:51.060]  We ask others to hold him up in prayer as well, God, and all he's done first to expose
[03:00:51.060 --> 03:00:54.780]  the Muslim grooming gangs and to be tortured and imprisoned and beat up and lose his business,
[03:00:54.780 --> 03:00:55.780]  lose his house.
[03:00:55.780 --> 03:00:58.900]  And now his wife and children, we ask you to protect them and we ask that these evil
[03:00:58.900 --> 03:01:04.780]  people that are oppressing him and trying to silence him repent and that you show them
[03:01:04.780 --> 03:01:05.780]  the air of their ways.
[03:01:05.780 --> 03:01:09.340]  But we just thank you for everything you've done and the great awakening that's happening.
[03:01:09.340 --> 03:01:12.860]  We ask you just to protect people that's your will like Tommy or that if they are going
[03:01:12.860 --> 03:01:19.140]  to kill him, that just your will be done and that it be as painless as possible, but again,
[03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:20.140]  we hope that doesn't happen.
[03:01:20.140 --> 03:01:24.660]  So we just ask you to protect Tommy Robinson if that's your will and that you lead God
[03:01:24.660 --> 03:01:29.340]  and direct us all as well in this very critical time where we're seeing good come back into
[03:01:29.340 --> 03:01:33.260]  the world and evil resist it.
[03:01:33.260 --> 03:01:35.660]  Again I'm just thank you for everything and amen.
[03:01:35.660 --> 03:01:36.660]  Amen.
[03:01:36.660 --> 03:01:37.660]  It's important.
[03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:38.660]  It's power.
[03:01:38.660 --> 03:01:39.660]  It's power.
[03:01:39.660 --> 03:01:40.660]  It's power.
[03:01:40.660 --> 03:01:46.660]  So this is real palpable evil we're fighting.
[03:01:46.660 --> 03:01:55.580]  Let's go to hat man and then we'll go to everybody else.
[03:01:55.580 --> 03:01:56.580]  Hat man in Virginia.
[03:01:56.580 --> 03:01:58.980]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:01:58.980 --> 03:01:59.980]  Brother Alex Jones.
[03:01:59.980 --> 03:02:01.980]  Am I glad to be able to talk to you.
[03:02:01.980 --> 03:02:03.980]  I'm going to talk to you.
[03:02:03.980 --> 03:02:04.980]  You are an admirable man.
[03:02:04.980 --> 03:02:07.060]  There's a lot of things about you I really like.
[03:02:07.060 --> 03:02:11.420]  I like the way that you stayed stood up for the truth for years and years and years and
[03:02:11.420 --> 03:02:15.580]  even when people may thought of you and all that stuff but anyhow I'd love to talk to
[03:02:15.580 --> 03:02:19.980]  you for about an hour but I know it would be unfair to all the rest of your listeners
[03:02:19.980 --> 03:02:22.500]  so I'll try to get right straight to the point.
[03:02:22.500 --> 03:02:27.660]  I think that the Founding Fathers left us a tool with which to regain control of our
[03:02:27.660 --> 03:02:31.980]  government agents and that tool is the oath of office.
[03:02:31.980 --> 03:02:35.100]  Now you've been to court a few times I expect.
[03:02:35.100 --> 03:02:39.980]  Remember what the bailout does before any witness or a litigant can testify.
[03:02:39.980 --> 03:02:41.860]  They make you swear yourself in.
[03:02:41.860 --> 03:02:42.940]  Damn right.
[03:02:42.940 --> 03:02:48.940]  So I've done some research on this and I've found out that no public servant has ever
[03:02:48.940 --> 03:02:51.380]  been tried for violation of their oath of office.
[03:02:51.380 --> 03:02:52.380]  That's right.
[03:02:52.380 --> 03:02:55.820]  How do we get because it's perjury before the people in the Constitution and God how
[03:02:55.820 --> 03:03:01.460]  do we get perjury trouble if we lie in court which I would never do but then they all get
[03:03:01.460 --> 03:03:02.460]  to lie.
[03:03:02.460 --> 03:03:03.460]  That's a great point.
[03:03:03.460 --> 03:03:07.380]  Well that's why I was hoping to get through to you so that your audience members could
[03:03:07.380 --> 03:03:08.380]  hear.
[03:03:08.380 --> 03:03:13.900]  Now what's going on is there's been a few court rulings that say that even though the
[03:03:13.900 --> 03:03:17.540]  Constitution starts off with the words we the people we're not a party to it.
[03:03:17.540 --> 03:03:19.100]  The states are parties to it.
[03:03:19.100 --> 03:03:24.460]  So the only way to go after any government employee is to go to the states first to petition
[03:03:24.460 --> 03:03:28.380]  the state representatives to then petition the federal government to arrest these people
[03:03:28.380 --> 03:03:29.380]  and try them for perjury.
[03:03:29.380 --> 03:03:30.940]  No no I agree.
[03:03:30.940 --> 03:03:36.940]  We need to start seeing in the Constitution these public officials getting in trouble
[03:03:36.940 --> 03:03:37.940]  for violation of oath.
[03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:40.260]  I remember studying this years ago.
[03:03:40.260 --> 03:03:44.660]  There are provisions in the Constitution and I think it's impeachment but there's other
[03:03:44.660 --> 03:03:47.460]  things for violating your oath.
[03:03:47.460 --> 03:03:51.060]  Well yeah there's high crimes and misdemeanors and one of the high crimes.
[03:03:51.060 --> 03:03:55.020]  Well you know as long as somebody's in Congress for example they can't be arrested for any
[03:03:55.020 --> 03:03:57.220]  misdemeanors but luckily perjury is a fellow.
[03:03:57.220 --> 03:04:00.180]  Well you make a great point and years ago I got into this deeply but what do you make
[03:04:00.180 --> 03:04:05.740]  of Trump gets about a 95 on keeping his promises and then now you got a ceasefire that hadn't
[03:04:05.740 --> 03:04:06.740]  happened yet.
[03:04:06.740 --> 03:04:10.980]  I mean ever before in Afghanistan show I mean he's got it's like a 95.
[03:04:10.980 --> 03:04:14.460]  I can't believe he's even kept that many promises because he can't keep them all he's not he's
[03:04:14.460 --> 03:04:15.460]  not addicted.
[03:04:15.460 --> 03:04:21.460]  Yeah I know even though the mainstream media keeps saying that he is what I admire Trump
[03:04:21.460 --> 03:04:26.020]  and I found out about Mark Taylor probably about three months before he was elected and
[03:04:26.020 --> 03:04:30.580]  man the things that he I'm glad you found out about him recently and I hope that you
[03:04:30.580 --> 03:04:32.820]  get a chance to go to his website and read his prophecies.
[03:04:32.820 --> 03:04:33.820]  No I want to get him on the show.
[03:04:33.820 --> 03:04:38.500]  I mean I've seen some of it but I just get so busy and but now Mark Taylor really did
[03:04:38.500 --> 03:04:42.740]  he's he's the number first guy that said it first absolutely all right we'll be back

[03:06:39.220 --> 03:06:46.940]  fixing AG, IG, IG Inspector General what do you make of it because it does this frosting
[03:06:46.940 --> 03:06:53.260]  this sweet frosting that nobody did anything wrong or illegal but Obama did have access
[03:06:53.260 --> 03:06:59.420]  to Secret Server and Lyin had a alias and yeah they were planning to destroy his election
[03:06:59.420 --> 03:07:05.020]  and stop his presidency and yeah they did violate all the FBI rules and yeah they did
[03:07:05.020 --> 03:07:10.940]  a lot of Congress I mean it's almost like a punt to Congress and the people where we're
[03:07:10.940 --> 03:07:14.460]  not saying anybody did anything bad but here's the things they did.
[03:07:14.460 --> 03:07:19.660]  The FBI Director's performance is what shocked me I mean that was putting a nice coating
[03:07:19.660 --> 03:07:24.940]  on the whole thing like we didn't there was no politics we did find some bias we're gonna
[03:07:24.940 --> 03:07:31.420]  pull everybody in for sensitivity training and we have great reverence for the Congressional
[03:07:31.420 --> 03:07:35.420]  oversight of course we're not giving you guys any of the stuff you've asked for by the way
[03:07:35.420 --> 03:07:42.860]  Strach is now in the area of human resources so maybe Strach will teach the class or he'll
[03:07:42.860 --> 03:07:48.260]  hire other people that even better this is this this FBI Director needs to go this is
[03:07:48.260 --> 03:07:52.580]  one of the president's largest mistakes he needs to clean house the problem is not with
[03:07:52.580 --> 03:07:56.820]  the rank and file agents we know that those are good men and women doing their job you
[03:07:56.820 --> 03:08:04.100]  have a corrupted political cabal at the top and they have to go and unfortunately Chris
[03:08:04.100 --> 03:08:09.540]  Ray is committed to covering up the crimes of the people who came before him it's it's
[03:08:09.540 --> 03:08:16.140]  pathetic that performance yesterday was pathetic he admitted to nothing he tried to gloss over
[03:08:16.140 --> 03:08:23.020]  all of the obvious anti-trump bias by saying well those people weren't making decisions
[03:08:23.020 --> 03:08:28.340]  they most certainly were it's extraordinary I think that this is one of those documents
[03:08:28.340 --> 03:08:34.300]  where you can see anything you want what about the surveillance what about the FISA warrants
[03:08:34.300 --> 03:08:40.220]  what about the FBI infiltration of the Trump campaign those are the real issues that Devin
[03:08:40.220 --> 03:08:47.900]  Nunes is fighting to get into and the FBI and the DOJ are continuing to resist if you
[03:08:47.900 --> 03:08:53.260]  look at Comey and all these guys they look like criminals they just act like slimy know-it-all
[03:08:53.260 --> 03:08:57.340]  psychopaths I mean I wouldn't buy a car from them if they were my waiter I'd get up move
[03:08:57.340 --> 03:09:05.900]  the restaurant I mean they just radiate disingenuous con men they all have the same that same kind
[03:09:05.900 --> 03:09:10.700]  of haircut too did you notice that like this guy Chris Ray looks like he could be a lounge
[03:09:10.700 --> 03:09:16.260]  singer in Atlantic City I mean the guy was oily that performance I hope the president
[03:09:16.260 --> 03:09:20.860]  was watching because if he was he'd have to be furious well it didn't come off well I
[03:09:20.860 --> 03:09:27.580]  watch part of I mean look at that hello children I have a little ice cream truck I have ice
[03:09:27.580 --> 03:09:35.460]  cream I have cookies I have puppies now once you get in the back of the van put on handcuffs
[03:09:35.460 --> 03:09:42.460]  and put this red ball in your mouth and then I'm going to give you the prize and I'm going
[03:09:42.460 --> 03:09:49.540]  to slit your throat now liberal this guy is just committed to protecting the status quo
[03:09:49.540 --> 03:09:54.220]  and the sad part I mean Comey looks like a child molester I'm not saying he's a child
[03:09:54.220 --> 03:09:57.820]  molester but if you were going to cast somebody in Hollywood movie for a guy that has a dungeon
[03:09:57.820 --> 03:10:04.060]  of little kids hanging by meat hucks does Comey not look like a giant porcelain doll
[03:10:04.060 --> 03:10:07.140]  you know those little dolls that ventriloquists have that look really creepy from horror movies
[03:10:07.140 --> 03:10:12.740]  yeah he looks like a seven foot tall creeperzoid here's the real problem I tell you they had
[03:10:12.740 --> 03:10:16.500]  Penn State and the FBI got compromised and so you can talk about it all day but at the
[03:10:16.500 --> 03:10:21.900]  top it is a bunch of sick filth well and does anybody really think that Hillary is going
[03:10:21.900 --> 03:10:27.500]  to be prosecuted that Comey is going to be prosecuted why did why did Obama order $65,000
[03:10:27.500 --> 03:10:31.620]  of succulent hot dogs for one party he said are these really good ones because he wants
[03:10:31.620 --> 03:10:35.700]  really succulent juicy ones will they be as good as the ones we had in Hawaii God those
[03:10:35.700 --> 03:10:40.580]  were good can't comment on that I wonder how big those hot dogs are can't comment you think
[03:10:40.580 --> 03:10:51.220]  Trump do you here's the thing does Obama does Obama actually articulate the hot dog or does
[03:10:51.220 --> 03:10:56.380]  he just take the hot dog I'm not going to go there no no no no I'm serious I'm talking
[03:10:56.380 --> 03:11:01.740]  about if you're ordering $65,000 with the hot dogs for Chicago party they say 20 people
[03:11:01.740 --> 03:11:06.460]  are going to be at how many hot dogs do they eat I'm not good at math but that'd be a lot
[03:11:06.460 --> 03:11:12.180]  of hot dogs that's for sure but but let's really break it down let's say top gay escort
[03:11:12.180 --> 03:11:18.260]  let's say is for two hours I just looking into this from a lot of experience I'm joking
[03:11:18.260 --> 03:11:25.260]  let's say $8,000 the gay porn stars so how many gay porn stars is that divided into $65,000
[03:11:25.260 --> 03:11:30.220]  worth of succulent hot dogs guys can you divide let's say once up for two hours let's divide
[03:11:30.220 --> 03:11:35.540]  Roger let's divide $8,000 but they're gonna get the president discount but let's say
[03:11:35.540 --> 03:11:41.820]  $4,000 $4,000 divided into $65,000 guys can you do that please well we play some jeopardy
[03:11:41.820 --> 03:11:53.820]  music in the background how many how many no that's not 61 and a half oh it's it's six
[03:11:53.820 --> 03:12:02.300]  hot dogs so okay so they're at a Chicago party and they ordered six male process it's well
[03:12:02.300 --> 03:12:05.660]  you're assuming that there's some kind of code language there look I'm more how do you
[03:12:05.660 --> 03:12:10.380]  order $65,000 worth of hot dogs I'm more concerned with the fact that the blatantly went out
[03:12:10.380 --> 03:12:18.180]  and said I can feed a party of 50 people for like 20 bucks worth of hot dogs but will they
[03:12:18.180 --> 03:12:26.460]  be good hot dogs though maybe they're substandard hot dogs well there is that gay prostitute
[03:12:26.460 --> 03:12:31.620]  I got for $10 that time look the more so there was the crack horn Orlando let's get
[03:12:31.620 --> 03:12:35.940]  more serious here the real thing here is that Obama got caught lying yesterday about the
[03:12:35.940 --> 03:12:40.940]  fact that Hillary had no legal server and he knew it and he lied about it and he'll
[03:12:40.940 --> 03:12:45.740]  pay no penalty and Hillary will pay no penalty and call me will pay no penalty by the way
[03:12:45.740 --> 03:12:49.380]  I want to be clear I am a libertarian even though I don't approve of things like that
[03:12:49.380 --> 03:12:54.380]  in prostitution I think it's been decriminalized if Obama wanted six male prostitutes I think
[03:12:54.380 --> 03:13:03.020]  that's his business okay I just want to be clear that it's not a hot dog phobic rant
[03:13:03.020 --> 03:13:12.740]  here what I dog phobic rant that's pretty good you like that dog a fob dog a fob let's
[03:13:12.740 --> 03:13:17.580]  get back to our callers though I am phobic of Lyndon Baines Johnson well you should be
[03:13:17.580 --> 03:13:26.460]  there I'm a Johnson jumbo jumbo oh that was the nickname jumbo yeah sorry hey I'm not
[03:13:26.460 --> 03:13:30.980]  I was a family show they're the ones bringing all this out and I and they're the ones doing
[03:13:30.980 --> 03:13:36.420]  all this I said I go to phone calls I will go to phone calls who's up next to your doctor
[03:13:36.420 --> 03:13:41.460]  Kelly let's take Josh from Florida yes let's let you call the callers let's take Josh Josh
[03:13:41.460 --> 03:13:47.780]  in Florida come on down go ahead sir huge fan Alex and Rob can you hear me in Florida

[03:13:54.020 --> 03:14:00.700]  yeah maybe training for a hot dog eating contest sorry go ahead I wanted to comment quickly
[03:14:00.700 --> 03:14:06.780]  on the motivations of Mueller in the deep state there's a lot of the pundits in the talk shows
[03:14:06.780 --> 03:14:11.420]  they're caught up in the legalese the left is against Putin obviously because of his
[03:14:11.420 --> 03:14:16.580]  pro-Christian pro patriarchal stance but they I don't think they comment enough on the fact
[03:14:16.580 --> 03:14:24.660]  that Putin whooped the deep state in the Ukraine Crimea in Georgia Ossetia Pazia and he's not
[03:14:24.660 --> 03:14:31.260]  a hot dog kind of sir yeah in the Soviet time in Vietnam don't forget Mueller is a Vietnam
[03:14:31.260 --> 03:14:37.300]  veteran and he's really engaged in a form of revenge porn you know against any non-Vietnam
[03:14:37.300 --> 03:14:42.820]  vets anyone who's not pro-deep state and I just don't think they the news analyzes his
[03:14:42.820 --> 03:14:47.420]  motivate we know he's evil but I don't think they take enough time to analyze his motivations
[03:14:47.420 --> 03:14:54.180]  the geopolitics the anti-deep state activity that specific that Putin was involved in and
[03:14:54.180 --> 03:14:58.100]  in terms of the obsession with legalese this country also needs to you know besides the
[03:14:58.100 --> 03:15:02.940]  Justice Department we need a lot more legal reform real legal reform and I know Trump's
[03:15:02.940 --> 03:15:07.100]  had a good start with the regulations just remembering that our founder founding founder
[03:15:07.100 --> 03:15:12.900]  fathers like George Washington he was a civil engineer a surveyor yeah we got too many lawyers
[03:15:12.900 --> 03:15:19.820]  in Congress and again and you've got to be a hot dog connoisseur to even get into a lot
[03:15:19.820 --> 03:15:25.100]  of their clubs and and and again that's all part of how they compromise the population
[03:15:25.100 --> 03:15:31.900]  you know that's a moral end but but again they need to focus on Mueller's motivation
[03:15:31.900 --> 03:15:38.220]  for I have a high security comment with a 80 twist if there's any possibility to speak

[03:20:15.220 --> 03:20:40.220]  they told you never saw them in trouble with the law since the day they were born that's
[03:20:40.220 --> 03:21:02.740]  just a good old boy you know my mama loves me sometimes I'm just not gonna let people
[03:21:02.740 --> 03:21:06.540]  push me around Roger you made a really good point during the break as we get serious here
[03:21:06.540 --> 03:21:12.420]  but before we go back to the calls about the fact that Obama's been missing in action and
[03:21:12.420 --> 03:21:18.420]  why he's missing in action and how the Democrats don't have a leader they think it's Joe Biden
[03:21:18.420 --> 03:21:22.980]  who's got his own issues and then Hillary won't go away she's still in control the reins
[03:21:22.980 --> 03:21:29.580]  of it the fact that they thought they could run the crypt keeper with a wig on Hillary
[03:21:29.580 --> 03:21:35.180]  and get away with this they think Obama after all Trump's successes and all their push polling
[03:21:35.180 --> 03:21:42.220]  and sampling 15% more Democrats in Gallup and Trump's at 54 in Gallup you had 15 more points
[03:21:42.220 --> 03:21:48.020]  on that folks we're almost at 70% I mean that is why they are in full panic mode but why
[03:21:48.020 --> 03:21:55.140]  is Obama MIA two parts here yesterday if you saw this Bill Clinton in an interview says
[03:21:55.140 --> 03:22:01.460]  that the standards have changed regarding what you can do to another person meaning I guess
[03:22:01.460 --> 03:22:05.980]  what he's saying is rape was okay when I did it but it's not okay today I think that's
[03:22:05.980 --> 03:22:12.380]  what he was saying so professional Democrats just want Bill and Hillary to go away to get
[03:22:12.380 --> 03:22:18.300]  off the stage to disappear and correctly they look at Barack Obama's poll numbers and he
[03:22:18.300 --> 03:22:24.460]  is infinitely more popular than the Clintons and he's the last elected Democratic president
[03:22:24.460 --> 03:22:29.940]  so he's the putative head of it would be a good move for them if they can get him out
[03:22:29.940 --> 03:22:34.940]  of the foxhole but he's got his ass sticking up out of the foxhole looking for hot dogs
[03:22:34.940 --> 03:22:40.620]  down below I think his problem is an obvious one the Peter Struck message that says the
[03:22:40.620 --> 03:22:47.020]  president wants to be kept up to date on this the CYA memo by Susan Rice I think we're
[03:22:47.020 --> 03:22:52.540]  going to find that the phony dossier at the end of the day that was created with the specific
[03:22:52.540 --> 03:22:58.180]  purpose of creating a phony rationale for the surveillance of Donald Trump's campaign
[03:22:58.180 --> 03:23:03.180]  was approved by Barack Obama himself what did the president know and when did he know
[03:23:03.180 --> 03:23:08.180]  and the IG report says this in triple kit and of course confirming it you never toot
[03:23:08.180 --> 03:23:13.220]  your horn you were the first person when Trump was elected and they were bragging about
[03:23:13.220 --> 03:23:16.580]  surveilling him in the news before they flipped it and said they never were when Trump pointed
[03:23:16.580 --> 03:23:20.420]  out it was illegal and there was nothing there to say that you must go to the FISA court
[03:23:20.420 --> 03:23:23.900]  it's illegal how they did it it will bring them all down bigger than Watergate I know
[03:23:23.900 --> 03:23:27.660]  you told the president that many times he's been tweeting that it's all documented now
[03:23:27.660 --> 03:23:32.260]  so where do we go and our friend judge Andrew Napolitano who's been proven completely right
[03:23:32.260 --> 03:23:38.900]  about this because the British did some of the dirty work here in a classic deep state
[03:23:38.900 --> 03:23:43.260]  move where we need to die ability we go to our allies and we have them doing the spying
[03:23:43.260 --> 03:23:49.100]  for us so we can say oh no we didn't spy on anybody no we had the Brits do it that standard
[03:23:49.100 --> 03:23:53.380]  procedure and the corporate media knows people don't study spycraft they go ridiculous why
[03:23:53.380 --> 03:24:00.660]  would the Brits be doing it oh my god so the real question is will Barack Obama ever be
[03:24:00.660 --> 03:24:04.940]  required to sit in front of a congressional committee under oaths where everybody can
[03:24:04.940 --> 03:24:09.580]  see an answer question could you imagine the hot dog bandit in front of congress I could
[03:24:09.580 --> 03:24:15.020]  imagine the fact that he will lay continually lay low on this whole thing because I think
[03:24:15.020 --> 03:24:19.460]  he has ultimate culpability and he's been quarterbacking and he moved in a few miles
[03:24:19.460 --> 03:24:23.660]  from the White House they admit running this whole lot suing you suing the president so
[03:24:23.660 --> 03:24:30.460]  so so yeah we start talking about Obama facing his time in prison it is certainly fair to
[03:24:30.460 --> 03:24:35.780]  say that none of this could have happened is as we Italians say a fish rots from the
[03:24:35.780 --> 03:24:42.260]  head the top man would have known about everything that was done here and they needed an insurance
[03:24:42.260 --> 03:24:46.860]  policy to stop Donald Trump as we have now learned so we're gonna go to calls right now
[03:24:46.860 --> 03:24:50.780]  but what ace in the hole they have up their sleeve when we come back and we're starting
[03:24:50.780 --> 03:24:55.100]  to win but let's not be too comp confident and then let's just get into it because the
[03:24:55.100 --> 03:24:58.420]  FBI is already asking you meaning they're digging around trying to make something up
[03:24:58.420 --> 03:25:01.860]  I looked up the New York Times articles back when I liked Trump about oh he's divorced you
[03:25:01.860 --> 03:25:05.740]  know with ladies and Roger Stone I said is it true you're his wingman going back 40 years
[03:25:05.740 --> 03:25:09.900]  ago off and on and you remember you said well yeah only when he was in between divorces and
[03:25:09.900 --> 03:25:13.460]  then he wanted somebody to go go out because he was real picky he wanted to just take girls
[03:25:13.460 --> 03:25:17.100]  out take them to dinner for a long time and you know he had to go he wanted you know somebody
[03:25:17.100 --> 03:25:20.740]  to help you know you'll get rid of me you told me some really cool stuff in confidence
[03:25:20.740 --> 03:25:24.260]  and I would be nice if you could just tell folks ahead of the time before they make something
[03:25:24.260 --> 03:25:28.660]  up well we'll do it next segment think about what you want to talk about this is a big

[03:26:00.260 --> 03:26:06.620]  back Alex hope you had some good time with your family I did as far as the Empire striking
[03:26:06.620 --> 03:26:10.900]  back we've done well we brought a lot of things to light we've really given the enemy a bloody
[03:26:10.900 --> 03:26:16.980]  nose and they are going to come out swinging and I believe that way that that's the typology
[03:26:16.980 --> 03:26:21.660]  that they'll follow is what was followed in what's known to history as the Spanish Civil
[03:26:21.660 --> 03:26:28.300]  War it was really a war of conquest by the Roman world system the fourth and terrible
[03:26:28.300 --> 03:26:36.620]  beast but between 1932 and 1936 the nation of Spain declared itself independent and set
[03:26:36.620 --> 03:26:42.980]  up a representative republic this was really the Brexit of its day you're right and you've
[03:26:42.980 --> 03:26:50.380]  studied that I'm sure in this effort this is where the the the wickedness of the Catholic
[03:26:50.380 --> 03:26:55.540]  church was really uncovered you hear from time to times a whispered rumor that it's
[03:26:55.540 --> 03:27:00.980]  been found that there were tunnels between the supposedly celibate abbeys or nunneries
[03:27:00.980 --> 03:27:06.020]  and the seminaries where the supposedly celibate priests lived and that they would go through
[03:27:06.020 --> 03:27:12.380]  those tunnels at night and have little liaisons where that was actually discovered was in
[03:27:12.380 --> 03:27:18.740]  Spain during this four-year period that they had a republic and they also found that when
[03:27:18.740 --> 03:27:23.140]  the nuns became pregnant this was before birth control and all that that they were kept in
[03:27:23.140 --> 03:27:27.780]  cloister the babes were brought to term and many many of them were asphyxiated and put
[03:27:27.780 --> 03:27:33.460]  in a buried in the crypt when the Spanish people found this out they were so furious
[03:27:33.460 --> 03:27:42.180]  that a revolution against Catholic power and monarchial imperial power started it was very
[03:27:42.180 --> 03:27:47.820]  dangerous for them was very dangerous for the pope and so he a counter assault was in
[03:27:47.820 --> 03:27:53.260]  three different ways and it's very important this is where we get the term fifth column
[03:27:53.260 --> 03:27:58.900]  general Francisco Franco when he assaulted Madrid he said he would assault Madrid with
[03:27:58.900 --> 03:28:05.660]  his four columns and a fifth column on the inside that is he said he had pre-placed
[03:28:05.660 --> 03:28:11.460]  infiltrators within the city so the three ways that they the first of all was a tennessee
[03:28:11.460 --> 03:28:16.060]  lia child murder and sacrifice that was going on then and it's going on now now that we've
[03:28:16.060 --> 03:28:21.820]  discovered it the enemy has to come out and fight the second thing was this war was billed
[03:28:21.820 --> 03:28:29.580]  as a war against communist revolutionaries you know it's just 10 years 15 years before
[03:28:29.580 --> 03:28:34.980]  that russia had been taken over by the bolsheviks and so in the world it could public opinion
[03:28:34.980 --> 03:28:42.220]  was against communism so franco's armies which were muslim hordes attacked in the name of
[03:28:42.220 --> 03:28:47.540]  crushing a communist revolution although it was not all right that is a whole other giant
[03:28:47.540 --> 03:28:55.020]  subject but very interesting we'll be right back stay with us now that we're heading home
[03:28:55.020 --> 03:28:59.460]  after an adventurous day of sun and fun i realize the glow in the backseat isn't coming
[03:28:59.460 --> 03:29:04.420]  from the kids screens it's actually coming from the kids that's because my well meaning

[03:30:49.380 --> 03:30:57.020]  forward slash newsletter we are the renaissance and we are winning Patrick in the great nation
[03:30:57.020 --> 03:31:23.700]  of Australia you're on the air worldwide thanks for holding
[03:31:23.700 --> 03:31:41.820]  the
[03:31:41.820 --> 03:31:50.820]  God, but the more you chase God, and I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[03:31:53.820 --> 03:32:00.820]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:00.820 --> 03:32:06.820]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:06.820 --> 03:32:14.820]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:14.820 --> 03:32:20.820]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:20.820 --> 03:32:26.820]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:26.820 --> 03:32:33.820]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[03:32:33.820 --> 03:32:37.820]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:37.820 --> 03:32:42.820]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:42.820 --> 03:32:48.820]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:48.820 --> 03:33:04.820]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:33:04.820 --> 03:33:15.820]  Music
[03:33:15.820 --> 03:33:20.820]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[03:33:20.820 --> 03:33:26.820]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:26.820 --> 03:33:35.820]  Do you still think that Shedd fuel brought down a World Trade Center? Does anybody else see a problem here?
[03:33:35.820 --> 03:33:40.820]  If the government has something to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[03:33:40.820 --> 03:33:43.820]  This story does not end up.
[03:33:43.820 --> 03:33:59.820]  Music
[03:33:59.820 --> 03:34:06.820]  Gentlemen, we're about to overthrow the globalist occupational government and restore the Republic and launch a worldwide operation for freedom.
[03:34:06.820 --> 03:34:13.820]  Are you ready? Our weapons of truth. The enemy is the lie. Let's take action.
[03:34:13.820 --> 03:34:15.820]  We're going back to your phone calls.
[03:34:15.820 --> 03:34:20.820]  For the next segment, Roger will, he doesn't want to talk about the Trump stuff.
[03:34:20.820 --> 03:34:24.820]  He didn't tell me, by the way, anything.
[03:34:24.820 --> 03:34:26.820]  I just said, hey, I did a lot of research on Trump.
[03:34:26.820 --> 03:34:30.820]  These New York Times articles accurately were his wingman during divorces.
[03:34:30.820 --> 03:34:36.820]  He would be seeing out with you and women, and then he was very particular about the law and treated women very nice.
[03:34:36.820 --> 03:34:38.820]  He said, yeah, no, that's back when they liked him.
[03:34:38.820 --> 03:34:41.820]  And those are two articles about Trump.
[03:34:41.820 --> 03:34:42.820]  And I said, well, how do you treat women?
[03:34:42.820 --> 03:34:44.820]  Well, you said really, really nice and all the rest of it.
[03:34:44.820 --> 03:34:46.820]  So why don't we just, we're going to go to calls.
[03:34:46.820 --> 03:34:50.820]  Let's just get to that now since I built it up and talk about that.
[03:34:50.820 --> 03:34:55.820]  Because like you said, the big news is the FBI is coming to you.
[03:34:55.820 --> 03:34:57.820]  They're coming to your associates.
[03:34:57.820 --> 03:35:04.820]  They're bringing me up a lot, but now they've moved from that into, it's just 1340 people they brought me up to.
[03:35:04.820 --> 03:35:08.820]  And that we're all these masterminds running everything, which isn't true.
[03:35:08.820 --> 03:35:10.820]  We just want freedom, common sense stuff.
[03:35:10.820 --> 03:35:13.820]  And then now they're getting into going back decades ago.
[03:35:13.820 --> 03:35:16.820]  Nothing to do with Russia, nothing to do with anything, not even taxes.
[03:35:16.820 --> 03:35:20.820]  It's all, well, what are the questions that you're hearing that the FBI is asking about?
[03:35:20.820 --> 03:35:22.820]  Roger Stone, Donald Trump and women.
[03:35:22.820 --> 03:35:25.820]  Well, it's more about Donald Trump and women.
[03:35:25.820 --> 03:35:32.820]  Some of my associates were asked this, but other people I know who have been questioned by the FBI in the Mueller probe
[03:35:32.820 --> 03:35:37.820]  have told me that there seems to be a focus on the president's relationship with women.
[03:35:37.820 --> 03:35:40.820]  I'm not going to talk about that ever.
[03:35:40.820 --> 03:35:43.820]  I'm not going to talk about out of school about the president.
[03:35:43.820 --> 03:35:46.820]  I don't know anything that would be detrimental to him.
[03:35:46.820 --> 03:35:53.820]  And the idea that they would cook up some offense against me as an effort to get me to roll on the president
[03:35:53.820 --> 03:35:56.820]  is probably what they have in mind.
[03:35:56.820 --> 03:35:58.820]  But I have proven there is no Russian collusion.
[03:35:58.820 --> 03:36:00.820]  There is no WikiLeaks collusion.
[03:36:00.820 --> 03:36:03.820]  I didn't know about John Podesta's email in advance.
[03:36:03.820 --> 03:36:04.820]  There's no evidence of that.
[03:36:04.820 --> 03:36:07.820]  I never paid for or bought any information.
[03:36:07.820 --> 03:36:11.820]  Everything I did in connection with the presidential election was legal.
[03:36:11.820 --> 03:36:12.820]  I'm not the target here.
[03:36:12.820 --> 03:36:14.820]  The president is the target.
[03:36:14.820 --> 03:36:18.820]  But it's put me and my family under enormous pressure.
[03:36:18.820 --> 03:36:24.820]  Think of having a runaway federal prosecutor in every molecule of your being, reading your emails.
[03:36:24.820 --> 03:36:26.820]  But to be specific, they're really desperate.
[03:36:26.820 --> 03:36:28.820]  But you didn't tell me any secrets.
[03:36:28.820 --> 03:36:30.820]  I just had some New York Times articles over the phone.
[03:36:30.820 --> 03:36:31.820]  And I said, is this accurate?
[03:36:31.820 --> 03:36:32.820]  Is that accurate?
[03:36:32.820 --> 03:36:34.820]  Because, hell, that was even during the campaign.
[03:36:34.820 --> 03:36:37.820]  I wanted to make sure I wasn't bet on the wrong horse or something wouldn't come out.
[03:36:37.820 --> 03:36:39.820]  And you said, listen, he treats women really great.
[03:36:39.820 --> 03:36:40.820]  He puts them on a pedestal.
[03:36:40.820 --> 03:36:43.820]  He puts them into this whole courtship thing because he's a germaphobe.
[03:36:43.820 --> 03:36:46.820]  And the fact that he'd be even promiscuous is bull.
[03:36:46.820 --> 03:36:48.820]  He's a playboy. He dated a lot of women when he's divorced.
[03:36:48.820 --> 03:36:50.820]  He treats them really great.
[03:36:50.820 --> 03:36:52.820]  But then the taste level is extraordinary.
[03:36:52.820 --> 03:36:53.820]  I mean, he dated supermodels.
[03:36:53.820 --> 03:36:55.820]  Well, I was about to say, but then you told me a little more.
[03:36:55.820 --> 03:36:59.820]  You said that if they give, but if they give them any trouble or act weird,
[03:36:59.820 --> 03:37:00.820]  he didn't put up with that either.
[03:37:00.820 --> 03:37:02.820]  I mean, just in general, you were his friend.
[03:37:02.820 --> 03:37:03.820]  You were his wingman.
[03:37:03.820 --> 03:37:04.820]  You're not going to give a secret.
[03:37:04.820 --> 03:37:06.820]  Just in general, Trump's relationship to women.
[03:37:06.820 --> 03:37:07.820]  How does he treat them?
[03:37:07.820 --> 03:37:08.820]  Extraordinary.
[03:37:08.820 --> 03:37:09.820]  And his taste level.
[03:37:09.820 --> 03:37:12.820]  I mean, Melania, his wife, who's a wonderful person,
[03:37:12.820 --> 03:37:17.820]  is typical of the kind of woman that he dated in between marriages.
[03:37:17.820 --> 03:37:19.820]  And she was, of course, the woman he chose.
[03:37:19.820 --> 03:37:23.820]  Because you've got 10s, but you've also got 10, 10, 10, like in gymnastics.
[03:37:23.820 --> 03:37:25.820]  I mean, it's solid 10s across the board.
[03:37:25.820 --> 03:37:27.820]  She's smart. She's beautiful. She's cool.
[03:37:27.820 --> 03:37:29.820]  Her presence is amazing.
[03:37:29.820 --> 03:37:30.820]  Supermodels.
[03:37:30.820 --> 03:37:34.820]  He had a tendency to date supermodels and he wasn't shy about it.
[03:37:34.820 --> 03:37:36.820]  And he was enormously discreet.
[03:37:36.820 --> 03:37:38.820]  He is a gentleman.
[03:37:38.820 --> 03:37:41.820]  Beyond that, I'm not going to go.
[03:37:41.820 --> 03:37:44.820]  But never anything about roughing women up.
[03:37:44.820 --> 03:37:45.820]  Never a problem.
[03:37:45.820 --> 03:37:46.820]  Not his thing.
[03:37:46.820 --> 03:37:48.820]  Well, they've been all over everything with the fine-tuned comb.
[03:37:48.820 --> 03:37:49.820]  There's nothing there.
[03:37:49.820 --> 03:37:52.820]  That's why the rudimentary idea in this ridiculous dossier
[03:37:52.820 --> 03:37:56.820]  that he would somehow enjoy watching women urinate on each other.
[03:37:56.820 --> 03:37:57.820]  That's not Donald Trump.
[03:37:57.820 --> 03:37:58.820]  That's not his thing.
[03:37:58.820 --> 03:38:00.820]  He would find that disgusting.
[03:38:00.820 --> 03:38:02.820]  That's what's so outrageous about it.
[03:38:02.820 --> 03:38:05.820]  It's not even credible as an idea.
[03:38:05.820 --> 03:38:09.820]  So he was one of the great playboys of all time.
[03:38:09.820 --> 03:38:12.820]  He's not into degrading women, for sure.
[03:38:12.820 --> 03:38:16.820]  And he's not into the stuff that Democrats and people are into.
[03:38:16.820 --> 03:38:18.820]  The whole scatological thing.
[03:38:18.820 --> 03:38:19.820]  Definitely not.
[03:38:19.820 --> 03:38:22.820]  He is an admitted germaphobe.
[03:38:22.820 --> 03:38:26.820]  When he thought about running for president in 2000 very briefly,
[03:38:26.820 --> 03:38:29.820]  which he would tell you today was more my idea than his,
[03:38:29.820 --> 03:38:35.820]  he went through about a gallon of Purell a day for, you know, for hen cleansing.
[03:38:35.820 --> 03:38:38.820]  So let's talk about the subject, the black people.
[03:38:38.820 --> 03:38:40.820]  All the rappers that knew him well, so they loved him.
[03:38:40.820 --> 03:38:44.820]  He opened the golf courses up to black folks 40-something years ago in Jews.
[03:38:44.820 --> 03:38:47.820]  Why did hip-hop say he was the coolest white guy ever?
[03:38:47.820 --> 03:38:49.820]  And then now he claims he's a racist, which none of it's true,
[03:38:49.820 --> 03:38:50.820]  and he proved.
[03:38:50.820 --> 03:38:54.820]  And Donald Trump likes energy.
[03:38:54.820 --> 03:38:57.820]  He likes exciting people, and he really likes black people.
[03:38:57.820 --> 03:38:58.820]  There's no question about that.
[03:38:58.820 --> 03:39:01.820]  And he's in all these rap songs.
[03:39:01.820 --> 03:39:04.820]  What's interesting is a poll yesterday showing that his improvement rating
[03:39:04.820 --> 03:39:07.820]  among younger blacks is really increasing.
[03:39:07.820 --> 03:39:09.820]  And that's got to drive the Democrats insane.
[03:39:09.820 --> 03:39:11.820]  I think that's Dennis Rodman.
[03:39:11.820 --> 03:39:13.820]  I think that that's Kanye West.
[03:39:13.820 --> 03:39:16.820]  I think it is people thinking for themselves.
[03:39:16.820 --> 03:39:20.820]  Well, let me tell you, Elon Musk and Kanye are getting harassed behind the scenes.
[03:39:20.820 --> 03:39:23.820]  How they threw Kanye in a mental institution for a week and a half.
[03:39:23.820 --> 03:39:25.820]  And I'm not supposed to get into all this.
[03:39:25.820 --> 03:39:26.820]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:39:26.820 --> 03:39:30.820]  But like everybody saw Matt Drudge just magically show up here with me unannounced.
[03:39:30.820 --> 03:39:34.820]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:39:34.820 --> 03:39:35.820]  Gotcha.
[03:39:35.820 --> 03:39:37.820]  But there's a lot of stuff going on.
[03:39:37.820 --> 03:39:39.820]  These people are really awake.
[03:39:39.820 --> 03:39:42.820]  And they understand the ball game.
[03:39:42.820 --> 03:39:44.820]  And Kanye was awake like five years ago.
[03:39:44.820 --> 03:39:46.820]  I now know, but he's really awake now.
[03:39:46.820 --> 03:39:50.820]  And they've been messing with him behind the scenes, and it's making him do the opposite.
[03:39:50.820 --> 03:39:54.820]  They're threatening and doing stuff, and it's not making him back down.
[03:39:54.820 --> 03:39:58.820]  The guy's an incredible artist, and he's got an incredible forum,
[03:39:58.820 --> 03:40:01.820]  and he's driving them crazy, driving them crazy.
[03:40:01.820 --> 03:40:03.820]  Alex, I want to take a call from Susan.
[03:40:03.820 --> 03:40:04.820]  Yes, let's do it.
[03:40:04.820 --> 03:40:05.820]  Susan and Elyssa.
[03:40:05.820 --> 03:40:07.820]  Susan, thanks for holding her a trooper.
[03:40:07.820 --> 03:40:08.820]  God bless.
[03:40:08.820 --> 03:40:09.820]  Go ahead.
[03:40:09.820 --> 03:40:10.820]  Hi, guys.
[03:40:10.820 --> 03:40:11.820]  Hi, Alex.
[03:40:11.820 --> 03:40:12.820]  Hi, Roger.
[03:40:12.820 --> 03:40:13.820]  Just two quick things.
[03:40:13.820 --> 03:40:18.820]  My husband at work, and he made me promise to send his love to you guys.
[03:40:18.820 --> 03:40:19.820]  Thank you.
[03:40:19.820 --> 03:40:23.820]  We've been listening for years, and he turned me on, you guys.
[03:40:23.820 --> 03:40:29.820]  We used the survival shield, the alpha power, silver bullet, we have auto ship, the secret 12.
[03:40:29.820 --> 03:40:34.820]  And I just wanted to ask Roger if he was still doing his book signing,
[03:40:34.820 --> 03:40:37.820]  and I wasn't sure where to send my book.
[03:40:37.820 --> 03:40:38.820]  Absolutely.
[03:40:38.820 --> 03:40:46.820]  So you buy your book at them4s.com site, and you mail it to me at 1007 North Federal Highway,
[03:40:46.820 --> 03:40:51.820]  number 166 Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33304.
[03:40:51.820 --> 03:40:52.820]  Let me do it again.
[03:40:52.820 --> 03:41:01.820]  1007 North Federal Highway, number 166 Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33304.
[03:41:01.820 --> 03:41:05.820]  Anybody who buys a book at the info wars site and says that in their package,
[03:41:05.820 --> 03:41:08.820]  I will sign it and mail it back to you at my own expense.
[03:41:08.820 --> 03:41:11.820]  As we got a log jam last time, you got them all signed, like 5,000.
[03:41:11.820 --> 03:41:14.820]  This time, people can go to any stationary store or wherever,
[03:41:14.820 --> 03:41:17.820]  they can just get little sticker packs that are, you know, stickers.
[03:41:17.820 --> 03:41:21.820]  And so they could mail you, it'd be cheaper, just an envelope with a sticker in it.
[03:41:21.820 --> 03:41:22.820]  You could also sign that.
[03:41:22.820 --> 03:41:26.820]  I'll do it either way, but it's my pleasure to do.
[03:41:26.820 --> 03:41:29.820]  I've sent out about 20 of them yesterday since I made this offer.
[03:41:29.820 --> 03:41:33.820]  Info warriors have responded, but buy the book at the info wars site,
[03:41:33.820 --> 03:41:35.820]  and I'll be happy to sign it for you.
[03:41:35.820 --> 03:41:39.820]  Send me a book plate, they call it, or send me the book either way.
[03:41:39.820 --> 03:41:41.820]  Yeah, and he's doing it, but it turned out a train wreck for me last time,
[03:41:41.820 --> 03:41:44.820]  which is like 5,000 orders for one of that, and we finally got it done.
[03:41:44.820 --> 03:41:45.820]  So that's not with me.
[03:41:45.820 --> 03:41:48.820]  You buy the book, that's the deal Roger's doing over there on his end.
[03:41:48.820 --> 03:41:52.820]  But the bigger thing is Susan, thank you for your support on what you're calling about.
[03:41:52.820 --> 03:41:54.820]  That was really it.
[03:41:54.820 --> 03:41:59.820]  I just wanted to say how much these products have changed my life, the brain force especially.
[03:41:59.820 --> 03:42:02.820]  I'm an artist, and I work from home, and I have a couple kids,
[03:42:02.820 --> 03:42:05.820]  and that actually helps keep me focused and gives me energy.
[03:42:05.820 --> 03:42:08.820]  And the iodine has improved my skin.
[03:42:08.820 --> 03:42:12.820]  I'm almost 43 years old, and I've noticed a huge change.
[03:42:12.820 --> 03:42:14.820]  And I just wanted to ask Roger about his book,
[03:42:14.820 --> 03:42:17.820]  and I've just been listening, you guys are cracking me up today.
[03:42:17.820 --> 03:42:22.820]  Describe how long did it take for the iodine, how long did it take for the iodine to kick in?
[03:42:22.820 --> 03:42:25.820]  I want to say a couple weeks.
[03:42:25.820 --> 03:42:28.820]  And I started noticing, just looking in the mirror,
[03:42:28.820 --> 03:42:32.820]  I don't look quite as old as I did.
[03:42:32.820 --> 03:42:34.820]  I don't have that many wrinkles anyway.
[03:42:34.820 --> 03:42:35.820]  Well, it's simple.
[03:42:35.820 --> 03:42:36.820]  If you don't have oxygen, you die.
[03:42:36.820 --> 03:42:37.820]  If you don't have water, you die.
[03:42:37.820 --> 03:42:39.820]  If you don't have vitamin C or iodine, you die.
[03:42:39.820 --> 03:42:42.820]  And they have lowered the levels of what they say you need
[03:42:42.820 --> 03:42:44.820]  as one of the biggest conspiracies against humanity.
[03:42:44.820 --> 03:42:45.820]  God bless you Susan.
[03:42:45.820 --> 03:42:50.820]  All right, we'll be back with Phil, Scott, Elisa, Dr. Kelly, and others. Stay with us.

[03:44:31.820 --> 03:44:33.820]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.

[03:44:45.820 --> 03:44:48.820]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are,
[03:44:48.820 --> 03:45:17.820]  and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[03:45:18.820 --> 03:45:20.820]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[03:45:48.820 --> 03:45:58.820]  We can't extend this free shipping sale much longer with our bestselling items
[03:45:58.820 --> 03:46:00.820]  at infowarstore.com.
[03:46:00.820 --> 03:46:02.820]  In fact, we can only run it a few more days.
[03:46:02.820 --> 03:46:06.820]  We're also running out of some of our bestselling items like our amazing Neutropic
[03:46:06.820 --> 03:46:07.820]  Rainforest.
[03:46:07.820 --> 03:46:08.820]  It's $19.95.
[03:46:08.820 --> 03:46:11.820]  Leading competitors are $60 and aren't even as good.
[03:46:11.820 --> 03:46:13.820]  It's a great deal, normally, at $39.95.
[03:46:13.820 --> 03:46:15.820]  Rainforest, you've never tried it.
[03:46:15.820 --> 03:46:16.820]  This is a great opportunity.
[03:46:16.820 --> 03:46:18.820]  $19.95.
[03:46:18.820 --> 03:46:20.820]  Also, alpha power is 50% off.
[03:46:20.820 --> 03:46:23.820]  If you don't know what it's done for me and so many others for stamina,
[03:46:23.820 --> 03:46:26.820]  focus, libido, it does so many things.
[03:46:26.820 --> 03:46:30.820]  X2, even though we're having trouble sourcing the deep earth crystals
[03:46:30.820 --> 03:46:36.820]  of the good halogen iodine, I am blowing out the stockpile of it we have
[03:46:36.820 --> 03:46:39.820]  at least for another few days at 50% off.
[03:46:39.820 --> 03:46:43.820]  And then after that, it's going to go back to full price until we secure more of it.
[03:46:43.820 --> 03:46:46.820]  That's all folks.
[03:46:46.820 --> 03:47:14.820]  That's all folks.
[03:47:14.820 --> 03:47:40.820]  That's all folks.
[03:47:40.820 --> 03:47:52.820]  I did it my way.
[03:47:52.820 --> 03:47:57.820]  The great blue eyes Frank Sinatra.
[03:47:57.820 --> 03:47:59.820]  And, you know, you've done it your way.
[03:47:59.820 --> 03:48:00.820]  I've done it my way.
[03:48:00.820 --> 03:48:02.820]  The audience has done it their way, betting on info wars.
[03:48:02.820 --> 03:48:04.820]  And we're not just shameless.
[03:48:04.820 --> 03:48:07.820]  Everybody hikes things up like they're the tip of the spear, they're the vanguard.
[03:48:07.820 --> 03:48:10.820]  We're fighting globalism, it's in decline.
[03:48:10.820 --> 03:48:15.820]  But we're in that epic battle where we're just starting to get the initiative on them.
[03:48:15.820 --> 03:48:16.820]  They know it.
[03:48:16.820 --> 03:48:18.820]  They're putting their full force back.
[03:48:18.820 --> 03:48:22.820]  Everything they do is turning to piles of steaming Barack Obama.
[03:48:22.820 --> 03:48:27.820]  But at the same time, we can't overestimate our strengths.
[03:48:27.820 --> 03:48:29.820]  And I'm going to go back to your calls.
[03:48:29.820 --> 03:48:33.820]  Roger, I wanted to ask you about any other ace in the holes you think they've got.
[03:48:33.820 --> 03:48:35.820]  You know, there are thousands of ideologies in hell.
[03:48:35.820 --> 03:48:38.820]  There's probably 100,000 religions just in India alone.
[03:48:38.820 --> 03:48:42.820]  There's all these world systems and most of them are based on pure quackery.
[03:48:42.820 --> 03:48:45.820]  I follow renaissance, free open societies, Americana.
[03:48:45.820 --> 03:48:50.820]  It's proven to be the gold standard, the platinum standard, the ethereal standard,
[03:48:50.820 --> 03:48:55.820]  the infinity standard, the next level standard, the stairway to heaven standard.
[03:48:55.820 --> 03:48:59.820]  And we've proven by pushing just with what you've done in others, the audience,
[03:48:59.820 --> 03:49:00.820]  we're changing the world.
[03:49:00.820 --> 03:49:05.820]  We are the ideology trumping them, not just here, but all over the world.
[03:49:05.820 --> 03:49:10.820]  We are playing royal flush and ace of spades every hand.
[03:49:10.820 --> 03:49:12.820]  And because we were underdogs.
[03:49:12.820 --> 03:49:16.820]  And if folks don't see the hand of God on that, they're not paying attention.
[03:49:16.820 --> 03:49:18.820]  That's why I'm asking listeners.
[03:49:18.820 --> 03:49:21.820]  You're doing it your way, the American way.
[03:49:21.820 --> 03:49:24.820]  But that's why the left calls themselves the American way.
[03:49:24.820 --> 03:49:25.820]  They're the globalist way.
[03:49:25.820 --> 03:49:27.820]  It's always upside down with them.
[03:49:27.820 --> 03:49:32.820]  When you spread the word about the broadcast hand to hand, mouth to mouth,
[03:49:32.820 --> 03:49:33.820]  ear to ear, person to person.
[03:49:33.820 --> 03:49:36.820]  When you share the videos, the articles, when you sign up for the free newsletter
[03:49:36.820 --> 03:49:39.820]  at info wars.com newsletter, when you buy the products,
[03:49:39.820 --> 03:49:43.820]  when you support our local affiliates by becoming a sponsor,
[03:49:43.820 --> 03:49:48.820]  spreading the word or supporting the sponsors, you change the world.
[03:49:48.820 --> 03:49:51.820]  And that's why we've got stonedefensefund.com.
[03:49:51.820 --> 03:49:53.820]  We can go donate directly.
[03:49:53.820 --> 03:49:54.820]  He's under being sued by Obama.
[03:49:54.820 --> 03:49:56.820]  The globalist trying to shut him down.
[03:49:56.820 --> 03:50:01.820]  If we can crush them on this, stonedefensefund.com,
[03:50:01.820 --> 03:50:05.820]  we can truly see the fall of the deep state because they admit their attack on
[03:50:05.820 --> 03:50:09.820]  Roger Trump and myself is a beta test for everybody else to come after us,
[03:50:09.820 --> 03:50:11.820]  even bigger targets like drugs.
[03:50:11.820 --> 03:50:15.820]  So Alex Jones, legalfund.com.
[03:50:15.820 --> 03:50:17.820]  Alex Jones, legalfund.com, one word.
[03:50:17.820 --> 03:50:19.820]  We have links on infowars.com.
[03:50:19.820 --> 03:50:22.820]  You can go there and just donate directly, whether it's $25 or $100,
[03:50:22.820 --> 03:50:24.820]  or folks that are middle class and wealthy.
[03:50:24.820 --> 03:50:31.820]  You could not invest somewhere with money that will be used to go after the globalist fearlessly.
[03:50:31.820 --> 03:50:36.820]  You cannot, if you were dynamiting globalist bridges because they were invading your town,
[03:50:36.820 --> 03:50:39.820]  you couldn't for the money buy better dynamite.
[03:50:39.820 --> 03:50:41.820]  Alex, I think it's important people understand.
[03:50:41.820 --> 03:50:43.820]  We're not hyping this.
[03:50:43.820 --> 03:50:44.820]  They want to bankrupt him.
[03:50:44.820 --> 03:50:46.820]  They want to close info wars down.
[03:50:46.820 --> 03:50:48.820]  They want to shutter this place.
[03:50:48.820 --> 03:50:51.820]  They want to put me in jail because I supported Donald Trump.
[03:50:51.820 --> 03:50:54.820]  This is a real fight, folks. We need your help.
[03:50:54.820 --> 03:50:59.820]  And by the way, since you say that, even a few months ago,
[03:50:59.820 --> 03:51:02.820]  when they finally had like a whole bunch of Washington Post, New York Times saying,
[03:51:02.820 --> 03:51:06.820]  the war on Alex Jones, the legal war, the plan, we're going to destroy him,
[03:51:06.820 --> 03:51:07.820]  George County sued me.
[03:51:07.820 --> 03:51:09.820]  All of them, they go, wow, you're not joking.
[03:51:09.820 --> 03:51:12.820]  What you think I've ever joked with you about anything?
[03:51:12.820 --> 03:51:14.820]  We don't make stuff up like everybody else.
[03:51:14.820 --> 03:51:16.820]  It's straight shooting, man.
[03:51:16.820 --> 03:51:18.820]  You get what's going on.
[03:51:18.820 --> 03:51:21.820]  By somebody that doesn't sit around and act like they know what's going on.
[03:51:21.820 --> 03:51:22.820]  I research.
[03:51:22.820 --> 03:51:23.820]  Okay.
[03:51:23.820 --> 03:51:25.820]  And so, yes, we need your financial support.
[03:51:25.820 --> 03:51:27.820]  Free shipping ends this weekend.
[03:51:27.820 --> 03:51:30.820]  50% off selling items, but you can also just donate straight.
[03:51:30.820 --> 03:51:36.820]  Ladies and gentlemen at Alex Jones legal fund.com or stone defense fund.com for him as well.
[03:51:36.820 --> 03:51:37.820]  Roger, go ahead.
[03:51:37.820 --> 03:51:40.820]  So people need to understand this is a real fight.
[03:51:40.820 --> 03:51:42.820]  We're not just hyping this to build a war chest.
[03:51:42.820 --> 03:51:47.820]  As it is, Alex Jones takes everything that comes in through the store and he puts it back into the expansion.
[03:51:47.820 --> 03:51:50.820]  I've seen the incredible new studios that are coming online here.
[03:51:50.820 --> 03:51:55.820]  Well, I, I, I, I squirreled 5% away knowing this was coming for about four years,
[03:51:55.820 --> 03:51:58.820]  which really pisses them off because we can fight them for a while.
[03:51:58.820 --> 03:51:59.820]  I'm just looking long term.
[03:51:59.820 --> 03:52:01.820]  We've got to not get into the war chest.
[03:52:01.820 --> 03:52:03.820]  That's emergency backup.
[03:52:03.820 --> 03:52:04.820]  I'm now in reserve funds.
[03:52:04.820 --> 03:52:06.820]  We need to give you what I'm saying.
[03:52:06.820 --> 03:52:08.820]  I'm giving folks a point blank report.
[03:52:08.820 --> 03:52:09.820]  Even though I don't want sorrel snow.
[03:52:09.820 --> 03:52:10.820]  What's going on?
[03:52:10.820 --> 03:52:11.820]  I have to be truthful with you.
[03:52:11.820 --> 03:52:12.820]  Well, I'm asking for your help.
[03:52:12.820 --> 03:52:14.820]  I'm being sued by the DNC.
[03:52:14.820 --> 03:52:17.820]  I'm being sued by Obama's group.
[03:52:17.820 --> 03:52:22.820]  I've got a special prosecutor poking into every molecule of my being,
[03:52:22.820 --> 03:52:28.820]  searching for some bogus conjured up crime so he can pressure me into testifying.
[03:52:28.820 --> 03:52:30.820]  And in your statement a few weeks ago, you said,
[03:52:30.820 --> 03:52:34.820]  I'll never roll on President Trump because I'm loyal and because he never did anything.
[03:52:34.820 --> 03:52:35.820]  There's nothing there.
[03:52:35.820 --> 03:52:36.820]  Headlines everywhere.
[03:52:36.820 --> 03:52:39.820]  Stone admits he's got dirt, but says he won't roll.
[03:52:39.820 --> 03:52:45.820]  They took what you said in your message that took two minutes on air here and directly inverted it.
[03:52:45.820 --> 03:52:46.820]  Exactly.
[03:52:46.820 --> 03:52:53.820]  Because what they do as you know, Alex, is they pressure people into saying things that are not true.
[03:52:53.820 --> 03:52:55.820]  That are not true.
[03:52:55.820 --> 03:52:58.820]  You see, if you read this guy's story and this guy, Jonathan Chayot,
[03:52:58.820 --> 03:52:59.820]  I wrote a long piece on him.
[03:52:59.820 --> 03:53:03.820]  He is the single most duplicitous dishonest reporter in America today.
[03:53:03.820 --> 03:53:06.820]  I said, I'm no John Dean.
[03:53:06.820 --> 03:53:08.820]  He thinks John Dean's a hero.
[03:53:08.820 --> 03:53:11.820]  If he'd read my book, he would understand that John Dean is the man who planned,
[03:53:11.820 --> 03:53:15.820]  pushed, lied about, and covered up the Watergate break-in.
[03:53:15.820 --> 03:53:17.820]  I am not going to be John Dean.
[03:53:17.820 --> 03:53:19.820]  You're not going to manufacture crap.
[03:53:19.820 --> 03:53:20.820]  Exactly.
[03:53:20.820 --> 03:53:24.820]  I won't make stuff up, but that's what they try to pressure you to do.
[03:53:24.820 --> 03:53:29.820]  All these young people who have worked for me who are being squeezed right now by the special prosecutor,
[03:53:29.820 --> 03:53:32.820]  they're being pressured to say things that aren't true.
[03:53:32.820 --> 03:53:35.820]  That is the concern that we have.
[03:53:35.820 --> 03:53:36.820]  Absolutely.
[03:53:36.820 --> 03:53:38.820]  All right.
[03:53:38.820 --> 03:53:40.820]  Eliza, they pronounce it in Oregon.
[03:53:40.820 --> 03:53:42.820]  Thanks for holding her a real trooper.
[03:53:42.820 --> 03:53:44.820]  Elisa, now you're on the air.
[03:53:44.820 --> 03:53:45.820]  Go ahead.
[03:53:45.820 --> 03:53:47.820]  Hey, you got it right.
[03:53:47.820 --> 03:53:53.820]  A lot of people don't get my name right, but it's good to be on the phone with both you and with Roger Stone.
[03:53:53.820 --> 03:53:55.820]  I have a lot of respect for those of you gentlemen.
[03:53:55.820 --> 03:53:57.820]  Thank you.
[03:53:57.820 --> 03:53:59.820]  There's some kind of active providence.
[03:53:59.820 --> 03:54:02.820]  I was actually going to call in not only to talk about the IG report,
[03:54:02.820 --> 03:54:08.820]  but also to ask you if you could get Mark Taylor on as a guest and somebody beat me to the punch.
[03:54:08.820 --> 03:54:11.820]  But here's the thing.
[03:54:11.820 --> 03:54:14.820]  I don't know if you're still in contact with Larry Nichols or not,
[03:54:14.820 --> 03:54:18.820]  but I do know that if you're trying to get a hold of Mark Taylor to get him on your show,
[03:54:18.820 --> 03:54:22.820]  I know that Larry Nichols has been in contact with Mark Taylor.
[03:54:22.820 --> 03:54:26.820]  You know, it's time to get Larry Nichols back on anyway, especially during the 34-hour broadcast.
[03:54:26.820 --> 03:54:29.820]  So let's see if Larry can pop on today and separately.
[03:54:29.820 --> 03:54:30.820]  How are we doing with Mark Taylor?
[03:54:30.820 --> 03:54:32.820]  I've been wanting him for about a week.
[03:54:32.820 --> 03:54:34.820]  Are we going to get him?
[03:54:34.820 --> 03:54:36.820]  We're working on it. Go ahead.
[03:54:36.820 --> 03:54:38.820]  We've reached out to Taylor.
[03:54:38.820 --> 03:54:40.820]  Oh, that's awesome.
[03:54:40.820 --> 03:54:49.820]  And I don't know if you guys know about this, but there is a movie, a staphasm event movie across the country.
[03:54:49.820 --> 03:54:51.820]  Oh, he's got a big movie coming out about it.
[03:54:51.820 --> 03:54:53.820]  Oh, that's why I want to get him on now, yeah.
[03:54:53.820 --> 03:54:56.820]  Yeah, I think it's coming out October 4th and 5th.
[03:54:56.820 --> 03:54:58.820]  And so I want to get the word out about that as well.
[03:54:58.820 --> 03:55:02.820]  And he also has a book called The Trump Prophecies too.
[03:55:02.820 --> 03:55:07.820]  So if people want to spread the word about that, I think it's a good thing.
[03:55:07.820 --> 03:55:08.820]  Yeah, we're working to get him on.
[03:55:08.820 --> 03:55:09.820]  We've been working for a week to get him on.
[03:55:09.820 --> 03:55:11.820]  So we're just going to get him into a slot, get him on.
[03:55:11.820 --> 03:55:12.820]  Absolutely.
[03:55:12.820 --> 03:55:13.820]  What do you think about that?
[03:55:13.820 --> 03:55:16.820]  I'd like to call it on the subject that was listed about IG report.
[03:55:16.820 --> 03:55:19.820]  What do you make of its double speaking behavior?
[03:55:19.820 --> 03:55:21.820]  And what do you think is going on there?
[03:55:21.820 --> 03:55:23.820]  Well, here's the thing.
[03:55:23.820 --> 03:55:28.820]  I mean, there was a part of me that was like really excited because I thought, you know,
[03:55:28.820 --> 03:55:33.820]  because everybody was saying that, oh, this guy, you know, he's an Obama appointee,
[03:55:33.820 --> 03:55:37.820]  but he's not a biased person, you know.
[03:55:37.820 --> 03:55:41.820]  And I see his report reporting, you know, all these leaks are coming out of it.
[03:55:41.820 --> 03:55:44.820]  They're damaging and they're spot on.
[03:55:44.820 --> 03:55:48.820]  And then he puts up this almost James Comey-like statement like, oh,
[03:55:48.820 --> 03:55:52.820]  we have all these crimes here, but we're not going to do anything about it kind of thing.
[03:55:52.820 --> 03:55:55.820]  Well, yeah, but see, that's what I'm saying is you have to look at it.
[03:55:55.820 --> 03:55:59.820]  It's damning information that Obama was involved in the illegal secret server and lied about it
[03:55:59.820 --> 03:56:03.820]  and that they were trying to stop Trump and trying to, that's all totally confirming.
[03:56:03.820 --> 03:56:05.820]  Then they say, oh, but none of it's criminal.
[03:56:05.820 --> 03:56:06.820]  Well, that's not their job to even say that.
[03:56:06.820 --> 03:56:07.820]  What do you think the point of that?
[03:56:07.820 --> 03:56:08.820]  Thank you, ma'am.
[03:56:08.820 --> 03:56:09.820]  Appreciate you.
[03:56:09.820 --> 03:56:11.820]  What do you think the point of that is?
[03:56:11.820 --> 03:56:12.820]  Where is Jeff Sessions?
[03:56:12.820 --> 03:56:13.820]  Where is he today?
[03:56:13.820 --> 03:56:17.820]  Why hasn't he announced prosecutions against those who have broken the law?
[03:56:17.820 --> 03:56:18.820]  Why is he entirely silent?
[03:56:18.820 --> 03:56:22.820]  It all keeps coming back to the Kebler elf himself.
[03:56:22.820 --> 03:56:28.820]  The president needs to replace Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein and get himself an attorney general
[03:56:28.820 --> 03:56:32.820]  who's committed to the rule of law and will hold these people accountable.
[03:56:32.820 --> 03:56:34.820]  This was a bureaucratic exercise yesterday.
[03:56:34.820 --> 03:56:35.820]  That's a good point, though.
[03:56:35.820 --> 03:56:37.820]  I mean, what's wrong with the Kebler?
[03:56:37.820 --> 03:56:39.820]  Nothing will come of this.
[03:56:39.820 --> 03:56:45.820]  So we learned bombshell thing yesterday, Comey, others, blatant illegality.
[03:56:45.820 --> 03:56:48.820]  I still predict that nobody will pay any penalty for it.
[03:56:48.820 --> 03:56:54.820]  I heard the Kebler elf is writing his magic stallion, the hamster Lemmy Wicks.
[03:56:54.820 --> 03:56:59.820]  At this point, I think he is so upset about the president's public position supporting
[03:56:59.820 --> 03:57:03.820]  state legalized marijuana of about two weeks ago.
[03:57:03.820 --> 03:57:09.820]  And he doesn't want minimum sentences for black people that are worse than white people.
[03:57:09.820 --> 03:57:11.820]  So he needs to go.
