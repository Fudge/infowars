[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:07.232]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that is really, really an awful situation.
[00:00:07.232 --> 00:00:09.453]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:00:09.453 --> 00:00:22.059]  We love the American people.
[00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:24.280]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.781]  We love the American people.
[00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:27.182]  We love the American people.
[00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.531]  We love the American people.
[00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:45.416]  They came in peace.
[00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:47.676]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:56.820]  We love the American people.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.940]  This is CNN.
[00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:06.224]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:01:10.698 --> 00:01:13.120]  I have the greatest supporters in the world.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.342]  By the way, they're the smartest.
[00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:16.783]  They're the hardest working.
[00:01:16.783 --> 00:01:18.204]  They pay taxes.
[00:01:18.204 --> 00:01:19.325]  They're incredible.
[00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:20.706]  They're loyal.
[00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:21.807]  I have the bikers.
[00:01:21.807 --> 00:01:25.450]  I have the construction workers.
[00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.292]  I have them all.
[00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:28.913]  By the way, I have the FBI.
[00:01:28.913 --> 00:01:35.458]  You go into the FBI and take a poll of the real FBI, not the scum on top, not Comey and that group of people that are total thieves.
[00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:36.139]  Most of those are gone.
[00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:40.783]  Well, I don't know how Peter Strzok is still working there, to be honest with you.
[00:01:40.783 --> 00:01:41.604]  He's working in HR.
[00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:44.027]  That's even worse.
[00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:48.172]  We are transferring power from Washington, D.C.
[00:01:48.172 --> 00:01:50.975]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:01:55.487 --> 00:01:59.451]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:02.013]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:02:02.013 --> 00:02:07.659]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.185]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:25.790]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.571]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:35.772]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[00:02:35.772 --> 00:02:40.393]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:45.614]  From the front lines of the info room, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:57.350]  And here we are a year and a half later and Trump has miraculously been delivering.
[00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.791]  I did a little happy birthday live feed last night.
[00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:03.551]  So I hadn't really done a happy birthday for the president during my four hours.
[00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.032]  I did.
[00:03:05.032 --> 00:03:10.193]  And I noticed some of the comments on YouTube and on InfoWars were like, oh grovel to President Trump.
[00:03:10.193 --> 00:03:14.574]  Can you get your head any further up his rear end?
[00:03:14.574 --> 00:03:16.674]  I love the instant gratification society.
[00:03:18.322 --> 00:03:21.524]  We almost had Hillary, and the total shutdown of America was planned.
[00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:24.405]  They thought they had us in the back.
[00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:40.614]  Then we got Trump, and he has, miraculously, like he has a magic wand or something, turned things around, and you can see it's getting so much better, and the globalists are so upset.
[00:03:40.614 --> 00:03:43.415]  And, you know, I'm risking my life, my name, my treasure.
[00:03:43.415 --> 00:03:45.436]  I'm under massive attack for this.
[00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:46.277]  So let me tell you something.
[00:03:47.173 --> 00:03:58.080]  It makes it even more valuable to me, and quite frankly, I savor it, that we're rolling back the abortion garbage.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.263]  That we're rolling back the death mills, euthanizing the veterans with the death list.
[00:04:03.263 --> 00:04:11.128]  That we're rolling back the completely open borders, that we're rolling back Hollywood, that everything in the system is falling apart.
[00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:16.031]  And the American system's coming back, and to see the big peace deals, and historic ceasefire now in Afghanistan.
[00:04:18.268 --> 00:04:22.390]  Because Trump knows the globalists wanted to keep all these crises and wars and things going forever.
[00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.514]  That's why everything's turning so quickly, because he's pragmatically going in and changing it.
[00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:37.899]  So, yeah, I've risked my life and my name and my treasure and my honor to try to turn things around, and when I see it turning around, I get tears in my eyes.
[00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:45.663]  And to know Trump is doing such a great job, yeah, I got mad at him about some of the things he's done that I disagree with, but overall, he's doing a great job, and we're blessed.
[00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.002]  So I'm very thankful to God for you and for Trump and for my family and this crew.
[00:04:53.002 --> 00:04:55.046]  I mean, we are witnessing history.
[00:04:55.046 --> 00:04:58.253]  If we're successful, humanity's got a real shot at the future.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.841]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:06:16.018 --> 00:06:17.562]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:06:28.448 --> 00:06:33.490]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have Roger Stone riding shotgun with us in the second and third hour.
[00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:40.412]  We have the spokesman for Tommy Robinson, Kalen Robertson, joining us.
[00:06:40.412 --> 00:06:46.993]  He gave us the exclusive intel on Tuesday that Tommy had been taken to a high-security prison, 71% Muslim.
[00:06:48.902 --> 00:06:53.346]  Despite the fact that lawyers and people were telling him not to go on air, Tommy told him to.
[00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:58.750]  And for a day I saw disinfo articles and comments online saying Jones made this up.
[00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.815]  Kind of like they ordered no reporting of Tommy Robinson the first two days he was arrested.
[00:07:04.815 --> 00:07:11.881]  And they arrested him for just reporting that there was a trial of Muslims for giant pedophile rings going on.
[00:07:11.881 --> 00:07:13.262]  That's how they work it in England.
[00:07:15.526 --> 00:07:22.470]  And now it's in the British news today.
[00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:28.353]  Now it's in the British news today.
[00:07:28.353 --> 00:07:34.496]  Three, four days after we broke it that indeed he was taken to a maximum security prison.
[00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:35.537]  We just said high security.
[00:07:36.573 --> 00:07:39.716]  And that he was put in the Muslim wing.
[00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:44.741]  They're spinning it going, Jones and others said it was a 71% Muslim prison.
[00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:46.643]  Well, that's what Tommy told him.
[00:07:46.643 --> 00:07:48.164]  No, no, it's worse than that.
[00:07:48.164 --> 00:07:53.769]  Tommy was stuck in the Muslim wing.
[00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:58.454]  So now they're arguing, oh, the prison's only half Muslim.
[00:07:58.454 --> 00:08:00.656]  The wing he was stuck in was 70 plus percent.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.041]  So they play these games to always change the subject.
[00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:09.942]  But now it's all over the British News.
[00:08:09.942 --> 00:08:21.026]  Why is Tommy Robinson, who's already been attacked in prison before, and you've got all these guys that expose radical Islam being killed in prison, the guy that put a piece of bacon, you know, on the front step got stabbed to death.
[00:08:21.026 --> 00:08:27.388]  So now we're having a debate about should he be killed in prison, three days later.
[00:08:27.388 --> 00:08:28.668]  And that's what I deal with here.
[00:08:31.493 --> 00:08:50.048]  Let me just say this right now, and I got a call right before I went live, so I've got to call him back during the break, but I have multiple sources in and around Elon Musk, in and around Kanye West, and I've told you that Kanye West and Elon Musk are working together.
[00:08:50.048 --> 00:08:51.530]  I've told you they're working with Trump.
[00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:58.636]  The bad guys know that, but Elon Musk and Kanye West and others, would Trump have a rollout of this?
[00:08:59.824 --> 00:09:12.252]  Where then Kardashian comes down, Kim Kardashian, and then he signs a pardon for a black lady been in prison for 35 years on a nonviolent drug conviction.
[00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:15.814]  And then a bunch of leftist black organizations say, oh, you're not going to do anything.
[00:09:15.814 --> 00:09:17.315]  He said, really?
[00:09:17.315 --> 00:09:18.655]  Give me some legislation.
[00:09:18.655 --> 00:09:24.779]  I'm trying to put some together right now to end mandatory sentences that target blacks.
[00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:28.361]  I intend to have Congress pass a law removing what Clinton did in 1994.
[00:09:32.403 --> 00:09:40.105]  And the Jets football team that was running its mouth, and the NAACP, they shut their mouths real fast.
[00:09:40.105 --> 00:09:54.629]  We're talking about hundreds of thousands of non-violent black inmates, who because they were selling crack cocaine, you get three times the sentence for the same amount of powdered cocaine that's the rich white guy drug.
[00:09:56.978 --> 00:10:03.701]  And Trump is saying we're going to end that where Hillary called black people dogs that must be brought to heel.
[00:10:03.701 --> 00:10:04.802]  Oh, you want to see the video again?
[00:10:04.802 --> 00:10:08.024]  I don't like looking at her, hearing her voice.
[00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:15.607]  If you want to search engine it, when Hillary called black people dogs and said bring them to heel and super predators.
[00:10:15.607 --> 00:10:16.368]  I can't look at her.
[00:10:16.368 --> 00:10:17.308]  I can't listen to it anymore.
[00:10:17.308 --> 00:10:18.849]  I'm serious.
[00:10:18.849 --> 00:10:20.650]  And it's not just because she's spouting racist stuff.
[00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.612]  It's that she's such a disgusting hypocrite who then runs all this race baiting garbage.
[00:10:28.001 --> 00:10:30.882]  You wanna go watch the clip from C-SPAN, 1996.
[00:10:30.882 --> 00:10:34.985]  Now there it is.
[00:10:34.985 --> 00:10:36.906]  Get it off the screen.
[00:10:36.906 --> 00:10:38.446]  Oh, look, she's such a vampire.
[00:10:38.446 --> 00:10:41.488]  Oh my goodness.
[00:10:41.488 --> 00:10:42.929]  Just get her off, get her off.
[00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:44.750]  I've already seen the clip 200 times.
[00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.190]  I can't look at it.
[00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.672]  Hillary is triggering to me.
[00:10:48.672 --> 00:10:52.674]  She's got her official law firms suing me.
[00:10:52.674 --> 00:10:55.255]  They're financing all these demonization attacks on me.
[00:10:58.032 --> 00:11:11.822]  And I'm not stupid, but I've talked to high-level people that are smarter than I am, and they say, 100% Alex, they're preparing the ground for you to be assassinated, so that you're so demonized, pre-assassination, people buy it.
[00:11:11.822 --> 00:11:12.923]  I'm not stupid.
[00:11:12.923 --> 00:11:14.884]  They know they're gonna lose all these lawsuits.
[00:11:14.884 --> 00:11:21.249]  They are preparing my public crucifixion, and then execution.
[00:11:21.249 --> 00:11:23.150]  Doesn't matter they're going down, that's all that matters.
[00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.651]  I feel very satisfied, quite frankly.
[00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:25.772]  I feel very good.
[00:11:27.108 --> 00:11:39.419]  But getting back to the whole Kanye West-Elon Musk situation, they've been trying to crash Elon Musk companies, all of them have been targeted.
[00:11:39.419 --> 00:11:49.847]  You notice Sylvester Stallone has come out in support of Trump when he ran for president and since, so they have a woman from 1990, that's 28 years ago, saying he raped her.
[00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:56.500]  Totally made up.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.400]  That's what the Democrats do.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.784]  Because I know people that know Sylvester Stallone.
[00:12:00.784 --> 00:12:03.166]  He's super nice to women.
[00:12:03.166 --> 00:12:04.887]  Spoils the hell out of them.
[00:12:04.887 --> 00:12:06.208]  I've worked out at his private gym.
[00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:09.712]  I've never met Stallone, but I've worked out with his friends at his private gym.
[00:12:09.712 --> 00:12:11.133]  Up there where he keeps his cars.
[00:12:11.133 --> 00:12:13.935]  He's got like a three-story building in the middle of LA.
[00:12:13.935 --> 00:12:18.119]  And I know women that know him, and it's absolute horse manure.
[00:12:18.119 --> 00:12:22.063]  Sylvester Stallone has a lot of courage, folks, to support Trump during the campaign,
[00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.212]  And now to support him, and to be trying to get black folks out of prison.
[00:12:27.212 --> 00:12:28.513]  He's been spearheading that.
[00:12:28.513 --> 00:12:30.074]  And what does he get?
[00:12:30.074 --> 00:12:34.537]  Some made-up 28-year thing when there's not even, there's a statute of limitations in California.
[00:12:34.537 --> 00:12:37.358]  They passed a law now where there's not one, but it's only active after 2017.
[00:12:37.358 --> 00:12:46.824]  So you gotta ask, why on earth would you even be seeing this?
[00:12:46.824 --> 00:12:48.585]  Why would the police put this announcement out?
[00:12:50.418 --> 00:13:02.167]  They're in Southern California to purely demonize him and to smoke screen Weinstein where you've got his driver, his butler, his assistant saying, yeah, he raped women basically every night.
[00:13:02.167 --> 00:13:03.868]  He weighs 280 pounds.
[00:13:03.868 --> 00:13:06.731]  He likes 95 pound women that look like they're 12 years old.
[00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:13.456]  He climbs on top of them and rapes them in the back of the limo.
[00:13:13.456 --> 00:13:16.378]  Those are real witnesses.
[00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:18.279]  Those are real people that have come forward.
[00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:19.740]  These are real indictments.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.845]  Not 28 years ago, but from a couple years ago.
[00:13:25.845 --> 00:13:30.750]  So, that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:36.176]  And I have experienced this.
[00:13:36.176 --> 00:13:41.782]  The main lawyers for the Clintons in California, Garagos and Garagos, remember them?
[00:13:41.782 --> 00:13:42.623]  Michael Jackson's lawyers?
[00:13:43.973 --> 00:13:49.336]  Filed an EEOC thing on me that is total horse manure fiction.
[00:13:49.336 --> 00:13:53.418]  I wear swastika shoes?
[00:13:53.418 --> 00:13:54.759]  Total lie.
[00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:59.081]  I telepathically try to have gay sex with people?
[00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:03.703]  Bizarre.
[00:14:03.703 --> 00:14:08.025]  But people talk in Hollywood, people that were on the phone calls.
[00:14:08.025 --> 00:14:10.867]  So, no weapon formed against us shall prosper, but let me tell you.
[00:14:12.708 --> 00:14:17.513]  They mean bigness.
[00:14:17.513 --> 00:14:19.675]  That's the headline, Alex Jones Gay Grooming.
[00:14:19.675 --> 00:14:35.009]  You read 10 pages into the 20-something page Daily Mail and it says, Jones never said anything sexual towards the male employee, but the male employee felt like Jones wanted to have sex with him.
[00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:36.831]  So see, I know what this feels like.
[00:14:39.653 --> 00:14:47.155]  And by the way, I know for a fact the Democratic Party has scoured with major bounties for anybody that will lie about me.
[00:14:47.155 --> 00:15:06.000]  But the good news is I have led such a pretty boring, focused, workaholic life that they, despite the fact that they put unbelievable amounts of money on the street and PIs and these slimy so-called reporters, they came up zero.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.460]  ZERO.
[00:15:12.386 --> 00:15:14.167]  So now what are they gonna do?
[00:15:14.167 --> 00:15:19.991]  Just like I predicted, they had all the big labs test my supplements, come up totally clean?
[00:15:19.991 --> 00:15:21.932]  We know we're targets.
[00:15:21.932 --> 00:15:23.773]  We test our stuff to California standards.
[00:15:23.773 --> 00:15:25.595]  What happened next, huh?
[00:15:25.595 --> 00:15:29.397]  Wasn't hard to predict, was it?
[00:15:29.397 --> 00:15:36.862]  You can leave a can of supplements open in the open air in a parking garage for three seconds and it'll fail test after that.
[00:15:38.703 --> 00:15:39.784]  We had the stuff tested.
[00:15:39.784 --> 00:15:41.406]  They tested and said they found a little bit of lead in.
[00:15:41.406 --> 00:15:42.647]  Didn't have it.
[00:15:42.647 --> 00:15:44.068]  It had six labs tested.
[00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:45.710]  We're going to court.
[00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.813]  I have to countersuit.
[00:15:48.813 --> 00:15:50.855]  They're not playing games here, that's what I'm telling you.
[00:15:50.855 --> 00:15:51.876]  Gloves are off?
[00:15:51.876 --> 00:15:53.137]  Hey, our gloves are off with you.
[00:15:53.137 --> 00:15:57.661]  We come back, Trump's powerful announcement that the top of the FBI is led by criminal scum.
[00:15:57.661 --> 00:15:58.062]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.272 --> 00:16:02.733]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.

[00:16:15.798 --> 00:16:22.060]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?

[00:17:00.017 --> 00:17:01.877]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[00:19:05.808 --> 00:19:06.368]  Thanks for calling.
[00:19:06.368 --> 00:19:07.808]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:19:07.808 --> 00:19:11.410]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:24.514]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was pretty cool, and read all the books, and seen all the DVDs, and followed all your guests.
[00:19:24.674 --> 00:19:36.184]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield, and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:36.964]  Thank you, brother.
[00:19:36.964 --> 00:19:45.552]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:19:45.552 --> 00:19:50.456]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:19:50.456 --> 00:19:52.958]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[00:20:03.584 --> 00:20:17.113]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that is really, really an awful situation.
[00:20:17.113 --> 00:20:19.334]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:20.715]  We love the American people.
[00:20:31.895 --> 00:20:34.137]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:20:34.137 --> 00:20:35.638]  We love the American people.
[00:20:35.638 --> 00:20:39.021]  We love the American people.
[00:20:39.021 --> 00:20:40.542]  We love the American people.
[00:20:40.542 --> 00:20:55.315]  They came in peace.
[00:20:55.315 --> 00:20:57.517]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:20:57.517 --> 00:20:58.818]  We love the American people.
[00:21:06.681 --> 00:21:07.964]  This is CNN.
[00:21:07.964 --> 00:21:16.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:21:20.353 --> 00:21:22.775]  I have the greatest supporters in the world.
[00:21:22.775 --> 00:21:24.996]  By the way, they're the smartest.
[00:21:24.996 --> 00:21:26.417]  They're the hardest working.
[00:21:26.417 --> 00:21:27.858]  They pay taxes.
[00:21:27.858 --> 00:21:28.978]  They're incredible.
[00:21:28.978 --> 00:21:30.339]  They're loyal.
[00:21:30.339 --> 00:21:31.440]  I have the bikers.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.102]  I have the construction workers.
[00:21:35.102 --> 00:21:36.943]  I have them all.
[00:21:36.943 --> 00:21:38.564]  By the way, I have the FBI.
[00:21:38.564 --> 00:21:42.727]  You go into the FBI and take a poll of the real FBI, not the scum on top.
[00:21:42.727 --> 00:21:45.048]  Not Comey and that group of people that are total thieves.
[00:21:45.048 --> 00:21:45.789]  Most of those are gone.
[00:21:46.829 --> 00:21:49.872]  Well, I don't know how Peter Strzok is still working there, to be honest with you, okay?
[00:21:49.872 --> 00:21:50.412]  He's working in HR.
[00:21:50.412 --> 00:21:50.953]  That's even worse.
[00:21:50.953 --> 00:21:52.294]  Well, we've had time to beaver away through the 500 pages.
[00:21:52.294 --> 00:22:00.160]  499, excuse me, of actual pages and then a whole bunch of other appendices in the appendix.
[00:22:16.028 --> 00:22:18.149]  And it's incredible.
[00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:25.750]  Obama and his spokespersons lied to Congress and said that they never communicated with Hillary via the secret server email.
[00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:32.512]  It's funny how Trump keeps calling it a gang of 13.
[00:22:32.512 --> 00:22:38.754]  She communicated with 13 people on the server.
[00:22:38.754 --> 00:22:42.614]  We now know, according to the Inspector General report.
[00:22:42.614 --> 00:22:44.475]  And remember Richard Reeves during the campaign?
[00:22:45.822 --> 00:22:59.010]  Early in the campaign, our incredible reporter, he asked Hillary, hey, we've got intel that your server was broken into by foreign governments.
[00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.151]  Let's cue that up.
[00:23:00.151 --> 00:23:05.614]  InfoWars reporter asked Hillary about her, about foreign governments, or about the hacking of her server, was the headline.
[00:23:05.614 --> 00:23:06.194]  Early 2016.
[00:23:06.194 --> 00:23:12.758]  And she looks at him and says, that's outrageous, because we broke that with our sources.
[00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:13.419]  Colonel Schaefer,
[00:23:14.445 --> 00:23:23.911]  With his high-level Pentagon sources and the London group, on this show, said the word was that she was dumping stuff on the server like a park bench.
[00:23:23.911 --> 00:23:36.718]  You know, in the old days, you'd go give the Chinese or the Russians or whoever you were selling the country out to, you'd put it in a park bench, you'd put it in a trash can, you know, you'd put it in a McDonald's bag and throw it in a trash can, and somebody would come along and get it out of the trash can.
[00:23:36.718 --> 00:23:39.740]  It's called a drop box, a drop site.
[00:23:43.083 --> 00:23:47.725]  Or you put it under your own, you know, orange traffic cone or under a bush in a certain spot in the park.
[00:23:47.725 --> 00:24:04.113]  Well, the way you do it even better than that with plausible deniability is, you just have tens of thousands of secret, you know, emails from the State Department that you send yourself to have on there, and then you let all these foreign governments kind of orgy in on it.
[00:24:04.113 --> 00:24:06.274]  That's on page 89, exhibit 75.
[00:24:06.274 --> 00:24:11.296]  We have it on screen for TV viewers.
[00:24:13.388 --> 00:24:30.923]  FBI analyst and prosecutor, number two, told us that former President Barack Obama was one of the 13 individuals with whom Clinton had direct contact using her Clinton.com account.
[00:24:30.923 --> 00:24:32.925]  ClintonMail.com account.
[00:24:32.925 --> 00:24:39.711]  Obama, like other high-level government officials, used a pseudonym for the username on his official government
[00:24:41.147 --> 00:24:42.068]  Email account.
[00:24:42.068 --> 00:24:43.348]  Wow!
[00:24:43.348 --> 00:24:50.753]  So you've got them on secret illegal servers using code names.
[00:24:50.753 --> 00:24:53.375]  You know, like when you rob a bank, you don't say, Hey, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:53.375 --> 00:24:55.636]  I'm robbing the bank.
[00:24:55.636 --> 00:24:59.699]  When you and your buddies go in there wearing, you know, president's mask or whatever you do.
[00:24:59.699 --> 00:25:03.581]  I'm Bugsy and I'm Bob and I'm lucky.
[00:25:03.581 --> 00:25:06.083]  And you're going to be lucky if you hurry up and put that money in the bags.
[00:25:06.083 --> 00:25:08.104]  I don't splatter your brains all over the walls.
[00:25:11.129 --> 00:25:12.809]  And now it's all out.
[00:25:12.809 --> 00:25:14.690]  So can we look that up?
[00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.251]  Infowars asked Hillary about the hacking of her server.
[00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:20.372]  That's the headline.
[00:25:20.372 --> 00:25:22.192]  Early 2016.
[00:25:22.192 --> 00:25:26.473]  Richard Reeves is the reporter.
[00:25:26.473 --> 00:25:28.434]  People ask, where's Richard?
[00:25:28.434 --> 00:25:31.635]  Richard's been taking care of his 93-year-old mother.
[00:25:31.635 --> 00:25:32.355]  And he's a great guy.
[00:25:32.355 --> 00:25:33.175]  He's a private guy.
[00:25:33.175 --> 00:25:34.275]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:25:34.275 --> 00:25:36.056]  He had a heart attack.
[00:25:37.099 --> 00:25:38.020]  He's with us.
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:38.840]  He's been through a lot.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.680]  Pray for Richard.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.982]  That's where Richard's been for two years.
[00:25:41.982 --> 00:25:43.222]  I just get asked, where's Richard Reeves?
[00:25:43.222 --> 00:25:43.722]  All the time.
[00:25:43.722 --> 00:25:46.224]  So I just went and said it, so everybody knows.
[00:25:46.224 --> 00:25:49.425]  Yeah, yeah, let's get the audio of this queued up as soon as we can.
[00:25:49.425 --> 00:25:50.926]  Only has 89,000 views.
[00:25:50.926 --> 00:25:53.087]  And look, my memory's good.
[00:25:53.087 --> 00:25:54.188]  I said January 2016.
[00:25:57.318 --> 00:25:58.578]  I just told you, early 2016.
[00:25:58.578 --> 00:26:04.780]  See, my memory is still on sometimes, but it used to be photographic.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.601]  It was almost a curse, though.
[00:26:06.601 --> 00:26:14.963]  But I guess drinking and getting old and stuff like that, missing your sleep, working hard, you kind of lose that magic.
[00:26:14.963 --> 00:26:18.825]  You start losing a lot of brain cells by about age 30, just naturally.
[00:26:18.825 --> 00:26:21.786]  But see, photographic, folks.
[00:26:21.786 --> 00:26:24.546]  Anyways, I am digressing.
[00:26:24.546 --> 00:26:26.407]  I have shadows of the old photographic memory.
[00:26:28.297 --> 00:26:34.182]  So we're going to get that clip in to the old TriCaster in there and play that for you coming up in the next segment.
[00:26:34.182 --> 00:26:35.543]  We post this to YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
[00:26:35.543 --> 00:26:37.304]  We should probably just add this onto the segment.
[00:26:37.304 --> 00:26:42.749]  But side issue, it's a big, big, big deal.
[00:26:42.749 --> 00:26:47.152]  And it's one more thing where you get next year's news today.
[00:26:47.152 --> 00:26:50.235]  Well, actually, that's the news of a year and a half from now today.
[00:26:51.554 --> 00:26:56.615]  And we also told you that Strzok was running a whole ring-leading system to bring down the president and keep him from being elected.
[00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:59.516]  Now we have that word-for-word.
[00:26:59.516 --> 00:27:04.477]  And again, they all lied to Congress.
[00:27:04.477 --> 00:27:08.878]  Finally, and related to nothing, but I just saw my first Bernie Sanders bumper sticker.
[00:27:08.878 --> 00:27:10.738]  Made me want to key the car.
[00:27:10.738 --> 00:27:13.718]  They're such worshippers of Hillary.
[00:27:13.718 --> 00:27:16.579]  He's an idiot like Trump.
[00:27:16.579 --> 00:27:19.200]  Figure they cancel each other out.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.900]  No, Hillary canceled herself out.
[00:27:22.327 --> 00:27:26.049]  As bad as Bernie is, he's no Hillary.
[00:27:26.049 --> 00:27:28.311]  Trump's not going to ever become president, right?
[00:27:28.311 --> 00:27:29.271]  Right?
[00:27:29.271 --> 00:27:30.792]  August 8, 2016.
[00:27:30.792 --> 00:27:31.853]  No, no he won't.
[00:27:31.853 --> 00:27:33.994]  We'll stop it!
[00:27:33.994 --> 00:27:35.635]  There's no need to fear!
[00:27:35.635 --> 00:27:38.617]  Peter Strzok and his little girlfriend are here!
[00:27:38.617 --> 00:27:40.318]  Dun-da-dun!
[00:27:40.318 --> 00:27:43.961]  We'll stand in the will of America and the voters!
[00:27:43.961 --> 00:27:46.662]  We'll call them Russians, yes!
[00:27:46.662 --> 00:27:48.784]  We'll call Roger Stone, Alex Jones, and...
[00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:52.587]  Donald Trump and all these super patriots.
[00:27:52.587 --> 00:27:53.207]  What do we do?
[00:27:53.207 --> 00:27:56.148]  We're traitors to foreign countries like China.
[00:27:56.148 --> 00:27:57.549]  We're all in bed with Russia.
[00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:58.909]  It's come out.
[00:27:58.909 --> 00:28:00.870]  We covered up the Russia gate for Hillary.
[00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.050]  What do we do?
[00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.271]  Let's say they're all traitors.
[00:28:04.271 --> 00:28:06.992]  Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
[00:28:06.992 --> 00:28:09.193]  How do they say in German?
[00:28:09.193 --> 00:28:11.694]  Wunderbar!
[00:28:11.694 --> 00:28:12.754]  Haha!
[00:28:12.754 --> 00:28:14.615]  Nein!
[00:28:14.615 --> 00:28:15.635]  Du hast mich!
[00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:19.782]  But I'm afraid we can't take the risk.
[00:28:19.782 --> 00:28:26.927]  It's like an insurance policy, the unlikely event you die before you're 40.
[00:28:26.927 --> 00:28:27.507]  That's right.
[00:28:27.507 --> 00:28:29.408]  We've got to make up this stuff.
[00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:30.829]  We've got to do it.
[00:28:30.829 --> 00:28:31.389]  Right now?
[00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:36.372]  But all of it's going up in flames.
[00:28:36.372 --> 00:28:44.437]  All the delusions of grandeur are falling like little sandcastles made by children as the high tide rushes in.
[00:28:45.285 --> 00:28:53.991]  But this high tide is the hard, cold acid of truth that will burn through this cancer.
[00:28:53.991 --> 00:28:57.873]  And in the ashes of the cancer, the phoenix is rising.
[00:28:57.873 --> 00:28:59.434]  More critical intel straight ahead.
[00:28:59.434 --> 00:29:02.476]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[00:29:02.476 --> 00:29:06.459]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[00:29:06.459 --> 00:29:07.720]  The bug assault.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.303]  A miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[00:29:12.643 --> 00:29:14.665]  Non-toxic and no batteries required.
[00:29:14.665 --> 00:29:15.645]  So much fun!
[00:29:15.645 --> 00:29:18.147]  You'll forget you have a wife and kids!

[00:29:29.156 --> 00:29:31.397]  You have been lied to.
[00:29:31.397 --> 00:29:33.137]  My name is Kevin Shipp.
[00:29:33.137 --> 00:29:35.818]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[00:29:35.818 --> 00:29:41.160]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:46.842]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:29:46.842 --> 00:29:50.283]  We gotta get this out, because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.
[00:29:50.283 --> 00:29:53.384]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:07.876]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:30:07.876 --> 00:30:08.336]  It's you!
[00:30:09.457 --> 00:30:11.639]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:30:11.639 --> 00:30:20.345]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:30:20.345 --> 00:30:24.948]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:26.389]  You are the info war.
[00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:29.912]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:30:30.592 --> 00:30:32.073]  We are the renaissance, and we are winning!
[00:31:00.054 --> 00:31:10.657]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:31:10.657 --> 00:31:12.717]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:31:12.717 --> 00:31:15.578]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:31:15.578 --> 00:31:17.078]  It's made in the USA.
[00:31:17.078 --> 00:31:20.199]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:31:20.439 --> 00:31:20.859]  Absolutely.
[00:31:40.785 --> 00:31:52.495]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:31:52.495 --> 00:31:55.798]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:31:55.798 --> 00:31:59.401]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:03.907]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:03.907 --> 00:32:07.189]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:07.189 --> 00:32:13.451]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:13.451 --> 00:32:16.232]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:16.972 --> 00:32:20.793]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:20.793 --> 00:32:27.275]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:27.275 --> 00:32:32.217]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.892]  Next, we tested the water from our AlexaPure gravity filter.
[00:32:36.892 --> 00:32:44.096]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:44.096 --> 00:32:48.798]  As it turns out, the filter on the AlexaPure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:48.798 --> 00:32:55.022]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:55.022 --> 00:32:58.984]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:02.788 --> 00:33:21.699]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.699 --> 00:33:28.243]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:31.821 --> 00:33:35.950]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:39.036]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:33:43.294 --> 00:33:47.238]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:33:47.238 --> 00:33:49.821]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:55.447]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:33:55.447 --> 00:34:02.514]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[00:34:07.435 --> 00:34:13.640]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:19.405]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[00:34:19.405 --> 00:34:23.588]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[00:34:23.588 --> 00:34:28.392]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[00:34:28.392 --> 00:34:33.215]  From the front lines of the Infoworld, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:36.907 --> 00:34:40.248]  Well, the deep state has struck back.
[00:34:40.248 --> 00:34:41.169]  Reuters is reporting that
[00:35:05.848 --> 00:35:14.834]  Paul Manafort supposedly violated his terms of his bail with his ankle bracelet, and so they have put him in jail.
[00:35:14.834 --> 00:35:17.496]  So he wouldn't make stuff about Trump.
[00:35:17.496 --> 00:35:31.867]  The Inspector General report comes out from the Justice Department proving the collusion, the plan to keep Trump from getting into office, and now Manafort
[00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:43.688]  Political lobbyist, consultant, lawyer for President Trump's former campaign chairman, Manafort, has been indicted on money laundering, tax evasion, and obstruction of justice charges.
[00:35:43.688 --> 00:35:46.749]  He's currently incarcerated, awaiting trial.
[00:35:46.749 --> 00:35:49.470]  So they just put it out there like it's no big deal in U.S.
[00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.651]  Shady Day Reuters.
[00:35:51.651 --> 00:35:58.173]  Not saying that the whole case had fallen apart, the judges had said it was a political fraud, and had been striking down stuff Mueller was trying.
[00:35:59.787 --> 00:36:06.712]  Now, they've revoked his bail and thrown him into the who's cow.
[00:36:06.712 --> 00:36:09.515]  Never do that for white collar crime.
[00:36:09.515 --> 00:36:11.496]  And there's nothing even there.
[00:36:11.496 --> 00:36:18.902]  But this is them turning up the heat.
[00:36:18.902 --> 00:36:23.946]  Manafort ordered to jail, bail revoked on witness tampering charge.
[00:36:25.495 --> 00:36:46.663]  So we've got Strzok, and we've got other people, and we've got the Deputy Director of the FBI at the time, McCabe, and the Chief Legal Counselor, James Baker, and Attorney Lisa Page, and the Deputy Director McCabe, and Comey, and all these people together.
[00:36:46.663 --> 00:36:51.245]  We now learn, telling people Congress is about to call you, you're about to get subpoenaed.
[00:36:53.510 --> 00:37:15.740]  So you've got some of these people involved in clear witness tampering, but then Manafort, if he supposedly talks to anybody he ever knew or anybody they might call, they've called hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people, they've grabbed him off airplanes, they've questioned him, then if he ever talks to one of those people, well sorry, that's witness tampering, you're going to prison now.
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.621]  So that's how desperate this fight's gotten.
[00:37:19.887 --> 00:37:22.368]  You have them trying to stop Trump from being elected.
[00:37:22.368 --> 00:37:24.648]  You have them trying to set him up once he's president.
[00:37:24.648 --> 00:37:26.128]  All of it's come up dry.
[00:37:26.128 --> 00:37:28.909]  With a little insurance policy.
[00:37:28.909 --> 00:37:35.690]  And it turns out the insurance policy rolls them all up for massive criminal activity.
[00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:43.972]  The Inspector General's report certifies that they've done this, but still says, oh, it's not criminal.
[00:37:46.491 --> 00:37:53.983]  Well, it's not the final word on the whole insurance policy and the rest of it.
[00:37:53.983 --> 00:37:57.248]  But as you heard the president say, and I want to play that one more time.
[00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:00.991]  He calls Comey scum.
[00:38:00.991 --> 00:38:02.612]  He calls people the top scum.
[00:38:02.612 --> 00:38:05.635]  This Clinton cabal says the real FBI supports him.
[00:38:05.635 --> 00:38:07.276]  Which is true, I would say.
[00:38:07.276 --> 00:38:14.622]  The average FBI agent responds to kidnappings and bank robberies and murders and child molestation and stuff like that.
[00:38:14.622 --> 00:38:15.262]  It is scum.
[00:38:15.262 --> 00:38:20.246]  It's a group of 13 people, including Obama now.
[00:38:20.246 --> 00:38:22.207]  How bombshell is that?
[00:38:22.207 --> 00:38:24.109]  We already knew that, but how bombshell?
[00:38:28.979 --> 00:38:37.662]  That we now haven't confirmed the AG report that he was using a fake name, a pseudonym, an alias.
[00:38:37.662 --> 00:38:40.343]  Remember the head of the EPA had to resign?
[00:38:40.343 --> 00:38:47.545]  Because she had a pseudonym and was using stuff to get around the Freedom of Information Act?
[00:38:47.545 --> 00:38:49.305]  That was way low level compared to this.
[00:38:49.305 --> 00:38:54.467]  This is State Department, top secret stuff across the board.
[00:38:56.195 --> 00:38:56.776]  But why not?
[00:38:56.776 --> 00:39:04.583]  They released an offage of personnel management, 21 million names, everybody that ever worked for the government, connections, spies, assets.
[00:39:04.583 --> 00:39:11.149]  They gave our entire network to the Communist Chinese, who now use it as a database running major U.S.
[00:39:11.149 --> 00:39:19.456]  universities, that's in the Washington Post even, deciding who not to hire, whose former military, who they look up and can tell they're conservative.
[00:39:20.202 --> 00:39:43.967]  If they're Christian, they ever work for the CIA, they ever work for Defense Intelligence, they ever work for any other agencies or groups, you don't get a job in the military-industrial complex at the university level because it's totally penetrated by the shycoms and they actually put their name through to the liaison board that the Chinese government funds at every major state school.
[00:39:43.967 --> 00:39:45.687]  They basically have taken UT over.
[00:39:47.065 --> 00:39:51.548]  I know for a fact that they know, so I'll say this.
[00:39:51.548 --> 00:40:14.481]  Patriots in our government have sent people in with super top secret backgrounds to watch them be refused when they're way overqualified to be able to do a data test and track the people at UT that are sending the information out
[00:40:18.114 --> 00:40:21.978]  Through three levels of Chinese Communist control.
[00:40:21.978 --> 00:40:27.264]  And then it's sent back to Chinese Army Intelligence.
[00:40:27.264 --> 00:40:30.829]  Is in control of the University of Texas.
[00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:31.629]  I mean, whoa!
[00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:32.210]  Whoa!
[00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.732]  They've got 21 million files.
[00:40:44.871 --> 00:40:54.279]  21 million files on everybody.
[00:40:54.279 --> 00:41:03.247]  The only thing not in those files is stuff that is ultra secret.
[00:41:03.247 --> 00:41:07.350]  They've got 99.9% of everything.
[00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:11.053]  And now they've got the Apple cloud codes to everybody.
[00:41:14.079 --> 00:41:15.980]  Total penetration!
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:21.001]  And Trump is there, and they're freaking out because they're fighting like the wheel of a ship.
[00:41:21.001 --> 00:41:28.544]  Trump's the captain, and the CHICOMS are going, you got this wheel!
[00:41:28.544 --> 00:41:39.208]  The allegory would be that scene in The Running Man, short story by
[00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:53.856]  The great pop sci-fi horror writer Stephen King and the Schwarzenegger character Ben Richards has got the chainsaw.
[00:41:53.856 --> 00:41:58.339]  And Buzzsaw's the guy that goes, I'm gonna cut you in half, the saw's part of me, and now I'm gonna make it part of you.
[00:41:58.339 --> 00:42:00.640]  And right now we got the chainsaw, the Communist China.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.482]  They're going, we're getting you, America, you're done!
[00:42:03.482 --> 00:42:03.922]  We gotta go, no!
[00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:08.611]  You like that?
[00:42:08.611 --> 00:42:10.412]  Everybody should be behind Trump!
[00:42:10.412 --> 00:42:11.192]  All you fools!
[00:42:11.192 --> 00:42:11.953]  All you leftists!
[00:42:11.953 --> 00:42:13.213]  All you chump idiots!
[00:42:13.213 --> 00:42:14.534]  Hollywood's collapsing!
[00:42:14.534 --> 00:42:17.095]  The globalists are evil!
[00:42:17.095 --> 00:42:20.737]  And your best bet at Davos and everything is China?
[00:42:20.737 --> 00:42:24.558]  And Obama gave them all the codes, the universities, everything?
[00:42:24.558 --> 00:42:27.099]  They got the Panama Canal, all the ports, all the minerals.
[00:42:27.099 --> 00:42:28.340]  We've been totally sold out.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.041]  I cloud keys.
[00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:32.882]  Silicon Valley bet on the wrong horse.
[00:42:34.059 --> 00:42:37.382]  We're winning, no matter what.

[00:47:09.946 --> 00:47:17.030]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that is really, really an awful situation.
[00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:19.271]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:47:19.271 --> 00:47:20.611]  We love the American people.
[00:47:31.838 --> 00:47:34.060]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.561]  We love the American people.
[00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:38.944]  We love the American people.
[00:47:38.944 --> 00:47:40.305]  We love the American people.
[00:47:40.305 --> 00:47:55.256]  They came in peace.
[00:47:55.256 --> 00:47:57.398]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:47:57.398 --> 00:47:58.999]  We love the American people.
[00:48:06.633 --> 00:48:11.876]  This is CNN.
[00:48:11.876 --> 00:48:23.683]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:48:23.683 --> 00:48:30.607]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:32.488]  You better believe you've got war!
[00:48:34.898 --> 00:48:49.670]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:51.192]  Ramming speed!
[00:48:51.192 --> 00:48:52.373]  They're not giving us quarter?
[00:48:52.373 --> 00:48:54.254]  We're not giving them any quarter.
[00:48:54.254 --> 00:48:55.155]  Run them down.
[00:48:55.155 --> 00:48:58.798]  Turn the dogs loose.
[00:48:58.798 --> 00:48:59.999]  Kill them all politically.
[00:49:03.092 --> 00:49:04.773]  They want a fight?
[00:49:04.773 --> 00:49:09.496]  They better believe they've got one.
[00:49:09.496 --> 00:49:12.117]  Their whole criminal network's being imploded.
[00:49:12.117 --> 00:49:24.824]  The Communist Chinese were our own globalist controllers for 50 years, transferred our technology, our money, our science, the ports, the infrastructure, to put them in the key position for global economic takeover.
[00:49:24.824 --> 00:49:31.088]  Allied with radical Islam, allied with the globalist Pope, allied with Hollywood, allied with the big multinationals.
[00:49:33.456 --> 00:49:36.539]  But they're authoritarian and they're criminal.
[00:49:36.539 --> 00:49:39.862]  And their own people hate them in China.
[00:49:39.862 --> 00:49:50.752]  But I knew Trump was turning things around three months ago when thousands of publications had to admit the truth that UT was run by Chinese intelligence.
[00:49:50.752 --> 00:49:53.234]  And that they'd penetrated the hiring and firing process.
[00:49:53.234 --> 00:49:55.176]  You understand how important that is?
[00:49:55.176 --> 00:49:58.079]  Then they can put their people in and have their agents apply.
[00:50:03.646 --> 00:50:15.310]  The Chinese Communist infiltration of America is 10,000 times bigger than the Russian.
[00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:24.993]  The Russians just always try to get resources or better deals, and it's just pure, you want stock in a company, you want to be put on a Russian board, or you want to have sex with these women.
[00:50:24.993 --> 00:50:27.034]  I mean, it is completely direct.
[00:50:27.034 --> 00:50:30.315]  It's not how the Chinese work.
[00:50:32.947 --> 00:50:36.869]  They come in and they take control of your universities, and your companies, and your corporations.
[00:50:36.869 --> 00:50:39.290]  They already have Hollywood.
[00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:41.471]  God help us.
[00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:48.374]  We're totally overrun.
[00:50:48.374 --> 00:50:50.895]  And now, we know the score.
[00:50:50.895 --> 00:50:52.716]  Now, we knew.
[00:50:52.716 --> 00:51:01.359]  I mean, even the Wall Street Journal like two weeks ago said, China is spanking Hollywood.
[00:51:01.359 --> 00:51:02.200]  Like it was a good thing.
[00:51:03.857 --> 00:51:10.261]  Hollywood faces Chinese censorship here in America.
[00:51:10.261 --> 00:51:14.284]  The new Star Wars movies, if you haven't studied Chinese China, you don't see it.
[00:51:14.284 --> 00:51:16.125]  The uniforms, the emblems.
[00:51:22.148 --> 00:51:30.933]  The bombers blowing up the dreadnought in the one before the last Star Wars came out are wearing communist Chinese uniforms and they're Chinese.
[00:51:30.933 --> 00:51:34.935]  You got Chinese flying X-wings blowing stuff up.
[00:51:34.935 --> 00:51:38.157]  Chinese communist uniforms.
[00:51:38.157 --> 00:51:39.898]  Talk about propaganda.
[00:51:39.898 --> 00:51:41.539]  Folks, we're far gone.
[00:51:41.539 --> 00:51:43.000]  We're far gone.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.862]  We're a laughing stock.
[00:51:46.862 --> 00:51:47.863]  And then Trump comes in.
[00:51:49.218 --> 00:51:54.161]  And says, no, we're not gonna have 290% tariffs on us.
[00:51:54.161 --> 00:51:56.243]  And then we have nothing on you.
[00:51:56.243 --> 00:51:57.904]  No.
[00:51:57.904 --> 00:51:59.825]  And they go, you're insane, you're evil.
[00:51:59.825 --> 00:52:02.507]  No, we've been insane letting this go on.
[00:52:02.507 --> 00:52:07.971]  Well, you think China came from nowhere and just out-competed us?
[00:52:07.971 --> 00:52:10.593]  So China is hitting them hard.
[00:52:10.593 --> 00:52:13.895]  And we're hitting back.
[00:52:13.895 --> 00:52:17.518]  Now that said, Obama has been caught with a code name.
[00:52:18.712 --> 00:52:21.314]  It's in the Inspector General Report.
[00:52:21.314 --> 00:52:24.997]  Page 89.
[00:52:24.997 --> 00:52:27.479]  Exhibit 75.
[00:52:27.479 --> 00:52:30.621]  There it is on screen.
[00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:39.988]  The mega flame-throwing thermonuclear bombshell that he lied to Congress through his surrogates.
[00:52:39.988 --> 00:52:40.529]  He lied to everybody.
[00:52:40.529 --> 00:52:41.690]  He said he had nothing to do with the server.
[00:52:43.288 --> 00:52:47.691]  And now it's all classified info that they were trading back and forth and trading with foreign powers.
[00:52:47.691 --> 00:52:54.577]  And it's also in the report that more than 20 foreign governments were in the server.
[00:52:54.577 --> 00:53:03.603]  And then Hillary then got donations from their companies in the tune of $3 billion at her foundation.
[00:53:03.603 --> 00:53:04.944]  You want something?
[00:53:04.944 --> 00:53:05.825]  You give me money.
[00:53:05.825 --> 00:53:07.607]  And that's even in her emails, the ones we've got.
[00:53:07.607 --> 00:53:09.168]  God, imagine the 30-something thousand we don't.
[00:53:10.799 --> 00:53:13.160]  You know every other government has it, it's not the people.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.560]  You know our government has it too.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:22.882]  They're sitting there, here, give me money, and I'll put what you want on that server.
[00:53:22.882 --> 00:53:26.383]  Of course all the foreign donors are pulling out now because she didn't run the State Department.
[00:53:26.383 --> 00:53:27.963]  She was supposed to be the President!
[00:53:27.963 --> 00:53:30.004]  She was supposed to do whatever she wanted!
[00:53:30.004 --> 00:53:32.704]  Think about her!
[00:53:32.704 --> 00:53:35.825]  And think about how the Communist Chinese, man, they think they're great.
[00:53:35.825 --> 00:53:38.246]  Wow, you gave us your entire worldwide network.
[00:53:39.161 --> 00:53:41.323]  You talk about a saboteur.
[00:53:41.323 --> 00:53:43.164]  But people think that's hard to believe that happens.
[00:53:43.164 --> 00:53:44.386]  Look at other governments.
[00:53:44.386 --> 00:53:47.148]  Look at other things in history.
[00:53:47.148 --> 00:53:52.833]  Look at how we had Benedict Arnold, one of our top generals, then turned against us at the end.
[00:53:52.833 --> 00:53:55.315]  People sell out in war.
[00:53:55.315 --> 00:53:57.837]  Because they get masses of money for it.
[00:53:57.837 --> 00:54:00.099]  Especially when they think they're selling out to the winner.
[00:54:00.099 --> 00:54:02.601]  That's what the CFR in Hollywood, everybody tells you.
[00:54:02.601 --> 00:54:04.143]  It's the Chinese century.
[00:54:04.143 --> 00:54:05.484]  America's done.
[00:54:05.484 --> 00:54:06.785]  Crawl in a hole and die.
[00:54:10.333 --> 00:54:24.562]  Well here's Obama denying that he was ever involved and used any fake names or involved those emails of those servers and he's now been caught red-handed lying to everyone and engaged in criminal treason.
[00:54:24.562 --> 00:54:27.965]  As the president this is high treason.
[00:54:27.965 --> 00:54:33.108]  Sworn an oath to be the defender of the Republic and he was there to bring it down with that monster Hillary.
[00:54:36.459 --> 00:54:38.060]  You wonder why they're hiring all these America haters?
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.462]  You wonder why the schools teach hating America?
[00:54:40.462 --> 00:54:52.752]  They're creating the operatives to plug into Davos, and to plug into the Chai Koms, and to plug into the Vatican, and to plug in to the Islamicists, and to take this country down!
[00:54:52.752 --> 00:54:55.314]  Here is the flashback of Obama Line.
[00:54:56.072 --> 00:55:00.394]  President Obama speaking out on 60 Minutes about Hillary Clinton's email controversy.
[00:55:00.394 --> 00:55:04.096]  Did you know about Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server?
[00:55:04.096 --> 00:55:04.396]  No.
[00:55:04.396 --> 00:55:05.777]  While she was Secretary of State?
[00:55:05.777 --> 00:55:06.297]  No.
[00:55:06.297 --> 00:55:13.381]  Saying while it's been, in his words, ginned up for political gain, his former Secretary of State should have held herself to a higher standard.
[00:55:13.381 --> 00:55:19.884]  It is important for her to answer these questions to the satisfaction of the American public and they can make their own judgment.
[00:55:19.884 --> 00:55:25.567]  I can tell you that this is not a situation in which America's national security was endangered.
[00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:31.415]  Says the top globalist agent that blew, almost killed the country.
[00:55:31.415 --> 00:55:33.177]  We still may not make it.
[00:55:33.177 --> 00:55:35.120]  Just blew our entire network.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.746]  The only thing worse is Apple being now Chinese government run.
[00:55:39.746 --> 00:55:44.172]  I mean, it's now they're into everything.
[00:55:44.172 --> 00:55:45.494]  God knows what we don't know about.
[00:55:46.405 --> 00:55:47.526]  Only God knows.
[00:55:47.526 --> 00:55:54.329]  Here is, it's again also in the report, we just covered that earlier, that foreign governments were in her servers.
[00:55:54.329 --> 00:55:59.311]  Here is InfoWars in January of 2016, the first to ask Hillary about it.
[00:55:59.311 --> 00:56:01.552]  We learned about it from Colonel Schaefer and other patriots.
[00:56:01.552 --> 00:56:01.832]  Here it is.
[00:56:03.127 --> 00:56:10.753]  Last week it was reported on Infowars.com that your email server was hacked and you knowingly continued to use your email server.
[00:56:10.753 --> 00:56:11.754]  Can you comment on that?
[00:56:11.754 --> 00:56:13.335]  Yeah, it's totally untrue.
[00:56:13.335 --> 00:56:15.297]  Lying, lying, lying as usual.
[00:56:15.297 --> 00:56:15.477]  Okay.
[00:56:21.752 --> 00:56:22.653]  That's it for this segment.
[00:56:22.653 --> 00:56:24.475]  I have a very important announcement to make.
[00:56:24.475 --> 00:56:32.804]  Not just that we have Tommy Robinson's spokesperson coming on, now mainstream media confirms he's in a Muslim wing of a maximum security prison, transferred there to be basically killed.
[00:56:32.804 --> 00:56:34.345]  That's now news.
[00:56:34.345 --> 00:56:39.551]  We reported it Tuesday first and people tried to say it wasn't true, but now it's topdrugreport.com, yesterday and today.
[00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:41.829]  So, there it is.
[00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:45.471]  FBI agent Pierce Trunk said foreign actors access Hillary Clinton's emails.
[00:56:45.471 --> 00:56:48.211]  That's now all been confirmed as well.
[00:56:48.211 --> 00:56:48.832]  So there you go.
[00:56:48.832 --> 00:56:52.993]  You just heard Richard Reeves giving you that news a year and a half ago.
[00:56:52.993 --> 00:57:01.856]  That said, we're supposed to be doing this 34-hour broadcast that we're now got like six, eight hours left in to raise money to fund the operation and expand the face of the globalist.
[00:57:03.032 --> 00:57:05.535]  I haven't even done any plugging.
[00:57:05.535 --> 00:57:10.542]  We have launched AlexJonesLegalFund.com and AlexJonesDefenseFund.com.
[00:57:10.542 --> 00:57:12.765]  We have a link to Roger Stone on the side as well.
[00:57:12.765 --> 00:57:17.331]  For people that want to make just pure, straight donations so that we can...
[00:57:18.112 --> 00:57:21.455]  Defeat all these frivolous Soros and Hillary funded suits.
[00:57:21.455 --> 00:57:24.818]  We've already gotten most of them thrown out, but the big ones are here.
[00:57:24.818 --> 00:57:28.541]  We're going to win, thanks to the grace of God, but pure donations are needed.
[00:57:28.541 --> 00:57:34.267]  If you'd like to go to m4warrestore.com and fund the Second American Revolution and put your money where it has the massive bang.
[00:57:35.575 --> 00:57:37.117]  And the dreaded InfoWars?

[00:57:41.744 --> 00:57:43.066]  Please take action.

[00:57:51.408 --> 00:57:58.036]  This is the last week to get free shipping on all of our best selling items at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:58.036 --> 00:58:06.886]  We also have some of the biggest sales in our history on super high quality supplements and other products at InfoWarsStore.com as well as InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:58:07.967 --> 00:58:16.929]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula has the strongest curcumin level of any other brand you're going to find out there at 95%.
[00:58:16.929 --> 00:58:21.370]  Leading competitors have a curcumin level of 3%.

[00:58:30.972 --> 00:58:33.253]  It is critical that you go to infowarstore.com.
[00:58:34.133 --> 00:58:41.955]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:41.955 --> 00:58:42.215]  It's you!
[00:58:59.693 --> 00:59:01.874]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:59:01.874 --> 00:59:10.618]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:59:10.618 --> 00:59:15.180]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:16.621]  You are the info war.
[00:59:16.621 --> 00:59:20.143]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:32.209]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:32.209 --> 00:59:40.192]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:40.192 --> 00:59:47.236]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:47.236 --> 00:59:49.977]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[00:59:53.253 --> 00:59:55.861]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.182 --> 01:00:20.667]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:00:20.667 --> 01:00:25.010]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:29.212]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:00:29.212 --> 01:00:33.155]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.155 --> 01:00:41.800]  This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually
[01:00:43.575 --> 01:00:43.675]  Okay.
[01:00:56.869 --> 01:00:59.771]  With the benefit of hindsight, we're not the best choices.
[01:00:59.771 --> 01:01:03.374]  The long-awaited Inspector General's report has been released.
[01:01:03.374 --> 01:01:25.991]  Inspector General Michael Horowitz paints a picture of former FBI Director James Comey as a loose cannon, who deviated from Bureau and Justice Department procedures while fumbling the Hillary Clinton email investigation, also claiming the Democratic Trump despising Comey was not motivated by political bias.
[01:01:26.651 --> 01:01:30.693]  Is Donald Trump unfit to be president?
[01:01:30.693 --> 01:01:34.054]  Yes, but not in the way I often hear people talk about it.
[01:01:34.054 --> 01:01:39.095]  I don't buy the stuff about him being mentally incompetent or early stages of dementia.
[01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:44.557]  He strikes me as a person of above-average intelligence who's tracking conversations and knows what's going on.
[01:01:44.557 --> 01:01:47.078]  I don't think he's medically unfit to be president.
[01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.739]  I think he's morally unfit to be president.
[01:01:49.439 --> 01:02:14.586]  Inspector General Michael Horowitz concludes, while we did not find that these decisions were the result of political bias on Comey's part, we nevertheless concluded that by departing so clearly and dramatically from FBI and department norms, the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice.
[01:02:15.026 --> 01:02:16.807]  There's very little in here that we didn't know.
[01:02:16.807 --> 01:02:20.089]  Well, there are some emails and there are some texts we hadn't seen.
[01:02:20.089 --> 01:02:36.280]  But in terms of the errors of judgment of Jim Comey, not of Bob Mueller, of Jim Comey, in terms of the mountain of evidence that's sufficient to charge and convict Mrs. Clinton, in terms of the impropriety of Attorney General Lynch's meeting with Bill Clinton, there's nothing new.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.561]  It astounds me.
[01:02:38.141 --> 01:02:42.647]  That there is no recommendation for the indictment of Hillary Clinton.
[01:02:42.647 --> 01:02:53.122]  As wrong as the judgment was of Jim Comey, as critical as many of us have been of his decision to exonerate her, that judgment is not permanent and can be reversed.
[01:02:53.122 --> 01:02:54.624]  And there's no recommendation that it be done.
[01:02:54.684 --> 01:03:04.733]  The IG report also outlines how Comey used his own Gmail account to handle FBI reports, even after being warned against it.
[01:03:04.733 --> 01:03:17.745]  Question is, if James Comey wasn't motivated by political bias, how do you explain the environment of the FBI agent's political bias surrounding the former FBI director?
[01:03:17.745 --> 01:03:19.907]  At the very least, I know they aren't Russians, but
[01:03:20.247 --> 01:03:27.813]  And although the law required no reason at all to fire an FBI director, the administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI.
[01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:53.688]  By saying that the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader.
[01:03:53.688 --> 01:03:55.669]  Those were lies, plain and simple.
[01:03:55.669 --> 01:03:59.169]  First, I want the American people to know this truth.
[01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:01.330]  The FBI is honest.
[01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:03.390]  The FBI is strong.
[01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:07.911]  And the FBI is and always will be independent.
[01:04:07.911 --> 01:04:10.872]  John Bowne reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.510]  Ladies and gentlemen, when we return, we're gonna go into the...
[01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:31.677]  Different angles of this incredible IG report.
[01:04:31.677 --> 01:04:36.182]  Incredible how they whitewash in their comments about it, but incredible what it actually contains.
[01:04:36.182 --> 01:04:39.985]  The proof of amazing, coordinated criminal activity.
[01:04:39.985 --> 01:04:41.967]  We're breaking it all down straight ahead.
[01:04:41.967 --> 01:04:42.808]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:42.808 --> 01:04:47.653]  This is the tail end of the historic 34-hour Fall of the Deep State Global Transmission.
[01:04:47.653 --> 01:04:52.117]  However you're watching or listening, please tell everybody to listen and share those live video and audio links.
[01:04:52.117 --> 01:04:53.619]  It's critical to the rebellion.
[01:04:58.206 --> 01:05:18.178]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.178 --> 01:05:20.300]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:24.302]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:24.302 --> 01:05:25.323]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[01:05:25.743 --> 01:05:31.527]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:33.929]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:33.929 --> 01:05:36.570]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:37.511]  That's my dad.
[01:05:37.511 --> 01:05:39.372]  The colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.372 --> 01:05:41.874]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:41.874 --> 01:05:51.060]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:55.503]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:05:58.471 --> 01:06:00.576]  We are drugged out!
[01:06:00.576 --> 01:06:02.883]  We are following other people's opinions!
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.802]  We are controlled by the media.
[01:06:06.802 --> 01:06:08.663]  Today, it all changes.
[01:06:08.663 --> 01:06:11.425]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[01:06:11.425 --> 01:06:14.507]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[01:06:14.507 --> 01:06:19.251]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[01:06:19.251 --> 01:06:22.373]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[01:06:22.373 --> 01:06:24.754]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[01:06:24.754 --> 01:06:27.176]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:06:27.176 --> 01:06:28.817]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:06:28.817 --> 01:06:29.838]  We have the resources.
[01:06:32.709 --> 01:06:36.811]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherf***ers to change something.
[01:06:36.811 --> 01:06:38.351]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[01:06:38.351 --> 01:06:39.972]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[01:06:39.972 --> 01:06:41.052]  They say Trump's crazy.
[01:06:41.052 --> 01:06:42.133]  They say I'm crazy.
[01:06:42.133 --> 01:06:44.514]  But I'm here to show love.
[01:06:44.514 --> 01:06:49.576]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[01:06:49.576 --> 01:06:53.797]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:06:53.797 --> 01:06:55.558]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:04.036 --> 01:07:15.566]  On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake.
[01:07:15.566 --> 01:07:20.510]  His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
[01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:22.071]  Oh well, she cried.
[01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:25.814]  I'll take you in, and I'll take care of you.
[01:07:25.814 --> 01:07:27.856]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:07:27.856 --> 01:07:29.777]  Take me in, for heaven's sake.
[01:07:29.777 --> 01:07:32.399]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:07:32.399 --> 01:07:32.900]  Sighed.
[01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:39.214]  The Vicious Snake.
[01:07:39.214 --> 01:07:42.097]  This could be the great Trojan horse of all time.
[01:07:42.097 --> 01:07:45.660]  Because you look at the migration, study it, look at it.
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.922]  Now they'll start infiltrating with women and children.
[01:07:48.922 --> 01:07:51.444]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:07:51.444 --> 01:07:53.746]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:07:53.746 --> 01:07:55.228]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:07:56.369 --> 01:08:00.173]  Sighed the vicious snake.
[01:08:00.173 --> 01:08:03.136]  Now she clutched him to her bosom.
[01:08:03.136 --> 01:08:05.779]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[01:08:05.779 --> 01:08:10.044]  But if I hadn't brought you in, by now you might have died.
[01:08:11.145 --> 01:08:17.254]  She stroked his pretty skin, and then she kissed and held him tight.
[01:08:17.254 --> 01:08:25.184]  But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:26.766]  I saved you, cried the woman.
[01:08:27.828 --> 01:08:31.450]  And you've bit me, heavens why?
[01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:36.954]  You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.
[01:08:36.954 --> 01:08:41.897]  Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[01:08:41.897 --> 01:08:47.100]  You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
[01:08:55.871 --> 01:08:59.614]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[01:08:59.614 --> 01:09:00.834]  There's a guy named Alex Jones.
[01:09:00.834 --> 01:09:01.755]  Alex Jones.
[01:09:01.755 --> 01:09:02.856]  From Infowars.
[01:09:02.856 --> 01:09:03.436]  Infowars.
[01:09:03.436 --> 01:09:03.776]  Yeah.
[01:09:03.776 --> 01:09:04.537]  Alex Jones.
[01:09:04.537 --> 01:09:05.457]  Alex Jones.
[01:09:05.457 --> 01:09:08.840]  One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.722]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[01:09:11.722 --> 01:09:16.645]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:09:16.645 --> 01:09:21.248]  The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[01:09:21.428 --> 01:09:23.649]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[01:09:23.649 --> 01:09:26.871]  I'm already not Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:37.896]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story that's according to website InfoWars.
[01:09:37.896 --> 01:09:40.157]  And this really, this is so disgusting.
[01:09:40.157 --> 01:09:42.698]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[01:09:46.337 --> 01:09:49.078]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[01:09:49.078 --> 01:09:52.220]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:58.402]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[01:09:58.402 --> 01:10:00.603]  If Trump gets elected, he's gonna be Secretary of Defense.
[01:10:00.603 --> 01:10:02.524]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[01:10:02.524 --> 01:10:03.965]  Move, bitch!
[01:10:03.965 --> 01:10:05.125]  Get out the way!
[01:10:05.125 --> 01:10:07.486]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, Infowars.com.
[01:10:07.486 --> 01:10:09.387]  Bill Clinton's a rapist!
[01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:11.533]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[01:10:11.533 --> 01:10:12.596]  InfoWars.com.
[01:10:12.596 --> 01:10:13.679]  InfoWars.com.
[01:10:13.679 --> 01:10:14.723]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[01:10:14.723 --> 01:10:16.809]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[01:10:20.387 --> 01:10:24.890]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:26.931]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:43.681]  In November of 2017, an ailing Senator John McCain said that he and Democrat Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed were working on a proposal to update the broad war powers Congress gave the Commander-in-Chief after the 9-11 terrorist attacks.
[01:10:44.381 --> 01:10:50.525]  Fast forward to the Senate debate on the 2019 NDAA raising questions on the Hill.
[01:10:50.525 --> 01:10:57.669]  Corker Cain authorizes war against at least eight groups that are known to operate all together in over 20 countries.
[01:10:57.669 --> 01:11:00.251]  Hardly sounds like we'll have any less war, Corker Cain.
[01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:15.048]  Look, if the Congress decides to withdraw funds for some military excursion, the President will veto the act of withdrawal and then it will require a two-thirds vote of both houses to overcome that.
[01:11:15.048 --> 01:11:24.335]  So a President with one-third plus one in either house can wage war on any target at any time the President chooses to do so.
[01:11:24.335 --> 01:11:25.796]  That is so contrary to what
[01:11:25.896 --> 01:11:27.657]  Madison intended.
[01:11:27.657 --> 01:11:41.748]  So contrary to the plain meaning of the Constitution, so violative of the separation of powers, has to be a rejection of the oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.
[01:11:41.748 --> 01:11:44.290]  And none of you wants to reject that oath.
[01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:58.462]  We find ourselves at this ignoble moment, not by accident, but by decades of concerted effort by members of this institution to evade the responsibilities given to them by the framers of our Constitution.
[01:11:59.534 --> 01:12:06.158]  So this body has failed historically to require a declaration.
[01:12:06.158 --> 01:12:08.600]  So they got rid of the declarations.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:16.085]  And then they failed and got rid of the need to specify as the nations were going to go at war against.
[01:12:16.085 --> 01:12:22.489]  And now they're about to get rid of even the requirement to get any type of prior authorization.
[01:12:22.489 --> 01:12:26.351]  It'll make this body a pedestrian to war.
[01:12:26.351 --> 01:12:28.513]  And it will put war making on autopilot.
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:33.841]  And this law does not even have a sunset provision.
[01:12:33.841 --> 01:12:35.601]  It just goes on.
[01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:39.382]  You adopt this proposal, we'll have 170 more.
[01:12:39.382 --> 01:12:42.803]  Because this has virtually no standards.
[01:12:42.803 --> 01:12:47.684]  It will effectively revise the Constitution of the United States without an amendment.
[01:12:47.684 --> 01:12:55.726]  The top priority for this Senate must be to ensure that SJRES 59, the Corker-Kane-AUMF, does not become law.
[01:12:55.726 --> 01:12:57.066]  The damage would be colossal.
[01:12:57.646 --> 01:13:14.242]  Not only would it almost irretrievably cede to the executive branch the most fundamental power that Congress has under Article 1 of the Constitution, the power to declare war, but it also would give the current president and all future presidents authority from Congress to engage in worldwide war.
[01:13:15.203 --> 01:13:22.948]  The Corker-Kane AUMF would authorize force without operational limitations against eight groups in six countries.
[01:13:22.948 --> 01:13:29.953]  The President could then add to both lists as long as the President reports the expansion to Congress.
[01:13:29.953 --> 01:13:39.040]  To be clear, the President would have unilateral authority to add additional countries, including the United States itself, to the list of countries where Congress is authorizing war.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:49.387]  A key bipartisan issue to watch is Turkey making its way off the back burner of tyranny where the 2019 NDAA relevance is concerned.
[01:13:49.387 --> 01:13:54.111]  The adversary in North Korea released three prisoners.
[01:13:54.111 --> 01:13:57.453]  We've seen Venezuela release a prisoner.
[01:13:57.453 --> 01:14:07.060]  But in Turkey, since October of 2016, we've seen them hold a man for over a year and a half, or almost a year and a half, without charges.
[01:14:07.981 --> 01:14:16.126]  And then I saw a man go before a court and a witness for a whole day being subjected to some of the most absurd charges possible.
[01:14:16.126 --> 01:14:22.671]  If that's the behavior of a NATO ally, is that really where we should be putting in our supply chains
[01:14:23.511 --> 01:14:29.733]  And in our defensive systems, one of the most sophisticated weapons, one of the most important weapons in our arsenal.
[01:14:29.733 --> 01:14:39.977]  The Washington Examiner reports, Senators will now be filing proposed amendments and gearing up for debate and voting that could stretch into next week.
[01:14:39.977 --> 01:14:44.158]  The House passed its version of the NDAA on May 24th.
[01:14:44.158 --> 01:14:45.519]  Once the Senate votes,
[01:14:45.879 --> 01:14:54.245]  Both chambers armed services committees typically name a conference committee to hammer out a final compromise in the fall.
[01:14:54.245 --> 01:14:57.167]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:57.223]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.

[01:17:26.733 --> 01:17:30.615]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.081]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:11.249 --> 01:20:15.913]  If you want to know why they hate Infowars and why they hate Roger Stone and Trump, it's because we're winners.
[01:20:15.913 --> 01:20:20.418]  And we're all being validated with the AG report, the IG report.
[01:20:20.418 --> 01:20:33.830]  We're going to break down in just a moment, but let's go back to a year and a half ago on the night of November 8th and their horror, their panic, their belly aching, their collapse into the Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:20:35.815 --> 01:20:41.363]  Some of my colleagues at Trump Tower just a few minutes ago, there's a little optimism here.
[01:20:41.363 --> 01:20:43.706]  No one thought it was going to be this close at this point.
[01:20:43.706 --> 01:20:44.828]  Trump can still win this thing.
[01:20:44.828 --> 01:20:47.111]  Another state to project it is the state of North Carolina.
[01:20:47.111 --> 01:20:48.313]  Big battleground state.
[01:20:48.313 --> 01:20:49.174]  It's going to Donald Trump.
[01:20:49.174 --> 01:20:50.616]  I was actually ready to go to bed.
[01:20:52.538 --> 01:20:58.902]  This is going to be a very close election.
[01:20:58.902 --> 01:21:01.404]  I'm seeing these late-breaking trends.
[01:21:01.404 --> 01:21:03.665]  This could hand-trump the presidency, folks.
[01:21:03.665 --> 01:21:05.987]  This is not by any means over.
[01:21:05.987 --> 01:21:10.590]  I think there's some real jitters setting in in Clinton headquarters right now.
[01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:17.035]  Wolf, the scene here is so different than it was a few hours ago when people were happy and relaxed.
[01:21:17.035 --> 01:21:18.656]  This is most unexpected.
[01:21:19.136 --> 01:21:23.217]  Certainly is a huge, huge surprise to so many people out there.
[01:21:23.217 --> 01:21:25.897]  I think we all thought it couldn't happen.
[01:21:25.897 --> 01:21:27.898]  That he couldn't do what he did.
[01:21:27.898 --> 01:21:29.038]  And guess what?
[01:21:29.038 --> 01:21:30.898]  He may just do it.
[01:21:30.898 --> 01:21:32.359]  Donald Trump has taken the lead.
[01:21:32.359 --> 01:21:33.319]  He has 216 electoral votes.
[01:21:33.319 --> 01:21:36.940]  This is truly the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.700]  He is pulling ahead of Hillary Clinton.
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:40.120]  You see it right there.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:44.301]  The number of groups who are likely feeling real fear right now.
[01:21:44.301 --> 01:21:48.142]  You've got women immigrants who have been threatened by Donald Trump with deportation.
[01:21:48.342 --> 01:21:50.502]  How do I explain this to my children?
[01:21:50.502 --> 01:21:55.783]  I have Muslim friends who are texting me tonight saying, should I leave the country?
[01:21:55.783 --> 01:21:57.564]  America is crying tonight.
[01:21:57.564 --> 01:22:01.365]  I'm not sure how much of America, but a very, very significant portion.
[01:22:01.365 --> 01:22:04.265]  And I mean, literally crying.
[01:22:04.265 --> 01:22:08.306]  Hillary, this is an unexpected turn.
[01:22:08.306 --> 01:22:12.707]  And now the President is now President-elect.
[01:22:15.077 --> 01:22:16.398]  People have talked about a miracle.
[01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:17.999]  I'm hearing about a nightmare.
[01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:19.140]  This is your life now.
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:19.680]  This is us.
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.062]  This is our country.
[01:22:40.993 --> 01:22:43.574]  And that's why they're mad, that's why they're upset.
[01:22:43.574 --> 01:22:54.621]  You know, mainstream media hypes things that don't exist, like Trump feeding the fish wrong, or Trump shouldn't have saluted the North Korean military officer, even though the etiquette says if you're on friendly terms you do that.
[01:22:54.621 --> 01:22:57.922]  He's trying to butter them up to free their people.
[01:22:57.922 --> 01:23:03.806]  They do this stuff constantly, but then meanwhile you've got the Inspector General report,
[01:23:04.953 --> 01:23:13.539]  And they kind of softened the iron fist with the velvet glove, but in the contents of it, it's incredible.
[01:23:13.539 --> 01:23:19.703]  Obama was one of 13 people inside the illegal server using an alias.
[01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:23.085]  Obama used an alias inside the criminal server.
[01:23:23.085 --> 01:23:25.187]  It's a drop box to foreign governments.
[01:23:25.187 --> 01:23:26.768]  Lied about it.
[01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:27.548]  Lied about it.
[01:23:27.548 --> 01:23:31.071]  Said he had no idea she was using a private server, so he lied about it.
[01:23:32.386 --> 01:23:35.709]  Look, this thing... Isn't this the biggest thing to come out yet?
[01:23:35.709 --> 01:23:40.692]  I mean, of course they're also saying, we will stop him, he'll never get in, it's our intention to frame him.
[01:23:40.692 --> 01:23:42.834]  I mean, we have them!
[01:23:42.834 --> 01:23:50.159]  But they, see, they attempt to explain it all the way by saying, well, those people, the people who said those things, they weren't in decision-making roles.
[01:23:50.159 --> 01:23:54.142]  Wait a minute, wasn't Peter Strzok the one who questioned General Flynn?
[01:23:54.142 --> 01:23:56.203]  Who caught him on his alleged lie?
[01:23:56.203 --> 01:23:58.325]  He's the guy that covered up
[01:23:59.025 --> 01:24:00.686]  He was a special agent of corruption.
[01:24:00.686 --> 01:24:15.795]  That's why he was such a wonder kid, this, you know, this super mention, because he's running around covering up the Hillary investigations, giving her letters saying it isn't a real investigation, this is going to be a fake interview, while he's busy trying to set up the Patriots.
[01:24:15.795 --> 01:24:22.719]  At the same time, that performance by the FBI director yesterday was one of the most phony, outrageous,
[01:24:23.755 --> 01:24:24.975]  Cover-ups I've ever seen.
[01:24:24.975 --> 01:24:29.936]  It did come off like he had had about four or five of his teeth pulled without anesthesia.
[01:24:29.936 --> 01:24:34.557]  Well, first of all, he keeps giving lip service to congressional oversight.
[01:24:34.557 --> 01:24:36.818]  But, in fact, they've been thwarting oversight.
[01:24:36.818 --> 01:24:44.179]  As Devin Nunes said last night, some of the things that he just saw in the IG report are things he's been asking for for months and he's been stonewalled.
[01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:45.860]  All right, I'm going to stop you right there.
[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:49.980]  Because I've done an hour and 24 minutes of broadcast and I've done one minute of plugging.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:51.001]  This is supposedly a 34-hour fundraising.
[01:24:53.163 --> 01:24:58.185]  This, from my mouth to yours, is the intel.
[01:24:58.185 --> 01:24:59.485]  And it's a fact.
[01:24:59.485 --> 01:25:11.148]  If you don't donate to Roger Stone and buy hundreds of thousands of his books, he only makes a few dollars off each one, they will successfully bankrupt him.
[01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:14.189]  But he's been a key advisor to Trump and somebody we need on the team.
[01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:16.530]  Take InfoWars.
[01:25:16.530 --> 01:25:18.031]  We're having a 34-hour broadcast.
[01:25:18.031 --> 01:25:18.991]  We're about to end specials.
[01:25:18.991 --> 01:25:22.192]  We've been running for two weeks of free shipping on more than 20 best-selling items and 50% off.
[01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:30.251]  We need folks to go to AlexJonesLegalFund.com.
[01:25:30.251 --> 01:25:34.473]  Same URL, AlexJonesDefenseFund.com takes you there.
[01:25:34.473 --> 01:25:37.334]  And WhoFramedRogerStone.com.
[01:25:37.334 --> 01:25:38.414]  And you need to donate.
[01:25:38.414 --> 01:25:40.695]  You can donate by buying products.
[01:25:40.695 --> 01:25:43.536]  You can donate by direct donation.
[01:25:45.114 --> 01:25:47.177]  But whatever you do, do it.
[01:25:47.177 --> 01:25:49.000]  Because look how we're demonized.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.061]  Look how we're attacked.
[01:25:50.061 --> 01:25:58.834]  After Trump, Roger Stone and Alex Jones are the most demonized, the most sued, the most lied about people.
[01:25:58.834 --> 01:25:59.515]  They edit stuff.
[01:26:00.444 --> 01:26:11.710]  From the show that we never said, little telltale signage, you'll hear audio on NBC or CNN, and notice it's audio, even though the show's video, because they can then edit it.
[01:26:11.710 --> 01:26:14.472]  If they edit video, there's jump cuts, and people catch them.
[01:26:14.472 --> 01:26:16.653]  So they're doing incredibly criminal stuff.
[01:26:18.058 --> 01:26:23.803]  They want me to sue them, because they've got all the unlimited stolen Federal Reserve notes, so they just want me to fight them for a few years.
[01:26:23.803 --> 01:26:25.304]  They don't even care if I win a judgment.
[01:26:25.304 --> 01:26:27.005]  They don't care about the money.
[01:26:27.005 --> 01:26:29.087]  They want to bankrupt us.
[01:26:29.087 --> 01:26:37.394]  They have Hillary's law firms that she works for and that her people are with, admittedly saying, we want to bankrupt Alex Jones.
[01:26:37.394 --> 01:26:39.355]  They're in giant disinformation campaigns.
[01:26:39.355 --> 01:26:42.658]  Now the good news is, the public doesn't buy it.
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:56.307]  The general public as I travel the country, I shook 300 hands or more while I was in Hawaii versus three women that came up to me and said, you're a horrible person, quit saying no kids died at Sandy Hook.
[01:26:56.307 --> 01:27:01.370]  And I'd say, that's out of context and I haven't said that in years and I have apologized.
[01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:03.812]  Shut up, get away from me, I'm calling the police.
[01:27:03.812 --> 01:27:05.913]  Two of the women said, get away from me, get away from me.
[01:27:05.913 --> 01:27:06.934]  So they come over to you.
[01:27:07.774 --> 01:27:13.581]  With their husband walking behind them, it's always the same with their kids, and they get in your face and then call you these names.
[01:27:13.581 --> 01:27:18.086]  So, the problem is they're suing me in Travis County and they're suing me in New Haven, Connecticut.
[01:27:18.086 --> 01:27:21.389]  They're going to the places where they know nobody can get a fair trial.
[01:27:21.389 --> 01:27:23.292]  It's the most liberal venues in the country.
[01:27:24.206 --> 01:27:25.687]  Well, I mean, there's no way.
[01:27:25.687 --> 01:27:29.149]  The top lawyers have said, this is a total lynching, you're not getting a fair shake.
[01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:30.911]  But still, on appeal, it's terminated.
[01:27:30.911 --> 01:27:34.313]  And it'll probably never even get to that, because the judges know what a circus it's going to be.
[01:27:34.313 --> 01:27:40.417]  Because they're also suing people who do think the whole thing's a hoax, saying that they work for me when they don't, and mixing me in with them.
[01:27:40.417 --> 01:27:42.118]  I mean, it's a disaster train wreck.
[01:27:42.118 --> 01:27:45.140]  The lawyers don't want me to get into strategy once we get there, but it's crazy.
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:47.742]  The point is, you've been sued by the president's group.
[01:27:47.742 --> 01:27:48.703]  They're coming after you.
[01:27:48.703 --> 01:27:50.664]  You just won a defamation suit where they sued you.
[01:27:50.664 --> 01:27:51.244]  You won that.
[01:27:51.244 --> 01:27:52.665]  Still, they're trying to bankrupt you.
[01:27:52.665 --> 01:27:53.426]  So here's the bottom line.
[01:27:54.445 --> 01:27:55.366]  This is a real world.
[01:27:55.366 --> 01:27:59.870]  This isn't like watching Netflix or watching football where you're a spectator.
[01:27:59.870 --> 01:28:01.411]  You are on the field.
[01:28:01.411 --> 01:28:06.376]  And when you buy products and when you give us donations, it changes the world.
[01:28:06.376 --> 01:28:09.959]  We need you to go to WhoFramedRogerStone.com.
[01:28:09.959 --> 01:28:10.860]  That's the best place, right?
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:12.702]  Or StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:28:12.702 --> 01:28:14.123]  Yeah, that's the one.
[01:28:14.123 --> 01:28:16.505]  StoneDefenseFund.com takes you to the same place.
[01:28:16.505 --> 01:28:17.326]  Yes.
[01:28:17.326 --> 01:28:19.208]  So, StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:23.164]  People need to go there and they need to donate.
[01:28:23.164 --> 01:28:24.065]  Period.
[01:28:24.065 --> 01:28:27.610]  Listen, so many of the folks that donate are not wealthy.
[01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:29.232]  They affect their poor people or working class.
[01:28:30.535 --> 01:28:36.197]  So many of the middle class and wealthy folks sit on the fence in this world, like keeping your head down keeps you safe.
[01:28:36.197 --> 01:28:38.838]  Keeping your head down almost ruined the country.
[01:28:38.838 --> 01:28:39.758]  We're the tip of the spear.
[01:28:39.758 --> 01:28:40.438]  We need your support.

[01:28:57.165 --> 01:29:08.273]  If you or anyone you love has been diagnosed with lung cancer, asbestosis, or mesothelioma, your diagnosis may be the result of job-related exposure to asbestos and you may be entitled to compensation.
[01:29:08.273 --> 01:29:13.436]  Over $30 billion in trusts have been set aside for individuals who have been affected by asbestos exposure.

[01:33:01.269 --> 01:33:03.971]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:20.862 --> 01:33:25.137]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:25.137 --> 01:33:26.582]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.087 --> 01:33:40.248]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing massive historic things happening right now.
[01:33:40.248 --> 01:33:43.429]  Roger Stone here riding shotgun with me throughout the next few hours.
[01:33:43.429 --> 01:33:47.530]  We're going until 6 o'clock tonight with the special 34-hour global transmission.
[01:33:47.530 --> 01:33:57.153]  I'm thinking about doing a special emergency report tomorrow with Roger Stone, who's here in Austin, but... I don't want to just get up here and whine and say, donate to our legal defense fund, help us.
[01:33:57.153 --> 01:33:58.073]  This is a war.
[01:33:59.113 --> 01:34:01.756]  Like donating in World War II, buying U.S.
[01:34:01.756 --> 01:34:05.340]  war bonds so we get better guns and more munitions to win the war.
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:10.245]  This is absolutely 1,000% critical to the mission being won.
[01:34:10.245 --> 01:34:13.008]  And I want to again thank everybody that supported us.
[01:34:13.008 --> 01:34:16.472]  But back when I first started doing money bombs,
[01:34:17.717 --> 01:34:22.083]  I don't know, like 10 years ago, we would get 90% of the donations in money.
[01:34:22.083 --> 01:34:29.453]  And that means you get a dollar, you get to spend a dollar on the broadcast and equipment and legal or, you know, crew members, things you're doing.
[01:34:31.027 --> 01:34:36.792]  Nowadays, when we ask for donations, it's like 10% of the money that comes in and people just go and they buy product.
[01:34:36.792 --> 01:34:40.995]  Well, when we're doing 50% off, I'm making like $5 on a little silver right now.
[01:34:40.995 --> 01:34:42.176]  It's really high quality.
[01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:44.418]  It's 50% off right now.
[01:34:44.418 --> 01:34:52.925]  You've got some of the products out there, again, where I've got like 50% markup left in it.
[01:34:52.925 --> 01:34:53.406]  When we do
[01:34:55.029 --> 01:34:58.410]  The 50% cut, because normally we mark stuff up 100 to 150%.
[01:34:58.410 --> 01:35:04.712]  The average supplement maker marks them up sevenfold.
[01:35:04.712 --> 01:35:05.233]  We don't do that.
[01:35:05.233 --> 01:35:07.934]  We put a gigantic amount of product.
[01:35:07.934 --> 01:35:14.136]  Things like alpha power for libido, for stamina, for energy, for everything.
[01:35:14.136 --> 01:35:22.639]  I went to the top developers and I said, I want the strongest thing on the market with everything known to be safe and good in it, so that it blows people completely
[01:35:23.519 --> 01:35:24.821]  Out of the water.
[01:35:24.821 --> 01:35:26.623]  I can't take alpha power.
[01:35:26.623 --> 01:35:27.504]  It's so strong.
[01:35:27.504 --> 01:35:28.946]  Supernova Vitality is great.
[01:35:28.946 --> 01:35:31.329]  It's not as strong, but it's cold pressed.
[01:35:31.329 --> 01:35:36.174]  So you get a different effect, but it's got some of the same things in it, even though it's probably 20%.
[01:35:36.174 --> 01:35:40.520]  They've got these big tests and these spectrometer deals, and I get the reports.
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:41.341]  I don't understand it all.
[01:35:43.336 --> 01:35:47.138]  The point is, is that cold press is different with the molecules and what it's got in it.
[01:35:47.138 --> 01:35:48.839]  It's from fresh herbs.
[01:35:48.839 --> 01:35:52.420]  Alpha powder is from high quality organic concentrated herbs, but it's from the dry ones.
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:54.581]  So it's a different thing.
[01:35:54.581 --> 01:35:55.522]  It's way stronger.
[01:35:55.522 --> 01:35:58.243]  We have those comboed right now, 50% off.
[01:35:58.243 --> 01:36:00.544]  Those specials are about to end.
[01:36:00.544 --> 01:36:02.385]  But if the listeners just commit,
[01:36:03.277 --> 01:36:16.921]  To pray for the broadcast, to spread the articles, to spread the videos, to buy the product, the product you like, like the Wake Up America Coffee or the other products that are perishable or that you're going to reuse, then just sign up for AutoShip.
[01:36:16.921 --> 01:36:20.822]  Cancel any time, every 15, every 30, every 60, every 90 days.
[01:36:20.822 --> 01:36:31.946]  Cancel any time, get an additional 10% off on that order, locking in the old original sales price, another great deal, and you get 5% on every dollar, Patriot Points!
[01:36:33.086 --> 01:36:35.707]  So you add all this together, these are amazing deals.
[01:36:35.707 --> 01:36:37.648]  Take Prostagard.
[01:36:37.648 --> 01:36:42.770]  They have saw palmetto stuff, and even the FDA admits that helps with your prostate and other things.
[01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:45.871]  It's rare to even admit what herbs do.
[01:36:45.871 --> 01:36:47.812]  And I see it sold for like 50, 60 bucks out there.
[01:36:47.812 --> 01:36:55.315]  We put stronger saw palmetto and then a bunch of other known things that are good for your prostate in, and then sell it for half the price.
[01:36:55.315 --> 01:36:58.797]  When it's on sale, it's even less than half the price of leading competitors.
[01:37:00.034 --> 01:37:01.975]  It's better, it's stronger, it's a lower price.
[01:37:01.975 --> 01:37:05.876]  You cannot lose with these products unless you don't order them.
[01:37:05.876 --> 01:37:09.358]  This is a non-zero-sum game, total win-win.
[01:37:09.358 --> 01:37:20.663]  Now, that said, Roger Stone with his new Stone's Rules book is not going to be able to pay his legal bills, all the things he's doing, where he makes a couple bucks off each one he sells.
[01:37:21.644 --> 01:37:27.047]  At the time, he gets 20-30% from the publisher of what they keep.
[01:37:27.047 --> 01:37:33.470]  They're selling it, as I know, to Amazon for $10 or selling it to the bookstore for $10, and then he gets $3.
[01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:35.571]  That doesn't float the boat.
[01:37:35.571 --> 01:37:38.653]  So, go get the book at InfoWorksStore.com.
[01:37:38.653 --> 01:37:39.613]  It's excellent.
[01:37:39.613 --> 01:37:42.235]  How to Win at Politics, Business, and Style.
[01:37:42.875 --> 01:37:48.197]  But more importantly, go to WhoFramedRogerStone.com or Stone Legal Defense Fund.
[01:37:48.197 --> 01:37:49.938]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:37:49.938 --> 01:37:51.038]  And that's the one I want on screen.
[01:37:51.038 --> 01:37:51.618]  Let's change it.
[01:37:51.618 --> 01:37:53.799]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:37:53.799 --> 01:37:56.420]  We even had meetings about that and then I got this one that said this.
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.161]  So say it again so it's clear for everybody.
[01:37:58.161 --> 01:38:00.542]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:38:00.542 --> 01:38:03.203]  Alex, I think it's important people understand what I'm going through.
[01:38:03.203 --> 01:38:11.786]  Right now, Robert Mueller's minions are fighting in court to drag every young person who's worked for me over the last 10 years in front of a grand jury.
[01:38:12.406 --> 01:38:19.668]  They're asking them inappropriate questions about my personal life, my business life, my friendship with you, my relationship with you.
[01:38:19.668 --> 01:38:20.988]  Did you vote for Donald Trump?
[01:38:20.988 --> 01:38:22.649]  Do you like Donald Trump?
[01:38:22.649 --> 01:38:24.749]  This is an inquisition.
[01:38:24.749 --> 01:38:26.590]  I have broken no laws.
[01:38:26.590 --> 01:38:29.251]  They're empty-handed on Russian collusion.
[01:38:29.251 --> 01:38:33.172]  They're empty-handed on any hijinks with WikiLeaks.
[01:38:33.172 --> 01:38:35.752]  It's a witch hunt, just like the President says.
[01:38:35.752 --> 01:38:38.973]  I'm being persecuted for supporting Donald Trump.
[01:38:38.973 --> 01:38:39.933]  That's what this is about.
[01:38:39.933 --> 01:38:41.574]  And that segues us into this.
[01:38:43.464 --> 01:38:44.605]  Right now.
[01:38:44.605 --> 01:38:46.526]  Manafort, you predicted it was coming?
[01:38:46.526 --> 01:38:48.327]  Tell folks what just happened to him.
[01:38:48.327 --> 01:38:54.490]  They have revoked his bail so that he can sit in a jail cell to put additional pressure on him to plead guilty.
[01:38:54.490 --> 01:38:56.131]  They don't want to go to trial.
[01:38:56.131 --> 01:39:01.013]  The reason they don't want to go to trial is because their surveillance will become known.
[01:39:01.013 --> 01:39:07.357]  And their surveillance, like the surveillance on me through a FISA warrant, is most likely unconstitutional and illegal.
[01:39:07.357 --> 01:39:10.338]  It was surveillance for political purposes.
[01:39:10.338 --> 01:39:11.339]  Under the FISA law,
[01:39:12.199 --> 01:39:21.724]  A US citizen can only be issued a FISA surveillance warrant if they're engaged in espionage for a foreign power against the United States.
[01:39:21.724 --> 01:39:24.245]  That clearly, that definition does not fit.
[01:39:24.245 --> 01:39:27.807]  They now admit it's a process thing from over a decade ago where they claim
[01:39:28.487 --> 01:39:33.291]  He had an offshore corporation that was wrong, and now they've moved on to jail time for tampering with witnesses.
[01:39:33.291 --> 01:39:38.634]  There's no Russia there except Strzok covering up what Hillary and her foundation was doing.
[01:39:38.634 --> 01:39:42.237]  This is absolutely cruel and unusual punishment.
[01:39:42.237 --> 01:39:46.280]  Why don't they just put him in the stocks or hang him up by chains by his ankles to make him talk?
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:52.122]  They just want him to plead because they don't want to go to trial because it will expose their illegal surveillance.
[01:39:52.122 --> 01:39:54.944]  But you predicted correctly that Manafort will not make stuff up.
[01:39:54.944 --> 01:39:57.225]  It's not rolling because there's nothing there.
[01:39:57.225 --> 01:39:58.085]  It's the same thing.
[01:39:58.085 --> 01:40:06.809]  Look, now that they know there is no Russian collusion on my part, there is no collusion or coordination or collaboration with WikiLeaks,
[01:40:07.429 --> 01:40:15.732]  It's entirely possible that they will conjure up some bogus offense and use it to pressure me to testify against Donald Trump.
[01:40:15.732 --> 01:40:17.132]  That's what they want.
[01:40:17.132 --> 01:40:20.253]  They know I have been a Trump confidant for 40 years.
[01:40:20.253 --> 01:40:22.174]  They know that I know many things.
[01:40:22.174 --> 01:40:24.775]  They want me to testify against the president.
[01:40:24.775 --> 01:40:32.097]  Alex, it's not going to happen, but fending them off is going to cost me a million dollars because they're going to try to give me the Manafort treatment.
[01:40:32.657 --> 01:40:40.200]  I sleep well at night because I know I've broken no laws and everything I did in connection with the 2016 election was entirely legal.
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:43.181]  How long could Manafort sit in jail waiting for a trial that never comes?
[01:40:43.181 --> 01:40:49.424]  Because it's admitted the judge is trying to speed this along and has actually come out and said you guys are full of it, this is political.
[01:40:49.744 --> 01:40:51.806]  Well then why did the same judge then just throw him in jail?
[01:40:51.806 --> 01:40:54.248]  You've got two different states and two different judges.
[01:40:54.248 --> 01:41:01.514]  The judge in Virginia has called Mueller out on the political nature of his inquiry and the phoniness.
[01:41:01.514 --> 01:41:04.116]  Those charges may yet even get thrown out yet.
[01:41:04.116 --> 01:41:05.678]  But the charges in D.C.
[01:41:05.678 --> 01:41:07.799]  are in front of an Obama-appointed judge.
[01:41:07.799 --> 01:41:08.600]  A swamp creature.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.662]  Who is most definitely not sympathetic.
[01:41:12.694 --> 01:41:30.198]  You know, it's incredible how brazen, how can they continue on with this the day after the Inspector General report comes out admitting that Obama was using a codename, was using an alias, was involving legal activity, did lie about it with the Hillary server.
[01:41:30.198 --> 01:41:32.339]  You've got Strzok saying he'll never be president.
[01:41:32.339 --> 01:41:33.199]  We're going to stop him.
[01:41:33.199 --> 01:41:34.999]  We're going to have our insurance policy.
[01:41:34.999 --> 01:41:37.260]  This is so huge.
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:39.420]  And we need to see these people indicted.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:41.321]  We need to see Trump go after them.
[01:41:42.575 --> 01:41:45.877]  The Russian case is the most egregious example.
[01:41:45.877 --> 01:41:50.761]  Mr. Mueller brings a case against these 13 Russians, assuming they'll never show up for trial.
[01:41:50.761 --> 01:41:53.062]  They show up and they plead not guilty.
[01:41:53.062 --> 01:41:57.545]  Under American jurisprudence, they're entitled to see the evidence against them.
[01:41:57.545 --> 01:41:58.806]  He won't show it to them.
[01:41:58.806 --> 01:42:01.808]  He says he can't because it's an ongoing investigation.
[01:42:01.808 --> 01:42:06.271]  Well, if it's an ongoing investigation, why did he already bring the indictment?
[01:42:06.271 --> 01:42:09.293]  He doesn't want to demonstrate what he has.
[01:42:09.293 --> 01:42:11.755]  I can't see any judge going along with that.
[01:42:12.475 --> 01:42:14.917]  So how long can Manafort sit there, potentially?
[01:42:14.917 --> 01:42:17.178]  Well, they're talking about trial now in September.
[01:42:17.178 --> 01:42:20.780]  He could be in jail for three or four months.
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:23.081]  This is meant to induce him to plead.
[01:42:23.081 --> 01:42:26.523]  But you know him, you've been business partners with him for decades.
[01:42:26.523 --> 01:42:28.084]  You say he's a tough cookie.
[01:42:28.084 --> 01:42:29.865]  Look, he's an Italian-American.
[01:42:29.865 --> 01:42:31.806]  He knows he's done nothing wrong.
[01:42:31.806 --> 01:42:37.069]  Certainly, no charges against him pertain to the Trump campaign or what he did to elect Donald Trump.
[01:42:37.069 --> 01:42:40.231]  He's being punished for nominating Donald Trump for president.
[01:42:40.231 --> 01:42:41.432]  That's why he's being punished.
[01:42:43.208 --> 01:42:48.576]  And now they're putting fake charges out from 28 years ago on Sylvester Stallone for protecting the president.
[01:42:48.576 --> 01:42:52.402]  If you defend the president, they make stuff up about you and try to throw you in jail.
[01:42:52.402 --> 01:42:55.086]  Because he's a real American president, he's bringing the country back.
[01:42:55.086 --> 01:42:56.429]  We're gonna break it all down straight ahead.
[01:42:59.343 --> 01:43:06.068]  This is the last week to get free shipping on all of our best-selling items at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:43:16.015 --> 01:43:20.499]  BodyE's Ultimate Turmeric Formula has the strongest curcumin in level
[01:43:20.839 --> 01:43:21.559]  We're good to go.
[01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:53.614]  And look at some of those items for yourself, whether it's water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds, X2, it's all there at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:43:57.509 --> 01:44:01.453]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:01.453 --> 01:44:04.757]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:44:04.757 --> 01:44:11.024]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:11.024 --> 01:44:13.807]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:44:14.528 --> 01:44:18.349]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:44:18.349 --> 01:44:24.811]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:44:24.811 --> 01:44:29.773]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.529 --> 01:44:34.451]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:44:34.451 --> 01:44:41.655]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:41.655 --> 01:44:46.337]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:44:46.337 --> 01:44:52.561]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:52.561 --> 01:44:56.543]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:02.903]  Our team is always looking for new ways to improve our products.
[01:45:02.903 --> 01:45:07.147]  That's why we've created the newest version of a fan favorite formula.

[01:45:59.016 --> 01:46:03.858]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:46:03.858 --> 01:46:12.781]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[01:46:12.781 --> 01:46:18.102]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[01:46:26.485 --> 01:46:26.805]  I think so.
[01:47:00.812 --> 01:47:03.436]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:20.385 --> 01:47:38.694]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:38.694 --> 01:47:47.038]  Okay, I intend to open the phones up for Roger Stone and myself on the IG report on all the things that are happening.
[01:47:47.038 --> 01:47:48.059]  Do you think I'm over?
[01:47:50.851 --> 01:47:53.859]  Optimistic about how Trump's delivering?
[01:47:53.859 --> 01:47:59.533]  Now he's gotten so much done even for an instant gratification society and culture in a year and a half it's dizzying?
[01:48:00.723 --> 01:48:06.529]  Your report card on the State of the Union, the State of the World, on Trump, and how the Deep State's going to strike back.
[01:48:06.529 --> 01:48:11.714]  Because make no mistake, they are striking back against us, and against you, and really trying to suppress this country.
[01:48:11.714 --> 01:48:13.015]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:48:13.015 --> 01:48:15.298]  877-789-ALEX is the number on this Global Friday Transmission.
[01:48:22.668 --> 01:48:27.812]  And Roger and I will be hosting on and off again today, right through 6 o'clock in the 34-hour broadcast.
[01:48:27.812 --> 01:48:36.319]  I may even go later tonight because there's so much to cover and so much to get into and so much happening, but we'll see.
[01:48:36.319 --> 01:48:41.003]  We're going to go over the IG report and some of the other areas, but I don't feel like
[01:48:42.236 --> 01:49:03.126]  I even have words to describe how bizarre this is, because they come out and say, you didn't do anything wrong, but yes, Trump was illegally spied on, and yes, they lied to do it, and yes, they violated all the FBI rules, and yes, they lied to Congress, and yes, Obama lied, and yes, he was inside the illegal server with all this classified stuff and foreign governments, clearly a drop box.
[01:49:03.806 --> 01:49:10.009]  Just a total sell-out America orgy facility with the President and the State Department head and all these foreign governments.
[01:49:10.009 --> 01:49:12.531]  This is walk-the-plank stuff.
[01:49:12.531 --> 01:49:14.352]  This is firing squad stuff.
[01:49:14.352 --> 01:49:17.354]  And I'm not saying I want any harm to come to Hillary or Obama.
[01:49:17.354 --> 01:49:22.496]  I want them to be charged, have a trial, and be put in supermax prison.
[01:49:22.496 --> 01:49:26.659]  But it's confirmed they were sabotaging the country for the communist Chinese and the globalists.
[01:49:27.506 --> 01:49:28.386]  That's the plan.
[01:49:28.386 --> 01:49:28.967]  That's what happens.
[01:49:28.967 --> 01:49:29.947]  You study history.
[01:49:29.947 --> 01:49:34.830]  There were always traitors in Rome, and traitors in England, and traitors in ancient Japan.
[01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:42.334]  You'd have some honorable guy that's been known for decades, you know, in the Shogun, who would then turn against, you know, the people.
[01:49:42.334 --> 01:49:44.535]  I mean, Benedict Arnold, this is happening!
[01:49:44.935 --> 01:49:55.838]  The Office of Personnel Management, 21 million names, all the codes given to the Chi-Coms, the Apple codes given to them publicly three months ago, total sellout, all the patriots being targeted, saying we're the enemies.
[01:49:55.838 --> 01:49:57.338]  No, we're the Americans.
[01:49:57.338 --> 01:49:59.219]  They think we're dumb, we believe, in the country.
[01:49:59.219 --> 01:50:00.539]  They believe we're dumb, we're loyal.
[01:50:00.539 --> 01:50:02.780]  No, we're not scum like you.
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:06.441]  We don't support mobile execution vans for Christians and Buddhists in China.
[01:50:06.441 --> 01:50:08.341]  We don't support total surveillance.
[01:50:08.341 --> 01:50:13.383]  We don't support totally open borders in the UN and weirdo Nazi collaborators.
[01:50:14.975 --> 01:50:21.759]  There must be a paid talking point out that George Soros was captured by the Nazis and that George Soros was this hero.
[01:50:21.759 --> 01:50:31.145]  I've seen that on CNN and everywhere else but then I even saw it on a well-known podcast last night and because it was about me and I looked it up and Alex Jones is wrong.
[01:50:31.145 --> 01:50:33.226]  George Soros was captured by the Nazis.
[01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:36.848]  No, he told 60 Minutes he helped his father round up Jews.
[01:50:36.848 --> 01:50:37.509]  He said it!
[01:50:38.643 --> 01:50:41.506]  But everybody bows to that son of a piece of crap.
[01:50:41.506 --> 01:50:42.847]  And I am not going to do it.
[01:50:42.847 --> 01:50:45.911]  Not because I'm macho, but because I'm going to live.
[01:50:45.911 --> 01:50:48.814]  I'm not rolling over to criminals.
[01:50:48.814 --> 01:50:53.018]  Nazi collaborators deserve to be off this planet.
[01:50:53.018 --> 01:50:54.520]  And some sick twist of fate.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:59.225]  Both my grandfathers, who almost died in World War II in the Army Air Corps, have been dead for a long time.
[01:51:00.728 --> 01:51:05.071]  And then that person is just slamming around suing me and attacking me.
[01:51:05.071 --> 01:51:09.835]  And the fact is, I think more of Americans to get scum like this off our backs.
[01:51:09.835 --> 01:51:11.116]  I'm trying to get them off your back.
[01:51:11.116 --> 01:51:12.016]  You take Bill Maher.
[01:51:12.016 --> 01:51:14.118]  In fact, cue that up.
[01:51:14.118 --> 01:51:16.079]  I didn't play it yesterday.
[01:51:16.079 --> 01:51:18.862]  He gets up there and he says, I want Trump to go.
[01:51:20.239 --> 01:51:21.600]  You know, belly up.
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:23.741]  And to do that, I want America to go belly up.
[01:51:23.741 --> 01:51:26.102]  I want to crash this economy.
[01:51:26.102 --> 01:51:29.804]  He's worth over $100 million in his own words.
[01:51:29.804 --> 01:51:33.446]  He makes $10 million a year just off doing one show a week with HBO.
[01:51:33.446 --> 01:51:36.627]  Not to mention all his other crap.
[01:51:36.627 --> 01:51:40.469]  And he sits up there and he says he wants to crash our economy.
[01:51:40.469 --> 01:51:44.211]  That's the nature of globalism.
[01:51:44.211 --> 01:51:45.312]  Trump wants prosperity.
[01:51:45.312 --> 01:51:46.312]  He believes in you.
[01:51:46.312 --> 01:51:48.814]  Let's go ahead and play the Bill Maher clip.
[01:51:50.430 --> 01:51:52.111]  Can I ask about the economy?
[01:51:52.111 --> 01:51:54.472]  Because this economy is going pretty well.
[01:51:54.472 --> 01:51:56.273]  We have to... What?
[01:51:56.273 --> 01:51:57.573]  Why is that funny?
[01:51:57.573 --> 01:51:59.054]  It is going well for now.
[01:51:59.054 --> 01:51:59.714]  For now, right.
[01:51:59.714 --> 01:52:02.315]  That's my question.
[01:52:02.315 --> 01:52:06.017]  I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point.
[01:52:06.017 --> 01:52:07.837]  And by the way, I'm hoping for it.
[01:52:07.837 --> 01:52:11.379]  Because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy.
[01:52:11.379 --> 01:52:13.400]  So please, bring on the recession.
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:18.162]  Sorry if that hurts people, but it's either root for a recession or you lose your democracy.
[01:52:20.171 --> 01:52:21.072]  Unbelievable.
[01:52:21.072 --> 01:52:22.613]  I mean, he wants to hurt people.
[01:52:22.613 --> 01:52:24.034]  He wants to hurt working people.
[01:52:24.034 --> 01:52:28.316]  He wants to hurt people at the bottom of the system.
[01:52:28.316 --> 01:52:30.678]  You saw that two minute video that Trump had for Kim Jong Un.
[01:52:30.678 --> 01:52:32.539]  It's about destiny, the little people.
[01:52:32.539 --> 01:52:33.300]  Let's help them.
[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:34.841]  Let's be real men of leadership.
[01:52:34.841 --> 01:52:36.802]  Let's believe in the human power of the average person.
[01:52:36.802 --> 01:52:38.483]  Let's have goodwill.
[01:52:38.483 --> 01:52:39.964]  Trump is goodwill.
[01:52:39.964 --> 01:52:41.505]  These people are badwill.
[01:52:41.505 --> 01:52:47.469]  Well, it's just like they're hoping for the collapse of the peace talks in Korea because they're being conducted by Donald Trump.
[01:52:47.469 --> 01:52:47.769]  They don't.
[01:52:47.769 --> 01:52:48.930]  You know why he wants to collapse?
[01:52:48.930 --> 01:52:50.011]  Because he can buy everything up.
[01:52:50.591 --> 01:52:52.552]  When we are collapsed.
[01:52:52.552 --> 01:52:54.073]  It's pathetic.
[01:52:54.073 --> 01:53:02.037]  It reminds me of in Nixon's second term when he signed a strategic arms limitation agreement with the Soviets.
[01:53:02.037 --> 01:53:06.680]  You would think the liberals would be celebrating, but no, because he signed it, they were against it.
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:08.141]  It's the same thing here.
[01:53:08.141 --> 01:53:12.243]  Donald Trump has done what three previous presidents could not do.
[01:53:12.243 --> 01:53:14.744]  He's got the North Koreans at the table.
[01:53:14.744 --> 01:53:15.505]  He's closing in.
[01:53:15.505 --> 01:53:17.886]  They've already agreed to everything and they've already come across the border.
[01:53:18.813 --> 01:53:19.574]  It's done.
[01:53:19.574 --> 01:53:24.178]  They've already now said America's good and Trump is good when they've never done that in 60 plus years.
[01:53:24.178 --> 01:53:24.878]  It's done.
[01:53:24.878 --> 01:53:26.140]  They did the deal.
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:28.261]  But the neocons are trying to sabotage.
[01:53:28.261 --> 01:53:31.744]  Well, the president's smart enough to have a deal that can be verified.
[01:53:31.744 --> 01:53:32.625]  He's not a sucker.
[01:53:32.625 --> 01:53:35.427]  He's not going to be taking... No, we're going to take control of the weapons of France.
[01:53:35.427 --> 01:53:42.694]  It's not going to be like the Iranian deal that Barack Obama did, but they don't even want to give him... No, they're going to deliver the goods and blow everything up.
[01:53:43.721 --> 01:53:47.202]  Or we'll have him violate the deal and blow the living snot out of him.
[01:53:47.202 --> 01:53:50.324]  That's why you see this hysteria in the country.
[01:53:50.324 --> 01:53:52.525]  Robert Mueller's disapproval, 53%.
[01:53:52.525 --> 01:53:55.806]  The President's approval rating climbing.
[01:53:55.806 --> 01:53:58.027]  The economy soaring.
[01:53:58.027 --> 01:53:59.127]  He's come along, he's upset.
[01:53:59.127 --> 01:54:02.409]  By the way, did you see the look on Kim Jong-un's hand when he signed that with Trump?
[01:54:02.409 --> 01:54:06.550]  He looks like he's totally freaked out, but hiring a kite in a good way.
[01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:10.072]  Going back from the dark side, like Darth Vader throwing the emperor down.
[01:54:10.072 --> 01:54:10.972]  I mean, look at the look.
[01:54:11.412 --> 01:54:15.814]  I mean, he is definitely under the spell of Trump right there and gets it.
[01:54:15.814 --> 01:54:17.634]  Look when he looks up right here.
[01:54:17.634 --> 01:54:17.854]  Boom.
[01:54:17.854 --> 01:54:19.515]  He just did it.
[01:54:19.515 --> 01:54:21.175]  And you see him breathe in?
[01:54:21.175 --> 01:54:22.076]  It's done.
[01:54:22.076 --> 01:54:22.576]  It's done.
[01:54:22.576 --> 01:54:24.596]  He's going to bring prosperity to his country.
[01:54:24.596 --> 01:54:27.077]  Kim Jong Un has never looked like that in any video I've seen.
[01:54:27.077 --> 01:54:28.738]  He's got tears in his eye right there.
[01:54:28.738 --> 01:54:32.339]  He just did the right thing and I think felt the Holy Spirit for the first time in his life.
[01:54:32.915 --> 01:54:34.777]  He's gonna bring prosperity to his people.
[01:54:34.777 --> 01:54:37.699]  He's gonna... That's gotta feel good to try to take care of people, doesn't it?
[01:54:37.699 --> 01:54:39.981]  Instead of being a piece of crap all day!
[01:54:39.981 --> 01:54:44.565]  Like that idiot Soros that has overthrown more than 20 countries and bankrupted nations.
[01:54:44.565 --> 01:54:55.355]  When I was a teenager, it was on Lair News Hour that he bankrupted countries and tried to bankrupt Europe and tried to bankrupt England and tried to bankrupt Muslim countries and did it and made hundreds of billions on evil.
[01:54:55.355 --> 01:55:00.179]  And then he came into the US and bought everybody off in the 90s and now he's the second coming of Christ.
[01:55:00.539 --> 01:55:06.041]  There's no question in my mind that he is the one financing all of these bogus lawsuits against you.
[01:55:06.041 --> 01:55:11.504]  That's where the money's coming from, that's where the direction... I have been told, stop saying it!
[01:55:11.504 --> 01:55:17.766]  I've been told, leave Soros alone and stop saying he's a Nazi, leave radical Muslims alone and stop covering the child kidnapping and you'll be left alone.
[01:55:17.766 --> 01:55:19.187]  Well guess what?
[01:55:19.187 --> 01:55:20.988]  I'm sure they've all noticed I'm not shutting up.
[01:55:21.903 --> 01:55:23.105]  To say the least.
[01:55:23.105 --> 01:55:26.652]  Hey, I'm gonna go back to the table again to people right here.
[01:55:26.652 --> 01:55:30.439]  You have a chance right now to supercharge history.
[01:55:30.439 --> 01:55:33.564]  I'm playing a game of chicken just like Road Warrior here against Humongous.
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:35.240]  Okay.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:37.361]  I'm not going to turn the 18-wheeler.
[01:55:37.361 --> 01:55:38.561]  I'm going in against them.
[01:55:38.561 --> 01:55:43.783]  But fuel, I have to have fuel in the tank to get the 18-wheeler up to 110 miles an hour.
[01:55:43.783 --> 01:55:45.203]  There's no governor on this.
[01:55:45.203 --> 01:55:47.143]  Humongous has got nitrous oxide on him.
[01:55:47.143 --> 01:55:49.984]  He's going at me at 180 miles an hour in his tractor.
[01:55:49.984 --> 01:55:51.345]  Here's the difference.
[01:55:51.345 --> 01:55:55.006]  We're bigger, we're heavier, we're going to run them off the road.
[01:55:55.006 --> 01:56:01.787]  But I need to get the gas speed up all the way so that when I ran into these people at 110 miles an hour, and they're going 180, we're talking
[01:56:05.285 --> 01:56:08.587]  We're talking 300-something miles an hour here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:08.587 --> 01:56:09.208]  290 miles an hour.
[01:56:09.208 --> 01:56:18.855]  I want full impact, full absolute rampage, terminal velocity, point of no return, crossing the Rubicon, event horizon.
[01:56:18.855 --> 01:56:20.456]  I want incineration.
[01:56:21.136 --> 01:56:26.383]  And so I'm telling you, I want your prayers, I want your will, I want your strength, I want your honor.
[01:56:26.383 --> 01:56:30.307]  But I don't want your will turned over to me, I want you to turn your will on.
[01:56:30.307 --> 01:56:36.956]  And for all of us to combine forces, like Trump has us doing with our spirit, that they can feel and see manifest.
[01:56:36.956 --> 01:56:40.199]  And I want to see full, absolute commitment.
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:47.064]  Spread the article, spread the video, support the local stations, and go to Infowarsstore.com and buy product.
[01:56:47.064 --> 01:56:51.967]  Go to AlexJonesLegalFund.com and make straight up donations.
[01:56:51.967 --> 01:56:54.128]  We're not some tax-free thing the government controlled.
[01:56:54.128 --> 01:56:56.130]  We're an operations sole proprietorship by me.
[01:56:57.589 --> 01:57:01.013]  I need, let me tell you something, money.
[01:57:01.013 --> 01:57:04.957]  $1 to 100,000 of Soros's trumps him, but we gotta have the $1 seed money to trump him.
[01:57:04.957 --> 01:57:11.364]  With a few million dollars, we can 100% defeat even 50 more of these fake things and crush the enemy.
[01:57:11.364 --> 01:57:15.869]  But we know they are fully committed to take us down because we are attacking them at point-blank range.
[01:57:16.169 --> 01:57:17.350]  I need everybody to go donate.
[01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:22.373]  If you've never donated or never bought product, now is the time for you to get off the bench and in the game.
[01:57:22.373 --> 01:57:25.394]  We can't do it without you and I want total victory here.
[01:57:25.394 --> 01:57:29.136]  I want to go in to the enemy and I want to be at ramming speed.
[01:57:29.136 --> 01:57:32.958]  Absolutely to ram down their throat with everything we've got.
[01:57:32.958 --> 01:57:33.159]  Show!
[01:57:33.999 --> 01:57:41.805]  Go to RogerStoneLegalDefenseFund.com StoneDefenseFund.com I tell you, it says a different thing here.
[01:57:41.805 --> 01:57:43.366]  I cannot have the real thing!
[01:57:43.366 --> 01:57:44.507]  Hell would enter!
[01:57:44.507 --> 01:57:46.148]  It's Vortex and I wouldn't have it!
[01:57:46.148 --> 01:57:48.070]  I love it!
[01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:51.452]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia.
[01:57:51.452 --> 01:57:52.653]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:57:52.653 --> 01:57:53.194]  Thanks for calling.
[01:57:53.194 --> 01:57:54.655]  Hey Alex, mate.
[01:57:54.655 --> 01:57:58.257]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[01:57:58.257 --> 01:58:02.841]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen.
[01:58:03.001 --> 01:58:03.701]  Thank you very much!
[01:58:23.790 --> 01:58:32.375]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:58:32.375 --> 01:58:37.278]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[01:58:37.278 --> 01:58:43.621]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there.
[01:58:43.621 --> 01:58:48.444]  1776 Worldwide.
[01:58:48.444 --> 01:58:50.105]  We can't extend this.
[01:58:54.377 --> 01:58:55.217]  We're good to go.
[01:59:19.029 --> 01:59:19.509]  Thank you.
[01:59:51.784 --> 01:59:54.392]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:14.648 --> 02:00:18.731]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:18.731 --> 02:00:20.773]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.773 --> 02:00:23.535]  Alright, it's StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:00:23.535 --> 02:00:24.716]  There's like five other URLs.
[02:00:24.716 --> 02:00:27.418]  The crew is right as well, but that's the one that takes you to the easiest.
[02:00:27.418 --> 02:00:30.060]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:31.341]  Everybody should go there and make a donation.
[02:00:31.341 --> 02:00:34.483]  The easiest thing to do is go to AlexJonesLegalFund.com.
[02:00:34.483 --> 02:00:36.345]  There's a big fat link right up there.
[02:00:36.345 --> 02:00:39.367]  We're going to go to your phone calls basically right now.
[02:00:39.367 --> 02:00:41.208]  I'm going to recap all the big news.
[02:00:41.208 --> 02:00:41.949]  And I'm not bitching.
[02:00:41.949 --> 02:00:42.870]  I'm not complaining here.
[02:00:43.866 --> 02:00:47.468]  It's just Hillary and all these globalists need to be defeated.
[02:00:47.468 --> 02:00:56.613]  And they realize that Infowars and Roger Stone and others are creating the countervailing narrative and the talking points that are accurate versus their talking points that are lies.
[02:00:56.613 --> 02:00:58.574]  So they want to shut us down.
[02:00:58.574 --> 02:01:10.101]  The good news is I'm seeing our understanding of things duplicated everywhere now with even greater viciousness and truthfulness and just righteousness and so
[02:01:11.241 --> 02:01:23.206]  We're important in the future on the fight, but I at a gut level have to say as well, not the best way to raise money, but even if they destroy us, Roger, it will be a Pyrrhic victory for them.
[02:01:23.206 --> 02:01:26.387]  Well, they're not going to destroy us, but more importantly, they're not going to destroy the country.
[02:01:26.387 --> 02:01:28.408]  But we're ready to be destroyed.
[02:01:28.408 --> 02:01:31.789]  I'm ready to make sure Donald Trump succeeds and that this country is saved.
[02:01:31.789 --> 02:01:32.369]  That's the most important.
[02:01:32.369 --> 02:01:33.810]  But we're going on to the end.
[02:01:33.810 --> 02:01:35.050]  Well, we're going to fight to the bitter end.
[02:01:35.050 --> 02:01:35.670]  There's no question.
[02:01:35.670 --> 02:01:38.211]  Let's just say we are expendable.
[02:01:38.211 --> 02:01:40.092]  My wife would probably disagree with that, but yeah.
[02:01:41.367 --> 02:01:42.788]  I mean, that's what we have to just say.
[02:01:42.788 --> 02:01:43.368]  We're expendable.
[02:01:43.368 --> 02:01:44.189]  We accept that.
[02:01:44.189 --> 02:01:45.669]  But we don't want that to happen.
[02:01:45.669 --> 02:01:48.090]  But it's up to you whether we're expendable or not.
[02:01:48.090 --> 02:01:51.172]  Because the way they're coming at us is with legal and with dollar signs.
[02:01:51.172 --> 02:01:57.095]  And if they see you respond and they see us keep expanding, they are going to be demoralized and they're going to fall the wayside.
[02:01:57.095 --> 02:02:00.036]  Right now is massive rampage force.
[02:02:00.356 --> 02:02:01.417]  Go ahead.
[02:02:01.417 --> 02:02:02.838]  There's no question about it.
[02:02:02.838 --> 02:02:07.783]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingraham on the Laura Ingraham Angle in 5.
[02:02:07.783 --> 02:02:08.864]  By the way, let's save that.
[02:02:08.864 --> 02:02:09.644]  Let's find that.
[02:02:09.644 --> 02:02:10.485]  Go ahead.
[02:02:10.485 --> 02:02:13.988]  And I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[02:02:13.988 --> 02:02:15.269]  I had done The War Room.
[02:02:16.290 --> 02:02:20.372]  She's not on until 9.40 Central, that's 10.40 Eastern.
[02:02:20.372 --> 02:02:21.933]  I was exhausted.
[02:02:21.933 --> 02:02:25.895]  I popped two Brain Force Plus and I was good as new.
[02:02:25.895 --> 02:02:32.359]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilizing, mentally energizing.
[02:02:32.359 --> 02:02:34.320]  It's at a great price now.
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:37.342]  I could never have done that broadcast last night.
[02:02:37.342 --> 02:02:39.643]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[02:02:40.503 --> 02:02:41.063]  The same thing.
[02:02:41.063 --> 02:02:43.405]  I'm going to put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[02:02:43.405 --> 02:02:44.825]  I'm going to go on with Tucker tonight.
[02:02:44.825 --> 02:02:47.307]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[02:02:47.307 --> 02:02:50.608]  You've got an extraordinary price on it here.
[02:02:50.608 --> 02:02:56.171]  This is my all-time favorite and you are supporting the InfoWars when you buy this stuff.
[02:02:56.171 --> 02:02:59.412]  But once you buy it, you will go to the auto ship.
[02:02:59.412 --> 02:03:07.136]  You will become a habitual user because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked up energy drink feeling.
[02:03:07.136 --> 02:03:08.597]  You know, you can sleep with it.
[02:03:11.013 --> 02:03:16.138]  We set out to say, what are the top nootropic companies putting out for $67?
[02:03:16.138 --> 02:03:17.480]  And they said, it's this.
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:19.642]  We talked to the top level, what would you do to make it stronger and better?
[02:03:19.642 --> 02:03:22.205]  Well, we'd add this and take out that.
[02:03:22.205 --> 02:03:25.708]  And then when we sell it at $40, you know, we're making $25.
[02:03:28.407 --> 02:03:32.669]  When we're selling at $19.95, folks, we're making like $5 here.
[02:03:32.669 --> 02:03:37.312]  I'm telling you, Brainforce Plus at $19.95 is almost a lost leader.
[02:03:37.312 --> 02:03:42.315]  You sign up for AutoShip, it basically is at this point, but why am I doing it?
[02:03:42.315 --> 02:03:51.320]  Because I know it's so good that once you try it and realize that stuff $60 isn't as good, you will become a habitual user of it and it's healthy and it's good and it's great.
[02:03:52.330 --> 02:03:57.673]  And when you stack it with the red pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[02:03:57.673 --> 02:04:01.154]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[02:04:01.154 --> 02:04:02.875]  This is the best combination I have found.
[02:04:02.875 --> 02:04:07.457]  It takes most people about a week for the real red pill to kick in.
[02:04:07.457 --> 02:04:08.498]  But it really works.
[02:04:08.498 --> 02:04:13.420]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found, and I've tried them all.
[02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:16.882]  I wasted a lot of money at Whole Foods, believe me, before I came to it.
[02:04:16.882 --> 02:04:17.382]  Here's the thing.
[02:04:17.382 --> 02:04:19.483]  At age 30, preglanone is a hormone precursor.
[02:04:19.483 --> 02:04:20.524]  It starts going down in everybody.
[02:04:21.324 --> 02:04:24.266]  And if you don't have it, your body can't make the hormones.
[02:04:24.266 --> 02:04:27.768]  So it's seen as a steroid precursor, but it's seen as legal, safe, and everything.
[02:04:27.768 --> 02:04:29.650]  And I learned about this years ago from a medical doctor.
[02:04:29.650 --> 02:04:30.790]  He said, you want to lose weight?
[02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:31.891]  Take Preglanone.
[02:04:31.891 --> 02:04:37.815]  So I just said, why don't the ultimate formula, Preglanone, with the vitamins and minerals, the amino acids, with the Preglanone.
[02:04:37.815 --> 02:04:39.176]  And so that's what you get with real Red Pill.
[02:04:39.176 --> 02:04:43.599]  Now we have Red Pill Plus, if you want that, that has energy added to it as well.
[02:04:43.599 --> 02:04:47.061]  It's not as strong as Brain Force Plus, but there you go.
[02:04:47.061 --> 02:04:49.623]  All right, I promise, we're going to your phone calls straight ahead.
[02:04:49.623 --> 02:04:51.084]  Roger Stone is in the cockpit.
[02:04:51.124 --> 02:04:56.407]  Yeah.
[02:04:56.407 --> 02:04:58.749]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[02:06:08.847 --> 02:06:11.448]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:11.448 --> 02:06:12.968]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:12.968 --> 02:06:22.891]  All right, Roger Stone is riding shotgun with us, right through into the next hour.
[02:06:22.891 --> 02:06:25.111]  And then I told him, he got up at 5 a.m.
[02:06:25.111 --> 02:06:32.413]  yesterday, he flew to Texas, did like six, seven hours with us, then went and did Laura Ingraham at, you know, 9, 10 o'clock at night.
[02:06:32.413 --> 02:06:35.574]  Tonight he's on Tucker Carlson, one of my smartest guys out there.
[02:06:36.794 --> 02:06:41.438]  And so I told him, hey, you know, go go take a nap today before this.
[02:06:41.438 --> 02:06:44.361]  He said, no, I got brain force.
[02:06:44.361 --> 02:06:47.363]  So I guess he'd forgotten to take some that morning or hadn't flown with it.
[02:06:47.363 --> 02:06:48.224]  We had plenty of it here.
[02:06:48.224 --> 02:06:49.625]  You said a big plug for it.
[02:06:49.625 --> 02:06:56.671]  It's 50 percent off right now because I want you to try to have it tried for the price because you can get similar stuff at 60, 70, 80 dollars.
[02:06:58.152 --> 02:06:59.653]  You cannot get a better nootropic.
[02:06:59.653 --> 02:07:01.974]  It's clean, it's good, it's amazing.
[02:07:01.974 --> 02:07:04.615]  Some of the stuff in it, they're trying to restrict in Europe.
[02:07:04.615 --> 02:07:05.816]  It is really amazing.
[02:07:05.816 --> 02:07:09.157]  It's $19.95 right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:09.157 --> 02:07:11.578]  Almost 6,000 five-star reviews.
[02:07:11.578 --> 02:07:17.901]  Real Red Pill Plus goes with it great as well, or the regular Red Pill, the Real Red Pill.
[02:07:17.901 --> 02:07:20.042]  It's all there at infowarestore.com.
[02:07:20.042 --> 02:07:20.843]  We have free shipping.
[02:07:22.536 --> 02:07:26.999]  And 50% off all of our best-selling products, but it's got to end Sunday or Monday.
[02:07:26.999 --> 02:07:28.580]  In fact, I've got it in the X2.
[02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:29.341]  That's 50% off.
[02:07:29.341 --> 02:07:30.121]  We've never done that.
[02:07:30.121 --> 02:07:31.742]  But I want people, again, to get off the fence.
[02:07:31.742 --> 02:07:44.211]  Even though X2 is close to selling out, even though we still up the wire have not secured another source of the pure iodine that they get in these oil rigs at between 7,000 and 12,000 feet, it's very hard to get.
[02:07:44.211 --> 02:07:49.214]  You have to go to the DEA and get certification to even get it because it's a precursor for methamphetamine.
[02:07:49.214 --> 02:07:50.555]  It does not have the methamphetamine effect.
[02:07:51.295 --> 02:07:57.820]  That's totally legal, but pure atomic iodine that's not bound is what they use to make a bunch of drugs.
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:07:59.962]  I guess LSD, methamphetamine, you name it.
[02:07:59.962 --> 02:08:02.204]  It's one of the precursors.
[02:08:02.204 --> 02:08:04.546]  And so it's highly controlled.
[02:08:04.546 --> 02:08:09.150]  It's even got to be in a big locked up facility inside the manufacturing facility.
[02:08:09.150 --> 02:08:11.211]  Everything's certified.
[02:08:11.211 --> 02:08:13.713]  And so the oil companies are weird about selling it to you.
[02:08:13.713 --> 02:08:16.776]  And again, we just lucked into this because we had a seaweed source.
[02:08:17.998 --> 02:08:23.102]  That was the cleanest you'd get, but it was still bound with the stuff that's in the ocean.
[02:08:23.102 --> 02:08:29.468]  There was different types of iodine, but it's always sodium iodine, calcium iodine, this iodine.
[02:08:29.468 --> 02:08:35.453]  I mean, there's a whole bunch of different types, but it's bound, and it doesn't get absorbed, and it also doesn't hurt your stomach.
[02:08:35.453 --> 02:08:39.336]  This is 9-9-9-9-9-9-9.
[02:08:39.336 --> 02:08:40.537]  It's essentially atomic.
[02:08:40.537 --> 02:08:42.558]  That doesn't mean radioactive.
[02:08:42.558 --> 02:08:44.140]  There are 6,000 plus five-star reviews.
[02:08:45.689 --> 02:08:47.370]  It means it's on the periodic table.
[02:08:47.370 --> 02:08:47.950]  It is.
[02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:51.472]  It's like when BuzzFeed had it tested by Mark Cuban's company.
[02:08:51.472 --> 02:08:52.332]  They said, it's weird.
[02:08:52.332 --> 02:08:54.953]  It's not all these different types we've all heard of.
[02:08:54.953 --> 02:08:58.995]  You know, you take this for nuclear war, you take that or, you know, you take it.
[02:08:58.995 --> 02:09:02.056]  No, it's, it's, it's pure iodine.
[02:09:02.056 --> 02:09:03.897]  Oh, yes.
[02:09:03.897 --> 02:09:05.978]  It's the only one they've ever tested.
[02:09:05.978 --> 02:09:07.379]  It's pure iodine.
[02:09:08.612 --> 02:09:09.233]  Look at it.
[02:09:09.233 --> 02:09:10.874]  It's purple crystals.
[02:09:10.874 --> 02:09:17.781]  If you put it on the ground above 89 degrees, it turns into like I Dream of Jeannie purple gas.
[02:09:17.781 --> 02:09:19.282]  It eats holes in concrete.
[02:09:19.282 --> 02:09:24.467]  Now, it doesn't eat your body because it's put into a gaseous form and injected into the palm oil.
[02:09:26.181 --> 02:09:32.703]  All I know is, it makes me really a bum, because working out super hard, I couldn't lose weight, and I hardly even work out anymore, even though I should.
[02:09:32.703 --> 02:09:37.324]  I'm way less than I did 10 years ago, and I'm telling you, the X2 changed my life.
[02:09:37.324 --> 02:09:39.045]  Okay, we're going to your phone calls.
[02:09:39.045 --> 02:09:46.267]  We've got Tommy Robinson, spokesperson, popping in as well with an update, and it just gets worse and worse.
[02:09:46.267 --> 02:09:49.427]  A political prisoner, and we got Manafort sent as a political prisoner today.
[02:09:49.427 --> 02:09:53.529]  You've got Tommy moved to the Muslim wing of the prison, 70% Muslim, 70 plus percent.
[02:09:56.523 --> 02:09:58.166]  First, the media tried to deny this had even happened.
[02:09:58.166 --> 02:09:59.668]  Now it's all over the British news.
[02:09:59.668 --> 02:10:07.340]  Again, the only reason it's in the British news is because we reported it and Drudge linked to it two days ago and kept it at the top for two days until the media was forced to report it.
[02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:10.085]  Instead, the media was saying we'd made it up for the first two days.
[02:10:10.085 --> 02:10:11.367]  That's why we're so critical, Roger.
[02:10:13.297 --> 02:10:16.258]  This is a story that is hard to understand.
[02:10:16.258 --> 02:10:21.160]  Here you have the United Kingdom, the seat of American jurisprudence.
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:21.981]  The fount.
[02:10:21.981 --> 02:10:22.781]  The fount.
[02:10:22.781 --> 02:10:24.522]  The Magna Carta.
[02:10:24.522 --> 02:10:31.665]  And this kind of harassment, this kind of... I don't know.
[02:10:31.665 --> 02:10:32.785]  It's totalitarianism.
[02:10:32.785 --> 02:10:34.406]  It's Nazism.
[02:10:34.406 --> 02:10:37.948]  They're going to destroy and kill this man because he stands up for freedom.
[02:10:37.948 --> 02:10:38.628]  It's unbelievable.
[02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:43.718]  It's just hard to fathom that this could be happening in a civilized country.
[02:10:43.718 --> 02:10:46.041]  I mean, I was setting up info wars with him.
[02:10:46.041 --> 02:10:46.942]  We're still trying to do it.
[02:10:47.839 --> 02:10:48.579]  Over there.
[02:10:48.579 --> 02:10:52.240]  And he told me, if I go to jail, Kalen is who you talk to.
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:53.200]  He's my spokesperson.
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:54.480]  I keep my wife out of this.
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:56.061]  Then we have Kalen on.
[02:10:56.061 --> 02:10:59.401]  People are like, oh, that's not really a spokesman.
[02:10:59.401 --> 02:11:01.602]  Remember the first three days, he's not even in jail.
[02:11:01.602 --> 02:11:02.622]  This is made up.
[02:11:02.622 --> 02:11:04.222]  That's a media tactic when it's hot.
[02:11:04.222 --> 02:11:06.343]  Oh, Tommy Robinson didn't get arrested.
[02:11:06.343 --> 02:11:07.463]  He hasn't been sent anywhere.
[02:11:07.463 --> 02:11:09.023]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[02:11:09.023 --> 02:11:10.204]  They play these mind games.
[02:11:10.204 --> 02:11:12.904]  Like, oh, we were never spying on Trump.
[02:11:12.904 --> 02:11:13.604]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:13.604 --> 02:11:15.705]  We're going to go to some phone calls, but
[02:11:17.053 --> 02:11:19.355]  I usually plug like once an hour for 60 seconds.
[02:11:19.355 --> 02:11:20.496]  We need to raise money.
[02:11:20.496 --> 02:11:23.978]  We got great products you need and we've got legal defense funds.
[02:11:23.978 --> 02:11:29.522]  Tell people, there's a lot of URLs that go to the same place, but there's a lot of folks out there claiming they're raising money for you who aren't, Roger.
[02:11:29.522 --> 02:11:32.404]  They can go to alexjoneslegalfund.com.
[02:11:32.404 --> 02:11:34.025]  There's a link to your legal fund on there.
[02:11:34.905 --> 02:11:36.906]  Or, how do folks go directly to your legal fund?
[02:11:36.906 --> 02:11:38.507]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:11:38.507 --> 02:11:41.028]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:11:41.028 --> 02:11:47.650]  Now, Alex, my grandson, Nick Stephens, asked me if he could set up a GoFundMe for me, because he sees what I'm going through.
[02:11:47.650 --> 02:11:48.891]  And I said, sure.
[02:11:48.891 --> 02:11:54.493]  He was immediately ridiculed by BuzzFeed, by Media 8, because he loves his grandfather.
[02:11:54.493 --> 02:11:57.694]  Because he doesn't like what's happening to our family.
[02:11:57.694 --> 02:11:58.615]  It is outrageous.
[02:11:58.615 --> 02:12:00.276]  So, StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:12:01.596 --> 02:12:03.137]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:12:03.137 --> 02:12:06.941]  We haven't even made a deal out of this, because this will be national news.
[02:12:06.941 --> 02:12:09.423]  We've gone to three of the big fund me groups.
[02:12:09.423 --> 02:12:14.087]  Before we even set it up, and they see who it is, they say you violate our terms and we're banned.
[02:12:14.087 --> 02:12:28.819]  So again, they won't even let us go out, just like Obama targeted more than 10,000 Christian charities and had them banned or attacked by the IRS, Patriot groups, veterans groups, gun groups, all attacked, all shut down, all had their 501c3 or other forms stripped.
[02:12:29.659 --> 02:12:32.282]  And the media said, oh good, they deserve it to the Tea Party.
[02:12:32.282 --> 02:12:36.506]  Now they won't even let me go online and fund money.
[02:12:36.506 --> 02:12:42.331]  They won't even let me go out and start a GoFundMe or any other platform out there.
[02:12:42.331 --> 02:12:45.775]  This is like putting the Jews in the ghettos first.
[02:12:45.775 --> 02:12:48.097]  I know what my legal bills are like.
[02:12:48.097 --> 02:12:53.002]  I can't even imagine what yours are like, given the various jurisdictions where they're trying to take you down.
[02:12:53.562 --> 02:12:59.247]  I mean, this can run to millions of dollars to save InfoWars and save your reputation.
[02:12:59.247 --> 02:13:01.309]  And they're well-heeled, make no mistake about it.
[02:13:01.309 --> 02:13:02.430]  They have plenty of money.
[02:13:02.430 --> 02:13:07.455]  I don't want to give too much of the strategy away, but I was expecting this to happen for a long time.
[02:13:07.455 --> 02:13:08.476]  Now, I didn't expect them to fall 20.
[02:13:08.476 --> 02:13:11.398]  The good news is 10 have been thrown out.
[02:13:11.398 --> 02:13:14.962]  Throwing the 10 out has cost about
[02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:20.022]  $370,000 last time I checked a few weeks ago.
[02:13:20.022 --> 02:13:20.783]  Here's the problem.
[02:13:20.783 --> 02:13:24.545]  Those were all the overly ridiculous, I mean, cuckoo land.
[02:13:24.545 --> 02:13:29.868]  Now the others are still BS, but they're much more serious where individual ones will cost that much.
[02:13:29.868 --> 02:13:32.169]  So they want to cripple us so we don't do the expansion.
[02:13:32.169 --> 02:13:34.530]  And then they want to start squeezing us.
[02:13:34.530 --> 02:13:37.892]  So for a while, again, I didn't have the private jet.
[02:13:37.892 --> 02:13:40.013]  A lot of times I fly coach.
[02:13:40.013 --> 02:13:41.294]  I nested things away.
[02:13:44.312 --> 02:13:45.113]  Which is one issue.
[02:13:45.113 --> 02:13:46.934]  I'm not going to get into it.
[02:13:46.934 --> 02:13:47.914]  So we could deal with this.
[02:13:47.914 --> 02:13:51.677]  So we have emergency fuel to make the jump level.
[02:13:51.677 --> 02:13:54.399]  So when we go in, we're going in full throttle against them.
[02:13:54.399 --> 02:13:56.540]  It's just that I can project out.
[02:13:56.540 --> 02:14:01.523]  And so we need to start gaining fuel for the next move after that.
[02:14:01.523 --> 02:14:07.407]  And I've got a few aces up my sleeve, but it'll really encourage us if people just flood us with money.
[02:14:07.407 --> 02:14:07.788]  Go ahead.
[02:14:07.788 --> 02:14:09.129]  You know what's really insidious?
[02:14:09.129 --> 02:14:11.390]  Somebody goes up and puts up a line.
[02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:11.970]  You can find it.
[02:14:11.970 --> 02:14:13.371]  Roger Stone is worth $20 million.
[02:14:14.432 --> 02:14:15.073]  No, I'm not.
[02:14:15.073 --> 02:14:15.854]  Not even close.
[02:14:15.854 --> 02:14:17.275]  I'm not a millionaire.
[02:14:17.275 --> 02:14:18.977]  They say they do the same lies to me.
[02:14:18.977 --> 02:14:20.819]  They do that so people don't give us.
[02:14:20.819 --> 02:14:22.261]  Why should I send you money, Stone?
[02:14:22.261 --> 02:14:23.062]  You're a millionaire.
[02:14:23.062 --> 02:14:24.003]  No, I'm not.
[02:14:24.003 --> 02:14:28.248]  That's disinformation that is meant to discourage people from donating.
[02:14:28.248 --> 02:14:29.429]  Don't believe it, folks.
[02:14:29.429 --> 02:14:30.010]  It's BS.
[02:14:30.330 --> 02:14:37.354]  Well, I mean, I am a multi-millionaire on the taxes, because I don't do this offshore stuff like all the big globalists do, because they wouldn't let me.
[02:14:37.354 --> 02:14:38.755]  Only globalists get to do that.
[02:14:38.755 --> 02:14:45.138]  The equipment in this building, and what I have to pay on income tax, I have to pay on state, they really have an income tax in Texas.
[02:14:45.138 --> 02:14:48.680]  It's this franchise tax, and they've got like an equipment tax.
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:52.382]  I have to, whatever's in the warehouse at the end of the year, I've got to pay for every piece of equipment, everything.
[02:14:52.382 --> 02:14:54.743]  And Obama got rid of a bunch of the write-offs.
[02:14:54.743 --> 02:14:57.105]  So, I'm supposedly worth
[02:14:58.351 --> 02:15:00.772]  Four million dollars because of the equipment here.
[02:15:00.772 --> 02:15:04.433]  Well, I couldn't sell this equipment for a million dollars now, the way it depreciates.
[02:15:04.433 --> 02:15:06.174]  But yeah, it's four million dollars worth of equipment.
[02:15:06.174 --> 02:15:07.615]  That's what real equipment costs.
[02:15:07.615 --> 02:15:09.855]  One real big board costs a couple hundred thousand dollars.
[02:15:09.855 --> 02:15:11.796]  Well, we can't run InfoWars without it.
[02:15:11.796 --> 02:15:12.737]  But that's what I'm saying.
[02:15:12.737 --> 02:15:13.457]  So on paper,
[02:15:16.249 --> 02:15:16.989]  It's insane.
[02:15:16.989 --> 02:15:18.370]  And I'm trying to get accountants involved.
[02:15:18.370 --> 02:15:20.190]  It just drives me completely insane.
[02:15:20.190 --> 02:15:21.330]  So that's what I'm saying.
[02:15:21.330 --> 02:15:22.470]  Absolutely.
[02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:24.731]  What I'm after is winning against the globalists.
[02:15:24.731 --> 02:15:27.532]  And I want capital and money to get more reporters, more crew.
[02:15:27.532 --> 02:15:28.312]  Look how great Owen is.
[02:15:28.312 --> 02:15:28.852]  Look at the other people.
[02:15:28.852 --> 02:15:31.833]  All right, we're going to come back right to your phone calls, I promise.

[02:20:09.215 --> 02:20:10.917]  Big Brother.
[02:20:10.917 --> 02:20:13.159]  Mainstream media.
[02:20:13.159 --> 02:20:15.021]  Government cover-ups.
[02:20:15.021 --> 02:20:17.102]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:20:17.102 --> 02:20:19.265]  Well, so does he.
[02:20:19.265 --> 02:20:25.550]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:32.717]  Alright, I am taking over the fourth hour today to take your phone calls.
[02:20:32.717 --> 02:20:34.159]  I was going to go directly to them right now, but
[02:20:36.348 --> 02:20:41.774]  Tommy Robinson's spokesman, he's a come on earlier, he's in the street in London, big developments, Kalen Robertson.
[02:20:41.774 --> 02:20:51.685]  So we're going to talk to him for this segment, a little bit of the next, and I promise we're going to take like 20 year phone calls with Roger Stone about how's Trump doing, what do you make of the IG report, North Korea.
[02:20:53.161 --> 02:20:55.603]  I mean, are we thankful for how things have turned around?
[02:20:55.603 --> 02:20:56.604]  I know I sure am.
[02:20:56.604 --> 02:20:58.266]  I wasn't just a negative person before.
[02:20:58.266 --> 02:20:59.787]  I didn't like what the globals were doing.
[02:20:59.787 --> 02:21:00.989]  We're taking the country back.
[02:21:00.989 --> 02:21:02.690]  History's happening.
[02:21:02.690 --> 02:21:05.152]  And we're such an instant gratification society.
[02:21:05.152 --> 02:21:08.756]  Even a lot of Trump supporters I know are like, well, he's the guy we needed.
[02:21:08.756 --> 02:21:09.917]  He's a wrecking ball.
[02:21:09.917 --> 02:21:11.458]  He's not perfect.
[02:21:11.458 --> 02:21:11.819]  You know, man.
[02:21:13.627 --> 02:21:27.751]  I've sacrificed a lot, but nothing like Tommy Robinson, a political prisoner, who they now admit was moved into a Muslim wing, and who they are, he's been, who they are saying they're gonna kill him, and there is an imam putting a Fatwa out, and only Drudge picked this up two days ago.
[02:21:27.751 --> 02:21:34.253]  Three days ago, the media was saying, I made it up, Roger, and it really frustrates me that they're like this.
[02:21:34.253 --> 02:21:41.875]  We broke, that Hillary's server was broken into, from international intelligence sources, and Colonel Schaefer, in January of 2016.
[02:21:44.261 --> 02:21:47.602]  That's why they hate us, because we are so truthful, Roger.
[02:21:47.602 --> 02:21:48.683]  It's extraordinary.
[02:21:48.683 --> 02:21:53.344]  You can expect this to be happening in a Muslim country, in a Middle Eastern country.
[02:21:53.344 --> 02:21:57.165]  That it's happening in the UK just boggles the mind.
[02:21:57.165 --> 02:22:05.008]  And the silence of the national media, of the mainstream media, with the exception of Drudge, it's extraordinary.
[02:22:05.008 --> 02:22:08.289]  Without Drudge, you wouldn't even know that I was banned on YouTube.
[02:22:08.289 --> 02:22:12.571]  Then when they reinstated us, Bloomberg said it was a mutiny someone did without authorization.
[02:22:13.551 --> 02:22:15.213]  How sensational is that?
[02:22:15.213 --> 02:22:17.455]  I don't mean to kiss Drudge's butt, it's true.
[02:22:17.455 --> 02:22:22.779]  Without Drudge, he's the guy that continues to be the final domino to break open the wall.
[02:22:22.779 --> 02:22:24.461]  He does have enormous reach.
[02:22:24.461 --> 02:22:29.925]  It reminds me of when they said, oh no, we didn't turn off Sean Hannity's Twitter feed.
[02:22:29.925 --> 02:22:34.169]  Some guy spilled Coca-Cola on the control board.
[02:22:34.169 --> 02:22:35.170]  It was all a mistake.
[02:22:35.170 --> 02:22:37.932]  And what they're doing is testing it to get us just worn out of hearing about it.
[02:22:38.152 --> 02:22:39.633]  Until they finally ban you or Milo.
[02:22:39.633 --> 02:22:41.595]  Let's go for this segment and then part of the next.
[02:22:41.595 --> 02:22:46.119]  We're going right to calls to Kalen Robertson.
[02:22:46.119 --> 02:22:49.362]  And he joins us right now on the street.
[02:22:49.362 --> 02:22:52.344]  Again, he had the bravery to go on the air when no one else would.
[02:22:52.344 --> 02:22:53.385]  He's Tommy's spokesperson.
[02:22:53.385 --> 02:22:56.588]  Tommy told me that directly before he even went to jail about a week before.
[02:22:56.588 --> 02:23:01.011]  Tommy is fighting for his life right now in the Muslim wing.
[02:23:01.011 --> 02:23:03.534]  The media spins it and goes, well, it's a Muslim wing.
[02:23:03.534 --> 02:23:05.255]  The whole prison is at 70 percent.
[02:23:05.255 --> 02:23:06.056]  Only that wing.
[02:23:06.536 --> 02:23:14.239]  So they've picked an Islamic prison with a Muslim wing to throw in Tommy Robinson, and he's got new developments for us.
[02:23:14.239 --> 02:23:17.600]  Caelan, thank you for joining us and giving us updates.
[02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:23.242]  It's good to see his lawyers coming out and confirming everything you said a day after you said it.
[02:23:23.242 --> 02:23:26.323]  Yeah, thanks so much for having us as well, and thank you so much for covering all of this stuff.
[02:23:26.323 --> 02:23:27.764]  Sorry, it's just very busy in London.
[02:23:27.764 --> 02:23:30.305]  We're trying to do this period really quickly right now.
[02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:36.222]  News reports that you've just been talking about, completely insane.
[02:23:36.222 --> 02:23:40.206]  They said that it was 70% made up, nothing out of nowhere.
[02:23:40.206 --> 02:23:43.329]  Tommy told us directly that it looked like that.
[02:23:43.329 --> 02:23:44.871]  It looked about 70% on his wing.
[02:23:44.871 --> 02:23:47.173]  And they were saying, oh, well, there's no such thing as a 70% list.
[02:23:47.173 --> 02:23:48.954]  And so the whole thing's nonsense.
[02:23:48.954 --> 02:23:56.341]  But they're using their usual tactics to try to discredit everything that we're doing and to try to discredit all the facts and try and brush it all over and say that nothing is actually wrong.
[02:23:57.583 --> 02:24:01.207]  Obviously, reiterating our phone call a couple of days ago, the facts are still the same.
[02:24:01.207 --> 02:24:04.911]  We have had a little bit of communication since then and he still is okay.
[02:24:04.911 --> 02:24:07.494]  However, I can reconfirm everything we spoke about the other night.
[02:24:07.494 --> 02:24:10.818]  He was moved to a really dangerous prison.
[02:24:10.818 --> 02:24:12.660]  It was really bad.
[02:24:12.660 --> 02:24:14.322]  It has a much higher Muslim population.
[02:24:14.322 --> 02:24:16.665]  It's actually got a record of having
[02:24:22.270 --> 02:24:30.738]  He's actually just been moved to solitary confinement and he's sort of in a room with a blue mat on the floor, completely bizarre.
[02:24:30.738 --> 02:24:37.024]  So we know that at least he's safe in that period for now, but because he's in that situation, it means that communication is going to be a little bit more difficult.
[02:24:37.584 --> 02:24:38.485]  In the meantime.
[02:24:38.485 --> 02:24:41.867]  So we don't know if he's going to be immediately put back into that really dangerous wing.
[02:24:41.867 --> 02:24:45.809]  We don't know if he's going to be shoved to another prison that's even more dangerous.
[02:24:45.809 --> 02:24:47.530]  Those threats have been passed on to him.
[02:24:47.530 --> 02:24:50.652]  But what we do know is obviously that he's been moved there.
[02:24:50.652 --> 02:24:52.493]  He's been moved to a more dangerous situation.
[02:24:52.493 --> 02:24:53.614]  It wasn't by the governors.
[02:24:53.614 --> 02:24:54.915]  It wasn't by the prison guards.
[02:24:54.915 --> 02:24:58.337]  It wasn't by any usual process that normally takes place in a prison like this.
[02:24:58.337 --> 02:25:02.219]  It was sent down straight from the top, from the Home Office.
[02:25:02.219 --> 02:25:03.080]  Completely unprecedented.
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:03.380]  Thank you.
[02:25:19.898 --> 02:25:22.039]  And that's the bombshell news.
[02:25:22.039 --> 02:25:23.679]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:25:23.679 --> 02:25:25.740]  Thank God drugs linked to it last night.
[02:25:25.740 --> 02:25:30.761]  Order to send Tommy Robinson to heavily Muslim populated prison came from the top activist.
[02:25:30.761 --> 02:25:36.243]  Safety in danger as a result of high risk status being removed from his file.
[02:25:36.243 --> 02:25:41.364]  And now you say that they've thrown him back in solitary confinement, which is more cruel and unusual punishment.
[02:25:41.824 --> 02:25:47.407]  For reporting that there was a trial on Muslim grooming gangs, which even the media reported on.
[02:25:47.407 --> 02:25:59.454]  They said he reported on the trial itself, and so 13 months in the Islamic wing, a certain death sentence, or 13 months in solitary confinement, silencing him, being able to talk to you every few days.
[02:25:59.454 --> 02:26:05.058]  So I guess you haven't been able to talk to him since you talked to him on Tuesday and gave us that emergency message.
[02:26:06.414 --> 02:26:10.457]  No, it seemed like they really weren't happy about that information going out, and they seemed to cut off a lot of things.
[02:26:10.457 --> 02:26:18.121]  We have had some communication, but not directly between him and I, that he is actually still safe and he's okay, but they're really clamping down on the information that's coming out.
[02:26:18.121 --> 02:26:19.742]  He doesn't want him talking to the outside world.
[02:26:19.742 --> 02:26:21.924]  He doesn't want any... They don't want any fuss being made.
[02:26:21.924 --> 02:26:23.365]  They don't want you doing what you're doing.
[02:26:23.365 --> 02:26:25.366]  They don't want Judge putting it on the front page.
[02:26:25.366 --> 02:26:26.707]  They want it to be a nothing-burger.
[02:26:26.707 --> 02:26:30.029]  They tried to silence it as soon as he got into prison prison, as we know, but that didn't work.
[02:26:30.851 --> 02:26:35.594]  And now they're trying to say that it's all nonsense because the statistics are slightly off, but that's what they're trying to do.
[02:26:35.594 --> 02:26:41.937]  So they don't want any information coming out about him because it builds up a frenzy, it gets people upset, it gets people rightly.
[02:26:41.937 --> 02:26:52.143]  And so the next stages are basically going through the legal process, that's what we're doing now, and doing everything we can to make sure that he's not in that situation, that he can have communication to the outside world, because he wants this information to get out.
[02:26:52.143 --> 02:26:56.305]  He told me directly on Tuesday the facts that he told me he wants it out immediately, as fast as possible, because
[02:26:56.305 --> 02:27:01.462]  Because if anything does happen to him, and he's at massive risk, he wants the world to know exactly what's going on.
[02:27:01.462 --> 02:27:02.827]  And he knows people are listening.
[02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:14.802]  And again, when he first got arrested, for three days there was a D-notice where the media couldn't report he was arrested, and they had news saying, I made that up and you made that up.
[02:27:14.802 --> 02:27:16.183]  Then they confirmed that.
[02:27:16.183 --> 02:27:18.723]  Then they had an order not to cover the demonstrations.
[02:27:18.723 --> 02:27:22.444]  I mean, this is so authoritarian what the UK is becoming.
[02:27:22.444 --> 02:27:25.225]  And now Roger and I are talking about being political prisoners.
[02:27:25.225 --> 02:27:26.245]  We're under attack.
[02:27:26.245 --> 02:27:29.146]  Paul Manafort has been grabbed and put in jail today.
[02:27:29.146 --> 02:27:30.846]  I mean, this is really wild.
[02:27:32.686 --> 02:27:34.827]  Oh, people don't seem to realise that it's going to happen to them next.
[02:27:34.827 --> 02:27:35.248]  It's bizarre.
[02:27:35.248 --> 02:27:39.470]  Because it's Tommy and because he's perceived as extreme, they say, oh, of course he's getting thrown away.
[02:27:39.470 --> 02:27:40.811]  He looks a little bit rough, doesn't he?
[02:27:40.811 --> 02:27:42.292]  He looks like he'd be capable of that.
[02:27:42.292 --> 02:27:44.513]  But after Tommy, it's going to come for you.
[02:27:44.513 --> 02:27:45.734]  It's going to come for everybody else.
[02:27:45.734 --> 02:27:46.855]  It's going to come for people in the middle.
[02:27:46.855 --> 02:27:53.419]  It's going to come from anyone who's even slightly dissident and who has said anything even slightly against the government or the PC polities or anything that's
[02:27:56.800 --> 02:28:00.702]  Let's talk about what we can do and just what's happening in the UK when we come back.
[02:28:00.702 --> 02:28:01.262]  Go ahead.
[02:28:01.262 --> 02:28:01.903]  We need to pray.
[02:28:26.616 --> 02:28:29.017]  We need to lift Tommy Robinson up with prayer.
[02:28:29.017 --> 02:28:30.118]  All the Infowarriors.
[02:28:30.118 --> 02:28:31.819]  We need to be praying for his safety right now.
[02:28:31.819 --> 02:28:33.039]  Let's pray for him when we come back.
[02:28:33.039 --> 02:28:33.900]  I think it's important.
[02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:34.400]  Absolutely.
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:36.501]  Prayer is number one, folks.
[02:28:36.501 --> 02:28:38.462]  It's absolutely numero uno.
[02:28:38.462 --> 02:28:39.683]  We talked about it just the other day.
[02:28:39.683 --> 02:28:40.103]  It's true.
[02:28:40.103 --> 02:28:42.825]  There are no atheists in foxholes.
[02:28:42.825 --> 02:28:43.825]  And my head is spinning.
[02:28:43.825 --> 02:28:45.966]  And we're going to all your phone calls.
[02:28:45.966 --> 02:28:48.227]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:48.227 --> 02:28:48.968]  Wow.
[02:28:48.968 --> 02:28:51.669]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails.
[02:28:51.669 --> 02:28:54.711]  And those that cry the peas of peas are hung by those they tried to please.
[02:28:55.091 --> 02:28:58.773]  We call it the crapper, water closet, outhouse or bathroom.
[02:28:58.773 --> 02:29:01.254]  But where do you go when there's nowhere to go?
[02:29:01.254 --> 02:29:03.475]  The answer is the Biffy Bag.

[02:30:02.219 --> 02:30:03.660]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:30:03.660 --> 02:30:07.344]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:30:07.344 --> 02:30:16.012]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[02:30:16.052 --> 02:30:32.323]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[02:30:32.803 --> 02:30:41.392]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:30:41.392 --> 02:30:46.297]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:30:46.297 --> 02:30:51.963]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1775th Worldwide.

[02:32:59.240 --> 02:33:01.881]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.862 --> 02:33:33.127]  Well, Manafort is a political prisoner, and you notice they've charged him with obstruction, with weapons tampering.
[02:33:33.127 --> 02:33:36.329]  So there's no Russiagate, that's all falling apart, the judges admit that.
[02:33:36.329 --> 02:33:37.090]  So now, oh!
[02:33:38.098 --> 02:33:42.201]  Oh, and there's no, uh, you actually laundering money, that's not true.
[02:33:42.201 --> 02:33:45.323]  But, we're gonna get you like Martha Stewart.
[02:33:45.323 --> 02:33:50.247]  You did an insider trade, but we say you lied to federal agents, the same type.
[02:33:50.247 --> 02:33:52.708]  Well, it was actually, it was actually Comey.
[02:33:52.708 --> 02:33:58.232]  It was actually, uh, you know, the same FBI, it was actually Mueller that went after her.
[02:33:58.232 --> 02:34:03.536]  So, again, you've got these crooks at the top that don't go after real gangsters, they go after Martha Stewart.
[02:34:04.565 --> 02:34:06.027]  We're Paul Manafort.
[02:34:06.027 --> 02:34:10.272]  And then, when there's nothing and their trial's falling apart... Oh!
[02:34:10.272 --> 02:34:11.774]  We've got a new charge!
[02:34:11.774 --> 02:34:13.496]  You're obstructing justice.
[02:34:13.496 --> 02:34:14.558]  When they want to avoid...
[02:34:15.834 --> 02:34:17.496]  Revealing what they know and discover.
[02:34:17.496 --> 02:34:24.964]  You see, they just don't want you to know what the evidence is against you, which is fundamentally against our American system.
[02:34:24.964 --> 02:34:27.486]  You're allowed to know what the charges are, what the evidence is.
[02:34:27.486 --> 02:34:29.869]  And now Trump has tweeted about it, this just in.
[02:34:29.869 --> 02:34:36.115]  President Trump, wow, what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort, who has represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole,
[02:34:36.656 --> 02:34:37.657]  Just like you did.
[02:34:37.657 --> 02:34:42.401]  And many other top people and campaigns didn't know Manafort was the head of the mob.
[02:34:42.401 --> 02:34:45.604]  What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all of the others?
[02:34:45.604 --> 02:34:48.166]  Very unfair.
[02:34:48.166 --> 02:34:57.094]  And that's why Trump goes on to say the left is weaponizing our institutions against anyone they deem evil.
[02:34:57.094 --> 02:34:59.577]  Drain the swamp.
[02:34:59.577 --> 02:35:00.698]  Absolutely.
[02:35:00.698 --> 02:35:01.839]  And let's go back.
[02:35:03.322 --> 02:35:10.766]  Let's go back to the spokesperson for Tommy Robinson, Kalen Robertson.
[02:35:10.766 --> 02:35:13.967]  Kalen, we're seeing military tactics here.
[02:35:13.967 --> 02:35:17.109]  And everybody should follow you on Twitter to get the updates.
[02:35:17.109 --> 02:35:18.769]  You're the only guy that has the courage to speak.
[02:35:18.769 --> 02:35:20.270]  That's why Tommy chose you to do that.
[02:35:20.270 --> 02:35:22.311]  We're honored.
[02:35:22.311 --> 02:35:22.831]  There you are.
[02:35:22.831 --> 02:35:30.215]  Everybody should follow you at Kalen Rob on Twitter so they can actually get the unvarnished, unfiltered information from Tommy.
[02:35:31.733 --> 02:35:33.216]  Who has a FATOA out on him.
[02:35:33.216 --> 02:35:36.241]  Let's talk about that EMOM drugs link to that story yesterday.
[02:35:36.241 --> 02:35:43.272]  Let's give us the latest on that and then talk about how folks can support Tommy because we're not going to let people forget about him.
[02:35:43.272 --> 02:35:44.173]  That's what they hope happens.
[02:35:46.022 --> 02:35:51.605]  Yeah, I think they got a little bit lost in translation on Tuesday, but seriously, that story is actually completely significant.
[02:35:51.605 --> 02:36:01.209]  So, when Tommy arrived, he realised that the head imam of that prison had known about his arrival two days before he got there.
[02:36:01.209 --> 02:36:04.331]  Now, none of the prison guards knew, and then none of the governors knew.
[02:36:04.331 --> 02:36:08.253]  None of the governors in the previous prison knew, or the previous prison guards knew.
[02:36:08.253 --> 02:36:12.615]  Nobody knew about his move, except for the imam of that prison.
[02:36:12.615 --> 02:36:13.515]  That doesn't make any sense.
[02:36:13.775 --> 02:36:17.739]  And that's what was such a massive story about this, because the orders came from the top.
[02:36:17.739 --> 02:36:20.441]  And the Imam knew about it, which doesn't make any sense.
[02:36:20.441 --> 02:36:28.328]  And so he was going around telling everybody two days before that he was going to be arriving, which Tommy said gives them enough time to prepare weapons.
[02:36:28.328 --> 02:36:34.533]  That's an old prison tactic to tell a certain profile, whether it's a gangster or someone from a rival gang that's about to arrive.
[02:36:34.873 --> 02:36:35.353]  We're good to go.
[02:36:56.846 --> 02:36:59.207]  Much above the governors who knew about it.
[02:36:59.207 --> 02:37:00.167]  It doesn't really make any sense.
[02:37:00.167 --> 02:37:01.567]  And that's what's so shocking about it.
[02:37:01.567 --> 02:37:07.328]  Obviously, it's somebody who's been colluding with the high-profile Imams of Muslim of Britain.
[02:37:07.328 --> 02:37:08.728]  That's what it looks like the situation is.
[02:37:08.728 --> 02:37:17.330]  It's someone who's colluding, who knows information that the rest of us seem not to, who's passed down the orders, or who knows the person who's passed down the orders to have him moved on.
[02:37:17.330 --> 02:37:18.850]  It's completely bizarre.
[02:37:18.850 --> 02:37:23.451]  But you know, I don't normally divulge into conspiracy theories, but there is no other reasonable
[02:37:24.031 --> 02:37:24.191]  I don't
[02:37:39.295 --> 02:37:43.859]  He's been going after right-wing and conservative personalities for decades, ever since he's been involved in politics.
[02:37:43.859 --> 02:37:45.020]  He's been going after all of them.
[02:37:45.020 --> 02:37:46.582]  He's been going on about hate speech.
[02:37:46.582 --> 02:37:48.404]  He despises Tommy Robinson.
[02:37:48.404 --> 02:37:57.672]  I think he's actually mentioned something about this case and he is happy about the fact that, you know, that right-wingers are being oppressed in Britain and they're being silenced and pushed away.
[02:37:57.672 --> 02:38:02.817]  He is basically a replica of Sadiq Khan, totally in bed together, totally colluding together.
[02:38:02.817 --> 02:38:04.979]  It's the same sort of cancerous,
[02:38:05.995 --> 02:38:12.863]  ...infestation that's come into our political system and our government in the last sort of 10 years.
[02:38:12.863 --> 02:38:21.873]  This really awful, highly censored ideology that despises anybody who speaks out against Islam and despises anybody who even resembles Tommy Robinson.
[02:38:30.250 --> 02:38:31.951]  The whole thing absolutely stinks.
[02:38:31.951 --> 02:38:32.712]  It's a disaster.
[02:38:32.712 --> 02:38:33.612]  And I want to be clear.
[02:38:33.612 --> 02:38:35.534]  There has been a golden era of Islam.
[02:38:35.534 --> 02:38:37.215]  They invented a lot of stuff in those countries.
[02:38:37.215 --> 02:38:39.256]  The people, a lot of them, were smart.
[02:38:39.256 --> 02:38:43.479]  But the biggest group getting killed by radical Islam are Muslims.
[02:38:43.479 --> 02:38:45.261]  And these guys are all allied with it.
[02:38:45.261 --> 02:38:49.403]  The UK brings in former ISIS fighters, Al-Qaeda, pays for their houses, everything.
[02:38:49.403 --> 02:38:55.868]  There is a red carpet all over Europe, the most radical Islamists, because they want to use them as the muscle and the enforcers.
[02:38:57.469 --> 02:39:00.459]  Tommy Robinson dot online.
[02:39:00.459 --> 02:39:03.208]  Is that the best place, the proper place for people that want to donate?
[02:39:04.802 --> 02:39:06.362]  That's the best place to do it.
[02:39:06.362 --> 02:39:13.084]  There are a couple of other sites actually who have just started working with Tommy's family to raise money for them specifically.
[02:39:13.084 --> 02:39:14.925]  I think Rebel Media has just done one.
[02:39:14.925 --> 02:39:21.646]  Those are also actually authorised, but their main, main site is TommyRobinson.online.com.
[02:39:21.646 --> 02:39:30.609]  That goes directly to his legal defence fund to fight the prison system, to get him out as soon as possible.
[02:39:30.609 --> 02:39:31.709]  So that's the best.
[02:39:32.389 --> 02:39:33.871]  Let's just get into the negative news here.
[02:39:33.871 --> 02:39:37.174]  Tommy chose this, he's a hero, we're backing him to the hill.
[02:39:37.174 --> 02:39:42.440]  But, we've got Soros getting thrown out of his command base in Hungary.
[02:39:43.530 --> 02:39:45.691]  You've got major anti-globalist movements everywhere.
[02:39:45.691 --> 02:39:47.191]  Italy's pulling out.
[02:39:47.191 --> 02:39:48.291]  The EU's unelected.
[02:39:48.291 --> 02:39:49.112]  It's falling apart.
[02:39:49.112 --> 02:39:50.192]  They're in full panic mode.
[02:39:50.192 --> 02:39:51.672]  Nationalism's exploding.
[02:39:51.672 --> 02:39:52.913]  Trump's winning.
[02:39:52.913 --> 02:40:01.655]  Those of us that are low-hanging fruit, though, that aren't protected like Trump is to a certain extent, are going to take the wrath of the zombie forces.
[02:40:01.655 --> 02:40:03.976]  So they want to take out Trump's
[02:40:05.603 --> 02:40:08.388]  Resistance command that brought him into power.
[02:40:08.388 --> 02:40:10.812]  They don't understand Trump's already moved light years ahead of that.
[02:40:10.812 --> 02:40:16.622]  We're important for the future and the midterms and everything we do because that'll only embolden them if they can take us down.
[02:40:16.622 --> 02:40:18.665]  We're still critical but I want to explain.
[02:40:19.611 --> 02:40:21.652]  That we are expendable.
[02:40:21.652 --> 02:40:24.813]  And that we've already moved past that, and we've already had victory.
[02:40:24.813 --> 02:40:32.457]  So, no matter what they do to us, and if they kill Tommy, God loves him, he's going to heaven, and you know, at the same time, we should fight for his life.
[02:40:32.457 --> 02:40:34.818]  But understand, we shouldn't let them demoralize us.
[02:40:34.818 --> 02:40:36.679]  If they destroy me, they destroy Roger.
[02:40:36.679 --> 02:40:37.719]  They destroy him.
[02:40:37.719 --> 02:40:39.360]  We're men, we chose this.
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:40.661]  We're not complaining about it.
[02:40:40.661 --> 02:40:42.301]  We want to live.
[02:40:42.301 --> 02:40:44.882]  He's got grandkids, I've got children.
[02:40:44.882 --> 02:40:46.723]  I want to move on and live to be 150.
[02:40:46.723 --> 02:40:47.644]  I'll never commit suicide.
[02:40:49.264 --> 02:40:50.985]  The big move is standing up to the globalists.
[02:40:50.985 --> 02:40:51.766]  So we're winning.
[02:40:51.766 --> 02:40:53.247]  Our sacrifice has not been in vain.
[02:40:53.247 --> 02:40:55.429]  And listeners need to know, you are the victory.
[02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:56.910]  You're the tip of the spear funding us.
[02:40:56.910 --> 02:40:59.753]  There's no place you can fund better than InfoWars.
[02:40:59.753 --> 02:41:06.018]  You know, we donated to these guys $20,000 equipment, you name it, because there's no better place than Tommy Robinson.
[02:41:06.018 --> 02:41:07.499]  We are the cutting edge.
[02:41:07.499 --> 02:41:11.503]  So InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA-253-3139.

[02:41:16.127 --> 02:41:17.668]  That's all got to end this weekend, folks.
[02:41:17.888 --> 02:41:18.189]  I've been
[02:41:32.653 --> 02:41:34.054]  It's all there.
[02:41:34.054 --> 02:41:39.036]  But donate straight up, because a lot of these products we're making like $5 on, they're so discounted.

[02:41:43.178 --> 02:41:47.379]  There's a link to the authorized place there for Roger Stone as well.
[02:41:47.379 --> 02:41:48.860]  Give them that address one more time, Roger.
[02:41:48.860 --> 02:41:50.721]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:41:51.221 --> 02:41:57.884]  All right, we're going to go to break and I promise the next segment and throughout the entire next hour, Joel Gilbert's a great guy but I preempted him, he understands.
[02:41:57.884 --> 02:42:00.945]  He can come back on later in the show if he wants to do the stuff he was going to do.
[02:42:00.945 --> 02:42:04.947]  But I want to take your calls as promised and get more into the IG report.
[02:42:04.947 --> 02:42:06.287]  Kaelin, I know you got to go.
[02:42:06.287 --> 02:42:08.568]  Thank you so much, we really appreciate you.
[02:42:08.568 --> 02:42:10.149]  Okay folks, so there you go.
[02:42:10.149 --> 02:42:13.650]  A very historic time to be alive.
[02:42:13.650 --> 02:42:15.271]  And I promise, start your engines.
[02:42:15.271 --> 02:42:19.593]  Phil, Pastor Sam, Josh, Jason, Hitman, Ron,
[02:42:20.953 --> 02:42:31.098]  Tim Wild, Alyssa, Susan, and others, in the order the calls are coming in, we're going boom, boom, bam, bam, bam, when we return.
[02:42:31.098 --> 02:42:34.880]  But it doesn't feel good to be in this fight and know we're not just getting our butt kicked.
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:41.804]  We're winning the football game, even though we're bloody, but the other guy's bloody worse, Roger, and to see Trump start to hit on all cylinders, it gives me a lot of hope.
[02:42:41.804 --> 02:42:47.507]  Well, because the movement's bigger than Alex Jones or Roger Stone or even Donald Trump, and the movement will never be stopped.
[02:42:48.683 --> 02:42:50.763]  When we come back, we'll say that prayer for Tommy and then go to calls.
[02:42:50.763 --> 02:42:51.384]  I forgot to do that.
[02:42:51.384 --> 02:42:51.924]  We're going to do that.
[02:42:51.924 --> 02:42:55.244]  We're going to lift Tommy up in prayer and every other political prisoner.
[02:42:55.244 --> 02:43:05.827]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:43:05.827 --> 02:43:07.887]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:43:07.887 --> 02:43:10.768]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:43:10.768 --> 02:43:12.248]  It's made in the USA.
[02:43:12.248 --> 02:43:15.369]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[02:43:15.629 --> 02:43:19.071]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:43:19.071 --> 02:43:21.153]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:43:21.153 --> 02:43:30.859]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:43:30.859 --> 02:43:43.448]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[02:43:43.908 --> 02:43:45.769]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:45.769 --> 02:43:48.031]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:43:48.031 --> 02:43:52.954]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:43:52.954 --> 02:43:54.656]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:44:12.208 --> 02:44:16.033]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:16.033 --> 02:44:22.521]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:44:22.521 --> 02:44:27.486]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:44:28.228 --> 02:44:32.150]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:44:32.150 --> 02:44:39.353]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.353 --> 02:44:44.055]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:44:44.055 --> 02:44:50.258]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.258 --> 02:44:54.220]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:58.246 --> 02:45:04.992]  This is the last week to get free shipping on all of our best-selling items at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:04.992 --> 02:45:14.941]  We also have some of the biggest sales in our history on super high-quality supplements and other products at InfoWarsStore.com as well as InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:14.941 --> 02:45:17.343]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:45:17.523 --> 02:45:17.863]  We're good.
[02:45:41.096 --> 02:45:46.079]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[02:45:46.079 --> 02:45:46.419]  It's you!
[02:46:05.563 --> 02:46:07.744]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:46:07.744 --> 02:46:16.447]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:46:16.447 --> 02:46:21.048]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:46:21.048 --> 02:46:22.489]  You are the info war.
[02:46:22.489 --> 02:46:26.030]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:38.093]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:46:38.093 --> 02:46:46.055]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:46:46.055 --> 02:46:53.117]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:46:53.117 --> 02:46:55.858]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[02:46:59.242 --> 02:47:07.127]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:07.127 --> 02:47:08.928]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:47:08.928 --> 02:47:12.269]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:36.790 --> 02:47:39.231]  All right!
[02:47:39.231 --> 02:47:41.432]  Who should we go to first?
[02:47:41.432 --> 02:47:42.913]  Pastor Sam?
[02:47:42.913 --> 02:47:44.814]  Josh?
[02:47:44.814 --> 02:47:45.234]  Susan?
[02:47:45.234 --> 02:47:47.635]  We're gonna go to everybody.
[02:47:47.635 --> 02:47:48.455]  Roger Stone's here.
[02:47:48.455 --> 02:47:52.377]  We're gonna take calls the entire next hour.
[02:47:52.377 --> 02:47:54.918]  We're doing a 34-hour broadcast.
[02:47:54.918 --> 02:47:58.300]  I cannot stress enough to all of you out there that history's happening now, not later.
[02:47:59.266 --> 02:48:06.011]  And if you'll just spread the articles, the videos, the links, if you'll tell people, hey, Infowars is under attack because it's telling the truth.
[02:48:06.011 --> 02:48:12.596]  Every day there's some story we wrote two years ago, five years ago, six months ago, word for word what we said happening.
[02:48:12.596 --> 02:48:18.260]  Because I've got all the sources, they're all these good people.
[02:48:18.260 --> 02:48:23.845]  But a lot of the people I get on, I'm not going to say names, they're not allowed to say what they say on Fox.
[02:48:25.128 --> 02:48:28.029]  They're not allowed to say what they say on their radio show.
[02:48:28.029 --> 02:48:29.250]  They're not allowed to say what they say.
[02:48:29.250 --> 02:48:31.291]  They can come here and they can do it.
[02:48:31.291 --> 02:48:35.173]  And then they get given the third degree when they do come on.
[02:48:35.173 --> 02:48:36.894]  They put their careers in their hands when they do.
[02:48:36.894 --> 02:48:42.037]  But more and more, there's more courage as people realize we gotta beat the globalists no matter what happens.
[02:48:42.037 --> 02:48:47.179]  We just gotta commit, take the fight to them, and not have any half measures.
[02:48:47.179 --> 02:48:49.781]  And Trump is a great example of that.
[02:48:49.781 --> 02:48:52.302]  We're gonna go to calls, but let's play this clip from this morning.
[02:48:53.646 --> 02:48:57.531]  Calling the entire top of the FBI a bunch of Democrat-controlled scum and Comey.
[02:48:57.531 --> 02:48:58.793]  Because that's what they are.
[02:48:58.793 --> 02:49:03.839]  It's protecting the sellout of us to China and Russia and others.
[02:49:03.839 --> 02:49:05.381]  These people are our enemies.
[02:49:05.381 --> 02:49:08.365]  But bigger than these foreign countries are the big corporations that run them.
[02:49:08.365 --> 02:49:09.026]  So here's the President.
[02:49:10.757 --> 02:49:13.179]  I have the greatest supporters in the world.
[02:49:13.179 --> 02:49:15.401]  By the way, they're the smartest.
[02:49:15.401 --> 02:49:16.842]  They're the hardest working.
[02:49:16.842 --> 02:49:18.263]  They pay taxes.
[02:49:18.263 --> 02:49:19.384]  They're incredible.
[02:49:19.384 --> 02:49:20.766]  They're loyal.
[02:49:20.766 --> 02:49:21.867]  I have the bikers.
[02:49:21.867 --> 02:49:25.510]  I have the construction workers.
[02:49:25.510 --> 02:49:27.351]  I have them all.
[02:49:27.351 --> 02:49:28.973]  By the way, I have the FBI.
[02:49:28.973 --> 02:49:33.136]  You go into the FBI and take a poll of the real FBI, not the scum on top.
[02:49:33.136 --> 02:49:35.498]  Not Comey and that group of people that are total thieves.
[02:49:37.248 --> 02:49:40.856]  Well, I don't know how Peter Strzok is still working there, to be honest with you.
[02:49:40.856 --> 02:49:41.658]  He's working in HR.
[02:49:41.658 --> 02:49:42.540]  That's even worse.
[02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:45.907]  So, we're going to the calls, but you know the president well.
[02:49:45.907 --> 02:49:47.471]  And we're not going to do this now.
[02:49:48.456 --> 02:49:51.418]  We'll do it at the bottom of the next hour, you know.
[02:49:51.418 --> 02:49:52.299]  You haven't told me these stories.
[02:49:52.299 --> 02:49:59.804]  I went and looked it up in the New York Times and then I asked you a few and you said, well, that's not completely untrue, but you were the President's wingman for many years.
[02:49:59.804 --> 02:50:00.865]  Yes.
[02:50:00.865 --> 02:50:04.428]  So that's really what you, you know, you guys have been buddies.
[02:50:04.428 --> 02:50:05.309]  Yes.
[02:50:05.309 --> 02:50:12.334]  And they'd begun asking, Mueller's people began asking about questions about the President and women.
[02:50:12.334 --> 02:50:14.295]  You think they asked those questions about Jack Kennedy?
[02:50:14.295 --> 02:50:14.736]  What do you think?
[02:50:15.476 --> 02:50:17.137]  So, I don't know what it is they want.
[02:50:17.137 --> 02:50:31.768]  Well, I think you should get out front of it, because the stuff I read in the New York Times, they know, it's all been back when they loved Trump, it was all in the New York Times, it was in the New York Post, it was in the New Yorker, you know, about Roger Stone and Trump seen out again with three lovely ladies or whatever.
[02:50:32.488 --> 02:50:34.729]  It was always in between his divorces.
[02:50:34.729 --> 02:50:35.889]  You told me some of the stories.
[02:50:35.889 --> 02:50:38.330]  Well, yeah, you didn't tell me anything that wasn't known.
[02:50:38.330 --> 02:50:40.310]  I just asked you about a year ago, is this true?
[02:50:40.310 --> 02:50:42.991]  Well, yeah, in between divorces, you know, we would double date.
[02:50:42.991 --> 02:50:46.632]  One of the great playboys of all time, no question about it.
[02:50:46.632 --> 02:50:49.072]  But in between marriages.
[02:50:49.072 --> 02:50:56.634]  And you predicted this after the election, and then even later, they're going to keep coming back at him with the women.
[02:50:57.642 --> 02:51:03.727]  And that's clearly one of the direct... And the women have said, now they've asked you, that he, if anything, he spoils the hell out of women.
[02:51:03.727 --> 02:51:10.032]  But why is Mueller going around asking people about questions about the President and women?
[02:51:10.032 --> 02:51:11.654]  It seems totally inappropriate.
[02:51:11.654 --> 02:51:15.817]  Wait a minute, is this about Russian collusion in the 2016 election?
[02:51:15.817 --> 02:51:17.398]  Evidently not.
[02:51:17.398 --> 02:51:23.783]  I gotta say, in this whole corrupt world of everything, it's kind of refreshing, you know, a guy that likes women.
[02:51:23.783 --> 02:51:25.645]  Well, the President definitely likes women.
[02:51:25.645 --> 02:51:26.706]  Of that there is no doubt.
[02:51:27.892 --> 02:51:29.053]  Like women do.
[02:51:29.053 --> 02:51:29.893]  What's wrong with that?
[02:51:29.893 --> 02:51:39.958]  It just shows you how far afield and how the resolve of these people to remove the president and the deep animus they have for him.
[02:51:39.958 --> 02:51:43.780]  But what does it say that they can't find anybody to say anything that's real?
[02:51:43.780 --> 02:51:44.580]  There's nothing.
[02:51:44.580 --> 02:51:47.582]  Well, that's why they're trying to presumably squeeze Michael Cohen.
[02:51:47.582 --> 02:51:49.663]  That's why they're going to try to squeeze me.
[02:51:50.443 --> 02:51:56.127]  You know, we're going to send you to jail for 10 years unless you tell us the president did X. I'm not playing that game.
[02:51:56.127 --> 02:51:58.109]  I'm not going to testify against Donald Trump.
[02:51:58.109 --> 02:52:02.432]  Well, it's like the one lady he dated for like six months in the New York Times right before the election a year and a half ago.
[02:52:03.706 --> 02:52:04.366]  Eighteen months ago.
[02:52:04.366 --> 02:52:08.529]  I forget her name, but she said the day after, she goes, no, they misquoted me.
[02:52:08.529 --> 02:52:10.450]  Because he called her fat and was mean to her.
[02:52:10.450 --> 02:52:13.692]  No, she said all he was was super nice, bought me all these things.
[02:52:13.692 --> 02:52:17.894]  He was so gentlemanly and treated me so good, it was almost off-putting that he was such a gentleman.
[02:52:17.894 --> 02:52:20.656]  You know, girls don't like guys that are too nice, but he was so great.
[02:52:20.656 --> 02:52:24.098]  And yeah, he did tell me, hey, we both need to lose some weight.
[02:52:24.098 --> 02:52:26.319]  They took that and had it say, he told me I was fat.
[02:52:26.319 --> 02:52:30.141]  No, he said, we both ought to, at dinner, not eat dessert.
[02:52:30.141 --> 02:52:31.042]  We're both getting fat.
[02:52:34.045 --> 02:52:36.065]  That's the worst thing you ever did to a woman?
[02:52:36.065 --> 02:52:38.006]  It's Trump derangement syndrome.
[02:52:38.006 --> 02:52:38.846]  It really is.
[02:52:38.846 --> 02:52:48.347]  And the more successful he is, the better the economy does, the better the prospects for peace, the more hysterical the deep state... And I think that's really revealing.
[02:52:48.347 --> 02:52:49.248]  We're talking about the bottom of the hour.
[02:52:49.248 --> 02:52:50.148]  We're going to call some 30 seconds.
[02:52:50.148 --> 02:52:52.388]  Let me just ask you this.
[02:52:52.388 --> 02:52:53.028]  You really should.
[02:52:53.028 --> 02:52:54.929]  The way to defend him is just go ahead and tell folks.
[02:52:54.929 --> 02:52:57.469]  I mean, he treats women really nice.
[02:52:57.469 --> 02:53:00.050]  I mean, have you ever seen Trump mistreating women?
[02:53:00.050 --> 02:53:01.230]  Never.
[02:53:01.230 --> 02:53:02.590]  How would you describe the way he treats women?
[02:53:03.660 --> 02:53:05.381]  Puts him on a pedestal.
[02:53:05.381 --> 02:53:07.102]  Look, he's very respectful.
[02:53:07.102 --> 02:53:09.244]  He's also very discreet.
[02:53:09.244 --> 02:53:13.727]  But the fact that we're even talking about this is incredible.
[02:53:13.727 --> 02:53:14.628]  But it's not us doing it.
[02:53:14.628 --> 02:53:15.508]  They're the ones.
[02:53:15.508 --> 02:53:18.671]  Well, clearly, Mr. Mueller is going there.
[02:53:18.671 --> 02:53:28.138]  I have numerous reports of FBI agents fanning out and asking associates and former associates and those about the president and women.
[02:53:28.138 --> 02:53:30.419]  I thought this was about Russian collusion.
[02:53:30.419 --> 02:53:31.660]  What does this have to do with the 2016 election?
[02:53:33.382 --> 02:53:37.326]  But it just gives you some idea where this special counsel may be headed.
[02:53:37.326 --> 02:53:37.947]  Well, there you go.
[02:53:37.947 --> 02:53:42.272]  Trump nemesis Mueller now focusing on women.
[02:53:42.272 --> 02:53:43.414]  Well, it's just like Manafort now.
[02:53:43.414 --> 02:53:45.156]  They're saying obstruction in the case.
[02:53:45.156 --> 02:53:45.997]  There's nothing.
[02:53:45.997 --> 02:53:47.359]  So they just go to obstruction in the case.
[02:53:48.411 --> 02:53:52.214]  Presumably they could cook up some process crime.
[02:53:52.214 --> 02:53:58.018]  This is why I continue to oppose the idea that the President should give an interview to the Special Counsel.
[02:53:58.018 --> 02:54:02.501]  I saw Rudy Giuliani still left the door open a little bit the other night on Fox.
[02:54:02.501 --> 02:54:06.164]  I think that would be an egregious... You've been right about this day one and you've told the President.
[02:54:06.164 --> 02:54:08.545]  Okay, we're going to go to Ron, then we're going to go to everybody.
[02:54:08.545 --> 02:54:09.206]  I promise now.
[02:54:09.206 --> 02:54:09.866]  Boom, boom, boom.
[02:54:09.866 --> 02:54:11.027]  We're going to your calls.
[02:54:11.027 --> 02:54:14.670]  Ron in Texas, you're on the air with Roger Stone during the 34-hour broadcast.
[02:54:14.670 --> 02:54:15.030]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:54:16.428 --> 02:54:18.529]  Hey Alex, hey Roger, how are y'all?
[02:54:18.529 --> 02:54:19.170]  Great.
[02:54:19.170 --> 02:54:20.511]  We're in the thick of the fight, I can tell you that.
[02:54:20.511 --> 02:54:22.632]  We're certainly not bored.
[02:54:22.632 --> 02:54:26.435]  I'm telling you, I have two points to make and I'll make them quick.
[02:54:26.435 --> 02:54:34.220]  One is, I have a friend, his name is Ron Farrington, and he is friends with a guy named Dr. William Samuelson.
[02:54:34.220 --> 02:54:42.886]  Dr. William Samuelson was in Buchenwald concentration camp in Nazi Germany with George Soros.
[02:54:45.646 --> 02:54:59.694]  He was there with him, and he told my friend Ron that Soros would talk to guys, talk to the people in the prison, and they would end up disappeared.
[02:54:59.694 --> 02:55:06.118]  He would talk to them, and their families would disappear.
[02:55:06.118 --> 02:55:11.502]  That's the God's honest truth, and I'd like to see y'all get in touch with Dr. William Samuelson.
[02:55:12.762 --> 02:55:18.012]  He's a professor, I think he taught at UT, and he's also an author.
[02:55:18.012 --> 02:55:19.274]  You can find him online.
[02:55:20.476 --> 02:55:28.502]  And I just wanted to get that out there and hopefully y'all could get him on the show and have him talk about George Soros.
[02:55:28.502 --> 02:55:31.445]  Well, I will, but you got me thinking.
[02:55:31.445 --> 02:55:43.934]  Soros reportedly for three years worked with his stepfather to rounded up Jews and took their property and find hidden Jews, like Anne Frank, but not in Poland or Germany, but in Romania and Hungary.
[02:55:45.086 --> 02:55:47.667]  And he would then help round them up.
[02:55:47.667 --> 02:55:51.950]  Now, we know that from him on 60 Minutes and on NPR and in a book.
[02:55:51.950 --> 02:55:57.093]  But maybe he's such a liar, you know, they say this guy is him, but reportedly they've checked that's not him.
[02:55:57.093 --> 02:55:58.774]  I don't think it looks like him.
[02:55:58.774 --> 02:56:02.115]  But the point is, is I think they didn't put out the disinfo to get us off the track.
[02:56:02.115 --> 02:56:06.438]  I'm not saying you're disinfo, but it's Soros saying he helped round up Jews.
[02:56:06.438 --> 02:56:10.700]  And then now they say he was a hero that cut Hitler's head off and, you know, was in a concentration camp.
[02:56:10.700 --> 02:56:13.061]  That's kind of the line they say to defend Soros.
[02:56:13.061 --> 02:56:14.022]  So they go the other extreme.
[02:56:14.722 --> 02:56:18.645]  But I'll look into your report, sir.
[02:56:18.645 --> 02:56:20.547]  All I know is what Soros said on 60 Minutes.
[02:56:20.547 --> 02:56:28.113]  And now he's got the Young Turks and CNN and other people saying that he was captured by the Nazis.
[02:56:28.113 --> 02:56:29.714]  Soros has never said that.
[02:56:29.714 --> 02:56:34.919]  But you're saying this individual said that... I mean, that's what Soros did was ferret out Jews and where they were at.
[02:56:34.919 --> 02:56:39.282]  But you're saying he was like a quizling that they would put into the general population?
[02:56:39.282 --> 02:56:39.582]  Right.
[02:56:39.582 --> 02:56:40.683]  He was like a mole.
[02:56:40.683 --> 02:56:41.464]  He was in there.
[02:56:42.017 --> 02:56:50.344]  With the prisoners, and he would find out information about them, and give it to, you know, the officers, the Nazis that were in charge.
[02:56:50.344 --> 02:56:52.446]  And these people would end up disappearing.
[02:56:52.446 --> 02:56:54.568]  That's consistent with what we think he was doing?
[02:56:54.568 --> 02:56:55.628]  Absolutely.
[02:56:55.628 --> 02:56:59.332]  He's an ordained minister, and, you know, it's not the end.
[02:56:59.332 --> 02:57:00.933]  It's proof.
[02:57:00.933 --> 02:57:09.240]  And, you know, if y'all can contact Dr. William Samuelson, I'm sure he'd be happy to confirm it, because
[02:57:09.625 --> 02:57:21.130]  He told my friend Ron that if he ever saw George Soros, he would take drastic measures, if you know what I mean.
[02:57:21.130 --> 02:57:26.352]  All I know is George Soros made his money overthrowing countries and crashing pension funds.
[02:57:26.352 --> 02:57:28.593]  So those are the real crimes he's committed.
[02:57:28.593 --> 02:57:31.275]  I mean, hell, he helped overthrow Ukraine.
[02:57:31.275 --> 02:57:32.115]  Thank you, God bless you.
[02:57:32.115 --> 02:57:33.856]  All I know is I've been told to shut up about it.
[02:57:33.856 --> 02:57:36.477]  Let me tell you something, you old dirty piece of crap.
[02:57:38.025 --> 02:57:38.887]  You damn demon!
[02:57:38.887 --> 02:57:40.432]  I'm not scared of you, I'm scared of God.
[02:57:40.432 --> 02:57:43.743]  So I just pray that God bring judgment upon George Soros.
[02:57:43.743 --> 02:57:44.084]  Stay with us.
[02:57:46.383 --> 02:57:54.947]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.
[02:57:54.947 --> 02:57:58.428]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.
[02:57:58.428 --> 02:58:07.973]  to create the strongest, most concentrated, over-the-top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula that is safe.
[02:58:07.973 --> 02:58:15.136]  I know from using this myself the last few months, and from seeing my friends and family use it, that this new product is going to end up being the number one

[03:00:06.846 --> 03:00:09.449]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:09.449 --> 03:00:10.990]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.990 --> 03:00:15.835]  Alright, we're going right to your phone calls.
[03:00:15.835 --> 03:00:18.198]  Roger Stone riding shotgun in the shower with me.
[03:00:18.198 --> 03:00:21.401]  I hate to say it, but I'm going to say a prayer for Tommy Robinson.
[03:00:22.905 --> 03:00:32.068]  Uh, and I, you know, I get embarrassed praying in public or whatever, but I think, you know, you made that point that it's important for us people to focus and think about God and bring God into it, and so I'll just say a prayer here.
[03:00:32.068 --> 03:00:33.168]  You can say anything you want, Roger.
[03:00:33.168 --> 03:00:40.751]  Just tell me, Robbins, as an honorable person, Lord and Savior, and we just ask, you know, you're, via your son Jesus Christ,
[03:00:41.531 --> 03:00:44.374]  That you send the heads of protection and angels around him.
[03:00:44.374 --> 03:00:47.837]  We ask others to hold him up in prayer as well, God.
[03:00:47.837 --> 03:00:56.184]  And all he's done, first to expose the Muslim grooming gangs and to be tortured in prison and beat up and lose his business, lose his house and now his wife and children.
[03:00:56.184 --> 03:00:57.145]  We ask you to protect them.
[03:00:57.145 --> 03:01:01.389]  And we ask that these evil people that are oppressing him and trying to silence him,
[03:01:02.489 --> 03:01:05.572]  Uh, you know, repent and that you show them there are other ways.
[03:01:05.572 --> 03:01:09.195]  But we just thank you for everything you've done and the great awakening that's happening.
[03:01:09.195 --> 03:01:10.756]  But we ask you just to, you know, protect people.
[03:01:10.756 --> 03:01:17.962]  That's your will, like Tommy, or that if they are going to kill him, that just, you know, your will be done and that it be as painless as possible.
[03:01:17.962 --> 03:01:20.023]  But again, we hope that doesn't happen.
[03:01:20.023 --> 03:01:22.926]  So we just ask you to protect Tommy Robinson, if that's your will.
[03:01:24.565 --> 03:01:33.032]  We've got to direct us all as well in this very critical time where we're seeing good come back into the world and evil resist it.
[03:01:33.032 --> 03:01:36.034]  Again, thank you for everything and Amen.
[03:01:36.034 --> 03:01:37.475]  Amen.
[03:01:37.475 --> 03:01:39.357]  It's important.
[03:01:39.357 --> 03:01:44.841]  It's power.
[03:01:44.841 --> 03:01:46.503]  This is real palpable evil we're fighting.
[03:01:52.025 --> 03:01:55.428]  Let's go to Hat Man, and then we'll go to everybody else.
[03:01:55.428 --> 03:01:56.529]  Hat Man in Virginia.
[03:01:56.529 --> 03:01:58.811]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:01:58.811 --> 03:02:01.814]  Brother Alex Jones, am I glad to be able to talk to you.
[03:02:01.814 --> 03:02:03.936]  I'm going to talk to you.
[03:02:03.936 --> 03:02:05.157]  You are an admirable man.
[03:02:05.157 --> 03:02:07.119]  There's a lot of things about you I really like.
[03:02:07.119 --> 03:02:14.145]  I like the way that you've stood up for the truth for years and years and years, even when people made fun of you and all that other stuff.
[03:02:14.145 --> 03:02:17.088]  But anyhow, I'd love to talk to you for about an hour, but I know it'd be
[03:02:18.331 --> 03:02:22.573]  Unfair to all the rest of your listeners, so I'll try to get right straight to the point.
[03:02:22.573 --> 03:02:31.916]  I think that the Founding Fathers left us a tool with which to regain control of our government agents, and that tool is the oath of office.
[03:02:31.916 --> 03:02:34.817]  Now, you've been to court a few times, I expect.
[03:02:34.817 --> 03:02:39.338]  Remember what the bailiff does before any witness or litigant can testify?
[03:02:39.338 --> 03:02:41.019]  They make you swear yourself in.
[03:02:41.823 --> 03:02:42.844]  Damn right.
[03:02:42.844 --> 03:02:51.313]  So, I've done some research on this and I found out that no public servant has ever been tried for violation of their oath of office.
[03:02:51.313 --> 03:02:52.014]  That's right.
[03:02:52.014 --> 03:02:55.778]  Because it's perjury before the people in the Constitution and God.
[03:02:55.778 --> 03:03:01.824]  How do we get perjury trouble if we lie in court, which I would never do, but then they all get to lie.
[03:03:01.824 --> 03:03:02.445]  That's a great point.
[03:03:03.413 --> 03:03:07.836]  Well, and that's why I was hoping to get through to you so that your audience members could hear.
[03:03:07.836 --> 03:03:17.543]  Because what's going on is there's been a few court rulings that say that even though the Constitution starts off with the words, we the people, we're not a party to it.
[03:03:17.543 --> 03:03:19.065]  The states are parties to it.
[03:03:19.065 --> 03:03:29.212]  So the only way to go after any government employee is to go to the states first and petition the state representatives to then petition the federal government to arrest these people and try them for
[03:03:29.833 --> 03:03:30.934]  No, no, I agree.
[03:03:30.934 --> 03:03:37.982]  We need to start seeing in the Constitution these public officials getting in trouble for violation of oath.
[03:03:37.982 --> 03:03:40.184]  I remember studying this years ago.
[03:03:40.184 --> 03:03:47.112]  There are provisions in the Constitution, and I think it's impeachment, but there's other things for violating your oath.
[03:03:48.041 --> 03:03:49.981]  Oh yeah, there's high crimes and misdemeanors.
[03:03:49.981 --> 03:03:55.723]  As long as somebody's in Congress, for example, they can't be arrested for any misdemeanors.
[03:03:55.723 --> 03:03:57.423]  But luckily, perjury is a felony.
[03:03:57.423 --> 03:03:58.243]  You make a great point.
[03:03:58.243 --> 03:03:59.363]  Years ago, I got into this deeply.
[03:03:59.363 --> 03:04:04.305]  But what do you make of Trump gets about a 95 on keeping his promises?
[03:04:04.305 --> 03:04:06.505]  And then now you've got a ceasefire that hadn't happened yet.
[03:04:06.505 --> 03:04:09.406]  I mean, ever before in Afghanistan.
[03:04:09.406 --> 03:04:10.486]  So, I mean, he's got like a 95.
[03:04:10.486 --> 03:04:12.846]  I can't believe he's even kept that many promises.
[03:04:12.846 --> 03:04:13.847]  Because he can't keep them all.
[03:04:13.847 --> 03:04:15.027]  He's not a dictator.
[03:04:16.181 --> 03:04:20.583]  Yeah, I know, even though the mainstream media keeps saying that he is.
[03:04:20.583 --> 03:04:27.067]  I admire Trump, and I found out about Mark Taylor probably about three months before he was elected.
[03:04:27.067 --> 03:04:32.890]  I'm glad you found out about him recently, and I hope that you get a chance to go to his website and read his prophecy.
[03:04:33.010 --> 03:04:33.971]  No, I want to get him on the show.
[03:04:33.971 --> 03:04:37.354]  I mean, I've seen some of it, but I just get so busy.
[03:04:37.354 --> 03:04:38.615]  Mark Taylor really did.
[03:04:38.615 --> 03:04:41.077]  He's the number first guy that said it first.
[03:04:41.077 --> 03:04:41.858]  Absolutely.
[03:04:41.858 --> 03:04:42.238]  All right.
[03:04:42.238 --> 03:04:42.859]  We'll be back.
[03:04:42.859 --> 03:04:43.800]  Thank you, Hat Man.
[03:04:43.800 --> 03:04:46.042]  We're going to go straight to other calls on the other side.

[03:06:28.439 --> 03:06:35.301]  We're going to go to Josh, Pastor Sam, Susan, Elissa and others in just a second.
[03:06:35.301 --> 03:06:36.462]  We're going to do it right now.
[03:06:37.701 --> 03:06:40.182]  It's just the AG report is out.
[03:06:40.182 --> 03:06:43.383]  Keep saying AG, IG, IG, Inspector General.
[03:06:43.383 --> 03:06:44.323]  What do you make of it?
[03:06:44.323 --> 03:06:57.108]  Because it does this frosting, this sweet frosting that nobody did anything wrong or illegal, but Obama did have access to the secret server and lie and had an alias.
[03:06:57.108 --> 03:06:59.409]  Yeah, they were planning to destroy his election.
[03:07:01.024 --> 03:07:02.065]  Stop his presidency.
[03:07:02.065 --> 03:07:04.106]  And yeah, they did violate all the FBI rules.
[03:07:04.106 --> 03:07:06.047]  And yeah, they did lie to Congress.
[03:07:06.047 --> 03:07:10.369]  I mean, it's almost like a punt to Congress and the people.
[03:07:10.369 --> 03:07:13.491]  We're like, we're not saying anybody did anything bad, but here's the things they did.
[03:07:14.429 --> 03:07:17.371]  The FBI Director's performance is what shocked me.
[03:07:17.371 --> 03:07:20.512]  I mean, that was putting a nice coating on the whole thing.
[03:07:20.512 --> 03:07:22.753]  Like, there was no politics.
[03:07:22.753 --> 03:07:24.754]  Oh, we did find some bias.
[03:07:24.754 --> 03:07:28.076]  We're going to pull everybody in for sensitivity training.
[03:07:28.076 --> 03:07:32.298]  And we have great reverence for the congressional oversight.
[03:07:32.298 --> 03:07:34.859]  Of course, we're not giving you guys any of the stuff you've asked for.
[03:07:34.859 --> 03:07:36.840]  By the way, Strzok is now in.
[03:07:38.307 --> 03:07:42.452]  Uh, the area of human resources, so maybe Strzok will teach the classes.
[03:07:42.452 --> 03:07:45.375]  Or he'll hire other people, even better.
[03:07:45.375 --> 03:07:48.058]  This is, this, this FBI director needs to go.
[03:07:48.058 --> 03:07:50.300]  This is one of the President's largest mistakes.
[03:07:50.300 --> 03:07:51.722]  He needs to clean house.
[03:07:51.722 --> 03:07:54.525]  The problem is not with the rank and file agents, we know that.
[03:07:54.525 --> 03:07:56.747]  Those are good men and women doing their job.
[03:07:56.747 --> 03:08:00.111]  You have a corrupted political, uh, uh,
[03:08:00.331 --> 03:08:02.833]  Cabal at the top, and they have to go.
[03:08:02.833 --> 03:08:09.119]  And unfortunately, Chris Wray is committed to covering up the crimes of the people who came before him.
[03:08:09.119 --> 03:08:10.380]  It's pathetic.
[03:08:10.380 --> 03:08:12.562]  That performance yesterday was pathetic.
[03:08:12.562 --> 03:08:14.744]  He admitted to nothing.
[03:08:14.744 --> 03:08:23.052]  He tried to gloss over all of the obvious anti-Trump bias by saying, well, those people weren't making decisions.
[03:08:23.052 --> 03:08:24.032]  They most certainly were.
[03:08:24.898 --> 03:08:26.519]  It's extraordinary.
[03:08:26.519 --> 03:08:31.402]  I think this is one of those documents where you can see anything you want.
[03:08:31.402 --> 03:08:33.063]  What about the surveillance?
[03:08:33.063 --> 03:08:34.324]  What about the FISA warrants?
[03:08:34.324 --> 03:08:38.266]  What about the FBI infiltration of the Trump campaign?
[03:08:38.266 --> 03:08:45.951]  Those are the real issues that Devin Nunes is fighting to get into and the FBI and the DOJ are continuing to resist.
[03:08:47.731 --> 03:08:51.432]  If you look at Comey and all these guys, they look like criminals.
[03:08:51.432 --> 03:08:53.973]  They just act like slimy, know-it-all psychopaths.
[03:08:53.973 --> 03:08:56.074]  I mean, I wouldn't buy a car from them.
[03:08:56.074 --> 03:08:57.855]  If they were my waiter, I'd get up and leave the restaurant.
[03:08:57.855 --> 03:09:01.176]  I mean, they just radiate disingenuous con men.
[03:09:03.766 --> 03:09:06.729]  They all have the same, that same kind of haircut, too.
[03:09:06.729 --> 03:09:07.770]  Did you notice that?
[03:09:07.770 --> 03:09:12.635]  Like this guy, Chris Wray, looks like he could be a lounge singer in Atlantic City.
[03:09:12.635 --> 03:09:13.996]  I mean, the guy was oily.
[03:09:13.996 --> 03:09:19.282]  That performance, I hope the president was watching, because if he was, he'd have to be furious.
[03:09:19.282 --> 03:09:20.483]  Well, it didn't come off well.
[03:09:20.483 --> 03:09:21.584]  I watched part of it.
[03:09:21.584 --> 03:09:22.165]  I mean, look at that.
[03:09:22.745 --> 03:09:23.786]  Hello, children.
[03:09:23.786 --> 03:09:24.947]  Oof.
[03:09:24.947 --> 03:09:26.888]  I have a little ice cream truck.
[03:09:26.888 --> 03:09:28.389]  I have ice cream.
[03:09:28.389 --> 03:09:30.110]  I have cookies.
[03:09:30.110 --> 03:09:31.911]  I have puppies.
[03:09:31.911 --> 03:09:42.198]  Now, once you get in the back of the van, put on handcuffs and put this red ball in your mouth, and then I'm gonna give you the prize.
[03:09:42.198 --> 03:09:44.960]  I'm gonna slit your throat now.
[03:09:44.960 --> 03:09:46.341]  Liberal.
[03:09:46.341 --> 03:09:49.703]  This guy is just committed to protecting the status quo.
[03:09:49.703 --> 03:09:52.385]  And the sad part- I mean, Comey looks like a child molester.
[03:09:53.166 --> 03:10:03.735]  I'm not saying he's a child molester, but if you were going to cast somebody in a Hollywood movie for a guy that has a dungeon of little kids hanging by meathooks, does Comey not look like a giant porcelain doll?
[03:10:03.735 --> 03:10:07.218]  You know those little dolls that ventriloquists have that look really creepy from horror movies?
[03:10:07.218 --> 03:10:07.538]  Yeah.
[03:10:07.538 --> 03:10:10.941]  He looks like a seven foot tall Creepazoid.
[03:10:10.941 --> 03:10:12.042]  Here's the real problem, Alex.
[03:10:12.042 --> 03:10:12.482]  Let me tell you.
[03:10:12.482 --> 03:10:18.508]  They had Penn State and the FBI got compromised, and so you can talk about it all day, but at the top it is a bunch of sick filth.
[03:10:19.332 --> 03:10:23.333]  Well, and does anybody really think that Hillary is going to be prosecuted?
[03:10:23.333 --> 03:10:25.333]  That Comey is going to be prosecuted?
[03:10:25.333 --> 03:10:29.814]  Why did Obama order $65,000 of succulent hot dogs for one party?
[03:10:29.814 --> 03:10:30.955]  He said, are these really good ones?
[03:10:30.955 --> 03:10:33.475]  Because he wants really succulent, juicy ones.
[03:10:33.475 --> 03:10:35.336]  Will they be as good as the ones we had in Hawaii?
[03:10:35.336 --> 03:10:37.296]  God, those were good.
[03:10:37.296 --> 03:10:38.216]  Can't comment on that.
[03:10:38.216 --> 03:10:39.897]  I wonder how big those hot dogs are.
[03:10:39.897 --> 03:10:42.577]  Can't comment on that.
[03:10:42.577 --> 03:10:43.138]  Here's the thing.
[03:10:47.864 --> 03:10:53.226]  Does Obama actually articulate the hot dog or does he just take the hot dog?
[03:10:53.226 --> 03:10:54.327]  I'm not going to go there.
[03:10:54.327 --> 03:10:55.167]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:10:55.167 --> 03:10:56.027]  I'm serious.
[03:10:56.027 --> 03:11:04.771]  I'm talking about if you're ordering $65,000 worth of hot dogs for a Chicago party, they say 20 people are going to be at, how many hot dogs do they eat?
[03:11:04.771 --> 03:11:07.112]  I'm not good at math, but that'd be a lot of hot dogs.
[03:11:07.112 --> 03:11:08.292]  That's for sure.
[03:11:08.292 --> 03:11:09.333]  But let's really break it down.
[03:11:09.333 --> 03:11:13.715]  Let's say top gay escort, let's say is for two hours.
[03:11:15.350 --> 03:11:17.772]  I'm just looking into this from a lot of experience.
[03:11:17.772 --> 03:11:18.612]  I'm joking.
[03:11:18.612 --> 03:11:20.414]  Let's say $8,000.
[03:11:20.414 --> 03:11:21.574]  Gay porn stars.
[03:11:21.574 --> 03:11:26.838]  So how many gay porn stars is that divided into $65,000 worth of succulent hot dogs?
[03:11:26.838 --> 03:11:27.638]  Guys, can you divide?
[03:11:27.638 --> 03:11:28.999]  Let's say once over two hours.
[03:11:28.999 --> 03:11:30.280]  Let's divide.
[03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:31.321]  Roger, let's divide.
[03:11:31.321 --> 03:11:31.341]  $8,000.
[03:11:31.341 --> 03:11:35.104]  They're going to give the president a discount.
[03:11:35.104 --> 03:11:38.066]  But let's say $4,000.
[03:11:38.066 --> 03:11:39.006]  $4,000 divided into $65,000.
[03:11:39.006 --> 03:11:41.008]  Guys, can you do that please?
[03:11:41.008 --> 03:11:43.229]  While we play some Jeopardy music in the background.
[03:11:43.229 --> 03:11:44.230]  How many?
[03:11:44.230 --> 03:11:44.470]  How many?
[03:11:47.148 --> 03:11:51.472]  No, that's not 61 and a half.
[03:11:51.472 --> 03:11:53.633]  Oh, it's six.
[03:11:53.633 --> 03:11:54.955]  Six hot dogs.
[03:11:54.955 --> 03:12:02.181]  So, okay, so, they're at a Chicago party and they ordered six male prostitutes.
[03:12:02.181 --> 03:12:04.703]  Well, you're assuming that there's some kind of code language there.
[03:12:04.703 --> 03:12:07.985]  Look, I'm more... How do you order $65,000 worth of hot dogs?
[03:12:07.985 --> 03:12:15.792]  I'm more concerned with the fact that he blatantly went out and said... I can feed a party of 50 people for like 20 bucks worth of hot dogs.
[03:12:17.841 --> 03:12:20.023]  But will they be good hot dogs, though?
[03:12:20.023 --> 03:12:24.929]  Maybe they're substandard hot dogs.
[03:12:24.929 --> 03:12:28.012]  Well, there is that gay prostitute I got for $10 that time.
[03:12:28.012 --> 03:12:31.155]  Look, the Morson, there was the crack whore in Orlando.
[03:12:31.155 --> 03:12:32.457]  Let's get more serious here.
[03:12:32.457 --> 03:12:37.662]  The real thing here is that Obama got caught lying yesterday about the fact that Hillary had an illegal server.
[03:12:38.736 --> 03:12:39.496]  And he knew it.
[03:12:39.496 --> 03:12:40.757]  And he lied about it.
[03:12:40.757 --> 03:12:42.077]  And he'll pay no penalty.
[03:12:42.077 --> 03:12:43.838]  And Hillary will pay no penalty.
[03:12:43.838 --> 03:12:45.519]  And Comey will pay no penalty.
[03:12:45.519 --> 03:12:47.159]  By the way, I want to be clear.
[03:12:47.159 --> 03:12:50.181]  I am a libertarian, even though I don't approve of things like that and prostitution.
[03:12:50.181 --> 03:12:51.581]  I think it should be decriminalized.
[03:12:51.581 --> 03:12:57.664]  If Obama wanted six male prostitutes, I think that's his business.
[03:12:57.664 --> 03:12:58.684]  Okay?
[03:12:58.684 --> 03:13:05.687]  I just want to be clear that it's not a hot dog phobic rant here.
[03:13:05.687 --> 03:13:05.867]  What?
[03:13:07.008 --> 03:13:08.228]  I like dog-phobic Grant.
[03:13:08.228 --> 03:13:08.949]  That's pretty good.
[03:13:08.949 --> 03:13:09.869]  You like that?
[03:13:09.869 --> 03:13:10.709]  Dog-a-phobe?
[03:13:10.709 --> 03:13:12.570]  Dog-a-phobe.
[03:13:12.570 --> 03:13:14.750]  Let's get back to our callers.
[03:13:14.750 --> 03:13:16.951]  Though I am phobic of Lyndon Baines Johnson.
[03:13:16.951 --> 03:13:18.191]  Well, you should be there.
[03:13:18.191 --> 03:13:18.751]  I'm a Johnson-phobe.
[03:13:18.751 --> 03:13:19.392]  Jumbo.
[03:13:19.392 --> 03:13:20.272]  Jumbo.
[03:13:20.272 --> 03:13:21.492]  Oh, that was the nickname?
[03:13:21.492 --> 03:13:22.052]  Jumbo, yeah.
[03:13:22.052 --> 03:13:25.693]  I'm sorry.
[03:13:25.693 --> 03:13:27.874]  Hey, I'm not... I was a family show.
[03:13:27.874 --> 03:13:30.015]  They're the ones bringing all this out.
[03:13:30.015 --> 03:13:31.835]  And they're the ones doing all this.
[03:13:31.835 --> 03:13:33.136]  I said I'd go to phone calls.
[03:13:33.136 --> 03:13:34.076]  I will go to phone calls.
[03:13:35.145 --> 03:13:36.126]  Who's up next here?
[03:13:36.126 --> 03:13:37.767]  Dr. Kelly.
[03:13:37.767 --> 03:13:39.308]  Let's take Josh from Florida.
[03:13:39.308 --> 03:13:40.690]  Yes, let's let you call the callers.
[03:13:40.690 --> 03:13:41.250]  Let's take Josh.
[03:13:41.250 --> 03:13:42.771]  Josh in Florida, come on down.
[03:13:42.771 --> 03:13:43.292]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:13:43.292 --> 03:13:46.194]  Huge fan!
[03:13:46.194 --> 03:13:47.835]  Alex O'Rourke, can you hear me in Florida?
[03:13:47.835 --> 03:13:48.516]  Yes.
[03:13:48.516 --> 03:13:52.339]  Could somebody at a hot dog eating contest be $65,000 worth?
[03:13:52.339 --> 03:13:54.441]  One of those skinny Japanese guys, yeah.
[03:13:54.441 --> 03:13:54.981]  Yeah.
[03:13:54.981 --> 03:13:58.004]  Maybe he's training for a hot dog eating contest.
[03:13:58.004 --> 03:13:59.565]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:13:59.565 --> 03:14:03.028]  I wanted to comment quickly on the motivations of Mueller in the deep state.
[03:14:03.604 --> 03:14:09.186]  There's a lot of the pundits and the talk shows, they're caught up in the legalese.
[03:14:09.186 --> 03:14:14.387]  The left is against Putin, obviously, because of his pro-Christian, pro-patriarchal stance.
[03:14:14.387 --> 03:14:24.130]  But I don't think they comment enough on the fact that Putin whooped the deep state in Ukraine, Crimea, in Georgia, Ossetia, Abkhazia.
[03:14:24.130 --> 03:14:26.931]  And he's not a hot dog connoisseur!
[03:14:26.931 --> 03:14:29.732]  Yeah, in the Soviet time, in Vietnam, don't forget
[03:14:30.467 --> 03:14:40.113]  Mueller's a Vietnam veteran, and he's really engaged in a form of revenge porn, you know, against any non-Vietnam vets, anyone who's not pro-Deep State.
[03:14:40.113 --> 03:14:43.416]  And I just don't think the news analyzes his motivation.
[03:14:43.416 --> 03:14:53.142]  We know he's evil, but I don't think they take enough time to analyze his motivations, the geopolitics, the anti-Deep State activity that specific that Putin was involved in.
[03:14:53.906 --> 03:15:00.888]  In terms of the obsession with legalese, this country also needs to, you know, besides the Justice Department, we need a lot more legal reform.
[03:15:00.888 --> 03:15:01.908]  Real legal reform.
[03:15:01.908 --> 03:15:04.949]  I know Trump's had a good start with the regulations.
[03:15:04.949 --> 03:15:11.051]  Just remembering that our founding fathers, like George Washington, he was a civil engineer, a surveyor.
[03:15:11.051 --> 03:15:13.592]  Yeah, we got too many lawyers in Congress.
[03:15:16.286 --> 03:15:21.328]  Again, you've got to be a hot dog connoisseur to even get into a lot of their clubs.
[03:15:21.328 --> 03:15:27.070]  And again, that's all part of how they compromise the population.
[03:15:27.070 --> 03:15:28.991]  You know, that's a moral ed.
[03:15:28.991 --> 03:15:33.073]  But again, I think we need to focus on Mueller's motivations more.
[03:15:33.073 --> 03:15:36.954]  I have a high security comment with a Haiti twist.
[03:15:36.954 --> 03:15:39.015]  If there's any possibility to speak to one of your staff.
[03:15:39.454 --> 03:15:41.155]  Sure, we'll put you on hold and find out about that.
[03:15:41.155 --> 03:15:42.696]  All right, boom, boom, boom.

[03:15:49.561 --> 03:15:51.543]  Obama is training for a hot dog eating contest.
[03:15:53.226 --> 03:15:55.467]  You have been lied to.
[03:15:55.467 --> 03:15:57.187]  My name is Kevin Shipp.
[03:15:57.187 --> 03:15:59.888]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[03:15:59.888 --> 03:16:05.229]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[03:16:05.229 --> 03:16:10.911]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:16:10.911 --> 03:16:13.992]  We gotta get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.
[03:16:14.372 --> 03:16:17.454]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[03:21:03.874 --> 03:21:16.588]  Roger, you made a really good point during the break, as we get serious here, right before we go back to the calls, about the fact that Obama's been missing in action, and why he's missing in action, and how the Democrats don't have a leader.
[03:21:16.588 --> 03:21:17.669]  They think it's Joe Biden.
[03:21:18.450 --> 03:21:20.271]  Who's got his own issues.
[03:21:20.271 --> 03:21:21.552]  And then Hillary won't go away.
[03:21:21.552 --> 03:21:25.034]  She's still in control of the reins of it.
[03:21:25.034 --> 03:21:30.717]  The fact that they thought they could run the Crypt Keeper with a wig on Hillary and get away with this.
[03:21:30.717 --> 03:21:40.882]  They think Obama, after all Trump's successes and all their push polling and sampling 15% more Democrats in Gallup and Trump's at 54 in Gallup.
[03:21:40.882 --> 03:21:42.603]  You add 15 more points on that.
[03:21:43.143 --> 03:21:45.564]  Folks, we're almost at 70%.
[03:21:45.564 --> 03:21:47.585]  I mean, that is why they are in full panic mode.
[03:21:47.585 --> 03:21:51.346]  But why is Obama MIA?
[03:21:51.346 --> 03:21:52.387]  Two parts here.
[03:21:52.387 --> 03:21:57.409]  Yesterday, after you saw this, Bill Clinton in an interview says that the standards have changed regarding
[03:21:58.385 --> 03:22:00.486]  What you can do to another person.
[03:22:00.486 --> 03:22:05.228]  Meaning, I guess what he's saying is, rape was okay when I did it, but it's not okay today?
[03:22:05.228 --> 03:22:07.109]  I think that's what he was saying.
[03:22:07.109 --> 03:22:14.712]  So professional Democrats just want Bill and Hillary to go away, to get off the stage, to disappear.
[03:22:14.712 --> 03:22:21.375]  And correctly, they look at Barack Obama's poll numbers, and he is infinitely more popular than the Clintons.
[03:22:21.375 --> 03:22:25.097]  And he's the last elected Democratic President, so he's the
[03:22:25.777 --> 03:22:27.277]  Putative head of the department.
[03:22:27.277 --> 03:22:31.058]  And it's going to be a good move for them if they can get him out of the foxhole.
[03:22:31.058 --> 03:22:35.879]  But he's got his ass sticking up out of the foxhole looking for hot dogs down below.
[03:22:35.879 --> 03:22:37.959]  I think his problem is an obvious one.
[03:22:37.959 --> 03:22:43.280]  The Peter Strzok message that says the president wants to be kept up to date on this.
[03:22:43.280 --> 03:22:46.641]  The CYA memo by Susan Rice.
[03:22:46.641 --> 03:22:53.082]  I think we're going to find that the phony dossier at the end of the day that was created with the specific purpose
[03:22:53.662 --> 03:23:00.988]  of creating a phony rationale for the surveillance of Donald Trump's campaign was approved by Barack Obama himself.
[03:23:00.988 --> 03:23:03.310]  What did the president know, and when did he know?
[03:23:03.310 --> 03:23:08.955]  And the IG report says this in triplicate, and of course, confirming it, you never toot your horn.
[03:23:08.955 --> 03:23:10.015]  You were the first person
[03:23:10.956 --> 03:23:23.782]  When Trump was elected, and they were bragging about surveilling him in the news before they flipped it and said they never were, when Trump pointed out it was illegal, and there was nothing there, to say that you must go to the FISA court, it's illegal how they did it, it will bring them all down bigger than Watergate.
[03:23:23.782 --> 03:23:28.804]  I know you've told the President that many times, he's been tweeting that, it's all documented now, so where do we go?
[03:23:28.804 --> 03:23:36.948]  And our friend Judge Andrew Napolitano, who's been proven completely right about this, because the British did some of the dirty work here, in a classic
[03:23:37.848 --> 03:23:41.049]  Uh, a deep state move where we need deniability.
[03:23:41.049 --> 03:23:44.190]  We go to our allies and we have them doing the spying for us.
[03:23:44.190 --> 03:23:46.771]  So we can say, oh no, we didn't spy on anybody.
[03:23:46.771 --> 03:23:48.672]  No, we had the Brits do it.
[03:23:48.672 --> 03:23:52.193]  That standard procedure and the corporate media knows people don't study spycraft.
[03:23:52.193 --> 03:23:53.334]  They go, ridiculous!
[03:23:53.334 --> 03:23:55.114]  Why would the Brits be doing it?
[03:23:55.114 --> 03:23:55.895]  Oh my god!
[03:23:56.835 --> 03:24:06.078]  So the real question is, will Barack Obama ever be required to sit in front of a congressional committee under oath, where everybody can see and answer questions?
[03:24:06.078 --> 03:24:09.179]  Could you imagine the hot dog bandit in front of Congress?
[03:24:09.179 --> 03:24:16.642]  I could imagine the fact that he will lay, continually lay low on this whole thing, because I think he has ultimate culpability.
[03:24:17.522 --> 03:24:20.124]  He's been quarterbacking and he moved in a few miles from the White House.
[03:24:20.124 --> 03:24:23.585]  They admit running this whole op, suing you, suing the President.
[03:24:23.585 --> 03:24:28.988]  So yeah, we need to start talking about Obama facing his time in prison.
[03:24:28.988 --> 03:24:33.311]  It is certainly fair to say that none of this could have happened.
[03:24:33.311 --> 03:24:36.752]  As we Italians say, a fish rots from the head.
[03:24:36.752 --> 03:24:41.075]  The top man would have known about everything that was done here.
[03:24:41.075 --> 03:24:44.937]  And they needed an insurance policy to stop Donald Trump, as we have now learned.
[03:24:45.817 --> 03:24:50.322]  So, we're going to go to calls right now, but what ace in the hole do they have up their sleeve when we come back?
[03:24:50.322 --> 03:24:52.925]  And we're starting to win, but let's not be too confident.
[03:24:52.925 --> 03:24:58.571]  And then, let's just get into it, because the FBI is already asking, meaning they're digging around trying to make something up.
[03:24:58.571 --> 03:25:03.657]  I looked up the New York Times articles back when they liked Trump about, oh, he's divorced, you know, with ladies and Roger Stone.
[03:25:03.657 --> 03:25:06.520]  I said, is it true you were his wingman going back 40 years ago, off and on?
[03:25:07.020 --> 03:25:12.663]  And I remember you said, well yeah, only when he was in between divorces and then he wanted somebody to go out because he was real picky.
[03:25:12.663 --> 03:25:25.130]  He wanted to just take girls out and take them to dinner for a long time and, you know, if he had to go he wanted, you know, somebody to help, you know, go get rid... I mean, you told me some really cool stuff in confidence and it would be nice if you could just tell folks ahead of the time before they make something up.
[03:25:25.130 --> 03:25:26.151]  Well... We'll do it next segment.
[03:25:26.151 --> 03:25:26.951]  Alright.
[03:25:26.951 --> 03:25:27.952]  Think about what you want to talk about.
[03:25:27.952 --> 03:25:28.212]  Alright.
[03:25:28.212 --> 03:25:29.853]  This is a big exclusive here.
[03:25:29.853 --> 03:25:31.314]  Okay, who up next?
[03:25:31.314 --> 03:25:34.555]  Go ahead and call somebody else there.
[03:25:34.555 --> 03:25:35.536]  America's Back, Jason.
[03:25:37.312 --> 03:25:38.013]  Wanna go to Jason?
[03:25:38.013 --> 03:25:38.933]  Let's go to Jason.
[03:25:38.933 --> 03:25:40.454]  Let's go to Jason in Florida.
[03:25:40.454 --> 03:25:43.297]  Go ahead, Jason.
[03:25:43.297 --> 03:25:47.700]  Did we already hit Jason?
[03:25:47.700 --> 03:25:48.301]  Yes, we did.
[03:25:48.301 --> 03:25:49.141]  Okay, bye Jason.
[03:25:49.141 --> 03:25:49.862]  Sorry, I'm dumb.
[03:25:49.862 --> 03:25:52.404]  I wanted that number to look familiar, that name to look familiar.
[03:25:52.404 --> 03:25:53.985]  Let's go to Pastor Sam in Texas.
[03:25:53.985 --> 03:25:55.326]  Pastor Sam in Tejas.
[03:25:55.326 --> 03:25:56.107]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:25:57.907 --> 03:26:00.007]  I'm always ready to talk to you, gentlemen.
[03:26:00.007 --> 03:26:01.468]  Welcome back, Alex.
[03:26:01.468 --> 03:26:03.288]  Hope you had some good time with your family.
[03:26:03.288 --> 03:26:04.048]  I did.
[03:26:04.048 --> 03:26:08.189]  As far as the Empire striking back, we've done well.
[03:26:08.189 --> 03:26:09.489]  We've brought a lot of things to light.
[03:26:09.489 --> 03:26:11.990]  We've really given the enemy a bloody nose.
[03:26:11.990 --> 03:26:14.250]  And they are going to come out swinging.
[03:26:14.250 --> 03:26:21.952]  And I believe that the way that that's the typology that they'll follow is what was followed in what's known to history as the Spanish Civil War.
[03:26:22.632 --> 03:26:29.377]  It was really a war of conquest by the Roman world system, the fourth and terrible beast.
[03:26:29.377 --> 03:26:38.503]  But between 1932 and 1936, the nation of Spain declared itself independent and set up a representative republic.
[03:26:38.503 --> 03:26:41.205]  This was really the Brexit of its day.
[03:26:41.205 --> 03:26:41.906]  You're right.
[03:26:41.906 --> 03:26:45.008]  And you've studied that I'm sure.
[03:26:45.008 --> 03:26:47.049]  In this effort, this is where the
[03:26:49.294 --> 03:26:52.256]  The wickedness of the Catholic Church was really uncovered.
[03:26:52.256 --> 03:27:08.167]  You hear from time to time a whispered rumor that it's been found that there were tunnels between the supposedly celibate abbeys or nunneries and the seminaries where the supposedly celibate priests lived, and that they would go through those tunnels at night and have little liaisons.
[03:27:08.963 --> 03:27:16.950]  Where that was actually discovered was in Spain during this four-year period that they had a republic.
[03:27:16.950 --> 03:27:29.880]  And they also found that when the nuns became pregnant, this was before birth control and all that, that they were kept in cloister, the babies were brought to term, and many, many of them were asphyxiated and buried in the crypt.
[03:27:29.880 --> 03:27:37.307]  When the Spanish people found this out, they were so furious that a revolution against Catholic power and
[03:27:38.456 --> 03:27:40.718]  Monarchial imperial power started.
[03:27:40.718 --> 03:27:43.280]  It was very dangerous for them.
[03:27:43.280 --> 03:27:45.421]  It was very dangerous for the Pope.
[03:27:45.421 --> 03:27:49.224]  And so he counter-assaulted in three different ways.
[03:27:49.224 --> 03:27:53.327]  And it's very important, this is where we get the term, fifth column.
[03:27:53.327 --> 03:28:03.094]  General Francisco Franco, when he assaulted Madrid, he said he would assault Madrid with his four columns and a fifth column on the inside.
[03:28:03.094 --> 03:28:07.337]  That is, he said he had pre-placed infiltrators within the city.
[03:28:08.058 --> 03:28:13.424]  So, the three ways that they... First of all, it was a pedophilia, child murder and sacrifice.
[03:28:13.424 --> 03:28:15.666]  That was going on then, and it's going on now.
[03:28:15.666 --> 03:28:18.989]  Now that we've discovered it, the enemy has to come out and fight.
[03:28:18.989 --> 03:28:26.057]  The second thing was, this war was billed as a war against communist revolutionaries.
[03:28:26.537 --> 03:28:32.201]  You know, it's just 10 years, 15 years before that Russia had been taken over by the Bolsheviks.
[03:28:32.201 --> 03:28:36.583]  And so, in the world, public opinion was against communism.
[03:28:36.583 --> 03:28:44.848]  So, Franco's armies, which were Muslim hordes, attacked in the name of crushing a communist revolution.
[03:28:44.848 --> 03:28:45.929]  Although it was not.
[03:28:45.929 --> 03:28:48.250]  Alright, that is a whole other giant subject.
[03:28:48.250 --> 03:28:49.351]  Very interesting.
[03:28:49.351 --> 03:28:50.271]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:50.271 --> 03:28:50.712]  Stay with us.
[03:28:54.008 --> 03:29:03.211]  Now that we're heading home after an adventurous day of sun and fun, I realize the glow in the backseat isn't coming from the kids' screens, it's actually coming from the kids.
[03:29:03.211 --> 03:29:10.273]  That's because my well-meaning but easily distracted hubby didn't use enough sunscreen on my poor, burned offspring.
[03:29:10.273 --> 03:29:13.274]  Moms, don't let summer sun ruin your summer fun.
[03:29:13.274 --> 03:29:16.995]  That's why I use Topperson Afterburn Cream, and you should too!
[03:29:16.995 --> 03:29:23.497]  Topperson Afterburn Cream moisturizes and soothes the skin with 14 biomedicines, including Arnica and Echinacea.
[03:29:23.997 --> 03:29:30.560]  And is proven to help reduce the symptoms associated with sunburn, windburn, blisters, even scrapes and bug bites.

[03:29:40.725 --> 03:29:45.648]  So if you're like me and want the best for your family, chase the burn away with Topperson Afterburn Cream.

[03:29:51.170 --> 03:29:51.851]  Topperson.
[03:29:51.851 --> 03:29:52.231]  Rub it in.
[03:29:54.141 --> 03:30:01.829]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[03:30:01.829 --> 03:30:02.309]  It's you!
[03:30:03.399 --> 03:30:05.600]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[03:30:05.600 --> 03:30:14.323]  It is you, the info warriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[03:30:14.323 --> 03:30:18.904]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:30:18.904 --> 03:30:20.345]  You are the info war.
[03:30:20.345 --> 03:30:23.866]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[03:30:24.566 --> 03:30:35.933]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:30:35.933 --> 03:30:43.919]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[03:30:43.919 --> 03:30:50.963]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:30:50.963 --> 03:30:53.705]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[03:30:54.795 --> 03:30:59.377]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:30:59.377 --> 03:30:59.937]  Thanks for holding.
[03:30:59.937 --> 03:31:01.378]  Hey Alex, mate.
[03:31:01.378 --> 03:31:04.979]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[03:31:04.979 --> 03:31:13.723]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[03:31:13.763 --> 03:31:30.193]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[03:31:30.513 --> 03:31:39.102]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[03:31:39.102 --> 03:31:44.008]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[03:31:44.008 --> 03:31:49.573]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[03:31:54.264 --> 03:31:58.225]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:58.225 --> 03:32:01.506]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:01.506 --> 03:32:07.768]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:07.768 --> 03:32:10.549]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:32:11.289 --> 03:32:15.114]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:15.114 --> 03:32:21.582]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.582 --> 03:32:26.547]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:27.287 --> 03:32:31.209]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:32:31.209 --> 03:32:38.412]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.412 --> 03:32:43.634]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:43.634 --> 03:32:49.316]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:49.316 --> 03:32:53.298]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:57.247 --> 03:32:59.876]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.352 --> 03:33:20.794]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[03:33:20.794 --> 03:33:27.176]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:27.176 --> 03:33:32.499]  You still think that jet fuel brought down the World Trade Center?
[03:33:32.499 --> 03:33:34.980]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[03:33:34.980 --> 03:33:41.502]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[03:33:41.502 --> 03:33:43.423]  This story does not add up.
[03:34:00.655 --> 03:34:07.200]  Gentlemen, we're about to overthrow the globalist occupational government and restore the republic and launch a worldwide operation for freedom.
[03:34:07.200 --> 03:34:08.581]  Are you ready?
[03:34:08.581 --> 03:34:11.403]  Our weapon's the truth, the enemy is the lie.
[03:34:11.403 --> 03:34:12.184]  Let's take action.
[03:34:12.184 --> 03:34:16.407]  Alright, we're going back to your phone calls.
[03:34:16.407 --> 03:34:20.650]  In the next segment, Roger will... He doesn't want to talk about the Trump stuff.
[03:34:20.650 --> 03:34:22.512]  He didn't tell me, by the way,
[03:34:23.934 --> 03:34:24.314]  Anything.
[03:34:24.314 --> 03:34:26.676]  I just said, hey, I did a lot of research on Trump.
[03:34:26.676 --> 03:34:28.177]  Are these New York Times articles accurate?
[03:34:28.177 --> 03:34:29.038]  You're his wingman.
[03:34:29.038 --> 03:34:34.001]  You know, during divorces, he would be seen out with you and, you know, women.
[03:34:34.001 --> 03:34:36.783]  And then he was very particular about a bond, treated women very nice.
[03:34:36.783 --> 03:34:38.844]  And he said, yeah, no, that's back when they liked him.
[03:34:38.844 --> 03:34:41.666]  And those are true articles, you know, about Trump.
[03:34:41.666 --> 03:34:42.647]  And I said, well, how do you treat women?
[03:34:42.647 --> 03:34:44.268]  Well, you said really, really nice and all the rest of it.
[03:34:44.268 --> 03:34:44.989]  So why don't we just
[03:34:45.725 --> 03:34:46.365]  We're going to go to calls.
[03:34:46.365 --> 03:34:55.787]  Let's just get to that now since I've built it up and talk about that because like you said, the big news is the FBI is coming to you.
[03:34:55.787 --> 03:34:57.788]  They're coming to your associates.
[03:34:57.788 --> 03:35:07.570]  They're bringing me up a lot, but now they've moved from that into 13, 14 people they brought me up to and that we're all these masterminds running everything, which isn't true.
[03:35:08.670 --> 03:35:10.672]  We just want freedom, common sense stuff.
[03:35:10.672 --> 03:35:13.514]  And then now they're getting into going back decades ago.
[03:35:13.514 --> 03:35:15.595]  Nothing to do with Russia, nothing to do with anything.
[03:35:15.595 --> 03:35:16.416]  Not even taxes.
[03:35:16.416 --> 03:35:22.720]  It's all... Well, what are the questions that you're hearing that the FBI is asking about Roger Stone, Donald Trump, and women?
[03:35:22.720 --> 03:35:26.323]  Well, it's more about Donald Trump and women.
[03:35:26.323 --> 03:35:37.211]  Some of my associates were asked this, but other people I know who have been questioned by the FBI in the Mueller probe have told me that there seems to be a focus on the President's relationship with women.
[03:35:37.751 --> 03:35:39.672]  I'm not going to talk about that.
[03:35:39.672 --> 03:35:40.573]  Ever.
[03:35:40.573 --> 03:35:43.775]  I'm not going to talk out of school about the President.
[03:35:43.775 --> 03:35:46.977]  I don't know anything that would be detrimental to him.
[03:35:46.977 --> 03:35:53.582]  And the idea that they would cook up some offense against me as an effort to get me to roll on the President.
[03:35:54.483 --> 03:35:56.705]  Is probably what they have in mind.
[03:35:56.705 --> 03:35:59.288]  But I have proven there is no Russian collusion.
[03:35:59.288 --> 03:36:01.291]  There is no WikiLeaks collusion.
[03:36:01.291 --> 03:36:03.734]  I didn't know about John Podesta's email in advance.
[03:36:03.734 --> 03:36:05.356]  There's no evidence of that.
[03:36:05.356 --> 03:36:08.359]  I never paid for or bought any information.
[03:36:08.359 --> 03:36:11.703]  Everything I did in connection with the presidential election was legal.
[03:36:12.344 --> 03:36:13.445]  I'm not the target here.
[03:36:13.445 --> 03:36:15.526]  The President is the target.
[03:36:15.526 --> 03:36:19.167]  But it's put me and my family under enormous pressure.
[03:36:19.167 --> 03:36:25.691]  Think of having a runaway federal prosecutor in every molecule of your being, reading your emails.
[03:36:25.691 --> 03:36:27.471]  But to be specific, they're really desperate.
[03:36:27.471 --> 03:36:29.152]  But you didn't tell me any secrets.
[03:36:29.152 --> 03:36:31.473]  I just had some New York Times articles over the phone.
[03:36:31.473 --> 03:36:32.414]  And I said, is this accurate?
[03:36:32.414 --> 03:36:32.994]  Is that accurate?
[03:36:32.994 --> 03:36:35.195]  Because, hell, that was even during the campaign.
[03:36:35.195 --> 03:36:37.777]  I wanted to make sure I wasn't betting on the wrong horse or something wouldn't come out.
[03:36:37.777 --> 03:36:38.277]  And you said, listen.
[03:36:38.877 --> 03:36:39.938]  He treats women really great.
[03:36:39.938 --> 03:36:41.239]  He puts them on a pedestal.
[03:36:41.239 --> 03:36:44.561]  He puts them through this whole courtship thing, because he's a germophobe.
[03:36:44.561 --> 03:36:46.723]  And, you know, the fact that he'd be even promiscuous as bull.
[03:36:46.723 --> 03:36:47.523]  He is a playboy.
[03:36:47.523 --> 03:36:49.244]  He dated a lot of women when he's divorced.
[03:36:49.244 --> 03:36:51.426]  He treats them really great.
[03:36:51.426 --> 03:36:52.907]  And the taste level is extraordinary.
[03:36:52.907 --> 03:36:54.188]  I mean, he dated supermodels.
[03:36:54.188 --> 03:36:55.949]  Well, I was about to say, but then you told me a little more.
[03:36:55.949 --> 03:36:56.510]  You said that...
[03:36:57.954 --> 03:37:00.917]  But if they give him any trouble or act weird, he didn't put up with that either.
[03:37:00.917 --> 03:37:02.879]  I mean, just in general, you were his friend.
[03:37:02.879 --> 03:37:03.619]  You were his wingman.
[03:37:03.619 --> 03:37:04.740]  You're not going to give him secrets.
[03:37:04.740 --> 03:37:07.863]  Just in general, Trump's relationship to women, how does he treat them?
[03:37:07.863 --> 03:37:08.884]  Extraordinary.
[03:37:08.884 --> 03:37:17.993]  And his taste level, I mean, Melania, his wife, who's a wonderful person, is typical of the kind of woman that he dated in between marriages.
[03:37:17.993 --> 03:37:19.555]  And she was, of course, the woman he chose.
[03:37:19.555 --> 03:37:21.477]  Because you've got tens, but you've also got
[03:37:23.238 --> 03:37:24.160]  10-10-10, like in gymnastics.
[03:37:24.160 --> 03:37:26.242]  I mean, it's solid 10s across the board.
[03:37:26.242 --> 03:37:26.802]  She's smart.
[03:37:26.802 --> 03:37:27.383]  She's beautiful.
[03:37:27.383 --> 03:37:27.964]  She's cool.
[03:37:27.964 --> 03:37:29.966]  Her presence is amazing.
[03:37:29.966 --> 03:37:30.707]  Supermodels.
[03:37:30.707 --> 03:37:35.052]  He had a tendency to date supermodels, and he wasn't shy about it.
[03:37:35.052 --> 03:37:36.854]  And he was enormously discreet.
[03:37:36.854 --> 03:37:38.816]  He is a gentleman.
[03:37:38.816 --> 03:37:40.138]  Beyond that, I'm not gonna go.
[03:37:42.108 --> 03:37:44.570]  But never anything about roughing women up.
[03:37:44.570 --> 03:37:45.791]  Never a problem.
[03:37:45.791 --> 03:37:46.491]  Not his thing.
[03:37:46.491 --> 03:37:48.573]  Well, they've been all over everything with a fine-tooth comb.
[03:37:48.573 --> 03:37:49.393]  There's nothing there.
[03:37:49.393 --> 03:37:57.639]  That's why the rudimentary idea in this ridiculous dossier that he would somehow enjoy watching women urinate on each other, that's not Donald Trump.
[03:37:57.639 --> 03:37:59.260]  That's not his thing.
[03:37:59.260 --> 03:38:01.382]  He would find that disgusting.
[03:38:01.382 --> 03:38:03.083]  That's what's so outrageous about it.
[03:38:03.083 --> 03:38:05.165]  It's not even credible as an idea.
[03:38:06.167 --> 03:38:10.109]  So, he was one of the great playboys of all time.
[03:38:10.109 --> 03:38:12.751]  He's not into degrading women, for sure.
[03:38:12.751 --> 03:38:16.133]  And he's not into the stuff that Democrats and people are into.
[03:38:17.602 --> 03:38:19.142]  The whole scatological thing.
[03:38:19.142 --> 03:38:20.463]  Definitely not.
[03:38:20.463 --> 03:38:23.584]  He is an admitted germophobe.
[03:38:23.584 --> 03:38:35.347]  When he thought about running for president in 2000, very briefly, which he would tell you today was more my idea than his, he went through about a gallon of Purell a day for hand cleansing.
[03:38:35.347 --> 03:38:38.328]  Let's talk about the subject of black people.
[03:38:39.048 --> 03:38:41.390]  All the rappers that knew him well said they loved him.
[03:38:41.390 --> 03:38:45.314]  He opened the golf courses up to black folks 40-something years ago and Jews.
[03:38:45.314 --> 03:38:47.836]  Why did hip-hop say he was the coolest white guy ever?
[03:38:47.836 --> 03:38:50.338]  And then now he claims he's a racist, which none of it's true with any proof.
[03:38:50.338 --> 03:38:51.840]  Donald Trump likes energy.
[03:38:54.662 --> 03:38:57.644]  He likes exciting people and he really likes black people.
[03:38:57.644 --> 03:38:59.065]  There's no question about that.
[03:38:59.065 --> 03:39:01.686]  And he's in all these rap songs.
[03:39:01.686 --> 03:39:08.110]  What's interesting is a poll yesterday showing that his improvement rating among younger blacks is really increasing.
[03:39:08.110 --> 03:39:10.731]  And that's got to drive the Democrats insane.
[03:39:10.731 --> 03:39:12.432]  I think that's Dennis Rodman.
[03:39:12.432 --> 03:39:14.274]  I think that that's Kanye West.
[03:39:14.274 --> 03:39:17.095]  I think it is people thinking for themselves.
[03:39:17.095 --> 03:39:17.636]  Well, let me tell you.
[03:39:18.696 --> 03:39:21.540]  Elon Musk and Kanye are getting harassed behind the scenes.
[03:39:21.540 --> 03:39:24.503]  Hell, they threw Kanye in a mental institution for a week and a half.
[03:39:24.503 --> 03:39:26.145]  And I'm not supposed to get into all this.
[03:39:26.145 --> 03:39:27.126]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[03:39:27.126 --> 03:39:30.830]  But like, everybody saw Matt Drudge just magically show up here with me unannounced.
[03:39:31.755 --> 03:39:33.476]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:39:33.476 --> 03:39:35.537]  Um, gotcha.
[03:39:35.537 --> 03:39:37.397]  So, but, but, but there's a lot of stuff going on.
[03:39:37.397 --> 03:39:42.779]  These people are really awake and, and they understand the ball game.
[03:39:42.779 --> 03:39:44.400]  And Kanye was awake like five years ago.
[03:39:44.400 --> 03:39:50.983]  I now know, but he's really awake now and they'd been messing with him behind the scenes and it's making him do the opposite.
[03:39:50.983 --> 03:39:53.824]  They're, they're threatening and doing stuff and it's not making him back down.
[03:39:55.103 --> 03:40:00.427]  The guy's an incredible artist, and he's got an incredible forum, and he's driving them crazy.
[03:40:00.427 --> 03:40:01.608]  Driving them crazy.
[03:40:01.608 --> 03:40:03.569]  Alex, I want to take a call from Susan.
[03:40:03.569 --> 03:40:04.250]  Yes, let's do it.
[03:40:04.250 --> 03:40:06.472]  Susan, and then Elissa.
[03:40:06.472 --> 03:40:07.813]  Susan, thanks for holding your trooper.
[03:40:07.813 --> 03:40:08.213]  God bless.
[03:40:08.213 --> 03:40:08.533]  Go ahead.
[03:40:08.533 --> 03:40:10.655]  Hi, guys.
[03:40:10.655 --> 03:40:11.335]  Hi, Alex.
[03:40:11.335 --> 03:40:11.996]  Hi, Roger.
[03:40:11.996 --> 03:40:13.377]  Just two quick things.
[03:40:14.110 --> 03:40:14.810]  Thank you.
[03:40:30.822 --> 03:40:37.567]  I just wanted to ask Roger if he was still doing his book signing, and I wasn't sure where to send my book.
[03:40:37.567 --> 03:40:38.147]  Absolutely.
[03:40:38.147 --> 03:40:50.115]  So you buy your book at the Infowars.com site and you mail it to me at 1007 North Federal Highway, number 166, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33304.
[03:40:50.115 --> 03:40:51.216]  Let me do it again.
[03:40:51.216 --> 03:40:51.956]  1007 North Federal Highway,
[03:40:56.852 --> 03:41:02.037]  Number 166, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 3-3-3-0-4.
[03:41:02.037 --> 03:41:08.563]  Anybody who buys a book at the InfoWars site and says that in their package, I will sign it and mail it back to you at my own expense.
[03:41:16.630 --> 03:41:17.391]  Thank you, sir.
[03:41:37.586 --> 03:41:38.726]  That was really it.
[03:41:38.726 --> 03:41:41.107]  I just wanted to say how much these products have changed.
[03:41:58.415 --> 03:42:00.197]  My life, the brain force especially.
[03:42:00.197 --> 03:42:08.904]  I'm an artist and I work from home and I have a couple kids and that actually helps keep me focused and gives me energy and the iodine has improved my skin.
[03:42:08.904 --> 03:42:16.451]  I'm almost 43 years old and I've noticed a huge change and I just wanted to ask Roger about his book and I've just been listening.
[03:42:16.451 --> 03:42:18.072]  You guys are cracking me up today.
[03:42:18.072 --> 03:42:20.574]  Describe how long did it take for the iodine to kick in.
[03:42:20.574 --> 03:42:21.455]  I want to say a couple weeks.
[03:42:26.019 --> 03:42:31.721]  And I started noticing, like, just looking in the mirror, like, I don't look quite as old as I did.
[03:42:31.721 --> 03:42:35.682]  I don't have that many wrinkles anyway, but... Well, it's simple.
[03:42:35.682 --> 03:42:36.862]  If you don't have oxygen, you die.
[03:42:36.862 --> 03:42:37.723]  If you don't have water, you die.
[03:42:37.723 --> 03:42:39.983]  If you don't have vitamin C or iodine, you die.
[03:42:39.983 --> 03:42:42.844]  And they have lowered the levels of what they say you need.
[03:42:42.844 --> 03:42:44.845]  It's one of the biggest conspiracies against humanity.
[03:42:44.845 --> 03:42:46.245]  God bless you, Susan.
[03:42:46.245 --> 03:42:50.367]  Alright, we'll be back with Phil, Scott, Elisa, Dr. Kelly, and others.

[03:46:24.638 --> 03:46:25.038]  I think so.
[03:46:57.125 --> 03:47:06.648]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:06.648 --> 03:47:24.194]  Regrets I've had a few But then again Too few to mention I did What I had to do Saw it
[03:47:27.924 --> 03:47:29.485]  I did it my way.
[03:47:29.485 --> 03:47:34.429]  The great blue eyes, Frank Sinatra.
[03:47:58.132 --> 03:48:00.493]  And, you know, you've done it your way, I've done it my way.
[03:48:00.493 --> 03:48:03.175]  The audience has done it their way, betting on Infowars.
[03:48:03.175 --> 03:48:04.216]  And we're not just saying this.
[03:48:04.216 --> 03:48:07.758]  Everybody hypes things up like they're the tip of the spear, they're the vanguard.
[03:48:07.758 --> 03:48:09.419]  We're fighting globalism.
[03:48:09.419 --> 03:48:11.180]  It's in decline.
[03:48:11.180 --> 03:48:15.922]  But we're in that epic battle where we're just starting to get the initiative on them.
[03:48:15.922 --> 03:48:16.483]  They know it.
[03:48:16.483 --> 03:48:18.484]  They're putting their full force back.
[03:48:18.484 --> 03:48:23.427]  Everything they do is turning to piles of steaming Barack Obama.
[03:48:23.427 --> 03:48:26.949]  But at the same time, we can't overestimate our strength.
[03:48:28.326 --> 03:48:33.287]  And I'm going to go back to your calls, Roger, I wanted to ask you about any other ace in the holes you think they've got.
[03:48:33.287 --> 03:48:35.848]  You know, there are thousands of ideologies in hell.
[03:48:35.848 --> 03:48:38.729]  There's probably 100,000 religions just in India alone.
[03:48:38.729 --> 03:48:42.970]  There's all these world systems and most of them are based on pure quackery.
[03:48:42.970 --> 03:48:46.471]  I follow Renaissance, free open societies, Americana.
[03:48:46.471 --> 03:48:50.292]  It's proven to be the gold standard, the platinum standard, the ethereal standard.
[03:48:51.328 --> 03:48:52.849]  The infinity standard.
[03:48:52.849 --> 03:48:54.129]  The next level standard.
[03:48:54.129 --> 03:48:56.170]  The stairway to heaven standard.
[03:48:56.170 --> 03:49:01.311]  And we've proven by pushing, just with what you've done and others in the audience, we're changing the world.
[03:49:01.311 --> 03:49:04.912]  We are the ideology trumping them.
[03:49:04.912 --> 03:49:06.213]  Not just here, but all over the world.
[03:49:06.213 --> 03:49:12.095]  We are playing royal flush and ace of spades every hand.
[03:49:12.095 --> 03:49:14.075]  Because we were underdogs.
[03:49:14.075 --> 03:49:17.277]  And if folks don't see the hand of God on that, they're not paying attention.
[03:49:17.277 --> 03:49:18.537]  That's why I'm asking listeners.
[03:49:19.912 --> 03:49:22.173]  You're doing it your way, the American way.
[03:49:22.173 --> 03:49:25.114]  But that's why the left calls themselves the American way.
[03:49:25.114 --> 03:49:26.214]  They're the globalist way.
[03:49:26.214 --> 03:49:28.735]  It's always upside down with them.
[03:49:28.735 --> 03:49:48.022]  When you spread the word about the broadcast hand-to-hand, mouth-to-mouth, ear-to-ear, person-to-person, when you share the videos, the articles, when you sign up for the free newsletter, Infowars.com newsletter, when you buy the products, when you support our local affiliates by becoming a sponsor, spreading the word, or supporting the sponsors, you change the world.
[03:49:49.121 --> 03:49:53.765]  And that's why we've got StoneDefenseFund.com, where you can go donate directly.
[03:49:53.765 --> 03:49:57.328]  He's under being sued by Obama, the globalists trying to shut him down.
[03:49:57.328 --> 03:50:11.821]  If we can crush them on this, StoneDefenseFund.com, we can truly see the fall of the deep state, because they admit their attack on Roger, Trump, and myself is a beta test for everybody else to come after us, even bigger targets like drugs.
[03:50:11.821 --> 03:50:14.884]  So, AlexJonesLegalFund.com,
[03:50:15.962 --> 03:50:17.804]  AlexJonesLegalFund.com, one word.
[03:50:17.804 --> 03:50:19.465]  We have links on InfoWars.com.
[03:50:19.465 --> 03:50:24.770]  You can go there and just donate directly, whether it's $25 or $100, or folks that are middle class and wealthy.
[03:50:24.770 --> 03:50:31.877]  You could not invest somewhere with money that will be used to go after the globalists fearlessly.
[03:50:31.877 --> 03:50:32.498]  You cannot
[03:50:33.530 --> 03:50:39.816]  If you were dynamiting globalist bridges because they were invading your town, you couldn't, for the money, buy better dynamite.
[03:50:39.816 --> 03:50:41.798]  Alex, I think it's important people understand.
[03:50:41.798 --> 03:50:43.580]  We're not hyping this.
[03:50:43.580 --> 03:50:45.121]  They want to bankrupt him.
[03:50:45.121 --> 03:50:46.883]  They want to close Infowars down.
[03:50:46.883 --> 03:50:48.704]  They want to shutter this place.
[03:50:48.704 --> 03:50:52.348]  They want to put me in jail because I supported Donald Trump.
[03:50:52.348 --> 03:50:53.749]  This is a real fight, folks.
[03:50:53.749 --> 03:50:54.970]  We need your help.
[03:50:54.970 --> 03:50:56.452]  And by the way, since you say that,
[03:50:59.242 --> 03:51:07.328]  Even a few months ago when they finally had like a whole bunch of Washington Post, New York Times saying, the war on Alex Jones, the legal war, the plan, we're going to destroy him.
[03:51:07.328 --> 03:51:08.349]  George Towns sued me.
[03:51:08.349 --> 03:51:10.490]  All of them, they go, wow, you're not joking.
[03:51:10.490 --> 03:51:12.912]  What, you think I've ever joked with you about anything?
[03:51:12.912 --> 03:51:15.594]  We don't make stuff up like everybody else.
[03:51:15.594 --> 03:51:16.775]  It's straight shooting, man.
[03:51:16.775 --> 03:51:18.256]  You get what's going on.
[03:51:19.036 --> 03:51:23.444]  By somebody that doesn't sit around and act like they know what's going on, I research.
[03:51:23.444 --> 03:51:24.445]  Okay?
[03:51:24.445 --> 03:51:26.509]  And so, yes, we need your financial support.
[03:51:26.509 --> 03:51:30.796]  Free shipping ends this weekend, 50% off by selling items, but you can also just donate straight.
[03:51:31.553 --> 03:51:37.118]  Ladies and gentlemen, at AlexJonesLegalFund.com or StoneDefenseFund.com for him as well.
[03:51:37.118 --> 03:51:38.159]  Roger, go ahead.
[03:51:38.159 --> 03:51:40.701]  So, people need to understand, this is a real fight.
[03:51:40.701 --> 03:51:43.563]  We're not just hyping this to build a war chest.
[03:51:43.563 --> 03:51:48.767]  As it is, Alex Jones takes everything that comes in through the store and he puts it back into the expansion.
[03:51:48.767 --> 03:51:51.430]  I've seen the incredible new studios that are coming online here.
[03:51:51.430 --> 03:51:58.836]  Well, I squirreled 5% away knowing this was coming for about four years, which really pisses him off because we can fight him for a while.
[03:51:59.136 --> 03:52:00.317]  I'm just looking long term.
[03:52:00.317 --> 03:52:02.860]  We've got to not get into the war chest.
[03:52:02.860 --> 03:52:04.041]  That's emergency backup.
[03:52:04.041 --> 03:52:05.682]  I'm now in reserve funds.
[03:52:05.682 --> 03:52:07.284]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:52:07.284 --> 03:52:09.166]  I'm giving folks a point blank report.
[03:52:09.166 --> 03:52:12.449]  Even though I don't want Soros to know what's going on, I have to be truthful with you.
[03:52:12.449 --> 03:52:13.770]  I'm asking for your help.
[03:52:13.770 --> 03:52:15.532]  I'm being sued by the DNC.
[03:52:15.532 --> 03:52:17.814]  I'm being sued by Obama's group.
[03:52:18.714 --> 03:52:29.338]  I've got a special prosecutor poking into every molecule of my being, searching for some bogus conjured up crime so he can pressure me into testifying.
[03:52:29.338 --> 03:52:35.540]  And in your statement a few weeks ago, you said, I'll never roll on President Trump because I'm loyal and because he never did anything.
[03:52:35.540 --> 03:52:36.501]  There's nothing there.
[03:52:36.501 --> 03:52:37.521]  Headlines everywhere.
[03:52:37.521 --> 03:52:40.222]  Stone admits he's got dirt, but says he won't roll.
[03:52:40.222 --> 03:52:45.824]  They took what you said in your message that took two minutes on air here and directly inverted it.
[03:52:46.164 --> 03:52:54.610]  Yeah, exactly, because what they do, as you know, Alex, is they pressure people into saying things that are not true.
[03:52:54.610 --> 03:52:56.031]  That are not true.
[03:52:56.031 --> 03:53:00.435]  You see, if you read this guy's story, and this guy, Jonathan Chayotte, I wrote a long piece on him.
[03:53:00.435 --> 03:53:04.157]  He's the single most duplicitous, dishonest reporter in America today.
[03:53:04.157 --> 03:53:07.280]  I said, I'm no John Dean.
[03:53:07.280 --> 03:53:08.881]  He thinks John Dean's a hero.
[03:53:08.881 --> 03:53:15.106]  If he'd read my book, he would understand that John Dean is the man who planned, pushed, lied about, and covered up the Watergate break-in.
[03:53:15.986 --> 03:53:18.107]  I am not going to be John Dean.
[03:53:18.107 --> 03:53:20.129]  You're not going to manufacture crap.
[03:53:20.129 --> 03:53:20.729]  Exactly.
[03:53:20.729 --> 03:53:24.691]  I won't make stuff up, but that's what they try to pressure you to do.
[03:53:24.691 --> 03:53:33.096]  All these young people who have worked for me, who are being squeezed right now by the special prosecutor, they're being pressured to say things that aren't true.
[03:53:33.096 --> 03:53:36.658]  That is the concern that we have.
[03:53:36.658 --> 03:53:37.419]  Absolutely.
[03:53:37.419 --> 03:53:38.299]  All right.
[03:53:38.299 --> 03:53:40.741]  Eliza, did I pronounce it?
[03:53:40.741 --> 03:53:42.942]  In Oregon, thanks for holding your real trooper.
[03:53:42.942 --> 03:53:44.703]  Elisa, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:53:45.902 --> 03:53:47.663]  Hey, you got it right!
[03:53:47.663 --> 03:53:53.607]  A lot of people don't get my name right, but it's good to be on the phone with both you and with Roger Stone.
[03:53:53.607 --> 03:53:56.989]  I have a lot of respect for both of you gentlemen.
[03:53:56.989 --> 03:53:58.070]  Thank you.
[03:53:58.070 --> 03:54:09.137]  As some kind of act of providence, you know, I was actually going to call in not only to talk about the IG report, but also to ask you if you could get Mark Taylor on as a guest, and somebody beat me to the punch.
[03:54:09.137 --> 03:54:12.139]  But here's the thing.
[03:54:12.139 --> 03:54:15.241]  I don't know if you're still in contact with Larry Nichols or not.
[03:54:15.919 --> 03:54:23.521]  I do know that if you're trying to get a hold of Mark Taylor to get him on your show, I know that Larry Nichols has been in contact with Mark Taylor.
[03:54:23.521 --> 03:54:27.542]  You know, it's time to get Larry Nichols back on anyway, especially during the 34-hour broadcast.
[03:54:27.542 --> 03:54:30.183]  So let's see if Larry can pop on today separately.
[03:54:30.183 --> 03:54:31.423]  How are we doing with Mark Taylor?
[03:54:31.423 --> 03:54:32.544]  I've been wanting him for about a week.
[03:54:32.544 --> 03:54:35.744]  Are we going to get him?
[03:54:35.744 --> 03:54:36.385]  We're working on it.
[03:54:36.385 --> 03:54:37.025]  Go ahead.
[03:54:37.025 --> 03:54:39.465]  We've reached out to Taylor.
[03:54:39.465 --> 03:54:40.786]  Oh, that's awesome.
[03:54:40.786 --> 03:54:45.247]  And I don't know if you guys know about this, but there is a movie
[03:54:45.880 --> 03:54:51.045]  Yeah, I think it's coming out October 4th and 5th and so I want to get the word out about that as well.
[03:54:51.045 --> 03:54:52.727]  And he also has a book called The Trump Prophecies too.
[03:55:03.471 --> 03:55:08.935]  So if people want to spread the word about that, I think it's a good... Yeah, we're working to get him on.
[03:55:08.935 --> 03:55:12.697]  We've been working for a week to get him on, so we just got to get him into a slot, get him on.
[03:55:12.697 --> 03:55:13.197]  Absolutely.
[03:55:13.197 --> 03:55:17.220]  What do you think about the... I'd like to actually call in on the subject I listed about IG report.
[03:55:17.220 --> 03:55:22.143]  What do you make of its double speaking behavior and what do you think is going on there?
[03:55:22.143 --> 03:55:23.784]  Well, here's the thing.
[03:55:23.784 --> 03:55:29.408]  I mean, there was a part of me that was like really excited because I thought, you know, because everybody was saying,
[03:55:30.897 --> 03:55:38.384]  Oh, this guy, you know, he's an Obama appointee, but he's not a biased person, you know?
[03:55:38.384 --> 03:55:52.698]  And I see his report, and all these leaks that are coming out of it, they're damaging, and they're spot-on, and then he puts out this almost James Comey-like statement, like, oh, we have all these crimes here, but we're not going to do anything about it, kind of thing.
[03:55:53.058 --> 03:55:55.399]  Well, yeah, but see, that's what I'm saying is you have to look at it.
[03:55:55.399 --> 03:56:03.741]  It's damning information that Obama was involved in the illegal secret server and lied about it and that they were trying to stop Trump and trying to... That's all totally confirming.
[03:56:03.741 --> 03:56:05.382]  Then they say, oh, but none of it's criminal.
[03:56:05.382 --> 03:56:06.862]  Well, that's not their job to even say that.
[03:56:06.862 --> 03:56:07.862]  What do you think the point of that?
[03:56:07.862 --> 03:56:08.482]  Thank you, ma'am.
[03:56:08.482 --> 03:56:09.023]  Appreciate you.
[03:56:09.023 --> 03:56:10.283]  What do you think the point of that is?
[03:56:11.598 --> 03:56:13.238]  Where is Jeff Sessions?
[03:56:13.238 --> 03:56:14.239]  Where is he today?
[03:56:14.239 --> 03:56:17.680]  Why hasn't he announced prosecutions against those who have broken the law?
[03:56:17.680 --> 03:56:19.400]  Why is he entirely silent?
[03:56:19.400 --> 03:56:22.961]  It all keeps coming back to the Keebler elf himself.
[03:56:22.961 --> 03:56:33.004]  The President needs to replace Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein and get himself an Attorney General who's committed to the rule of law and will hold these people accountable.
[03:56:33.004 --> 03:56:35.344]  This was a bureaucratic exercise yesterday.
[03:56:35.344 --> 03:56:36.264]  That's a good point though.
[03:56:36.264 --> 03:56:37.685]  I mean, what's wrong with the Keebler?
[03:56:38.525 --> 03:56:40.186]  Nothing will come of this.
[03:56:40.186 --> 03:56:43.048]  So we learned bombshell things yesterday.
[03:56:43.048 --> 03:56:46.490]  Comey, others, blatant illegality.
[03:56:46.490 --> 03:56:49.752]  I still predict that nobody will pay any penalty for it.
[03:56:49.752 --> 03:56:54.576]  I heard the Keebler elf is riding his magic stallion, the hamster lemme-winks.
[03:56:55.356 --> 03:57:10.403]  At this point, I think he is so upset about the President's public position supporting state-legalized marijuana of about two weeks ago, he's still trying... And he doesn't want minimum sentences for black people that are worse than white people's.
[03:57:10.403 --> 03:57:12.824]  So, he needs to go.
[03:57:12.824 --> 03:57:15.065]  I really wonder what the President is waiting for.
[03:57:15.065 --> 03:57:19.848]  The most ineffective Attorney General in American history.
[03:57:19.848 --> 03:57:21.769]  There he is.
[03:57:21.769 --> 03:57:24.270]  Instead of a Keebler Elf, it's like a Grand Dragon Elf probably.
[03:57:26.715 --> 03:57:29.518]  Yeah, they probably got video of him highlighting Hitler or something.
[03:57:29.518 --> 03:57:30.719]  All right!
[03:57:30.719 --> 03:57:31.660]  The War Room's coming up.
[03:57:31.660 --> 03:57:34.884]  Oh, you've got Danny Williams, the illegitimate son of Bill Clinton, coming up.
