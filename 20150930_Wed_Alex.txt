[00:00.000 --> 00:12.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.960 --> 00:21.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.760 --> 00:32.800]  it's September 30th 2015 this is the Alex Jones show live I'm your host Paul
[00:32.800 --> 00:37.960]  Joseph Watson we've got an absolutely packed show coming up today bottom of
[00:37.960 --> 00:42.640]  the hour we've got the angry foreigner this is a YouTube viral sensation this
[00:42.640 --> 00:47.840]  is a Bosnian immigrant who lives in Sweden which of course we bash on
[00:47.840 --> 00:52.760]  relentlessly we bash on the Swedish government for their open border pro
[00:52.760 --> 00:57.680]  immigration madness but this is a guy who emigrated to Sweden and now he's
[00:57.680 --> 01:02.320]  speaking out against the insanity he's speaking out against the migrant
[01:02.320 --> 01:07.560]  invasion into quote the most progressive country in the world so we're
[01:07.560 --> 01:12.640]  going to illustrate what happens when liberalism runs rampant at the bottom of
[01:12.640 --> 01:17.480]  the hour with the angry foreigner you've heard us talk before about Swedish
[01:17.480 --> 01:24.400]  politicians actually calling for welfare and jobs for ISIS recruits who go
[01:24.400 --> 01:30.240]  over to fight in Syria and return to Sweden then they expect Swedish taxpayers
[01:30.240 --> 01:35.880]  to pay for their housing to pay for their welfare and for them to get jobs
[01:35.880 --> 01:40.200]  that replace Swedish employees so this is going to be a really fascinating
[01:40.200 --> 01:45.840]  discussion again trying to get a perspective on the migrant crisis from
[01:45.840 --> 01:50.720]  people who are living in Europe who are living amongst it as these millions of
[01:50.720 --> 01:55.680]  migrants pour in second hour we're going to talk about Gamergate now this is a
[01:55.680 --> 01:59.120]  quite a technical issue that most people don't grasp they can't seem to
[01:59.120 --> 02:05.800]  understand it but it represents a fundamental threat to free speech to
[02:05.800 --> 02:11.080]  having our own independent thoughts and not being brainwashed by not just
[02:11.080 --> 02:15.560]  Hollywood and the news media which is declining in influence but video games
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.960]  themselves this is the most powerful industry on the planet right now this is
[02:20.960 --> 02:24.640]  the most lucrative industry on the planet so we're going to discuss how
[02:24.640 --> 02:31.120]  video games are being used and seized control of by control freaks to brainwash
[02:31.120 --> 02:35.440]  young people we're going to be talking to a research a researcher Theodore
[02:35.440 --> 02:40.960]  Morgan major who is blowing the whistle on a plot to re-educate an entire
[02:40.960 --> 02:46.240]  generation via video games and we're also going to be getting to your calls
[02:46.240 --> 02:51.240]  later in the show so we'll get those lined up after the bottom of the hour
[02:51.240 --> 02:56.640]  topstoriesoninforewars.com which we'll be covering in the next segment CNN
[02:56.640 --> 03:03.480]  analysts says Trump Carson to blame if gunman shoots Muslims in a mosque this
[03:03.480 --> 03:08.560]  is a CNN analyst who go up on Don Lemon show and basically said because of the
[03:08.560 --> 03:14.000]  quote anti-Muslim rhetoric being spewed by Donald Trump and Ben Carson that's
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.840]  gonna cause crazies right wing radicals to go out and shoot Muslims in mosques
[03:18.840 --> 03:23.280]  we're gonna break down that propaganda we're gonna point out the fact that the
[03:23.280 --> 03:29.440]  left never blames hate preachers who influence jihadists to go and shoot up
[03:29.440 --> 03:34.800]  cartoon events like we saw in Paris like we saw in Garland Texas they blame the
[03:34.800 --> 03:40.560]  cartoonists themselves but it's okay to blame Donald Trump and Ben Carson for an
[03:40.560 --> 03:44.880]  event that hasn't even happened yet so we're gonna break down that propaganda
[03:44.880 --> 03:50.760]  also Muslim man admits strangling his daughter for dishonor after she was
[03:50.760 --> 03:55.440]  steep after she was caught stealing condoms and this happened in Germany
[03:55.440 --> 04:00.160]  again where this migrant invasion invasion of predominantly Muslim men is
[04:00.160 --> 04:06.040]  taking place shocking story and this is the very kind of culture that we're
[04:06.040 --> 04:11.920]  importing into Europe we're also going to talk about how Obama gave 1,500
[04:11.920 --> 04:18.840]  terrorists asylum in the US this is a judicial wash expose which we covered on
[04:18.840 --> 04:26.120]  info was.com yesterday where basically 50% of those rewarded residency were
[04:26.120 --> 04:31.640]  linked not only to this refugee crisis but also to providing material support
[04:31.640 --> 04:38.200]  to terrorists and these are the kind of people who Obama plans to import we're
[04:38.200 --> 04:43.680]  talking about a hundred thousand people imported into the US within the next
[04:43.680 --> 04:47.840]  couple of years we'll be right back this is the Alex Jones show live I'm Paul
[04:47.840 --> 04:58.240]  Joseph Watson info was.com stay tuned
[04:58.240 --> 05:04.320]  a Georgia high school went into lockdown the other day after a student
[05:04.320 --> 05:09.640]  showed up with a Confederate flag the incident started when a 10th grade boy
[05:09.640 --> 05:15.840]  arrived at Rockmart High School with the rebel flag attached to his backpack he
[05:15.840 --> 05:20.880]  was then confronted by two black students who were upset by the flag and a
[05:20.880 --> 05:29.400]  fight broke out the scuffle was quickly broken up by teachers and staff all three
[05:29.400 --> 05:33.960]  students were searched and no weapons were found but then rumors began to
[05:33.960 --> 05:38.600]  circulate that more students would be bringing Confederate flags to school and
[05:38.600 --> 05:44.440]  a campus lockdown was ordered no word as to whether or not the black students
[05:44.440 --> 05:49.080]  are equally upset with President Barack Obama who also displayed the

[08:25.680 --> 08:34.160]  we're back live it's the Alex Jones show I'm your host Paul Joseph Watson we've
[08:34.160 --> 08:37.720]  got a great guest coming up at the bottom of the hour he's called the angry
[08:37.720 --> 08:42.800]  foreigner he's a viral success on YouTube and basically he's blowing the
[08:42.800 --> 08:48.560]  whistle on how this mass immigration this open border policy is impacting
[08:48.560 --> 08:54.080]  Sweden as they prepare to let in who knows you know a hundred thousand two
[08:54.080 --> 08:58.840]  hundred thousand a million migrants back into Sweden even though they've got the
[08:58.840 --> 09:04.240]  highest Muslim migrant population in comparison to the host population in
[09:04.240 --> 09:08.800]  Europe it's going to be a very interesting discussion we've bashed on
[09:08.800 --> 09:13.040]  Sweden so many times in the past of course making the distinction between the
[09:13.040 --> 09:18.480]  government and the people of Sweden but this is going to be an illustration into
[09:18.480 --> 09:23.680]  what happens to a country when liberalism as they call it as they define it or
[09:23.680 --> 09:28.720]  when progressivism runs rampant so that's coming up at the bottom of the
[09:28.720 --> 09:36.080]  hour but the top story my story on info wars.com today is this CNN analyst says
[09:36.080 --> 09:43.120]  Trump Carson to blame if German shoots Muslims in a mosque so basically this
[09:43.120 --> 09:49.960]  leftist got up on CNN and said if a nutcase goes on a rampage in a Muslim
[09:49.960 --> 09:56.040]  mosque then Ben Carson and Donald Trump the Republican presidential candidates
[09:56.040 --> 10:02.320]  will be to blame simply because they criticize radical Islam and you
[10:02.320 --> 10:06.960]  probably saw the clip on info was a couple of days ago it was Ben Carson in
[10:06.960 --> 10:14.080]  an interview with Jake Tapper of ABC News and basically all he said was that
[10:14.080 --> 10:20.120]  Muslims who embrace the Quran he can't support them as president because
[10:20.120 --> 10:25.040]  that's incompatible with the US Constitution so we're gonna break down
[10:25.040 --> 10:30.120]  this propaganda but let's go to this clip from CNN here it is. Would we ever
[10:30.120 --> 10:34.960]  accept a presidential candidate that would apply the same rules would say
[10:34.960 --> 10:38.720]  the same things about Jews and black we would never tolerate them would never
[10:38.720 --> 10:42.760]  respect them would never expect that even even accept them we will shun them
[10:42.760 --> 10:47.920]  aside but we accept it against Muslims because sadly in the Republican base
[10:47.920 --> 10:53.240]  this is what is appealing to them today and not only that what happened and I
[10:53.240 --> 10:56.720]  think let me just finish this please because it's very important what's
[10:56.720 --> 11:00.640]  happened with Trump the site we are discussing the first part of what was
[11:00.640 --> 11:04.940]  said and Trump endorsed which is we have a problem called Muslims but there's
[11:04.940 --> 11:09.680]  a second part how to get rid of them and in the realm of possibility in a
[11:09.680 --> 11:14.720]  country that is very armed that somebody that will be carrying weapon will go to
[11:14.720 --> 11:18.880]  a mosque tomorrow or after tomorrow and we'll start shooting people and then
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.880]  these people will have blood on their hands all of them. We see two points here and one
[11:23.880 --> 11:30.240]  I gotta go guys. That's the clip from CNN and basically as he heard she was making
[11:30.240 --> 11:35.960]  the argument completely ridiculous that because Trump said that radical Islam is
[11:35.960 --> 11:40.200]  a problem and that's basically all he said you know he got up and did a
[11:40.200 --> 11:44.480]  speech and said that you know Muslims are a problem in America he did an
[11:44.480 --> 11:50.080]  interview with CNN after the fact and said yes radical Islam is a problem like
[11:50.080 --> 11:54.040]  that would be a controversial statement like that would be shocking in any
[11:54.040 --> 11:59.480]  context of course radical Islam is a problem and then Ben Carson all he
[11:59.480 --> 12:06.360]  basically said was that if you take the tenets of the Quran and Sharia law into
[12:06.360 --> 12:11.920]  the office of the president then that is incompatible with the US Constitution
[12:11.920 --> 12:17.280]  that's incompatible with basic freedom basic rights as we understand them to
[12:17.280 --> 12:22.600]  exist in America and again why is that even controversial in the first place
[12:22.600 --> 12:28.480]  so this woman this suppose a geopolitical analyst gets up on Don
[12:28.480 --> 12:33.440]  Lemon show and says this is gonna cause some right-wing nutcase some lunatic to
[12:33.440 --> 12:39.400]  go postal in a mosque and start shooting up Muslims which is funny because you
[12:39.400 --> 12:45.600]  know when jihadists who shoot up places in garland or at least attempt to they
[12:45.600 --> 12:48.960]  weren't successful because America has the Second Amendment they were
[12:48.960 --> 12:53.680]  successful in Paris at the Charlie Hebdo shootings because of course we've
[12:53.680 --> 12:58.520]  been completely disarmed in Europe we can't protect ourselves there's no
[12:58.520 --> 13:03.640]  condemnation whatsoever as happened in Paris and garland who
[13:03.640 --> 13:11.400]  deliberals blame do they blame Islam do they blame Islamic hate preachers for
[13:11.400 --> 13:16.880]  spreading the kind of hate that justifies such acts no they blame the
[13:16.880 --> 13:23.480]  cartoonists for quote provoking the jihadists and in fact a day after Charlie
[13:23.480 --> 13:28.760]  Hebdo shootings in Paris Chris Matthews came out on MSNBC and said that the
[13:28.760 --> 13:35.480]  cartoonists themselves were to blame for provoking the attack and even the Pope
[13:35.480 --> 13:40.960]  rhetorically sided with the Charlie Hebdo jihadists with the Islamist
[13:40.960 --> 13:46.960]  terrorists because he asserted that you know insulting someone's religion
[13:46.960 --> 13:52.880]  shouldn't be a part of free speech so the entirety of the leftist media after
[13:52.880 --> 13:57.640]  the Charlie Hebdo attacks after the attacks in garland Texas where they
[13:57.640 --> 14:03.520]  tried to shoot up a draw Muhammad cartoon exhibition were completely aligned
[14:03.520 --> 14:09.040]  behind the notion that the people to blame for this were the people drawing
[14:09.040 --> 14:13.760]  the cartoons and yet this woman is saying no it's the rhetoric from Donald
[14:13.760 --> 14:19.240]  Trump and Ben Carson that will be to blame when some you know right wing
[14:19.240 --> 14:24.440]  christian lunatic shoots up a mosque so it's a fundamental hypocrisy which we
[14:24.440 --> 14:29.680]  see again and again with the leftist media you know did liberals blame Obama
[14:29.680 --> 14:37.960]  and the Democratic base when Bryce Williams executed a tea reporter live on
[14:37.960 --> 14:44.240]  air Allison Parker and her cameraman his manifesto said that he did that to try
[14:44.240 --> 14:49.840]  and start a quote race war the same race war that has been promulgated by the
[14:49.840 --> 14:55.080]  black lives matter movement which has been supported at least tacitly by the
[14:55.080 --> 14:59.800]  Obama administration was that late was the blame laid at the door of the Obama
[14:59.800 --> 15:06.240]  administration for that violent act no was the blame for the NYPD killings
[15:06.240 --> 15:13.200]  back in December Ishmael Brinsley shot two NYPD officers in the head in his
[15:13.200 --> 15:21.000]  own words as a quote revenge attack for black lives matter we've had black lives
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.040]  matter activists plan to bomb police quarters police headquarters in
[15:26.040 --> 15:32.320]  Ferguson again to get revenge for their supposed political motivation was that
[15:32.320 --> 15:37.640]  blamed on the Obama administration was that blamed on the Democratic base by
[15:37.640 --> 15:45.600]  the leftist media no then we had Floyd Lee Corkins this is the guy who was so
[15:45.600 --> 15:53.680]  upset over the family research council opposing gay marriage again at the same
[15:53.680 --> 15:58.320]  time as the Obama administration tried to you know get this supreme court
[15:58.320 --> 16:02.760]  ruling passed on gay marriage they were activists for that he went into the
[16:02.760 --> 16:07.840]  family research council basically tried to kill as many people as possible and
[16:07.840 --> 16:14.520]  his motivation was the conservative beliefs of this organization was that
[16:14.520 --> 16:22.240]  act blamed on Obama was that act blamed on the Democrats no so again you know
[16:22.240 --> 16:27.360]  whenever someone like Dylan Roof in Charleston goes on a rampage they lay
[16:27.360 --> 16:33.160]  the blame at the door of conservatives but when a Muslim had his goes on a
[16:33.160 --> 16:39.680]  killing spree the blame is laid at the door of those who dared to offend the
[16:39.680 --> 16:45.880]  terrorist killers we saw it in Paris we saw it in Garland we saw it in Copenhagen
[16:45.880 --> 16:51.160]  and again no blame is a portion to the fact that passages in the Quran
[16:51.160 --> 16:56.960]  legitimize and courage and justify the bloodshed that has been carried out
[16:56.960 --> 17:01.720]  in the name of Islam which again is not to say that you don't make the
[17:01.720 --> 17:07.000]  distinction between moderate Muslims who don't support this and the extremists
[17:07.000 --> 17:12.520]  who do but don't go and blame blame Donald Trump and Ben Carson for a
[17:12.520 --> 17:18.000]  rampage a massacre that hasn't even happened simply because they were
[17:18.000 --> 17:24.160]  critical of radical Islam it's completely ridiculous but I guess the
[17:24.160 --> 17:28.640]  solution is you know just not to talk about politics or religion
[17:28.640 --> 17:34.240]  whatsoever in public and if we can get that Mark Dice clip Cudo Mark Dice
[17:34.240 --> 17:39.160]  actually went out on the streets of San Diego and you know he continues to top
[17:39.160 --> 17:44.360]  himself in the ludicrousness of what these leftists will support and they
[17:44.360 --> 17:50.280]  actually supported banning the discussion of politics and religion in
[17:50.280 --> 17:54.160]  public so this it you know we don't even have to debate about this anymore
[17:54.160 --> 17:58.040]  because as long as we shut down free speech no one's gonna be able to have
[17:58.040 --> 18:03.520]  an opinion and this is all being pushed again by the authoritarian left let's go
[18:03.520 --> 18:07.680]  to that clip need a few more signatures for a new initiative just to just to
[18:07.680 --> 18:13.040]  prevent you know political and religious speech at the beach so just a
[18:13.040 --> 18:18.240]  couple more a couple more signatures just print your name there we don't
[18:18.240 --> 18:23.360]  really need people talking about politics or religion out in public
[18:23.360 --> 18:29.920]  right there's a time and a place for those kind of discussions and we're
[18:29.920 --> 18:36.840]  just trying to you know mute people's political and religious speech just
[18:36.840 --> 18:41.160]  just when they're in public though in public in private you can you can carry
[18:41.160 --> 18:51.000]  on those conversations thank you so much for supporting that you know every
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.800]  time people come to the beach they don't want to be you know hearing people talk
[18:54.800 --> 19:03.000]  about politics or religion and this is a place for fun and son and a birthday to
[19:03.000 --> 19:09.160]  basically you know mute people's political or religious people don't need

[20:41.360 --> 20:47.960]  crash they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has

[21:17.840 --> 21:21.200]  felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy
[21:21.200 --> 21:25.760]  soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards us passports
[21:25.760 --> 21:30.760]  hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID it was

[24:31.520 --> 24:36.640]  coming up over the next two hours which will be really fascinating we're gonna
[24:36.640 --> 24:41.680]  take your calls as well for those guests before the break we played Mark Dice's
[24:41.680 --> 24:46.760]  video again liberal signing a petition to ban the discussion of politics and
[24:46.760 --> 24:54.720]  religion in public and I guess that is a real solid solution for the hate speech
[24:54.720 --> 25:01.040]  being spewed by the likes of Ben Carson and Donald Trump because they dare to
[25:01.040 --> 25:06.520]  criticize radical Islam I mean God forbid that they should have the
[25:06.520 --> 25:12.320]  temerity to do so and again they were savaged they were absolutely savaged by
[25:12.320 --> 25:17.640]  the left-wing media over the past couple of weeks simply for saying in in the
[25:17.640 --> 25:22.280]  case of Ben Carson that the tenets of the Quran if you actually read the
[25:22.280 --> 25:27.360]  passages are incompatible with the US Constitution so if you had a Muslim
[25:27.360 --> 25:32.960]  president that embraced those tenets there would be a problem with them
[25:32.960 --> 25:38.000]  actually protecting the free speech rights of American citizens if they
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.920]  also believed in Sharia law and on the subject of that this headline again
[25:43.920 --> 25:49.680]  absolutely shocking Muslim man admits strangling his daughter for dishonor
[25:49.680 --> 25:56.520]  after she was caught stealing condoms this is out of biz pack review a Muslim
[25:56.520 --> 26:01.080]  immigrant and this is in Germany bearing in mind this is in Germany where
[26:01.080 --> 26:05.840]  they're now importing hundreds of thousands of these Muslim migrants
[26:05.840 --> 26:12.240]  supposedly Syrian refugees only one fifth of them are actually Syrian they're
[26:12.240 --> 26:16.960]  importing them on mass and this is the kind of culture that they're now
[26:16.960 --> 26:21.720]  importing a Muslim immigrant from Pakistan who strangled his daughter and
[26:21.720 --> 26:26.560]  hid her body in a forest told the courtroom he killed her because he was
[26:26.560 --> 26:33.960]  enraged that she'd been caught stealing condoms that's worthy of the death
[26:33.960 --> 26:40.040]  penalty under Sharia law again even if you entertain the notion that she was
[26:40.040 --> 26:44.960]  having sex with someone you know God forbid there wasn't even any proof of
[26:44.960 --> 26:50.000]  that she stole some condoms according to the Australian news agency news.com
[26:50.000 --> 26:56.000]  the murder took place in Darmstadt Germany in January when 51 year old
[26:56.000 --> 27:02.440]  as a dollar corn killed 19 year old daughter laryb corn for bringing quote
[27:02.440 --> 27:08.680]  dishonor to her family with a man she'd been forbidden today and again bearing
[27:08.680 --> 27:16.120]  in mind in Pakistan there are 1000 honorlings per year mostly of women and
[27:16.120 --> 27:22.000]  in many cases it's because they marry somebody to whom their parents don't
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.520]  consent them to marry and in other cases they lock it's they look at a man twice
[27:27.520 --> 27:34.040]  that is the death penalty sentence locking at a man twice requires an honor
[27:34.040 --> 27:40.280]  killing in some cases in Pakistan a thousand cases a year of this now these
[27:40.280 --> 27:45.120]  Muslim migrants are traveling to Germany and this is the culture that they're
[27:45.120 --> 27:50.560]  importing his wife who was involved in this plot Sharia corn told the German
[27:50.560 --> 27:55.760]  court she helped her husband hide the woman's body because she was afraid of
[27:55.760 --> 28:00.880]  him the family had been arguing about laryb corn's boyfriend the news agency
[28:00.880 --> 28:06.520]  reported an acid al acid ala corn had attempted to strangle his daughter once
[28:06.520 --> 28:12.800]  before so this wasn't the first time and basically they got a letter from the
[28:12.800 --> 28:17.040]  police saying that there was some evidence that this girl had stole some
[28:17.040 --> 28:21.520]  condoms they then took that as evidence that she was having sex with someone
[28:21.520 --> 28:27.360]  else without their permission the husband burst into her bedroom
[28:27.360 --> 28:33.840]  immediately upon finding this out and strangled her strangled her to death and
[28:33.840 --> 28:39.920]  where were the feminists with their outrage about the patriarchy and about
[28:39.920 --> 28:44.320]  the oppression of women bearing in mind this is in Europe this is not even in
[28:44.320 --> 28:48.840]  the Middle East this is in Europe they were at absolutely nowhere to be seen
[28:48.840 --> 28:55.480]  they're too busy whining to the UN about how mean tweets need to be censored
[28:55.480 --> 29:00.760]  and that the entirety of the social media networks Facebook Twitter need to be
[29:00.760 --> 29:07.560]  controlled by the UN or by governments that follow UN mandates because you
[29:07.560 --> 29:12.880]  can't say a feminist suck so you can't say they're a liar that's true misogyny
[29:12.880 --> 29:19.520]  meanwhile people in Europe women young women teenagers are getting strangled to
[29:19.520 --> 29:27.200]  death for quote stealing condom now which is the greater tragedy which is the
[29:27.200 --> 29:32.040]  greater issue in comparison mean tweets or getting strangled to death by
[29:32.040 --> 29:36.440]  then for stealing condoms yet the feminists don't talk about it we'll be
[29:36.440 --> 29:41.960]  right back with our guests this is the Alex Jones show like stay tuned

[30:14.640 --> 30:17.800]  statement issued by the endocrine society the statement builds upon the

[33:01.080 --> 33:24.920]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:24.920 --> 33:33.080]  now we've got our next guest coming up and you know i've made videos about
[33:33.080 --> 33:39.320]  sweden we we tend to rag on sweden as it were we tend to hate on sweden because
[33:39.320 --> 33:45.040]  again it's the ultimate example of liberalism run rampant liberalism gone
[33:45.040 --> 33:51.160]  mad and i made a video probably three four months ago now called absolute
[33:51.160 --> 33:56.760]  proof liberalism is a mental disorder talking about how some politicians in
[33:56.760 --> 34:00.440]  sweden and this is not official government policy yet but this is what
[34:00.440 --> 34:05.080]  some of them are calling for the political class calling for giving
[34:05.080 --> 34:11.400]  isis militants people who fought as terrorists in syria welfare and jobs
[34:11.400 --> 34:15.960]  when they return to sweden that's what some people in sweden are actually
[34:15.960 --> 34:20.040]  calling for and we're going to get into the rest of the madness but somebody
[34:20.040 --> 34:23.400]  then recommended that i check out this guy's videos
[34:23.400 --> 34:26.920]  who goes under the moniker the angry foreigner
[34:26.920 --> 34:31.880]  and he put out a video called welcome to sweden which went viral which got
[34:31.880 --> 34:36.760]  you know upwards of six hundred and seventy thousand views
[34:36.760 --> 34:41.480]  and then i checked out the rest of his video this really is a great example of
[34:41.480 --> 34:45.400]  somebody who has who has seen the deception in terms of the fact that
[34:45.400 --> 34:51.880]  in sweden it's basically almost a hate crime to even oppose mass immigration
[34:51.880 --> 34:55.960]  and we're going to get into how people are publicly shamed and harassed and
[34:55.960 --> 35:03.160]  hounded simply for having a different opinion so the angry foreigner welcome
[35:03.160 --> 35:05.880]  to the show
[35:07.880 --> 35:12.360]  now before we get into the whole migrant issue which is what
[35:12.360 --> 35:16.920]  the two of your recent videos were about just tell people about your background
[35:16.920 --> 35:21.480]  because as far as i understand it you're an immigrant yourself correct
[35:21.480 --> 35:25.480]  yeah exactly i came to sweden when i was five years old
[35:25.480 --> 35:30.040]  in 1993 me and my family fled the war in the Balkans
[35:30.040 --> 35:33.720]  it was a very bloody horrible conflict between
[35:33.720 --> 35:38.600]  bastion muslims and bastion serbs orthodox serbs
[35:38.600 --> 35:43.800]  so yeah we ended up here in a small town i'm not even sure you can call that
[35:43.800 --> 35:49.080]  town maybe it's more like a village the population was only a thousand people
[35:49.080 --> 35:53.480]  there so it was basically me and a couple of other bastion families
[35:53.480 --> 35:57.640]  surrounded by swedes and it was you know it's it was great it was the complete
[35:57.640 --> 36:02.040]  opposite of segregation and i remember actually that my first
[36:02.040 --> 36:06.360]  day in school i was i was terrified i was freaking out
[36:06.360 --> 36:09.640]  because i was sitting there in the classroom and i didn't know
[36:09.640 --> 36:14.040]  a word of swedish so it was like being an alien
[36:14.040 --> 36:18.120]  visiting a foreign planet and when you're little like that
[36:18.120 --> 36:24.520]  social acceptance is very very important so i made sure to learn swedish
[36:24.520 --> 36:29.640]  very fast and managed to learn it's better than a lot of the students in
[36:29.640 --> 36:32.600]  my class actually
[36:32.600 --> 36:35.960]  so you're you're an immigrant you assimilated
[36:35.960 --> 36:40.360]  very quickly you integrated you learned the language
[36:40.360 --> 36:43.880]  so you're there growing up in sweden now you're making these videos
[36:43.880 --> 36:47.960]  critical of immigrants being brought into sweden
[36:47.960 --> 36:52.440]  and basically what people want to know to outline this whole scenario is
[36:52.440 --> 36:57.080]  you know in terms of this this cult-like adherence to these leftist policies in
[36:57.080 --> 37:02.040]  sweden particularly as it relates to mass immigration
[37:02.040 --> 37:05.640]  and the drowning out of voices of dissent against that
[37:05.640 --> 37:09.880]  because you know at least in britain we've got the labor party we've got the
[37:09.880 --> 37:13.640]  left who always advocate mass immigration you know we voted the
[37:13.640 --> 37:17.800]  conservatives into power to try and you know at least
[37:17.800 --> 37:21.800]  tamp down on that mass immigration to a certain extent it didn't work
[37:21.800 --> 37:25.640]  mass immigration only increased but at least we've got an acceptance of the
[37:25.640 --> 37:29.160]  fact that criticizing mass immigration
[37:29.160 --> 37:32.600]  is a social issue it's an economic issue
[37:32.600 --> 37:36.920]  and simply doing it doesn't automatically make you a racist
[37:36.920 --> 37:41.560]  at least in many european countries we still hold to that standard
[37:41.560 --> 37:45.640]  of political discourse but it seems that in sweden
[37:45.640 --> 37:50.360]  even to question the policy of mass uncontrolled immigration
[37:50.360 --> 37:53.320]  is inherently racist and proves that you're a
[37:53.320 --> 37:57.400]  you're a white supremacist or whatever so what people want to know
[37:57.400 --> 38:01.160]  as far as i'm concerned is how bad is it in terms of
[38:01.160 --> 38:04.840]  people who express dissent against this mass immigration policy
[38:04.840 --> 38:08.520]  how much are they frowned upon how much are they shamed
[38:08.520 --> 38:13.960]  by the media by the political class in sweden
[38:13.960 --> 38:19.960]  it's sort of like blacks in the fifties except nobody is getting lynched
[38:19.960 --> 38:23.400]  i would i'm actually surprised that we don't have like
[38:23.400 --> 38:27.960]  diversity lovers only restaurants and toilets
[38:27.960 --> 38:33.880]  and you know bus seats because it's bad like it's ridiculous
[38:33.880 --> 38:37.720]  and while that was a joke and exaggeration there's a point to it
[38:37.720 --> 38:41.880]  like you definitely have to think about what you say
[38:41.880 --> 38:46.600]  because there's there is the risk of losing friends and you might even lose
[38:46.600 --> 38:49.480]  your job i mean if you there's certain professions like
[38:49.480 --> 38:53.320]  if you're a journalist or an academic or a teacher especially a teacher
[38:53.320 --> 38:57.960]  you can't criticize mass immigration or multiculturalism
[38:57.960 --> 39:01.240]  you especially cannot say that the sweden democrats
[39:01.240 --> 39:05.080]  have a few valid points that's like social suicide
[39:05.080 --> 39:10.520]  but at the same time we have like 58 percent a poll showed that 58 percent
[39:10.520 --> 39:13.400]  of the population think that immigration is too large
[39:13.400 --> 39:17.080]  so a large portion of the people are aware
[39:17.080 --> 39:20.440]  that there are problems with our immigration policy
[39:20.440 --> 39:25.080]  but those people don't necessarily have the balls
[39:25.080 --> 39:28.920]  so if you were to be vocal like i've had so many people
[39:28.920 --> 39:32.840]  write me and tell me that they totally agree with what i'm saying
[39:32.840 --> 39:37.400]  but they don't dare share my videos on facebook
[39:37.400 --> 39:41.480]  they don't dare be vocal and public about their opinions because they're
[39:41.480 --> 39:46.840]  afraid of social exclusion and it's really interesting because
[39:46.840 --> 39:50.360]  there is a strong consensus culture here and you know when we when we think of
[39:50.360 --> 39:54.440]  Orwellian societies where people aren't allowed to speak their minds we
[39:54.440 --> 39:59.080]  usually think of the presence of a strong military force and like
[39:59.080 --> 40:02.600]  laws punishing people who say certain things
[40:02.600 --> 40:07.320]  you don't need laws in sweden because people censor themselves
[40:07.320 --> 40:10.920]  people are there's a form of social control instead
[40:10.920 --> 40:16.120]  through taboos and norms and i would say that the media is
[40:16.120 --> 40:22.600]  largely responsible for this because for years they have been beating in this
[40:22.600 --> 40:25.480]  and the politician beating in this notion that
[40:25.480 --> 40:29.160]  immigration is good and immigration is going to serve us all
[40:29.160 --> 40:32.520]  and you're racist if you think otherwise so
[40:32.520 --> 40:35.960]  there's there's a lot of lots of people who have discovered my videos
[40:35.960 --> 40:40.200]  and said that wow i thought i was the only person who thought like this
[40:40.200 --> 40:45.160]  and when you get like hundreds of people saying i thought i was the only person
[40:45.160 --> 40:48.520]  it becomes kind of ridiculous it becomes obvious that people
[40:48.520 --> 40:53.240]  so many people are living in some kind of bubble of fear like they're afraid to
[40:53.240 --> 40:56.760]  speak with their environment with their
[40:56.760 --> 40:59.960]  surroundings about how they truly feel
[40:59.960 --> 41:03.480]  so when they discover me it's like this massive relief
[41:03.480 --> 41:08.280]  for them and you know that's that's pretty that's pretty bad if you ask me
[41:08.280 --> 41:12.840]  also i'm there's people who genuinely think i'm a nazi
[41:12.840 --> 41:17.160]  like they seriously believe that i like hitler
[41:17.160 --> 41:22.440]  and just as you said you can't i mean if you criticize the immigration policy
[41:22.440 --> 41:27.880]  people immediately think that it's something personal with the immigrants
[41:27.880 --> 41:31.640]  obviously that isn't the case because i'm an immigrant
[41:31.640 --> 41:35.160]  and i don't have a problem with immigrants i have a problem with
[41:35.160 --> 41:38.600]  irresponsible immigration policy and that's what
[41:38.600 --> 41:41.800]  that's the only that's that's the one single word i would use to describe
[41:41.800 --> 41:45.720]  sweden's immigration policy irresponsible
[41:45.720 --> 41:49.960]  and you mentioned you know peer pressure and this is what i found especially in
[41:49.960 --> 41:53.240]  europe i don't think americans appreciate this to us
[41:53.240 --> 41:56.520]  such an extent that they need to is the fact that
[41:56.520 --> 42:01.960]  you know i assume that you're in your 20s or 30s i'm in my 30s right now so
[42:01.960 --> 42:05.880]  amongst people in your age group it's not seen as trendy
[42:05.880 --> 42:10.360]  or kosher or acceptable again as he said it's seen as a taboo
[42:10.360 --> 42:14.040]  to even hold some of these viewpoints so the government
[42:14.040 --> 42:18.520]  doesn't really need to censor them they don't need to be so authoritarian
[42:18.520 --> 42:21.480]  although there are some examples which we will go on to
[42:21.480 --> 42:25.000]  but they don't need to be you know so crushing
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.560]  in their totalitarianism in terms of censoring these viewpoints because
[42:29.560 --> 42:34.040]  the sheep will police the other sheep so if you're around a group of young
[42:34.040 --> 42:37.640]  people who are you know western europeans
[42:37.640 --> 42:41.480]  they will generally hold to the beliefs that they were
[42:41.480 --> 42:45.480]  indoctrinated to believe and they won't dare venture
[42:45.480 --> 42:51.320]  into any of the taboos which of course is mass immigration in terms of sweden
[42:51.320 --> 42:57.880]  has not been generally successful in practical terms and in social terms
[42:57.880 --> 43:01.800]  talk about the housing shortage that is currently
[43:01.800 --> 43:06.520]  taking place in sweden and how that conflicts with this mass immigration
[43:06.520 --> 43:10.280]  policy right well you know it's funny
[43:10.280 --> 43:13.800]  because a lot of people say i'm a hypocrite because i came here as a
[43:13.800 --> 43:17.400]  refugee so how can i how can i deny others the chance
[43:17.400 --> 43:20.760]  there's a huge difference between the situation today and the situation in
[43:20.760 --> 43:26.520]  the 90s in the 90s we actually had room for people
[43:26.520 --> 43:29.800]  like there were apartments standing around
[43:29.800 --> 43:35.160]  empty all over sweden now we have a housing shortage so bad people who
[43:35.160 --> 43:38.680]  graduated can't move out of their parents house
[43:38.680 --> 43:43.640]  because there aren't enough apartments according to the department of housing
[43:43.640 --> 43:47.400]  we need to build 600 000 apartments within
[43:47.400 --> 43:50.760]  the next 11 years to accommodate everyone in need
[43:50.760 --> 43:54.520]  so basically we need to build a new stock home we need to build a new
[43:54.520 --> 43:58.360]  capital city the size of that in order
[43:58.360 --> 44:01.880]  to accommodate everyone and it's ridiculous because now
[44:01.880 --> 44:06.040]  we have a thousand refugees a day coming to sweden
[44:06.040 --> 44:09.480]  and they're looking to set up a refugee camp
[44:09.480 --> 44:14.680]  outside of krihansta which is a it's close to malmö it's it's down in the
[44:14.680 --> 44:19.720]  south basically there's this massive field this
[44:19.720 --> 44:23.880]  massive green field that's normally used for things like
[44:23.880 --> 44:30.040]  international scout meetings or military shit and they're
[44:30.040 --> 44:34.840]  planning on turning that into a refugee camp somehow they said that it can house
[44:34.840 --> 44:41.240]  up to 40 000 people so i mean that that's just insane to me that that's
[44:41.240 --> 44:45.240]  that's crazy so the guy who is supporting this initiative
[44:45.240 --> 44:49.240]  compared it to a refugee camp in northern iraq
[44:49.240 --> 44:53.000]  and he and i'm like that's not a good thing like that doesn't sound like a
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.240]  good thing it's crazy
[44:57.240 --> 45:02.760]  and another story again so basically you've got no room for
[45:02.760 --> 45:06.920]  immigrants again in germany belgium and other countries we've seen stories
[45:06.920 --> 45:11.240]  about the poor that would be homeless being kicked out of their homes to
[45:11.240 --> 45:15.080]  house these this new influx of migrants that is coming in
[45:15.080 --> 45:18.920]  over the past few months basically you've got housing shortage
[45:18.920 --> 45:22.760]  in sweden it's it's impractical that you could house these people
[45:22.760 --> 45:27.080]  but we've also got this public shaming angle which i want to touch on again
[45:27.080 --> 45:31.880]  we carried an article on info wars about a year ago now which was called
[45:31.880 --> 45:35.560]  sweden immigration critics get home visits from
[45:35.560 --> 45:39.160]  thought police one of sweden's biggest newspapers
[45:39.160 --> 45:43.960]  expressing used criminal hackers to break into discus which if you don't know
[45:43.960 --> 45:47.160]  what that is it's basically a a comment system for news
[45:47.160 --> 45:51.240]  articles we use it on info wars dot com so they use this
[45:51.240 --> 45:56.040]  this hacking group to break into discus and get the email addresses and
[45:56.040 --> 46:01.480]  identities of commenters online and to reveal the persons behind the nicknames
[46:01.480 --> 46:05.480]  or anonymous user ids so then this newspaper
[46:05.480 --> 46:09.320]  actually sent a reporter and a cameraman
[46:09.320 --> 46:13.560]  to these people's homes these people who had merely criticized mass immigration
[46:13.560 --> 46:19.160]  in sweden on you know internet news articles and basically
[46:19.160 --> 46:23.560]  publicly shamed them and then put their images put their video
[46:23.560 --> 46:27.880]  on the newspaper website you know on youtube so
[46:27.880 --> 46:32.840]  you've got thought police actually going out and physically harassing people in
[46:32.840 --> 46:37.080]  sweden simply for criticizing mass immigration
[46:37.080 --> 46:41.880]  now i know that you use the the you know the moniker the angry foreigner on your
[46:41.880 --> 46:45.320]  youtube channel is that because the situation in
[46:45.320 --> 46:50.280]  sweden is so intense it's so oppressive that critics of mass
[46:50.280 --> 46:54.280]  immigration could be targeted simply for banal
[46:54.280 --> 46:58.120]  online comments which aren't racist which aren't xenophobic
[46:58.120 --> 47:01.800]  merely drawing attention to the economic and the social impacts
[47:01.800 --> 47:07.560]  of mass immigration is that a concern for people in sweden right now
[47:07.560 --> 47:11.080]  well yeah i mean there's there's a there's a need for the anonymity i could
[47:11.080 --> 47:14.840]  say um me personally i just don't feel like having my
[47:14.840 --> 47:20.680]  window smashed or having shit sent to my mailbox or you know eggs so i just want
[47:20.680 --> 47:23.480]  to be comfortable and i'm not really interested in
[47:23.480 --> 47:27.960]  people knocking on my door whether it's fans wanting autographs or annoying
[47:27.960 --> 47:30.840]  critics yeah i just don't want to meet people
[47:30.840 --> 47:34.600]  when it comes to expression though you're you're right they did and actually
[47:34.600 --> 47:38.920]  i'm not sure if you're aware of this but this hacker group that they worked
[47:38.920 --> 47:42.520]  together with are militant left-wingers
[47:42.520 --> 47:47.080]  they are antifa are you aware with the organization antifa
[47:47.080 --> 47:50.600]  yeah i've heard of it yeah yeah basically it's antifa
[47:50.600 --> 47:54.520]  evolved into you know they were they used to be
[47:54.520 --> 47:58.200]  antifa hackers before so that's their background
[47:58.200 --> 48:04.600]  and it's insane that nobody is you know the only ones criticizing the fact
[48:04.600 --> 48:08.600]  that our mass media is cooperating with left-wing extremists is the
[48:08.600 --> 48:11.960]  alternative media they're the only ones who did like this huge
[48:11.960 --> 48:16.680]  audit of who these people are and it's partly you know
[48:16.680 --> 48:21.960]  i partly have to defend it because not all of some of those people were
[48:21.960 --> 48:26.040]  politicians and it wasn't it was blatantly racist
[48:26.040 --> 48:30.360]  things it wasn't just sensible criticism so i can sort of understand
[48:30.360 --> 48:35.240]  wanting to audit politicians and people who are in power
[48:35.240 --> 48:40.360]  however they also named and shamed people who aren't politicians people who
[48:40.360 --> 48:44.440]  simply you know someone who owns a company for example
[48:44.440 --> 48:49.800]  workers another newspaper aftonbladet which is the second or
[48:49.800 --> 48:53.080]  well experts in an aftonbladet are the two biggest newspapers in sweden
[48:53.080 --> 48:58.520]  they did the same thing and it wasn't even with politicians they took this guy
[48:58.520 --> 49:02.680]  who wrote like this um it was sort of a funny
[49:02.680 --> 49:06.440]  post i mean he basically wrote out a fantasy about how he wanted to murder
[49:06.440 --> 49:11.160]  this fat annoying radical feminist who is on swedish radio
[49:11.160 --> 49:14.600]  and you could tell that the guy was joking i mean basically laid out this
[49:14.600 --> 49:17.960]  video game scenario where feminists threaten to kill all men
[49:17.960 --> 49:21.080]  constantly they can go away with it that's fine
[49:21.080 --> 49:25.880]  yeah exactly because this feminist said some horrible shit right
[49:25.880 --> 49:29.240]  but you know she's a part of the mass media she's a part of the establishment
[49:29.240 --> 49:33.160]  nobody criticizes her but yeah he basically wrote a post about how he
[49:33.160 --> 49:36.520]  wanted to you know go to the tv station and kill everyone
[49:36.520 --> 49:41.080]  and they visited him in his home and tried to make him feel ashamed of having
[49:41.080 --> 49:44.520]  these thoughts funny thing about that was that he had no
[49:44.520 --> 49:47.880]  shame he was just like well you know i'm gonna stand by
[49:47.880 --> 49:51.320]  what i said it was a joke you're taking it seriously you're a fool that's it
[49:51.320 --> 49:55.560]  like so it didn't really work because that guy had guts
[49:55.560 --> 50:00.120]  but that's the type of stuff our mass media is doing and recently actually
[50:00.120 --> 50:06.840]  they decided to publicly name a shame a 70 year 70 year old
[50:06.840 --> 50:11.240]  woman with a heart condition because she was writing
[50:11.240 --> 50:18.200]  racist things online and that's just amazing to me because
[50:18.200 --> 50:24.040]  there is no need for this like they were using the reasoning that
[50:24.040 --> 50:29.560]  democracy feels better this way if everyone stands for what they say we're
[50:29.560 --> 50:32.520]  gonna have a healthier opinion in the bait climate
[50:32.520 --> 50:36.760]  and i'm like you wrote an article about her without even addressing
[50:36.760 --> 50:40.600]  a single counter argument to anything she has said
[50:40.600 --> 50:44.840]  you were literally just trying to scare her into silence
[50:44.840 --> 50:48.200]  and doesn't scare everyone else into silence they're trying to use
[50:48.200 --> 50:53.080]  like this iron grip on the population to keep them from expressing themselves
[50:53.080 --> 50:59.880]  and it's it's truly i mean it's some dictatorship bullshit
[50:59.880 --> 51:03.160]  most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega
[51:03.160 --> 51:06.120]  threes is a good idea but did you know that about 60 percent of
[51:06.120 --> 51:09.720]  americans are actually deficient in omega threes did you know that most fish oil
[51:09.720 --> 51:14.280]  products contain only about 25 omega threes and the remaining 75 percent is
[51:14.280 --> 51:17.640]  undesirable fish fat heck did you know that more than 90 percent of
[51:17.640 --> 51:21.480]  fish oil supplements sold in the usa are not even made here if you want to
[51:21.480 --> 51:24.920]  boost your omega threes using the finest american made fish oil
[51:24.920 --> 51:27.080]  check out neutral gold fish oil supplements on

[54:49.960 --> 54:55.640]  which again is the ultimate example of rampant liberalism gone mad they've got
[54:55.640 --> 54:58.680]  a mass open border policy we're going to talk
[54:58.680 --> 55:02.120]  about the impacts of that but the angry foreigner
[55:02.120 --> 55:05.720]  as far as i understand the official in charge
[55:05.720 --> 55:11.560]  of your anti extremism policy or your anti islamophobia policy
[55:11.560 --> 55:15.240]  there in sweden this was a top ranking official
[55:15.240 --> 55:21.480]  he was so liberal he was so trendy that he actually went on to join
[55:21.480 --> 55:28.520]  isis is that correct um we had uh what what was his title did you say
[55:28.520 --> 55:32.920]  i mean he was the head of the anti islamophobia
[55:32.920 --> 55:38.120]  body yeah yeah yeah he was he was uh we have a public service debate show called
[55:38.120 --> 55:44.120]  svt the but and they hired this guy as some kind of expert on islamophobia
[55:44.120 --> 55:48.920]  and it's so it's freaking hilarious this guy was on tv saying that
[55:48.920 --> 55:51.800]  you know you shouldn't be prejudiced towards islam
[55:51.800 --> 55:56.520]  you think that these guys just have like beards and ak-47s
[55:56.520 --> 56:00.440]  and a couple of years later he's posing with an ak-47
[56:00.440 --> 56:05.800]  telling people to join the islamic state that's wow you can't make that stuff up
[56:05.800 --> 56:11.080]  and his name his name was michael nicolai scramo but then you had another
[56:11.080 --> 56:16.200]  individual who was basically he was he was an expert this was in
[56:16.200 --> 56:19.880]  your video welcome to sweden he was some kind of expert
[56:19.880 --> 56:23.400]  on islamic extremism and he was talking about the
[56:23.400 --> 56:27.800]  the radicals traveling from sweden to syria to fight for isis
[56:27.800 --> 56:34.920]  and he said that we can't condemn isis he refused to condemn isis even as they
[56:34.920 --> 56:38.200]  were beheading you know countless people in the middle east
[56:38.200 --> 56:44.360]  correct mm-hmm yeah that was in my um uh migrant crisis video
[56:44.360 --> 56:47.720]  actually and yeah it was completely insane you know
[56:47.720 --> 56:51.800]  gothemberg alone has produced more jihadists than all of america
[56:51.800 --> 56:56.280]  sweden is leading in scandinavia in isis warrior
[56:56.280 --> 57:00.040]  export per capita so to speak and yet we have the least
[57:00.040 --> 57:05.480]  uh legal like we have the least legislations against
[57:05.480 --> 57:10.040]  terrorism it's not illegal to join isis here in sweden
[57:10.040 --> 57:14.040]  it's not illegal to recruit for isis if the national security police
[57:14.040 --> 57:17.800]  suspect that you're gonna travel to syria to join isis all they can do is
[57:17.800 --> 57:21.960]  give you a phone call that you don't even have to like pick up
[57:21.960 --> 57:26.680]  an answer so it wasn't until april
[57:26.680 --> 57:30.200]  yeah the spring this year that gothemberg assigned
[57:30.200 --> 57:36.680]  someone to not firmly and concretely deal with this issue because this has
[57:36.680 --> 57:40.360]  been going on for like two years at that point
[57:40.360 --> 57:47.080]  and when they interviewed him as you say he refused to renounce the islamic
[57:47.080 --> 57:50.520]  state he was of the opinion that oh it's unnecessary to talk
[57:50.520 --> 57:53.880]  about jihad because you know people are traveling for
[57:53.880 --> 57:57.320]  different reasons uh some people travel to botnia
[57:57.320 --> 58:02.040]  in the 90s and some people traveled to the finish
[58:02.040 --> 58:08.760]  war the finish winter war which was um around the time of the second world
[58:08.760 --> 58:12.040]  world war excuse me

[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:47.080]  we're talking about sweden which is a man case or someone say a basket case
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:51.800]  for what happens when liberalism runs rampant we were talking about
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:56.440]  how people within sweden are criticized not only criticized but actually
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.400]  hounded by the media by peer pressure simply for talking out
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.400]  simply for speaking out against mass immigration
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.600]  and i wanted to ask you before we go to calls here
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.920]  we had the ikea incident um a couple of months ago now
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:17.000]  there was some debate about whether that was a beheading or a
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.800]  you know somebody slitting somebody's throat it was definitely a terror attack
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.360]  by islamist targeting swedes in an ikea store
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.880]  we've had stabbings we've had grenade attacks
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.160]  how bad has it got i mean we hear these stories about
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:37.160]  you know these muslim ghettos where ambulance men police
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.680]  firemen go there to basically just do their job
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.040]  they're attacked with stones they're attacked with weapons
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.680]  how bad have these muslim ghettos got how bad has this tension got
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.960]  do you see there being riots in as that as there was in paris a few years ago
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.480]  arising out of these muslim ghettos in sweden
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:02.760]  how high has the tension become to the point where there could be some kind of
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:09.000]  riot or uprising well i feel i should i should point out that
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.560]  it is true that we have no go zones i think i think we have 55 no go zones
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.640]  and a police chief said just as he said that there are certain areas where if
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.640]  if the police are following a vehicle and that vehicle travels into a certain
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.760]  neighborhood they can't follow that vehicle because they will be
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.760]  pelted with rocks so that's a no-go zone in every sense of the
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.120]  word they can't go there but it it doesn't really have to do with
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:35.240]  religion i mean this isn't uh this i don't think
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.920]  you could say that these are muslims these are various types of immigrants
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:43.400]  and sometimes we but mostly immigrants in these immigrants dominated areas
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:49.560]  who are basically criminals brats and i would say that
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:54.280]  it primarily has to do with ghetto culture in sweden we have immigrants who
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:59.000]  live in these segregated areas and you know they seriously delude themselves
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.440]  into thinking that they have they have it just as bad
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.280]  as blacks living in kompton which is ridiculous because
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.480]  you know america is worse than sweden in every way
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:15.560]  if you look at poverty and class gaps in sweden you don't have to be a criminal
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.320]  in order to survive you get a pretty nice welfare check here
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:25.160]  i've actually read two articles interviewing these types of young hoodlums
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:29.640]  and one article they said that they're robbing
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.920]  only swedish people because they hate swedes
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.360]  they hate swedish society because swedes are so racist
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:40.360]  so robbing them is their way of fighting the man that was one article
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:46.600]  another article said that um i can't believe i'm gonna say this out loud but
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.200]  basically they were interviewing an immigrant in the ghetto who said that we
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.760]  turned to crime because we don't have enough money to party
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.920]  so these people are not being criminals out of necessity
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.360]  for life they're doing it because they're greedy and they watched
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.520]  too much scarface movies listen to too much 50 cent
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:14.600]  they just want to be cool essentially and we do have sharia police but
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.760]  it's not as well established as say britain where they go around putting up
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:22.200]  stickers a couple of months ago there were these
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.400]  immigrant women who came out in the media and said that
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.000]  they don't feel safe where they live in these segregated ghettos
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.360]  because there's actual sharia police walking around telling them
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:38.120]  what to wear uh how what to eat to avoid hanging out with swedish people
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.360]  that they aren't allowed to sit at a cafe without the company of a man
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:47.400]  that's the type of stuff that's going on and it's just recently been revealed so
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:53.000]  i would say that unless unless everything changes here in sweden
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.920]  we will be heading towards the same fate as england and paris
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.360]  for sure and we'll be back right with the angry foreigner with your cold
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.560]  frankis visiting the united states and barely addressing the issue of
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.920]  pedophilia within the catholic church we have this former house speaker
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:10.360]  denis haster negotiating a guilty plea over charges he paid
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:14.200]  3.5 million in hush money to cover up sexual contact with a male
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:17.960]  the daily mail reports a may indictment says hasard agreed to pay 3.5
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:21.880]  million to someone identified only as individual a to hide past misconduct
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.160]  it has been claimed that individual a is a victim of sexual abuse that hasard
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:28.600]  was attempting to silence citing anonymous sources the ap reports
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.480]  that the payments were intended to conceal claims of sexual misconduct
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.440]  believed to be linked to his days as a high school teacher before leaving
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.640]  congress in 2007 hasard was the longest ever serving
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.920]  republican speaker because when you have skeletons in the closet you are easy
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:45.720]  to control hasard was a wrestling coach and teacher from 1965 to 1981
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:49.240]  hasard took groups of boys on foreign trips including diving expeditions to
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:53.000]  the bahamas and now that john bainer is stepping down under his own free will
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.640]  it makes you wonder what skeletons he's hiding in his closet
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:59.320]  rob dew reporting for info wars dot com and info wars nightly news
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.920]  introducing secret 12 the new info wars life vitamin b12 formulation secret

[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.520]  i'm plowing through the show even though i've got you know man flu
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.800]  but i'm actually glad that i got it this week because next week
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:52.280]  i'm going to go to austin i'm flying to austin and i'm going to grab as many of
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:56.840]  these health products as i can because as you can see from the website info wars
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.600]  store dot com the independent reviews are overwhelmingly
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:04.600]  positive and that's you know it's it's not us saying it it's independent
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.520]  reviews people who have got these products they've worked for them and
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:13.080]  they're really having massive benefits i need to get my hands on the um
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:17.000]  knockout because i've been taking melatonin which has been hit and miss so
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.840]  i'm really looking forward to getting my hands on these health products which
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:24.520]  have got rave reviews at info wars store dot com
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.480]  including liver shield which is currently on sale
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:33.800]  2995 that's reduced from 3995 again didn't plug these products last hour but
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:38.120]  this is crucial to support what we're doing because we're not funded by
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.480]  george soros we're not funded by massive
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:47.320]  giant pharmaceutical companies we're funded by the listeners by the people
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.160]  who buy these products and these products work for them
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.440]  which is proven by these independent third party
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.480]  reviews and you can see them all on the website
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.960]  at info wars store dot com but we're talking to the angry foreigner
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.840]  that's the moniker he goes by on youtube he's had
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:09.720]  several viral video hits he's an immigrant a bosnian immigrant that moved to
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:14.200]  sweden and is now experiencing the joys the
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.960]  benefits of mass immigration and again to make that
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:22.120]  distinction not immigrants who move there to work hard
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:26.760]  to integrate to assimilate to learn the language to contribute something to
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:30.520]  society which is you know he's a perfect example of that
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:35.320]  but to the people who are being used for example with this migrant crisis
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.760]  as a gravy train to dilute people's rights
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:44.120]  to dilute social cohesion so the eu bureaucracy which is supported by many
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.840]  european governments can take hold and can really
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:54.120]  federalize to an increasing extent and have people become more dependent on
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.400]  government because there's such a lack of cohesion
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.720]  a lack of a sense of community the big government
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.080]  takes its place we're going to go to your calls now
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:10.520]  first up angelo in new york angelo you're on the air go ahead
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:16.600]  hey paul joseph blotkin the angry forna pyson how are you
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:21.720]  hey what's going on i want to say congratulations to you
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:27.560]  uh the angry forna because it takes a lot of courage to do what you're doing
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.000]  and i understand that immigration is an important topic
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.320]  and it's important to you and plant parenthood is a similar topic that i
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:42.760]  felt similar to uh once i realized and i did the research
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.400]  that the fetus reacts to sound it outraged me
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:52.680]  that uh people would just plant parenthood was chopping up babies i mean
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:57.800]  that was just horrible and i went out and i uh spoke out against it against
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:02.680]  plant parenthood in my neighborhood and i put the video up on
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:07.240]  my facebook and i got calls from a few friends of mine
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:12.280]  miss angelo are you okay i mean is everything okay
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.360]  uh i'm like yeah everything is fine why oh you made that plant parenthood
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.120]  video oh uh is everything okay you sure
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.720]  i'm like dude they're chopping up babies man
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.640]  i mean don't you feel is there anything that you still
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:33.480]  feel strong about is there anything so um i mean just to jump in this is what i
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:37.160]  found the difference between you know quote liberals and
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:40.280]  conservatives or liberals and libertarians so
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:44.760]  conservatives and libertarians will be happy to make friends with and to be
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.480]  polite and pleasant towards people with whom they disagree
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.920]  even if it's on fundamental issues like abortion
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:59.000]  but then as a libertarian or as a conservative if you kind of venture
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.600]  out into the public commons and dare express your views
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.000]  which other people might disagree with that it isn't a case where
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.240]  oh that's okay we disagree we can have a debate about it but then we can come
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.920]  together as friends and you know break bread and
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.360]  still remain friends but with liberals it seems like
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.800]  if you do that they ostracize you instantly it's kind of an immediate
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:27.640]  backlash which is what you were talking about in sweden earlier
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:32.280]  you were talking about the peer pressure where people will instantly just
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:37.720]  lash out and ostracize you from a social group if you dare to even
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.040]  express any kind of skepticism towards their beliefs is that correct
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.800]  yeah and it's interesting you know that that's exactly it and i personally i
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.160]  consider myself to be a left-winger i just want to be clear with that like
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:53.160]  i'm pro high taxes free health care free
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:56.760]  you know free schooling all that shit but i have noticed that people on the
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.040]  left are way more narrow minded than the opposite than the
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:03.720]  other way around and there's actually done there's been some experiments on
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.120]  this i don't remember the names of those who did
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:09.400]  experiment but a right-wing journalist in sweden
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.800]  wrote about this and he said basically that they investigated how well
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:19.160]  people can put themselves in their opponents shoes
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.680]  argument-wise and he turned out that left-wingers
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.200]  genuinely believe that people to the right
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.200]  have bad intentions like they believe that they
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:34.680]  hate poor people not that they just want to help them differently
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:39.320]  and you know they just can't understand that people can have good intentions
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:42.760]  and you know the same goals but completely different methods
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:47.080]  in going about to get to those goals so
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:52.200]  just there's definitely something to that right and you call yourself a
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.880]  left-winger but again it's the fact that so-called
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:00.280]  progressives have become so authoritarian and so overreaching
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:04.440]  that left-wingers classical liberals now
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.720]  have to go to the lengths to differentiate themselves from these
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.080]  quote progressives because they actually believe in
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.120]  free speech and though they may disagree with
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:18.120]  conservatives on certain issues they're willing to have a dialogue
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.040]  to have a debate and not immediately react with horror
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.960]  and backlash and try to censor their ideological
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:30.120]  opponents so that's again an important distinction to make obviously
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:34.280]  you describe yourself as a left-wing you're obviously a classical liberal
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.960]  with some views that contradict progressives
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:42.920]  but now you're being you know placed under skepticism under review by
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.200]  progressives because of what you say about mass immigration
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:50.360]  Santino in California you're on the air go ahead Santino
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:55.320]  yes my question to the angry foreigner is
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:02.040]  that the majority of the Sunni people the Sunni Syrian refugees the majority
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:06.360]  of the refugees from Syria that are coming to the rest
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:10.680]  the most the majority of them are mostly
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:14.040]  Sunnis who are fleeing prosecution from Assad
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:18.200]  and the majority of the women who are coming that are Sunni are also fleeing
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.080]  prosecution because their sons ended up joining ISIS
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:25.720]  their sons ended up getting sniped and Assad found out where they live
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:29.080]  now they have to come here so basically they're going to bring their rhetoric
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.840]  here they're going to bring every of their
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:36.840]  rhetoric thoughts these people are tech fairies these people want to come here
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:41.400]  say Allah Akbar and bull themselves up these people are not real muslims
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.920]  i'm a shia muslim i smoke cigarettes i like to drink whiskey
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:49.720]  i like to eat pork i'm moderate muslim these people are not moderate muslims
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:53.240]  if they come here it is not going to be good and it's not going to be in our
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:58.120]  best interest to let these people here and that's all i have to say
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:03.000]  let's before i go to the angry foreigner the figures show that only one in five
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.440]  of these quote refugees coming to europe are Syrian refugees so it's one in
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.120]  five the other four in five are coming from Afghanistan
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:15.960]  they're coming from northern Africa and that's an important point to make
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.480]  because we've been presented with this narrative by the media
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.640]  that the vast majority of them are Syrian refugees fleeing ISIS
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:29.560]  that's not the case four fifths of them on 72 percent of them are men
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.920]  only 15 percent and 13 percent women and children
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.240]  but angry foreigner your response to the caller
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:43.160]  uh well he doesn't ask any question did he
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:47.000]  no i think he was trying to make the distinction between
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.640]  moderate and extremist muslims but i don't think you can make that distinction
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:55.960]  between you know shia and sonny i mean i've got a very good friend
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.880]  that is a sonny muslim she's by no means an extremist muslim
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.080]  so i don't think that's the distinction that we have to make right
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:07.400]  yeah i agree with you um yeah i don't i don't make a distinction between shia
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.800]  and sonny like that i'd make a distinction between
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:14.200]  moderates muslims who want to live in a secular society and just various types
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.320]  of fundamentalist and radicals the worst kind is
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:23.000]  wahhabists that's the ideology that al-qaeda and
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.440]  islamic state is based on and i mean if you take a
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:30.760]  a moderate wahhabist you have this Saudi Arabia like a moderate wahhabist
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:34.280]  isn't gonna cut your head off but he's gonna sit there and go like oh well
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.800]  yeah i think it's good if we stone cheating women to death
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.560]  yeah i think that's reasonable let's let's let's have that as a rule
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:45.000]  like that's a moderate wahhabist a radical wahhabist
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.520]  is the islamic state so i'd rather use those terms instead

[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:26.840]  talking to the angry foreigner who is a bosnian immigrant to sweden about
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:31.960]  sweden's mass immigration policy their open door policy
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:35.320]  in light of this migrant crisis which is currently unfolding
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:38.440]  before the break we had a caller who brought up
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:43.000]  the swedish rape epidemic now this is something that i've
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.600]  wrote about made videos about on several occasions
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:51.320]  basically last year the swedish prime minister unveiled the new swedish prime
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.440]  minister the leftist unveiled what he called a
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:25:00.040]  feminist government those were his words and yet at the same time
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:04.360]  they're importing a deluge of muslim immigrants predominantly muslim
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:08.920]  immigrants who treat women as second-class citizens
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:15.720]  but there's a debate over whether this 1400 increase in rapes
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:19.800]  since sweden opened its doors to mass immigration back in the 70s
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:25.960]  is a result of sweden expanding its terms for what is defined as rape
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:30.760]  or if it's purely due to the fact that they've got these waves of muslims
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:35.400]  emigrating to the country who do treat women as second-class citizens
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:41.000]  who are inclined as part of their culture as treating women as inferior
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.800]  to rape more women now if you look at the situation in the migrant camps in
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:50.040]  germany a number of women's organizations in germany have raised
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:54.680]  the alarm to the fact that children and women are
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:58.840]  being raped in these migrant camps and the media
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:03.960]  and the police authorities in germany are covering up the details of those
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:08.520]  incidents for months so as to not give legitimacy and
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:12.120]  these were their own words to not give legitimacy to quote
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:17.960]  right-wing protesters who are anti-immigration who are anti this mass
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:21.800]  migrant wave so the angry foreigner the the caller
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.400]  brought up the point of this rape epidemic in sweden
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:29.640]  people are now calling sweden the rape capital of europe
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:34.120]  what is the truth between the left who argue that
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:38.360]  it's only increased to such an extent because they've redefined the terms
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:43.080]  compared to the right which points out the fact that you know 72 percent
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:48.440]  of these perpetrators are identified as foreigners that this is part of this
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.600]  male muslim culture what is the truth in that distinction
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:56.120]  with these with this 1400 percent rape increase
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:01.320]  in sweden well both have a point i mean it is true that sweden has a very
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:05.720]  generous definition of rape and also a generous way of counting statistics
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.760]  for example if a woman is raped 300 times but the same man
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:12.520]  we will count that as 300 rapes instead of one rape which they will
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:15.720]  do in other countries so you can't actually compare rape statistics
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.760]  internationally but it is also true that immigrants are over
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:21.960]  represented when it comes to rape for example if you look at the court
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:25.800]  verdicts from 2010 little more than half of all the
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:30.040]  rapes were done by immigrants and that is absurd considering that
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:33.960]  15 percent of our population is born outside of sweden
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.640]  if you count immigrants and their children if you count second generation
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.520]  like for instance children who have at least one
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:43.400]  parent who is an immigrant who is born outside of sweden
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:46.680]  then the immigrant population becomes 30 percent
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:50.840]  so to think that you have a minority of 30 percent who are responsible for more
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:54.440]  than half the rapes in the country is pretty absurd
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:28:00.920]  so there is both sides have some truth to them i would say
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.840]  so you know they they they try and extend these
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:08.680]  this definition of rape i mean we had a store in info wars dot com a couple of
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:12.360]  weeks ago where in american colleges calling
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:16.600]  someone a slot is defined as an act of sexual violence
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:20.440]  and you know the left in many cases will use that to
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:24.200]  impune you know college goers in america as
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:28.520]  all would be potential rapists but then they use the same expanded
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:31.960]  definition to kind of absolve the blame
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.800]  when it comes to muslim migrant rape in sweden
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:41.240]  so again they you know it's it's passing the terms on the fact that
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:45.080]  they introduce the these expanded definitions but then they use them in
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.680]  different contexts to either blame in one case
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:53.880]  or absolve people of rape so it's an interesting conundrum but as you said
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:59.160]  the the simple mathematics of it and again i know facts are racist you know
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:02.600]  god forbid i would bring up facts and mathematics but
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:06.840]  the muslim population the migrant population in sweden
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:10.840]  the fact that they're responsible for over 50 percent of rapes as you said
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:15.160]  compared to their population i'll suggest that there is a problem right
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:18.840]  i wouldn't necessarily say that they're muslims i have no idea what religion
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:22.360]  they are but there are certain countries are
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:26.120]  overrepresented in africa and the middle east so
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:30.360]  i would put it like that but i mean they're predominantly muslim right
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:33.320]  i mean we got we got to say they're predominantly muslim
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:37.640]  but that's in their culture do you mean that they're Arabs or that they're
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:41.800]  practicing muslims no that they're practicing muslims and that it is
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:45.160]  well i have no idea because there's no statistics about that
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:49.480]  so okay we'll be back after break with the angry foreigner more we're on the
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:57.800]  march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:05.160]  a georgia high school went into lockdown the other day after a student showed up
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:10.520]  with a confederate flag the incident started when a tenth grade boy arrived
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:13.720]  at rock mart high school with the rebel flag
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:17.240]  attached to his backpack he was then confronted
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:25.000]  by two black students who were upset by the flag and a fight broke out
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.920]  the scuffle was quickly broken up by teachers and staff
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.600]  all three students were searched and no weapons were found
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:36.680]  but then rumors began to circulate that more students would be bringing
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:42.920]  confederate flags to school and a campus lockdown was ordered no word as to
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:47.640]  whether or not the black students are equally upset with president brock obama
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:54.520]  who also displayed the confederate flag on his own campaign pin in 2012

[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:36.840]  five more just filling in for alex jones and we're talking to the angry foreigner
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:43.000]  who bear in mind describes himself as a leftist so don't be fooled by the name
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.840]  he is a classical liberal but he's faced some
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:53.080]  flak as anyone would in sweden for opposing the policy of mass
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:56.280]  immigration we're going to go some more of your calls in a second
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:01.960]  but first i wanted to ask you the sweden democrats which are as far as i know
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.560]  considered conservative considered right wing in sweden
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:09.720]  they're currently surging in the polls so whereas we get this
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:13.000]  portrayal of sweden as this you know liberal
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  extremist liberal even backwater the conservative opposition to these mass
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.960]  immigration policies are currently enjoying
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:27.000]  significant success in the polls so is there likely to be a legitimate
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.920]  backlash against this with people voting out the government
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:35.320]  or is as you mentioned before the peer pressure the social taboo
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:39.880]  of opposing this likely to hold sway or is there going to be a
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:45.400]  conservative backlash against these immigration policies in sweden
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:48.440]  the sweden democrats are social conservatives
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:52.440]  and i believe that they will become the biggest party in the future
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:56.280]  because you know you don't have to say what party you vote for so there is no
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:59.640]  the peer pressure doesn't really apply there and i definitely think it's some
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:03.400]  kind of backlash i mean people are tired of multiculturalism
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:07.320]  like nobody's against influences from other cultures
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.000]  like you know taking a foreign aspect of a
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.360]  different culture and incorporating it into your own
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.120]  people like that that's why we have meatballs in sweden that's why a pizza
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:21.400]  so that's not a problem but that's not multiculturalism that doesn't even have
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:24.360]  a name i mean that's just what happens in reality cultures
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:29.240]  evolve through time multiculturalism is engineered by politicians and forced
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.240]  under the people i have a perfect example of that
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:36.680]  we have a debate show here on public service media
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:41.640]  every week they do a episode about current events and a while back we had
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:45.080]  we actually had people discuss on prime time television
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:49.080]  whether or not we should allow gender segregated bath halls in the name of
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:52.040]  a lot because there were these muslim
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.880]  arab and african women sitting there saying that oh we can't bathe in the
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:59.240]  presence of men that's against our culture that's against our religion
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:04.280]  and it's like if you need to have an argument about it if you need to discuss
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:08.440]  whether we should have a change towards this direction that's not natural
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:12.120]  that is forced by someone else and we've had
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:15.400]  several cases over the years where muslims show up to their
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:18.840]  workplace these are fundamentalists not moderates they show up to their workplace
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:21.880]  and they refuse to shake hands with female co-workers
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:25.240]  or even their boss because she's a woman and
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.520]  the the employer tells them that they need to adapt they need to shake hands
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:31.560]  need to be able to greet people but the muslims get offended
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:35.160]  so they sue them for discrimination and get
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:41.960]  thousands of crowns in damages because the court's reasoning is that
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:46.600]  in a multicultural society you need to be able to greet in more than one way
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:50.200]  and that's ridiculous i mean most people think that's ridiculous most people
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:53.080]  think that you should adapt to the country that you come to because that's
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:55.560]  just common sense that's common courtesy
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:59.240]  and most people want to live in sweden they don't want to live in afghanistan
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:03.480]  so yeah i think definitely it's a backlash i mean we're accepting way more
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:08.120]  immigrants than we can handle uh when i got here in
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:14.520]  1990 there was three ghettos in sweden in 2012 there were 186
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:17.960]  our society has not been going towards a good direction
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:21.880]  we're taking people in but we're not taking care of them our system is
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:25.800]  guaranteed to put people into segregation
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:30.120]  and guaranteed to cause bad integration because you can't have
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:35.640]  a massive immigration the size of ours and then expect people to mix together
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:38.760]  what's going to happen is that they're going to end up in these areas where
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.880]  there's cheap housing and they're going to stay in those areas
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:44.680]  and they're going to they're not going to have a reason to learn swedish
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:48.280]  because there's mostly immigrants in that area and swedish is not a natural
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:51.320]  part of your everyday life in that neighborhood
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:54.840]  people go around in certain areas just talking arab so
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:58.440]  obviously things have failed
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:02.760]  yeah i mean even merkel and cameron admitted that um a few years ago that
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:06.600]  multiculturalism has failed because it's not about
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.920]  gradual migration as you said i think in one of your videos
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:14.280]  if we accept to these people if we had time to assimilate them
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:18.360]  in relatively low numbers then it could be a success
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:22.040]  we could embrace the positive aspects of their culture
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:27.000]  we could embrace you know the diversity that is positive the food
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.760]  for example as you mentioned but that's not what's happening it's a wave and
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:34.120]  these people are not assimilating they're not speaking
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:37.720]  the language large numbers of them and they're actually causing
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:41.080]  problems for the immigrants who do make the effort
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:44.520]  to learn the language to integrate to get jobs
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:48.200]  as you have done and so that's that's part of the problem
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:51.960]  but why do you think that european governments and especially germany and
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:55.560]  sweden are basically rolling out the red carpet
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:39:00.200]  surely it's not because of their humanitarian virtues right there must
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:03.960]  be a larger political agenda as to why they're allowing these
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:09.160]  migrants to flood the country in such large numbers
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:13.960]  yeah i don't know why there are certain theories but i do i absolutely do not
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.600]  believe this has anything to do with humanitarianism
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.520]  because i mean if you look at it the majority of refugees are stuck in the
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:25.160]  middle east there's like it's five percent of all
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:28.360]  refugees that managed to come to sweden and those those are the ones that have
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:32.200]  the money to smuggle themselves north so you're not helping the most
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:36.200]  amount of people by accepting like five percent of people
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:39.480]  so there's something else to it germany i've been told
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:43.080]  needs cheap labor so basically they're importing
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:47.800]  workforce right now according to my understanding sweden on the other hand
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:50.760]  is a bit weirder i don't understand that i i've heard
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:55.640]  politicians say that oh well in the future we need people who can take care of
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:00.040]  our elderly so they think that they're importing workforce
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:06.040]  when statistics show that you know 80 percent of Somalians don't have jobs
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:09.640]  well that's what i was gonna say the the figures that i read
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:14.440]  58 percent of welfare payments in sweden go to immigrants so it's not as if
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:18.360]  they're filling jobs that swedes don't want to do because they're getting
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:24.360]  most of the welfare payments and after seven years around half of
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:28.360]  immigrants don't have jobs so the integration into the work
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:32.760]  market is terrible like i have no idea what's going on here
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.520]  i heard another theory which was quite interesting is that
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:42.600]  um and i'm i'm very bad at economics so i don't like i can't investigate this
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:45.720]  really but the guy was basically saying that importing a massive amount of
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:50.600]  people like this is a way to avoid a financial collapse
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:54.440]  because you're basically trying to uh you're you're importing people that you
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:59.080]  can put into debt so you can avoid inflation or
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:03.160]  something to that extent uh there's a number of theories but
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:08.520]  i absolutely do not think that these psychopaths in our parliament
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:13.240]  are being nice that's the last thing i would guess
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:18.760]  tj in minnesota you're on the air with the angry foreigner tj go ahead
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:25.560]  yes sir brother british watson uh and mr sweden there i would like to give you
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.240]  my credentials in the middle east that were high enough for diplomatic
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:33.160]  community in the 1990s but i'm not going to do that
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:39.640]  because your call receiver said i have to form it into a question
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:46.040]  but i think both of you gentlemen are headed for a 10x target bullseye
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:50.840]  and i know that there are three monotheistic religions
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:57.960]  islam christianity and jewish faith and they better hang together or hang
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:03.640]  separately and i know i know much about the prayerfulness
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:09.480]  and the god fairness of true mausoleum leaders of many middle east
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:15.880]  countries but i have a question and the question is this
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:24.920]  and it only formed at noon today prudent nobody hates nazis like the russians
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:29.560]  and apparently according to mainstream propagandist news i want
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:33.880]  i don't know if you've heard it yet but he's taken out
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:42.600]  by aircraft and whatever right now in syria he's taken out lc iada
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:49.640]  he's taking out isis isle and whatever form you want to put that un
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:56.840]  us diabolical demon in words with and apparently it
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:00.280]  has happened are you guys aware of this sirs
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.560]  yeah we posted that up on info wars dot com earlier
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:09.160]  russia has begun airstrikes in syria against isis targets and of course
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:13.880]  for three years the albarum administration has been arming these
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:19.240]  quote moderate rebels in syria who in many cases go on to
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:23.800]  hand their weapons over to isis in other cases defect
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:29.160]  to isis but then russia and putin he's suddenly the bad guy for
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:33.880]  actually wanting to move tanks wanting to fly aircraft over syria
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:39.400]  to actually target these isis terrorists then you have turkey
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:43.640]  as opposed to allies bombing the Kurds who are fighting isis
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:47.640]  you have saudi arabia coming out and saying that they're going to threaten
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:52.440]  the military option in syria unless asad steps down
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:56.760]  again siding with isis they want to overthrow asad
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:00.280]  and this was the very origin this was the very cause
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:04.920]  of the migrant crisis in the first place which is now impacting
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:10.120]  germany and sweden the angry foreigner your comments on that
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:15.000]  yeah that's something that really annoys me about the whole debate especially in
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.200]  the media and the political debate is that everybody is talking about
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:22.520]  right now we need to take in a bunch of refugees right now when
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:26.200]  when nobody's talking about why these people are running to begin with like
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:31.320]  what caused this crisis it's basically a responsible politics it's us
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:34.120]  voting for politicians that contribute to wars you know
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:38.120]  sweden's government has also financially supported
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:41.800]  terrorists i mean we we supported the al-qaeda
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.280]  allies the syrian recovery trust front our ally with al-qaeda
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:50.200]  tactically allied and we gave them several millions
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:54.200]  so you know it's it's it's a you think it's
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:59.560]  short-sighted and one-sided that nobody's thinking about the future like how
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:02.440]  we're going to take care of these people and nobody's thinking of well how did
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:05.560]  we get to this situation the past they're just
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:09.560]  thinking right now we need to import people and
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:16.280]  that's that's really bad there is no nuance whatsoever in the public debate

[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:17.000]  we're gonna switch now to our next guest again fascinating topic it's not one
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.680]  that we've explored that deeply here on the radio show i've
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:24.520]  made a few videos about it but that topic is
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:27.960]  gamergate and this is the use of video games the
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:33.160]  hijacking of the video game industry for purposes of brainwashing
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:37.880]  and reeducation and we've got a guest theodore morgan major
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:42.840]  who is a researcher with seal team six which is a research team focused on
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:47.480]  the gaming industry and the gamergate controversy theodore
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.360]  welcome to the show
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:57.320]  we've not got theodore yet okay so we're gonna talk to theodore in a second but
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:01.560]  i've made videos about this again it's quite a technical subject
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:06.360]  gamergate is how people within the gaming industry
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:10.600]  basically social justice warriors extreme left wingers
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.760]  came to the conclusion and this is backed up by the evidence yesterday we saw
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:18.600]  a poll trust in mainstream media has dropped has plummeted
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.520]  to an all-time low so people don't believe what they see
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:26.680]  on mainstream news people don't believe what they see in hollywood
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:30.040]  we had propaganda placement in hollywood for
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:33.720]  decades now people have got wise to that
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.560]  these social engineers and that's what it is it's a program of social
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:41.400]  engineering it's a program of reeducation they've abandoned these
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:45.160]  traditional media outlets which are failing
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:48.440]  in terms of their influence in terms of their reach
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:52.120]  of course if the mainstream media gets together and decides
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:55.880]  we're going to coalesce around this common narrative around a certain issue
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:58.360]  for example you know the migrant invasion is
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:04.040]  a humanitarian benefit for europe then the power of those mainstream media
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:08.280]  outlets combined is still a force to be reckoned with
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:12.120]  but if it's completely you know diluted they don't have
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:16.280]  individual power so they have to resort to other outlets
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:21.560]  to have that social engineering impact because more and more people are tuning
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:25.080]  out of the mainstream media i'm going to go through i guess now
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:29.640]  who is a researcher into the gamergate controversy theodore morgan major
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:34.600]  welcome to the show nice to have uh be a board
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:38.120]  now let's just sum up gamergate okay
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:42.520]  what's gamergate why does it matter why should people care in two minutes go
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:46.120]  ahead uh gamergate is an ongoing events with
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.840]  various groups competing against each other
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:52.360]  um one group that you have people that are interested in ethics in gaming
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:55.720]  journalism which most are aware of you have one group that are the sock
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:59.320]  justin loonies that have been trying to push their far left agenda
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:03.560]  onto games that's another obvious one another one are some of the ones that
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:07.160]  are not far left loonies that are sick and tired of said far left loonies and
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:10.760]  have ended up siding with gamergates um then of course there's trolls messing
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:12.920]  with both sides of the field it's a bit of a
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:16.280]  complete mess if you really wanted to try and cover it it would be
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:21.400]  more akin to trying to cover a bloody war an information war
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:24.200]  people end up trying to bring it to something else but
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:30.200]  that's what i think it is and this basically arose out of the fact that
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:33.640]  the gaming media or elements of the gaming media
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:38.040]  around a year ago or just over a year ago basically came out and said that
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:43.240]  gaming was dead and buried again gaming is the most profitable
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:48.280]  entertainment industry in america right now it surpasses movies it surpasses
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:51.960]  anything else so they came out and declared that that was dead
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:55.960]  they need to hijack that for social engineering
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:00.360]  and bring it to a point where games video games are used for
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:04.440]  you know conditioning and we'll get into what kind of conditioning they want
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:07.560]  after the break um we're going to go to our guest after the break
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.760]  again taking your calls here on the alex joneshowell get the number for you
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.080]  in a moment but we're talking to theodore morgan major now he's a researcher
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:19.800]  with seal team six this is an organization
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:24.280]  that has delved into the gamergate controversy they've connected the dots
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:29.800]  not only with the agenda which is to use video games for social reeducation
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:33.880]  and again people say feminists have no power just ignore them
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:37.560]  you know they have no influence whatsoever this is a key industry in
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:40.680]  which they are implementing their influence
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:44.920]  amongst the next generation this is key we'll be back on the alex joneshowell

[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:19.320]  we're back live it's the Alex Jones here with me your host Paul Joseph
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:23.480]  Watson topstoryinfo.com right now Kurt Nimo
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:26.840]  New York Times begins propaganda campaign against Russian
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:30.600]  airstrikes that's right actually trying to kill
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:34.680]  frigging isis terrorists that's bad no we should
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:38.120]  arm the syrian rebels the so-called moderate rebels
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:44.200]  who are giving their weapons to isis who are defecting to isis so the
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:47.160]  New York Times on the day that rusher announces
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:51.560]  that it's trying to airstrike and actually kill isis militants
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:55.480]  what the obama administration has failed to do for over a year
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:58.760]  they're now basically saying that that's wrong because
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:03.240]  they haven't targeted the right area even though they're trying to defend this
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:07.800]  strategic airbase which is fundamental to the survival
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:11.800]  of the syrian government which is taking on isis
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:16.200]  again illustrating the point that the obama administration that the mainstream
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:19.480]  media in the guise of the New York Times
[01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:23.480]  doesn't want isis to be eliminated because
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:27.160]  they're basically in support of Assad being
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:31.640]  overthrown and that has been the case for two three four years
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:35.720]  supporting al-qaeda linked rebels who have defected
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:42.120]  and given their weapons to isis so Putin's bad for trying to kill isis
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:46.360]  obama's good for arming rebels who give their weapons
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:50.680]  to isis that's a narrative that the new york times is trying to make us
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:53.560]  swallow right now but we're talking about
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:59.240]  gamergate with theodore morgan major who is a researcher with steel team six
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:04.920]  now theodore you wrote this pdf file which basically outlines the case
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:08.200]  to summarize the findings and i quote from the pdf file
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:12.280]  the purpose of declaring gamers dead and this is what we discussed before the
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:15.080]  break and to normalize gaming among society
[01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:19.400]  was to change public perception to allow lobbying efforts down the line to
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:22.840]  succeed as it turns out games ought to be repurposed
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:26.840]  as learning aids and eventually used as the primary tool of
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:32.600]  indoctrination in schools so explain why they're repurposing
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:36.600]  video games as reeducation tools for the public while
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:40.360]  television news while hollywood while hollywood films decline in
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:45.400]  influence because the gaming media currently
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:48.840]  is in a bubble it's built on a lot of hype
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.240]  it's built on a lot of things that are going to come crashing down in
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:57.160]  upcoming years the problem that that they're facing is
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:00.840]  they need to be able to reach a new audience and what they're going to try
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:04.440]  and do is they're going to try and reach
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:07.400]  out to edtech which they've been doing for a while they're going to try and
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.960]  reach out to the defense they've done that a
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:13.240]  little bit too but the reason they're doing this
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:17.000]  is because they're selling it to make money
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.120]  that's the primary goal of these a secondary goal
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:23.800]  is a lot of them are here this ideology to begin with
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:27.960]  this progressive ideology that just just so happens to
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:36.280]  support other interests it's a it's multiple groups one of them is basically
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:40.920]  how to word it microsoft and that particular crew
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:45.320]  they've been putting a lot of money in with
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:50.600]  certain interest groups to promote this particular bits
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:56.440]  man i'm doing bad at this i'm sorry
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:59.960]  what examples of social engineering are they pushing
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:05.080]  from my perspective it seems like video games are really successful right now
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:09.240]  as merely a form of entertainment right it's the biggest grossing

[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:27.320]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:31.960]  it's paul debokson back live with the alex jones show this Wednesday
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:36.600]  september 30th edition we're talking to theodore morgan major
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:41.240]  there is a researcher with seal team six a research team focused on the gaming
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:44.520]  industry and the gamergate controversy if you don't know
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:49.720]  about gamergate it's basically been raging for over a year
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:54.920]  this is an example of how social justice warriors and left-wing activists
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:01:01.880]  have hid their agenda behind other guises so again you know television news
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:07.640]  hollywood we've had propaganda placement for decades in those two industries
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:12.440]  it's not as successful as it once was in fact we've got the polls
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:16.360]  trust in mainstream media is at a record low
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:21.080]  so people are no longer believing what they see on the television news
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:24.280]  they're no longer believing the narratives that they see
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:28.920]  within hollywood movie scripts within television scripts
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:33.400]  some people would argue that you know americans love to be lied to
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:37.160]  that it doesn't even matter whether trust is at an all-time low or not
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:42.520]  but this has caused consternation amongst the social engineers
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:46.600]  amongst the control freaks because their audience is declining
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:49.880]  in those genres and they're becoming less trustworthy
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:54.200]  so now they've moved into different genres different industries
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:59.400]  to try and maintain and uphold that social engineering
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:02.920]  in terms of you know social justice warrior
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:06.920]  left-wing narratives that they need to uphold to continue
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:11.480]  and prolong their power that's basically what it centers around
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:14.440]  and gamergate is a perfect example of this
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:19.000]  this is how left-wing activists and feminists have seized control of an
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  industry which should be based around consumer demand
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.440]  and entertainment and they've turned it into this
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:30.520]  basically a platform for re-education and that's insidious
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:34.120]  that's North Korea like we shouldn't have people
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:37.960]  with political agendas involved in entertainment
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:42.040]  if it's completely open source and they you know admittedly
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:45.080]  you know display that to the to the full public view
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:48.040]  then that's fine but when they're doing it behind the scenes
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:51.800]  when they're hiding it behind this supposedly neutral platform
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:55.880]  then it becomes a major problem and we need to talk about it
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:59.800]  so Theodore Morgan major just describe
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:03.400]  how they're using video games for political re-engineering
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:06.920]  what messages are they putting within the these video games
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:11.880]  to push their political agenda and why should we be concerned about that
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:14.760]  um
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:18.040]  specifically they are citing their own work
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:22.120]  they are pushing together into groups
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:24.760]  damn it
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:30.920]  they have been engaged in cytogenesis which is basically
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:34.760]  citing each other's work which ends up eventually getting fed to
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:38.520]  wikipedia as people end up knowing how wikipedia works
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:42.280]  ends up taking citations from supposedly credible sources
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:46.440]  anyways what they've been building that up their cases
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:50.680]  from there to get government money to produce papers
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:57.160]  to give them more authority they've been
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:01.080]  producing lackluster games and getting government money for that
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:06.280]  a notable example for that one would be
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:09.720]  the what led up to a game called depression quest
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:13.160]  that was created by that was Zoe Quinn right that was the same woman that got
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:18.280]  in front of the UN and basically said that calling someone via their
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:22.040]  pre-transition name a transgender person
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:27.160]  is the equivalent of a hate crime or cyber violence so if you get up on
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:31.400]  twitter and call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce then you're
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:34.920]  committing an act of cyber violence and they're
[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:39.720]  literally now calling for the UN to censor these people
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:44.200]  oh yeah it's it's getting bloody ridiculous of course a lot of people
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:47.560]  earlier on were saying oh she's not relevant she's not relevant
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:51.320]  problem is she's a part of a little thick group that was
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:55.400]  called feminist in games and started a little thing called dames making games
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:59.640]  which is okay well fine he had omogamaja on the alex
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:03.160]  this article from medical express appeared on the drudge report chemical
[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:06.200]  exposure linked to rising diabetes obesity risk
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:09.640]  emerging evidence ties endocrine disrupting chemical exposure to two of
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:11.960]  the biggest public health threats facing society
[02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:15.480]  diabetes and obesity and that's according to a statement issued by the
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:18.680]  endocrine society the statement builds upon the society's groundbreaking
[02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:22.280]  2009 report which examines the state of scientific evidence on
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:26.360]  endocrine disrupting chemicals r e dcs and the risk posed to human health
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:30.600]  i made a search using two words info wars in bpa and was astounded by the
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:33.960]  number of times we've covered this subject mounting evidence also indicates
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:38.040]  that edc exposure is connected to infertility hormone related cancers
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:42.760]  neurological issues and other disorders edcs do this by blocking our otherwise
[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:46.040]  interfering with the body's natural hormones and hijacking the body's
[02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:49.800]  chemical messengers and they can alter the way cells develop and grow all

[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:15.160]  alex jones you can run on for a long time
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:18.360]  we're back live while on the alex jones show
[02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:20.660]  it's all shows if what, so
[02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:23.560]  we're talking to Theodore Morgan major about, the Gamergate scandal
[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:26.600]  now if you missed it I put out a video a couple of days ago
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:31.480]  about how feminists got before the UN and bear in mind you know i get
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:35.080]  tweets i get facebook messages from people saying feminists have
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:39.000]  no power they have no influence just ignore them they will
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:44.120]  go away well not true they're embedded deeply within
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:49.960]  the education system in America with gender studies, and now they're going to the UN to
[02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:56.080]  try and pressure the UN to censor websites. And this is important because ICANN, which
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:01.400]  is the organization in charge of domain names on the internet, is basically coming to the
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:08.000]  end of its contract with the US government. So that is going to be up for grabs. The
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:14.320]  UN has intimated its agenda to try and get control of ICANN, to try and get control of
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:20.600]  the internet. So then last week you had these feminists who were involved fundamentally
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:25.720]  in the Gamergate scandal, Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn, basically getting up before
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:32.520]  the UN and saying, people who say, you suck, or you're a liar on Twitter, those people
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:39.480]  need to be censored. So criticizing radical feminism to them is hate speech, is quote
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:47.120]  cyber violence. You know, calling Caitlyn Jenner Bruce, that's a hate crime. That needs
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:52.240]  to be censored by the United Nations. And yes, they don't have power over the internet
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:58.640]  right now. But if you read the Washington Post, the United Nations has a radical dangerous
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:04.240]  vision for the future of the web. And this is not infowars.com. This is the Washington
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:10.760]  Post saying that if they get control of this, if they are able to pressure national governments
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:19.720]  into forcing Facebook and Twitter to proactively police profiles and posts for content that
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:27.160]  might be critical, God forbid, towards radical feminists like Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn,
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:32.880]  then the censorship is coming. And this is why feminists do have influence, because they're
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:38.760]  listened to by major political bodies who have influence and power. They're not just
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:44.080]  ranting on Tumblr. They're not just ranting on Twitter. We can't just ignore them and
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:49.640]  brush them off as crazy lunatics, because they are being listened to by the likes of
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:56.600]  the United Nations, by Google. Google had an ideas panel recently where they quote,
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:01.280]  they wanted to take on internet harassment. And of course, the people they consulted for
[02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:08.640]  this program are key participants in harassing people on the internet. We're talking about
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:14.320]  feminists, for example, in Canada, who out people for saying that somebody who makes
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:19.280]  a video game, an online video game in which the participants are able to punch Anita Sarkeesian
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:24.720]  in the face, maybe shouldn't, you know, be docs. Their address shouldn't be revealed.
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:31.320]  They shouldn't be subjected to physical harassment. That guy in Canada is now facing six months
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:36.920]  in prison for disagreeing with feminists. While the feminists who encourage people to
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:43.440]  harass this young teenager in Canada, they're, you know, they're wanted professionals of,
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:47.240]  you know, oppression Olympics. And they're the kind of people who are being listened
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:55.480]  to by Google, by the UN in terms of censoring anything that's critical of feminists or merely
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:12:00.760]  disagreeing with them on the internet, which is why this is a threat, which is why gamergate
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:05.400]  is a massive issue and why people should understand it. And I made a video about this a couple
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:10.120]  of days ago, and we're going to go to this clip now before we return to our guests. So
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:14.160]  let's go to the clip. Feminists want the UN to censor the internet
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:19.560]  to prevent cyber violence. But what does Anita Sarkeesian define as harassment and cyber
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:24.960]  violence? Harassment is, as someone had mentioned, it's not just what is legal and illegal,
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:29.840]  right? Harassment is threats of violence, but it's also the day to day grind of you're
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:35.040]  a liar, you suck, you, you know, that's right. Criticizing feminists or calling them out
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:42.520]  on their by saying they suck or their liars now constitutes cyber violence. And remember,
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:47.520]  this is the same woman who thinks everything is sexist, everything is racist, everything
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:53.080]  is homophobic, and you have to point it all out. And what does Zoe Quinn define as harassment
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:58.400]  and cyber violence? Trans women often face a very specific type of violence called dead
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:03.600]  naming where people post pre-transition names. So under this definition, referring to Caitlyn
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:10.120]  Jenner as Bruce will be treated as hate speech because it's not Bruce Jenner, it's Caitlyn
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:15.160]  as she's a stunning woman. They're actually calling for laws and Chinese style internet
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:23.320]  censorship to shut down anyone who hurts their feelings by disagreeing with them on the internet.
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:29.720]  They got me tweets and hurt their feelings and so they had to go to the UN and they had
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:34.720]  to worry about it. I'm figured. The UN wants governments to use their quote, licensing
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:40.600]  prerogative to ensure that telecoms and search engines are only quote, allowed to connect
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:47.000]  with the public if they quote, supervised content and its dissemination. So if an ISP
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:54.200]  or search engine doesn't comply with UN mandated censorship of anti feminist content, they'll
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:59.520]  be cut off from being accessible by the public all together. The likes of Twitter and Facebook
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:06.080]  will be forced to quote, proactively police every profile and post reports the Washington
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:10.760]  Post. And if you think that's unimaginable, then just look at Canada where a man faces
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:17.560]  six months in prison for the crime of disagreeing with feminists on Twitter. 54 year old Greg
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:22.560]  Elliott was also banned from using the internet for the duration of the trial. And all this
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:28.600]  will be overseen by an agency which just appointed Saudi Arabia to head a key UN human rights
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:35.720]  panel, the country that is about to crucify a 17 year old for taking part in an anti
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:40.600]  government protest. But of course these new rules won't apply to feminists. They'll still
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:46.240]  be free to call for the genocide of men or putting us all in concentration camps while
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:51.800]  making bomb threats against weight loss companies and gamergate meetups. So feminists will be
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:56.280]  free to continue to make death threats against anyone who doesn't embrace their radical
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:03.480]  ideology. But don't you dare tell Anita Sarkeesian that she sucks or the UN thought police will
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:33.440]  be knocking at your door. There you have it. Everything is racist. Everything is sexist.
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:38.120]  Everything is homophobic. That was Anita Sarkeesian and she got up in front of the
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:45.360]  UN and basically said that anyone who accuses feminists of lying or saying you suck should
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:52.800]  be subject to internet censorship should have their posts, should have their profiles removed
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:59.240]  after the United Nations pressures national governments to have that happen. So again,
[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:03.520]  people say to me, these feminists are just insane. They have no influence. They have
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:09.480]  no power. Just ignore them. They will go away. No, they're up in front of the United Nations
[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:15.280]  who could be about to seize control of the internet and pressure governments to censor
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:22.640]  people for criticizing feminism. And they talk about cyber touch, you know, mean tweets
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:28.280]  being as bad as someone actually physically reaching through the computer screen and punching
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:34.480]  somebody in the face. We're talking to I guess Theodore, Theodore Morgan Major who is a researcher
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:39.880]  within Gamergate and this is the movement which Anita Sarkeesian, at least the backlash
[02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:45.920]  to it has prompted. What did you think when you saw feminists saying we should censor
[02:16:45.920 --> 02:17:00.400]  people who say you suck on the internet? That's crazy, right? Do we have Theodore? May have
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:05.120]  lost Theodore. We're going to go to some callers now who wants to talk about video games and
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:10.040]  how they're being used to brainwash the public. Taylor in Michigan, you're on the air. Go
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:18.480]  ahead, Taylor. Hey, yeah, I wanted to point out some key examples of the predictive programming
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:25.480]  and basically the desensitizing that the video games are using. You know, Info Wars has
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:31.800]  well documented how the military in the streets is desensitizing us to when they completely
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:37.080]  take over the government systems. And it's the same thing in the video games because
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:42.760]  they're desensitizing us for what's coming and what's coming that they're showing really
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:49.440]  isn't that far down the path. For instance, in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, it starts
[02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:56.000]  out in the intro with the M in Modern Warfare 3 flipped and it's World War 3. And then
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:01.680]  it flips the M and you're starting out in the first level fighting the Russians in New
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:08.880]  York City and they have electronic jamming systems on top of the U.S. Stock Exchange
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:14.160]  and you are Delta Force and you have to go and take down the jamming system. And this
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:21.080]  takes place in August of 2016. And, you know, it was mainstream news that the main things
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:28.880]  that the Russians are working on in terms of technology is electronic jamming systems,
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:38.320]  anti-drone weapons, and then you go to Homefront right here. This video game is ridiculous.
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:43.960]  It's, okay, it's Homefront. On the back of the video game, America has fallen to a savage
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:51.520]  military occupation. Join the resistance and fight for freedom. The year is 2027. You know,
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:57.320]  I think it would actually probably help if you guys could like Google Homefront Video
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:02.680]  Game intro. I'm sure they probably have it on YouTube. It starts off with Hillary Clinton
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:10.640]  and it's like a three-minute intro and it is just totally ridiculous. It shows gas
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:16.000]  going to $20 a barrel. It goes like year by year in a quick like montage edit of just
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:23.480]  America completely falling. But then in Black Ops 2 Call of Duty Black Ops 2, you're fighting
[02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:31.240]  against all drones and all robots and it takes place in 2025. And this is kind of a common
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:37.440]  theme, this 2025 getting pulled to 2020 and they're showing you exactly what's going to
[02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:40.120]  happen. And the main thing is we can look at that.
[02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:44.440]  I guess response to that after the break with the geopolitical stuff. I think they just
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:49.280]  try to make these video games like the most insane crazy scenario you can imagine with
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:53.800]  ISIS with Russia. So that's why they do that. We're going to talk more about the social
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:20:19.800]  reeducation agenda in video games after the break. This is the Alex Jones Show Live. Stay
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:29.820]  tuned.
[02:20:29.820 --> 02:20:34.000]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day. But growing scientific evidences
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:38.400]  emerge showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from

[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:05.080]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinewetz. I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold. By now you've heard
[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:08.920]  our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing. Ten years ago,
[02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:12.520]  I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started
[02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:17.640]  talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID. I felt having
[02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:22.360]  to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy. Soon after, it was also
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:27.240]  announced that credit cards, debit cards, US passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:32.280]  would all soon incorporate RFID. It was then I formed ID Stronghold to share my inventions and
[02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:37.800]  blocking RFID signals with the world. There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[02:22:37.800 --> 02:22:42.920]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected. Please go to idstronghold.com and get
[02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:47.320]  the facts and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.

[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:26.600]  We're back live on the Alex Jones show. I'm your host Paul Joseph Watson. Again,

[02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:38.760]  but it's essential that you continue to support us by buying the products, by getting your subscription
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:44.840]  to prisonplanet.tv. Of course, a lot of stuff you see uploaded to the YouTube channel.
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:53.320]  Extra features, extra bonus features, the whole show at prisonplanet.tv, special reports,
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:59.320]  speeches, all kinds of stuff. It's been going for about 10, 11 years now. That really helps us
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:06.200]  build the platform to challenge the mainstream media narrative, hire more reporters and have
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:12.600]  a bigger impact. Alex Jones talked about the fact that we have some 41 million people
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:18.360]  visiting the website in a monthly period. We need to build on that. We've come so far,
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:24.600]  but we need your continued support to build that platform just to have the presence to
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:29.640]  challenge these narratives, which are still owned by the mainstream media because they,
[02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:35.640]  of course, coalesce together. They support each other. They echo. They parrot each other. We don't
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:41.240]  do that. We're a lone voice with our own opinion, with our own viewpoints, and we need your support.
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:48.520]  So please buy the products at infowarsstore.com and get your subscription at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:55.560]  We're talking about Gamergate. We're talking about how Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn,
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:26:01.320]  these two radical feminists who were integrally involved in the Gamergate scandal,
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:07.960]  basically got up before the UN and said, we need to pressure the UN to pressure national
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:14.120]  governments, which the United Nations has agreed to do, that's their agenda, that's their policy,
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:21.240]  to censor the internet, to prevent ISPs from even having access to the public,
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:28.280]  if they refuse to censor anti-radical feminist content. The examples, as you heard in the video,
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:34.840]  that Anita Sarkeesian gave was saying, quote, you suck, or saying you're a liar.
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:41.560]  So now, no First Amendment when it comes to radical feminists, that's hate speech,
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:47.640]  that's harassment, and that's cyber violence. Theodore, what did you think when you saw
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:55.240]  Anita Sarkeesian get up in front of the UN and say, basically, milk toast criticism of feminist
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:27:00.280]  denotes cyber violence? How insane has it become when it gets to that level?
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:07.320]  Utterly laughable. She reminds me of a man known as Jack Thompson. This particular individual had
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:13.320]  ended up doing a similar thing to the Congress in his efforts at lobbying censorship for games,
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:19.800]  more locally. He had ended up being laughed out of the, out of the room, and eventually,
[02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:25.000]  due to his antics, got disbarred with the media mocking him and laughing at him all the way,
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:29.320]  despite getting all the death and rape threats that Anita Sarkeesian also has been getting.
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:34.920]  And let's talk about those threats because this whole Gamergate controversy,
[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:41.000]  how the media has treated it, is based on the supposition that the only threats are coming
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:48.040]  from Gamergate supporters and that radical feminists never make threats. They never threaten to
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:54.840]  hashtag kill all men. Me personally, I've had direct death threats from feminists who threaten
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:28:00.840]  to behead me, who threaten to put me on agility. Their Twitter accounts don't even get shut down.
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:06.200]  We had the protein world situation where radical feminists threatened to bomb this weight loss
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:12.520]  company because they had a poster campaign featuring a thin model. We had Gamergate
[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:18.680]  meetups that had bomb threats leveled against them. How ridiculous is it when the majority
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:23.560]  from what I see of the threats of the actual threats are coming from radical feminists and
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:30.280]  SJWs themselves? Oh, yeah. I had ended up documenting an earlier piece. It was during
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:36.200]  October. You might be familiar with it. Remember Brianna Wu, one of the women chased out of
[02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:41.640]  games supposedly. She had ended up getting international news. She had ended up getting
[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:48.600]  like 40 bloody articles in like over a weekend. I had ended up comparing it with another person
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:55.240]  that had gotten a similar threat that was known on Twitter as GG Feminist. That she had ended up
[02:28:55.240 --> 02:29:00.520]  finally getting a mention in a vice article about two months after the death threat incident.
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:08.200]  In stark contrast to Brianna Wu, who was supporting the feminist narrative of victimhood,
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:11.400]  had gotten 40 plus articles over the course of a weekend.
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:16.200]  And yeah, ABC News has these specials where they literally show
[02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:22.600]  Anita Sarkeesian getting into a cop car saying how, you know, frightened she is by all these
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:28.200]  Gamergate supporters that are leveling these violent threats. Newsflash. Anyone who is a

[02:30:08.120 --> 02:30:13.880]  a guilty plea over charges he paid 3.5 million in hush money to cover up sexual contact with a
[02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:18.760]  male. The Daily Mail reports a May indictment says Hastard agreed to pay 3.5 million to someone
[02:30:18.760 --> 02:30:23.160]  identified only as individual A to hide past misconduct. It has been claimed that individual
[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:27.720]  A is a victim of sexual abuse that Hastard was attempting to silence. Citing anonymous sources,
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:31.800]  the AP reports that the payments were intended to conceal claims of sexual misconduct believed
[02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:35.880]  to be linked to his days as a high school teacher. Before leaving Congress in 2007,
[02:30:35.880 --> 02:30:39.640]  Hastard was the longest ever serving Republican speaker. Because when you have skeletons in
[02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:45.800]  the closet, you are easy to control. Hastard was a wrestling coach and teacher from 1965 to 1981.
[02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:50.040]  Hastard took groups of boys on foreign trips, including diving expeditions to the Bahamas.
[02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:53.800]  And now that John Boehner is stepping down under his own free will, it makes you wonder what

[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:33.480]  we're back live it's the alex jones show i'm your host paul joseph watson we got rob dew coming up
[02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:39.240]  with the fourth hour overdrive so be sure to stay tuned for that the moment we're talking about
[02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:46.120]  internet censorship the united nations and gamergate we're taking your calls at 800 259
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:52.440]  92 31 and we're talking to i guess theodore morgan major who is the head of a research team
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:58.920]  into gamergate and we're explaining how this is the move by extreme radical left wingers by
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:05.640]  social justice warriors to hijack control of the video games industry because the television news
[02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:12.440]  industry hollywood is increasingly distrusted by the general public so they need to move
[02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:18.680]  into different genres to push this political propaganda to push to push this reeducate
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:25.160]  reeducation and social engineering we've got a youtube clip which was um produced by our guest
[02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:33.800]  in which these social engineers talk about how they openly brazenly got an agenda to use video games
[02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:39.240]  to push this political reeducation and how they're going to do it let's go to that clip
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:46.520]  we have an opportunity to create a new form of games we need to design games that are good to
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:52.600]  learn we can change people's uh uh perspective on race or on gender uh through play and motivation
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:57.720]  and changing behavior so through the difference engine initiative we seek to plant the seeds of
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:03.000]  change yeah i have an agenda sorry but it worked um and i don't know how it worked
[02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:11.000]  so that clip basically it's a bunch of different people involved in this this video games industry
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:17.080]  they're they're working together that's what i have to emphasize here this is a program that's
[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:24.600]  coordinated to re-engineer the population through video games theodore just explain who was talking
[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:36.360]  in that clip and what they were talking about um there's a few of them uh we booted up i got a
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:42.920]  document but what are this what are the social reeducation agendas that they're pushing in that
[02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:50.520]  clip what the agenda is they're specifically pushing for edtech they want to get more money into
[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:56.520]  that's for games as training aids as learning aids as opposed to entertainment there's more
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:36:01.400]  money to be had in that and it's far more malleable for message-based gaming which will serve their
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:09.400]  ideology better so that and this is a coordinated agenda right this isn't just a a matter of
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:14.680]  consensus where they each hold these individual beliefs they're actually working together we
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:20.600]  had the release the gaming journal's list that was released where behind the scenes they were
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:26.360]  conspiring to do this correct yeah there was a specific instance in how they were covering the
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:31.880]  zoe quinn issue otherwise known as a conspiracy or burgers and fries it was the incident before
[02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:38.120]  right that hit before gamergate and they were talking about giving zoe quinn gifts of all things
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:46.360]  it was so this is an agenda that's again very orchestrated morgan in virginia you're on the
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:51.960]  air morgan go ahead hey there how's it going guys good now good go ahead with the question
[02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:59.080]  well i would like to ask you guys what do you guys think is the direction that they're trying to
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:03.720]  take us with these video games that they're releasing now in the mainstream because i've been kind
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:08.920]  of out of the loop i'm a huge gamer myself i mean i've been playing games for years but i've been
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:12.520]  kind of disillusioned with most of the games that have been coming out because i like to do you
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:16.840]  know player versus player interaction and everything and they're kind of shying away from
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:20.840]  sort of like the olympic like sporting event kind of thing and they're like you guys are saying
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:27.000]  they're kind of working on this weird reeducation stuff and so i'm wondering what's the what's the
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:31.400]  direction they're taking because like you know i i i like to read and everything as well like
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:36.600]  enders game kind of is something that i'm sort of relating this to in a way because where's that
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:41.640]  point where's that end game where they're going to like say to us hey you know you guys have been
[02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:47.400]  under all this you know programming and everything for all these years oops sorry
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:52.360]  you know we didn't tell you that well where where where does that point come out what's the
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:57.640]  direction they're leading us what are they trying to make us do you know instead of killing aliens
[02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:03.160]  out in space you know sorry spoilers you know what what are we actually fighting what are we doing
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:08.520]  with all this video gaming exactly this is what i wanted to get to and see it or i'll get your
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:14.200]  comments on this what exactly are they pushing we had a caller before the break who was talking about
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:20.440]  call of duty and of course they're pushing you know russia as the main geopolitical enemy in
[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:27.720]  those kind of war games obviously that would be expected not particularly from a a reeducation
[02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:33.640]  viewpoint because you know the current narrative is the us versus russia you know in the geopolitical
[02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:39.640]  landscape but we're talking about how they're pushing radical feminism again we see it at the
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:47.240]  gender studies level where they're trying to drive a wedge between men and women by pushing supremacy
[02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:53.800]  radical feminism is not about equality it's not about egalitarianism it's about female
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:59.880]  supremacy and it's about driving home their political agenda riding on the coattails of
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:06.840]  feminism which in its first instance in its first incarnation was legitimate was necessary was justified
[02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:14.120]  but now they're doing it to push this kind of authoritarianism which suppresses and senses
[02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:19.480]  free speech and that's why governments are getting involved that's why universities are
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:24.040]  getting involved because they've been signed over to this program that's why the united nations is
[02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:30.120]  getting involved because this is about restricting freedom of speech and collating power into the
[02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:36.360]  hands of government into fewer and fewer hands which is why radical feminism is attractive
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:41.720]  to the state and to modern power structures because it's no longer about instilling power
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:47.640]  within the individual it's about instilling power within state bodies so how are they
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:54.120]  pushing that in these video games theodore go ahead they're pushing it by promoting their
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:40:02.520]  particular ideology specifically intersectionality that that belief is oh i'm sorry that belief is
[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:06.360]  said there's bias and everything which is why you might end up hearing a new circadian talking
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:11.960]  about how there's sexism and racism everywhere because that in her mind there is sexism racism
[02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:17.720]  everywhere anyways the particular methods which they're going by is a process called
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:28.280]  captology um it is games are persuade and persuasive tech it was started by a man known as bj fog
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:35.000]  he uh or a coin by him it's what started in board games in the past but over time it got adapted
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:41.480]  for video games and he's trying been trying to steadily push papers to encourage more game makers
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:49.480]  to uh to follow his particular demands and this is about using the tools of technology using
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:57.080]  computers using video games to push persuasive ideology so it's not about you know acquiescing
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:41:02.520]  to consumer demand it's not about keeping people entertained which they pay good money for it's
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:08.680]  about using these technologies to try and push their political agenda which again goes back to
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:15.480]  these this idea of radical feminism censoring suppressing free speech that's what it's all about
[02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:20.280]  that's what gaming is all about we're going to go to some more callers in a moment but theodore
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:24.600]  just give us a plug for your youtube channel and how people can find out more information
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:31.320]  if you want to see the series you can see it at youtube.com slash thydren brisbane
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:36.120]  th i dr an bris b a n e
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:44.440]  okay theodore thanks for joining us we've got alex jones on the line now with breaking news
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:50.280]  do we have alex ready or do we need to go to the call all right we'll go to tim in wyoming on
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:55.880]  zuckerberg censorship tim go ahead hello we have tim
[02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:06.040]  hello yes tim you're on the air go ahead yeah thanks for taking my call i wanted to mention i
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:11.720]  don't know if you have mentioned it or not but uh march zuckerberg talking to angela merkel and he
[02:42:11.720 --> 02:42:17.720]  said basically that he was working well essentially i mean he didn't say those words exactly but he
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:23.960]  said he was working on trying to keep people from saying certain things on facebook now when the when
[02:42:23.960 --> 02:42:28.680]  the companies are self-censoring and then in partnership with the government and the government
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:34.760]  says oh you can go above and beyond why not and people talk about conspiracies they say conspiracy
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:40.520]  theory well this is obviously conspiracy this is a conspiracy reality this is not it is exactly
[02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:45.000]  we've got breaking news now so we'll say goodbye to the caller we covered that actually michael
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:49.560]  thalen wrote an article about it and germans are also under threat of having their children
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:56.120]  snatched for anti migrant facebook posts while mark zuckerberg schemes with angela merkel
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:43:03.080]  to censor anti migrant facebook posts so again the argument that this internet censorship agenda
[02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:08.840]  is not a threat is not an issue completely debunked by the fact that major companies like facebook
[02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:15.000]  are scheming with heads of government to censor people and in germany they're now talking about
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:21.880]  even snatching people's children for anti migrant posts but we've got alex jones now on the air with
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:28.920]  breaking news alex go ahead absolutely i'm out here in the middle of nowhere uh in west texas
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:33.880]  dove hunting with by shun trying to keep the second minute alive i know it's not about
[02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:39.560]  hunting but hunting is what funds the pro gun lobby and movement so make no mistake i used to
[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:44.040]  always say uh second movement's not about hunting but that's actually wrong the second amendment
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:48.360]  is first and foremost about the fence republic defending your family fighting off tyranny
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:55.000]  but what funds the whole culture is having fun with firearms so to tell zuckerberg and
[02:43:55.560 --> 02:43:59.160]  merkel and all of them that they can go to hell i want folks to know we're getting a lot of dove
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:05.640]  out here we're about to roast on the grill it is my american duty it is my religious duty

[02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:29.240]  why i'm openly apologizing here on air but here is to uh the million mom march propaganda funded
[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:35.320]  by bloomberg coming into austin texas tomorrow the very same husband and wife crew that got my face
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:41.400]  the man again to get physical with me and his wife uh kit dangles has a story about it joe biggs
[02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:47.240]  is going to be uh there with the counter rally because i talked to biggs again kit last not about

[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:29.960]  when we had 1500 folks down there for the open carry defying the illegal law san antonio had
[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:35.160]  at the alamo a few years ago but at that amazing event these very same people crawled out from under

[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:11.000]  saying nobody's going to tell me what to say so these nasty women who say they're speaking for
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:17.080]  everyone i don't see anybody outside of king stupor's alarm aren't taking polls asking women's
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:25.320]  opinion you know the missing votes in california for the vaccination i wish info was would put
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:33.560]  a link it's only you know 11 o'clock in california if every student got a bulletin over the loud
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:41.560]  speaker have your parents go on info today and sign that link we would make up the more than 360
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:46.920]  thousand signatures and alex keeps saying it's a playbook i know what they're doing because it's a
[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:54.440]  playbook it's like a chess game it's a move where the pawns the bishops are making their moves they
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:59.480]  think i know what's going on but only the king and queen know what's going on where the pawns
[02:48:59.480 --> 02:49:05.800]  it's a chess game we're getting and we've seen we've seen a rise in prominence of black conservative
[02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:11.000]  voices and a backlash against them what do you think about the 14-year-old i don't know if you
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:16.600]  saw this who basically came out with some youtube videos criticizing obama the white house publicly
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:24.200]  shamed him for doing so do you know that story seeing bits and pieces of it and i think as long
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:30.520]  as we continue to feed into the mainstream media like my parents they think i'm crazy mom says if
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:35.880]  it doesn't show up on ap she's not going to believe it well you know the internet is a wonderful thing
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:44.600]  you can google california and see the missing lake now you need to know why it's all a chess game so
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:51.320]  if we ignore them we're getting boner out we need to get mcconnell out we need to set examples for
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:57.640]  congress and senate that look if we'll go after boner we'll go after you you need to vote for the
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:04.280]  people ron paul needs to take off the little panties and put on big boy camp and he needs to fight

[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:35.640]  alex has so many listeners ashua is not the name of jesus christ people need to look at the bible
[02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:41.320]  they say that a million christians or more will not go in the end it's because they're calling
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:50.600]  for a false god they need to call for jesus christ or the messiah not ashua ashua is no

[02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:41.000]  these final calls waltz in Missouri that you're on the air go ahead hello paul uh until it's recognized
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:49.880]  by our country as the jesuit pope once jesuit pope is now calling for a new world order the
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:56.680]  jesuit's been after world government since 1540 for the vatican they've been behind all the wars
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:55:03.800]  in europe and all the wars we've had to fight in our country for freedom until the jesuits are
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:12.040]  identified as as that force it'll continue yeah and i made a video about how the pope has basically
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:19.160]  betrayed christianity betrayed catholics completely sold out the religion he's now embracing the mass
[02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:27.400]  muslim invasion of migrants while muslim imams openly call for muslims to out breed west and
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:34.680]  europeans so they can impose sharia law so the pope's a complete sell out we've been banging on that
[02:55:34.680 --> 02:55:40.120]  for the past two weeks and that's a good video that you can check out on that issue frank in
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:46.440]  massachusetts you're on the air go ahead paul great show i was going to add that uh hot on the heels
[02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:52.360]  of jeremy corbin of the uk labor party preaching about how marxism is now back in style and all
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:58.360]  this pushing for bernie sanders a company called ubi soft was uh promoting one of their games coming
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:05.480]  soon and they were bragging about how they're integrating carl marx into the cast along with a
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:13.960]  transsexual character really well why would you why would you be opposed to that surely that's
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:20.440]  trendy and progressive right so yeah definitely and uh this is also the same company that had to
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:24.840]  rework one of their games that jacari jackson might have talked about colorado six where they
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:30.760]  had a tea party-esque type of uh a group of terrorists going against the government
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:38.920]  now we've catalogued it for a while and again this is key because video games are the biggest
[02:56:38.920 --> 02:56:45.400]  grossing entertainment industry above hollywood that's now official so we have to pay attention
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:50.840]  to gamergate people need to learn about it it seems quite technical and obtuse from the outset
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:55.960]  but people really need to learn about it because this is a fundamental threat to free speech because
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:57:01.080]  now they're going beyond video games taking their case to the un and saying the internet
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:07.800]  should be censored because of quote cyber violence which under their definition is saying you suck
[02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:14.040]  no that's not cyber violence that's called the first frigging amendment and it needs to remain
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:20.680]  the internet needs to remain as the wild west the final beacon of freedom as it truly is alex in
[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:31.080]  wisconsin you're on the air go ahead alex hi do you hear me hey go ahead um is figure still on the

[02:57:38.520 --> 02:57:49.000]  the honey badger brigade up in uh canada i think that's uh is that loren southern and karen strauhen
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:58.920]  uh yeah it's comprised of mainly female women who are avid anti-feminist and they give talks on
[02:57:58.920 --> 02:58:07.880]  men's rights and the other night a good friend of karen was actually um on tumblr feminist
[02:58:07.880 --> 02:58:18.280]  in canada called to boycott the entire speech because they were handing out pamphlets about
[02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:25.640]  fake one in four statistics that are thrown around campuses and it ended up that they didn't know it
[02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:32.280]  was going to happen until the night before so everyone it's amazing we've had these um
[02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:37.320]  flyers that you know calling someone a slut calling a woman a slut is akin to sexual violence

[03:03:13.240 --> 03:03:18.440]  was to go down i was to jump right in so i've been kind of standing by reading stories getting ready
[03:03:18.440 --> 03:03:23.880]  for this fourth hour of overdrive i'm going to play a few videos too including one that was submitted
[03:03:24.520 --> 03:03:29.640]  not even submitted for to play on our our show somebody sent it to me via twitter and i said
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:33.800]  we need to put that up on info wars because especially with flu season coming so we're
[03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:39.160]  going to get into that in the next segment i'm also going to talk about this it's an article
[03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:43.400]  that came out on the daily mail a couple days ago talking about how the fbi is going to start
[03:03:43.400 --> 03:03:49.240]  making public information about police shootings of civilians and while that on its surface seems
[03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:54.040]  like a really good idea the guy behind it i don't like and i don't trust him at all and that's
[03:03:54.040 --> 03:03:58.600]  eric holder why is he behind it well i'm going to get into that why he's behind all that and why
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:03.720]  it's not i mean well it's a good thing we see those statistics but the reason they're posting them is
[03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:09.160]  not for open transparent government it's for more government more government control and
[03:04:09.160 --> 03:04:17.080]  to federalize the police so we're going to get into all that um let's see here's an article
[03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:21.720]  that we've posted somebody sent me an email i watched some of the videos and said let's post
[03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:25.160]  this so i'll get into that right now while we have this last few minutes here or those last
[03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:30.840]  minute scientists discover health breakthroughs from russian space program all right and we're
[03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:35.960]  going to get more into that about the russian space program and what it could tell us about our
[03:04:35.960 --> 03:04:40.680]  health because russians were sending astronauts into space and they were coming back very healthy
[03:04:40.680 --> 03:04:45.800]  our astronauts are coming back on stretchers and there is a reason why it's because they were
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:49.880]  really concerned about the health of their astronauts so we'll get into all that and more
[03:04:49.880 --> 03:05:00.600]  it's the fourth hour overdrive of the alex joneshow i'm your host rob do stay tuned a georgia high
[03:05:00.600 --> 03:05:07.240]  school went into lockdown the other day after a student showed up with a confederate flag the
[03:05:07.240 --> 03:05:13.480]  incident started when a tenth grade boy arrived at rock mart high school with the rebel flag
[03:05:13.480 --> 03:05:20.440]  attached to his backpack he was then confronted by two black students who were upset by the flag
[03:05:20.440 --> 03:05:29.720]  and a fight broke out the scuffle was quickly broken up by teachers and staff all three students
[03:05:29.720 --> 03:05:35.640]  were searched and no weapons were found but then rumors began to circulate that more students
[03:05:35.640 --> 03:05:42.680]  would be bringing confederate flags to school and a campus lockdown was ordered no word as to
[03:05:42.680 --> 03:05:48.760]  whether or not the black students are equally upset with president brock obama who also displayed
[03:05:48.760 --> 03:05:57.880]  the confederate flag on his own campaign pin in 2012 and you can learn more at info wars dot com

[03:08:53.400 --> 03:08:57.480]  i've actually been taking the last couple days the first one is knockout i take that because
[03:08:57.480 --> 03:09:03.400]  i like to stay awake till 2 30 sometimes 3 a.m in the morning and i don't wake up a really nice guy
[03:09:03.400 --> 03:09:07.960]  knockout guys not brain force we'll go to that one in one second because in order to get to sleep
[03:09:08.440 --> 03:09:14.120]  i i take the knockout around midnight i think i'm going to start taking around 11 because it works
[03:09:14.120 --> 03:09:19.000]  and it works so well i don't i feel so good in the morning i don't even want to get out of bed i
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:23.880]  want to take an extra half hour of sleep but it lets me sleep the entire night i don't wake up in
[03:09:23.880 --> 03:09:30.440]  the middle of the night um noises don't wake me up my wife getting up out of bed to go to the bathroom
[03:09:30.440 --> 03:09:35.080]  doesn't wake me up because she's a pregnant female which i guess i'm sexist for saying
[03:09:35.080 --> 03:09:41.560]  that a pregnant woman uh but in the morning even before i take coffee i take brain force
[03:09:41.560 --> 03:09:46.120]  and brain force i didn't believe it anthony had been taking it and he said you got to take
[03:09:46.120 --> 03:09:51.160]  you got to take it i said all right fine yesterday i i took it for the first time
[03:09:52.200 --> 03:09:57.560]  unbelievable the results that i had i mean immediately my brain went from kind of foggy
[03:09:57.560 --> 03:10:03.080]  groggy to boom i'm awake i'm up i'm looking around i'm feeling good took it again this morning
[03:10:03.080 --> 03:10:08.600]  same exact results but not a jittery type of uh amp feeling you get like if you have too much
[03:10:08.600 --> 03:10:14.680]  coffee or too much urbamate or something brain force let me tell you that's a one two punch
[03:10:14.680 --> 03:10:21.320]  to regulate your time schedule because time is something we don't have a lot of it is a finite
[03:10:21.320 --> 03:10:27.160]  resource so we have to make the most of our time and that is one way to do that to keep your brain
[03:10:27.160 --> 03:10:33.640]  in focus when you need it to and to help get the sleep to rest and recover that is equally as
[03:10:33.640 --> 03:10:40.040]  important so i encourage you to try brain force and knock out today at info wars life dot com or
[03:10:40.040 --> 03:10:44.840]  info wars store dot com you can check it out you can read all the reviews i encourage you to do that
[03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:50.600]  now the international academy for regulatory medicine and consciousness research contacted me
[03:10:50.600 --> 03:10:54.600]  via email and said hey are you interested in playing some videos that have some revolutionary
[03:10:54.600 --> 03:10:59.400]  health information i said well i'm very interested in revolutionary health information send them over
[03:10:59.400 --> 03:11:05.240]  well they sent them over and they were all in german and uh but they had subtitles thank goodness
[03:11:05.240 --> 03:11:09.560]  so usually i like to listen to videos while i'm doing other things because i have limited time
[03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:13.960]  but these actually sat down there's three videos that they sent me i watched uh i've gone through
[03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:21.720]  part one and part of part two and if you guys can bring up that article it is titled see here
[03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:28.280]  scientists discover health breakthroughs from the russian space program and let me tell you the russians
[03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:33.240]  when they would send people up in space the astronauts would come down or cosmonauts would
[03:11:33.240 --> 03:11:39.320]  come down they would be able to do hand stands and our astronauts were in stretchers they had to
[03:11:39.320 --> 03:11:44.200]  carry them out of the capsules and there is a difference because the russians were looking
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:48.280]  at the physiology and doing things different for their astronauts providing them vitamins
[03:11:48.280 --> 03:11:53.480]  enzymes and stuff to keep their bodies going they were putting magnetic fields in their capsules i
[03:11:53.480 --> 03:12:01.160]  think before the us was to regulate that pressure on the inside so the two individuals there uh one
[03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:06.760]  of them is a doctor eddinger uh they talk about all the different health breakthroughs they've
[03:12:06.760 --> 03:12:11.000]  been doing by studying the the scientists that worked on the russian space program and the
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:16.440]  things they came up with and now they're applying those today in germany so it's a really intro if
[03:12:16.440 --> 03:12:21.160]  you're into health news i encourage you to check out those three videos i think they're amazing
[03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:25.560]  i've given them to send them to a few people here in the office and they've all just been
[03:12:25.560 --> 03:12:29.720]  blown away by the information a lot of it's validating stuff that that i've thought personally
[03:12:30.520 --> 03:12:33.960]  and it's just amazing to see other people thinking the same thing and that we're all
[03:12:34.520 --> 03:12:39.720]  on this journey together on earth and we're definitely not getting what we should be getting
[03:12:39.720 --> 03:12:44.120]  from mainstream media and big pharma you know big pharma was to make you a lifelong customer
[03:12:44.120 --> 03:12:49.240]  i'm into empowering people to you know not spend you know you don't want to spend all your money
[03:12:49.240 --> 03:12:56.520]  on health care and stuff like that now i do want to take some calls and that's 800-259-9231
[03:12:56.520 --> 03:13:02.680]  specifically on this there seems to be some controversy going on with the group uh trying to
[03:13:02.680 --> 03:13:08.440]  repeal sp277 here's the first article group submit signatures to repeal california vaccine law
[03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:15.320]  and this is the uh they wanted to repeal sp277 a group they needed 366 000 signatures
[03:13:16.040 --> 03:13:22.040]  that's a lot of signatures uh and so they that was uh the deadline was monday to turn it in now
[03:13:22.680 --> 03:13:28.440]  tim donnelly i think we've put a couple articles up of his on there on uh on info wars before but
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:34.920]  uh september 29 th tuesday donnelly said that there's been uh the group has faced strong opposition
[03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:40.440]  from the pharmaceutical lobby and the referendum was sabotaged from without and within by powerful
[03:13:40.440 --> 03:13:44.360]  forces from its very inception never before in my political experience if i witnessed such
[03:13:44.360 --> 03:13:49.880]  extensive and determine opposition to a campaign donnelly said in a statement i've got some tweets
[03:13:49.880 --> 03:13:53.960]  about this that people are sending me we need to look into this so if you have any information
[03:13:53.960 --> 03:14:00.840]  specifically about the signatures and what went wrong with sp277 to get that repealed
[03:14:00.840 --> 03:14:06.600]  please give me a call at 800 259 9231 at at the conclusion of this segment and the we had that
[03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:14.680]  short five minute segment i would like to get you on to talk about it now onto this next article
[03:14:14.680 --> 03:14:20.200]  top five videos you want to watch before you get your flu shot we are in the midst of flu season
[03:14:20.200 --> 03:14:25.240]  and they are going to be peppering you left and right the banners have gone up at every cvs every
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:30.440]  wall greens in the country to get your flu shot you go into randall's grocery store here locally
[03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:34.840]  they want to give you 10% off your grocery bill if you just get jabbed with a little aluminum a
[03:14:34.840 --> 03:14:40.120]  little mercury make you feel better the top video on here is not one of ours though the other four
[03:14:40.120 --> 03:14:44.520]  are info wars produced videos but the top one here is report the flu shot in pregnant women
[03:14:44.520 --> 03:14:50.040]  by an individual is a writer and researcher named jeffrey jackson and he has taken our
[03:14:50.040 --> 03:14:54.760]  information put put it in his own video and that's something that we encourage people to do we
[03:14:54.760 --> 03:14:58.680]  encourage you to grab it from the different networks out there we have prison planet dot tv
[03:14:58.680 --> 03:15:03.480]  where if you remember you can download the videos if you're on our youtube channel you can download
[03:15:03.480 --> 03:15:07.960]  the videos there and use them in your own reports because we may put out a 40 minute video and you
[03:15:07.960 --> 03:15:11.560]  may want to put out a five minute video on a certain subject that we touch on in a video
[03:15:11.560 --> 03:15:15.960]  and we encourage you to do that well that's what mr jackson did so i got with the writers today i said
[03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:20.680]  let's do a flu shot video montage article and let's put his video on the top see if we can
[03:15:20.680 --> 03:15:26.120]  get him some views because it's very important that we all stand together on these core issues
[03:15:26.120 --> 03:15:30.280]  especially of health freedom so i want to play his report now i don't know if i'm going to play the
[03:15:30.280 --> 03:15:34.920]  whole thing i might cut out in parts of but you'll see where he actually grabs some of uh some of
[03:15:34.920 --> 03:15:42.440]  content that we produced here at info wars so roll that video in 2006 the cdc's position regarding
[03:15:42.440 --> 03:15:47.160]  vaccinating pregnant mothers changed traditionally thought to be an unnecessary risk to the unborn
[03:15:47.160 --> 03:15:52.440]  child the vaccinating of pregnant mothers opened the floodgates for new avenues of profit the willful
[03:15:52.440 --> 03:15:57.480]  ignorance of a mainstream medical community forced rapid learning curves for parents attempting to
[03:15:57.480 --> 03:16:02.040]  protect their children doctors and scientists have been left shaking their heads in disbelief at the
[03:16:02.040 --> 03:16:07.080]  recklessness of this policy by the centers for disease control and prevention during pregnancy
[03:16:07.080 --> 03:16:14.600]  they're wanting women to get a flu shot the flu shot then will be the priming shot it primes the
[03:16:14.600 --> 03:16:23.480]  baby's microglue then at birth get a hepatitis b shot over reaction then at two months what happens
[03:16:23.480 --> 03:16:31.080]  to the poor baby well you go to pediatrician said well time for uh six shots now that child's getting
[03:16:31.080 --> 03:16:39.000]  six times as high dose of just the adjuvant some of these vaccines have three different antigens in
[03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:47.960]  them so now we're talking about dozens of immune stimulations all in one city somewhere in the fog
[03:16:47.960 --> 03:16:53.320]  injecting doctors and nurses following their superiors orders lost the moral high ground ethics
[03:16:53.320 --> 03:16:58.760]  informed consent and humanity was lost in the rapid unconscious push to blindly keep up with
[03:16:58.760 --> 03:17:04.360]  ever-increasing vaccine schedules written by compromise regulatory agencies directed by drug
[03:17:04.360 --> 03:17:11.240]  company profit and you and i've sat in a in a room with all of our on-call staff physicians and

[03:17:22.120 --> 03:17:28.440]  month vaccinations and he got intubated last night haha embarrassing like it's funny i mean the step

[03:18:09.480 --> 03:18:16.280]  i referenced him and he said that 70 percent of news division revenues during non-election years
[03:18:16.280 --> 03:18:21.560]  are coming from the pharmaceutical companies so you have the press that has been compromised
[03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:28.520]  you they're the biggest advertisers now they get about a 3.4 to 5 billion a year that to press
[03:18:28.520 --> 03:18:34.200]  advertising the fact that you're injecting doctor or nurse does not speak about or even show you the
[03:18:34.200 --> 03:18:40.040]  actual vaccine insert is a violation of the ethics and laws governing there you go there and there's
[03:18:40.040 --> 03:18:44.440]  the vaccine insert right there and i encourage you to read the actual insert it says it hasn't been
[03:18:44.440 --> 03:18:48.760]  tested right there has not been established for pregnant women or nursing mothers right there
[03:18:48.760 --> 03:18:54.120]  in writing yet they sit there and market it towards pregnant women that is their untapped
[03:18:54.120 --> 03:18:58.120]  market right now is pregnant women and you notice it's not even 10 years old that they've been saying
[03:18:58.120 --> 03:19:02.680]  pregnant women should be getting their flu shot it's despicable and people write about it do you

[03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:26.280]  interestingly enough both callers once from new york and once from new jersey so i'd like to see
[03:24:26.280 --> 03:24:31.000]  some callers from california call in you got a couple minutes here i'm gonna take calls in this
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:37.640]  segment um but as i was playing the video before about how they want to push the flu vaccine on
[03:24:37.640 --> 03:24:43.640]  pregnant women i made a faux palm sorry trannies now want me to say birthing individual instead
[03:24:43.640 --> 03:24:50.280]  of pregnant woman oh so that's from kit daniels transsexuals i want you to use the phrase birthing
[03:24:50.280 --> 03:24:54.280]  individuals instead of pregnant woman because according to them the latter promotes trans hatred
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:25:02.040]  i did not know that i have no hatred towards anybody um lgbt activists have convinced the
[03:25:02.040 --> 03:25:05.720]  midwives alliance of north america to stop referring to their clients as women and mothers
[03:25:05.720 --> 03:25:11.000]  instead call them pregnant people and birthing individuals so transsexuals won't get offended
[03:25:12.600 --> 03:25:18.440]  well pregnant women pregnant women pregnant women hope that didn't offend you here's another quick
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:26.840]  tip when you send us video don't hold your phone like this turn your phone this way and then shoot
[03:25:26.840 --> 03:25:33.640]  the video if you turn it this way you're going to send me a little video in a big screen i've had a
[03:25:33.640 --> 03:25:37.480]  couple people doing they send me videos and what do you think this video and i say first thing just
[03:25:37.480 --> 03:25:43.560]  turn your camera this way and i'm serious it makes a big difference check it out for yourself do your
[03:25:43.560 --> 03:25:48.840]  own research to that online and while i was looking at that uh jeffrey jackson the guy who
[03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:53.720]  we played his video earlier sent me an article cdc spends one million to increase adult flu
[03:25:53.720 --> 03:25:59.640]  vaccination rates flu shot to be mandatory you guys can get that there on my phone there it is
[03:25:59.640 --> 03:26:03.560]  so they're spending a lot of money to make sure you take that flu shot because they're really
[03:26:03.560 --> 03:26:09.560]  concerned about your health right that's why they spend and that's why they want to make it mandatory
[03:26:09.560 --> 03:26:13.800]  because they want to make sure you're healthy they really care about you so much has nothing to do
[03:26:13.800 --> 03:26:20.680]  with the money they make no that's all so alex in new york you're on the line what do you have to
[03:26:20.680 --> 03:26:29.560]  say about sb 277 uh hi rob i'm actually from california i just uh i'm in new york right now
[03:26:29.560 --> 03:26:38.760]  but um i wanted to say how we avoided vaccinating my sister uh to go to school and how we plan to do
[03:26:38.760 --> 03:26:43.960]  it in the future too and all my cousins and relatives they're doing the same thing um i
[03:26:43.960 --> 03:26:50.600]  realized by saying this that's gonna kind of put up i i'm probably the system knows this but anyways
[03:26:50.600 --> 03:26:56.920]  we basically got the doctor our family doctors to just say that he vaccinated he signed from the
[03:26:56.920 --> 03:27:06.280]  form and uh it's basically we we lied wow you committed a crime against the vaccine community
[03:27:06.280 --> 03:27:12.600]  i think they're committing the crime so we gotta fight them exactly we gotta protect ourselves
[03:27:12.600 --> 03:27:19.240]  you're right go ahead but as far as the signature it's um me and my uh family members we went out
[03:27:19.240 --> 03:27:27.480]  to sign them and as far as from what i understood was very hard was they had specific location
[03:27:27.480 --> 03:27:35.080]  to go and sign and so it made it very difficult like you had to go get out of your way to go and
[03:27:35.080 --> 03:27:42.360]  sign the the petition and you have to like look for places and it was very like bizarre i usually
[03:27:42.360 --> 03:27:47.960]  it's very easy to sign the petition in california but this time it was like you had to go way out
[03:27:47.960 --> 03:27:53.960]  of your way into some part of LA or whatever yeah mark mark dice could have probably got all 366
[03:27:53.960 --> 03:27:58.200]  thousand signatures if it was something like ban the bill of rights or ban the bible it had plenty
[03:27:58.200 --> 03:28:04.840]  people signing but yeah i'm interested to see what went on with SB 277 because i thought that would
[03:28:04.840 --> 03:28:12.200]  be a slam dunk there was enough protest and outcry from a lot of different uh areas in in california
[03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:16.760]  a lot of different groups of people were coming out against it not just not just mothers or not
[03:28:16.760 --> 03:28:24.040]  just people who are constitutionalist or libertarians uh the i think the black not not the black
[03:28:24.040 --> 03:28:29.000]  nationalist but the um the group that ferricans with they were even speaking out against it and
[03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:34.040]  they had all kinds of people with them that were getting together and wanting to say no to force
[03:28:34.040 --> 03:28:38.920]  vaccination because it's forcing that issue upon us nation of islam nation of islam that's what is
[03:28:38.920 --> 03:28:46.840]  thanks thanks cj uh mary in new jersey uh go ahead what is uh what do you have to say hi i've been
[03:28:46.840 --> 03:28:54.760]  a nurse all my life working in ic news and education and most doctors like ben karson is there who's
[03:28:54.760 --> 03:29:03.800]  running her office the surgeon they're not aware of the controversy they're not aware um they just
[03:29:03.800 --> 03:29:13.160]  put whatever is in the tbr usually um most do not become aware of this stuff so um basically that's
[03:29:13.160 --> 03:29:18.600]  what i wanted to say yeah i had to actually go in because my wife was kind of on the fence about
[03:29:18.600 --> 03:29:24.680]  vaccination many years ago and i had to actually debate my doctor so i went with an army of documents
[03:29:24.680 --> 03:29:29.960]  and at the end she threw up her arms and said you sure did your research and uh said i'm still going
[03:29:29.960 --> 03:29:34.920]  to support vaccination but i respect your decision and you're definitely informed so inform yourself
[03:29:34.920 --> 03:29:40.120]  people it's your job it's not the doctor's job it's not big pharma's job it's your job we'll be right

[03:33:18.120 --> 03:33:25.080]  no no no my nose that wasn't no it's not what set you off that time i know all
[03:33:25.080 --> 03:33:35.800]  here to know about the crying game making sure uh that these kids have a shot at the american
[03:33:35.800 --> 03:33:59.640]  rent my car it's important i put my myself through school working every rotten job there was i
[03:33:59.640 --> 03:34:09.720]  wanted to make sure every kid at the same chance like the alex jones show because there is a war
[03:34:09.720 --> 03:34:17.480]  on for your mind oh my gosh you should start crying put it back on screen kids and i certainly
[03:34:17.480 --> 03:34:25.080]  don't want the institution to go through this so he's got the tissue out that's right where his
[03:34:25.080 --> 03:34:29.720]  bone are going to go from here now that he's reached the pinnacle of hog troughery he has been
[03:34:29.720 --> 03:34:35.080]  feeding off the public trough for many years now he gets his cushy retirement and cushy pay for the
[03:34:35.080 --> 03:34:39.400]  rest of his life and his free health care he really gets free health care paid for by you and me
[03:34:40.200 --> 03:34:45.240]  i don't know why he's crying maybe it's some skeletons in the closet maybe we'll never know
[03:34:45.240 --> 03:34:49.880]  took a while for pastured skeletons he was the longest reigning republican speaker for his
[03:34:49.880 --> 03:34:53.960]  skeletons they're starting to come out seems like he was a wrestling coach that like to bring
[03:34:53.960 --> 03:35:02.040]  little boys on trips and people are speaking out now want to jump over to trump's tax plan
[03:35:02.040 --> 03:35:08.440]  fact checks from yahoo math and trups tax plan doesn't always add up and they're going on and on
[03:35:08.440 --> 03:35:14.520]  about how the tax plan is going to take away too much from uh from the trough eaters the the tax
[03:35:14.520 --> 03:35:19.720]  cuts will be nearly 12 trillion over the next decade oh we can't have that what would the tax
[03:35:19.720 --> 03:35:24.520]  trough people do well what would the trough eaters do how would they how would they regurgitate all
[03:35:24.520 --> 03:35:30.600]  this look at that play 12 trillion in the deficit he wants to get rid of the inheritance tax
[03:35:31.320 --> 03:35:36.440]  he wants to get rid of the different rates he wants to cut i think there are seven levels of
[03:35:36.440 --> 03:35:42.280]  taxes he wants to cut them down to four but what i like about what trump did say about his tax plan
[03:35:42.280 --> 03:35:46.280]  is that he wants to go after a way citing the example of hammers that cost 800 that you can buy
[03:35:46.280 --> 03:35:50.680]  in a store for a tiny amount of money a musty reference that dates to the 80s pentagon scandal
[03:35:50.680 --> 03:35:54.680]  he also put fun at the government funded soccer field that cost a million to make up the deficit
[03:35:54.680 --> 03:35:58.200]  trump would need to eliminate improper or insufficiently documented pain is made by the
[03:35:58.200 --> 03:36:06.360]  federal government estimated by the gao office to be 124 billion in 2014 so the government
[03:36:06.360 --> 03:36:13.960]  wastes at just in one year alone 124 billion now yahoo didn't really like his tax plan because
[03:36:13.960 --> 03:36:17.720]  i guess the people that work for yahoo think that we should be taxed to the hilt so we can have
[03:36:17.720 --> 03:36:22.920]  free stuff like our we had a guest here earlier said he liked free health care and i like high
[03:36:22.920 --> 03:36:28.280]  taxes and you're paying for the free health care buddy you just don't get it uh donald trump's
[03:36:28.280 --> 03:36:34.360]  amazingly conventional tax plan the top marginal income rate would drop to 25 percent from nearly
[03:36:34.360 --> 03:36:40.360]  40 millon come earners would pay 10 to 20 percent anyone earning less than 25 000 a year 50 000
[03:36:40.360 --> 03:36:45.080]  married couples would pay no tax at all trump would scratch the marriage penalty estate tax
[03:36:45.080 --> 03:36:48.920]  and the alternative minimum tax and businesses would pay no more than 15 percent of their
[03:36:48.920 --> 03:36:57.000]  income to the government why is that important well us companies are stashing 2.1 trillion
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:37:06.520]  overseas to avoid taxes now with my tax plan would be everybody pays 10 percent and that's
[03:37:06.520 --> 03:37:11.080]  for everything you don't have property tax you don't have all these little fees and taxes that
[03:37:11.080 --> 03:37:16.200]  sales tax nothing 10 percent and if the government can't live on that well then they've got to cut
[03:37:16.200 --> 03:37:21.880]  expenses and i think the first place to start is by cutting expenses on those exorbitant salaries
[03:37:21.880 --> 03:37:27.560]  that our senators and congressmen make they're public servants if they don't like it they can
[03:37:27.560 --> 03:37:31.560]  always leave there's plenty of other people that want to come in and get free health care
[03:37:31.560 --> 03:37:37.400]  and a free office up in washington dc let's start cutting where it hurts let's start cutting some
[03:37:37.400 --> 03:37:41.800]  of these salaries of some of these bureaucrats these lifetime bureaucrats that are making hundreds
[03:37:41.800 --> 03:37:48.440]  of thousands of dollars a year it's public service it should not be a place where you go camp out for
[03:37:48.440 --> 03:37:51.960]  the rest of your life these people need to go into the real world and see what it's like
[03:37:51.960 --> 03:37:57.960]  and get a real job 2.1 trillion if we were getting 10 percent of that that's 210 billion right there
[03:37:57.960 --> 03:38:04.760]  just on the overseas money that they're hiding then you got another 124 billion that the gao admitted
[03:38:04.760 --> 03:38:16.920]  is wasted so that's 300 and 34 billion dollars without even taxing anybody any american citizen
[03:38:16.920 --> 03:38:22.760]  right there just on those two savings alone you could start there and then you tax everybody
[03:38:22.760 --> 03:38:27.080]  else at 10 you get rid of the property tax you get rid of all these other taxes you get rid of
[03:38:27.080 --> 03:38:33.800]  all this bureaucratic state government local governments and you put the pedal to the metal
[03:38:33.800 --> 03:38:38.600]  and but we have to do that we have to step up and do that and if your people are paying less taxes
[03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:42.680]  guess what they're going to do they're going to spend more and then we're just going to stimulate
[03:38:42.680 --> 03:38:46.600]  the economy they're going to hire more if they're a business owner and they're going to pay those
[03:38:46.600 --> 03:38:52.600]  people more which is going to mean more taxes to the hog trough then that's what needs to happen
[03:38:52.600 --> 03:38:57.640]  if we could get it down to 10 percent for everybody we would have the greatest country
[03:38:57.640 --> 03:39:02.280]  the world has ever seen 10 times over and we would have money to do all the things we want
[03:39:02.280 --> 03:39:06.840]  to do we'd be able to pay for all the health care for all the people yeah some things are
[03:39:06.840 --> 03:39:11.240]  going to get cut and we need to take a look at it go what do we really need to fund what does
[03:39:11.240 --> 03:39:13.800]  the federal government what did the state government what does the local government
[03:39:13.800 --> 03:39:17.880]  really need to fund and then everything else we put in the private sector and we let the private
[03:39:17.880 --> 03:39:24.440]  sector decide what really needs to be funded and we'll see we'll see if giant sports stadiums
[03:39:24.440 --> 03:39:30.440]  for high school kids is the proper way to spend money or we'll see if a million dollar soccer
[03:39:30.440 --> 03:39:36.680]  fields for the federal government is the right way to spend money now i want to go to these two
[03:39:36.680 --> 03:39:42.440]  articles fbi to collect and make public more information about public shootings of civilians
[03:39:42.440 --> 03:39:49.880]  this is out of the daily mail fbi will begin collecting and providing to the public more
[03:39:49.880 --> 03:39:53.160]  information about police shootings of civilians director james kovie said while releasing nationwide
[03:39:53.160 --> 03:39:57.800]  crime data federal law enforcement officials have a knowledge in the last year lack of reliable
[03:39:57.800 --> 03:40:02.520]  data about how often police use force in the line of duty former attorney general eric holder
[03:40:02.520 --> 03:40:06.600]  urged for better record keeping and a speech this year calling it a matter of common sense
[03:40:06.600 --> 03:40:11.160]  i agree it's definitely a matter of common sense we need to know how this is used so we can look
[03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:18.360]  at our police objectively and decide how they're doing their job locally but why is the federal
[03:40:18.360 --> 03:40:23.880]  government pushing for this why is eric holder pushing for this well is that in usa today feds
[03:40:23.880 --> 03:40:29.480]  returning to local crime fight that's right the feds are concerned about the local crime
[03:40:30.200 --> 03:40:34.440]  mounting concern of a recent violent crime surges in us cities has prompted the us justice department
[03:40:34.440 --> 03:40:38.600]  to call a meeting next month of more than a dozen law enforcement officials to deal with
[03:40:38.600 --> 03:40:43.320]  persistent public safety threats ranging from chemical yeah criminal gangs to domestic violence
[03:40:44.280 --> 03:40:48.280]  earlier this year in the face of rising titions believe police and public communities across
[03:40:48.280 --> 03:40:55.240]  the nation which was kind of funded by the white house a special white house policing force task
[03:40:55.240 --> 03:41:00.040]  force issued a slate of recommendations aiming at restoring public confidence the justice department
[03:41:00.040 --> 03:41:04.200]  is open inquiries into the operations of more than 20 police departments across the country
[03:41:04.200 --> 03:41:09.560]  since 2009 including baltimore oh we saw how baltimore turned out and there were riots and now
[03:41:09.560 --> 03:41:13.560]  there's the murder rate skyrocketed because police don't want to do their job because they're afraid
[03:41:14.280 --> 03:41:20.920]  of being called out and investigated and it's a two-way street with police if they didn't spend
[03:41:20.920 --> 03:41:26.200]  their time harassing people for meaningless crimes and i'm not saying they're all doing that but and
[03:41:26.200 --> 03:41:30.520]  and racial profiling and stuff that does happen maybe they wouldn't have this community backlash
[03:41:30.520 --> 03:41:34.040]  and shooting people that are unarmed i i was looking at a video earlier of a guy who was
[03:41:34.600 --> 03:41:38.440]  leaning against the car like this and the cop just pulled out his tazer and tased the guy
[03:41:38.440 --> 03:41:47.800]  there's no reason to do that uh so uh on monday the federal government's identified five cities
[03:41:47.800 --> 03:41:52.360]  compton california little rock arkansas west memphis arkansas newark your jersey and flint
[03:41:52.360 --> 03:41:57.320]  michigan which are poised to get an infusion of federal help to battle violence even as most of
[03:41:57.320 --> 03:42:02.600]  the country has enjoyed relative calm all those cities are run by democratic mayors so i wonder
[03:42:02.600 --> 03:42:07.960]  why they need uh federal help maybe it's because they have draconian gun laws so people aren't
[03:42:07.960 --> 03:42:14.600]  armed so the criminals run rampant and they talk about in this article how chicago detroit
[03:42:14.600 --> 03:42:20.120]  camden new jersey oakland and wilmington delaware where all which i'm not sure about wilmington
[03:42:20.120 --> 03:42:25.400]  delaware but i bet it's a uh democratic mayor all have uh they've addressed similar problems
[03:42:25.400 --> 03:42:28.600]  the justice department had to go in there and look this is about the federal government wanting to
[03:42:28.600 --> 03:42:32.920]  come in and control the police that is why they want to release this data so they could say look
[03:42:32.920 --> 03:42:36.840]  police they're not doing their job we need to come in and help and what happens when they
[03:42:36.840 --> 03:42:42.120]  come in and help you get what you get in chicago which is lots of murders really high gun control
[03:42:42.120 --> 03:42:51.480]  and citizens and police that are afraid to do their job so there's that put that in your pipe
[03:42:51.480 --> 03:42:59.240]  and smoke it uh here's an article that we put up this morning survivors expose how sexual predators
[03:42:59.240 --> 03:43:04.200]  groom their victims and this is uh an interview that david knight jacari jackson did while they
[03:43:04.200 --> 03:43:09.400]  were following around the pope there were two ladies that were also following around the pope
[03:43:09.400 --> 03:43:14.040]  they were from snap it's an independent confidential network of survivors of institutional sexual
[03:43:14.040 --> 03:43:21.240]  abuse and i'm going to play a three minute trailer from that right now and when we come
[03:43:21.240 --> 03:43:25.800]  back if we have time i may get to another video or uh we'll see where we go from here
[03:43:25.800 --> 03:43:31.400]  we got john and michigan wants to talk about sv 40 so maybe we'll talk with him as well but let's
[03:43:31.400 --> 03:43:35.960]  go to that video this is a trailer of the longer video which you can find the longer video in that
[03:43:35.960 --> 03:43:40.360]  article survivors expose how sexual predators groom their victims let's roll the video
[03:43:40.360 --> 03:43:52.520]  i was abused by a priest as a child but as a teacher in my parish grade school
[03:43:53.080 --> 03:43:58.840]  i caught the associate pastor in the act of molesting a child i know he's been caught four
[03:43:58.840 --> 03:44:05.720]  times and yet he's still in a parish today i was abused as a child from the ages of nine to eleven
[03:44:05.720 --> 03:44:11.640]  by a priest in alexandria virginia who um was a newly ordained priest and he came to our house
[03:44:11.640 --> 03:44:16.920]  and he kind of adopted our family you know he ate dinner with us he went on vacation with us
[03:44:18.120 --> 03:44:23.480]  he became like a member of the family and i loved him and i adored him and he used that
[03:44:23.480 --> 03:44:29.480]  to start abusing me snap is survivors network of those abused by priests it was founded in
[03:44:29.480 --> 03:44:35.480]  chicago in 1988 and at that point the founder barbara blaine thought there were a few dozen
[03:44:35.480 --> 03:44:41.560]  clergy sex abuse survivors and she was reaching out to them this pope has done what pope ben addictive
[03:44:41.560 --> 03:44:46.120]  he said a lot of things you know he said we're not going to tolerate bishops abusing we're not
[03:44:46.120 --> 03:44:52.920]  going to tolerate priest abusing that how sad he is that that victims were abused and and that
[03:44:52.920 --> 03:44:59.800]  children were harmed but the key word is he said and you know he needs to do and that's the thing
[03:44:59.800 --> 03:45:04.920]  i think we're missing the archbishop during the last grand jury investigation and there have been
[03:45:04.920 --> 03:45:12.520]  two here in philadelphia uh justin regali when he when the grand jury uh report was handed down
[03:45:12.520 --> 03:45:18.280]  i believe there were 37 predators still in ministry and through the grand jury and the trials of
[03:45:18.280 --> 03:45:23.560]  mon senior lin who was convicted of moving knowingly moving child predators and endangering
[03:45:23.560 --> 03:45:30.520]  children and he is in prison for that part he played but cardinal regali quietly resigned
[03:45:30.520 --> 03:45:36.840]  he's living a life uh completely he hasn't lost his title hasn't lost his paycheck and this weekend
[03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:43.880]  we've noticed him in the front pew here at all the festivities he's being honored and yet he left
[03:45:43.880 --> 03:45:50.840]  in disgrace so to us the message is if you protect the predators if you keep the church's secret if
[03:45:50.840 --> 03:45:56.600]  you keep the lid on the scandal you'll be rewarded not you'll be held accountable child predators
[03:45:56.600 --> 03:46:01.400]  aren't the dirty old men hiding in the bushes child predators are charming they're charismatic
[03:46:01.400 --> 03:46:07.480]  they do many many good things and they help many kids but that doesn't mean they're not
[03:46:07.480 --> 03:46:12.840]  raping other children so you can't paint a predator as black or white because you know
[03:46:12.840 --> 03:46:16.600]  the pope's not taken action one thing we want to have happened is we'd like the federal government
[03:46:16.600 --> 03:46:22.200]  to take action we'd like them to investigate these crimes we've seen that happen in australia
[03:46:22.200 --> 03:46:29.480]  and belgium and ireland and canada and so we'd like to see the federal government
[03:46:29.480 --> 03:46:35.800]  investigate these crimes and and you know make the the pope release these documents like everyone
[03:46:35.800 --> 03:46:43.080]  else has done the catholic church admits there's over 60 about 6500 incredibly accused priest
[03:46:43.080 --> 03:46:50.200]  in the united states alone um we did some math and the catholic church also in 2012 said they
[03:46:50.200 --> 03:46:56.120]  believed there were about 100 000 clergy abuse victims in the united states and if you do the
[03:46:56.120 --> 03:47:03.080]  math of the united states is 6 of the world's population that would give you 1.5 million
[03:47:03.080 --> 03:47:12.520]  clergy abuse victims in the world so you can catch the rest of that amazing interview
[03:47:13.400 --> 03:47:17.880]  and what is the pope doing but first of all i'll give you that headline again survivors expose
[03:47:17.880 --> 03:47:23.080]  how sexual predators groom their victims starts off at leon macadoo talking about some articles
[03:47:23.080 --> 03:47:27.160]  one of which is you know the pope said he's gonna he feels for these people and he weeps for them
[03:47:27.160 --> 03:47:31.080]  or god weeps for them he didn't say he whipped for them which is interesting because i guess he
[03:47:31.080 --> 03:47:38.040]  doesn't really care he just knows that god cares and uh so far he hasn't made one arrest kicked out
[03:47:38.040 --> 03:47:44.040]  one priest and he admits there's at least two percent he says he says that himself two percent so
[03:47:44.040 --> 03:47:50.760]  that would be 8 000 pedophiles in the catholic church and but yet i'm not gonna kick anybody out
[03:47:50.760 --> 03:47:55.800]  and i've been in two and a half years so what's he doing there next segment i'm gonna have jacari
[03:47:55.800 --> 03:47:58.920]  jackson sitting in we're gonna talk about what's coming up on the informers nightly news and he
[03:47:58.920 --> 03:48:03.560]  just showed me an article we're gonna play some of that footage of the i guess the first russian
[03:48:03.560 --> 03:48:08.280]  airstrikes in syria so that should be very interesting i've got time for at least a couple
[03:48:08.280 --> 03:48:14.840]  more calls i got uh let's see who's first john in michigan go ahead you want to talk about sv40 yes i
[03:48:14.840 --> 03:48:22.760]  was told this is in regards to the monkey virus the sp40 um well what i was specifically looking
[03:48:22.760 --> 03:48:29.080]  for was sp277 which is the repeal of the mandatory vaccination bill that was signed in california
[03:48:29.080 --> 03:48:34.760]  to force children to take vaccines but i do know about sv40 and how that was in the polio vaccine
[03:48:34.760 --> 03:48:39.640]  and given to hundreds of thousands of people i think even a several million people in the united
[03:48:39.640 --> 03:48:46.040]  states for many years and now we have a cancer epidemic who to thunk it you're correct because
[03:48:46.040 --> 03:48:51.720]  it's genetic it goes from one generation to the other sure does and uh as far as the vaccine in
[03:48:51.720 --> 03:48:58.200]  california my son's out there and i don't know his his mother laws and that works for kaiser the
[03:48:58.200 --> 03:49:05.640]  farm intente the uh the house uh giant out there but i i'm not sure what uh they're going to have
[03:49:05.640 --> 03:49:11.160]  to deal with they're going to probably homeschool yeah well that's disgusting you're going to see
[03:49:11.160 --> 03:49:14.440]  an increase of homeschoolings which is going to you know lead to an increase of people
[03:49:14.440 --> 03:49:19.640]  not wanting to pay their property taxes to fund these public schools marcus in california you
[03:49:19.640 --> 03:49:25.640]  got a california guy what do you have to say about sp277 hey how are we doing i'm doing great
[03:49:25.640 --> 03:49:32.040]  what's going on well basically they just crossed the line in the sand i i heard you mentioned you
[03:49:32.040 --> 03:49:37.400]  know you can't believe it they got through with all the protest most everyone on the committee
[03:49:37.400 --> 03:49:43.800]  didn't even have any children right um we know senator pan has been funded by big pharma through
[03:49:43.800 --> 03:49:49.640]  his campaign yeah and one of senator pans uh one one one quick second telly blackwood did a video
[03:49:49.640 --> 03:49:54.920]  about uh one of senator pan staffers who actually took a vaccine and became deathly ill this guy
[03:49:54.920 --> 03:50:00.120]  was in a hospital bed speaking out against 277 and why he's pushing it through and that vaccines do
[03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:05.800]  cause harm but go ahead yeah that's not of course happened and of course you guys covered that
[03:50:05.800 --> 03:50:10.520]  but uh that didn't make our news i mean they i'm down in san diego that didn't come anywhere on the
[03:50:10.520 --> 03:50:17.720]  news of course not yeah he yeah yeah that doesn't fit the agenda well exactly i mean
[03:50:17.720 --> 03:50:25.080]  we hope that they went too far and they went to the private schools maybe they could have
[03:50:25.080 --> 03:50:32.760]  got away with it if they would have stayed public we've got a lot of wealthy very educated people
[03:50:32.760 --> 03:50:38.360]  and they're not going to home school and they're not going to vaccinate and that's just it yeah
[03:50:38.360 --> 03:50:43.080]  you're gonna see non-compliance civil disobedience that's what needs to happen non-compliance that's
[03:50:43.080 --> 03:50:47.400]  the only way you're gonna make your point if you wedge yourself into that cog and say nope
[03:50:47.400 --> 03:50:52.520]  you're not moving any farther then the cog will stop and then they'll have to take notice and when
[03:50:52.520 --> 03:50:55.720]  they start taking notice and they realize people are speaking out then they'll start to change

[03:55:44.680 --> 03:55:49.080]  be on the show tonight well we have the article that's on info wars dot com put up by kit daniels
[03:55:49.080 --> 03:55:54.600]  talking about the pro second amendment rally to counter the anti-gun rally that's going to happen
[03:55:54.600 --> 03:55:59.560]  at ut campus so we'll have a special report from joe biggs documenting all that and first of all
[03:55:59.560 --> 03:56:03.960]  to say something real quick about that anybody who says that we're trolling this anti-gun group
[03:56:03.960 --> 03:56:08.760]  just recall that back when we did the alamo speech they came and trolled us they put up pictures of
[03:56:08.760 --> 03:56:13.800]  then master sergeant cj grisham us army who is now retired they put up his pictures and we have to
[03:56:13.800 --> 03:56:18.040]  go out here and counter protest this guy so they've been doing it to us for a good while so it's not
[03:56:18.040 --> 03:56:21.880]  just us uh following them around and uh trying to tackle onto what they're doing and hey we just
[03:56:21.880 --> 03:56:25.960]  want to provide an open discourse of ideas we alex tried to talk to him and they got all physical
[03:56:25.960 --> 03:56:31.000]  with him in space at the alamo i mean it was pretty disturbing the way these liberal trendies who
[03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:34.760]  want to be all open and all about freedom how they want to come down on you if you don't agree with
[03:56:34.760 --> 03:56:39.000]  their agenda exactly right and speaking about things coming down we have this best report
[03:56:39.000 --> 03:56:43.880]  that's on the site right now caught on tape dramatic footage of russia's first airstrikes in
[03:56:43.880 --> 03:56:47.880]  syria if we can roll some of that footage now this is a zero hedge article but we also have
[03:56:47.880 --> 03:56:52.040]  an article put up by curtain emma and the russians told the united states that it should
[03:56:52.040 --> 03:56:57.960]  not fly us warplanes in syria but gave no geographical information about where russian
[03:56:57.960 --> 03:57:03.240]  plan to strike about russia plan to strike the senior officials said us missions are continuing
[03:57:03.240 --> 03:57:07.960]  as normal so we can go there and see all the dramatic footage of these strikes going on can
[03:57:07.960 --> 03:57:13.160]  we get zero hedge to change official to senior public servant okay senior public servant public
[03:57:13.160 --> 03:57:17.240]  servant and then as we start referring to him as i'm sticking tired of hearing him being called
[03:57:17.240 --> 03:57:21.160]  officials yeah so you can see the footage all right there and we'll talk about this more on
[03:57:21.160 --> 03:57:26.280]  the nightly news you can see the damage because i think dude we so much get into the zone where
[03:57:26.280 --> 03:57:30.840]  we just hear about something or oh it sucks for them they're over in another country yeah this is
[03:57:30.840 --> 03:57:35.080]  happening to real people you know if nothing else just be concerned that these could be your kids
[03:57:35.080 --> 03:57:39.080]  these could be your neighbors or you know what if one of your friends or family was out visiting
[03:57:39.080 --> 03:57:42.600]  someplace like this and these airstrikes happen you have to take these things seriously and just
[03:57:42.600 --> 03:57:47.400]  like oh don't brush it off just like it's just another day another story i totally agree and
[03:57:47.400 --> 03:57:51.560]  this boy this is really dramatic footage that you guys are showing up there and we've got that up
[03:57:51.560 --> 03:57:56.680]  at info wars dot com i mean that's the key if we don't put out the information the mainstream
[03:57:56.680 --> 03:58:00.920]  media is not going to put it out because they don't care about this information they want to see
[03:58:00.920 --> 03:58:05.400]  treat russia as the total evil bad guy when there's a lot we can learn from the russians
[03:58:05.400 --> 03:58:09.320]  there's especially in the health realm these guys have been looking at health on a lot of
[03:58:09.320 --> 03:58:13.480]  different ways and areas that we don't even touch yeah and i think it's need we need to
[03:58:13.480 --> 03:58:17.960]  start coming together on a lot of these health issues and let's look at vaccines you know let's
[03:58:17.960 --> 03:58:23.160]  come together and do the real studies on vaccines that we're not getting so with that join jacari
