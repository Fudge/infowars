[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.840 --> 00:19.380]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.380 --> 00:41.040]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much
[00:41.040 --> 00:45.960]  for joining us on this 11th day of November this Wednesday the 11th day of
[00:45.960 --> 00:54.100]  November 2009 we're going to be live here for the next four hours in the last
[00:54.100 --> 01:00.340]  hour and a half today we're going to have Dr. Sherry Tinpenny in studio fresh
[01:00.340 --> 01:08.820]  off a debate yesterday at the University of Texas against a pro vaccine advocate
[01:08.820 --> 01:12.940]  we'll be going over the latest information concerning the forced
[01:12.940 --> 01:18.280]  inoculation program going on covertly in public schools against helpless and
[01:18.280 --> 01:22.960]  defenseless elementary school students the government only target small
[01:22.960 --> 01:26.560]  children just like child molesters target small children because they have
[01:26.560 --> 01:32.760]  trouble telling the story and don't aren't believed we're going to be
[01:32.760 --> 01:37.160]  discussing how the predators are targeting the children we're going to be
[01:37.160 --> 01:43.360]  discussing an article up on prisonplanet.com by Paul Watson with Desiree
[01:43.360 --> 01:52.720]  Jennings the cheerleader from Washington DC John Hopkins said she
[01:52.720 --> 02:00.040]  clearly had a neuro disease a bad reaction in her brain and spinal column
[02:00.040 --> 02:05.400]  to the vaccine which the insert admits it can cause there's countless other
[02:05.400 --> 02:08.840]  reports around the country where the doctors admit people are having
[02:08.840 --> 02:12.840]  reactions and being paralyzed or partially paralyzed or having convulsions
[02:12.840 --> 02:18.080]  after all it's in the drug insert they admit it that it can cause this and of
[02:18.080 --> 02:22.560]  course they had to suspend similar injections in 76 due to this problem but
[02:22.560 --> 02:29.160]  there is a disinformation campaign in the media with zero evidence zero evidence
[02:29.160 --> 02:35.080]  just saying it's a hoax because Desiree Jennings got national attention
[02:35.080 --> 02:44.440]  and so Jenny McCarthy's foundation got her in touch with top medical doctors
[02:44.440 --> 02:51.080]  friends of Dr. Rima Labo by the way who know how to do very serious chelation it
[02:51.080 --> 02:54.040]  can also be dangerous because it strips your body of a lot of other things you
[02:54.040 --> 02:59.000]  need and she's going through those treatments and is getting better by the
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.720]  way I'm not saying take vaccines but that's also what the FDA states is that
[03:04.720 --> 03:09.120]  oh don't worry if you do have seizures or get paralyzed or have convulsions or
[03:09.120 --> 03:13.440]  lose feeling in your hands and feet it normally comes back and it does normally
[03:13.440 --> 03:18.360]  come back in fact I've got newscasts for newscasts for newscasts where they go
[03:18.360 --> 03:22.680]  don't worry you know this fella got a flu shot and now is in a wheelchair but
[03:22.680 --> 03:27.360]  doctors say he should get control over his body back soon the inflammation in
[03:27.360 --> 03:33.200]  his brain and and brainstem and spinal cord should dissipate in the next few
[03:33.200 --> 03:40.680]  months so so the doctors attacking Desiree Jennings saying oh she made it all
[03:40.680 --> 03:46.160]  up you know how is she getting better now they know full well that most of the
[03:46.160 --> 03:52.920]  time you do get better now it tends to come back as different neurological
[03:52.920 --> 04:01.000]  diseases later the list is long so let's hope it doesn't come back with the
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.800]  people that seem to get better she's still in a wheelchair she's still having
[04:06.800 --> 04:10.680]  convulsions but it looks like a lot of it's being reversed and what do they do
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.080]  they viciously come in a tiger she went to three separate medical
[04:14.080 --> 04:20.720]  institutions they did CAT scans MRIs she clearly has this neurological disorder
[04:20.720 --> 04:27.080]  it's certified by the doctors that looked at her at prestigious medical
[04:27.080 --> 04:31.160]  institutions but from the distance doctors and the employee of the vaccine
[04:31.160 --> 04:38.120]  manufacturers I think they're open to serious defamation of character lawsuits
[04:38.120 --> 04:43.760]  and I'm not some litigious you know Sue happy person you start accusing some
[04:43.760 --> 04:48.080]  innocent woman who's been certified to have this disorder caused by the
[04:48.080 --> 04:52.960]  vaccine and the FDA even admits it and you're so in love with your deadly
[04:52.960 --> 05:00.440]  vaccines you come out and call her a liar when it's on the injection insert

[08:20.160 --> 08:26.520]  remember that the globalist the illegitimate criminals that control the
[08:26.520 --> 08:32.480]  planet of the issuance of currency and credit they go pay off politicians get
[08:32.480 --> 08:36.920]  the governments to give them the sole certification to issue currency and
[08:36.920 --> 08:42.880]  credit the bankers then buy up the entire planet and remember they're making
[08:42.880 --> 08:49.560]  their move right now Al Gore George Soros German Chancellor Merkel Barroso

[08:59.200 --> 09:06.600]  and seeing it in and everywhere else calling for world government
[09:06.600 --> 09:20.000]  so all of that is currently being announced and trumpeted open-world
[09:20.000 --> 09:27.040]  government is being trumpeted but a type of psychological compulsion a type of
[09:27.040 --> 09:34.840]  psychological barrier a type of psychological conditioning has been
[09:34.840 --> 09:43.000]  engineered into the public there has been a literal hypnotic suggestion that
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.720]  there is no world government there is no planetary government there is no
[09:46.720 --> 09:51.400]  private Federal Reserve there is no Rothschild family there are no Rockefellers
[09:51.400 --> 09:57.600]  government corruption is impossible and is it a conspiracy theory see they've
[09:57.600 --> 10:03.440]  lowered your political immune system and told you like telling a child there are
[10:03.440 --> 10:08.640]  not 18 wheelers driving up and down I-35 there are no cars on that major
[10:08.640 --> 10:13.280]  interstate highway go at four o'clock in the afternoon when there's heavy
[10:13.280 --> 10:19.440]  traffic going at 75 miles an hour and dance in the street and you just tell
[10:19.440 --> 10:23.040]  that child that thousands of times and then finally just turn them loose in
[10:23.040 --> 10:26.160]  the street they just run out in front of an 18 wheeler there is no world
[10:26.160 --> 10:29.360]  government there is no corruption there is no plan to put troops on the
[10:29.360 --> 10:34.080]  streets of America there is no north com the CIA does not ship in narcotics they
[10:34.080 --> 10:39.960]  do not ship in opium they do not control Colombian Afghanistan to ship in over a
[10:39.960 --> 10:43.680]  trillion dollars a year five hundred billion at least of cocaine five hundred
[10:43.680 --> 10:48.920]  billion in heroin they do not have secret sites to torture people they are
[10:48.920 --> 10:54.520]  not spying on you and they just say that over and over and over again and have
[10:54.520 --> 10:58.200]  pundits laughing at people and saying there's no such thing as a new world
[10:58.200 --> 11:02.040]  order and then finally they come out and they say we're surveilling everything
[11:02.040 --> 11:05.760]  you're doing everything you're writing everything you're faxing everything you're
[11:05.760 --> 11:09.560]  emailing we're openly setting up world government you will pay your taxes
[11:09.560 --> 11:14.200]  directly to Al Gore he is your savior he is setting up a global religion bow to
[11:14.200 --> 11:18.240]  it you will thumb scan and face scan to buy and sell this will go on your carbon
[11:18.240 --> 11:22.240]  credit national ID card you will not be able to own a gun or fly or have a job
[11:22.240 --> 11:25.320]  unless you were in good graces with the government there will be no judges there
[11:25.320 --> 11:29.280]  will be no juries this is extra judicial this is freedom freedom is
[11:29.280 --> 11:32.680]  secretly being arrested freedom is not being able to buy and sell without face
[11:32.680 --> 11:36.360]  scanning freedom is having everything you do tracked and run and having
[11:36.360 --> 11:40.680]  bureaucrats inspect your home every week and having local block captain
[11:40.680 --> 11:45.320]  environmental enforcers who directly report to colonels and generals now in
[11:45.320 --> 11:53.120]  civilian positions over every major city to control the grid freedom is having the
[11:53.120 --> 11:57.400]  military industrial complex merged with the prison complex and merged with the
[11:57.400 --> 12:02.280]  big pharma complex with the surveillance security complex and start forced
[12:02.280 --> 12:07.560]  inoculations forced drugging total takeover of society the giant government
[12:07.560 --> 12:11.800]  feeding all your tax money directly into the private institutions that control
[12:11.800 --> 12:17.160]  the government giant total corporate monopolies total corporate welfare the
[12:17.160 --> 12:22.880]  liberals controlling giant hordes of fluoride had dumbed down public school
[12:22.880 --> 12:30.840]  educated just mindless dangerous hordes to be sicked on anyone whose middle
[12:30.840 --> 12:37.040]  class anyone that resists the tyranny the republicans on the other hand pro war
[12:37.040 --> 12:42.520]  pro death pro tyranny saying that freedom and liberty is launching all these
[12:42.520 --> 12:48.440]  new wars and having the Patriot Act and body scanners everywhere and no freedom
[12:49.160 --> 12:55.080]  and the democrats are just as bad and pro war just with different rhetoric
[12:55.080 --> 13:18.000]  and so they've come in and implanted the psychological message through movies and
[13:18.000 --> 13:25.800]  culture and fiction and nonfiction and books just everywhere I've seen hundreds
[13:25.800 --> 13:28.880]  and hundreds of TV shows over the years that listeners have sent me clips of
[13:28.880 --> 13:33.520]  where there'll be a bad guy or a murderer killer who's raping children or
[13:33.520 --> 13:36.960]  dealing drugs and he'll believe in the new world order conspiracy theory the
[13:36.960 --> 13:42.040]  message is scum filth racist trash child molesters believe in the world
[13:42.040 --> 13:48.520]  government and then now they openly announced the world government it's
[13:48.520 --> 13:51.080]  exactly what we told you it was going to be because we were reading their own
[13:51.080 --> 13:55.960]  documents and people have a psychological compulsion to not be able to resist it
[13:55.960 --> 13:59.760]  because it was implanted in their minds and they were conditioned that it
[13:59.760 --> 14:03.960]  didn't exist or you were a racist or you were a cook or you were bad if you
[14:03.960 --> 14:12.080]  talked about it you see that the new world order is run by psychologists
[14:12.080 --> 14:15.560]  psychiatrists they're run by top pitchmen people that understand
[14:15.560 --> 14:21.680]  anthropology sociology individuals that understand how the human psyche works
[14:21.680 --> 14:25.360]  and they're bringing us through different layers of programming and
[14:25.360 --> 14:43.680]  control
[14:43.680 --> 14:49.160]  and so here we are with completely criminal offshore banks with no
[14:49.160 --> 14:53.920]  constitutional right no legal right to be doing what they're doing robbing us
[14:53.920 --> 14:58.240]  completely blind and the police nationwide and worldwide are given
[14:58.240 --> 15:03.520]  weekly intelligence reports where they mix the term cop killer and Ku Klux
[15:03.520 --> 15:09.720]  Klan in with anyone who doesn't want to have the banks take over the my act
[15:09.720 --> 15:12.880]  report the homeland security reports there's literally hundreds of them and
[15:12.880 --> 15:18.040]  it's all the same mantra the first page is about a cop killer and the next
[15:18.040 --> 15:21.880]  page is about Ron Paul and people that want to audit the Fed I mean police do
[15:21.880 --> 15:28.200]  you like being conditioned by such low-level insultingly simple propaganda
[15:28.200 --> 15:32.680]  I mean that's how dumb they think you are is they give you third-grader
[15:32.680 --> 15:40.040]  propaganda CEOs and wealthy people who aren't really part of the establishment
[15:40.040 --> 15:43.240]  they're given another grade of propaganda where they're told the truth
[15:43.240 --> 15:48.200]  about a lot of things but it's all spun well global government we have to you
[15:48.200 --> 15:52.120]  know help the third world and lower the standard of living in the United
[15:52.120 --> 15:54.840]  States to help the third world they don't explain that they're lowering the
[15:54.840 --> 15:57.920]  standard of the third world and the United States they don't tell you that
[15:57.920 --> 16:02.080]  it's a vertical integration to create an absolute world monopoly not just of
[16:02.080 --> 16:11.840]  money and wealth and land and power but of the access to true high-tech life
[16:11.840 --> 16:18.040]  extension technologies reservations of high-tech systems have been developed
[16:18.040 --> 16:21.960]  under government and private industry that are being walled off under national
[16:21.960 --> 16:27.360]  security and we're being given a form of arrested development in technology
[16:27.360 --> 16:30.440]  where even though it looks like technologies accelerating very quickly
[16:30.440 --> 16:34.040]  it's actually advancing very slowly compared to the true advances that have
[16:34.040 --> 16:39.120]  been made the last 40 years and so we're walled off in this false reality of
[16:39.120 --> 16:44.200]  disinformation our waters poisoned we're brain damaged by design in official
[16:44.200 --> 16:49.280]  government documents so that we don't have that feverish spark of human
[16:49.280 --> 16:55.400]  creativity and understanding and that spark of human resistance to get out
[16:55.400 --> 16:59.280]  and say no they sap our will psychologically they sap our will
[16:59.280 --> 17:04.040]  through chemical induction into the water and food and air you are under the
[17:04.040 --> 17:12.400]  most unbelievably mechanized detailed crafted genius system of mass murder and
[17:12.400 --> 17:17.640]  control you are being crammed feet first into a globalist soul-sucking meat
[17:17.640 --> 17:22.920]  grinder and I'm gonna ask you something do you really want to be part of this do
[17:22.920 --> 17:25.760]  you really want these people to be able to carry this out because the globalist
[17:25.760 --> 17:30.560]  openly right and say hey if you were human beings if you didn't deserve this
[17:30.560 --> 17:51.920]  to happen to you under survival of the fittest if you truly had a right to
[17:51.920 --> 17:57.560]  even debate us you would wake up and see what we're doing to you I mean that's
[17:57.560 --> 18:02.200]  their message their message is you've been told what we're doing to you you've
[18:02.200 --> 18:09.040]  been warned that's the main reason they let people like me on air they just they
[18:09.040 --> 18:16.560]  think so little of you they think there's no hope for you I mean they're so far
[18:16.560 --> 18:18.960]  along in their plan now they come out and just admit the whole thing
[18:18.960 --> 18:22.840]  publicly hundreds and hundreds of news articles I've seen in the last month
[18:22.840 --> 18:27.320]  saying more than one child is bad and we need to tax children and we need to
[18:27.320 --> 18:30.760]  take people's children and raise them in dormitories and cameras need to be in
[18:30.760 --> 18:36.240]  the homes of all parents 20 plus thousand parents in the UK now have it I mean
[18:36.240 --> 18:43.280]  they mean business ladies and gentlemen these people mean business they mean
[18:43.280 --> 18:52.240]  business big time they're not playing games and I understand a lot of people

[24:11.120 --> 24:23.480]  mill Moyers who's really a prototype of David Gergen or Carl Rove is a really
[24:23.480 --> 24:30.160]  slick player and his propaganda is tailored to intellectual wealthy liberals
[24:30.160 --> 24:38.600]  and everything about Bill Moyers is a basically to build up credibility on
[24:38.600 --> 24:43.240]  issues like warrantless wiretapping the police state the shadow government but
[24:43.240 --> 24:49.640]  then sell you socialism now George Soros one of the richest men in the world
[24:49.640 --> 24:55.120]  indictments and criminal convictions against him all over the planet who is
[24:55.120 --> 24:58.920]  helping drive down the dollar he says he wants the dollar to fall he is one of
[24:58.920 --> 25:06.880]  the main backers of president Barack Obama he runs six major news websites
[25:06.880 --> 25:12.120]  that attack Alex Jones yours truly every week he's a very dangerous person
[25:12.120 --> 25:17.280]  listen to how Bill Moyers on PBS and we've got him on Lair News hour we've
[25:17.280 --> 25:24.000]  got him on c-span I mean he's making the rounds notice how they phrase this clip
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.880]  that we're gonna play going into break and coming out of break from Bill
[25:26.880 --> 25:35.160]  Moyers last week notice how Moyers phrases it that Soros has the moral
[25:35.160 --> 25:40.200]  high ground what's wrong with America we've lost our social compact we've you
[25:40.200 --> 25:45.520]  know we've lost our morals we don't have a sense of what we need to do our duty
[25:45.520 --> 25:51.720]  this is of course the setup for Soros to call for the New World Order global
[25:51.720 --> 25:55.720]  government carbon tax that they always leave real simple it's like we've got
[25:55.720 --> 26:03.800]  to save our earth we've got to control our environment doesn't matter if plants
[26:03.800 --> 26:06.640]  breathe carbon dioxide doesn't matter of the earth's been cooling for four years
[26:06.640 --> 26:11.880]  doesn't matter if 95% of the climatologist or more the UN's got a
[26:11.880 --> 26:16.320]  few hundred over 30,000 of sent letters to Congress and file lawsuits saying
[26:16.320 --> 26:23.480]  it's the son no kidding the son who would have thunk it and now Al Gore
[26:23.480 --> 26:31.320]  setting up a religion these people mean business we're talking about jihadis or
[26:31.320 --> 26:36.360]  crusaders for communism but it's not your mama's communism it's not your
[26:36.360 --> 26:42.560]  grandpa's communism it's real communism run by the central banks I remember the
[26:42.560 --> 26:46.800]  last Chinese president before the current one when he left office six seven
[26:46.800 --> 26:53.320]  years ago was in CNN communist Chinese leader says China the ultimate example
[26:53.320 --> 26:59.840]  of capitalism people said what does that mean that's an oxymoron no real
[26:59.840 --> 27:04.040]  capitalism is big powerful robber barons coming in and financing communist
[27:04.040 --> 27:07.880]  fascist socialists all command and control different flavors of the same
[27:07.880 --> 27:16.640]  thing to bring in a command and control system to make you dependent on them so
[27:16.640 --> 27:20.640]  they can run your life like we're just going to come back from break and play
[27:20.640 --> 27:26.840]  this clip and then get into all the other news but listen to George Soros
[27:26.840 --> 27:32.760]  here calling for a new world order calling for a global government I mean
[27:32.760 --> 27:36.000]  we can play the clips of Gordon Brown calling for global governance we can
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.760]  play the clips of Al Gore calling for global governance that we have those
[27:39.760 --> 27:48.000]  clips in my film fall of the Republic and fall of the Republic is a flare it is
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.960]  a warning it is an SOS because after decades of denying world government
[27:54.960 --> 27:58.000]  and telling people they were coax if they thought about it or talked about it
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.920]  putting that psychological barrier in in their minds operant conditioning it's
[28:02.920 --> 28:06.440]  like raising a hand to a dog you can tell if somebody beats their dog or cat
[28:06.440 --> 28:12.760]  because they'll flinch away from your hand it's the same thing they've beaten
[28:12.760 --> 28:16.400]  you so many times there is no government corruption there is no new world order

[28:20.920 --> 28:24.000]  they come out and admit it all and you just flinch you hear fellow reserve
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.400]  new world order I'm gonna pull my head into my turtle shell I don't want my
[28:28.400 --> 28:32.280]  neighbors to think I'm a cook so that when they launched world government
[28:32.280 --> 28:37.500]  openly took over our sovereignty by unelected criminal private groups as the
[28:37.500 --> 28:43.280]  pirates openly board our ship of state and openly announced run their flag up
[28:43.280 --> 28:47.600]  and say we've conquered you you're gonna pay your taxes to us now we're gonna

[33:02.920 --> 33:08.360]  the preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River she's a
[33:08.360 --> 33:26.520]  gold drive as the whole global system becomes so complex with such gargantuan
[33:26.520 --> 33:31.760]  forces interlocked with each other driving it forward that it doesn't know
[33:31.760 --> 33:38.840]  how to obey Adam Smith's natural laws no I think our ability to govern ourselves
[33:38.840 --> 33:46.880]  doesn't keep pace with our ability to to exercise exercise power of over
[33:46.880 --> 33:56.240]  nature control over nature so we are very complicated civilization and we could
[33:56.240 --> 34:01.920]  actually destroy our civilization because of our inability to govern
[34:01.920 --> 34:07.080]  ourselves would this all be happening if we still have a strong sense of the
[34:07.080 --> 34:12.080]  social compact our social safety net has been greatly reduced to people have a
[34:12.080 --> 34:16.160]  real sense that the gods of capital have left little space for anyone else
[34:16.160 --> 34:19.880]  people at the top don't have much empathy for people at the bottom yes
[34:19.880 --> 34:26.360]  because there is there is a common interest and this belief that everybody
[34:26.360 --> 34:32.200]  pursuing his self-interest will maximize the common interest or take care of the
[34:32.200 --> 34:39.200]  common interest is a false idea it's a suitable idea for those who are rich who
[34:39.200 --> 34:46.880]  are successful who are powerful they choose them to justify you know enjoying
[34:46.880 --> 34:53.360]  the fruits without paying taxes the idea of paying taxes is an absolute no no
[34:53.360 --> 35:03.840]  right non-patriotic unpatriotic so yes you must have in my opinion you need it
[35:03.840 --> 35:10.520]  for instance attacks on carbon emissions but that is unacceptable politically so
[35:10.520 --> 35:17.880]  we are going to have cap and trade and the trading will will have all kinds of
[35:17.880 --> 35:24.760]  loopholes and misuse of the regulations and all kinds of ways of making money
[35:24.760 --> 35:32.360]  without actually dealing with the problem of that that it's designed to cure so
[35:32.360 --> 35:37.640]  that's how the political process distorts things so let's think about those
[35:37.640 --> 35:40.880]  people down at Neely's barbecue going home tonight having heard you what
[35:40.880 --> 35:44.400]  they've heard you say as the system is really dysfunctioning right now it's
[35:44.400 --> 35:48.920]  out of control nobody's in charge they've heard you express your own worry
[35:48.920 --> 35:54.440]  that in the next three months it could get much much worse and they've heard
[35:54.440 --> 36:00.880]  you say that you don't see much good news immediately on the horizon so let's
[36:00.880 --> 36:04.360]  leave them something to think about as they go home let them go home and say
[36:04.360 --> 36:10.240]  mr. sorrow said here are three things we can do simply one well deal with the
[36:10.240 --> 36:19.080]  market with the mortgage problem reduce for closures recapitalize the banks and
[36:19.080 --> 36:28.360]  and then work on a better world order where we work together to do these off
[36:28.360 --> 36:34.320]  problems that confront humanity like global warming and I think I think that
[36:34.320 --> 36:41.480]  dealing with global warming will require a lot of investment you see for the
[36:41.480 --> 36:48.080]  last 25 years the world economy the motor of the world economy that has been
[36:48.080 --> 36:53.600]  driving it was consumption by the American consumer who has been spending
[36:53.600 --> 37:02.040]  more than he's been saving all right and he's been producing so that motor is
[37:02.040 --> 37:09.600]  now switched off it's finished it's run out of can't continue you need a new
[37:09.600 --> 37:17.120]  motor and we have a big problem global warming requires big investment and that
[37:17.120 --> 37:23.400]  could be the motor of the world economy in the years to come putting money in
[37:23.400 --> 37:28.600]  building infrastructure converting the green technology instead of consuming
[37:28.600 --> 37:36.800]  building a electricity grid saving on energy or rewiring the houses adjusting
[37:36.800 --> 37:44.720]  your lifestyle where energy is it's got to cost more until it you introduce those
[37:44.720 --> 37:51.840]  new things so okay painful but now listening to that that is high-grade
[37:51.840 --> 38:01.240]  mind control that you just heard all lies deceit twisting a George Soros went
[38:01.240 --> 38:06.240]  before Congress last year calling for the banker bailout which was really the
[38:06.240 --> 38:10.760]  banking takeover 23.7 trillion stolen in the U.S. given to private banks that
[38:10.760 --> 38:16.320]  he's connected to 50 trillion plus worldwide all together then he came out
[38:16.320 --> 38:21.200]  this year and testified against the banks as if he was the good guy fighting
[38:21.200 --> 38:27.440]  at all now he comes out and criticizes certain systems of cap and trade and
[38:27.440 --> 38:31.800]  admits that they're corrupt because he knows that their sales job is failing
[38:31.800 --> 38:37.640]  and says what we need is investment you're going to have to pay more for
[38:37.640 --> 38:42.280]  energy that will fix the economy and when he says investment that's what
[38:42.280 --> 38:46.080]  mankind moon has been calling for in speech after speech from the UN the
[38:46.080 --> 38:52.840]  Secretary General is direct global taxes on energy directly to the United
[38:52.840 --> 38:58.360]  Nations and global governance and so what he's doing here is giving you a
[38:58.360 --> 39:02.400]  false choice he's saying oh no you can choose cap and trade or you could choose
[39:02.400 --> 39:08.640]  direct global government and global taxes which he calls investment so he
[39:08.640 --> 39:12.080]  knows over 70% of Americans are against cap and trade and polls so he comes
[39:12.080 --> 39:20.080]  out says oh I'm against cap and trade what I'm for is investment and then the
[39:20.080 --> 39:23.560]  investment is you're going to pay more for energy and then he states the big
[39:23.560 --> 39:28.920]  lie that America is done that the engine is dead that Americans are bad that
[39:28.920 --> 39:33.560]  we're in debt that we consume more than we produce when that's globalism that
[39:33.560 --> 39:37.840]  George Soros and others have challenged with tax incentives to move our
[39:37.840 --> 39:45.000]  industry overseas with tax incentives and piling rules and regulations up here
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.440]  in the United States and Europe so we couldn't compete with India and China
[39:49.440 --> 39:52.640]  and Mexico and other third-world nations and developing nations that the
[39:52.640 --> 39:56.040]  globalist have made their investment in so under this global government
[39:56.040 --> 40:00.800]  architecture run by private interest in the UN built around the IMF as Soros
[40:00.800 --> 40:05.880]  and others are calling for they will decide what you can develop what you
[40:05.880 --> 40:09.680]  can build what you can do and from that point the bankers who've created these
[40:09.680 --> 40:14.120]  tens of trillions of fiat currency can force the sale of your companies your
[40:14.120 --> 40:19.880]  farms your ranches your businesses to them that's why they started in the
[40:19.880 --> 40:23.720]  last 20 years with things that sounded reasonable to set the precedent that a
[40:23.720 --> 40:30.120]  global regulatory authority can make the rules they come out 20 years ago and say
[40:30.120 --> 40:40.680]  the earth is dying chemicals in spray bottles CFCs are destroying the ozone
[40:40.680 --> 40:47.320]  layer of course it's now been documented major scientific research that's been
[40:47.320 --> 40:51.320]  published over and over again that during different parts of the year the
[40:51.320 --> 40:55.880]  ozone layer naturally gets thin in different parts of the world just like
[40:55.880 --> 41:03.040]  the Arctic and the Antarctic gets bigger in the winter and smaller in the
[41:03.040 --> 41:07.320]  summer but they point a camera from space and show you a time-lapse photo in
[41:07.320 --> 41:14.160]  the summer of the Arctic at the north and the Antarctic at the south getting
[41:14.160 --> 41:17.960]  smaller and they don't tell you oh it's just getting smaller than the summer
[41:17.960 --> 41:23.960]  they say oh look at just shrunk it's all melting see it's all parlor tricks and
[41:23.960 --> 41:28.680]  so they set the precedent because DuPont and Dow Chemical and others their
[41:28.680 --> 41:32.440]  patents were up on the different chemicals and spray cans and an air
[41:32.440 --> 41:38.560]  conditioners they had new patents out really it was 25 years ago and they
[41:38.560 --> 41:43.240]  forced everyone to buy their patents shut down all the other refrigeration
[41:43.240 --> 41:46.800]  manufacturers air conditioning manufacturers made them all come by the
[41:46.800 --> 41:51.040]  new patent and that massively increased the cost and they made huge profits
[41:51.040 --> 41:55.080]  imagine making everyone in the world who has air conditioning by your new patent
[41:55.080 --> 42:01.000]  that's why they passed that law when they pass a global law through the UN
[42:01.000 --> 42:07.480]  enforced by the Western powers and even mercenary forces to ban diamonds that
[42:07.480 --> 42:12.320]  aren't to be certified they tell you it's to stop slavery they tell you it's to
[42:12.320 --> 42:16.080]  stop abuse they tell you their diamonds are clean and humane which is actually
[42:16.080 --> 42:20.200]  a lie they don't want African nations being able to produce their own diamonds
[42:20.200 --> 42:24.800]  so they tell you terrorists are mining diamonds anyone that doesn't buy a
[42:24.800 --> 42:28.520]  diamond from them or from one of their minds as a terrorist to keep the
[42:28.520 --> 42:32.920]  monopoly on diamonds that are only semi precious it's artificial scarcity same
[42:32.920 --> 42:37.240]  scam global government is about the central banks being the only people that
[42:37.240 --> 42:41.240]  can issue currency and credit so they can have control it's about big central
[42:41.240 --> 42:44.840]  banks having the monopoly over diamonds it's about big central banks having
[42:44.840 --> 42:49.000]  monopoly on where oil can be produced Alaska has more than Saudi Arabia we
[42:49.000 --> 42:55.320]  can't have it another example but now they're just skipping ahead of all of
[42:55.320 --> 42:58.360]  that and saying you know what we're gonna pass a Copenhagen Treaty and we're
[42:58.360 --> 43:02.280]  gonna have the nation states pass laws most of Europe and England have already
[43:02.280 --> 43:09.280]  done it the US is on the verge where an unelected group at the UN with the IMF
[43:09.280 --> 43:14.320]  can set rules on everything that has carbon involved in the manufacture or
[43:14.320 --> 43:18.760]  anything that puts off any type of gas any type of greenhouse gas or any type
[43:18.760 --> 43:24.240]  of carbon and you're going to pay taxes to them on all of it if they even let
[43:24.240 --> 43:28.280]  you have a business or a company now listening to George Soros you would
[43:28.280 --> 43:37.160]  think he was against all of that that's the twisted level of manipulation I
[43:37.160 --> 43:40.840]  mean I could do four hours just on that clip we didn't play the whole clip
[43:40.840 --> 43:47.200]  starting it and stopping it and analyzing everything he said that's why
[43:47.200 --> 43:53.120]  he's George Soros that's why Al Gore is Al Gore these are slick slick slick slick
[43:53.120 --> 44:02.880]  liars everything is about a monopoly for these individuals everything is about
[44:02.880 --> 44:07.880]  them being able to set the precedent so first oh you can't have these different
[44:07.880 --> 44:10.720]  chemicals and spray bottles now that sounds reasonable we got to save the
[44:10.720 --> 44:15.640]  earth you you can't have free on an air conditioning okay got to buy the new
[44:15.640 --> 44:22.880]  product from them from a select group okay we've got new light bulbs they use
[44:22.880 --> 44:27.480]  less energy and it matter of their toxic and have mercury in them everybody's
[44:27.480 --> 44:30.840]  got to adopt the new light bulbs hey everybody's got to adopt a low flush
[44:30.840 --> 44:35.440]  toilet it saves a lot of water sounds reasonable let's do it that's a UN
[44:35.440 --> 44:44.200]  treaty see we're going under global government there's UN treaty signed in
[44:44.200 --> 44:48.520]  2000 for a world ID card I mean I'm still trying to convince the American
[44:48.520 --> 44:53.920]  people that we have a national ID card Bill Clinton signed the executive order
[44:53.920 --> 44:59.120]  in 1994 it's in my first film America destroyed by design that I made in
[44:59.120 --> 45:06.320]  1997 we we had a national ID card in 1994 it still had the name of your state
[45:06.320 --> 45:11.040]  on it but it was a federal computer system standardized whether you live in
[45:11.040 --> 45:16.400]  Alabama Texas New York California Alaska but guess what they didn't stop
[45:16.400 --> 45:21.640]  there in England in Germany in Australia all over the world in the
[45:21.640 --> 45:28.440]  mid 90s standardization went into place and then in 2000 a UN treaty was signed
[45:28.440 --> 45:32.920]  in Australia they had a summit to standardize it globally it was already
[45:32.920 --> 45:38.560]  standardized they just made it the law so we had a world government ID card in
[45:38.560 --> 45:43.960]  2000 then after the staged events of 9-11 they announced oh we are going to
[45:43.960 --> 45:47.120]  have a real ID the feds are going to standardize your driver's license with
[45:47.120 --> 45:53.440]  a face scan and a thumbprint when every state in the union already had that by
[45:53.440 --> 45:58.400]  2000 see we're already under the world government we're already in it they're
[45:58.400 --> 46:04.560]  just announcing it to you that's why you hear oh foreigners have to be face
[46:04.560 --> 46:09.420]  scanned and thumb scanned and body scan when they come into the US what they
[46:09.420 --> 46:14.560]  don't tell you is that's a treaty when you fly out now to Japan or England or
[46:14.560 --> 46:19.920]  Germany or France or Russia and every other nation's now adopting it they
[46:19.920 --> 46:23.400]  haven't all adopted it but they're all now getting in line to adopt it adopted
[46:23.400 --> 46:28.320]  you are now face scanned thumb printed body scanned when you fly out see in
[46:28.320 --> 46:32.200]  every country they sell it to their people hey we're only doing this for
[46:32.200 --> 46:36.280]  foreigners people are like yeah let's get the foreigners there's too many of them
[46:36.280 --> 46:39.120]  all the government actually waves all that for them and let some in and let
[46:39.120 --> 46:44.760]  some violate visas they told Texans they were thumbprinting us to stop illegal
[46:44.760 --> 46:51.560]  aliens but then they gave them waivers from it all see it's global it's global
[46:51.560 --> 46:57.080]  and they always present it to you with their psych warfare chiefs and in pitch
[46:57.080 --> 47:02.160]  man they're advertising execs they know how to sell this to you they know how to
[47:02.160 --> 47:09.320]  sell it to all of us you got to get wise to their scams now of course I knew they
[47:09.320 --> 47:16.400]  were gonna announce a national ID card because we already had one in 94 of
[47:16.400 --> 47:20.880]  course I knew they were gonna put in body scanners I read the UN treaties people
[47:20.880 --> 47:23.840]  keep asking how did you know all this was gonna happen how how did you know
[47:23.840 --> 47:28.600]  that all the police in 1998 would suddenly be issued black uniforms and
[47:28.600 --> 47:34.560]  and and and you basically Darth Vader body armor because all over the western
[47:34.560 --> 47:37.560]  world there were federal grants to the states to pay for it
[47:37.560 --> 47:42.680]  standardization of uniforms to intimidate the people and then now the
[47:42.680 --> 47:46.520]  police admit it's for intimidation any government that wants to intimidate you
[47:46.520 --> 48:03.480]  is bad period now I want to go over the news and then we come back in the second

[55:18.920 --> 55:21.520]  gonna go through this news but let me go ahead and mention it now German
[55:21.520 --> 55:26.440]  Chancellor Merkel calls for a New World Order we have her disgusting quotes
[55:26.440 --> 55:32.280]  here she calls it a planetary regime but all the police training manual say it
[55:32.280 --> 55:37.360]  doesn't exist and you're a cop killer if you talk about it can the police put
[55:37.360 --> 55:43.160]  two and two together who the real enemy is here I'm also I haven't gotten into it
[55:43.160 --> 55:48.200]  but at the bottom of the next hour I'm going to spend 10 minutes and give you
[55:48.200 --> 55:51.120]  my breakdown on what happened with the Fort Hood shooting I haven't really
[55:51.120 --> 55:55.240]  talked about it because I'm wanting to process gauge the information you heard
[55:55.240 --> 55:59.160]  Ventura on the show yesterday thinking it's an inside job everybody I talked
[55:59.160 --> 56:02.880]  to I respect that's their same gut reaction with all the MO all the evidence
[56:02.880 --> 56:08.160]  will be talking about that whatever's going on there's certainly capitalizing
[56:08.160 --> 56:15.400]  on it for the police state and they kept calling it a cop killer gun he used I
[56:15.400 --> 56:19.760]  went looked at a wired magazine weapons review by a weapons armor and they said
[56:19.760 --> 56:23.840]  it is not a cop killer but any gun can be a cop killer but see that's how they're
[56:23.840 --> 56:26.800]  trying to demonize the Second Amendment they're saying well it shoots a rifle
[56:26.800 --> 56:31.480]  around there are hundreds of pistols that shoot a rifle around and yeah it's a
[56:31.480 --> 56:39.920]  rifle round a cut down 223 extremely weak and wired magazine tested it and
[56:39.920 --> 56:48.520]  found that it only pierces cruddy shrapnel vest you know stuff they had 30 40
[56:48.520 --> 56:53.720]  years ago the lightest body armor up close it'll pierce it well that's the
[56:53.720 --> 56:58.120]  whole point any rifle round will so there's now calls to ban this round if
[56:58.120 --> 57:02.080]  they do that it'll set the precedent to ban all rifle rounds there aren't many
[57:02.080 --> 57:11.080]  types of body armor that'll stop a 308 or a 7 millimeter mag the toughest
[57:11.080 --> 57:15.400]  breastplate might deflect it but you're gonna feel like you got kicked by an
[57:15.400 --> 57:22.200]  elephant so again that's the mind control the oxymoron of a gun being a cop
[57:22.200 --> 57:25.640]  killer any guns a cop killer a meat flavor is a cop killer a butcher and I've
[57:25.640 --> 57:31.880]  said cop killer but see once they sell the idea of banning anything that's a
[57:31.880 --> 57:36.440]  cop killer they can ban it all just thought you might want to know that
[57:36.440 --> 57:41.000]  that's how the scam works this is from the Hill newspaper read puts house
[57:41.000 --> 57:48.160]  health care bill on Senate calendar it's going to a vote and all the neocon

[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:25.600]  gonna learn a lot about football you get obsessed with football 14 hours a day

[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:49.040]  there and educate others we don't have a lot of time and the time for denial is

[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:58.080]  Alex how you doing I'm doing all right but my country's being taken over by a
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:02.560]  bunch of criminal bankers and I want to stop them no kidding no kidding no kidding
[1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:06.760]  hey listen I just want to let you know I'm not fell at work so well to read in
[1:11:06.760 --> 1:11:14.840]  that Fort Brett Fort Hood shooter used to come to my lunch line every day what's
[1:11:14.840 --> 1:11:21.400]  your take on this creature I think I think the government's full of crap
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:26.920]  point and point blank do me a favor let's not I'm trying to even cut the
[1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:29.920]  light language myself so I understand it makes you angry but but but give us
[1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:34.840]  your take on him I mean what did he ever say or do anything no matter fact he was
[1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:41.440]  a normal guy just like you or I not really outspoken I'll tell you what I
[1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:45.360]  have a hard time believing what the government's saying based by the fact
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:49.320]  that before he comes into the military he has to go through a full FBI
[1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:53.840]  investigation and if there was something amiss and they were concerned about it
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:58.600]  he wouldn't have gotten in it's ten times worse than that it turns out the
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:03.080]  FBI and CIA were reading all his email knew about this for a year but they
[1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:08.120]  won't release the details to Congress Congress who is the boss Congress who
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:12.360]  makes the laws Congress who is over the executive not co-equal first they said
[1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:16.080]  oh the executive judicial and legislative are all co-equal they said
[1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:20.000]  that the last 50 years then oh the executives over everything the
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:27.440]  executive is telling the Congress what to do the Pentagon is telling the
[1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:30.440]  Congress we're not gonna release this just like they won't release the full
[1:12:30.440 --> 1:12:35.480]  text of PDD 51 but the cover sheet of that presidential decision directive
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:42.400]  states that the president is a dictator so again this is all lawless they
[1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:47.160]  should release it all but they won't do it now if he was really all kind of why
[1:12:47.160 --> 1:12:51.280]  did they let him do this why wasn't he thrown out of the military hmm well
[1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:54.960]  here's something that's interesting when I was in the military they taught us
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:59.720]  them you know terrorist tactics or you know to watch out and one thing is they
[1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:03.720]  say terrorists like to hit soft targets and Walter Reed would have been a soft
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:07.520]  target that would have gotten tons of attention
[1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:18.080]  I didn't I'm just glad his light didn't go out when I was at work well I would
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:21.640]  love to believe the official story believe me it's a lot less scary you
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:24.200]  know there alone nuts out there than to think the government somehow was
[1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:28.680]  involved in this or let it happen but all the evidence points towards that and
[1:13:28.680 --> 1:13:31.720]  coming up near the end of the hour I'm gonna break it down anything else you
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:39.640]  can tell us about this person Chris um yeah one of his well actually he was a
[1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:44.280]  intern under a doctor who I know very well and he doesn't know what to make
[1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:48.800]  of it and I asked him does he really believe the official story and he just
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:52.640]  he shipped his head he said I don't know he says I find it hard to believe but
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:56.760]  he just he couldn't give a hundred percent for sure answer if he thought it
[1:13:56.760 --> 1:14:00.400]  was true or not I have a hard time swallowing the pill that the government
[1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:09.120]  wants me to defeat I mean heck if they miss inoculate 77 kids I mean hey well
[1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:12.520]  it's more than that they've been caught nationwide from New York to Kentucky
[1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:16.280]  forcibly injecting elementary students because they can't speak up for
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:19.200]  themselves they only do it to third and fourth and fifth graders and first
[1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:22.960]  graders and second graders they keep accidentally injecting them and then
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:27.840]  accidentally having the same story nationwide oh that it was an accident
[1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:33.160]  Chris I appreciate your call let's talk to Chris in Georgia Chris you're on the

[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:06.240]  recording of the like that record I like that recording and I hope you don't
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:10.800]  lose it but I'm Cynthia McKinney is problem is hold on I don't know what
[1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:14.880]  you're talking about Chris I mean did someone name an audio clip the longest
[1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:21.920]  day you have a wonderful recording of the longest day that Paul anchor wrote
[1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:30.360]  oh absolutely yes and I just that just inspired me every time but I was talking
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:35.120]  to Cynthia McKinney she was my Congress lady and she would like to come back on
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:38.600]  your show she wants to talk to you again you know here's the crazy thing
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:43.800]  every time I finally get her on she says I haven't heard from you I would love to
[1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:48.880]  come on your show and I can't get through her people I mean I cannot get her on
[1:15:48.880 --> 1:15:53.120]  for like two years and then every time I talk to people that know her she's like
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:59.880]  no I want to go on Alex's show so for the life of me I don't know how to get
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:04.480]  Cynthia McKinney on I mean do you ever contact info well yeah I've got her
[1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:10.680]  email I'll email her again but the real thing I called you about was it seems to
[1:16:10.680 --> 1:16:14.600]  me you suppose you could do a couple of shows couple episodes on like the
[1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:18.400]  mechanics of neighborhood organization what people are doing in their
[1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:21.960]  neighborhoods and they're at our city hall the kinds of how they're working
[1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:23.960]  with neighbors how do you deal with that
[1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:29.040]  psychology of trying to wake people up yeah well what the government does is
[1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:32.480]  they know the true powers at the local level so the feds come in with programs
[1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:37.640]  to create fake neighborhood and city and community organizations which push the
[1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:41.160]  globalist agenda we have to go in and show people how they're being
[1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:47.520]  manipulated and show them how they're made to be how they're made to feel
[1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:54.280]  important by the system and how they're being brainwashed but pick an issue like
[1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:58.760]  land grabbing or city funds going to illegals or cities trying to pass
[1:16:58.760 --> 1:17:05.880]  anti-gun laws and organize around those fronts you can organize neighborhoods on
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:10.720]  national issues as well and just get involved I mean I'm no master community
[1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:14.200]  organizer that's why the globalist chose Obama not just that he's smart and
[1:17:14.200 --> 1:17:18.280]  slick and well-spoken and can read a teleprompter well he is a master
[1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:23.520]  Annenberg Rockefeller Ford Foundation operative so with his his mother worked
[1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:30.880]  for a Geithner's father I mean he's been a foundation baby from birth he's been a
[1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:37.000]  globalist creature you know being groomed from the time he was a little
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:40.840]  boy that's what's so dangerous about Obama I mean he is the slickest thing
[1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:44.880]  we've seen he's New World Order all the way and again I spent all those years
[1:17:44.880 --> 1:17:49.720]  exposing Clinton exposing Bush's puppets but it's really hard to expose
[1:17:49.720 --> 1:17:53.120]  Obama because so many people drunk you know have gone under his spell drunk
[1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:57.480]  the Kool-Aid but his approval rating is plunging so that's a good thing it's not
[1:17:57.480 --> 1:18:02.600]  a good thing though if we just blame it all on Obama and but if we tear him down
[1:18:02.600 --> 1:18:06.240]  as a puppet and point out he's a liar and and gone back on almost all his
[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:09.800]  promises that's a good thing but but they mean to build him up and then tear
[1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:12.720]  him down and then move on to the next puppet we need to expose the whole
[1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:18.600]  puppet system itself I appreciate your call Chris Antoine in Georgia you're on
[1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:23.760]  the year hey how you doing Mr. Jones good Antoine hey well we know how you're

[1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:57.200]  they're turning red and stuttering they're not prepared well actually C-span's
[1:18:57.200 --> 1:19:03.040]  discussed cutting back their call shows I have been sent online clips of entire
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:08.360]  hour-long shows where 90 plus percent of the callers are calling in saying 9-11's
[1:19:08.360 --> 1:19:12.920]  an inside job and bringing up very serious points and it completely shuts
[1:19:12.920 --> 1:19:17.480]  down church off when he was on a month ago and others and you're right C-span
[1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:21.080]  is a great way to reach hundreds of thousands of people or millions total

[1:24:06.280 --> 1:24:10.480]  okay let's go back to Antoine and Georgia Antoine you had another point
[1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:14.320]  you wanted to make sir yeah well you know I just think that you know this
[1:24:14.320 --> 1:24:18.680]  Monday we should really just do a a C-spam blitz you know just to see these
[1:24:18.680 --> 1:24:22.680]  people turn red and start stuttering like if they're not prepared for our
[1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:27.560]  issues they're prepared for democratic issues and you know Republicans coming
[1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:31.600]  in you know talking they can rebuttal them all day but I really don't think
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:35.920]  that they can give us the type of rebuttals that they're trained to give
[1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:40.040]  that's a good point it's like a boxing commentator for Don King who already
[1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:44.000]  knows who's gonna win it's easy for them to call the punches when it's only
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  about Republicans and Democrats and they're desperate to keep it in those
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:52.040]  confines in that paradigm instead of going wait a minute there's more choices
[1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:59.320]  in this there's more going on than Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and Bonner and
[1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:04.520]  Obama and Newt Gingrich and all these people there's more going on than Fox
[1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:09.200]  News and CNN there's more than what you give us you're trying to limit the
[1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:13.600]  debate we want the bankers arrested we want the Federal Reserve abolished we
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:18.960]  don't want to cap and trade paid to Al Gore we want C-span to have a symposium
[1:25:18.960 --> 1:25:23.080]  with the 30 plus thousand scientists that have gone public saying man may
[1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:27.000]  global warming is a fraud and you can read the times a lot of times on C-span
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:31.560]  they randomly go live after a live event ends they will then cut back to the
[1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:35.960]  studio unannounced with a guest they have some set times Washington Journal in
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:40.400]  the morning seven days a week but you can look at their schedule everybody this
[1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:45.160]  weekend we're really doing a favor big audience tuning in to C-span and C-span
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:48.800]  is actually something good that goes on on television you learn a lot watching
[1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:52.440]  it it's some of the best TV there is out there there is a lot of diverse views
[1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:57.920]  but when they have those guest in it's almost entirely one-sided they do
[1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:02.120]  cover some anti-war groups they do cover some 9-11 groups they do cover some
[1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:05.400]  great authors so it's the best thing out there but that isn't saying much
[1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:11.000]  compared to what it's running up against we need to have everybody why wait why
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:15.880]  not have everybody there's no orders from headquarters here anybody who's off
[1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:20.800]  work tomorrow or works in the afternoon or evening Washington Journal what it
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:26.680]  goes for two hours from what six to eight is it eastern everybody tomorrow
[1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:30.440]  get up early in the morning get a cup of Joe sit down in front of the
[1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:35.160]  television to tune to C-span one or two forget I think it's on C-span one and
[1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:40.760]  hit them and hit them hard and they'll start screening the calls once they see
[1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:47.840]  that we take over but just weasel past them get on air and that's a great idea
[1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:53.120]  Antoine anything else yeah well let's just hit them with a bunch of fiat stuff
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:56.760]  you know asking about the fiat currency and that really gets them so you know if
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:27:00.120]  there's a kind of missed on then what do you think about the fiat currency but
[1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:03.040]  that's that's really all I had Alex I appreciate everything that you're doing
[1:27:03.040 --> 1:27:06.920]  and and I love the movie I'm making copies at least me God bless you Antoine
[1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:12.400]  all right let's talk to Dan in New Mexico Dan you're on the air go ahead my
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:20.000]  goodness Alex you are just your phenomenal I know you hate being
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:24.160]  complimented on but now look at look take a look at yourself in the mirror and
[1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:27.560]  look at how much stuff you know I saw I watched you the other day on President
[1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:32.720]  Planet TV come up with an article from back in 98-99 just off the top of your
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:38.520]  head I can hardly remember what I did yesterday but you thank him and you have
[1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:41.040]  really been touched by the old man upstairs and you're really touching a
[1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:45.000]  lot of other people well I do have you know we all have blessings we all have
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:49.640]  gifts and I do have gifts and I don't use them to the full potential I also have
[1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:52.840]  a lot of minuses you know we have our plus and minuses and I'm trying to use
[1:27:52.840 --> 1:27:57.800]  my gifts and but we all should use our gifts I mean a lot of people can remember
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:04.360]  a football play from the Super Bowl in 1997 so I'm just using the same part of
[1:28:04.360 --> 1:28:08.480]  my brain for real issues that the average person fills up with mindless
[1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:11.600]  clutter and I'm not saying you can't watch a ball game and eat a pizza and
[1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:16.000]  drink a cold one and spend time with your family I'm just saying that doesn't
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:21.280]  matter you should spend a lot more time on real issues every now again I got to
[1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:26.120]  take a break from fighting this NWO and go play video games or something but
[1:28:26.120 --> 1:28:30.440]  the reason I called you man is because I wanted to let you know that I'm here in
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:34.960]  Alamogordo, New Mexico I'm part of a group that's been started up down here
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:41.320]  called the Second Amendment Task Force that actually started in Alaska and has
[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:45.720]  spread down here just like we are change those type of groups could spread
[1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:49.000]  nationwide and take America back awesome tell me about it
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:55.440]  oh we are up in Alaska when I was a group up there the 4th of July parade we
[1:28:55.440 --> 1:29:00.160]  openly carried guns in the parade and my goodness Alex you should have seen the
[1:29:00.160 --> 1:29:05.800]  crowd go absolutely nuts people loved it I was carrying my AR in the in the
[1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:09.420]  crowd one guy out of the science says hey man is that thing a little about the
[1:29:09.420 --> 1:29:13.120]  clip and showed him he's like oh yeah people let me stop you let me stop you
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:16.840]  know why this is great they're engaged in pushback they're trying to act like
[1:29:16.840 --> 1:29:20.920]  guns or pornography and you got to you know put it in a black bag and hide it
[1:29:20.920 --> 1:29:26.260]  like it's bad and they're even taking dummy guns away from veterans for
[1:29:26.260 --> 1:29:29.800]  parades saying they can't have a gun in a parade even though it's legal and
[1:29:29.800 --> 1:29:33.680]  lawful the real guns you got to worry about of the hidden ones with criminals
[1:29:33.680 --> 1:29:38.560]  but by you guys going out and forcing firearms into plain view that pushes
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:42.640]  back so that people understand guns aren't dirty or illegal if you don't
[1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:46.760]  do what you're doing the cable guy comes to your house sees a gun case thinks
[1:29:46.760 --> 1:29:49.960]  guns are illegal calls the cops on you the media is trying to create the
[1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:54.200]  perception the guns are illegal stay there we're on the March the Empire's on

[1:33:50.360 --> 1:33:57.620]  boil down my take on what really happened with Major Nadal Malik Hasan at
[1:33:57.620 --> 1:34:03.080]  Fort Hood last Thursday and I haven't spoken a lot about this because I don't
[1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:06.960]  like to talk about something until I've had time to research it and look at it
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:11.800]  and let it stew in my mind I'm not like a lot of talk show hosts that will just
[1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:16.960]  tell you immediately what's going on and they have really no idea but I will
[1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:20.800]  tell you it doesn't look good right now also want to hit some important
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:23.600]  financial news here in a moment but first let's go back to Dan in New
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:28.920]  Mexico because I want to be clear about this for over a decade I've been all
[1:34:28.920 --> 1:34:34.360]  over the United States and I've seen photos of this in England and Germany
[1:34:34.360 --> 1:34:40.360]  and other places Australia where they put up big billboards that have an image
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:47.320]  of a revolver and it says report illegal guns get 5,000 10,000 there's
[1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:53.400]  generally a cash reward in tiny print if you stand right under the billboard as
[1:34:53.400 --> 1:34:58.560]  I saw one few years ago and took photos of it we posted at info wars.com I was in
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:02.080]  Galveston down at the beach with my family and they had one right by the
[1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:11.280]  galveston hotel big huge billboard right on boardwalk right on the main what's
[1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:15.760]  it called seawall road right on the main seawall and it showed an image of a
[1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:23.600]  revolver and it said report illegal guns get large rewards and under it in
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:28.160]  tiny print I mean I've got 2020 vision and standing 30 40 feet below it I had to
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:36.680]  focus to read you will be eligible if the individuals are convicted for
[1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:43.040]  committing crimes with guns but it said report illegal guns the fine print said
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:51.480]  report guns used in crimes now that's why nine years ago I had a carpet
[1:35:51.480 --> 1:35:54.880]  cleaner in my house back then I did my radio show out of a studio room and a
[1:35:54.880 --> 1:36:03.240]  bedroom in the house and I didn't have children then there was a loaded pump
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:20.400]  action Winchester black defender shotgun loaded in a gun rack up on the wall I
[1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:23.840]  love having children but I really love back in the days I guess have loaded
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:28.800]  guns all over the place now they're locked up instant access pistol safes
[1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:34.680]  the 45 357 mag the judge different rooms I just want to warn anybody because I
[1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:37.920]  know people said go to my house and kill me and stuff that's a popular thing on
[1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:42.560]  the internet well I'm not saying bring it on but you better watch your ass
[1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:46.680]  excuse me I apologize because if I catch you in my yard or trying to break in my
[1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:50.640]  house I will not hesitate you are going to die do you understand you understand
[1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:56.200]  me I will kill you I've got a strong survival instinct for my family and
[1:36:56.200 --> 1:37:02.400]  myself you understand side issue the point is this this guy sees it starts
[1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:06.920]  saying I'm not going to clean this room what's that shotgun doing he was a white
[1:37:06.920 --> 1:37:09.920]  guy he had a Hispanic assistant that's how the carpet cleaner place worked
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:15.840]  because I've worked for him actually in college and I say no guns are legal he
[1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:18.960]  said I'm still not going in there I said I know it's a black gun and looks
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:23.280]  scary but it's not scary I assure you it's legal and he starts freaking out and
[1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:25.520]  I said look here I am in the front page of the paper I've just been at a gun
[1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:29.280]  rally and I was on the front page of the metro and state we were I'd caught
[1:37:29.280 --> 1:37:32.800]  bribery at the Capitol and I was in the paper for that on video it was pretty
[1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:36.320]  famous made it all over national news and I said see I'm Alex Jones I mean it's
[1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:41.560]  not illegal he leaves I call the office they go no he didn't call the police on
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:44.800]  you he didn't understand the law but yes we almost call the police on you but
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:47.400]  we're going to do you a favor we're not going to call the police this time then
[1:37:47.400 --> 1:37:52.160]  I'm on access TV that night his helper calls in and says yeah I argued with him
[1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:57.400]  and got fired they did call the police on you but they didn't come now that's
[1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:00.920]  American I know I've told that story 50 times probably I tell it because you're
[1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:05.680]  in danger ladies and gentlemen most people watch sitcoms and dramas and NYPD
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:11.440]  blue and LA law and all this stuff based in New York where in the make believe
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:16.520]  world no guns are legal and so they are ignorant and think your guns are illegal
[1:38:16.520 --> 1:38:20.400]  all right I said I'd get to the what happened at Fort Hood but but the issue
[1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:26.560]  here is they are teaching everyone guns are illegal
[1:38:27.560 --> 1:38:38.880]  they are teaching everyone that they're already banned that's a foregone
[1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:45.480]  conclusion and by folks nationwide from New Hampshire to Vermont from Texas to
[1:38:45.480 --> 1:38:52.680]  Arizona New Mexico California carrying guns out in the open you know I didn't
[1:38:52.680 --> 1:38:59.240]  like one of the leaders the Black Panthers he's dead now what's his name I
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:04.640]  forget his name the point is he he had a march with loaded shotguns in Houston and
[1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:09.800]  the police stood down because that was the Second Amendment right and as much
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:14.080]  as I didn't like that racist guy most Black Panthers really aren't racist that
[1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:18.120]  fellow was what was his name he did the famous speech that you debate with
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:20.920]  Anthony Hilder where he said you have to kill all the white women and all the
[1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:30.160]  white babies because the white woman is the military manufacturing center the
[1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:33.800]  issue is though you've got to really worry about the people that have guns
[1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:38.400]  hidden that's why under common law and openly bared arms that's why it's keep
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:43.440]  and bear you have to show your arms what's illegal is hiding them it is
[1:39:43.440 --> 1:39:48.160]  illegal under common law and illegal under the Constitution and we want to
[1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:52.000]  repeal that that's fine and but the point is it's hidden weapons that are
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:55.440]  illegal we're supposed to be a culture where you bear arms openly and that's a
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:40:00.440]  very secure society all right briefly going back to Dan in New Mexico Dan go
[1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:07.040]  ahead I just wanted to comment on your your black illegal shotgun you have I
[1:40:07.040 --> 1:40:11.320]  got the same thing sitting right next to my bed and I also have guns hidden all
[1:40:11.320 --> 1:40:16.520]  around my house so you know it's not a people don't understand even even right
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:19.600]  now with our group people are like oh my gosh you can open a carry guys yeah
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:24.080]  we're an open carry state but that's the whole point of the group is to get
[1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:28.280]  people educated about what the second amendment means it's true meaning and
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:34.480]  purpose and we also do things like open carry events where we just pick a day and
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:39.360]  openly carry now when safer Cox did the same thing up in Fairbanks Alaska he
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:44.680]  had two different banks of Walmart call him the first bank was nervous and he
[1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:47.640]  really know why he was they were calling him but the second one was ecstatic and
[1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:51.680]  loved it because the manager told him that he'd never felt more safe in his
[1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:57.920]  bank than he did that day Walmart was ecstatic the manager of the place was
[1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:02.120]  so happy about it he took pictures of it sent to corporate Walmart asking for
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:06.080]  permission for the employees to take part in it but you gotta realize Alaska is
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:09.360]  a little bit different there they're they're they're very very very sick and
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:14.560]  they got grizzly bears and polar bears and wolves and everything else they got
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:18.920]  to deal with and we're trying we're gonna we're gonna do another parade down
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:24.720]  here in El Magordo Christmas Day parade openly carrying in we're gonna adopt a
[1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:28.200]  highway where we probably open openly carry and go out pick up the trash we
[1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:31.760]  want to be a positive light in the community and we'd also like to see this
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:38.720]  spread nationwide more it's in Montana and Florida as well but you just go to
[1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:47.280]  either anchorage to ATF.org or go to El Magordo to ATF.org hook up some or pick
[1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:51.600]  a person to talk to and we'll help spread the word good job my friend I got a
[1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:56.880]  jump but great job you're saving this country it's that type of action that's
[1:41:56.880 --> 1:42:00.640]  unstoppable at the grassroots level okay I want to get into the Fort Hood
[1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:02.760]  shooting and break down what I really think is happening but I want to bring
[1:42:02.760 --> 1:42:07.160]  Ted Anderson briefly on for Midas Resources the parent company of the GCN
[1:42:07.160 --> 1:42:11.720]  radio network I've known Ted for 13 years I have syndicated through him for
[1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:18.200]  12 he has been a great supporter of myself Ron Paul but the reason I buy my
[1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:22.240]  gold and silver from Ted Anderson is he has the best prices when he has these
[1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:26.080]  special offers he always has great prices very competitive but the the deals
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:32.600]  he's giving you today are bar none off the chart good and gold is up again today
[1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:45.480]  it's up $7.60 to $1,113 and change this is so exciting what is happening
[1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:50.840]  right now and I just want to encourage everybody to take advantage of today's
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:54.600]  gold offer because he was offering even better deals a few weeks ago but this
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:42:59.720]  deal is about to go and there'll be more and all the smart monies on gold and
[1:42:59.720 --> 1:43:04.320]  silver Ted Anderson yeah thanks for having me up Alex if anybody looks at
[1:43:04.320 --> 1:43:07.760]  money and investing in the Wall Street Journal today they'll see that there's a
[1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:13.360]  headline article right on the very front page central boy banks join the new
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:17.320]  gold rush and there's a big long list of all the central banks that are buying
[1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:21.800]  gold and if the people that are making the money I mean I mean manufacturing the
[1:43:21.800 --> 1:43:26.680]  money creating it think that you should have gold what do you think the regular
[1:43:26.680 --> 1:43:30.120]  people in the world should be doing when they have to spend their currency as
[1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:34.120]  their as their resource for their own wealth you should be getting into gold
[1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:38.480]  there's I mean there's just absolutely very few reasons or very few arguments
[1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:43.200]  that even hold water anymore as to why you should stay away from it it is again
[1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:50.280]  like you said running today it's been as high as 1,000 and night $1,119 the
[1:43:50.280 --> 1:43:54.880]  British sovereigns Frank's walking liberties the Lakota coins the Eagles
[1:43:54.880 --> 1:43:59.680]  the Maple Leafs the you know you name it the Buffalo coins all that stuff is
[1:43:59.680 --> 1:44:05.120]  going up in value if you can get them I've constantly hearing from my my
[1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:09.720]  associates here my brokers that they're saying that people are stopping into the
[1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:13.800]  local shops now and again it's like it was a couple years ago there's nothing
[1:44:13.800 --> 1:44:18.440]  left in inventory for people to buy I just think that's sad and unfortunate but
[1:44:18.440 --> 1:44:23.560]  people will will and should and better be acting fast and getting away from the
[1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:28.120]  fiat currency like your caller had just said earlier get away from that fiat
[1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:33.320]  currency and get into gold right now the Franks are at 246 I I mean my
[1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:37.040]  inventory is not gonna last long gold's up again it's gonna be higher British
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:41.720]  sovereigns are at 299 I mean I price those Alex and they're close to 200 or
[1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:47.920]  330 bucks if I just take them in today's market at today's prices you know and I
[1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:52.560]  am wishing I'm hoping to get a lower price to buy again yeah let's be clear
[1:44:52.560 --> 1:44:57.520]  even though you're buying a giant bulk you couldn't buy these coins for what
[1:44:57.520 --> 1:45:01.840]  you're selling them to people for no because coins the premium on on physical
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:06.280]  gold coins is going up like crazy every dealer in the United States right now is
[1:45:06.280 --> 1:45:10.680]  competing for a finite supply there's just not there is not enough being
[1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:14.560]  manufactured to meet the demand and that's why people who are stopping into
[1:45:14.560 --> 1:45:19.360]  the local jewelry stores and coin shops aren't finding coins because the little
[1:45:19.360 --> 1:45:23.080]  bit that they had an inventory is gone now and their coin dealers are out there
[1:45:23.080 --> 1:45:27.160]  trying to buy more and they're trying to compete with you know other buyers and
[1:45:27.160 --> 1:45:30.760]  they're just isn't enough to go around and that's unfortunate and I do have a
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:34.600]  lot of buying power and when the market dips and everybody's stepping away from
[1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:38.240]  the marketplace you know I'm not an idiot I'm gonna go in and buy as much as I
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:41.480]  can at that time well Ted let's rewind to the Wall Street Journal I happen to
[1:45:41.480 --> 1:45:46.600]  have the article in front of me central banks are taking taxpayer bailout fiat
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:50.640]  money but it's real money because we got to pay for it in taxes that's what the
[1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:54.920]  health care scam is just a new tax they want to take 2.5 to 5% out of your
[1:45:54.920 --> 1:45:58.760]  check and make you buy insurance and put you in prison for five years if you
[1:45:58.760 --> 1:46:02.600]  don't get it and a quarter million dollar fine that's in the bell and they're
[1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:06.960]  marking it up November 17th they're gonna try to pass it November 17th I'm
[1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:10.280]  sorry to go off into that subject it's just we are in deep trouble they're gonna
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:14.800]  try to pass cap and trade right around that same period it's past the house all
[1:46:14.800 --> 1:46:18.640]  it's got to do is pass the Senate they have the razor blade the butcher knife
[1:46:18.640 --> 1:46:25.480]  razor sharp to our jugular to our carotid arteries right now and you know
[1:46:25.480 --> 1:46:29.400]  with all these horrible things happening at least we can do what the big boys are
[1:46:29.400 --> 1:46:33.040]  doing just on a smaller scale and get into gold and silver because they're
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:39.040]  taking our bailout money and they the central banks are buying gold now in the
[1:46:39.040 --> 1:46:42.560]  past they sold it to try to keep the price down amongst themselves in a
[1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:47.200]  manipulation that's not happening what was it 400 plus billion was dumped on
[1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:54.680]  the market and one country bought what to half of that India did they didn't
[1:46:54.680 --> 1:46:58.320]  think that they didn't think folks were gonna do that two weeks ago a week and
[1:46:58.320 --> 1:47:02.280]  a half ago trying to drive down the price now the yuppies are beginning to
[1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:06.880]  pile on now the mainline taught TV hosts are saying it's gonna go above 2000 I
[1:47:06.880 --> 1:47:11.280]  don't know if that's gonna happen I just said a year ago was gonna go about a
[1:47:11.280 --> 1:47:16.000]  thousand and was gonna climb we're now could easily by the end of the year see
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:22.320]  1200 or even higher the issue here is you need to get involved these are great
[1:47:22.320 --> 1:47:27.360]  deals on bullion prices of gold but these aren't just bullying these are
[1:47:27.360 --> 1:47:31.000]  collectible or semi-collectible coins some of these coins that I've gotten
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:35.240]  from Ted when I buy a few francs for a few sovereigns you know these are 1888
[1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:39.840]  Ted am I correct because my red book says they are a collectible coin how are
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:43.680]  you selling them then at bullion price well like you know like I said I use my
[1:47:43.680 --> 1:47:48.400]  purchasing power a lot of them I have to import from Europe those coins go well
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:54.080]  back into the 1800s and and for a lot of definition that they do hold a new
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:57.760]  mismanic premium or would be considered something that would be a non
[1:47:57.760 --> 1:48:02.840]  confiscatable but the main thing is is it if you haven't locked in in your gold
[1:48:02.840 --> 1:48:07.880]  and silver investments even just three days ago you're losing money today
[1:48:07.880 --> 1:48:12.000]  because you'll pay a lot more for it and that's just the way that it is it by
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:16.160]  waiting and thinking that you can put off purchasing gold and silver it is
[1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:20.000]  costing you a tremendous amount of money if you hadn't done it in the last six
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:25.400]  months you've already lost about 25% of your purchasing power against gold and
[1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:28.800]  silver I mean I don't know how to make it more clear than this for you the
[1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:33.240]  market is moving up the dollar is moving down the government's trying to bail out
[1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:36.400]  its problems by printing more money what do you think is going to happen in the
[1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:40.760]  future I mean we've increased our money supply by two to one there are two
[1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:44.520]  dollars now to buy it what it used to take with what there used to be one in
[1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:47.800]  the marketplace what do you think the cost of items are going to you know it's
[1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:51.120]  going to drive the price up or realistically speaking we're gonna
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:55.240]  lose 50% of our purchasing power Ted I know you don't have a crystal ball and
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:49:02.960]  and there are mainline analysts on CNBC MSNBC CNN saying $7,000 gold in the
[1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:06.160]  next two years I don't believe that's going to happen none of us have a
[1:49:06.160 --> 1:49:11.600]  crystal ball but 30 years in gold and silver what do you really and I said
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:14.440]  this is not a prediction it's what you think where do you think gold will be
[1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:19.120]  next fall well by next fall we'll probably be poking through that $2,000
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:25.520]  range you know $1,200 an ounce before the end of the year probably 1,300 I mean
[1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:31.120]  I'm just watching what's going on it broke through that 1,110 and then I
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:35.080]  thought okay it might back off if it's acting like it has been in the past maybe
[1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:39.480]  we'll see one you know 1,099 or something like that and we'll
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:42.920]  dibble in that level and then we'll go over this 1,010 it didn't even budge
[1:49:42.920 --> 1:49:48.440]  when India stepped in and bought that 200 metric tons of gold here just recently
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:52.800]  that the IMF was threatening to sell 400 metric tons it was just like the world
[1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:57.160]  banks and the we're just deciding you know what this is it this is the last
[1:49:57.160 --> 1:50:01.520]  straw we're gonna exactly they tried to drive it down the bluff blew up in their
[1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:07.360]  face India took the pot it looks like game over it looks like the beginning of
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:10.840]  the end of the dollar I really hope gold goes down and this all stops but
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:15.440]  because I know what this means but this is really bad news but it's good news
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:19.280]  if you're in gold and so it's it's kind of the best of times and the worst of
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:23.360]  times here's the toll-free number the brokers are there no pressure you just
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:26.440]  tell them it's the Alex Jones special you get it you get out they got high

[1:54:21.880 --> 1:54:34.080]  tenpenny in studio coming up in about 40 minutes army major witnesses say he is
[1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:46.200]  the shooter what's really going on with major Nadal Malik Hassan well let's
[1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:51.480]  look at the circumstances let's look at what developed last Thursday at
[1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:59.000]  approximately 130 central time inside the largest military base in the world
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:03.680]  fordhood Texas a giant sprawling army base six times the size of Dallas
[1:55:03.680 --> 1:55:08.280]  geographically 340 square miles plus that's just the main base it has several
[1:55:08.280 --> 1:55:21.040]  auxiliary spurs this individual reportedly allegedly kills 13 people and
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:35.240]  wounds 30 plus they tell us for at least six hours that he was killed then they
[1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:40.440]  tell us he's alive then he's in a coma now he's speaking they report for hour
[1:55:40.440 --> 1:55:44.160]  after hour and governor Rick Perry reports that there were three shooters
[1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:54.680]  other people in custody but that could just be fog of war then we learn that he
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:56:00.440]  is a psychiatrist we learned that he's an Arab and I said on Arab it turns out
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:05.160]  to be an Arab the little the the the mercury rises towards this being a
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:10.520]  staged event I said if he's been involved in the psychiatric system it
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:16.480]  explodes they just executed mr. Muhammad last night and without going over the
[1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:21.840]  entire Beltway sniper story again that was clearly staged witnesses saw white
[1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:27.160]  men white vans black men Hispanic men white vans witness after witness saw
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:32.000]  them shooting people from the open backs of white vans not the vehicle he was
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:38.200]  caught in it turns out he was in the army involved in psychiatric operations
[1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:42.400]  had emails connected to the National Security Council I could go on and on
[1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:46.280]  with that subject it's just like Columbine the way the media jumped on it
[1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:49.440]  made a huge spectacle out of it when there have been a lot of other big mass
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:55.320]  shootings it bases the last few years from post-traumatic stress disorder when
[1:56:55.320 --> 1:56:58.880]  I went on press TV Thursday night just hours after it happened I said it could
[1:56:58.880 --> 1:57:02.480]  be a Muslim extremist it could be post-traumatic stress disorder he could
[1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:06.640]  be mentally ill he could have been on Prozac most of the mass shooters have
[1:57:06.640 --> 1:57:09.800]  been on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor the drug inserted myths it could cause
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:16.040]  psychotic breaks and violent outburst I didn't know I just laid out the
[1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:21.880]  different scenarios we didn't know people now go get that video from press TV
[1:57:21.880 --> 1:57:26.120]  and say I did it yesterday and say I'm saying it could be post-traumatic stress
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:30.960]  today you know days after we know that he was never in combat though I would
[1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:34.920]  imagine it was stressful for years interviewing people who had seen all
[1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:41.160]  that carnage then enters all the other evidence congressional request for
[1:57:41.160 --> 1:57:48.800]  information from CIA on Hassan refused under national security ABC news US
[1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:52.840]  intelligence agencies were aware months ago that army major Nadal Malik
[1:57:52.840 --> 1:57:57.040]  Hassan was attempting to make contact with people associated with al-Qaeda he
[1:57:57.040 --> 1:58:01.760]  was really making contact with the CIA and FBI who do you think al-Qaeda is two
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:08.880]  American officials briefed on classified material in the case told ABC news
[1:58:10.080 --> 1:58:16.240]  they knew specifically that this guy was making contact with imams who were
[1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:20.400]  calling for mass murder and calling for troops on US bases in and out of the
[1:58:20.400 --> 1:58:27.520]  homeland to carry out attacks so they are now absolute accomplices if I knew my
[1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:31.720]  neighbor was going to kill his wife a month before he did it and I didn't call
[1:58:31.720 --> 1:58:36.280]  the police I would certainly be an accomplice back in 70 seconds I'll
[1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:40.040]  continue to get into the heart of the matter
[1:58:40.840 --> 1:58:46.200]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a
[1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:52.840]  decade we are the GCN radio network hey folks this is Alex Jones and I want to

[2:00:05.080 --> 2:00:12.840]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:20.400]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:20.400 --> 2:00:28.240]  Alex Jones we are back live now we've passed the waypoint halfway there two
[2:00:28.240 --> 2:00:34.480]  more hours straight ahead of key information continuing with major
[2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:43.040]  Nadal Malik Hassan in the massacre at Fort Hood so we have all these conflicting
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:47.080]  stories it comes out that officials were aware of Hassan's efforts to contact
[2:00:47.080 --> 2:00:51.880]  and make contact with al-Qaeda now they're saying he's linked to the
[2:00:51.880 --> 2:00:57.240]  September 11th terrorist funny they were all trained at US bases that's been in
[2:00:57.240 --> 2:01:00.200]  the Associated Press but they go oh we don't know why they were trained in spy
[2:01:00.200 --> 2:01:04.720]  training at US bases Muhammad out of all of them see we forget about all of this
[2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:14.120]  these are facts you can't ignore and then we go back to the fact that the LA
[2:01:14.120 --> 2:01:18.160]  Times and other major newspapers reported at the time that the unabomber
[2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:27.080]  was caught that Theodore Kaczynski had volunteered for MK ultra CIA mind control
[2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:33.120]  program while attending an Ivy League school getting his PhD that is on record
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:39.280]  Alexander Cockburn Los Angeles Times and other publications on record Tim
[2:01:39.280 --> 2:01:44.800]  McVay taken into black ops caught by the state police drooling on the side of
[2:01:44.800 --> 2:01:47.880]  the road saying I've got a chip in me help me help me whether it was a
[2:01:47.880 --> 2:01:53.840]  psychological trigger term we don't know then his head doctor from the time he's
[2:01:53.840 --> 2:01:57.400]  arrested the time he's executed at Terre Hood Indiana right through the Denver
[2:01:57.400 --> 2:02:02.120]  trial there was execution dr. Jolly and West is was the head MK ultra doctor
[2:02:02.120 --> 2:02:09.200]  along with dr. Ewing Cameron this is on record the head MK ultra doctor one of
[2:02:09.200 --> 2:02:13.760]  the fathers of MK ultra mind control is his doctor until the day he's executed
[2:02:13.760 --> 2:02:19.400]  spending days with him every week we did TV interviews clearly drugged out of his
[2:02:19.400 --> 2:02:25.480]  gourd I mean how do you ignore this these are facts these are not conspiracy
[2:02:25.480 --> 2:02:32.680]  theories this is not conjecture this is not our opinion then we look at the
[2:02:32.680 --> 2:02:40.760]  supposed for hood shooter and he may be the shooter Nadal Malik Hassan an army
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:45.840]  psychiatrist that's where they grab you that's where they get you that's where
[2:02:45.840 --> 2:02:54.120]  they drug you that's where they program you so either way you slice it the CIA
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:03:00.800]  and FBI knew he was contacting Al Qaeda fronts that they run and they let him do
[2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:07.600]  it that's bare minimum then on every point and every issue the media hype the
[2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:12.320]  way they were ready day one the way it was pushed the way it was tied to
[2:03:12.320 --> 2:03:16.000]  September 11th the way they're connecting into 9-11 truthers now they
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:19.840]  have a known CIA operative editor of the Washington Times come out with a hit
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:25.040]  piece right as Obama's announcing a 40,000 troop increase oh it makes us
[2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:27.680]  feel sorry for the military and makes it sound like it's good for the military
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:32.760]  to expand these wars when it's not it's not good for our budget it's not good
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:36.640]  for anything except for opium dealers and the 500 billion a year coming out of
[2:03:36.640 --> 2:03:42.040]  that country they can leverage to five trill it comes out right after the FBI's
[2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:46.360]  caught cooking bombs training drivers finding mentally ill unstable people to
[2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:51.240]  agree to drive the trucks to bomb buildings in Illinois and other parts of
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:55.000]  the US comes out later those were staged provocateur so you have real
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:58.600]  terrorist you have provocateur terrorist you have totally staged events we
[2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:03.680]  don't know what this event really was but the secrecy surrounding it all the
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:07.480]  conflicting stories now they're saying it doesn't look like this female cop is
[2:04:07.480 --> 2:04:10.240]  really the main person that took this guy down but she was involved she is a
[2:04:10.240 --> 2:04:14.880]  hero but it was a male cop just like with Jessica Lynch they lied and said
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:17.920]  she took on the Iraqis when it was somebody else when people in her unit
[2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:21.040]  spoke out they all got double tapped in the head four people killed in one
[2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:26.960]  month back in the US turned out that was all a hoax she had to go public and say
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:31.520]  it was a hoax and the army told her to lie back Tillman was killed it's come
[2:04:31.520 --> 2:04:34.240]  out they killed him because he was writing letters back planning to go
[2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:39.280]  public about opium dealing and the war being a fraud they can't have their
[2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:47.120]  poster boys go sideways on them this thing stinks to I have and we'll talk
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:52.080]  more about it later but I want to get into some other issues on the other side

[2:08:20.920 --> 2:08:28.320]  Alex Jones
[2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:33.600]  we are now simulcasting the syndicated radio broadcast at prisonplanet.tv
[2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:38.280]  Dr. Sherry Timpinney is coming up later in the hour into the next hour to break
[2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:41.840]  down what's happening with the flu and oculations and fresh off two debates she's
[2:08:41.840 --> 2:08:50.880]  had here in Austin visiting with us from her home state of Pennsylvania coming
[2:08:50.880 --> 2:08:56.400]  up I'm going to be playing a video clip Fox admits to planting political
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:04.480]  brainwashing in popular TV shows this is an article written by Paul Watson back
[2:09:04.480 --> 2:09:14.760]  in March of this year 2009 news core put out a video where they brag that they're
[2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:21.720]  pushing global warming propaganda separately though in a few of news
[2:09:21.720 --> 2:09:25.640]  course holdings they are always claiming their anti-manmade global warming and
[2:09:25.640 --> 2:09:30.240]  believe it's a hoax but then at key points these neocon publications come
[2:09:30.240 --> 2:09:42.800]  out and announce to everyone that don't worry the legislation isn't going to
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:46.240]  pass that they told us that the health care legislation the government take
[2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:50.360]  takeover of Obamacare wasn't going to pass the house it passed they told us
[2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:55.120]  don't worry cap and trade attacks every facet of your life federal control no
[2:09:55.120 --> 2:10:02.360]  judicial review taxes on all energy taxes on meat taxes on farms don't worry
[2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:06.280]  that's not going to pass the house it passed and I've seen a bunch of articles
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:10.680]  put out by the New York Post that Rupert Murdoch owns Fox News you name it
[2:10:10.680 --> 2:10:16.080]  British newspapers he owns Australian papers he owns saying don't worry it's
[2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:21.400]  not gonna pass and in foreign papers he's pushing that it's real and that we
[2:10:21.400 --> 2:10:25.520]  need it but to get us to stand down and not think that there's a threat he's
[2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:31.680]  telling us it's not gonna pass well the problem with that is Harry Reid the head
[2:10:31.680 --> 2:10:38.480]  of the Senate has put health care bill on Senate calendar he's followed the
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:42.760]  motion introduced the bill on Monday November 16th
[2:10:43.520 --> 2:10:47.120]  anticipating a Republican objection the bill will be pushed onto the Senate
[2:10:47.120 --> 2:10:56.080]  calendar forced by him and so they are going to attempt to pass this the 17th
[2:10:56.080 --> 2:11:02.240]  18th and 19th of this month we are only talking about six days away that they
[2:11:02.240 --> 2:11:06.160]  are going to launch this out of committee and they're also talking about
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:10.840]  simultaneously in a week or two weeks trying to pass it's already passed the
[2:11:10.840 --> 2:11:17.280]  house all this has passed the house it passes the Senate if it passes the
[2:11:17.280 --> 2:11:22.680]  Senate it's done and the neocons are saying all over radio all over TV don't
[2:11:22.680 --> 2:11:26.240]  worry we've won and they're telling everybody to stand down a month ago
[2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:32.360]  Schwarzenegger came out and said I'm not gonna sign the bill in California making
[2:11:32.360 --> 2:11:36.320]  you thumb print and register to buy ammo and I told everybody I said he's
[2:11:36.320 --> 2:11:40.080]  anti-gun he's gonna sign the bill next week he signed it he didn't want
[2:11:40.080 --> 2:11:44.000]  opposition and he knows that people are barely paying attention to media so they
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:48.680]  hear that oh Schwarzenegger said he wasn't for that but then he signs it
[2:11:48.680 --> 2:11:53.560]  they're manipulating you it they're going off the same playbook there is a
[2:11:53.560 --> 2:11:59.120]  very good chance that all of this is going to pass and somehow we've got to
[2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:03.480]  get the word out grassroots to call the Senate to call all the senators that are
[2:12:03.480 --> 2:12:06.840]  on the fence about this to call the couple of Democrats that are on the
[2:12:06.840 --> 2:12:10.520]  fence and some of the Republicans that are on the fence because they will have
[2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:15.920]  a narrow victory right now they've got maybe one or two votes over what they
[2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:20.200]  need if we can take three votes away they're gonna lose because even with the
[2:12:20.200 --> 2:12:26.400]  vice president pushing it over giving them that extra vote they need the the
[2:12:26.400 --> 2:12:31.920]  vice president can be a tiebreaker if we get three votes right now we can beat
[2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:35.280]  this and and ladies and gentlemen this is so important this is economic warfare
[2:12:35.280 --> 2:12:40.760]  against our country we have got to beat this and here is a clip put out by Fox
[2:12:40.760 --> 2:12:43.480]  themselves there's a bunch of other clips that people put together showing
[2:12:43.480 --> 2:12:49.080]  what they're doing from Fox TV Fox movies where Rupert Murdoch is bragging
[2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:53.120]  that he's trying to manipulate the news he said last year at Davos he's trying
[2:12:53.120 --> 2:12:59.520]  to manipulate people so all of his holdings the TV the movies are pushing
[2:12:59.520 --> 2:13:03.880]  it's good except for Fox News they're saying it's bad but don't worry we beat
[2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:08.960]  it this is why having a Judas Goat in amongst us is so important at key times
[2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:13.320]  Rupert Murdoch has spent tens of millions of his own money pushing this
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:17.680]  global carbon tax that will give an elite group of bankers total control over
[2:13:17.680 --> 2:13:21.680]  our economy let's go ahead and go to this clip
[2:13:21.680 --> 2:13:28.640]  I want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no
[2:13:28.640 --> 2:13:32.080]  matter what the size of your carbon footprint is you can make a difference
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:37.400]  how to stay for long record global warming probably press button to see
[2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:42.120]  what global warming will do in the next three years
[2:13:42.120 --> 2:13:48.560]  three years is a long ways away what could we do on a practical level to start
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:54.480]  making a difference just had another thought what if the Scared Spray show
[2:13:54.480 --> 2:14:00.280]  had a green message to the biggest thing we've done you know what stop it back
[2:14:00.280 --> 2:14:04.120]  up to the start you know I meant to play this and not comment but I have to this
[2:14:04.120 --> 2:14:08.120]  was put out in 2006 we wrote about it in March of this year and they put out
[2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:15.200]  other promos news court put this out that they want you to know and the NFL
[2:14:15.200 --> 2:14:18.440]  says it's real all the big hype machines are telling you global warming
[2:14:18.440 --> 2:14:23.480]  real in 2006 they were saying the earth will flood in New York everyone will
[2:14:23.480 --> 2:14:29.080]  die the Simpsons in three years see they had it timed up to 2009 they meant to
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:32.400]  pass it they've been saying this for many years this is the year they want to
[2:14:32.400 --> 2:14:36.480]  ram it all through so again for radio listeners that are just listening you
[2:14:36.480 --> 2:14:45.720]  can go to prisonplanet.com or info wars.com and you can go to the story if
[2:14:45.720 --> 2:14:49.280]  you want to watch this video clip Fox admits to planting political brainwashing
[2:14:49.280 --> 2:14:53.640]  and popular TV shows go there and watch it it's even more powerful but again
[2:14:53.640 --> 2:14:58.000]  these are TV shows and media clips with implanted messages Rupert Murdoch is
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:02.040]  bragging that he's brainwashing people and we have clips of him as well
[2:15:02.040 --> 2:15:06.280]  separately at news core press conferences admitting this but here it is
[2:15:06.280 --> 2:15:11.440]  I'm not going to stop at this time from the start this is your champion Fox
[2:15:11.440 --> 2:15:18.680]  news core the Conservatives stabbing you in the back here it is
[2:15:22.520 --> 2:15:29.040]  want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no
[2:15:29.040 --> 2:15:32.480]  matter what the size of your carbon footprint is you can make a difference
[2:15:32.480 --> 2:15:37.840]  how to stay for long record global warming probably press button to see
[2:15:37.840 --> 2:15:42.400]  what global warming will do in the next three years
[2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:49.000]  three years is a long ways away what could we do on a practical level to start
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:54.880]  making a difference just had another thought what if the scared straight show
[2:15:54.880 --> 2:16:00.120]  had a green message to the biggest thing we've done is inserting messages about
[2:16:00.120 --> 2:16:06.760]  the environment into some of our content I don't follow green it means
[2:16:06.760 --> 2:16:11.320]  environmentally friendly the light blood of our company is a quality of our TV
[2:16:11.320 --> 2:16:16.320]  shows and we would accomplish nothing if we compromise that quality going green
[2:16:16.320 --> 2:16:21.600]  doesn't fit with the rest of the show working magic make it fit hey Brian I'm
[2:16:21.600 --> 2:16:27.400]  not gonna recycle this aluminum can I'm just gonna throw it in the trash your
[2:16:27.400 --> 2:16:33.800]  earth's bitch the most powerful way that we could communicate the commitment on
[2:16:33.800 --> 2:16:40.400]  behalf of our company was to change the practices within the production as well
[2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:45.920]  as work in a message about global warming about environmental changes and
[2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:51.120]  about empowering people to take responsibility why are your wedding
[2:16:51.120 --> 2:16:58.160]  programs bumpy seats we're having a green wedding so after the reception our
[2:16:58.160 --> 2:17:04.360]  guests can plant the programs real loud I could live in the sea I make friends
[2:17:04.360 --> 2:17:08.720]  with the whale we live in a sunken pirate ship that'd show global warming
[2:17:08.720 --> 2:17:13.360]  we've come up with you know all sorts of strategies for lessening our footprint
[2:17:13.360 --> 2:17:19.320]  everything from utilizing hybrid vehicles in in on our production look
[2:17:19.320 --> 2:17:24.760]  at all these hummers what kind of jerk would drive one of those do this car
[2:17:24.760 --> 2:17:34.520]  kicks ass we're using biodiesel fuel and our generators instead of regular diesel
[2:17:34.520 --> 2:17:44.360]  no car no electricity company we're now frequently getting scripts
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:48.760]  electronically fluorescent bulbs that use less electricity reusable hemp bags
[2:17:48.760 --> 2:17:53.280]  for shopping shampoo that's not tested on animals I feel bad for those lab
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:57.400]  animals running around with dirty hair but better for the environment that's a
[2:17:57.400 --> 2:18:02.160]  sacrifice they have to make here at 24 we are committed to reducing our impact
[2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:06.840]  on climate change and we know that we can't solve this problem in 24 hours but
[2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:10.800]  by making energy conscious decisions on our set we are contributing to a
[2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:15.520]  solution galvanizing that kind of an effort with as many people as it has
[2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:20.400]  taken to get on board and and sort of help us with this effort it hasn't been
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:25.280]  difficult on the contrary it's been rewarding and people have acted swiftly
[2:18:25.280 --> 2:18:29.880]  and enthusiastically he's powering the blender the wheel rim is attached to
[2:18:29.880 --> 2:18:35.040]  generator this is rather ingenious stay fit and save energy everyone should do
[2:18:35.040 --> 2:18:39.920]  I'm sure he'll catch on mr. McKay says that history is past but saving the
[2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:46.880]  earth is our present to the future oh the fact that this company decided to get
[2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:52.360]  behind the the move to to try to bring an end to global warming that was really
[2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:56.680]  gratifying finally I get to save the earth with deadly lasers instead of
[2:18:56.680 --> 2:18:59.680]  deadly slideshows
[2:19:02.200 --> 2:19:08.880]  oh isn't that sweet now every other major corporation is all behind this
[2:19:08.880 --> 2:19:12.440]  because they're owned by the private central banks that you will openly pay
[2:19:12.440 --> 2:19:17.000]  taxes on thousands of products directly to them but more importantly
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:21.720]  unelected boards will be able to shut down any businesses any corporations the
[2:19:21.720 --> 2:19:25.680]  power to taxes the power to destroy we have the carbon tax bill we have the
[2:19:25.680 --> 2:19:31.320]  carbon tax treaty it gives unlimited dictatorial power to unelected private
[2:19:31.320 --> 2:19:37.200]  groups like the WTO the IMF the World Bank Al Gore is your heroes saving the
[2:19:37.200 --> 2:19:40.720]  earth already made a billion bucks off this and they're just getting started
[2:19:40.720 --> 2:19:45.920]  that's why Rupert Murdoch has all his fake conservative publications telling
[2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:50.280]  you health care isn't gonna pass and telling you the cap and trade isn't
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:54.000]  gonna pass they told you it wouldn't pass the house it's all past they told you

[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:43.200]  who's in my film fall the Republic I just saw his car drive up he lives here in
[2:24:43.200 --> 2:24:46.880]  Austin former city councilman economist good friend of mine he's an
[2:24:46.880 --> 2:24:50.200]  Obama deception and fall the Republic he pulled up right as we were going live
[2:24:50.200 --> 2:24:53.480]  I said why not sit him down for the segment or two and I said what do you

[2:24:58.040 --> 2:25:00.920]  take on this and I want your truthful take what do you think of this film
[2:25:00.920 --> 2:25:04.920]  compared to the Obama deception well it's hard for me to be totally objective
[2:25:04.920 --> 2:25:09.600]  because I'm in it but I think it's the best thing you've ever done the Obama
[2:25:09.600 --> 2:25:15.760]  deception was awesome I think you've had over six or seven million hits on it I
[2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:20.480]  think this is going to be even bigger it's cleaner the production values are
[2:25:20.480 --> 2:25:28.720]  better it's right up to date and Alex I am so honored I am so honored to be your
[2:25:28.720 --> 2:25:34.480]  friend because I consider you one of the top Patriots this nation has ever had I

[2:25:38.160 --> 2:25:42.400]  and I accept that wholeheartedly and we're going to continue to do it because
[2:25:42.400 --> 2:25:48.640]  this country this country is far far too good to kick it away and right now if
[2:25:48.640 --> 2:25:54.240]  we the people who are listening to this right now if we don't get activated if
[2:25:54.240 --> 2:25:59.840]  we don't help stop this sick care program if we don't stop this carbon tax if
[2:25:59.840 --> 2:26:06.160]  we don't stop the lies if we don't stop the increased selling of our jobs to
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:10.320]  foreign countries the destruction of our dollar the bailouts all of this stuff
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:15.880]  it is all preconceived to destroy this wonderful beautiful Republic and now
[2:26:15.880 --> 2:26:19.360]  there's no longer any doubt they openly are announcing everywhere the end of
[2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:23.800]  America total carbon tax they're saying we won't turn the liquidity back on the
[2:26:23.800 --> 2:26:27.800]  banks who we gave this fiat power to it's a bunch of Madoff's and and and
[2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:32.000]  Ken lay types they in fact they came up with a plan themselves if we don't go
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:34.840]  along with this they're going to kill the economy they're already killing the
[2:26:34.840 --> 2:26:38.720]  economy they want zero growth they want negative growth they want a monopoly
[2:26:38.720 --> 2:26:41.560]  what is this cap and trade and government takeover of health care
[2:26:41.560 --> 2:26:45.520]  really about George well it's all about a transfer of power it has nothing to do
[2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:51.200]  with taking care of the people of this country it has nothing to do with honesty
[2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:57.680]  it has nothing to do with health it is 17% of the economy is going to be
[2:26:57.680 --> 2:27:04.040]  transferred to the control of the federal government it is sick care it is
[2:27:04.040 --> 2:27:11.000]  completely status quo it is absolutely selling out to big pharma the hospital
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:16.800]  corporations segments of the AMA and the insurance company and then here is the
[2:27:16.800 --> 2:27:20.080]  framework convention on climate change openly admitted that it's world
[2:27:20.080 --> 2:27:23.920]  government and then ban chi moon writes an editorial the UN secretary general
[2:27:23.920 --> 2:27:27.680]  it's saying global government global carbon tax and then I notice there's
[2:27:27.680 --> 2:27:31.360]  must be paid trolls all over my site all over YouTube under nothing other names
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:36.400]  cutting and pasting that I'm a liar that ban chi moon didn't write an article I
[2:27:36.400 --> 2:27:40.000]  mean they're using flat-out lies against us and I'm now on the White House
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:44.480]  enemies list and George Soros has opened fire on me every day in his
[2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:48.800]  publications well what does that say it means we can beat him yeah absolutely
[2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:54.040]  because you know the thing about it is the truth that moves very very slowly in
[2:27:54.040 --> 2:27:58.400]  lies and in due window and hate move very quickly and the lies in in due
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:28:03.480]  window are moving like mad dogs right now and even though you speak with a very
[2:28:03.480 --> 2:28:09.520]  harsh voice at times is that you speak the truth and the truth is coming out
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:14.000]  and remember 17 18 years ago when we were talking about this when we were a
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:19.360]  handful of about 15 people yeah I knew you before I even went on local TV when
[2:28:19.360 --> 2:28:23.240]  I was running around trying to get Pat you can and elected and we were done and
[2:28:23.240 --> 2:28:28.240]  with 17 18 years ago we were done and we would say the new world order and people
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:33.240]  would get it and now wherever I go I would just bind some flowers at a local
[2:28:33.240 --> 2:28:37.640]  place here and several people not one or two but several people came up and said
[2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:41.040]  aren't you George Humphrey and weren't you in the fall of the Republic and I
[2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:45.320]  went wow yeah thanks that was that's cool it's been out two weeks and you're
[2:28:45.320 --> 2:28:48.560]  already running the people on the street yeah and in and these are people I
[2:28:48.560 --> 2:28:55.000]  didn't know and clearly Austin is the center of the positive revolution the
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:59.080]  return isn't that crazy because all over the world mainstream media says we are
[2:28:59.080 --> 2:29:03.840]  the center we are the resistance people are moving here in all different forms
[2:29:03.840 --> 2:29:07.740]  whether it's for politics or economics but there are more and more people who
[2:29:07.740 --> 2:29:12.120]  are coming here for their spiritual upliftment too because as you and I both
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:17.240]  know this is not just an economic or a political or a cultural battle it is a
[2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:21.720]  time of spiritual choice and each and every one of us has to make a decision
[2:29:21.720 --> 2:29:25.760]  are we going to hold on to the old paradigm of separation consciousness and
[2:29:25.760 --> 2:29:31.080]  fear and domination which is going to take us to total chaos or are we going
[2:29:31.080 --> 2:29:35.720]  to change our lives to unity consciousness more love cooperation working
[2:29:35.720 --> 2:29:42.040]  with others but also self-sufficiency and bravery in a stiff backbone that's the
[2:29:42.040 --> 2:29:45.720]  new big paradigm we got a break I want to come back and talk about the globalist
[2:29:45.720 --> 2:29:49.400]  agenda they're moving on every front right now they're trying to sew things up

[2:34:49.640 --> 2:34:52.480]  you're back in Austin you're always jet-setting around the globe which is
[2:34:52.480 --> 2:34:56.160]  bad for your carbon footprint they're saying carbon credits carbon rationing
[2:34:56.160 --> 2:34:59.360]  you'll have to get government authorization to be able to fly that's
[2:34:59.360 --> 2:35:02.360]  openly being announced people are really waking up now because this is all
[2:35:02.360 --> 2:35:06.440]  happening but as an economist I have the health care bill I've read the sub
[2:35:06.440 --> 2:35:11.920]  sections here that the close to 2000 it's 1,960 something pages it says five
[2:35:11.920 --> 2:35:17.200]  years in prison quarter million dollar fine if you don't buy insurance so
[2:35:17.200 --> 2:35:22.720]  forget just taken and they take 2.5 to 5% depending on your your your your your
[2:35:22.720 --> 2:35:29.720]  pay grade 2.5 to 5% is taken out of your check this is in the bill and for the
[2:35:29.720 --> 2:35:34.760]  uninsured and you're forced to buy insurance so this is a massive new tax
[2:35:34.760 --> 2:35:38.240]  to the bankers as an economist who's predicted everything that's happening
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:41.680]  right now a top economist and a successful businessman what will this
[2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:45.280]  health care plan really do well first of all it hasn't passed the Senate and
[2:35:45.280 --> 2:35:50.920]  there's I'm sure there's gonna be huge changes but as it stands now Pelosi's
[2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:55.800]  bill according to one of the top guys I talked to he's neither Democrat or
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:36:01.600]  Republican he says that for a family for making a hundred thousand dollars it's
[2:36:01.600 --> 2:36:08.080]  gonna cost that family twenty thousand dollars a year as the bill stands right
[2:36:08.080 --> 2:36:12.680]  now now that's impossible a family for even though a hundred thousand dollars
[2:36:12.680 --> 2:36:16.520]  is a lot of money family for when they pay their mortgage when they pay their
[2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:20.880]  car payments when they pay their gas and electric in their phone and they send
[2:36:20.880 --> 2:36:25.240]  Johnny and Susie to school and they go to the Starbucks they don't have anything
[2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:29.440]  left as a matter of fact starting about seven years ago the first time in the
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:33.920]  history of America the average family in the United States is now spending more
[2:36:33.920 --> 2:36:40.280]  and has more debt than they than they have assets twenty thousand dollars as
[2:36:40.280 --> 2:36:45.240]  the bill stands right now now clearly clearly clearly the Senate's gonna change
[2:36:45.240 --> 2:36:49.440]  this thing it's gonna get it's gonna get moved around but the people of this
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:56.080]  country have to understand this is a status quo sick care bill it supports
[2:36:56.080 --> 2:37:02.440]  big pharma it supports the hospital corporations it supports segments of the
[2:37:02.440 --> 2:37:08.400]  AMA and of the insurance company does it support you and me no now let me be
[2:37:08.400 --> 2:37:12.080]  clear here just add a point Dennis Kucinich came out two weeks ago wrote an
[2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:17.800]  editorial gave a speech and it was titled health care bill is a bailout to
[2:37:17.800 --> 2:37:22.640]  insurance companies and then he wrote another editorial Monday titled why I
[2:37:22.640 --> 2:37:27.360]  voted against the bill and he's a socialist but I respect him because
[2:37:27.360 --> 2:37:29.960]  you'll speak out against government sponsored terror he's a good man I
[2:37:29.960 --> 2:37:34.320]  disagree with his political system and his ideas on economics but I really
[2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:37.760]  respect Dennis because he's the real deal yeah I know and he said look this
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:41.360]  isn't socialism you know when Newsweek says we're all socialists now bull the
[2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:44.800]  insurance companies the fact I have the Wall Street Journal right here the
[2:37:44.800 --> 2:37:47.960]  insurance companies here is the spokesman for the insurance companies
[2:37:47.960 --> 2:37:53.960]  admitting in this article from the Wall Street Journal that they actually wrote
[2:37:53.960 --> 2:37:57.200]  the bill they want penalties they want to make you get this it gives them
[2:37:57.200 --> 2:38:00.880]  liability protection but they come out and act like they're actually against it
[2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:04.520]  just like news core is actually for the global greenhouse tax absolutely of
[2:38:04.520 --> 2:38:07.760]  course so again there's all sorts of baiting and switching here and every
[2:38:07.760 --> 2:38:10.680]  time we say we're against this oh you you're against cap and trade you work
[2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:14.200]  for the oil companies their funding cap and trade oh you're against the health
[2:38:14.200 --> 2:38:16.400]  care bill you're working for the insurance companies you know I work for
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:21.600]  Alex Jones and that's it you know the fact is is this is not about health this
[2:38:21.600 --> 2:38:28.720]  is about a transfer of power 17% of the gross national product of the whole
[2:38:28.720 --> 2:38:33.000]  economy is going to be transferred from the private sector which isn't working
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:38.120]  right now but to the federal sector which is going to be an absolute train
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:43.680]  wreck this is about the grabbing of power the taking of your rights and friends
[2:38:43.680 --> 2:38:47.960]  the only way it's going to stop is when the people who are listening to this get
[2:38:47.960 --> 2:38:52.160]  themselves fully educated listen to Alex watch fall the Republic and then go
[2:38:52.160 --> 2:38:57.080]  talk to your friends and then start beating the pants it's time to stop
[2:38:57.080 --> 2:39:02.000]  being secret and in whispering about this stuff it's time to start talking
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:07.480]  about it everywhere you go in the grocery stores at the coffee houses at your
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:12.960]  club on your runs at church everybody you know you need to speak to you're
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:15.800]  right George because they're they're making their move right now I mean go
[2:39:15.800 --> 2:39:22.240]  back to October 13 months ago all over the news it was we need this banker bail
[2:39:22.240 --> 2:39:25.440]  out this will pay for everybody's mortgages this will unfreeze mortgages
[2:39:25.440 --> 2:39:30.080]  and they pass it on the 3rd of October October 4th on Saturday Paulson comes
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:32.960]  as we're not going to spend it on that now and we're not going to tell you
[2:39:32.960 --> 2:39:36.240]  where the money's going same with health care same with cap and trade
[2:39:36.240 --> 2:39:41.360]  anything they bill as being for the people the elite own our Congress that
[2:39:41.360 --> 2:39:45.720]  it is not for you here's an amazing statistic in the last six months in the
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:51.720]  last hundred working days in the United States Goldman Sachs through the carry
[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:57.960]  trade has made over a hundred million dollars per day in the reverse carry
[2:39:57.960 --> 2:40:02.520]  trade just on manipulating dollars and manipulating dollars it used to be the
[2:40:02.520 --> 2:40:06.840]  Japanese carry trade here what we've done now is reverse it in the big guys
[2:40:06.840 --> 2:40:10.880]  Goldman Sachs mostly through investments in Brazil and some of the other
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:16.560]  countries they are making a hundred million dollars a day off the death of
[2:40:16.560 --> 2:40:19.920]  the dollar off the death of the dollar and they're saying the Arabs are
[2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:23.000]  killing the dollar the Arabs the Chinese the Russians that they're all
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:27.080]  begging us not to do this they hold all the dollars but the media is killing the
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:32.320]  dollar the banks are killing it and blaming it on the Iranians no the
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:36.520]  enemy is the Federal Reserve they are the culprit the enemy is inside the walls
[2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:41.760]  and the folks who are running these what you know do all you have to do is read
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:46.880]  Thomas Jefferson Abraham Lincoln or read the economists wake up friends the
[2:40:46.880 --> 2:40:51.200]  people who are controlling Wall Street that are the same people who control ABC
[2:40:51.200 --> 2:40:56.640]  NBC the total media and they control both the Republican and Democratic parties
[2:40:56.640 --> 2:41:03.880]  and the controlled opposition what we are facing is so much bigger than even
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:09.200]  95 percent of educated patriots are aware of exactly that's why people ask
[2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:14.040]  why I'm so upset and I'm so folks if I caught somebody robbing my car in my
[2:41:14.040 --> 2:41:18.280]  yard I'd get upset this is a government organized tyranny taking over my life
[2:41:18.280 --> 2:41:24.400]  these are bad people they want to force eugenics and control and inoculations
[2:41:24.400 --> 2:41:28.880]  through a medical tyranny Goldman Sachs because they can borrow directly from
[2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:34.800]  the Treasury is taking money at less than one half of one percent and then able
[2:41:34.800 --> 2:41:38.880]  to go out and buy the reserves all the way around the world well does you see
[2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:43.800]  that McClatchy series investigative reports we had him on last Friday this
[2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:47.320]  top investigative journalist they got the internal documents were Goldman Sachs
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:52.520]  plan the implosion of the housing market they sold all these housing stocks
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:56.360]  while betting against them to destroy their competition I mean this is a
[2:41:56.360 --> 2:42:00.480]  cold-blooded group of course that is and notice their people are all the top
[2:42:00.480 --> 2:42:06.120]  federal regulators of course and you point that out very very very clearly
[2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:11.400]  in fall the Republic and friends it go this thing is so much bigger and there's
[2:42:11.400 --> 2:42:15.560]  one other point that I would like to make before I go the United States has
[2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:22.120]  transported several nuclear bunker busting bombs over to Israel and there
[2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:26.760]  are plans right now for either an American or American Israeli or Israeli
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:32.440]  attack on Iran and the Iran corporation says the globalist need
[2:42:32.440 --> 2:42:36.880]  world war three to get their new world order friends this would be the most
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:42.520]  destabilizing event in the history of our lives if we go in in new korean and
[2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:46.240]  I am not a friend of the Iranian government I think that they're they're
[2:42:46.240 --> 2:42:50.440]  loony tunes yeah but the globalist want to have order out of chaos of course they
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:56.200]  do and right now if you put together Russia China India and Iran and maybe
[2:42:56.200 --> 2:43:01.320]  Brazil and and and some of the others is that the destabilization to this
[2:43:01.320 --> 2:43:05.800]  country is unbelievable they want world war three in Central Asia absolutely
[2:43:05.800 --> 2:43:09.920]  they do and all you have to do is is read Brzezinski's book yeah they admit it
[2:43:09.920 --> 2:43:13.800]  all they admitted all the grand the geopolitical master strategy
[2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:19.120]  strategist are all public about this and and friends all of these things whether
[2:43:19.120 --> 2:43:23.840]  it's political economic environmental all these things all we're doing is for
[2:43:23.840 --> 2:43:28.360]  asking you wake up right now if you care about this country you have to make a
[2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:33.000]  choice either you can go along with the status quo and hideout and if you do
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:38.240]  that your country and your family are doomed George last question why I mean
[2:43:38.240 --> 2:43:41.240]  I have my perspective why are they openly announcing world government
[2:43:41.240 --> 2:43:45.640]  openly announcing the carbon tax after decades of denying it and planning in
[2:43:45.640 --> 2:43:50.000]  our mind it didn't exist giving people that compulsion that it isn't real now
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:52.760]  they come out and admit everything I mean that means they're really making
[2:43:52.760 --> 2:43:56.200]  their move well because they're first of all they're arrogant and and and from
[2:43:56.200 --> 2:44:02.520]  their point of view they have all their bases covered they in what's also there
[2:44:02.520 --> 2:44:07.400]  is so much going on and and I would suggest that everybody watch this
[2:44:07.400 --> 2:44:12.720]  television show called V that's the big hit and friends there's a lot more going
[2:44:12.720 --> 2:44:15.920]  on with that show that you may understand they're throwing it in your face
[2:44:15.920 --> 2:44:20.240]  what Obama is doing it's revelation of the method all about Obama it's all
[2:44:20.240 --> 2:44:24.520]  about world government it's all about them telling us what they're gonna do
[2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:29.720]  which they have to do which is part of their sick their game and they're put
[2:44:29.720 --> 2:44:33.240]  and notice notice the aliens we're not saying it's really aliens but it's the
[2:44:33.240 --> 2:44:36.480]  archetype are gonna suck all our resources course cap and trade is about
[2:44:36.480 --> 2:44:40.920]  shutting everything off to us training us that we're saving the earth I mean
[2:44:40.920 --> 2:44:45.560]  these people people are saying oh V is exposing Obama no they're telling you
[2:44:45.560 --> 2:44:48.200]  what you're what they're doing just like when I talk about the new world order
[2:44:48.200 --> 2:44:51.840]  you they go you mean Hulk Hogan now when I talk about a global elite shutting off
[2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:56.400]  our resources to exterminate us they go oh you mean V George talk to the

[2:45:54.400 --> 2:46:00.240]  he's hosted NFL football there's not much this guy hadn't done and now he's

[2:46:03.240 --> 2:46:07.440]  winter their big number one promoted show and I'm seeing that now in the media
[2:46:07.440 --> 2:46:12.640]  that's conspiracy theory created by Jesse Ventura I'm a consultant on it I'm
[2:46:12.640 --> 2:46:16.720]  in some of the episodes I'm very honored to be involved in it and to give you the
[2:46:16.720 --> 2:46:21.240]  inside scoop he starts the media blitz tomorrow to give you the inside scoop is
[2:46:21.240 --> 2:46:25.080]  Jesse Ventura with us for the next hour we may twist his arm a little bit in the
[2:46:25.080 --> 2:46:29.080]  next hour to take some phone calls but we'll see governor it is good to have you
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:35.280]  here with us Alex great to be here again are you gonna I guess I guess I should
[2:46:35.280 --> 2:46:42.280]  call you a huggy bear and I'll explain that for a moment now Alex has been
[2:46:42.280 --> 2:46:47.480]  good enough he he appears in a couple of the episodes of conspiracy theory that
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:52.760]  we did and so because he's the only really reoccurring character we've ever
[2:46:52.760 --> 2:46:58.000]  had in the first initial bite we went back to the old Starsky and Hutch show
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:01.440]  and you all remember huggy bear don't you the guy that always brought the
[2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:06.560]  information to Starsky and Hutch yes well that's you now Alex you're so you're
[2:47:06.560 --> 2:47:12.880]  our huggy bear well I'm honored to be your huggy bear you've not been able to
[2:47:12.880 --> 2:47:17.320]  talk about the show till now they've unleashed you you barely talked about it
[2:47:17.320 --> 2:47:21.920]  on Larry King live last week but now you've been given the green light to
[2:47:21.920 --> 2:47:29.200]  give people a foretaste or an idea of what's going to be in the seven
[2:47:29.200 --> 2:47:32.480]  episodes and so we're all ears governor I mean tell us about some of the
[2:47:32.480 --> 2:47:37.280]  episodes well first of all when I went on Larry it was because you know it was
[2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:43.040]  election night and Larry truly wanted my opinion on the latest off-year elections
[2:47:43.040 --> 2:47:49.160]  which I'll do this right now to me why did he even have off-year elections it's
[2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:54.520]  hard enough to get people out there to vote I have a mall on here they do that
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:47:58.400]  so that they get a small voter turnout because it's easier to control small
[2:47:58.400 --> 2:48:04.040]  numbers and so that's why that happens pretty much but that being said that's
[2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:07.960]  why it was on Larry was mainly for the the election stuff not so much a
[2:48:07.960 --> 2:48:12.880]  promotion of the show because I'll be going back on Larry later on the end of
[2:48:12.880 --> 2:48:16.680]  the month right when it gets to the debut date which of course is December
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:22.640]  the second on the two channel at 10 Eastern 9 central and so I'll be going
[2:48:22.640 --> 2:48:27.440]  back on Larry then and at that point in time it'll be a promo for the show so I
[2:48:27.440 --> 2:48:31.440]  just did Larry where they promoted a little bit but it was mostly on voting
[2:48:31.440 --> 2:48:39.320]  but I don't want to stop you I want you to have free flow and go over as much
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:43.200]  as you can tell us about the episodes because I've consulted some but I still
[2:48:43.200 --> 2:48:46.920]  only have a few pieces of the overall puzzle and I know that you've stated
[2:48:46.920 --> 2:48:50.560]  that you believe this is fair and from our perspective probably the first
[2:48:50.560 --> 2:48:55.320]  television show ever that's actually from people who questions perspective that
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:59.280]  doesn't mean that you or I or anybody buys all of what's being set out there
[2:48:59.280 --> 2:49:02.080]  so I want to talk about that when you come back in just a minute but in the
[2:49:02.080 --> 2:49:07.080]  one minute we've got what is your take on Republicans sweeping all over the
[2:49:07.080 --> 2:49:11.640]  country and Obama's plunging approval rating well I don't think it's so much
[2:49:11.640 --> 2:49:17.920]  Republicans sweeping okay you know they lost that we are live ladies and
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:21.720]  gentlemen we come back over to this quick break dr. Sherry 10 penny is our

[2:49:42.320 --> 2:49:45.400]  want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio

[2:52:15.300 --> 2:52:21.220]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[2:52:21.220 --> 2:52:26.500]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:26.500 --> 2:52:29.700]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[2:52:29.700 --> 2:52:34.100]  The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:52:34.100 --> 2:52:36.580]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:52:36.580 --> 2:52:40.500]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches
[2:52:40.500 --> 2:52:42.980]  and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to?
[2:52:42.980 --> 2:52:50.260]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[2:53:00.180 --> 2:53:06.660]  Hello at ofthefield.com we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[2:53:06.660 --> 2:53:11.540]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback most of which we feature on ofthefield.com.
[2:53:11.540 --> 2:53:16.660]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[2:53:16.660 --> 2:53:20.740]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[2:53:20.740 --> 2:53:24.820]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles but you take it to a whole new level.
[2:53:24.820 --> 2:53:28.660]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge. It was empowering.
[2:53:28.660 --> 2:53:32.660]  When I was in the Navy I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[2:53:32.660 --> 2:53:35.460]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[2:53:35.460 --> 2:53:38.340]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[2:53:38.340 --> 2:53:39.300]  Thank you so much.
[2:53:39.300 --> 2:53:42.180]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the Boonies.
[2:53:42.180 --> 2:53:42.900]  Thanks again.
[2:53:42.900 --> 2:53:45.540]  Knowledge is power and that power brings peace.
[2:53:46.260 --> 2:53:49.700]  Folks thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[2:54:08.980 --> 2:54:11.940]  Okay I'm going to clear the call board for the next hour.
[2:54:11.940 --> 2:54:16.340]  Sorry to folks holding but only vaccine questions for Dr. Sherry Tinpenny.
[2:54:16.340 --> 2:54:20.500]  Coming up in studio 1-800-259-9231.
[2:54:20.500 --> 2:54:24.020]  DrTinpenny.com is one of her great websites.
[2:54:24.020 --> 2:54:26.660]  She's the best-selling author, medical doctor.
[2:54:26.660 --> 2:54:28.980]  She really needs no introduction for over a decade.
[2:54:28.980 --> 2:54:33.540]  She's been one of the main voices out there eloquently in a focused way even on mainstream
[2:54:33.540 --> 2:54:37.780]  television and radio exposing what's happening with the vaccines.
[2:54:37.780 --> 2:54:41.300]  And here to tell us why she's in Austin is Dr. Sherry Tinpenny.
[2:54:41.300 --> 2:54:42.260]  It's great to have you.
[2:54:42.260 --> 2:54:44.180]  Thanks Alex. It's a pleasure to be here.
[2:54:44.180 --> 2:54:46.100]  Yeah we had a really fun meeting last night.
[2:54:46.100 --> 2:54:50.660]  It was sponsored by the University of Texas, the Libertarian Party and a big group of people who
[2:54:50.660 --> 2:54:53.060]  actually said it was just great to have there.
[2:54:53.060 --> 2:54:58.100]  We had to my knowledge this is the first time ever that a public health department official
[2:54:58.100 --> 2:55:04.980]  who was a Region 7 official agreed to debate in a public forum the pro and con side of vaccines
[2:55:04.980 --> 2:55:06.820]  and particularly vaccine mandates.
[2:55:06.820 --> 2:55:08.340]  So it was a really good meeting.
[2:55:08.340 --> 2:55:09.300]  There were a lot of people there.
[2:55:09.300 --> 2:55:11.220]  There was phenomenal questions.
[2:55:11.220 --> 2:55:13.060]  It was kind of a controlled forum.
[2:55:13.060 --> 2:55:19.220]  I mean there was a set of questions that we had ahead of time that we were able to put together
[2:55:19.220 --> 2:55:20.020]  answers for.
[2:55:20.020 --> 2:55:24.020]  Then there were some spontaneous questions and then we had an hour of interviews of questions
[2:55:24.020 --> 2:55:25.700]  from the audience that were really good.
[2:55:25.700 --> 2:55:29.220]  In fact we probably could have stayed there another hour just asking all the questions.
[2:55:29.220 --> 2:55:32.260]  And the health department officials they were really kind of backed against the wall.
[2:55:32.260 --> 2:55:37.140]  Not necessarily in a bad way but a way that they really for the first time I think really
[2:55:37.140 --> 2:55:41.940]  heard people say that vaccines are not safe, they are not effective, they don't protect you
[2:55:41.940 --> 2:55:43.540]  and yes they do cause harm.
[2:55:43.540 --> 2:55:47.460]  Well two weeks ago we had the Dallas County Health Department head on and he said yes the
[2:55:47.460 --> 2:55:50.660]  inserts say it can give you gallium beret or other neurological disorders.
[2:55:50.660 --> 2:55:52.740]  Yes it can sterilize your fertility.
[2:55:52.740 --> 2:55:54.660]  Yes it can cause autoimmune disease.
[2:55:54.660 --> 2:55:56.020]  Yes it has mercury in it.
[2:55:56.020 --> 2:55:58.660]  Yes the nasal is live and can spread it.
[2:55:58.660 --> 2:56:02.740]  And I had people calling and freaking out going we thought you were just saying this Alex.
[2:56:02.740 --> 2:56:04.580]  No it's in the inserts.
[2:56:04.580 --> 2:56:09.460]  The health department heads will actually admit this but then the schools and the federal
[2:56:09.460 --> 2:56:14.100]  government are handing out fake info sheets as you know saying none of this is true.
[2:56:14.100 --> 2:56:19.060]  I think that backfired on them because now people actually ask for the real drug insert
[2:56:19.060 --> 2:56:22.020]  and they're going whoa I didn't know this was going on.
[2:56:22.020 --> 2:56:25.300]  So it does seem that you that they've ignored us in the past.
[2:56:25.300 --> 2:56:29.460]  Now they're being forced to come down off their mountain because doctors in Europe,
[2:56:29.460 --> 2:56:32.660]  doctors in Germany, doctors here, nurses are refusing to take it.
[2:56:32.660 --> 2:56:35.700]  Am I right in saying because you're right at the center of this Dr. Sherry Tenpenny
[2:56:35.700 --> 2:56:37.780]  that this is really blowing up in their face.
[2:56:37.780 --> 2:56:42.100]  They tried this offensive to set the precedent for forced inoculation
[2:56:42.100 --> 2:56:45.300]  and for this hoax, this panic and it's blown up in their face.
[2:56:45.300 --> 2:56:45.940]  I agree.
[2:56:45.940 --> 2:56:48.100]  I agree and I think that we've done several things.
[2:56:48.980 --> 2:56:54.020]  One of the other websites that I have that I'm a co-developer of is a website that's
[2:56:54.020 --> 2:56:56.260]  pandemicfluonline.com.
[2:56:56.260 --> 2:56:58.500]  It's pandemicfluonline.com.
[2:56:58.500 --> 2:57:01.620]  And one of the things that we did that I think really made a difference
[2:57:01.620 --> 2:57:03.540]  was that we gave people tools.
[2:57:03.540 --> 2:57:07.220]  You know we're always telling people to get busy, get out, get active, do things.
[2:57:07.220 --> 2:57:10.980]  And so what we did on this website was we gave people downloadable flyers,
[2:57:10.980 --> 2:57:14.660]  downloadable PowerPoint presentations, downloadable things that they could start
[2:57:14.660 --> 2:57:18.340]  back in August handing things out because we knew it was coming.
[2:57:18.340 --> 2:57:20.900]  We knew it was coming from, it's the annual flu shot every year.
[2:57:20.900 --> 2:57:23.140]  We knew the swine flu stuff was coming this year.
[2:57:23.140 --> 2:57:26.740]  And thousands and thousands of people were handing those things out.
[2:57:26.740 --> 2:57:28.580]  And I think that they were really taken back.
[2:57:28.580 --> 2:57:31.460]  I think they were blown back by the response that people have had.
[2:57:31.460 --> 2:57:33.620]  So the work that you did, the work that we've done,
[2:57:33.620 --> 2:57:35.620]  I think has really made a difference this time around.
[2:57:35.620 --> 2:57:39.300]  And by the way, I've seen major British newspapers with the
[2:57:40.500 --> 2:57:44.180]  health heads saying extremists, terrorists are handing out flyers.
[2:57:44.180 --> 2:57:45.620]  They're all over London.
[2:57:45.620 --> 2:57:48.900]  And I think a lot of listeners saw the success of our Obama Joker poster,
[2:57:48.900 --> 2:57:52.580]  making hundreds of newspapers and TV stations.
[2:57:52.580 --> 2:57:54.900]  And they really picked up on your flyers.
[2:57:54.900 --> 2:57:56.900]  And it's just been incredibly explosive.
[2:57:56.900 --> 2:57:59.780]  The people are learning how much power they've got.
[2:57:59.780 --> 2:58:01.140]  Yeah, I think so.
[2:58:01.140 --> 2:58:03.060]  I think that people don't realize that, you know,
[2:58:03.060 --> 2:58:06.260]  if they just take those flyers and they do things like I used to,
[2:58:06.260 --> 2:58:08.260]  I have a whole stack of them in the back of my car.
[2:58:08.260 --> 2:58:10.100]  When I go into the mall, I just take them with me
[2:58:10.100 --> 2:58:11.220]  and I just hand them out to people.
[2:58:11.220 --> 2:58:13.540]  I don't even try to engage a conversation.
[2:58:13.540 --> 2:58:16.340]  I just say, here's some information I think you may want to look at
[2:58:16.340 --> 2:58:16.980]  and just hand it.
[2:58:16.980 --> 2:58:19.620]  And you never know whose hands that might end up in.
[2:58:19.620 --> 2:58:22.180]  I've gone to little community workshops
[2:58:22.180 --> 2:58:23.700]  where they've printed out all these flyers
[2:58:23.700 --> 2:58:26.260]  and they have them there and they're handing them out to all sorts of people.
[2:58:26.260 --> 2:58:28.100]  So people are really taking charge.
[2:58:28.100 --> 2:58:31.060]  It's for the, we had a big long conversation about this last night
[2:58:31.060 --> 2:58:32.180]  at the health department.
[2:58:32.180 --> 2:58:33.940]  Stay there back in 70 seconds
[2:58:33.940 --> 2:58:36.420]  with the fourth and final hour with Dr. Sherry.
[2:58:36.420 --> 2:58:36.900]  Ten penny.
[2:58:36.900 --> 2:58:38.180]  We'll give you all the websites.
[2:58:38.980 --> 2:58:39.620]  Stay with us.
[2:58:43.300 --> 2:58:45.060]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:46.500 --> 2:58:48.820]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:52.580 --> 2:58:56.580]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:58:56.580 --> 2:58:59.780]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:58:59.780 --> 2:59:03.220]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[2:59:03.220 --> 2:59:05.140]  from underneath Americans at home.
[2:59:05.140 --> 2:59:09.220]  They've turned a tremendous influence on our president and Congress
[2:59:09.220 --> 2:59:11.060]  and they really are calling the shots.
[2:59:11.060 --> 2:59:16.340]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:59:16.340 --> 2:59:19.540]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[2:59:19.540 --> 2:59:23.940]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:59:23.940 --> 2:59:26.420]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:59:26.420 --> 2:59:28.740]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists.
[2:59:28.740 --> 2:59:31.540]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[2:59:31.540 --> 2:59:32.740]  who do we make the checkout to?
[2:59:32.740 --> 2:59:34.820]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[2:59:34.820 --> 2:59:40.020]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[2:59:44.980 --> 2:59:59.780]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:00:15.540 --> 3:00:20.580]  Well, medical doctor Dr. Sherry Tim Penney, an osteopathic medical doctor
[3:00:20.580 --> 3:00:23.860]  from Cleveland, Ohio, board certification in emergency medicine,
[3:00:24.580 --> 3:00:29.940]  an osteopathic manual medicine at her integrative medical clinic focused on
[3:00:29.940 --> 3:00:33.460]  allergy elimination, including treatment of children with asthma and allergies
[3:00:33.460 --> 3:00:36.500]  at women's health using bioidentical hormones and breast
[3:00:37.860 --> 3:00:38.580]  thermography.
[3:00:38.580 --> 3:00:41.940]  Her clinic has restored the health of patients who have come from 38 states
[3:00:41.940 --> 3:00:43.220]  in eight countries and it goes on.
[3:00:43.220 --> 3:00:47.860]  She's the executive director of the, well, I mean, you tell us your bio
[3:00:47.860 --> 3:00:48.820]  because you've done so much.
[3:00:48.820 --> 3:00:53.700]  You were probably the leading person in the last decade exposing vaccines.
[3:00:53.700 --> 3:00:55.140]  You had a big debate last night.
[3:00:55.140 --> 3:00:56.100]  I want to get into that.
[3:00:56.100 --> 3:00:59.380]  I want to just sit back and let you tell the listeners the latest developments
[3:00:59.380 --> 3:01:02.660]  with the flu, the forced inoculations in public schools they've been caught
[3:01:02.660 --> 3:01:04.340]  doing and then saying, oops, we messed up.
[3:01:04.900 --> 3:01:06.900]  The rebellion by doctors worldwide.
[3:01:07.940 --> 3:01:11.780]  It looks like this, this flu scam has really stalled,
[3:01:11.780 --> 3:01:14.660]  dead in its tracks. Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, you got the floor.
[3:01:15.220 --> 3:01:18.500]  One of the things that we did was we created tools for people to get out
[3:01:18.500 --> 3:01:19.380]  and get active.
[3:01:19.380 --> 3:01:22.900]  We created flyers and small PowerPoint presentations and we put them on our
[3:01:22.900 --> 3:01:25.140]  website, pandemicfluonline.com.
[3:01:25.140 --> 3:01:27.940]  They're also on doctortenpenny.com, which is my website.
[3:01:27.940 --> 3:01:30.980]  And we've done just an amazing amount of things to get people active.
[3:01:30.980 --> 3:01:34.100]  And I think that there's more people that are asking questions
[3:01:34.100 --> 3:01:37.780]  and are being part of what's happening right now than ever before.
[3:01:37.780 --> 3:01:40.340]  I mean, 10 years ago when we started talking about all these things that
[3:01:40.340 --> 3:01:43.140]  had to do with vaccines, there was barely a voice.
[3:01:43.140 --> 3:01:44.980]  There was hardly anybody listening.
[3:01:44.980 --> 3:01:48.660]  And now what they're doing is more and more people are getting involved.
[3:01:48.660 --> 3:01:49.700]  People are asking questions.
[3:01:49.700 --> 3:01:50.900]  People are saying no.
[3:01:50.900 --> 3:01:52.500]  People are challenging their doctors.
[3:01:52.500 --> 3:01:54.980]  They're finding out that they don't need a pediatrician if they have
[3:01:54.980 --> 3:01:55.700]  healthy children.
[3:01:55.700 --> 3:01:59.140]  They can find other types of healthcare practitioners to help them stay well
[3:01:59.140 --> 3:02:02.260]  and get and stay out of the vaccination lines.
[3:02:03.460 --> 3:02:08.340]  Going back to April, and I had said in January they're going to stage
[3:02:08.340 --> 3:02:10.740]  some flu hype because I saw the federal government and FEMA
[3:02:10.740 --> 3:02:13.540]  getting ready with local police departments saying get ready for mass
[3:02:13.540 --> 3:02:15.700]  graves, a big pandemic's coming.
[3:02:15.700 --> 3:02:18.020]  The flu makers were quietly gearing up.
[3:02:18.020 --> 3:02:19.060]  They knew this was coming.
[3:02:19.060 --> 3:02:22.340]  A lot of scientists say it's clearly been designed.
[3:02:22.340 --> 3:02:24.740]  Then we saw the hype in the aftermath,
[3:02:24.740 --> 3:02:28.180]  the attempt to make it mandatory in New York and in Massachusetts.
[3:02:29.700 --> 3:02:32.740]  I mean, I know you're a scientist, a doctor, a researcher, a journalist.
[3:02:32.740 --> 3:02:33.780]  You go off what you can prove.
[3:02:33.780 --> 3:02:36.500]  But in your gut, is this whole thing staged?
[3:02:36.500 --> 3:02:39.940]  I think that there is some staging to it.
[3:02:39.940 --> 3:02:43.380]  And what I'm really concerned about is the next wave that's going to come along.
[3:02:43.380 --> 3:02:47.220]  I think that these people, they pushed way too hard to get everybody
[3:02:47.220 --> 3:02:50.020]  vaccinated for what was known to be a mild virus.
[3:02:50.020 --> 3:02:53.140]  It wasn't any different than any other influenza virus that we've seen before.
[3:02:53.140 --> 3:02:54.820]  And they pushed way too hard.
[3:02:54.820 --> 3:02:56.980]  Now we're seeing some things sort of fall through the cracks.
[3:02:56.980 --> 3:02:59.700]  I'm real concerned about the stuff that's happening in the Ukraine.
[3:02:59.700 --> 3:03:02.420]  I mean, we don't know for sure what's happening over there.
[3:03:02.420 --> 3:03:05.220]  We really don't know what's going to happen come winter time.
[3:03:05.220 --> 3:03:08.580]  When the Winter Olympics is in Vancouver and there's a whole group of people
[3:03:08.580 --> 3:03:09.940]  that are there from all over the world.
[3:03:09.940 --> 3:03:11.300]  I mean, what's going to happen then?
[3:03:11.300 --> 3:03:15.140]  I'm really concerned about the accidents that are happening in schools.
[3:03:15.140 --> 3:03:19.380]  These kids are getting two and three and four flu shots that they get.
[3:03:19.380 --> 3:03:21.380]  The regular flu shot and the swine flu shot.
[3:03:21.380 --> 3:03:23.780]  I'm super concerned about the flu-missed vaccine.
[3:03:23.780 --> 3:03:25.780]  Now, maybe it was an accident with Jeffrey Dahmer.
[3:03:25.780 --> 3:03:27.060]  Maybe that was all an accident.
[3:03:27.060 --> 3:03:29.060]  I mean, it's always an accident.
[3:03:29.060 --> 3:03:32.260]  If you or I injected a child whose parents were against it, we go to jail.
[3:03:32.260 --> 3:03:35.380]  But when they have accidents, oopsie, no big deal.
[3:03:35.380 --> 3:03:40.180]  Yeah, and they always say that these kids got multiple flu shots and they were safe.
[3:03:40.180 --> 3:03:41.220]  Nothing had happened.
[3:03:41.220 --> 3:03:44.740]  Well, you can't say that because you don't know what's going to happen two weeks,
[3:03:44.740 --> 3:03:46.260]  two months, two years from now.
[3:03:46.260 --> 3:03:51.780]  Well, we're also only finding out about mainly children that collapse and go to the hospital.
[3:03:51.780 --> 3:03:56.260]  That's what we found out in New York and other states that they had done a secret inoculation.
[3:03:56.260 --> 3:04:00.260]  And notice the accidents are all with elementary students where they think the children won't
[3:04:00.260 --> 3:04:02.260]  be able to explain the story.
[3:04:02.260 --> 3:04:06.260]  And we caught schools denying they'd done it and then later it would come out they had.
[3:04:06.260 --> 3:04:07.220]  So they're also lying.
[3:04:07.220 --> 3:04:09.220]  I mean, this is really creepy and criminal.
[3:04:09.220 --> 3:04:11.220]  It varies much creepy and criminal.
[3:04:11.220 --> 3:04:15.220]  And it's like parents, parents should have some recourse to that.
[3:04:15.220 --> 3:04:21.220]  Now, I don't think that the parents can actually sue the school system because they have to prove that something had harmed them.
[3:04:21.220 --> 3:04:23.220]  But I think they can go after the school boards.
[3:04:23.220 --> 3:04:24.260]  They can vote them out.
[3:04:24.260 --> 3:04:29.220]  They can show up at the school boards every single session that they have and force them to give them an answer.
[3:04:29.220 --> 3:04:31.220]  They can say, where is our money going?
[3:04:31.220 --> 3:04:35.220]  How much money are you getting school board for doing these inoculations in these school systems?
[3:04:35.220 --> 3:04:39.220]  And I think that parents need to be really, really proactive because this is just the first step.
[3:04:39.220 --> 3:04:42.220]  If they're doing this with flu shots, what's going to be the next thing?
[3:04:42.220 --> 3:04:45.220]  Are you going to inoculate kids at school with Gardasil?
[3:04:45.220 --> 3:04:46.220]  Okay, stay there.
[3:04:46.220 --> 3:04:48.220]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is our guest.
[3:04:48.220 --> 3:04:50.220]  We're going to come back long segment.
[3:04:50.220 --> 3:04:53.220]  We're going to go over the flu, Gardasil, the forced inoculations.
[3:04:53.220 --> 3:04:56.220]  What's happening in Ukraine, what she thinks is coming up next.
[3:04:56.220 --> 3:05:01.220]  But first, we'll talk about the debate last night. Get some details from her on that.

[3:08:03.220 --> 3:08:09.220]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:08:09.220 --> 3:08:14.220]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:14.220 --> 3:08:22.220]  Well, the leading fighter against the military industrial complex, big pharma push to force
[3:08:22.220 --> 3:08:28.220]  Gardasil, hepatitis shots, flu shots filled with mercury on our children is here.
[3:08:28.220 --> 3:08:32.220]  She's been debating the health department at the University of Texas at Austin.
[3:08:32.220 --> 3:08:39.220]  She is here in studio, whether your calls are coming up at the bottom of the hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[3:08:39.220 --> 3:08:45.220]  OK, Doc, addressing folks out there in TV land and in radio land, you've got the floor,
[3:08:45.220 --> 3:08:47.220]  whatever you think is most important to talk about.
[3:08:47.220 --> 3:08:50.220]  I'd like to first hear about the debate last night, what you did today,
[3:08:50.220 --> 3:08:55.220]  and then your concerns about this being a preparatory phase for something bigger this year or next year,
[3:08:55.220 --> 3:09:00.220]  what's happening in Ukraine, the good news that people are resisting,
[3:09:00.220 --> 3:09:03.220]  the bad news that the government is still trying to push it.
[3:09:03.220 --> 3:09:06.220]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, give us a report.
[3:09:06.220 --> 3:09:11.220]  Well, last night was a really interesting evening with the officials from the health department.
[3:09:11.220 --> 3:09:14.220]  We had the person that was on stage with us, which was great, Dr. Betts.
[3:09:14.220 --> 3:09:17.220]  I mean, he really was a trooper.
[3:09:17.220 --> 3:09:20.220]  I mean, he actually had said to us before we started the talk,
[3:09:20.220 --> 3:09:23.220]  we went up and introduced ourselves and said, thank you for coming,
[3:09:23.220 --> 3:09:24.220]  and we really like to have you.
[3:09:24.220 --> 3:09:27.220]  We're really glad that you're willing to do this.
[3:09:27.220 --> 3:09:29.220]  And he said, well, nobody else really wanted to do it.
[3:09:29.220 --> 3:09:31.220]  And I said, well, why is that?
[3:09:31.220 --> 3:09:32.220]  He says, here's your opportunity.
[3:09:32.220 --> 3:09:37.220]  Here's your floor in terms of your opportunity to tell your whole side of the story.
[3:09:37.220 --> 3:09:40.220]  And he said, well, we've done things like this before and they haven't gone well.
[3:09:40.220 --> 3:09:42.220]  And I think it really did go well.
[3:09:42.220 --> 3:09:44.220]  I think that we had a very respectful audience.
[3:09:44.220 --> 3:09:49.220]  I think that we had an opportunity to have questions ahead of time that we had answered.
[3:09:49.220 --> 3:09:55.220]  Some of the questions were things like, do we really think that the H1N1 vaccine
[3:09:55.220 --> 3:09:57.220]  was really going to be the cause of the pandemic?
[3:09:57.220 --> 3:10:01.220]  And one of the things that I said was, well, I think that the flu mist has a risk
[3:10:01.220 --> 3:10:05.220]  because that's a live virus vaccine that's going up everybody's nose
[3:10:05.220 --> 3:10:08.220]  and that you can shed that virus for up to 21 days.
[3:10:08.220 --> 3:10:12.220]  But that I have personally a bigger concern about Tamiflu.
[3:10:12.220 --> 3:10:15.220]  And that I think that Tamiflu, and even in the scientific literature,
[3:10:15.220 --> 3:10:21.220]  talks about 16% of the viruses each year become resistant to Tamiflu.
[3:10:21.220 --> 3:10:24.220]  So if we start creating very resistant mutant viruses
[3:10:24.220 --> 3:10:27.220]  and those mutant viruses get out into the environment and they're resistant
[3:10:27.220 --> 3:10:29.220]  and they start to do this thing called reassortment
[3:10:29.220 --> 3:10:36.220]  and come together and create an even bigger virus that is going to be even more of a problem.
[3:10:36.220 --> 3:10:38.220]  And they sort of agreed with that.
[3:10:38.220 --> 3:10:41.220]  One of the questions that got sent that got asked to me was,
[3:10:41.220 --> 3:10:46.220]  is there any evidence in the medical literature that vaccines have caused harm and problems?
[3:10:46.220 --> 3:10:52.220]  And I was really glad that that came to me because I spend most of my life researching the problems with vaccines
[3:10:52.220 --> 3:10:56.220]  and I know that I've personally done more than 350 articles
[3:10:56.220 --> 3:11:00.220]  that have pulled looking at all the different problems with all of the different vaccines,
[3:11:00.220 --> 3:11:03.220]  particularly hepatitis B, the things with the flu shot,
[3:11:03.220 --> 3:11:06.220]  things with all the different vaccines that can cause problems.
[3:11:06.220 --> 3:11:10.220]  And they can cause problems by about five or six different mechanisms of action.
[3:11:10.220 --> 3:11:14.220]  So I think that there were four other health department officials that were there last night.
[3:11:14.220 --> 3:11:20.220]  They were sitting in the audience and they were, you could tell by the looks on their face
[3:11:20.220 --> 3:11:23.220]  and sort of their body language that they weren't in much agreement
[3:11:23.220 --> 3:11:27.220]  when Don Richardson from Prove and I were doing sort of a back and forth.
[3:11:27.220 --> 3:11:32.220]  But they couldn't deny the fact that there was another whole side of this story.
[3:11:32.220 --> 3:11:36.220]  They couldn't deny the fact that we were telling them what the science and the research was.
[3:11:36.220 --> 3:11:39.220]  They darted and danced around a lot of the issues sometimes
[3:11:39.220 --> 3:11:41.220]  when people were asking them about mandates.
[3:11:41.220 --> 3:11:43.220]  They never did give really straight answers.
[3:11:43.220 --> 3:11:46.220]  And I think that Texas, at least from what they said last night,
[3:11:46.220 --> 3:11:50.220]  and I'm really glad that Alex, that people were there filming this
[3:11:50.220 --> 3:11:56.220]  because they were saying in quite strong language that we're not going to see mandates in Texas.
[3:11:56.220 --> 3:11:58.220]  Flu shots will not be mandated in Texas.
[3:11:58.220 --> 3:12:02.220]  And I think that if there becomes a problem down the road with this flu shot shortage
[3:12:02.220 --> 3:12:06.220]  and if they think it gets worse over the winter and they start pulling this stuff about mandates,
[3:12:06.220 --> 3:12:09.220]  I hope that now you've got recording on footage that you can go back
[3:12:09.220 --> 3:12:13.220]  and challenge them on that to saying that you are backing out on your word.
[3:12:13.220 --> 3:12:18.220]  Just to jump in briefly, the problem is, as you know, they do this color of law.
[3:12:18.220 --> 3:12:22.220]  They tell parents it's mandatory your children take the flu shot.
[3:12:22.220 --> 3:12:25.220]  They've been announcing all children must take it all over the country.
[3:12:25.220 --> 3:12:32.220]  And then they kick your child out saying they violated policy and then trigger truancy laws.
[3:12:32.220 --> 3:12:38.220]  So they kick you out themselves, then they trigger the truancy provision
[3:12:38.220 --> 3:12:42.220]  and then have a few examples of a couple parents they haul into court.
[3:12:42.220 --> 3:12:45.220]  And then the news announced parents have been arrested
[3:12:45.220 --> 3:12:50.220]  or parents have been charged for not vaccinating when really the school knows
[3:12:50.220 --> 3:12:53.220]  they have that vaccine waiver exemption form.
[3:12:53.220 --> 3:12:56.220]  They never tell you and engage in the crime of kicking your child out.
[3:12:56.220 --> 3:12:59.220]  It's like Governor Rick Perry two years ago says it's mandatory.
[3:12:59.220 --> 3:13:05.220]  All girls in Texas must take Gardasil, then federal vaccine liability protection kicks in.
[3:13:05.220 --> 3:13:08.220]  Merck knows in their own trials it killed in Maine people.
[3:13:08.220 --> 3:13:11.220]  Now nationwide they announce all girls must take it.
[3:13:11.220 --> 3:13:15.220]  But really he just said it's a recommended through the health department
[3:13:15.220 --> 3:13:19.220]  that it be listed on the group that they say it's school policy you take.
[3:13:19.220 --> 3:13:23.220]  So they dance around this because with people that are ignorant,
[3:13:23.220 --> 3:13:26.220]  they come in and lie and say you must take these shots.
[3:13:26.220 --> 3:13:30.220]  I mean, I've read reports in mainstream news about parents having their children CPS
[3:13:30.220 --> 3:13:35.220]  taken or trying to take them for not taking hepatitis shots with the newborn baby.
[3:13:35.220 --> 3:13:36.220]  There's no law.
[3:13:36.220 --> 3:13:38.220]  How are they taking your children saying it's neglect?
[3:13:38.220 --> 3:13:42.220]  Can you speak to that? How deceptive these people are?
[3:13:42.220 --> 3:13:45.220]  Yeah, I think it's really important for people to think about that.
[3:13:45.220 --> 3:13:49.220]  I mean, when parents go to the hospitals and they're going to have their baby,
[3:13:49.220 --> 3:13:52.220]  I mean, I always say the place where you need to intercede,
[3:13:52.220 --> 3:13:56.220]  actually at the very beginning place where I think people need to intercede
[3:13:56.220 --> 3:13:59.220]  and investigate the vaccine issue is when they're dating somebody.
[3:13:59.220 --> 3:14:04.220]  Because at that point in time, you're probably talking about how your families get along.
[3:14:04.220 --> 3:14:08.220]  You're talking about religion and politics and money and living and jobs and careers.
[3:14:08.220 --> 3:14:12.220]  You really need to discuss the vaccination issue because it may turn out
[3:14:12.220 --> 3:14:16.220]  that one person in the party is totally against vaccines
[3:14:16.220 --> 3:14:18.220]  and the other person is totally for vaccines.
[3:14:18.220 --> 3:14:21.220]  Now can you imagine getting married and bringing a child into that
[3:14:21.220 --> 3:14:24.220]  and at that point in time having this huge contention?
[3:14:24.220 --> 3:14:27.220]  And I have testified in far too many court cases where that parent,
[3:14:27.220 --> 3:14:32.220]  one parent has tried to use vaccination as a child abuse issue against the other parent
[3:14:32.220 --> 3:14:35.220]  so that they don't have to pay child support.
[3:14:35.220 --> 3:14:37.220]  That happened with Charlie Sheen.
[3:14:37.220 --> 3:14:40.220]  Denise, and I know you know Charlie, you've talked to him.
[3:14:40.220 --> 3:14:43.220]  Denise Richards in the divorce and then in trying to take him away
[3:14:43.220 --> 3:14:47.220]  so he couldn't see him said he believes 9-11 was an inside job
[3:14:47.220 --> 3:14:50.220]  and he believes vaccines might hurt his girls
[3:14:50.220 --> 3:14:54.220]  when it's on record that vaccines have damaged incredible amounts of people.
[3:14:54.220 --> 3:14:55.220]  Absolutely.
[3:14:55.220 --> 3:14:59.220]  So I sort of tell people that before you go to the hospital to have a baby,
[3:14:59.220 --> 3:15:02.220]  you know, you need to know what you want to do about the hepatitis B vaccine,
[3:15:02.220 --> 3:15:05.220]  the vitamin K shot, you know, all of those things.
[3:15:05.220 --> 3:15:07.220]  But I think it really should start before that.
[3:15:07.220 --> 3:15:09.220]  And I actually have a friend in Cleveland who's a nurse midwife
[3:15:09.220 --> 3:15:14.220]  that she will not accept a client as a client
[3:15:14.220 --> 3:15:18.220]  unless both the mother and the father are in agreement about vaccination.
[3:15:18.220 --> 3:15:20.220]  What's your view on the vitamin K?
[3:15:20.220 --> 3:15:25.220]  I think that there are a lot of reasons to put that off.
[3:15:25.220 --> 3:15:28.220]  The vitamin K shot was actually put into play in the hospital
[3:15:28.220 --> 3:15:30.220]  ostensibly because of blood disorders
[3:15:30.220 --> 3:15:35.220]  and because of the very, very remote risk of bleeding that can happen in the brain
[3:15:35.220 --> 3:15:37.220]  if you don't have vitamin K on board.
[3:15:37.220 --> 3:15:41.220]  But vitamin K starts to be developed in the neonatal liver at about seven days.
[3:15:41.220 --> 3:15:45.220]  And the vitamin K shot was also instituted because of circumcision.
[3:15:45.220 --> 3:15:48.220]  The circumcision was always done at seven to eight days.
[3:15:48.220 --> 3:15:52.220]  It was, you know, a Jewish tradition and that they did it at seven days.
[3:15:52.220 --> 3:15:56.220]  When they started doing the circumcision in the hospital on day two and three,
[3:15:56.220 --> 3:16:00.220]  the baby hadn't already been producing enough vitamin K in their liver
[3:16:00.220 --> 3:16:01.220]  so that there would be bleeding.
[3:16:01.220 --> 3:16:04.220]  Isn't it amazing that the rabbis knew thousands of years ago to do it
[3:16:04.220 --> 3:16:06.220]  on seven days when they had blood clotting?
[3:16:06.220 --> 3:16:07.220]  Exactly.
[3:16:07.220 --> 3:16:08.220]  How did they know that?
[3:16:08.220 --> 3:16:11.220]  I don't know how they knew that, but they did.
[3:16:11.220 --> 3:16:12.220]  I don't know.
[3:16:12.220 --> 3:16:14.220]  It was just a tradition.
[3:16:14.220 --> 3:16:15.220]  I mean, there's a lot of things.
[3:16:15.220 --> 3:16:17.220]  I mean, how do we know from years ago?
[3:16:17.220 --> 3:16:18.220]  I don't know how to answer that.
[3:16:18.220 --> 3:16:21.220]  That's amazing.
[3:16:21.220 --> 3:16:25.220]  Let's get into Ukraine and also the adverse reaction reports.
[3:16:25.220 --> 3:16:30.220]  This Washington Redskins cheerleader,
[3:16:30.220 --> 3:16:33.220]  she went to Johns Hopkins, other facilities.
[3:16:33.220 --> 3:16:35.220]  They said, yes, you've gotten this neurological disorder.
[3:16:35.220 --> 3:16:37.220]  The FDA said, yes, this can happen.
[3:16:37.220 --> 3:16:40.220]  And then she went and got some treatments and is getting better.
[3:16:40.220 --> 3:16:42.220]  I know Dale Dudley, 93.7 talk show host.
[3:16:42.220 --> 3:16:47.220]  He took a flu shot and months later got numb in his hands and feet,
[3:16:47.220 --> 3:16:50.220]  started getting paralyzed, started having trouble walking.
[3:16:50.220 --> 3:16:53.220]  He went to a bunch of specialists and medical doctors said,
[3:16:53.220 --> 3:16:55.220]  you had a bad vaccine reaction.
[3:16:55.220 --> 3:16:56.220]  He got better.
[3:16:56.220 --> 3:16:59.220]  Now they're trying to say it's a hoax because she got better.
[3:16:59.220 --> 3:17:01.220]  But the FDA itself says, don't worry.
[3:17:01.220 --> 3:17:04.220]  If you do have a neurological problem, most of the time it gets better.
[3:17:04.220 --> 3:17:06.220]  But they're trying to have it both ways, saying, well,
[3:17:06.220 --> 3:17:10.220]  because Desiree is getting better.
[3:17:10.220 --> 3:17:11.220]  It must be fake.
[3:17:11.220 --> 3:17:13.220]  But then there's all these other reports where they're admitting
[3:17:13.220 --> 3:17:15.220]  it's causing neurological problems.
[3:17:15.220 --> 3:17:17.220]  Yeah, it's always amazing, isn't it?
[3:17:17.220 --> 3:17:22.220]  That if you, if you, if you get sick and you haven't been vaccinated,
[3:17:22.220 --> 3:17:24.220]  it's because you weren't vaccinated.
[3:17:24.220 --> 3:17:27.220]  But if you had a vaccine and you have a bad reaction,
[3:17:27.220 --> 3:17:29.220]  it's never the vaccine.
[3:17:29.220 --> 3:17:31.220]  I mean, talk about having it both ways.
[3:17:31.220 --> 3:17:34.220]  And so, and it's amazing that even though conventional medicine
[3:17:34.220 --> 3:17:37.220]  completely failed this woman and had nothing to offer her.
[3:17:37.220 --> 3:17:39.220]  And then she goes and finds a physician, you know,
[3:17:39.220 --> 3:17:42.220]  who is actually Dr. Butar's a friend of mine.
[3:17:42.220 --> 3:17:45.220]  And they went to his clinic and they find out that there's some things
[3:17:45.220 --> 3:17:48.220]  in an alternative medicine arena that can be done.
[3:17:48.220 --> 3:17:50.220]  And she starts to get better.
[3:17:50.220 --> 3:17:52.220]  That was a hoax. She was misdiagnosed.
[3:17:52.220 --> 3:17:55.220]  It couldn't possibly work because their particular tools didn't work,
[3:17:55.220 --> 3:17:57.220]  means that there aren't any tools that work.
[3:17:57.220 --> 3:17:59.220]  That is very, very bad.
[3:17:59.220 --> 3:18:03.220]  What does Dr. Butar and others, because he helped Jenny McCarthy
[3:18:03.220 --> 3:18:06.220]  and many others, you know, they're, they're trying to,
[3:18:06.220 --> 3:18:09.220]  as Dr. Blalock says, reduce the autoimmune inflammation.
[3:18:09.220 --> 3:18:12.220]  They're trying to chelate and remove the metals.
[3:18:12.220 --> 3:18:14.220]  I mean, what are these treatments?
[3:18:14.220 --> 3:18:16.220]  You know, I'm not exactly sure.
[3:18:16.220 --> 3:18:18.220]  I know that there's a lot of IV treatments that are involved.
[3:18:18.220 --> 3:18:20.220]  You know, it's a lot of what you said.
[3:18:20.220 --> 3:18:23.220]  I think there's a lot of IV vitamin C, probably glutathione,
[3:18:23.220 --> 3:18:26.220]  probably different types of things that pull the metals out of the body.
[3:18:26.220 --> 3:18:30.220]  But it's all about rebalancing the physiology and putting the right biochemistry in
[3:18:30.220 --> 3:18:33.220]  and interceding quickly so that you can stop that,
[3:18:33.220 --> 3:18:36.220]  those inflammatory molecules from causing damage.
[3:18:36.220 --> 3:18:39.220]  And instead of them admitting vaccines, they're causing a lot of this
[3:18:39.220 --> 3:18:42.220]  and giving people treatments when they give their 18 month old the third round of shots,
[3:18:42.220 --> 3:18:45.220]  they have a convulsion, never talk again.
[3:18:45.220 --> 3:18:48.220]  Rushing them in and saying, detox, detox. Oh no, it wasn't a shot.
[3:18:48.220 --> 3:18:51.220]  There's no treatment. You must have shaken your baby.
[3:18:51.220 --> 3:18:53.220]  Yeah. And the other piece of that, you know,
[3:18:53.220 --> 3:18:56.220]  they're always talking about how much the vaccine programs cost.
[3:18:56.220 --> 3:18:59.220]  There's a cost that has never really been analyzed, Alex,
[3:18:59.220 --> 3:19:01.220]  that I think is really important and you've addressed it,
[3:19:01.220 --> 3:19:05.220]  is the fact that if you have a bad reaction and you go to the doctor's office,
[3:19:05.220 --> 3:19:07.220]  now what do they do? They put you through all of these tests
[3:19:07.220 --> 3:19:09.220]  and I'll give you one quick example.
[3:19:09.220 --> 3:19:11.220]  For example, the hepatitis B vaccine that happens in the,
[3:19:11.220 --> 3:19:13.220]  that they give babies in the hospital.
[3:19:13.220 --> 3:19:17.220]  One of the side effects right on the package insert is that babies can get reflux.
[3:19:17.220 --> 3:19:20.220]  They can get GERD. So now they start having GERD and maybe bad diarrhea.
[3:19:20.220 --> 3:19:22.220]  They take them to the pediatrician. What do they do?
[3:19:22.220 --> 3:19:26.220]  Upper GIs, lower NGIs, endoscopy. They do CAT scans.
[3:19:26.220 --> 3:19:30.220]  They do all these different antibiotics, all these different things to this baby
[3:19:30.220 --> 3:19:33.220]  rather than going, oh, here it says right here on the package insert,
[3:19:33.220 --> 3:19:36.220]  this is a side effect, probably just a side effect to the vaccine.
[3:19:36.220 --> 3:19:40.220]  All of those costs, thousands and thousands of thousands of dollars
[3:19:40.220 --> 3:19:45.220]  of inconclusive tests on multiply that times thousands and thousands of patients.
[3:19:45.220 --> 3:19:50.220]  That is also a cost to the vaccine system or to about vaccines.
[3:19:50.220 --> 3:19:53.220]  Well, I've talked to old pediatricians that saw kids 50 years ago.
[3:19:53.220 --> 3:19:57.220]  They say babies are different today. Something's wrong with them.
[3:19:57.220 --> 3:19:59.220]  I mean, they got dull eyes. They're getting brain damage.
[3:19:59.220 --> 3:20:00.220]  But it starts before babies.
[3:20:00.220 --> 3:20:02.220]  Stay right there. We're coming back.
[3:20:02.220 --> 3:20:04.220]  This is an emergency alert.
[3:20:04.220 --> 3:20:10.220]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[3:20:10.220 --> 3:20:14.220]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert,
[3:20:14.220 --> 3:20:19.220]  urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[3:20:19.220 --> 3:20:22.220]  Rely on oxysilver instead.
[3:20:22.220 --> 3:20:28.220]  Oxysilver's broad spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[3:20:28.220 --> 3:20:33.220]  Oxysilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[3:20:33.220 --> 3:20:38.220]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[3:20:38.220 --> 3:20:42.220]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[3:20:42.220 --> 3:20:44.220]  So get it while you still can.
[3:20:44.220 --> 3:20:48.220]  Order oxysilver online at oxysilver.com.

[3:21:02.220 --> 3:21:07.220]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:21:07.220 --> 3:21:10.220]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:21:10.220 --> 3:21:15.220]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[3:21:15.220 --> 3:21:21.220]  I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[3:21:21.220 --> 3:21:26.220]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:21:26.220 --> 3:21:34.220]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty,
[3:21:34.220 --> 3:21:36.220]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:21:36.220 --> 3:21:40.220]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[3:21:40.220 --> 3:21:43.220]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:21:43.220 --> 3:21:45.220]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[3:21:45.220 --> 3:21:50.220]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[3:21:50.220 --> 3:21:56.220]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.

[3:22:01.220 --> 3:22:08.220]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[3:22:08.220 --> 3:22:13.220]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[3:22:13.220 --> 3:22:17.220]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[3:22:17.220 --> 3:22:21.220]  Let's put this another way. Who cares if your investments go up 10%?
[3:22:21.220 --> 3:22:24.220]  But you lose 40% of your purchasing power.
[3:22:24.220 --> 3:22:27.220]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[3:22:27.220 --> 3:22:29.220]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[3:22:29.220 --> 3:22:32.220]  You can possess it in your hand. You can take it with you.
[3:22:32.220 --> 3:22:35.220]  Gold is real money. Gold is honest money.
[3:22:35.220 --> 3:22:38.220]  My name is Daniel Arson from Midas Resources.

[3:24:07.220 --> 3:24:12.220]  Dr. Sherry Tinpin is our guest in studio. A lot of ground to cover in a short time.
[3:24:12.220 --> 3:24:16.220]  Ukraine, you said at the start of the interview, and we got cut off by the break,
[3:24:16.220 --> 3:24:20.220]  that you're really concerned about what's happening over there, that they may be getting ready to release something else.
[3:24:20.220 --> 3:24:26.220]  They may have released something that this huge buildup in and around a medical emergency is really perfect for the establishment,
[3:24:26.220 --> 3:24:31.220]  especially with the economic collapse, this global realignment, what's happening with the dollar.
[3:24:31.220 --> 3:24:32.220]  Please continue.
[3:24:32.220 --> 3:24:37.220]  I'm just concerned that there's another virus that's come into play, because when you look at those numbers,
[3:24:37.220 --> 3:24:42.220]  if you can believe them at all, and there is a couple of really good sites that I looked at that looked at the numbers
[3:24:42.220 --> 3:24:46.220]  and how exponentially that there was more and more people getting sick in a very short period of time.
[3:24:46.220 --> 3:24:50.220]  I mean, was it something in the air? Was it something that was released?
[3:24:50.220 --> 3:24:53.220]  Was it one of these mutant viruses that we talked about in terms of Tamiflu?
[3:24:53.220 --> 3:25:00.220]  That now maybe the H1N1 and the H5N1 and maybe one of these mutant viruses has started to re-assort,
[3:25:00.220 --> 3:25:05.220]  and that there is really something a lot more virulent that's going on?
[3:25:05.220 --> 3:25:10.220]  Because with your supercomputers, they know how it's going to mutate in enough of a population.
[3:25:10.220 --> 3:25:18.220]  They admit that the nasal was live and could mutate and be spread. Why did they put out the first H1N1 vaccine nasal?
[3:25:18.220 --> 3:25:23.220]  Well, I think that was warm for convenience. I think that that was kind of an easy thing to do,
[3:25:23.220 --> 3:25:26.220]  but it really does spread around in the population.
[3:25:26.220 --> 3:25:29.220]  What do we know about this virus in Ukraine? I mean, is it a flu virus? What is it?
[3:25:29.220 --> 3:25:30.220]  Nobody seems to know.
[3:25:30.220 --> 3:25:32.220]  They just say, oh, it's killing people.
[3:25:32.220 --> 3:25:36.220]  Exactly. And the World Health Organization sent a bunch of people down there that they ostensibly said,
[3:25:36.220 --> 3:25:40.220]  it's the H1N1 virus. It's just the novel one we've been talking about, nothing to be concerned about.
[3:25:40.220 --> 3:25:45.220]  But that is not the way that that virus has behaved over the course of the last eight months.
[3:25:45.220 --> 3:25:48.220]  You know, when we see the reports coming out of the southern hemisphere,
[3:25:48.220 --> 3:25:52.220]  we didn't have people that exponentially number of people getting sick in a very short period of time.
[3:25:52.220 --> 3:25:57.220]  So I think that there's something else that's happening there that I think there's still some missing pieces,
[3:25:57.220 --> 3:25:59.220]  but I'm sure it's a story that will evolve.
[3:25:59.220 --> 3:26:03.220]  Well, that's what happened in January as we had emergency managers in Indiana, New York.
[3:26:03.220 --> 3:26:07.220]  I got internal secret documents that were later confirmed in New York,
[3:26:07.220 --> 3:26:10.220]  where they were telling to cemeteries, get ready for millions dead.
[3:26:10.220 --> 3:26:13.220]  That was in January, March, January, February, March.
[3:26:13.220 --> 3:26:17.220]  And I went on air and I said, they're coming with some type of big flu hype.
[3:26:17.220 --> 3:26:22.220]  I don't know if it's going to be real. It may just be hype, but they're really building up like we've never seen.
[3:26:22.220 --> 3:26:25.220]  And we never saw flu pandemics coming this quickly.
[3:26:25.220 --> 3:26:29.220]  Now they're coming in shorter and shorter increments, aren't they?
[3:26:29.220 --> 3:26:34.220]  You know, Alex, I have a document on my computer that was from 2003 that was released.
[3:26:34.220 --> 3:26:40.220]  It was a small little report that came out from the CIA that actually said that they were very concerned
[3:26:40.220 --> 3:26:46.220]  that there was going to be the development of a virus down the road that could be activated by a second virus
[3:26:46.220 --> 3:26:51.220]  and that there would be no way, there was a bioterrorism website and they had no way of knowing
[3:26:51.220 --> 3:26:55.220]  and there would be no way to be able to control that if there was a virus that had been released
[3:26:55.220 --> 3:27:00.220]  and then a second virus would activate it and it may be even activated by taking aspirin.
[3:27:00.220 --> 3:27:03.220]  I'll get you that report because it was just a small little report.
[3:27:03.220 --> 3:27:05.220]  I stumbled across it on my computer the other day.
[3:27:05.220 --> 3:27:08.220]  Why does aspirin activate so many things?
[3:27:08.220 --> 3:27:13.220]  I don't really know. I think it really has to do with the way that it interferes with the cytokine reactions.
[3:27:13.220 --> 3:27:18.220]  But it really has, it causes all sorts of reactions into the bloodstream.
[3:27:18.220 --> 3:27:23.220]  But you know this, that if aspirin was developed today, it would not be an over-the-counter drug.
[3:27:23.220 --> 3:27:27.220]  I mean it would be a prescription because of how many different effects it has on the body.
[3:27:27.220 --> 3:27:28.220]  Some good, some bad.
[3:27:28.220 --> 3:27:31.220]  Some good, some bad. Mostly bad.
[3:27:31.220 --> 3:27:39.220]  Well that's incredible because they admit Tamiflu has all these bad reactions and is highly restricted in Japan.
[3:27:39.220 --> 3:27:46.220]  They're just giving it to everybody like it's candy and just like antibiotics make bacteria mutate quicker.
[3:27:46.220 --> 3:27:50.220]  I guess in a layman's terms that's what these antivirals do.
[3:27:50.220 --> 3:27:51.220]  Absolutely.
[3:27:51.220 --> 3:27:54.220]  And the World Health Organization talks about this.
[3:27:54.220 --> 3:28:01.220]  I mean every month they come out with reports that there is now an H1N1 virus that has been identified in a particular country
[3:28:01.220 --> 3:28:05.220]  like South Vietnam or Thailand or China or places that it's resistant.
[3:28:05.220 --> 3:28:12.220]  They know that last year the H1N1 strain in the seasonal flu virus was 100% resistant to Tamiflu.
[3:28:12.220 --> 3:28:17.220]  Well that had to have happened because we used a lot of Tamiflu previous to that.
[3:28:17.220 --> 3:28:23.220]  So it's going to happen. I mean it has to happen that these viruses are going to mutate and morph around.
[3:28:23.220 --> 3:28:27.220]  You can't be fooling with Mother Nature like we do and not expect to have a bad outcome.
[3:28:27.220 --> 3:28:29.220]  Okay I've been asking a lot of the questions.
[3:28:29.220 --> 3:28:34.220]  When we come back before we take calls, whatever you think is most important I'd like you to speak about.
[3:28:34.220 --> 3:28:40.220]  And then also again the victory of the fact that people are waking up to this push for forced inoculation.
[3:28:40.220 --> 3:28:43.220]  You know this huge brainwashing campaign.
[3:28:43.220 --> 3:28:49.220]  So that's positive but also on the negative side the fact that the government would try to push this globally
[3:28:49.220 --> 3:28:52.220]  and the UN is in control of the situation. That's scary.
[3:28:52.220 --> 3:28:58.220]  It's very scary. It's very frightening and people really, you know it's so good Alex that we're able to talk about things like this.
[3:28:58.220 --> 3:29:04.220]  It's so good that people are taking an active role in investigating for themselves and just saying no.
[3:29:04.220 --> 3:29:08.220]  I think all the people now that are willing to take flu shots, I mean they're in the minority.
[3:29:08.220 --> 3:29:13.220]  We've got more people saying no I don't want this. There are other things I can do to keep myself healthy.
[3:29:13.220 --> 3:29:19.220]  I can do vitamin D, vitamin C, there's herbals, there's oregano oil, there's all sorts of things that are out there.
[3:29:19.220 --> 3:29:26.220]  Even simple things, getting plenty of sleep, you know drinking good water, getting plenty of organic food as much as you can.
[3:29:26.220 --> 3:29:29.220]  There's all sorts of things you can do. Sunshine, absolutely.
[3:29:29.220 --> 3:29:34.220]  Except if you know if you are north of the 37th parallel in the winter time,
[3:29:34.220 --> 3:29:40.220]  they've actually shown that even if you are outside in the sunshine in the winter time north of the 37th parallel,
[3:29:40.220 --> 3:29:44.220]  which is like if you take a line from San Francisco and sort of draw it straight across the country,
[3:29:44.220 --> 3:29:49.220]  the sun isn't strong enough to give you enough vitamin D that you need to keep yourself healthy in the winter.
[3:29:49.220 --> 3:29:51.220]  Okay, we got a break. We'll come right back.
[3:29:51.220 --> 3:29:59.220]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:59.220 --> 3:30:06.220]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:30:06.220 --> 3:30:11.220]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[3:30:11.220 --> 3:30:16.220]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[3:30:16.220 --> 3:30:19.220]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love,

[3:31:55.220 --> 3:32:20.220]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[3:32:20.220 --> 3:32:27.220]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[3:32:27.220 --> 3:32:31.220]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:32:31.220 --> 3:32:34.220]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[3:32:34.220 --> 3:32:38.220]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[3:32:38.220 --> 3:32:43.220]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:32:43.220 --> 3:32:48.220]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[3:32:48.220 --> 3:32:54.220]  To get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[3:32:54.220 --> 3:33:02.220]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[3:33:02.220 --> 3:33:20.220]  We're launching something new. Several times during the radio show every day, we're going to come back into segments, playing one-minute comments from listeners.
[3:33:20.220 --> 3:33:26.220]  Questions, comments, you agree, you disagree, just make it short and sweet and focused, and we're going to air the good ones.
[3:33:26.220 --> 3:33:36.220]  The comment line is 512-646-4444, 512-646-4444, and you'll start hearing these tomorrow on air.
[3:33:36.220 --> 3:33:43.220]  512-646-4444. A lot of other shows do this. I've done this many years ago.
[3:33:43.220 --> 3:33:50.220]  We're going to bring this back to the show. Continuing here, I want to tell you about a few sponsors that have made today's broadcast possible.
[3:33:50.220 --> 3:33:56.220]  We're going to hit a few final key points with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny. Tell you about some of the books and materials she has available.
[3:33:56.220 --> 3:34:01.220]  Rob do's idea for her to put out a line of t-shirts to educate folks. They've done it. They're very handsome.
[3:34:01.220 --> 3:34:05.220]  She brought me some. We'll show you those. I want to support the work she's doing so she can do this full time.
[3:34:05.220 --> 3:34:11.220]  As she says, there's money making work, being a doctor, and then her own money flying all over the country trying to educate people.
[3:34:11.220 --> 3:34:17.220]  She's a wonderful lady, so we want to financially support her. And our sponsors that financially support us.
[3:34:17.220 --> 3:34:24.220]  One of them is Diginet.net. You get 10% off the Diginet pins. It's a little pin. You press one button. It shoots audio and video.
[3:34:24.220 --> 3:34:31.220]  10% off right now when you go to the Diginet.net website. That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net.

[3:34:36.220 --> 3:34:41.220]  E-T-F-O-9 is the product code to get 10% off E-T-F-O-9.
[3:34:41.220 --> 3:34:50.220]  Or give them a call and tell them Alex Jones sent you 888-344-6681. That's 888-344-6681.
[3:34:50.220 --> 3:34:59.220]  And I also want to tell the listeners out there about FrontSite, FrontSite.com, like the front of your rifle site.
[3:34:59.220 --> 3:35:03.220]  Premier firearms, handgun, rifle, shotgun training for the whole family.
[3:35:03.220 --> 3:35:07.220]  No drill instructor attitude above law enforcement and military training.
[3:35:07.220 --> 3:35:12.220]  A lot of law enforcement and military train there. They have a lot of free info on their site as well, FrontSite.com.
[3:35:12.220 --> 3:35:18.220]  You can get a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice by going to FrontSite.com.
[3:35:18.220 --> 3:35:24.220]  Again, that's FrontSite.com. Find out about their free offers there at FrontSite.com.
[3:35:24.220 --> 3:35:34.220]  And lastly today with our sponsors, we want to tell you about AkolaBlue.com.
[3:35:34.220 --> 3:35:39.220]  AkolaBlue, did you know you could be drinking fresh clean water made right from the air you breathe?
[3:35:39.220 --> 3:35:45.220]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book. Our sponsor, AkolaBlue, with the AkolaBlue 28 machine will allow you to do just that.
[3:35:45.220 --> 3:35:49.220]  It's easy to use and it will make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day.
[3:35:49.220 --> 3:35:55.220]  The water once generated passes through a seven stage filtering process including reverse osmosis and carbon filtration techniques.
[3:35:55.220 --> 3:36:00.220]  Ensuring that you know exactly what you were drinking. No chemicals, pollutants or fluoride.
[3:36:00.220 --> 3:36:08.220]  We spend so much time talking about on this show. Get your own source of unlimited renewable drinking water that's absolutely clean for you and your family today
[3:36:08.220 --> 3:36:14.220]  by visiting them online at AkolaBlue.com or by clicking on the banners at InfoWars.com and PrismPlanet.com
[3:36:14.220 --> 3:36:22.220]  or give AkolaBlue.com a call at 800-691-6043. And again, I want to thank all those great sponsors for making today's show possible.
[3:36:22.220 --> 3:36:26.220]  Before we go any further, share with my last few questions before we take some calls.
[3:36:26.220 --> 3:36:31.220]  Tell folks again about your multiple websites that have all this great information on them.
[3:36:31.220 --> 3:36:34.220]  And the book that we carry, incidentally, you can also get it at her sites.
[3:36:34.220 --> 3:36:38.220]  Fowl revised and updated dealing with what's happening now.
[3:36:38.220 --> 3:36:45.220]  Breaking down, exposing the hidden agenda, the agribusiness drug company connection, the role of the environment in making the birds sick
[3:36:45.220 --> 3:36:48.220]  and what was really behind the 1918 pandemic.
[3:36:48.220 --> 3:36:52.220]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, Fowl, a best seller. Dr.
[3:36:52.220 --> 3:36:56.220]  Well, thank you, Alex, for talking about that because that book was written in 2006.
[3:36:56.220 --> 3:37:00.220]  And one of the main things, even though the title of the book talks about bird flu,
[3:37:00.220 --> 3:37:04.220]  it really is a playbook of exactly what's going on now.
[3:37:04.220 --> 3:37:10.220]  So if you want to know about the specifics about Tamiflu, how that vaccines are made, the cell line technologies, the eggs,
[3:37:10.220 --> 3:37:12.220]  all of those different things, it's all in that book.
[3:37:12.220 --> 3:37:16.220]  And all of the backdrop in terms of the politics, there's a whole chapter on mandatory vaccination.
[3:37:16.220 --> 3:37:22.220]  And so it's very timely information, even though it was published at the time that the bird flu was coming out.
[3:37:22.220 --> 3:37:23.220]  It's really, really timely.
[3:37:23.220 --> 3:37:25.220]  Then the other book is saying no to vaccines.
[3:37:25.220 --> 3:37:29.220]  And it's a resource guide for all ages.
[3:37:29.220 --> 3:37:33.220]  It's the refuting the 25 most common reasons people think you should vaccinate.
[3:37:33.220 --> 3:37:36.220]  So you can just scan down the table of contents.
[3:37:36.220 --> 3:37:40.220]  You can look at a particular question and you can go to that page and just read it.
[3:37:40.220 --> 3:37:45.220]  And then there's a footnoted reference right there that you can print out and hand to anybody that you want.
[3:37:45.220 --> 3:37:50.220]  And there's nobody out there as focused and professional as Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[3:37:50.220 --> 3:37:56.220]  When it comes to exposing these frauds, these scams, these new rule order operations, it's just wonderful.
[3:37:56.220 --> 3:38:03.220]  We were talking during the break with the emails pouring in about people's husbands, their wives dying, having heart attacks right after the shot.
[3:38:03.220 --> 3:38:10.220]  And Reuters a month ago, who by the way are involved in some of the companies, some of the owners of Reuters are involved in some of the vaccine makers.
[3:38:10.220 --> 3:38:15.220]  They put out a headline saying millions will die of heart attacks and autoimmune disorders and being paralyzed.
[3:38:15.220 --> 3:38:19.220]  That happens normally just because you think the shot did it.
[3:38:19.220 --> 3:38:23.220]  We are mass diagnosing all of you.
[3:38:23.220 --> 3:38:27.220]  None of this happened from the vaccines, even though their own inserts admit it.
[3:38:27.220 --> 3:38:32.220]  I remember and you wrote about this, but the mainstream media had to later admit it when Tommy Thompson had a health of human services.
[3:38:32.220 --> 3:38:37.220]  He wouldn't even take it when all these people taking it were having heart attacks.
[3:38:37.220 --> 3:38:41.220]  And now we're seeing similar reports with this happening with the flu shot.
[3:38:41.220 --> 3:38:43.220]  Why is this happening?
[3:38:43.220 --> 3:38:50.220]  Well, the live flu vaccines, particularly the swine flu vaccine, when we talked about doing that after 9-11 and they were going to, they've done it to the military.
[3:38:50.220 --> 3:38:53.220]  They were going to do it to first responders, all the healthcare workers.
[3:38:53.220 --> 3:38:58.220]  Well, the swine flu shot or I'm sorry, the smallpox vaccine was injecting a live virus.
[3:38:58.220 --> 3:39:04.220]  That live virus was actually shown to cause hyperquagulability, which means it makes your blood clot.
[3:39:04.220 --> 3:39:09.220]  And people were dying from blood clots to the lungs, blood clots to the heart and heart attacks.
[3:39:09.220 --> 3:39:16.220]  Well, this flu mass vaccine in the one that goes up the nose is a live flu, it's a live virus.
[3:39:16.220 --> 3:39:18.220]  It's a weakened virus, but it's a live virus.
[3:39:18.220 --> 3:39:22.220]  I'm injecting all of these flu shots into the body can do that.
[3:39:22.220 --> 3:39:25.220]  And I really think that there's a lot of information that's going to be coming out.
[3:39:25.220 --> 3:39:28.220]  It's the new ploy that the vaccine industry is doing.
[3:39:28.220 --> 3:39:31.220]  I mean, first they used to say you had to vaccinate so you wouldn't get sick.
[3:39:31.220 --> 3:39:35.220]  And then they said, well, you've got to get vaccinated so nobody, so you can protect everybody around you.
[3:39:35.220 --> 3:39:39.220]  And then they said, no, you got to get vaccinated so that it will save money.
[3:39:39.220 --> 3:39:42.220]  So if you get vaccinated and you don't get sick, we won't have to put you in the hospital.
[3:39:42.220 --> 3:39:45.220]  And now they're saying, well, we know all these vaccine reactions are going to happen.
[3:39:45.220 --> 3:39:51.220]  So we're going to look at populations and find out what the baseline incidences of having things like Guillain-Barre and heart attacks.
[3:39:51.220 --> 3:39:55.220]  And so when we start having flu vaccines that happen and people are getting sick from them,
[3:39:55.220 --> 3:39:58.220]  well, we've already got the statistics to say that can't be the flu shot.
[3:39:58.220 --> 3:39:59.220]  It has to be something else.
[3:39:59.220 --> 3:40:03.220]  So it's anything in the world to vaccinate everybody with everything.
[3:40:03.220 --> 3:40:05.220]  We've got every microbe out there.
[3:40:05.220 --> 3:40:09.220]  You know, I always tell people, it's like, if you're living in your house and you have animals,
[3:40:09.220 --> 3:40:12.220]  I mean, how many bugs do you think are crawling around in your living room floor?
[3:40:12.220 --> 3:40:15.220]  Do you have dogs or cats or horses or guinea pigs?
[3:40:15.220 --> 3:40:16.220]  Or you go to the playground?
[3:40:16.220 --> 3:40:19.220]  Are you sitting in a, in a, like the conference that we had last night?
[3:40:19.220 --> 3:40:23.220]  The only bugs that we seem to have much concern about are the ones we have vaccines for.
[3:40:23.220 --> 3:40:27.220]  And if you don't have a vaccine for it, then I guess your body does a pretty good job keeping you.
[3:40:27.220 --> 3:40:29.220]  And they've got hundreds of vaccines in the pipe.
[3:40:29.220 --> 3:40:32.220]  They've gone from a dozen to 30 to 40 to 50 to 60.
[3:40:32.220 --> 3:40:34.220]  They want to force us to take.
[3:40:34.220 --> 3:40:36.220]  This is an amazing business plan.
[3:40:36.220 --> 3:40:38.220]  Big Pharma comes, lobbies, government.
[3:40:38.220 --> 3:40:43.220]  They shove it on you, force it on kids, any captive population, force it on prisoners.
[3:40:43.220 --> 3:40:45.220]  I mean, this is a great business.
[3:40:45.220 --> 3:40:46.220]  Yeah. And they did.
[3:40:46.220 --> 3:40:50.220]  There was a report that just came out a couple of days ago that they said by 2014,
[3:40:50.220 --> 3:40:51.220]  that's just a couple of years away.
[3:40:51.220 --> 3:40:56.220]  By 2014, there will be 75 more vaccines that will be all ready to go.
[3:40:56.220 --> 3:40:57.220]  75.
[3:40:57.220 --> 3:41:02.220]  And they're for things like addiction and stop smoking and obesity and all these different...
[3:41:02.220 --> 3:41:04.220]  Oh, by the way, I've had scientists on about that.
[3:41:04.220 --> 3:41:09.220]  Some of these anti-drug vaccines that you won't want cigarettes, you won't want cocaine,
[3:41:09.220 --> 3:41:14.220]  you won't want opium, opiate type drugs, you know, the painkillers.
[3:41:14.220 --> 3:41:19.220]  They admit that it's a virus that goes in and actually attacks some of the receptors
[3:41:19.220 --> 3:41:21.220]  and gives you a type of lobotomy.
[3:41:21.220 --> 3:41:27.220]  And then they have others that attack the chemical reaction in the body and it creates plaques
[3:41:27.220 --> 3:41:28.220]  in the brains.
[3:41:28.220 --> 3:41:32.220]  I mean, my God, these new systems, I don't even think should be called.
[3:41:32.220 --> 3:41:35.220]  And many scientists have said on the show shouldn't be called vaccines.
[3:41:35.220 --> 3:41:37.220]  These are almost like nanobots.
[3:41:37.220 --> 3:41:45.220]  These are almost like nanotech, you know, the incredible voyage going in and actually rewiring
[3:41:45.220 --> 3:41:46.220]  the brain.
[3:41:46.220 --> 3:41:51.220]  And a lot of scientists have said if this keeps you from being able to absorb opiates or nicotine
[3:41:51.220 --> 3:41:57.220]  or other drugs, all of those opiates and all of those chemicals, they're mimicking different
[3:41:57.220 --> 3:42:00.220]  endorphins, different normal chemicals in the brain.
[3:42:00.220 --> 3:42:03.220]  Dr. Blalock, top brain scientist, has talked about this here.
[3:42:03.220 --> 3:42:05.220]  And I mean, so now they're setting the precedent.
[3:42:05.220 --> 3:42:09.220]  I was watching G.I. Joe, you know, the kid's movie the other day on the treadmill and it
[3:42:09.220 --> 3:42:10.220]  was all pro-war propaganda.
[3:42:10.220 --> 3:42:15.220]  But the evil Cobra Commander is injecting people with nanobots that make them their slaves.
[3:42:15.220 --> 3:42:18.220]  Well, that's basically what they're talking about now.
[3:42:18.220 --> 3:42:22.220]  I mean, my God, you're going to take something where you can't even absorb your regular endorphins.
[3:42:22.220 --> 3:42:25.220]  But don't worry, we'll have a drug that replaces that.
[3:42:25.220 --> 3:42:26.220]  Yeah.
[3:42:26.220 --> 3:42:32.220]  It's like all the humans have become is a repository for the products of the pharmaceutical
[3:42:32.220 --> 3:42:36.220]  industry, whether that product is a vaccine or a drug or some other type of chemical.
[3:42:36.220 --> 3:42:38.220]  We are a repository for that.
[3:42:38.220 --> 3:42:42.220]  And how much more can we actually keep putting in and putting in and putting in before we
[3:42:42.220 --> 3:42:47.220]  have just, it's one big bio experiment that breaks everybody's health down and we just
[3:42:47.220 --> 3:42:48.220]  can't live.
[3:42:48.220 --> 3:42:50.220]  We just can't survive that.
[3:42:50.220 --> 3:42:54.220]  Well, I mean, you've done all this research in some of major universities that we are
[3:42:54.220 --> 3:43:00.220]  seeing a massive increase in allergies because the vaccines cause an autoimmune response
[3:43:00.220 --> 3:43:06.220]  and it causes all sorts of interactions because of the RNA, the fungus things that get into
[3:43:06.220 --> 3:43:08.220]  the vaccine preparation.
[3:43:08.220 --> 3:43:12.220]  And so your body's just fighting, fighting and starts having responses to everything.
[3:43:12.220 --> 3:43:13.220]  Yeah.
[3:43:13.220 --> 3:43:16.220]  And they create things like some of the additives like gelatin.
[3:43:16.220 --> 3:43:20.220]  They know for sure that gelatin that is in some of the flu shots and in the chicken pox
[3:43:20.220 --> 3:43:23.220]  vaccine causes allergies and allergic reactions.
[3:43:23.220 --> 3:43:27.220]  They know polysorbate 80 causes allergic reactions and it also can cause anaphylaxis.
[3:43:27.220 --> 3:43:33.220]  It can cause infertility and female mice and that that additive is in the DPT vaccine
[3:43:33.220 --> 3:43:35.220]  and it's in the new Gardasil vaccine.
[3:43:35.220 --> 3:43:41.220]  It's just one big scientific, it's like a big test tube experimental vaccination Petri
[3:43:41.220 --> 3:43:42.220]  dish.
[3:43:42.220 --> 3:43:45.220]  And it says, though, we can just, they can just put more and more and more in us and
[3:43:45.220 --> 3:43:46.220]  that seems to be okay.
[3:43:46.220 --> 3:43:51.220]  Well, what about hundreds of peer reviewed major studies showing that all the different
[3:43:51.220 --> 3:43:58.220]  rodents they give vaccines to different types develop early onset of unnatural arthritis?
[3:43:58.220 --> 3:44:03.220]  I mean, the reports about people having heart attacks, how does that happen?
[3:44:03.220 --> 3:44:07.220]  They speak about the arthritis and then the, the cardiovascular problems.
[3:44:07.220 --> 3:44:11.220]  Well, the arthritis, it's really about, there's, there's a bunch of different things.
[3:44:11.220 --> 3:44:15.220]  I like to use the analogy, Alex, it's sort of like if you take a little mini bomb, a
[3:44:15.220 --> 3:44:19.220]  little, like a little, little cherry bomb out in your backyard and you put it underneath
[3:44:19.220 --> 3:44:23.220]  a pile of leaves and you set it off and then the leaves go poof and fly up all over the
[3:44:23.220 --> 3:44:24.220]  place.
[3:44:24.220 --> 3:44:27.220]  That's kind of what happens when you put a vaccine into your immune system and into
[3:44:27.220 --> 3:44:31.220]  your, the, all of these cytokine pathways and how they all talk to each other just like
[3:44:31.220 --> 3:44:35.220]  blows them up and just causes everything to go into a disarray.
[3:44:35.220 --> 3:44:37.220]  We can't keep doing this with impunity.
[3:44:37.220 --> 3:44:38.220]  We just can't.
[3:44:38.220 --> 3:44:40.220]  Because our bodies meant to have small amounts of things.
[3:44:40.220 --> 3:44:45.220]  They beat not injected directly into it a whole, which is brew of venom.
[3:44:45.220 --> 3:44:50.220]  The new, the new mantra and the new argument in the vaccine world about particularly about
[3:44:50.220 --> 3:44:54.220]  mercury is when they say that, you know, you can get more mercury out of eating a can of
[3:44:54.220 --> 3:44:57.220]  tuna fish than you can from getting an injection in the vaccine.
[3:44:57.220 --> 3:44:59.220]  That's their new little sound bite to try to dismiss all.
[3:44:59.220 --> 3:45:03.220]  And we got the CFR clip where they said, we're going to use this and we're going to say
[3:45:03.220 --> 3:45:04.220]  there's a shortage.
[3:45:04.220 --> 3:45:05.220]  Exactly.
[3:45:05.220 --> 3:45:07.220]  And they laugh about it, manipulating us.
[3:45:07.220 --> 3:45:08.220]  Yeah, they do.
[3:45:08.220 --> 3:45:12.220]  And it's the differences between ingesting and injecting.
[3:45:12.220 --> 3:45:16.220]  You can ingest a little bit of mercury in a tuna fish and more than likely it's going
[3:45:16.220 --> 3:45:17.220]  to go out in your stool.
[3:45:17.220 --> 3:45:19.220]  You inject that into your body.
[3:45:19.220 --> 3:45:21.220]  It will eventually get absorbed and get, go into your brain.
[3:45:21.220 --> 3:45:27.220]  You can ingest fish oils and you can ingest oils like shark oil, but you inject shark oil,
[3:45:27.220 --> 3:45:31.220]  which is what the squalene adjuvant is, and it's a completely different ballgame.
[3:45:31.220 --> 3:45:37.220]  And I've read the medical literature, but, but they describe how mercury bound to food,
[3:45:37.220 --> 3:45:39.220]  99% of it goes out, but injected.
[3:45:39.220 --> 3:45:41.220]  It goes right over the blood brain barrier.
[3:45:41.220 --> 3:45:42.220]  Exactly.
[3:45:42.220 --> 3:45:43.220]  And children, am I correct, doctor?
[3:45:43.220 --> 3:45:46.220]  For the first few years don't have that blood brain barrier properly.
[3:45:46.220 --> 3:45:49.220]  Well, they do have a blood brain barrier, but I think it's a little bit leakier.
[3:45:49.220 --> 3:45:52.220]  I mean, they don't have it quite as it's, it's leakier.
[3:45:52.220 --> 3:45:55.220]  So the possibility of things going across the blood brain barrier.
[3:45:55.220 --> 3:46:00.220]  And with the new flu, with the flumus vaccine, the one that goes up the nose that has MSG
[3:46:00.220 --> 3:46:01.220]  in it.
[3:46:01.220 --> 3:46:06.220]  So MSG, which is an acytotoxin in the brain, which can go right up the olfactory nose and
[3:46:06.220 --> 3:46:07.220]  right into the brain tissue.
[3:46:07.220 --> 3:46:11.220]  What I'm wanting to know is who's going to follow the brain reactions that could possibly
[3:46:11.220 --> 3:46:16.220]  happen down the road from injecting big water viruses and MSG right up the nose.
[3:46:16.220 --> 3:46:19.220]  But the medical system has an incentive to cover all this up.
[3:46:19.220 --> 3:46:23.220]  I mean, even the doctors who are giving the shots, they want to be in denial.
[3:46:23.220 --> 3:46:25.220]  They don't want to admit they're part of.
[3:46:25.220 --> 3:46:26.220]  No.
[3:46:26.220 --> 3:46:28.220]  And they've got liability protection too.
[3:46:28.220 --> 3:46:30.220]  I mean, it's anybody that's involved down line from that.
[3:46:30.220 --> 3:46:35.220]  They all have liability protection for anything that may be going on with, with the vaccines.
[3:46:35.220 --> 3:46:36.220]  Okay.
[3:46:36.220 --> 3:46:37.220]  I want to take calls now.
[3:46:37.220 --> 3:46:38.220]  Please have a quick question or comment.
[3:46:38.220 --> 3:46:42.220]  I'm sure we'll probably have horror stories of people being paralyzed or killed that are
[3:46:42.220 --> 3:46:43.220]  flooding in.
[3:46:43.220 --> 3:46:46.220]  But Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air with Dr. Sherry Tinpenny.
[3:46:46.220 --> 3:46:47.220]  Thanks for calling.
[3:46:47.220 --> 3:46:48.220]  Thanks, sir.
[3:46:48.220 --> 3:46:49.220]  Thanks for the great debate last night.
[3:46:49.220 --> 3:46:54.220]  The follow up to related ideas by awakening fellow citizens about these dangerously untested
[3:46:54.220 --> 3:46:55.220]  experimental vaccines.
[3:46:55.220 --> 3:47:00.220]  Is it not our great opportunity right now to open their minds about organic farming freedom
[3:47:00.220 --> 3:47:03.220]  for knowledge about organic farming to help families?
[3:47:03.220 --> 3:47:04.220]  Yes.
[3:47:04.220 --> 3:47:05.220]  Yes, Ronnie.
[3:47:05.220 --> 3:47:06.220]  I appreciate your call.
[3:47:06.220 --> 3:47:08.220]  We've got to get on the offensive against this whole system.
[3:47:08.220 --> 3:47:10.220]  And he made me think of something.
[3:47:10.220 --> 3:47:13.220]  He just brought up the fact because I talked to you off here.
[3:47:13.220 --> 3:47:18.220]  You said the majority of people were on your side at the event and the undecideds that
[3:47:18.220 --> 3:47:20.220]  they woke up by the end of it.
[3:47:20.220 --> 3:47:21.220]  Yeah.
[3:47:21.220 --> 3:47:23.220]  I thought that the people that were there last night, that the vast majority of them,
[3:47:23.220 --> 3:47:27.220]  they were from the libertarians and they were really on the health, health freedom side
[3:47:27.220 --> 3:47:28.220]  of the equation.
[3:47:28.220 --> 3:47:32.220]  And I think that they were more supportive of a vaccine information and vaccine freedom
[3:47:32.220 --> 3:47:33.220]  of choice.
[3:47:33.220 --> 3:47:36.220]  And I think that the neutral parties that were there by the time that they were left and
[3:47:36.220 --> 3:47:41.220]  they saw the good arguments that we had backed up by sound, um, decisive things that we said
[3:47:41.220 --> 3:47:47.220]  versus kind of the, I would say, lame discussions that happened from the health department in
[3:47:47.220 --> 3:47:48.220]  the same old status quo.
[3:47:48.220 --> 3:47:52.220]  I think that a lot of people left very enlightened by the information they got last night.
[3:47:52.220 --> 3:47:57.220]  By the way, we're going to take that video conference and post it at prisonplanet.tv for
[3:47:57.220 --> 3:47:59.220]  the folks over there and then we'll get ripped everywhere else.
[3:47:59.220 --> 3:48:00.220]  That's great.
[3:48:00.220 --> 3:48:02.220]  Jeff in Missouri, do you have a question for our guest?
[3:48:02.220 --> 3:48:03.220]  Yes, I do.
[3:48:03.220 --> 3:48:06.220]  Uh, Dr. Tenpenny, I was wondering if, I know you're not a veterinarian, but I was wondering
[3:48:06.220 --> 3:48:10.220]  if you knew anything about the H3N8 dog virus.
[3:48:10.220 --> 3:48:12.220]  You know, I really don't.
[3:48:12.220 --> 3:48:17.220]  I, you know, there's so much information that needs to be handled and read and assimilated
[3:48:17.220 --> 3:48:19.220]  every day from the human side.
[3:48:19.220 --> 3:48:22.220]  I really haven't gotten involved with the, with the animals at all.
[3:48:22.220 --> 3:48:25.220]  I just, I worked for a large animal vet and a small animal vet.
[3:48:25.220 --> 3:48:27.220]  This was 20 years ago.
[3:48:27.220 --> 3:48:30.220]  And I remember them advising people, look, they say give the shot every year.
[3:48:30.220 --> 3:48:31.220]  It's not good.
[3:48:31.220 --> 3:48:32.220]  It can hurt your dog.
[3:48:32.220 --> 3:48:34.220]  Now they're not saying of them every year.
[3:48:34.220 --> 3:48:38.220]  The vaccine makers just went and paid off the veterinarian's society and a lot of major
[3:48:38.220 --> 3:48:41.220]  veterinary groups are coming out and saying, these vaccines are killing people's dogs.
[3:48:41.220 --> 3:48:42.220]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:48:42.220 --> 3:48:44.220]  So again, we're marching on every front.
[3:48:44.220 --> 3:48:46.220]  The truth's coming out.
[3:48:46.220 --> 3:48:51.220]  And I think this whole vaccine scare, this whole push for bird flu and swine flu was
[3:48:51.220 --> 3:48:54.220]  really an attempt for them to get back control of the situation.
[3:48:54.220 --> 3:48:57.220]  But I think like Judo, we took them on and slammed them through the wall.
[3:48:57.220 --> 3:48:59.220]  You agree we're kicking their butt?
[3:48:59.220 --> 3:49:01.220]  I think that was really good.
[3:49:01.220 --> 3:49:02.220]  Yeah, it was.
[3:49:02.220 --> 3:49:03.220]  That was good.
[3:49:03.220 --> 3:49:05.220]  Well, hey, we're, we're discovering our fighting spirit.
[3:49:05.220 --> 3:49:06.220]  Thank you, Jeff.
[3:49:06.220 --> 3:49:07.220]  I'm going quick because I want everybody to get on.
[3:49:07.220 --> 3:49:09.220]  Jim in New York, you're on the air with Dr.
[3:49:09.220 --> 3:49:11.220]  Tenpenny. Go.
[3:49:11.220 --> 3:49:16.220]  I talk with the husband of a scientist who works at the Cold Spring lab.
[3:49:16.220 --> 3:49:19.220]  They've been together for a long time and actually lived there at Cold Spring.
[3:49:19.220 --> 3:49:24.220]  Cold Springs is the eugenics IBM bio weapons area.
[3:49:24.220 --> 3:49:25.220]  Yes.
[3:49:25.220 --> 3:49:26.220]  That's right.
[3:49:26.220 --> 3:49:27.220]  Yeah.
[3:49:27.220 --> 3:49:28.220]  She's actually doing research in autism though.
[3:49:28.220 --> 3:49:32.220]  And when I had this conversation, I said, oh, so she's probably linked up the vaccines
[3:49:32.220 --> 3:49:36.220]  that caused this and that changed this whole demeanor.
[3:49:36.220 --> 3:49:40.220]  She flat out came out and said, that is a complete fraud.
[3:49:40.220 --> 3:49:43.220]  There's absolutely no link.
[3:49:43.220 --> 3:49:49.220]  And the theory that they have at Cold Spring, which is what they're trying to put, is that
[3:49:49.220 --> 3:49:54.220]  because men are having these later, it's actually the male studies.
[3:49:54.220 --> 3:49:55.220]  I've seen those studies.
[3:49:55.220 --> 3:49:57.220]  See, they're eugenicists at Cold Springs.
[3:49:57.220 --> 3:49:58.220]  That's where it was founded.
[3:49:58.220 --> 3:50:00.220]  Hitler got all his plans from Cold Springs, as you know, doctor.
[3:50:00.220 --> 3:50:03.220]  That's what the end game covers, blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:50:03.220 --> 3:50:08.220]  They're saying, oh, we all have bad genetics and so we need to pass laws to test your genes
[3:50:08.220 --> 3:50:10.220]  to see if you can have kids.
[3:50:10.220 --> 3:50:11.220]  Yeah.
[3:50:11.220 --> 3:50:16.220]  And it's true from the studies that boys get it more from what I've seen because the mercury
[3:50:16.220 --> 3:50:19.220]  genetically passes through to the brain at a higher level.
[3:50:19.220 --> 3:50:20.220]  That's what I've read.
[3:50:20.220 --> 3:50:21.220]  Is that?
[3:50:21.220 --> 3:50:24.220]  Well, some of it has to do, they think it has to do with the testosterone levels.
[3:50:24.220 --> 3:50:29.220]  And they think that the higher testosterone has a worse of a problem with the mercury on
[3:50:29.220 --> 3:50:30.220]  the brain.
[3:50:30.220 --> 3:50:32.220]  But there's a little bit of truth there.
[3:50:32.220 --> 3:50:36.220]  But I think that what's really interesting is that when they did the whole human genome
[3:50:36.220 --> 3:50:39.220]  project and they're looking at genes is what they don't understand.
[3:50:39.220 --> 3:50:43.220]  The gene pool is fluid and something has to push those genes.
[3:50:43.220 --> 3:50:47.220]  It could be a chemical environment, a vaccine, a toxin, and it's not going to be the same
[3:50:47.220 --> 3:50:48.220]  for every person.
[3:50:48.220 --> 3:50:52.220]  Well, the director at Cold Springs had to resign last year saying blacks weren't human.
[3:50:52.220 --> 3:50:56.220]  Before that was even in the news, I named him as a top eugenicist.
[3:50:56.220 --> 3:51:03.220]  Dr. Watson in endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:51:03.220 --> 3:51:09.220]  Times are tough and many of us expect them to get worse.
[3:51:09.220 --> 3:51:13.220]  The warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time.
[3:51:13.220 --> 3:51:16.220]  Therefore, you have no excuse not to be prepared.
[3:51:16.220 --> 3:51:21.220]  If another Great Depression starts America, how will you excuse your lack of preparation
[3:51:21.220 --> 3:51:22.220]  to your loved ones?
[3:51:22.220 --> 3:51:26.220]  There are numerous places you can buy freeze-dried food.
[3:51:26.220 --> 3:51:32.220]  Patriotfood.com is different because our dried food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans.
[3:51:32.220 --> 3:51:38.220]  Our 25 varieties of bulk food are packaged in heavy-duty food-grade plastic bags that
[3:51:38.220 --> 3:51:39.220]  will last 10 years.
[3:51:39.220 --> 3:51:47.220]  While our competition charges $3,000, we ship to you 135 pounds of great bulk food supplies
[3:51:47.220 --> 3:51:49.220]  for a fraction of that.
[3:51:49.220 --> 3:51:53.220]  Our company is owned by a famous patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[3:51:53.220 --> 3:51:54.220]  I know you can trust him.
[3:51:54.220 --> 3:51:55.220]  He's my dad.
[3:51:55.220 --> 3:52:03.220]  Patriotfood.com is the wise choice for food insurance.
[3:52:03.220 --> 3:52:07.220]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:52:07.220 --> 3:52:10.220]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:52:10.220 --> 3:52:15.220]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:52:15.220 --> 3:52:16.220]  at home.
[3:52:16.220 --> 3:52:22.220]  We've turned an innocent influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[3:52:22.220 --> 3:52:27.220]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:27.220 --> 3:52:32.220]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[3:52:32.220 --> 3:52:37.220]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:52:37.220 --> 3:52:39.220]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:52:39.220 --> 3:52:43.220]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:52:43.220 --> 3:52:50.220]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[3:52:50.220 --> 3:52:55.220]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[3:52:55.220 --> 3:53:21.220]  We're watching online right now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.

[3:54:13.220 --> 3:54:18.220]  I'm going to talk to Jessica, Tim, and Larry with quick questions here in just a moment.
[3:54:18.220 --> 3:54:24.220]  But Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, do, Rob, do a couple of months ago, was up there interviewing her for Fall of the Republic too.
[3:54:24.220 --> 3:54:26.220]  And he said, you want to come out with T-shirts to fund your operation?
[3:54:26.220 --> 3:54:29.220]  Plus, get the word out, and she brought me a bunch of them.
[3:54:29.220 --> 3:54:31.220]  They're really good-looking shirts.
[3:54:31.220 --> 3:54:33.220]  Vaccine, Refuse Nick.
[3:54:33.220 --> 3:54:35.220]  She's given me three of them.
[3:54:35.220 --> 3:54:41.220]  Go to drtinpenny.com and check out the store there and support the work she's doing.
[3:54:41.220 --> 3:54:43.220]  In fact, she's wearing one of them right now.
[3:54:43.220 --> 3:54:46.220]  Maybe with that camera, we can zoom in on these.
[3:54:46.220 --> 3:54:50.220]  This is one that says forced mandatory required.
[3:54:50.220 --> 3:54:51.220]  No.
[3:54:51.220 --> 3:54:52.220]  And we're saying no to those.
[3:54:52.220 --> 3:54:54.220]  Drtinpenny.com on the back.
[3:54:54.220 --> 3:54:56.220]  Don't inject me.
[3:54:56.220 --> 3:54:58.220]  It is on the back.
[3:54:58.220 --> 3:55:06.220]  Go to drtinpenny.com and get those and get all our T-shirts, like the Gadsden flag you name it, at infowars.com.
[3:55:06.220 --> 3:55:09.220]  Because this is walking billboards for the truth.
[3:55:09.220 --> 3:55:13.220]  We've got to bypass the mainstream media and get the job done.
[3:55:13.220 --> 3:55:14.220]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:55:14.220 --> 3:55:20.220]  Doc, that's a good idea, and I'm glad you took our advice on that, because we all need to fund ourselves to build a bigger platform.
[3:55:20.220 --> 3:55:22.220]  We don't have George Soros funding us.
[3:55:22.220 --> 3:55:24.220]  Jessica in Michigan, you're on the air.
[3:55:24.220 --> 3:55:26.220]  Jessica, go ahead.
[3:55:26.220 --> 3:55:27.220]  Hi.
[3:55:27.220 --> 3:55:33.220]  I work at a large hospital here in Grand Rapids, and they have made the flu vaccine mandatory this year for the first time.
[3:55:33.220 --> 3:55:39.220]  And I am religiously opposed to that, and I've made that clear to everybody there, pretty much.
[3:55:39.220 --> 3:55:47.220]  So this morning, Human Resources approached me after work, and they told me that they have set up an appointment for me to meet with a board,
[3:55:47.220 --> 3:55:54.220]  and I have 15 minutes to plead my case to them as to why I should be exempt from the vaccine.
[3:55:54.220 --> 3:56:00.220]  And currently, they're only allowing medical exemption, and so I don't know if you had any information.
[3:56:00.220 --> 3:56:06.220]  Well, say you have an allergy, but why to have a job if you have to take the shot?
[3:56:06.220 --> 3:56:13.220]  You have to sign a paper giving full access to all of your medical records, and then they have a committee that reviews that.
[3:56:13.220 --> 3:56:14.220]  Ma'am, this is tyranny.
[3:56:14.220 --> 3:56:15.220]  This is just tyranny.
[3:56:15.220 --> 3:56:17.220]  I totally agree.
[3:56:17.220 --> 3:56:18.220]  What should you do, doctor?
[3:56:18.220 --> 3:56:22.220]  Well, one of the most important things you can do is to try to find some like-minded people.
[3:56:22.220 --> 3:56:26.220]  Find some other people that you can band together with and go collectively as a group,
[3:56:26.220 --> 3:56:31.220]  because I am sure that in the place where you work, that there are other people who want to refuse this vaccine.
[3:56:31.220 --> 3:56:32.220]  Yes, you're isolated.
[3:56:32.220 --> 3:56:33.220]  They want to corner you.
[3:56:33.220 --> 3:56:39.220]  That's why they're forcibly inoculating only elementary kids, because they know they're defenseless.
[3:56:39.220 --> 3:56:40.220]  Exactly.
[3:56:40.220 --> 3:56:44.220]  And if you can find some like-minded people, there's already a nursing shortage.
[3:56:44.220 --> 3:56:46.220]  They can't fire or suspend all of you.
[3:56:46.220 --> 3:56:48.220]  So you really need to get together collectively.
[3:56:48.220 --> 3:56:55.220]  And you tell them it's a religious discrimination that you may have to sue them, and they'll back off.
[3:56:55.220 --> 3:56:56.220]  It's against your religion today.
[3:56:56.220 --> 3:57:00.220]  I think that people are going to need to be that strong and stand up for that.
[3:57:00.220 --> 3:57:03.220]  Well, look, they stood up in England.
[3:57:03.220 --> 3:57:04.220]  They stood up in Germany.
[3:57:04.220 --> 3:57:07.220]  They ordered the doctors to find people they didn't do it.
[3:57:07.220 --> 3:57:09.220]  If they didn't take the shot, the doctors said, we'll just quit.
[3:57:09.220 --> 3:57:11.220]  We've got to learn to say no.
[3:57:11.220 --> 3:57:13.220]  They tried to put GMO food in France.
[3:57:13.220 --> 3:57:14.220]  The farmers went crazy.
[3:57:14.220 --> 3:57:17.220]  We've got to grow a backbone like Americans used to.
[3:57:17.220 --> 3:57:19.220]  Ma'am, I'm sorry to hear that's happening to you.
[3:57:19.220 --> 3:57:21.220]  Tim and Ohio, you're on the air with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[3:57:21.220 --> 3:57:22.220]  Go ahead.
[3:57:22.220 --> 3:57:23.220]  Hi, Alex.
[3:57:23.220 --> 3:57:24.220]  Hello, Dr. Tenpenny.
[3:57:24.220 --> 3:57:25.220]  Good afternoon.
[3:57:25.220 --> 3:57:28.220]  I'm right next door to you when you're at home in Lorraine County.
[3:57:28.220 --> 3:57:30.220]  Alex, I mess a message with your video guys.
[3:57:30.220 --> 3:57:32.220]  I could have copped you that interview.
[3:57:32.220 --> 3:57:33.220]  I got all the cameras and all the production.
[3:57:33.220 --> 3:57:34.220]  Okay, great.
[3:57:34.220 --> 3:57:35.220]  You have a question for it, Tim.
[3:57:35.220 --> 3:57:36.220]  We're almost out of time.
[3:57:36.220 --> 3:57:37.220]  Yes, Dr. Tenpenny.
[3:57:37.220 --> 3:57:41.220]  I notice on the local stations, Monica Rothen, Stephanie Schaefer, Lee Jordan, Alicia Booth,
[3:57:41.220 --> 3:57:43.220]  Don Kendrick, none of them will have you on.
[3:57:43.220 --> 3:57:44.220]  Why?
[3:57:44.220 --> 3:57:45.220]  That's pretty interesting.
[3:57:45.220 --> 3:57:48.220]  It's sort of like you're never a prophet in your own town, are you?
[3:57:48.220 --> 3:57:52.220]  But I was on Mike Trivasano a couple of weeks ago on 1100 a.m.
[3:57:52.220 --> 3:57:57.220]  It was supposed to be on last Thursday, but got preempted by the military base thing that
[3:57:57.220 --> 3:57:58.220]  happened.
[3:57:58.220 --> 3:57:59.220]  Tim, thank you.
[3:57:59.220 --> 3:58:00.220]  Larry, 10-second question.
[3:58:00.220 --> 3:58:01.220]  Hit us.
[3:58:01.220 --> 3:58:02.220]  Larry in Minnesota.
[3:58:02.220 --> 3:58:03.220]  Hi, Alex.
[3:58:03.220 --> 3:58:04.220]  Hi, Sherry.
[3:58:04.220 --> 3:58:10.220]  I'm a Desert Storm vet and a healthcare worker and in a similar position as the girl that
[3:58:10.220 --> 3:58:11.220]  just called.
[3:58:11.220 --> 3:58:12.220]  It's just a minute ago.
[3:58:12.220 --> 3:58:13.220]  The goal is 100%.
[3:58:13.220 --> 3:58:17.220]  Any comments about herd immunity and can I give my website out?
[3:58:17.220 --> 3:58:18.220]  I'm a healthcare worker.
[3:58:18.220 --> 3:58:19.220]  I want to get this information.
[3:58:19.220 --> 3:58:22.140]  But Obama says nobody has to take it.
[3:58:22.140 --> 3:58:23.140]  Give your website out.
[3:58:23.140 --> 3:58:26.140]  A healthcare charity.com in the Twin Cities, Minnesota.
[3:58:26.140 --> 3:58:27.140]  Thank you.
[3:58:27.140 --> 3:58:28.140]  All right.
[3:58:28.140 --> 3:58:29.140]  God bless you.
[3:58:29.140 --> 3:58:30.140]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[3:58:30.140 --> 3:58:32.140]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.com or drtenpenny.com.
[3:58:32.140 --> 3:58:34.140]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[3:58:34.140 --> 3:58:35.140]  You're welcome.
[3:58:35.140 --> 3:58:36.140]  Thanks, Alex.
[3:58:36.140 --> 3:58:40.140]  You are a trooper, a warrior, an Amazon princess in the fight against tyranny.
