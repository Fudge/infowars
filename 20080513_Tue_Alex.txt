[01:32.680 --> 01:37.800]  this is very important genetically modified human embryos stirs criticism
[01:37.800 --> 01:43.080]  it's not enough to manipulate the corn and the wheat and add insects and animal
[01:43.080 --> 01:49.400]  genes to it now they've got to manipulate human beings and this is the
[01:49.400 --> 01:52.280]  government just now telling you they're doing this has been going on for
[01:52.280 --> 01:58.440]  decades of course feds accused student of terror espionage for talking about
[01:58.440 --> 02:02.720]  constitution we've now written this into an article what we covered here
[02:02.720 --> 02:06.920]  yesterday on the show and some people were in the comment section of info
[02:06.920 --> 02:12.280]  wars dot com you know saying oh we called Mount Pleasant Dallas there's no
[02:12.280 --> 02:16.520]  Bible school there well you didn't do a very good Google search did you I have
[02:16.520 --> 02:19.760]  to know the name of the school the full name the name of the school president
[02:19.760 --> 02:24.080]  all of it we just didn't release that because the individuals we had on are a
[02:24.080 --> 02:28.680]  little bit concerned they were threatened with quote having their head cut off
[02:28.680 --> 02:33.640]  you know arrested head on a silver platter if they ever talked about it
[02:33.640 --> 02:37.120]  being told you're not allowed to talk about the Constitution that is a call
[02:37.120 --> 02:44.160]  for espionage that is quote terrorism and espionage because we have a rogue
[02:44.160 --> 02:49.600]  government that is destroying the Bill of Rights the Constitution we have their
[02:49.600 --> 02:54.040]  training manuals where they say the Constitution Bill of Rights are terrorist
[02:54.040 --> 02:57.680]  documents and the founding fathers are bad we have video FEMA teaching it we
[02:57.680 --> 03:01.120]  have squad car video of state police arresting a woman for a pocket
[03:01.120 --> 03:05.240]  Constitution and then discussing amongst themselves is it illegal to have a
[03:05.240 --> 03:09.880]  Constitution just like a year plus before it broke in the mainstream news
[03:09.880 --> 03:13.800]  that twenty six thousand preachers have been hired to train their flocks to go
[03:13.800 --> 03:19.400]  to FEMA camps we released the secret FEMA documents and people didn't
[03:19.400 --> 03:23.440]  believe that just like you didn't believe they'd get rid of posse commentatus
[03:23.440 --> 03:28.200]  now they've announced it on the news I mean I'm sorry this is the reality I'm
[03:28.200 --> 03:32.720]  sorry this is happening and going on I know it's hard to believe that Homeland
[03:32.720 --> 03:38.400]  Security goes into colleges and says you can't talk about the Constitution it's
[03:38.400 --> 03:43.120]  a terrorist document I know it's hard to believe that globalists like Philip
[03:43.120 --> 03:48.240]  Bobbitt have front page news stories in the local paper in Austin with a picture
[03:48.240 --> 03:55.000]  of a burning Constitution saying it's good get rid of freedom you can't make
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.160]  this stuff up okay I showed it on the TV show I've showed it online we've shown
[04:00.160 --> 04:04.400]  you that we stand the cover of the local paper with the burning Constitution
[04:04.400 --> 04:11.000]  saying it's good I'm not the weird one that I'm reporting on them okay I'm not
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.640]  the bad one that I understand it's crazy I understand it's hard to believe it
[04:17.640 --> 04:25.600]  freaks me out it makes me go into frothing fits it's like everybody's
[04:25.600 --> 04:29.880]  emailing me going how did you know that they would use illegal alien arrest
[04:29.880 --> 04:35.320]  operations as drills to arrest the general public that's what FEMA's
[04:35.320 --> 04:40.040]  admitting they're doing how did you know that because I watched the Senate

[08:21.400 --> 08:31.600]  Tony Gosling over at Builderburg.org in England is reporting a newspaper that
[08:31.600 --> 08:37.160]  appears to be a print paper as well as an online journal out of Athens Grease is
[08:37.160 --> 08:43.360]  reporting that Builderburg met over the weekend there this time meeting a few
[08:43.360 --> 08:47.720]  weeks earlier than they normally do if this is true this is the first time in
[08:47.720 --> 08:53.400]  35 years that Jim Tucker has not discovered where they are located and
[08:53.400 --> 08:59.280]  made it there within the first day of the conference opening we've talked to Jim
[08:59.280 --> 09:02.360]  Tucker he says he's gotten calls about it he's trying to track it down this
[09:02.360 --> 09:07.440]  morning to find out of that is indeed the case we have seen these false alarms
[09:07.440 --> 09:12.680]  before we have seen people claim and mainstream newspapers claim that
[09:12.680 --> 09:16.760]  Builderburg has met in their city sometimes it turns out the newspapers in
[09:16.760 --> 09:23.200]  the case of Turkey last year we're actually putting out dis info so we
[09:23.200 --> 09:28.280]  will find out exactly what is happening I'm told Steve Watson is working on a
[09:28.280 --> 09:33.640]  report Paul Watson is finding out right now all he can on this subject and he'll
[09:33.640 --> 09:38.920]  be joining us coming up in 22 minutes from now at the bottom of the hour we're

[09:44.080 --> 09:52.400]  fourth hour at 1-800-259-9231 all right let me just run through some of the
[09:52.400 --> 09:57.280]  headlines that I have here in front of me genetically modified human embryo
[09:57.280 --> 10:02.440]  stairs criticism feds accused student of terror and espionage we're talking about
[10:02.440 --> 10:10.720]  Constitution expect Rod Serling to come walking about a minute eco group calls
[10:10.720 --> 10:15.760]  for voluntary human extinction says masses should be indoctrinated to stop
[10:15.760 --> 10:21.440]  having children in order the human race can die out and save the planet we're
[10:21.440 --> 10:27.920]  gonna have this group on by the way DC council moves to block surveillance
[10:27.920 --> 10:32.680]  camera project so they put the homeland security funded cameras in federally
[10:32.680 --> 10:36.400]  funded cameras decades ago homeland security funded in the last six years
[10:36.400 --> 10:41.440]  and then they just convert them over to surveilling us the fat hogs that
[10:41.440 --> 10:46.920]  basically government sticks a straw in and sucks on that's what we're seen as
[10:46.920 --> 10:52.960]  belief in global warming slips national poll out showing a huge number of people
[10:52.960 --> 10:58.400]  less believe that it's man-made or real yeah your fraud is starting to implode
[10:58.400 --> 11:01.600]  don't worry they'll move on to a new fraud as fast as we expose the last one
[11:01.600 --> 11:08.520]  illegal alien raid part of a FEMA camp drill FEMA said a week ago or back on
[11:08.520 --> 11:17.040]  the 7th to be technical in multiple papers that they were doing a drill in
[11:17.040 --> 11:21.920]  the Des Moines register in the Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier and other
[11:21.920 --> 11:27.760]  publications and Lee Rogers properly at rogue government said that this will
[11:27.760 --> 11:33.520]  probably be a mass illegal alien arrest but it'll be a PR stunt and he was
[11:33.520 --> 11:38.400]  right and of course he's right because he knows the history and in 1986 it came
[11:38.400 --> 11:42.160]  out that in Rex 84 they had a plan to build a bunch of camps and climate was
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.240]  free legal aliens knowing that that would be popular but then really just
[11:46.240 --> 11:49.600]  use that to set the precedent to set up the camps and then it would really be
[11:49.600 --> 11:53.800]  used for citizens then two years ago the Houston Chronicle reported that
[11:53.800 --> 11:57.960]  indeed we have this from the FEMA documents years before but Houston Chronicle
[11:57.960 --> 12:03.360]  finally reported that it was for US citizens and that the camps would have
[12:03.360 --> 12:08.560]  dual use for your illegal aliens and political dissenters so that's the
[12:08.560 --> 12:16.680]  cover story for it and now they have one just outside Austin in what Taylor we've
[12:16.680 --> 12:20.280]  been out there and covered it had police walk across the parking lot to the other
[12:20.280 --> 12:23.200]  side of the road and said you're not allowed to videotape in America and we
[12:23.200 --> 12:26.720]  just said go ahead and arrest us and they backed off some of that video is in
[12:26.720 --> 12:30.760]  in-game when you see the footage of children playing behind barbed wire in
[12:30.760 --> 12:36.440]  prison jumpsuits small children that is a FEMA center over there and they put
[12:36.440 --> 12:40.920]  political dissidents people who don't have political views who happen to have
[12:40.920 --> 12:44.880]  visas in there they leave the illegal aliens from Latin America pretty much
[12:44.880 --> 12:48.520]  alone and then they feds are very sophisticated they use it as a way to
[12:48.520 --> 12:53.440]  make people feel sorry for the illegal aliens and grandstand pushing for amnesty
[12:53.440 --> 12:59.840]  while also setting the precedent for no due process which is wrong so how do I
[12:59.840 --> 13:03.040]  know this how did I know this would happen because again I've seen the
[13:03.040 --> 13:09.400]  Senate hearings I've read the declassified versions of Rex 84 illegal
[13:09.400 --> 13:14.200]  alien raid part of FEMA camp drill and it was predicted last week by Lee
[13:14.200 --> 13:20.160]  Rogers that that this would be a mass arrest of illegal aliens and they did
[13:20.160 --> 13:24.640]  raid packing plants yesterday in and around Des Moines so we'll be going
[13:24.640 --> 13:31.520]  over that also LA Times reporting Ron Paul's forces quietly plot GOP
[13:31.520 --> 13:36.000]  convention revolt against McCain you're now hearing the mainstream media we
[13:36.000 --> 13:43.960]  told you was going on months ago and it is going to be quite a circus be assured
[13:43.960 --> 13:49.320]  of that and we'll see how the media handles it and we'll see what ends up
[13:49.320 --> 13:55.560]  happening how the Ron Paul revolution ends up looking I hope just we come out
[13:55.560 --> 14:00.720]  like a rose out of this we'll find out that certainly a fact won't we
[14:00.720 --> 14:07.160]  Bernanke financial turmoil in markets easing I guess it's like saying as the
[14:07.160 --> 14:12.600]  itatonic began listing and prepared to go under that it was doing quite nicely
[14:12.600 --> 14:18.440]  so we'll go over that China since troops to Szechuan as quake kills more than
[14:18.440 --> 14:27.520]  10,000 people let me see mother nature the weather has killed at least 40,000
[14:27.520 --> 14:35.000]  people in the last week and a half in Burma I'm sorry military junta said I
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.760]  should need to why call it Muammar now so I guess I'm me a mar wherever you
[14:38.760 --> 14:45.600]  pronounce it guess I'll follow the military junta okay me a mar but and in
[14:45.600 --> 14:51.040]  now in Szechuan that that's just the the preliminary 10,000 it could be much
[14:51.040 --> 14:55.200]  more and unfortunately probably will be but do you see everyone hysterically
[14:55.200 --> 14:59.360]  running around like I've got to give up all my rides I've got to have black you
[14:59.360 --> 15:05.040]  know ski mass troops everywhere to keep me safe now we had tornadoes kill 20
[15:05.040 --> 15:07.880]  plus people over the weekend here in the US tornadoes a few days before that
[15:07.880 --> 15:12.240]  killed a bunch of people we before that tornadoes killed a bunch of people that
[15:12.240 --> 15:16.240]  matter though we're just all gonna run around just police looking in bushes
[15:16.240 --> 15:22.120]  under tables for al-Qaeda everywhere with the borders wide open but they've
[15:22.120 --> 15:27.600]  built 45 miles of fence so we're using illegal aliens to build it so the
[15:27.600 --> 15:31.400]  general public thinks they've gotten tough on the illegal aliens the theater
[15:31.400 --> 15:37.840]  continues there so that is a sum of what I have in front of me today that we
[15:37.840 --> 15:42.800]  will be covering in fact I'm just iron willed I'm gonna start covering all the
[15:42.800 --> 15:45.840]  news that I have in front of me today that means the news I didn't cover
[15:45.840 --> 15:50.240]  yesterday I have to go back to that I was probably 30 important stories 3040 I'm
[15:50.240 --> 15:54.600]  just estimating here in the stack from yesterday that I didn't get to that were
[15:54.600 --> 16:00.680]  all incredibly important I probably got to 15 of the stories I had I'm gonna get
[16:00.680 --> 16:05.920]  to the 3040 however many the stack is that I didn't and today's news today and
[16:05.920 --> 16:11.920]  we will be taking your calls as well so we're gonna get to all this news let me
[16:11.920 --> 16:17.040]  go ahead and get to something that's very very important now there's a lot of
[16:17.040 --> 16:23.920]  facets to this but a big one is that I remember in the British press and the
[16:23.920 --> 16:32.760]  French press in 1997 reading about chimeras human splices with cows pigs
[16:32.760 --> 16:40.320]  insects plants and these just weren't where a few genes were changed I mean
[16:40.320 --> 16:47.880]  these were these were human embryos these were babies that were half chimpanzee
[16:47.880 --> 17:01.040]  90% chimpanzee half cow they were human embryos put in cows to grow up to a
[17:01.040 --> 17:05.080]  larger size to be harvested to have their organs harvested I mean they're
[17:05.080 --> 17:11.040]  growing babies up big and I would read this in medical reports and scientific
[17:11.040 --> 17:16.600]  journals and because what happened is I'd see a BBC article saying oh yeah they
[17:16.600 --> 17:22.520]  they're working on at this university putting human embryos but that have
[17:22.520 --> 17:30.680]  bovine genetics so that it's not rejected by the Jersey cow and then they
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.440]  want to go in and they want to grow the embryos up to a larger size to extract
[17:35.440 --> 17:43.560]  valuably you know needed tissues and then I would actually then go yahoo or
[17:43.560 --> 17:47.680]  dog pile or altavista that were the big searches at the time I would go search
[17:47.680 --> 17:52.160]  around and find the medical journals and you know I'd be looking for one and I'd
[17:52.160 --> 17:57.280]  find 50 others you know 100 others 10 others and depending on the search and I
[17:57.280 --> 18:02.560]  would sit there for hours at night reading on my slow dial-up connection I'd
[18:02.560 --> 18:05.080]  stay at the radio station late at night because they had DSL there it was
[18:05.080 --> 18:08.280]  quicker and I would just read and read and then I try to go on air and I just
[18:08.280 --> 18:15.120]  freak out and start yelling because it's like you've been 1997 98 they had
[18:15.120 --> 18:23.800]  babies in cows humanoid bovine cross species creatures and I'll tell you
[18:23.800 --> 18:27.400]  know and of course I ride around that towel never forget the guy comes up

[18:38.120 --> 18:45.040]  pathetic I felt dumb I felt I started just going and the guy would oh you caught
[18:45.040 --> 18:49.680]  the line you know basically and I was just like I just I couldn't even respond
[18:49.680 --> 18:56.880]  to him I couldn't even gratify him I just felt sad for him sad for me he started
[18:56.880 --> 19:01.040]  going you know I've got a biology degree and I said I finally get my tongue and
[19:01.040 --> 19:05.680]  I went I wanted to say you know why'd you tap me on the shoulder kind of
[19:05.680 --> 19:11.760]  aggressively and you're a chicken neck slave but but it was it just gets to the
[19:11.760 --> 19:17.240]  point where you just feel sorry for the slaves and I I said to him I said well
[19:17.240 --> 19:22.360]  do you currently practice biology in some field and he said no I said when
[19:22.360 --> 19:27.920]  were you in college and he said UT and he said seven in the mid 70s
[19:27.920 --> 19:33.880]  graduated 76 and I didn't even say look it up I just said fine I'm a liar and I

[24:13.760 --> 24:22.560]  it's all so reckless someone to hear your prayers someone who cares so they had a
[24:22.560 --> 24:30.400]  phase in the mid and late 90s admitting all of this and then I'd go on air and
[24:30.400 --> 24:34.920]  read a Washington Post article about Costa Rica with private laboratories with
[24:34.920 --> 24:41.480]  part chimpanzee part human creatures that have been brought to term that means
[24:41.480 --> 24:44.520]  they're in cages ladies and gentlemen but that they wouldn't let the public
[24:44.520 --> 24:48.000]  see it but university officials have been down there from the US and confirmed
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.400]  it I mean that's what mad scientists do they're all hyper competitive they all
[24:52.400 --> 24:55.040]  want to you know be known in the history books they all want to show off
[24:55.040 --> 25:00.440]  there's huge money in it and this is what we know they have can you imagine
[25:00.440 --> 25:03.680]  what goes on in the government underground laboratories and the private
[25:03.680 --> 25:07.720]  corporate laboratories and then we have all these Nobel Prize winners and top
[25:07.720 --> 25:12.640]  scientists and genetic engineer experts on we've brought them all to here who'll
[25:12.640 --> 25:16.920]  tell you that you change one gene it randomly changes thousands each
[25:16.920 --> 25:23.200]  generational expression and recombination of the DNA and they're not doing that
[25:23.200 --> 25:28.000]  they're changing entire structures and just grafting in plant with animal with
[25:28.000 --> 25:35.280]  insect with just everything you can imagine mammal with reptile with
[25:35.280 --> 25:43.440]  marsupial with bacteria and they're feeding it to us and they've already for
[25:43.440 --> 25:51.240]  at least six years got cloned cows and cloned pigs and they're already breeding
[25:51.240 --> 25:56.360]  them and they've approved it to eat and it's already on store shelves and then
[25:56.360 --> 25:59.680]  the companies move to have legislation passed so you're not allowed to know on
[25:59.680 --> 26:04.880]  the label and I remember learning 12 years ago 13 years ago they were spraying
[26:04.880 --> 26:11.000]  food with live viruses then they finally announced it to the slaves three years
[26:11.000 --> 26:18.760]  ago that they soak most meat now in live virus quote to kill other bacteria the
[26:18.760 --> 26:25.560]  virus it's scientific Latin name is however you say bacteria eating virus
[26:25.560 --> 26:33.720]  in Latin and then level sub name for its particular variety and then of course
[26:33.720 --> 26:36.880]  they say well that's completely natural but then you learn it's in millions of
[26:36.880 --> 26:43.720]  times the concentration that it's naturally in your gut and then you find
[26:43.720 --> 26:49.480]  out that it's been engineered and grown in tissue vats from stock of all these
[26:49.480 --> 26:53.160]  other research animals so then it's mixed with all their viruses and bacteria
[26:53.160 --> 26:58.200]  and then there's all these new intestinal problems and then it's a link to it
[26:58.200 --> 27:06.480]  doesn't matter it's just like the Monsanto product where a naturally
[27:06.480 --> 27:15.600]  occurring toxic fungus is in and in and on the different different food crops
[27:15.600 --> 27:19.520]  and then they argue they get well we got to be approval I mean this isn't this
[27:19.520 --> 27:26.440]  fungus is naturally out there but this is 50 something thousand times if you go
[27:26.440 --> 27:29.760]  read the reports in some cases even higher than that what is naturally
[27:29.760 --> 27:36.000]  occurring fungus on the outside no no it's it's on the inside and then of
[27:36.000 --> 27:42.440]  course they only look at that toxin it's creating not the fact that it also then
[27:42.440 --> 27:52.800]  creates shell development sites where the soybeans and all the other plants that
[27:52.800 --> 28:00.280]  now do this they designed are creating the fungal hives the the the fungal
[28:00.280 --> 28:05.440]  development which then excretes it as factories inside so there's all of that
[28:05.440 --> 28:12.000]  apparatus I mean if you if somebody doesn't believe in the devil does it
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.360]  this make you believe in it or did I mean the devil doesn't exist might as
[28:15.360 --> 28:19.120]  well be the devil I mean the people that come up with stuff like this feed it to
[28:19.120 --> 28:26.160]  their own children I could go on for hours ladies and gentlemen but meanwhile
[28:26.160 --> 28:30.240]  no one's worried about this none of the police are putting cameras up everywhere
[28:30.240 --> 28:33.520]  running checkpoints pulling everybody over squeezing more money out of the
[28:33.520 --> 28:37.640]  haggard bedraggled population the dollars being deflated the currencies
[28:37.640 --> 28:43.280]  falling apart and what do they do just be government just grows and grows and
[28:43.280 --> 28:47.400]  grows and grows and grows and every form of micro management every form of
[28:47.400 --> 28:52.280]  bureaucracy and paperwork you've got to fill out and filings you've got to make
[28:52.280 --> 28:56.800]  and and just constantly jumping through hoops and being surveilled and if you
[28:56.800 --> 29:01.160]  talk back to a cop or even ask a question they taser you and prisons
[29:01.160 --> 29:05.680]  being built everywhere and yes the news is reporting caller called in about it
[29:05.680 --> 29:08.480]  I mean I already knew this and I'm not tooting my horn my point is this has
[29:08.480 --> 29:11.880]  been confirmed so I knew the caller was telling the truth the caller said yeah
[29:11.880 --> 29:15.960]  did you see this PBS television program about the private prisons going in
[29:15.960 --> 29:19.840]  lobby for stricter laws to put more people in their private prisons so I
[29:19.840 --> 29:25.440]  googled that and did find a PBS report on it I mean it's so sick meanwhile we're
[29:25.440 --> 29:28.440]  all being poisoned all these horrible things are happening are we doing
[29:28.440 --> 29:32.440]  anything about the real environmental crisis no no we're gonna have a global
[29:32.440 --> 29:37.480]  carbon tax on what plants breathe and the public's been convinced that carbon
[29:37.480 --> 29:45.160]  dioxide is a deadly weapon they're running around we're on the March the
[29:45.160 --> 29:52.240]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:52.640 --> 29:56.680]  doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live
[29:56.680 --> 30:00.760]  in a pH balanced alkaline environment but as you know most people are overly
[30:00.760 --> 30:05.560]  acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise pH balance is the
[30:05.560 --> 30:09.080]  foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of
[30:09.080 --> 30:13.120]  disease people who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood
[30:13.120 --> 30:17.440]  sugar mental clarity and loss of weight it was intended for human beings to
[30:17.440 --> 30:21.320]  drink alkaline water but due to modern way of life most people are overly
[30:21.320 --> 30:25.560]  acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment
[30:25.560 --> 30:29.320]  fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and
[30:29.320 --> 30:33.800]  doesn't neutralize it do your part alkalize and supercharge your body now
[30:33.800 --> 30:38.440]  alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that
[30:38.440 --> 30:43.080]  raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops
[30:43.080 --> 30:48.520]  order your bottle of alcovision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alka
[30:48.520 --> 31:15.960]  vision dot com again that's alka vision dot com democracy we've all heard the
[31:15.960 --> 31:20.760]  word in fact men and now women have been sent to fight wars in the name of it
[31:20.760 --> 31:26.360]  we've been told that that is what our government is a democracy though the
[31:26.360 --> 31:31.160]  word is not to be found in any of America's founding documents not in the
[31:31.160 --> 31:36.320]  Declaration of Independence not in the Articles of Confederation not even in
[31:36.320 --> 31:41.880]  any part of the Constitution the word democracy and its definition is found
[31:41.880 --> 31:49.320]  however in a 156 page book officially compiled and issued by the United
[31:49.320 --> 31:56.080]  States War Department in November of 1928 this book issued by the US War
[31:56.080 --> 32:00.080]  Department mind you was published by the authority of the United States
[32:00.080 --> 32:05.280]  government and thus must be accepted as authentic in any court of proper
[32:05.280 --> 32:11.520]  jurisdiction and what did it say concerning democracy what was the
[32:11.520 --> 32:20.720]  definition given in it for democracy that is untold today hushed up today but
[32:20.720 --> 32:26.240]  we tell it at another untold story dot com go there today another untold story

[33:06.760 --> 33:22.360]  All right, Paul Watson and Steve Watson are trying to figure out if this Greek newspaper
[33:22.360 --> 33:26.200]  is accurate.
[33:26.200 --> 33:30.880]  Tony Gosling over at billaberg.org, we've interviewed a great reporter, very credible
[33:30.880 --> 33:31.880]  in the past.
[33:31.880 --> 33:38.720]  He's reporting that indeed they met, they did a sneak attack that billaberg met early
[33:38.720 --> 33:41.440]  in Athens, Greece over the weekend.
[33:41.440 --> 33:47.560]  Now that would mean they were meeting about two weeks early from what they historically
[33:47.560 --> 33:48.560]  meet.
[33:48.560 --> 33:49.560]  Sometimes they meet about three weeks from now.
[33:49.560 --> 33:50.560]  Sometimes two weeks from now.
[33:50.560 --> 33:54.480]  They're in a window of a couple of weeks.
[33:54.480 --> 33:59.480]  We're not sure right now, but we're going to try to find out very, very soon.
[33:59.480 --> 34:04.680]  Steve Watson is doing a report with all of the info condensed.
[34:04.680 --> 34:08.400]  Now we know that about, what was it, five years ago, six years ago, we can look this
[34:08.400 --> 34:15.400]  up and add it to the report, kind of pool our resources here and our mental resources
[34:15.400 --> 34:17.640]  here and try to assess this.
[34:17.640 --> 34:21.120]  There was a false start report, but it wasn't a false report.
[34:21.120 --> 34:23.960]  It was a false start report, I would call it.
[34:23.960 --> 34:25.240]  It was partially correct.
[34:25.240 --> 34:28.280]  They had a billaberg steering meeting.
[34:28.280 --> 34:29.280]  It's what they called it.
[34:29.280 --> 34:35.520]  They have many meetings with like 20, 25, 30, sometimes as few as 15 members at the library
[34:35.520 --> 34:36.520]  of Congress.
[34:36.520 --> 34:38.080]  It was five or six years ago.
[34:38.080 --> 34:43.960]  I just remembered that a second ago, and they had other little steering meetings in
[34:43.960 --> 34:53.600]  Europe where two months before, a month before, a week before, they will have a mini meeting
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.080]  and it will be billaberg attendees there and then even the press will say, okay, it was
[34:57.080 --> 34:59.480]  a billaberg steering.
[34:59.480 --> 35:04.920]  Now would they have a steering meeting a few weeks early in Athens?
[35:04.920 --> 35:12.480]  This will be the first time in 30 plus years, 35 or 36 years that Jim Tucker wouldn't have
[35:12.480 --> 35:16.240]  physically made it, wouldn't have physically found out where it was.
[35:16.240 --> 35:21.240]  We know they're getting more and more inventive, sometimes leasing whole hotels in another
[35:21.240 --> 35:25.960]  country, another region, another part of the world.
[35:25.960 --> 35:29.880]  We know that they put out this info to try to find out where our sources are.
[35:29.880 --> 35:31.760]  We're trying to get Estalon on the line right now.
[35:31.760 --> 35:33.960]  I just learned of this in the last hour and a half.
[35:33.960 --> 35:36.040]  So we're trying to ferret all this out.
[35:36.040 --> 35:38.280]  Let's go ahead and go to Paul Watson.
[35:38.280 --> 35:40.520]  Paul, what do we know right now?
[35:40.520 --> 35:42.320]  Hello, Alex.
[35:42.320 --> 35:48.600]  All we know is the fact that billaberg.org, which is Tony Godling's website, is linked
[35:48.600 --> 35:57.200]  to a Greek newspaper website called patriss.gr, which is reporting that billaberg met from
[35:57.200 --> 36:01.920]  the 8th to the 11th of May, which is this past weekend.
[36:01.920 --> 36:11.560]  Now the Greek news website report on billaberg.org, don't stay at which hotel that this, the
[36:11.560 --> 36:13.640]  part of the billaberg meeting took place.
[36:13.640 --> 36:21.760]  What we do know is that it was in the Vuliagmeni area of Athens, Greece, which was the same
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.280]  place where billaberg met in 1993.
[36:26.280 --> 36:35.440]  In 1993, they met at the Naftica Astia Palace Hotel, which from doing basic research into
[36:35.440 --> 36:41.560]  that, you would suspect that if the main meeting was to be in Athens, Greece again, then that's
[36:41.560 --> 36:46.080]  the hotel that it would be at, because the hotel is hidden from view, it's right on the
[36:46.080 --> 36:47.080]  coastline.
[36:47.080 --> 36:55.000]  Yeah, but I mean, we have a Greek paper saying that they reportedly met here, but they can't
[36:55.000 --> 37:06.680]  give us the location, there's no photos, I don't know, it doesn't smell good to me.
[37:06.680 --> 37:14.760]  Well, Tony Godling on his website says that his source, who is called Maric Tysus, told
[37:14.760 --> 37:19.680]  him that it would be in Athens and that it would either be from the 1st to the 4th of
[37:19.680 --> 37:27.440]  May or from the 8th to the 11th of May, and that the hotel was booked up completely for
[37:27.440 --> 37:28.440]  those two days.
[37:28.440 --> 37:34.920]  But, I mean, it doesn't say what hotel it is, so at the moment we can't be sure, though
[37:34.920 --> 37:39.600]  on his website Godling states, quote, this year was the most difficult ever to discover
[37:39.600 --> 37:42.200]  where and when Bilderberg met.
[37:42.200 --> 37:47.240]  Intelligence gathered, the 2008 conference would take place in Greece on one of the first
[37:47.240 --> 37:48.960]  two weekends in May.
[37:48.960 --> 37:54.080]  We failed to positively identify the date and location before this year's private meeting
[37:54.080 --> 38:00.520]  of Bilderberg, and then it goes on, so Godling is saying basically it's the first time since
[38:00.520 --> 38:06.760]  the early 90s that the alternative media have completely messed covering the Bilderberg
[38:06.760 --> 38:07.760]  meeting.
[38:07.760 --> 38:14.160]  I believe it's longer than that, Tucker has always learned the location for over 30 years.
[38:14.160 --> 38:19.640]  I know it was 33 years, he said, when we were in Canada, so that's two years ago, that's
[38:19.640 --> 38:25.280]  got to be 35 years, so I guess 34 is how many he's made it to the last one.
[38:25.280 --> 38:35.840]  Of course, in Turkey, in Istanbul, formerly Constantinople, Paul, what else do you think
[38:35.840 --> 38:38.040]  about the situation?
[38:38.040 --> 38:44.840]  Well, from before 9-11, whenever Bilderberg met, there was one or two press reports,
[38:44.840 --> 38:46.680]  maybe in Reuters.
[38:46.680 --> 38:54.080]  After 9-11, it was a handful, and then going up to 2006 where you protested Bilderberg,
[38:54.080 --> 38:57.720]  that's when the dam broke, and there were hundreds of articles about it.
[38:57.720 --> 39:02.840]  There are always at least two dozen articles now about Bilderberg in the days before and
[39:02.840 --> 39:06.640]  the days after it happened, apart from this Greek news website article, there are none
[39:06.640 --> 39:07.640]  whatsoever.
[39:07.640 --> 39:13.680]  And they got a photo, reportedly, of Bilderberg group members, it looks like Henry Kissinger
[39:13.680 --> 39:17.000]  here, and I guess they've got a photo.
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.400]  We need somebody who can translate Greek, or we translated some of it, Steve Watson's
[39:22.400 --> 39:27.880]  translating the rest of it right now, and as you said, we've got Tony, we need to, I
[39:27.880 --> 39:28.880]  guess, call Tony.
[39:28.880 --> 39:31.920]  I think of all the people we've been calling, maybe we haven't called him, he's in the
[39:31.920 --> 39:35.880]  book in there for folks who are listening to the show.
[39:35.880 --> 39:36.880]  Go ahead, Paul.
[39:36.880 --> 39:47.160]  Well, yeah, as you mentioned earlier, it's not unheard of, but it's rare that they convene
[39:47.160 --> 39:52.600]  at the start of May, it's normally at the end of May into early June.
[39:52.600 --> 39:56.840]  Last year in Turkey, it was then the end of May into the start of June in Canada, the
[39:56.840 --> 40:03.000]  year before it was the 8th to the 11th of June, although in 2005, when they met in Germany,
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.840]  it was May 5th to 8th, but that's the only case within the last 10 years, from what I
[40:07.840 --> 40:13.960]  can see from doing 10 minutes of checking that they met in the first, basically, just
[40:13.960 --> 40:19.000]  after the first week of May, normally at the end of May or into June.
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.920]  Well, here's a reported translation of it, but it isn't the best.
[40:23.920 --> 40:29.160]  It says in Greece, currently happening, according to information, the World Congress of Secret
[40:29.160 --> 40:37.440]  Club Bilderberg, which has brought Paparazzi, I mean, I don't know what that says, for the
[40:37.440 --> 40:43.400]  chances of the world, but also, this is where prime ministers are nominated, it should be
[40:43.400 --> 40:50.440]  stressed that according to the infamy that circulates around the club Bilderberg, they
[40:50.440 --> 40:56.600]  play for some reason the role of an informed world government, yet this is translated from
[40:56.600 --> 41:00.760]  Greek using babel fish or something, so it's not that good of a translation.
[41:00.760 --> 41:05.360]  Some say, indeed, that anything important that has happened in the planet over the past
[41:05.360 --> 41:13.680]  51 years has first been discussed and organized in her meetings, the club meets for four days
[41:13.680 --> 41:20.200]  each year in different sites, countries, and 120 politicians, businessmen, journalists,
[41:20.200 --> 41:27.000]  only from the 30 until 35 selected NATO countries participate, participants are prohibited to
[41:27.000 --> 41:33.280]  speak to the press or anyone else, and anything they learn, they are not allowed to mention
[41:33.280 --> 41:38.800]  where they heard it, further they even go as far as to deny that they were there, it
[41:38.800 --> 41:45.560]  is prohibited for them to tell their home parliaments of their countries if they are politicians
[41:45.560 --> 41:52.040]  too, big Greek interests are there in the list of persons that participate in the meetings
[41:52.040 --> 41:57.000]  of the club in question, according to information, in the meeting of the club Bilderberg from
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.560]  88 to 2007, have participated, and then it lists some Greek people that have participated,
[42:02.560 --> 42:09.400]  the only Greek journalist that has taken part in the meetings of the club is Alexis Papahilas,
[42:09.400 --> 42:15.120]  in the meeting at the same time they appear to participate in general director of Coca-Cola,
[42:15.120 --> 42:19.200]  and then it just goes on, that's the end of the article, it doesn't even really say where
[42:19.200 --> 42:26.080]  they met or how they met there, Paul, what's your gut on this story, I mean I believe the
[42:26.080 --> 42:30.840]  Greek press believes they've met, they just don't, why would they not mention where they
[42:30.840 --> 42:37.520]  met or what hotel, they have a photo, well yeah, it's badly translated, but even though
[42:37.520 --> 42:43.520]  you can tell that there's barely any detail there, so it's not this stage, it's unreliable,
[42:43.520 --> 42:48.280]  I mean the Trial Actual Commission only finished their meeting on April 28th, and they're
[42:48.280 --> 42:52.640]  not normally this close together, they're normally separated by at least a month, maybe
[42:52.640 --> 42:57.840]  even two so, because some of the same people are obviously going to be at both meetings,
[42:57.840 --> 43:04.520]  and Trial Actual Commission meeting was in D.C. this year, so not as if it's, you know,
[43:04.520 --> 43:10.480]  close by, so we're, of course Paul, none of these groups exist, you're insane, we're
[43:10.480 --> 43:16.360]  talking about it, well yeah, and of course, Bilderberg is just a talking shop, has a Roth
[43:16.360 --> 43:24.640]  cost, the author of the new super class book that on your show, even though Bilderberg predicted
[43:24.640 --> 43:32.880]  the oil prices would rise beyond $120 before the end of 2008, and they've already passed
[43:32.880 --> 43:39.360]  that within five months of 2008, so they have no influence whatsoever, I mean.
[43:39.360 --> 43:46.960]  The BBC report, they found documents that Bilderberg had set the agenda for the integrated
[43:46.960 --> 43:53.040]  European community, and even the single currency as way back as the 50s when they first started
[43:53.040 --> 43:57.720]  meeting, so they have no influence whatsoever, obviously, they say what's going to happen,
[43:57.720 --> 43:59.520]  and it happens.
[43:59.520 --> 44:05.640]  Well, they've been right so far, they're now talking about $200 barrel oil, Kissinger
[44:05.640 --> 44:10.360]  said that was the goal two years ago, what do you, what do you think's going on here,
[44:10.360 --> 44:11.360]  Paul?
[44:11.360 --> 44:16.720]  With this meeting, well, we need to talk to Gosling, and we need to talk to Esteline,
[44:16.720 --> 44:23.920]  I mean, Esteline hasn't updated his English version website since the end of last year,
[44:23.920 --> 44:29.520]  so we need to know what he's been doing, and if he's got any information on it, because
[44:29.520 --> 44:36.320]  those are the two people that are going to know about it, and if it's taken place.
[44:36.320 --> 44:44.240]  We just confirmed Tony Gosling from London in the two o'clock hour, so about two hours
[44:44.240 --> 44:51.040]  and 20 minutes from now, Paul Watson shifting gears for the rest of this segment, what do
[44:51.040 --> 44:54.000]  you think is most important that's happening right now, what are some of the things you're
[44:54.000 --> 45:00.920]  working on, on the economy, the gear up for war with Iran, Iran is suing the US for funding
[45:00.920 --> 45:07.080]  al-Qaeda groups, real al-Qaeda, blowing up some of their mosque, what do you think about
[45:07.080 --> 45:14.800]  what's developing here domestically with the tasers, where they're telling doctors they
[45:14.800 --> 45:18.440]  can't say tasers kill people, I mean, I'm just throwing a grab bag out there, I want
[45:18.440 --> 45:21.640]  your take on what you think's most important right now.
[45:21.640 --> 45:29.040]  Well, what's worrying me is that now there are many UK police with tasers, and the way
[45:29.040 --> 45:33.120]  they're pushing the police data in this country at the moment, as I wrote about at the end
[45:33.120 --> 45:42.880]  of last week, is by these environmental crime units, and the case as I cited included the
[45:42.880 --> 45:48.920]  man who allegedly, I mean, there's no evidence that he did, but some jobs were, these people
[45:48.920 --> 45:55.040]  get paid bonuses for writing tickets, stopped him in the street and claimed that he dropped
[45:55.040 --> 46:01.040]  an apple core, which is completely biodegradable anyway, it's actually good for the earth,
[46:01.040 --> 46:08.960]  he ended up spending 18 hours in jail, he was put in a DNA database, he was shackled
[46:08.960 --> 46:14.320]  and later taken to court, all for the crime of dropping an apple core, and there are similar
[46:14.320 --> 46:22.480]  cases every week, there was a woman who bought a sausage roll for a young daughter, and as
[46:22.480 --> 46:27.000]  she was feeding it to her, a little bit dropped on the street, it was immediately swooped up
[46:27.000 --> 46:34.040]  and eaten by pigeons, but again, these two environmental crime unit officers immediately
[46:34.040 --> 46:39.200]  rushed across the street to stop her, and she ended up getting a fine and having to
[46:39.200 --> 46:41.240]  go to court, so that's-
[46:41.240 --> 46:46.600]  Now let's be clear, let's be clear, I've told everybody Singapore is the model, you
[46:46.600 --> 46:53.200]  drop a bubblegum wrapper one year in prison, you'll also be caned until your back is bloody,
[46:53.200 --> 46:58.200]  the cameras are in all public bathroom stalls, the government tests in different sectors,
[46:58.200 --> 47:06.240]  different drugs in the water, I know the people involved in it, it is unbelievable, and they
[47:06.240 --> 47:09.920]  are going to create in the US, we have two million cops, they're saying they're going
[47:09.920 --> 47:17.360]  to have two million in viral cops by 2011, and I told you five years in jail for a double
[47:17.360 --> 47:23.240]  play battery that your child drops out of a toy, a piece of garbage in your yard, huge
[47:23.240 --> 47:27.840]  fines, notice now they're arresting people for no turn signal, no seatbelt, this is
[47:27.840 --> 47:34.200]  going to be total micromanagement, the CPS is going to be expanded, total control, you
[47:34.200 --> 47:37.000]  think it's bad now folks, get ready Paul.
[47:37.000 --> 47:42.960]  Yeah, I mean it's another tax as well, I mean they can just walk up to you and claim you
[47:42.960 --> 47:49.480]  dropped a cigarette boat or whatever, if you pay the 50lbs fine which is $100 instantly
[47:49.480 --> 47:56.560]  then they leave you alone, it's like the mafia insurance policy, but if you resist it then
[47:56.560 --> 48:01.280]  you're going to get arrested, you're going to go to court and meanwhile they just released
[48:01.280 --> 48:08.240]  a 40 year old guy for having sex with an 11 year old girl because the judge said it
[48:08.240 --> 48:12.480]  was consensual and he's completely free to roam the streets, but if you drop an apple
[48:12.480 --> 48:18.480]  call, watch out, the rapist, the paedophiles can go free, but you know if you've got your
[48:18.480 --> 48:22.760]  trash can seven inches open then you're going to go to court.
[48:22.760 --> 48:27.720]  Now let's be clear here, people are arrested for flying unauthorized flags on their homes
[48:27.720 --> 48:35.360]  in England, they spend millions of pounds a year with secret police eating in restaurants
[48:35.360 --> 48:42.000]  for racist words, for your conversations, we have the headlines there, this is all coming
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.840]  here, it's the same thing, secret police everywhere, but you're not for racism, well
[48:46.840 --> 48:50.600]  then secret police should be listening to you in cafes, but really we know it's for
[48:50.600 --> 48:56.240]  other things, they ban demonstrations in most areas of England, the police if you're getting
[48:56.240 --> 49:01.840]  crowds and start talking, come over and demand who you are, put you in a terror database,
[49:01.840 --> 49:04.120]  this is the total control, Paul.
[49:04.120 --> 49:11.920]  Yeah, and they introduce it on the platform of micromanaging behavior, most people in
[49:11.920 --> 49:19.720]  this country support the smoking ban, but what it led to was thousands of council spies
[49:19.720 --> 49:26.600]  that went around town centers going into bars and trying to find people who were smoking,
[49:26.600 --> 49:31.640]  so again they could hand out the instant fire if they refused to get arrested, so it's brought
[49:31.640 --> 49:37.240]  in on the basis of all this environmental ninning, whereas the real environmental crises go
[49:37.240 --> 49:44.000]  completely ignored, which the government is mainly responsible for, but it allows them
[49:44.000 --> 49:51.800]  to introduce this new cadre of starsy like and viral spies and it's a huge stealth tax
[49:51.800 --> 49:53.480]  mechanism on top of it.
[49:53.480 --> 49:58.080]  And meanwhile in the U.S. if you're at a major college and a group of Boy Scouts come
[49:58.080 --> 50:01.880]  by and you work for the administration and you give them a speech about the Constitution
[50:01.880 --> 50:06.800]  Bill of Rights, Homeland Security comes and says we'll arrest you for espionage and terror
[50:06.800 --> 50:09.200]  if you ever teach the Constitution again.
[50:09.200 --> 50:14.000]  Well, I just told you that the terrorists are in charge now, aren't they?
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.320]  And by the way, listeners, we're not joking about any of this and when Paul said that
[50:19.320 --> 50:26.800]  the guy dropped an apple core, allegedly, got 18 hours shackled, put in a DNA database.
[50:26.800 --> 50:30.880]  That is admitted and the papers are saying it's good.
[50:30.880 --> 50:36.480]  Meanwhile, groups of hoodlums are not arrested and if you've been attacked and robbed five
[50:36.480 --> 50:41.360]  times and finally got an old shotgun you hid and shot the person as they're trying to rape
[50:41.360 --> 50:44.480]  your wife, you get sent to prison for life.
[50:44.480 --> 50:53.480]  Paul, stay with us.
[50:53.480 --> 50:57.960]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history comes

[51:10.960 --> 51:15.760]  family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[51:15.760 --> 51:17.720]  crime are brought to justice.
[51:17.720 --> 51:21.160]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[51:21.160 --> 51:25.600]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases, to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change
[51:25.600 --> 51:28.840]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[51:51.800 --> 51:53.160]  to Big Brother.
[51:53.160 --> 51:58.280]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[51:58.280 --> 52:00.800]  disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[52:00.800 --> 52:04.880]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and
[52:04.880 --> 52:06.560]  our high stress lifestyles.
[52:06.560 --> 52:10.680]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[52:10.680 --> 52:15.160]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized
[52:15.160 --> 52:16.160]  water.

[52:53.600 --> 52:57.760]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[52:57.760 --> 53:01.760]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[53:01.760 --> 53:02.760]  the water?
[53:02.760 --> 53:06.400]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed
[53:06.400 --> 53:07.600]  into the skin.
[53:07.600 --> 53:12.260]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to

[53:17.800 --> 53:19.120]  algae, and fungus.
[53:19.120 --> 53:23.960]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever
[53:23.960 --> 53:24.960]  comes first.
[53:24.960 --> 53:29.160]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[53:29.160 --> 53:31.200]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[53:54.680 --> 54:01.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.040]  a war on for your mind.
[54:03.040 --> 54:08.840]  So your children right now are in public school being taught, go green, green, green, I think
[54:08.840 --> 54:15.040]  shown cartoons and movies about going green and sounds reasonable, be nice to the animals,
[54:15.040 --> 54:20.800]  don't litter, save the earth, oh let's cut back on our carbon emissions.
[54:20.800 --> 54:27.160]  They're just culturally legitimizing armed and viral police everywhere, micromanaging
[54:27.160 --> 54:32.000]  every facet of your life, making the commoner criminals.
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.960]  So that the criminal mastermind state has an excuse to be involved in your life.
[54:36.960 --> 54:41.080]  We're not joking about any of this, you think you can hide out and try to work and pay your
[54:41.080 --> 54:45.880]  taxes and be left alone and drive the speed limit and keep your head down, you're going
[54:45.880 --> 54:50.200]  to have CPS come, you're going to have your injections, you're going to have your Enviro
[54:50.200 --> 54:56.280]  Cops, you're going to enjoy it, it's all part of your new system, or we could stand
[54:56.280 --> 55:01.040]  up and fight back against it I guess, but then you're with Al Qaeda criticizing your
[55:01.040 --> 55:05.840]  government's Al Qaeda, Paul it's getting really bad in England, I mean I've experienced
[55:05.840 --> 55:10.680]  it on your streets, what else is going on over there, because you are a beta test for
[55:10.680 --> 55:12.560]  a lot of stuff that then happens here.
[55:12.560 --> 55:19.240]  Well the most disturbing thing in recent weeks is the fact that if you live in England, I
[55:19.240 --> 55:24.200]  don't know it's probably the same in the US, but they have what are called catchment areas
[55:24.200 --> 55:29.840]  whereby a family has to live within a certain area to send their children to a certain local
[55:29.840 --> 55:31.360]  school.
[55:31.360 --> 55:36.640]  Now one of the councils, and it later emerged that this was going on nationwide, they were
[55:36.640 --> 55:44.240]  applying anti-terrorism powers to track terror suspects in order to spy on a family to try
[55:44.240 --> 55:49.880]  and work out if they were lying about living outside the catchment area of the school.
[55:49.880 --> 55:55.240]  They were actually watching when they left the house, tracking them, following them when
[55:55.240 --> 55:56.240]  they got back.
[55:56.240 --> 56:00.640]  So they use the same thing here, yes, and they use NSA satellites now to watch us and
[56:00.640 --> 56:05.560]  control us, and to see if you build a barn on your house, the whole military is being
[56:05.560 --> 56:07.240]  swung around against us.
[56:07.240 --> 56:12.720]  Because all the real terrorists aren't government run, so they're using the anti-terror laws
[56:12.720 --> 56:13.720]  against families.
[56:13.720 --> 56:19.040]  There's a new one today, council that snoops on parents now uses anti-terror laws to spy
[56:19.040 --> 56:25.120]  on fishermen, and they're using it to spy on fishermen who are accused of gathering
[56:25.120 --> 56:30.520]  shellfish in prohibited areas of the harbor, and it's in the same area.
[56:30.520 --> 56:36.320]  So that's the kind of tyranny that's going on here at the moment.
[56:36.320 --> 56:41.920]  And as the economy's implode, as the fiat system implodes by design, they're just going
[56:41.920 --> 56:46.080]  to add more and more and more and more people to squeeze us.
[56:46.080 --> 56:50.520]  I wonder how much the public's going to put up with Paul?
[56:50.520 --> 56:56.880]  But not a lot more, according to the articles I've read, because all the comments after
[56:56.880 --> 57:01.600]  them, because newspaper articles on the internet now allow people to comment, which they didn't
[57:01.600 --> 57:06.840]  do before, but it's almost universal, but they're all talking about, this is proof
[57:06.840 --> 57:08.960]  we need a revolution, we need it now.
[57:08.960 --> 57:15.160]  I mean, they sound like Alex Jones when they're daily mail readers and just average British
[57:15.160 --> 57:19.640]  people, so people are angry about it.
[57:19.640 --> 57:23.520]  And the government's answer is to build more prisons and hire more cops and try to intimidate
[57:23.520 --> 57:29.640]  people and try to hire bedwetting pastors to tell their flocks to go along with it in
[57:29.640 --> 57:31.440]  England, in the U.S.
[57:31.440 --> 57:35.920]  And I got news, a gaggle of criminal SWAT team members with bedwetting preachers, isn't
[57:35.920 --> 57:38.440]  going to win your new old order for you, boys.
[57:38.440 --> 57:39.920]  Certainly not.
[57:39.920 --> 57:48.120]  I mean, the labor government just got voted out almost universally in all the local councils,
[57:48.120 --> 57:51.560]  but it's not going to make any difference, the same policies are going to be continued.
[57:51.560 --> 57:55.920]  So if they think by voting out labor, I mean, that's the trick that's going to be played
[57:55.920 --> 57:56.920]  on others.
[57:56.920 --> 57:57.920]  It was played on you.
[57:57.920 --> 57:58.920]  They're just going to put the Tories in.
[57:58.920 --> 58:02.360]  Yeah, we've had the right wing, now they're going to give us the left wing.
[58:02.360 --> 58:05.640]  You've had the left wing, now they're going to be the right wing, who all vote identical.
[58:05.640 --> 58:10.800]  Yeah, they're all billed a bit, because they're elected as well.
[58:10.800 --> 58:13.360]  Paul Lawson, I really appreciate you popping in with us.
[58:13.360 --> 58:17.600]  Tony Gosling from the U.K., Builderberg.org will be popping in in two hours.
[58:17.600 --> 58:22.600]  Robert Gaylen-Ross is scheduled to be orbiting into studio here in the next 20 months or
[58:22.600 --> 58:26.440]  so, and we've got a ton of other news and your phone calls in the queue.
[58:26.440 --> 58:27.440]  I'm Alex Jones.
[58:27.440 --> 58:35.400]  This is the one, the only GCN radio network.

[58:37.880 --> 58:43.920]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:43.920 --> 58:48.160]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[58:48.160 --> 58:52.720]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:52.720 --> 58:55.040]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[58:55.040 --> 58:58.720]  Could their objective be world domination?
[58:58.720 --> 59:01.880]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:01.880 --> 59:07.800]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[59:07.800 --> 59:12.240]  of humanity is at hand.
[59:12.240 --> 59:17.680]  Over the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:17.680 --> 59:21.560]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[59:21.560 --> 59:24.240]  Builderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:24.240 --> 59:25.240]  Most people have no idea.
[59:25.240 --> 59:26.240]  They're not after money.
[59:26.240 --> 59:27.240]  They have all the money they need.
[59:27.240 --> 59:28.240]  They're after power.
[59:28.240 --> 59:29.240]  Yes, they're after easier.
[59:29.240 --> 59:36.000]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com, or watch it online right now

[59:46.000 --> 59:58.280]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:58.280 --> 59:59.680]  Government cover-ups.
[59:59.680 --> 1:00:00.680]  You want answers?
[1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:02.880]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:02.880 --> 1:00:07.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:07.040 --> 1:00:11.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:18.040]  Robert Gatlin-Ross will be with us for about an hour and a half, then we'll cover more
[1:00:18.040 --> 1:00:19.040]  news for 30 minutes.
[1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:24.320]  Then we've got Tony Gosling joining us at Builderberg Group, Arting Mead of the Hood
[1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:25.320]  Winctus.
[1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:31.160]  We'll try to find out with this leading source of info on the subject.
[1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:36.320]  Coming up, I know we've got John and George and Scott and Mike and others.
[1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:40.560]  John disagrees, so he'll go to the first of the line here in just a moment before I bring
[1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:41.560]  in Gatlin.
[1:00:41.560 --> 1:00:43.360]  But I'm going to take calls early in the interview with Gatlin.
[1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:49.840]  I'm going to really try to do that so everybody stay with us, 1-800-259-9231.
[1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:53.760]  Before I go to you, we will be encoding live.
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:01:00.400]  We will be streaming live this next hour and a half long interview with Robert Gatlin-Ross
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:03.400]  for prisonplanet.tv members.
[1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:07.640]  We have guests every week in studio, sometimes multiple times weekly.
[1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:10.880]  We also put up my weekly TV report that's in studio here in Austin that I've been doing
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:12.600]  for 13 years.
[1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:17.280]  We also take the Sunday show that we videotape and put it on the web.
[1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:18.840]  You see my films first.
[1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:24.200]  You'll be able to see 9-11, Truth Rising, July 4th.
[1:01:24.200 --> 1:01:27.800]  So that is going to be coming up.
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:30.760]  A prisonplanet.tv exclusive in super high quality.
[1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:34.520]  You can burn it to disk all day long and give them to people.
[1:01:34.520 --> 1:01:39.120]  9-11 Chronicles, part one, Truth Rising.
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:40.800]  There's only going to be two showings of this.
[1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:43.800]  There'll be showings of it a month and a half before it's officially released.
[1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:49.200]  That's this Saturday in Austin, Texas for Texas listeners and folks in surrounding areas,
[1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:50.680]  mainly the Central Texas audience.
[1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:52.200]  You can go to infowars.com.
[1:01:52.200 --> 1:01:57.640]  All tickets are left and get tickets for the Saturday matinee at 3.30 at the Alamo Ritz
[1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:03.320]  in downtown Austin or Sunday at 6.30 p.m. and I'll be there giving a 30-minute speech
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:07.120]  before each showing.
[1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:09.440]  So the film is 99% done.
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:14.080]  There'll only be a few tweaks from what you see at these screenings and we're doing these
[1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:19.480]  screenings to get your feedback, you know, to get your response to the film so you can
[1:02:19.480 --> 1:02:25.400]  email us and tell us what you thought and then it goes directly to DVD.
[1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:33.440]  So we do hope to see everybody out there this Saturday at 3.30 and of course this Sunday
[1:02:33.440 --> 1:02:39.160]  at 6.30 for the two showings of Truth Rising, which is totally different than any other
[1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:40.160]  film I've made.
[1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:41.720]  This is my 19th film.
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:47.000]  It is Cinema Verite, No Voice Over and very little of Alex Jones.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:48.680]  It's just amazing.
[1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:49.680]  Wait till you see it.
[1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:52.880]  Okay, you'll get your sneak peek this Saturday and Sunday.
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:57.080]  Let's go to John in Illinois because he disagrees, so we weren't going to call right at this
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:02:58.080]  point.
[1:02:58.080 --> 1:02:59.080]  We will for him.
[1:02:59.080 --> 1:03:00.080]  Go ahead, John.
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:01.080]  Okay, Alex.
[1:03:01.080 --> 1:03:08.040]  This is about the selling of gold and the apparent destruction of the U.S. dollar and I know
[1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:11.800]  there's a bit of confusion about what's going on and I've been studying the matter for the
[1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:14.720]  last six years and I've learned quite a bit.
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:20.000]  But before we touch on that, we don't have two hours so just go ahead and make your point.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:29.720]  Okay, well, the seeming paradox of them selling gold to prop up the dollar, this has more
[1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:33.640]  to do with trying to stop the gold carry trade from collapsing.
[1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:34.640]  Well, I agree.
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:38.520]  I mean, it's very complex and I studied it all the time and I can barely grasp it.
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:44.480]  Yes, and also I've been advertising a prison planet for the last three weeks.
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:46.920]  I have a rolling banner for down.
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:52.280]  To page 911truth.org, we're sponsoring Richard Gage on May 30th.
[1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:53.280]  Good.
[1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:57.600]  So if any of the Chicago area listeners will please go down to that banner and click on
[1:03:57.600 --> 1:03:58.600]  it.
[1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:01.760]  They can pre-purchase tickets and help support Richard Gage and his important work.
[1:04:01.760 --> 1:04:02.760]  Fantastic.
[1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:08.680]  We've had Gage on many times and he's in 9-11 Chronicles Part 1 Truth Rising, so I appreciate
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:09.680]  your call.
[1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:15.280]  I will tell you, sir, though, that I would really ask listeners to only reserve the
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:22.800]  I disagree point to actually disagree.
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:26.560]  You know, we don't screen your calls other than what's your first name, where you're
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:27.560]  calling from.
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:32.080]  You can be calling from Albuquerque, New Mexico and claim your calling from Timbuktu, as far
[1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:33.080]  as I care.
[1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:36.480]  But if you call in and volunteer, you disagree, you go to the front of the line.
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:40.760]  But then most of you don't really disagree and I don't like that.
[1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:41.760]  But say lobby.
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:43.320]  I mean, let's be intellectually honest here.
[1:04:43.320 --> 1:04:44.320]  I'm not being mean to you, sir.
[1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:46.320]  I just don't think you really disagreed much with me there.
[1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:50.520]  I think that was more the way to get on the air and plug something, which is fine.
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:52.480]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:57.000]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:58.560]  hour there is hope.
[1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:01.600]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:05.800]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:07.320]  World Order master plan.
[1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:11.560]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:05:11.560 --> 1:05:16.760]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:19.840]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:24.440]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly
[1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:27.440]  to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:31.600]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this
[1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:33.040]  online video library.
[1:05:33.040 --> 1:05:37.320]  By weekly news, television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much
[1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:38.320]  more.
[1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:43.960]  The war is waiting for you to set it free, join PrisonPlanet.tv, burn the info bombs
[1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:51.960]  to disc, put them on the file sharing networks, bring down the New World Order, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:05:51.960 --> 1:05:53.840]  Hi, neighbor.
[1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:56.040]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[1:05:56.040 --> 1:05:59.800]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[1:05:59.800 --> 1:06:05.040]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[1:06:05.040 --> 1:06:09.120]  You know about genetically poisoned food. Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with
[1:06:09.120 --> 1:06:13.840]  the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:18.440]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:22.760]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:27.080]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan
[1:06:27.080 --> 1:06:28.520]  for America.
[1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:33.160]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose
[1:06:33.160 --> 1:06:37.240]  to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:43.440]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:51.240]  Call 800-409-5633.
[1:06:51.240 --> 1:06:54.200]  Are you concerned about cholesterol, blood pressure?
[1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:56.240]  Are you experiencing chest pain?
[1:06:56.240 --> 1:07:00.240]  Are you looking for a more natural method to help improve your health issues?
[1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:04.360]  My husband has had lots of blood pressure problems.
[1:07:04.360 --> 1:07:06.600]  It would just be really high.
[1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:10.480]  The doctor had worked with him and he'd give him some medication for a little while.
[1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:14.280]  It would maybe work and then it wouldn't.
[1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:18.320]  He was going back and forth and my husband's not the time that he wants to go to the doctor
[1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:19.320]  anyway.
[1:07:19.320 --> 1:07:21.120]  He'll wait till he is in major problems.
[1:07:21.120 --> 1:07:27.320]  So a friend gave us a bottle of cardivate and he started on it and within a very short
[1:07:27.320 --> 1:07:30.200]  time, I'm going to say two weeks at the most, it was just really hard.
[1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:34.960]  He was leveling out and as long as he's been on these, it has literally saved his life.
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:45.960]  To learn more, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at heartdrop.com, that's H-E-A-R-T-D-R-O-P.com.
[1:07:45.960 --> 1:07:55.160]  Call 1-877-928-8822.
[1:07:55.160 --> 1:07:59.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:07:59.960 --> 1:08:00.960]  You want answers?
[1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:03.240]  Well, so does he.
[1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:12.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:17.960]  Robert Galen Ross is in studio with us for the next hour and a half, maybe even longer
[1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:23.680]  than Tony Gosling from England, has the Bilderberg Group already met in Athens Drees.
[1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:27.680]  That's what a Greek newspaper is reporting, we'll see if that's true or a false start.
[1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:31.800]  You know, they have steering committee meetings that have thrown people off six years ago
[1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:35.440]  and it's happened before that as well, where they were having a steering committee with
[1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:36.920]  about 25, 30 members.
[1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:41.760]  The Library of Congress, K. Belly Hutchinson, was one of the U.S. representatives there.
[1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:44.680]  They had that about a month before they met in Europe.
[1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:47.800]  So we've seen this trick before, we'll be fleshing that out.
[1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:53.400]  We're going to take your calls early in the shower at 1-800-259-9231 and whatever the
[1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:58.240]  subject is, Galen Ross, Robert Galen Ross can comment on it.
[1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:01.600]  He worked with the NSA in intelligence.
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:06.240]  He then was international consultant to oil companies, lived all over the Middle East,
[1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:09.680]  all over the world and he's been fighting the New World Order for decades, written
[1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:12.740]  quite a few, very well received, very well-selling books.
[1:09:12.740 --> 1:09:17.280]  We carry quite a few of them at the online bookstore at infowars.com.
[1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:19.380]  Before we go to him, I'd like to just say this.
[1:09:19.380 --> 1:09:25.080]  I was watching early this morning, a clip of in-game on YouTube, just a little five
[1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:29.800]  minute clip, and I kind of sat back and said, man, I made this documentary.
[1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:31.360]  This is really good.
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:32.880]  And I thought, man, this needs to be seen.
[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:35.920]  It was like I was discovering someone else's work.
[1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:43.000]  And I was just realizing that I tend to not toot my horn, but this is quite a weapon.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:47.560]  And it really shows who the globalists are, what their master plan is, what they're doing,
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:50.080]  how to stop them.
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:52.160]  The film is two hours, 20 minutes long.
[1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:53.840]  It's got 40 minutes of extras on the DVD.
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:55.560]  It's got about three hours total.
[1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:56.560]  It's $19.95.
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:00.920]  You can get it for $9.95 when you get it with Terror Storm or some of the other films.
[1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:02.720]  This is how we support ourselves.
[1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:06.920]  This is how I hire more people, get better websites, better servers.
[1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:10.880]  This is how we buy better cameras, fly places and cover things.
[1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:15.840]  And I advertise on my own show that in-game is free on Google Video.
[1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:17.280]  And then I want you to go watch it there.
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:20.200]  And I want you to email it out to everybody.
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:23.640]  And in fact, I uploaded in-game myself to Google Video.
[1:10:23.640 --> 1:10:29.760]  The day it was released at PrismPlanet.tv, the day it was released on DVD.
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:31.880]  And why did I do that?
[1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:33.760]  Because this isn't about making money.
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:37.760]  Money is fuel that I put in my engine to fight the New World Order.
[1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:41.720]  We are a juggernaut of truth and liberty against them.
[1:10:41.720 --> 1:10:43.720]  And I literally see it as fuel.
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:49.320]  To me, who I am, telling the truth, being honorable, being truthful, fighting tyranny,
[1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:54.120]  defending my family name, trying to build a better world for those they're going to
[1:10:54.120 --> 1:10:58.480]  come in the future, that is what makes me tick.
[1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:04.040]  And I get so focused on that so often that we then don't call for capital and call for
[1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:07.400]  the capital we need to do bigger things.
[1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:11.400]  And I wasn't going to mention this right now because he got organized last week.
[1:11:11.400 --> 1:11:13.040]  The nice fellow keeps calling.
[1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:17.880]  He's the original guy that came up with the money bomb for Ron Paul and got picked up
[1:11:17.880 --> 1:11:22.720]  by others and carried one of my listeners.
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:25.360]  And he's got this Alex Jones money bomb.
[1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:28.280]  And I kind of thought about it over the weekend and people around the office have asked me,
[1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:29.280]  what are you going to do?
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:30.920]  You know, you need to put a PayPal link up.
[1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:31.920]  This guy wants you to.
[1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:33.920]  And I thought, should I do that?
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:36.360]  You know, I mean, I always raise money for other people.
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:38.480]  And I will say that, yes, we're going to get a PayPal up.
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:39.480]  In fact, that needs to happen.
[1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:41.960]  We need to make sure that's happening.
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:49.640]  And we need to, if you give us donations, we will buy better computers, better software,
[1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:52.040]  better effects for our films.
[1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:55.080]  We will, I mean, I'm already going to get a bigger office.
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:56.360]  We're out looking right now.
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:00.840]  But I will factor that into hiring more people, doing more.
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:06.400]  I need to get a second IT person full time because it's just overwhelming the amount
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:07.800]  of work that we've got to do here.
[1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:11.960]  We've got to grow fast because the new world order is making their move right now.
[1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:15.640]  So that said, there isn't even a PayPal up for this yet, but we'll, the next day or
[1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:18.520]  two, we'll link to the Money Bomb, the Alex Jones Money Bomb.
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:23.320]  I forget the address, but, but the Money Bomb right now is just go to infowars.com and buy
[1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:27.440]  Robert Galen Ross's books that we sell, that we support him to buy in game blueprint for
[1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:31.880]  global enslavement, have it on DVD, the high quality DVD, give it to people.
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:35.560]  And if you don't have money, watch it for free on Google video and pass it on to your
[1:12:35.560 --> 1:12:37.320]  email list.
[1:12:37.320 --> 1:12:38.560]  Show it to your friends and family.
[1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:40.200]  It's just, it's not that high quality.
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:45.240]  That's why we have prisonplanet.tv that is 15 cents a day.
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:48.840]  Because by having a prisonplanet.tv membership, it's in super high quality now.
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:52.280]  Two content distribution network servers, three other servers on it.
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:55.680]  I mean, it's just a beautiful system getting better and better all the time.
[1:12:55.680 --> 1:12:59.560]  We don't just have this live video feed we do every day for the listeners in the fourth
[1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:03.120]  hour, sometimes earlier, sometimes we do the whole show.
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:06.880]  It's now posted within an hour at the end of the show for you to watch how you want,
[1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:11.960]  when you want, where you want with the document cam and the guest cam and everything else
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:13.400]  that we bring you here.
[1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:16.880]  So I have not been really calling for your support lately.
[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:21.400]  I've been trying to just run off sponsorship and the little bit of videos we sell, but
[1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:25.760]  I start looking at the accounting as we're doing it and realize that if we had a lot
[1:13:25.760 --> 1:13:30.640]  more capital come in, I will dump it directly into the tip of the spear, directly into going
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:31.640]  after the globalist.
[1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:34.200]  Because I'm committed to this.
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:35.520]  I mean, I've cast the dice.
[1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:41.600]  The dice are rolled and I'm in this fight 110% and I've just been realizing why stand
[1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:44.240]  here idle, why not even work harder?
[1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:47.640]  Why not make three films this year like we're doing right now instead of one a year?
[1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:49.160]  Why not up the game?
[1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:51.120]  Why not update the websites?
[1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:54.640]  Why not make them a higher quality web 2.5 or whatever?
[1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:56.360]  Why not get more aggressive?
[1:13:56.360 --> 1:13:59.040]  I mean, if we're going to fight the new world, let's do it all the way.
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:02.960]  So I want to thank all of you that have supported us at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:06.440]  I want to thank all of you that have gotten the books and videos at infowars.com.
[1:14:06.440 --> 1:14:10.120]  We're called 888-253-3139.
[1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:13.920]  All of you that have purchased the books and videos, that is really a donation to us so
[1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:15.600]  we can continue what we're doing.
[1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:17.600]  And so I can also try to pay my people well.
[1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:18.600]  I like to pay them.
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:22.760]  They're not paid exorbitantly, but they're paid decent for people in media.
[1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:25.320]  Folks in media don't make a lot of money at the grassroots level.
[1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:30.640]  And I'd like to try to reward them, help them, make sure they can put food on their family's
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:31.640]  table.
[1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:35.400]  If the economy implodes, that's another reason I'm kind of like a squirrel for winter trying
[1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:38.960]  to get some nuts away because we don't run this like a profit business.
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:43.880]  If everything starts going to hell in a handbasket, it's starting to and our capital goes down
[1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:48.080]  and less money comes in, I'm just going to spend the savings I've accrued, which are
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:53.640]  modest but that are there to fund this, to go all the way until we ran out of money,
[1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:55.680]  until we aren't here.
[1:14:55.680 --> 1:15:01.160]  That's the goal, go all the way, like a missile that expends its fuel as it comes in for impact.
[1:15:01.160 --> 1:15:03.180]  We're not retreating.
[1:15:03.180 --> 1:15:06.360]  We're not going back and we're doing well, we're expanding, we're growing.
[1:15:06.360 --> 1:15:11.280]  My point is if we go into a depression, I am going to continue on as long as we can.
[1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:12.280]  And you need to realize that.
[1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:13.280]  Okay.
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:14.280]  There is my rant on that subject.
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:20.160]  I appreciate Robert Galin Ross joining us in studio and Robert, I'd like you to get
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:21.160]  into the economy.
[1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:26.200]  You've consulted internationally in finance, in oil, in commerce, you've worked in the
[1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:27.960]  government and intelligence.
[1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:31.840]  You've really, in the books you've written, forecasted a lot of what has actually developed
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:36.480]  in your film, you forecasted what would happen with the NAU, so I really respect your opinion
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:41.960]  and we want to bring you here as another one of our family of experts, wise men that know
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:46.440]  what's going on, to break down what's really happening with the economy.
[1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:50.160]  Then coming up at the bottom of the hour, we'll start taking calls and I want to shift gears
[1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:53.640]  into the global structure later and what their master plans are.
[1:15:53.640 --> 1:15:55.960]  But Robert, again, thank you for coming into studio.
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:56.960]  I really do appreciate it.
[1:15:56.960 --> 1:15:57.960]  Thank you.
[1:15:57.960 --> 1:15:58.960]  It's always a pleasure to be with you, Alex.
[1:15:58.960 --> 1:15:59.960]  Thanks for being here.
[1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:01.480]  You've got the floor.
[1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:03.440]  Please tell us what's happening with banking.
[1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:05.440]  Okay.
[1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:09.840]  The world financial system is in the meltdown.
[1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:16.760]  They won't admit that publicly, but the signs, the vital signs are showing up all the time
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:26.680]  and we can go back as far as February 27, 1995, when a fellow named Nick Leeson was
[1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:34.520]  one of the key people with the bearings in Southeast Asia.
[1:16:34.520 --> 1:16:43.240]  Bearings at the time they went under was the Britain's oldest bank and Leeson got to dealing
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:50.440]  in derivatives and he crashed the company in a very short period of time and bearings
[1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:56.040]  was a very large company at that time and so this is how vulnerable they are and I'm
[1:16:56.040 --> 1:17:04.720]  sure that all banks have put in safety valves and watch their people very closely to keep
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:08.200]  from being crashed like that again.
[1:17:08.200 --> 1:17:17.120]  But just recently, as just late as March 14, 2008, Bear Stearns went under.
[1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:31.200]  Bear Stearns in November of 2007 was righted by all the
[1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:44.200]  Securities Exchange Commission Goldman Sachs at $118 a share and so when they finally died
[1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:56.600]  in February, they were bought out by JP Morgan Chase at $2 a share and so this is how quick
[1:17:56.600 --> 1:17:58.440]  this could happen.
[1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:03.400]  Now there are others looming on the horizon.
[1:18:03.400 --> 1:18:11.520]  On May the 9th, 2008, the CEO of Citigroup announced that they were fiction to write
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:15.080]  off $400 billion of their assets.
[1:18:15.080 --> 1:18:20.920]  Now to them an asset is something like a mortgage or something like that.
[1:18:20.920 --> 1:18:29.520]  Most of these mortgages are worthless and so that's why they're writing them off.
[1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:41.880]  In the first quarter of 2008, Citigroup lost $5.1 billion.
[1:18:41.880 --> 1:18:46.040]  First quarter of 2007, they lost $10 billion.
[1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:51.760]  So Citigroup is really fiction to go under.
[1:18:51.760 --> 1:19:00.920]  But the Fed chairman, Bernanke, has already informed the public that no bank will go under.
[1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:03.440]  And he's saying, yeah, he said that today, he said, everything's wonderful.
[1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:07.720]  Meanwhile, the dollar's being devalued at about 30% a year now.
[1:19:07.720 --> 1:19:10.480]  There are millions of houses going into repossession.
[1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:12.200]  People are walking away from millions.
[1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:16.760]  Others, there's a huge contraction even in retail and the media is busy running around
[1:19:16.760 --> 1:19:18.840]  saying everything's wonderful.
[1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:24.520]  That's right, and they're saying that as a smokescreen, trying to hide what's really
[1:19:24.520 --> 1:19:27.200]  going on behind the curtain.
[1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:36.960]  And if you do a Google search for the MZM money supply, there's a chart on there that
[1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:41.720]  shows that the money supply is almost vertical right now.
[1:19:41.720 --> 1:19:44.480]  They're printing money like it's going out of style.
[1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:49.600]  Okay, there, Robert Gaylen, we're going to continue with what the global economic architects
[1:19:49.600 --> 1:19:50.600]  are up to.
[1:19:50.600 --> 1:19:55.280]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:19:55.280 --> 1:20:00.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:05.840]  It's known as the Builderberg, but their objective being world domination.
[1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:09.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:14.440]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80
[1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:19.360]  percent of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:19.360 --> 1:20:24.800]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:20:24.800 --> 1:20:28.720]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:31.320]  Builderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:33.120]  Most people have no idea they're not after money.
[1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:34.440]  They have all the money they need.
[1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:35.440]  They're after power.
[1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:36.440]  That's their after-easy.

[1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:53.440]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[1:22:53.440 --> 1:22:57.400]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at
[1:22:57.400 --> 1:22:58.400]  the pump.
[1:22:58.400 --> 1:23:02.440]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas
[1:23:02.440 --> 1:23:03.440]  mileage.
[1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:07.800]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a
[1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:13.440]  complete fuel system treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage
[1:23:13.440 --> 1:23:15.000]  and only one tank full.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:19.080]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your
[1:23:19.080 --> 1:23:20.080]  engine.
[1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:23.480]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline it's time to take action.
[1:23:23.480 --> 1:23:28.600]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment
[1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:31.320]  which is a $12.95 value free.
[1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:33.560]  Call Triple 8, use SFR 1.
[1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:40.800]  That number again is Triple 8, use SFR 1, or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:42.840]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:47.240]  Satisfaction is guaranteed, or your money back, and it's safe for all cars.
[1:23:47.240 --> 1:24:04.600]  Back now.
[1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:06.080]  Robert Gaylen Ross is our guest.
[1:24:06.080 --> 1:24:07.960]  Her call is coming up in the next segment.
[1:24:07.960 --> 1:24:12.040]  Host of issues we'll be discussing, going into the third hour.
[1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:16.480]  And Tony Gosling on the Bilderberg Rift joining us in the fourth hour today.
[1:24:16.480 --> 1:24:20.200]  Robert, continuing with the banking situation, please.
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:27.720]  Okay, for many years the Federal Reserve had their practice was to loan money to their
[1:24:27.720 --> 1:24:29.080]  member banks overnight.
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:34.240]  They would loan money to them today, but tomorrow they had to pay it back.
[1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:40.640]  And now the financial situation's gotten so bad now that the Fed now has extended overnight
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:42.960]  practice to 30 days.
[1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:49.560]  And even they say if you can't pay us back in 30 days, we'll consider extended that period.
[1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:54.480]  So it's really getting bad in the financial system.
[1:24:54.480 --> 1:25:02.520]  Now on September 2007, the Fed interest rate was 5.25%.
[1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:07.080]  On May the 2nd, 2008, they reduced this to 2%.
[1:25:07.080 --> 1:25:16.400]  And in an effort to try to stop this runaway financial problem.
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:24.280]  Now they also, the Bank of England has followed suit, they've told their banks that they're
[1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:31.920]  putting 50 billion pounds available for banks to aid in their financial situation.
[1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:38.960]  And the Japanese Central Bank has been running at 1.5% interest for years.
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:45.080]  And the Japanese have been, and a lot of other people are borrowing money from the Japanese
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:51.000]  Central Bank and buying assets around the world and it costs them 1.5% and then they
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.840]  make what they can off of that.
[1:25:53.840 --> 1:25:57.400]  But this is coming to an end.
[1:25:57.400 --> 1:26:06.000]  Now one of the major problems that is discussed publicly is what they call subprime lending
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.280]  problem.
[1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:16.640]  Now the best way to explain that is that a bank will lure someone into, like they want
[1:26:16.640 --> 1:26:25.720]  to buy a home, they'll offer them a low teaser rate interest, but it's variable.
[1:26:25.720 --> 1:26:33.800]  And so they calculate their monetary payments and the couple figure they can afford that.
[1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:40.520]  But within a few short years, all of a sudden they start kicking into these higher rates.
[1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:50.000]  And in many cases, the bank or lending institution don't even check on the credit availability
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.760]  of this couple.
[1:26:52.760 --> 1:26:58.240]  And so, and the reason they do that, just as soon as they loan the money, they don't
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:02.480]  keep that loan, they immediately turn around and sell that loan to someone else.
[1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:07.160]  And they also now count loans, as you just said, as an asset.
[1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:11.600]  So a debt is an asset, a liability is an asset, and they leverage that out with fractional
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:14.560]  reserve banking at least tenfold.
[1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:18.000]  And they leverage that again tenfold, just a Ponzi scheme to the sun.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:19.160]  That's right.
[1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:27.160]  Now the probably the best way to illustrate this is to take a can of mixed nuts.
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:33.800]  Let's say that I eat a lot of mixed nuts and they generally come in a clear plastic jar
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:35.240]  and you can see what's in it.
[1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:44.320]  But let's say that macadamia nuts sell for $13 a pound, pistachios for $11 a pound, cashews
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:49.200]  for $10 a pound, and peanuts, $8 a pound.
[1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:54.680]  Well these banks are now, instead of having a clear plastic container, they have a cardboard
[1:27:54.680 --> 1:27:58.440]  container or metal container, so you can't see what's in it.
[1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:04.600]  But the wrapper around this container shows a lot of macadamia nuts and a lot of pistachios
[1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:06.880]  and not many peanuts.
[1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:13.640]  But if you really, when you get around to opening that can, you'll find just very few macadamias,
[1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:18.080]  just a few more pistachios, maybe a handful of cashews.
[1:28:18.080 --> 1:28:20.240]  So it's another Carnival Barker scam.
[1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:21.240]  That's right.
[1:28:21.240 --> 1:28:26.120]  But in addition to having peanuts, they're even putting in stale and rancid peanuts in
[1:28:26.120 --> 1:28:32.000]  here, including peanuts that have rat feces in it.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.200]  So there's some rat droppings.
[1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:35.040]  That's right.
[1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:42.040]  And they package these with macadamia nuts on the wrapper and they sell these to other
[1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:44.600]  lending interstitials now.
[1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:46.880]  Who then leverage it out again and do the same thing.
[1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:47.880]  That's right.
[1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:50.880]  So pretty much it's like one peanut per package of rat turds.
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:52.280]  That's right.
[1:28:52.280 --> 1:28:59.360]  But now it's gotten so bad that for many years there was interbank lending practice.
[1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:02.880]  If one bank needs some cash, they just go to the bank next door and borrow money from
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:03.880]  them.
[1:29:03.880 --> 1:29:09.520]  Now, they won't loan one money to one other because the assets they're putting up for
[1:29:09.520 --> 1:29:14.400]  a collateral are these toxic waste peanuts.
[1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:17.320]  So the Great Ponzi scheme, it appears, is coming to an end.
[1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:21.080]  Well, let's talk about from your experience, living quite a long time, living in third
[1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:24.920]  world countries, where you think this is going to go, and is that why they're gearing
[1:29:24.920 --> 1:29:25.920]  up for martial law?
[1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:29.560]  Is that why they've been quietly militarizing for decades, knowing that they were going
[1:29:29.560 --> 1:29:32.400]  to implode the economy, and is it by design?
[1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:34.720]  You know, it certainly is in some sectors.
[1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:38.080]  We'll come back with Robert Beck, Gail and Ross, and your phone calls.
[1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:41.160]  Please stay with us.
[1:29:41.160 --> 1:29:42.440]  We're on the march.
[1:29:42.440 --> 1:29:44.880]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:50.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:54.920]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity
[1:29:54.920 --> 1:29:56.080]  theft each year.
[1:29:56.080 --> 1:30:00.800]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of

[1:31:16.760 --> 1:31:21.160]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:31:21.160 --> 1:31:23.920]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:31:23.920 --> 1:31:28.440]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[1:31:28.440 --> 1:31:33.120]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[1:31:33.120 --> 1:31:36.480]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind.

[1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:42.120]  People wonder how the New World Order can have such incredible power.
[1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:47.760]  They wonder how they can buy armies, countries, how they can come into every town and city,
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:51.840]  even small towns and spend a million, two million before they get your water because
[1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:54.040]  they care about you so much.
[1:33:54.040 --> 1:34:00.080]  How they can buy off anybody, anybody that will take their money because it's all fiat.
[1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:01.760]  They just make it out of nothing.
[1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:06.560]  They back it up and forth so they buy with their own fiat and then they train the society
[1:34:06.560 --> 1:34:08.280]  that debt is good, get into debt.
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:12.080]  The public schools, the colleges, it's come out, they have credit card agreements with
[1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:16.040]  the companies, public schools and colleges to tell the kids to take credit cards to get
[1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:20.440]  in debt, all designed to get you shackled, all designed to get control.
[1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:24.680]  And now after bubble, after bubble, after bubble, we're in the final bubbles that economists
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:29.920]  always said we would see before a total implosion and that is just a speculative bubble, not
[1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:36.680]  just speculative on real estate or speculative on one commodity or type of asset, but everything
[1:34:36.680 --> 1:34:42.160]  is going speculative food, other commodities, resources.
[1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:48.520]  And the government's response being doppled ganged and controlled by the private banks
[1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:54.360]  that own and control it is to beef up, to militarize, to build camps, to say the public
[1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:59.920]  is the enemy, that the government are the officials, the authorities, clearly in response
[1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:01.400]  to the population.
[1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:05.080]  Robert Galen Ross, before we get more into whether you think we're going to have a depression
[1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:11.320]  or not and how we're getting to this apex of the mega-bubble, the super-bubble, A, do
[1:35:11.320 --> 1:35:14.800]  you think that's why one of the reasons they're gearing up their police state and B, do you
[1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:17.040]  believe this was engineered by design?
[1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:22.680]  Alex, nothing of significance happens in the entire world that is not very carefully
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:26.400]  planned years in advance.
[1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:34.440]  These people hire the best and the brightest to do all this for them and they're just clay
[1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:42.040]  they're mold them any way they want to and so they make things happen and they don't
[1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:48.240]  need to, they don't care what happens tomorrow, they're really concerned about what's going
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:52.200]  to happen 10 years from now and it's all very carefully planned.
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:59.400]  Well, I harp on this a lot, but it's because it's a seminal source document, 2002 Joseph
[1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:02.360]  Stickles, Chief Economist, World Bank, he's a globalist, but he said he didn't believe
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:08.360]  in hurting people, they give him a 119-point plan that they've been using for decades,
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:13.000]  they were just now letting their economist in on this, one of many, but their top guy,
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:16.920]  who they just used for advice, but then they made the decisions where they went into countries
[1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:21.040]  and bought off the police, bought off the government over a multi-decade program, got
[1:36:21.040 --> 1:36:25.240]  everybody in debt, had the government not pay the debt back by design, then turn off
[1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:30.320]  all the utilities, cause riots to further depress all the stocks so they could come in
[1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:33.680]  and buy the whole country over pennies on the dollar, also signing agreements with the
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:38.800]  government to hand over ports, waterways, infrastructures, roads, government-owned
[1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:46.400]  utilities, government-owned telecommunications, oil companies, so, and he said what they did
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:49.720]  to the third world countries, they're now planning to do to the west, and I just had
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:53.920]  him on a few weeks ago again, he's been on the radio with us twice in an in-person video
[1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:58.400]  interview once, and he admitted, yes, they're engineering this, and I mean, we have the
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:04.360]  IMF documents where they're saying they're doing it, there's no debating it.
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:10.680]  Yeah, but you know, there's a strange guy behind the bushes that's taking care of this
[1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:15.720]  fellow named Hugo Chavez, president of Venezuela.
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:23.040]  The elite denigrate him, they say he's communist, he's a dictator, he's doing terrible things.
[1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:29.600]  To me, he's a hero because he has single-handedly stopped the creation of the American Union,
[1:37:29.600 --> 1:37:36.280]  and a number of the things that he's done is he's created what they call the Bank of
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:43.160]  the South, which is a central bank owned by Venezuela, or funded by Venezuela, Brazil,
[1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:44.160]  and Argentina.
[1:37:44.160 --> 1:37:49.200]  And they've now dumped the dollar, you can't buy their oil, and that's what 33%, 34% of
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:51.760]  our, all of our oil, can't buy it with dollars now.
[1:37:51.760 --> 1:37:56.920]  That's right, but they created this bank and they're loaning money to all the Latin American
[1:37:56.920 --> 1:38:03.000]  countries to pay off the IMF and World Bank loans early so they can get off them under
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:06.800]  this burden, and they loaned this money to them at very low interest rates.
[1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:09.160]  And so that's one question.
[1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:12.680]  By the way, I mean, you work for oil companies, you know, they're paying 18 cents a gallon
[1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:17.720]  in Venezuela, they're paying like 25 cents a gallon in Mexico, they're paying 14 cents
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:22.640]  a gallon for diesel in Mexico, just like we pay five, six times what somebody in Mexico
[1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:26.120]  pays for prescription drugs, we pay double what somebody in Europe.
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:31.520]  Why is it that Americans are seen as the schmuck cattle, we're just, we get treated the worst,
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:35.080]  our cops treat us the worst, everything, but we think we're free?
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:43.800]  Well, they've done the people down, they've done it, and it's very carefully planned,
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:49.040]  they've done them down in schools, and they provide them with information on the mass
[1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:51.440]  media that they want to be here.
[1:38:51.440 --> 1:39:01.000]  All of it is, it's designed psycho control, and so that they, they really don't protest
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:06.120]  what's going on, as long as they can have their six pack and watch their football game
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:08.320]  or play a game of pool.
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:09.320]  That's all I care.
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:12.440]  Now, speak of the devil, that may be what's coming next.
[1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:17.120]  I know you were around during the last Great Depression that they admit in mainline textbooks
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:18.800]  was engineered by the bankers.
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:23.840]  Maybe we should start there with what they did then in 1929, deepening for three years
[1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:29.080]  into the depths of it in late 33, compare that to, I mean, the bubble we've got now,
[1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:34.600]  the indebtedness we have now of every sector, private corporate government, the amount of
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:40.840]  leveraging, it's two different universes, I mean, 90% or 85% being rural then, now
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:46.240]  only 5% being self-sufficient today, I mean, we're talking about a recipe for absolute
[1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:47.240]  breakdown.
[1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:49.880]  I'm not saying it's going to happen, but there's a good chance it is.
[1:39:49.880 --> 1:39:52.800]  And if it does, I mean, this is going to be unbelievable.
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:40:02.040]  You know, the real truth is that from 1920 to 1929, the Federal Reserve started a very
[1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:03.560]  loose money policy.
[1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:06.960]  They would loan people money on anything.
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:13.920]  And so people started investing in stocks and bonds communities because they were going
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:15.720]  to get rich over it.
[1:40:15.720 --> 1:40:23.640]  And so in 1929, all of a sudden, they pulled in the money and they started calling loans.
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:27.640]  And people couldn't pay these loans and a lot of people committed suicide over it.
[1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:33.400]  But this was very carefully designed, one of the main reasons they did this is that
[1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:38.920]  at that point in 1913 is when they created the Federal Reserve.
[1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:41.960]  And so most of the money were in state banks.
[1:40:41.960 --> 1:40:45.600]  And a lot of the state banks wouldn't join the Federal Reserve system.
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:48.000]  So they said, well, all right, we'll go get them anyway.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:53.180]  So they said, we've got to crash these state banks and get their money.
[1:40:53.180 --> 1:40:57.400]  And so that was one of the main reasons for the 29 Depression.
[1:40:57.400 --> 1:40:58.400]  Absolutely.
[1:40:58.400 --> 1:41:02.760]  And of course, they had already engineered runs on banks before that's come out.
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:05.820]  National Banking Association documents have come out and they said, give us the Federal
[1:41:05.820 --> 1:41:06.820]  Reserve.
[1:41:06.820 --> 1:41:08.320]  There'll never be another recession.
[1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:10.320]  There'll never be another run.
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:11.320]  We promise.
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:16.160]  And then they engineered the 29 crash and then cut off all credit as they're getting ready
[1:41:16.160 --> 1:41:17.160]  to do now.
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:18.160]  That's right.
[1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:22.660]  And the stated purpose of the creation of the Federal Reserve was to normalize and
[1:41:22.660 --> 1:41:27.880]  steady the financial situation so they wouldn't have all these ups and downs.
[1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:33.240]  But every up and down that's happened in the financial world is created by the central
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:34.240]  banks.
[1:41:34.240 --> 1:41:35.800]  Well, look at what they're doing now.
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:39.560]  Just as the Federal Reserve got more power after they engineered the Great Depression,
[1:41:39.560 --> 1:41:42.640]  now they're saying, get rid of the three federal agencies that regulate us.
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:44.960]  And I'm not saying they're good, but they're corrupt and controlled.
[1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:47.160]  But at least it's some semblance of regulation.
[1:41:47.160 --> 1:41:49.400]  They said, let us run everything secretly.
[1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:53.100]  Get rid of these three federal agencies, let us run everything, and then everything will
[1:41:53.100 --> 1:41:54.100]  be OK.
[1:41:54.100 --> 1:41:57.120]  So they're saying, just, you know, we're the ones that have engineered this admittedly
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:04.800]  changing the rules for all this loaning, fiat to infinitum, just no limit to infinity.
[1:42:04.800 --> 1:42:07.640]  And now, so that's their formula.
[1:42:07.640 --> 1:42:09.000]  Always create a crisis.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:13.720]  And then as the crisis deepens, offer the next solution which expands their power.
[1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:17.840]  Then they deepen the next crisis even bigger, then they get more power, then they expand
[1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:20.320]  an even greater crisis and get more power.
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:21.800]  But now they're coming into total ownership.
[1:42:21.800 --> 1:42:27.520]  I mean, I've seen the numbers of thousands of trillions of liquid fiat they made that
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:29.040]  was accepted globally.
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:33.060]  They literally bought up the entire global infrastructure, except for a handful of private
[1:42:33.060 --> 1:42:34.920]  interest in Europe and the US.
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:38.360]  Now they're changing laws to take that for middle class people.
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:42.040]  And they write white paper saying they don't even need the peasants anymore.
[1:42:42.040 --> 1:42:48.600]  I mean, they have created this tsunami of liquidity, bought the world with it, and now they're
[1:42:48.600 --> 1:42:54.160]  going to turn that liquidity off and get what crumbs they didn't have.
[1:42:54.160 --> 1:42:58.000]  And all of the funds that they have are created out of thin air.
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:00.760]  They're not backed by anything.
[1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:08.560]  But I suggest you go to do a Google search on MZM money supply or money stock.
[1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:13.080]  MZM stands for money zero maturity.
[1:43:13.080 --> 1:43:18.720]  And that's made up of the M2 money supply and several other financial indicators.
[1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:26.640]  And I've got their data from the Federal Reserve and created a graph on that.
[1:43:26.640 --> 1:43:31.600]  And the last two or three years, that graph has gone vertical.
[1:43:31.600 --> 1:43:36.320]  Well, in fact, they have a lot of private groups that analyze it, and that's what they
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:37.320]  say.
[1:43:37.320 --> 1:43:41.280]  Bernanke stopped releasing the numbers 12 months ago.
[1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:42.640]  Did you want reverse engineer that?
[1:43:42.640 --> 1:43:43.640]  How did you get the numbers?
[1:43:43.640 --> 1:43:44.640]  The latest ones?
[1:43:44.640 --> 1:43:46.560]  No, I got it from St. Louis Fed.
[1:43:46.560 --> 1:43:50.920]  And the Fed, oh, you're talking about the internal money supply numbers.
[1:43:50.920 --> 1:43:51.920]  That's right.
[1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:52.920]  Okay.
[1:43:52.920 --> 1:43:53.920]  Yeah, okay.
[1:43:53.920 --> 1:43:59.760]  But the Federal Reserve quit reporting the M3 money supply, M3, that's right.
[1:43:59.760 --> 1:44:08.040]  Some of the private institutions are still generating the M3, but it's not done by the
[1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:09.040]  Fed.
[1:44:09.040 --> 1:44:11.920]  Well, I want to explain, and I know most of you know this, but your neighbors don't
[1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:12.920]  know this.
[1:44:12.920 --> 1:44:17.300]  I talk to people who've got degrees, and they just don't understand that it's like the
[1:44:17.300 --> 1:44:18.960]  peso or the ruble.
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:23.880]  Our elite have made the decision to devalue it, and that leaves you holding the bag while
[1:44:23.880 --> 1:44:26.360]  they hold all the real assets.
[1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:30.480]  And then you can see the parallel, how suddenly there's cops on every corner, suddenly there's
[1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:34.760]  helicopters flying overheads, cameras going in, and then you read the government documents,
[1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:39.320]  they say, yeah, we're going to implode everything you've got, and if you riot, or if you fight
[1:44:39.320 --> 1:44:42.120]  back against us, we're going to gun you down the streets.
[1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:49.760]  Well now, a lot of people are really playing down the oil companies, giving them a hell
[1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:52.840]  about increasing their price of oil.
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:55.360]  They're only making the same 8% profit they always do.
[1:44:55.360 --> 1:44:57.440]  They did not raise their prices.
[1:44:57.440 --> 1:44:58.440]  Dollar went down.
[1:44:58.440 --> 1:45:04.240]  The oil is dollar denominated, so when the value of the dollar goes down, the value of
[1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:11.680]  the oil goes up, and so gold, and oil, and silver, and a number of the commodities are
[1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:12.960]  dollar denominated.
[1:45:12.960 --> 1:45:16.000]  So they only go up because the dollar is going down.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:21.680]  And that's what the media is so craftily and deceptively all day attacks the oil companies
[1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:26.840]  when they're only middleman refining brokers between OPEC cartel, which as you know is
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:32.240]  predominantly Rothschild owned, the Arabs are just dumb and conspicuously consume with
[1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:38.680]  their private 747s and brothels in front of everybody, but you worked as a consultant
[1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:39.680]  for oil companies.
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:41.680]  Can you break that down for people?
[1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:51.760]  Yeah, as a matter of fact, this fellow named John J. McCloy, he was at the secret meeting
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:57.320]  at Clint Merchant's the night before Kennedy was killed, but he was named by the oil companies
[1:45:57.320 --> 1:46:02.720]  to be the first negotiator of the OPEC meetings.
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:13.320]  And so he got with the OPEC nations and they agreed on a price and the production rate.
[1:46:13.320 --> 1:46:20.400]  And but McCloy told him, he said, Now, we'll allow you say $10 a barrel, but every dollar
[1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:27.280]  over $10 a barrel, you must deposit in United States banks, particularly J. P. Morgan and
[1:46:27.280 --> 1:46:30.600]  those large banks.
[1:46:30.600 --> 1:46:38.520]  Because according to Islamic law, it's illegal to create usury or interest rates.
[1:46:38.520 --> 1:46:44.280]  So rather than make money off of interest to these Arab nations, they put their money
[1:46:44.280 --> 1:46:46.880]  in the banks in New York City.
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:47.880]  That's the insane thing.
[1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:54.080]  They said what a thousand years ago during the dark ages, the church Catholic Church said
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:46:58.920]  Christians can own banks, but Jews can, and that's what gave that original power to that
[1:46:58.920 --> 1:46:59.920]  group.
[1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:00.920]  That's right.
[1:47:00.920 --> 1:47:01.920]  It's just the same thing over and over again.
[1:47:01.920 --> 1:47:02.920]  That's right.
[1:47:02.920 --> 1:47:06.000]  But the so it's a legal ease.
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:09.960]  Oh, no, the Arabs don't have usury to the no, no, the Western banks are doing it for
[1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:10.960]  us.
[1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:11.960]  That's right.
[1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:19.320]  And but their money in the US banks and it's the old multiplier when when a bank has
[1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:26.880]  an asset like like cash, they can loan that out and create nine to one for every dollar
[1:47:26.880 --> 1:47:28.800]  they have and deposit.
[1:47:28.800 --> 1:47:34.480]  And so that it's the main benefit of having this air ball and these US banks as they turn
[1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:36.400]  around and multiply it by nine.
[1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:40.960]  Now, if there was a dictator ship in Alaska with some guy named King Crom, they would
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:44.240]  be getting all the oil out of there right now and wouldn't be using the Arabs.
[1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:47.720]  They use the Arabs because the British set those countries up 90 years ago, as you know,
[1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:51.960]  you lived over there and they made a deal for a monopoly with them.
[1:47:51.960 --> 1:47:56.120]  That's why they run around using the environmentalist as their fronts to keep the real oil from
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:47:57.120]  being tapped.
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:47:58.120]  That's right.
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:02.880]  They say you can't drill all of California or Florida, place like that for environmental
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:03.880]  reason.
[1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:07.320]  The only reason is to keep it off the market.
[1:48:07.320 --> 1:48:17.560]  And I've charted a lot of the characteristics of all supply and all reserves and the real
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:24.880]  facts are that in the very beginning, the oil coming out of an oil well will shoot up
[1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:30.320]  because of the pressure in the well and then it'll start turning down and will eventually
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:32.720]  head towards zero.
[1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:35.600]  That is a characteristic of an oil field.
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:41.240]  But and they're using that to say we have peak oil.
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:47.240]  But the other side of that coin is they have discovered massive supplies of oil all over
[1:48:47.240 --> 1:48:49.000]  the world that they're not putting on the market.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:52.880]  And they're fine in the 50 and 60 year old wells suddenly are full again.
[1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:55.320]  All over Texas, they're uncapping them and they're full again.
[1:48:55.320 --> 1:48:59.680]  Yeah, they're gradually just by seepage or filling up.
[1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:05.440]  And so all companies lie about it.
[1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:10.720]  For the P&L statement, they overstate their reserves.
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:18.360]  And back in 2005, the Federal Reserve, I mean, the Securities and Exchange Commission
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:23.560]  required Shell Oil companies to redo their reserves.
[1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:29.240]  And they did it five times in a 12 month period and every time they reduced their reserve,
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:30.240]  stated reserves.
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:33.600]  Well, we know that's the same with banking because they're able to get loans, invest
[1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:35.600]  and leverage those proven reserves.
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:36.600]  That's right.
[1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:37.600]  Yeah.
[1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:38.600]  So it's like money in the bank.
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:41.120]  There's so many subjects here, I want to go ahead and go to some phone calls after the
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:45.080]  break and then we'll just keep you for the whole next hour if you can do that, Robert.
[1:49:45.080 --> 1:49:46.080]  Okay.
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:49.200]  We might touch on derivatives and then we'll get on another side.
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:50.200]  Sure, fantastic.
[1:49:50.200 --> 1:49:54.240]  And I want to talk about the mindset, what makes the new owner tick, why they believe
[1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:55.240]  what they believe.
[1:49:55.240 --> 1:50:01.640]  And we have elite serial killers of RFK, JFK, MLK, that book available at infowars.com and
[1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:05.160]  a couple of the other great books that Robert Gail and Ross has written all available at
[1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:06.160]  infowars.com.

[1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:14.160]  All right.
[1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:22.080]  We're going to break and I promise we're going to go straight to George, Scott, Dave,
[1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:26.640]  Mary and Fred on the other side of this quick break.
[1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:29.960]  We'll take your calls into the bottom of the next hour.
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:33.880]  If the last 30 minutes will shift gears, Robert Gail and Ross will do a whole host
[1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:36.320]  of other stuff is whatever he thinks most important.
[1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:38.760]  You know, I get these guests in here and I say, hey, what do you want to talk about?
[1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:39.960]  He said, hey, I want to talk about the economy.
[1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:42.000]  And I was like, absolutely, that's important.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.080]  So who knows what he'll want to talk about next.
[1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:50.360]  We will experience that with each other coming up on the other side, infowars.com is the
[1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:51.360]  website.

[1:54:32.280 --> 1:54:41.720]  One love, we get to share it, it leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it.
[1:54:41.720 --> 1:54:49.640]  All right, your call is coming up, but Robert wanted to add something about derivatives on
[1:54:49.640 --> 1:54:52.240]  the financial end and then stretch your calls.
[1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:53.240]  Go ahead, sir.
[1:54:53.240 --> 1:55:00.960]  I mentioned in the beginning that the fellow named Neeson that bankrupted the bearings back
[1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:03.960]  back in 1995 dealing in derivatives.
[1:55:03.960 --> 1:55:05.840]  So let's just touch on that a little bit.
[1:55:05.840 --> 1:55:06.840]  What is a derivative?
[1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:16.080]  A derivative is something by definition as the value is based on some underlying asset
[1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:20.760]  like a corporate bond or a treasury bond or something like that.
[1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:23.840]  But it turns out to be a wager.
[1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:26.040]  They can wager on anything.
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:28.880]  They can wager on the global warming.
[1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:33.200]  They can wager on the tide levels.
[1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:40.040]  They generally wager on things like the dollar index or something like that.
[1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:46.600]  But let's just look at the involvement of the major banks in derivatives.
[1:55:46.600 --> 1:55:52.680]  JPMorgan Chase has total assets of $1.2 trillion.
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:58.120]  They own $91.7 trillion in derivatives.
[1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:06.680]  Today bank has total assets of $1.23 trillion, but their derivative exposure is $34 trillion.
[1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:14.760]  Bank of America has assets of $1.3 trillion, and their derivative exposure is $32.1 trillion.
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:24.320]  What Covia Bank has assets of $1.5 trillion, and their exposure is a little over $5 trillion.
[1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:34.640]  HSBC Bank has assets of about $0.2 trillion, exposure of $4.4 trillion.
[1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:39.880]  If things go wrong, I've just said it.
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:45.320]  For example, JPMorgan Chase has assets of $1.2 trillion, and they have an exposure of
[1:56:45.320 --> 1:56:47.560]  about $92 trillion.
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:49.880]  They can't pay that off.
[1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:55.240]  So what they're going to do, of course, the Federal Reserve has said that they will not
[1:56:55.240 --> 1:57:00.440]  let any bank fail, so the Federal Reserve will step in and save them, but they don't
[1:57:00.440 --> 1:57:03.320]  have enough assets to cover their liability.
[1:57:03.320 --> 1:57:10.920]  Now, to be clear, the big central banks and the private brokerage houses, they have already
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:20.160]  put their real assets into commodities, into infrastructure, into institutions.
[1:57:20.160 --> 1:57:26.080]  Now they're just going to have the public back up those institutions, their front institutions,
[1:57:26.080 --> 1:57:31.840]  and then basically drive the dollar value into the ground and then leave us holding
[1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:36.200]  the bag claiming this is some communal debt when it was created out of fraud.
[1:57:36.200 --> 1:57:37.400]  So they get us coming and going.
[1:57:37.400 --> 1:57:41.760]  It's kind of like they ship the drugs in and then put us in jail if they catch us using
[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:42.760]  them.
[1:57:42.760 --> 1:57:43.760]  They always have that formula.
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:52.520]  There's a fellow named Jim Rogers that is a big financial guru, and I saw a video of
[1:57:52.520 --> 1:57:58.280]  him on YouTube recently, and he says he's completely out of the dollar.
[1:57:58.280 --> 1:58:03.440]  In fact, I think he lives in Hong Kong, but his position is that we need to get rid of
[1:58:03.440 --> 1:58:05.760]  the Federal Reserve system and fire Bananke.
[1:58:05.760 --> 1:58:11.240]  Yeah, he said that from Singapore on Bloomberg, but I think it already lives in Hong Kong,
[1:58:11.240 --> 1:58:14.640]  but I remember that newscast we played, some of that audio here.
[1:58:14.640 --> 1:58:18.960]  We're going to come back and go directly to George Scott, Dave, Mary, Fred.
[1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:23.160]  We've got the third hour straight ahead, and then we've got a lot of news coming up, and
[1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:25.880]  a special guest joining us from England about the Bilderberg group.
[1:58:25.880 --> 1:58:26.880]  Did they already meet?
[1:58:26.880 --> 1:58:27.880]  Or is this disinfo?
[1:58:27.880 --> 1:58:41.360]  Thank you for listening to GCN, be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:45.600]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:58:45.600 --> 1:58:50.160]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:52.560]  It's known as the Bilderberg group.
[1:58:52.560 --> 1:58:59.320]  But their objective being world domination, for thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:58:59.320 --> 1:59:04.320]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating
[1:59:04.320 --> 1:59:09.680]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:09.680 --> 1:59:15.120]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:18.960]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:59:18.960 --> 1:59:26.760]  The Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[1:59:26.760 --> 1:59:27.760]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money.
[1:59:27.760 --> 1:59:28.760]  They have all the money they need.
[1:59:28.760 --> 1:59:29.760]  They're after power.
[1:59:29.760 --> 1:59:30.760]  That's their after-easy.

[1:59:35.440 --> 1:59:36.440]  You have been warned.
[1:59:36.440 --> 1:59:47.440]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:59:47.440 --> 1:59:56.920]  Government cover-ups.
[1:59:56.920 --> 1:59:57.920]  You want answers?
[1:59:57.920 --> 1:59:59.920]  Well, so does he.
[1:59:59.920 --> 2:00:04.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:00:04.240 --> 2:00:09.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:09.440 --> 2:00:13.360]  We're now into the third hour.
[2:00:13.360 --> 2:00:17.400]  I want to get into the power structure of the New World Order from Robert Galen Ross's research
[2:00:17.400 --> 2:00:19.520]  briefly later in the hour.
[2:00:19.520 --> 2:00:25.920]  Also want to get his take on what a depression will look like versus just a serious inflation
[2:00:25.920 --> 2:00:26.920]  area recession.
[2:00:26.920 --> 2:00:28.600]  How long do you think that will go?
[2:00:28.600 --> 2:00:35.720]  Again, he worked in international relations with oil companies, studying these type things.
[2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:39.000]  And also, he worked in association with the National Security Agency.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:40.640]  But right now, we're taking your calls.
[2:00:40.640 --> 2:00:41.640]  Thanks for holding.
[2:00:41.640 --> 2:00:46.280]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in, actually, John Innoi.
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:47.280]  We already went to him.
[2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:49.040]  George and Indiana, you're on the air.
[2:00:49.040 --> 2:00:50.040]  Thanks for holding, George.
[2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:51.040]  Yeah, Alex.
[2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:52.960]  Can I go off topic?
[2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:55.480]  I'm sure that Robert Galen Ross can talk about any subject.
[2:00:55.480 --> 2:00:56.480]  Go ahead.
[2:00:56.480 --> 2:00:57.480]  Okay, there's three things I want to mention.
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:00.880]  I did the math on the square footage of Florida.
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:05.160]  And do you realize we could put 7 billion people in Florida and each would have 20 square
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:06.160]  feet?
[2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:07.720]  We're not overcrowded in this world.
[2:01:07.720 --> 2:01:11.960]  The second thing I want to mention, I want to ask you, Alex, is the Fourth Amendment
[2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:14.160]  still valid?
[2:01:14.160 --> 2:01:21.400]  The Fourth Amendment has been abolished under HR 3162.
[2:01:21.400 --> 2:01:24.600]  The criminals have to still act like it's there.
[2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:29.440]  And still some people in government who aren't criminals but live in delusional la-la land
[2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:32.240]  think that it's still in force.
[2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:38.720]  It's, you know, the Fourth Amendment, as you know, only points out an innate organic
[2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:40.560]  or what many call God-given right.
[2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:44.680]  I mean, I don't care what the government says, you know, the president can't barbecue babies
[2:01:44.680 --> 2:01:46.160]  on the White House lawn.
[2:01:46.160 --> 2:01:48.480]  That is inhumane, inhuman criminal.
[2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:52.280]  It doesn't matter if he says he's supreme dictator and allowed to order the torture of
[2:01:52.280 --> 2:01:53.280]  children.
[2:01:53.280 --> 2:01:54.600]  You need to be serious.
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:02:00.760]  And so, but yeah, by and large, the government ignores the Fourth Amendment and says it doesn't
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:01.760]  exist.
[2:02:01.760 --> 2:02:06.040]  I'm going to comment on everything I wanted to say is on CNN today, I actually seen that
[2:02:06.040 --> 2:02:13.280]  a man got put in jail for six months because his 18-year-old daughter failed her GED.
[2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:14.280]  Oh, yeah.
[2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:15.280]  Mm-hmm.
[2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:18.080]  Yeah, this started about 10 years ago in Houston.
[2:02:18.080 --> 2:02:20.520]  It's all over the country.
[2:02:20.520 --> 2:02:23.320]  You have to stay in school here and I'm going to let it drop out.
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:27.160]  And now the parents are given prison time if they don't.
[2:02:27.160 --> 2:02:30.720]  Just look, if you drop a banana peel, six months in jail.
[2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:33.960]  Give you a battery in your backyard, five years.
[2:02:33.960 --> 2:02:35.680]  This is the new system.
[2:02:35.680 --> 2:02:38.280]  Robert Gail and Ross, it's always been that way in tyranny.
[2:02:38.280 --> 2:02:41.120]  They always make laws for the common people, don't they?
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:42.120]  That's right.
[2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:43.920]  I don't want to apply to them at all.
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:48.120]  Yeah, so for us, there's hyper laws, but for them, there's no laws.
[2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:52.360]  Yeah, for example, probably the best example is bribery.
[2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:56.920]  If you go down and you give a judge some money, you can go to jail for bribery.
[2:02:56.920 --> 2:03:02.720]  But if politician, if somebody drops several hundred thousand dollars in his pocket, that's
[2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:03.720]  a campaign finance.
[2:03:03.720 --> 2:03:05.240]  Well, here's an example.
[2:03:05.240 --> 2:03:10.160]  They can even break those laws that are tailored for them and it's all selectively enforced.
[2:03:10.160 --> 2:03:14.120]  Hillary and McCain both went to England in the last six months.
[2:03:14.120 --> 2:03:17.280]  They both raised hundreds of thousands of dollars at Lord Rothschild's house.
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:21.800]  You think I'm joking, folks, just type McCain Rothschild into Google at times of London.
[2:03:21.800 --> 2:03:23.240]  They gave him hundreds of thousands.
[2:03:23.240 --> 2:03:28.080]  Feds said that $1 a felony for a foreigner in a foreign and McCain just said, I don't
[2:03:28.080 --> 2:03:29.080]  care.
[2:03:29.080 --> 2:03:30.080]  And the Fed said, that's right.
[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:31.080]  We're going to let him do it.
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:32.080]  That's right.
[2:03:32.080 --> 2:03:34.080]  I mean, we've entered a new era here.
[2:03:34.080 --> 2:03:41.400]  Yeah, and we're not going to get all this back until we get rid of the two-party system.
[2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:46.600]  We've got to have independent people in every elected position that are there to look out
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:48.400]  after the people they represent.
[2:03:48.400 --> 2:03:52.440]  I remember debating a guy like 10 years ago on a talk show in Florida speaking of the
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:58.120]  devil, and he was saying that Rothschild's don't exist, that that's a made-up code race
[2:03:58.120 --> 2:03:59.120]  word.
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:01.280]  I mean, that's what they, I'm not kidding.
[2:04:01.280 --> 2:04:05.640]  It's just, we know the world, we study documents all day, we spend our time knowing what's
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:08.440]  going on, and then they just say, doesn't exist.
[2:04:08.440 --> 2:04:14.400]  If you go to my book, the elite don't dare let us tell people, I list all of the Rothschilds
[2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:19.440]  that are over the age of 50 and what they own and their position.
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:21.440]  And it's all right there for us.
[2:04:21.440 --> 2:04:27.280]  Okay, well, I appreciate your call, George Goodpoint, Scott, Dave, Mary, Fred, we'll go
[2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:31.360]  straight back to you in just three minutes, and there's so much I want to talk about with
[2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:35.040]  Robert Gaylen-Ross today that we're going to do some behind-the-scenes talk for Prison

[2:04:41.960 --> 2:04:47.760]  to listen if you want to hear that behind-the-scenes stuff.
[2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:49.720]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[2:04:49.720 --> 2:04:54.240]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest
[2:04:54.240 --> 2:04:55.760]  hour there is hope.
[2:04:55.760 --> 2:04:58.560]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:04:58.560 --> 2:05:03.040]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[2:05:03.040 --> 2:05:04.560]  World Order master plan.
[2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:08.800]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:05:08.800 --> 2:05:14.160]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:53.440]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship.
[2:05:53.440 --> 2:05:56.760]  Martial law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[2:05:56.760 --> 2:05:58.720]  It's going to be incremental.
[2:05:58.720 --> 2:06:00.680]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[2:06:00.680 --> 2:06:03.960]  Any incidents, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[2:06:03.960 --> 2:06:05.240]  Anything could be the final push.

[2:06:17.600 --> 2:06:19.360]  them through social engineering.

[2:06:22.760 --> 2:06:25.960]  will occur for registered gun owners, and cities will be on lockdown.
[2:06:25.960 --> 2:06:28.800]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years, preparing for

[2:07:59.160 --> 2:08:03.240]  I want the listeners to know that I really appreciate you.
[2:08:03.240 --> 2:08:07.480]  When I was thinking about this last night, my wife got XM in her car and I was driving
[2:08:07.480 --> 2:08:11.520]  her car and I was listening to some George Strait song.
[2:08:11.520 --> 2:08:14.640]  They got a George Strait channel on there.
[2:08:14.640 --> 2:08:17.840]  I couldn't get out of the car last night once I got home at one in the morning after
[2:08:17.840 --> 2:08:18.840]  working.
[2:08:18.840 --> 2:08:19.840]  All right, now I'm really digressing.
[2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:23.000]  I was listening to these George Strait top 56 hits.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:26.680]  He's now got more hits than anybody in any genre.
[2:08:26.680 --> 2:08:27.840]  That really doesn't matter, does it folks?
[2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:35.080]  The point is, I'm listening to George Strait, but he had this song about wanting to talk
[2:08:35.080 --> 2:08:39.000]  to people or tell people, I forget the name of it, after they died, what he wished he
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:42.160]  could have told them before, but that's what I want to tell the listeners.
[2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:46.880]  I appreciate you and I appreciate everything you do and I appreciate all the support and
[2:08:46.880 --> 2:08:52.960]  I'm sorry that I blow up on air and freak out and sometimes they're rude or whatever,
[2:08:52.960 --> 2:08:57.560]  but I really care and I'm really freaked out because I'm not some shrinking violent.
[2:08:57.560 --> 2:09:00.600]  I'm not even some goody two shoes in my life.
[2:09:00.600 --> 2:09:04.320]  Maybe it's because growing up I saw some, you know, kind of the other side of things
[2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:10.640]  just happened to run into that, that I had been a little bit harder in my life in just
[2:09:10.640 --> 2:09:11.640]  a few respects.
[2:09:11.640 --> 2:09:18.360]  I'm not saying I'm a tough guy, but to me, it's just so shocking to see the public dumb
[2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:25.880]  down, mindless, in denial, giggling, smirking, laughing, having no idea it's so criminal and
[2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:33.280]  the things are so bad and to see the police so trained against the people and I don't
[2:09:33.280 --> 2:09:34.280]  hate them.
[2:09:34.280 --> 2:09:37.000]  I know they're being used and manipulated and controlled and brainwashed and there's
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:39.440]  whole handbooks on it and I want to reach out to them.
[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:41.400]  I want their families to have good futures.
[2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:46.600]  I want them to do well and then I study the New World Order and it's just how evil they
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:51.280]  are boggles the mind, but when you know about serial killers and the mindset of control
[2:09:51.280 --> 2:09:54.880]  freaks, it really makes sense and when you know history, it really makes sense.
[2:09:54.880 --> 2:10:00.000]  We're about to go back to your calls, but Robert Gaylen Ross, I mean, do you ever marvel
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:05.880]  at just the horrible, diabolical things they do and do you ever feel panic that you want
[2:10:05.880 --> 2:10:06.880]  to warn people?
[2:10:06.880 --> 2:10:10.120]  I mean, I sometimes want to start yelling in the middle of a grocery store, but I know
[2:10:10.120 --> 2:10:14.560]  that people have been preconditioned that, you know, you're crazy if you do that.
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:18.400]  We don't have the town criers anymore, people on a soap box.
[2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:20.520]  If you try to do that in England now, they arrest you.
[2:10:20.520 --> 2:10:23.800]  I mean, it's, I mean, I'm really kind of babbling here.
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:26.520]  I'm just putting out my thoughts that I don't claim to be the best at this.
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:28.440]  I don't claim to be the grand poo ball.
[2:10:28.440 --> 2:10:30.360]  I don't claim to have all the answers.
[2:10:30.360 --> 2:10:32.880]  All I know is this New World Order is coming down on us.
[2:10:32.880 --> 2:10:34.880]  I'm trying to tell the truth the best I can.
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:38.960]  I'm trying to get people rally to fight against it and I see our own movement fighting with
[2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:39.960]  each other.
[2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:40.960]  That makes me very sad.
[2:10:40.960 --> 2:10:44.360]  I know that's inevitable, but I mean, do you get the point I'm making?
[2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:47.520]  Yeah, Alex, I'm like you.
[2:10:47.520 --> 2:10:52.280]  I'm absolutely convinced you have dedicated rest of your life to try and expose all this
[2:10:52.280 --> 2:10:54.880]  and that's exactly the way I am.
[2:10:54.880 --> 2:11:00.680]  If we don't do this, our children, our grandchildren, their quality of life is going to be terrible.
[2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:03.880]  And it's really our responsibility to do that.
[2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:07.440]  You can't divorce yourself from your kids like that.
[2:11:07.440 --> 2:11:09.720]  You've got to protect them.
[2:11:09.720 --> 2:11:12.160]  And the only way we can do that is try to get the truth out.
[2:11:12.160 --> 2:11:13.160]  Well, that's what it comes down to.
[2:11:13.160 --> 2:11:17.480]  I look at my children and I, I, I image these grandchildren that I know will be here next
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:18.480]  week.
[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:20.640]  You know, that's how time flies or talking about that during the break.
[2:11:20.640 --> 2:11:24.240]  Your son's 40 something years old now, and you remember holding him as a baby.
[2:11:24.240 --> 2:11:27.520]  I mean, talk about how time flies because it really does.
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:34.320]  Yeah, I, my son is adopted and they brought him to us when he was five days old and brought
[2:11:34.320 --> 2:11:40.800]  him in this little blanket and I looked in his eyes and of course that, that killed me
[2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:41.800]  right off.
[2:11:41.800 --> 2:11:49.800]  I mean, that, that was instant bonding, but now he's over 46 years old and I'm going to
[2:11:49.800 --> 2:11:57.040]  go see him in a couple of weeks, but I've missed so much time with him.
[2:11:57.040 --> 2:12:00.680]  Also I missed time with my own father and my own mother.
[2:12:00.680 --> 2:12:05.600]  When I was making my way through industry, I ignored them.
[2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:08.400]  I didn't go to visit them like I should.
[2:12:08.400 --> 2:12:13.320]  And I look back and these were some of the finest people I've ever known in my life and
[2:12:13.320 --> 2:12:16.000]  I ignore them and don't do that.
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:19.920]  That's very important that the people you love given the time.
[2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:24.160]  Well, that's why I get mad because I want to do fishing every week with my son.
[2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:27.520]  I want to, you know, teach him to be better at sports.
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:33.360]  I'm believing I like doing all that and I'm so obsessed with this that I spend a few hours
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:37.720]  a day with my children, but that's not enough that I work most weekends and I, and I'm not
[2:12:37.720 --> 2:12:38.720]  whining about this.
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:40.080]  I mean, I'm talking about the process.
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:43.960]  That's another reason I hate the new world order so much is that I have to totally fight
[2:12:43.960 --> 2:12:47.640]  them all the time and I know they're so evil and I just, if more good people would get
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:52.360]  involved and fight evil, we wouldn't be in such dire straits and I have to admit I get
[2:12:52.360 --> 2:12:55.920]  mad at the general public who are in denial, you know, who tell me there's no such thing
[2:12:55.920 --> 2:12:58.520]  as Rothschild's or no such thing as new world order.
[2:12:58.520 --> 2:13:01.360]  I mean, I get that all the time and I really want to slap them.
[2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:07.280]  I mean, these are hardcore killers coming for them and they are living in denial and
[2:13:07.280 --> 2:13:08.280]  I'm sick of it.
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:09.280]  Yeah.
[2:13:09.280 --> 2:13:14.680]  These, the people behind all of this, the ones behind the curtain are hardened criminals.
[2:13:14.680 --> 2:13:17.080]  They don't care about anybody.
[2:13:17.080 --> 2:13:18.080]  They're greedy.
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:22.720]  They're power hungry and they don't care how many people are killed in wars.
[2:13:22.720 --> 2:13:23.720]  They create wars.
[2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:30.200]  They finance both sides of wars all for their own benefit and like you, I, I really get
[2:13:30.200 --> 2:13:35.600]  pissed off and, uh, but I've got to be careful that I don't lose my, my objective.
[2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:43.080]  Uh, I don't want to lose my, uh, tunnel vision of exposing all of this and I'm going to spend
[2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:48.640]  all my time, all the spare time I can exposing these evil people.
[2:13:48.640 --> 2:13:49.640]  Let's go back to the calls.
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:52.880]  Let's talk to Scott and Colorado here on the air.
[2:13:52.880 --> 2:13:53.880]  Scott.
[2:13:53.880 --> 2:13:54.880]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[2:13:54.880 --> 2:13:55.880]  Yes, sir.
[2:13:55.880 --> 2:13:56.880]  Hey, I'm just like you.
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:01.360]  I get very passionate about what the mess is I'm trying to convey and a lot of times
[2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:04.400]  it makes it a little harder because they kind of, they kind of push away from me.
[2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:07.840]  But anyway, just out of a couple of points, I don't want to take much from Mr. Ross today.
[2:14:07.840 --> 2:14:12.880]  I'll keep one of the, one of the issues I wanted to discuss with you until another time.
[2:14:12.880 --> 2:14:18.480]  Um, you were talking earlier though about, um, uh, genetic engineering and one of the
[2:14:18.480 --> 2:14:22.880]  things that they're doing right now and I think I may have even read this in one of
[2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:27.880]  your articles somewhere, but I have had, I've actually, uh, worked with this called apoptosis.
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:30.040]  Are you familiar with that term?
[2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:31.040]  Yes.
[2:14:31.040 --> 2:14:32.040]  That worked.
[2:14:32.040 --> 2:14:33.040]  Okay.
[2:14:33.040 --> 2:14:37.040]  And what they can do is go in and target certain cells of the human body and program
[2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:39.600]  them to live a shorter period of time.
[2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:45.600]  They can program in a shorter period of time for specific organs that are necessary, uh,
[2:14:45.600 --> 2:14:48.080]  to, to not last as long.
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:53.200]  And, uh, I, I think that, uh, that may be something that, that they are, uh, working
[2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:54.200]  on currently.
[2:14:54.200 --> 2:14:57.120]  I actually have a little involvement with, with some studies.
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:03.000]  Uh, oh, now we've had live extension experts on and, uh, certainly all the good things
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:08.720]  that industry and science discovers with well-meaning researchers doing it is compartmentalized.
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:14.240]  That has been sent back, uh, to the big boys who already have very serious life extension
[2:15:14.240 --> 2:15:16.080]  technologies that they've been suppressing.
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:18.840]  Uh, Robert Gail and Ross, your take on that.
[2:15:18.840 --> 2:15:19.840]  Yeah.
[2:15:19.840 --> 2:15:25.920]  They, uh, their afters from every direction, uh, for example, uh, one of their goals is
[2:15:25.920 --> 2:15:27.440]  to depopulate the world.
[2:15:27.440 --> 2:15:32.240]  Uh, they say there's too many eaters, uh, some like 6 billion people in the world.
[2:15:32.240 --> 2:15:34.920]  They say it ought to be 2 billion or less.
[2:15:34.920 --> 2:15:40.360]  And so they're literally trying to depopulate Africa for one major example.
[2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:43.640]  And I want people listening to know when I get up on air and just throw out the warning,
[2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:48.480]  hey fluoride eats holes in your brains, attacks every organ, or when I say every major vaccine's
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:52.960]  been found to be filled with different cancer viruses and, uh, different, uh, artificially
[2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:57.360]  created, uh, data packets, whatever you want to call them, artificial viruses that are
[2:15:57.360 --> 2:16:02.320]  programming you at certain hormonal fluctuations in certain ages that will kill you, that I've
[2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:09.040]  had scientists, doctors, medical people on government documents, um, uh, you know, EPA
[2:16:09.040 --> 2:16:11.160]  toxicologist, this is going on.
[2:16:11.160 --> 2:16:12.160]  You want to speak to that?
[2:16:12.160 --> 2:16:13.160]  Yeah.
[2:16:13.160 --> 2:16:19.520]  And they have a, what they call, uh, nanobots, uh, this, this is actually, uh, uh, physical
[2:16:19.520 --> 2:16:25.600]  beings that, uh, they can, they're small enough that they can inject it into your blood system.
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:30.760]  And sometime in the future, they can turn those nanobots on and are they there for good
[2:16:30.760 --> 2:16:33.320]  or are they there for bad?
[2:16:33.320 --> 2:16:36.200]  So well, they're talking about people don't trust the government anymore.
[2:16:36.200 --> 2:16:37.600]  They're not taking vaccines.
[2:16:37.600 --> 2:16:39.360]  We'll just engineer it into the potatoes.
[2:16:39.360 --> 2:16:43.840]  I mean, see, it's, it's just, it's this forced medication.
[2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:44.840]  Anything else, Scott?
[2:16:44.840 --> 2:16:46.360]  More real quick.
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:51.760]  Uh, I want to go ahead and, and I guess I'm not really ashamed, uh, loosely plugged,
[2:16:51.760 --> 2:16:56.440]  but we had talked about before, I made that video at the Colorado Springs, a fire drill
[2:16:56.440 --> 2:17:01.080]  and since we're talking about, um, martial law and what's going on, we have 30,000 troops
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:05.920]  moving into Colorado Springs to for Carson right now, not to, it really concerns me,
[2:17:05.920 --> 2:17:08.080]  but I just want to, um, anyway, bring that up again.
[2:17:08.080 --> 2:17:12.760]  So more people can take a look at what they're doing behind the scenes and how Posse Comitatus
[2:17:12.760 --> 2:17:15.240]  has been repealed and how they all are working together.
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:20.400]  And it's under Colorado Springs fire drill and you put in Posse Comitatus, um, in your
[2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:21.400]  group.
[2:17:21.400 --> 2:17:22.400]  Thank you for making that video.
[2:17:22.400 --> 2:17:26.560]  Thank you so much, uh, for that call, um, but, but I just want to be careful of people
[2:17:26.560 --> 2:17:28.720]  thinking there's going to be an overnight martial law.
[2:17:28.720 --> 2:17:29.720]  It's incremental.
[2:17:29.720 --> 2:17:33.760]  I mean, getting randomly pulled over by the cops is martial law, uh, random checkpoints
[2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:38.280]  is martial law, uh, curfews, uh, is martial law, which they're now putting in for adults
[2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:39.280]  in many cities.
[2:17:39.280 --> 2:17:43.520]  Uh, all of this, uh, cops telling you that there's a free speech zones, uh, that's
[2:17:43.520 --> 2:17:45.200]  martial law.
[2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:46.760]  It's what increment of martial law.
[2:17:46.760 --> 2:17:51.040]  So everybody's looking for this big overnight thing, uh, listen, going from 300,000 cops
[2:17:51.040 --> 2:17:55.720]  to 2 million cops and having 10% of the college grads being Homeland Security related.
[2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:57.080]  That's martial law right there.
[2:17:57.080 --> 2:17:59.440]  Getting rid of Posse Comitatus is martial law.
[2:17:59.440 --> 2:18:01.160]  They just put the gun to your head.
[2:18:01.160 --> 2:18:02.480]  They've taken the safety off.
[2:18:02.480 --> 2:18:04.000]  Are they going to pull the trigger?
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:05.960]  That's a 10 on a Richter scale.
[2:18:05.960 --> 2:18:06.960]  Robert comments on that.
[2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:07.960]  All right.
[2:18:07.960 --> 2:18:12.240]  So it goes back to the old frog in the pan as they gradually turn the heat up, the frog
[2:18:12.240 --> 2:18:14.920]  just sits there because it's getting, it's really nice.
[2:18:14.920 --> 2:18:15.920]  It's warm.
[2:18:15.920 --> 2:18:17.720]  And before you know it, he's cooked.
[2:18:17.720 --> 2:18:21.200]  And if you throw him in a pot of boiling water, he'll jump out.
[2:18:21.200 --> 2:18:22.200]  Yep.
[2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:23.200]  That's it.
[2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:24.200]  Let's go to David Wisconsin.
[2:18:24.200 --> 2:18:25.200]  David on the air.
[2:18:25.200 --> 2:18:26.200]  Hello.
[2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:33.040]  I just wanted to say that, uh, the son of God is recorded as saying for the love of money
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:35.080]  is the root of all evil.
[2:18:35.080 --> 2:18:40.600]  And I tried to think that through a little bit and really anything to do with money management,
[2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:46.120]  whether it's in a personal life or a meeting with bankers has to do with the occult.
[2:18:46.120 --> 2:18:52.440]  And I just finished a book by, uh, let's see, uh, Elizabeth Star Miller or Lady Queensborough
[2:18:52.440 --> 2:18:55.400]  by her other name called occult theocracy.
[2:18:55.400 --> 2:19:02.880]  And it says in there on page 581, for the purposes of occult dominion, minds must therefore
[2:19:02.880 --> 2:19:08.040]  be rendered passive and negative in order that control can be achieved.
[2:19:08.040 --> 2:19:13.200]  Minds consciously working to a definite end for good are a power.
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:19.240]  The scheme for world dominion might be doomed by the recognition of this principle alone.
[2:19:19.240 --> 2:19:20.440]  I just want to make that point.
[2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:21.440]  And also,
[2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:22.440]  Well, stay there.
[2:19:22.440 --> 2:19:23.440]  I'm going to come back to you.
[2:19:23.440 --> 2:19:24.440]  I'm going to come to Dave.
[2:19:24.440 --> 2:19:25.440]  Stay there.

[2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:27.440]  We're going to let you.

[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:35.640]  side.

[2:19:48.200 --> 2:19:50.560]  It is a big idea.
[2:19:50.560 --> 2:19:54.360]  A new world order in the near future.
[2:19:54.360 --> 2:19:59.640]  Earth is dominated by a powerful government is known as the builder bird.
[2:19:59.640 --> 2:20:06.160]  But their objective being world domination or thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:20:06.160 --> 2:20:11.160]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[2:20:11.160 --> 2:20:18.280]  80% of humanity is at hand for the first time in history.
[2:20:18.280 --> 2:20:22.000]  The elites plan for world government is blown wide open.

[2:20:25.880 --> 2:20:28.520]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.

[2:20:30.320 --> 2:20:31.680]  They have all the money they need.
[2:20:31.680 --> 2:20:32.680]  They're after power.

[2:22:46.280 --> 2:22:53.240]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism but globalism.
[2:22:53.240 --> 2:22:56.760]  Democrats are concerned with what's good for big business and the American Empire instead
[2:22:56.760 --> 2:22:59.080]  of what's fair for the American people.
[2:22:59.080 --> 2:23:02.880]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:32.960]  up during the break for behind the scenes listeners. Uh, the occultism and occult isn't
[2:24:32.960 --> 2:24:37.760]  just a witch in a, in a black cauldron. That's kind of the archetypal image. It is the system
[2:24:37.760 --> 2:24:44.520]  of control of populations and it is alchemy. It is a fraud. It is a magic. Uh, magic's
[2:24:44.520 --> 2:24:49.160]  just tricking somebody, uh, to be able to have private banks that just create money
[2:24:49.160 --> 2:24:54.440]  out of nothing and own our governments, own our police. And we all bow down, uh, for the
[2:24:54.440 --> 2:25:03.560]  real things that can be bought with the fiat. Yep. Just amazing. And it's getting worse.
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:10.680]  Uh, and, uh, I, I advise you to do everything you can to prepare what's coming and probably
[2:25:10.680 --> 2:25:18.520]  the best thing you do is, uh, eliminate as much debt as you can. Uh, and if you have
[2:25:18.520 --> 2:25:25.160]  anything left over, invest in gold, but you, you need to look out for your family or your
[2:25:25.160 --> 2:25:31.840]  friends and, uh, it's really going to get bad. You know, this is a short segment. We'll
[2:25:31.840 --> 2:25:37.280]  come back and go to, uh, Mary, Fred, Lee, Rob, Ronnie and others, uh, in quick succession.
[2:25:37.280 --> 2:25:42.460]  But right now let's talk about what, uh, a, what do you think the chances are that we're
[2:25:42.460 --> 2:25:48.200]  going to have a depression versus just a hyperinflationary deep recession and B, when
[2:25:48.200 --> 2:25:56.320]  do you think that'll happen and see, uh, what will it look like if it does happen? Well,
[2:25:56.320 --> 2:26:03.000]  we're absolutely in a recession now. And if we don't pull out by, by the end of 2009,
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:08.240]  we're going into a deep depression. So what's, what's that very carefully look for the trends
[2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:13.840]  in 2009 and the trends are going towards depression. That's right. And it's all based
[2:26:13.840 --> 2:26:19.920]  on, uh, what the, the elite are doing to us and, and do, do that Google search on the
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:25.720]  MZM money supply. That's a very important thing to look at because it, it shows that
[2:26:25.720 --> 2:26:29.800]  they're printing money like it's going out of style and that's driving the cost up of
[2:26:29.800 --> 2:26:34.440]  everything that we buy.
[2:26:34.440 --> 2:26:38.560]  And they get to consolidate, understand they implode economies after they get you extended
[2:26:38.560 --> 2:26:42.800]  out like a loan shark and then they get all the real assets in a big bag. They put over
[2:26:42.800 --> 2:26:48.960]  their shoulder mass global carpet bagging. That's right. And, uh, they, they fleece the
[2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:57.040]  public, uh, ever so often and they allow you to gain some, uh, uh, assets and all of a
[2:26:57.040 --> 2:27:01.720]  sudden they'll come in and a jerky feet after Monday. That's, that's been going on for
[2:27:01.720 --> 2:27:02.720]  years.
[2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:07.120]  And then the very public that has been ripped off by them will then turn to the same experts
[2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:10.920]  to tell them how to get out of it on the news, which will be some new solution to get some
[2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:16.920]  deeper under their control. And Henry Kissinger said at the, uh, I believe it was 1992 Bilderberg
[2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:24.800]  meeting that, uh, we will essentially create, uh, a mass, uh, fear by the public and then
[2:27:24.800 --> 2:27:28.360]  they will welcome us as world leaders to come in and save them.
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:32.480]  Yeah. That's a quote from Evian France. And, and, and that was confirmed that he said that
[2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:36.760]  and they publicly, I mean, I keep plugging this, this quote because it's so amazing.
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:39.560]  Another guy called in with a Carol quickly quote from the sixties about how they'd create
[2:27:39.560 --> 2:27:44.320]  North American union and how they'd call it a confederation, how they'd call it an integration,
[2:27:44.320 --> 2:27:48.920]  how they'd merge it through roads. I mean, it's all there. Uh, but, uh, head of the
[2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:54.760]  CFR Haas says we're using fake terror to control you and make you the enemy. And he said the
[2:27:54.760 --> 2:28:00.200]  st, and we're going to use environmentalism and, uh, as a fad to make humans, the enemy
[2:28:00.200 --> 2:28:05.640]  to totally control your life and quote, make humans the enemy and we will wage the war
[2:28:05.640 --> 2:28:08.840]  against humans. I mean, this is about hurting you.
[2:28:08.840 --> 2:28:12.720]  And they just publicly say it in the public. Thanks. Oh, thank you for hurting me. Let
[2:28:12.720 --> 2:28:17.320]  me roll my sleeve up and take an injection. Oh, you're a Nazi. You Genesis told me have
[2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:24.600]  a shot. I trust you. Yeah, they, they, one of the recent fears is global warming. Uh,
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:30.800]  there are a lot of evidence that, uh, the so-called global warning warming has reversed for the
[2:28:30.800 --> 2:28:37.280]  last year or year and a half. It's getting cooler rather than warmer. And so, but, but
[2:28:37.280 --> 2:28:42.040]  they won't step up in it and, and, uh, verify that because they're trying to scare you with
[2:28:42.040 --> 2:28:45.760]  global warming. Well, they say we've got to keep climate stable. Climate's never been
[2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:49.400]  stable on this planet. That's right. And all the evidence, every climatologist, every
[2:28:49.400 --> 2:28:55.160]  biologist expert says that a warming planet is better for life and that this is the lowest
[2:28:55.160 --> 2:28:59.880]  in carbon dioxide and oxygen of the hundreds of thousands of ice core samples going to
[2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:03.600]  hundreds of thousands of years they've ever found. Uh, that's, and they've now found in
[2:29:03.600 --> 2:29:09.000]  studies that desert vacation and Sahara is happening because of low carbon dioxide. Plants
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:15.320]  needed folks. It's not a deadly bio weapon, chemical weapon. As the news has been saying,
[2:29:15.320 --> 2:29:21.320]  it's a lie folks. It's a huge hoax. I think with the elite, Robert, they love to joke.
[2:29:21.320 --> 2:29:25.240]  I mean, it must be a huge joke to them at the public's running in fear from imaginary
[2:29:25.240 --> 2:29:30.160]  terrorist and carbon dioxide. I'm sure they get together and laugh about it. How they're
[2:29:30.160 --> 2:29:35.560]  scaring us and looking to those people running, look at them hiding, crunching down. We'll
[2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:45.560]  be right back. We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[2:32:46.680 --> 2:32:56.120]  The preacher man says it's the end of time, and the Mississippi River, she's a gold grime.
[2:32:56.120 --> 2:33:07.360]  The interest is up, and the stock market's down, and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[2:33:07.360 --> 2:33:18.000]  That's another facet to an economy in floating, is the crime always skyrockets. People run out of food,
[2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:26.240]  they gotta go to crime and feed their families, feed themselves, and provide food and shelter,
[2:33:26.240 --> 2:33:31.240]  and it's just gonna get worse. And the government knows that, that's why they openly want to stop
[2:33:31.240 --> 2:33:35.800]  us defending ourselves, they just love it. They just love making us these little cowardly,
[2:33:35.800 --> 2:33:41.080]  domesticated. You got these kids drinking soft drinks full of all this, you know,
[2:33:41.080 --> 2:33:46.480]  different dyes and chemicals and sugar and caffeine. No real exercise watching TV,
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:51.440]  playing video games, totally depressed, but if they were out playing sports or out having to
[2:33:51.440 --> 2:33:56.720]  shovel out some horse stalls or out having to work, that actually makes you appreciate your
[2:33:56.720 --> 2:34:00.360]  life. They're totally unhappy because they're not being taught a trade, they're not being made to
[2:34:00.360 --> 2:34:05.280]  work. You got all these rich yuppies kids that are totally unhappy out running around like a bunch
[2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:09.240]  of heathens. And it's simple, folks, if you don't make your children work and make them clean up
[2:34:09.240 --> 2:34:14.360]  the house, and I'm talking to myself right now, it's work to make them work, because it's easier
[2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:18.320]  to just do the work yourself sometimes, you're gonna ruin them. And the reason I'm getting off
[2:34:18.320 --> 2:34:24.200]  another subject, there's a story here about doctors to remind kids to take their Ritalin via
[2:34:24.200 --> 2:34:29.040]  cell phone alerts, then soon you'll have to videotape yourself taking the pill to make sure
[2:34:29.040 --> 2:34:35.080]  you're taking it. Associated Press and somebody here on the infowars.com comment section under
[2:34:35.080 --> 2:34:40.600]  the story says, the parents are popping more pills than the kids. I have people in my family on
[2:34:40.600 --> 2:34:45.760]  14 different medications, and they can't figure out why they feel like crap all the time. You
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:52.960]  know what these kids need to get away from these fake city slickers, and to, you know, go do some
[2:34:52.960 --> 2:34:58.840]  farm work every morning and every evening before and after school for a year and see how hyperactive
[2:34:58.840 --> 2:35:02.760]  they are. Have a milk cow kick you in the shoulder and get chased by a thousand pound
[2:35:02.760 --> 2:35:10.440]  cow pig and see how against, how much angst and depression you have. These little bastards
[2:35:10.440 --> 2:35:15.600]  need to learn to appreciate hard work, because most of you are growing up to be little worker
[2:35:15.600 --> 2:35:21.760]  ants with no need for blackberries and cutesy cell phones. That's another thing, they admit
[2:35:21.760 --> 2:35:28.640]  that the cell phones used for 10 years, an hour a day, massively increased brain tumors, no doubt.
[2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:35.960]  And doesn't matter, I see little kids everywhere with them. I just, it's just there's no end Robert.
[2:35:35.960 --> 2:35:43.000]  Well and also the fast food that they're all consuming leads to obesity. Obesity
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:52.640]  lives to, leads to other problems that cause life threatening like diabetes. Diabetes,
[2:35:52.640 --> 2:35:57.080]  when it really gets to going in the wrong direction, it can cause you to lose your feet,
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:36:05.480]  your legs and so diabetes is directly a function of overweight and obesity.
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:14.040]  Well it's just skyrocketing. I mean we had one in 33 people in the 1940s and I have the federal
[2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:18.320]  numbers on this diet of cancer. People lived as long men and they smoked and drank even more.
[2:36:18.320 --> 2:36:23.880]  And there was toxic waste all over in the factories. Why now magically is it one in three?
[2:36:23.880 --> 2:36:33.280]  We used to chew on 22 bullets, the lead and we played with mercury. I've done so many things
[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:39.120]  like that when I was growing up and I'm still here but I'm sure it caused some problems for me.
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:44.600]  But what is it now that I mean all this is happening? Well I don't think I know the GMO food,
[2:36:44.600 --> 2:36:50.080]  it's a cocktail of things alone. It creates new amino acids, new things that are as toxic waste
[2:36:50.080 --> 2:36:57.360]  to the body and your body doesn't know what it is. They're creating new cellular structures,
[2:36:57.360 --> 2:37:02.560]  new compounds in food that have never existed. Yeah and does your immune system attack it
[2:37:02.560 --> 2:37:08.200]  because it thinks it's an enemy? We don't know. Well you're right, we actually do know that it's
[2:37:08.200 --> 2:37:13.560]  increasing allergies and that your body gets hyper aware and then it finally just succumbs,
[2:37:13.560 --> 2:37:18.040]  that's when you get cancer. It basically wears out your immune system then it just breaks and
[2:37:18.040 --> 2:37:22.680]  it's over. Yeah unbelievable. Let's take another call here. Mary in Illinois, you're on the air
[2:37:22.680 --> 2:37:30.280]  with Robert Galen Ross. Go ahead. Hi Alex. Hi Robert. What a pleasure and an honor. Thank you
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:36.960]  for taking my call. Actually I wanted to put some information out there. I had heard yesterday that
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:43.400]  a store named Cabalas, it reminds me of the word cabala, but actually it's Cabalas. It's a huge
[2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:50.560]  sporting goods store. They had signs out talking about a Homeland Security drill and I guess they
[2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:58.000]  were looking for people supposedly held at the Sears Center. I called up Cabalas to get some
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:03.160]  additional information and the woman there would seem real excited that they're having this big
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:08.080]  you know Homeland Security but didn't know too much about it so I called the Sears Center. Now
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:14.160]  this place is a huge place like where they would have sporting events. You're talking about in
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:19.320]  Chicago down by the water. Yeah this is actually in Hoffman Estates which is the center of Chicago.
[2:38:19.320 --> 2:38:25.840]  So she was very guarded, did not want to say too much about it. She said, I said, oh I'm playing
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:31.120]  kind of stupid. Oh can I get like tickets? Can I watch? And I guess it's being held inside. She's
[2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:39.320]  like oh no no we already have the participants and it's very heavily guarded. So yeah I actually
[2:38:39.320 --> 2:38:43.840]  did see something about that. Excuse me? I tell you what go ahead and make your point and then
[2:38:43.840 --> 2:38:48.720]  I'll make my point. Okay well it's only until two which is coming up and I was hoping I don't live
[2:38:48.720 --> 2:38:54.000]  close to there but if some you know maybe some Alex Jones listeners could get out there with some
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:58.480]  video cameras and interview some of the people coming out to see what actually was being done
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:03.720]  inside. I agree people should go and act friendly and say wow I'm just interested in this or I'm
[2:39:03.720 --> 2:39:10.320]  doing a college report on this. Why don't you tell me about what happened but if you'd like I can
[2:39:10.320 --> 2:39:17.320]  tell you what's going on in there. Be very interested. Well fantastic where are you in Illinois? I'm
[2:39:17.320 --> 2:39:24.240]  actually in Grace Lake. Okay now now let's be specific. Where did you hear about how Cabela's
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:29.960]  had signs out in previous days wanting the volunteers? A friend of mine who I met through
[2:39:29.960 --> 2:39:37.520]  Ron Paul meeting we were together on Super Tuesday watching their turns and he had called me and
[2:39:37.520 --> 2:39:42.480]  he's like yeah something really weird is going on. I'm seeing these signs. I guess they went up to
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:48.840]  Cabela's the store and they were seeing signs about you know there's going to be this drill. He
[2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:53.480]  wasn't real specific but some kind of drill was going on and he said it's supposed to be happening
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:57.600]  this week. Well then I thought about it this morning and I wanted to do a little bit more
[2:39:57.600 --> 2:40:02.680]  investigation and that's when I called the store and called the fear center to see if it was in
[2:40:02.680 --> 2:40:08.520]  fact happening. Okay I appreciate your call. Let me tell you what we know about this. When you
[2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:17.240]  look at a secret operation by itself it's hard to penetrate it okay but when you over time look
[2:40:17.240 --> 2:40:22.320]  at other similar operations and then look at what's been declassified and then you get the
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:27.720]  on-the-ground intelligence you can find out exactly what happened. Now from past operations like
[2:40:27.720 --> 2:40:35.120]  Top Off 1 and Top Off 2 that happened shortly after 9-11 from Operation Dark Winter that they had
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:45.400]  in early 2001 and these are all mainstream reports. You can find out exactly what's happening. Now
[2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:49.920]  take the Denver operation in Top Off 1. They've also had them in Seattle, Illinois,
[2:40:49.920 --> 2:40:57.400]  Chicago, everywhere. Seattle, Washington, Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas. They will hire like
[2:40:57.400 --> 2:41:02.880]  five six bucks an hour some cases thousands of role-players. They will blow up buses. They will
[2:41:02.880 --> 2:41:08.560]  burn cars. They will practice with riot police. They'll give the citizen signs saying don't take
[2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:13.600]  my land and then they practice rounding you up and putting you in the camp or they practice with
[2:41:13.600 --> 2:41:18.640]  people who wait at their homes and they've done this in Austin and the police drive around in
[2:41:18.640 --> 2:41:24.280]  city buses practicing going to the house and raiding the homes or knocking on the home putting
[2:41:24.280 --> 2:41:28.440]  on the list and taking you to the facility. It's a mass arrest. It's like in you hear about in
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:34.120]  Burma where you hear about in in in Pakistan or you hear about in Russia that's what this is for
[2:41:34.120 --> 2:41:37.840]  and they admit that's what it's for. It's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act. So what
[2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:41.920]  always happens with these stories is people here I heard they were doing drills for arresting
[2:41:41.920 --> 2:41:48.280]  everybody with Cabela's in Illinois. A week and about a week and two days ago it was first
[2:41:48.280 --> 2:41:52.080]  reported by the Des Moines Register and others that that they were taking over the cattle
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:58.240]  fairgrounds where they could process tens of thousands of people an hour and that and and we
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:02.400]  went on air and then Lee Rogers put out a report it's on info wars.com is from rogue government
[2:42:02.400 --> 2:42:07.960]  and said watch this is going to be an illegal alien roundup but they were saying it's part of a
[2:42:07.960 --> 2:42:14.480]  Homeland Security drill. Well the government documents Rex 84 now public said they would use
[2:42:14.480 --> 2:42:20.240]  arresting illegals in the first wave but only a few thousand here and there there's 30 million to
[2:42:20.240 --> 2:42:26.120]  make the public think it was for them but really it's for political dissidents. Okay they're very
[2:42:26.120 --> 2:42:33.600]  very slick and so none of this is hidden it's it's just that those who are involved in it are told
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:39.960]  to shut up. Now why are they really doing it? Why are they having drills with role players in
[2:42:39.960 --> 2:42:44.760]  Chicago and actually saw a blurb about that it's happening all over the country. They're having a
[2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:49.720]  drill throughout the month from the 1st to the 8th they have another overlapping from the 6th to
[2:42:49.720 --> 2:42:54.320]  the 14th and they have another one later in the month and there's all these drills the feds pipe
[2:42:54.320 --> 2:42:58.200]  bond themselves as part of the drill there's no doubt those always happen during the drills
[2:42:58.200 --> 2:43:02.320]  then later it's come out that it was part of drills but then that's also it's a huge sigh up
[2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:10.480]  and this is so they can test control of local police they can test command and control they
[2:43:10.480 --> 2:43:16.120]  can prepare the troops and police and feds that people screaming I'm an American oh no please not
[2:43:16.120 --> 2:43:23.920]  the camp that that's okay so this is to acclimate the media the population the police the military
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:29.840]  everybody Robert Gaylen Ross comments on what she was just saying it's you used right term
[2:43:29.840 --> 2:43:36.480]  sops it's a it's a smoke screen to cover up what they're doing and to point you in the direction
[2:43:36.480 --> 2:43:42.400]  they want you to go or to stop you from doing what you'd like to do and this is all very carefully
[2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:47.960]  controlled well you notice they decades ago we knew they built camps it had come out people say
[2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:52.200]  it was a conspiracy now in the news they admit yeah they built camps for the citizens and John
[2:43:52.200 --> 2:43:56.440]  Warner Defense Authorization Act says in case the American people engage in insurrection why would
[2:43:56.440 --> 2:44:00.520]  they need to fund tens of billions of dollars and say the presidents above the governors and
[2:44:00.520 --> 2:44:04.480]  the governors can't be trusted I mean they're planning some really bad stuff that they think
[2:44:04.480 --> 2:44:10.120]  governors are going to revolt what do you think that is Robert well there are some governors
[2:44:10.120 --> 2:44:15.120]  that are revolting and there's in the president says I'm gonna have more I mean again it could be
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:22.640]  a Brock Obama for all we know yeah some of the governors are saying we're fed up with the federal
[2:44:22.640 --> 2:44:28.720]  government not enforcing immigration so they're taking over and and that is a real threat to them
[2:44:28.720 --> 2:44:34.200]  and so and a lot of governors what is it like 14 of them now or something are saying no to the
[2:44:34.200 --> 2:44:39.160]  real ID act national ID card that's right that's part of it they're saying we don't have to lay
[2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:45.200]  down and take this anymore if we're gonna defend our constituents we need to really try to defend
[2:44:45.200 --> 2:44:49.560]  them and do something about it and some of them are doing that by the way for cops driving along
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:55.680]  your cars don't just believe me go to PDD 51 go to John Warner Defense Authorization Act don't
[2:44:55.680 --> 2:45:02.520]  be lazy PDD 51 write it down PDD presidential decision directive 51 there's an accompanying
[2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:09.400]  executive order but just PDD 51 and then also John Warner Defense Authorization Act I mean
[2:45:09.400 --> 2:45:12.640]  you know instead of just laughing and saying I'm making this up even though you're being trained
[2:45:12.640 --> 2:45:18.520]  for this but you have double thing go read it it says the state's no longer Congress has no
[2:45:18.520 --> 2:45:24.640]  authority it says the president is dictator in the first page that's also in PDD 51 and then
[2:45:24.640 --> 2:45:28.840]  Congress is told the highest level security clearance co-equal with the president they're
[2:45:28.840 --> 2:45:34.720]  told they can't see it how bad is it that even their lap dog Republican members of homeland
[2:45:34.720 --> 2:45:40.000]  security can't see it well there's another thing that they don't talk about very much and the
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:46.840]  power of the president has two very strong powers one of them is a signing statement and the other
[2:45:46.840 --> 2:45:54.200]  is the executive order and Congress can pass a law and when it reaches his desk he can sign it and
[2:45:54.200 --> 2:45:59.400]  then immediately have a signing statement says ignore this law we're not gonna do it and by the
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:05.320]  way that's totally illegal total fraud total tyranny the executive in the last decade has claimed
[2:46:05.320 --> 2:46:10.920]  that signing statement power and claimed it a new legislative power yeah in fact it even has
[2:46:10.920 --> 2:46:15.720]  signing statements Clinton started it Bush is now doing it all the time where he'll even announce
[2:46:15.720 --> 2:46:23.000]  a new paragraph and so it's just it's godlike it's that's not America folks go ahead and Congress
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:29.480]  does zero about it Congress has the power to stop this but they they just lay back and just let it
[2:46:29.480 --> 2:46:34.720]  happen well I want to admit something you can't help but become acclimated to this you know as it
[2:46:34.720 --> 2:46:40.120]  gets crazier and crazier as it gets weirder and weirder as they tase are you for no reason as
[2:46:40.120 --> 2:46:44.120]  they show you video of stopping on innocent now admitted they were innocent people's heads who
[2:46:44.120 --> 2:46:48.200]  didn't resist they said it was for their safety cops running up on guys they say her arm that's
[2:46:48.200 --> 2:46:54.120]  that's not that's even bad for the cops I get acclimated you know as corporations in the U.S.
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:46:59.240]  say their employees have to have chips under the skin I mean it's getting so crazy that
[2:46:59.240 --> 2:47:04.040]  feds accused student of terror and espionage for talking about constitution and I have the video
[2:47:04.040 --> 2:47:08.040]  and audio in their own documents where they teach the police this and this guy was teaching
[2:47:08.040 --> 2:47:13.080]  he worked for the administration he's a doctorate student there he's already a pastor and at the big
[2:47:13.080 --> 2:47:20.600]  bible school it's a it's a baptist bible school it's the one in Mount Vernon and the homeland
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:24.520]  security called him in and said you'll be arrested for espionage if you ever teach the constitution
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:31.640]  again and I mean I know I laugh too but but I've got FEMA on video telling police that I've got
[2:47:31.640 --> 2:47:36.760]  them pulling a woman over and arresting her for a pocket constitution in the same article I mean
[2:47:36.760 --> 2:47:43.240]  how do these police think it's terrorism to talk about the constitution yeah and uh but but their
[2:47:43.240 --> 2:47:48.200]  brain wants themselves that they're trying to earn a living and the only way they can earn a
[2:47:48.200 --> 2:47:53.320]  living is do what they're told to do and so and and it's sort of their nature to do this
[2:47:54.200 --> 2:48:02.040]  and uh they they said all right I'm just following orders but but they uh they're doing things that
[2:48:02.040 --> 2:48:07.960]  if they were not on a police force or not in the FBI they wouldn't put up with it well I mean I
[2:48:07.960 --> 2:48:13.640]  want to ask FBI agents something I've got you on video I mean I got FEMA on video this isn't just
[2:48:13.640 --> 2:48:19.880]  a person telling us this I mean how do you swear an oath to it but then if somebody has a pocket
[2:48:19.880 --> 2:48:25.000]  constitution you arrest them I mean what is their major problem that's that's what the red white and
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:31.720]  blue symbolize and you ought to you ought to have a conscience uh if something if you're told to do
[2:48:31.720 --> 2:48:38.120]  something that is basically against your normal way of doing things or your normal way of thinking
[2:48:38.840 --> 2:48:45.320]  you need to say well now do I really want to do that and you need to say uh can I uh can I not do
[2:48:45.320 --> 2:48:52.200]  that of course you'd love to get fired when you'd say that but uh you need to start using your own

[2:52:19.480 --> 2:52:24.440]  have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price

[2:54:39.640 --> 2:54:45.880]  there with Tony Gosling coming up but before we go back to Ronnie and James in the next segment
[2:54:45.880 --> 2:54:51.160]  Robert Galen Ross I wanted to get into the elite's power structure who they are and and if they
[2:54:51.160 --> 2:54:57.960]  have their way what this world will look like you've got the floor okay the the person at the very
[2:54:57.960 --> 2:55:09.800]  top of the of the organization behind the curtain is fellow named David D. Rothschild and David Rockfella
[2:55:09.800 --> 2:55:15.160]  is his agent here in the United States those two are behind all of this power structure
[2:55:16.040 --> 2:55:23.160]  and their goal is to create the new world order the global union and they'll probably change those
[2:55:23.160 --> 2:55:31.240]  terms they've they were trying to create the American Union and secret seizure chavez stopped
[2:55:31.240 --> 2:55:37.640]  them so now they're creating the North American Union and now they're even changing the term for
[2:55:37.640 --> 2:55:45.720]  North American Union to a less mundane term and it's something to do with standards and
[2:55:45.720 --> 2:55:51.000]  procedures or something like that but they're trying to the people have honed in on North
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:55.240]  American Union and so they're they're going to get their attention off of that well I mean they
[2:55:55.240 --> 2:56:02.200]  just said John McCain just said Gary Hart just said the CFR all said in unison the last two months
[2:56:02.200 --> 2:56:05.720]  we're not going to call it new world order anymore we're going to call it global freedom global
[2:56:05.720 --> 2:56:10.440]  democracy a league of global democracies but when you actually read what they're doing it's
[2:56:10.440 --> 2:56:15.640]  taking our right to vote in our liberty away but you're right there they're now trying to change
[2:56:15.640 --> 2:56:22.040]  terms because they're worried that's right and when the people really get focused in on something
[2:56:22.040 --> 2:56:26.920]  and there's a well I really need to check on that well then they step in and change the term so you
[2:56:26.920 --> 2:56:30.920]  can't check it well like dying core got caught running giant child kidnapping ranks I mean
[2:56:30.920 --> 2:56:39.480]  it was in the news and they just changed their name yeah so they're in power and but but they're
[2:56:39.480 --> 2:56:47.560]  only about three or four thousand of them and there's some like six billion of us and so we
[2:56:47.560 --> 2:56:56.840]  shouldn't put up with that we've got to start legally fighting this because if it gets down to
[2:56:56.840 --> 2:57:02.920]  the last ditch that we may have to do even more than just verbal and legal tactics well that's
[2:57:02.920 --> 2:57:08.440]  why they're militarizing the police and I again the police are literally destroying themselves I
[2:57:08.440 --> 2:57:11.480]  mean I do you want to talk to the cops out there that don't understand what's happening
[2:57:12.360 --> 2:57:16.200]  yeah I really hadn't talked to any of them about it uh I mean you're talking to them right now
[2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:22.280]  what do you want to say to them okay well uh use your own conscience and what you're doing if if
[2:57:22.280 --> 2:57:29.960]  what you're told to do if you think it's wrong think about it uh because you got to be concerned
[2:57:29.960 --> 2:57:35.080]  about your family your children and how what what they've told you to do is going to affect them
[2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:38.840]  and I think there's a good chance now the new order is going to lose and they need to think
[2:57:38.840 --> 2:57:45.320]  about being prosecuted later that's right in fact they they've uh tried to uh and maybe they've
[2:57:45.320 --> 2:57:53.160]  already done it uh right into laws uh the provisions to exempt them from uh prosecution later
[2:57:53.160 --> 2:58:00.280]  as war criminals and uh they're trying to make that retroactive to 1995 or something like that
[2:58:00.280 --> 2:58:07.320]  to to relieve them from uh being called war criminals later well that's what the whole
[2:58:07.320 --> 2:58:13.720]  NSA thing was is let's pass a law so what we did is a criminal um it's the same thing on torture
[2:58:13.720 --> 2:58:17.960]  let us pass a law that tortures okay because we tortured a bunch of people uh Robert Gaylen

[3:00:05.560 --> 3:00:10.600]  finishing up if they succeed what will the world look like if the globalists win
[3:00:10.600 --> 3:00:17.720]  what is their dream world and what's the time frame on that well uh it's really going to go back to
[3:00:18.760 --> 3:00:25.720]  the days and nights of the round table where the kings uh when they would go to the their
[3:00:25.720 --> 3:00:31.880]  neighboring castle to visit a friend they had to have a big army around them because they had uh
[3:00:31.880 --> 3:00:40.520]  uh made their people within their region paupers and we're going to end up very close to that
[3:00:41.160 --> 3:00:47.720]  ourselves uh uh people are going to be without things and they're going to be desperate they're
[3:00:47.720 --> 3:00:56.120]  going to have to resort to crime and and eventually there won't be enough jails to hold them all and
[3:00:56.120 --> 3:01:05.080]  so it's it's really going to be be tough and if we if we get past the end of 2009 and and start
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:13.800]  recovering then it'll be a short period but if we don't get past 2009 it's going to slide into
[3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:20.120]  depression meanwhile the globalists are showing every indication of trying to move their enslavement
[3:01:20.120 --> 3:01:25.080]  ahead i mean they're just going pal mel wild that's right all right ronnie in california you're on

[3:10:11.480 --> 3:10:16.600]  complete media lockdown on athens bill deberg meeting did recent exposures prompt elite
[3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:22.760]  confab and super secrecy or is the greek newspaper wrong uh could this just be a steering committee
[3:10:22.760 --> 3:10:27.240]  are they partially right we know they do have steering committees uh this is the journalist
[3:10:27.240 --> 3:10:33.960]  the man who runs bill deberg dot org he first uh broke this in the western english language press
[3:10:33.960 --> 3:10:37.880]  that this could be happening and it's important because they have tried a lot of tricks it's
[3:10:37.880 --> 3:10:42.760]  been decades since we didn't find out where they were meeting and indeed get there they normally meet
[3:10:42.760 --> 3:10:48.520]  in late may into early june uh but joining us is tony gosling from the united kingdom
[3:10:48.520 --> 3:10:53.320]  tony thanks for coming on hi alec yeah um the the interesting thing is though that i don't think
[3:10:53.320 --> 3:10:58.760]  we've had anything whatsoever in the english language about this uh before the event this year
[3:10:58.760 --> 3:11:03.000]  and there's still very very little i mean the fact that there was no opportunity for any journalist
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:08.360]  to actually get there this year means that uh they're saying very little i mean i i've had a look at
[3:11:08.360 --> 3:11:12.840]  i've had a look at this obviously i mean i don't speak greek i had a look at this and i put it through
[3:11:12.840 --> 3:11:18.120]  the various translation devices and things and it certainly looks as if this is the meeting the reason
[3:11:18.120 --> 3:11:23.480]  i say that is because um you know on the forum which is kind of off the side of the builder book
[3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:27.960]  dot org site uh there's been a lot of discussion over the past few weeks and months about where
[3:11:27.960 --> 3:11:33.880]  this meeting is going to take place um but this year uh we weren't absolutely certain even though
[3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:38.200]  it did look like it might well be greek because some of the main participants were going to be
[3:11:38.200 --> 3:11:44.360]  in the greek area at the time and also most interestingly the financial institutions like
[3:11:44.360 --> 3:11:51.880]  the imf uh had a kind of holiday uh booked for that time in southern europe uh so and also
[3:11:51.880 --> 3:11:56.360]  that the hope this particular hotel uh it does look as if it was a completely block book for the
[3:11:56.360 --> 3:12:00.840]  thursday friday well actually wednesday thursday friday sastan okay let's be clear then you're
[3:12:00.840 --> 3:12:05.480]  saying and i think your credible source been very accurate in the past uh for listeners out there
[3:12:05.480 --> 3:12:09.960]  wondering my opinion for what it's worth that i mean that i put a lot of stake in what you believe
[3:12:09.960 --> 3:12:14.920]  tony uh because you're one of the most tireless researchers on this front that have done so much
[3:12:14.920 --> 3:12:21.560]  work uh you're saying tentatively or 80 percent chance 70 60 i mean it's almost certain that this
[3:12:21.560 --> 3:12:27.000]  was the meeting of the past weekend the most significant thing about it is that uh this is
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:32.040]  the first time certainly since i've been doing this that uh and this is that's probably for 12 years or
[3:12:32.040 --> 3:12:36.680]  so uh that we haven't actually managed to figure out where they're meeting for certain beforehand
[3:12:36.680 --> 3:12:42.200]  now we had some pretty good indications that it was going to be in uh greece and at this particular
[3:12:42.200 --> 3:12:47.640]  hotel in a place beginning with v that i wouldn't even like to try and pronounce all spell it out
[3:12:47.640 --> 3:12:57.720]  for people v o is v o u l i a g m e n i volia me maybe um uh that it certainly did look like this
[3:12:57.720 --> 3:13:03.160]  is where it was going to take place and well this is a week ago or so uh the only trouble was
[3:13:03.160 --> 3:13:06.760]  we weren't absolutely certain so there was absolutely no way really that i was going to go
[3:13:07.640 --> 3:13:11.240]  out saying that this is where the meeting's taking place because it was a bit of a
[3:13:12.200 --> 3:13:16.360]  strong hint that it was going to be here we weren't sure about it okay so that's why you think
[3:13:16.360 --> 3:13:21.400]  this is so credible and you're saying virtually certain 95 percent uh chance i mean for the last
[3:13:21.400 --> 3:13:26.200]  for the last uh three or four weeks on the bill to work forum we've been saying it certainly
[3:13:26.200 --> 3:13:32.840]  looks like one of the first two weekends in greece uh in may now this is historically very early for
[3:13:32.840 --> 3:13:38.360]  them to be meeting no it's a rough round about the normal time i mean it's uh it's during may and
[3:13:38.360 --> 3:13:43.320]  june uh there's nothing particularly strange about the timing i was looking at some dates don't
[3:13:43.320 --> 3:13:48.520]  they generally meet and in the late may early june uh well yes but this week we're coming up for the
[3:13:48.520 --> 3:13:52.280]  middle of may there are other meetings around about this time i don't i don't think that's
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:13:57.240]  particularly special about this year okay but what you're saying is so credible is that you
[3:13:57.800 --> 3:14:03.240]  had got a lot of intel a lot of your sources that you trust we're pointing towards athens greece
[3:14:03.240 --> 3:14:07.400]  and now it appears that's happened well the thing the thing that really stands out this
[3:14:07.400 --> 3:14:13.160]  this year alex is the fact that we've had absolutely no uh information about the
[3:14:13.160 --> 3:14:16.840]  movements of some of the key builderberg people what's happening is that they're taking that
[3:14:16.840 --> 3:14:21.880]  information off the web now uh whereas in past years we were able to kind of look for
[3:14:21.880 --> 3:14:27.480]  for example the key people like david rockefeller the queen of the netherlands um the the president
[3:14:27.480 --> 3:14:33.640]  of europe all these various of the european union various various people like this in the past had
[3:14:33.640 --> 3:14:38.520]  been pretty good at putting on the web uh whereabouts there they were going what their engagements
[3:14:38.520 --> 3:14:42.760]  were uh you know in the future now and then you can see where they were clustering that's right
[3:14:42.760 --> 3:14:47.720]  you exactly and and uh this year that's been almost impossible to do because that information
[3:14:47.720 --> 3:14:52.120]  has just not been there i mean there's been a little bit so you know we've had a bit of a go
[3:14:52.120 --> 3:14:56.280]  at uh figuring out where they're going to be but so this is a score a big one for builderberg
[3:14:56.280 --> 3:15:01.400]  group this is a big victory this is yeah and also i think i mean my my own feeling is that it's a
[3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:06.200]  little bit ominous that they've decided that they need to really make sure that absolutely nobody
[3:15:06.200 --> 3:15:10.120]  in the english language covers them and that's what's happened this year there was not a single
[3:15:10.120 --> 3:15:14.280]  english language journalist there this year well you just stole my thunder let me stop you uh
[3:15:14.280 --> 3:15:19.560]  uh this if you're correct and i pray you're not because this will be a quite a victory for them
[3:15:19.560 --> 3:15:25.560]  they hate being hounded by us uh the first time in 30 plus years the tucker hasn't learned the
[3:15:25.560 --> 3:15:31.720]  location if this is uh the case and and i i'm being convinced by gosh i hope you're wrong
[3:15:32.280 --> 3:15:38.840]  uh but that's my next point man we've got fema camp roundup drills going on bizarre military
[3:15:38.840 --> 3:15:43.800]  activities all sorts of stuff and i'm not trying to fear monger folks i mean other people jump at
[3:15:43.800 --> 3:15:48.680]  shadows but i'm seeing a lot of weird stuff i've been very disquieted in my gut which i also always
[3:15:48.680 --> 3:15:54.200]  go off of and if they don't pull something big some new war some new financial thing they were
[3:15:54.200 --> 3:15:59.240]  certainly thinking about it and and and the fact that they would go super stealth like this would
[3:15:59.240 --> 3:16:04.760]  show and point towards something was happening here that they did not want to be known go ahead
[3:16:04.760 --> 3:16:10.120]  that's right and also the venue this year is a really isolated place i mean you know if you're
[3:16:10.120 --> 3:16:14.920]  or i were to get down there alex we'd have found it very very difficult to get close to uh them uh
[3:16:14.920 --> 3:16:21.400]  to speak to anyone from the hotel to ask the waiters etc uh to keep an eye on them to inform
[3:16:21.400 --> 3:16:27.160]  the staff at the hotel uh about the nazi roots of bilderberg you know the prince burnhard setting
[3:16:27.160 --> 3:16:32.680]  it up in the first place and uh it's actually one of the most important things uh i've found going
[3:16:32.680 --> 3:16:36.760]  to these bilderberg meetings is to actually have a chat to the staff beforehand and when you actually
[3:16:36.760 --> 3:16:42.920]  explain to them the connections with fascism and the nazis then uh often the staff are shocked
[3:16:42.920 --> 3:16:47.320]  and are actually quite cooperative and in fact you also find as you probably found yourself
[3:16:47.320 --> 3:16:52.600]  that some of the participants also find these meetings really smothering i mean we we had a
[3:16:52.600 --> 3:16:58.600]  chat to a couple of politicians so when i was at the uh the meeting in fact a few years ago
[3:16:58.600 --> 3:17:02.680]  who actually come out of the meeting to buy cigarettes just to have any excuse to get out of
[3:17:02.680 --> 3:17:08.680]  the place these were the politicians not the the finance by smothering describe from all the tidbits
[3:17:08.680 --> 3:17:12.760]  you've gotten over the years from your sources and even mainstream press reports by smothering
[3:17:12.760 --> 3:17:21.080]  what you mean uh sorry described by smothering what you mean what i mean i i mean describe uh
[3:17:21.080 --> 3:17:27.400]  details of the definition of smothering well i mean what they do is they they uh they try and
[3:17:27.400 --> 3:17:32.840]  make sure that nobody gets any information about these uh these conferences i mean i think they
[3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:39.080]  they also have in the past put out this information uh put out false lists with uh sort of weird
[3:17:39.080 --> 3:17:43.560]  jewish names loads of jewish names on there so that the idea is to sort of associate that with
[3:17:43.560 --> 3:17:49.480]  people like you and i alex to brandis as anti seamites uh and and there's just been a very very
[3:17:49.480 --> 3:17:55.560]  very little um you know information about that's right they really want to make this an anti-semitic
[3:17:55.560 --> 3:18:01.080]  thing and that's why they've been caught funding nazi groups and pr groups because that's so important
[3:18:01.080 --> 3:18:05.480]  that we now have a real political debate about this they want to tame it with a you know what in
[3:18:05.480 --> 3:18:09.720]  the punch bowl i mean if you and i had the sort of financing that these people from the federal
[3:18:09.720 --> 3:18:15.400]  reserve european central bank the imf had behind their uh pr operation and behind their intelligence
[3:18:15.400 --> 3:18:21.960]  operation i mean and their disinformation operation then uh you know i think we we we would be uh we
[3:18:21.960 --> 3:18:26.680]  would be laughing but but i mean they they they have a fantastic amount of resources to put
[3:18:26.680 --> 3:18:31.480]  uh into this uh i mean i think that's pretty clear to me that uh that they're planning something
[3:18:31.480 --> 3:18:35.640]  pretty nasty coming up soon that's why they've spent a lot of uh a lot of time and effort
[3:18:35.640 --> 3:18:40.520]  this year keeping everybody away from them uh also of course it's significant that they're
[3:18:40.520 --> 3:18:45.720]  down in greece because these people are big followers of the greek classical mythology
[3:18:45.720 --> 3:18:52.520]  and uh eugenics pre christian stuff eugenics their religion is eugenics in the worship of the
[3:18:52.520 --> 3:18:58.440]  spartan eugenics system that's right so i think it is significant that they they wanted to have a
[3:18:58.440 --> 3:19:03.720]  big meeting in greece this year to make it kind of glitzy but absolutely private and it scares me
[3:19:03.720 --> 3:19:09.800]  actually that that they're able to keep any any scrutiny by any of the western press out of there
[3:19:09.800 --> 3:19:14.600]  and of course our job in the past years even if the press don't listen in the west it's just at
[3:19:14.600 --> 3:19:19.880]  least flag it up to the press to make sure that few of them do turn up tony gosselin billard
[3:19:19.880 --> 3:19:24.280]  burke dot org stay with us if you can i want to come back and ask you a few other questions about
[3:19:24.280 --> 3:19:30.760]  what you think this big nasty uh thing could be we know two years ago plus they said they were

[3:23:57.320 --> 3:24:03.960]  joins us uh weeks ago he was speculating a lot of evidence was coming in as you told you that it
[3:24:03.960 --> 3:24:10.760]  was going to be in greece and he believes that it happened last weekend and that they went in and
[3:24:10.760 --> 3:24:17.240]  met other than this report from them i mean do you know how credible this uh this news source is
[3:24:17.240 --> 3:24:21.560]  i mean it looks credible looks like they've got a lot of people on staff i it's just so hard to try
[3:24:21.560 --> 3:24:28.600]  to read greek i mean you really think that they've met and defeated us i think so uh the uh this
[3:24:28.600 --> 3:24:32.600]  this newspaper i mean there's just two things that make me think that first of all is that it was
[3:24:32.600 --> 3:24:36.760]  pointing towards greece anyway little looked like it was going to be there and then this is a national
[3:24:36.760 --> 3:24:42.040]  newspaper in greece that even though it's printed in creep apparently it's uh circulated right across
[3:24:42.040 --> 3:24:47.560]  greece and it's on the front page of the newspaper picture of this bill de berg meeting or a picture
[3:24:47.560 --> 3:24:53.560]  from afar from a telephoto lens of it happening uh i don't think it's a steering group but i mean
[3:24:53.560 --> 3:24:59.080]  we the thing is this is part of their little game but at the end of the day looking at comparing
[3:24:59.080 --> 3:25:03.880]  all these various sources i think uh you know that they have there's definitely been a big security
[3:25:03.880 --> 3:25:08.440]  clamp down this year and it doesn't entirely surprise me all right well other people get found out
[3:25:08.440 --> 3:25:12.520]  other people get depressed when their soccer team loses i get depressed yeah i know well it is it is
[3:25:12.520 --> 3:25:17.880]  you do feel like it's a bit of a body blow but in a way uh you know there's there's only so much
[3:25:17.880 --> 3:25:23.320]  that you can do at one of these extremely secluded island style venues anyway you know you can't
[3:25:23.320 --> 3:25:28.040]  necessarily get very close to you know but being across the water circling in a boat
[3:25:28.040 --> 3:25:32.520]  being harassed by police then gets it in the news yeah and then we expose the shadow government
[3:25:32.520 --> 3:25:37.240]  this is this is not good if you're right and until we respect you but but let me just move
[3:25:37.240 --> 3:25:42.760]  forward what do you think and then make whatever point you want what do you think the big nasties
[3:25:42.760 --> 3:25:47.240]  are that they were planning well it's really difficult to tell that alex and you know one
[3:25:47.240 --> 3:25:52.680]  doesn't want to get really too much into fear mongering but that does seem to me that we are
[3:25:52.680 --> 3:25:58.040]  headed towards some sort of a clash possibly with the chinese there's loads of anti-chinese stuff
[3:25:58.040 --> 3:26:02.520]  going on and goodness knows what's going to happen i mean this i've said in the little report i've
[3:26:02.520 --> 3:26:08.760]  done about this year's bill de berg um non or meeting last weekend as it seems on bill de
[3:26:08.760 --> 3:26:14.680]  berg dot org that uh that it it does look like this maybe uh you know that this up and coming
[3:26:14.680 --> 3:26:20.760]  olympics is going to be a kind of a little bit like the uh berlin olympics of 1936 where we had
[3:26:20.760 --> 3:26:27.880]  this kind of uh rather extreme regime hosting the games and of course it's a it's an absolute
[3:26:27.880 --> 3:26:33.560]  powder kick anything that happens at those games could could kick off uh something much wider
[3:26:33.560 --> 3:26:38.200]  so that's something that's worrying me i mean i personally if i was an athlete i would want to
[3:26:38.200 --> 3:26:43.160]  stay away from the games particularly because of what what a a nasty regime the chinese are i mean
[3:26:43.160 --> 3:26:47.080]  they're really not even in vaguely interested in freedom of speech they're arresting bloggers left
[3:26:47.080 --> 3:26:53.240]  right and center uh and uh there is no freedom of speech in china i met some chinese journalists
[3:26:53.240 --> 3:27:00.360]  recently and i was really quite horrified as to how obedient they were to the chinese government
[3:27:00.360 --> 3:27:04.040]  you know you think to yourself hopefully the journalists will have at least a little interest
[3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:08.520]  in sympathy for ordinary people but these people didn't at all and they seem thought it was very
[3:27:08.520 --> 3:27:13.160]  very strange that we should even question what what the chinese government wanted to say so
[3:27:13.160 --> 3:27:18.520]  you know that's that's one aspect of all this the other thing of course is that we've had uh two
[3:27:19.320 --> 3:27:26.520]  big false flag attacks in the u.s in 9 11 and here in the uk on 7 7 uh one of the places
[3:27:26.520 --> 3:27:30.840]  that we haven't had that yet is israel so i wonder if something like that could happen over there
[3:27:30.840 --> 3:27:37.240]  a lot of no idea a lot of experts we talk to do think the next stage to vent is set for israel
[3:27:37.240 --> 3:27:42.360]  well we'll see uh the other thing of course which is a massive possibility is a kind of uh
[3:27:42.360 --> 3:27:48.040]  uh i don't know how to describe it really but a sort of gulf tonkin for real where you have
[3:27:48.040 --> 3:27:54.440]  uh you know british ships or u.s ships that are basically just uh exploded and then that is blamed
[3:27:54.440 --> 3:27:59.880]  on whoever it is that they want to kick off this war with uh thankfully i think it's it's fair to
[3:27:59.880 --> 3:28:07.320]  say in britain here that our military is it is aware of the danger of these kinds of exercises
[3:28:07.320 --> 3:28:13.000]  and uh of also these kind of tricks that are used to get war started i'm not quite so sure that's
[3:28:13.000 --> 3:28:17.960]  true out in the rest of the world so it will be really interesting to see what happens let's just
[3:28:17.960 --> 3:28:22.360]  pray to god that nothing does happen uh the other thing i wanted to say though is that i've been
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:27.560]  doing a lot of reading recently around the whole sort of origins of the new world order
[3:28:27.560 --> 3:28:31.560]  i don't know if you alex have ever come across this author denis weakley have you
[3:28:31.560 --> 3:28:38.280]  it rings a bell denis weakley so it was one of the most prolific authors came out of britain in
[3:28:38.280 --> 3:28:44.840]  the 1930s 40s 50s and 60s and uh he did a there was a couple of films made about his books one of
[3:28:44.840 --> 3:28:51.320]  the most famous is called the devil rides out um but back in 1941 i discovered denis talking
[3:28:51.320 --> 3:28:57.080]  about the new world order and this does that you know also sort of joins the dots between the second
[3:28:57.080 --> 3:29:02.280]  world war and the current conflict um what he's saying is in the new world order all family life
[3:29:02.280 --> 3:29:07.240]  will be at an end except for the conquerors and only the worst element spiritually will be allowed
[3:29:07.240 --> 3:29:13.800]  to procreate fresh generations to populate a world divided into masters and slaves now that was 1941
[3:29:13.800 --> 3:29:18.280]  he wrote that under the shadow of the second world war well that's what they're obsessed with it's
[3:29:18.280 --> 3:29:23.800]  a eugenics empire and instead we argue about who exactly runs it well we know that what they're
[3:29:23.800 --> 3:29:27.480]  carrying out i tell what tony can you stay with us five more minutes i want to hear you talk more
[3:29:27.480 --> 3:29:32.680]  about this okay uh he thinks billerberg already happened this is true it's horrible news but
[3:29:32.680 --> 3:29:38.040]  we'll continue to cover it on the other side we're on the march the empires on the run

[3:33:51.560 --> 3:33:55.640]  up eugenics bringing up their program bringing up their control he's bringing up an author who
[3:33:55.640 --> 3:34:00.600]  had this figured out back during the 40s i've heard that name tell me more about that guy that
[3:34:00.600 --> 3:34:06.520]  this is interesting Dennis Dennis was actually a second world war hero he was he was a writer in
[3:34:06.520 --> 3:34:12.040]  the 30s but he was also very close to people like alistair crowley and some of these are cultists
[3:34:12.920 --> 3:34:18.440]  so he's actually kind of into the white magic style thing but he he was so he's been around
[3:34:18.440 --> 3:34:22.840]  these people again and he he knew what they were up to so he spoke to me exactly so so so what's
[3:34:22.840 --> 3:34:29.880]  his name again Dennis what it's Dennis weekly w h e a t l e y now one of the weird things is
[3:34:29.880 --> 3:34:34.280]  there was a big copyright battle just after he died and so his material even though it was
[3:34:34.280 --> 3:34:39.480]  published as i said in the 30s right the way up till the 70s there's hardly been any copies of his
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:45.400]  books are printed at all since then so you have to get on to uh you know sort of uh second hand
[3:34:45.400 --> 3:34:48.840]  book shops and that kind of thing could get hold of Dennis's okay but he knew about the new old
[3:34:48.840 --> 3:34:54.280]  order what did he say well he said as i just explained to you um that stuff he was also writing
[3:34:54.280 --> 3:34:58.680]  about uh he said that Winston Churchill he believed was a member of the Illuminati of Adam
[3:34:58.680 --> 3:35:05.000]  Price out he said that in one of his books well he was a public member of the Druids well yes but
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:10.760]  he's talking about the Illuminati now uh of course this is you know we need to get serious about
[3:35:10.760 --> 3:35:15.400]  this Illuminati stuff because if you go back far enough there's plenty of evidence that these people
[3:35:15.400 --> 3:35:20.600]  very much did exist and the main people who are exposing the Illuminati back in the time that
[3:35:20.600 --> 3:35:28.040]  they very first started was actually a Freemason himself he exposed it John Roberson um because
[3:35:28.040 --> 3:35:34.040]  he could see the way that Freemasonry was being twisted by these people uh and infiltrated so
[3:35:34.040 --> 3:35:39.080]  George Washington by the way before he died came out against it as well now let's be clear
[3:35:39.080 --> 3:35:43.560]  if we say all masons are you know these wicked devils they're going to think we're liars because
[3:35:43.560 --> 3:35:48.920]  most of them are porch masons lower down in the pyramidal structure not at the capstone
[3:35:48.920 --> 3:35:53.960]  but we need to explain that they use the mechanism of the masonic system to take over and then
[3:35:53.960 --> 3:36:01.800]  forge their Illuminati of this subversive political arm funded by some of the covert European powers
[3:36:01.800 --> 3:36:07.480]  but absolutely I mean that's a historical fact that that exists and goes on well the other thing
[3:36:07.480 --> 3:36:13.160]  Dennis Wheatley says was that there would be the rest would the right the right to homes and
[3:36:13.160 --> 3:36:18.520]  children of their own would be reserved for the overlords the rest would be herded into barracks
[3:36:18.520 --> 3:36:24.360]  and reduced to the level of robots without the right to read or speak or even think for themselves
[3:36:24.360 --> 3:36:29.800]  and he also pointed out that there could be no revolt because every officer priest deputy editor
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:35.960]  magistrate writer and any other leader of free thought and action in the conquered countries
[3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:41.560]  would already have been executed by firing squads and leaderless herds cannot prevail
[3:36:41.560 --> 3:36:46.440]  against tanks tear gas bombs and machine guns now that's a direct quote from 1941
[3:36:46.440 --> 3:36:51.800]  yeah very nice people yeah but i mean i find it fascinating that he was he was talking about all
[3:36:51.800 --> 3:36:56.120]  this stuff all that time ago and then we see this whole idea of you know hitler being his kind of
[3:36:56.120 --> 3:37:00.520]  man god as he was at the time you know i think that's what we're going to be seeing in the future
[3:37:00.520 --> 3:37:05.560]  someone coming along to do a similar kind of thing obviously much better spun than the current
[3:37:05.560 --> 3:37:10.440]  that than the than hitler was also i mean we're seeing in britain now i mean i don't know how
[3:37:10.440 --> 3:37:15.240]  much you follow british politics they're really incredible attack on gordon brown yeah i follow
[3:37:15.240 --> 3:37:19.800]  it i follow it closely i think i think it's i mean it's all psychological tactics if you
[3:37:19.800 --> 3:37:24.520]  go back to the mid seventies you'll see that the secret state in britain attacked harrell wilson
[3:37:24.520 --> 3:37:29.480]  in a very similar way uh... gordon brown i mean he was one of the people who was part of the cabinet
[3:37:29.480 --> 3:37:34.600]  that signed up to the war the iraq war and he signed up to have england enter the u u and he's
[3:37:34.600 --> 3:37:39.240]  but but you wonder you do wonder if maybe he had his fingers crossed behind his back at the time
[3:37:39.240 --> 3:37:44.520]  because a lot of the stuff he's doing now he's really kind of batting in in in uh what we will
[3:37:44.520 --> 3:37:49.160]  call i suppose christian socialist principles old-fashioned socialist principles which is to
[3:37:49.160 --> 3:37:54.040]  do with making sure that the poor are reasonably well looked after that the some of the at least of
[3:37:54.040 --> 3:37:59.160]  the nationalized industries like our national health service over here is preserved and uh you
[3:37:59.160 --> 3:38:04.920]  know he's fighting for that stuff he's also actually quite it seems anti-zionist because
[3:38:04.920 --> 3:38:10.120]  he is he has presided over a government which for the first time for years we've had his is really
[3:38:10.120 --> 3:38:13.880]  uh right-wing speakers turning up at london airport and then being told well we can't guarantee
[3:38:13.880 --> 3:38:18.040]  that you're not going to be arrested uh if you want to come in this country yeah that was actually
[3:38:18.040 --> 3:38:23.800]  an israeli general yeah uh so so you know we're seeing a bit of a bit of a change with gordon
[3:38:23.800 --> 3:38:29.240]  brown as leader and you can see that the city of london and well let's be clear that was the mayor
[3:38:29.240 --> 3:38:34.200]  of london helping try to put out the arrest warrant for him notice they just kicked him out
[3:38:34.200 --> 3:38:39.000]  but uh you know expanding on that so they were warning him to leave so he so they wouldn't get
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:44.920]  him on a warrant in london uh but uh i mean certainly i i think it's more like getting
[3:38:44.920 --> 3:38:50.200]  rid of george bush and putting in a barack obama uh i think it's that they know that they're not
[3:38:50.200 --> 3:38:55.800]  moving the ball down the field so they switch left right right left left right back and forth
[3:38:55.800 --> 3:38:59.880]  you see there are really two different sorts of leaders in the world today uh at least in the
[3:38:59.880 --> 3:39:07.480]  western world those who are uh vulnerable and uh can be manipulated uh like gordon brown
[3:39:07.480 --> 3:39:13.240]  i think he's basically quite a weak minded guy uh and uh it may and think is that maybe that's
[3:39:13.240 --> 3:39:18.200]  the reason he's still alive i mean what happened to robin cook robin cook was basically the uh
[3:39:18.200 --> 3:39:22.760]  the labor party leader in waiting so when tony blare went out was almost certain that robin
[3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:27.240]  cook was going to become leader well across the world attack him yeah well he had a big
[3:39:27.240 --> 3:39:33.320]  accident during an exercise up in the scottish mountain and a helicopter came and took him away
[3:39:33.320 --> 3:39:37.240]  and refused to let his wife get in the helicopter with him and by the time it was the helicopter
[3:39:37.240 --> 3:39:41.640]  of death a bit like diana's ambulance of death when by the time he got to the hospital he was in
[3:39:41.640 --> 3:39:46.840]  a really terrible state and he died you know uh you know maybe gordon brown is only alive because
[3:39:46.840 --> 3:39:52.440]  he's a bit weak and easily manipulated well i have no doubt that the globalists are very very
[3:39:52.440 --> 3:39:57.320]  serious people so bottom line tony gosseling from millerberg dot org you think they just
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:02.040]  had the meeting uh in greece this weekend i'm afraid so alex yep looks like they've beaten
[3:40:02.040 --> 3:40:07.240]  beaten us this year i mean we can't win every year i suppose uh and i just would ask you are just
[3:40:07.240 --> 3:40:14.280]  ask your uh your listeners uh let's try uh next year really hard to track down various you know
[3:40:14.280 --> 3:40:20.520]  looking at hotels our hotels free for that particular weekend and to to really uh give them a hard
[3:40:20.520 --> 3:40:26.040]  time but let me just say this in case you're wrong well i could be absolutely right so i
[3:40:26.040 --> 3:40:32.280]  really looking for the location now because this could be an elaborate uh foil i think i think it's
[3:40:32.280 --> 3:40:36.760]  very unlikely you're absolutely right we don't know for sure it's always the case i mean as you
[3:40:36.760 --> 3:40:41.720]  know alex going to these bill deberg meetings you're never 100 sure that you've got the right venue
[3:40:41.720 --> 3:40:46.920]  the right time in the right place until you see david rockefeller sorry until you see david rockefeller
[3:40:46.920 --> 3:40:52.520]  well once he's yes once you actually fly to the to the venue you turn up and you actually turn up on
[3:40:52.520 --> 3:40:57.240]  the right morning on the Thursday morning you that is and of course you have to first be arrested
[3:40:57.240 --> 3:41:02.200]  getting off the plane of course that's always a cue you're at the right city right country too because
[3:41:02.200 --> 3:41:06.760]  they then you know detain you and scream at you yeah but there are i mean they're really we really
[3:41:06.760 --> 3:41:10.600]  have to work a little bit harder next year i mean i've been doing my best but you know we need to
[3:41:10.600 --> 3:41:14.680]  more people working on this to figure out where they're going to be in uh next year we don't want
[3:41:14.680 --> 3:41:19.560]  it to evade our attention next year sure tony gosling bill deberg dot org thank you for popping
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:23.320]  in with us and as this develops in the next few days i'd like to have you visit with us again
[3:41:23.320 --> 3:41:28.200]  thank you for all your great reportage thank you alex for all you do take care uh look he's a
[3:41:28.200 --> 3:41:32.920]  credible guy and he does a lot of good work at his site and he's been right in the past i hope
[3:41:32.920 --> 3:41:37.800]  he's wrong this time we talked to jim tucker this morning he doesn't think that he's been fooled and
[3:41:37.800 --> 3:41:44.120]  he hasn't ever been fooled yet uh he has narrowly found out like a day before it starts and jumped
[3:41:44.120 --> 3:41:49.880]  on an all nighter and flown you know 10 hours 12 hours uh to be arrested once he gets off the plane
[3:41:49.880 --> 3:41:55.000]  he always knows that's oh i'm i'm i'm here uh he doesn't think that he wouldn't come on today
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:59.880]  he said i don't know i've got a research i'll come on tomorrow so we'll have jim tucker on tomorrow no
[3:41:59.880 --> 3:42:07.480]  down uh i i don't want to beat up on tony gosling and he's a good guy i hope he's wrong though
[3:42:07.480 --> 3:42:14.120]  no because uh i hope that they haven't been able to uh hide this but the fact that they're
[3:42:14.120 --> 3:42:17.720]  jumping through all these hoops to do it shows that they're very angry that they're getting so
[3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:22.680]  much press coverage i mean seven years ago the new york time said i was insane and believed in
[3:42:22.680 --> 3:42:28.600]  imaginary builder group just like i'm insane and the marisol wasn't the vaccines and then it was
[3:42:28.600 --> 3:42:35.480]  but it's out but mercury's good for you see i mean it's an insanity all everything they do
[3:42:35.480 --> 3:42:40.760]  is just so crazy oh homeland security have you talked about the constitution need to be arrested
[3:42:40.760 --> 3:42:50.040]  that's terror code again that sounds insane but they're doing it it's all happening i'm gonna take
[3:42:50.040 --> 3:42:53.880]  a lone caller here because he's been holding so long i'm gonna get into the latest deborjean
[3:42:53.880 --> 3:42:59.560]  palpherty uh situation since people reminded me about it uh james in ohio you're on the air go ahead
[3:42:59.560 --> 3:43:09.080]  alex hello my friend a man is telling him not taking it anymore uh i want to uh express the same
[3:43:09.080 --> 3:43:15.640]  sentiments your last caller had and uh let you know that i'm trying to get as many dvd
[3:43:15.640 --> 3:43:23.480]  educational dvd out there as i can you know end game freedom to fascism uh terror storm
[3:43:23.480 --> 3:43:29.960]  storm just pass them out as much as i can you know i'm limited income so i do it on payday i'll
[3:43:29.960 --> 3:43:36.520]  pass out about 25 no but uh you've ever one of our listeners would do that we'd win this battle
[3:43:36.520 --> 3:43:42.040]  very very quickly yeah we gotta get together and really work at it but no i wouldn't ask you a quick
[3:43:42.040 --> 3:43:47.720]  question um doing a little bit of research on my own and i come across the red and the blue list
[3:43:47.720 --> 3:43:53.880]  what do you know other countries always have a list people that are to be arrested people that
[3:43:53.880 --> 3:44:01.000]  are to be killed people that are to be rounded up and totalitarian regimes always have these
[3:44:01.000 --> 3:44:06.440]  they're very hard to carry out uh we see fema doing these type drills right now and they've
[3:44:06.440 --> 3:44:12.120]  built camps they admit they want to put political dissidents in them a lot of bank owners a lot of
[3:44:12.120 --> 3:44:19.080]  well-known preachers people have even served them on the list to be picked up uh if they try it it'll
[3:44:19.080 --> 3:44:24.200]  be a big canary in the coal mine i mean the common person out there uh the feds also uses
[3:44:24.200 --> 3:44:28.280]  his propaganda and i appreciate your call james let me answer your question and move on the feds
[3:44:28.280 --> 3:44:32.280]  and we know people that are feds and people that put out this info they love to run around and go
[3:44:32.280 --> 3:44:36.920]  if you ever talk about the new order you're on the list if you ever visited a site you're on it
[3:44:36.920 --> 3:44:42.840]  be afraid sit in your room with your knees knocking together don't go out in public hide
[3:44:42.840 --> 3:44:49.480]  secretly uh meet with a militia person behind a barn in the middle of nowhere bring weapons
[3:44:49.480 --> 3:44:57.480]  that's it watch out the list they're everywhere you know and and and and then you go and it's feds
[3:44:58.360 --> 3:45:03.560]  uh so what i mean they've got a million people they keep giving the numbers out from like a year
[3:45:03.560 --> 3:45:12.920]  ago of 900 and something thousand uh 994 000 on the terrorist list and it said uh five-year-old girl
[3:45:12.920 --> 3:45:17.240]  takes a picture on the plan of their mother the federal marshals protested last year and said
[3:45:17.240 --> 3:45:20.840]  we have to put them on a list for the rest of their life for their terrorist and then they said we
[3:45:20.840 --> 3:45:25.000]  don't want to do this we're told to make up that they're terrorist and and and i mean it's made up
[3:45:25.000 --> 3:45:32.200]  it's not real it's all part of the hysteria the backdrop um you ever you ever sold a car and went
[3:45:32.200 --> 3:45:36.760]  in and and normally you only get a thousand dollar paycheck every two weeks but you deposited five
[3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:41.000]  thousand because you sold that old truck you're on a terror list for the rest of your life i mean
[3:45:41.000 --> 3:45:45.400]  that's just it's all about getting everyone on the terror list because the terrorists run the
[3:45:45.400 --> 3:45:50.040]  government and they're waging war on us and so so what they're the terrorists let's put them on
[3:45:50.040 --> 3:45:55.720]  public list as traitor enemies of the republic uh you know they can't get us all they're not
[3:45:55.720 --> 3:46:00.760]  going to get us all we can't be like the germans and just go along with it they always try to set
[3:46:00.760 --> 3:46:06.920]  it first well it's just this minority just the gypsies first uh and you know they've got a culture
[3:46:06.920 --> 3:46:13.400]  of robbing and cheating everybody else so it's okay cultural hygiene to go ahead and arrest them
[3:46:13.400 --> 3:46:19.560]  and put them in labor camps for their own good uh and then then it's another group and then another
[3:46:19.560 --> 3:46:24.040]  group and then another group and then another group but but the main target's always the german
[3:46:24.040 --> 3:46:28.840]  people it's always the american people it's always the british people it's always so see they beta
[3:46:28.840 --> 3:46:33.880]  test it as rex 84 says the government says we'll claim it's free legal aliens but it'll be for the
[3:46:33.880 --> 3:46:39.960]  citizens and see now you see that happening as they kind of yeah they're a round up arrest teams and
[3:46:39.960 --> 3:46:43.960]  they got we're putting people through the cattle shoots in Des Moines iowa that the
[3:46:43.960 --> 3:46:52.840]  and i've got the article there's photos there's video uh so see it's all i like these teams that
[3:46:52.840 --> 3:46:57.720]  take you to sport stadiums you know that take you to the cattle pens i mean they're putting
[3:46:57.720 --> 3:47:03.240]  them through cattle pens it's all a message it's all can't talk about the constitution you're going
[3:47:03.240 --> 3:47:11.800]  to cattle pens it's all our title um so they want us to all basically potty in our pants and and
[3:47:11.800 --> 3:47:17.240]  just uh and just all freak out and paranoia and run when they're the traders they're the enemies
[3:47:17.240 --> 3:47:22.680]  they're shameful they're disgusting they would have been able to carry this off if we hadn't
[3:47:22.680 --> 3:47:27.000]  have exposed that they're the terrorist they would have been able to get away with this if we wouldn't
[3:47:27.000 --> 3:47:32.200]  have exposed that they carried out the attacks now most people know now their credibility is blown
[3:47:32.200 --> 3:47:36.440]  they're in deep trouble they're just trying to move through things and use their great
[3:47:36.440 --> 3:47:42.840]  mass in inertia to follow through uh shifting gears uh but yeah there are some lists about who's
[3:47:42.840 --> 3:47:48.120]  to be arrested and who's to be killed and they really do have a list of people i assure you i'm
[3:47:48.120 --> 3:47:53.080]  on the red list ladies and gentlemen do i care i get out on the highway every day deadly dangerous
[3:47:53.080 --> 3:48:00.760]  and i do it because i want to be able to travel and i enjoy driving do i uh you know cry and
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:06.440]  whine and oh my god i'm on the driving list no and uh is there a small chance much smaller
[3:48:06.440 --> 3:48:11.240]  compared to dying an automobile accident that'll come get me and kill me yeah but i mean i'm a man
[3:48:11.240 --> 3:48:15.160]  i mean it's about you know going well that's you know i'm fighting a bunch of scum i mean
[3:48:15.160 --> 3:48:19.320]  they might come kill me i hope that doesn't happen but do i take a lot of precautions
[3:48:19.320 --> 3:48:23.800]  do i run around in fear no i just kind of go well you know they're a bunch of dinecore child
[3:48:23.800 --> 3:48:29.560]  kidnappers i gotta speak out against them you know it's it's not i mean the fact that we have to
[3:48:29.560 --> 3:48:34.280]  ask ourselves if we should do this the fact that we have to question whether we should even speak
[3:48:34.280 --> 3:48:39.960]  out or do something shows why we're in so much trouble now listen to this cnn piece there's a
[3:48:39.960 --> 3:48:44.440]  cnn prime saturday i've never played it because i frankly the only talking about myself but it's
[3:48:44.440 --> 3:48:52.040]  an important issue because they they imply that oh well you know they claim that she thought she
[3:48:52.040 --> 3:48:56.920]  might be being followed no she said i think there's a head out on me and then oh people claim she said
[3:48:56.920 --> 3:49:02.440]  that this was going no no she said this or oh her manager says the handwriting doesn't look the same
[3:49:02.440 --> 3:49:08.200]  and they use one little example uh and oh well you know that's just so so they basically just put
[3:49:08.200 --> 3:49:16.040]  out a bunch of disinfo and it really is shameful here that is power free kill herself or did somebody
[3:49:16.040 --> 3:49:21.560]  kill her now we pose that question because it's being posed by hundreds of bloggers if not the
[3:49:21.560 --> 3:49:27.320]  thousands that are responding to those blogs we've asked josh leves to check into these for us and he's
[3:49:27.320 --> 3:49:31.480]  joining us now live to actually break this down for us josh take it away yeah hey there rick one
[3:49:31.480 --> 3:49:35.640]  of the most prominent blogs taking a look at this is right here it's called prisonplanet.com and they've
[3:49:35.640 --> 3:49:40.440]  been talking about this very frequently at times every day they have for example this one piece that
[3:49:40.440 --> 3:49:45.320]  says her friend said that that's not her signature on the suicide note let me scroll down a little bit
[3:49:45.320 --> 3:49:49.480]  show you the kinds of things that are going on online they're putting together a piece a signature
[3:49:49.480 --> 3:49:53.400]  that they've seen from her rather a piece of handwriting they've seen of her before and her
[3:49:53.400 --> 3:49:58.520]  handwriting on her suicide note they're saying was she forced to do this is it even really hers
[3:49:58.520 --> 3:50:03.240]  also the same side at another point talks about look they say even the washington post said that
[3:50:03.240 --> 3:50:07.400]  after she went to jail she would have been able to make all this money she would have been famous
[3:50:07.400 --> 3:50:11.080]  there would have been book deals movies why would she possibly do this so these are the kinds of
[3:50:11.080 --> 3:50:14.680]  things people were batting back and forth and saying hey does it even make sense that she would

[3:50:22.120 --> 3:50:28.120]  breaking down what somebody's handwriting then they come back and say actually women do hang
[3:50:28.120 --> 3:50:32.840]  themselves a lot less than men but it's not that big of a difference and then they add into that
[3:50:32.840 --> 3:50:38.760]  asphyxiation by carbon monoxide a bunch of other stuff i mean it's just these guys are
