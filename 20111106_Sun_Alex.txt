[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   That is the new hit single, Public Enemy number one.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.280]   The album is 13.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.280]   Of course, it's Megadeth, Dave Mustaine.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.040]   And when we come back in the next segment,
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   we're going to play part of We the People that
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.880]   is extremely powerful with its message of liberty and freedom.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.960]   Dave Mustaine joins us.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.480]   We're about to go to break, but let's go ahead
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.000]   and bring Dave up right now.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.560]   Dave, thank you for joining us.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.560]   You're welcome.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560]   Wow, there--
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.040]   Good morning to all your listeners.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.760]   Absolutely, good morning to all of them.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.200]   I'm sorry I woke you up yesterday when I called you.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   Oh, that's all right.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.520]   Got to sleep sometimes.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.240]   I had missed Jimmy Kimmel Live.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.960]   I don't think I've ever seen you dress up as a Halloween
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.400]   character, much less Frankenstein.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.360]   You know, it's funny.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.360]   I was telling the guys over at Kimmel that when I was 18,
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.120]   I was hanging out with the wrong kind of people
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.280]   and actually had gotten arrested that night,
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.680]   dressed up like Eddie from Iron Maiden.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.560]   But fortunately, that was--
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.520]   it was just one of those young and dumb things.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.320]   And they let me go.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.240]   I just wanted to make sure I wasn't some wacko dressed up
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.920]   like Eddie.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.320]   They'd never seen anything like that before.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.920]   Yeah, pretty scary, especially when--
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.760]   What's the top of the hatchet in the album?
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.280]   Oh, the hatchet part.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.600]   Yeah, it was from the album cover, "Killers," the very first
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.160]   one when Eddie was--
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.840]   that was the first Iron Maiden record I'd heard.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.280]   Yeah, that's a scary album cover.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.840]   He's got blood all over him with the hatchet,
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.560]   and he's got a leering smile.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.400]   Yeah, he's winking.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.560]   Well, wow, the new album has raced up
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.600]   to the very top of the charts.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.400]   Congratulations.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.320]   It only came out, what, yesterday?
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.720]   You know, I'm so excited about everything that's happening.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.480]   We've got such a great campaign right now.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.480]   The folks at Roadrunner and the folks with my management
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.640]   and all of our representatives with our agency and everything
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.800]   have just really kicked this one out of the park.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.640]   Paying attention to what my goals are, what I want to do,
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.400]   and what I have left to do on my bucket list.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.040]   And who would have thought just a month and a half ago,
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.760]   I would be standing on a stage in Yankee Stadium?
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.280]   Yeah, you've got the Big Four, one of the hottest concerts
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.720]   in the world right now, one of the biggest concerts
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.280]   in the world.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.960]   You're about to travel down to South America to giant crowds.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.200]   Dave Mustaine's our guest.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.360]   The full interview, straight ahead, live.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.160]   It's November 2.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.760]   Stay with us.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:04.600]   When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.200]   is on the road.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.160]   But if the unfortunate happens, you'll
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.400]   be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.440]   There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.120]   where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.720]   They sew pride in every stitch, guarantee
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.520]   you love the way they fit.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.160]   They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.000]   Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.280]   Others don't.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.400]   We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.160]   Diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.080]   with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.760]   Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.760]   with Kevlar protection, so you can
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.680]   ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.400]   Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.720]   Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.720]   Others don't.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.760]   Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.040]   You want answers?
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.040]   Well, so does he.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.040]   It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:24.600]   All right, for the next 25 minutes or so,
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.120]   Dave Mustaine joins us.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.880]   Of course, he was on Jimmy Kimmel a few nights ago
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.040]   and brought down the house.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.440]   His new album kicked off November 1
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.720]   and has raced to the top of the charts across the board.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.080]   The new album is 13.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.320]   He has the single "Public Enemy" number one.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.240]   We opened up the start of the show with.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.760]   Coming up, before he leaves us, we'll
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.880]   play at least part of "We the People,"
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.080]   I think my favorite piece off of the new album.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.560]   We'll give you the websites and more.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.320]   Of course, it's been put out by Roadrunner Records.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.600]   Dave Mustaine joins us from his home in San Diego.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.440]   Dave, great to have you here with us again.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.940]   Thanks.
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.240]   Good to be here.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.040]   Wow, the Big Four, the biggest concert in the world right now.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.480]   I mean, am I wrong or is Megadeth turbocharged right now?
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.280]   Yeah, we're turbocharging it.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.080]   I mean, you guys are taking it up to the next level.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.520]   So much is going on.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.280]   What is on Dave Mustaine's mind right now?
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.520]   Well, we leave Monday for South America.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.640]   We've got Giganto coming up next year.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.640]   I've got this incredible new thing
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.840]   from a company called Rock Prodigy coming out.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.760]   It's a guitar application that basically I'm
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.920]   inside of your iPad or your iPhone
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.280]   teaching you how to play guitar.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.920]   It's going to be coming out next week.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.840]   And it's a public enemy in that.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.280]   A couple other really great Megadeth songs, "Holy Wars"
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.680]   and "Tornado of Souls 2" and stuff like that.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.080]   And then we're going to be heading over next year to Europe
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.680]   to make up what we missed out.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.680]   During the Big Four thing was so huge.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.040]   There was a lot of little things that got skipped in between
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.920]   that we like to play.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.880]   So we've got a lot of things we've got to make up.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.400]   Tell us about the Big Four.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.160]   Are we going to see more of that?
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.800]   I hope so.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.040]   I hope so.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.960]   That was totally unplanned.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.280]   Something that came out of the--
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:22.040]   just like my book, the success of that was mind-blowing too.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.320]   Having all these things happen is just really--
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.800]   it's foreign for me.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.120]   So having an opportunity to go and play again another Big Four
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.600]   show, yeah, of course we'd do it.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.280]   Problem is that the four outfits, all four of us
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.880]   are so thick that to get all four groups free
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.360]   in the same neck of the woods and able to do this,
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.640]   it's a big undertaking.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.240]   Well, it is.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.080]   I mean, you're trying to get four hugely successful
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.240]   pop metal bands together at the same time.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.000]   That's got to be rough when you guys are all in such demand
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.560]   across the world.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.400]   Looking at the numbers, I mean, Megadeth
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.720]   is probably my favorite rock band of all time.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.040]   But when you look at the entire genre,
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.280]   it seems that heavy metal itself is even more popular now
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.760]   outside of the United States.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.240]   Is that fair to say, Dave?
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.360]   You know, it's funny, Alex, because when
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.320]   terms are rough, people, they buckle down.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.520]   And heavy metal is, I believe, the anthem of people,
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.160]   the underdog and persevering.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.960]   A lot of the lyrics that we talk about
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.400]   has to do with fighting the good fight.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.400]   And a lot of the music has that turbocharged feeling
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.640]   you were talking about.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.200]   It gives us something to look forward to sometimes.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.480]   A lot of people work out the metal and stuff like that.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.000]   But especially politically, when we're in times
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.800]   like we are right now globally, in our own country,
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.400]   in some of our own cities, heavy metal is just--
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.160]   music, that's what people talk to it with,
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.280]   the feelings that everybody's experiencing right now.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.720]   Well, it is.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.360]   Getting into the album itself, what is your favorite track?
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.880]   If you had to pick one, and tell us
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.000]   about a few of the songs that are on the new album.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.880]   You know, I hate to sound cliche,
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.040]   but it changes from day to day.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.880]   Depending on what part of day two,
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.360]   sometimes I like listening to the really aggressive stuff
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.800]   in the morning when I'm working out.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.520]   And other times, the last thing I want to do
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.960]   is wake up and listen to something like "Never Dead,"
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.480]   because it's just, all right, let's go!
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.320]   (laughing)
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.960]   But for me, I think probably politically,
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.160]   the song, the people you were talking about,
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.360]   it's really, really touched home for me.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.720]   "13" is important, too.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.720]   That was pretty much, again, putting my life story
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.600]   into one song.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.160]   And it's so hard to do that.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.600]   I was looking at all the songs I wrote the other day,
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.200]   yesterday, actually, when we launched our new version
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.840]   of our website, called "Our New Record,"
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.840]   I looked at this long list of all the songs
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.800]   that I had written, and it was overwhelming to think
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.520]   each one of those is actually something I sat down
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.160]   and put pen to paper and had melodies and stuff like that,
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.800]   'cause you only think about your whole body of work
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.240]   when, if you're not concentrating on it,
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.560]   it just kind of goes past.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.440]   I mean, unless you're self-obsessed.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.840]   - Well, I noticed that you've got some of the same themes
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.160]   along the "Liberty" line that you've always discussed
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.160]   in the lyrics, but you've got titles like "We the People,"
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.920]   of course, the last album, "Endgame,"
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.520]   getting into global extermination
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.080]   and things beyond Megadeth.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.160]   But politically, right now, I mean,
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.840]   obviously there's a message in this record,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.800]   and I think that's why, out of the gates,
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.560]   it's gone to the top of the charts.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.960]   What's your view on Occupy Wall Street,
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.800]   all the things that are happening in the world right now,
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.280]   the microphones they're putting in streetlights?
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.880]   What's Dave Mustaine's view on that?
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.400]   - I didn't hear anything about the streetlights
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.280]   being outfitted with microphones until just yesterday,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.760]   so it doesn't surprise me.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.680]   I read "1984" when I was really young.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.480]   I also read "Animal Farm," which is,
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.760]   I'm sure somehow ties into our present also,
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.320]   but all of this stuff I've sang about for years,
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.600]   and I don't consider myself a prophet by any means.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   I read books and paid attention when I was supposed to,
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.720]   so a lot of the things I've learned
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.440]   and that I sing about is stuff we've all heard,
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.480]   stuff you hear in Sunday school,
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.840]   stuff that you hear growing up in public school
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.000]   or private school if you're so fortunate.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.680]   And I think that this record,
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.120]   when you look at all the stuff that I've written about it,
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.160]   I try and stay away from the political side,
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.520]   but it just happens.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.360]   You know, it's kind of like you bleed it.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.120]   You start writing it, and then all of a sudden,
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.440]   it goes from a love song into a political song.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.200]   - Well, there was a case that came out today
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.320]   where a guy went into Walmart with a baseball bat
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.280]   and told some old veteran they wanted money,
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.120]   and he wouldn't give it to them,
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.880]   so they beat him over the head.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.000]   I mean, I saw your quote on the Australian radio show
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.840]   where you talked about the fact
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.760]   that you'd never thought you'd see a president
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.240]   playing groups off against each other
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.200]   like is happening right now.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.320]   I mean, this is desperate class warfare,
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.280]   but then I see the White House
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.960]   and the Republicans to a great extent
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.200]   bought and paid for by the more corrupt elements
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.160]   of Wall Street that have gotten rich off bailout money.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.280]   I mean, we already pay a record amount of taxes.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.080]   When is this gonna end?
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.920]   - I don't know.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.560]   I mean, I have my own philosophy based on my faith,
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.200]   but that's personal to me,
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.760]   and I don't wanna get into it on the air
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.160]   'cause I'm sure there's a lot of listeners
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.120]   that don't agree with me,
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.680]   so I don't wanna piss anybody off.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.160]   But for me, I know how this will be at.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.720]   So I know I'm on the winning side,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.200]   so I'm cool with all that.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.280]   And even if I'm wrong,
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.640]   I'm definitely living better today than I was before
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.480]   I changed my approach towards faith.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.320]   I look at the statement that I made
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.280]   about this divisiveness that's happening.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.400]   It's really easy when you're the most powerful man
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.360]   in the world to say, "Enough.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.360]   "Guys, let's put an end to this."
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.360]   I don't understand for the life of me.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.680]   It's like the more I pay attention to politics,
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.960]   the more I don't wanna pay attention to it.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.960]   And the more it seems like Sarah Connor
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.160]   knew what she was doing.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.480]   (laughing)
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.480]   - Yeah, run to the hills.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.320]   Absolutely. - Yeah, you know,
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.160]   it's funny.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.360]   And the more that we talk to people on the street,
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.080]   the more people are preparing for
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.600]   some kind of, almost like a final battle or something.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.440]   It's really weird.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.240]   I mean, I'm not talking to a bunch of
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.920]   factions or anything like that,
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.720]   cults out here or anything like that.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.120]   Not by any means, but just talk to people
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.440]   that are scared.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.280]   They're scared.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.800]   - Well, people should be.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.920]   And when a hurricane's coming in
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.120]   days before it even forms or an earthquake,
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.440]   birds, mice, animals, they know something's coming.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.040]   Humans have that same discernment,
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.840]   sixth sense, whatever you wanna call it.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.160]   And government itself is digging in,
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.240]   is building bunkers.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.560]   And I saw an ABC News article last week
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.200]   about middle-class people now in mass
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   setting up doomsteads and things.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   Even though the government's saying everything's fine,
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.080]   we're not in a depression, go back to sleep,
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.880]   people instinctively or spiritually
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.520]   are gearing up for something.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.480]   And I know that I have never really geared up for stuff.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.000]   And now I've been doing it myself, Dave.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.080]   - Well, I think a lot of people used to rely on media
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.440]   for all of their information.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.120]   And now with the, even though the internet
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.200]   is full of a bunch of controversy
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   and it's rife with misinformation and disinformation,
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.040]   I know that it's also an outlet for a lot of people
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.120]   to be able to purvey the truth.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.120]   And people who, maybe not people that would know me at all,
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.160]   so Dave, I appreciate what I got to say.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.200]   - This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.640]   you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.800]   Number one, new climate legislation
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.960]   could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.920]   Number two, our new energy czar wants to control
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.720]   how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.600]   It's true, total government control of electricity
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.360]   in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.600]   Number three, in some areas of the country,
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.760]   the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.040]   And now new socialist legislation
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.680]   is only compounding the problem.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.160]   Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.200]   to local grids.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.520]   Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.920]   from weather-related outages.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.960]   Number five, a solar power generator
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.880]   provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.000]   Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.520]   offered by Solutions from Science,
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.920]   one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.120]   You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.840]   That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.120]   Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.120]   so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.680]   - Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.560]   I'm looking for people that have the wisdom
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.880]   to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.560]   Saving means to make money.

[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:04.160]   - Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.920]   in the last century alone.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.160]   This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.520]   - As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.080]   they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.400]   the Americans at home.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.440]   - I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress,
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.320]   and they really are calling the shots.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.160]   I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.520]   as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.800]   - For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.040]   the criminal offshore cartel,
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.200]   hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.640]   and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.040]   - Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.600]   They're asking for more matches,
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.840]   and the Congress is saying,
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.000]   who do we make the check out to?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.160]   - Today seems like nobody does care,
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.400]   and right now in Washington, DC,

[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.840]   (dramatic music)
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.640]   We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.880]   in the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.800]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:30.720]   - Why did you, I mean, we know why you picked
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.960]   the name of the last album, "Endgame."
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.720]   Why the iconography of 13,
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   and you've got the mega-death corporate skull man
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.040]   with the hear nothing, see nothing, say nothing,
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   three monkeys, but he's turned around
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.640]   staring into some type of abyss.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.040]   Can you break down your vision,
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.160]   because I know you always,
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.640]   you basically come up with the covers,
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.440]   the vision we're seeing here in this album cover
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.040]   for the new album, "13," by Megadeth.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.160]   - It's not that clever, really, Alex.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.280]   It's the 13th record in my career.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.120]   - Ah.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.840]   - I started playing when I was 13.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.000]   I was born on the 13th.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.200]   People think that the number 13's bad.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.120]   Well, it wasn't for me.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.800]   My life started on that day,
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   and I know that the association with the superstition
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.640]   and the bad side of 13 had to do with the Templar Knights
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.920]   or something like that.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.640]   - Yeah, that's when the Catholic Church
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.920]   rounded them up and killed a bunch of them.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.800]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.640]   - Yeah, so, I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.840]   I know that 13 shows up all over the place,
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.400]   and it's funny how much now, even more so,
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.120]   that we've used this number.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.720]   It's like when your old lady gets pregnant.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.520]   All of a sudden, you see pregnant women everywhere,
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.040]   or you buy a Volkswagen,
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.360]   and you realize everybody's got the same color Volkswagen.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.920]   You know, as soon as I leaned on 13,
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.120]   it all of a sudden started popping up everywhere,
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.920]   and then the actual logo itself with the word 13
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.160]   and the number 13 inside of it,
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.360]   that was our artist, John Rizzi, who came up with that.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.080]   When I first saw that, I went, wow, that's really clever.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.800]   - Now, Dave, we've only got about 10 minutes
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.640]   left with you here, and I appreciate your time.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.520]   I know you've been talking a ton and singing,
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.560]   and you're about to go on the road,
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.680]   and I don't wanna burn you out here,
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.480]   but there's so many questions I wanna go over.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.240]   Hopefully, you will come back with us,
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.880]   maybe even in studio here in Austin in the next few months
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.280]   when you get back from your South America tour.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.520]   - Yeah, that would be fun.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.240]   - Well, it was great actually seeing you up there
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.080]   in person in Dallas.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.400]   I guess a year and a half ago, "How Time Flies."
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.280]   - Oh, yeah, that was a long time ago.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.560]   - I think because of time constraints,
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.840]   after you leave us, I'm gonna come back
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.120]   and actually play my favorite new tune on the album,
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.600]   "We the People," but specifically,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.680]   what are you talking about here?
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.920]   I mean, the lyrics speak for themselves,
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.080]   but what are you saying in "We the People"?
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.960]   - Wow, I think it's, I'm saying what everybody's
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.160]   saying right now, that they're pissed.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.000]   What happened to all the things
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   that our grandparents worked for and set up?
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.800]   I mean, you watch the dollar plummet,
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.000]   you see Social Security and all of these benefits
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.440]   that people have taken away.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.280]   You watch these corrupt bankers take people's life savings
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.160]   and it disappears into a vapor,
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.360]   and then you have people like Madoff saying
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.880]   that he's happier he's in jail
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.920]   and that people look up to him there.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.600]   Well, I mean, the only difference between him
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.280]   is that the criminals are wearing jump suits
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.720]   instead of three-piece suits.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.680]   It's all the same, and to think about all these people
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.160]   whose lives have changed forever because of this,
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.000]   the people who are defenseless,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.080]   that's the thing that pisses me off.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.120]   And while we were watching everything that was going on
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:57.120]   with just the, I don't even know the word that I wanna say,
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.120]   but just the immovability of the people in Congress
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.200]   and the people in the Senate and the White House,
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.920]   it's all frozen right now.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.400]   And it's just, it's mind-boggling.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.720]   Somebody has to do something.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.200]   There's got to be an American up there somewhere.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.320]   - There's got to be.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.640]   Looking at the Euro crisis that we predicted
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.720]   and the Obama deception, engineered implosion,
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.600]   and now they're setting up a banking dictatorship.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.840]   And did you see it last week
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.800]   when the Pope called for global government?
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.640]   - Yeah, I did.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.840]   I saw that for the global currency too, yeah.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.600]   - Wow, I mean, how could you at 20 years old,
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.000]   I mean, I remember 25, 30 years ago,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.840]   listening to your stuff before you were even in Metallica,
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.760]   because I was, I mean, I had neighbors that were all
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.920]   into speed metal, thrash metal.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.280]   I was like nine years old, I'm only 37.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.120]   How were you writing about things like this?
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.520]   Because I mean, people ask how I was politically formed.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.800]   Some of it was listening to Megadeth.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.160]   (laughing)
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.760]   I think, I think.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.600]   - Look what you've done, Dave.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.120]   - Yeah. - Frankenstein.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.560]   - You know, the great thing about helping people
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.000]   unleash their, and then become free thinkers,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.600]   is that the world's a fascinating place,
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.080]   and that we're so capable of doing so much good.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.680]   And sometimes people don't agree with us,
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.400]   and they can mistake what we do.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.600]   You know, sometimes the enemy is great.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.360]   But you know, for me, doing this kind of music,
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.880]   singing these kind of songs, having these kind of lyrics,
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.840]   I guess in some way I'm just doing my part, I believe,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.640]   to make the world a better place,
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.960]   through heavy metal music, even though that sounds,
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.880]   you know, like you should be having some kind of
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.720]   a nursery rhyme in the background or something,
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.480]   or some circus music or something.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.600]   You know, it's true.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.440]   I don't know how to play another type of music.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.240]   This is what I was given, and it's what I love.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.560]   And being able to educate people is great.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.640]   I mean, I know you know when you've talked to one,
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.200]   your listeners, or you've met somebody out on the road,
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.640]   and they get that aha moment where their eyes just dilate,
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.880]   and all of a sudden they're like, "I get it."
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.400]   I love that feeling.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.440]   - Now that's the real magic in the world.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.560]   You know, they say the root of all evil is money.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.760]   No, it's not.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.520]   This world system gets people to sell out
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.080]   for money they create out of nothing.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.920]   What the system's really after
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.880]   is trafficking in the souls of men.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.400]   This ruling Illuminati system, from my deep research,
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.360]   is interested in our minds and our souls.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.160]   It wants to program us.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.400]   What's your take on that statement, Dave?
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.840]   - Well, going back, that scripture actually,
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.440]   the love of money is the root of all evil.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.600]   - Yes, yes.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.440]   - So it's kind of incomplete.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.680]   As far as the Illuminati and the elite
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.760]   and everything like that, it's, you know,
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.480]   it's right in, it's hidden in plain sight.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.080]   You know, all of the maneuvering that's going on.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.040]   And, you know, all anybody has to do,
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.480]   if they're curious, is look.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.480]   You know, when you saw, you know,
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.720]   people talking about the New World Order,
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.120]   and the reason the New World Order's on this new record
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.440]   was because when I sang about it, you know, 12 years ago,
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   it was the demo song, and it never got released officially.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.000]   And because of the content in the song,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.240]   I had to sing that song on this new record.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.320]   So New World Order's on 13.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.080]   And, you know, watching that stuff happen
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.680]   as a little kid and having people say,
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.400]   oh, one day, you know, there's gonna be
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.040]   the cataclysmic end to the world,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.640]   and it's gonna happen when you see all this stuff
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.480]   going on in Israel and in the Middle East,
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.360]   and all this stuff where everybody can agree
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.880]   and have one dollar and one church and one Boston.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.200]   It's like, wow, is that possible?
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.200]   And now you see it, they're even talking about it.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.040]   Who would have even imagined talking about that?
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.600]   - Who would imagine the Pope coming out
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.000]   and saying one world currency,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.080]   global government, bank of the world,
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.920]   and, well, it was the official church organ put that out.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.320]   I mean, that is just incredible, Dave.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.960]   - Yeah, yeah, well, like I said,
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.240]   you know, this is a very incredible world we live in,
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.120]   and we have a lot of power.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.840]   People can rise up and say no.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.200]   - Well, look at the testament
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.760]   to how many people you've reached.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.880]   And again, that's God's plan.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.160]   Different people hit different sectors of society,
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.680]   and your whole life has been a journey
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.920]   to bring you to where you are now.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.120]   I know there's a lot more ahead,
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.760]   hopefully, from Dave Mustaine and Megadeth.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.960]   Folks can go to Megadeth with an E in the death,
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.720]   megadeth.com, or just type in Dave Mustaine
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.160]   or Megadeth into your search engine,
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.960]   and the first thing it'll lead you to their site.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.600]   You can get the book, "Mustaine, A Life in Metal."
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.320]   Dave, I wanna have you back after you're done touring
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.920]   for a full hour on the book.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.980]   I've actually ordered a copy.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.560]   I'm gonna read it, and I'm really enjoying the new album.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.800]   I think it's even better than "Endgame."
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.880]   And I thought "Endgame" was extremely powerful,
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.880]   especially the lyrics.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.880]   But man, this new album feels like vintage Megadeth,
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.040]   but with something even better added to it.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:03.800]   - A very wealthy US citizen is predicting
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.120]   that in 2011, we will witness the most important day
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.400]   in America in more than 50 years.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.960]   He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.680]   The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.320]   and even how you take care of your health
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.320]   and your own family.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.560]   Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.400]   over the years.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.680]   The crazy part is he's usually right.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.040]   You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.600]   Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner,
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.880]   General Growth Properties.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.280]   In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.840]   Recently, he created a video,
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.440]   which you can watch online for free,
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.080]   detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.640]   And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.000]   I can't stress this enough.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.720]   You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.360]   He explains everything you need to know,
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.920]   including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.560]   You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.

[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.720]   Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.560]   I'm looking for people that have the wisdom
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.920]   to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.600]   Saving means to make money.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.240]   The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.320]   of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.560]   that are triple concentrated and twice as good
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.000]   as what you're using now.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.840]   Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.600]   that contain no useless dyes, perfumes,
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.640]   deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.880]   Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.360]   that give you rashes, itching sores,
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.640]   and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.800]   If you want something better,
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   if you want something you've never had before,
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.880]   you have to do something you've never done before,
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:45.800]   getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091

[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:03.920]   Alex Jones here with vital information
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.480]   concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.200]   Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.000]   and I think it's important for my listeners
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.960]   to do three things right away.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.240]   Number one, study the past.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.600]   History really does repeat itself.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.480]   Number two, learn to spot
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.480]   the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.560]   Number three, take decisive action.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.440]   A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.040]   That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book,
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.400]   "Rising Prices, Empty Shelves,
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.480]   Warning Signs That Trigger the Deadliest Famines in History."
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.880]   Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.400]   This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.960]   You'll also get a free copy of "Supermarket Survival,
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.240]   How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half."
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.920]   Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.920]   That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.720]   - You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.400]   infuses the respiratory system
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.200]   with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.120]   yet many are unaware of the entire function
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.400]   of the silver lung system and how it has been designed
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.520]   to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.120]   My name is Mario Cifaldi,
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.200]   and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.640]   Not only does the silver lung system
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.880]   produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.200]   it also comes equipped with the proper applicators
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.240]   and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.000]   directly to key target areas.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.200]   This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs,
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.000]   topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.120]   Be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:49.120]   of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.320]   to learn more about how the silver lung system works.

[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.320]   any questions you may have.

[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.760]   - Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.440]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.680]   - From his Central Texas command center,
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.120]   deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.480]   It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:29.560]   - Well, there's a lot of disinformation out there about him.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.440]   I've met him in person several times
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:37.440]   and found him to be a very genteel, nice person.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.240]   I didn't get any bad vibes from him,
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.840]   and I know that that's always the real signal.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.240]   And I've been selling his book now for many years,
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.760]   "Bloodlines of the Illuminati," Fritz Springmeier.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.720]   One of the only places you can actually get it
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.240]   is at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.560]   And when I first read this a decade ago or so,
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.880]   I'm gonna be frank with you.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.480]   I'd met Fritz when he was here in Austin on local TV,
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.920]   about the station,
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.320]   and met him at another conference event once.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.400]   And I believed he believed a lot of it,
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:13.000]   but I, even though I snuck into Bohemian Grove and things,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.800]   and I first met him right after I snuck in there,
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.240]   I still had trouble believing it.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.960]   Since then, so much, he was the first guy I heard
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.800]   talking about the royal family of England,
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.320]   not really being German, but being from Transylvania.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.480]   And then, really being Arabic and all this stuff,
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.120]   or Sephardic.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:37.120]   And then, now that's on national news now.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.800]   So just a lot of really wild, wild stuff.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.880]   And then over the years, so much of it,
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.440]   no matter how wild, has turned out to be true.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.920]   Now, imagine Fritz.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.560]   He had, I don't know how many books out,
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.480]   everywhere he went, selling tons of them.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.640]   I know we were selling a lot.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.720]   I happen to know the publisher.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.920]   I knew they were selling them.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:59.920]   He would have no reason to bomb a porno store or whatever,
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.360]   and then rob a bank.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.560]   And I remember him saying, "They're breaking in my house.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.000]   "They're trying to set me up."
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.200]   I remember seeing it in the news.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.880]   They'd been raiding him and stuff.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.640]   And then, boom, they grabbed him, put him in jail.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:16.640]   Now, remember, the government has a 99, 98% conviction rate
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.880]   with the feds.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.960]   And he's on probation.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.440]   He's been in jail for many years.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.800]   He's lost a lot of weight.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.280]   I just saw him on Skype a minute ago.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.280]   He looks better than he did just a few weeks ago.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.200]   In the one video I've seen of a little presentation he did,
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.960]   he'll be back again.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.200]   But we gotta be careful how much he gets into today.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.120]   But he's agreed, what he wants to talk about
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:42.000]   is who he really is versus the lies of places like Wikipedia
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.960]   and what happened to him, what he can say about prison,
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.240]   and where he sees the world,
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.040]   what, seven, eight years after being incarcerated.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.480]   But they can do this to anybody.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.840]   They can plant drugs on yours truly
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.720]   or put horrible things on my computer
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.480]   or, God forbid, kill my family and say I did it.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.160]   I mean, this is the kind of stuff
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.640]   the globalists have been caught doing.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.960]   Operation Northwoods talks about how to frame Americans
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.580]   for bombings that the Pentagon carries out.
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:11.760]   And frame-ups are legend.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.480]   Now, with DNA, we know about a third of people
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.060]   on death row are innocent.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.840]   And we learn, it was a case in Texas a few weeks ago
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.760]   where the prosecutor for 20 years
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.600]   knew the person was innocent and knew who did it,
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.520]   but didn't care.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.320]   It was about their career.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.000]   They'll even put people with no criminal record
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.320]   like Fritz in jail.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.800]   You know, usually they like to set somebody
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.680]   who's already got a record, like people believe it.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.680]   Very, very frightening.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.120]   And so Fritz Springmeier joins us via video Skype.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:43.200]   Fritz, for people that don't know who you are,
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.560]   you know, a lot of people that have been into the conspiracy,
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.120]   into reality, they of course know who you are.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.440]   Over the years, I've said, you know,
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.560]   they said, where's Fritz Springmeier?
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.400]   Where's Fritz Springmeier?
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.600]   Where's Fritz Springmeier?
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.960]   They're, why don't you get his wife on?
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.840]   We've tried, as you know, many times to get her on.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.080]   She obviously couldn't
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.140]   'cause she didn't want him to do stuff to you in jail.
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:02.360]   Now you've been out a while, but obviously, you know,
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.360]   even for Ricky Ross, who started speaking out
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.480]   against government drug dealing,
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.360]   now they're trying to throw him back in jail.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.360]   So I want you to be very careful here today.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.640]   We appreciate you giving us the first big interview
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.560]   that I know of.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.560]   Correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.760]   Good to have you here, Fritz.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.320]   Tell us who you are, a brief snapshot of your life.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.200]   You know, I know they said you weren't
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.240]   a West Point graduate.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.560]   I actually went and looked it up in their rolls.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.960]   There's your photo, there you are.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.120]   But the point is, they've really attacked you.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.940]   You hit some things that really scared them.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.560]   Was it the Transylvanian bloodline?
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.540]   Is it the satanic rituals?
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.740]   I mean, why did they come, get into who you are,
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.880]   what happened in prison, why they came after you, you think,
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.400]   and now what you see in the world?
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.040]   Wow, that's a lot of questions.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.360]   (laughing)
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.400]   Okay, let's see what we can do with them.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.240]   First, who am I?
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:58.760]   From, for myself, the image I have is
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.920]   as someone who's trying to model Christ.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:07.440]   He's my role model, and that's all that really matters
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.200]   about my life is that I be Christ-like.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.200]   All the labels that the system tries to,
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:19.720]   the system is labeling people right now,
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.920]   and their computer programs carry these labels.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.100]   Like, for instance, two-thirds of the blacks
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:30.080]   in major cities are labeled as affiliates of gangs
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.000]   or gang members, you know?
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.720]   And so there's all kinds of labels
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.040]   that have been slapped on me, but the only label
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.880]   that I would want to be identified with
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.240]   is somebody who's trying to follow Christ.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.240]   My life's been unusual.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:49.760]   My father had the goal of helping save the world.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:54.760]   He was an agricultural expert, and he went around the world,
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.040]   living in many, many third-world countries,
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.960]   and trying to help them become self-sufficient.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.640]   He made a career out of that.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.520]   And he passed on the concept of trying
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.000]   to save the world to me.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.160]   He said that if you're gonna live life,
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.040]   when you leave it, leave the world a better place
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.360]   than what you found it.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.240]   You know, sort of like that Boy Scout thing
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.960]   is when you go camping, leave the site better
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.440]   than what you found it.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.440]   And I think I have honestly tried to do that
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:33.600]   and accomplish that to some degree.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.800]   Why were they kicked off at me?
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.560]   I think it was a combination of a whole bunch of things
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.520]   that I did, but one of the things
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.000]   that they were really sensitive about
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.520]   was the mind control, the trauma-based mind control.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.000]   You'll notice that I put out three books on it
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.640]   with about 40 pages of the actual codes
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.760]   that they use on the slaves.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.000]   And once you have read those books
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.200]   and you're familiar with the codes,
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.800]   you can sit there and watch television
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.440]   and see them manipulate these total mind-controlled slaves
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.520]   left and right all around us.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.800]   And people are constantly telling me
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.360]   that after they got in touch with my information,
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.840]   now they realize what's going on around them.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.640]   Another thing as far as-
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.480]   - Yeah, that's the book,
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.840]   "How to Create a Totally Undetectable Mind-Control Slave,"
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.120]   which now they admit everything on TV
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.880]   is layers of programming depending on how programmed you are
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.280]   and just someone watching TV since they were a small child,
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.400]   they are under a form of mind control.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.280]   And actually, scientifically, even BBC admits
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.560]   in a lower brainwave function than we were just 50 years ago,
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.000]   the public in general is in a trance.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.360]   - Yes, people sit in front of their televisions in a trance.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:02.040]   In a sense, they're almost worshiping that altar there,
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.680]   their television altar.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.120]   - So true what you just said.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.360]   And of course, your listeners have heard a lot of this.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.360]   So, I'm not telling them probably anything
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.480]   that they're not already familiar with.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.560]   Let's see. - Yeah, but you were
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.400]   a trailblazer.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.480]   How did you discover all that?
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.200]   So that made them really angry at you.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:29.360]   - Yes, I kind of bumped into the whole thing.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.360]   I view myself as a historian, not as a conspiracy theorist.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:39.600]   And I was doing a massive amount of research into the elite
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:45.440]   because we are now a government of the power elite,
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.200]   by the power elite and for the power elite.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.680]   And I was researching them to expose them.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   And I had the privilege of meeting four people
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.920]   that had been teamed up in the Illuminati
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.880]   to be a four-person team that were trying to get out.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.360]   And they pointed me in the right direction
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.680]   on a lot of things.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.480]   I had to do most of the research myself,
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.440]   but because they pointed me in the right direction,
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.600]   it really helped me.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:21.080]   And then that's how I got into the mind control.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.200]   - By the way, just a segue,
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.760]   I ran into a famous person a few weeks ago
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.520]   and had dinner with them.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.560]   And they point blank told me about Illuminati rituals
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.360]   and Hellfire Club and stuff,
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.320]   but then said, "I'm not gonna talk about that on your show,
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.560]   "maybe sometime."
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.840]   So the point is we know these things existed and do exist,
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.400]   but I mean, you're sitting there having dinner
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.480]   with a well-known famous person
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.000]   and they're just point blank telling you all about it.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.280]   It's just incredible.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.120]   And to find out that most of the people
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.440]   that are part of Oxford in any of the elite clubs

[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.320]   - The United States is now recognized globally
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.440]   as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.840]   This film conclusively proves the existence
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.920]   of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.080]   now being expanded nationwide.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.520]   This documentary exposes how the continuity
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.200]   of government program has established

[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:03.560]   - Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.440]   I'm looking for people that have the wisdom
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:08.760]   to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.480]   Saving means to make money.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.120]   The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.200]   of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.440]   that are triple concentrated and twice as good
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.840]   as what you're using now.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.680]   Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.440]   that contain no useless dyes, perfumes,
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.480]   deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.720]   Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.200]   that give you rashes, itching sores,
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.480]   and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:36.640]   If you want something better,
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.600]   if you want something you've never had before,
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.720]   you have to do something you've never done before,
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.440]   getting a free catalog is easy

[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:05.800]   - Coast to coast, direct from Austin,
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:09.440]   you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.280]   Network.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:14.600]   (siren blaring)
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:41.320]   - We're going back to Fred Springmeyer here
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.360]   in just a minute, and I haven't asked him yet,
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.040]   but we're probably getting set up for Thursday as well
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.480]   during the 27-hour live.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.680]   I say 27, 'cause it's not really 24.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.320]   When my show starts over at 11 a.m. Friday,
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.240]   I'll then do that show as well.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:00.680]   So just an amazing guest, multiple guests,
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.960]   you know, every hour or so.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.720]   Some guests like Celente will be more than an hour.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.360]   It's gonna be power-packed,
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.640]   the fourth annual 2011 Money Bomb.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.200]   So check that out at infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.840]   Make sure donating now if you want.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.480]   We normally raise about $100,000
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.800]   by the time it kicks off.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.000]   500,000 is our goal, so we can hire a couple more IT people,
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.280]   get some other sites launched.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.280]   We wanna get launched a couple new reporters
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.520]   and a bunch of equipment we've gotta get,
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.680]   just a lot of things like that.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.840]   And that's why we built this organization.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:33.720]   And it takes a lot of devalued dollars to get the job done.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.640]   So infowarsmoneybomb.com,
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.800]   and also when you buy books and videos and tapes
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.480]   and things like "Bloodlines of the Illuminati,"
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.760]   you not only support our operation at the online bookstore,
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.680]   but you support the writers and researchers
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.080]   like Fritz Springmeier, political prisoner.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.600]   Also, 'cause they're in here telling me to plug this,
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   I think Cade actually designed this,
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.840]   one of our graphics people.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.680]   I love it.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:59.720]   It says, "Ideas are bulletproof, we the people."
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.600]   And then it's got Article I inside the seal
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.720]   to the First Amendment.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.680]   "Ideas are bulletproof, we the people."
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.800]   People say, "What does that mean?"
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.120]   Well, the First Amendment.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.440]   And on the back, infowars.com,
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.720]   a really original designer t-shirt
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.120]   available at infowars.com.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.280]   And we couldn't have done any of this
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.760]   without all of you out there supporting the transmission.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:26.120]   Also, in closing, with the plug here, don't forget,
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.920]   because the guys were asking, "Will we do this forever?"
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.400]   And I doubt it.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.720]   I think it's gonna be a seasonal thing,
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.280]   'cause we have another special we like to run
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.360]   where you sign up for a year,
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.040]   you can get five and a half months free.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.800]   It basically comes out to get almost half a year free
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.120]   when you sign up for that thing
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.480]   we always do around Christmas.
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:44.520]   But right now we're running a 15-day free trial.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.080]   15-day free trial.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.960]   I think it'll probably, I haven't decided yet,
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.360]   but it's gonna run at least into part of November.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.480]   15-day free trial, prisonplanet.tv,
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.880]   the nightly news, all my films, my book,
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.040]   Paul Watson's book,
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.360]   the high-quality commercial-free podcast,
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.440]   all of our stuff going back almost nine years,
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.080]   prisonplanet.tv, 5.95 a month.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.840]   But right now it's free, prisonplanet.tv,
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.800]   so easy to sign up there.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.480]   Now, going back to political prisoner, Fritz Springmeier.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.960]   You were talking about, "Hey, I've been on the other side,
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.680]   was it seven or eight years?"
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:20.680]   And you need to know what it's like,
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.720]   'cause a lot of you are probably
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.040]   gonna be going there as well.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.240]   We have the biggest prison population in the world.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.160]   They're setting up a martial law internal checkpoint grid
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.760]   with federal goon forces.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.480]   They're training neighbors to spy on each other,
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.760]   jumbotrons saying, "Don't trust your neighbor."
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:39.120]   It's like a dystopic film, sci-fi horror movie.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.640]   1984 meets Stephen King's "The Running Man,"
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.840]   meets "Brave New World,"
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:48.200]   meets "The Island of Dr. Maru."
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.160]   So please continue, Fritz Springmeier.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:55.640]   - Yes, pulling together several of your questions,
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:59.800]   it would be appropriate to talk about prison.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.440]   One of the benefits,
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:06.440]   one of the good things that my father had taught me
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.000]   was to think for myself.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.160]   And so as a teenager,
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:12.480]   I knew that at some point I was going to bump
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.560]   into the system.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:17.560]   There was a little plaque I put up on my door.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.040]   It said, "When freedom fails,
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.520]   good men rot in filthy jails."
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.480]   And I told my sister, I said,
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.160]   "Because I think for myself,
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:29.280]   and I'm willing to do things about what I see,
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.000]   at some point I'm going to end up in prison."
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.560]   I knew that I was just going to bump heads
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.200]   with this established system at some point in my life,
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.720]   and eventually it happened.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.320]   Wisdom is knowing what to do.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.360]   Skill is knowing how to do it.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.920]   And virtue is actually doing it.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.520]   And some of your listeners out there
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.520]   are actually going to have the virtue
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.080]   of getting out there and doing things.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.400]   And when they do, you know,
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.480]   when freedom fails,
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.600]   the best men rot in filthy jails.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:04.320]   That's where a lot of them eventually will end up.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.960]   So what happens when you go to a prison or jail?
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.120]   Well, two things, two things.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.400]   One is, is you're going to suffer loss.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.720]   And the other one is, is you're going to wait.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.760]   And you'll be lucky if you don't lose everything.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.840]   (laughs)
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.920]   And how long you wait, you don't know,
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.400]   because generally when you first get incarcerated,
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.320]   they don't tell you how long you're going to be in there
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.840]   and you haven't been sentenced.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.040]   So as far as you know,
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.880]   you could be in there the rest of your life or die in there.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:41.880]   So even a week in a jail can seem like a very long time.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:47.680]   So that's what I would forewarn people about,
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.400]   because a lot of people, when they get into jail,
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.360]   they start stressing that they're losing stuff.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.480]   And they start stressing that they don't know
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:58.200]   how much time they're going to be incarcerated.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.720]   Let it go.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.800]   It is what it is.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.200]   And make the best of it and accept it.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   The best thing that can happen to get you through the time
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:13.000]   is to accept the reality that you've been incarcerated
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.680]   and start making the best of it.
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:18.760]   If you mentally fight the thing,
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   you just go through proxisms of torture.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.320]   Accept what's happened and then move on in life
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.760]   and make the best of it.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.920]   And that's what we have to do.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.640]   We have to take the good with the bad
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.680]   and make the best of it,
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.000]   like you've been trying to do with your show.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:42.640]   I really love a lot of the things that you've done.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.160]   I like your t-shirts that you're advertising,
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:48.040]   'cause I think part of the solution
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.920]   is we've got to laugh.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   I mean, you've got tyranny, legalized freedom t-shirt.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:00.640]   That's humorous.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:03.400]   That's part of the answer.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:09.600]   I hope your listeners out there buy these kinds of things
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:13.960]   and walk around and get some chuckles.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.720]   - Well, I think what you're getting at here
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.680]   is don't let it crush your spirit
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.880]   and use it as a learning experience
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:24.240]   and feel sorry for the people that are in there
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:28.280]   feeding you GMO and soy-based food
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.960]   and enjoying your pain
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:34.960]   because they are hurting themselves, hurting their soul,
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:39.280]   literally tying heavy weights and chains around themselves
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.400]   in God's eyes and really waiting themselves down
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.400]   for the drop into Hades.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.000]   But it's one thing to imagine it.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.080]   You have lived through it, French.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.120]   You lost a lot of weight.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.040]   Why is that?
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:57.440]   - Well, halfway through my bit, I started exercising
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:03.400]   and it was intentional to lose the weight.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.200]   I'm healthier.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:08.720]   I've been exercising for the last five years
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.400]   on a regular basis.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.960]   So I'm actually healthier than when I went in.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:17.440]   That's one of the advantages.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.640]   Like I say, I took the time that I had to do
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:25.400]   and I used it for good.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:29.120]   While I was in there, I spent five years teaching GED.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:33.640]   I got high school GED diplomas for a lot of the guys.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:37.360]   I was using my time productively.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.960]   And that's one of the things
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.640]   that I wanna encourage people to do
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.880]   is we've just gotta take the cards that we've been dealt
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.400]   and do the best we can with them.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.400]   And of course, they're trying to deal us
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.440]   the worst cards that they can,
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.800]   but hey, it's not over until the fat lady
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.120]   in God's choir sings.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:05.160]   - Well said, no, no, please continue.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:11.600]   - Well, I think you and some of the other guys
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.640]   and some of the other people out there
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.520]   that are doing what you're doing
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:21.520]   are examples of what needs to be done.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:26.440]   And that is, you're trying to make people self-sufficient,
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.360]   get people to think for themselves,
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.240]   get people to quit being a sheeple
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.040]   and think for themselves.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:39.080]   And if we can win the hearts of the people,
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.600]   their minds and bodies will follow along.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:47.680]   - Do you forgive the people that lied about you
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.000]   and persecuted you and put you in jail for,
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.440]   how many years was it, Fritz?
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:56.600]   - Well, I was given a 111 month sentence
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.880]   and I did eight years actual time.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:04.720]   And then about a year ago, I was released.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:08.680]   I was out for three months
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.240]   and then for no reason,
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.240]   at least they never gave me any specific reason,
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:18.560]   they just rearrested me and held me on a marshal's hold
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:21.840]   under investigation for another two and a half months
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.120]   and never charged me with anything.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.400]   Like I say, never gave me a specific reason
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.920]   as to why they put me back into prison.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.680]   And then they released me towards the end of March.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.840]   So now I've been out for what,
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:39.080]   approximately seven months this last time.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.840]   (dramatic music)
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:53.000]   - Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.200]   This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.640]   you should consider buying a solar powered generator.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.640]   Number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.960]   or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.880]   Number two, our new energy czar wants to control
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.720]   how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.600]   It's true, total government control of electricity
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.320]   in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.600]   Number three, in some areas of the country,
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.720]   the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.040]   and now new socialist legislation
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:19.640]   is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:22.160]   Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.200]   to local grids.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.520]   Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.920]   from weather related outages.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.960]   Number five, a solar power generator
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:31.880]   provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.980]   Folks, I really believe in the solar powered generators
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.520]   offered by Solutions from Science,
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:36.920]   one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:41.080]   You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.840]   That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:45.120]   Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:50.120]   So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:55.880]   - Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:59.520]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:04.160]   (dramatic music)
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:10.920]   - Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.480]   You want answers?
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.040]   Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:18.200]   He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.640]   And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.120]   - Well, for the next hour,
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.920]   we're joined by Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.280]   He's not doing any media right now,
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.960]   so we're extra lucky to have him with us for the next hour.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.500]   We're gonna get into the TSA.
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.400]   Where's this case going on that front?
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.440]   Can't get into much of it though,
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.420]   'cause the judge hadn't ruled yet.
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.200]   We're gonna get into the open calls here.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.740]   Israel does say they're getting ready to strike Iran.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:46.780]   I got that headline here.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.820]   We're gonna get into a host of issues
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.640]   with Jesse Ventura here today.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.960]   Gov, great to have you with us.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.640]   - Thanks, Alex, always a pleasure to be here.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.520]   - Well, I tell you, so much is happening,
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.440]   but let's talk about the TV show first.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.840]   How's that going?
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:05.840]   - Well, it's going well.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.920]   You know, we had to change it a bit this year.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.160]   We've got some new personnel on board,
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.320]   and of course, that ties into my lawsuit with the TSA,
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.880]   so I can't fly anymore, or at the moment, I can't fly.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.840]   And so anywhere I go, I have to drive.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.960]   And so that limits the ability I have
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.760]   to get around the country, naturally.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:31.080]   So I have to do it in segments where I'll take off,
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.880]   like the last one where you and I saw each other.
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.080]   That was a two-week run for me, you know,
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.960]   in my RV, driving around the country.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.080]   It's rough, it's very tiring, you know?
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.360]   It's a lot of fun, but it's also very difficult,
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.640]   and you don't realize how convenient the world is
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:49.920]   with the airlines today,
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.720]   until you gotta get back driving again.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.640]   But I gotta tell you something, in all honesty, Alex.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.760]   I don't miss the airports, because I so despise
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.800]   the fact that I have, that if there's somewhere
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.600]   in this country, that if I go there,
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.640]   I'm treated completely like a criminal.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.400]   And so, you know, and in fact, one of the guests
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.440]   on my shows, it was interesting, an elderly gentleman
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.280]   that used to work at NASA and was involved
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.120]   in various high-level government projects,
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.880]   including Star Wars and things of that nature.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.000]   He had to interview with me in Vegas,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.960]   because he lives in Salt Lake, and it was too far
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.000]   for him to drive from Salt Lake to Minneapolis.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.840]   And the interesting thing is, he's following my lead.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.200]   He refuses to fly also.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.160]   You know, he said, for the same reason, he said,
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.880]   in the United States of America, I do not believe
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.800]   that I should go anywhere where I'm treated like a criminal.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.400]   And you are today at the airport,
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.360]   you're treated like criminals.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.360]   - Well, I've talked to bus drivers,
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.080]   and I've talked to truck drivers and others,
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.840]   and I went and looked the numbers up a few months ago
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.080]   when I was first told this.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.640]   Did you know that people on buses,
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.200]   in just the last five years, has more than doubled?
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.640]   And now you see passenger buses everywhere,
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.120]   it's become a booming business.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.640]   And when people are surveyed, it's because of the TSA.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.520]   They do not wanna be groped.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.320]   - Well, it's the whole concept of it, Alex.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.240]   It's a place where, in a free country,
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.640]   if you wanna learn what it's like
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.720]   to be put under martial law, go to the airport.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.920]   Because that'll give you an exact feeling
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:22.000]   of being put under government complete surveillance.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.200]   You're patted down and you're searched, you're x-rayed.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.600]   There's nothing you can do out there, basically,
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.560]   that you don't fall under some type of government,
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.640]   you know, oppression, for lack of better words.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.480]   So it's a place where people should go and learn from it.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.520]   Because the more they give up their freedoms,
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.960]   the more our country is going to turn into that.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.600]   And so I urge people, go to the airports
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.360]   and notice how they run and notice everything that goes on
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.720]   and notice the government control
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.320]   and the whole thing about it.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.720]   Because the more we give up our freedoms,
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.920]   the more we will be living under that type of jurisdiction.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.640]   - Well, you're right, Tim.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.600]   And I guess you're getting at the point
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.880]   that it acclimates everybody.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.320]   It sets the parameters for this to be normalized behavior.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.400]   - Well, it's a cancer, Alex.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.200]   It's just like toll roads on highways.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.800]   The minute you put the first toll road on a highway,
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.760]   it spreads like cancer.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.960]   Because then anytime government needs money,
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.360]   they're gonna put a toll on a road.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.560]   And this is the same thing.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.120]   When governments start eroding your freedoms away,
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.720]   they're gonna do it in a slow manner.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.280]   But it's like a slow spreading cancer.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.320]   It'll start with the airports,
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.200]   and then it's gonna move on to other things.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.640]   Once they're secured down,
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.360]   then you're gonna see more and more.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.480]   I mean, when I drive across country now,
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.680]   I have to, down in Southwestern United States,
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.840]   you have to come to immigration halts
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.000]   out in the middle of the desert.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.800]   - Stay there, stay there, Gov.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.640]   Gov, we gotta go to break.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.880]   Let's come back and get back into the TSA,
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.800]   the domestic checkpoints, the border patrol,
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.520]   all of it straight ahead with Jesse Vandurum.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:04.240]   - A wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011,
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.880]   we will witness the most important day in America
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.320]   in more than 50 years.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.920]   He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.640]   The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.240]   and even how you take care of your health
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.240]   and your own family.
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.480]   Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.320]   over the years.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.600]   The crazy part is he's usually right.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.960]   You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.160]   Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.800]   and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.240]   In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.800]   Recently, he created a video,
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.360]   which you can watch online for free,
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.000]   detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.560]   And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.960]   I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.640]   You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.280]   He explains everything you need to know,
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.880]   including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.520]   You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.080]   That's end of America, the number three dot com.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.960]   Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.840]   That's end of america3.com.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:07.400]   - From his brother, mainstream media.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.720]   - The story continues.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.080]   It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.280]   - We are live.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.440]   It is, of course, Wednesday,
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.440]   the second day of November, 2011,
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.880]   on this live Wednesday edition.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.720]   We're gonna do a 27-hour broadcast
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.240]   kicking off 11 a.m. tomorrow.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.080]   We'll tell you more about that
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.080]   after Governor Jesse Ventura leaves us.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.120]   We're gonna have free audio streams of all of it.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.600]   That's all posted at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:39.360]   Shane was on with us at the first 30 minutes
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.720]   of the show today, of course,
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.480]   one of the biggest rock bands ever.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.560]   And when he heard I had Jesse Ventura coming on
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.000]   during the break when I was saying bye to him,
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.120]   he said, "Do me a favor.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.760]   "Thank Governor Ventura for his stand
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.360]   "and what he's doing with the TSA and other issues."
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.800]   So I thought I would raise that to the governor.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.120]   So a lot of people appreciate your lawsuit
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.280]   and where that's going.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.840]   And before we get into that, Governor,
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:00.880]   in the last little segment,
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.240]   you were getting into the TSA
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:05.160]   and you were talking about 100 miles into the U.S.,
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.600]   that's most of the country now,
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.840]   all the way around the nation,
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.840]   they have Constitution-free zones.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.000]   In fact, we'll put a map of it up if the guys can find it.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.120]   Just Google Constitution-free zone
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.000]   where the Border Patrol searches your vehicle.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.560]   I had them try this twice in the last month
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.240]   and literally had to have verbal stand downs,
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.200]   standoffs with them, Gov.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.960]   So you were getting into that point.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.520]   - Well, yeah, you know, people need to understand,
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.440]   again, going back, that our freedoms,
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.160]   if they continue to erode them,
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.240]   they're going to go like cancer.
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.240]   It'll be a slow process,
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.120]   but it'll eventually lead to the death sentence
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.560]   to democracy and freedom.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.560]   And you drive around the country like I do now
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.080]   because I don't fly,
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.320]   because of my situation with the TSA
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.120]   and my pending lawsuit,
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:56.360]   and you come up to these immigration checkpoints,
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.040]   and it seems our country is so concerned
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:02.240]   over illegal Mexican immigrants
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.400]   that they're willing to give up our freedoms
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.640]   and our Constitution to stop them,
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:09.960]   which I think is absurd and ridiculous.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.200]   These checkpoints, you come up to them
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.240]   like in Arizona and California,
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.640]   and they're 50 to 100 miles from the border.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.640]   And the last one I pulled up to,
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.000]   I rolled my window down,
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.320]   and the guy comes up and he says,
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.520]   "Are you a U.S. citizen?"
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.960]   And I looked at him and I said,
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:30.280]   "If you don't have the constitutional authority
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.880]   to ask me that, young man."
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.880]   And he said, "Well, that's what we're required to do."
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.200]   And so, you know, and I realized
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.520]   the guys that are doing it,
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.160]   they need to look at their conscience too,
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.080]   because they're out there violating
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.000]   the Constitution of the United States
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.440]   because what their superiors are telling them to do.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.200]   And it's their jobs.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:54.240]   Well, at some point, you have to measure your job
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.600]   against your own beliefs.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.640]   And so I understand, they're the knuckle-draggers.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.360]   They're the guys on the ground.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.640]   But I still ask them.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.800]   I go, "How do you feel knowing that you're defying
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.560]   the United States Constitution?
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.800]   You're racially profiling,
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:12.360]   and you're asking me to prove my citizenship
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:14.240]   when the Constitution tells me
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.640]   I don't have to do that within the United States."
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.320]   Now, if I were at the border, that's different.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.560]   You're crossing into the country then.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.000]   But these places are 100 miles from the border,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.440]   and we seem to be okay with that.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:32.600]   I heard now where Obama not changing the subject,
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.160]   but I heard Obama is now gonna start raiding
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.160]   the medicinal marijuana places in California.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:41.320]   -They've been raiding them. -Well, that's outrageous.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.960]   Whatever happened to the people's vote?
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.560]   The people of California voted
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.320]   that they wanted medicinal marijuana
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.760]   to be prescribed by doctors as needed.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:57.440]   And the federal government is ignoring the people's vote?
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.640]   I'm outraged over that.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.240]   And if we don't start taking our country back
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.960]   at the ballot box, then we're to blame for it.
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.040]   And when I say take it back at the ballot box,
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.680]   stop voting for Democrats and Republicans.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:17.640]   They're destroying our nation right before your very eyes.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.280]   -Governor, I want to go back through
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:22.040]   what you've just said here, and it's on record.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.840]   They actually let the illegals through
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.200]   at these 100-mile-deep checkpoints.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.880]   Homeland Security has put a freeze on deportations,
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:32.520]   including felons, and Congress has now announced a subpoena.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.520]   So it's purely about domestic checkpoints.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.360]   And I got an RV because I want to stop flying as much
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.920]   when I travel, and twice, 98 miles into Texas,
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.840]   I pull up, they go, "Are you a U.S. citizen?"
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.280]   I'm like, "Do I look like one?
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.280]   Yes."
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.720]   And they said, "Pull over. We're searching you."
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.160]   And I got in a big confrontation.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.080]   The next time I said, "I'm not gonna be smart-mouthed
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.280]   about it, basically.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.520]   I'm gonna actually say, 'Yes, I am.'"
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.360]   And then they said, "Pull over. We're searching you."
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.880]   They had a drug dog, and I said, "It's unconstitutional.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.120]   It's one thing to check my --"
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.560]   'Cause I've looked at the Supreme Court ruling,
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.040]   "to ask if I'm a citizen,
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.160]   but it's another to have a drug dog."
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.600]   And he said, "It's not for drugs.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.600]   It's for narcotics."
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.680]   The same thing.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.640]   So these are domestic checkpoints.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.360]   But we were in Las Vegas,
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.200]   and you were about to do an interview,
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.280]   and I'm sitting there, and I said,
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.800]   "Hey, Gov, did you hear this week?
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.280]   They announced TSA checkpoints all over the country."
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.160]   And you're like -- and I understand why you're like,
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.840]   "You gotta be kidding, because that is such Nazi Germany,
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.240]   such Soviet Russia.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.840]   You said -- Oh, come on, Alex.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.040]   So I showed you on my iPhone mainstream news.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.240]   You took about 20 minutes and read a few articles about it.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.520]   Now that you know that you're suing them for your rights,
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.720]   you haven't -- the judge hasn't ruled yet.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.720]   I want you to talk about that, on whether or not
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:46.560]   you can go forward with the suit.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.680]   All this is happening, and now they're announcing
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.720]   all over Florida, Tennessee, you name it,
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.520]   you pull up to a TSA checkpoint
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.240]   with local police under their command.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:57.040]   Where's the Tenth Amendment?
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.400]   You know about that as a governor.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.480]   And they want to come on board and search trucks
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.720]   and passenger vehicles, and they're saying
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.680]   they may even search your person.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.320]   I mean, this is worse than the Soviet Union.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:11.160]   -And they're doing this in lieu of what, terrorism?
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.760]   -Yeah.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.840]   -So they think that we're so --
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.680]   I mean, if the country doesn't wake up to the fact
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.600]   that terrorism is a fraud --
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:25.040]   now, granted, there are groups in the world that do bad things,
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.320]   but for our country to put such a focus on --
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.640]   it's a fraud.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.480]   It's a red herring.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.520]   You're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:38.240]   If this is going on, which I see it, you know, like I said,
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.440]   I drive around the country, and I come up to these points,
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.320]   and I think that every driver that comes up to these points
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.720]   should ask these people
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.600]   why they're violating the Constitution.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.960]   Be polite, but ask them that.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:58.160]   Ask them why they're violating your constitutional rights.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.560]   You know, these guys right on the ground.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.240]   Because they need to be made aware of what they're doing,
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.920]   too, if they don't know it already.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.080]   -Well, behind the scenes, Gov, they're giving a manual
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.040]   saying if you raise the Constitution
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.000]   or you got a Ron Paul sticker or a libertarian sticker,
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:14.800]   you're a bad guy.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.520]   That's the MIAC report.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.360]   And it's totally --
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.520]   I mean, imagine, terrorists could attack a random cornfield
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.560]   in South Dakota or in North Texas.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:28.720]   I mean, do we have to have somebody in a black uniform
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.880]   randomly anywhere if terrorists attack shopping malls?
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.120]   Are they gonna have TSA there?
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.280]   They're saying yes.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.320]   They're now announcing they're gonna have TSA
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.000]   in shopping malls, Governor.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.680]   -Well, it's getting that bad.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.680]   I mean, I went to Minnesota
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.840]   Lynx basketball games this summer,
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.960]   and I walked up to go in.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.400]   I have a front-row ticket.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.960]   I'm the former governor of Minnesota,
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.440]   and I had a security guy stop me
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.400]   and ask me to empty my pockets
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.240]   because my wallet and my keys were in one pocket
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.280]   that was bulging.
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:03.400]   And I looked at the guy, and I said, "I'm the former governor.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.080]   You got to be kidding me."
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:10.200]   I said, "Do I have to sue you, too, as well as the TSA?"
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.760]   And so it's happening.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:14.040]   Now, maybe they have more right to do it there
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.840]   because it's a building that's run by private industry,
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.600]   the NBA or the WNBA,
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.840]   and I suppose they can set up any rules they want.
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.680]   I don't know about all that, but it's getting sickening
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:29.720]   where you as a citizen have to walk around
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.360]   and worry about what's next.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:35.000]   They're gonna throw us up against walls and pat us down
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.320]   because we might walk funny down the street.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.520]   -Well, it's like something out of the movie "Red Dawn,"
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.520]   a fictitious movie about a Soviet takeover of the West Coast.
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:48.320]   I'm sure you know, NFL-wide, they've now instituted
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.040]   from the ankle to the neck, and they admit.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.480]   They squeeze your wife's breasts.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.960]   They grab your genitals.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:56.960]   And this is freedom.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.640]   Now, the Green Bay Packers rebelled.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.640]   They said, "This has actually hurt our ticket sales.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.840]   We're not gonna do it."
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.120]   But, I mean, the idea -- -Remember, the Green Bay Packers
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.000]   are the only NFL team that's publicly owned.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.600]   -Ah. -See, always remember that,
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.520]   and you'll never see it again.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:18.040]   The Green Bay Packers are grandfathered in,
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.560]   but they are owned, basically,
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.840]   by the people of Green Bay, Wisconsin.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.800]   -Oh, I'd forgotten that. That's why --
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.880]   -They're all shareholders.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.600]   They're the only publicly held professional sports franchise,
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.280]   to my knowledge. -That's a great idea.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.520]   We should do something. That's how it should be run.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.120]   -Absolutely.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.920]   That way, you wouldn't get teams holding up
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.800]   like Minnesota right now.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.920]   They're bending over backwards, gonna raise taxes.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.480]   They're gonna violate treaties with the Native Americans
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:54.320]   and bring in more gambling to build the Vikings a new stadium.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.320]   -I'm back with the world, and I'm back where I can be.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:04.880]   -Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones,
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.400]   and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.520]   Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.560]   and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:16.280]   by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.480]   The respiratory system is the first line of defense
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.920]   for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:24.320]   The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.280]   with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:30.360]   and also delivers the silver nanoparticles
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.360]   instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.680]   With continued legislation threatening the sale
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.440]   of nano-silver products,
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.960]   you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.840]   with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:45.200]   Very easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions are provided,
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.280]   making production fast and simple.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:51.240]   Go to www.silverlungs.com today
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.200]   and learn more about the breakthrough technology
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.760]   of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:57.640]   That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:04.880]   -Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.640]   in the last century alone.
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.880]   This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.240]   -As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.120]   they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:19.200]   -We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress,
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.040]   and they really are calling the shots.
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.920]   -I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.280]   as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:29.560]   -For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.800]   the criminal offshore cartel,
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.960]   hell-bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.360]   and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.760]   -Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.320]   They're asking for more matches.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.760]   And the Congress is saying, "Who do we make the check out to?"
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.880]   -Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.320]   And right now in Washington, D.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.040]   C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.120]   concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.840]   -Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming,
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.600]   and I think it's important for my listeners
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.560]   to do three things right away.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.880]   Number one, study the past.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.240]   History really does repeat itself.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:23.080]   Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:26.160]   Number three, take decisive action.
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:30.040]   A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.760]   That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book,
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.040]   "Rising Prices, Empty Shelves --
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:39.120]   Warning Signs That Trigger the Deadliest Famines in History."
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:42.520]   Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.040]   This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.600]   You'll also get a free copy of "Supermarket Survival --
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.880]   How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half."
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:56.560]   Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:00.800]   That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.920]   A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011,
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.520]   we will witness the most important day in America
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.960]   in more than 50 years.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.520]   He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.280]   The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.880]   and even how you take care of your health
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:16.880]   and your own family.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.120]   Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:19.960]   over the years.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:22.240]   The crazy part is he's usually right.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.600]   You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:27.200]   Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner,
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.440]   General Growth Properties.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.880]   In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:33.440]   Recently, he created a video,
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.000]   which you can watch online for free,
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.640]   detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.200]   And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.600]   I can't stress this enough.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.280]   You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.920]   He explains everything you need to know,
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.520]   including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:52.120]   You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.

[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.960]   Let's get back to Jesse Ventura.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.560]   Gov, there's so many points here,
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.680]   but since during the break,
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.080]   I said, "What a great quote, freedom is safety."
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.360]   That's as good as Ron Paul's legalized freedom.
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.320]   And you went on to say,
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:00.160]   "Well, in your own words,
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.920]   I'd rather face the danger and live on my knees."
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:03.920]   And then you pointed out,
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.560]   "Look how many people prescription drugs kill.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.320]   Look how many people honeybees kill."
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.600]   I mean, to claim we've gotta have armed men everywhere
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.920]   putting us in shackles to keep us safe from turbaned men,
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.560]   it's ridiculous.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:20.320]   - Well, what's ridiculous is we're accepting it.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.160]   That's what's ridiculous, Alex,
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.760]   is that the United States people are accepting this.
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.760]   How naive are we?
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:31.080]   All the guys my age out there,
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.840]   how many of you sit back today
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.560]   and look at the Vietnam War and say,
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.840]   "Gee, that was a mighty good idea."
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.120]   Where the hell are we out there today?
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.800]   We're a bunch of, I don't know,
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:45.960]   maybe it's the fluoride in the water, Alex.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.760]   Maybe the Prozac in the water
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.520]   has gotten everybody so numb in the head
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:53.480]   that they just accept this without any problems.
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:54.320]   I don't know.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:58.240]   - No, that is it, Governor.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.520]   The sodium fluoride does give a sevenfold increase
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:04.560]   in cancer, it does reduce aggression in males.
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:07.840]   The GMO in rats does basically feminize them.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.600]   - It's Prozac, it's Prozac in the water.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.360]   Call it what it is.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.480]   - It is, you're right.
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:19.160]   - Unfortunately, I've drank well water
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:22.200]   the majority of my life, so I haven't got my dose.
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.240]   So that must be why I am like I am.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:28.600]   - Man, I grew up in Dallas where it was like 2%,
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.800]   two parts per million, which is off the chart.
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:34.160]   And I don't know how I'm still aggressive, but I mean--
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.080]   - I'm not judging what you'd be without it.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.080]   (laughing)
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.040]   - Oh man, well listen, I'm not putting up with it,
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.400]   you're not putting up with it.
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.040]   Let's talk about your lawsuit.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:46.840]   I mean, wow, they haven't even ruled it and go forward.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:49.120]   - Well, the good thing is this is the longest
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.600]   they've ever taken on a ruling of this nature.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.960]   My attorney told me that.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:57.320]   Every other one that's brought a suit against the PSA
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.840]   or against Homeland has been ruled upon
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.720]   in less time than mine has now.
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:04.600]   So maybe that's a good sign, I don't know.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:08.040]   I'm waiting to hear, can I go to court or can't I?
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.320]   And my (audio cuts out)
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.880]   not being able to go to court.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:14.800]   This is the United States of America, it's supposed to be.
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.400]   Can't I have judgment by my peers?
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:22.000]   - And Guy, with that critical juncture,
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.400]   your phone cut off for just a moment.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.840]   Can you repeat what you just said?
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.480]   - Well, I'm getting another call
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:28.760]   that I'm ignoring right now, so bear with me.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:31.240]   But what I'm stating is,
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.760]   why can't I put in judgment by my peers?
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.600]   That's all I ask for.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.880]   I want my day in court in front of a jury
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.320]   and let a jury decide if Jesse Ventura poses a threat.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:47.240]   - Well, as a citizen,
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.200]   absolutely you should have your day in court.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.240]   Not only should they find this to be a federal power grab,
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:56.000]   10th Amendment violation, Fourth Amendment violation,
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.680]   due process violation.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.760]   I mean, it literally is martial law
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.160]   in their own internal manuals.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:03.000]   That's what they're actually getting us ready for.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.200]   That's now coming out in the news in just the last few days
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.320]   that this is to be on the streets, it is a takeover.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:12.240]   But how could you not have your lawsuit go forward?
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.040]   I mean- - Well, if she throws it out
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.320]   or if she does what the government wants,
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:19.080]   they want it to go straight to the Court of Appeals.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.880]   Three judges paid by them.
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.240]   Instead of in front of a jury.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.960]   I want it in front of a jury.
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.320]   - Now you've alluded to me privately
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.880]   and you said you're gonna have a big press conference
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.320]   if they don't hear your case.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:37.880]   You wanna hint to folks or what's going on in your mind
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.440]   if they don't let you have your day in court?
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.640]   - Well, if they don't let me have my day in court,
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:44.720]   then what you heard today will be mild.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:47.080]   (laughs)
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.000]   Let me put it that way.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.040]   What you heard on your show today will be mild
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.040]   compared to the press conference I'll have
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.280]   if they don't let me go to court.
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:57.120]   - I got it. - Anyway,
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.720]   that's where that's at, Alex.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.360]   The other thing that hurts me,
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.640]   did you see that thing on painkiller prescription drugs
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:07.040]   and how many people it kills every year?
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.880]   - More than 20,000, yeah.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:12.160]   - Unbelievable, yet we ban marijuana?
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.880]   Yet the Obama administration is gonna raid marijuana
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.320]   dispensaries in California
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.280]   and they allow prescription drugs.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.480]   Marijuana's never killed anybody.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.480]   - I had a football buddy and I had a girlfriend
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:32.000]   who years later in high school died
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.840]   on taking too many pain pills.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.680]   I mean, I know people currently who've died.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:38.400]   I mean, this is a scourge.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.640]   300,000 a year die from prescription interactions.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:44.440]   - Well, let's face it, Rush Limbaugh was addicted
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.160]   to pain-killing drugs.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:50.440]   Now, if it can addict a great American like Rush,
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:54.120]   and of course I'm being a bit sarcastic,
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.280]   I hope you get that.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.960]   (laughing)
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.960]   I mean, if Rush Limbaugh,
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.920]   and yet they're out there busting for marijuana?
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.040]   They're busting Willie Nelson?
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.360]   - Oh yeah, we were hanging out with Willie a while back.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.360]   I'm sure you've seen since then twice he's been grabbed.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.440]   - It's horrible.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:16.840]   Why aren't we taking marijuana and turning,
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:20.800]   people need to remember that the Constitution
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:23.240]   and the flag are made of marijuana.
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:28.520]   - By the way, you know, it was an internal checkpoint
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.280]   that he ran into last in South Texas,
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.080]   a hundred plus miles into the country.
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.520]   And they said, "You're Willie Nelson.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.360]   Do you have marijuana?"
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.680]   And he said, "What do you think?"
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.160]   I mean, isn't that ridiculous
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:42.480]   that obviously Willie Nelson's got marijuana?
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:44.840]   - Well, and who cares?
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.440]   Does it affect Willie's singing?
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:47.280]   No.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.440]   Does it affect Willie's popularity?
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.280]   No.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.920]   Does it make Willie feel better?
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.600]   Probably, yes.
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:55.640]   Why is that against the law?
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.760]   - He's almost 80 and still jogs
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:58.960]   two or three miles every morning.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.280]   - Well, and the point, hey,
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.320]   you know, the point of the matter is
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.040]   let's take control of our country.
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.480]   Let's get our hats on straight.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:10.080]   And let's figure out what needs to be against the law
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.880]   and what shouldn't be against the law.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.720]   And marijuana should not be against the law.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:17.960]   If they have prescription painkillers
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.160]   that kill thousands of people every year,
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.280]   multi-thousands prescribed.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.400]   And I just saw a show where the kids,
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.720]   the teenagers now, they're not taking pot.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:31.480]   They're taking prescription painkillers.
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.200]   That's the drug of choice now amongst the young people.
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.320]   - I don't know how they take it.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.760]   I broke my leg once.
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:40.360]   After surgery, they gave me pills.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.640]   And I get nauseous when I eat one of those opiates.
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:46.720]   - Governor, shifting gears into the election,
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.320]   you said three, four months ago,
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.200]   and then again a month or so ago,
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.560]   here on this radio show that Ron Paul
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.400]   should leave the Republican Party
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.120]   and should run as a libertarian
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:59.400]   because they've got ballot access in at least 48 states,
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:02.960]   maybe 50, they debate those last two.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.720]   I made the point on air
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.360]   and also made it to the Ron Paul campaign
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.320]   that if he doesn't look like he's gonna get
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:12.040]   the nomination by February, March,
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.920]   or so, that then he should go over
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:17.200]   just so he can inject real issues into the campaign.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.760]   But he's gonna have a lot more support
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.560]   third party than Ross Perot.
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.280]   Well, now he announced last week,
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.120]   for those that don't know,
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.360]   you can just type it into Google,
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:28.280]   that he's looking at perhaps a third party run.
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:30.080]   And it would probably be as a libertarian.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.320]   The libertarians have said,
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.840]   let us know in the next three, four months.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:35.400]   We'll give you obviously the nomination.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:38.480]   Jesse A., what's your view on that?
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.080]   And Ron Paul basically responding to you.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.400]   And would you run as his VP?
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:44.440]   - Well, first of all,
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.080]   I think Ron Paul's handling this brilliantly
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:50.200]   because he needs to stay a Republican
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.360]   to stay in the debates,
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.640]   to stay out there on television as much as possible.
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:57.720]   So he should cling to the Republicans
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:59.760]   all the way till they make their choice.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:03.280]   - Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:06.960]   - Tyranny is here.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:10.880]   - The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.280]   - It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.880]   - The United States is now recognized globally
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:19.000]   as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.400]   This film conclusively proves the existence
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.480]   of a secret network of FEMA camps
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.680]   now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.240]   This documentary exposes
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:29.000]   how the continuity of government program
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.680]   has established an all powerful shadow state.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.080]   Police state four chronicles the sickening depth
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.840]   to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:38.320]   - Prepare to enter the secretive world
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.120]   of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:43.200]   Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.000]   stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.280]   It's only the beginning
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.600]   of the new world order's hellish plan.
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:52.640]   The police state isn't coming, it's here.

[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:03.160]   - This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.600]   you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.760]   Number one, new climate legislation
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.960]   could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.880]   Number two, our new energy czar wants to control
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:15.720]   how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:18.600]   It's true, total government control of electricity
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.320]   in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:23.600]   Number three, in some areas of the country,
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:25.720]   the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:28.000]   And now new socialist legislation
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.640]   is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.360]   Number four, dangerous weather
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.160]   is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.480]   Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:36.880]   from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.920]   Number five, a solar power generator
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.840]   provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.920]   Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:45.480]   offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.880]   one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:19.400]   - To me, the Republican debates are virtually unwatchable.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:22.920]   I watch them for about 10 minutes and I'm so disgusted.
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:25.520]   But the other day I forced myself to watch
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:29.360]   'cause I wanted to hear whatever Congressman Paul spoke.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:32.480]   And whenever he did, he clearly is the only one
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:34.480]   that makes any sense whatsoever
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:37.440]   out of the whole bunch of candidates up there.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:40.200]   Clearly, by far and away, in my opinion.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.520]   He's the heads above everyone else.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:45.200]   Now, he's playing it brilliantly.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:47.400]   Ride that Republican wagon all the way
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:50.360]   'til they boot him off it, which you know they will.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:53.000]   And then as soon as they boot him off it,
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.640]   which they choose their candidate, whatever,
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:58.600]   then he immediately should jump to the Libertarian Party.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:01.880]   He'll have ballot access in virtually every state.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:04.160]   He'll have the momentum of the Republican
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.000]   all the time on TV with them.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.480]   And he should get numbers big enough
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:12.160]   to where they'll have to include him in the debates.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:14.480]   If they don't include him in the debates,
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.480]   we should start rioting in the streets.
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:20.480]   - Wow, what a statement from Jesse Ventura.
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.160]   I guess it is getting down to the point
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:25.480]   where this government's acting about like the Redcoats.
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:27.560]   If you read the Declaration of Independence,
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.640]   everything in there is exactly
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.280]   what this out-of-control government,
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:34.040]   hijacked by the Federal Reserve, is doing.
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.680]   - Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.720]   And you notice that when Ron Tad brings up
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:40.600]   auditing the Federal Reserve,
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:43.680]   all those other candidates head for the hills.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:46.400]   They don't speak a word about that.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.200]   Not one word from any other candidate up there,
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.920]   including the current frontrunner,
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:56.920]   the godfather at Godfather's Pizza, Tade.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:58.520]   - Yeah, by the way-
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.440]   - He doesn't even touch it either.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.560]   - By the way, his solution is new taxes
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.160]   on top of the income taxes.
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:05.160]   Can you imagine, Governor,
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.240]   the feds involved in sales taxes and VAT?
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:09.640]   The hell of that?
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:14.240]   - Well, you know, if it legitimately could be 999,
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.080]   I don't see nothing wrong with that, really.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.840]   That's less than I'm paying now.
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:20.400]   - Yeah, but you know they're gonna jack it up.
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:21.440]   - But oh, of course.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:25.200]   And I would like, you know I'm an advocate
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:29.160]   of the national sales tax to abolish the income tax,
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.800]   which of course was never constitutionally passed
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:32.640]   in the first place.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:34.440]   - Sure, sure, but only if you can completely
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.640]   get rid of the income tax and have an amendment against it.
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.920]   - Yep, get rid of the income tax
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:40.800]   and go to a national sales tax.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.720]   I've been an advocate of that for 20 years now.
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:45.760]   You know, 'cause my belief is clear.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.040]   My belief is wealth is not what you earn.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:50.160]   Wealth is determined by what you spend.
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.000]   - I agree with that.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.120]   It shouldn't penalize savings and investment.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:55.680]   Now expanding on that, but to be specific,
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.440]   putting you here on the hot seat.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:58.280]   - All right.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:02.320]   - If Ron Paul approached you about being his VP,
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.840]   because I happen to know there's been some scuttlebutt
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:07.520]   concerning that, if Ron Paul approached you,
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:09.400]   you know, running as a libertarian,
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:12.840]   and said, "Jesse, governor, I'd like you to run as my VP,"
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:13.800]   what would you say?
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:16.360]   - Well, first of all, I would say this.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.720]   That would be the best insurance policy
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:21.720]   Congressman Paul could ever have.
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:24.800]   Because nobody's gonna assassinate him
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.680]   and let me be in charge.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.080]   - Ha ha, no, no.
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:30.920]   - So he definitely, if you wanna look at it,
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:34.120]   would be the lesser of the two evils from their perspective.
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:38.680]   So I would give it serious consideration.
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:41.200]   I would not say right now whether yes or no,
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:44.600]   because naturally I would have to discuss it with my family
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:47.280]   before I would do any venture like that.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:51.000]   But if it were to come to pass next spring or next summer,
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.560]   when I get back from Mexico,
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:56.000]   if the iron's hot, I don't know.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.080]   You know, I guess I'll go to Mexico
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.440]   and think about it this winter.
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:01.920]   And by the time I get back, it ought to be time,
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:03.480]   if a decision has to be made,
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.440]   that'll be the time to make it.
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.280]   - Governor, what about this angle?
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:10.240]   If Ron Paul doesn't run, if he doesn't get the nomination,
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:11.520]   we should all push for that, obviously,
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.400]   using that machinery against, you know,
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.320]   against the power structure against itself.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.560]   And he doesn't, for whatever reason,
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:21.400]   his wife's health, whatever, run as a libertarian.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:23.920]   What about Jesse Ventura seeking that nomination?
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.360]   Even if he didn't win,
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.240]   and I know you don't do stuff to not win,
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:29.400]   but you would still win by being on the field,
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:32.600]   injecting real issues and being in the national debate.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:33.720]   I mean, my God.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:36.440]   - Well, that would require the libertarians
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.200]   to come and ask me, wouldn't it?
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.040]   - Yes.
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:43.360]   - So, and the libertarians have never done that to me before.
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.400]   So I guess the ball would be
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:47.560]   in the libertarians' corner, wouldn't it?
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:50.840]   But if you got invited to that party,
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:53.160]   you would look at the invitation.
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.000]   - Well, I am a libertarian.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.600]   You know, I've taken their exam.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:59.120]   I pass it with flying colors.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.480]   You know, I am a libertarian.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:03.120]   I just like to say small L.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:03.960]   - Sure.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:06.400]   - You know, I believe there is a place for government.
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.320]   I believe that government has a place
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.880]   in an organized society that you must have it,
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.960]   where you have some libertarians
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.600]   that don't even buy into that.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.120]   - Yeah, they're anarcho-capitalist.
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.600]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:20.120]   And you know, and so, you know,
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:23.560]   I consider myself a libertarian, small L.
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:24.840]   I'm fiscally conservative.
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.600]   I'm socially liberal.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.080]   I don't believe that government
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.000]   should be in your private life whatsoever.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.200]   They have no business there.
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:33.280]   - Well, regardless, you wanna audit
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.800]   and abolish the Federal Reserve.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.360]   What would you do as president?
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.040]   What's your view of Libya?
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.560]   He's won a peace prize.
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:40.800]   It would last days, not weeks.
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.120]   Went on six months.
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:42.960]   40, 50--
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:43.800]   - You know what I find?
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:47.360]   Let me tell you what I find about the Libyan situation.
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:53.120]   Our media and our government have no problem
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:55.440]   showing us Gaddafi's dead body
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:58.000]   multiple, multiple times, correct?
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:58.840]   - Yes.
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:02.640]   - And yet they outlawed showing our caskets
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.880]   coming home from the war, didn't they?
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:05.920]   - Yes, sir.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:09.280]   - That is the biggest piece of propaganda crap
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.320]   I've ever seen in my life.
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.160]   - You're right.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.000]   Listen, I got--
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.280]   - They will sit and show Gaddafi dead 50 times over
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:18.680]   the quote unquote Islamic enemy,
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:21.920]   but they won't show our boys coming home
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.520]   from these phony wars that shouldn't be fought.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:28.600]   - By the way, I on YouTube the other day
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.960]   showed Walter Cronkite showing the little girl
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:32.720]   with a napalm with her skin burned off.
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:33.560]   - Yep.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.400]   - And then I showed a modern girl
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:37.520]   with her jaw blown off in cert,
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:43.400]   and they blocked the video and called it obscene.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.600]   No, the not letting the people see
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.600]   what these wars are doing in our name, that's obscene.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:49.920]   - Exactly.
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.600]   It's obscene to stick your head in the sand.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:56.400]   It's obscene as a citizen and a taxpayer of this country
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.960]   that your money pays for these wars,
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:02.040]   and yet you don't want anything knowledge of them.
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:03.800]   You better wake up people out there
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:06.160]   and you better start looking at these wars,
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:07.400]   and you better start looking,
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.560]   do you realize Alex that my country
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.600]   has been at war over half my life?
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.440]   - Yes.
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.760]   - And I'm a post World War II baby.
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:20.360]   I was born in 51, and we've been at war
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.320]   for over half my life.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.200]   No other country in the world
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.360]   can come close to making that statement.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:30.760]   - Plus these aren't wars where we got attacked,
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.680]   these are wars for the corporate interests
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:33.520]   that have taken our country.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:34.680]   - Totally.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:37.440]   Every war we fought since World War II
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.640]   I have yet to figure out what for,
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:42.400]   and what was it fought over.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:46.720]   It was fought over the phoniness of the Cold War,
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:50.600]   which we all now know is a setup on both sides.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:54.280]   If you do any historical reading on the other side
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.840]   or our side or talk to people
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:58.480]   that live behind the Iron Curtain,
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:02.320]   they were getting told the same thing we were getting told.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.600]   They were getting told we have to stop
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:08.280]   the capitalist imperialists from taking over the world.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:10.760]   While we were being told we have to stop
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.760]   the domino effect of communism.
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:13.600]   - Meanwhile, the same--
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.360]   - When are people gonna wake up Alex
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.800]   and realize all of that was planned?
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:19.520]   - It's come out, you're right,
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.720]   they've released the KGB files and others,
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:25.160]   that both sides are being financed by the mega banks
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:27.960]   who were actually playing both sides off against each other
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.920]   and using the crisis to create massive debt
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:33.280]   and authoritarian control,
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:35.560]   just of different flavors in both hemispheres.
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:39.240]   - Absolutely, and so the point to the matter is again,
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.360]   it comes back to we as the people of the United States,
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:44.840]   are we gonna stand for this or not?
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.400]   And the simplest way,
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:50.840]   if Ron Paul becomes a libertarian elected president,
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:54.240]   that's the only way.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:57.240]   If we keep electing Democrats and Republicans,
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:59.760]   we are going to get the same old, same old.
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:02.800]   Why do you think these people are protesting out there?
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.680]   They're protesting because it's equal
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.600]   between both of these parties.
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:10.040]   They are both completely controlled by Wall Street.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.960]   Both parties.
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.360]   I mean, take a look,
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.800]   it doesn't matter what president we have,
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.360]   Democrat or Republican,
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.600]   our Department of the Secretary of Treasury
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:23.920]   always comes out of Goldman Sachs in modern times.
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.360]   Every last one of them.
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:28.080]   Now is that happenstance?
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:29.280]   I don't think so.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:33.360]   - All right, we've only got about eight, nine minutes left
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.760]   and I've got four or five points
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.880]   I wanna throw out there at you.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:40.000]   But first off, we carry all of Jesse Ventura's books,
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.840]   all of the recent modern ones.
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:44.800]   We said, we have "Don't Start the Revolution Without Me."
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.800]   That's available now in paperback.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:49.280]   We have Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell, 63 documents
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:50.680]   the government doesn't want you to read.
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:52.520]   His newest, very powerful.
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:55.840]   He has "American Conspiracies," excellent as well.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.280]   All of these books are great.
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:59.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:02.720]   (dramatic music)
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:04.400]   - Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.280]   I'm looking for people that have the wisdom
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:09.600]   to spot savings, opportunity and recognize risk.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.280]   Saving means to make money.
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.920]   The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.760]   can save you thousands of dollars
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.040]   and give you good old fashioned real soaps
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.480]   that are triple concentrated
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:20.720]   and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.560]   Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.720]   that contain no useless dyes,
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:28.320]   perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials.
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:31.600]   Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:34.040]   that give you rashes, itching sores
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:36.360]   and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.480]   If you want something better,
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:39.480]   if you want something you've never had before,
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:41.560]   you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.320]   Getting a free catalog is easy

[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:00.720]   (dramatic music)
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:04.800]   - Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.520]   in the last century alone.
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:09.800]   This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:12.160]   - As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.120]   they'll be pulling the rug
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.040]   from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:19.080]   - We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.960]   and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.800]   - I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:26.160]   as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:29.440]   - Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:31.640]   the criminal offshore cartel
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.840]   hell-bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:36.280]   and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:38.640]   - Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.200]   They're asking for more matches
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:41.440]   and the Congress is saying,
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:42.640]   who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.760]   - Today, it seems like nobody does care
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:47.040]   and right now in Washington, DC,
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.920]   we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:05.160]   A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011,
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:07.760]   we will witness the most important day in America
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:09.240]   in more than 50 years.
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:11.800]   He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:14.520]   The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:16.120]   and even how you take care of your health
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:17.120]   and your own family.
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.360]   Now this man has made some outrageous predictions
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:20.200]   over the years.
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:22.520]   The crazy part is he's usually right.
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:24.880]   You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:26.040]   Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:28.720]   and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:32.120]   In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:33.680]   Recently, he created a video
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:35.280]   which you can watch online for free
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:37.880]   detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:39.440]   and it's a real eye opener.
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:40.840]   I can't stress this enough.
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:43.520]   You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.160]   He explains everything you need to know
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:47.760]   including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:52.400]   You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.960]   That's end of America, the number three.com.
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.840]   Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:00.760]   That's end of america3.com.
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:06.120]   - Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:09.800]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:15.360]   - From the front lines of the information war,
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:17.280]   it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:21.120]   - Jesse Ventura has called in.
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:23.240]   He's I guess completed the press conference
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:25.760]   there in front of the federal courthouse.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:28.360]   And again, people missed the Associated Press
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:31.560]   and ABC News and all the rest of it.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.560]   The judge, after waiting months and months and months
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.360]   to rule of the case to go forward,
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.320]   said it was the wrong venue.
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:41.160]   So for me, that's not even so much thrown out as a punt,
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:46.160]   as a chicken type behavior of Jesse Ventura.
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:49.240]   It's a behavior of just basically passing the buck.
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:51.800]   And we're joined now by former Minnesota governor,
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:53.720]   Jesse Ventura, bestselling author,
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:56.160]   and of course, a friend of this show,
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:59.400]   host of the popular television show, "Conspiracy Theory."
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:01.480]   Governor, thank you for joining us.
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:02.320]   - Thanks, Alex.
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.040]   Always a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:06.400]   Not so much a pleasure to talk to the other media,
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:08.680]   but always a pleasure talking to you.
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.840]   - Well, sir, a lot of people appreciate your courage
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:11.680]   and what you've done.
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.360]   Please tell us what you said at the press conference
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:17.680]   and what the rat establishment media was valuing like.
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:20.560]   - Well, they mainly just listened to what I had to say.
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:23.720]   And I basically told them that I've now been stripped
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:27.000]   of my patriotism, that I have no more feelings
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.680]   for this government that runs this country today
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:33.880]   because quite simply, they deny me my right in court.
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:36.560]   It seems that going after veterans
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:38.200]   seems to be the trend right now.
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:43.200]   Every time veterans try to exercise their rights,
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:46.600]   constitutional rights, we seem to be getting tramped down.
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:50.000]   I mean, the one serviceman that was beaten up
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.800]   exercising his right to protest,
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:55.920]   and now myself wanting to exercise my right
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:57.920]   to have a trial by jury,
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:59.920]   and the government won't allow it to happen.
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:00.920]   It's that simple.
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:05.160]   - Now, Governor, I mean, obviously I was stunned.
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:07.640]   I mean, even though I knew it was possible
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:10.480]   when you were kind enough to call me last night
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.960]   and keep me abreast of what happened,
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:13.120]   and you said that they'd thrown it out,
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:14.240]   and then I went and looked it up
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.160]   and it showed up in the media.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:18.800]   But the way this judge did it,
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:19.640]   correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:20.720]   'cause you've got the actual ruling,
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:22.360]   not just what the news is saying,
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:24.680]   said, well, this was the wrong venue.
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:27.160]   So I mean-
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.120]   - Well, what they claim, Alex,
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.280]   is they have no jurisdiction.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:34.120]   Well, if the federal court doesn't have jurisdiction
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:37.920]   over a constitutional question, who the hell does?
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:42.200]   - Okay, because the way I read it was
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:43.960]   they were saying that it needed to be
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:45.160]   another circuit court,
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:47.400]   but you're saying, your lawyer's saying in the ruling,
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:48.560]   no, they're just saying
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:52.280]   that the feds don't have jurisdiction over the TSA.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:53.400]   - Well, what they're saying is
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.440]   that I have to go to the Court of Appeals.
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:57.600]   In other words, I'm guilty,
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.440]   and I have to go to the Court of Appeals
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:00.800]   to be proved innocent.
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:03.080]   I can't have a jury trial.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.200]   It has to be, they're stating it has to go
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:07.720]   to the Court of Appeals,
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:10.320]   which are three federally paid judges
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:11.960]   who will make the decision,
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:15.440]   and they say it's because of secrecy reasons.
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:19.760]   So clearly they won't allow an open trial to happen
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:21.440]   concerning the Fourth Amendment
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:25.760]   of illegal search and seizure of our Constitution.
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:28.160]   - Governor Jesse Ventura, two days ago,
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:30.640]   when you were on with us,
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:34.240]   you made the central point that it's martial law
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:35.080]   when you go to the airport,
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:36.680]   and now they're on the highways.
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:38.560]   And look at this ruling.
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:40.960]   They're saying national security, it's secret.
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:42.680]   We can't tell you, you're a governor,
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:45.280]   you're a Navy veteran, honorably discharged,
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.880]   highly decorated, all of this, well-known.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:50.160]   You have to be groped by somebody.
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:52.600]   And when I was going through the TSA in Las Vegas
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:54.560]   when I was out there with you a few weeks ago,
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.320]   when I was flying back to Austin,
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:58.720]   I said, "How do I know you're not a terrorist?
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:00.000]   "How do I know you're not guilty
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.840]   "until proven innocent if I'm guilty?"
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:03.440]   And the guy said, "I can be trusted.
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:04.920]   "The government's checked me out."
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:07.200]   I mean, it's this idea that we're all criminals,
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:08.080]   we're all prisoners.
[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:09.440]   Can you elaborate on your statement
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:12.280]   of what this country's now become,
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:14.920]   and your statement about martial law?
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:19.080]   - Well, clearly, Alex, is that we're all guilty now
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.560]   until we prove we're innocent.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:23.000]   And the problem is we can't even prove
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.840]   we're innocent in front of a jury.
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:27.800]   I always thought we were guaranteed
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:30.520]   the right of a jury trial in this country,
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:33.720]   a trial of your peers, of your citizens.
[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:35.760]   Clearly, the government doesn't want this
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:37.120]   going in front of citizens,
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:39.280]   because obviously they'd lose.
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:42.720]   And if they lost, it would open up Pandora's box.
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:44.120]   And the other thing they don't want,
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:46.640]   the other question they don't want out there
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:50.120]   is the question that why is it the government's job
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:52.320]   to provide security for the airlines
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:54.800]   when the airlines are a private sector business?
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:58.800]   - Well, what about, you were a governor,
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:00.560]   you know more about the 10th Amendment than I do.
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:03.640]   Since when do the feds, I mean, I can send you the PSAs,
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:08.560]   they're now airing TV ads showing TSA at Buccaneers games,
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.600]   and at shopping malls searching people,
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:14.080]   and then governor, they're now rolling out on the streets.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:15.320]   - Absolutely they are.
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:17.760]   When you drive around the country now,
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:20.600]   our border agents are no longer at the border.
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:21.800]   They're out in the deserts,
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:24.040]   they're out on our interstate highways.
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:26.920]   I predict, Alex, that within the decade,
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:29.000]   you will have to show ID to travel
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.520]   state to state in this country,
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:33.640]   because the Constitution is no more,
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:35.480]   and the Bill of Rights are no more.
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:37.200]   That was proven to me today
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.480]   when I wasn't allowed to go to court on them.
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:42.760]   - Governor, you know, you've always told me
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:46.280]   that you stay focused, you don't give up.
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:49.000]   I mean, I think the answer is,
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.320]   and obviously you'd run to win,
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:53.040]   but run for president to try to, you know,
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:54.280]   say restore the Bill of Rights,
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:57.280]   restore the Constitution, legalize freedom,
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:58.960]   legalize America.
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:00.600]   I mean, you would get a lot of attention
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:03.960]   and could really put the heat on these people.
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:05.560]   And I understand, you know,
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:06.760]   there's a lot of other countries,
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:07.760]   but you love this nation.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:09.040]   It's not America that went wrong,
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.160]   it's this corrupt system.
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:13.560]   I mean, obviously you're percolating right now,
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:17.000]   you're thinking, but what's racing through your mind?
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.120]   I mean, what's next?
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:21.040]   - Well, I talked about it at the press conference today
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:23.200]   that I guess the only recourse I could have
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:25.560]   would be to win the presidency.
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.400]   And then could I get my day in court as the president?
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:31.840]   You know, that would be my next question.
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:33.520]   As president of the United States,
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:36.120]   could I go to court over my Fourth Amendment rights?
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:37.760]   I don't know, Alex.
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:39.800]   I mean, I can't run for president
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:42.440]   'cause I don't have ballot access in all 50 states.
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:45.440]   And that would require a great deal of money,
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:47.000]   a great deal of time,
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.200]   and the system is set up so that you're not,
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:51.040]   you can't achieve that.
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:53.560]   That way the Democrats and Republicans,
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.600]   the two-party dictatorship,
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:58.680]   they hold the stranglehold on all our elections
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:00.600]   because an independent like me
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:03.440]   cannot get ballot access in all 50 states.
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.880]   - Well, Governor, you've always been a winner
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:10.160]   and you won as a trailblazer in Minnesota,
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:11.840]   out of nowhere as governor.
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:14.280]   And the people are more angry and more awake
[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:15.320]   than they've ever been.
[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:17.760]   You got one group of people that are more sheeple than ever,
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:19.880]   but a lot of folks are really waking up.
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:23.840]   Ron Paul is saying, "Hey, I might run as third party."
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:25.760]   The libertarians are saying, "Come on over."
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:27.600]   If Paul doesn't take it,
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:29.440]   they're the ones that have ballot access.
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:32.240]   I think it's time for them to right now approach you
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:34.680]   and say, because you've got the name,
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:36.320]   you've got the knowledge,
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:38.400]   you've got the track record.
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:41.320]   And again, I understand the instinct
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:43.840]   'cause I have it myself to just get out of here.
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:46.760]   And I won't blame you if you do that
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:48.880]   because you're a Navy guy,
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:50.400]   there's such a thing as abandoning ship,
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:53.240]   but you've been a captain, you've been a governor,
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:56.280]   and I think we need you to try to save the Republic.
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:57.520]   I mean, you've already done so much.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:59.960]   I hate to say do more and more and more, but.
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:02.000]   - Well, let me put it to you this way, Alex.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.320]   The ball's in the libertarian court now.
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:05.760]   They have to approach me
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:08.360]   or they have to approach Congressman Paul,
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:09.840]   whoever they want to approach
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.960]   to be their presidential candidate.
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.760]   I'm not going to approach them.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:15.320]   They will have to approach me.
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:17.520]   - What is your mental,
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:19.440]   I mean, when you got the call from your lawyer
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:20.800]   and heard about the ruling,
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:22.680]   what was the first thing went through your mind?
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:25.880]   And please give us any other points
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:27.840]   that you made at the press conference, sir.
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:29.480]   - Well, what went through my mind,
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:31.400]   it was very disheartening.
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:34.960]   It was like having your guts pulled out of you.
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:37.720]   They gutted me as far as my patriotism goes.
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:41.160]   I have no patriotism whatsoever to this government today.
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:46.200]   As my T-shirt say, I love my country, not my government.
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:47.840]   And I think that speaks volumes
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:49.840]   to where I feel right now, Alex.
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:51.640]   I have no love for the government
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:53.680]   of the United States of America today.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:57.680]   - How's Terry taking it, your wife?
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:00.720]   - Like always, she's a battler.
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:04.120]   She'll do, she stands by me no matter what I do.
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:06.360]   I couldn't ask for a better person that way
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:09.440]   and she'll grit her teeth and get through it, I hope.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:14.120]   - Well, we were hoping for sanity in government,
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:16.520]   but it's just, you know, we tried in Texas.
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:18.000]   - It's not going to happen, Alex.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.840]   When a citizen can't go to court
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:24.080]   to fight for the Bill of Rights,
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:27.320]   his rights, his basic Bill of Rights in this country,
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:30.560]   when they won't allow you to go to court over that,
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:32.160]   well, that tells you.
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:34.080]   I will now refer to this country
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:36.880]   no longer as the United States of America.
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:40.680]   I will refer to it as the fascist states of America
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:43.120]   because that's what I believe we are, Alex.
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.640]   We are fascists now.
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:47.320]   - Well, there's no doubt.
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:49.120]   In fact, there's a quote in the Associated Press
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:51.880]   where you said, "This is not the country I grew up in.
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:54.480]   "America is now a fascist nation."
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:57.360]   - Yeah, and I quoted Kevin Costner today
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.440]   at the press conference.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:00.880]   I said, "This is not the country I was born in,
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:04.600]   "and it's certainly not going to be the country I die in."
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:06.760]   - Well, look, the country's been hijacked,
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:09.880]   and yes, the people-- - We gotta take it back.
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:13.320]   - Well, I know you're a busy man.
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:16.040]   Just, as soon as you leave,
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:17.640]   I'll have 50 questions that pop in my head.
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:21.440]   This is all stunning. - Well, unfortunately, Alex,
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:23.680]   I gotta take off, so we gotta end it now,
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:24.920]   but I'll try to get back to you
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.680]   if you'll have me out next week.
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:28.920]   We'll talk about it more in depth next week.
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:31.680]   (dramatic music)
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:34.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:36.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:39.480]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:43.680]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:46.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:49.480]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:52.080]   (upbeat music)
