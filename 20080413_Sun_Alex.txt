[00:00.000 --> 00:04.720]  1,300 soldiers and policemen who deserted or refused to fight in Basra have been dismissed
[00:04.720 --> 00:06.440]  by the country's government.
[00:06.440 --> 00:10.400]  Since the operation in Basra, government officials have revealed that about 1,000 members of
[00:10.400 --> 00:15.340]  Iraqi security forces have mutinied and in some cases handled over vehicles and weapons
[00:15.340 --> 00:16.340]  to militias.
[00:16.340 --> 00:17.960]  Here's Slobodan Leakich.
[00:17.960 --> 00:22.760]  Government troops are conducting sweeps through neighborhoods trying to find illegal weapons
[00:22.760 --> 00:28.240]  and ammunition and actually hunting for active criminals who have taken refuge in Basra.
[00:28.240 --> 00:31.960]  The International Monetary Fund and World Bank are wrapping up their spring meetings
[00:31.960 --> 00:36.920]  by looking at the effect the unfolding financial crisis is having on food and energy prices
[00:36.920 --> 00:38.680]  in developing countries.
[00:38.680 --> 00:43.280]  The president of the World Bank says it needs to respond to what he calls an immediate emergency
[00:43.280 --> 00:48.000]  by helping those countries improve health care, reduce malnutrition, and lower infant
[00:48.000 --> 00:49.200]  mortality.
[00:49.200 --> 00:52.080]  This is IRN-USA Radio News.
[00:52.080 --> 00:57.500]  Suriasis, the itching, flaking and irritation is painful, but the emotional suffering can
[00:57.500 --> 00:59.040]  be even more devastating.
[00:59.040 --> 01:02.560]  My body was so sore, my mind was so worn out, I could not sleep at night.
[01:02.560 --> 01:05.200]  I felt self-conscious, nobody knows what that flaking is.
[01:05.200 --> 01:07.680]  And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty.
[01:07.680 --> 01:09.180]  Oh, people know when I have this embarrassing.
[01:09.180 --> 01:12.040]  Of course I felt self-conscious, not very attractive to look at.
[01:12.040 --> 01:16.840]  The solution is new and improves SkinZinc Advanced, the number one OTC treatment for
[01:16.840 --> 01:17.840]  psoriasis.
[01:17.840 --> 01:19.840]  SkinZinc turned out to be the perfect answer.
[01:19.840 --> 01:24.640]  SkinZinc has changed my life the third day I saw that my psoriasis was disappearing.
[01:24.640 --> 01:27.440]  One week I noticed that the rashes on my arms were going away.

[01:50.480 --> 01:57.600]  Zimbabwean authorities say they will recount the votes from nearly 2,000 recent parliamentary
[01:57.600 --> 01:58.600]  races.
[01:58.600 --> 02:03.040]  The Sadron newspaper reports that the Zimbabwe electoral commission will conduct a full recount
[02:03.040 --> 02:07.000]  of the presidential and parliamentary ballots cast in 23 constituencies.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.320]  All but one of them were won by the opposition.
[02:10.320 --> 02:12.280]  This is British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
[02:12.280 --> 02:13.280]  They have voted.
[02:13.280 --> 02:15.640]  The presidential election results have not been announced.
[02:15.640 --> 02:18.600]  We cannot wait any longer for the announcement of these results.
[02:18.600 --> 02:21.880]  A power-sharing deal is being implemented in Kenya.
[02:21.880 --> 02:25.560]  President Moa Kibbaki has named his rival to be Prime Minister.
[02:25.560 --> 02:29.480]  The two men agreed in February to share power after weeks of deadly violence followed the
[02:29.480 --> 02:33.600]  country's disputed presidential election in December, and President Bush's national
[02:33.600 --> 02:38.400]  security adviser says the kind of quiet diplomacy that the U.S. is practicing is a better way
[02:38.400 --> 02:40.760]  to send a message to China's leaders.
[02:40.760 --> 02:44.800]  Stephen Hadley, appearing on the Sunday news show, says it would be a cop-out for countries
[02:44.800 --> 02:47.840]  to skip the opening ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics.
[02:47.840 --> 02:51.440]  For more news and analysis, log on to IRNNews.com.
[03:23.360 --> 03:27.760]  Former President Jimmy Carter is getting a cold reception in Israel.
[03:27.760 --> 03:29.040]  Here's Mark Levy.
[03:29.040 --> 03:32.600]  As President, Jimmy Carter brokered the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt.
[03:32.600 --> 03:36.600]  But in the 30 years since then, Carter has worn out his welcome in Israel.
[03:36.600 --> 03:41.520]  The cap was his recent book called Palestine, Peace Not a Party, charging that Israel is
[03:41.520 --> 03:46.840]  using the tactics of the old racist South African regime in dealing with the Palestinians.
[03:46.840 --> 03:50.360]  So Carter won't be meeting Israel's leaders while he's here this week.
[03:50.360 --> 03:54.360]  He will see Israel's ceremonial president, Shimon Peres, who is an obel-peace prize
[03:54.360 --> 03:56.560]  laureate like Carter.
[03:56.560 --> 03:57.560]  Mark Levy drew us to them.
[03:57.560 --> 04:02.240]  Pope Benedict is asking the faithful to pray for his upcoming visit to the United States.
[04:02.240 --> 04:09.800]  I ask you all to pray for the success of my visit so that there may be a time of spirit
[04:09.800 --> 04:12.400]  and renewal for all Americans.
[04:12.400 --> 04:15.480]  His first trip to the U.S. is Pope against Tuesday.
[04:15.480 --> 04:19.840]  He's scheduled to spend five days in Washington and New York and will give a speech at the
[04:19.840 --> 04:21.720]  United Nations.
[04:21.720 --> 04:26.040]  And Tiger Woods is starting the day six shots behind Trevor Emelman, who says he's excited
[04:26.040 --> 04:31.280]  about the chance to join Gary Player as a South African winner of the Masters.
[04:31.280 --> 04:37.200]  Gary's won this tournament three times and Ernie and Goose have come close so many times.
[04:37.200 --> 04:39.920]  Tim Clark has come close and Rory came close last year.
[04:39.920 --> 04:45.000]  So there's a few guys that have had a shot, so I count myself fortunate to be in this
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.720]  position and you know, I'm just going to give him my best shot.
[04:47.720 --> 05:16.200]  I'm Jody Jordan and that's news from the Information Radio Network.

[06:27.640 --> 06:30.880]  Now live from Austin, Texas.
[06:30.880 --> 06:33.360]  Here's Alex Jones.
[06:33.360 --> 06:38.800]  Hello, thank you for joining us.
[06:38.800 --> 06:45.080]  It is April 13th, 2000 and we're going to be live here for the next two hours on here
[06:45.080 --> 06:53.160]  Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central from upstate New York to San Diego, California.
[06:53.160 --> 07:00.160]  Coming to you from the studios of News Radio 590 KLBJ here in Austin, Texas.
[07:00.160 --> 07:06.360]  Summel casting not just on the Amon FM dial, but the internet at infowars.com.
[07:06.360 --> 07:11.160]  Many of our affiliates also restream the show.
[07:11.160 --> 07:15.440]  Global shortwave, WWCR and three different satellite systems.
[07:15.440 --> 07:22.080]  All right, I have been quite reflective the last few days just researching some of the
[07:22.080 --> 07:29.760]  different declassified government programs that are being carried out against the people
[07:29.760 --> 07:34.600]  of the planet, eugenics programs.
[07:34.600 --> 07:42.000]  I and my research of the last 15 years have learned that we are living in a false reality.
[07:42.000 --> 07:47.840]  And by false reality, I don't mean a false reality as intense as the matrix where you
[07:47.840 --> 07:55.760]  are having this virtual reality fed to your cerebral cortex by a group of supercomputers
[07:55.760 --> 08:04.840]  as you live out your life in a pod supplying heat to drive their systems.
[08:04.840 --> 08:10.760]  When I talk about a false reality, I'm talking about belief systems that we have been programmed
[08:10.760 --> 08:21.600]  with and I'm talking about a global shadow government or national security apparatus
[08:21.600 --> 08:26.480]  that has developed advanced technologies and has engaged in everything from government
[08:26.480 --> 08:32.480]  narcotics trafficking to banking and money laundering, underground bases, super weapons
[08:32.480 --> 08:40.640]  that make hydrogen bombs look like quaint paper swords.
[08:40.640 --> 08:44.960]  This is the type of information that I want to go over today and then of course take your
[08:44.960 --> 08:47.840]  calls on any subject you would like to discuss.
[08:47.840 --> 08:51.040]  We have tax day coming up.
[08:51.040 --> 08:59.040]  The congressional commission back in 1981 reported that not one cent of any tax money,
[08:59.040 --> 09:04.120]  any of the income tax money, goes to run the country and Ronald Reagan of course quoted
[09:04.120 --> 09:09.280]  that commission and put out his own statement saying the IRS should be abolished.
[09:09.280 --> 09:15.240]  The Internal Revenue Service, what an Orwellian term, they provide a service for you, goes
[09:15.240 --> 09:20.400]  to pay interest on the debt to the private banks that control the issuance of currency,
[09:20.400 --> 09:22.600]  credit, and liquidity.
[09:22.600 --> 09:31.760]  There are hundreds of other taxes that you pay, death taxes, social security taxes, property
[09:31.760 --> 09:41.520]  taxes, oil taxes, fuel taxes, real estate taxes, corporate taxes, on and on and on that
[09:41.520 --> 09:46.200]  do fund the government and all the horrible things government does.
[09:46.200 --> 09:50.440]  But you need to know that the income tax is in the communist manifesto.
[09:50.440 --> 09:51.440]  Go read it for yourself.
[09:51.440 --> 09:56.000]  Just type in the Google communist manifesto and you should read those 10 planks.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.280]  Everything our government's implementing, public school, open borders, gun control,
[10:01.280 --> 10:04.920]  a private central bank, income tax, go read it for yourself.
[10:04.920 --> 10:07.200]  Of course the private banks created it.
[10:07.200 --> 10:11.480]  It's actually not communism in the popular sense as Carol Quigley, the head of Georgetown
[10:11.480 --> 10:16.600]  political science, Bill Clinton's mentor wrote in Tragedy and Hope, the bankers created
[10:16.600 --> 10:22.840]  communism to con rebelling serfs in Europe back into slavery.
[10:22.840 --> 10:24.480]  They finance it.
[10:24.480 --> 10:26.440]  They want command and control systems.
[10:26.440 --> 10:32.560]  So know that when you pay your taxes, your taxes coming up in two days, that it goes
[10:32.560 --> 10:39.360]  to destroy America and the people devaluing our dollar, destroying our sovereignty, our
[10:39.360 --> 10:44.800]  borders, our name, are the individuals that bring you the IMF World Bank tax.
[10:44.800 --> 10:46.640]  And that is what it is.
[10:46.640 --> 10:47.640]  Okay.
[10:47.640 --> 10:53.320]  That said, we can discuss that as well at 877-590-5525 if you're listening to the station
[10:53.320 --> 10:54.920]  this originates out of.
[10:54.920 --> 11:01.560]  The mothership, 836-0590, I should say the flagship because that is the radio station
[11:01.560 --> 11:03.800]  I'm coming to you from.
[11:03.800 --> 11:05.640]  The flag is right here.
[11:05.640 --> 11:10.960]  The flag of resistance to tyranny, never surrendering.
[11:10.960 --> 11:16.760]  The flag of humanity against the social architects, the scientific dictatorship.
[11:16.760 --> 11:18.000]  Okay.
[11:18.000 --> 11:23.600]  I have the one before I get into the slave grid paradigm.
[11:23.600 --> 11:27.360]  Let me just give you some of the news we have today.
[11:27.360 --> 11:31.280]  The government is trying to wrap its mind around yours.
[11:31.280 --> 11:37.760]  Washington Post and it says that the brain scanners are going in nationwide scanning
[11:37.760 --> 11:41.160]  your brain.
[11:41.160 --> 11:44.800]  Another report here, government scientists propose that geoengineering earth's upper
[11:44.800 --> 11:48.240]  atmosphere and then admit they've already been doing it.
[11:48.240 --> 11:52.640]  In the last six months, thousands of government publications have admitted they are altering
[11:52.640 --> 11:53.640]  the atmosphere.
[11:53.640 --> 11:56.080]  There's no longer a debate about chemtrails.
[11:56.080 --> 11:59.640]  They just say the details are classified, shut up.
[11:59.640 --> 12:02.320]  They're having it basically added to the jet fuel by law.
[12:02.320 --> 12:03.640]  That way it's compartmentalized.
[12:03.640 --> 12:07.880]  The companies buying their jet fuel have nothing to do with it, it's just done.
[12:07.880 --> 12:13.760]  The nuclei is being entered into the atmosphere and they have darkened the earth by 20% according
[12:13.760 --> 12:14.760]  to NASA.
[12:14.760 --> 12:19.000]  They are terraforming us, altering the atmosphere.
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.440]  We can have a debate about this.
[12:20.440 --> 12:24.920]  It's kind of like they built the trans-Texas corridor but CNN and Fox, I have clips we
[12:24.920 --> 12:26.840]  played here, say it doesn't exist.
[12:26.840 --> 12:30.920]  There's a Texan, we're on several stations in Texas.
[12:30.920 --> 12:38.360]  You are driving along and you will see trans-Texas corridor signs by the state.
[12:38.360 --> 12:41.600]  You will see the highways, you will see them putting toll roads on.
[12:41.600 --> 12:45.600]  But for those outside the state, they just say it doesn't exist and they even transmit
[12:45.600 --> 12:49.200]  and broadcast TV programs saying it doesn't exist.
[12:49.200 --> 12:52.960]  Just like their chemtrails spraying us, putting poison in our water, everything else, it's
[12:52.960 --> 12:58.680]  all admitted but you can't get the public to admit it even when there's billboards.
[12:58.680 --> 13:02.240]  Because if they tell the yuppies it doesn't exist, they see the billboard and say, this
[13:02.240 --> 13:06.600]  toll road I just went on doesn't exist.
[13:06.600 --> 13:10.000]  I mean this is mass mind control, you're under mind control.
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.200]  The fact that I sound weird and extreme to you shows how you are in a false reality.
[13:15.200 --> 13:17.640]  You literally are programmed.
[13:17.640 --> 13:24.000]  You know I've told the story that I've never believed studying World War II and Nazi history
[13:24.000 --> 13:30.400]  read more than 30 books on the subject, I still call myself a novice, that the Nazis,
[13:30.400 --> 13:33.800]  that the general public didn't believe they were killing all these people.
[13:33.800 --> 13:37.440]  When our troops went in there and found all the death camps and millions of dead people,
[13:37.440 --> 13:40.640]  Germans said we didn't know, we didn't know and the troops would beat them up or drag
[13:40.640 --> 13:42.960]  them in front of the dead bodies and make them bury them.
[13:42.960 --> 13:45.360]  But I'm studying more history now, I know that is the truth.
[13:45.360 --> 13:48.960]  They were delusional just like us.
[13:48.960 --> 13:55.040]  You know there's been concentration camps in the United States since 1986.
[13:55.040 --> 14:01.640]  I wrote a book in 2002 with links and documents to the armies on the website, it's all public,
[14:01.640 --> 14:03.800]  but you don't choose to know.
[14:03.800 --> 14:15.880]  They're Americans in slave labor camps for I guess that's 20 plus years, 22 years.
[14:15.880 --> 14:21.920]  So this is the type of information we cover here.
[14:21.920 --> 14:25.720]  Now other folks out there will say well why are you still alive, this is all true, because
[14:25.720 --> 14:31.920]  the psychological dictatorship is so, the scientific dictatorship run by behavioral
[14:31.920 --> 14:40.960]  psychologists, they are in such total control that they basically believe that I am just
[14:40.960 --> 14:46.800]  a stimuli to test response and that I am a little toy or something, it just doesn't
[14:46.800 --> 14:49.000]  even matter to them.
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.200]  I mean you're already ingesting chemicals daily, put in the water supply, declassified
[14:54.200 --> 14:58.520]  by design to reduce your IQ by 20 points on average.
[14:58.520 --> 15:02.560]  It's even higher if you've been ingesting sodium fluoride since birth, which most of
[15:02.560 --> 15:03.560]  us have.
[15:03.560 --> 15:07.400]  And to the scientific dictatorship, this is the ultimate power, the ultimate control
[15:07.400 --> 15:12.080]  freak system because they're in control, you don't even know they're in control and
[15:12.080 --> 15:15.960]  they're poisoning you, they're brain damaging you, they're attacking you daily and you don't
[15:15.960 --> 15:17.840]  even know.
[15:17.840 --> 15:26.040]  This story out of the Washington Post says defense agency research projects, that's DARPA,
[15:26.040 --> 15:32.000]  Department of Defense, John Hopkins University and others are engaged in mass mind control
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.120]  operations, see they're now showing the slaves, they're now telling you, mainstream news admits
[15:37.120 --> 15:43.800]  mass chemtrailing of the population as chemicals are sprayed on you daily, I have the copy
[15:43.800 --> 15:47.440]  of the government textbook here where they tell the school kids how they're spraying
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.760]  them for their safety, see they introduce it to the children while they still deny to
[15:51.760 --> 15:59.560]  the adults because it is a big idea, a new world order, in the near future, Earth is
[15:59.560 --> 16:06.040]  dominated by a powerful government, it's known as the builder bird, put their objective
[16:06.040 --> 16:12.160]  being world domination, for thousands of years their dark order grew, now as they hail the
[16:12.160 --> 16:17.920]  birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is
[16:17.920 --> 16:25.840]  in hand, for the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown
[16:25.840 --> 16:30.760]  wide open, you will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda,
[16:30.760 --> 16:34.960]  Builders make great progress for the world, most people have no idea, they're not after
[16:34.960 --> 16:38.920]  money, they have all the money they need, they're after power, that's their after music, order

[16:47.280 --> 16:56.160]  On the average Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[16:56.160 --> 17:01.160]  to retire and live out their golden years, unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost
[17:01.160 --> 17:06.000]  of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
[17:06.000 --> 17:10.360]  line, is this a flaw free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[17:10.360 --> 17:15.480]  note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes, these questions
[17:15.480 --> 17:20.000]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.120]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[17:24.120 --> 17:29.120]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[17:29.120 --> 17:33.560]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900's to anyone who
[17:33.560 --> 17:40.840]  purchases this book, call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today, it's critical that the
[17:40.840 --> 17:48.000]  public be made aware of the system, call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237, that's
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.000]  1-800-686-2237.
[17:51.000 --> 17:58.440]  Greetings, my name is Dr. Bülvan Schacht with the White Paper Chronicles from the main
[17:58.440 --> 18:05.000]  polluted stream media, I'm here to expose a fraud and an all around un-American stinker.
[18:05.000 --> 18:10.320]  His name is Steve Schenk, his radio show called Fearless Radio, he says solution to all the
[18:10.320 --> 18:15.440]  craziness in America is just get independent and healthy, so you can be fearless of all
[18:15.440 --> 18:18.560]  of the scary stuff you're not supposed to know about.
[18:18.560 --> 18:27.160]  Stay away from this stinker on website eFoodsDirect.com, I warned you don't do eFoodsDirect.com,
[18:27.160 --> 18:35.920]  don't dial 800-605-5868 for this dangerous program, 800-605-5868, you've heard what happens
[18:35.920 --> 18:40.960]  to a brain on drugs, can you imagine what happens to a brain that has been shanked.
[18:40.960 --> 18:46.280]  This is Steve, we take your independence very seriously, come and find me on Fearless Radio,
[18:46.280 --> 18:52.840]  call 800-605-5868 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[18:52.840 --> 18:57.440]  It's a fact, since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United
[18:57.440 --> 19:01.760]  States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue, with never ending
[19:01.760 --> 19:06.120]  late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically
[19:06.120 --> 19:10.360]  impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[19:10.360 --> 19:14.720]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney backed program to legally
[19:14.720 --> 19:19.040]  eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecured debts which
[19:19.040 --> 19:21.180]  have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[19:21.180 --> 19:25.480]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[19:25.480 --> 19:27.600]  ending with nothing on your credit report.
[19:27.600 --> 19:31.240]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally
[19:31.240 --> 19:32.840]  eliminated their debt.
[19:32.840 --> 19:36.600]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life
[19:36.600 --> 19:37.600]  around.
[19:37.600 --> 19:46.600]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600, that's 877-943-8600 or visit FDRS.org.
[19:46.600 --> 19:49.240]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[19:49.240 --> 19:56.080]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[19:56.080 --> 19:58.560]  Are you tired of searching for great stock radio?
[19:58.560 --> 19:59.800]  Well search no more.
[19:59.800 --> 20:02.640]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[20:02.640 --> 20:08.800]  All right, we're back live and we've got loaded phone lines here.
[20:08.800 --> 20:12.200]  People like Mike and Jack disagree so we'll go to the head of the line.
[20:12.200 --> 20:17.440]  Your call is coming up later in the hour but I need to get now into this false reality
[20:17.440 --> 20:25.160]  and just skim the surface at first and then it's such a wide tapestry of social engineering,
[20:25.160 --> 20:30.760]  biological engineering, guinea pig testing going on against all of us, psychological,
[20:30.760 --> 20:35.360]  chemical in nature, genetic.
[20:35.360 --> 20:37.760]  But here's the story.
[20:37.760 --> 20:45.440]  Final agony of RFA volunteer killed by Sarin in Britain and it's the one in Guardian because
[20:45.440 --> 20:49.040]  I mentioned this the other day on radio and somebody emailed me and said where's the article?
[20:49.040 --> 20:53.520]  There are thousands of tests where they've killed US and British troops from the 50s
[20:53.520 --> 20:58.400]  right through to the 80s and then it's been classified since then where they would just
[20:58.400 --> 21:03.760]  march someone in and tell them go into this chamber and they'd nerve gas our troops, British
[21:03.760 --> 21:07.480]  troops, our government would, it's not our government, these criminals that run it, and
[21:07.480 --> 21:12.120]  the name of scientists and they would kill them and then dissect their bodies.
[21:12.120 --> 21:15.160]  Now that really wasn't about testing what nerve gas does with mammals.
[21:15.160 --> 21:19.600]  They knew it was sheep and cows and humans from other wars.
[21:19.600 --> 21:25.200]  It was done to test cadres of scientists and technicians that would be part of that to
[21:25.200 --> 21:27.200]  move on to other projects.
[21:27.200 --> 21:31.480]  That's why at the end of World War II, tens of thousands of Nazi scientists were brought
[21:31.480 --> 21:33.080]  into this nation.
[21:33.080 --> 21:39.520]  That's why most of the bio weapons labs, chemical weapons labs, NASA facilities are named after
[21:39.520 --> 21:45.280]  the Goddard Space Center from Goddard the Nazi or the Werner von Braun research laboratories,
[21:45.280 --> 21:47.360]  the head of the Nazi program.
[21:47.360 --> 21:51.960]  He became the head of all Nazi weapons development there during the war for a while and they
[21:51.960 --> 21:58.760]  were brought here and my uncle and mom remember when they lived here in Austin, their dad,
[21:58.760 --> 22:02.200]  my grandfather, said we got to go see Werner von Braun, he was into the NASA program, and
[22:02.200 --> 22:07.040]  these little kids, he took them down to see him speak at University of Texas.
[22:07.040 --> 22:12.880]  But the point is, is that they brought them here because they formed the cadres to form
[22:12.880 --> 22:19.520]  larger groups that would engage in this type of activity and so for the elite, because
[22:19.520 --> 22:23.440]  they're willing to do this, they believe that it's survival of the fittest, they're
[22:23.440 --> 22:27.680]  willing to do these psychopathic things so that makes them stronger than the rest of
[22:27.680 --> 22:28.680]  us.
[22:28.680 --> 22:33.120]  Those of us that don't kill innocents, cold bloodedly, they see as weak and sentimental
[22:33.120 --> 22:36.840]  and pathetic.
[22:36.840 --> 22:42.800]  Taking about 1996, there have been tens of thousands of admitted tests in this country,
[22:42.800 --> 22:49.160]  taking in the 40s, 50s, 50s, 70s, small children, foster care children, radiating them to death,
[22:49.160 --> 22:55.480]  the U.S. paid Israel to radiate 110,000 of their children, just type Israeli radiation
[22:55.480 --> 22:59.080]  test on children or ringworm children in the Google, you can hear about them frying kids
[22:59.080 --> 23:03.680]  in chambers, mall mainstream news, but you'll wonder why you never heard about it, just
[23:03.680 --> 23:06.000]  back of the paper here, back of the paper there.
[23:06.000 --> 23:09.480]  We take all these and integrate them in together in my film Endgame, well not all of them,
[23:09.480 --> 23:13.640]  just a few hundred or so, there's tens of thousands as I mentioned.
[23:13.640 --> 23:17.720]  You could spend the rest of your life just reading the ones that they admit they've done.
[23:17.720 --> 23:22.000]  Now it's all secret and we know they've intensified it all, but it's being done against general
[23:22.000 --> 23:27.720]  populations, but so understand, you think the government loves you, you think it's legitimate,
[23:27.720 --> 23:31.320]  you think it's good, you think it's taking care of you.
[23:31.320 --> 23:35.840]  It is a bunch of scientists on a complete power trip working for the big private banking
[23:35.840 --> 23:40.720]  families that own the planet that understand how important it is to have cutting-edge science
[23:40.720 --> 23:45.400]  and control the mass of humanity, and if you go to any major biology conference or any
[23:45.400 --> 23:49.680]  major climate conference or any major architecture conference, they just had one last week with
[23:49.680 --> 23:55.120]  Prince Charles here in Austin, it's all about how they got to kill 90% of us now, humans
[23:55.120 --> 23:59.880]  are bad, and most of you go, yeah, there are too many of us, see, it's such a mainstream
[23:59.880 --> 24:04.360]  view inculcated into you by the elite that you believe it, you just don't know why or
[24:04.360 --> 24:10.600]  where you even heard it, and so understand that any question about the government lying
[24:10.600 --> 24:14.920]  to us being run by crooks, I wish we just had boss-hog crooks running things.
[24:14.920 --> 24:18.480]  I wish they were just shipping the narcotics in as bait so that when you use them they
[24:18.480 --> 24:22.760]  can throw you in their private prisons building widgets in private prisons owned by the banks
[24:22.760 --> 24:24.080]  that launder the money.
[24:24.080 --> 24:30.080]  I wish that was the case because it's about 100 times deeper than that.
[24:30.080 --> 24:38.200]  Now there is the non-passive and passive aerosol programs, you can Google that, there are thousands
[24:38.200 --> 24:42.720]  of universities, government agencies that admit they are manipulating the weather, spraying
[24:42.720 --> 24:48.800]  the atmosphere with barium salts, aluminum salts, microbeads, and I kept wondering why
[24:48.800 --> 24:54.200]  none of this was in the news, I mean until 1996, condensation trails, ice crystals from
[24:54.200 --> 24:59.200]  jets would fly over my whole life, it disappeared in seconds if not two minutes, and they would
[24:59.200 --> 25:03.400]  form at 20,000 feet and higher and usually in the fall or winter, when it's cold there's
[25:03.400 --> 25:05.160]  more ice crystals.
[25:05.160 --> 25:09.920]  Now starting in 1996 they would suddenly form at 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 feet, they would
[25:09.920 --> 25:15.080]  fan out and get thousands of times their original size and form cloud banks, planes would fly
[25:15.080 --> 25:22.000]  right next to other planes and not leave trails, and by 2000 there were hundreds of websites
[25:22.000 --> 25:27.560]  and groups and scientists saying something's happening, NASA in 2004 admitted that jet trails
[25:27.560 --> 25:33.040]  had made the earth 20% darker and were reflecting solar radiation, now the earth's cooling,
[25:33.040 --> 25:37.440]  it was heating, the sun had really heated up to record levels, and some said oh they're
[25:37.440 --> 25:42.960]  doing that to save the earth, and then in major U.S. textbooks, this is used in thousands
[25:42.960 --> 25:50.200]  of school districts, it's science one essential interactions and it is put out by center point
[25:50.200 --> 25:56.880]  learning, and in this they teach the kids that chem trails are sprayed and added to
[25:56.880 --> 26:01.960]  the fuel, that chemicals are out of the fuel, you see that's what spring is, they put out
[26:01.960 --> 26:06.560]  tiny nuclei, it could be different types of nuclei, different materials, micro beads
[26:06.560 --> 26:10.640]  of glass, it doesn't matter, and then it forms clouds.
[26:10.640 --> 26:17.640]  The problem is barium salts and aluminum oxide is very bad for all life forms, especially
[26:17.640 --> 26:24.120]  mammals, and connected to all sorts of nervous system problems, breathing problems, so here
[26:24.120 --> 26:28.720]  it was in a story, chem trails sunscreen taught in schools, just google that and you can link
[26:28.720 --> 26:35.440]  through to the textbook and you can go read science one, this came out a few years ago.
[26:35.440 --> 26:42.160]  Now this week finally cybercast news, and then after that several other news wires picked
[26:42.160 --> 26:47.760]  it up, and we did a more detailed article at prismplanet.com on it, government scientists
[26:47.760 --> 26:53.000]  proposed geoengineering earth's upper atmosphere, research tied to increased reports of chem
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.440]  trails over past 10 years, or aerosol sprays, government scientists have been experimenting
[26:58.440 --> 27:02.960]  with the feasibility of bombarding the earth's upper atmosphere with microscopic class particles
[27:02.960 --> 27:06.680]  to dampen the effects of global warming, despite warnings that the process could damage the
[27:06.680 --> 27:10.960]  ozone layer, our admissions of government research into altering the earth's atmosphere
[27:10.960 --> 27:15.280]  tied to increased reports of chemical spraying over the past 10 years, according to documents
[27:15.280 --> 27:19.200]  obtained by cybercast news service under the freedom of information act, you can just go
[27:19.200 --> 27:24.160]  to these documents yourself, scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's DOE, Savannah
[27:24.160 --> 27:28.040]  River National Laboratory, again I found this six months ago thanks to listeners, we reported
[27:28.040 --> 27:32.840]  here but now it's out in the news, South Carolina are conducting limited tests for developing
[27:32.840 --> 27:36.880]  computer models of what might happen if a huge amount of particle matter is shot into
[27:36.880 --> 27:41.680]  the stratosphere, the particles consisting of very fine and special form of glass, porous
[27:41.680 --> 27:45.920]  walled glass microspheres it's a quote, would be able to absorb a certain amount of carbon
[27:45.920 --> 27:50.960]  oxide and would reflect sunlight away from earth, states the article, the project which
[27:50.960 --> 27:56.200]  began last year and ends April 30, this is closely tied to the idea by Nobel Prize winner
[27:56.200 --> 28:03.000]  Paul Critchin who proposed sending aircraft with 747s to dump huge quantities of sulfur
[28:03.000 --> 28:08.400]  particles into the far reaches of the stratosphere to cool down the atmosphere, he proposed this
[28:08.400 --> 28:16.360]  in 1995, it started in 1996, now the point is if you just Google these terms you'll be
[28:16.360 --> 28:22.800]  on all the universities department of energy, atomic energy agency, foreign governments
[28:22.800 --> 28:27.840]  and they'll just say we're spraying you and then you talk about it on the news and they
[28:27.840 --> 28:32.240]  say it doesn't exist, I mean it's like trans-Dexas corridor, there's billboards up everywhere
[28:32.240 --> 28:37.280]  they're doing it, CNN and Fox, I have clips where they say it doesn't exist, you're insane
[28:37.280 --> 28:43.560]  if you say it, I mean it's just amazing, we'll be right back, these stories are all on prisonplanet.com

[30:52.600 --> 30:57.600]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming
[30:57.600 --> 30:59.280]  a third-world nation.
[30:59.280 --> 31:03.520]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health
[31:03.520 --> 31:04.520]  solutions.
[31:04.520 --> 31:09.600]  Introducing Orgon Products, Orgon is the universal life force, the basic building block of all
[31:09.600 --> 31:11.600]  matter on the material planet.
[31:11.600 --> 31:16.120]  Non-electromaticin is the wave of the future dating back to the late 1800s.
[31:16.120 --> 31:20.840]  Wilhelm Reich Orgon used cloudbuster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic
[31:20.840 --> 31:23.440]  energy savings of up to 25%.

[31:52.320 --> 31:54.320]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[31:54.320 --> 31:58.880]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest
[31:58.880 --> 32:00.400]  hour there is hope.
[32:00.400 --> 32:03.480]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[32:03.480 --> 32:07.760]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[32:07.760 --> 32:09.280]  World Order master plan.
[32:09.280 --> 32:13.560]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[32:51.720 --> 33:00.920]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[33:39.760 --> 33:45.080]  We've had a national security dictatorship since 1947 when the government went underground.
[33:45.080 --> 33:47.080]  It's privately owned.
[33:47.080 --> 33:52.760]  All the rage in the 30s, 40s and 50s was eugenics, the people that set up the shadow government
[33:52.760 --> 33:54.520]  set it up to carry out eugenics.
[33:54.520 --> 33:58.880]  They admitted that in a lot of different textbooks and government documents.
[33:58.880 --> 34:04.960]  When top scientists like Dr. Eric Pionka right here at UT give speeches saying that 90 plus
[34:04.960 --> 34:09.280]  percent of the earth's population need to be killed, they get standing ovations at the
[34:09.280 --> 34:14.600]  Texas Academy of Sciences or when Pionka and others like Singer are over in London, it's
[34:14.600 --> 34:17.640]  the Royal Academy, they get standing ovations.
[34:17.640 --> 34:22.160]  And the news reports on this and Prince Philip and Ted Turner and Prince Charles, they all
[34:22.160 --> 34:24.840]  shoot their mouths off about it.
[34:24.840 --> 34:28.600]  And then the governments in England, Europe and the US have been caught thousands and
[34:28.600 --> 34:34.040]  thousands of times apiece spraying chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals on us.
[34:34.040 --> 34:37.280]  And then it's admitted that in the 20s and 30s they knew that sodium fluoride made you
[34:37.280 --> 34:41.640]  passive, made you dumb, ate holes in your brain, attacked all your major organs, fried
[34:41.640 --> 34:42.640]  your kidneys.
[34:42.640 --> 34:45.280]  You can go read all the studies at Nauseum.
[34:45.280 --> 34:51.040]  I mean these are cold blooded people who want you to be unhappy, who want you to be sick,
[34:51.040 --> 34:53.680]  who want you to be dumb.
[34:53.680 --> 34:58.120]  And then they just come out and admit, yeah, we've been spraying the atmosphere, manipulating
[34:58.120 --> 34:59.120]  the weather.
[34:59.120 --> 35:03.520]  Now everybody knows about cloud seeding and weather weapons or at least you should.
[35:03.520 --> 35:11.840]  In 2003 it was declassified the details of the weather weapons in Vietnam that have been
[35:11.840 --> 35:15.800]  living in the head of the Navy Weapons Laboratory.
[35:15.800 --> 35:22.000]  A meteorologist had deployed during the dry season when there was no rain.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.600]  Make it rain 10 feet in one day and flood the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[35:24.600 --> 35:30.200]  He led squadrons of jets, just a few squadrons could spray and cause that to happen.
[35:30.200 --> 35:33.120]  Before that he certified secretly with the Stanford Research Institute that they could
[35:33.120 --> 35:37.760]  create hurricanes, kill hurricanes, weaken them, make them stronger.
[35:37.760 --> 35:41.560]  And I interviewed him and he came on the radio show, then Fox News, CNN, everybody picked
[35:41.560 --> 35:42.560]  it up.
[35:42.560 --> 35:47.360]  I noticed that if any classified saw his name, called him up, he's like 86 years old at
[35:47.360 --> 35:48.360]  the time.
[35:48.360 --> 35:53.360]  He won't come on now, he said he was told to shut up, but I got him on coast to coast
[35:53.360 --> 35:56.120]  to AM, called him, got them to have him on.
[35:56.120 --> 35:57.560]  So that's the old news.
[35:57.560 --> 35:59.200]  People say could they control hurricanes?
[35:59.200 --> 36:03.080]  I don't know, US government certified mid 1960s.
[36:03.080 --> 36:07.360]  You can watch the video interview with him at PrisonPlanet.tv or just Google Alex Jones
[36:07.360 --> 36:12.240]  has been living in radio, the audio is all over the web, just been living in Alex Jones,
[36:12.240 --> 36:13.240]  Google it.
[36:13.240 --> 36:17.200]  I mean, everything I say is documented, but it isn't just that.
[36:17.200 --> 36:21.240]  They have been spraying biologicals on us.
[36:21.240 --> 36:23.760]  They killed Americans in 1968.
[36:23.760 --> 36:27.920]  Now use this example because it's one that's well known of thousands, it seems to be well
[36:27.920 --> 36:28.920]  known.
[36:28.920 --> 36:33.680]  68, they released biological weapon in the New York subways, won't say what.
[36:33.680 --> 36:40.680]  They had government doctors from the Pentagon pre-placed, was actually Fort Dietrich, Maryland,
[36:40.680 --> 36:45.720]  pre-placed at hospitals to, and they were even paying the hospitals, hospitals even
[36:45.720 --> 36:49.040]  knew to see how they would die when they came in.
[36:49.040 --> 36:50.160]  Let me explain.
[36:50.160 --> 36:53.920]  Little girls, little boys, mommies, daddies, grandma's going to work.
[36:53.920 --> 36:56.160]  Your government murders you.
[36:56.160 --> 36:57.160]  It isn't your government.
[36:57.160 --> 37:03.040]  Remember the Manhattan Project, half the scientists thought it was going to ignite the atmosphere
[37:03.040 --> 37:05.640]  and blow the earth up.
[37:05.640 --> 37:06.640]  The other half didn't.
[37:06.640 --> 37:09.480]  They detonated it and it didn't.
[37:09.480 --> 37:12.400]  Then half the scientists thought they detonated them in the upper atmosphere.
[37:12.400 --> 37:16.240]  It would cause a magnetic pulse and blow out all the transitions on the planet.
[37:16.240 --> 37:20.480]  So they detonated in one night over 100 of them out in New Mexico, hydrogen bombs in
[37:20.480 --> 37:21.640]  the early 60s.
[37:21.640 --> 37:26.000]  It did blow out transitions all over the country and the world, but not all of them.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.400]  It did though blow holes in the ozone layer.
[37:28.400 --> 37:30.400]  Now that's on the history channel.
[37:30.400 --> 37:31.400]  What's that movie?
[37:31.400 --> 37:32.400]  Trinity.
[37:32.400 --> 37:36.760]  The ultimate footage for two hours of the, the nukes and a bombs and hydrogen bombs
[37:36.760 --> 37:37.760]  going on.
[37:37.760 --> 37:39.040]  This is who we're talking about.
[37:39.040 --> 37:44.920]  Now the hardened heavy cyclotron in Switzerland, the biggest superconducting supercliter in
[37:44.920 --> 37:50.320]  the world on their own website, it's basically run by the Pentagon, but they built it in
[37:50.320 --> 37:51.320]  Europe.
[37:51.320 --> 37:54.400]  You go on there and they admit, well, yeah, we don't know what this could do and it could
[37:54.400 --> 37:59.920]  create a black hole and it could create a smashing these ions together in this collider.
[37:59.920 --> 38:03.560]  That's how we make hydrogen weapons and he could blow, blow the earth up, but we're just
[38:03.560 --> 38:05.200]  going to do it.
[38:05.200 --> 38:08.520]  They're on their website with little video intros saying, oh yeah, we're going to start
[38:08.520 --> 38:10.760]  doing tests every day with this.
[38:10.760 --> 38:12.240]  And this is how they make a bombs.
[38:12.240 --> 38:14.520]  This is how they made hydrogen bombs.
[38:14.520 --> 38:18.760]  They had those equations for a bombs in over 100 years ago.
[38:18.760 --> 38:21.000]  Max Plank and others came up with it.
[38:21.000 --> 38:22.720]  They just do it.
[38:22.720 --> 38:24.240]  They're mad scientists.
[38:24.240 --> 38:28.400]  There's a reason you have that cliched term.
[38:28.400 --> 38:35.760]  I remember reading the BBC 10 years ago in 1998 about human, animal, hybrid clones.
[38:35.760 --> 38:41.480]  I remember reading in scientific journals about how they had part chimpanzee, part humans
[38:41.480 --> 38:46.120]  in 2002 in the Washington Post and I'd come on air and I'd be called to cook.
[38:46.120 --> 38:51.200]  That was making it up when I had the Washington Post.
[38:51.200 --> 38:52.200]  It is insane.
[38:52.200 --> 38:57.680]  And they've got these DNA guns that randomly shoot other animal and insect DNA into human
[38:57.680 --> 39:03.320]  DNA, RNA, into the mitochondrial DNA that only the females pass.
[39:03.320 --> 39:08.060]  They admit it's giving rise to superviruses, bacteria, but they're doing it in level two
[39:08.060 --> 39:13.000]  laboratories instead of level fours.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.800]  They're starting a global tax on carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
[39:16.800 --> 39:21.400]  The global footprint tax is a tax on humanity for eugenics.
[39:21.400 --> 39:24.640]  Now, I've spent a lot of time on this.
[39:24.640 --> 39:28.880]  When we come back, I'm going to go to Mike and Jack and Skip and Richard and Lauren
[39:28.880 --> 39:33.360]  and Kathy in short order.
[39:33.360 --> 39:37.760]  But I wanted to just, instead of even reading you the Chemtrail article, I wanted to read
[39:37.760 --> 39:45.280]  you the Washington Post today and there's about 10 articles like this today I've got
[39:45.280 --> 39:47.760]  that are just as bad in the news.
[39:47.760 --> 39:51.560]  Today, you understand, this is today.
[39:51.560 --> 39:53.520]  There's so much of this I can't even get to at all.
[39:53.520 --> 39:57.200]  The government is trying to wrap its mind around yours.
[39:57.200 --> 40:02.000]  Imagine a world of streets lined with video cameras that alert authorities to any suspicious
[40:02.000 --> 40:03.000]  activity.
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.800]  A world where police officers can read the minds of potential criminals and arrest them
[40:06.800 --> 40:08.240]  before they commit any crimes.
[40:08.240 --> 40:12.640]  A world in which a suspect who lies under questioning gets nabbed immediately because
[40:12.640 --> 40:14.680]  his brain has given him away.
[40:14.680 --> 40:17.680]  Now, see, this is a throw it in your face article.
[40:17.680 --> 40:22.200]  I remember a New York Times article in 2002 saying every credit card purchase, every phone
[40:22.200 --> 40:26.240]  call, everything you do is tracked.
[40:26.240 --> 40:29.120]  They're throwing it in your face.
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.720]  Let's dissect that first paragraph.
[40:32.720 --> 40:36.600]  Imagine a world with streets lined with video cameras already here that alert authorities.
[40:36.600 --> 40:40.200]  You mean the criminals that run our government and abuse everybody and get away with everything?
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.320]  Just suspicious activity.
[40:44.320 --> 40:46.120]  Like demonstrating that they're banning everywhere.
[40:46.120 --> 40:49.520]  A world where police officers can read the minds of potential criminals and arrest them
[40:49.520 --> 40:51.360]  before they commit any crimes.
[40:51.360 --> 40:56.440]  You mean where they have quack computers, quackery, where they claim the computer shows
[40:56.440 --> 40:58.760]  that you've got evil intent in your mind.
[40:58.760 --> 41:01.760]  Five airports in the U.S. have had that since 2002.
[41:01.760 --> 41:11.760]  CBS, ABC News, it's in my films, it's in police state three total enslavement I made in 2002.
[41:11.760 --> 41:17.600]  They put passive MRIs that scan your brain and quote show increased brain activity associated
[41:17.600 --> 41:18.600]  with violence.
[41:18.600 --> 41:19.600]  It's quackery.
[41:19.600 --> 41:22.320]  It's just like they've proven lie detectors to be a fraud.
[41:22.320 --> 41:29.040]  It's just something to fool the slaves into, this says you're guilty.
[41:29.040 --> 41:30.040]  It's a total scam.
[41:30.040 --> 41:32.800]  See, so they're telling you it's coming.
[41:32.800 --> 41:37.040]  It's just like I tell you, oh, a national ID card is now here in the form of your state
[41:37.040 --> 41:41.480]  driver's license, federalized when we had it 12 years ago.
[41:41.480 --> 41:44.960]  So see a world where police officers, see why I can't cover everything because I can
[41:44.960 --> 41:47.320]  read each paragraph and give you all the propaganda.
[41:47.320 --> 41:51.480]  A world where police officers can read the minds of potential criminals and arrest them
[41:51.480 --> 41:52.760]  before they commit any crimes.
[41:52.760 --> 41:54.480]  See guilty until proven innocent.
[41:54.480 --> 41:58.680]  Forget guilty and proven innocent, guilty before anything ever happens.
[41:58.680 --> 42:02.680]  A world in which a suspect who lies under questioning gets nabbed immediately because
[42:02.680 --> 42:05.080]  his brain has given him away.
[42:05.080 --> 42:10.560]  Though that may sound a lot like 2002 movie, the minority report starring Tom Cruise and
[42:10.560 --> 42:13.720]  based on Philip K. Dick novel, I'm talking about science fiction here.
[42:13.720 --> 42:15.640]  I'm not talking about science fiction here.
[42:15.640 --> 42:18.920]  It turns out we're not so far away from that world.
[42:18.920 --> 42:22.400]  But does it sound like a safe place or a scary one?
[42:22.400 --> 42:24.400]  A cattle.
[42:24.400 --> 42:27.120]  They're putting hundreds of poisons in your water.
[42:27.120 --> 42:30.040]  They're murdering you and your family.
[42:30.040 --> 42:33.440]  Cancer's gone from one in 33 to one in three.
[42:33.440 --> 42:37.240]  Diabetes has gone from one in 3,000 to one in three.
[42:37.240 --> 42:39.880]  You're under black op Pentagon attack.
[42:39.880 --> 42:40.880]  You understand?
[42:40.880 --> 42:43.480]  I'm risking my life to bring you this information.
[42:43.480 --> 42:45.360]  You're under black op attack.
[42:45.360 --> 42:46.360]  You're under black op attack.
[42:46.360 --> 42:47.360]  We'll be right back.
[42:47.360 --> 42:48.360]  Hi, neighbor.
[42:48.360 --> 42:57.760]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who
[42:57.760 --> 43:00.200]  have prepared will have two regrets.
[43:00.200 --> 43:04.280]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas birthdays and vacations in order
[43:04.280 --> 43:06.680]  to store all the food possible.
[43:06.680 --> 43:10.600]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part time jobs to buy food.
[43:10.600 --> 43:14.240]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[43:14.240 --> 43:18.440]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[43:18.440 --> 43:22.560]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of
[43:22.560 --> 43:26.280]  money, we will still have two regrets.
[43:26.280 --> 43:30.280]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[43:30.280 --> 43:33.960]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[43:33.960 --> 43:38.480]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous
[43:38.480 --> 43:41.640]  decision that some of us will ever make.
[43:41.640 --> 43:52.320]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[43:52.320 --> 43:54.440]  My cracked heels were always my nemesis.
[43:54.440 --> 43:58.320]  All my life, I've had dry heels and rough, thick and skin on the soles and sides of
[43:58.320 --> 43:59.320]  my feet.
[43:59.320 --> 44:01.840]  Then my podiatrist told me about callix ointment.
[44:01.840 --> 44:06.440]  I am amazed how fast and efficient this product is at softening the hard spots.
[44:06.440 --> 44:10.720]  Since using callix, the split and cracked skin on my heels is gone, leaving them smooth
[44:10.720 --> 44:11.720]  and healthy looking.
[44:11.720 --> 44:14.880]  I am so grateful and no longer embarrassed in sandals.
[44:14.880 --> 44:18.160]  If you have dry cracked feet, I recommend callix ointment.
[44:18.160 --> 44:23.520]  You'll find it in the foot care section at drugstores, mass retailers and supercenters.
[44:23.520 --> 44:26.440]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[44:26.440 --> 44:29.160]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[44:29.160 --> 44:32.360]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[44:32.360 --> 44:38.360]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its
[44:38.360 --> 44:40.320]  purchasing power.
[44:40.320 --> 44:42.800]  Tell your answer at Mitus Resources.
[44:42.800 --> 44:46.520]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[44:46.520 --> 44:53.160]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[44:53.160 --> 44:54.160]  It's a fact.
[44:54.160 --> 44:58.080]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States
[44:58.080 --> 45:02.680]  create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue, with never ending late fees
[45:02.680 --> 45:05.280]  over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates.
[45:05.280 --> 45:09.760]  It has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to
[45:09.760 --> 45:10.760]  our creditors.
[45:10.760 --> 45:15.040]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney backed program to legally
[45:15.040 --> 45:19.200]  eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecured debts
[45:19.200 --> 45:21.480]  which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[45:21.480 --> 45:25.760]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[45:25.760 --> 45:27.680]  ending with nothing on your credit report.
[45:27.680 --> 45:31.600]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally
[45:31.600 --> 45:33.000]  eliminated their debt.
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.920]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life
[45:36.920 --> 45:37.920]  around.

[47:28.840 --> 47:35.920]  laughing, driving along in Kansas City, Austin, Texas, San Diego, Rochester, New York right

[47:43.400 --> 47:45.440]  and camps since 1986.
[47:45.440 --> 47:55.480]  Well, it was secret for a decade until 1996 and we told the world the minute it was declassified.
[47:55.480 --> 47:59.560]  They were beta testing those camps, again, it's very simple.
[47:59.560 --> 48:03.040]  You have an elite that believe there are too many of us that were bad and they're testing
[48:03.040 --> 48:08.120]  how to kill us, they're testing how to soft kill us and then tell the doctors how to misdiagnosis,
[48:08.120 --> 48:12.280]  the doctors don't know, they're just told what the American Medical Association says
[48:12.280 --> 48:16.720]  and then there's all this soft kill operation going on around us but see people are getting
[48:16.720 --> 48:20.400]  the news, people know AIDS is engineered and by the way, that isn't just a rumor, you
[48:20.400 --> 48:24.920]  can pull up the documents on that and they know about a lot of it.
[48:24.920 --> 48:33.120]  You're now finding out about it and 99% of us are not involved in this and the less than
[48:33.120 --> 48:38.440]  1% that are do it through their control of the financing and the government and they
[48:38.440 --> 48:43.600]  use national security and now the war on terror to cover up their steps.
[48:43.600 --> 48:48.920]  Here's the other news I've got, Oakland cops going door to door asking people to hand in
[48:48.920 --> 48:50.920]  their guns.
[48:50.920 --> 48:55.400]  What's happening nationwide, no warrants, they just demand to be let in.
[48:55.400 --> 48:59.440]  Lawyers move to get torture memo author John Yu, tried as a war criminal, that's the White
[48:59.440 --> 49:03.120]  House official that said sexually torturing children is okay.
[49:03.120 --> 49:05.760]  Don't read the memos for yourself, these are very nice people.
[49:05.760 --> 49:10.920]  EPIC obtains documents revealing federal role in state fusion centers, same thing I told
[49:10.920 --> 49:13.080]  you 10 years ago because I got the documents.
[49:13.080 --> 49:17.840]  The CIA runs all your local emergency management systems, they introduce them to the public
[49:17.840 --> 49:23.880]  as oh a traffic center, the police monitor traffic, then oh and during emergencies we
[49:23.880 --> 49:29.320]  do this and that and oh, but here it is the actual documents, mainstream news.
[49:29.320 --> 49:34.200]  New documents to tell FBI wiretapping on Americans emails, IM's and phone calls, Washington
[49:34.200 --> 49:38.320]  Post admits that it's a millions of Americans, no warrants, non-terror related, of course
[49:38.320 --> 49:39.320]  it's not.
[49:39.320 --> 49:43.920]  Think it's for Al Qaeda, that's the government, LCIA doesn't spy on itself, anti-terror laws
[49:43.920 --> 49:50.800]  use a spy on families, CPS uses it to take children, mainstream news, get ready for terror,
[49:50.800 --> 49:54.680]  warnings on your cell phone, billboards, everything flashing, you know, Ben Richards
[49:54.680 --> 50:00.600]  is loose, the running man, who loves you and who do you love, police remove Olympic torch
[50:00.600 --> 50:06.760]  bearer on orders of Chinese paramilitary thugs, Chinese troops attack U.S. citizens in U.S.,
[50:06.760 --> 50:11.640]  Chinese troops attack citizens in England, Chinese troops attack people in Paris, the
[50:11.640 --> 50:12.640]  French.
[50:12.640 --> 50:15.880]  I'll cover this later in the show, oh you think I'm joking, no it's all mainstream news
[50:15.880 --> 50:22.000]  just right here, Chinese troops in America, mm-hmm, see you're living in the twilight
[50:22.000 --> 50:28.640]  zone now, I just can't handle it anymore folks, I can't handle the denial anymore, I can't
[50:28.640 --> 50:36.760]  handle any of it, we're going into tyranny, they only leave me around because if they
[50:36.760 --> 50:45.840]  kill me it'll be too obvious because I'm too vocal, wow, and all the stupid black
[50:45.840 --> 50:50.040]  uniformed servants of this evil as it unfolds, you've been implanted with the cancer viruses
[50:50.040 --> 50:53.160]  in your vaccines, you've been implanted with the mercury, you've been implanted with the
[50:53.160 --> 50:58.200]  chemicals, but you just don't care, you think you're on the winning team, it was just a
[50:58.200 --> 51:02.800]  now what I say, I understand, I understand, your kids aren't even worth it to you to check
[51:02.800 --> 51:07.120]  out what I'm saying, just go ahead and give them the fluoride water, go ahead and give
[51:07.120 --> 51:11.480]  them the shots, go ahead and give them your cancer, go ahead and do, you know the Nazis
[51:11.480 --> 51:15.960]  really won ladies and gentlemen, because the Nazis weren't even the Nazis, the Nazis got
[51:15.960 --> 51:22.240]  what they, their whole mindset from the US and from England, where eugenics was developed,
[51:22.240 --> 51:26.760]  you know the Olympic rings were drawn by Hitler, the Olympic torch run was done by Hitler,
[51:26.760 --> 51:32.120]  the first major Olympics was in 36, resurrected from Greece, which was where eugenics came
[51:32.120 --> 51:36.760]  from, go, go to the encyclopedia and look up eugenics and it will say, the Greek idea
[51:36.760 --> 51:43.680]  of the God like man, or eternal youth is its root translation, but then it expands out
[51:43.680 --> 51:49.120]  to mean the eternal youth is what the gods have, immortality, and you know if you watch
[51:49.120 --> 51:54.000]  movies like 300 that are exaggerated, but they did kill any babies that had a blemish
[51:54.000 --> 51:58.560]  of any type, you know that was eugenics, the strongest, the Spartan, and then Plato wrote
[51:58.560 --> 52:03.380]  about how they would cull the mass of slaves and all the rest of it, now they use different
[52:03.380 --> 52:09.200]  layers of education to dumb down, have the hierarchical mass, that's what 2,500 years
[52:09.200 --> 52:17.400]  ago, 2,450 something years ago, but you won't look it up and find out, no you're not going
[52:17.400 --> 52:22.720]  to, you're gonna be a good little slave aren't you, well some of you are gonna listen, okay
[52:22.720 --> 52:26.920]  some folks disagree, now calls until the end of the show when I get into gun confiscation
[52:26.920 --> 52:33.440]  going on nationwide, they didn't triple the BATF, Bush didn't triple that because he wanted
[52:33.440 --> 52:40.720]  to suck its thumb, the grandson of the head Nazi agent in the US is a good agent of the
[52:40.720 --> 52:46.640]  new order, he's been very effective, great leadership, okay here comes Hillary and Obama
[52:46.640 --> 52:53.080]  on their heels or McCain, doesn't matter, they're all anti-guns, so get ready, get ready, okay
[52:53.080 --> 53:04.080]  let's go ahead and go to Jack in New York, says he disagrees, go ahead Jack, well first
[53:04.080 --> 53:08.640]  of all the reason why I disagree because you know I think you're betraying America, I mean
[53:08.640 --> 53:13.760]  you're bringing America for everything, I mean you're saying you know the government
[53:13.760 --> 53:17.120]  is playing for 9-11 and this, that and the other thing, you know I actually don't believe
[53:17.120 --> 53:23.920]  that, and I bet you think I'm lying about how the government tens of thousands of times
[53:23.920 --> 53:29.040]  has sprayed lethal and semi-lethal, toxic, chemical, biological and radiologicals on
[53:29.040 --> 53:33.440]  the American people, so I don't believe that, I don't believe that at all, well hey, hey
[53:33.440 --> 53:40.760]  I tell you what, you can get bonded and if you want to make a $10,000 wager then we can
[53:40.760 --> 53:45.720]  make that wager but you won't put your money where your mouth is and you know I'll meet
[53:45.720 --> 53:49.920]  you in Vegas, you can bring 10 of your stupid friends and they can all bet me $10,000, we'll
[53:49.920 --> 53:54.480]  go where it's legal and again I'm not a betting man, I know you won't take it because in your
[53:54.480 --> 54:00.160]  gut you know I'm telling you the truth and we'll just see what happens, you see I wish
[54:00.160 --> 54:06.400]  that it wasn't true that this is all going on sir, do you think I made it up about them
[54:06.400 --> 54:10.800]  bringing tens of thousands of Nazis over here to help run every major agency?
[54:10.800 --> 54:15.840]  Well yes because you know obviously you know I have a friend who says you know you didn't
[54:15.840 --> 54:22.240]  need some research from these donors from England, pardon me, as you didn't need research
[54:22.240 --> 54:27.720]  from these two guys from England, that's what I heard about it, research from two guys,
[54:27.720 --> 54:32.600]  it's totally admitted mainstream information that tens of thousands of Nazi top scientists
[54:32.600 --> 54:39.040]  and SS officers were brought over here to be in the CIA, NASA, Department of Energy, just
[54:39.040 --> 54:45.760]  everything and you're just saying I'm making that up, yes, okay, but you won't bet me
[54:45.760 --> 54:55.960]  about that will you, excuse me, see you, I shouldn't be mean to you, your mom didn't
[54:55.960 --> 55:02.320]  breastfeed you did she, so what, did your mother breastfeed you, what are you talking
[55:02.320 --> 55:08.280]  about, your brain, your brain, your brain can be, no no no, I mean your brain will be
[55:08.280 --> 55:15.720]  about 25 to 30 percent smaller if your mother doesn't breastfeed you, you know mammals feed
[55:15.720 --> 55:24.560]  their young, a fatty substance filled with complex fats and sugars, it's called milk
[55:24.560 --> 55:28.680]  and I mean I'm not being mean, you're just retarded sir, I mean that's, I mean as if
[55:28.680 --> 55:33.200]  your mother not breastfeeding you on top of it you have a small brain, I'm not joking
[55:33.200 --> 55:37.360]  this isn't funny, I mean I mean you know people are laughing it sounds like I'm being funny
[55:37.360 --> 55:41.920]  I'm not, it's very sad, this young man's mother didn't breastfeed him, I bought him
[55:41.920 --> 55:47.280]  dollar and he got fluoride and everything else they put in there, I mean he's got a
[55:47.280 --> 55:53.040]  tiny little brain, that's why everybody's getting Alzheimer's, have you heard how they
[55:53.040 --> 55:59.640]  have early onset at 30, 40 now of Alzheimer's and then they go in there and they admit it's
[55:59.640 --> 56:06.360]  plaques of heavy metals and chemicals and fluoride, I mean listen we're a nation of
[56:06.360 --> 56:13.240]  drones, the government told us that hey moms you don't need to give your babies milk anymore
[56:13.240 --> 56:17.160]  and they can't, you can't, even if it's the best formula out there you can't give babies
[56:17.160 --> 56:23.920]  the fats they need that form the brain, I've read the studies, I've got time to take one

[57:04.080 --> 57:09.120]  on government websites and legislation and they'll say no Nazi scientists were brought
[57:09.120 --> 57:12.140]  over here, they'll say there were no atomic soldiers, they'll say they didn't radiate
[57:12.140 --> 57:16.800]  foster children, they'll say there was no Tuskegee experiment with black men, they'll
[57:16.800 --> 57:20.720]  just say I'm a liar and hey, you know they choose not to believe the government ships
[57:20.720 --> 57:27.280]  the drugs in, they choose to believe in the Tooth Fairy, well I choose to believe in reality,

[1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:04.360]  edward fondic the director of national center for health statistics
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:07.640]  supposedly my phone number was selected by uh... random
[1:12:07.640 --> 1:12:11.200]  chance because they need to ask all about the vaccinations in our children
[1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:12.200]  health
[1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:15.240]  some household may be asked questions about the health services their children
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:16.400]  need or use
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:19.680]  if we have a child between eighteen and thirty five please have all their
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:21.240]  immunization records
[1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:24.480]  in front of you when they and let me stop and say what's happening in two
[1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:25.880]  thousand
[1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:29.560]  they started sending out thirty five forty five sixty nine
[1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:31.600]  and plus the different ones
[1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:35.240]  questionnaires and saying it's the law you gotta answer these whenever american
[1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:39.160]  has a fifth amendment you don't have to answer the census if they add all those
[1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:40.240]  other things to it
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:44.000]  it's a total felony every time they send it out threatening by law you've got to
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:44.520]  do it
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:48.400]  and now they have hundreds of agencies demanding everyone fill out reports on
[1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:49.200]  themselves
[1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:52.000]  and it's just all part of the this this tyranny we live in
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:53.080]  and one other thing
[1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:56.720]  if you happen to work for the federal government now they want you to register
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:13:00.160]  on the website and every single time you engage in any kind of
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:03.520]  physical activity you've got to report it to the government for
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:07.040]  some kind of contest on on our good health well that's how they introduce it
[1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:08.520]  to you that's eugenics
[1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:11.560]  where if you don't exercise and they have a record of it and don't need to
[1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:12.840]  quote right foods
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:14.440]  you're going to be denied health care
[1:13:14.440 --> 1:13:18.040]  just type in elderly to be denied health care in u.s.
[1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:21.640]  under hillary plan and it's them saying it's not us saying it like we're
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:24.680]  attacking her they say you're not going to get health care it's already that
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:25.600]  way in england
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:27.360]  it's bioethics boards
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:31.320]  which is the new term of eugenics after hitler embarrassed the eugenics is
[1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:32.560]  in forty six
[1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:35.120]  the international eugenics society met
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:40.320]  and change their name to bioethics thank you alex and uh... endgame is

[1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:45.360]  all in the endgame
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:48.560]  i could kind of go along with the stuff and shut up water down when i'm doing
[1:13:48.560 --> 1:13:49.360]  and
[1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:52.440]  and then and then just go ahead and you know let him keep killing everybody
[1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:55.120]  uh... or i could risk my life and my family and everything just go ahead and
[1:13:55.120 --> 1:13:56.680]  let you know the truth

[1:20:08.920 --> 1:20:10.080]  around the office
[1:20:10.080 --> 1:20:14.240]  during the radio show friday
[1:20:14.240 --> 1:20:19.400]  watching chinese troops in san francisco manhandle american citizens
[1:20:19.400 --> 1:20:22.120]  and i said you know this whole things degenerate
[1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:24.360]  it was a
[1:20:24.360 --> 1:20:27.920]  greek exercise of eugenics to show who the superman was
[1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:30.560]  who was related to hercules
[1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:33.680]  and then that's where all the nazi ideas and the rest of it came from
[1:20:33.680 --> 1:20:36.480]  i was talking about how hitler in thirty six
[1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:39.880]  uh... started the torch run he drew the rings he drew the
[1:20:39.880 --> 1:20:42.880]  the uh... where the flames should look
[1:20:42.880 --> 1:20:45.560]  and
[1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:49.600]  then later i come walking back from doing some uh... other work in trades like
[1:20:49.600 --> 1:20:52.560]  on that it was just what blitzer was just saying that i didn't see it swing
[1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:54.400]  your microphone around i should have told you
[1:20:54.400 --> 1:20:57.560]  swing your microphone around and uh...
[1:20:57.560 --> 1:21:00.480]  but see people will say what i'm saying this doesn't exist
[1:21:00.480 --> 1:21:04.760]  and when they see it on the news they'll say oh it does exist but it's good
[1:21:04.760 --> 1:21:06.320]  but
[1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:09.640]  the point is they have chinese secret police the same ones that arrest people
[1:21:09.640 --> 1:21:10.080]  and
[1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:14.000]  kill them and take their organs in china that that's in the news
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:17.640]  and they beat people up they beat up brits americans french i've got all the
[1:21:17.640 --> 1:21:19.720]  new articles like ten of america
[1:21:19.720 --> 1:21:23.560]  and on the police take their orders and there's no free speech and
[1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:28.040]  uh... in an olympic runner pulls out of to bet and flag they tackle them
[1:21:28.040 --> 1:21:30.600]  or they don't hold it up high enough there's video them shoving them and
[1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:32.840]  giving them orders americans
[1:21:32.840 --> 1:21:36.400]  i mean we're slaves ladies and gentlemen you need to understand that
[1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:37.800]  uh... let's go ahead and go up
[1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:39.840]  go ahead try you said you saw what blitzer
[1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:43.600]  oh yeah i just saw a wolf reporting on it and he went on to say how
[1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:47.960]  the torch was run through all of the countries that hitler would soon invade
[1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:52.000]  for uh... during the war at well every major city uh... with this whole
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.880]  thing that you know i hear the reporters upholding all we just
[1:21:54.880 --> 1:21:57.800]  we just want to celebrate the olympics i mean we're celebrating
[1:21:57.800 --> 1:22:01.640]  and we're protecting as something that was created by hitler i mean i want to
[1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:02.920]  explain everybody
[1:22:02.920 --> 1:22:05.320]  the modern one was created by hitler exactly
[1:22:05.320 --> 1:22:07.080]  but more than that
[1:22:07.080 --> 1:22:10.720]  it is the celebration of the new world order religion
[1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:13.640]  which is eugenics

[1:33:07.840 --> 1:33:15.480]  talk to mark in austin you're on the air sir hello yes wanted to bring up
[1:33:15.480 --> 1:33:19.880]  another point with the vaccines and autism come across a number of research
[1:33:19.880 --> 1:33:26.280]  studies showing 70 to 90 percent of these kids have specific blood type and many
[1:33:26.280 --> 1:33:31.120]  of these mothers beginning in 1968 were giving brogame injections when the
[1:33:31.120 --> 1:33:36.880]  mother and fetus blood types were mismatched and those injections turns
[1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:41.120]  out contain thimerosal and they bumped this up in the 80s and many other
[1:33:41.120 --> 1:33:45.120]  countries were not doing this and I keep coming oh japan for more than a
[1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:50.400]  decade has banned giving under a two-year-old vaccines japan said there's
[1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:55.480]  no doubt but but we talk a lot about mercury the thimerosal you know that's
[1:33:55.480 --> 1:33:59.880]  its its technical name the type of mercury solution they put in there but
[1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:04.880]  and so they hide under that name and others but a lot of it almost every
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:09.000]  person that has crones and this is mainstream literature they find that
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:13.600]  it's from the measles or several other shots where a live virus and it attacks
[1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:17.480]  the gut and then gets into the intestines and then causes autoimmune
[1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:22.040]  responses so and they also try to say well why is it mainly boys well boys
[1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:26.520]  tend to not have a gene turned on that makes their blood brain barrier same
[1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:30.800]  type tissues you have in the guts allow these metals and things to cross over
[1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:35.840]  easier right but the federal court just ruled last month that mercury in
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:40.800]  vaccines is that does cause autism well it's not only the vaccines the kids are
[1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:45.240]  receiving but also the expected mothers nowadays are giving tons of extra
[1:34:45.240 --> 1:34:48.960]  injections for for who knows what also until this became public in the last
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:53.960]  decade six or seven years really almost all of the eye solution had the
[1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:59.360]  merisol mercury for your contacts now about half of it because my wife has
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:03.520]  contacts she'll send me honey go get me this you know at night and I'll drive
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:06.920]  out doing my honey dish and I can look around and find the one that doesn't say
[1:35:06.920 --> 1:35:10.400]  their merisol and half the time I'm you know we're on a road trip or something I
[1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:13.400]  forget and by the wrong thing and it's got mercury in it I got to take it back
[1:35:13.400 --> 1:35:17.920]  thank you so much sir great point let's go ahead now and take another call
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:22.760]  Jennifer in Florida you are on the air
[1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:29.400]  hello Jennifer you're listening to your radio hi Alex how you doing good I'm
[1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:33.360]  in Fort Myers Florida I've I've been listening to your show now for about two
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:39.360]  years I bought your CDs power storm and martial law and I received my 9-11 was
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:43.760]  an inside job sticker I put it on the back of my truck got a lot of crap for
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:48.840]  it but I also got a lot of thumbs up and a lot of beeps and I just want to say
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:54.600]  that the Olympic torch was lit by the mother mother flame in 1936 and Hitler
[1:35:54.600 --> 1:35:58.840]  is the one that lit the mother flame so every time we light our Olympic torches
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:03.120]  it's off the mother flame from 1936 the one that Hitler yeah yeah I forgot that
[1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:07.240]  part but the caller called in just said I'm a liar see that matter what we say
[1:36:07.240 --> 1:36:10.160]  now people are asleep and they just don't want to wake up because then they
[1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:14.120]  have to realize the ugly truth of it all and that we can lie to but but it's not
[1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:18.080]  just that Hitler happened to invent all this modern system the age he liked it
[1:36:18.080 --> 1:36:21.760]  because the ancient Greeks believed in exterminating the other races and I'm
[1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:25.000]  not knocking the Greeks but we're taught they were all friendly Spartans had to
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:31.240]  basically murder one of the lesser tribe members okay man you're doing a
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:35.200]  great job and people are going to wake up sooner or later for them it's going to
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:38.400]  be later and it's going to be too late but we're preparing we're storing food
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:42.160]  we're trying to wake people up it's a hard job but we're sticking with it
[1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:45.400]  anyway and you just keep doing what you're doing and fighting a good fight
[1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:48.600]  and we're here right behind it thank you you know I don't know the global is
[1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:52.600]  going to set off a nuke release bird flu whatever they're going to do they're
[1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:55.320]  gearing up for it and they've done things in the past so don't think they
[1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:59.140]  won't do it in the future and it's key that those of us understand what's
[1:36:59.140 --> 1:37:03.000]  going on the eugenics world we live in and how we're under a scientific system
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  see under national security hundreds of underground bases hundreds of underground
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:10.480]  railways that's declassified that they have them they just won't say what's
[1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:14.760]  under there all these secret weapons all this advanced technology all these
[1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:24.480]  life extension systems all of it and we need to understand that we don't know
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:28.320]  what's going on what we know is so horrible it's hard to believe can you
[1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:32.320]  imagine what we don't know they admit they're spreading and manipulating the
[1:37:32.320 --> 1:37:35.800]  atmosphere they admit now they're adding stuff to the jet fuel which is
[1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:39.000]  perfect they just under regulations make them add the stuff to it the
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  companies just follow the regulations and it's done God help us God help us
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:48.840]  let's go ahead and take another call Harvey in Florida you're on the air sir
[1:37:48.840 --> 1:37:54.040]  welcome hey Alex how you doing today just flipping out man flipping out you're
[1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:57.240]  not flipping out like you were last week you really flipped out last week that's
[1:37:57.240 --> 1:38:01.320]  good we need we need to we need to get get shaken out of our comfort zone and
[1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:07.120]  realize this is serious it's very serious Alex it's very serious you know I've been
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:10.520]  wondering like a lot of people ask you how come they haven't killed you yet when
[1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:16.040]  I had a radio show one of my friends was a federal judge told me he says well
[1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:20.440]  they like to have somebody they could leave around the point at and say you
[1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:24.280]  know it's a free country you see Alex Jones is still talking but I think it's
[1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:28.880]  much more than that I think today I hit on it what they do is they use it he was
[1:38:28.880 --> 1:38:32.600]  a 10 a test bed Alex the people are so brainwashed that they don't even
[1:38:32.600 --> 1:38:37.520]  recognize the truth when they hear it that the brainwashing is complete sir
[1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:44.560]  that's they report headquarters I mean it really is but I mean I keep making a
[1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:48.040]  big deal of this I played it a few weeks ago and then again a few months ago when
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:52.880]  it happened Fox and singing in said Ron Paul is insane it was basically the same
[1:38:52.880 --> 1:38:58.720]  script he believes in a NAFTA highway in a trans-Texas corridor the trans-Texas
[1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:02.880]  corridor doesn't exist same thing on two channels I caught then we went and got
[1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:06.880]  the clips on YouTube I found them on YouTube and put them up I mean the
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:10.480]  trans-Texas corridor it's billboards everywhere they're putting toll roads in
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:14.080]  it and they just say it doesn't exist and the public says those signs don't
[1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:19.600]  exist they have 5,000 people lying to every person like you that is to tell
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:24.640]  the truth so that you're out gunned but the funny thing is that you out do them
[1:39:24.640 --> 1:39:28.120]  with all their billions and all their paid students and all their lives you
[1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:32.640]  out do them you and you will see a small crew out to them a hundred but why did
[1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:37.240]  their stooge is I mean people I mean here's an example you know the IMF puts
[1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:39.800]  out a report saying and the World Bank puts out a report saying they both did
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:43.600]  it last well we're so upset about there's not enough food the food prices
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:47.440]  are exploding their shortages but then I have State Department of Random 200 I
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:51.760]  have the IMF World Bank memorandums from the 60s and 70s and 80s I have the club
[1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:56.680]  of Rome memorandum to the World Bank it's in my film it's mainstream news where
[1:39:56.680 --> 1:40:02.040]  they are engineering food crises by design and they say all of our policies
[1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:06.360]  are to exterminate the third world and cause our main weapon is food crises and
[1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:10.640]  funding both sides of tribal groups to kill each other and then I read the
[1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:14.880]  hundred-point plan is reported even by the BBC and Greg Palace when we got the
[1:40:14.880 --> 1:40:19.320]  IMF documents in 2002 when Joseph Sticklet's quit over it and it talks
[1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:23.280]  about how they engineer this and then I got to hear them on the news the public
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:27.160]  thinks they're there to help you get the IMF is getting together this weekend
[1:40:27.160 --> 1:40:30.760]  to solve that food problem for the world so we're very good hands and Alex I
[1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:34.440]  want to leave you with that a comedy a little bit of comedy maybe just a light
[1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:40.000]  you know but Alberto Gonzalez since he he left the employment there in the
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:43.400]  State Department is having a little trouble finding work you hear about that
[1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:49.600]  was in today's paper yeah when he left as the former AG and John you is about
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:53.920]  to be indicted in several European countries I mean he wrote public memos
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:59.120]  saying they can base I'm not gonna stay on air what they said it's sexual abuse
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:02.960]  of children I mean that's what I mean now now that that's a behavioral
[1:41:02.960 --> 1:41:06.840]  psychologist that went too far because they came out and said we're torturing
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:10.480]  yeah we torture kids in front of their parents like we would buy that now the
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:14.360]  people said no so they're getting ready to burn you I mean why do you think they
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:18.760]  put those memos out about torturing kids I don't know but I mean but this story
[1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:22.640]  today is supposed to take pity on Gonzalez that day he's going hat in hand
[1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:27.160]  to the law firms submitting his resume I wonder what his resume reads will torture
[1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:31.680]  children will drop bombs on innocent women and children will lie to the
[1:41:31.680 --> 1:41:35.960]  Congress is that the ball on his resume it's in Calix I think that's probably all
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:39.800]  on his resume yeah but see that's the problem we heap all the blame on him and
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:44.400]  I agree is evil and then the puppeteers behind the scenes you know Hillary comes
[1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:49.440]  in Bush goes out or Obama or whoever comes in and then another set of shark
[1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:53.360]  teeth roll forward and then we learn to hate that set of shark teeth and then
[1:41:53.360 --> 1:41:57.080]  another set rolls forward and we never focus on the shark we always focus on
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:42:02.160]  its teeth but I know you know that but but I mean any any points on that Harvey
[1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:07.800]  well Alex you know I consider this the people that work with George Bush senior
[1:42:07.800 --> 1:42:13.120]  I believe that's where the evil emanates it is young and we should have driven
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:18.000]  the stakes through their hearts because they keep coming back from the dead well
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:22.140]  politically with it's it's it's just hell on earth his father was the top
[1:42:22.140 --> 1:42:28.240]  Nazi agent in the US that's mainstream news it's just it's all I just wish I
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:31.880]  could have a good life but instead everything's fried the future is very
[1:42:31.880 --> 1:42:36.600]  dark we could wake up we could stop at any time but the public just can't
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:40.200]  believe it it's too scary to believe it so a lot of you're gonna have to die
[1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:43.200]  we'll be right back
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:52.880]  one is all around our beloved Republic is on her knees the forces of globalism

[1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:52.520]  hi Alex I was actually calling in regard to a survey that I was called about and
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:57.520]  I usually hang up on those people but I wasn't really busy at the time and I
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:56:02.760]  figured I'd see what kind of questions they would ask me and it was a traffic
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:08.960]  and car survey but three of the questions one of them was how important
[1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:17.960]  was terrorism to me another one was how important how important was how many
[1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:22.280]  police are on the street and did I think that we needed more police on the
[1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:26.480]  street and I answered no to both of those questions and I told them that you'll be
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:31.960]  removed from the survey they'll say everyone wants it well I told them that
[1:56:31.960 --> 1:56:37.560]  terrorism was the least important issue to me in comparison see that's a
[1:56:37.560 --> 1:56:43.040]  control paradigm one of you said it 90% of its fake see but they go ahead good
[1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:47.880]  job go ahead and another question I wanted to ask you was what is the
[1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:53.880]  significance of the Sun Cross to the Matthew and also I've heard that in 2012
[1:56:53.880 --> 1:56:58.440]  a lot of scientists are saying that they expect there to be a solar flare and
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:02.960]  that that's the reason that the ancient people built all of their you know I
[1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:05.880]  don't know I don't know but the globalists are to the occult they
