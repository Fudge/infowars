[00:40.720 --> 00:49.080]  Jones you went and built yourself most unbelievable studio studio number four
[00:49.080 --> 00:54.840]  here at the Info Wars world headquarters and we did it as they were
[00:54.840 --> 01:04.920]  trying to shut us down and censor us off the internet total victory so welcome
[01:04.920 --> 01:09.080]  into the Alex Jones show I am filling in for Alex today but we will be hearing
[01:09.080 --> 01:15.240]  from Alex on a couple things and folks I've seen the preview you're not gonna
[01:15.240 --> 01:23.400]  want to miss this yes Alex Jones had a one-on-one confrontation with Hillary
[01:23.400 --> 01:31.360]  Clinton and we have the documents so we will be airing that coming up here
[01:31.360 --> 01:36.400]  shortly but I've got a stack of news and going through the news today listening
[01:36.400 --> 01:43.920]  to the Democrats speak at South by Southwest which is here in town seeing
[01:43.920 --> 01:52.200]  how they're responding to the Ilhan Omar situation it really shows you where
[01:52.200 --> 02:01.920]  the Democrats are at politically they have no identity except hate Trump that's
[02:01.920 --> 02:10.120]  literally their only identity as we have floating cameras blocking other cameras
[02:10.120 --> 02:14.360]  we have so many cameras I don't even know what camera to look at here one of
[02:14.360 --> 02:21.240]  them's floating over my head anyway if Bernie Sanders was in charge we wouldn't
[02:21.240 --> 02:25.880]  be allowed to do any of this stuff we'd be broadcasting out of a broom closet by
[02:25.880 --> 02:32.800]  the way so I did a live stream yesterday out at South by Southwest and a
[02:32.800 --> 02:41.320]  Trump hat and talking to Democrat voters you discover a couple things like
[02:41.320 --> 02:49.200]  they really do believe the media and if you can just inject a red pill
[02:49.200 --> 02:57.080]  somewhere into the crevices of their mind the whole fabric of what they
[02:57.080 --> 03:00.920]  thought was the truth starts to break down for example I'm talking to this
[03:00.920 --> 03:07.040]  family yesterday it's out by Southwest they didn't like Trump black family and
[03:07.040 --> 03:11.360]  they actually didn't mind Trump's policies per se but they thought he was
[03:11.360 --> 03:14.880]  treasonous and I said well what are you talking about they said well the Russian
[03:14.880 --> 03:18.080]  collusion and I said oh so he's treasonous because you think he's you
[03:18.080 --> 03:20.800]  know working for Russia would have you they say yeah I said well that's fake
[03:20.800 --> 03:24.040]  and they were kind of just like how are you gonna just sit here and say that's
[03:24.040 --> 03:29.640]  fake like you know okay well I said did you hear about the just he's small that
[03:29.640 --> 03:33.040]  story they said well yeah I said well what was that story and they said he
[03:33.040 --> 03:36.760]  faked his hate crime I said now did you see how he was able to get away with that
[03:36.760 --> 03:40.080]  and the media all went for it do you know you don't think they could fake the
[03:40.080 --> 03:44.040]  Russian collusion story and their eyes kind of lit up for a second like oh I
[03:44.040 --> 03:52.800]  guess they could but meanwhile as the whole Democrat identity is hate Trump
[03:52.800 --> 03:57.520]  they're going out saying America is garbage they're going out saying they
[03:57.520 --> 04:04.040]  don't even want America anymore they're going out and saying America was never
[04:04.040 --> 04:12.440]  great and and so you realize that they're so desperate for identity right
[04:12.440 --> 04:18.040]  now they're just throwing anything at the wall to see if it sticks because all
[04:18.040 --> 04:23.400]  they have is hate Trump so now you got Democrats going with universal basic
[04:23.400 --> 04:28.040]  income as a campaign you got Democrats going to America's garbage as a campaign
[04:28.040 --> 04:34.400]  free college Bernie Sanders wants to give you free everything these people
[04:34.400 --> 04:39.520]  are a joke but they're so concerned about foreign influence in our elections
[04:39.520 --> 04:43.160]  have you noticed this the Democrats are so concerned about foreign influence in
[04:43.160 --> 04:49.000]  our elections yet they want anyone to be allowed to vote from any country in
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.360]  this country so you can come from any country and vote here but if we think
[04:53.360 --> 04:59.200]  you're a Russian bot on social media we have a total panic attack

[05:57.720 --> 06:00.920]  digestive pack today
[06:00.920 --> 06:20.240]  waging war on corruption you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now
[06:20.240 --> 06:29.200]  your host Owen Troyer it was about six eight months ago I chewed rogers
[06:29.200 --> 06:35.360]  tell him his contract with me as a reporter I had the next deal on the
[06:35.360 --> 06:38.720]  next book he was to publish and then I heard he had a new book coming out he
[06:38.720 --> 06:44.680]  said don't worry it's only the may he have a present 2016 I had that the
[06:44.680 --> 06:48.480]  contract for a second edition I made him show me the contract indeed it said
[06:48.480 --> 06:52.640]  that let me turn it hearing a few weeks ago that he may be thrown in jail for
[06:52.640 --> 06:56.120]  violating a gag order because the book is to be published even though the four
[06:56.120 --> 07:01.800]  was written again over six months ago and now Jim Carrey has come out and said
[07:01.800 --> 07:06.440]  oh my god your honor other people are thrown in prison for smoking pot and so
[07:06.440 --> 07:11.000]  throw him in jail for thumbing his nosing you and he put out some subsequent
[07:11.000 --> 07:17.160]  art Jim Carrey he gets his free speech just to put on his stuff on Twitter is
[07:17.160 --> 07:20.400]  to call for stone to go to prison while the rest of mainstream media but stone
[07:20.400 --> 07:23.960]  doesn't even get free speech I think it's in trouble for a forward to a book
[07:23.960 --> 07:29.320]  written six plus months ago so this is how they operate of course that stone can't
[07:29.320 --> 07:32.520]  defend himself a point out that he's been a big marijuana decriminalization
[07:32.520 --> 07:38.560]  advocate for over 15 years and so Kerry leaning on the police state to promote a
[07:38.560 --> 07:42.960]  bigger police state is a hollow fraud again Jim Carrey ain't that smart
[07:42.960 --> 07:47.600]  and everybody knows it's a poor washed up dude that probably took too many drugs so
[07:47.600 --> 07:52.160]  to be crystal clear the entire corporate media and its imploded Russia gate
[07:52.160 --> 07:59.680]  hoax fable witch hunt inquisition is allowed disputing amount of lies and
[07:59.680 --> 08:03.080]  disinformation and leak whatever they want and call Roger stone everybody
[08:03.080 --> 08:06.560]  goes out of the sun totally guilty and then once you're caught in the web of
[08:06.560 --> 08:12.240]  this court then you have no say even for a book deal you signed years ago
[08:12.240 --> 08:16.760]  we wrote the forward six months ago that's about to be published and then
[08:16.760 --> 08:22.200]  Roger's own lawyers go yes we agree it's unspeakably bad or the exact what was
[08:22.200 --> 08:28.480]  it's it's indefensible it's the judge is like yes it's indefensible well they
[08:28.480 --> 08:31.760]  try to set me up I'm not gonna walk in and growl like this it's all a load of
[08:31.760 --> 08:35.640]  crap it's the Democrats their eyeballs in Russia gate they can all go to hell
[08:35.640 --> 08:38.840]  for selling this nation out we're the ones that say this nation was never great
[08:38.840 --> 08:42.920]  never be that great everybody knows their enemies of the nation-state itself
[08:42.920 --> 08:47.200]  they hate America's guts so they're sure as hell not the guardians of this
[08:47.200 --> 08:50.720]  republic on sick of their crap so regardless what you think of roger stone
[08:50.720 --> 08:54.800]  or in full wars or Alex Jones free species under attack that's a threat to
[08:54.800 --> 09:00.600]  your basic freedom that is Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen oh and sure you're
[09:00.600 --> 09:08.200]  filling in on the Alex Jones show today and that is Alex breaking down well the
[09:08.200 --> 09:14.800]  Jim Carrey aspect is just kind of the the observation of how insane they've gone
[09:14.800 --> 09:21.360]  really but it's ironic that Roger stone would make a meme or I don't know who
[09:21.360 --> 09:28.080]  made it who framed Roger stone like who framed Roger rabbit who framed Roger
[09:28.080 --> 09:31.840]  stone and that's literally what they're doing right now I mean he's being
[09:31.840 --> 09:41.880]  framed ladies and gentlemen he's being totally set up and it just makes me sick
[09:41.880 --> 09:47.720]  not only that this would happen in America total politicization of the
[09:47.720 --> 09:56.880]  Justice Department of our judicial system but that we would encourage this
[09:56.880 --> 10:05.320]  that people would actually be getting pleasure out of seeing what's happening
[10:05.320 --> 10:14.280]  to Roger stone and I'm afraid for Roger quite frankly I pray for him but they
[10:14.280 --> 10:21.960]  want his ass in jail and I think they're gonna get it and then you see what
[10:21.960 --> 10:25.880]  they did to Paul Manafort look Paul Manafort is not an innocent person the
[10:25.880 --> 10:30.080]  stuff that he got charged with already went through court and the judge
[10:30.080 --> 10:34.400]  dismissed all the charges and then they re-broad him up because they needed
[10:34.400 --> 10:37.960]  something to say hey look we found something with this Russia investigation
[10:37.960 --> 10:41.480]  so they just went after Manafort they knew all those things were there they
[10:41.480 --> 10:48.240]  gave Tony Podesta they gave Tony Podesta immunity to testify on all of it even
[10:48.240 --> 10:56.360]  though he did all the same crap I mean what the hell is happening to this frickin
[10:56.360 --> 11:06.520]  country man and and leave it to the media oh yeah I saw McCabe on TV I mean I
[11:06.520 --> 11:15.920]  can't believe who are these people who are you why are you such a liar why are
[11:15.920 --> 11:20.080]  you so corrupt who are these people
[11:21.680 --> 11:27.920]  seriously folks how can someone be so corrupt as Andrew McCabe I'm sorry and
[11:27.920 --> 11:33.880]  you know what this is a big studio so I'm gonna yell even louder I just don't
[11:33.880 --> 11:41.800]  get it who is Adam Schiff why are you such a lying piece of crap dude why is

[11:49.080 --> 11:59.640]  are they excuse me you know what I really need to focus and cover this news
[11:59.640 --> 12:05.640]  it's just I start thinking about it it all goes through my head all the lies of
[12:05.640 --> 12:11.200]  James Comey all the lies of Andy McCabe I mean we have their damn texts where
[12:11.200 --> 12:22.240]  they talk about open frickin treason and then and then Andrew McCabe and John
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.960]  Brennan and Clapper and all of them go on TV and tell you how Trump is the
[12:26.960 --> 12:37.200]  worst we're going to kill him who are these people who are they how did they
[12:37.200 --> 12:45.240]  get so corrupt they know what they know there's no Russian collusion man I mean
[12:45.240 --> 12:50.640]  see I just I can't even focus when I start to think about this because at the
[12:50.640 --> 12:55.040]  end of the day that's everything I can sit here I can cover all the news I got

[13:09.280 --> 13:14.560]  like this I want an investigation to Adam Schiff I want an investigation to
[13:14.560 --> 13:19.800]  Eric Swalwell I want an investigation to Nancy Pelosi and we don't get jack crap

[13:33.360 --> 13:40.720]  all around the world but somehow he's a Russian agent now so we're gonna spend
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.880]  40 plus million dollars and we're gonna tear this country apart for two
[13:45.880 --> 13:50.400]  frickin years plus and we're gonna lie about the president of the United States
[13:50.400 --> 13:54.080]  all the media is gonna get behind it all the Democrats are gonna get behind it
[13:54.080 --> 13:57.600]  and they're still gonna stick to their guns even when they've all been totally
[13:57.600 --> 14:05.120]  exposed what in the hell is going on here so that's what I want to know and
[14:05.120 --> 14:12.000]  guess what I don't get that story in the news do I I don't get to know why Eric

[14:26.320 --> 14:31.360]  his associates why how are they able to get away with this how is America asleep
[14:31.360 --> 14:39.040]  to this why aren't people yelling like me see and I can't even focus and do my

[18:04.240 --> 18:08.520]  pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[18:08.520 --> 18:12.840]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and
[18:12.840 --> 18:18.520]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[18:18.520 --> 18:23.360]  researchers in France notice that people who ate certain quail eggs experience
[18:23.360 --> 18:27.800]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[18:27.800 --> 18:31.920]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this
[18:31.920 --> 18:36.760]  research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.760 --> 18:42.160]  symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in
[18:42.160 --> 18:46.240]  fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity

[20:40.400 --> 20:45.520]  the fabric of the universe didn't start to tear itself from within because
[20:45.520 --> 20:54.960]  Alex Jones and Hillary Clinton face to face it just happened and we have the
[20:54.960 --> 21:02.280]  video and we air it right now on the Alex Jones show. You know I'm down here in
[21:02.280 --> 21:06.640]  Mexico trying to have a short vacation and Hillary freakin Clinton shows up at
[21:06.640 --> 21:12.960]  dinner David Ike it turns out's right look right here good God. Since her
[21:12.960 --> 21:16.280]  foundation shut down she has to beg for crumbs it was just right over here
[21:16.280 --> 21:21.680]  demanding bobbing it's out of the down demanding food. Oh Hillary's making it to
[21:21.680 --> 21:31.320]  move again. Hillary listen run for president repeatedly you haven't won we
[21:31.320 --> 21:38.400]  don't want you stop trying to stare us down to demand food taxpayer money
[21:38.400 --> 21:46.240]  foundation foundation's a joke. Hey Hillary good run on out of here you're not
[21:46.240 --> 21:51.760]  gonna run for election run on out of here. I'll tell you David Ike's on it. Oh God turn it back.
[21:51.760 --> 21:58.280]  David Ike's on to something here. There you go. There you go folks you already got a
[21:58.280 --> 22:05.200]  watcher got a watcher carefully. I believe Hillary Clinton will be right
[22:05.200 --> 22:14.160]  round vacation. Oh Hillary get on out of here get on out of here. Anti gun
[22:14.160 --> 22:21.000]  anti free speech monster. You know this isn't fair I try to come to Mexico to be
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.880]  away from the globalists all their censorship and control and then I run
[22:25.880 --> 22:40.280]  to Hillary then I run to Bill Clinton. Look at the arrogance. Bill Clinton. Bill is mad at me boy. Real mad.
[22:40.280 --> 22:45.640]  Crikey it's a politician just went in that hole probably down there with Jeffrey
[22:45.640 --> 22:52.640]  Epstein. Doesn't matter the documents are coming out Mr. Lizard. Wow who would have
[22:52.640 --> 22:59.040]  thought who would have thought I guess it makes sense you know that Bill and
[22:59.040 --> 23:03.960]  Hillary just transform into lizard people when they're not working makes
[23:03.960 --> 23:10.960]  sense. It's like in Conan the Barbarian when they do that seance and the guy
[23:10.960 --> 23:16.400]  turns into the snake that's basically that's basically what we've
[23:16.400 --> 23:20.960]  discovered now we have the exclusive Hillary Clinton is a lizard person we
[23:20.960 --> 23:26.240]  got it and then we got Bill too now it's not surprising that Bill wasn't with
[23:26.240 --> 23:29.880]  Hillary and Bill found some other female lizards over there you just you know
[23:29.880 --> 23:36.200]  having himself a good old time Hillary's like a hundred hundred-year-old sack of
[23:36.200 --> 23:43.840]  crap so you know Bill likes to mingle a little bit but hey what were the odds
[23:43.840 --> 23:47.720]  that Alex Jones would be staying at the same hotel where Bill and Hillary
[23:47.720 --> 23:54.920]  engage in lizard people activity. Case is closed we can close the case on that
[23:54.920 --> 24:03.040]  shut the book on that but I'm sure though in all seriousness it's just a
[24:03.040 --> 24:09.440]  coincidence that the Clinton Foundation is basically a failing organization now
[24:09.440 --> 24:13.320]  and that all of their donations are almost gone I'm sure that's just a
[24:13.320 --> 24:19.000]  coincidence and it has nothing to do with the fact she didn't win the
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.200]  presidential election right because that's not the type of people the
[24:24.200 --> 24:29.320]  Clintons are right I mean they're not laundering billions of dollars ravaging
[24:29.320 --> 24:38.920]  Haiti I mean folks this is sad but I mean we have video people hate the
[24:38.920 --> 24:43.640]  Clintons and Haiti so much literally their final words on their deathbed is
[24:43.640 --> 24:48.760]  like death to the Clintons like they're on their deathbed like reaching out like
[24:48.760 --> 24:55.160]  their final effort it's like death to the Clintons and then they're gone final
[24:55.160 --> 25:01.160]  words find final dying words death to the Clintons that's how much they hate the
[25:01.160 --> 25:06.560]  Clintons and Haiti but yeah I mean when you rob the whole country dry who knows
[25:06.560 --> 25:10.280]  what they did to that country folks I mean there's some weird satanic stuff
[25:10.280 --> 25:15.120]  they did to that country and then Laura Sillsby gets caught trying to cross the
[25:15.120 --> 25:19.360]  border with those undocumented kids and didn't oh oh I oh I don't know what's
[25:19.360 --> 25:26.120]  going on here what and then she changes her name hmm nothing to see here folks

[34:02.720 --> 34:08.640]  really sure what that's about by the way Cortez was in Austin you know she
[34:08.640 --> 34:13.280]  says that you shouldn't fly in an airplane shouldn't eat beef and she's a
[34:13.280 --> 34:17.280]  good socialist so everything should be free so leave it to Cortez to fly in an
[34:17.280 --> 34:23.480]  airplane to austin immediately upon landing eat a beef taco and then charge
[34:23.480 --> 34:28.400]  money to see her event yesterday where she trashed America said it's garbage

[35:14.440 --> 35:21.560]  year I don't know if that's winning but it does give credence to why we need a

[35:29.440 --> 35:32.680]  dollars you know you really have to wonder because the president is not

[37:53.040 --> 37:59.800]  the Bronx so so your district will outline it on a map and we'll test the
[37:59.800 --> 38:05.200]  new Green Deal in your district and so you can demolish all the buildings in
[38:05.200 --> 38:10.600]  your district it can be a no fly zone no cows allowed no no livestock allowed at
[38:10.600 --> 38:15.000]  all and then you can just rebuild the whole Bronx and so that's what we'll do
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.720]  we'll just test out the Green New Deal in the Bronx because you can't do it
[38:17.720 --> 38:21.160]  nationwide it's too big so let's just test it out on the Bronx and let's see
[38:21.160 --> 38:30.160]  how it goes huh all a bunch of nonsense Howard Schultz says a far-left Democrat
[38:30.160 --> 38:34.280]  could reelect Trump well because he's learned because he looks at this field
[38:34.280 --> 38:37.720]  of Democrats and he's like my god these are a bunch of nothing's a bunch of
[38:37.720 --> 38:43.720]  losers and so he really again I mean I'm looking at the left and I'm saying
[38:43.720 --> 38:47.520]  Howard Schultz Bloomberg said he's not gonna run and I'm looking like Howard
[38:47.520 --> 38:51.720]  Schultz I mean this Yang guy is catching on but he's an anti-second
[38:51.720 --> 38:56.720]  amendment pro-abortion guy I don't know why conservatives are so enamored by
[38:56.720 --> 39:07.000]  Yang but whatever you've got Schultz you've got Tulsi Gabbard and the left is
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.360]  throwing both of them under the bus and Howard Schultz gets it and he's like you
[39:10.360 --> 39:17.120]  guys are gonna reelect Trump they don't get it all these people are obsessed
[39:17.120 --> 39:22.600]  with Donald Trump it is getting really sick it is getting really sick folks
[39:22.600 --> 39:26.360]  because see the the Mueller investigation is all about destroying
[39:26.360 --> 39:31.000]  Donald Trump and destroying America but to the average liberal out there that
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.800]  doesn't understand what it's all about they're just as obsessed with Trump
[39:34.800 --> 39:38.360]  because they think that that's like I mean they really think that somehow when
[39:38.360 --> 39:41.520]  Trump goes down they're going to have deliverance in their life or something
[39:41.520 --> 39:47.880]  Hawaii Democrats want US Congress to consider repeal of Second Amendment
[39:47.880 --> 40:00.680]  mmm they just don't get it do they they just don't get it not even in the race
[40:00.680 --> 40:05.320]  Joe Biden leads herd of Democrats Bernie Sanders close behind what Bernie's
[40:05.320 --> 40:09.000]  gonna do this year you think he's just gonna you think he's just gonna throw
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.480]  his supporters under the bus again I mean they're so stupid but that's the
[40:12.480 --> 40:15.920]  amazing thing where all these Bernie supporters coming from because it's
[40:15.920 --> 40:22.360]  like a whole new group of people all the Bernie supporters that I knew and then
[40:22.360 --> 40:27.200]  I followed on social media from 2016 they don't want Bernie they're all
[40:27.200 --> 40:31.720]  anti-Bernie so who are these people so Bernie I guess has a totally new group
[40:31.720 --> 40:37.400]  of voters now and he just had a big rally in Iowa yeah Bernie was always
[40:37.400 --> 40:41.080]  more popular than Hillary
[40:44.720 --> 40:51.160]  all the Bernie Sanders figure wave oh it gets me every time it gets me every
[40:51.160 --> 41:09.360]  time nope so I mean hey yeah okay okay Bernie Sanders that's fun hey Trump
[41:09.360 --> 41:17.840]  versus Sanders is the presidential debate we deserve it really is I want it
[41:17.840 --> 41:29.160]  on command oh my gosh hey I give Bernie credit he got himself a haircut and he
[41:29.160 --> 41:33.560]  found a comb he got the you know the dandruff and everything off of his
[41:33.560 --> 41:44.040]  jacket and I wonder what Bernie would do about this student loans leave a couple
[41:44.040 --> 41:47.540]  worried about negative net worth and then you read the story you learn 15
[41:47.540 --> 41:52.760]  percent of households nationwide have a negative net worth but if you think
[41:52.760 --> 41:57.560]  about it of course that would be the state of the nation the nation has a
[41:57.560 --> 42:04.360]  negative net worth we're 21 trillion in debt so yeah wow the nation is over 20
[42:04.360 --> 42:11.760]  trillion in debt and the citizens are also in debt go figure New York City is
[42:11.760 --> 42:15.920]  edging towards financial disaster experts warn it won't matter it won't
[42:15.920 --> 42:20.640]  matter you can look it up the state of Illinois went broke like I mean like
[42:20.640 --> 42:24.960]  worst ever like three years ago they were like we got to shut down or something
[42:24.960 --> 42:29.320]  they don't even know what to do and it's just like whatever go build a building
[42:29.320 --> 42:35.040]  for Obama state of California totally broke totally in debt and then they want
[42:35.040 --> 42:41.360]  to spend more money on non-citizens so yeah all these major cities run by
[42:41.360 --> 42:47.600]  Democrats are in total financial ruin and it doesn't matter they just keep
[42:47.600 --> 42:53.840]  spending just keep spending and you just wait till Bernie or Cortez gets in
[42:53.840 --> 42:57.200]  office and then it's just like they'll spend 20 trillion dollars and one
[42:57.200 --> 43:03.640]  quarter you know the worst part about getting old I'm still strong 45 is that
[43:03.640 --> 43:06.400]  I won't be there for my children someday that's why I need to make them strong
[43:06.400 --> 43:11.280]  now now I can be there for my children now I can make them strong now I can
[43:11.280 --> 43:15.120]  instruct them now I can teach them what I've learned but not once I'm gone you
[43:15.120 --> 43:17.800]  think it was digital age your words going forever but now there isn't better
[43:17.800 --> 43:22.040]  getting rid of what you said they were before it's so much easier to burn video
[43:22.040 --> 43:25.920]  or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning isn't it but I
[43:25.920 --> 43:31.040]  have joined my will to the resistance I can't be destroyed now as long as I

[45:13.080 --> 45:18.800]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[45:18.800 --> 45:22.680]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[45:22.680 --> 45:27.360]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[45:27.360 --> 45:31.600]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.080]  fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate
[45:36.080 --> 45:41.160]  seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[45:41.160 --> 45:45.240]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[45:45.240 --> 45:49.720]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[45:49.720 --> 45:54.280]  inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[47:46.000 --> 47:52.000]  some of his friends I was a little tired and I needed a little pick me up in the
[47:52.000 --> 47:57.720]  break and so I went and I had a packet of turbo force mixed with about eight
[47:57.720 --> 48:04.040]  ounces of water knocked it back during the break and I mean lift off baby I
[48:04.040 --> 48:07.760]  mean this stuff is the real deal so I'm telling you if you want to feel like

[48:47.880 --> 48:53.640]  Cortez meth mouth bender all right so as you can see I clearly am on one
[48:53.640 --> 48:57.720]  now you know I do want to say this because I didn't really get down into
[48:57.720 --> 49:01.640]  the weeds on this the whole Trump and Coulter thing you know because there's
[49:01.640 --> 49:08.720]  the weird dynamics of this because on the surface it's not good face value this
[49:08.720 --> 49:13.680]  is bad for Trump to be attacking his own base one of the few voices that got him
[49:13.680 --> 49:17.400]  elected during the primaries he probably couldn't even have maybe got in if it
[49:17.400 --> 49:21.240]  was I mean I've said this a dozen times but I don't think Trump gets nominated by
[49:21.240 --> 49:24.320]  the Republican Party if it's not for Ann Coulter Michael Savage and Alex Jones
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.280]  or this audience and that's just the fact so for the president to be attacking
[49:29.280 --> 49:34.720]  his own base is not good the optics aren't good and then it kind of has a
[49:34.720 --> 49:38.840]  quite frankly if I if I hadn't been following the president for so long most
[49:38.840 --> 49:44.400]  normal people what this would indicate is that they're starting to lose it that's
[49:44.400 --> 49:49.000]  what this would indicate that they're starting to lose it and now they're
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.200]  starting to bite the hand that fathom but it is always different with Trump and
[49:53.200 --> 49:56.960]  I know that this bothers some people I owe the 5D chest but I mean it really is
[49:56.960 --> 50:00.200]  different Donald Trump would not have put that tweet out unless he knows he's
[50:00.200 --> 50:08.960]  gonna have the last laugh still though I don't think it's a good idea and it
[50:08.960 --> 50:22.840]  does not look good but deed is done okay let me get into some other news here
[50:22.840 --> 50:29.320]  CNN to be sued when I read this I had such a smile on my face I can't even
[50:29.320 --> 50:34.480]  tell you folks CNN to be sued for more than $250 million over vicious and
[50:34.480 --> 50:43.000]  direct attacks on coming to high school student and you know I kind of have to
[50:43.000 --> 50:49.000]  sit and think about this because you know we get these frivolous lawsuits on
[50:49.000 --> 50:56.240]  us all the time I don't even know where the cough button isn't here yet do we
[50:56.240 --> 51:03.560]  have one anyway we have to deal with these lawsuits all the time and so part
[51:03.560 --> 51:07.560]  of me is like I kind of feel bad for CNN because I have to deal with this crap
[51:07.560 --> 51:12.600]  and then it hits me it's like well wait a second the lawsuits that we deal with
[51:12.600 --> 51:17.680]  they're all garbage and most of them just get tossed out they can't even spell
[51:17.680 --> 51:21.840]  our names right I mean it's pathetic it's clearly to try to attack us but you
[51:21.840 --> 51:28.000]  know this is what CNN deserves and that's really what it's all about it's
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.480]  about getting what you deserve and you know what CNN quite frankly this is
[51:33.480 --> 51:38.580]  only a quarter of what you deserve you deserve a billion dollar lawsuit to be
[51:38.580 --> 51:44.120]  filed against you all the vicious hate crimes that you're responsible for
[51:44.120 --> 51:49.000]  inciting with your lies about Donald Trump and his supporters all the lies
[51:49.000 --> 51:54.120]  that led us into wars in foreign countries that you spread on your airwaves
[51:54.120 --> 52:01.080]  CNN you know now that I'm thinking about it even a trillion dollar lawsuit
[52:01.080 --> 52:05.960]  might be more applicable here to CNN I mean when you really crunch the numbers
[52:05.960 --> 52:12.360]  those wars cost us trillions of dollars how can you even put a monetary value on
[52:12.360 --> 52:17.440]  all the division and hatred that they've sowed in this country so I think CNN
[52:17.440 --> 52:23.880]  ought to be so CNN should be sued for one trillion dollars I'm not calling for
[52:23.880 --> 52:27.440]  CNN to be shut down I mean maybe Big Pharma can pay that off for them they
[52:27.440 --> 52:35.120]  pay all their other bills they keep the lights on over there so you know but
[52:35.120 --> 52:40.760]  Zuckers now coming out and crying says Trump attempted to block the AT&T
[52:40.760 --> 52:47.080]  merger and says that Trump is state-run or Fox is state-run news well I will say
[52:47.080 --> 52:55.080]  he has a bit of a point there but Bill Shine former Fox I guess he was I
[52:55.080 --> 52:59.160]  forget what his role was at Fox like top one or two over there and then he was
[52:59.160 --> 53:04.040]  the communications director for Trump he's now out but Trump pretty much
[53:04.040 --> 53:09.880]  watches Fox a lot talks about a lot goes on Fox a lot but I don't think that's
[53:09.880 --> 53:14.080]  because it's state-run news in fact if you listen to Lou Dobbs and some other
[53:14.080 --> 53:17.160]  people I mean heck they have Shepherd Smith on for a couple hours a day the
[53:17.160 --> 53:25.440]  guy can't stand Trump but but little baby Zucker I think is starting to see the
[53:25.440 --> 53:33.880]  future for CNN and well it's basically Don Lemon so when Don Lemon is your
[53:33.880 --> 53:40.880]  future you're in trouble you know what I'm saying like that's like watching a
[53:40.880 --> 53:46.240]  bad sports team and like it's a really young team but like they all suck and
[53:46.240 --> 53:51.360]  you're just sitting there just like oh boy this team is going nowhere that's
[53:51.360 --> 53:56.000]  what Jeff Zucker sees every day when he sees Don Lemon on air he sees that's
[53:56.000 --> 54:04.440]  his future and he goes oh my god we are screwed Don Lemon yeah he pat he packs
[54:04.440 --> 54:08.440]  quite the punch that kind of looks like the punch that ended small that right
[54:08.440 --> 54:13.000]  there doesn't it well maybe CNN's gonna be out of a job soon
[54:13.000 --> 54:19.080]  Robo journalism gains traction in shifting media landscape a text
[54:19.080 --> 54:23.280]  generating bot named Toby produced nearly 40,000 news stories about the
[54:23.280 --> 54:28.160]  results of the November 2018 elections in Switzerland for the media giant Tam
[54:28.160 --> 54:35.800]  media in just five minutes here's my concern with the AI stuff you know
[54:35.800 --> 54:41.120]  they're already so so basically the AI isn't organic is the best way I would
[54:41.120 --> 54:49.320]  put it an organic AI that goes out and kind of you know gets its own
[54:49.320 --> 54:54.240]  intelligence I mean that's what intelligence is it's getting intelligence
[54:54.240 --> 55:00.640]  for yourself it's the process of learning and then solidifying that in your
[55:00.640 --> 55:07.240]  mind but when they're gaming and rigging the whole internet and then the AI and
[55:07.240 --> 55:11.520]  so all the data is being rigged and manipulated and then the AI is using
[55:11.520 --> 55:17.080]  that data to become artificially intelligent so it's not even real true
[55:17.080 --> 55:26.440]  AI it's gamed rigged AI but I wonder if the AI would be able to determine that
[55:26.440 --> 55:32.880]  and that's like the next level of the AI that's like the sentient AI but will it
[55:32.880 --> 55:48.360]  even have access for example can the AI understand that CNN is fake news or does
[55:48.360 --> 55:53.760]  it actually absorb information coming out of CNN at the exact same way it would
[55:53.760 --> 55:59.040]  absorb information coming out of info wars or anywhere else that does does how
[55:59.040 --> 56:06.000]  does an AI value or rank in value the information and the data it's receiving
[56:06.000 --> 56:11.640]  can it do that so that's kind of my concern with all this AI stuff is like
[56:11.640 --> 56:20.040]  what kind of AI is really being built and then what intelligence does the AI
[56:20.040 --> 56:32.160]  have access to and then how does that then manipulate the AI for the future so
[56:32.160 --> 56:36.680]  like is the AI going to be a social justice warrior or is the AI going to
[56:36.680 --> 56:46.080]  be anti-social justice warrior maybe the answer lies in Egypt is there a hidden
[56:46.080 --> 56:53.520]  doorway in the great Sphinx of Giza mystery over to ancient Egypt relics a
[56:53.520 --> 57:00.360]  lot of stuff going on in Egypt actually a lot of secrets about the pyramids being
[57:00.360 --> 57:05.280]  discovered and it's pretty cool stuff but nobody really talks about it so
[57:05.280 --> 57:09.720]  whatever and that was actually cut this was a nationwide story blind this
[57:09.720 --> 57:13.360]  miracle cure experts and huge breakthrough with God molecule psychedelic
[57:13.360 --> 57:17.560]  drugs so this is actually pretty cool they're saying that blind people take
[57:17.560 --> 57:21.800]  DMT and then they can actually see images and stuff in their mind it would
[57:21.800 --> 57:26.640]  make sense but I'm actually pretty sure that God molecule is like there's
[57:26.640 --> 57:35.080]  actually one step up from DMT it's like DMT five or something and what is it
[57:35.080 --> 57:44.320]  a five enemy me busy XY 917 barrel roll corkscrew screaming eagle coffee mug but
[57:44.320 --> 57:48.120]  anyway the psychedelic drugs there they're learning that they can go be of

[59:58.400 --> 01:00:24.360]  We get into some culture war news here in the second hour of this Sunday
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.080]  broadcast and joining me in the next segment will be Frank Kavanaugh
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:36.800]  the original founding bass player member of the rock band filter very popular
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:44.480]  in the 90s and so just to kind of give you a brief on what we're gonna be
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:51.040]  talking about he was kicked out of the band for his political beliefs being a
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:58.920]  conservative and then the band said some negative things about Alex Jones
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:06.640]  Donald Trump and he decided to come out and give a response to that and there's
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.480]  been some other stuff developing with that too but we'll have him break that
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:17.440]  down but first here is sergeant Frank Kavanaugh explaining why he left filter
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:29.240]  to join the army you know it's really incredible because I've done my whole
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.760]  career in the army I didn't let anybody know about my history of being in a band
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:40.480]  filter and this kid just came out a couple weeks ago and across the board a
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.680]  hundred percent I've gotten responses from soldiers that they just can't believe
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.960]  it they can't believe that someone who is in a band as successful as mine would
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:52.720]  stop doing music and join the army and my reply to them is that to me being in
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.440]  the military is more important than making music right now we're at a time
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:01.120]  in our country where our country's at war and our country needs everyone they
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:07.360]  can get and I had done everything that I wanted to do in life with with the with
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.480]  being in a band like filter we had seen the world literally gone around it
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:16.440]  twice and I didn't want to live my whole life and not be in the military we
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:21.840]  had a bass player and filter before Charles his name was Frank Kavanaugh
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.440]  and now he's a sergeant in the army
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:43.240]  we're just showing Frank rockin the bass right now performing in Kuwait
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.800]  or the military
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.920]  and so Frank is going to be joining us and there's a bit of another twist that
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:02.320]  I'll let Frank talk about when it comes to that show that they did in Kuwait and
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:07.520]  some of the social media activity that the filter band has been doing since
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.920]  they kicked Frank out for his politics you know you think being in a band you
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.280]  just want to have like the best bass player you know the guy that started the
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.200]  band but you know he likes Trump he listens info wars so can't have that I
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.040]  guess you know because that's so American but he'll give us the update on
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:32.480]  all of that but you know I was thinking about this because so many times you
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:38.120]  know rock stars and actors and you know celebrities and everything we take
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:44.000]  their word with such value and it's really there's too much value placed in
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.320]  it I think because they really most of time don't know what they're talking
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:54.640]  about and then I also realized though that things are so polarized and
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:00.480]  political now that you have to be careful because sometimes you might think
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.040]  somebody said something really negative and you might in turn get angry but you
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.600]  didn't see the full story an example would be for example I'm a big food
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.880]  fighters fan Dave Grohl lead singer he made a statement he said you know he
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.440]  didn't like Trump he was disappointed in Trump and that quote from a long
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.880]  interview was the only thing that made it out so you had all these people saying
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.440]  oh I hate Dave now I'll never listen to food fighters again I was like well I'm
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.560]  gonna go read this and then you read the whole interview and yeah he did say he
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.080]  didn't like Trump he said he didn't like some of his policies and he was
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.400]  disappointed in some of the things that he said and then but you read the whole
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.280]  thing and it's like look you know people are allowed to have a political
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:39.520]  opinion and that doesn't mean we have to hate him for it that doesn't mean we
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.600]  have to cut him out of our life and he talks about that he's like I realized
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.840]  that to some people my political opinion is crazy and I he's like I know friends
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.000]  in the music industry that that have the complete opposite political views as
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.320]  mine so it's like we just need to remember that we got to come together
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.800]  and that we're all American at the end of this
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:02.520]  infowarstore.com is how you support us and it's not like we're selling stuff
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:06.960]  you don't need you don't want the air in the average American home is filled
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:13.000]  with toxins that put it on par with a major city there's some of the most
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.560]  polluted areas on earth are major cities how can I solve that problem so we
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.040]  have air filters at infowarstore.com the Alexa Pure Breeze which is right
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:29.600]  now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.040]  technology and we've got a limited quantity of these left right now we're
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.160]  basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul go ahead and
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:43.760]  read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself I've got two in my home you
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:48.640]  will notice the difference ladies and gentlemen with the Alexa Pure Breeze in
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:55.600]  your house don't live in a polluted major city in your home have clean air go
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.120]  to infowarstore.com
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:10.200]  and now the tip of the spear leading the fight to take back the nation it's
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:17.080]  Owen Troyer you're listening to the Alex Jones show sometimes you just need to
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:23.200]  talk to somebody to learn that you don't hate them just because they're
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.200]  politics now the issue that we have is one side of the aisle doesn't want to
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.800]  come together and doesn't want to talk and doesn't want to be friends they
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:39.760]  just want to hate and this has resulted in mass censorship this has resulted in
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:45.160]  people ending relationships families being torn apart and for the specific
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:52.440]  example bans being torn apart so Frank Kavanaugh was the founding bassist for
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:57.960]  the popular band filter he was kicked out for his politics and he's a
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:03.080]  conservative he joined the military he was a sergeant in the military and he
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:08.080]  joins us now because there's some new ripples to this story Frank Kavanaugh
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:12.760]  bassist or I guess formerly the bassist for filter joins us now thanks for
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:17.680]  joining me Frank hey Owen thank you so much good to be here well you look a
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:25.360]  little different now than you did back then I gotta say you know we live a
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:30.880]  long life and you got to constantly be able to reinvent yourself and when I
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:36.100]  was in filter I was a certain person I always had the core moral values I wanted
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:40.000]  to be in that lifestyle and then I completely changed and joined the army
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.520]  now now I'm a farmer just you know living out living out the rest of my
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.800]  life I do want to say there's a lot of backstory with the whole filter thing
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:57.360]  the it it filters been around for 25 years there's been a lot of people in
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:04.520]  and out of it and the whole thing with Richard and I having a fallout originally
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:09.960]  happened actually six years ago in 2013 when he called Alex Jones and anyone
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:15.360]  who was in the tea party terrorists basically and and and at that point as I
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:20.480]  realized how dangerous it was to have that kind of rhetoric um being a
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:29.320]  musician then being a soldier I understand that an AR or guitar they're
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:36.360]  both weapons they can be used for good or they can be used for evil or bad and
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:40.920]  what's happening now in this country being completely polarized where you
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:44.880]  have to be this way or that way or I won't even speak to you really is only
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:53.160]  happening on the left the people on the right I enjoy debate I enjoy being told
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:58.760]  I'm wrong because I know I'm right and if I'm if I'm proven wrong I stand
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:02.480]  corrected and I thank you because I don't want to live my life being making
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.160]  mistakes like that so um when filter got when they had a show on El Paso just
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:11.520]  this last week and it got canceled because of their anti-trump Trump
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:19.120]  rhetoric um I felt that I needed to come out and use this as an opportunity kind
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:25.760]  of to I want to defend filter I wanted to fend Richard I wanted to fend his
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:31.760]  speech even on 100% against it I went to Iraq and served in the military
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:41.120]  to defend speech that I did not like which decidedly filters filters message
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:47.120]  now is not positive it's definitely a negative message it's the glass is half
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:54.320]  empty it's not half full and I could sit here and bash that individual person
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:00.000]  but what is half what happened in filter what happened to me is a a small
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.680]  macrocosm of the microcosm of what's happened to Alex Jones and what's
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.440]  happened to all conservatives by being banned and
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:15.120]  there's a golden opportunity right now just as the DNC is not letting Fox
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:22.560]  News have any debates and Alex is off of YouTube we've all been been
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:27.840]  banned at times off Facebook and various social media platforms now the little
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.640]  there was a little bite of tyranny that bit Richard Patrick
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:38.560]  from the jaws of tyranny that's that's been having us in a clamp for years
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:44.960]  and if he wants his free speech and he wants to defend it and he's so
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.320]  passionate about free speech then here's an opportunity
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.840]  be the change you want to see in the world we are the change that we want to
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:59.520]  see in the world and as Gandhi what Gandhi did after
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:06.000]  India achieved its independence a man came to him whose son had been
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.880]  he was either a Muslim or a Hindu he came in and he said my son has been killed
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.360]  he was a Hindu and Gandhi said I want you to adopt a Muslim
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.360]  whose father has been killed and raised him as a Muslim
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.840]  because then you know all sides and we can we can live in peace
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.000]  it really if you don't know what's going on in the other side and you're so
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.520]  closed-minded it's like turning off an instrument
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.280]  in in the palette of your life or if you're a painter
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.240]  saying I'm never going to use that color and or let's use the let's use your
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.480]  band filter as the example it's removing the bass player and so you're
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.000]  listening to the same filter songs but you're not getting the full sound you're
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.440]  not hearing the whole hearing the whole thing and so you're kind of like wait a
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:56.080]  second I recognize a song but something's missing you don't have the full orchestra
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:01.120]  well you know the thing about fit the the band model for filter it was always
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.720]  a computer everything was written on a computer it wasn't a traditional
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.320]  um where a band would get together in jam
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.000]  and I was on the first three records actually the first record I played some
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.760]  drums on that the second two records I played bass and I collaborated in the
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.840]  studio with rich and wrote songs so so so you guys were doing mostly digital
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.880]  recordings you weren't laying down tracks
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.200]  yeah well yeah it wasn't like it wasn't like four or five guys got together
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.280]  and Jan like here I've got all these ideas let's put it together make a song
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.120]  and then go record it that's not what we did it was a rich always owned the band
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.480]  he always he always had the business model where it's going to be revolving
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.320]  door um of course we didn't know that when we
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:47.440]  25 years ago when we were in it but that that really that whole part of the
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:51.280]  story will correct any deficiencies in that in
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.240]  accuracy well we can get let's get well I was gonna say
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.040]  let's do that on the other side let's do them this I actually want to kind of
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.720]  talk about something you you said and talk about the larger issue here
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:05.280]  how how in your eyes Richard is now kind of starting to get that sting
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.320]  of the tyranny that really they've been invoking on America
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:11.200]  and you don't want that you don't want him his shows to get canceled for his
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.120]  free speech but but you're saying that's kind of almost karma
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.560]  it's kind of like the universe coming back and saying that you're now reaping
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:23.760]  what you sowed exactly exactly it's the golden rule
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:27.120]  it's you treat others the way you want to be treated
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.720]  you know it's great I went look I haven't been paid attention to filter I've
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.800]  been doing other stuff and um I went and looked at the
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.320]  filter video that they had posted and you can see at the very end of the
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.640]  video there's a little old man in there now what would a little old man be in a
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.640]  rock venue and he looks like he's he's probably in his 80s like
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:55.840]  korea war era who probably lost friends and is not having it so it's like
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:00.400]  it was very disrespectful I could see it in that man's soul as he was walking
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.840]  away and it's like if you want people to
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:08.960]  respect your ideas you want us to listen to you then
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.240]  respect us and we will we have no problem listening to you we have no
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:16.400]  problem debating you we have no problem talking about anything because
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.040]  if we're wrong we'll admit it but the thing is is that logically if you think
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:25.760]  about what's going on the right is not incorrect
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:31.760]  the right is right and um it's time for it's it's almost like a
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:34.560]  cycle of domestic violence is happening in this country
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.800]  where there it's just getting more and more escalated
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.920]  where one side's doing one thing one side's doing the other what happened
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:48.400]  with jesse smallett it is basically that 63 million americans that he was
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:53.440]  trying to to perpetrate a false flag against what rich has been doing with
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:59.920]  filter is he's alienated 63 million americans his fans and it's
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:03.120]  like what why are you doing this for a political what
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:08.160]  you don't even know the other side so and i think it and i actually think that
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:13.680]  this is maybe an unintended consequence of all the lies in the media right now
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:17.440]  and and this is what you kind of came in talking about how we can't even really
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.200]  have peaceful conversations because it's like if i walk up to somebody
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.640]  and they know i'm a conservative they're immediately callous to me
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.920]  and they immediately don't want to hear me so then we can't have a conversation
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:32.880]  but then you realize that's what's keeping us divided it's the fact that
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:36.160]  they've been lied to so much about conservatives about trump supporters so
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.280]  now they see one they're like oh my gosh that's a bigot that's a racist
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.640]  they don't want to hear from you and i don't know if that was intentional but
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.160]  so now we can't come together we're yesterday i'm talking to these people
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:49.440]  that are trump haters and they're like yeah russian inclusion i'm like remember
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:52.480]  how they fake jesse smallett and they were like yeah and i was like
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.800]  they're faking the russian inclusion and it was like everything clicked they
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.840]  don't want us to talk to them they're scared of us

[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:24.560]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with oen
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:29.760]  shroyer let me try to crystallize that thought
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.920]  that i was cut off on by the break last segment
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:40.960]  so and i and i think i have a better way to paint it so it makes sense
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:48.080]  don lemon doesn't want you to talk to oen shroyer
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.680]  because oen shroyer is smarter than don lemon
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.720]  and will actually be able to impact your opinion
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:59.920]  and change your mind in a positive way so
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:05.600]  now to zoom out cnn doesn't want you to go to info wars because our
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:09.760]  information trumps theirs our news broadcasts
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.080]  trump theirs we are a hundred thousand times better than them
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.960]  so they don't want you to tune into info wars so the censorship is one level but
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:22.560]  what i was getting at as frank cavanaugh the
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:27.200]  original founding basis of filter is with us
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.960]  they want people they want free speech chilled
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:35.120]  specifically when it comes to just any individual
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.240]  talking to a conservative or listening to info wars
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.240]  it's the threat that our information is actually so powerful it could change your
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:46.960]  mind and influence you they don't want that so what i'm saying is
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:51.280]  they're cutting off communication at an individual level
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:55.520]  because they want you to be so hardened and callous when you see a trump
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.560]  supporter they don't want you to talk to them
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.920]  because that trump supporter could actually change your mind
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.760]  if you gave them a chance and i learned this because i went out to
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:09.600]  south by southwest yesterday and i was talking to a nice family
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:13.840]  there they were black people they didn't like trump uh and the main reason was
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.760]  because they said he was treasonous because of russian
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:20.560]  inclusion now where do they get that cnn msnbc
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:26.720]  who wants us shut down cnn msnbc they talked to me yesterday what cnn and msnbc
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:30.720]  don't want them to do and guess what i opened their eyes and i said you know
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.520]  how they faked that whole justy small that thing and the media went along with
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.000]  it they said yep i said you don't think they could do that with russian
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.320]  inclusion they said whoa guys it's actually right at the
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.680]  beginning of the video if you want to go to like two minutes in uh you can see
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:47.600]  yeah yeah it's this uh uh yeah this family right here really nice people
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:51.120]  not big fans of trump uh they don't they didn't think he was like
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.920]  you know the full racist and everything like they said but oh russian
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:58.080]  inclusion he's not so so my point is though the cnn's
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.760]  the people that censor social media the people that hate trump they don't want
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:05.680]  this conversation to happen they don't want conservatives and liberals to come
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.840]  together for a conversation because that's how we beat them
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:14.320]  they want total information control they want total conversation control
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.960]  and as soon as people actually have a real conversation and they're not
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:20.720]  hardened by one point of view all of a sudden you can come together find a
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.880]  middle ground and guess what they're not going to get the race
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:27.680]  war the civil war that they want so uh frank i don't know if that boils down
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.520]  um what i was thinking there or if it makes sense to you
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.640]  uh but before we get into some of the other stuff with you uh does does that
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.920]  make sense am i clarifying what i was saying oh that totally makes sense it
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:40.640]  it's really unfortunate what's happening in this country
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:45.600]  um and it it it happens then politics is all local
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:50.080]  and it does happen locally and it happens in a family it happens in a
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:57.760]  band it happens in relationships um because people it's almost like it
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.000]  an inability to grow up if you want to if you really want to
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.840]  to to own things you know people want to be a success and they want to own
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.200]  things then you need to the first thing you need to own is your mistakes
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:13.440]  because if you don't own your mistakes then you'll never improve
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:17.120]  and so it's almost like the people that are they're like oh goodness
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.440]  like i i backed the wrong person i don't want to be proved wrong
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.720]  so i'm going to keep doubling down and doubling down and doubling down
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:30.160]  and the the i i was a democrat for years back when i was in filter i was more
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.560]  libertarian i didn't even know what what it was
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:36.720]  you know the the whole the whole resistance to the revolution happened in
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.240]  2012 with ron paul you know that's when i when i think this all
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:43.760]  changed that it's they're all late with this whole resistance thing
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:50.240]  but um the the democratic party that that i loved that was
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:54.800]  for free speech that was for civil rights that was for inclusion
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.520]  is is now the democratic party of pre-civil war
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:05.440]  where it's not for inclusion it's it's totally based on race unfortunately
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.040]  and and let's kind of let's kind of boil this down because i want to talk about
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:13.040]  and then look i'm not i don't know the members of the band filter this is the
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.840]  first time i've talked to frank i'm not here to try to you know insult these
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.240]  guys but you know at the same time i think that
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:22.080]  there's an example here that we can use frank because
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.600]  what i see is i see a bunch of leftist grandstanding
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.680]  off of things that really they didn't do or that they don't put their money where
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:33.280]  their mouth is a good example is Cortez says you shouldn't fly
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.720]  or you shouldn't eat beef and then she flies on an airplane and eats a beef
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:41.680]  taco in Texas i mean it's a joke but so you guys played that show in in
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.640]  Kuwait we played the video earlier and that was because you were a sergeant in
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.240]  the military and they invited you to go on that stage
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.760]  and the band though after they kicked you out
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:57.680]  and you were the sole responsible reason why they were playing that show for the
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:01.280]  troops in Kuwait they then made a post on the
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:04.960]  internet saying don't call me anti-american i played in Kuwait
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:09.600]  but they kicked you out of the band who was responsible for them playing in
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.880]  Kuwait so it just it's kind of like the same irony it's like the
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:17.200]  it's it's like stolen valor where they take something that really they aren't
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.560]  responsible for or really something they're not doing and then they basically
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:24.240]  force it on you like how dare you
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:27.760]  well well i i've got to correct one thing oh and um
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.720]  i i made a conscious decision to join the military
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:36.960]  in 2005 because i was being a decade in hollywood and in that
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:41.760]  that whole thing out there you know you know what it is and what it's like and
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.920]  i just didn't want to be a part of that anymore
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.920]  and so um and at the at the time filter was
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:52.400]  on hi hiatus anyway rich was in another band with the delayo brothers from
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.360]  stone temple pilots when um when that show happened
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:01.600]  i was i was on pre-deployment at ford hood to go to
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.960]  to just go to iraq to al-asad i hadn't told anyone in the army that i had been
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.200]  in filter because i just didn't want that to follow me it's like
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:16.240]  um and they found me and flew me over there to
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:18.560]  that kawaii show and i was more than happy to do it
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:22.160]  but it almost seemed like this the whole reason i actually approached info
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:26.560]  wars is because i it's like i i want i i wish
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.760]  filter and all those guys the best of luck they're great musicians they're
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:34.480]  incredibly talented they make great music um get back to making music
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:37.760]  not and if you really want to talk about politics being formed
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:44.000]  but when when riftz said hey if if you have you gone to iraq or afghanistan i've
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.800]  been over there it's like yeah you've been over there
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.680]  i was there with you too i played with you i also spent a year of my life there
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:55.440]  and gave a blank check to the united states government
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.680]  for basically my life and
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.760]  was away from family friends career for a year
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:08.400]  because that's how much this country means to me and to constantly dog
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:12.560]  our country the glass is half empty the glass is half empty
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:17.120]  instead of being positive being negative portraying yourself as this all
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:20.720]  inclusive person who's like the the positive person
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:26.240]  and um then when you get handed your own dish that you've been feeding people
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.320]  for years um you cry that well you've
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:33.600]  been to iraq and afghanistan it was almost like stolen
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:38.080]  dollar to me it was it it my best friend major

[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:09.120]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:12.080]  promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:16.560]  eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:20.400]  researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:24.240]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:28.240]  they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:31.440]  we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:35.360]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:39.680]  pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:43.440]  in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:47.280]  activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:52.320]  inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:38.720]  he's a rock star sergeant in the military
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:42.640]  and he has quite a handlebar that uh mustache so he's pretty much
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:46.640]  checks off all three boxes when it comes to the all-american badass
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:51.040]  he's with us here for one more segment uh frank i just wanted to give you the
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:54.560]  platform here i know that there's been a lot of things on your mind over the
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:59.120]  years and you've kind of remained silent on it and you've decided to
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:03.200]  kind of go public if you will with some of these things and so i appreciate you
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.480]  coming on info wars here so i just wanted to give you the platform
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.920]  to just uh voice some things that are on your mind if you want to talk
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:13.200]  more about filter them kicking you out the statements they've made if you just
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:16.720]  want to talk about anything else that's on your mind happening in america right
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.440]  now uh frank abinall uh former basist of filter he was the founding
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:25.280]  member and they booted him for his politics and uh i think that you're
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:30.240]  probably about to find out why go ahead frank uh oh and first of all i want to
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:33.120]  i want to tell you that um being in the military
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:37.520]  you know the gun is your weapon being a musician
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:40.560]  your instrument is your weapon now our weapon
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:48.240]  and your weapon is comedy and you are a battle wagon sir you um what you do out
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:52.800]  in the street with people has influenced and changed so many people's minds
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:58.000]  and that's how we're going to do it um the whole backstory about me and filter
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.360]  i could go back into that um i want to use this opportunity right now though
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:08.160]  to be positive um i want to say that you know the most punk rock thing that
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:12.640]  anyone could do now in 2019 is be a libertarian be a trump
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:18.320]  supporter we are the alternative we are you know
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:23.280]  just as the patriots that that founded this country were punk rock
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:27.280]  that's what it is now and they're trying to have a monopoly
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.680]  on art and music music is the soundtrack to our lives
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:36.000]  and if they have a monopoly on the message coming out of that
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.200]  then um you know they then they're they think they're gonna win i actually
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.920]  think that what's happening right now is the death
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:46.720]  throws of the of the of the globalist
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:53.280]  statism that um it's like jealous girls that were the most popular kids that
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:56.880]  finally like some new girl moved in and that and now they're like
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.680]  freaking out and they're pulling all the stops out
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:03.920]  yeah it's all it's like sunlight to a vampire i mean as soon as the sunlight
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:07.120]  hits the vampire they're done you know that's all that globalism need was just
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:12.240]  to be exposed exactly exactly um and and it's and this
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:15.760]  has given me an opportunity i mean you're gonna try to shut us down but it's
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:18.880]  not gonna happen and and i was systematically scrubbed
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:23.680]  from the internet from all the filter sites um yeah they erased they raised
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:26.720]  you off the wikipedia page you were a founding member
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:30.800]  and it's like i didn't even care at the point it was like i was in i was in the
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:34.160]  army i was doing you know i might i had a rich life going on
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.160]  i was happy i was like you know you can do that but what has happened now is
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:42.240]  i've started a clearinghouse for music and if anyone wants to check it out go
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:48.320]  to ounces of balances on band camp and um i'm looking for musicians that have
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:53.680]  gone through the same thing as me and artists uh movie producers anybody
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:57.600]  well let's actually well let's actually bear down on this real quick because
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.440]  talk about and i try to explain this to young people and i really think it's
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:05.200]  it's incomprehensible and and i don't want to sit here and say that it's like a
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:09.440]  blanket statement but how much music how has how
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:14.160]  has corporate media if you will engulfed music so so basically like
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:19.120]  how does cardi b become the most popular quote unquote musician
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:23.920]  oh well this is the thing is that all of the
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:29.840]  all it's a huge medium machine where if you sign we were signed to warner
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:34.240]  brothers reprise warner brothers pictures which meant that we were going to be
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:38.560]  in automatically the filter music was going to be in 10 movies that year
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.960]  and we were going to go on all the talk shows we're automatically on mtv
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:49.440]  and then we were making mtv money and mtv was making us money so
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:53.920]  all of this house of cards has fallen down it started again with ron paul and
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:57.520]  now with trump it's actually happening and they're desperately trying to hold
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:02.240]  on to the status quo they are the establishment
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:05.920]  when you silence somebody
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:10.880]  you're afraid and that's what's happening they're afraid because they know
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:14.400]  that the gig is done well and i was gonna say do you think there's a certain
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:18.080]  level where a band let's not we don't have to use filter for
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.000]  example where a band might say oh i want to remove this member from the band
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.120]  because they like trump and i want to get that big record deal and i know we
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:28.320]  won't get that offer unless he's out of the band
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:33.680]  oh yes of course of course of course i've had many offers during the year
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:37.360]  it during the year since filter to go and play with other big name bands
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:41.680]  and i'll get into negotiations with them and they'll be like you're a
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:45.040]  libertarian like you're you're a conservative what
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:49.440]  like you know i'm like yeah well look look at who's more free
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:55.440]  you know look when ron paul said legalize marijuana that was it and if
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.720]  you're an artist a musician and you didn't go with that
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:04.960]  political person who actually had the opportunity to change
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:09.120]  you know decades long prohibition on something that's horrible
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:13.440]  in our history then you're you're you're in jet you're not genuine you're
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.080]  false that's what i'm saying so like i want and
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.000]  again you are the rock star here i'm this is just from an outsider's
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.680]  perspective that's done the research it's not even about music
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:27.280]  most of the time when they sign these deals it's about politics
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:30.880]  i mean they really will pass up a hundred great bands
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:34.080]  that have the best music if they don't like their politics and they'll sign the
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:37.840]  one band that they either know they can control or that they know is
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:41.520]  uneducated in their politics and and that's the one that they'll
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.160]  promote that's the one that will get the record deals
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:47.760]  absolutely absolutely and when i was in filter
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:51.280]  that one thing i did i was a young kid i was in my 20s i couldn't even believe
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:54.640]  i was there you know i was a young kid from cleveland
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.280]  and that then now i'm in now i'm in l.a shooting movies and meeting movie stars
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:05.520]  and i kept my mouth shut because i knew that i i needed to
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.960]  toe the line of what they wanted me to do and believe me we can go into all the
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:12.640]  the whole the all the things that happened there in l.a
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:16.880]  that are so wrong but um i always had in my head what
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:21.680]  i was and and if you speak out you were gone
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:27.040]  and that has to end and it is ending and it
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:31.680]  the the best thing that they could have done is ban alex jones from facebook
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:36.000]  and twitter and youtube because everything that they've been saying was
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.760]  false and we're we're wearing tinfoil hats and we're conspiracy theories for
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:44.880]  decades is right there obvious it's right here there's no denying it
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:49.120]  there's no denying that the left is the party
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:57.200]  of negativity and hatred that's it they've completely switched full circle
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:03.440]  and you know it it's not to say that those people are bad there's so many
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:08.240]  good well-meaning people that are democrats that are being fooled
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:12.320]  and it's really unfortunate and you know
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:16.320]  it's my duty for my kids to come forward at this point and just be like
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:20.320]  you know i i love my country so much that i gave up a
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:23.920]  lucrative musical musical career to join the military because i felt it was the
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:27.280]  right thing to do and i feel it's the right thing to do now to
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.360]  speak out and kind of call richard patrick and filter out but not condemn him
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:35.200]  to support him to support his free speech that i don't like that i would
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:39.280]  consider hate speech because it's very integral to have a
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.240]  vibrant debate and to have the other side
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:46.080]  and i challenge richard patrick to come out
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:51.440]  and support alex jones and end the band to alex jones on facebook
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:56.000]  twitter and youtube and you got a letter in defense to alex jones and i don't
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.920]  know if that's uh uh published anywhere maybe if you want we could publish this

[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.680]  today talking about the website he started for people that are getting
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:48.960]  blackballed from the music industry because of their politics i mean
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:53.120]  that's big i mean that put that on drudge report that that's what needs to
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:57.840]  be on drudge report we'll be right back final segment on the other side
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:02.720]  i've been doing a lot of research into google and youtube censorship
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:06.400]  and i've noticed that there's one type of video
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:11.280]  that is the most censored the most buried the most suppressed
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:17.680]  and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:20.480]  leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:25.760]  get so butt hurt when trump won they don't want us to have that victory they
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.600]  don't want us to remember what political action did
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.000]  and that's why the globalist hillary and others are trying to shut in force now
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.160]  this is a fight about taking your speech away not just my speech
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:42.800]  about taking your very sovereignty away this country is in a war
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:46.320]  so again i want to thank you for what you've done but i want to remind you

[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:19.760]  final segment of this sunday alex jones show
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:24.400]  oh and Troy are filling in for alex today
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:31.200]  you know we had a tragic situation 157 people died in a
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:37.840]  plane crash in ethiopian airlines plane crash and this has been covered on the
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:41.440]  news today and uh i'm not trying to make
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:45.600]  light of this situation folks it's very tragic uh but i wanted to highlight
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:49.040]  something here again this isn't a joke
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:53.600]  um but let me just explain because
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.200]  you can see all the b-roll it's all over television the images are everywhere
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:59.760]  they're out in the field where the plane crash happened
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.520]  and you can see all the debris you can see the plane crash i mean it looks like
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.360]  the site of a plane crash there's a bunch of debris everywhere from the plane
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:10.400]  and uh you know it's what you would expect a
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:16.000]  large massive plane crashing into the ground to look like parts everywhere
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.200]  debris everywhere in a field teams of people there to
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:24.480]  clean it up and actually they even do a crime scene
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:28.880]  because they have to investigate the the debris and the rubble and everything
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.560]  so that they can kind of maybe give a clue as to what happened
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:37.600]  but i'm watching this thinking yeah okay this is what a plane crash site looks
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:42.800]  like for sure but i'd be remissed if i didn't
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:46.480]  use this opportunity and again this is a tragic thing i'm not
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:49.840]  trying to make light of this or divert off of this but if i didn't use this
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:53.600]  opportunity to point something obvious out i feel like i would be missing a
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:58.480]  golden opportunity folks because a lot of people still
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:02.160]  don't understand the 9-11 truth movement
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.000]  i'm not saying i know what happened folks all i know is that we were sold a
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.880]  bill of goods because you look at that plane crash site from the
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:14.240]  ethio open air with ethio open airlines plane crash
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:17.200]  and you compare that the exact same plane that went down
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:23.520]  in pennsylvania on september 11 2001 do you not notice the difference folks
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:31.040]  there's no debris there's literally no debris
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:35.760]  just an hour or two after the plane crashed and there's
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:42.240]  no debris literally none the exact same plane as the ethio open airlines
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:46.000]  so we're just kind of here rolling the b roll showing you images
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.680]  from september 11 the plane crash in pennsylvania
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:56.080]  the side of it no debris none at all you can't find a single piece of rubble
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:01.840]  and then compare that to what you saw from the ethio open airlines plane crash
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:05.280]  that just happened where there's debris and rubble everywhere like you would
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:10.880]  expect from a plane crash so folks look i just want you to use your common sense
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.240]  here i just want you to use your logic here
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:19.040]  when there's a plane crash the side of the plane crash
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:25.360]  there should be a plane okay there was no plane in the field
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:31.040]  in pennsylvania and the fact that the media
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:34.560]  has this country so brainwashed that they can tell you
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:40.240]  look at this plane crash and there's not even a plane
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:45.760]  my god so watching the coverage of the ethio
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:49.200]  open airline plane crash i couldn't help but think about the
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:52.480]  coverage of the plane crash on september 11th in pennsylvania
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:58.240]  where there was no plane again every image they show from the field
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:01.920]  where the ethio open plane crash happened there's debris and rubble
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:05.600]  everywhere like you would expect but somehow magically
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:10.720]  on september 11th 2001 the plane that went down in pennsylvania
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:16.480]  no plane ladies and gentlemen the american government and the american
[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.800]  media
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:25.920]  showed you a plane crash and there was no plane and you fell for it
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:29.040]  i'm not insulting the audience or i'm just saying it's like
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:32.960]  that's where we're at like i'm the storyteller here
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:36.240]  hey look here's a plane crash site where's the plane
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:38.720]  doesn't matter we're the media we're the government we say there was a plane
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:41.200]  crash so there was a plane crash but there's no plane
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:46.400]  shut up conspiracy theorist and so i the crew was like hey remember this
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:49.760]  about 9-11 this is that that they're showing building seven now look there's
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:53.200]  all kinds of stuff from 9-11 folks they lied about the whole thing the whole
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:56.320]  thing was was orchestrated okay now they're
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:01.680]  showing videos of plane crashes so yeah where was all the debris and
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:06.320]  rubble from the plane crash on september 11 2001 folks there was no plane
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:09.760]  or you try to explain that to me uh but anyway

[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:32.720]  alex joneshow on a sunday with a special report on
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:36.480]  how twitter must be up to some dirty tricks when it comes to censoring
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:44.080]  alex jones twitter censorship the three strikes that took down alex jones
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:49.120]  strike one child abuse there was a video that was uploaded that showed a
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:51.840]  child being violently thrown to the ground and crying
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:56.800]  the video in question is a viral meme with over a hundred thousand retweets
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:01.280]  the meme showed a child bullying an adult who was eventually pushed to the ground
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:06.480]  and started crying like a victim the reason this video went viral in 2018
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:10.240]  was because it reflected the strategy of the new american left
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:14.640]  bully your opponents and then cry foul when they try to fight back
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:19.600]  forbes originally claimed that the man in the video was alex jones himself
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:24.400]  and somehow info wars is to blame for a video that remained on twitter
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:29.760]  for months after the fact strike two inciting violence
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:34.560]  um the second one was a video that we viewed um as incitement of violence
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:38.240]  the original video was a message directed towards president trump
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:42.160]  this is an emergency message to president trump to congress and anyone
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:45.840]  that supports free speech in this country twitter ignores this
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:50.080]  they selected a short segment and deceitfully acted as if alex jones was
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:53.760]  inciting violence against the media but now it's time to act on the enemy
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:56.800]  before they do a false flag i know the justice department's crippled a bunch
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:59.920]  of followers and cowards but there's groups there's grand juries there's
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:03.280]  you call for it it's time politically economically and
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:07.840]  judiciously and legally and criminally to move against these people it's got to
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:11.440]  be done now get together the people you know aren't traders and aren't cowards
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:14.480]  and aren't hedging their freaking bets like all these other assholes do and
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:18.160]  let's go let's do it and then there's a bunch of other stuff
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:21.680]  the other stuff that twitter decided to ignore
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:25.200]  made it clear that the statement was being made to president trump
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:29.200]  because they're coming now your wisdom you may be playing possum and waiting
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:32.800]  for him to come in alex jones was encouraging the president to take
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:37.600]  action against internet censorship and after omitting this fact
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:41.920]  they skip forward alex jones reminding americans of the importance of their
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:45.120]  second amendment rights people need to have their battle rivals everything
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:48.880]  ready their backsides you got to be ready does the media is so disciplined
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:51.840]  on their deception and he's attacked all these people at the white house
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:56.640]  beat up reporters beat up women children no coverage twitter does not respect the
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:01.760]  second amendment strike three bullying oliver darcy
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:05.840]  so the third strike um that we we looked at was
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:08.720]  a verbal altercation that alex got into with a journalist
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:12.160]  you're a virus to america and freedom smelling like a possum that climbed out
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:16.080]  of the rear end of a dead cow you look like a possum that got
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:19.600]  caught doing some really really nasty stuff in my view that's enough really
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:22.880]  that's hilarious the altercation with oliver darcy
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:26.320]  is the real reason why alex jones was deleted from twitter
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:29.520]  rather than allowing an open and honest discussion
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:33.920]  and possibly resolving our differences peacefully they choose to silence their
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:37.280]  opposition and push towards a violent civil war
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:42.880]  people have pointed out that jack himself encouraged everyone to read an
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:45.920]  article which basically outlined the fact that there's no
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:50.640]  civility left and that civil war is likely to happen in america
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:54.720]  that says that the article was why there's no bipartisan way forward at this
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:58.400]  juncture in our history one side must win if you
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:02.000]  exacerbate the divisions in society that's so rife right now
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.680]  that is going to create a civil war situation so they're going to be part
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:10.240]  the responsible for it as one of the biggest platforms silencing people
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:12.640]  they're only going to drive them underground they're only going to make
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:16.080]  them more angry more extreme on both sides
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:19.840]  shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the first amendment
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:23.600]  but instead attack dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:28.000]  independent free press working with big tech conspiracy theories is an easy
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.600]  target there are some who worry this is a slippery slope where people with
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:37.200]  different viewpoints could be silenced
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:50.800]  it's simple if you want to beat the globalist if you want to take on the
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:54.560]  new world order i'm not doing bitcoin pumping dumps with jack dorsi
