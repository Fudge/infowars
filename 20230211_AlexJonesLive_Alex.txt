[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000]  What are we going to do now? We've gotten to a point where we are being lulled into this hypnotic state. We're being groomed. We've been taken over. These New World Order people are pissing in our faces. They are turning us into their psychic bitches. They're saying,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  you're doing nothing about it. There's got to become a point in everybody's mind when they realize that they are a sovereign human being and they can get off their couch. They can look in their newspaper. They can see if there's a drag queen story time there. They can see if someone might be mutating viruses in the local area. They can look and see if the people are coming across the border and chopping people's heads off and they can go say something about it. The problem with, a lot of people see what I'm doing. They go down there like, oh, you're really bombastic.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:30.000]  Oh, you're really loud. And it's like, yeah, you know, if we had 10 million people with one candle sitting around Pfizer or Moderna, let's not let them off the hook. It's all about Pfizer now. I almost wonder if Moderna is putting out this crap. They're all, they're all just as guilty. If we had one candle, and I wanted to do this back before January 6th, actually. One candle surrounding the building, millions, millions, millions of people. And you wouldn't even have to say a word. You got, you have
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:02:00.000]  everyone show up and see the full power of humanity. You have everyone kneel down and pray to whoever they want to. And you have them take their candle and sit there and hold it, blow it out, stand up and walk away and do it everywhere and put them on notice. This is how many people we can get to show up at any given time, any given place. And one of these days, we'll see how it goes. Okay. You guys know what you're doing. You know, we know what you're doing. And at a
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.400]  certain point in time, the human race is going to have to get out of their fricking coma and do something about it.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.240]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:50.160]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right. Alex is right about far more than he's wrong. Alex has been right on for over a decade. I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down. Alex Jones was right. Think about how frustrated we are. If you've been awake for a year or two, imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades. Alex Jones called this
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:03:13.360]  years ago. Years ago, Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax. Not for a second. You are one of the great thinkers of this. You are a martyr to the First Amendment. The government fears Alex Jones. That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny. AlexJonesLive.com.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:37.200]  We're in San Diego, California. We're at a location here. We are wondering if they may be possibly doing gain-of-function or directed evolution studies here. Are they mutating viruses here in San Diego County? That's what we want to know. So we're going to ask the people and see what's going on. Let's see.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:04:01.840]  These gut boxes look like the ones in the Wuhan lab, don't they? Quite creepy. I wonder what kind of biological agents they may or may not be working on in there here in San Diego, California. To be honest, I'm getting chills when I look at these things. It's very scary to imagine that just this piece of glass could be all that's between us and a lab leak here in San Diego. What's really going on here at Pfizer?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.520]  What are you afraid of? Why don't you want us filming? Are you working on biological agents here in San Diego?
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.880]  Are you working on biological agents here in San Diego? Told already to stop filming. Apparently,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.160]  to hide, they told us they're going to call the police. But right now, we're on a public sidewalk,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:40.240]  so we're going to exercise our First Amendment. We're going to go see what's up to him. He's
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.120]  running away now. Apparently, he doesn't want to talk to us. What do you know? So apparently,
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.000]  the security guard has decided to run away. He says he's called the police. We're going to see
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.400]  if they actually show up or if he's bluffing. As of now, we're standing on public property,
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.960]  and we are exercising our First Amendment rights. So we are here, and I would encourage any of the
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.240]  citizens of San Diego County and or California to come out here and show them how you feel.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.560]  Now, we're going to do this legally and lawfully. We're going to exercise our First Amendment. We're
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.440]  going to see how far this goes. Is this guy really going to call the police or not? We've been kicked
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.320]  off the campus for taking some innocuous footage of what appears to be a bio weapons type lab,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.440]  much like the one in Wuhan. I'm wondering if these people are concerned that they are in
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.960]  violation of international treaties for bioweapons. The creation of bioweapons is
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.680]  against international law. I wonder if there's anybody here at Pfizer that is considering
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.080]  possibly becoming a whistleblower that maybe can talk to people like Project Veritas.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.000]  Be brave, say something, or we may end up in another bio war. So just as a reminder,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.840]  I have brought them a copy of the Nuremberg Code, and they're also in violation of the
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.520]  International Bio Weapons Convention. So they can leave this here and they can check out
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.120]  exactly how they're in violation and what's going to happen to them if they get caught.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.520]  What is going on in these Pfizer buildings? We're going to find out. We're going to get to the
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.760]  bottom of it. We're going to see if the police are actually going to show up and stop us from
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.800]  exercising our first amendment. Excuse me, Sheriff, how do you feel about protecting the
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:34.400]  box? Pfizer is in violation of the Nuremberg Code. Pfizer is in violation of international
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:43.840]  biological treaties. Pfizer funds synthetic rituals on television. Pfizer is an abomination.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:53.280]  Albert Borla was convicted of three counts of deception in marketing in Britain.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:03.840]  Your Director of mRNA Research says you are mutating viruses. You are in violation of
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:10.800]  international treaties. You will be dealt with. The people of Mars know what you are up to.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:20.320]  We will not stand for your Dr. Mengele BS. Stop what you are doing. Put down the petri dish.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:28.000]  Step away from the glove box. We're not in glove box cooking up viruses so we can make money off
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:37.120]  of the so-called cash cow that your mRNA Director says you are doing. Why is the mRNA vaccine
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:44.960]  affecting women's periods? Are you worried that the mRNA vaccine is causing birth defects?
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:53.040]  Are you concerned with the recent situation of dying suddenly? Why did Tamara Cameron
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:59.760]  die almost on the field only to get brought back to life? What did from the myocarditis
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:07.680]  caused by your vaccine? We all know that your vaccine causes myocarditis. It is one of the
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:14.800]  side effects. Birth defects are side effects. Heart trouble, side effects. Why are people
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.000]  falling over in the streets? Why are people falling over on sports fields because of the
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.800]  perk you are doing in satanic areas such as death? You are all in violation of international codes.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:35.520]  We are the human beings on planet Earth and we demand you stop what you are doing. Step away
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.920]  from the petri dish. Put down the lab coat. Step away from the box. Turn state's evidence for
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:49.680]  humanity. Are you concerned that Project Veritas may have people in your building right now? Are
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.040]  you afraid to talk to your friends wondering if they might find out what you are up to?
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.000]  This is not thank you. We are reporting for human rights. You are in violation of the
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.160]  Nuremberg Cup. You are in violation of international statutes. You are not allowed to become viruses.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:13.680]  At last, your company is involved in satanism. You find satanic principles on TV and you know it.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.160]  You know it. Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you working for this devilish system.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:28.240]  You profit off the pain of humanity. How does it feel? How does it feel having your head in shame?
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:34.640]  Pfizer knows that their vaccines are affecting women's fertility. They are mystified as to why.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.240]  They know it is affecting the endocrine system. They know it is affecting the body. They know
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.680]  it is affecting biocarditis and causing heart attacks in young men. They know all these things
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:52.000]  and yet they continue to laugh. They are working in those labs forcing viruses to become stronger.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.320]  What does not kill you makes you stronger. The vaccine itself is a form of directed evolution.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.160]  Only the fittest viruses will make it through. Only the strongest viruses will make it through.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.200]  Where do all of the variants come from? You ask yourself. Are they creating them or is the
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:16.480]  vaccine itself causing the variants? The vaccine does not stop infection. The vaccine does not
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:24.880]  stop spread. The vaccine is not a vaccine. It is an mRNA gene therapy. You are involved in Dr.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:32.320]  Manuela, Dr. Death level experiments. You will be held accountable. The people of earth are onto you.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.360]  We know what you're doing. We see your experiments. We hear your people.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.280]  Pfizer is committing felonies. Pfizer is committing war crimes. How do you feel working
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.920]  for a company that funds satanic rituals on television? How do you feel funding research
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:11:00.640]  to mutate viruses? Your director of mRNA research says and I quote, we are making viruses to make
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:08.160]  money. Do you admit that myocarditis is being caused by the vaccine? Do you admit that women's
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:14.800]  fertility is being affected by the vaccine? Do you admit that the vaccine does not stop the spread?
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:22.560]  Do you admit that the vaccine is not safe or effective? Do you admit that the vaccine is in fact
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:29.520]  a bioweapon against biological warfare treaties? I find it interesting that we have a cancer
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.680]  research connected with a vaccine research center when we know that cancer viruses were found in
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:44.240]  polio vaccines. People are falling on their faces on national television brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:50.800]  Satanic rituals brought to you by Pfizer. Numerical violations brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:58.480]  Every news program on TV brought to you by Pfizer is not funny when you make money off a so-called
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:05.680]  cash cow. Yes, your director of mRNA research and development said he's making money.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.680]  Police officers, in case you didn't catch the video, did you watch the video? Did you see the
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:19.760]  video where their head of mRNA research said they were making money off of the cash cow of creating
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:26.880]  new viruses? Did you watch that video by Project Veritas? Did you watch it? Did you watch it, sir?
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.960]  Did you see the video? Did you see the video? Did you see the video?
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.640]  So obviously you guys have the right to film, right? We're not mad about that.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.080]  How are you mad about what these guys are doing here? No, I want to know. Are you guys mad about
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.400]  what they're doing? Have you seen it? I don't know what you're talking about. You haven't seen the
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.440]  Project Veritas video. What I'm here to talk to you about is the megaphone. You can't be using
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.560]  the megaphone. It's already noisy. You're not interested. I'm not using a megaphone. Are you not
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:59.040]  interested in knowing that they laugh? I'm not making this up. They laugh on TV about making
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:06.640]  mRNA mutating viruses so they can make money off, and I quote, the director of mRNA research
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:12.240]  makes money off mutating viruses for the quote-unquote cash cow. We're not the audience
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.880]  you want to be talking to. It doesn't matter. You are the audience. You're the human race.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.000]  I want you to look it up. Are you ignoring the reality? You guys were forced vaccinated.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.840]  Are you ignoring the reality? What's going on? Do you know what the problems are with the vaccines?
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.680]  Do you know that women are having miscarriages because of the vaccine? I don't care. You don't
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:31.280]  care? He doesn't care. This guy doesn't care. This is what we're doing. I don't have an ID.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:38.160]  They literally don't care. It's irrelevant. So here we are being hassled by the police who
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:44.000]  admittedly do not care that you are getting infected by viruses that they admit that they
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.600]  were forced vaccinated.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.440]  Actually, they took my YouTube channel because of people like this who won't allow people to speak
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:03.200]  out. I'm going to tell you to look it up. I'm not trying to be attached to anything for your
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:13.360]  purposes. What I'm doing is I'm telling you to look up Project Veritas mutating viruses.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.160]  Don't ask what we're doing. What are you doing? I'm here. All right, this is nice enough. We're
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:28.240]  done here. Thank you. It is my dearest intention that somebody in here actually tells us what's
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:34.320]  going on. Whether they do it in broad daylight or if they have to call in and do it anonymously,
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.360]  I would beg you please let us know what's happening. Are they mutating viruses here in San Diego?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:15:01.360]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:07.040]  corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices. CNN is not
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.840]  just fake news. It's the criminal news network that works as a racketeering crime syndicate
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.600]  to openly shut down my media operations and other people's media operations.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.240]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.000]  You didn't call me to testify in America. I have a right to fix my accusers. And you,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.480]  Congressman Deutch, are a liar and a fraud. You are a charlatan that goes around lying about
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.520]  people who destroy the First Amendment. I haven't lied about anyone else. Yes,
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.000]  you are a congenital liar. Swallow's Well. Why do you hate the First Amendment so much?
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.840]  There goes Congressman Swallow's Well. The American people demand that their First
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.040]  Amendment be defended. Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.920]  Amendment but instead attack dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down independent
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.440]  free press working with big tech. And the deplatforming didn't work.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.200]  AlexJonesLive.com because the future is in
[00:16:01.343 --> 00:16:31.343]  your hands.
[00:16:31.343 --> 00:16:38.423]  Finland as well needed the vote from Turkey but talks disintegrated after a Swedish Danish
[00:16:38.423 --> 00:16:43.983]  politician set fire to the Koran in front of the Turkish embassy in Stockholm.
[00:16:43.983 --> 00:16:50.823]  On Saturday Rasmus Paludin head of a far-right Danish party held a protest in front of Turkey's
[00:16:50.823 --> 00:16:53.223]  embassy in Stockholm.
[00:16:53.223 --> 00:16:59.423]  The Swedish Danish national set fire to the Koran that has put Sweden's NATO application
[00:16:59.423 --> 00:17:00.423]  in jeopardy.
[00:17:00.423 --> 00:17:06.863]  Accession to the military alliance must be approved unanimously by member states including
[00:17:06.863 --> 00:17:08.263]  Turkey.
[00:17:08.263 --> 00:17:15.103]  After Erdogan's declaration Turkey and northern Syria were devastated by a series of earthquakes
[00:17:15.103 --> 00:17:21.582]  in southern Turkey with a death toll that has reached well over 11,000 people.
[00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:26.223]  We are finished my god there is nobody here, nobody.
[00:17:26.223 --> 00:17:27.903]  What kind of state is this?
[00:17:27.903 --> 00:17:32.943]  Turkey is no stranger to earthquakes, the majority of them occurring in the eastern
[00:17:32.943 --> 00:17:35.743]  and western portions of the country.
[00:17:35.743 --> 00:17:41.743]  But strange anomalies occurred just before the earthquakes leading many to question whether
[00:17:41.743 --> 00:17:47.783]  a harp weapon may have been used to punish the Turkish government for failing to toe
[00:17:47.783 --> 00:17:51.623]  the line of NATO's new world order overlords.
[00:17:51.623 --> 00:17:54.423]  I am speaking on behalf of the United States.
[00:17:54.423 --> 00:17:56.903]  I know which journalists have been made to write articles about this.
[00:17:56.903 --> 00:17:59.183]  Get your dirty hands off of Turkey.
[00:17:59.183 --> 00:18:00.703]  What am I saying?
[00:18:00.703 --> 00:18:03.383]  Get your dirty hands off of Turkey.
[00:18:21.623 --> 00:18:25.423]  What about other countries, the Russians, the Chinese, the European Union, do they have
[00:18:25.423 --> 00:18:27.423]  similar programs doctor?
[00:18:27.423 --> 00:18:33.822]  The European community has a facility in Tromsø, Norway, that is part of what they call the
[00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:41.503]  ice gap community there that actually was a facility like harp that has been around
[00:18:41.503 --> 00:18:42.903]  a lot longer than harp.
[00:18:42.903 --> 00:18:48.943]  The Smithsonian is reporting and the Daily Mail is reporting and a bunch of other publications
[00:18:48.943 --> 00:18:49.943]  are reporting.
[00:18:50.263 --> 00:18:57.223]  China and Russia are working together to heat the atmosphere for weather control using large
[00:18:57.223 --> 00:19:03.463]  antenna arrays on the ground directed by satellites in space.
[00:19:03.463 --> 00:19:06.783]  This is weather modification on a global scale.
[00:19:06.783 --> 00:19:11.863]  In fact, these programs are so large and so all-encompassing that all other weather
[00:19:11.863 --> 00:19:18.342]  modification programs that go on on a smaller regional basis are virtually, they're negated
[00:19:18.342 --> 00:19:21.583]  by the scope and scale of the global geoengineering programs.
[00:19:21.583 --> 00:19:25.143]  The saturation, which ionizes the atmosphere, makes the atmosphere more conductive.
[00:19:25.143 --> 00:19:30.863]  We have the harp facilities, high frequency active auroral research program.
[00:19:30.863 --> 00:19:32.543]  These are ionosphere heaters.
[00:19:32.543 --> 00:19:34.903]  Many have heard of the harp facilities.
[00:19:34.903 --> 00:19:36.822]  There's not just one or two or three.
[00:19:36.822 --> 00:19:40.743]  We believe there's at least 18 around the globe, possibly with three more being built
[00:19:40.743 --> 00:19:42.023]  in Antarctica right now.
[00:19:42.023 --> 00:19:45.342]  We were able to identify each frequency.
[00:19:45.342 --> 00:19:49.623]  We accomplished this with just 30 watts of radio power.
[00:19:49.623 --> 00:19:56.223]  If you do this with a billion watts, the vibrations are so violent that the entire piano would
[00:19:56.223 --> 00:19:57.223]  shake.
[00:19:57.223 --> 00:19:59.423]  In fact, the whole house would shake.
[00:19:59.423 --> 00:20:04.783]  In fact, the vibrations could be so severe underground that could even cause an earthquake.
[00:20:04.783 --> 00:20:11.103]  These weapons of geopolitical terrorism will be able to mold the climate change narrative
[00:20:11.103 --> 00:20:17.103]  and bend countries to the will of the New World Order as the target date of UN agenda
[00:20:17.103 --> 00:20:19.822]  2030 draws nigh.
[00:20:19.822 --> 00:20:27.583]  In short, the New World Order is a weapon system, a planetary terraforming operation,
[00:20:27.583 --> 00:20:32.183]  genetically changing the planet's genetic makeup, changing the atmosphere's makeup,
[00:20:32.183 --> 00:20:38.063]  changing the tectonic activity of the planet, changing the oceans, changing all life, changing
[00:20:38.063 --> 00:20:42.383]  the radiological background, changing the magnetic background.
[00:20:42.383 --> 00:20:48.743]  Every observation we see shows this modern system is doing one thing, killing us.
[00:20:48.743 --> 00:21:03.663]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:21:03.663 --> 00:21:08.143]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Friday night broadcast.
[00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:12.423]  We're about 19 minutes past six o'clock central standard time.
[00:21:12.423 --> 00:21:16.263]  We heard some of the very important reports we've been working on over at Infowars.com.
[00:21:16.623 --> 00:21:19.743]  This is Alex Jones live, a production I do out of my house.
[00:21:19.743 --> 00:21:23.743]  We also simulcast over at Infowars and as I promised at least several days a week, I'm
[00:21:23.743 --> 00:21:29.703]  going to do live commercial free podcasts, interviews, analysis, PowerPoints, you name
[00:21:29.703 --> 00:21:35.663]  it from this studio and some other studios that we have developed.
[00:21:35.663 --> 00:21:40.143]  Now I wanted to get Matt Baker, who's a great citizen activist and journalist on because
[00:21:40.143 --> 00:21:45.623]  he was on my show 45 minutes or so yesterday on the Infowars Thursday broadcast was really
[00:21:45.623 --> 00:21:49.943]  on fire, trying to make a lot of different points and he got to a lot of them, but I
[00:21:49.943 --> 00:21:54.023]  wanted to go back and recap the points that he got to and expand on those and get to all
[00:21:54.023 --> 00:21:57.302]  the other points he didn't get to because lost in translation, he thought he was on
[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.903]  for an hour, but only had him on for 30 minutes.
[00:21:58.903 --> 00:22:02.503]  Then I had a bunch of callers, so I kind of held him over, but with callers, he couldn't
[00:22:02.503 --> 00:22:04.503]  get to all his points.
[00:22:04.503 --> 00:22:08.583]  He's also going to have a protest against Pfizer in San Diego that I kind of called
[00:22:08.583 --> 00:22:08.743]  for.
[00:22:08.743 --> 00:22:12.183]  He said people should join him out there with his viral video of him protesting a few
[00:22:12.183 --> 00:22:13.383]  days ago.
[00:22:13.383 --> 00:22:15.463]  So I said, Hey, how about Sunday, 3 PM Pacific?
[00:22:15.463 --> 00:22:16.463]  And he said, great.
[00:22:16.463 --> 00:22:19.302]  So we'll get an update from him on that.
[00:22:19.302 --> 00:22:21.463]  Let me just raise this point first though.
[00:22:21.463 --> 00:22:27.063]  When you get so close to the news and so close to sources and breaking information, you really
[00:22:27.063 --> 00:22:28.822]  almost get to where you take yourself for granted.
[00:22:28.822 --> 00:22:30.743]  I know I do that.
[00:22:30.743 --> 00:22:36.583]  And we have a lot of sources obviously inside the Proud Boys Seditious Conspiracy Trial
[00:22:36.583 --> 00:22:39.383]  that's meant to demonize all Americans in free speech.
[00:22:39.463 --> 00:22:43.223]  So I learned when the trial started a month ago, some pretty shocking information from
[00:22:43.223 --> 00:22:44.023]  inside sources.
[00:22:44.023 --> 00:22:48.983]  I'll leave it at that and should have reached out to Tucker Carlson, should have talked
[00:22:48.983 --> 00:22:51.623]  about it on air, but I was waiting to get more info.
[00:22:51.623 --> 00:22:56.103]  And then earlier this week and tonight, in fact, one reason I aired a few promos and
[00:22:56.103 --> 00:23:01.302]  got on about 20 minutes after the show started was because I was on with sources in DC that
[00:23:01.302 --> 00:23:06.583]  are describing expert sources, what the judge was doing when the media and the jury were
[00:23:06.583 --> 00:23:07.063]  kicked out.
[00:23:07.783 --> 00:23:10.663]  But this will be breaking regardless next week.
[00:23:11.623 --> 00:23:14.503]  And you're just getting tomorrow's news today.
[00:23:15.143 --> 00:23:18.743]  We know about Ray Abs and the other feds that were there calling for attacking the Capitol,
[00:23:19.463 --> 00:23:22.822]  but now amongst a bunch of information that's about to come out with documents.
[00:23:24.583 --> 00:23:27.463]  And I'm not going to get the specifics because I don't want to mess up the defense of the
[00:23:27.463 --> 00:23:36.423]  Proud Boys, but the feds screwed up mightily and they used evidence that they'd planted
[00:23:36.423 --> 00:23:43.383]  just like the Governor Whitmer kidnapping with a former high-level CIA operative and
[00:23:43.383 --> 00:23:52.743]  a female individual, not saying she's a sex operative or swallow as they call them, to
[00:23:52.743 --> 00:23:59.623]  give a war game to the Proud Boys that they never acted on of taking over DC.
[00:24:01.223 --> 00:24:02.822]  And it's actually a CIA war game.
[00:24:03.703 --> 00:24:06.023]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:24:06.023 --> 00:24:10.342]  We also know it's come out in the news that a federal informant when Enrique Tarrio was
[00:24:10.342 --> 00:24:14.183]  about to leave DC, when he'd been ordered to on January 4th, he was there January 5th,
[00:24:14.183 --> 00:24:20.342]  about to leave, he went to that underground garage meeting or that garage car park meeting.
[00:24:21.703 --> 00:24:25.943]  And it was just a meeting to say, Hey, we're leaving, be safe between the Proud Boys and
[00:24:25.943 --> 00:24:29.703]  the Oath Keepers and Stuart Rhodes.
[00:24:30.583 --> 00:24:36.423]  And we know there was quote, informants, informants, informers there, but we now know specifically
[00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:38.983]  who the informants are.
[00:24:38.983 --> 00:24:43.382]  And let's just say this, I'm not saying the Proud Boys are a bad group.
[00:24:43.382 --> 00:24:45.382]  They fought Antifa, they showed up for free speech.
[00:24:45.382 --> 00:24:48.583]  Overall, they were good people, but any group like that that's open to the public is going
[00:24:48.583 --> 00:24:49.302]  to be infiltrated.
[00:24:49.943 --> 00:24:54.583]  And the old joke about a KKK meeting in the seventies and eighties and nineties and 2000s
[00:24:54.583 --> 00:24:58.983]  was if you had 10 KKK members, probably eight of them were federal agents, including the
[00:24:58.983 --> 00:25:05.943]  leader, just like the Whitmer kidnapping plot was the majority, the leaders, people
[00:25:05.943 --> 00:25:09.623]  running it all were FBI informants and FBI.
[00:25:09.623 --> 00:25:12.342]  And they got a few people say, okay, I guess I'll go along with the attack.
[00:25:12.983 --> 00:25:14.902]  So a real setup, no attack ever happened.
[00:25:16.822 --> 00:25:24.822]  So I'm going to reach out to some other sources I have so I can reverse engineer this.
[00:25:25.783 --> 00:25:30.983]  The government has a name for it when they illegally get information and then they've
[00:25:30.983 --> 00:25:34.423]  got to go out and find other witnesses that also saw it legally.
[00:25:34.423 --> 00:25:35.943]  They call it parallel construction.
[00:25:36.743 --> 00:25:40.263]  And so as a journalist, I'm allowed to know these things and talk to these people, but
[00:25:40.263 --> 00:25:41.703]  I don't want to hurt our sources.
[00:25:42.342 --> 00:25:45.543]  So I'm going to do some parallel construction to also verify these reports, even though
[00:25:45.543 --> 00:25:49.143]  I've already verified them and I've got to get on the phone to some witnesses and some
[00:25:49.143 --> 00:25:53.703]  other people so that I can call up these individuals and say, Hey, I know about this.
[00:25:53.703 --> 00:25:54.423]  What do you want to tell me?
[00:25:55.223 --> 00:25:56.663]  Will you come on record about this?
[00:25:57.302 --> 00:26:01.463]  So I've got some work to do and folks like Cy Hirsch can spend six months on a story
[00:26:01.463 --> 00:26:03.223]  like this and they do a great job.
[00:26:03.223 --> 00:26:08.342]  Like with the pipeline explosion that I told you day one was the Navy and a remote detonation
[00:26:08.342 --> 00:26:08.902]  all the rest of it.
[00:26:08.902 --> 00:26:11.783]  I can just tell from the history in the background that's down.
[00:26:11.783 --> 00:26:13.223]  Cy Hirsch's report with his sources.
[00:26:13.943 --> 00:26:18.023]  So I kind of shoot from the hip a lot of times, but nine times I've said, I'm right.
[00:26:18.822 --> 00:26:23.703]  One smart thing Donald Trump said was the deepest thing he ever learned was to be shallow.
[00:26:24.263 --> 00:26:26.023]  It's like a woman's intuition.
[00:26:26.023 --> 00:26:30.743]  You study, you have knowledge, you're always researching all the pieces and then your first
[00:26:30.743 --> 00:26:34.103]  approximation is usually dead on right.
[00:26:35.143 --> 00:26:39.543]  The best shots I've ever made with a gun is when I don't try and I can shoot it here at
[00:26:39.543 --> 00:26:41.063]  800, a thousand yards.
[00:26:41.063 --> 00:26:42.983]  I just relax, pull back.
[00:26:42.983 --> 00:26:43.623]  This is an analogy.
[00:26:43.623 --> 00:26:48.743]  I'm not saying I'm going to shoot anybody and squeeze trigger and the deer goes rolling
[00:26:48.743 --> 00:26:51.223]  head over heels or the wild hog or whatever it is.
[00:26:51.223 --> 00:26:53.463]  I'm not going to have time to go hunting.
[00:26:54.342 --> 00:26:55.143]  And it's the same thing.
[00:26:55.143 --> 00:26:56.583]  I don't just go off half cocked.
[00:26:57.463 --> 00:26:58.663]  I don't just go off with no info.
[00:26:58.663 --> 00:27:00.983]  I do all this deep research, immerse myself constantly.
[00:27:00.983 --> 00:27:04.423]  And then nine times out of 10 when I just shoot from the hip with what I originally
[00:27:04.423 --> 00:27:06.822]  think it is, the first approximation is usually right.
[00:27:07.623 --> 00:27:11.623]  And they want us to cut off our instincts, cut off our common sense that we know is there.
[00:27:12.743 --> 00:27:15.623]  Another analogy is you've ever had somebody physically attack you.
[00:27:15.623 --> 00:27:19.783]  If you think about what you're doing or you try to over-become technical, that's when
[00:27:19.783 --> 00:27:20.503]  you get your ass kicked.
[00:27:20.503 --> 00:27:24.423]  Well, you just decided to get somebody off of you and just, I'm going to stop this person.
[00:27:24.423 --> 00:27:28.183]  It just happens right away because you turn loose your instincts, but you've got to have
[00:27:28.183 --> 00:27:33.063]  the baseline of research and info for your synapses to access to make its decision.
[00:27:33.063 --> 00:27:36.663]  You don't have the big baseline, the foundation of research info history.
[00:27:36.663 --> 00:27:38.183]  I'm using fighting as an analogy.
[00:27:38.183 --> 00:27:46.423]  It's a primitive version of that, that you really can't be able to have that instinct
[00:27:46.583 --> 00:27:50.663]  and that incident analysis, but also do a lot of deep thinking and a lot of research
[00:27:50.663 --> 00:27:53.543]  and a lot of weighing of things politically, culturally.
[00:27:54.103 --> 00:27:58.902]  But when I try to do that, I'm usually not able to come to the answer where there's so
[00:27:58.902 --> 00:28:03.382]  many pieces, but I'll just look back at all the pieces and say, okay, gut, what is it?
[00:28:03.382 --> 00:28:04.503]  The gut says it's this.
[00:28:05.223 --> 00:28:06.743]  And it's almost always that.
[00:28:07.302 --> 00:28:10.183]  So they're trying to get us away from our instincts and that basic information.
[00:28:10.183 --> 00:28:12.902]  So look for that on the Sunday show four to 6 PM.
[00:28:12.902 --> 00:28:15.543]  You're like, Hey, we know it was a stage event at January six.
[00:28:15.543 --> 00:28:16.743]  Yeah, we know.
[00:28:16.743 --> 00:28:17.063]  Yeah.
[00:28:17.063 --> 00:28:20.743]  You know, Twitter was working with the government to spy on people and suppress the election.
[00:28:21.382 --> 00:28:23.783]  But now we got the Twitter files that could bring down all the big tech.
[00:28:23.783 --> 00:28:25.463]  That's just one group we exposed.
[00:28:25.463 --> 00:28:27.382]  Now it's all confirmed what we knew when they're having hearings.
[00:28:27.382 --> 00:28:32.902]  So yes, it's one thing to know all this and no Ray Epps told the January six committee
[00:28:32.902 --> 00:28:38.342]  that he was orchestrating it, but he had a bunch of help.
[00:28:39.463 --> 00:28:40.902]  But it's very telling under oath.
[00:28:40.902 --> 00:28:42.183]  He knew he could be being set up.
[00:28:42.183 --> 00:28:45.063]  So Ray Epps said, no, I orchestrated the attack.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:29:01.820]  So there's no honor amongst these people, and that's really the good news is there's
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:06.040]  more and more minions of the system figure out that they're not going to be protected
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.040]  going along with this.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.040]  The new order is a bad thing for everybody, including the controllers when you get back
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.040]  to sanity.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:18.480]  And look, Seymour Hersh, he's been around since the My Lai massacre, and you know, the
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.980]  last third of the Vietnam war, he's won so many prizes, he's always had sources.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:30.280]  And he's a conduit that different factions in the US intelligence system used to get
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:35.580]  news out when they think the main system is about to start World War Three.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:41.580]  So Seymour Hersh knows where the divers got trained in Panama City.
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.900]  They know where all this stuff got carried out.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.180]  They know how the attack was run.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.180]  He names the names.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.180]  He has the sources.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.020]  Biden blew up the pipeline, his controllers blew up the pipeline, Biden and Victoria Nuland
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.980]  bragged repeatedly they were going to blow it up.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.300]  And so the story is that the Seymour Hersh came out and gave the exact details that was
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.300]  done.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.740]  I told you that the day it happened, now I think it was done because I had that instant
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.340]  analysis because I know the research, the background, how it all works.
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.820]  Anybody else can research it knowing.
[00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:18.389]  But the, but, but the bigger story is, is that hers is going public and has all these insiders
[00:30:19.189 --> 00:30:22.230]  that think things are so dangerous. They're blowing the whistle on this.
[00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.669]  And again, I apologize if I'm coughing some, I, uh, left my lung cleanse
[00:30:26.629 --> 00:30:32.550]  on my office desk like a fool. Uh, and I can go to the Walgreens, but they just have the regular
[00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:36.710]  throat spray that helps a little. I haven't had laryngitis even when I had covered two years ago,
[00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:42.790]  but I have, I've had laryngitis since I was a teenager, I think. And I have had laryngitis
[00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:49.110]  for about a week. Uh, and so I'm constantly battling, not coughing, you know, laryngitis is.
[00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:55.030]  So please bear with me, please bear with me. Uh, or I've got to hit the cough button occasionally.
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:03.260]  It's going to be all right. I almost canceled the night show is because my bronchials, they're
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.700]  getting better. They're better than they were two days ago, but Matt Baker has such important
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.460]  information to cover. We came here to do it and I appreciate the crew coming here to do it
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:16.540]  for alexjoneslive.com. Please share the URL alexjoneslive.com. Uh, the site's ready to go.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.460]  I just got to propagate it with all the first videos that are going to go on it.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.420]  So very soon, I said a week, not weeks gone by, but let's just say another week.
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:31.180]  It's not for want of trying, uh, but, but we're going to have the whole side up and a lot of
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.620]  things. I'm going to shoot some of the big PowerPoint presentations and do some of the
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.580]  podcast interviews and more things that we promised you. Uh, but, uh, it's been exciting to have
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:48.540]  people like Mike Adams and Pete Santilli, uh, and, uh, now Matt Baker, uh, on with us
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:55.580]  as some of our first guests. So, uh, Matt Baker, we played the full 10 minute, uh, video that you
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.500]  have on manned out video and on your popular Twitter account of you going out and protesting
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.820]  Pfizer and, and, and so many times I missed the main point and you came on my show yesterday.
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:08.460]  You said the point is I want to get a bunch of people out here, not just me and my cameraman,
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:14.139]  we don't, you know, 2 million views on Twitter is great, but the key is magic. Any thousands
[00:32:14.139 --> 00:32:18.460]  like to do in Europe out there protesting the fact they're conducting illegal gain of function
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.780]  on things that could end civilization as we know it in their words or cash cow. So
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:26.620]  recap what happened, what's coming out, any new developments? We talked about a demonstration
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:31.100]  Sunday at 3 p.m. And then you got your notes still, you were making some fascinating,
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:35.660]  informative points, but we were on a time crunch yesterday. So I'd like you to be able to have the
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:41.580]  floor and just go over those points. I got a lot going on here. Uh, first of all, I can never say
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:46.220]  no to Alex Jones and I swear every time he gets me on, he has me like, you're going to do this,
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:50.139]  right? And I'm like, yes, sir. I'll do whatever you say. And on Wednesday, super middle Super
[00:32:50.139 --> 00:32:55.900]  bowl. That's fine. I ended up talking with some local people that I do some protests with
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.980]  the back in the day during the lockdowns and they're continuing to do a lot of protests
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:04.060]  with the drag queen story times and some other things. There's about three different factions
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:09.260]  that I'm working with. So I talked to them about when the best time that they wanted to do it was,
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.260]  and it's a little bit out, but it's good because we're going to have time to get it together.
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:18.380]  So the new date and we're sticking to this, you know, you put me on the spot there was,
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:27.100]  um, is Wednesday 22nd. Okay. And it's between 11 and two o'clock. All right. And, uh, Audra
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:32.780]  Morgan is the one that's helping put that together. She is a local. I'm glad you changed it. I just
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:37.260]  said, how about 3 p.m. Sunday? Not thinking about the super bowl. Like I said, I, I just can't say
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:42.540]  no to you, bro. You were saying, you were saying, get out here and help me and you're damn right.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:48.460]  That's the answer. No, I am. I do. I know. And I want, and the thing is I want it to be a big
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:53.180]  effect. I don't want it to be 10 people. I don't want it to, that will, that will demoralize the
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.940]  rest of the people that want to come out later. They'll say, Oh, that wasn't a big hit. It's not
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:02.060]  going to happen. I'm, I'm joining a group of people. I'm getting together. Like I said,
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:06.940]  about three different factions of people that go out and go to school boards, people that go to
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:12.540]  the city council meetings, people that, um, go to the drag queen story times. And I'm trying to bring
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.460]  some factions that have actually split up over time, over different things. I'm trying to use
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:21.660]  this as a unifying situation to bring everybody back together. Now, anybody who's in San Diego
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:28.060]  area, if you want to hit me up, add them on my Twitter at slave underscore two, underscore
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:34.140]  Liberty, hit me up. I posted that flyer. That's the opening flyer for the thing. Leave me a comment
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:38.220]  and I'll end up texting you so we can keep you in the loop of everything that's going on. I want
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:44.140]  new people, new blood coming into this movement. I have a challenge, the Matt Baker challenge,
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:48.620]  because everyone thinks, Oh, thank you for what you're doing. It's great. It's amazing. It's like,
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:55.980]  it's so like easy. I'm telling you, all you have to do is get up. And it's fun. And it's fun once
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.300]  you do it. So, so we're going to talk about the 26th and promote that people should protest Pfizer
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.820]  in any city where there's evil organizations there. But for listeners who are tuning in,
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.460]  tell people what you did, why you're mad at Pfizer, what's coming out.
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:12.940]  Okay. Well the project Veritas coming out with Jordan Trischner Walker admitting that they are
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:19.100]  mutating viruses and that they are doing basically gain of function, directed evolution, and that
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:25.580]  they're using it to create a cash cow in their own words, making money off human suffering. It's
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:30.620]  disgusting. And the fact that we're sitting around and we're just think it's funny. You know what's
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:37.260]  happening here on every level, we're being groomed. We are, the cucking is the grooming. It's the
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:41.820]  physical, the grooming of the children is the grooming of the adult population. You say it
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:46.700]  all the time. They want to see what they can get away with. They want to piss in our faces. Okay.
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.860]  So as they groom the children, they're grooming the adults. When the adults put up with it,
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:56.540]  you're being groomed. When they tell you on TV, yeah, we're mutating viruses. You're being groomed.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:00.940]  When they say, yeah, we blew up the pipeline in your gas crisis. I've gone through the roof.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:06.300]  You're being groomed. Okay. All of this is grooming. The balloon is a form of grooming.
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.180]  They're grooming you into aerial warfare. America is blowing up things over America.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.340]  There's lasers coming out of the sky. It's just like what happened in the beginning with the
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:19.500]  Wuhan situation where they would show you the people falling over. And then they heard the
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:25.660]  screams from the people in the buildings. This is all the echoes of the insanity and
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:31.100]  the psychological operation. I agree. They're easing us into a soft world war three.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:37.820]  Exactly. And what they're doing with, you see the pipelines blowing up. You see the planes. You see
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:42.300]  locally here in San Diego, I had like a Black Hawk and this isn't like back in the day,
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:48.940]  old school Alex Jones, but literal Black Hawks flying around our town over the top of houses,
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:56.220]  rattling windows, landing in local shopping centers and blowing doors off buildings in
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:01.260]  supposed, you know, they're doing drills. And look at Hawaii with the giant
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:06.779]  laser shooting out of space. Exactly. So with the lasers and all this stuff,
[00:37:06.779 --> 00:37:10.860]  it's just putting it in your head. You're going into war. You're going into war. They're lulling
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:17.820]  you. It's a form of hypnotism is what they're doing. Back when the lockdowns first started,
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:22.300]  the amount of hypnotism on TV, wear a mask, wear a mask, wear a mask, stay inside, stay inside,
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:27.500]  COVID-19 was classified, was run by major military operations of every country.
[00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:34.060]  Yeah. We black it out now because it's so painful to really put yourself back in the mindset of
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:39.340]  what it was like to literally turn on the TV and have every single second them saying COVID, COVID,
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:44.300]  COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, just brainwashing you and putting you into a trance.
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.779]  This is what they're doing with these balloons. And I got to say, again, I'm not one of those
[00:37:48.779 --> 00:37:53.580]  that don't know they shot another one down over Alaska today. They're saying from China.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.340]  And I would say, I don't believe that, but China saying that the balloons were there. So
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:04.220]  what do you make of this? I don't know. Actually, I'd really like to know what the information and
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:09.900]  proof is that we say China says. So like, where is the actual proof of that? You know, like,
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:16.540]  who said so? Did Xi Jinping say so? Did some random Chinese looking woman on a feed say it?
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:20.620]  I mean, where are we getting this information from? What I know about the balloon is,
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:26.860]  is why would they admit that their airspace was invaded? Wouldn't they just do the standard
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:31.340]  operating procedure and just say, patriots or people come out and they say, oh, it looks like
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:36.380]  a Chinese spy balloon. They go, no, that's a conspiracy theory. This is a weather balloon.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:46.620]  Once they said that right there, I was like, this is total BS. Why wouldn't they just have a cover
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:51.100]  story for it and just right away, shut everyone up and say, that is a weather balloon. Because I
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:55.020]  mean, to me, it looks like a weather balloon kind of. I mean, I would buy it. I would just,
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.500]  I would be clicking through like, oh, I'm going to do a story on this. I'm like,
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:02.380]  ah, weather balloon. Okay. It's no big deal. But no, they're like, it's happening. The Chinese
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:07.180]  are spying on us. They're over our country. They're surveilling our place. They also have,
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:11.900]  you know, the EMP things going on, putting that in our head with the cyber attack, all coming
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:19.180]  together with these little mini lockdowns, mini shutdowns they've been doing with the airports.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:23.340]  They're shutting down the airports and then the little mini electric grids go out and then little
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:27.900]  parts of the system are going out and they're testing and they're going to do their cyber
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:36.860]  warfare. He says their next big power grab will be a giant cyber attack shut down. And so they're
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.860]  going to do that. They're going to test different sectors to make sure their minions have the cover
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.740]  stories and all of it ready. I mean, I agree with you that whether some of this is staged or all of
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:51.100]  its stage or part of it staged, they're definitely beta testing and pre-programming the power going
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:56.940]  off to bring in the banking system and a new banking reset and the central bank digital
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:01.980]  currencies. That's their embedded plan. I mean, that's the big picture. We all know that. I mean,
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:07.180]  listen to Alex Jones for a long time. It's kind of good. I gotta just say it's nice. I gotta say
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:13.900]  I'm incredibly honored to be in your home on your home studio on the third episode of Alex Jones
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:20.140]  Live. This is great. And what's the URL now is the one that's shareable. I just put it up on
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:26.300]  my Twitter is conspiracyfact.com. And that's from a fundraiser here two weeks ago, but we're
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:30.940]  about to update it where it just says, you know, Alex Jones forbid the feed and then later they'll
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:35.180]  ban that URL. We'll just create a new site that has it, but yeah, they're blocking the regular
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:42.060]  URLs like infowars.com and banned video everywhere. Yeah. So the big picture, as we all know, I mean,
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:46.620]  if anyone is just tuning in for the first day here, yeah, they want to put us in a digital
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:51.340]  prison that you'll never get out of where you'll have CBDCs. You'll have your digital bank notes.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:56.220]  You'll have your social credit score. There'll be a biometric. It kind of reminds me of an old Alex
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:03.500]  Jones video that I watched back in 2000. Yeah. And so people want to pretend like Q has opened
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:07.660]  up everyone's mind. I was just arguing with a buddy of mine and no offense to the Q people,
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:13.180]  but they're like, Q exposed so many things. And I said, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, just tell me one
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:18.380]  thing that Q exposed that Alex Jones or the truth movement hadn't exposed previously. And he was
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:22.380]  dumbfounded. He couldn't say it. He's like, yeah, it brought a lot of us together. I'm like, yeah,
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:27.340]  but it's this nebulous thing that nobody knows what it is and these different boards and they
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:32.620]  can inject weirdness and they leave everybody hanging and there's no accountability to it.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.460]  There's Alex Jones, the man. I've got to say, this is something I really wanted to bring up. This is
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.140]  a fricking giant problem. This is something I didn't even get into the other day. I'm not going
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:46.540]  to say names, but this is like putting chills down my spine as a patriot. Okay. I'm not going
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:52.860]  to say who they are, but this is a real fricking story. Okay. A couple of my friends that are in
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:58.220]  the movement that have gotten shows. That's as far as I'm going to say. Okay. They've been,
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:02.300]  they've let me on their shows and they said, oh yeah, come on man. We're all buddies. Yeah. You
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.860]  can get on the show. No big deal. Well, the new word on the street is yeah, you can come on my
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:12.620]  show, but you can't say Pfizer, Pfizer, Pfizer, Pfizer, Pfizer, Pfizer. And you know what? You
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:18.140]  can say it on Alex Jones. So who's running what? These are supposed patriot networks. You know what
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.220]  else you're not allowed to say? I don't trust Trump. I don't trust Trump. I don't trust Trump,
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:27.260]  or I don't trust DeSantis. I don't care. You can love Trump and Trump might still be the savior,
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:34.140]  but we as free speech advocates should be able to say what we want. Right. Are you still hearing
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.420]  me Alex? Yes, sir. That's why we got your commercial free. So I don't talk over you,
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.340]  but I don't want to say, I don't want to say I'm perfect. I don't want to say I have all the
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:45.500]  answers, but you made a great point. I want you to elaborate on this when you were on yesterday,
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.100]  because I've been caught up in this not as a disinformation person, but it's somebody
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.300]  been on the air 28 years. It used to happen to me a lot. It used to happen all the time.
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.460]  It very rarely happens now because I'm more wily to it, but mainstream media would bring out a fake
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:00.940]  conspiracy and dangle it. And I'd say, oh look, they're reporting on something. And then they turn
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.420]  around and say that I was the one that had put it out or somebody else was. So that point you
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:09.260]  made is so key. And a lot of these folks don't know, but a lot of them also get threatened.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.779]  They get a show, they've got some sponsors and the sponsors say, we're going to spend a lot of
[00:43:12.779 --> 00:43:17.260]  money with you, but here's the two or three things you can't talk about. And as soon as you do that,
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:21.260]  cause I've talked to folks has happened to then it's 10 or 15 things. That's 30 or 40 things you
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:27.580]  can't talk about. And that's what they do. Anybody that pre-interviews you and tells you what you
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:32.060]  can't talk about is being controlled. They may not be bad, but they've got a manager or producer
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:38.380]  or a sponsor who is being told what to do for the money. And it's great to make money on the truth,
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:42.220]  to find your operation expanded. But if you're doing it with control, then it's bad. And
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:47.340]  absolutely take, take project Veritas. James O'Keefe is incredible. And I knew two weeks ago
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:51.900]  when that story broke and it turned out that guy was the head of global MRNA. And he's saying we
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:57.740]  lie to people, it's hurting people. We made the virus we're releasing it. It's our cash cow. I
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:05.100]  told my crew, I said, the FBI has already rated project Veritas a couple of times. I guarantee
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:09.980]  you they're going to indict O'Keefe, kill him or put him in prison. In fact, I said that on air
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:15.660]  in a week and a half later, the board and the board elected another board kind of like they
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:20.460]  had three FDA boards that finally approved the poison shot. And then another board to approve
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:25.900]  it for kids and other companies abandoned. And then now James O'Keefe is on paid leave.
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:31.980]  They've exercised a clause of a non-disclosure, but I expect it'll go public soon because he
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.940]  finally, he didn't finally, he's always done it. He put his balls and everything else on the table.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:43.580]  He did his biggest coup ever. And I guarantee you that the FBI has come in there. Who's already
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:48.779]  rated them and said, we're going to indict your board. If you don't get rid of James O'Keefe.
[00:44:48.779 --> 00:44:53.420]  And now I predict because they've rolled over, they're still going to get indicted.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:57.660]  So James O'Keefe didn't turn off in the game of chicken. I've tried to call him again and call me
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:03.420]  back. And this is a big deal. So I get why those lesser shows, I don't mean lesser, like they're
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:08.220]  bad people or don't have big audience. I mean, lesser in that they, they think they're going to
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:12.060]  abide with the system. They're going to compromise. No, it never compromises you do.
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.980]  And then it ends up winning that, Hey, look at James O'Keefe, look at info wars, what we've
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.420]  been through. That's why we're backed by great audience. That's so stalwart. People have to know
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:24.140]  though, it takes a lot to not back down and look at what's happened to project Veritas. So
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:28.940]  mark my words, the FBI indictments are coming and we shouldn't turn against
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:32.300]  James O'Keefe. When it happens, we should champion him because he didn't back down.
[00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:40.270]  Absolutely, and I'm going to up the ante on this and I'm not supposed to say anything
[00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:44.690]  and I'm not going to say any names, but this is a fact and this is happening in the Patriot
[00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:51.050]  movement. This is what was going on with Shapiro. I never liked Shapiro. I never liked Shapiro.
[00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:55.770]  He's a smart little guy and he makes some good points, but I never trusted that guy.
[00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:59.630]  Never. I always knew Alex Jones was legit and I'm going to tell you this is a fact.
[00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:05.630]  I'm not making this up and I'm not going to say any names. One of my good, good friends
[00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:12.350]  interviewed Alex Jones and the network wouldn't let the interview go on air, even though Alex
[00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:17.350]  had bigged up these people and helped them promote their shows and took the time out
[00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:21.230]  of his life to do it right in the middle of him being basically the hottest thing on planet
[00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:26.310]  Earth. And one of the channels that you tune into and you think is helping you is going
[00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:29.910]  to save America through Alex under the bus and it will throw James O'Keefe under the
[00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:35.230]  bus and you can't save Pfizer. This is what we're dealing with. Alex Jones didn't say
[00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:39.230]  anything to me. I can say whatever I want. I don't have to be freaking Kanye West and
[00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:43.510]  wear a hood and start saying Nazi Jew all the time, but the reality is this is the place
[00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:46.830]  you're going to find the real truth. You're not going to find it anywhere else. When I
[00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:51.430]  went into the studio, I talked with Harrison Smith and I talked with Owen Troyer and they
[00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:55.710]  all said what you say on the air completely 100%. There was no weirdness underground like,
[00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:58.550]  hey, you got to keep to this, you got to do this. It's like, no, they're like, you
[00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:03.590]  know, Alex just lets us say whatever the fuck we want. I don't know if we can swear on here
[00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:09.470]  or not, but I just did. So you want to know what Infowars is and all the people trying
[00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:16.390]  to copy Infowars? Owen Troyer, I really wanted to edit this into a piece because it was so
[00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:24.390]  beautiful when Elon came out and he's like, oh, I really wish I didn't take the vaccine.
[00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:28.950]  And Owen's like, you know what? You're smarter, our audience is smarter than the richest man
[00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:33.950]  in the world. Our audience is smarter than a rocket scientist. Our audience is smarter
[00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:38.270]  than the creator of Tesla, the greatest car ever to be on the planet. But yeah, this guy
[00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:41.950]  couldn't get through his fricking head that he was being lied to when all the information
[00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:46.790]  was out there. And now he's pretending to be Alex Jones. Oh, I'm releasing good information.
[00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:51.270]  I'm letting you know the FBI spying on you. I'm telling you the old video games were talking
[00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:57.430]  about the New World Order. What a dick. Okay. This is bull. Everyone needs to realize just
[00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:02.230]  because everyone, including myself, has now become a version of Alex Jones, a frack of
[00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:07.030]  Alex Jones, doesn't mean that he's not the OG. And no one told me to say this. This is
[00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:11.610]  straight from my heart. I'm telling you, our friends and your people who are grassroots
[00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:18.350]  people I protested with on the fricking street are now co-opted by fricking Republican Inc.
[00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:23.390]  That's a fact. Well, it's disgusting, but you bring up Ben Shapiro. I saw a meme I meant
[00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:27.690]  to cover this week on Twitter and I printed it off, but it was like supported banning
[00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:33.510]  Alex Jones, supported censorship, supported the Pfizer shot, supported the wars, supported
[00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:37.950]  putting the January six protesters in prison. And there's a quote of Ben Shapiro and it's
[00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:42.870]  a video link where he says, nobody can outflank me. I'm the ultimate conservative. What a
[00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:49.230]  conservative of CIA Republican blue blood country club establishment crap. So I'm not
[00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:53.970]  up here saying I'm the end all be all. I believe America is America. And we should have guests
[00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:57.910]  on that I even disagree with sometimes or agree with just say whatever they want. What
[00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:03.550]  type of world is it where you only pre-program people and tell them what they're allowed
[00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:07.890]  to say. And so there is a huge awakening. The good news is people are awake and the
[00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:11.550]  system is trying to mitigate that by coming in and controlling people. But I don't think
[00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:12.150]  you're going to be able to.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:19.759]  Well, I'm telling you, it's happening. I mean, you know, I'm waiting for the phone call that
[00:49:19.759 --> 00:49:23.440]  I get and just figuring out what the number's going to be. I'm going to have to say no to
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.759]  it if I want to freaking keep my soul. This is crazy because some of these people, you're
[00:49:27.759 --> 00:49:31.160]  so happy for them. You're like, oh, you got a gig. That's great. And then you call them
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.759]  the next week and they're like, we can't talk about this. We can't talk about that. You're
[00:49:34.759 --> 00:49:35.000]  like, oh my God.
[00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:38.990]  And, and, and, and I know who you're talking about.
[00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:44.190]  Very, very popular from, just leave it at that because now I'm not saying anymore anymore.
[00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:47.350]  I swore I wouldn't say anything done.
[00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:52.230]  Well, I will, I will give them the benefit of the doubt because it's still a good
[00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:54.910]  group and even I'm going to give Elon some of the doubt.
[00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:56.870]  At least now he's like, God, I got sick.
[00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:58.030]  My cousin almost died.
[00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:59.190]  My family got sick.
[00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.990]  The shots bad.
[00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.630]  He's releasing most of the stuff.
[00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:03.070]  He's put most of the Patriots back on.
[00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:04.510]  I get, I'm a bridge too far.
[00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:05.190]  That's fine.
[00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:11.070]  But if anything on the, on the bad end, Elon's an opportunist who knows we're
[00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:13.270]  winning and is jumping ship on the bad end.
[00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:17.230]  He wants to control the movement with his internet X, but at least he
[00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:18.350]  is going in our direction.
[00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:20.150]  I mean, he's not Bill Gates.
[00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:23.070]  No, he's not.
[00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:25.270]  And like I say, I mean, in the grand scheme, sorry.
[00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:28.550]  I mean, this is I I'm, this happened to me today.
[00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:30.510]  I was trying to get on one of my buddy's shows.
[00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:32.190]  Like you can't talk about the video.
[00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.350]  You can't talk about Pfizer.
[00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:35.590]  I'm serious.
[00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:39.790]  Like if I wish I could tell you who it is, I just don't feel ethically.
[00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:40.270]  I can.
[00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:43.950]  You always say as a, as a reporter, when somebody tells you something in
[00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:48.310]  confidence, you have to maintain, I mean, I know who it is and people can
[00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:52.710]  figure it out from where you're based, but the other person, another person
[00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:54.910]  too, another it's now it's two.
[00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:55.790]  It was okay with one.
[00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:59.030]  Now it's two, another person who's been on your show, another person who may
[00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:00.230]  have just recently got a deal.
[00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.510]  Okay.
[00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:04.230]  And now they're who's team are they on?
[00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:08.510]  And so when it comes around to, when it comes around to things, they're so
[00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:12.870]  invincible, making $80 million, whatever it is the last two years is they just
[00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:16.950]  keep spreading money out and they just think they can buy us all, but buy us
[00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:20.550]  all while the kids all die and society collapses, what's the money worth
[00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:21.510]  if everything collapses?
[00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:22.590]  I mean, it's, I don't get it.
[00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:25.510]  This is a really good segue.
[00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:27.230]  And I know you're going to say, you don't want to do it, but
[00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:28.150]  just hear me out on this.
[00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.510]  Okay.
[00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:30.230]  I've been thinking about this for a long time.
[00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.910]  I can't do it.
[00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:33.990]  I just can't, it's not, it's not in my ability to do this.
[00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:37.110]  And you're going to say, oh, you know, we're not going to do it, but look.
[00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:39.110]  Bitcoin.
[00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.910]  Okay.
[00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:43.910]  Copy the Bitcoin backbone.
[00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:49.790]  Create a new cryptocurrency, call it Liberty coin, call it info coin.
[00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:53.710]  Give half of the coins to Liberty minded people.
[00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:58.510]  Keep the other half or less than half for the info wars war chest.
[00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:02.390]  Give, let's say Matt Baker does an incredible speech at a thing.
[00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:03.670]  He gets a Liberty coin.
[00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:06.590]  Everyone that's ever been on info wars gets a Liberty coin.
[00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:10.510]  We've, we spread it out and make the countering instead of Pfizer
[00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:11.830]  buying people off to be evil.
[00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:14.830]  We create something new and, and fun people were telling the truth.
[00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:17.910]  We have to have an alternate currency.
[00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:22.510]  These people have a machine to create an infinite amount of corruption.
[00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:24.470]  Back in the day, you could have a King.
[00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:27.270]  He would have a chest of gold he would give you, but he would still
[00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:30.110]  have to go back to his vault and be like, man, I've been given away
[00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:31.790]  a lot of gold chests this month.
[00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:33.430]  I really need to hold off on this.
[00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:36.230]  There's no limit to the depth of the fricking gold.
[00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.550]  These people have, they have created an infinite career corruption
[00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:41.430]  machine with a digital currency.
[00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:45.510]  It started, at least they used to have the decency to print the fricking
[00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.990]  paper.
[00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:49.830]  Now they literally can buy any person on the planet by putting zeros on a
[00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:54.150]  computer, any person they can buy you, they'll buy the company, they'll
[00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.430]  buy your agency, they'll buy everything.
[00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:59.870]  If we don't have an alternate currency and it can't be Bitcoin, because
[00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:00.870]  I don't trust it either.
[00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:02.430]  Let me say this.
[00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:06.390]  That's the saddest part because I've had crew members and 90% of our group,
[00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:12.670]  95% have been great, but I've had five or six times they literally pay an
[00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:17.430]  employee to make up completely false information and then they put them all
[00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:21.230]  over TV lying about us and it doesn't ever hurt us because the viewers are
[00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:22.350]  smart enough to see what's happening.
[00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:27.310]  But it's so sad that, I mean, we're talking 10, 20, $40,000.
[00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:31.870]  These people will make up stuff that is whole cloth, not true.
[00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:34.750]  And that's when you know how real the corruption is, is when you open the
[00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:38.590]  newspaper and a former employee is saying stuff that is dark side of the
[00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:39.110]  moon, man.
[00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:42.750]  Totally not of this world, no grain of truth.
[00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:44.270]  And you're just reading this crap.
[00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:46.750]  Yeah, I heard about it.
[00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:49.390]  You're eating goldfish, which was an episode of what was it, the
[00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:50.550]  office or something stupid.
[00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:55.430]  This is, unless we can create an alternate currency, a trustable
[00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:56.630]  currency, that's what I'm saying.
[00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:57.590]  We spread it out.
[00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:01.870]  You give some to all of the great people that have been involved in the
[00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:02.190]  movement.
[00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:06.310]  You give some to, you know, let's say Alex Stein.
[00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:09.830]  Let's say you give some to, I don't know, Alice in Wonderland or whoever
[00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:10.510]  these people might be.
[00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:11.870]  You give some to Matt Baker.
[00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:13.390]  You give some to Ian Smith.
[00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:15.430]  You give some to Chris Sky.
[00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:17.710]  You give some to all of your employees.
[00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:22.310]  And we create a Liberty-based currency that uses the exact same finite
[00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:27.550]  number of encryption that you're using for Bitcoin, making it absolutely
[00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:30.670]  clone anything that's within, I don't know if there's some law that you
[00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:33.870]  can't make it exactly the same, but have it be the same towards, so you
[00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:36.390]  can't make more, you can't make more Liberty coins.
[00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:38.270]  You can't make more info coin.
[00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:44.790]  This coin is 39% or 51% owned by Alex Jones or Info Wars Media or
[00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:45.790]  whoever the hell it's owned by.
[00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:48.710]  And we funnel the rest of the money out to everyone else.
[00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:52.670]  This is why people don't get what people say, why are we sending money
[00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:53.190]  to Ukraine?
[00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:54.470]  Why are we sending money here?
[00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:55.470]  It's payola.
[00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:56.950]  It's not just money laundering.
[00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:00.910]  They're making everyone buy into the corruption that you say you want
[00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:01.870]  the dollar to collapse.
[00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:02.790]  You don't trust the dollar.
[00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.390]  Here's 10 million of them.
[00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:05.710]  How do you feel about it now?
[00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:07.310]  Oh no, the dollar's legit.
[00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:08.190]  The dollar's solid.
[00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:08.790]  It's standard.
[00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:10.390]  Oh, I totally trust the dollar.
[00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:10.710]  Yeah.
[00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:13.950]  When you got a 5 billion of them, you can bet you trust it.
[00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:17.150]  So they they're funneling this money all around the world.
[00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:20.310]  All of this fake money, making everyone play the monopoly game.
[00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:23.550]  So we have to have some money and God, we trust because we're
[00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:24.590]  making that money God.
[00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:30.190]  So expanding on that, what happens when people figure out that the
[00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:33.910]  fiat money's being used to get them to destroy their future and the money's
[00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:36.230]  not going to be worth anything to buy anything if you keep going down the
[00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:39.470]  road, I think we're starting to get to that point.
[00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:43.590]  I don't know, man, because I have some good friends of mine who've just
[00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:46.190]  been, and you know what they didn't sell out.
[00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:47.310]  It was the same thing.
[00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:48.190]  It's grooming.
[00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:50.310]  They bring you and they say, say whatever you want.
[00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:53.110]  And I was like, you know what, let me just not say that one thing.
[00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:57.190]  And then, you know, actually there's a couple more things and then actually
[00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:00.510]  there's a better show and a better slot a little bit later, but we're running
[00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:04.070]  things a little bit more professional over there and most of our audience
[00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:06.870]  is kind of leaning this way and we just don't want to have them like click
[00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:11.110]  out, but it might even be just simply from just a click basis.
[00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:15.150]  Like I tried to do some, you know, some, I'm not anti-Trump.
[00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:16.230]  I voted for Trump twice.
[00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:17.430]  I got beaten up for Trump.
[00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:19.350]  I held signs around.
[00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:20.270]  I went to all the rallies.
[00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:21.110]  I did the whole thing.
[00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.510]  Okay.
[00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:24.350]  My popcorn is at the bottom of my thing.
[00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:30.390]  I have a few kernels and a little bit of corn oil in the bottom of my popcorn.
[00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:32.590]  I don't seek you coming to save you.
[00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:32.910]  Okay.
[00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:37.590]  Now, what I want to say about Trump is if Trump gets back in, now that we know
[00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:42.070]  that they have the total apparatus to seal elections, do they want him to get
[00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:43.750]  in and now can you trust that?
[00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:49.230]  And then ask yourself this, why is it, why is it that supposedly all the, maybe
[00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:51.950]  they're all, there's no hope with these politicians at all.
[00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:54.270]  I've always liked what DeSantis is doing.
[00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:57.910]  I think DeSantis is great, walks, walks, talks, talks, but people say, oh, look
[00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:59.470]  who's backing him, look who's backing him.
[00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:00.350]  But that's another thing.
[00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:03.230]  It's so easy for them to just say, oh, we funded this guy.
[00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:04.350]  So now you don't trust him.
[00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:06.270]  Oh, we do this.
[00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:06.790]  We do that.
[00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:10.590]  But meanwhile, I don't remember anyone saying to me, I can't say
[00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:12.430]  DeSantis is bad on their show.
[00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:13.470]  Okay.
[00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:18.470]  And these same shows will say, I can't say Trump or I can't say Elon's bad.
[00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:24.430]  So then who's running what, you know, so if, if they have the money, but we, they
[00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:28.190]  have the control over the, over the, over the, I was about to say, I noticed about
[00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:31.990]  six months ago over the vaccines, so-called vaccines, I finally got pissed
[00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:37.670]  and said, I'm not going to support, uh, Trump, if he doesn't come out against
[00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:43.390]  these shots and man, it was like a switch revenue wise, even though our revenue,
[00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:47.470]  supposedly people buying products in for store.com, it went down like 40% like
[00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:51.630]  overnight, so, and I guess that's just programmed people that hear me like
[00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:52.270]  pissed at Trump.
[00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:53.430]  I still like a lot of what he did.
[00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:56.790]  I still think he was better than, you know, Obama or, or, or, you know,
[00:57:56.790 --> 00:58:00.790]  Mitt Romney or whatever, but I mean, it's like, wow, there is definitely.
[00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:02.870]  So I think a lot of that is just situational.
[00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:07.470]  I think a lot of these networks like Newsmax or OEM or others, meanwhile,
[00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:11.950]  but they see, oh, it's okay to care to crowds Democrats, but when you say,
[00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:13.670]  Hey, Republicans do a better job here.
[00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:15.310]  Oh no, don't do that.
[00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:16.950]  Cause people see that as infighting.
[00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:19.910]  It's, it's, it's not infighting, but, but, but take Newsmax.
[00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:22.390]  They wouldn't let you challenge the stolen election.
[00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:23.950]  They wouldn't let you cover the poison shot.
[00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:25.750]  They fired a bunch of talk show host.
[00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:29.750]  They didn't get banned like OEM a year ago, but now they've been
[00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:31.110]  banned off cable and satellite.
[00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:35.990]  So see, telling the line is only an example to others.
[00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:37.950]  So they censor, but they're going to get you next.
[00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:39.270]  And these folks don't get that.
[00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:40.430]  It's like falling dominoes.
[00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:43.230]  We have to hold the line on free speech or lose everything.
[00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:50.009]  Yeah, whatever happened to the domino theory, you know, whatever happened to that concept.
[00:58:50.009 --> 00:58:55.330]  Meanwhile, we have elections stolen and communists taking over Brazil, and that's just fine.
[00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:56.330]  That's great.
[00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:57.330]  No big problem.
[00:58:57.330 --> 00:59:02.210]  That's what communists find about big banks do, whether it's two men can have a baby.
[00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:03.210]  Love it from Brazil.
[00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:04.210]  Two men can have a baby.
[00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:05.210]  All this.
[00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:09.210]  Once you give in to that level of craziness, they just beat you into submission.
[00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:14.170]  Now that we're arresting people in the UK and in Canada that say, I think there's only
[00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:15.170]  two sexes.
[00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:22.090]  I mean, even if that's wrong, which it isn't, we're, we're not like a little bit down the
[00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:27.090]  rat hole or the rabbit hole of tyranny here, Matt, we are, we are deep in it.
[00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:31.970]  Well, it's starting to look a lot more like a rat hole than a rabbit hole, isn't it?
[00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:35.490]  I think rabbit, rabbits are kind of cute, you know, rats.
[00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:38.090]  I don't know what's down in there, but I don't want to find out.
[00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:39.090]  Okay.
[00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:40.970]  Everybody needs to check their head.
[00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:41.970]  Okay.
[00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:45.970]  A lot of these people, you know, we'll all love you regardless of who's backing you.
[00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:51.410]  And you can have your own little podcast like Alex does now and like Owen does and like
[00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:52.410]  I do.
[00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:56.330]  And yeah, maybe you won't have all the flashing lights, but do you really need them or do
[00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:57.330]  you need your integrity?
[00:59:57.330 --> 00:59:58.330]  People.
[00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:02.650]  Well, that's why people ask me how I've never sold out.
[01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:06.370]  I believe in these ideas and things, and there's not even a debate about, I can't even do it.
[01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.970]  I can't even, I have to go from the heart when I believe.
[01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:14.730]  I can't even imagine being somebody else's puppet, but, but so many people just don't
[01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:15.810]  get what you said earlier.
[01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:18.770]  They get you to compromise a little bit.
[01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:22.090]  And then it's the only thing we compromise on is cussing and we can delay like one cuss
[01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:26.569]  word out, but we're on AM and FM stations and they don't care about cussing.
[01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:28.009]  Democrats can cuss on their stations.
[01:00:28.009 --> 01:00:31.650]  If we do Democrats file complaints and there's FCC fines.
[01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:35.890]  So the funny thing is I can say child molesters run the government, their Satan worshipers
[01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:40.569]  and the shots, you know, a bio weapon because these stations support us.
[01:00:40.569 --> 01:00:41.569]  But I get it.
[01:00:41.569 --> 01:00:48.009]  We then can't say the non Kings English S H dash T or F U dash, you know, K, which I
[01:00:48.009 --> 01:00:52.090]  get, but it's like, it's kind of a paradox where that's the one place we can't go because
[01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:54.009]  that's what the left uses.
[01:00:54.009 --> 01:00:56.210]  They're allowed to cuss on their channels.
[01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:59.650]  We can't do it here on conservative TV and radio, which I don't even really want to do.
[01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:04.370]  I have a big vocabulary like you do, but sometimes you got to say this is effing wrong.
[01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.569]  You know, sometimes there's a time to use it.
[01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:12.510]  It is, and so with that in mind, we, I was kind of hoping this might've been a little
[01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:16.430]  bit more of an open forum era for that one, but I mean, well here's the deal right now
[01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:20.930]  it's simulcast on info wars because that's on radio and TV stations.
[01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:24.590]  I mean, we can, we can want to show at midnight 20 customers and we don't catch it in five
[01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:25.590]  stations complain.
[01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:29.310]  I mean, we're on a lot of cable and TV stations that are small, but together they're big and
[01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:32.530]  we understand that, you know, they, they can't have that.
[01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:38.830]  But very soon this will be pure podcast, a lot of them will be free, some will be subscription.
[01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:43.130]  And then man, if you want to cuss like a sailor, you'll be able to say everything you want
[01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:44.130]  about a month or so.
[01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:47.330]  But right now we're simulcasting and over on info wars.
[01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:50.330]  So folks learn about alexjoneslive.com.
[01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:51.930]  Well, you know, it's, it's great.
[01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:56.270]  And in reality, it's, it's, I'm just being honest about what is censored here.
[01:01:56.270 --> 01:02:02.430]  You can say, I'm just saying it, but here, here's the right quote by a millis millis
[01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:10.270]  who wrote apocalypse now, since it's based on real communiques where you can drop napalm
[01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:13.470]  on women and children and be given a medal.
[01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:17.990]  But if you, but when they would write F you on the bombs on the side of the airplane,
[01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:20.890]  they would get written up and they did it again, court martial.
[01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:22.590]  And so that's what Colonel Kurtz is saying.
[01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:27.790]  He's just like, we're losing the war because we can't, we can drop napalm on women and
[01:02:27.790 --> 01:02:34.190]  children, but we can't write F U dash, you know, F F U dash K on the side of the airplanes.
[01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:39.190]  That's, that's the thing is, is like, we can abort babies coming out, they're born.
[01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:42.490]  We can euthanize grandma, but don't you say F U dash, you know?
[01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:45.190]  Yeah, man.
[01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:49.790]  And what they're doing nowadays with normalizing this whole baby thing, like I'm, I wonder
[01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:53.870]  like, you know, what would be really shocking would be if the Super Bowl went off without
[01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.830]  an Illuminati satanic ritual.
[01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:59.790]  But you know, at this point they've pushed the bar of that so far because you know, a
[01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:05.070]  lot of that is ritual and I think a lot of it is free advertising.
[01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:08.910]  It's like Madonna started this thing back in the day and now she's doing her same old
[01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:11.030]  thing and she's just a washed up old hag.
[01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:13.750]  And I'm looking at Madonna and people are like posting Madonna videos.
[01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:16.230]  I'm like, no one cares, stop posting your crap.
[01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:19.470]  I mean, I even put some of that, that thing on the end of my video.
[01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:21.150]  That was actually my buddy, the cameraman.
[01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:26.710]  He was like, yeah, well that's what the devil does is he always does some horrible provocative
[01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:32.590]  thing just to get your attention because he's circling the intergalactic toilet bowl, right?
[01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:37.270]  And so most times if there's a product or if there's something to do with these things
[01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:40.870]  like they'll have like the butt baby or something will come out or like, look at this person
[01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:42.790]  and their podcast and they did this.
[01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:47.910]  It's like, I would rather just, my theory on it is like locked, you know, in Sodom and
[01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:50.710]  Gomorrah at a certain point, I'm not a perfect person, give me a break.
[01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:53.150]  I appreciate a hot woman just like you.
[01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:58.030]  But when it comes to some of this really depraved stuff, especially on TV and spreading it around
[01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:04.190]  on the internet, when we look at it and we get offended and then we go around and we're
[01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:05.190]  like, look at this, look at this.
[01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:07.950]  And I see all my fellow conservators posting it.
[01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:12.070]  It's like, I wouldn't have even heard of it if it wasn't for everyone's outrage.
[01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:16.470]  It's almost like we're promoting it exactly and here's the deal, we're grown men, nobody's
[01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:17.470]  part of it.
[01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:21.410]  We're, we're honest that we're not Jesus Christ, but that's a men and women, that's adults.
[01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:23.350]  The point is leave kids alone.
[01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:27.510]  And I love how they're always like, Alex Jones is anti-gay, Alex Jones is no, I don't care
[01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:30.990]  if it's heterosexual or homosexual, leave kids alone.
[01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:34.990]  I'm you know, it's like, Oh, they're trying to pass laws banning drag queen events.
[01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:36.630]  Nobody cares about drag queen events.
[01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:39.710]  You want to go to one where some dude wears a dress, knock yourself out.
[01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:44.230]  No, we don't want little kids brought to them with men half naked with kids putting money
[01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:45.230]  in their G-string.
[01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:47.190]  That's what we don't want.
[01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:48.470]  That's what we don't want.
[01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:49.970]  And that they've got to make it.
[01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:52.910]  And then they've got to go, Oh, you don't like drag queens.
[01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:54.710]  Oh, they're trying to ban drag queens.
[01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:59.070]  Oh, they're trying to burn books now because they won't have like Satan killing babies
[01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:02.750]  and putting them in his butthole in the, in the five-year-old's fricking library.
[01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:05.850]  It's like, no dude, this is just inappropriate.
[01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:09.150]  It's not like we're not telling you what's going on in the world.
[01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:14.190]  There's a spiritual or genetic line to leave children innocent and protect them.
[01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:15.190]  We all have it.
[01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:18.910]  And we're saying, leave the kids alone, leave them alone.
[01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:22.790]  And they're using whatever little, whatever little cover that they've already cut everyone
[01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:23.790]  into.
[01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:26.430]  They're using all of their previous grooming.
[01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:31.030]  So funny because back in the day, you know, like you say, I was a little bit more left
[01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:32.030]  wing, whatever.
[01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:33.870]  I was just a freedom orientated person.
[01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:35.030]  I listened to Bob Marley.
[01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:38.670]  That's why I have my hair the way I do.
[01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:40.190]  I love it when you sing Bob Marley.
[01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:43.990]  I wanted to put together, I wish that the archivist could find all the times that you
[01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:46.230]  sing Bob Marley coming in from the break.
[01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:51.750]  Babylon system is the vampire, stuck in the blood of the sufferers.
[01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:53.750]  I want to, I want to do a Alex Jones.
[01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:55.350]  Well, you talk about the original Alex Jones.
[01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:56.350]  It wasn't Alex Jones.
[01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:57.350]  It was Bob Marley.
[01:05:57.350 --> 01:05:58.350]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:00.470]  Bob Marley was a gateway drug.
[01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:01.470]  Get up, stand up.
[01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:04.230]  Babylon system is the vampire.
[01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:06.830]  Babylon Empire.
[01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:08.870]  I mean, man, I grew up with that stuff.
[01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:09.870]  I love Bob.
[01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:10.870]  I love the fact.
[01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:12.350]  The survivors.
[01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:16.870]  And then what's the song where he's a slave to the slave ship, but the hand of the almighty
[01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:17.870]  strengthens him.
[01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:19.870]  I mean, that is like strong man.
[01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:22.870]  Oh, pirates, yes, they're rabbi.
[01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:25.870]  Don't lie to the merchant ships.
[01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:30.870]  Minutes after they took eye from the bottomless pit.
[01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:37.870]  But my head was made strong by the end of the almighty.
[01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:44.870]  We followed in this generation triumphantly.
[01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:46.870]  Won't you help to sing?
[01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:48.870]  That's all we've been talking about.
[01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:50.870]  That's what Alex Jones has been talking about.
[01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:51.870]  What we've been talking about.
[01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:55.870]  Just help us sing these songs of freedom.
[01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:58.870]  You know, I've talked to a lot of folks that knew Bob Marley.
[01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:02.870]  That's a true story that he stuck his foot in a concert in a shoe that was like a needle
[01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:05.870]  injected him with something and he pulled it out and knew what it was.
[01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:06.870]  Got a cancer.
[01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:08.870]  Yeah, and they tried to kill him, too.
[01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:10.870]  They tried to kill him and Peter Tosh.
[01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:12.870]  They went by and shut up his place.
[01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:16.870]  And, you know, he was an enemy of the system.
[01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:20.870]  And when he went around the world and white people took on to him and he could create
[01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:25.870]  that level of feeling of humanity and like, oh, this religious vibration that he would
[01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:26.870]  put up.
[01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:27.870]  Bob Marley is a prophet.
[01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:28.870]  I don't care what anyone says.
[01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:29.870]  Well, there's no doubt.
[01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:34.870]  And expanding on that, we have Strom Thurmond's letter a month before they killed John Lennon
[01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:38.870]  who become totally into a new world order saying, take him out.
[01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:39.870]  That letter is public.
[01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.870]  And they killed him.
[01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:44.870]  Yeah, they'll take out all the good ones.
[01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:45.870]  It's funny.
[01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:46.870]  They've changed their playbook.
[01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:47.870]  They don't like killing people anymore.
[01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:49.870]  They don't want to kill your name.
[01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:50.870]  Now they steal your identity.
[01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:54.870]  The worst part of being censored is they take you off air.
[01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:55.870]  You can't respond.
[01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:56.870]  And they make this false person.
[01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:58.870]  They create this thing you aren't.
[01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:00.870]  So it's more sophisticated because they're smart.
[01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:02.870]  They don't want to create martyrs.
[01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:05.870]  So now they just silence you and then create a fake you.
[01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:07.870]  I love that rant.
[01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:10.870]  I have now been trapped in the information warfare fulcrum.
[01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:13.870]  Only this information can save you.
[01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:19.870]  I've listened to almost every show of yours for, I don't know, God knows how many years.
[01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:21.870]  That's definitely what it is, brother.
[01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:25.870]  Well, listen, instead of me talking because we got about 20 minutes left, you are really
[01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:26.870]  making amazing points Thursday.
[01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:27.870]  You have the floor.
[01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:28.870]  Just go.
[01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:29.870]  You're hosting the show.
[01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:30.870]  Go.
[01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:31.870]  Well, I've been going.
[01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:32.870]  Okay, here.
[01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:34.870]  People of Earth, what are we going to do now?
[01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:41.870]  We've gotten to a point where we are being lulled into this hypnotic state.
[01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:42.870]  We're being groomed.
[01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:43.870]  We've been taken over.
[01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.870]  These New World Order people are pissing in our faces.
[01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:49.870]  They are turning us into their psychic bitches.
[01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:52.870]  They're saying, by the way, we're taking your children.
[01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:55.870]  By the way, we're taking your guns.
[01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:57.870]  By the way, we're taking your energy.
[01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:58.870]  By the way, we're mutating you.
[01:08:58.870 --> 01:09:00.870]  By the way, we're destroying all your food.
[01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.870]  By the way, all your chickens are dead.
[01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:04.870]  By the way, you're doing nothing about it.
[01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:09.870]  There's got to become a point in everybody's mind when they realize that they are a sovereign
[01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:12.870]  human being, and they can get off their couch.
[01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:14.870]  They can look in their newspaper.
[01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:16.870]  They can see if there's a drag queen story time there.
[01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:20.870]  They can see if someone might be mutating viruses in the local area.
[01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:25.870]  They can look and see if the people are coming across the border and chopping people's heads
[01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:27.870]  off, and they can go say something about it.
[01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:30.870]  A lot of people see what I'm doing.
[01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:33.870]  They go down there like, oh, you're really bombastic.
[01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:34.870]  You're really loud.
[01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:40.870]  And it's like, yeah, if we had 10 million people with one candle sitting around Pfizer
[01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:43.870]  or Moderna, let's not let them off the hook.
[01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:44.870]  It's all about Pfizer now.
[01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:47.870]  I almost wonder if Moderna is putting out this crap.
[01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:49.870]  They're all just as guilty.
[01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:55.870]  If we had one candle, and I wanted to do this back before January 6th, actually, one candle
[01:09:55.870 --> 01:10:00.870]  surrounding the building, millions, millions, millions of people, and you wouldn't even
[01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:06.870]  have to say a word, you have everyone show up and see the full power of humanity.
[01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:12.870]  You have everyone kneel down and pray to whoever they want to, and you have them take their
[01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:18.870]  candle and sit there and hold it, blow it out, stand up and walk away, and do it everywhere
[01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:20.870]  and put them on notice.
[01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:24.870]  This is how many people we can get to show up at any given time, any given place.
[01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:28.870]  And one of these days, we'll see how it goes.
[01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:29.870]  Okay?
[01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:30.870]  You guys know what you're doing.
[01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:32.870]  You know we know what you're doing.
[01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:36.870]  And at a certain point in time, the human race is going to have to get out of their
[01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:38.870]  freaking coma and do something about it.
[01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:41.870]  Why is it that there's only so few tiny people?
[01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:45.870]  And why is there so many million comments on anyone who does anything?
[01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:47.870]  Great job, great job, great job.
[01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:49.870]  Like what, am I a freaking rocket scientist?
[01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:50.870]  Does it take a genius?
[01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:53.870]  Have you never lost your mind and yelled at someone in a drive-through?
[01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:56.870]  Have you never yelled at your dad?
[01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:58.870]  Have you never yelled at your child?
[01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:01.870]  Just take that and say, oh, this is what the world's doing to me.
[01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:03.870]  Turn that energy towards them.
[01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:06.870]  If there was a million of us, if there was billions of us out there.
[01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:07.870]  Exactly.
[01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:10.870]  They want us all fighting with each other instead of directing the energy to the system
[01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:14.870]  saying, I'm a human being, leave me alone, back off.
[01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:15.870]  Yeah.
[01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:18.870]  I mean, if we just simply, if when the whole COVID lockdown thing happened, it didn't have
[01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:22.870]  to be hundreds of people out in the street going, no, we're not going to do it.
[01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:24.870]  If everyone's just like, give me a break.
[01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:25.870]  I'm not doing that.
[01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:26.870]  That would have been it.
[01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:27.870]  That would have been the end of it.
[01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:32.870]  But 99.9% of the people are brainwashed and 99.9% of the people went along with it.
[01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:34.870]  So we're out there in the streets going, wake up!
[01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:36.870]  What are you doing?
[01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:38.870]  And in the end, we ended up being right.
[01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:40.870]  And then do they give us a thank you?
[01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:41.870]  Do they give us no?
[01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:42.870]  No.
[01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:45.870]  So I'm just saying, anybody who's a fan, stop being a fan.
[01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:49.870]  Like I was talking about the other day that the analogy of the Super Bowl, there's certain
[01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:54.870]  people playing the game, but the fate of the entire stadium is within the game.
[01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:58.870]  But the thing is, the globalists only have a few people paying for the people that are
[01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:59.870]  on their side and their team.
[01:11:59.870 --> 01:12:01.870]  So let's bring them into the game.
[01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:02.870]  Okay?
[01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:04.870]  And now let's bring people on our side.
[01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:06.870]  And I'm talking to the people in the nosebleeds.
[01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:08.870]  I'm talking to the people way out.
[01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:09.870]  Yeah, but you told it better yesterday.
[01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:10.870]  So start over.
[01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:11.870]  Take your time.
[01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:15.870]  We think of 11 players there, the New World Order, 11 players ours.
[01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:17.870]  No, all the people in the stands are really who we are.
[01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:18.870]  Explain that again.
[01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:22.870]  Well, I'm not a big fan of repeating myself, but I'll give it a go because I can never
[01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:24.870]  say no to Alex Jones.
[01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:26.870]  Everyone likes an ouch, right?
[01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:31.870]  So when you're watching the Super Bowl, I want you to imagine 11 players on the field.
[01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:33.870]  That's team humanity.
[01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:34.870]  That's Alex Jones.
[01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:36.870]  That's Matt Baker.
[01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:40.870]  That's maybe Elon Musk might even be on our team at a certain point.
[01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:43.870]  And then you've got your Fauci's and you've got your Bill Gates.
[01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:46.870]  And they're all being run by the people in the skybox.
[01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:49.870]  The people in the skybox own their team.
[01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:52.870]  The other team is working for the entire planet Earth.
[01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:59.870]  Now the game is afoot and whoever wins that game is going to have every person in that
[01:12:59.870 --> 01:13:01.870]  stadium fate is on it.
[01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:06.870]  So if humanity loses, humanity gets in prison for all time.
[01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:09.870]  If the globalists lose, they get in prison for all time.
[01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:14.870]  So when we watch our players, you watch Alex Jones and they go up against each other, the
[01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:17.870]  problem is, is the game is rigged.
[01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:19.870]  And so the individual players get kneecapped.
[01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:21.870]  They get handicapped.
[01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:23.870]  Alex Jones has massive victories.
[01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:25.870]  Alex Jones crushes globalists on a daily basis.
[01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:29.870]  He is like a Goliath just mutilating them with the truth constantly.
[01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:35.870]  But then like the movie Gladiator, they go up and they stab Alex Jones.
[01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:39.870]  They stab all of the great patriots.
[01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:42.870]  They grab, they stab, sorry, James O'Keefe.
[01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:45.870]  They stab him in the ribs and then they go, go out and finish the game.
[01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:49.870]  And when he has no platform, when he's in a jail cell, when he can't speak, when he
[01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:54.870]  doesn't have a Twitter, when he can't have his actual battle be fought, at that point
[01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:59.870]  when you realize that the game is rigged and that we, the people, all of the people in
[01:13:59.870 --> 01:14:04.870]  the cheap seats are on the one side and only the five people in the skybox are on the other
[01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:06.870]  side, you say, this game's rigged.
[01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:07.870]  We're on the field.
[01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:13.870]  There's five, seven billion of us and we're going to take this entire stadium over.
[01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:17.870]  And when they send out their little minions and they send them to the floor, they're going
[01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:21.870]  to run away and they'll end up mushed on the ground just by the amount of people coming
[01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:22.870]  down.
[01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:25.870]  We outnumber these bastards so heavily.
[01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:29.870]  It's the will of our souls, it's the will in our hearts that's going to win this battle.
[01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:34.870]  We can't sit back and think someone else is going to play this game for us.
[01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:35.870]  This is not the Super Bowl.
[01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:36.870]  This is life.
[01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:38.870]  This is life and death.
[01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:41.870]  This is the entire fate of the entire human race.
[01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:43.870]  Do you understand?
[01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:48.870]  Now get up out your seats, go down to the field and join the battle!
[01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:56.150]  Well Matt Baker I am impressed and because you got cut off by a break yesterday so I'm glad I
[01:14:56.150 --> 01:14:59.990]  got you to say that again because I'm going to take that we're going to air that everywhere
[01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:05.190]  that was solid platinum right there totally true there's five or ten of them in the skybox
[01:15:05.190 --> 01:15:09.269]  there's 11 of them on the field they got their little side people we got a number of 10,000 to
[01:15:09.269 --> 01:15:16.309]  one and we just have to realize that we're not playing their game anymore. The game is rigged
[01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:21.190]  it's not a fair game and there's millions of billions and billions and billions of billions of
[01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:28.150]  us on team humanity and they have their little crew up in the skybox going excellent we are
[01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:35.990]  winning kill humans and when we go over there we're like hey bro out of your skybox meet my
[01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:42.550]  friends meet the rest of planet earth you might want to go home pack up your bags before something
[01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:48.070]  happens. Well that's everything I've been trying to do for 28 years is I learned about the globalist
[01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:53.269]  plans from like the 50s 60s 70s and I saw they were actually doing what they said they would do
[01:15:53.269 --> 01:15:58.390]  I thought well the next plans set up a total nightmare digital society depopulation brainwashing
[01:15:58.390 --> 01:16:02.950]  poisoning transhumanist thing I believe in humanity I believe if they are given a choice
[01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:06.790]  and shown this they will stand up and I said they're not gonna listen to me up front
[01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:10.470]  but if I get ahead of it and tell them what they've already done and what's coming next then
[01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:14.390]  I'll get credibility once it happens and it's been a long game but it's actually happened but
[01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:18.070]  it's just like gladiator where I got tears in my eyes we told that story he's already won all the
[01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:22.070]  gladiatorial games 10 different fights done all this and that's based on a composite of a true
[01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:26.550]  story and real emperor fought a gladiator did all that it's like three stories in one kind of like
[01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:30.950]  the page root mel gibson is a true story but it's three stories combined three stories combined in
[01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:38.470]  the in the gladiator but it's true story and he literally is chained up and the emperor comes in
[01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:43.430]  and stabs him with a little dagger in the heart and then goes out and says I'm gonna beat you but
[01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:48.470]  he fired up and still killed him and then died afterwards that's a true story and people resonate
[01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:52.630]  with that because that's exactly what they do they hamstring us they do it but as long as we don't
[01:16:52.630 --> 01:17:00.150]  give up in the end we're gonna win and why why I mean I've always wanted to do this I've always
[01:17:00.150 --> 01:17:04.550]  wanted you to do this when you're when you're asking people for donations or whatever I'm
[01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:11.990]  talking to you John I'm talking to you Juan I'm talking to you David Tyrell I'm talking to you
[01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:21.110]  Sarah I'm talking to you Diane why is it that you continually watch and from the seats and don't
[01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:28.230]  join the field I'm I'm literally a nobody I just I'm a regular guy I'm a glassblower I'm an artist
[01:17:28.230 --> 01:17:34.150]  I'm a musician I have a handyman business I'm doing this from my garage right now there's nothing
[01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:40.150]  about me that you don't have that you can't do if you watch and you watch those movies and you
[01:17:40.150 --> 01:17:44.230]  feel that in your heart and you know you've got truth when you're not a satan worshiper sitting
[01:17:44.230 --> 01:17:50.630]  there watching satan worshipping rituals going yes yes when you watch gladiator win when you watch
[01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:55.030]  rocky win when you watch all these things happen and you go that's the good people winning like
[01:17:55.030 --> 01:18:00.230]  they used to have movies that's the great people when those are the heroes and you realize in this
[01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:06.710]  day and age you can be that person without even spilling a drop of blood people go man you're a
[01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:15.830]  hero you're so brave I never bled a freaking drop of blood for this not one people have died people
[01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:22.230]  used to have to mow down entire fields of people to get to get hero status now if you just simply
[01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:29.750]  stand up and say the emperor has no clothes the whole world's like oh my god how does he do it
[01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:37.750]  simple open your freaking mouth stay no well let me ask you that question
[01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:43.670]  let's go back to gladiator while we talk I want to watch that footage great job pulling that up
[01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:51.430]  limited career my argument is the globalists are going to destroy the average person so they
[01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:54.950]  pretend they're part of the power structure and go along with it when it's going to destroy them
[01:18:54.950 --> 01:19:02.309]  anyways when all they've got to do is say no so tell me how you awoken and because you've reached
[01:19:02.309 --> 01:19:06.390]  you know you've had dozens of clips that reach millions of people each club people love you
[01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:09.750]  you're a leader you're saying oh I'm sure wherever you're out there are all those great leaders
[01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:12.710]  and I've always said that I'm here to try to get those leaders to take action
[01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:16.550]  what spurred you to finally go to city councils and finally speak out
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:26.300]  i mean it wasn't i wouldn't say it was like oh i listened to alex jones and that's why i did it
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:31.260]  i honestly i think it's in your heart i think a lot of people have it in their heart i think a lot
[01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:37.420]  of people want to say no i think a lot of people have strong will and i think people just need it's
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:42.460]  like a muscle you just start exercising it during the covid lockdowns and that whole thing that whole
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:48.460]  mind control situation i mean yeah i was listening to info wars and yeah it helped me like i saw it
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:53.099]  i'm like this is a psyop this is fake but then as the all the information comes in and especially
[01:19:53.099 --> 01:19:58.460]  you and your guests you get more and more convinced you're like no wait this really is wrong they
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:03.420]  really haven't tested this vaccine there really is no proof found she really did say wear the mask
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:08.220]  don't wear the mask wear 10 masks wear three masks the virus works the vaccine works the
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:12.460]  vaccine doesn't work every day they're changing their tune on tv and then you know that they're
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:17.340]  using mRNA technology which you know has never been tested or has been tested and all the all
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:22.700]  the rats died the little gerbils whatever the fuck they were sorry and then you start realizing
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:27.179]  if i don't say something no one else it's almost like we're in a video game you what you like video
[01:20:27.179 --> 01:20:33.260]  games let's play a game let's pretend you're a hero let's pretend you get up off your couch right
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:38.139]  now and you do something heroic and we'll do it peacefully we're just going to go and find somebody
[01:20:38.139 --> 01:20:43.900]  to call out and say it loud and proud videotape that stuff you put it up send it to me on on
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:51.340]  my twitter one more time slave underscore two underscore liberty it's a fitting title slave
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:56.860]  to liberty because that i've now literally become a slave to liberty i can't stop myself i'm addicted
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:03.260]  to this the passion of saying no and at a certain point you weigh in so deep into the into the water
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:07.740]  you can't get out you have to go yes let me guess because you're a great smart guy
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:11.740]  you probably had an empowered life before but how much more empowered is your life now or is it not
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:18.700]  more empowered oh it's light years more i mean i i always felt my mind was freer than the average
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:23.420]  person i always knew that i was slightly smarter slightly above but i never really thought that
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:29.900]  there was like literally one in 10 million people that would be willing to actually stand up and say
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:35.099]  something against things that blew my mind i couldn't believe when the coveted lockdowns
[01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:43.019]  happened that people were so americans americans i grew up partially in europe you may or may not
[01:21:43.019 --> 01:21:47.019]  know this i actually grew up when i was a kid i was in england and ireland i grew up over there
[01:21:47.019 --> 01:21:52.300]  for a small period of time the parents are irish i was born in san francisco however when i was
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:57.580]  there you know i kind of took on the culture and we watched tv and america was this america's that
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:02.620]  so when i came back over to america i was so happy to be here my hometown homeland back with
[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:08.540]  the big boys and not hanging out with the little pussy english people and i'm like america america
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:13.740]  and then you see the lockdowns happen and you see these people become total pussies and just
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:18.700]  completely give into the system going that's not gonna happen here in america the whole thing went
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:24.700]  out the window i'm like what the hell is going on how can there be this many mind-controlled zombies
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:29.980]  all around me i felt like when you go in a kitchen and you turn on a light you see the
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:35.179]  roaches scatter i almost felt like it was a message to to alex at one point he's like you
[01:22:35.179 --> 01:22:40.139]  know what we're coming for you we're gonna do this we're gonna do that where humanity rises
[01:22:40.139 --> 01:22:44.620]  and they're like one second alex let me just turn this light on for you and they turned on the
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:50.940]  retard light flick and you stand up there and you realize everyone around you is a mind-controlled
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:57.900]  brainwashed zombie and you're like oh holy crap you know things are a lot more hectic than they
[01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:03.340]  seem at that point i realized that it was like i totally agree with you i totally agree with you
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:08.860]  that was all an exercise in showing us how many people they control but it's starting to backfire
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:12.540]  as bad as it was it's backfired what do you think their next attack is going to be
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:19.900]  let me let me talk about something positive for a second um i will say i have noticed recently back
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:24.860]  in the day there was a lot of alex jones memes and video clips going around and then there was a
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:30.780]  long period of time where that was very low on the totem pole and not a big thing i surf instagram
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:35.980]  and all these things habitually it's it's sad actually i i wish this battle that's the one
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:41.260]  thing i don't like about the battle is to be informed you kind of have to become an addict of
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:46.700]  of like the machine exactly you want to tune out of it because that's the ultimate defense but
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:51.740]  because they're in the matrix you got to jack into it exactly you always use that yeah to fight to
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:57.420]  fight the uh mr smiths you actually have to get into the matrix unfortunately and unfortunately
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:02.059]  they'll pull your plug like i was saying the other day on tv if you don't get in there and fight it
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:10.059]  so i have noticed a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot of clips of alex all even vintage old classic
[01:24:10.059 --> 01:24:17.580]  clips new clips meme clips statement clips daily clips i've been seeing it's it's definitely i
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:22.300]  don't know whether you're noticing it or not but i've definitely noticed an uptick in in in all of
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:28.780]  my uh media that i'm following which is a lot and a lot of hours spent and i see if it was clips left
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:33.500]  and right all over the place alex jones was right all over the place and again i'm not that important
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:39.500]  but i'm an archetype now symbol of the populist they want to take that tarot card down but i'm
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:42.860]  just trying to keep the operation going and just cover the news i don't have a lot of time to watch
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:50.860]  it watch it but i know this i i i got nothing but love for the first 20 years on air and but it was
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:55.180]  like walk down the street you talk to you see a hundred people you talk to five fans so it's still
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:25:00.460]  kind of a niche underground thing then trump explodes we get big and now i go in the grocery
[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:04.139]  store and every other person i'm shaking their hand but every 10th person says f you you're
[01:25:04.139 --> 01:25:09.820]  russian agent now i shake a hundred two hundred hands before i get one f you in fact it hasn't
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:13.500]  happened in months knock on wood because this year with your parents eating dinner somewhere
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:17.660]  and people walk over and trim you and throw tea on you it's not fun but i still go out i make
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:23.019]  myself go everywhere and all we're getting is love right now and i see that as the average person
[01:25:23.019 --> 01:25:27.260]  which is good to be anonymous and good to be private i'm like oh i'm famous you're not
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:33.980]  but because i am well known i'm like a gauge like a like a engine heat gauge or something
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:40.139]  or tire pressure gauge and so i can tell people in the hearts and minds of people even the most
[01:25:40.139 --> 01:25:44.700]  leftist areas we're getting nothing but love right now and then even leftists that hate me
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:51.180]  just sit back and like kind of hiss at me and so i use what i'm experiencing as a gauge a weather
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:56.219]  vein and it really shows me a lot of a lot of a lot of awakening very explosive awakening but that
[01:25:56.219 --> 01:26:01.580]  i don't start celebrating man because i know the enemy knows that they're gonna launch something
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:05.340]  else and then i don't just say this i told people you know eight years ago we had government
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:10.540]  documents then cia just department they're censoring the counter disinformation propaganda
[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:17.580]  act it's hellish but now um without getting into the whole story just it is james bond level and
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:21.740]  it freaks them out when they follow me home or mess with my family or make death threats that i
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:26.219]  just kind of shrug it off well i've just like jumped into the lava at this point and i'm just
[01:26:26.219 --> 01:26:30.139]  like okay if i've been into all the stuff they've done i'm not a victim i'm not feeling sorry for
[01:26:30.139 --> 01:26:36.059]  myself it's been horrible but it's because i'm effective so i realized well i've had so much
[01:26:36.059 --> 01:26:42.300]  success that's the price to pay so now i'm not a sadomasochist i don't like pain but i've learned
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:47.580]  that that's a symbol of the victory you know both my grandfathers were the army air corps
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:53.019]  one flew fighter planes only did a few missions uh crash landed uh coming back into england almost
[01:26:53.019 --> 01:26:58.380]  died flipped the plane you know was this like some super ace or anything but my dad's dad
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:04.620]  uh volunteered for even more missions it was catch 22 to 22 north africa into italy whole nine yards
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:08.540]  uh the germans attacked her base in north africa we didn't know until he died we had all the letters
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:14.219]  and commendations and medals and he died like 52 of cancer my dad's dad jerry jones not the
[01:27:14.219 --> 01:27:21.180]  doll's cowboy's owner but the point was he they strapped their base shot him up blew him up uh he
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:26.940]  had concussions the next day their plane flies out he's not the captain anymore it blows up over
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:33.260]  italy and he had guilt till the day he died so he had like 18 missions in he re-ups for a whole
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:38.620]  another 22 missions and then re-ups for a whole and they finally pulled him and said no we're
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:43.580]  going to make you a manager once they invaded italy to run like uh the the the feeding the
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:49.900]  troops thing as an officer but the point was is that researching what those b17 pilots he flew
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:57.099]  a liberator at first it'll be 17 was you went they didn't have radar back then it just been developed
[01:27:57.099 --> 01:28:01.580]  it wasn't in europe you went to where the flack was you went to where the attack was so they would
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:05.980]  see all these cannons exploding and all the shrapnel and they would steer into those hundreds
[01:28:06.059 --> 01:28:11.660]  of planes into the shrapnel into the attack to then drop their bombs and so the u.s troops could
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:18.700]  take out the tank fields and take out the the uh factories and everything and the the russians
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:23.420]  didn't have that so they lost 20 million troops the u.s lost you know less than a million because
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:28.460]  they sent the army air corps in but the reason i tell that story is that's what we're doing we're
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:35.019]  going in over the flack into the attack and that's what we're doing and that's why i love the attack
[01:28:35.019 --> 01:28:39.420]  i love it i'm ready to go to prison i'm ready to die because this commitment against these people
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:42.780]  and all these onboard children and all the little kids are trying to give the shots too
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:48.380]  and all the evil they're doing if we can stand up for them and be men right now we're gonna save our
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:57.980]  lives i can feel that bro and i'm getting some tears in my eyes we're going in through and beyond
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:09.500]  as you always say it's kind of cool they're playing that audio we got a new we got a new
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:14.460]  studio but the point is but my point is is that that's what this is all about we want to go into
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:20.860]  the conflict into the battle start over go ahead well you know in through and beyond it's just a
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:27.099]  it's a reference to you and your show but really but um you know who's really is uh struggling
[01:29:27.099 --> 01:29:34.860]  is the people the j6 people you know those people are not oh joe biggs years in solitary confinement
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:43.180]  23 hours a day in a jail cell i heard his latest call he got out he's in virginia it's it's 23
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:48.700]  degrees and he's out there with it with a little plastic blanket and he said i've gotten used to
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:55.740]  my teeth chattering the last six months please help me our our our beloved joe biggs used to be
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:30:00.300]  on the show whether it was it could have it's gonna be matt baker next to alex jones you know
[01:30:01.099 --> 01:30:08.780]  when is everybody gonna actually join and stop listening stop listening stop sitting down
[01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:16.780]  join become part of this we will win this whole thing is it we have the globalists like this
[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:22.780]  in the in the in the over the top movie and we're battling we're battling we're battling
[01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:27.740]  what if we had just only a few more people to push if only just a few more people would push
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:33.019]  we could push this over the top we would crush them we would defeat them with pure numbers
[01:30:33.019 --> 01:30:37.980]  and strength and will and people say oh evil's always here let's come back yeah but we'll
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:42.780]  prosecute and put in prison a bunch of people and we'll have a long era of prosperity where evil
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:49.340]  fears good again it has to there has to be a point the only time when you say oh i'm not ready to
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:58.300]  start you know celebrating as you always say yeah um yeah until until fauci is in jail until bill
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:03.980]  gates is behind bars like that new song came out which i really love him until we have gates behind
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:15.500]  bars until we see some modicum of justice on this planet we cannot give up we have to keep going
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:22.860]  we can't let this be status quo yes we live in a gulag yes we're told what to do yes they're
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:29.019]  stealing our children yes they're mutating us yes they've destroyed all the plant crops i mean
[01:31:29.019 --> 01:31:33.820]  forget about humans let's say you even do hate humans you think we are a blight on the earth
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:37.740]  and you know there's times i can see it you know you're out in the park and you have and i think
[01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:41.340]  that should the air is going clean you see the birds and then some guy gets in your way and
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:45.820]  you're like hey why is this guy here he's messing up my zen i was in a zen park the other day it was
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:50.219]  this little japanese garden it was so beautiful and then some gumby walks through and you're like
[01:31:50.219 --> 01:31:53.500]  man these gummies get them out of here that's that's how the globalists look at every single
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:58.380]  person on planet earth this is their garden but it isn't their garden they're destroying the
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:03.340]  genetic code of the food crops they're destroying the atmosphere yeah they claim they're protecting
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:08.780]  the earth they're destroying it the planet earth in this beautiful world that we live in that god
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:13.580]  created whether you believe in jesus or you believe in buddha or whatever you did not make
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:19.580]  this world this world is way too complicated way too beautiful way too perfectly balanced
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:26.300]  like the perfect swiss watch with 70 quintillion parts all functioning perfectly well together and
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:30.700]  they're destroying the magnetosphere they're destroying the plants they're destroying the
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:35.340]  water they're destroying everything i mean this is one thing we definitely have to start getting
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:40.059]  through our heads and michael savage says it all the time conservatives need to be a little bit
[01:32:40.059 --> 01:32:45.500]  more conservation minded just because they go so far out with it on the left like we want to shut
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.300]  down everything we're you're not gonna have cars you're not gonna have this you're not gonna have
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:53.660]  that so we go i want to you take i want to kill everything i love catalytic converters exactly
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:54.540]  that was all reasonable
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:33:02.120]  right so we want we want us we are the conservers we want to conserve the
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:08.360]  genetic code of the plants of the corn it is basically which how come if it was
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:11.920]  anyone else would say this is an affront to the South American tradition the
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:16.240]  South Americans are praying to corn corn was given to them by their God Kexel
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:20.600]  Quattle or whatever the frickin story is the corn God and you're going in you're
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:25.720]  genetically mutating the lifeblood the staff that took us out of the mud they
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:32.080]  gave us food the crops the grains the rices all of the main staples on planet
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:36.480]  Earth being destroyed by people like Monsanto going well we're just gonna
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:40.320]  destroy all of the genetic code so it can't grow unless it's swimming in
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:48.160]  friggin our genetic poison our roundup our glyphosate which is actually turning
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:55.280]  the frogs gay if you want to go look it up you know everyone's like yeah they're
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:58.920]  going gay because they have glyphosate because it's messing with their
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:02.920]  endocrine systems there's just a brand new concept I've been wanting to talk
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:09.760]  about this for a while let's talk about hormone therapy hey hormone therapy
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:13.480]  everything's a double-edged sword right I mean is it evil to have hormone
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:17.960]  therapy is it bad is it good let's put it this way when somebody goes into the
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:23.960]  doctor and they say you know your blood sugar is too hot they give them insulin
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:29.440]  to bring it down hey when they say you know your blood pressure is too high
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:33.880]  you're gonna have a heart attack let's give them something to bring it yeah
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:39.720]  whether you have a son and he's acting a little fruity they're like oh this guy
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:43.760]  maybe we should give him some more estrogen has it ever crossed anyone's
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.120]  mind that maybe there should be an actual hormone therapy because of all of
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:52.920]  the endocrine disruptors that are destroying the gonads of the male just
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:57.000]  say if you have a fruity son maybe he does need hormone therapy maybe give him
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.840]  just a little taste of testosterone and see how he feels when he looks at a
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:04.520]  woman give him a little taste and see if he wants to be a little pussy sitting
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:09.400]  around taking crap and give him what he was designed to do exactly I went out I
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:13.240]  went out to a bar one night and I ran into this this lesbian chick that I was
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:16.240]  arguing with and we were going back and forth and it's actually kind of fun
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.760]  arguing with her because she was really logical and she wasn't getting too
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:22.560]  whacked out there was a certain point in the conversation that I was like wait a
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:27.280]  minute I am sensing testosterone from you out of nowhere I just said I sense
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.320]  you have testosterone I didn't even hear about this this this is years ago she
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:38.000]  goes oh my god I just got a testosterone shot this week so she was now getting
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.720]  all she could have no they prescribe it to even young women but they don't want
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:46.480]  men to have it she was tough she was getting muscles she was growing hair she
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.280]  was ready to get in the fight she wasn't gonna take no crap from no man so why
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:54.280]  can't you get these little boys who have been damaged by all this crap in the
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.440]  frickin environment and put it back the other way exactly I used to be against
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:02.680]  hormone replacement to our other studies that a 30 year old has a
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:06.960]  testosterone of an 80 year old now they have hit us with these things and it's
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:12.000]  totally unnatural and when a woman gets old they go oh you're telling your your
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.920]  hormones are low but God forbid you give anybody and a little extra testosterone
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.240]  to make him a little bit more manly to make him a little bit stronger to be a
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:22.480]  unless it's a woman lesbian that wants to come and attack you and fight you
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:26.840]  because she's like oh I'm a man now and she'll out fight half of the men in the
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:29.260]  room because they're all freaking cock and they've got they've got no
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:33.840]  testosterone like this is I'm not joking this is a serious thing I'm talking
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:38.720]  about like please does anybody consider Russell said we'll use hormones and
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:45.040]  injections and diet to control people and they've done it if your son is I
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:49.880]  don't know if the testosterone boost works and I'm and I'm not a doctor I'm
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:53.400]  just saying what if let's say you know you had a son who's acting a little
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:56.680]  fruity and maybe you just accidentally put some you know testosterone boost
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:59.920]  in his fruity pebbles or something like you're really gonna let your kid become
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:05.880]  a little wimp when a wimpy woman doesn't feel happy being wimpy and so she takes
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.240]  the testosterone and becomes a tough guy? Yeah they call it toxic masculinity but
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.080]  we're designed to be leaders and do that. Yeah why wouldn't you want your son
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:19.880]  to feel strong? Why would you say oh he's looking a little weak let's
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:24.320]  make him even weaker let's cut his dick off let's give him some tits and let's
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.480]  see how he feels now and then when he wakes up later and because he's
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:33.040]  depressed he was depressed before you wake up and you after the whole hoopla
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:36.920]  you get a little internet clout you get to go and join all the clubs you get to
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:42.360]  join the rainbow world and you're like hey I'm enjoying my life. Yeah that's a social credit score that you betrayed
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:47.880]  your son. You have no dick and you're still can you imagine being a depressed
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:51.200]  person go maybe if I cut my dick off I'll feel better and then you wake up 20
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.880]  years later and you look down and go I'm still depressed and I have no dick.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.560]  Well let's talk about 20 years ago if somebody went into a medical clinic and
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:03.240]  said I want to cut my finger off much less my cock they'd put you in a mental
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:07.000]  institution but now oh it's normal
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:35.100]  Exactly you said it before and I think really the mental health aspect of this it's a giant level of the homelessness is mental health which turns a lot of times to drug addicts. I've had my ins and outs with things in the past especially drinking back in the day I was a big vodka drinker. Drinking coffee right now nice and clear headed. I'm going to stay out of my Infowars cup.
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:49.100]  But yeah so I just want to like let's switch it up let's have a little fun. I've let out all my anger and I'm done with that. Can we talk about some more positive and fun things?
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.100]  Ten minutes you've got the floor.
[01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:55.100]  I'd like to have a back and forth though.
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:58.100]  Don't worry I'll interrupt then.
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:16.100]  Okay I want to know and I probably should have asked you before but remember Alex Jones doesn't tell people what to say so I don't know if he got it fell out with him or what but this movie is a great movie. This movie was awesome. I watched this movie oh man I had tears in my eyes. If you're an Alex Jones fan I love that.
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:32.100]  And I bought the book too and the book's great. I got one actually I got two. I got one for Alice in Wonderland which I gave her on air and then I got another one signed. Two signed ones and then I got an unsigned one that I can pen and take notes and actually look up all the crazy information in there.
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:44.100]  So did you ever get that clip of that event that I sent you? I sent it to Rob. Did you get it? The American Liberty Awards? I swore I would bring this up.
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:54.100]  I saw you on Alice in Wonderland on OAN I appreciate it and I'm sure they gave it to me there's so much stuff to look at. What was the clip? What happened at the Freedom Awards or I didn't see it?
[01:39:54.100 --> 01:40:01.100]  Oh no I sent Rob Du a promo of an event that Frank Cavanaugh and Rob Du.
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:04.100]  Okay so I'm told it's a which clip is it guys?
[01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:11.889]  All right, let's play clip 10 right now here's American Liberty Awards promo and it's on
[01:40:11.889 --> 01:40:12.889]  my left here.
[01:40:12.889 --> 01:40:13.889]  Here it is.
[01:40:13.889 --> 01:40:14.889]  We'll play right now.
[01:40:14.889 --> 01:40:15.889]  From the Boston Tea Party to Paul Revere's infamous night ride from Washington crossing
[01:40:15.889 --> 01:40:40.410]  the Delaware to Martin Luther King's epic I Have a Dream speech throughout the ages
[01:40:40.410 --> 01:40:45.570]  Americans have stood up against the onslaught of tyranny.
[01:40:45.849 --> 01:40:49.849]  Sometimes these men do not get celebrated in their own times.
[01:40:49.849 --> 01:40:52.849]  Other times they do.
[01:40:52.849 --> 01:40:58.849]  These days those that shine the brightest light of liberty are the most shunned and
[01:40:58.849 --> 01:41:03.849]  scorned by the corporate system that strangles those very freedoms.
[01:41:03.849 --> 01:41:11.849]  Our goal is to take those warriors whether they be using their words, their song, their
[01:41:12.130 --> 01:41:19.130]  art, their mind, or their passion to light the fires of liberty in the hearts of men.
[01:41:19.130 --> 01:41:25.130]  In these recent years, tyranny has rained down upon this land like we have never seen
[01:41:25.130 --> 01:41:26.130]  before.
[01:41:26.130 --> 01:41:34.130]  And it has been that very rain that has been the fertile ground for those less timid souls.
[01:41:34.130 --> 01:41:37.130]  Those who refuse to bow.
[01:41:37.410 --> 01:41:42.410]  Those who refuse to compromise with the dictates of corporations and governments.
[01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:45.410]  Those who refuse to be cancelled.
[01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:47.410]  Those who will stand proudly.
[01:41:47.410 --> 01:41:53.410]  And those who will hold the torch of liberty so it may burn brightly into the future for
[01:41:53.410 --> 01:41:58.410]  our children and our children's children in the years to come.
[01:41:58.410 --> 01:42:02.410]  Join us as we celebrate those heroes amongst us.
[01:42:02.690 --> 01:42:10.690]  Join us for the first American Liberty Awards where we will celebrate our freedoms and enjoy
[01:42:10.690 --> 01:42:14.690]  the company of those who refuse to bow.
[01:42:15.690 --> 01:42:22.690]  And for that we say, we shall never surrender and we shall never give up those rights
[01:42:22.690 --> 01:42:25.690]  granted to us by God.
[01:42:32.410 --> 01:42:40.190]  Wow, did they put something like that on there?
[01:43:02.690 --> 01:43:05.690]  National television has 50 million viewers but they won't do that.
[01:43:05.690 --> 01:43:07.690]  So what was that Matt Baker we just saw?
[01:43:08.690 --> 01:43:15.690]  That was the proto-promo for the American Liberty Awards which is an idea that Frank
[01:43:15.690 --> 01:43:20.690]  Kavanaugh and I had when we were out in Austin last time when I saw you and I gave you that
[01:43:20.690 --> 01:43:21.690]  hug.
[01:43:21.690 --> 01:43:28.690]  We were out at Barton Springs and we said, you know, we need to have our own, not a Fox
[01:43:28.690 --> 01:43:29.690]  News Liberty Awards.
[01:43:29.969 --> 01:43:35.969]  I mean real people, real street people, people that have been out there on the streets, real
[01:43:35.969 --> 01:43:39.969]  freedom fighters that have made a difference.
[01:43:39.969 --> 01:43:44.969]  Alex Steins of this world, the greatest patriot comedian.
[01:43:44.969 --> 01:43:50.969]  The lifelong achievement award might go to someone you know.
[01:43:50.969 --> 01:43:55.969]  Man on the street might go to another co-host of yours.
[01:43:56.250 --> 01:44:01.250]  And we just want to big up these people and have it be to where other people can again
[01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:04.250]  realize this is something to aspire to.
[01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:05.250]  These are the modern heroes.
[01:44:05.250 --> 01:44:09.250]  We don't have a war that become home and get medals.
[01:44:09.250 --> 01:44:12.250]  We don't, all the people that go out, basically the way you win an award now is you get on
[01:44:12.250 --> 01:44:16.250]  the Alex Jones show and Alex Jones actually says, hey I like what you're doing man.
[01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:18.250]  That's about as good as it gets.
[01:44:18.250 --> 01:44:20.250]  So we want to have, but this is going to be fun.
[01:44:20.250 --> 01:44:21.250]  This is going to be music.
[01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:26.530]  We're going to have Jimmy Levy, hopefully, I'm in discussion with him, and you know,
[01:44:26.530 --> 01:44:27.530]  Bryson Gray.
[01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:29.530]  We're going to have music.
[01:44:29.530 --> 01:44:32.530]  Maybe we'll have JP Sears show up, do some comedy routines.
[01:44:32.530 --> 01:44:35.530]  Maybe some inspirational words will be spoken.
[01:44:35.530 --> 01:44:37.530]  But we want to have a good time.
[01:44:37.530 --> 01:44:41.530]  This isn't going to be like his Totally Square event.
[01:44:41.530 --> 01:44:44.530]  This isn't Liberty, it's like Liberty Stock.
[01:44:44.530 --> 01:44:49.530]  You know, this isn't going to be this epic meeting of the tribes of all the freedom fighters
[01:44:49.809 --> 01:44:54.809]  around the country, regardless of if you're a Q person or if you're a Fox News listener
[01:44:54.809 --> 01:44:56.809]  or if you're an Alex Jones person.
[01:44:56.809 --> 01:45:00.809]  If you love Liberty, then you love the American Liberty Awards.
[01:45:00.809 --> 01:45:05.809]  And so come and join us and we are going to have an epic time and it's going to be in
[01:45:05.809 --> 01:45:06.809]  Austin.
[01:45:06.809 --> 01:45:07.809]  It's going to be in August.
[01:45:07.809 --> 01:45:10.809]  I forget the exact date right now because we just locked it in.
[01:45:10.809 --> 01:45:12.809]  Rob Dew actually made the final call on that.
[01:45:12.809 --> 01:45:16.809]  If you want to find more about it, we're building the website right now.
[01:45:16.809 --> 01:45:17.809]  It's much like this.
[01:45:18.090 --> 01:45:21.090]  It's very prototype right now.
[01:45:21.090 --> 01:45:22.090]  We're starting it out.
[01:45:22.090 --> 01:45:23.090]  This is the very beginning launch.
[01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:27.090]  I was actually wearing the shirt the other day when I was on the air, if anybody noticed
[01:45:27.090 --> 01:45:31.090]  the American Liberty Award shirt, which you can actually get my t-shirt so you can find
[01:45:31.090 --> 01:45:32.090]  on my Twitter.
[01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:35.090]  I have a link to my t-shirt so we can find the Brazil t-shirt, you can find the traditional
[01:45:35.090 --> 01:45:39.090]  Slave to Liberty shirt, you can find the week sequel shirt.
[01:45:39.090 --> 01:45:40.090]  But that's how this works.
[01:45:40.090 --> 01:45:44.090]  Big things start small and we do have to really celebrate liberty.
[01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:45.090]  We do.
[01:45:45.090 --> 01:45:47.090]  And I want everyone to know.
[01:45:47.370 --> 01:45:51.370]  This is of the people, for the people, by the people.
[01:45:51.370 --> 01:45:53.370]  This is another call to action.
[01:45:53.370 --> 01:45:55.370]  Let's say you don't want to get out there in the face.
[01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:58.370]  Let's say you don't want to risk getting arrested.
[01:45:58.370 --> 01:46:01.370]  Let's say you live in a liberal town and you just can't take the flag.
[01:46:01.370 --> 01:46:05.370]  Let's say you're in a wheelchair and you just can't get out there.
[01:46:05.370 --> 01:46:06.370]  I don't care.
[01:46:06.370 --> 01:46:10.370]  If you have ever wanted to get your foot in the door, this is your option.
[01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:12.370]  This is your chance.
[01:46:12.370 --> 01:46:14.370]  We need extra people to help.
[01:46:14.370 --> 01:46:15.370]  We need extra production people.
[01:46:15.650 --> 01:46:17.650]  We need people to help us with videos, promos.
[01:46:17.650 --> 01:46:21.650]  We need anyone who wants to make music and songs to pump this up.
[01:46:21.650 --> 01:46:24.650]  Hell, if you make a good enough song, you'll play on the main stage.
[01:46:24.650 --> 01:46:26.650]  You might even get an award.
[01:46:26.650 --> 01:46:28.650]  Like let's go, people.
[01:46:28.650 --> 01:46:29.650]  Make some art.
[01:46:29.650 --> 01:46:30.650]  Make some comedy.
[01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:31.650]  Make some stickers.
[01:46:31.650 --> 01:46:32.650]  Make some t-shirts.
[01:46:32.650 --> 01:46:33.650]  Bring it all together.
[01:46:33.650 --> 01:46:37.650]  We'll have a vending area where you can just set up like a Grateful Dead show and you can
[01:46:37.650 --> 01:46:39.650]  sell your own stuff there.
[01:46:39.650 --> 01:46:41.650]  You can come out and you can have a good time.
[01:46:41.650 --> 01:46:43.650]  You can come out and meet fellow patriots.
[01:46:43.929 --> 01:46:46.929]  You can come out and not be judged by a bunch of liberal weirdos.
[01:46:46.929 --> 01:46:49.929]  You can actually yuck it up with your good patriot friends.
[01:46:49.929 --> 01:46:50.929]  You might meet me.
[01:46:50.929 --> 01:46:51.929]  You might meet Alex.
[01:46:51.929 --> 01:46:52.929]  You might meet Frank Cavanaugh.
[01:46:52.929 --> 01:46:54.929]  Speaking of which, another promo.
[01:46:54.929 --> 01:46:55.929]  Sorry, Shameless.
[01:46:55.929 --> 01:46:57.929]  I swore I would bring this up.
[01:46:57.929 --> 01:47:03.929]  My buddy, your buddy, Scott Armstrong, he's got a channel on Banned.Video.
[01:47:03.929 --> 01:47:08.929]  Another person that Alex Jones opened the door for to let in, to give a like to.
[01:47:09.210 --> 01:47:14.210]  So Scott Armstrong, he is now working with the unjected people who have a website, or
[01:47:14.210 --> 01:47:19.210]  it's a dating website, if you want to remain uninjected and possibly have kids in the future
[01:47:19.210 --> 01:47:22.210]  that don't grow three heads and aren't mutants.
[01:47:22.210 --> 01:47:27.210]  And also, if you date an unjected woman, you also might know that she's not a complete
[01:47:27.210 --> 01:47:31.210]  retard and she's not a leftist lunatic who's going to want to have cut your kid's dick
[01:47:31.210 --> 01:47:33.210]  off once you finally do have one.
[01:47:33.210 --> 01:47:37.210]  So you join the show, which is going to be a lot of fun, actually.
[01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:40.490]  Frank Cavanaugh, it's a date at Rockstar.
[01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:44.490]  Me and Frank and Scott actually were having so much fun when we were out there.
[01:47:44.490 --> 01:47:49.490]  We went out to meet you guys in Austin and we kind of became this little clique.
[01:47:49.490 --> 01:47:53.490]  And so it's the unjected, it's on Rockfin.
[01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:56.490]  It's rockfin.com forward slash unjected.
[01:47:56.490 --> 01:47:57.490]  It's tonight.
[01:47:57.490 --> 01:47:59.490]  It's at 9 p.m. Eastern.
[01:47:59.490 --> 01:48:00.490]  Oh, man.
[01:48:00.490 --> 01:48:02.490]  And we might be overlapping here pretty soon.
[01:48:02.490 --> 01:48:03.490]  And it's going to be fun.
[01:48:03.490 --> 01:48:06.490]  So they've got the unjected girls there and it's a call-in show.
[01:48:06.769 --> 01:48:08.769]  You could be like, oh, I'm looking for a guy.
[01:48:08.769 --> 01:48:13.769]  What's beautiful is we're creating a pro-human culture that's anti-globalist.
[01:48:13.769 --> 01:48:18.769]  Well, in closing, my friend, it's been an epic interview over an hour long.
[01:48:18.769 --> 01:48:22.769]  I really appreciate you joining us and being here with us.
[01:48:22.769 --> 01:48:26.769]  But the bottom line is we can roll over and be slaves.
[01:48:26.769 --> 01:48:28.769]  We can stand up and be victorious.
[01:48:28.769 --> 01:48:30.769]  And we're designed to fight back against tyranny.
[01:48:30.769 --> 01:48:32.769]  It's not work, folks.
[01:48:32.769 --> 01:48:34.769]  It is empowering.
[01:48:35.049 --> 01:48:40.049]  And I'm very thankful to all the Infowars viewers and listeners who are supporting AlexJonesLive.com.
[01:48:40.049 --> 01:48:41.049]  It's free.
[01:48:41.049 --> 01:48:42.049]  It's there.
[01:48:42.049 --> 01:48:46.049]  And I just ask folks to share the links because this is the fertile time for awakening.
[01:48:46.049 --> 01:48:48.049]  This is the time that tribesmen and women's souls.
[01:48:48.049 --> 01:48:55.049]  In closing, Matt Baker, a five-minute rant about your take on what's happening in Russia,
[01:48:55.049 --> 01:49:00.049]  what's happening in Ukraine, what's happening with Biden, big picture.
[01:49:00.330 --> 01:49:05.330]  A veteran is in the hospital saying, here's Charlie Brown cartoons hallucinating.
[01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:07.330]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:49:07.330 --> 01:49:09.330]  Well, you read my mind with that one.
[01:49:09.330 --> 01:49:14.330]  I think it's just my rant button is kind of outweighed right now.
[01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:15.330]  I can only rant so much.
[01:49:15.330 --> 01:49:18.330]  I want people to know that I'm a normal person.
[01:49:18.330 --> 01:49:19.330]  You know, I laugh.
[01:49:19.330 --> 01:49:20.330]  I joke.
[01:49:20.330 --> 01:49:21.330]  I have fun.
[01:49:21.330 --> 01:49:23.330]  I'm not just always yelling and screaming.
[01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:27.330]  This is just a normal human being who has a large breath of feeling.
[01:49:27.330 --> 01:49:28.330]  I feel the world.
[01:49:28.330 --> 01:49:29.330]  I feel the universe.
[01:49:29.610 --> 01:49:30.610]  I feel all the emotions.
[01:49:30.610 --> 01:49:31.610]  I feel the love.
[01:49:31.610 --> 01:49:32.610]  I feel the passion.
[01:49:32.610 --> 01:49:33.610]  I feel the pain.
[01:49:33.610 --> 01:49:36.610]  And I feel that need to do something.
[01:49:36.610 --> 01:49:40.610]  And when it comes to the whole Russian thing, honestly, I have a different take on it.
[01:49:40.610 --> 01:49:46.610]  I sometimes wonder if we're not being fooled, again, that the whole war is never going to
[01:49:46.610 --> 01:49:47.610]  actually spiral out of control.
[01:49:47.610 --> 01:49:52.610]  It's a limited war that the higher, higher, higher up people on the chessboard have decided
[01:49:52.610 --> 01:49:56.610]  they're going to allow Popov to sell some weapons, to kill whoever they need to, to
[01:49:56.889 --> 01:50:01.889]  get rid of some of their stronger men, to blow up pipelines and shut down things, to
[01:50:01.889 --> 01:50:05.889]  have an excuse to have sidewalk attacks, to have an excuse to have balloons popping over
[01:50:05.889 --> 01:50:09.889]  to put everybody in freaking traumatized mind control in their planet.
[01:50:09.889 --> 01:50:10.889]  Everyone's like, oh, my God.
[01:50:10.889 --> 01:50:11.889]  Listen to this.
[01:50:11.889 --> 01:50:13.889]  Back to the Super Bowl, okay?
[01:50:13.889 --> 01:50:15.889]  I've never seen this before.
[01:50:15.889 --> 01:50:20.889]  Normally the Jets fly over the Super Bowl as a patriotic display of America.
[01:50:20.889 --> 01:50:21.889]  Woo!
[01:50:21.889 --> 01:50:23.889]  You know, like they did at the Trump rally, okay?
[01:50:24.170 --> 01:50:28.170]  No, this year, on the news, they're like, and with all the things that have been going
[01:50:28.170 --> 01:50:35.170]  on in the sky, we will have F-15s in the air, like, protecting you from balloons that might
[01:50:35.170 --> 01:50:38.170]  be coming over, that there could be balloons anywhere in the sky.
[01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:43.170]  And thank God the F-16s are there, because they're going to be patrolling the stadium,
[01:50:43.170 --> 01:50:47.170]  because God forbid you actually just had a football game, you now need a military to
[01:50:47.170 --> 01:50:51.170]  protect you from the things in the sky, which feeds directly into my concept that it is
[01:50:51.450 --> 01:50:54.450]  totally part of their mind control that they're putting you under.
[01:50:54.450 --> 01:51:00.450]  Now, I want to just break everybody's mind here, because everyone says Alex Jones and
[01:51:00.450 --> 01:51:01.450]  I look alike.
[01:51:01.450 --> 01:51:08.450]  Now, I don't want to, like, it's crazy, but Bill Hicks is actually my brother-in-law.
[01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:11.450]  Now, if you can believe that or not.
[01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:16.450]  I actually used to look just like Alex Jones, like just like Alex Jones.
[01:51:16.730 --> 01:51:24.730]  But then I started taking the beard and hair formula, and dude, overnight, it is amazing.
[01:51:24.730 --> 01:51:30.730]  I mean, I just grew these massive hair, because before, I couldn't even really join the movement,
[01:51:30.730 --> 01:51:32.730]  because everyone was just telling me I was Bill Hicks.
[01:51:32.730 --> 01:51:35.730]  But now, I'm like, that's his whole own thing.
[01:51:35.730 --> 01:51:39.730]  I'm like, yeah, I'm a bigger dreadlock power, you know?
[01:51:39.730 --> 01:51:40.730]  And it's like, without the beard-
[01:51:40.730 --> 01:51:45.730]  You know, I'll see that on Twitter, where we have some, like, viral video.
[01:51:46.009 --> 01:51:48.009]  And like, they go, oh, it's Bill Hicks.
[01:51:48.009 --> 01:51:50.009]  I don't even look like Bill Hicks.
[01:51:50.009 --> 01:51:52.009]  It's like, you know.
[01:51:52.009 --> 01:51:55.009]  It's not on the land, and not on high enough.
[01:51:55.009 --> 01:51:59.009]  You know, I can get super mad about this, but in the end, man, we got to love life.
[01:51:59.009 --> 01:52:00.009]  We got to have fun.
[01:52:00.009 --> 01:52:01.009]  We got to be bros.
[01:52:01.009 --> 01:52:04.009]  And I'm so happy to be here with you, Alex.
[01:52:04.009 --> 01:52:07.009]  There's times when you were talking that I forgot I was on the show with you.
[01:52:07.009 --> 01:52:08.009]  I'm so used to listening to you.
[01:52:08.009 --> 01:52:10.009]  I'm like, wait, he's talking to me.
[01:52:10.009 --> 01:52:11.009]  It's kind of weird.
[01:52:11.009 --> 01:52:13.009]  I'm like, oh, yeah, I got to respond to this stuff.
[01:52:13.290 --> 01:52:17.290]  Also, you know, don't forget, we got Showtime here on Band.Video.
[01:52:17.290 --> 01:52:20.290]  I have a channel, Slave2Liberty, there, without the underscores.
[01:52:20.290 --> 01:52:22.290]  I might switch that up, just to make it all the same.
[01:52:22.290 --> 01:52:24.290]  But as for now, Slave2Liberty on there.
[01:52:24.290 --> 01:52:26.290]  And then you've got Scott Armstrong.
[01:52:26.290 --> 01:52:33.290]  Also, he plays that show on the, the Unjected show on his, it's Rebunked.
[01:52:33.290 --> 01:52:37.290]  Rebunked, which is very similar to Conspiracy Fact,
[01:52:37.290 --> 01:52:40.290]  because all of the things that were debunked are now rebunked.
[01:52:40.570 --> 01:52:43.570]  And you see, I actually have this idea, too, before I forget about it.
[01:52:43.570 --> 01:52:45.570]  I think it would be great at the end of some of the shows,
[01:52:45.570 --> 01:52:48.570]  maybe Owen's show, like right before the end of the show,
[01:52:48.570 --> 01:52:53.570]  because I know a lot of times we scan Drug Report or Gateway Pundit
[01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:55.570]  or whatever, and we do read the headlines.
[01:52:55.570 --> 01:52:59.570]  I think sometimes it's actually fun to scan Band.Video
[01:52:59.570 --> 01:53:02.570]  and just go through, like, oh, look at the Gregory support.
[01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:04.570]  Oh, look at this pipeline thing.
[01:53:04.570 --> 01:53:06.570]  Oh, look, somebody's talking about...
[01:53:06.570 --> 01:53:08.570]  I got to say, millions of viewers are on Band.Video every day,
[01:53:08.849 --> 01:53:10.849]  but it's not getting any attention.
[01:53:10.849 --> 01:53:13.849]  It needs so many hundreds of great censored contributors.
[01:53:13.849 --> 01:53:15.849]  We're just so blessed to have that site.
[01:53:15.849 --> 01:53:17.849]  It's so great to have it there.
[01:53:17.849 --> 01:53:19.849]  I hope the listeners promote that.
[01:53:19.849 --> 01:53:21.849]  All right, Matt Baker, you've knocked it out of the park.
[01:53:21.849 --> 01:53:23.849]  You've done an incredible job.
[01:53:23.849 --> 01:53:25.849]  I want to thank you for joining us this evening,
[01:53:25.849 --> 01:53:27.849]  and I promised the listeners to do more live, commercial-free shows,
[01:53:27.849 --> 01:53:29.849]  and we've just done it here this evening.
[01:53:29.849 --> 01:53:31.849]  So, Matt Baker, you got another show to go on in about 10 minutes,
[01:53:31.849 --> 01:53:33.849]  so we'll let you get out of here.
[01:53:33.849 --> 01:53:35.849]  Thank you, sir.
[01:53:36.129 --> 01:53:38.129]  See you on Facebook.
[01:53:38.129 --> 01:53:40.129]  That's my site.
[01:53:40.129 --> 01:53:42.129]  Later, brother.
[01:53:42.129 --> 01:53:44.129]  All right, there goes Matt Baker.
[01:53:44.129 --> 01:53:46.129]  Great guy, wanted to do it, and that's what this podcast is about.
[01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:48.129]  It might be on Monday night.
[01:53:48.129 --> 01:53:50.129]  It might be on Wednesday night.
[01:53:50.129 --> 01:53:52.129]  It might be on Friday night.
[01:53:52.129 --> 01:53:54.129]  It might be Sunday night.
[01:53:54.129 --> 01:53:56.129]  It might be 7 a.m. on a Saturday.
[01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:58.129]  It's here in my house, and I've got it set up
[01:53:58.129 --> 01:54:00.129]  where we're going to launch it, like, in a week or so.
[01:54:00.129 --> 01:54:02.129]  I keep saying a week, I get behind,
[01:54:02.129 --> 01:54:04.129]  but I'll be able to, on my phone, wherever that's at,
[01:54:04.410 --> 01:54:06.410]  I'll be able to, like, move along the street
[01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:08.410]  and go live there, and you're like, well, what's that do?
[01:54:08.410 --> 01:54:10.410]  I can do it on Twitter right now.
[01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:12.410]  Yeah, I can't, but Alex Jones in this little zone
[01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:14.410]  will be able to, like, shoot a video
[01:54:14.410 --> 01:54:16.410]  of what I see, whether it's a Bilderberg,
[01:54:16.410 --> 01:54:18.410]  or whether it's Davos, or whether it's
[01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:20.410]  a major event, or an RNC,
[01:54:20.410 --> 01:54:22.410]  or a DNC, or whatever it is.
[01:54:22.410 --> 01:54:24.410]  I'll be able to live
[01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:26.410]  and also archive that to you.
[01:54:26.410 --> 01:54:28.410]  So, we're extremely excited about it,
[01:54:28.410 --> 01:54:30.410]  and the whole thing's done.
[01:54:30.410 --> 01:54:32.410]  I've just got to get around to deciding this and that
[01:54:32.690 --> 01:54:34.690]  and shoot more of the content.
[01:54:34.690 --> 01:54:36.690]  So, alexjoneslive.com, it is not in competition.
[01:54:36.690 --> 01:54:38.690]  I've told the crew this, like, 50 times.
[01:54:38.690 --> 01:54:40.690]  They're still like, here,
[01:54:40.690 --> 01:54:42.690]  are you going to leave Infowars?
[01:54:42.690 --> 01:54:44.690]  I mean, you're leaving, right?
[01:54:44.690 --> 01:54:46.690]  No, no, no, Infowars is bigger than ever.
[01:54:46.690 --> 01:54:48.690]  I have to do something separate outside of that
[01:54:48.690 --> 01:54:50.690]  to promote Infowars.
[01:54:50.690 --> 01:54:52.690]  We're not going anywhere
[01:54:52.690 --> 01:54:54.690]  as long as supporters
[01:54:54.690 --> 01:54:56.690]  spread the word about Infowars.com
[01:54:56.690 --> 01:54:58.690]  and buy the great products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:54:58.690 --> 01:55:00.690]  So, just like Bandai Video
[01:55:00.969 --> 01:55:02.969]  has billions of views
[01:55:02.969 --> 01:55:04.969]  and hundreds of contributors
[01:55:04.969 --> 01:55:06.969]  and it's about three years old,
[01:55:06.969 --> 01:55:08.969]  I promise you, alexjoneslive.com
[01:55:08.969 --> 01:55:10.969]  is going to be amazing
[01:55:10.969 --> 01:55:12.969]  and we're very blessed to be here.
[01:55:12.969 --> 01:55:14.969]  But we can only do it because you support buying products
[01:55:14.969 --> 01:55:16.969]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:55:16.969 --> 01:55:18.969]  Even though this is a separate operation,
[01:55:18.969 --> 01:55:20.969]  we're going to have a subscription-based system
[01:55:20.969 --> 01:55:22.969]  at alexjoneslive.com
[01:55:22.969 --> 01:55:24.969]  for some of the videos for folks that want
[01:55:24.969 --> 01:55:26.969]  to get the exclusive content
[01:55:26.969 --> 01:55:28.969]  and then support everybody else getting it.
[01:55:29.250 --> 01:55:31.250]  You're like, well, what am I doing paying
[01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:33.250]  if most of it's free?
[01:55:33.250 --> 01:55:35.250]  Because you're trying to fund it and keep us on air
[01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:37.250]  and wake people up to beat the New World Order.
[01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:39.250]  That's the whole symbiotic relationship
[01:55:39.250 --> 01:55:41.250]  with this whole damn thing.
[01:55:41.250 --> 01:55:43.250]  So, great job to the crew tonight.
[01:55:43.250 --> 01:55:45.250]  I'm not going to do a Saturday show tomorrow
[01:55:45.250 --> 01:55:47.250]  because it's my birthday
[01:55:47.250 --> 01:55:49.250]  and I'm going to dinner at my parents
[01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:51.250]  and I'm going to hang out with my wife and children.
[01:55:51.250 --> 01:55:53.250]  My grown-up children are going to come see me
[01:55:53.250 --> 01:55:55.250]  and we're going to have lunch tomorrow
[01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:57.250]  and it's not too cold.
[01:55:57.530 --> 01:55:59.530]  There's some stuff, but I'll be back Sunday
[01:55:59.530 --> 01:56:01.530]  4 to 6 p.m. and there's Sunday Live
[01:56:01.530 --> 01:56:03.530]  6 to 8 p.m. with Owen Troyer
[01:56:03.530 --> 01:56:05.530]  and then the weekday shows are obviously there.
[01:56:05.530 --> 01:56:07.530]  But let's go ahead and play
[01:56:07.530 --> 01:56:09.530]  this clip
[01:56:09.530 --> 01:56:11.530]  that I've taken myself and edited in
[01:56:11.530 --> 01:56:13.530]  with Deus Ex.
[01:56:14.530 --> 01:56:16.530]  Alex Jones explains the interdimensional battle
[01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:18.530]  for our souls
[01:56:18.530 --> 01:56:20.530]  and then we'll air a little promo
[01:56:20.530 --> 01:56:22.530]  and end this transmission.
[01:56:22.530 --> 01:56:24.530]  But thank you for keeping us on air.
[01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:26.530]  If you want to get a free subscription
[01:56:26.809 --> 01:56:28.809]  go to alexjoneslive.com
[01:56:28.809 --> 01:56:30.809]  and sign up right there with your email for free
[01:56:30.809 --> 01:56:32.809]  and you'll get a free monthly membership.
[01:56:32.809 --> 01:56:34.809]  All the founding coin members
[01:56:34.809 --> 01:56:36.809]  are going to get a one-year free membership
[01:56:36.809 --> 01:56:38.809]  once we go subscription.
[01:56:38.809 --> 01:56:40.809]  But again, there'll still be free stuff
[01:56:40.809 --> 01:56:42.809]  still everything here and news reports
[01:56:42.809 --> 01:56:44.809]  kind of like Rebel Media, but this subscription system
[01:56:44.809 --> 01:56:46.809]  will then fund reporters and keep
[01:56:46.809 --> 01:56:48.809]  Groove for things we can't do
[01:56:48.809 --> 01:56:50.809]  with info wars and free speech systems.
[01:56:50.809 --> 01:56:52.809]  So, here is this Deus Ex
[01:56:52.809 --> 01:56:54.809]  Deus Ex because
[01:56:55.090 --> 01:56:57.090]  this is something that Elon Musk
[01:56:57.090 --> 01:56:59.090]  is talking about how this video game
[01:56:59.090 --> 01:57:01.090]  20 years ago predicted it all.
[01:57:01.090 --> 01:57:03.090]  Well, they told me the video game makers
[01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:05.090]  that I inspired it not bragging it's true
[01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:07.090]  and they wanted me to be in the new one
[01:57:07.090 --> 01:57:09.090]  but they never made it.
[01:57:09.090 --> 01:57:11.090]  So, now that the video game is getting attention
[01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:13.090]  here it is.
[01:57:25.590 --> 01:57:27.590]  Consciousnesses don't want to dominate other people
[01:57:27.590 --> 01:57:29.590]  they want to empower them so they don't tend to get together
[01:57:29.590 --> 01:57:31.590]  until things are really late in the game
[01:57:31.590 --> 01:57:33.590]  then they come together evil is always defeated
[01:57:33.590 --> 01:57:35.590]  because good is so much stronger.
[01:57:35.590 --> 01:57:37.590]  And we're on this planet
[01:57:37.590 --> 01:57:39.590]  and Einstein's physics showed it, Max Plankton's physics showed it
[01:57:39.590 --> 01:57:41.590]  all there's at least 12 dimensions
[01:57:41.590 --> 01:57:43.590]  and now that's why all the top scientists and billionaires
[01:57:43.590 --> 01:57:45.590]  are coming out saying it's a false hologram
[01:57:45.590 --> 01:57:47.590]  it is artificial
[01:57:47.590 --> 01:57:49.590]  the computers are scanning it and finding
[01:57:49.590 --> 01:57:51.590]  tension points where it's artificially
[01:57:51.590 --> 01:57:53.590]  projected and gravity's
[01:57:54.370 --> 01:57:56.370]  leading in to this universe
[01:57:56.370 --> 01:57:58.370]  that's what they call dark matter
[01:57:58.370 --> 01:58:00.370]  so we're like a thought or a dream
[01:58:00.370 --> 01:58:02.370]  that's a wisp
[01:58:02.370 --> 01:58:04.370]  in some computer program, some God's mind
[01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:06.370]  whatever, they're proving it all, it's all coming out
[01:58:06.370 --> 01:58:08.370]  now
[01:58:08.370 --> 01:58:10.370]  there's like this sub-transmission zone
[01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:12.370]  below the third dimension
[01:58:12.370 --> 01:58:14.370]  that's just turned over to the most horrible things
[01:58:14.370 --> 01:58:16.370]  that's what it resonates to
[01:58:16.370 --> 01:58:18.370]  and it's trying to get up into the third dimension
[01:58:18.370 --> 01:58:20.370]  that's just a basic level consciousness
[01:58:20.370 --> 01:58:22.370]  to launch into the next levels
[01:58:23.150 --> 01:58:25.150]  our species is already way up in the 5th, 6th dimension
[01:58:25.150 --> 01:58:27.150]  consciously, our best people
[01:58:27.150 --> 01:58:29.150]  but there's this big war trying to
[01:58:29.150 --> 01:58:31.150]  basically destroy humanity
[01:58:31.150 --> 01:58:33.150]  because humanity has free will
[01:58:33.150 --> 01:58:35.150]  and there's a decision to which level we want to go to
[01:58:35.150 --> 01:58:37.150]  we have free will, so evil's allowed
[01:58:37.150 --> 01:58:39.150]  to come and contend, not just good
[01:58:39.150 --> 01:58:41.150]  and the elites themselves
[01:58:41.150 --> 01:58:43.150]  believe they're racing
[01:58:43.150 --> 01:58:45.150]  using human technology
[01:58:45.150 --> 01:58:47.150]  to try to take our best minds
[01:58:47.150 --> 01:58:49.150]  and build some type of
[01:58:49.150 --> 01:58:51.150]  breakaway civilization
[01:58:51.929 --> 01:58:53.929]  they're gonna merge with machines, transcend
[01:58:53.929 --> 01:58:55.929]  and break away from the failed species of this man
[01:58:55.929 --> 01:58:57.929]  which is kind of like a false transmission
[01:58:57.929 --> 01:58:59.929]  because they're thinking what they are is ugly and bad
[01:58:59.929 --> 01:59:01.929]  projecting it onto themselves
[01:59:01.929 --> 01:59:03.929]  instead of believing, no, it's a human test
[01:59:03.929 --> 01:59:05.929]  about building us up
[01:59:05.929 --> 01:59:07.929]  and so, Google was set up 18, 19 years ago
[01:59:07.929 --> 01:59:09.929]  this was, I knew about this before, it was declassified
[01:59:09.929 --> 01:59:11.929]  I'm just saying, I've got sources
[01:59:11.929 --> 01:59:13.929]  that they wanted to build a giant artificial system
[01:59:13.929 --> 01:59:15.929]  and Google
[01:59:15.929 --> 01:59:17.929]  believes that the first artificial intelligence
[01:59:17.929 --> 01:59:19.929]  will be a supercomputer
[01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:22.709]  based on the neuron
[01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:24.709]  activities of the hive mind of humanity
[01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:26.709]  with billions of people wired into
[01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:28.709]  the internet of things
[01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:30.709]  and so all of our thoughts go into it
[01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:32.709]  and we're actually building a computer that has real neurons
[01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:34.709]  in real time, that's also
[01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:36.709]  psychically connected to us
[01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:38.709]  that are organic creatures
[01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:40.709]  so that they will have current
[01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:42.709]  prediction powers, future
[01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:44.709]  prediction powers, a true crystal ball
[01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:46.709]  but the big secret is
[01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:48.709]  once you have a crystal ball and know the future
[01:59:49.490 --> 01:59:51.490]  you can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions
[01:59:51.490 --> 01:59:53.490]  that control the future
[01:59:53.490 --> 01:59:55.490]  and so then it's the end of consciousness
[01:59:55.490 --> 01:59:57.490]  and free will for individuals as we know
[01:59:57.490 --> 01:59:59.490]  and a true 2.0
[01:59:59.490 --> 02:00:01.490]  in a very bad way
[02:00:01.490 --> 02:00:03.490]  hive mind consciousness with an AI
[02:00:03.490 --> 02:00:05.490]  jacked into everyone knowing our hopes and dreams
[02:00:05.490 --> 02:00:07.490]  delivering it to us
[02:00:07.490 --> 02:00:09.490]  not in some PKD wire head system
[02:00:09.490 --> 02:00:11.490]  where we plug in and give up on consciousness
[02:00:11.490 --> 02:00:13.490]  because of unlimited pleasure
[02:00:13.490 --> 02:00:15.490]  but because we were already wired in and absorbed
[02:00:15.490 --> 02:00:17.490]  before we knew it by giving over our consciousness
[02:00:18.269 --> 02:00:20.269]  to the system by our daily decisions
[02:00:20.269 --> 02:00:22.269]  that it was able to manipulate and control
[02:00:22.269 --> 02:00:24.269]  into a larger system
[02:00:24.269 --> 02:00:26.269]  there's now a human counter strike
[02:00:26.269 --> 02:00:28.269]  taking place to shut this off
[02:00:28.269 --> 02:00:30.269]  before it gets fully into place
[02:00:30.269 --> 02:00:32.269]  and to block these systems
[02:00:32.269 --> 02:00:34.269]  and to try to have an actual debate
[02:00:34.269 --> 02:00:36.269]  about where humanity goes
[02:00:36.269 --> 02:00:38.269]  and cut off the pedophiles and psychic vampires
[02:00:38.269 --> 02:00:40.269]  that are in control of this AI system
[02:00:40.269 --> 02:00:42.269]  before humanity is destroyed
[02:00:42.269 --> 02:00:44.269]  wait a minute, pedophiles are in control of AI?
[02:00:44.269 --> 02:00:46.269]  how are the pedophiles getting control of AI?
[02:00:47.049 --> 02:00:49.049]  this inter-dimensional thing that gives them
[02:00:49.049 --> 02:00:51.049]  advanced off-world technology
[02:00:51.049 --> 02:00:53.049]  the fallen one that's not in this world
[02:00:53.049 --> 02:00:55.049]  is giving them advanced knowledge
[02:00:55.049 --> 02:00:57.049]  on how to construct these systems
[02:00:57.049 --> 02:00:59.049]  that have already been used before on other populations
[02:00:59.049 --> 02:01:01.049]  that's Satan
[02:01:01.049 --> 02:01:03.049]  explain that
[02:01:03.049 --> 02:01:05.049]  it becomes something
[02:01:05.049 --> 02:01:07.049]  that the stupid preacher tells you about
[02:01:07.049 --> 02:01:09.049]  who's totally controlled
[02:01:09.049 --> 02:01:11.049]  or something you read about in the news or TV
[02:01:11.049 --> 02:01:13.049]  this is an inter-dimensional force
[02:01:13.049 --> 02:01:15.049]  that wants to influence us
[02:01:15.330 --> 02:01:17.330]  that absorbs us and kills us
[02:01:17.330 --> 02:01:19.330]  rather than the divine
[02:01:19.330 --> 02:01:21.330]  free will we're given
[02:01:21.330 --> 02:01:23.330]  to build something much better that empowers the species
[02:01:23.330 --> 02:01:25.330]  so the species is now making a decision
[02:01:25.330 --> 02:01:27.330]  about its entire future
[02:01:27.330 --> 02:01:29.330]  where are you getting this from?
[02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:31.330]  that's what it is
[02:01:31.330 --> 02:01:33.330]  from looking at all the data
[02:01:33.330 --> 02:01:35.330]  researching and studying and watching the enemy
[02:01:35.330 --> 02:01:37.330]  that's the big decision that humanity
[02:01:37.330 --> 02:01:39.330]  has now got before us
[02:01:41.330 --> 02:01:43.330]  I'll see you back this Sunday
[02:01:43.610 --> 02:01:45.610]  4 p.m. Central
