[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  You
[00:48.440 --> 00:55.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live global broadcast Monday, June 17th, 2019
[00:56.040 --> 00:58.040]  I'm your host Alex Jones
[00:58.040 --> 01:00.040]  I've been on air 25 years
[01:00.800 --> 01:03.160]  you've passed that mark just last month and
[01:05.280 --> 01:07.280]  I probably was on the air five years
[01:07.840 --> 01:11.120]  before I ever said this is the most important broadcast I've ever done or
[01:11.960 --> 01:14.120]  The planet is incredible danger right now
[01:16.440 --> 01:20.200]  And then maybe 10 years ago I started saying it about once a year and
[01:20.920 --> 01:26.160]  Now you've noticed the last few years. I've been saying it every month or so now. I'm saying it every week
[01:26.160 --> 01:33.140]  Just last week Vladimir Putin who has over 10,000 nuclear weapons under his control and Lord knows what else?
[01:33.640 --> 01:39.400]  Came out and said the planet's never been in more danger of ending the human population with a nuclear war and
[01:39.800 --> 01:42.680]  He begged the United States to stop what they were doing
[01:43.440 --> 01:49.200]  We know what that was now. There was a giant cyber attack launched in the last month against the Russians
[01:50.200 --> 01:54.040]  That endangered the nuclear power plants launched out of the United States
[01:54.040 --> 01:57.800]  Now this was done by the deep state to unseat Trump
[01:57.800 --> 02:03.520]  I've always said they could run a false flag as the leaked CIA document showed under vault seven and
[02:04.280 --> 02:10.280]  This would be the exact type of thing they would do to cause a new war. I had a basically embarrassed trumpet unseat him
[02:10.880 --> 02:12.880]  Well, they've done just that
[02:13.080 --> 02:16.200]  Despite the fact the president came out yesterday and said it was treason
[02:16.720 --> 02:22.000]  The media continues to run with the story now. I want to say this very succinctly
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.440]  the New York Times came out this weekend and
[02:26.880 --> 02:30.840]  So the United States had offensively launched cyber attacks
[02:32.040 --> 02:34.680]  crippling the Russian power grid in
[02:35.120 --> 02:40.320]  The last month and a half to show them that we wouldn't put up with how they stole the election in
[02:41.080 --> 02:44.480]  2016 now a they didn't steal the election. That's been proven to be a fraud
[02:44.480 --> 02:53.840]  B to offensively say we have planted code in your power grid when that's how Chernobyl blew up was power surges
[02:53.840 --> 02:55.920]  And they had to turn it off and it blew up
[02:57.240 --> 03:04.800]  They just had power grids go out in South America the likes of which have never gone out power grids went out last week all over Europe
[03:07.440 --> 03:10.280]  Ladies and gentlemen all hell is breaking loose
[03:10.280 --> 03:15.440]  And now I wasn't sure whether it was the Iranians or whether it was a false flag with the ships last week
[03:16.080 --> 03:20.120]  Because the Iranians had said we'll close the Strait of Hormuz under advice from Kerry
[03:22.120 --> 03:24.120]  Shadow diplomacy against Trump
[03:25.440 --> 03:30.680]  Then you see the attacks but evidence starts to point that it's a false flag and our sources say it's a false flag
[03:31.240 --> 03:33.600]  Then you have this whopper of a false flag
[03:34.040 --> 03:36.040]  the president comes out and
[03:36.040 --> 03:44.040]  and says this is treason and it's not true and we didn't launch offensive attacks on the Russians
[03:44.040 --> 03:49.600]  That's war and there's no proof. They hacked into our systems. There's no proof. They got into voting machines
[03:49.840 --> 03:55.560]  So the New York Times use this story about how we're at war with Russia and we've attacked them first
[03:57.080 --> 04:02.600]  To insert the lie because the Pentagon knows the Russians hacked the voting machines
[04:02.600 --> 04:05.040]  This is insanity
[04:06.440 --> 04:14.040]  Ladies and gentlemen and we have to remove the deep state now these people are out of control that can you guys pull me last week stacks?
[04:15.200 --> 04:20.480]  Where I have all the famous admitted false flags at sea and then Dick Cheney saying you wanted to stage it and then
[04:21.040 --> 04:23.720]  The neocon think tank advising it just last year
[04:24.280 --> 04:29.440]  Because now it all came together when I was reading this last night and I tried to take a few days off
[04:29.440 --> 04:31.440]  I usually am constantly reading news
[04:31.440 --> 04:33.400]  I
[04:33.400 --> 04:38.240]  I took off to take my kids out to the lake and you know roast hot dogs around the fire and
[04:38.600 --> 04:42.760]  Last night. I started looking at the news again and jumped out of my skin. I
[04:43.520 --> 04:49.680]  Mean this is this is unbelievably dangerous. This is insane
[04:49.960 --> 04:53.560]  This is treason as the president said and here's what's scarier
[04:53.600 --> 04:58.280]  The news is still running with it saying it's true that we're at war with Russia
[04:58.280 --> 05:06.560]  Info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so
[05:06.880 --> 05:14.280]  It's it's it's Orwellian. It's it's biblical. It's it's authoritarian. It's insane and I keep trying to judge and gauge
[05:14.280 --> 05:16.280]  When is the right time?
[05:16.280 --> 05:21.880]  To have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say hey, we're sinking
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.800]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat
[05:24.800 --> 05:30.560]  But this is the real SOS if you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting info wars
[05:30.560 --> 05:34.400]  Will be shut down not just crippled and so we've reached that point
[05:34.720 --> 05:38.760]  It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever we have with stood so many of their attacks
[05:38.800 --> 05:42.760]  We've gone through so much because of your support you have you have been there
[05:42.760 --> 05:47.800]  But let me tell you they are pissed they haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault
[05:47.800 --> 05:54.640]  So we need your prayers your financial support and your word of mouth now at info or short.com. It's your fight
[05:54.880 --> 05:59.320]  Decide whether or not you want info wars to continue because we could be shut down
[06:05.520 --> 06:09.840]  You are listening to an info wars.com frontline report
[06:09.840 --> 06:16.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[06:23.680 --> 06:28.320]  From deep in the heart of FEMA region 6, Austin, Texas
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.180]  Transmitting worldwide. It's Alex Jones
[06:33.120 --> 06:36.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's June 17th, 2019
[06:36.360 --> 06:41.200]  And as the world escalates as we move towards the Singularity
[06:42.720 --> 06:44.720]  the quickening
[06:44.760 --> 06:46.760]  Ragnarok, Guder Damarong
[06:47.240 --> 06:49.240]  end of days
[06:49.760 --> 06:52.800]  As we head towards the possibility of that that I hope we can avert
[06:53.680 --> 06:57.360]  Globlists believe the end of man is here. The new silicon gods are about to rise
[06:57.360 --> 07:05.320]  As we accelerate towards this each week. I'm now saying this is the most important broadcasts. I've ever done. I
[07:06.200 --> 07:08.680]  Used to go five six years before I'd say that
[07:09.520 --> 07:14.800]  The first 15 years of my broadcast. I might have said it three four times now. I started saying it every month now
[07:14.800 --> 07:16.480]  It's every week
[07:16.480 --> 07:18.480]  ladies and gentlemen, I
[07:20.160 --> 07:23.760]  Have so much incredible news that all ties together
[07:23.760 --> 07:28.360]  And I'm gonna do my best to cover it all today, but let me just calmly
[07:29.280 --> 07:31.280]  give you the top story and
[07:32.240 --> 07:36.040]  Then calmly try to go through this with everybody
[07:37.160 --> 07:39.160]  the New York Times came out on
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  Saturday and
[07:43.040 --> 07:45.040]  again on Sunday and
[07:45.040 --> 07:48.080]  Said the United States is it war with Russia?
[07:48.080 --> 07:53.640]  And that the United States has attacked the Russian power grid
[07:55.480 --> 07:57.480]  Mainly run by nuclear reactors
[07:59.080 --> 08:03.160]  To show Russia that we're boss now a that's illegal
[08:04.480 --> 08:06.480]  Be it's insane
[08:07.720 --> 08:09.720]  But see
[08:12.320 --> 08:14.320]  See
[08:14.320 --> 08:21.480]  It's a lie and the president came out on Twitter and said this is not true. This is treason by the New York Times
[08:22.400 --> 08:24.400]  running these lies
[08:27.040 --> 08:29.840]  And he says again in multiple tweets it is not true
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.240]  Now let's pull back if you've been following this what's this really about
[08:37.600 --> 08:40.600]  It's about creating a crisis to make Trump look bad
[08:40.600 --> 08:45.440]  It's about within the lie that Russia attacked us with no proof
[08:47.600 --> 08:49.600]  Previously it's about
[08:49.760 --> 08:56.720]  Legitimizing offensive war with Russia, which is a policy Hillary Clinton called for when she was running for president and after
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  She was defeated
[08:59.040 --> 09:01.040]  Clinton
[09:01.040 --> 09:11.520]  Treat cyber attacks like any other attack August 31st 2016 the Hill the
[09:12.120 --> 09:18.640]  Perfect way to frame somebody and that's in the vault seven documents that came out that same year leaked by the CIA against themselves
[09:19.280 --> 09:23.440]  That criminal elements inside our government were going into Russian servers and
[09:23.440 --> 09:31.360]  Attacking in the United States to try to start a war with Russia and or to get funding. So let me just calmly walk through this year
[09:32.600 --> 09:34.600]  I'm gonna say this very slowly
[09:35.320 --> 09:39.280]  This is how giant wars start. This is how planets end
[09:40.880 --> 09:42.320]  Chew it up, please
[09:42.320 --> 09:49.400]  Vladimir Putin last week said the world has never been in more danger of destroying itself
[09:49.400 --> 09:55.520]  Humanities never been in more danger. He said from nuclear weapons. He said the United States is moving weapons up against our borders
[09:56.200 --> 10:04.240]  Nuclear weapons and other attacks that he did not name and talking to a world federation of individuals at a summit in St.
[10:04.240 --> 10:05.000]  Petersburg
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.400]  He said the planet has never been in more danger
[10:07.560 --> 10:14.800]  The world Federation of scientists came out and moved the doomsday clock closer to midnight than it was during the Cuban Missile Crisis
[10:15.080 --> 10:17.080]  in the early 1960s
[10:17.080 --> 10:24.360]  Now he hadn't gone public what was happening the New York Times publishes a cover story
[10:25.840 --> 10:29.840]  Saying that a Russia hacked our voting systems on
[10:30.920 --> 10:37.160]  2016 to delegitimize the election that's never been proven never even been said to be serious
[10:39.560 --> 10:41.560]  Total
[10:41.560 --> 10:50.560]  Abject bolder-dash baloney that they put out on Saturday the 15th bigger stories
[10:51.680 --> 10:53.680]  Sunday the 16th
[10:54.520 --> 10:56.360]  The president
[10:56.360 --> 11:02.560]  Tweeted out that day and the day after and said this is treason and total lie and none of this happened on either side
[11:02.560 --> 11:04.560]  which is true and
[11:04.560 --> 11:12.440]  It's gotten almost no coverage and this morning going over hundreds of articles at home hundreds of articles here
[11:12.440 --> 11:17.080]  We don't lay these articles out on here as a as a prop. These are all stacks. I've gone through
[11:19.560 --> 11:23.560]  They're still running with the fact that we'll show them damn Russians
[11:24.480 --> 11:30.960]  Remember Keith Overman Russian scum. We're at war with Russia. Remember that two years ago. It's all been disproven
[11:30.960 --> 11:34.880]  But they're rushing ahead with it
[11:35.960 --> 11:39.440]  That ups the chances that they attacks on the ship last week were false flags
[11:39.440 --> 11:46.720]  I was saying Tehran has warned they do this that puts them right up there as main suspects plus carry in the deep shader over there advising them
[11:49.760 --> 11:53.520]  This is multinational this is global this is geopolitical
[11:57.040 --> 11:59.040]  TNT we're playing with a
[11:59.040 --> 12:01.920]  A factory of TNT with fuses everywhere
[12:02.040 --> 12:06.560]  We got a bunch of lobotomized monkeys running around with lit sparklers and
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  Flamethrowers inside there and it's only a matter of days or weeks until this goes sky-high
[12:14.920 --> 12:21.320]  It's all still being said US escalates online attacks on Russian power grid it's it's it's all being
[12:21.880 --> 12:22.760]  feverishly
[12:22.760 --> 12:24.120]  reported and
[12:24.120 --> 12:29.600]  CNN saying the president's a liar Russia
[12:30.920 --> 12:35.680]  Stole the election for him and we're attacking Russia and you read this article of the New York Times
[12:36.600 --> 12:41.960]  Or you read the other ones and it reads like a dr. Strange Love movie a Stanley Kubrick film
[12:42.720 --> 12:47.520]  Like general Jack T. Ripper's running things and here's what the lead producer pointed out Daria
[12:47.520 --> 12:55.200]  Notice Trump though is saying the New York Times engaged in treason. No, the New York Times got told this by John Bolton
[12:55.200 --> 12:57.200]  Just as sure as the Sun came up today
[12:57.600 --> 13:01.160]  And he got told this by the the special working groups
[13:01.160 --> 13:06.520]  They've got inside these 18 intelligence agencies and it's madness
[13:07.440 --> 13:14.760]  It's total and complete madness. So he says it's treason. He says it's not true. There's another tweet where he says that and
[13:14.760 --> 13:21.440]  Obviously, it isn't true. Now. Here's what we know though. There have been cyber attacks in Russia
[13:22.480 --> 13:25.040]  So think about the perfect way to stage a false flag
[13:25.360 --> 13:30.200]  You don't have to land frogmen on somebody's ship to blow it up and blame somebody else
[13:30.360 --> 13:36.960]  You just get into somebody else's servers jump through other servers use a bunch of high-tech cloaking systems
[13:36.960 --> 13:38.960]  They've got they admit and then you attack
[13:38.960 --> 13:45.160]  People's systems and trigger malware that you already loaded on to their programs
[13:45.160 --> 13:49.960]  And then you can take them down and then you can say somebody else did it
[13:54.560 --> 14:00.680]  It's incredible and we've been there documenting it since day one ladies and gentlemen
[14:02.440 --> 14:07.360]  What what happened to us just last week we learned we've been under investigation for two weeks by the FBI who then
[14:07.360 --> 14:10.720]  Gave a statement to my lawyer and said info wars is the victim
[14:12.680 --> 14:18.280]  Someone sent you emails with child porn on them you didn't open them and it just so happened to be we're gonna get you for talking
[14:18.280 --> 14:24.520]  About Sandy Hook you piece of crap. Here's more threats and if you clicked on it, which we didn't do it's child porn
[14:24.680 --> 14:31.400]  The national media ran with info wars infected with malware with child porn. Their servers aren't safe
[14:32.200 --> 14:36.000]  Think about the deception, but the FBI does say that Jones is innocent
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.520]  It wasn't malware. It was individuals sending us emails to trick us to open them
[14:41.800 --> 14:48.360]  Saying we're gonna get you Alex Jones and here's our threats against you and you click on it and it's horrible crime
[14:49.880 --> 14:53.120]  You're having a look at and then you've supposedly committed a crime of you knowingly did it
[14:55.440 --> 15:01.840]  But you can't let info wars be a victim. Oh, no, no, so it just turns into a national story. Do you hear about Jones and child porn?
[15:01.840 --> 15:07.720]  Yeah, he's not guilty. It was malware. His servers aren't safe. It wasn't our
[15:08.720 --> 15:10.720]  servers ladies and gentlemen
[15:10.840 --> 15:13.840]  It wasn't a malware attack
[15:15.680 --> 15:17.680]  It was
[15:18.560 --> 15:23.240]  14 emails sent to us in the last two years since we got sued
[15:24.720 --> 15:28.440]  Trying to trick us to open it up and then when they get their
[15:28.440 --> 15:35.440]  Court order to give them any Sandy Hook emails. Well, they get to go through it and they find those attachments
[15:35.720 --> 15:39.200]  Magically out of thousands of emails and then run to the FBI
[15:39.560 --> 15:46.640]  Hoping we get put in jail for it. That's the Democratic Party for you. That's who they are. But guess what? Nobody's buying
[15:48.160 --> 15:55.040]  But what do they start World War three World War four? Think about that. We are now at war with Russia says the New York Times and
[15:55.040 --> 16:01.560]  Trump says it's all a lie. That's dangerous. Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the US
[16:01.560 --> 16:08.440]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart and body extract

[17:15.680 --> 17:22.160]  That's gonna let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding
[17:22.160 --> 17:25.680]  We're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi because of the flooding
[17:25.680 --> 17:30.800]  We've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse

[19:39.040 --> 19:41.040]  Cause that's what the people out here are talking about infowarstore.com
[19:41.040 --> 19:44.040]  I'm at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com

[19:58.040 --> 20:16.040]  Go there
[20:29.040 --> 20:31.040]  This country is about to be handed over to SCUM
[20:31.040 --> 20:33.040]  Who are beholden to SCUM
[20:33.040 --> 20:36.040]  Russian SCUM
[20:36.040 --> 20:40.040]  As things are today, January 20th will not be an inauguration
[20:40.040 --> 20:43.040]  But rather the end of the United States as an independent country
[20:43.040 --> 20:46.040]  It will not be a peaceful change of power
[20:46.040 --> 20:48.040]  It will be a usurpation
[20:48.040 --> 20:55.040]  And the usurper has no validity, no credibility, and no authority under the Constitution
[20:55.040 --> 21:02.040]  This is a reality that will become the only reality until this country rids itself of Donald John Trump
[21:02.040 --> 21:04.040]  He is not a president
[21:04.040 --> 21:08.040]  He is a puppet put in power by Vladimir Putin
[21:08.040 --> 21:12.040]  And those who ignore these elemental existential facts
[21:12.040 --> 21:16.040]  Democrats or Republicans are traitors to this country
[21:16.040 --> 21:21.040]  And will immediately and forever after be held accountable
[21:21.040 --> 21:23.040]  Resist
[21:23.040 --> 21:25.040]  Peace
[21:29.040 --> 21:32.040]  Well, that's when President Trump got inaugurated
[21:32.040 --> 21:35.040]  Keith Orman swore he'd be gone within a year
[21:35.040 --> 21:37.040]  Never happened
[21:37.040 --> 21:42.040]  But now the neocons with the left inside the White House working with John Kerry and Obama
[21:42.040 --> 21:46.040]  Are admittedly going around trying to start a giant war
[21:46.040 --> 21:49.040]  An international crisis that they believe will topple Trump
[21:49.040 --> 21:53.040]  Trump calls a newspaper report on Russia power grid treason
[21:53.040 --> 21:58.040]  Says that Russia didn't hack our servers for the election
[21:58.040 --> 22:02.040]  They can't even really prove bots went around influencing people
[22:02.040 --> 22:08.040]  And he says that the idea that we have been for months attacking their power grid is insane
[22:08.040 --> 22:12.040]  But there have been power grid attacks in Russia
[22:12.040 --> 22:15.040]  Probably by globalists, then they come out and say in the New York Times
[22:15.040 --> 22:23.040]  Hey, we're the ones attacking you obviously trying to goad the Russians into a war
[22:23.040 --> 22:26.040]  Let's read what the president had to say
[22:26.040 --> 22:31.040]  Trump calls newspaper report on Russia power grid treason, AP
[22:31.040 --> 22:37.040]  President Donald Trump has lashed out at the New York Times saying it engaged in a virtual act of treason
[22:37.040 --> 22:42.040]  For a story that said the US was ramping up its cyber incursions into the Russian power grid
[22:42.040 --> 22:49.040]  Do you believe that the failing New York Times just did a story stating that the United States is subsequently increasing cyber attacks on Russia?
[22:49.040 --> 22:53.040]  This is virtual act of treason
[22:53.040 --> 22:59.040]  By once great newspaper so desperate for story, any story even hits bad for its own country, he wrote
[22:59.040 --> 23:07.040]  The story reported the development of American computer code and the deployment into the Russia's grid and other targets to act as a deterrent
[23:07.040 --> 23:12.040]  Oh, we've loaded malicious stuff onto your power grids to bring them down, that's an act of terrorism
[23:12.040 --> 23:23.040]  The newspaper also said the US Cyber Command, part of the Department of Defense had explored the possibility that Russia might try to initiate secretive blackouts in key states to disrupt the 2020 election
[23:23.040 --> 23:30.040]  Oh, if the Clintons from the Obamas say they tried to get into our voting machines with no proof
[23:30.040 --> 23:41.040]  Well, and if you might do something in 2020, let's preemptively go do it to you and then tell the world that there's malicious code
[23:41.040 --> 23:48.040]  Then what do hackers do when they hear about a malicious code out there, they exploit it
[23:48.040 --> 24:04.040]  This is 101 cyberterrorism and they've announced that the US is engaged in cyberterrorism and are holding the Russians hostage with ticking time bombs that others can then exploit
[24:04.040 --> 24:10.040]  And what they're really saying is others go exploit it, bring down their power grid, most of which is nuclear powered
[24:10.040 --> 24:16.040]  The Russians and the French get most of their power off nuclear reactors
[24:16.040 --> 24:25.040]  Now what do you think happens if some of those go up? This is an escalation that's Hitler level against the Russians
[24:25.040 --> 24:33.040]  And I'll tell you something right now, nothing's been done like this to Russia since Hitler invaded in 1941 with Operation Barbarossa
[24:33.040 --> 24:37.040]  I'm not a Russophile, I'm a reality file, and a survival file
[24:37.040 --> 24:41.040]  I kind of like living in planet Earth being here, not getting vaporized on the surface
[24:41.040 --> 24:49.040]  And the fact that Trump's being diverted as usual, that the New York Times did this? No, the New York Times didn't do this
[24:49.040 --> 24:57.040]  The New York Times took orders from the psychotic neocons and the psychotic left who are the same thing, who want power
[24:57.040 --> 25:02.040]  And who said, we'll use international instances to embarrass the president
[25:02.040 --> 25:05.040]  Remember Michael Moore? When he was President-elect said, don't worry
[25:05.040 --> 25:11.040]  Within six months there'll be an international crisis, North Korea, that'll make him look like a fool
[25:11.040 --> 25:14.040]  But Trump went and at least partially diffused it
[25:14.040 --> 25:18.040]  Then we learned the neocons were trying to what? Derail it
[25:18.040 --> 25:21.040]  He tried to pull out of Afghanistan, they tried to derail it
[25:21.040 --> 25:24.040]  He pulled out of Syria, they called it treason
[25:24.040 --> 25:30.040]  On and on and on, and the left now says, on average in national polls, they love war
[25:30.040 --> 25:36.040]  They just love war, they love it so much, it's so liberal, it's so sweet, it's so good
[25:36.040 --> 25:38.040]  And it goes on from there
[25:38.040 --> 25:41.040]  U.S. escalates online attacks on Russia power grid
[25:41.040 --> 25:47.040]  We come back, I'm going to read some of this to you, because it's meant to enrage the Russians
[25:47.040 --> 25:53.040]  How we're taking them out, how we're going to show them, you know how we can do this and that
[25:53.040 --> 25:59.040]  And it just gets more insane from there and it ties in to the ships last week
[25:59.040 --> 26:05.040]  And the fact that guaranteed Obama and Kerry admittedly were advising them on how to get Trump to back down
[26:05.040 --> 26:12.040]  So they said, we'll ship sinks, we will sink ships in the Persian Gulf, in the Strait of Hormuz
[26:12.040 --> 26:19.040]  Then they just set the Iranians up to make it look like it was them when then they had their operatives carry out
[26:19.040 --> 26:23.040]  The attacks, the evidence is mounting, and it's the same thing here
[26:23.040 --> 26:30.040]  Start a war with Russia, start an incident with Russia, start a huge war with Iran
[26:30.040 --> 26:37.040]  Derail the peace talks with Kim Jong-un, that's their global strategy of crisis, their global strategy of tension
[26:37.040 --> 26:46.040]  Now, that's one stack of the news, there's more than 20 stacks here that are all just as bombshell, just as insane
[26:46.040 --> 26:53.040]  The new global world currency has been officially announced and endorsed by central banks
[26:53.040 --> 26:59.040]  We knew that cryptocurrency was being put out by the globalist to get you used to it to think it was avant-garde and grassroots
[26:59.040 --> 27:03.040]  They would then tank it and they would then bring in the new global currency
[27:03.040 --> 27:10.040]  I'm not saying cryptocurrencies are bad, I'm saying this was their plan, it's now all confirmed and Facebook is doing it
[27:10.040 --> 27:17.040]  Facebook has now said if you don't behave, they're watching you at all times, you'll not be able to buy or sell
[27:17.040 --> 27:22.040]  They said that Friday, yes, biblical prophecy is being fulfilled
[27:22.040 --> 27:28.040]  Your church won't say a damn word because they're going to take Facebook currency, it's all there's going to be
[27:28.040 --> 27:33.040]  That's right, one ring to rule them all and end the darkness, bind them
[27:33.040 --> 27:37.040]  You want to be in the new world order folks, you're going to be in it
[27:37.040 --> 27:40.040]  That's just one small stackie
[27:40.040 --> 27:50.040]  When I said 20 stacks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27
[27:50.040 --> 27:53.040]  27 stacks, I don't exaggerate
[27:53.040 --> 27:57.040]  27 stacks, each one more insane
[27:57.040 --> 28:05.040]  As the quickening accelerates, my chimney crickets, this point I have entered insane asylum land
[28:05.040 --> 28:09.040]  Please don't forget, they're trying to totally shut us down
[28:09.040 --> 28:15.040]  I mean, when they're trying to plant child porn on you and you get sued and folks know right to what to go look for
[28:15.040 --> 28:20.040]  You know, you're not in Kansas anymore, are you? No, you're not in Kansas anymore
[28:20.040 --> 28:25.040]  We need massive capital, people say why are you expanding? You either expand or you implode
[28:25.040 --> 28:30.040]  I'm just trying to stay the course, launch a few more shows, get some more reporters out there in the field

[32:10.040 --> 32:14.040]  By people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another
[32:14.040 --> 32:19.040]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach
[32:19.040 --> 32:26.040]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self supporting, self sustaining, self structured, little d democratic structure
[32:26.040 --> 32:34.040]  That because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars
[32:34.040 --> 32:40.040]  And it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want
[32:40.040 --> 32:47.040]  That actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech
[32:47.040 --> 32:52.040]  Support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold
[32:52.040 --> 33:21.040]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[33:22.040 --> 33:32.040]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[33:52.040 --> 34:07.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host. The President has come out and shown clear example of treason against the American people
[34:07.040 --> 34:16.040]  Treason against life on the surface of this planet. The New York Times working with criminals inside the Trump administration and inside the intelligence communities
[34:16.040 --> 34:28.040]  Falsely gave information in the New York Times that we have been cyber attacking the Russian power grid for months and that we're basically at war with the Russians
[34:28.040 --> 34:35.040]  And then even after the President came out yesterday and said that the report was false, almost no media is running with it
[34:35.040 --> 34:46.040]  Buried within the lie is the bigger lie that the Russians hacked into servers for election machines in 2016 and gave the election to Trump
[34:46.040 --> 34:52.040]  No one has ever shown any evidence of that but they stated like it is fact
[34:52.040 --> 34:58.040]  This is bigger than claiming WMDs were hidden in Iraq that weren't because they didn't really have WMDs
[34:58.040 --> 35:07.040]  This is starting a war, an active war against a country that has 10,000 nuclear weapons and it all came out of Hillary Clinton's mouth
[35:07.040 --> 35:17.040]  Before she even lost the election she said if Russia ever medals in our power grid we should nuke them and we should offensively start attacking them
[35:17.040 --> 35:28.040]  This is all CFR, neocon, madman, megalomania, Hitler level stuff, okay?
[35:28.040 --> 35:35.040]  Here's the headlines, the document, Trump calls newspaper report on Russia power grid treason says there's no truth to it, it's a total lie
[35:35.040 --> 35:41.040]  But he doesn't point out who is in his administration telling the New York Times this and you know it's Bolton
[35:41.040 --> 35:47.040]  U.S. escalates online attacks on Russia power grid is the New York Times huge disinfo piece
[35:47.040 --> 35:54.040]  And we have all the famous examples of attacks on ships to get us into wars
[35:54.040 --> 36:02.040]  We have Hillary Clinton again August 31 saying threat of cyber attacks like any other attack attack them
[36:02.040 --> 36:09.040]  Incredibly dangerous and you've got huge power grids going on in Argentina, Uruguay, restore power for massive blackouts
[36:09.040 --> 36:16.040]  In their history, they're hunting for it, there's been power outages in Russia, in Europe, unprecedented ones
[36:16.040 --> 36:20.040]  Moscow warns against baseless accusations over the tanker attacks
[36:20.040 --> 36:29.040]  Remember Stuxnet was reported first by us a full year before it was admitted that it was a U.S. slash Israeli operation
[36:29.040 --> 36:32.040]  Will Stuxnet malware be used in false flag attack?
[36:32.040 --> 36:36.040]  It was computer expert, U.S. was behind Stuxnet
[36:36.040 --> 36:40.040]  PeopleWars.com, Paul Joseph Watson, turned out it was correct
[36:40.040 --> 36:46.040]  Here it is, seven facts, Vault 7, CIA hacking tool dumped by WikiLeaks
[36:46.040 --> 36:53.040]  What's in it? How to frame the Russians particularly or anybody else you want with proxy systems
[36:53.040 --> 36:58.040]  That live time will translate whatever you're doing into their other language
[36:58.040 --> 37:04.040]  It's all right there
[37:04.040 --> 37:07.040]  CIA tools found across 16 countries
[37:07.040 --> 37:13.040]  And now even if we had loaded this on to their servers
[37:13.040 --> 37:16.040]  Telling people we'd done it would be treason
[37:16.040 --> 37:24.040]  And it's already super dangerous than other hackers and people know how to exploit it
[37:24.040 --> 37:39.040]  Latest WikiLeaks Daily Mail shows how the CIA used computer code to hide the origins of its hacking attacks and disguise them as Russian or Chinese activity
[37:39.040 --> 37:47.040]  WikiLeaks reveals marble, proofs CIA disguised their hacks as Russian, Chinese, and Arabic
[37:47.040 --> 37:51.040]  And it goes on and on and on and on
[37:51.040 --> 37:57.040]  Now I'm going to stop right there, I've just done the last three and a half segments on this
[37:57.040 --> 38:07.040]  And I'm going to stop, but next hour I'm going to open the phones up for folks that are security experts, cyber experts, IT folks, military, former NSA, Russians
[38:07.040 --> 38:10.040]  It doesn't matter, anybody that wants to call in and give your take on this
[38:10.040 --> 38:18.040]  But this is so criminal, this is so dangerous, this is so reckless, and it shows what I've been predicting
[38:18.040 --> 38:25.040]  They have four ways to take Trump down, the economy, but Trump's been blocking the Federal Reserve, raising interest rates
[38:25.040 --> 38:33.040]  Because he's taking action, the open borders, we're battling that, but that's a serious crisis, it'll still take time to sink us
[38:33.040 --> 38:37.040]  Election fraud, that's coming up in a year and a half
[38:37.040 --> 38:40.040]  The big one is war
[38:40.040 --> 38:45.040]  The big one is a war and then they'll embarrass the president with a bad response to the war
[38:45.040 --> 38:54.040]  And say that it's his fault, and he was easy on the Russians, or easy on the Iranians, or he backed out of the nuclear deal
[38:54.040 --> 39:03.040]  And it endangers the whole damn planet, and it needs to stop, and Trump needs to take the gloves off right now
[39:03.040 --> 39:12.040]  I'll open the phones up next hour, specifically for first-time callers that want to speak directly to this
[39:12.040 --> 39:17.040]  topic, and how dangerous you think it is, and what you think we should do, and what you think is really going on here
[39:17.040 --> 39:24.040]  But I agree with the president, it's treason, it's a lie, and it's totally dangerous, and it sells the idea there's going to be cyber attacks during the election
[39:24.040 --> 39:33.040]  So they can have cyber attacks during the election, blame it on Russia and claim they're helping Trump, and then hand it to the Democrats with their field of losers
[39:33.040 --> 39:39.040]  As the president said, only fake polls show us behind the motley crew
[39:39.040 --> 39:45.040]  We are looking very good, but it's far too early to be focused on that, much work to do, make America great again
[39:45.040 --> 39:55.040]  They're setting it up where they have cyber attacks, the deep state is still embedded, they then blame Trump and his Russian allies
[39:55.040 --> 40:05.040]  Trump loses, or becomes just credited even if he wins, they remove Trump, federalize elections as they tried to do in the last two and a half years
[40:05.040 --> 40:16.040]  They're running the same program over and over and over and over again, and it's disgusting
[40:16.040 --> 40:20.040]  Now let me tell you what's coming up at the next segment
[40:20.040 --> 40:26.040]  No, not Facebook announcing a new world government currency, and the world government saying it's approved
[40:26.040 --> 40:31.040]  So the first world government, one world currency has been announced, he told you it was coming through Facebook
[40:31.040 --> 40:39.040]  No, I'll get to that later in the middle of the next hour, how about this, suddenly it's all being admitted
[40:39.040 --> 40:45.040]  Shell phones, shell towers and cancer, link proven but 5G advances
[40:45.040 --> 40:51.040]  This is mainstream news, 5G smartphones cause cancer, big wireless doesn't want you to know, wired magazine
[40:51.040 --> 40:58.040]  And this new tidbit from the good folks over at ZeroHedge.com, it's up on Infowars.com
[40:58.040 --> 41:04.040]  Shell tower, shut down after complaints about cancer cluster in school kids and the teachers
[41:04.040 --> 41:11.040]  Wait till you see all the dead and dying kids at the school, wait till you find out about that
[41:11.040 --> 41:19.040]  Cause you know what cell phone radiation does, it rattles DNA, it's microwave, just like, it rubs the molecules together, breaks DNA
[41:19.040 --> 41:27.040]  It's a DNA smasher, but Trump thinks it's good for the economy so he's for it, another place he's falling down
[41:27.040 --> 41:37.040]  Hey, so we've got that coming up, we've also are going to get into mainstream media promoting prostitution to young girls as a new career move
[41:37.040 --> 41:46.040]  And to little boys that they could be a drag queen, I'm not joking, it's Teen Vogue, it's CBS News, that will be your job in the future
[41:46.040 --> 41:55.040]  Is if you're a boy, you'll be a girl, if you're a girl, you'll be a prostitute, you'll all be sex workers, but again, that's what's going on
[41:55.040 --> 42:04.040]  We're also going to be looking at the economy, Google recognizes Father's Day with a genderless creature
[42:04.040 --> 42:13.040]  We're also going to be looking at the latest on record number of African migrants coming to Mexican border AP
[42:13.040 --> 42:21.040]  And being caught with rolls of $100 crisp banknotes and debit cards with thousands of dollars on them with no name
[42:21.040 --> 42:29.040]  You know where it came from, U.S. taxpayers, U.S. aid, sends it to Soros who fences it and then brings the folks in
[42:29.040 --> 42:34.040]  And Trump's been trying to get that funding cut that's already been allotted by Congress
[42:34.040 --> 42:44.040]  So this is all the underground railroad from the world to here to bring in folks, put ships on their shoulders and teach them to hate the American people
[42:44.040 --> 42:46.040]  While they get free stuff
[42:46.040 --> 42:52.040]  So it's all coming up, tell everyone you know whether you're on AM and FM, watching on TV or the internet, how you're watching and listening
[42:52.040 --> 42:59.040]  It's how we break the globalist stranglehold of censorship, word of mouth, you are our only hope, infowars.com
[42:59.040 --> 43:05.040]  You know the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday
[43:05.040 --> 43:13.040]  That's why I need to make them strong now, now I can be there for my children, now I can make them strong, now I can instruct them, now I can teach them what I've learned
[43:13.040 --> 43:19.040]  But not once I'm gone, you think of this digital age, your words going forever, but now they're even better, getting rid of what you said they were before
[43:19.040 --> 43:25.040]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning, isn't it?
[43:25.040 --> 43:33.040]  But I have joined my will to the resistance, I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and the longer the people know the truth
[43:33.040 --> 43:40.040]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it
[43:40.040 --> 43:44.040]  There is a magic that then takes place, the transcend space and time
[43:44.040 --> 43:52.040]  When you commit, the word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing
[43:52.040 --> 43:59.040]  So please now, commit to support infowars, however you can, and realize your provision to infowars is your own provision
[44:01.040 --> 44:04.040]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air, thanks for calling Mike
[44:04.040 --> 44:08.040]  You are the man, Alex, I'm so glad to be talking to you, I'm so excited, I'm such a big fan
[44:08.040 --> 44:13.040]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products, I gotta do a shout out for the bone broth
[44:19.040 --> 44:23.040]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk
[44:30.040 --> 44:35.040]  I feel great since I've been taking it, my daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste
[44:35.040 --> 44:41.040]  I've used the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for that as well
[44:41.040 --> 44:45.040]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air, I'm thanking you, but yes
[44:45.040 --> 44:51.040]  This is the ultimate bone broth formula, with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom, the true bone broth
[44:51.040 --> 44:53.040]  It is next level, it really is good, so thank you
[44:53.040 --> 45:06.040]  I feel great since I've been taking it, thank you
[45:24.040 --> 45:28.040]  Your day to day life with heat, while encouraging hormonal balance
[45:28.040 --> 45:33.040]  Perfect by itself, or with SuperMail Vitality, in the true alpha male pack
[45:33.040 --> 45:38.040]  Alpha Power can help lose performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels

[45:50.040 --> 45:54.040]  With Alpha Power, head to InfowarsStore.com today
[46:20.040 --> 46:25.040]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged
[46:25.040 --> 46:29.040]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged
[46:29.040 --> 46:34.040]  The human body gets clogged just like that, and you may be experiencing backup too

[47:23.040 --> 47:49.040]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host
[47:49.040 --> 47:58.040]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central, and you better believe I'm trying to motivate you
[47:58.040 --> 48:02.040]  I'm not trying to scare you, I'm trying to motivate you
[48:02.040 --> 48:08.040]  Now I'm going to hit some news here in a moment that is pretty much the most important news that anybody can cover
[48:08.040 --> 48:19.040]  Dealing with something that we can actually mediate or mitigate and not have something that ends up killing more people than cigarettes has
[48:19.040 --> 48:30.040]  And that cell phones and all the rest of this garbage, because they keep upping the magnetic power, the radiation power, the microwave energy power
[48:30.040 --> 48:43.040]  And one of the most studied things out there, period, period, one of the most studied things that you're going to find is microwave radiation
[48:43.040 --> 48:51.040]  They knew when they first started using microwaves at the end of World War II that you'd get really sick if you stood in front of one of the projectors
[48:51.040 --> 48:58.040]  They started learning that they could heat up cans of beans by putting it on a post a few feet in front of it
[48:58.040 --> 49:07.040]  That's where they got the ideas for microwave ovens was because they started cooking their food with them in the 40s and 50s
[49:07.040 --> 49:15.040]  Now again, if it cooks beans, what's it doing to your brain? This is not rocket science, ladies and gentlemen
[49:15.040 --> 49:22.040]  And so yes, it's much lower level radiation at a distance, but it doesn't matter
[49:22.040 --> 49:29.040]  The sun puts out a wide spectrum of radiation, the light band and other rays
[49:29.040 --> 49:39.040]  And we all know that some sun's good for us, but if you laid out the sun in the Sahara Desert for a couple days, you would die with huge blisters all over your body
[49:39.040 --> 49:48.040]  But you see, that type of radiation doesn't penetrate
[49:48.040 --> 50:02.040]  But what does microwave radiation do? Why does your cell phone that has a microwave transmitter in it shoot through walls and go all the way out to towers?
[50:02.040 --> 50:11.040]  Why I've got four bars in here, four bars in here, four bars
[50:11.040 --> 50:17.040]  And even when I'm not using it, it's communicating back and forth with the towers sending information
[50:17.040 --> 50:24.040]  Now the studies show that these give you massive brain tumors, and that the type of brain tumor is depending on which side of your head
[50:24.040 --> 50:28.040]  Different tumors are up 2,000%, 3,000%, 4,000%
[50:28.040 --> 50:34.040]  Tumors that were very rare and very common, they always say, oh, let me guess, do you put the phone to your left side or your right side?
[50:34.040 --> 50:37.040]  And it's always the side you put it up to
[50:37.040 --> 50:40.040]  And there's magnetic scans of this, it shows it
[50:40.040 --> 50:43.040]  There were even studies I read 20 years ago on there that were like in CBS News
[50:43.040 --> 50:54.040]  They even tell you that the brain after a few minute conversation gets the temperature raised up to 2 degrees
[50:54.040 --> 50:58.040]  It's actually cooking your brain
[50:58.040 --> 51:04.040]  That's why I always use Bluetooth, and I don't keep it in my pocket most of the time, and I keep them away from me
[51:04.040 --> 51:09.040]  Because if you talk to the engineers, the antenna is about an inch long in these
[51:09.040 --> 51:16.040]  And you're getting microwave radiation that would, you could stick it in an egg and right around that antenna, it would cook that part of the egg
[51:16.040 --> 51:21.040]  You pull it out and have some cooked yolk on there
[51:21.040 --> 51:25.040]  Or egg white
[51:25.040 --> 51:33.040]  So imagine years of it up against your head, they also found in studies that there's an excites, the brain gets excited
[51:33.040 --> 51:36.040]  The brain is electrochemical
[51:36.040 --> 51:42.040]  And so people wonder why they seem to get so agitated the more they're on the phone
[51:42.040 --> 51:45.040]  Oh, and a lot of people just use a wire to it
[51:45.040 --> 51:51.040]  That a lot of times sends more of the radiation up the wire into your brain
[51:51.040 --> 51:55.040]  So
[51:55.040 --> 52:01.040]  Everybody knows when you stick one of these on top of a hospital or a school, suddenly massive numbers of cancers pop up
[52:01.040 --> 52:07.040]  20,000, 100,000 times, the local rate of cancer
[52:07.040 --> 52:15.040]  So it's just like when somebody knows, what is it about this neighborhood? Everybody's getting nosebleeds and cancer and you go, oh, you're a big landfill
[52:15.040 --> 52:21.040]  I have a friend who works here that his wife's sister
[52:21.040 --> 52:31.040]  She had that disease where her whole life she barely grew and by the time she was like 15 years old, she was like 120, and then she died
[52:31.040 --> 52:39.040]  And then a lot of other folks in the neighborhood all died and they said, oh my gosh, you're on top of a toxin landfill from the 40s
[52:39.040 --> 52:45.040]  And they all got multi-million dollar settlements, but they didn't want those multi-million dollar settlements
[52:45.040 --> 52:48.040]  They wanted their children alive
[52:48.040 --> 52:51.040]  And about half the people in the neighborhood got cancer
[52:51.040 --> 52:55.040]  Well, guess what happens when you live by a big cell tower?
[52:55.040 --> 52:59.040]  Let me go further. You don't want to live under high-powered tension wires
[52:59.040 --> 53:05.040]  They're giant antennas. That's why they have information transfer over power line that the government's already using
[53:05.040 --> 53:10.040]  That's DARPA's big secret communication system is information over the power lines
[53:10.040 --> 53:21.040]  And they can send data now into those that's picked up as wireless in your house and controls appliances that you didn't even know were wireless, but are wireless
[53:21.040 --> 53:23.040]  The former head of the CIA admitted to all this
[53:23.040 --> 53:35.040]  So, you know, those government-approved, managed little curly cube light bulbs, those are patented to be operated by communication over power lines
[53:35.040 --> 53:45.040]  And they can do a flicker rate that augments and interfaces with Microsoft programs with those little infrared sensors that are on them that they serve for other devices
[53:45.040 --> 53:52.040]  They're really for those. Oh, it goes further. It gets a lot better. They tested it in Minnesota eight years ago
[53:52.040 --> 53:58.040]  I saw an article in AP at a police station to calm the police officers
[53:58.040 --> 54:09.040]  The special light bulbs had a program flickering to calm them and make them happy. They didn't tell the officers for a year, not in Kansas anymore
[54:09.040 --> 54:21.040]  There's massive testing being done on you and your family. Now, there's a race to put 5G in every 300 or 400 yards, all over the country, all over the world
[54:21.040 --> 54:27.040]  And of course, the Chinese government was the fastest group rolling it out here at cost
[54:27.040 --> 54:35.040]  Well, Trump said, oh, they're able to break into all of our appliances into everything with these because they go through walls and they penetrate everything
[54:35.040 --> 54:43.040]  You can't have them near military bases. And if you've got one of their WAPO phones, you can't be in the military or bring it on base
[54:43.040 --> 54:49.040]  But what about the U.S. companies? What have we built? What have we done?
[54:49.040 --> 55:00.040]  5G, the LA Times and even Wired Magazine admit does give you cancer at higher rates than normal 4G or 3G
[55:00.040 --> 55:04.040]  So they're just upping the power because we put up with it
[55:04.040 --> 55:13.040]  And then everything's being designed to interface with it and work off of it because we don't want to run wires that deliver the signal better and easier
[55:13.040 --> 55:19.040]  We want everything in live time so there can be a worldwide social credit score
[55:19.040 --> 55:24.040]  And what did Facebook announce last Friday?
[55:24.040 --> 55:29.040]  They said, we're going and data mining everything you ever did in the 30 years of the Internet
[55:29.040 --> 55:34.040]  We're watching what you do in your house over the assistance units
[55:34.040 --> 55:39.040]  And if you ever said anything racist or bad, we're going to kick you off Facebook
[55:39.040 --> 55:48.040]  And in the future, that means banking, that means travel. It's the Chinese social score already rolling out
[55:48.040 --> 55:53.040]  And you won't be able to even, folks, I'm going to cover this next hour
[55:53.040 --> 56:01.040]  This is in a press release. Remember Samsung five years ago we wrote about it, said in its terms of service, watch what you say
[56:01.040 --> 56:08.040]  We have a video camera and audio and we're selling it to third parties. It said watch what you say
[56:08.040 --> 56:14.040]  And then Schmidt of Google said, yeah, watch what you do online, but what about when they bring the portals into the house
[56:14.040 --> 56:17.040]  That's following you and listening to you
[56:17.040 --> 56:24.040]  And then Facebook tells you, hey, dumb ephers, that's a quote about his users
[56:24.040 --> 56:30.040]  I'm going to have the global currency. I'm going to control everything you do. I'm going to run your life. I'm going to watch you
[56:30.040 --> 56:36.040]  And like fools, like the fools at Troy, we bring in the Trojan horse
[56:36.040 --> 56:41.040]  It's all coming up next hour, but go look at it for yourself
[56:41.040 --> 56:48.040]  Why in the world would they do this? It's about depopulation. It's about control. It's about social scores
[56:48.040 --> 56:52.040]  It's about tracking everything in a lifetime, whether you have a phone or don't
[56:52.040 --> 56:54.040]  With face scanning and all the rest of it

[57:49.040 --> 57:56.040]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words
[57:56.040 --> 58:03.040]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods
[58:03.040 --> 58:08.040]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension
[58:08.040 --> 58:14.040]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies
[58:14.040 --> 58:19.040]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLive.com, I couldn't do it
[58:19.040 --> 58:25.040]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality Methylcobalamin
[58:25.040 --> 58:29.040]  And double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12
[58:29.040 --> 58:35.040]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere
[58:35.040 --> 58:41.040]  It is amazing. Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution

[58:49.040 --> 58:53.040]  InfoWarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine
[58:53.040 --> 58:55.040]  Introducing pollen block
[58:55.040 --> 59:00.040]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[59:00.040 --> 59:07.040]  Including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function
[59:07.040 --> 59:12.040]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[59:12.040 --> 59:16.040]  Experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[59:16.040 --> 59:19.040]  They began studying this effect in published trials
[59:19.040 --> 59:22.040]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research
[59:22.040 --> 59:27.040]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[59:27.040 --> 59:32.040]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine
[59:32.040 --> 59:37.040]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase
[59:37.040 --> 59:42.040]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[59:42.040 --> 59:45.040]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[59:45.040 --> 59:50.040]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets
[59:53.040 --> 59:57.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:57.040 --> 01:00:04.040]  From the front lines of the Information War
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.040]  It's Alex Jones
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:13.040]  Rallies celebrating Trump's derangement syndrome were held nationwide
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:17.040]  As those calling for impeachment took to the streets to embrace the lies
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.040]  Being fed to them by their congressmen and the blatant bias of the mainstream media
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:26.040]  Here in LA and across the country, activists are urging House Democrats to start impeachment proceedings
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:31.040]  And they took their messages to the streets where Trump supporters, well, they were waiting for them
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.040]  Well, they were waiting for them
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.040]  We love our president. We think he's doing one heck of a great job
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:41.040]  It's no longer a question whether or not our president is a criminal
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.040]  We know that he is a criminal
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.040]  George Soros funded MoveOn.org was in full display nationwide
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.040]  The groups behind the protests are called MoveOn and by the people
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.040]  They organize support from dozens of smaller groups across the country
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.040]  Including Black Lives Matter here in New York
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.040]  MoveOn.org, which is simply a Democratic political action committee
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.040]  As all of their donations go directly to Democrats
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.040]  Continues to masquerade as American activism
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:12.040]  George Soros has dropped millions on MoveOn.org
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.040]  While donors like Daniel Tierney, representing Wicklow Capital
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:25.040]  Donated $666,666 in an apparent representation of satanic numerology
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:30.040]  Flying in the face of American Providence and foundational morality
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:35.040]  While Dustin Moskovich of the project organizing tool Asana
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:38.040]  Representing the totalitarian Silicon Valley Goliath
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.040]  Dropped $3 million on MoveOn.org in 2018
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:48.040]  Asana describes itself as a team that comes from many of the world's leading tech companies
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:53.040]  Including Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Dropbox
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.040]  Silicon Valley owns the Democrats
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.040]  Earlier this week Democrats in the US Congress
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:04.040]  Rather than address the carnage and impending disease entering the country
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:10.040]  Via the US border or the totalitarian attack on free speech by Silicon Valley
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.040]  Or even the homeless epidemic in their own districts
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:18.040]  Decided to continue their mob mental illness by pushing for impeachment
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.040]  He's unfit to be the president, he has no moral compass
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.040]  Regardless that the numerous investigations which found nothing
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.040]  Regarding President Trump and collusion with the Russians are essentially over
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.040]  Viewer discretion advised
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:38.040]  Anyone affected by watching mental patients wielding federal power should leave the room
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:43.040]  Volume 1 of the report outlines a sweeping as systemic effort by Russia to interfere
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.040]  In the 2016 election for the benefit of Donald Trump
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:50.040]  It establishes that the Trump campaign welcomed the Russian interference
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:55.040]  Because it expected to benefit electorally from information stolen
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.040]  And released through the Russian effort
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.040]  It shows how the Trump campaign built the theft and dumping of Russian stolen documents
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:05.040]  Into its campaign messaging and strategy
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:10.040]  And as special counsel made clear it sets out in great detail why the conduct in his report
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:13.040]  Should concern every American
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:20.040]  Finally the amendment finds that the president's assertion does not change the fact
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:27.040]  That the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce are sadly in contempt
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.040]  Oh how the tables have turned
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:35.040]  In 2017 former CIA director Brennan stated an open hearing in this committee
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.040]  That Russian active measures to impact U.S. had been going on for decades
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:47.040]  In 2012 then candidate for president Romney stated he believed Russia posed the greatest threat to the United States
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:52.040]  To which President Obama replied the 80s called they want their foreign policy back
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:58.040]  In 2014 then chairman now ranking member Nuna's warned of Russian maligned influence campaigns
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.040]  All of this acknowledgement of Russia and their intentions
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.040]  And yet no response from the Obama administration
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.040]  So there's a lot of conspiracy theories swirling around about Russia collusion
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.040]  So let's just add this one
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:15.040]  Is it possible that a group of politically motivated individuals
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:20.040]  At the highest echelons of national security decided to turn a blind eye to this activity
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.040]  Feeling that it would in fact enhance their candidates chances of winning
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:29.040]  The Democrats assembled us today to analyze the shoddy political hit piece known as the Mola Report
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:34.040]  It's written in the same spirit and with the same purpose as the Steele dossier
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.040]  Which was once championed by Democrats
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:41.040]  And now the Democrats with embedded leakers inside the White House for credibility
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.040]  Have made up the total line that we've been at war with Russia trying to take down their power grid for months
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:52.040]  And put it out without telling the president an attempt to create an international perhaps even military crisis
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:57.040]  Stay with us, we'll be right back in 60 seconds with the biggest news yet, I'm Alex Jones
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:01.040]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.040]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.040]  But it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower and sink in your home
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:13.040]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:20.040]  The Pro Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced four stage compact filtration system

[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:36.040]  And keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family

[01:05:52.040 --> 01:06:18.040]  It's time to go big and go home with the Pro Pure Whole House filtration system today
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:35.040]  I have undoubtedly never come in to do a broadcast and have this much insane news on the plate
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:42.040]  We're going to give the number out here in just a moment and take your calls on this main subject that I spent most of the last hour on
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.040]  For first time callers in the first round
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:52.040]  The New York Times comes out in a front page story Saturday that says the US has been at war with Russia for months
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:07:01.040]  A giant cyber attack that we offensively launched because they hacked into servers and flipped the election for Hillary at the voting machines
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:08.040]  No proof, that's a known lie, never one shred of evidence, the biggest part of the Russia hoax BS
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:15.040]  Trump comes out and says it's treason to say that we're at war and offensively attacking somebody
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:22.040]  You could start a huge war that way, it's electronic digital terrorism, cyber terrorism to do that
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.040]  We don't offensively attack people and it's not true
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:35.040]  Now he said that on Saturday and Sunday and almost no one even picked up what he said
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:40.040]  I learned about this the day after it happened because I tried to take at least a day off of my children
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:47.040]  And I couldn't believe it that even this morning they're still going with, yeah the Russians had submitted
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:56.040]  Pentagon says unnamed sources that they did steal the election for Trump, but we've struck back and we're inside their power grid
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:02.040]  Turning their nuclear power plants off, we're letting them know we can if we want to, but yeah they've had some power out of this
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:10.040]  And there's all these other giant power outages in Europe, Russia, Latin America, the biggest ever in South America
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:18.040]  And all of this is doctrine of Hillary Clinton saying that we should strike them because they struck our elections
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:25.040]  We should bring down their grid and of course even mainline pundits said that's war, that's insanity
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:30.040]  No one would do something like that, the Russians will respond, we don't have any proof they did it
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:38.040]  And a few years later now they're just in the New York Times saying it's happening
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:48.040]  This is a giant electronic false flag to destabilize the US and the world and to make Trump look like a fool and to start a giant war
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:53.040]  I said there's four ways they can bring down Trump and number one is a false war
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:09:00.040]  And sure I thought because Iran said hey we'll attack you and sink ships if you do sanctions, he was advised by Kerry to do that
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:04.040]  The Mula was, the Ayatollah
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:10.040]  And so I said that made them prime suspects, but then the evidence came out that it was false flag, even mainline analysts don't believe it
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:17.040]  And they believe it was being done by a third party or subgroup to again derail peace talks that Trump had going on
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:24.040]  With the Japanese prime minister who was sent there basically at Trump's behest to fix things
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:33.040]  We know the deep state, both Democrat and neocon globalists are sabotaging everything and this is an escalation to levels that I don't have words to describe
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:42.040]  I want to get your take particularly if you've been in the military, if you've been in cyber command, if you've been an international computer relations operations
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:47.040]  Is what I'm saying an exaggeration, I don't think so, I think it's worse than I'm saying
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:54.040]  And we'll go over all the articles about Stuxnet being Israel in the US and hitting Iranian nuclear processing centers
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:10:01.040]  And then getting into other power plants around the world and then we'll also get into how dangerous it is to load this software onto other systems
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:07.040]  Because then hackers are looking for exploits that can get into it, not knowing what it does and bring down their power plants
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:13.040]  You cut off power, they've got too much power to keep the nuclear reactors going, sending it down line
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:18.040]  It'll blow up all the transformers across the country, so you've got to turn the reactors off
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:24.040]  You can't turn most of the Russian reactors off, you can't turn most of ours off
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:32.040]  They say theoretically on paper you can, most of the blow ups on nuclear submarines and on aircraft carriers and believe me they've happened
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.040]  And at power stations has been when you turn the power off
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:44.040]  You understand, you can't just keep a nuclear reactor going, sending billions of volts down it
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:53.040]  And then there's nobody to take it, if the power stations get turned off and go dark, but reactors are still sending power out
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:59.040]  It blows up the transformer bases, you ever drive around see those big things look like science fiction
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.040]  All the big boxes and coils and wires, that's a distribution power center
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:11.040]  You turn power grids off, nuclear reactors blow up
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:16.040]  The Russians are still operating on Soviet made monstrosities
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:24.040]  Do you want a whole bunch of Chernobyl's? This is psychotic devilish demon possession by people in high levels of government
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:40.040]  Trump is not behind it, but he's sitting here pointing out and saying that it's treason by the New York Times
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:48.040]  The treason is the sources in government telling this line who used the national security window they're behind, the membrane they're behind
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:53.040]  To lie to everyone and put out this info
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:12:06.040]  I want to take your calls on this at 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex, 877-789-2539 on this topic
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:11.040]  There's no doubt this is a false flag, there's no doubt Russian systems are being attacked
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:18.040]  It's perfect for the deep state to hide behind their servers, to hide behind their secret systems that are designed to cover up the source
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:26.040]  Attack Russia, and when that doesn't get the response they want, they come out and say, yeah, Trump ordered us to attack Russia
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:32.040]  To destroy any chance of relations into the future, this is madness
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:40.040]  Especially with the Chai comms getting into an aggressive stance saying they're at war with the US in their major papers in the last month
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:49.040]  Russia is not expansionist, Russia is trying to stabilize itself, China is totally expansionist, in our business owns our debts, owns most of Hollywood
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:13:04.040]  And this is deep state globalists that are out live with China trying to start a war with Russia, a cyber war, an economic war, a physical hot war as a way to sabotage resources
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:10.040]  As a way to make Trump look bad, as a way to destroy nationalism and populism, and that's what Putin says
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:18.040]  He says, all this stirring up war with us has been to drain our resources and meant to make us collapse, we're cutting our defense budget, we're not fighting with you
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:22.040]  And he did it
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:31.040]  Their answer was to go ahead and announce this, Putin says we're the closest to nuclear war ever, this is so dangerous, there's the world to how much danger we're in
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:38.040]  And the next few days later, the New York Times puts out a huge story that is like something Emperor Palpatine would come up with
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:43.040]  Okay, this is so evil, here let's roll that Putin clip and I'll give you the subtitles
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:50.040]  If no one is interested, do it a little bit slower guys, back it up, start it over please
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:58.040]  Go ahead, if no one is interested in renewing the START 3 treaty, we will not renew it
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:03.040]  We will have already said a hundred times that we are ready to do so
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.040]  But no one is willing to talk about it with us
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:16.040]  Please know that there is no formal negotiating process and everything will expire in 2021
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:26.040]  Mind you, there will be no more instruments to limit an arms race, or for example deploying weapons in outer space
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:37.040]  Do you understand what this means or not? Ask the experts, it means that each of us, say under the nuclear weapon
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:43.040]  But we are doing this and doing it quickly
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:47.040]  Will anyone ever think about it?
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:53.040]  Talk about it or show any concern? No, complete silence
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:15:01.040]  Or take low yield nuclear weapons or non-nuclear strategic missiles
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:10.040]  What if a globally rain strategic missile is launched from a submarine in the middle of the ocean?
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.040]  How do we know? It only carries a non-nuclear charge
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:18.040]  Do you realize how serious and dangerous this is?
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:24.040]  Is Putin issuing an SOS to the world?
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:27.040]  I'm going to go to break and come back to your calls
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:32.040]  But this is out of control and it is treason
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:38.040]  Treason against life on earth, treason against humanity, madness, complete madness
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:42.040]  The Democratic Party has said we want war with Russia and national polls
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.040]  The average Democrat wants a nuclear war, they are totally insane
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:52.040]  They are all ready to die as long as Putin dies because he stopped their god Hillary
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:16:17.040]  Total insanity, they didn't Hillary stop herself
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:30.040]  We are now in the middle of a nuclear war
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:38.040]  We are in the middle of a nuclear war
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:50.040]  We are in the middle of a nuclear war

[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:02.200]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:07.320]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:14.160]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S.,
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:19.760]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:26.000]  with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:57.040]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:03.560]  Info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:09.280]  the last year or so. It's Orwellian. It's biblical. It's authoritarian. It's insane.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:16.200]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to stumble up on deck as the
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:21.760]  captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking. I've begged for your support before
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.480]  and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:31.560]  products and spread the word and keep fighting, info wars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:35.120]  And so we've reached that point. It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.800]  have withstood so many of their attacks. We've gone through so much because of your support.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.360]  You have you have been there, but let me tell you, they are pissed. They haven't been successful
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.800]  and they're giving us their full assault. So we need your prayers, your financial support
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:54.240]  and your word of mouth now and info wars.com. It's your fight. Decide whether or not you
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:20:01.520]  want info wars to continue because we could be shut down.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:23.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:28.280]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Don't forget info wars.com, news wars.com, president
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:32.680]  of dot com. That's our home. That's where you find us unfettered, our own audio, our
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:38.240]  own video streams, our own systems, our own crews, your funding, your support of our broadcast
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:43.840]  pays for all of that. And the deep platforming really hurt us because I spend millions and
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:50.000]  millions more a year streaming our own audio and video, which we already had as backup.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.120]  And so that's one of the crippling factors of the platforming is we have massive extra
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:21:00.240]  viewers and listeners on the sites themselves every day. I tried to accelerate it back when
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.520]  Matt dredge came here three years ago and warned us and said, Hey, I've talked to the
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:07.480]  top people, Supreme Court justices, they're coming with global deplatforming the next
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:11.680]  few years. You've got to accelerate people to your own platform. You've got to get off
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:16.520]  Facebook. You got to get off YouTube. You got to get off Twitter because they're electronic
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:23.200]  get us. Well, we tried. Everybody else didn't. They're all off the air. We have our own platform,
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:28.280]  not as big as we'd like, but it's here. Thanks to you. And after we take a few segments
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:35.600]  of calls, I'm going to get into what this global cryptocurrency means and how the setup
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:41.720]  worked. I'm not saying cryptocurrency is bad, but they always built them up, let them operate
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:46.920]  to then start restricting them and then they'll bring out the big kahuna that will become
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:52.880]  the global standard tied to your behavior. And I know high level Facebook people that
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:56.760]  told me two years ago, it's going to be a cult. If you're going to be on there, there'll
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:01.160]  be group managers that see all your stuff. You're going to have your banking on there.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.640]  And if you don't behave, it's going to be the global Chinese social score or like that
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:10.080]  black mirror episode is getting you ready for it. It'll be just like that. Well, Facebook
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:14.240]  has announced they're unveiling the mark of the beast global currency backed by governments
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:19.200]  and banks out of the gates and they're going to come after everybody else. So I'm more
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:23.480]  than ever want to support other crypto currencies, but you watch, it'll be them saying Facebook
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:32.760]  only unbelievable how protected and evil Facebook is was set up by the CIA and the NSA on record.
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:40.120]  Now imagine record number of African migrants coming to Mexican border AP into the US. We
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:45.640]  documented that drugs report link to it. Well, now there's video on local news Africans coming
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:53.520]  across southern border have rolls of hundreds up to $5,000 apiece. And they have debit cards
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:23:01.560]  from visa and mastercard with no name with thousands on them. Yes, they're being flown
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:08.520]  to Central America out of the Congo. And anywhere else, they're being paid with international
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:17.160]  money. How do you think everybody got into Europe? If you're a TV viewer, I am showing
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:23.880]  on screen George Soros admitting it all years ago. Then when I got bad last year, they had
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:30.880]  National News say Alex Jones is a liar. Conservative media is a liar. George Soros gives no undamaged
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:37.080]  cards. Of course, it's not his money. He gets it from the State Department keeps part of
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:44.200]  it and then gives it to you. So the State Department can get around funding human smuggling.
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:48.160]  Then when Trump sort of looking at it, they ran disinforced. Oh, no, no, we don't do that.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:55.360]  I'm going to show you all the proof coming up next hour. Box days, you know, pop in,
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:00.640]  we'll keep taking your phone calls. We have Dan Lyman of Europe Wars dot com on a bunch
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:04.360]  of huge developments in the last segment of this hour. But I'm going to go to your calls
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:08.920]  right now, ladies and gentlemen, just please remember, we have store wide free shipping,

[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:49.880]  It's all there info wars store dot com info wars live dot com or triple a two five three
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:55.320]  three one three nine. And it's still 33% off on the best selling space force, red, white
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:00.560]  and blue American flag shirt. That's so popular. I knew it would be popular. And so it is
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:05.840]  exploding. Everybody loves it. Perfect five star votes so far. This is the shirt we could
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:11.840]  get 100,000 of these on the street. We've already got 5000 out the door. I'd like to see a go
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.280]  chain reaction like the Hillary for present shirt. This is high quality, made in America
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.640]  super soft fabric, expensive to print like this. The shirt costs us nine bucks, the printing
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:26.040]  like a couple bucks. So when we sell it at 1995, that is a great deal. These shirts are
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:32.400]  normally 30 to $40 at the mall shirts that are made by the same manufacturer. You know,
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.600]  cost them 15 bucks, 12 bucks to make them. They're gonna, they're gonna, they're gonna
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.160]  want double triple markup. No, not us. Get the shirt, make it go viral. You're awesome.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:47.280]  Okay, let's stop there. Let's stop there. But imagine the cryptocurrencies. They can
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:52.000]  Facebook these multinationals and give money to anybody they want anybody to fly or anybody
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.560]  to come here. It's all just digital. They can pop it up and make millions a day use
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:01.640]  it as a weapon system. Well, you scrape and fight to live and even pay your bills. It's
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:07.800]  pure evil. It's the digital world government system. All right, Gary says he's an electrical
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:13.560]  engineer from Utah wants to talk about how big a deal this is with the announcement that
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:17.240]  we're at war with Russia. This is incredible. Tell us what you think, Gary.
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.040]  Hey, brother, how are you doing today? I'd ask you how you were doing, but if you're
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:26.880]  not nervous about what's going on today with the way things are going, I think you're just
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:32.280]  simply an idiot. Go ahead and say that again. You're a little bit over driven, a little
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:39.760]  bit, a little bit distorted there. Hold on a second. How do you, can you hear me now?
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:46.720]  Go ahead. Yeah, I just think that if you're not nervous about what's going on today and
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:54.360]  how things are going today with everything's electronic. I mean, everything's about data,
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:27:01.800]  how much data we can push. 5G makes me super, super nervous because of, I mean, I'm just
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:08.160]  nervous about all of it. I can tell you that I worked on the Bay Area Rapid Transit system
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:17.760]  on their data system. You talk about microwaves and stuff like that. Basically, you're in
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:27.400]  a sardine can when it comes to all the data systems that they're putting into little areas.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:32.080]  I mean, it wasn't even enough room to really engineer the stuff that was down there, but
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:40.360]  pretty crazy. At any rate, you're absolutely right with microwavable stuff. I believe that.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.320]  And I just can't believe that nobody is nervous about this.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:48.560]  Well, they're admitting that it's massively increasing cancers. And they just say that's
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:53.360]  just the way it is we're doing it. My big concern is saying we're at war with Russia,
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:56.920]  saying they've hacked us with no proof, saying we're planting stuff on their servers and
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:00.200]  trying to bring down their power grid. That's an act of war. And then the president comes
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:06.000]  out and says, this is illegal. Plus, we didn't do it. It's treason. What are you doing? Well,
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.160]  people in his administration are globalists like John Bolton. They are telling the New
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:16.120]  York Times this and they're trying to go to Russia into action. And it's insane. I've
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:19.960]  never seen anything like this. It's like what a supervillain would do. But it's all to try
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:22.960]  to derail this country. What do you think?
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:29.480]  I believe that. I believe that. I mean, when is America going to wake up and start doing
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:33.800]  something about it? I mean, I talk to people around me all the time about it. And it's
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.040]  like somebody else is going to take care of it for us. And that's just...
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:42.480]  Well, the good news is and the bad news is I agree. So many kids are dying per school
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:46.840]  that have a cell phone tower. Let me show you some of the dead and dying kids over here.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:49.760]  That it's all over the local news and parents are just threatening to take their kids out.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.960]  So it's all being ripped down. We're going to rip it all out. We're going to take it
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:57.080]  all out and bring in safe technology. 5G and all this is killing more people than cigarettes
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:02.640]  ever did. Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival

[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:10.800]  important message you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde here. I want to tell you about a huge sale
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:15.640]  with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:20.240]  endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:24.240]  flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding,
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:28.240]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:31.920]  it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:36.040]  unbelievable if you didn't know the flood waters backstory. So here's what you should
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:43.320]  do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com.

[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:35.200]  a story up on infowarstore.com from Japan today. Japan demands more proof from US that
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:41.880]  Iran attack tanker says they really haven't seen proof. They say a ship come up removing
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:47.120]  a mine. Why? How do you even know? Bill Scowles and I really respect. It's a lot of great
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:52.360]  contacts, really smart. He says it's a total false flag, but you didn't have Iran threatening
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:58.040]  to sink ships and straight away. If we put sanctions on them, all I know is the neocons,
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:02.880]  the globalist could stage this easily. We got a ton of amazing calls. Sam and Tyler
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:09.240]  and Kevin and Justin and Harry and all the other folks that have been holding. We're
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:13.520]  going to get to you in order. You've all got great points. I want to just bam, bam, bam,
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:20.320]  go through them. Let's go ahead and talk to Tyler in North Dakota. Tyler, thank you for
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:33.760]  calling today on this Monday edition. Welcome. Yeah, my big thing is that this issue gives
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:42.480]  them so many different angles. It gives them an angle to drum up war with Russia directly,
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.680]  but it also gives them an opportunity to do a false flag domestically and blame it on
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:53.520]  Russia as retaliation. Exactly. That's the big one is to say Russia already attacked
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:58.240]  this, stole the election for Trump with no proof, then say we've attacked them, giving
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:02.320]  them the green light. When you attack somebody, they get to attack back, but Russia's smart
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:07.800]  isn't doing it. But regardless, they'll now launch it and frame Russia. Yeah, that's what
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:14.600]  I'm concerned about, but I just think we have to push it out there as hard as we can and
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:19.200]  give as much attention on it as possible. I agree with you. How insane does the deep
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:25.280]  embedded state have to be to say we're attacking Russia when we really aren't knowing it takes
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:30.760]  to our moral high ground? I mean, they're just not following the normal rules of engagement.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:36.400]  People have rules of engagement because you end up having giant wars when you don't. It's
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:43.800]  just why do you think they're doing this? Well, you know, I think the same reason they
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:50.600]  were going after Syria so hard is because it's the Russian, Russia, Syria, Iran, they're
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:56.240]  all they're all linked together and you know, Russia's the big cherry on top that they want
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:01.120]  to want to get in line, you know, they want to they want to take them down militarily
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:05.760]  and they want to push them into the EU, which, you know, EU is falling apart, but it's you
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.760]  know, that's it. That's it. And not going to give up. And meanwhile, there's a big group
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:12.840]  of globalists that don't like the fact that America is waking up dealing with China, who's
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:17.480]  the big threat. And so we can get off in a fight with Russia. Then that's a good distraction
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:23.360]  for the Chinese to go ahead and take over. Right, right. You know, I would just, you
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:28.720]  know, I don't know who is responsible for this or if there's any way, you know, I think
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:35.040]  it would be more effective at this point. Instead of worrying about getting John Brennan
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:41.440]  in prison or getting any of the deep staters that are acting along with the Democrats is
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:46.200]  to arrest somebody within his own administration that he knows is acting against him. To I
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:51.200]  think that would really make a big point to the American public about how how corrupt
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:56.400]  the government is. It's not just it's not just the Democrats and and the CIA. It's people
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:02.000]  that he is appointed. Absolutely. And they don't have respect for him. They talk about
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.200]  it right behind his back. And again, because he came into the swamp and he's tried to work
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:12.120]  with people. Thank you so much, Tyler. Amazing call. Incredible insights. That's the next
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:16.520]  issue Kevin wanted to raise from Long Island. Kevin there in Long Island. Why does Trump
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:20.200]  allow the leaks to continue? Well, let me tell you, I got 100 crew members, about 100.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:25.480]  It varies sometimes 98, sometimes 101. That's always kind of our peak. We got crude, you
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:29.560]  know, doing everything. We got our own janitor, got our own legal, got our own accounting,
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:33.880]  got our own researchers, got our own camera people, got our own switchers, got our own
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:39.040]  producers. There's a lot of folks that go into this, got our own IT, three guys. And
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:43.040]  we do a lot for media operation that reaches this many. Normally, we would have a $300
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.800]  million budget a year. We'd have a fraction of that. You probably have 600 employees.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:51.880]  But we've got about 100. If my crew didn't like me and we didn't put up with me and didn't
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.000]  work really hard, we'd get nothing done. Trump's got tens of thousands of employees
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.280]  outside the military. And so if they lie to his face and take paper's office desk, and
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:06.400]  it's called mutiny, you can have the best captain in the world on a ship. If everybody
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:11.600]  on the ship says FU, ship's not going anywhere. They'll just throw the captain overboard.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.920]  So it kind of comes down to we the people. Does that answer your question, Kevin, or
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:17.960]  were you begging the question? Do you have the answer? What do you think Trump should
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.200]  do? I think the last caller's right. Let's arrest some of these bastards. Let these pieces
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:26.680]  of crap. Make them walk the plank, man, that are doing this kind of crap. Startin' a war
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:31.520]  with Russia, lying about it, saying we've attacked Russia. They're damn power plants.
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:42.240]  It's insane. Go ahead. I just can't believe it. I don't get it. Let me ask it this way.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:45.640]  Let me ask it this way. This is what I'm going to start the show with and I didn't do it.
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:51.200]  What would we do if Russia said we're attacking your power plants and putting stuff in there
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:56.120]  to make a malfunction, including your nuclear power plants? If Putin came out and said that,
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:02.040]  I'd say it's time to go to war. But of course, Putin wouldn't do that. What the hell is going
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:07.880]  on in our damn government? They are a damn threat. I'm serious, man. We need the deep
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:13.120]  state hauled out of there now. They are crazy. Sorry. Go ahead.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:18.200]  I'm in the same boat. I just can't believe what's going on. I don't understand why this
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:24.680]  president is just firing all these people. Does he need men like me? He must. It's funny.
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:35.200]  They call me the captain, okay? I was born in 65. I just can't believe it. What happened
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.320]  to our country? What's going on with all these people?
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:41.520]  Sir, evil. You know about the neocons. They were Trotskyites that Stalin kicked out. They
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:45.000]  went down to Mexico. They came up here and then they funded national review and all of
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.160]  it. And they said we're no longer communists. We're a cult of power. They were brainwashed
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:55.400]  at the Chicago Business School by Strauss, the economist. And they all said Hitler wasn't
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:40:01.600]  bad. He didn't target everybody. We control reality. We're going to take over, but they're
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:08.480]  not Nazis. They just believe in power. And so they believe in ruling the earth through
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:13.280]  the United States and just starting wars. They believe they're invincible. It's called
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:18.800]  megalomania. We have a group of megalomaniacs in the government. They've now converted Democrats
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:26.400]  to be like them. So what does that tell you? Everyone's becoming victims of the deep state.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:32.640]  It's time to turn this crap around and hold people accountable and start punishing them.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:37.000]  I hear you. What do you think would happen? Let me ask you this. In fact, I should ask
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.840]  all the callers. What would happen if Putin came out and said we've been attacking your
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:45.960]  power plants and putting malware on them to bring your power grid down? What would Americans
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:51.840]  say? Of course, the New York Times for Trump said Trump's doing that. Think of the sabotage.
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:57.080]  But what would we do if the Russians announced this?
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:03.000]  I'm sure we'd attack them or something. You know, everyone's got to take a deep breath
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.840]  and start wondering what's true and what's not. Because there's so much disinformation
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:14.840]  and information out there. And a lot of people in the dark are still listening to this crap
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:21.840]  that the fake news is spitting out. And it's just getting crazier and crazier. Something's
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:25.360]  going to happen.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.200]  You're absolutely right, brother. I mean, I have four children. I love life. And I've
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:33.560]  never I've read a lot of history books. I've had thousands of guests on that are experts.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:38.440]  I've never seen anything like it where the New York Times says we've been told by Trump
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:42.720]  administration officials that he's been in a two month cyber war shutting down stuff
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:46.800]  and planting stuff on their power plants. And then of course, it's not even true. Of
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:53.080]  course, it's insane. But if you did it, you wouldn't tell anybody because now the Russians
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:57.960]  can find the proof that you just admitted to this international crime or hackers know
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:03.520]  about the exploit. They're going to get into it. It's like it's like handing the nuclear
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:10.660]  button to a monkey and then putting a candy on top of the button or tell the monkey a
[01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:15.400]  trained monkey, push the red button, you get a candy. And then the monkey goes over and
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:21.400]  pushes the button. It's insanity. This is if Satan was running the government, this
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:26.080]  is what you would say. No, it's the New York Times, the Democrats and the neocons. And
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:32.760]  let me tell you about like, like, like, like the Prince of Darkness is what he's called
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:38.440]  one of these top neocons, Richard Pearl. He literally has big black circles around his
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:42.520]  eyes. Looks like a vampire as white skin. He would walk over to women at cocktail parties
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:48.320]  and go, I have power. I kill a lot of people. I run all the wars. And they go, Oh, you go,
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:54.640]  what? I kill people like I'm a killer. They're just like, Oh, they have no humanity. They're
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:56.120]  mentally retarded.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:06.040]  The most banned network in the world. Tom and Texas police officer on the border talks

[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:27.080]  stickers in my glove box right now. I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:30.560]  to help spread that word. You're our only hope, brother. I'm telling you, you're more
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:34.160]  important than I am. It's people like you on the ground as you know, that's boots on
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:35.160]  the ground.

[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:08.720]  the last year or so. It's it's it's Orwellian. It's it's biblical. It's it's authoritarian.
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:15.120]  It's insane. And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:20.760]  up on deck as the captain of this operation and say, Hey, we're sinking. I've begged for
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:24.560]  your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat. But this is the real SOS if you

[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:04.160]  Mike in New Jersey. You're on the air. Thanks for calling Mike. You are the man, Alex. I'm
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:08.480]  so glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan. Ever since I've been listening,
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:13.760]  I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for the bone broth. The bone broth.
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:17.840]  The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth.
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:22.880]  Tastes like tastes like great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to milk, it tastes
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:29.040]  like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. Like good. I feel
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:34.840]  great since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride free toothpaste.
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:39.480]  I'd use the super male vitality, a host of other products. So thank you so much for
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:41.960]  that as well. Brother, you're thanking me for buying the
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:45.600]  products and keeping us on air. I'm thanking you. But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:51.080]  formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom, the true bone broth. It is next level. It
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:47:01.520]  really is good. So thank you. I feel great since I've been taking it. Thank you.
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:16.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:25.120]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:34.560]  If you've just joined us, I'm Alex Jones, your host. I'm going to continue with your
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:41.320]  phone calls into the next hour. I want to get Dan Lyman to pop in who heads up europewars.com
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:45.640]  at least for a segment because I'm seeing announcements that the yellow vest after seven
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.920]  months of demonstrations that have brought the corrupt French globalist government to
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:55.360]  its knees is hanging up their vest. Is that true? Is it victory? Is it defeat? What does
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:03.160]  it signify? And then all the accelerated news stories about the Islamist bombing churches
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:09.800]  and burning things down and raping people and shooting them. That's all over europewars.com.
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:15.480]  And then I had a French TV crew here and I see it on national news everywhere when they
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:22.000]  were attacking me with Sundar Pichai. It's like, well, there's people like Paul Watson
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.640]  who says that maybe Notre Dame was Islamic. They won't say what it is. So now it's a thought
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:31.840]  crime when Islamists have tried to burn it down several times have been caught and the
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.560]  builders of it that recently renovated say you can't burn it with, you know, the way
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:41.400]  we saw without thousands of gallons of gasoline, you're not supposed to look at that. It's
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:46.840]  just crazy. And we see Merkel voted out of office still in office because of a parliamentary
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:53.080]  procedure. We see may voted out. I mean, how would you describe Europe fully awake? Europe
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:58.840]  in revolution, the globalist in retreat doing a rearguard action with new floods of Islamists
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:05.480]  funded with government paid credit cards, debit cards to come into the nations. How
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:10.640]  would you describe Dan Lyman with an update on the period of history we're in right now?
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:14.280]  A little bit of everything, Alex is definitely a period of turmoil in Europe. And it of course
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:19.680]  depends on which country you're looking at and the state of affairs in each country.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:23.880]  Of course, things are definitely crazier in Western Europe than they are in Eastern Europe.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:28.160]  And we've seen so much so much in the in the way of the rise of populism and nationalism
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:33.480]  across Europe in the on the electoral front, of course. But yeah, they're still flooding
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:39.000]  the country and the continent with with migrants. I see more and more every day just in the
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.840]  area that I live in in Switzerland, I can't even imagine what it's like in some of these
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.520]  other countries. And we see more and more the crimes that are being committed and also
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:52.280]  the crimes that are being covered up by the police, by the federal governments and by
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:57.440]  the EU as well. So it's it's you can feel things are speeding up, but at the same time,
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:01.440]  they're doing their best to keep a lid on it because people have really caught on and
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:05.200]  they're really punishing them at the at the voting booth.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:09.760]  Then the UN admits the master plan, but for new listeners that don't know about all the
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:13.720]  official UN documents about Europe and the US, why don't you, while we roll some of the
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:17.880]  shocking footage, tell people what the admitted plan is.
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:21.920]  Well I think one really interesting clue is, of course, we just saw today because we see
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:27.680]  parallel things playing out in North America and also in Europe, a very similar situation.
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:31.720]  And there was a very telling story that was up on Drudge that the African migrants that
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:36.440]  are pouring into now the United States are being found to have wads of hundred dollar
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:43.200]  bills on them. Now that goes in line with these UN issued credit cards, EU issued credit
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.320]  cards, debit cards, I should say, that are also given to the migrants. It's been uncovered
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:52.040]  that millions upon millions of dollars being given to them in the digital form. And then
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:56.560]  also not too long ago, there was a situation where there was a migrant ship that was stuck
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:01.520]  out in the Mediterranean for a while. One of these NGO vessels that was denied entry
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:07.240]  to Italy, eventually they did dock in Spain. They were welcomed into the port of Valencia.
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:10.920]  And there were people on the ground there who were reporting that migrants had wads
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:15.600]  of hundred euros bills and that they were spending them liberally at the bars there.
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:20.640]  So first of all, we can we can know pretty with pretty much certainty that they are
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:26.120]  being given loads of money, whether it's digital or cash and also that a lot of them are coming
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:29.880]  with their own money. These are not the bottom of the barrel migrants.
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:35.200]  This is the this is the brain drain. And they're going to create anchors to bring in more families
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:38.800]  that they even had a Congonese family admitting that, oh, we're bringing our middle class
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:42.480]  over. And so we're here to get all the free stuff. And they go on the news and admit this.
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:46.920]  And since you mentioned that Soros came out three years ago was on the cover Reuters website
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:51.040]  saying, oh, yeah, I give the migrants money via credit cards or debit cards with no name
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:56.480]  on them. Well, he gets US and EU money. Then then he gives it towards human smuggling.
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:00.200]  So you're absolutely right. That's why they're being paid thousands and thousands of dollars
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:04.520]  for every leg of the trip. So they have a lot of money once they get here, because it
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:07.920]  needs to be a reward. Remember when they did five years ago flooding Europe, they said
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:12.800]  the women are there free housing, jobs, free welfare. And some of them get there and there's
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:16.880]  not all the free stuff. Remember, they got pissed. They would say, I want the money. We've
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:21.840]  got these videos in English. They knew it. They say, give me money. Give me bitch. I
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:28.280]  want your woman's unit. And they start saying, give me their ass. Give me money. I kill you.
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:32.600]  So once the money runs out, the real meltdown starts. Since you mentioned it, here's a minute
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:38.600]  of that video that's up on drugs report.com. It's also up on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:43.000]  Get it out folks. Record number of African migrants coming to the Mexican border into
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:49.320]  the U.S. Africans coming across border have rolls of $100 bills. Here it is. What I found
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:54.800]  out is through an aid worker there, he said they actually do have money, quite a few of
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:59.880]  them, because he spotted them under a tree right in front of the shelter, counting their
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:05.080]  a roll of money with $100 bills. And he spotted them and they just put it back in the pocket.
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:08.640]  He didn't take it away of them, of course, but they're still hanging there and waiting
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:13.360]  for, you know, public help. Where did they expect to be going? Did they have friends
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:18.920]  or family here? They want to go. There's about three dozens left now of that 250 group and
[01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:25.440]  they all want to go to Portland, Maine. The Congo and other African countries are being
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:32.680]  basically, they're repopulating Portland, Maine with a huge contingent of these immigrants,
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:36.920]  these migrants. And it's overwhelming the main authorities. I mean, they're pretty
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:40.440]  liberal up there. They're like, we can't take any more people. We're full up. But they're
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:44.800]  hoping to go there. They're hoping and they're told they conquered there and they're told
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:48.920]  that I was told that there's no solution anytime soon for them.
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:54.040]  So rolls of $100 bills. And then once they get here, the Democrats manage them, put them
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:57.760]  on welfare, skim part of it, and then put them into an underground economy. So this
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:03.640]  is a total political takeover. And then the Democrats what in New York and in LA have
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:08.160]  now legalized giving drivers license to illegal aliens to vote. And they're saying we want
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:13.040]  illegal aliens to vote. So that's the plan. Import voters and a new slave class you control
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:14.040]  down lineman.
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:20.080]  Absolutely. This is a massive money laundering operation as you're hinting at here. There
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:25.400]  is so much money being exchanged or so much money going to these NGOs. It's pouring through
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:29.360]  this entire human trafficking operation. We just had an interesting article which is
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:35.440]  published on news wars last week. Senator Lindsey Graham was in a house test. I'm sorry,
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:40.240]  Senate testimony with the acting Homeland Security chief. And Senator Graham actually
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:45.880]  pulled up basically a breakdown, a price breakdown of what people are paying to the human smugglers
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:49.360]  that are bringing them into the into North America. And of course, this is going to be
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:52.520]  the same thing that's happening in Europe. But he was basically saying it's almost like
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:57.400]  a menu. So if you want to go in just the cheapest way possible, where you're going to walk most
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:00.320]  of the way and you're just going to walk your way across the border, it's going to cost
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:06.080]  you for instance, eight to $16,000. That was a 2017 prices. However, if you have a little
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:10.000]  bit more to spend and you want to come buy a boat, it's a little bit more. If you want
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.200]  to come by plane, it's a little bit more. And as we know, a lot of these migrants are
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:17.960]  actually being brought into Europe on planes and they're being brought in on boats. There's
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:20.880]  all different ways they come in. They can come in through the Balkans. They can walk
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:26.080]  their way up. So I would imagine that there are similar price menus for those who can
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:31.120]  afford certain ways to get in. And they're coming from all over the world and then using
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:34.840]  basically the North of Africa as a jump off. That's right. Let's be clear. When I saw those
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:40.160]  Congonies, thousands are coming in on hundreds. They were wearing big gold chains that were
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:46.400]  real, big earrings, the clothing. That's the upper class coming here as colonists with
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:50.680]  the deals to get free deals as the chain migration to bring in their families. And that they
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:54.400]  admitted they say, we're here to colonize you. We hear it's all free. And so they're
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:56:00.800]  on video saying this. It's pretty amazing. Exactly. If you recall the terrorist in New
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:06.040]  York City who mowed down a bunch of people there, the Uzbek terrorist, he had a chain
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:10.800]  migration. He was responsible for between 20 and 25 relatives that he had brought in.
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:15.040]  He was the anchor. So we're looking at thousands upon thousands upon hundreds of thousands
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:19.160]  pouring into the US, but they're just the first wave. They're going to bring in their
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:24.200]  folks once they get approval to stay there. And we're looking at millions upon millions.
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.840]  It's a multiplying effect. And that same situation, of course, is happening here in Europe and
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:34.280]  not on top of that, especially with a lot of the African migrants. They do repopulate
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:40.240]  very quickly and very fast and very healthily. So I mean, we're looking at just a total demographic
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:43.680]  wave, a dominance of the Western countries that are being exploited.
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:47.320]  And when the folks are brought in, they're politically have a chip on their shoulder.
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:51.520]  They're taught to hate America. They're taught the Democrats are your God. And their tribal,
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:55.360]  they understand they get in that tribe. The tribe takes care of me. I take care of them.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:00.160]  And there's an incredible swagger and arrogance. Minnesota, the new ruling class is Somalis.
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:03.720]  I've been there and had them just randomly call me names and laugh and say, you want to
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:08.680]  get stabbed, bitch? I kill you. And that's why I'm like, Hey, screw you, man. And Somalis
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:12.280]  see me all over, get my face on the street. They're like, you're going to get it to you,
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:17.560]  American. I wish I was in Somalia. We have interviews are like, I hate this country. It's
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:23.200]  like God almighty. Well, then go back to Somalia. Holy hell. And by the way, I have videos.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:26.200]  It's black folks that are mainly flipping out about all the Africans being brought in
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:30.400]  because they're so tribal. You think Africans like other Africans, they're super tribal in
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:36.200]  Africa folks. And this is a recipe for disaster. If I speak in the devil, I'm going to play
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:42.080]  a clip of a call to prayer shot in Brooklyn just a few weeks ago, and it's a black American
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:45.840]  freaking out over the Islamic takeover. And then I'll go to all your calls. I promise
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:52.640]  Sam, Justin, here. Shut down our speech. We're at info wars.com and news wars.com and

[01:59:51.040 --> 02:00:07.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:24.400]  So the globalists have been exploiting the third world and suppressing it in their own
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:29.400]  admissions for decades. Now they've weaponized it, made it politically correct, are paying
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:33.560]  those people to come here not to be absorbed but to hate the country. And the folks really
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:37.640]  love it. I meant to get this on Friday. We're going to repost it to the front page of info
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:43.000]  wars and I'm going to telegram it out on telegram. There's a telegraph. We've already
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.080]  got like 9,000 followers. I haven't really plugged our telegram or telegraph account.
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:52.320]  Can we go to info wars.com? I'll show you on the front page. There's a little blue triangle
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:57.920]  right under the watch live triangle or listen live triangle. You click that. It's telegraph.
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:04.200]  The point is it's an open free Twitter. Got like 300 million users now. And it's the way
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:07.560]  to go. See it right over there where it says Alex Jones show up on the top. We'll just
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:12.560]  take our time here where it says the Alex Jones radio show. You see that right up there
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:17.560]  in the top right hand corner, bigger than Dallas, Texas. You see, you see where it says
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:21.760]  listen now that blue triangle. We'll look right down below it. There's another blue triangle
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:25.560]  right there. And if you click on that, I want to click on it so I can tell people the name
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:32.560]  because I'm not on teleprompter free. It takes you to this organization. And so my question
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:36.080]  begging for help in my ear. I don't have a teleprompter, but I do beg for stuff on air
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:43.160]  sometimes the name of is it telegram or tell telegram. And then what's the URL for it?
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:47.800]  I want to tell people how to go there. It's going to keep going. Just click home on it.
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:51.160]  It's going to keep growing, keep rolling because I've been meaning to plug this for weeks and
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:56.960]  I haven't. But I am now know I meant go to the home page on telegram. It's going to keep
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:03.800]  rolling, rolling, rolling. I think it's like T something dot me. There it is. And then
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:08.240]  what's the URL? Because this little happy camper wants to give people the URL on radio
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:15.000]  because only a fraction of our viewers are on television. Well, maybe next time. My eyes
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:21.360]  aren't that good. But hopefully yours out in cyberspace are. But there you go, ladies
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:26.000]  and gentlemen. Dan Lyman, here is the video of a call to prayer. Now, if you were playing
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.600]  a Christian call to prayer at any decimal near this, they would shut it down like Jesus
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:34.120]  Christ is your Lord, the Savior, only Lord, Savior, you're going to hell if you don't
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:38.640]  go with Jesus Christ. People get mad at street preachers screaming at their regular audible.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:42.760]  But but Islamists, people don't know in Europe living there in closing. People don't know
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:49.120]  that in Europe that this is this in all the world. It's a sign of domination, isn't it?
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:53.360]  Absolutely. Anywhere in the world that they congregate in this manner, we just had the
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:03:00.720]  end of Ramadan in Birmingham, Birmingham, UK, just one city over 100,000 turned out to
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:05.800]  the park to mark the end of Ramadan. That's just one UK city. And these things are happening
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:10.760]  across. I mean, you can see these videos in Los Angeles and London in Berlin in Stockholm.
[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:15.640]  You can this is the same situation is playing out everywhere. And if you recall also in Brooklyn,
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:21.080]  they recently just launched that Sharia patrol where the cars look just like NYPD vehicles.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:26.000]  So things are a foot in Brooklyn that we probably want to look more into.
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:31.240]  Well, Dan, I really appreciate you. We're going to have you back soon. Europe Wars.com.
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:37.160]  God bless you. Cheers. Now, I didn't get time to play this because I went off on a Jag
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:43.840]  about Telegram, but it's t.me. And there's a whole bunch of platforms popping up to counter
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:47.880]  Twitter and Facebook and Google and all of it. I think Paul's up like 50,000 on there.
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:52.440]  Tommy Robinson, even more. I haven't plugged it on the show, but the easiest things go
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:04:00.760]  to M4Wars.com up at the top of the site. Right there. You can click on that little blue triangle
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:05.520]  under the listen now, and it will take you there where you can sign up and follow us
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:09.560]  there. And it's got video, got a lot of other great functions. So hopefully you'll join
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:13.400]  it. Really what it is is a paper airplane, a lot better than a little bird. Oh, it doesn't
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:19.080]  spy on you. It's not politically correct. We really like it. So there you go, ladies
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:23.280]  and gentlemen, the big plug for Telegram, which I did kind of screwed up way because
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:28.080]  I wasn't planning it. I just went to, I keep planning to plan it and I never get around
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:32.800]  to planning it. So it's better to go off half cock than never go off. Don't you agree? Better
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:38.400]  to blast the enemy with torpedoes, even if you miss. It still makes for nice fireworks
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:42.760]  off in the distance. Maybe you blow up a fishing boat or something. I'm being sarcastic. We'll
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:48.160]  be right back on the other side. I'm Alex Jones with newswars.com and infowars.com.
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:05:05.720]  So the info wars model is a self fulfilling, self supporting structure that is promoting
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:10.640]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:16.280]  one another. It is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach.
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:21.040]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self supporting, self sustaining,
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:25.280]  self structured, little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:29.640]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:33.440]  and supporting info wars. And it's all because the audience spends there, whatever it is,
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:37.840]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually
[02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:42.600]  compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that. And at the same time,
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:46.840]  our press supports speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to
[02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:51.120]  see and what views they want to hold. And it's the ultimate American democratic expression
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:56.120]  and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[02:05:56.120 --> 02:06:21.800]  All right, let me go right back to your phone calls and first tub on the insanity on the
[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:27.520]  craziness that's taking place with our own government rogue elements saying that we've
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:33.400]  launched an attack, ladies and gentlemen, on the Russians because they attacked us. None
[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:37.960]  of it's true. Trump says it's not true. There's no proof. But have we really launched an attack
[02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:45.040]  to then blame Trump by we, the criminals that have hijacked our nation, Sam, and Justin
[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:48.640]  and everybody you've been holding patiently. Thanks for calling Sam in Arizona. What do
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:58.320]  you think's happening? Alex? Yes, sir. Before I get to my point of we're overdue for American
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:07.840]  Chernobyl. I want to call you out as a coward. You are a coward not to allow this one listener
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:15.560]  to come on and express his opinion about the Rapture Bible Dan. He deserved to come on
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:21.520]  the show and put the guy on hold. But sir, you are Bible Dan. And we have an open phones
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:26.920]  about the the the the cyber attack on Russia that they say happened that Trump says we
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:31.480]  didn't do that's criminal if we did that could start a giant war. And then you're calling
[02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:36.520]  in because I've debated whether there's a pre or post Rapture. And that's not how talk
[02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:41.120]  radio works, sir. That's not how talk radio works. I got I got to let you go, Sam. I'm
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:46.720]  not a coward. You call in all the shows and you disagree on the Rapture. And if we ever
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:50.280]  are having a Rapture show, that'd be a good show to have about that the mark of the beast
[02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:56.240]  and all this, then you should call in or you could have called in. I said first time callers
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:02.800]  you lied to get on air. That's not very Christian. Justin in New York, Justin, you're on the
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:11.320]  air. Welcome. Hello there. I welcome outside. A great fan. I've been listening since 2016.
[02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:16.920]  Thank you, sir. Really concerned about the whole deep state, essentially just acting
[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:23.520]  on the whole rebelling. Like, they're just confident that's like, Trump couldn't even
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:30.800]  get Brennan to get his like security clearance removed. But there's nothing going ahead with
[02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:36.200]  the war that Hillary wanted now. Yes, Hillary wanted a cyber war with the Russians with
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:40.480]  her lie that we were attacked by the Russians with no proof that they they stole the election
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:45.320]  and voting machines totally made up. 80% of the bots in the election out of Russia that
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:51.520]  continentally were Democrat bought. Anybody can hire firms in Russia to do stuff. This
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:55.760]  is a geographically comes from there doesn't mean it's the government. But 80% was Hillary
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:09:02.080]  because she had 80% of the money in the campaign. And Michael Moore showed up at Russian events
[02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:07.920]  that were Russian sponsored by bots against Trump. So again, none of it's true. You don't
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:12.600]  know what to believe. Now they're saying this. It's crazy, Justin. I appreciate your call.
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:19.040]  Is there any points you want to make? Now, what does Trump do to rectify it? So like,
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:25.040]  how does he was his next step? Essentially, like, does he just get a trail? The military
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:31.360]  is just a mass arrest, the bureaucracy that's increasing. I appreciate your call. That's
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:36.560]  that that's where we are. We already see that's a form of martial law. But we're already under
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:41.800]  martial law. We have rogue government operating however it wants whenever it wants and trying
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:45.600]  to start wars. This is incredibly dangerous. Thank you, Justin. Great questions. Great
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:53.080]  points. Let's go ahead and take another call. There's been holding the longest year. Let's
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:59.200]  go to Preston. Preston in Missouri says the deep state needs to be contained. What do
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:07.120]  I agree with you, Preston? Yeah, I was wondering, not only about the New York Times, Tucson,
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:14.880]  Russia, but really all the state or the media have to do is create a false private obvious
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:23.200]  thinker, you know, cereal and, you know, making obvious to some space because we are a wake
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:29.000]  to these false flags, push hard with an official story and narrative through the press. And
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:36.920]  they will either drive a wedge between Trump and Intel communities or something is based.
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:41.760]  It's one of the two. Well, here's the problem. They built the whole NSA spy grid to cover
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:46.000]  the tracks of people doing illegal things inside of it was built by criminals. I've had the
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:54.520]  former head of the NSA technical explain that. I started in the 90s and so a very small group
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:59.440]  of mutineers can make it look like the whole US government's doing this. They were probably
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:04.520]  were attacking Russia. Then they took credit for it. So Russia has to act to start a fight.
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:09.160]  It's just incredibly bold when you do attack somebody in a covert operation to take credit
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:13.520]  for it, whether it's true or not. And then obviously Trump doesn't know it went on. This
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:18.120]  is an incredible example of sabotage. Like I said, I want the Venezuelan dictator out
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:23.720]  of there, but Trump would get sabotage like Bay of Pigs by the neocons. If he tried to
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:29.120]  do it, you can bet they would sabotage it. So if you learn one thing about these globalists,
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:34.320]  they operate the same over and over and over again, because they want to exercise power
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:40.360]  in a raw way and they want to overwhelm the will of the people. Does that make sense?
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:44.200]  It does. But look what they do with Syria where Trump was forced to do the airstrike
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:48.760]  and I was with you. I was so proud of you in that moment where you were, you had your
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:52.560]  condition. We knew it was a false flood. We knew they were pushing it with Obama's red
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:58.040]  line speech in Trump. We don't think he fell for it. He bombed an empty airfield. Nobody
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:02.680]  really got hurt. I think maybe one military person from Syria did get killed, but Trump
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:08.200]  did something of low damage, maybe to appease the base, but you said Trump on air. And I
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:12.480]  was proud of you in that moment because at one point the neocons were able to deceive
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:16.200]  Trump and he was going along, but we never know whether or not Trump is trying to play
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:20.800]  the middle game. He's trying to, to keep his enemies close and his friends close and
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:24.360]  nothing is closer. He did. You want these people around. They give them themselves.
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:31.720]  You know, you know, you know, you callers are all amazing, but Joe Rogan had a joke
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:36.880]  like 20 years ago about it's the year 2000. And by then we were supposed to be flying
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:42.800]  around on silver jet packs, but now I step behind a bush and my cell phone craps out.
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:47.080]  It's like these cell phones. I think it's the longer you hold to it, like downgrades
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:51.920]  the quality or whatever. Yeah, but it's just like these calls. Thank you so much. I have
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:56.120]  to focus to hear what you're saying. And when I finally hear what you're saying, it's really
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:01.600]  smart Preston. Thank you so much. Let's see if this other callers got any quality at
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:06.560]  all. Let's see a Brighton in Texas is intelligible. By the way, folks, when you can call it on
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:11.280]  landlines, they're so good. They're so beautiful. They're so crisp. Kind of example, how newer
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:15.480]  technology isn't necessarily better, right? Brighton in Texas. Thanks for holding.
[02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:23.480]  Hi, Mr. Jones is very happy for having me on. Thanks. So what, what I was going to talk
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:29.160]  about is how you're not your book, but the book that you recommended, none there call
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:34.720]  a conspiracy. Yes. How it's relating to everything that's happening right now, especially with
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:40.920]  the cyber and space and security and how our governments line to us and stuff like that.
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:47.880]  I totally agree. Give us your take. Um, so like, um, I'm not sure if it's on info war
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:54.240]  store right now, but the movie, uh, America and all that is relating to what's going on
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:58.880]  about, you know, the government's been lying to us and with everything with the blackout
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:03.440]  and everything. I mean, I mean, it's going to be the next step for, you know, America,
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:08.040]  like the, you know, MP and all that going to hit or what, you know, because our country
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:12.560]  is just going so downhill, you know, and almost I'm 16. So, you know, being a young
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:18.000]  American, I'm worried about these things. Well, now that you say it, I mean, it just,
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:22.320]  it just, it just really makes me worry about my children because the world is just accelerating
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:26.720]  towards a crazier and crazier and crazier and more out of control place. And again, from
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:30.880]  the doctrines of war, the doctrines of being the good guys from any angle, you slice it.
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:34.400]  It's got neocon written all over it, but now the Democrats are basically neocons that say
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:39.000]  they just want war period. The neocons say we're God, we're in America, we're going to
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.800]  start wars, but they're not America. They're globalists that want to get rid of America.
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:49.640]  And then they say they attacked Russia. And so now Russia can attack us. They're trying
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:55.400]  to start a war. It's insane. What would we do if Russia came out and said we've broken
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:15:01.280]  into your stuff or trying to bring down your power plants and planted viruses all over you?
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:07.000]  We would get so mad at Russia. But see, imagine if the Russian government said we've planted
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.640]  stuff on your servers, we're trying to bring you down and crash your power grid. And then
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:16.720]  Putin said that's not true. You'd go, oh my gosh, that government's in shambles. That
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:21.000]  country is super dangerous. That country's out of control. And it's when it's when things
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:26.560]  are that confusing that we could get a nuclear war that much easier. This is a global total
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:31.920]  insane asylum crisis. And Trump must get control of the government. It's not his fault. They're
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:36.800]  traders and criminals, but he must take action against them. The people that have done this
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:42.640]  seem to be identified and they need to get in big trouble now. You go, oh, but they've
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:46.120]  got secrets. They'll bring them out. They do these bad things. Look, the Pentagon knows
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:51.160]  what to deal with people like this. Okay, kayak accidents. Well, they're right back.
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:58.240]  Seriously, kayak. They all need to take swims tonight. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,

[02:18:54.160 --> 02:19:03.080]  Stacey in the great state of Texas. In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:07.000]  Good to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.920]  that I don't normally take vitamins at all. I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:15.360]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:19.480]  trust. Because I've seen a lot of other vitamins, they don't have things that they say that
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:22.520]  they have in them and they're often not things that are natural. I appreciate that.
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:24.760]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force? Tell us about it.
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:28.560]  Well, it's really great. It's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good. It doesn't have
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:32.720]  that nasty aftertaste. It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste. It just gives me
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:35.440]  energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:39.560]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are. They're known to turbocharge
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:45.560]  women. And then we get the organic ones and put it in it. So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:51.040]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force. So I'm glad you plugged it. InfowarsStore.com

[02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:13.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:20.200]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:43.680]  All right. I have got a ton of news to cover and a short time to get there. We've got
[02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:50.560]  a box day, smart author and talk show host, syndicated columnist in his own right to get
[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:53.160]  into these different topics. But I saw that he was writing some really interesting stuff
[02:20:53.160 --> 02:20:58.000]  last week about the tanker attack. I know he lives over in Europe and has a lot of sources.
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.080]  And at first I was thinking this might be real because Iran had threatened to sink tankers
[02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:06.240]  there, but then that was the advice basically John Kerry gave them. And then you see all
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:10.760]  these other experts coming out in evidence that the Iranians didn't do it. They're trying
[02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:16.360]  to stop another lip at mine from going off. But regardless, the fact is most Americans
[02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:23.120]  on its face are wary because we've seen so many false flags, fake WMDs, Jesse Smollett
[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:27.920]  case, the Covington kids. My listeners, some of them got mad at me when I was saying maybe
[02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:36.320]  it's real. Well, I mean, I don't say everything is a false flag every time. But it can be
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:41.920]  irrelevant. We've had naval wars with the Iranians before like Operation Praying Manus
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:46.240]  back in the late 1980s. But Vox Day has got his view on this. But now Vox, I know you're
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:52.440]  aware of it. I want to bring this up first. How big a deal do you think it is? And how
[02:21:52.440 --> 02:21:57.600]  we get people upset about this? The New York Times comes out and says that we've been cyber
[02:21:57.600 --> 02:22:02.240]  attacking Russian power grids trying to bring them down and planning stuff on them for months
[02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:06.480]  and that Trump knows about it. And then Trump comes out and says, no, I don't know about
[02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:10.800]  it. It's treason. And that's a lie. Plus, even if you did offensively attack somebody,
[02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:15.760]  that's illegal in the international Hague, everywhere else. So to me, that is a diplomatic
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:21.040]  false flag right there of biblical proportions. This is about the biggest thing I've ever
[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:26.960]  seen. We saw Hillary obviously say for years ago, we should cyber attack them. They put
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:35.600]  the lie in there that we had supposedly been attacking them before. So it's okay. What
[02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:40.560]  do you really think is going on here? I think they're planning something big.
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:45.800]  I don't think they're planning something per se, but I really like the way that you described
[02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:52.080]  it as a diplomatic false flag because that's exactly what it is. The neocons have been
[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:59.920]  banging the drums for war with Russia almost since Putin took over. And so I see this diplomatic
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:08.560]  false flag as yet another attempt to try to stir dissension between the U.S. and Russia
[02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:13.880]  in the same way that there have been numerous attempts going into the, related to the Syria
[02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:21.920]  thing, related to Turkey. There's this consistent attempt to try to provoke war with Russia,
[02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:28.320]  which of course is absolutely insane at this point in time.
[02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:33.680]  I am speechless, which is a rare thing. When Trump says it's treason, he's right. And I
[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:37.320]  think it's clearly also meant to make Trump look weak like he doesn't know what he's
[02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:40.920]  doing. But I keep raising this. What would we do if Putin came out and said, I've been
[02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:46.120]  attacking you. I've been attacking your servers. I'm trying to bring down your power plants
[02:23:46.120 --> 02:23:50.800]  because you meddled in my elections. The U.S. admits five billion per election, trying
[02:23:50.800 --> 02:23:54.920]  to topple Putin. That's not even hidden. He still wouldn't have the excuse to try to
[02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:58.880]  take down our power plants. That's an act of physical war. That can make nuclear reactors
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:06.640]  melt down. That can kill people in hospitals. I mean, it's just such a hitlerian event.
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:14.800]  It's so beyond even Hitler. I mean, trying to bring down people's power grids preemptively.
[02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:20.080]  I think that this is directly connected to the recent release of the Chernobyl show.
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:23.360]  I don't know if you've seen it, but I've heard about it.
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:29.200]  It's a really good five-part mini series. I actually watched the whole thing. Not entirely
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:39.800]  true, but it's a docudrama. I have the impression that that was used as... I'm not saying that
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:44.520]  the documentary was created for this purpose, but given how successful the documentary has
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:49.960]  been, how much interest there's been in it, and the understanding that there is a relationship
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:56.440]  between the power grid and the nuclear reactors and so forth, which was intrinsically related
[02:24:56.440 --> 02:25:05.800]  to the Chernobyl meltdown or Chernobyl explosion, I strongly suspect that they thought, hey,
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:10.880]  we can use this as a way of creating more pressure for war with Russia. Now, the thing
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:19.040]  is it's not going to work because Putin is very, very well aware of the desire of the
[02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:26.000]  neocons and some parties to stoke war between the US and Russia, and he's just not taking
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:32.240]  the bait. I mean, he didn't take the bait when Turkey shot down a Russian jet. They're
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:39.000]  not going to take the bait over a diplomatic false flag like this.
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:44.120]  And they said the Russians shot down the Indonesian airline, and they've been having proxy wars
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:49.360]  in Ukraine, and they've moved missiles up to the edges of Russia, and it just goes on
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:54.480]  and on all these Russian diplomats and security heads being murdered. I mean, the West is
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:58.820]  in a war with Russia, but it's offensive. That's why I said Hitlerian, because it was
[02:25:58.820 --> 02:26:03.560]  Hitler that last at this level in Operation Barbarossa invaded Russia. And I'm not going
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:06.760]  to get on that. I'm not a Russophile. Russia is not perfect, but they're not offensively
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:12.000]  attacking us. And I said this last hour, you're absolutely right, we're actually first hour,
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:17.800]  but Chernobyl, you can't just turn these off and you can't just send the power out of
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:21.200]  the grids down. So that's what causes these meltdowns, and they've still got a bunch of
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:27.600]  old reactors in Russia. So bringing down their power grid is an act of total insanity.
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:36.680]  Well, especially because the US is not in the position of being the global monopolar,
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:45.080]  or the global unipolar power anymore. The US is still the strongest military in the
[02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:52.440]  world, but we no longer have the ability to simultaneously engage in two full scale wars
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:27:01.720]  on two different fronts, which back in the 80s and 90s was the plan. And my take, and
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:08.280]  this is just my interpretation, I could be completely wrong. But my take is that everybody
[02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:18.440]  understands that the US advantage over China and over Russia is decreasing. And we're not
[02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:23.040]  just talking about the current state of the militaries, we're talking about the entire
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:31.800]  state of their societies. You know, the United States today is not the United States of 1945
[02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:38.000]  or 1940. And so we no longer, we don't have the industrial advantage over China that we
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:45.720]  had over Japan and over Germany. We don't have the more intelligent population anymore.
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:51.400]  The average IQ of the US has probably fallen by about 10 points over the last 50 years.
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:55.800]  That's all true. I mean, you watch Pentagon briefings and you watch the different briefings
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:28:00.360]  of the Senate, they admit our advantages are rotting. And let's just say it, our people
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:04.600]  on average are satanic goblins. It doesn't mean everybody, but we are turning into a
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:08.640]  fallen group of people where we teach our little boys to play video games all day and
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:13.240]  put dresses on. And those people aren't going to run the world.
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:17.920]  Well, especially if you look at the recent reports, there was a story on Breitbart about
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:27.320]  how a bunch, how about three or four gamma males in the Navy SEALs were all butt hurt
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:34.400]  about their high performing commander expecting them to perform at a respectable level as
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:40.440]  part of their SEAL team. And they basically waged a campaign against them. And we're crying
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:44.960]  over things like, you know, somebody ate my cookie butter and somebody stole my can of
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:50.280]  red bull. So we got a little pink skirts. Let's talk about that when we come back. The disease
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:55.280]  of victimology with box day.

[02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:17.000]  fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and

[02:30:57.680 --> 02:31:02.560]  knew that they canned food during the falls they'd have it during the winter. And that's

[02:32:00.040 --> 02:32:07.680]  and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris. This is from
[02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:13.040]  people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine
[02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:19.520]  products and safe sex products. And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and
[02:32:19.520 --> 02:32:25.160]  clogged. Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged, the human
[02:32:25.160 --> 02:32:30.040]  body gets clogged just like that and you may be experiencing backup too. So if you want
[02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:35.960]  some relief, some explosive relief, go to infowarsstore.com and get oxy powder. But let

[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:28.720]  All right, it's the Alex Jones Show. Demonized, attacked, lied about everywhere because the
[02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:33.600]  system knows we're doing our research and we are warning the public ahead of time so
[02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:37.360]  they can recognize what's happened and say no to it. I want to get into the whole world
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:43.160]  government currency being announced by Facebook. I want to hit some other issues with Vox Day,
[02:33:43.160 --> 02:33:51.320]  dedicated columnist and author. His websites are up on infowars.com linked. But unauthorized.tv
[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:59.160]  is one of them. We also sell at infowarsstore.com. His book, Jordanetics, Journey into the Mind
[02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:03.840]  of Humanity's Greatest Thinker, that's being a little bit sarcastic. It kind of shows the
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:08.600]  side of, I'm not even attacking the guy overall, but it's good to look at. And we've also got
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:16.400]  Alt Hero, which is a whole bunch of great comics that are from a pro-human, pro-west
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:24.240]  perspective. They're very popular. They sell out all the time. We sell them at infowarsstore.com.
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:28.680]  And again, you can find them all right there. And separately, it is purchases at the site
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:33.960]  that obviously fund 80% of what we do here. I am going to bring a couple sponsors on
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:40.840]  because we need the funding to maintain and expand a few shows and to expand some more
[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:45.400]  reporters. I mean, they have fought us to a standstill with all the unprecedented attacks
[02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:48.920]  that you've seen, a lot we haven't told you about. We're still here thanks to your prayers
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:54.120]  and your support. But I don't do marketing. I just go with what I think is the best deal
[02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:57.560]  for myself on how I'd want to be treated. But talking to a few folks that have been
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:01.360]  in marketing, they're like, man, you really only do mark up your supplements and things
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:07.400]  150%. And then you always discount them 25%. So people are going to wait till it's 50.
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:11.240]  And then when you do sell it 50, you sell a lot more, but you don't crack that number
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:15.400]  of selling so much more that it brings in more money. And then everybody's habituated
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:19.540]  50% off. So it really just comes down to that. Folks, when you get the fluoride free
[02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:24.720]  toothpaste super blue, it's great. It's concentrated. It doesn't have fillers. It's got high quality
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:29.800]  iodine and colloidal silver in it. It's a great deal at what we normally sell it for.
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:36.680]  It's an amazing deal at $7 and 48 cents because there's no filler. Most stuff is super thick
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:43.320]  like dirt or like paste because it's silicates and fillers. This doesn't have that stuff
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:47.640]  in it, ladies and gentlemen. It's concentrated. So it's equivalent like three tubes of toothpaste.
[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:53.840]  Well, it's all 50% off double Patriot points on your next order. So to 5%, a 10% and free
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:58.880]  shipping store wide on everything in the supplement category, bodies, ultimate turmeric
[02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:06.680]  formula, rainforest plus all of it, the great protein bars, the highest quality info or
[02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:10.960]  store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. So getting back to
[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:15.600]  Vox day, you were, you were getting into, I didn't want to call it feminization of men
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:22.400]  because that's not really kind of insults women. It's turning men into sycophantic,
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:29.200]  client, fake, shallow people that don't want to help anybody, but just prance around like
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:34.040]  everybody's living in a sitcom or something. And then meanwhile, USA powerlifting Federation
[02:36:34.040 --> 02:36:39.800]  prepares to defend transgender athlete policy and court. And they say at some point, we're
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:45.120]  going to have to defend the biology and stand on women being a protected class. And it might
[02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:50.320]  as well start in Minnesota. The head of the powerlifting president told the Daily Caller
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:56.880]  the idea that almost all over the world now, the winners of all the powerlifting of all
[02:36:56.880 --> 02:37:03.680]  the running of all the races are biological big men who would do okay competing against
[02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:07.680]  other men. And then they come in and went all the things and take the trophies and take
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:12.880]  the money at the Olympics. They've got, you know, homaphradize running that have got testicles
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:17.400]  in a man's body. And they go, well, we did the magic one. He feels like he's a woman.
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:23.800]  This is a mind control joke. It's the religion of the left. And where do you see this going
[02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:27.280]  with the, you know, what's the end game of this?
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:34.160]  Well, the end game of this is the complete collapse of the Equality and structure. This
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:43.160]  was inevitable. You know, there is no equality. If you actually look at the facts, there is
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:52.600]  no equality of any kind, not legal, not spiritual, not material, not conceptual. Equality is
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:38:02.120]  and always will be a total lie. And so because a lot of us want to cling to a part of the
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:08.040]  myth, but reject the rest of it, it creates the opportunity for more of the lie to creep
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:16.560]  in. And now we're at the point where the lie is so has penetrated so far that that even
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:23.040]  those of us who genuinely believe in various forms of equality can't accept it any longer.
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:31.280]  And so I think that the entire structure of equality is going to collapse, but unfortunately,
[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:32.280]  probably not as soon as it should.
[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:40.360]  Now, let's go further into a microcosm, or something just a microcosm, 35,000 foot view.
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:46.440]  Asians are the top nine earning groups before white people or anybody else in this country.
[02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:51.640]  And because they apply themselves and work very hard, now all these universities in Harvard
[02:38:51.640 --> 02:38:55.640]  have said, well, we're going to give them a bad social score and say that they don't
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:39:00.440]  have souls, basically. And then the Asians sue and the left doesn't know what to do because
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:05.040]  they're so busy demonizing white people. Now they're like, well, let's say it's Asians
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:09.320]  now. It's mainly white liberals running it. They just want to keep and control minorities
[02:39:09.320 --> 02:39:13.360]  and make them have chips on their shoulders and believe that they could never excel or
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:18.880]  work hard. There's going to be some protected little suboid class they control. It's just
[02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:24.040]  incredible to watch them when the majority of the planets Asian and Asians are coming
[02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:28.560]  in and they're being successful to then say, well, it's because of what color you are.
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:32.840]  You've got an advantage or what race you are. It's another having to engage in the most
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:38.800]  classic form of racism you can imagine and suppress people that according to these systems
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:42.080]  are working hard or doing a better job. It just doesn't hold water.
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:48.320]  Well, that's not the only place that the battle is taking place. Hollywood is another major
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:55.240]  one. You've already seen a lot of Chinese money flooding in. And now the battle is moving
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:40:02.320]  to the technological front because Facebook and Google and those companies are directly
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:08.960]  in the sights of a number of the Chinese and South Korean companies. The Japanese have
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:16.560]  never really been focused externally. Even though there was that whole Japan ink thing
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:22.360]  back in the eighties, that was never really a threat to any of the interest groups in
[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:23.360]  the US.
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:27.880]  And we were cutting their oil off for 30 years as well. We got World War Two.
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:35.520]  Yeah, that didn't help. But when you look at China and you look at South Korea, they're
[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:43.800]  coming in and they're coming in hard and hot. And I find it really remarkable that the big
[02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:51.840]  social media companies are being so foolish as to attempt to cut off at least a third
[02:40:51.840 --> 02:41:01.800]  of their market when within five years, they're going to be getting overrun by the Asian alternatives.
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:07.320]  I don't think that people realize it, but the biggest Chinese company out there already
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:15.200]  has a payment processing structure that completely pervades the United States. They're not using
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:21.640]  it to compete yet with PayPal and Stripe and Mastercard. Because they haven't decided to
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:24.440]  pull the trigger yet. They're getting their whole thing in place.
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:31.080]  Well, right now, they're just using it for, what's the word, national sending money back
[02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:39.120]  to the homeland. It's basically like a Western Union for them. But it's not going to take
[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:45.480]  long. I mean, we're talking within a matter of months, if they wanted to, they could
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:52.720]  turn it into something that would destroy the U.S. payment systems that the private
[02:41:52.720 --> 02:42:01.720]  companies would outcompete them as rapidly as Huawei has outcompeted Apple. And none
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:07.160]  of these Silicon Valley companies see it coming. They're so busy trying to kick you off of
[02:42:07.160 --> 02:42:13.280]  everything, trying to ban me from, you know, both of us are personally banned from setting
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:19.160]  foot on the Mountain View campus of Google as if we wanted to. They're focused on that.
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:25.920]  And meanwhile, companies like Samsung and Huawei and other companies that are even bigger
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:31.160]  are preparing to completely eat their lunch in much the same way that those Asian students
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:35.920]  are following the old globalist ideology of dominating America, even though they have
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:39.360]  all these real big enemies that didn't follow their globalist model, they're still just
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:44.080]  trying to overthrow Western civilization because they believe that's still the dominant force.
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:48.200]  But in their overthrow of the West, they destroyed any power base they would have ever had. That's
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:53.560]  basically it. They sacrificed the Golden Goose so they could pee pee on it and feel powerful.
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:43:08.240]  That's just one of us that left us with it. I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but
[02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:25.600]  I don't know what's going on. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:53.900]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know why.
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:44:00.880]  wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last
[02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:07.320]  year or so. It's Orwellian. It's biblical. It's authoritarian. It's insane. And I keep
[02:44:07.320 --> 02:44:13.000]  trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.600]  captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking. I've begged for your support before
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:22.200]  and thanks for keeping us afloat. But this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:28.360]  of products and spread the word and keep fighting, info wars will be shut down, not just cripple.
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:31.920]  And so we've reached that point. It'll make the enemy happy. But you know, whatever, we
[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:36.600]  have stood so many of their attacks. We've gone through so much because of your support.
[02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:41.320]  You have you have been there. But let me tell you, they are pissed. They haven't been successful.
[02:44:41.320 --> 02:44:45.600]  And they're giving us their full assault. So we need your prayers, your financial support
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:51.000]  and your word of mouth. Now at infowarscore.com. It's your fight. Decide whether or not you
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:56.040]  want info wars to continue because we could be shut down.
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:45:01.400]  The globalist are hyper competitive, scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are
[02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:05.480]  control freaks in their own words. And they believe allowing you to live your own life
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:10.480]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:14.280]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:18.800]  third dimension. But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:24.000]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:29.880]  from forcelife.com, I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our original secret

[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:06.520]  glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan ever since I've been listening.
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:11.840]  I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for the bone broth. The bone broth.
[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:20.120]  The bone broth tastes like tastes like a great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to
[02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:27.440]  milk, it tastes like oval team. It tastes like oval team. It tastes like oval team. I feel great
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:33.320]  since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride three toothpaste. I've used
[02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:38.680]  the super male vitality, a host of other products. So thank you so much for that as well. Brother,
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:42.240]  you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air. I'm thanking you. But yes,
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:45.960]  this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:51.000]  the true bone broth. It is next level. It really is good. So thank you. I feel great
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:47:19.480]  since I've been taking it. Thank you. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. You are listening
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:26.840]  to an info wars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are in existence.
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:36.920]  You know, folks, I hate to cover this, but I have to because it's rolling in every hour. Video of
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:45.960]  children eight, nine, 10 years old, almost naked, simulating sex with adults, having money thrown
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:50.280]  at them, putting money in the G strings of obese men. And as long as they call it drag
[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:56.760]  queening, it's supposedly cute. Now what it is is pedophile grooming and training. So a new
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:48:00.680]  shocking story that's right along the lines of what Vox Day and I were just discussing.
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:06.120]  Get Alex Jones through just tuned in video showing child twerking. And this isn't like your average
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:10.840]  torque. This is humping the ground, spreading his legs, simulating, you know, adults all over him,
[02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:18.520]  uh, adults celebrating a sexual activity of an eight year old. A gay pride parade causes outrage.
[02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:25.560]  If I'm a bigot for opposing the Siebel, then so be it. The clip posted on Twitter shows a boy
[02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:29.640]  around ages 18, 10 years old performing at the provocative dance in which the performer
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:35.720]  thrust their hips back and forth and shake their buttocks while squatting. And he has
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:40.040]  everything on but short shorts. I'm a bigot for opposing the Siebel. Then so be it.
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:43.640]  Said Greg Palmer who posted the original video, which now has over a million views.
[02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:47.400]  Other respondents echoed his sentiment. This is pure able being pushed by the left.
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:52.280]  Said Robbie Starbucks. They're sexualizing kids and working to socially engineer the world where
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:57.960]  kids have no innocence. I don't think they realize what a red line this is for many of us. We must
[02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:05.480]  fight this evil. They'll never be okay. And it goes on. No, the left knows it came out of Viacom
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:10.280]  15 years ago. They wanted to sexualize five year olds. They want control. They want to screw them
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:15.800]  up. Makes me so sad how much of this has seen in a short kid's life. Kids like this feel used
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:20.360]  before they're even grown. Said another Twitter user. And it goes on ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:25.800]  Here's another one. Drag Queen admits that he's here to groom your children. That was at Lafayette,
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:32.520]  Louisiana and telling the people they were evil. That they were bad and that we're coming. We're
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:37.240]  going to get your kids this weekend. They had armed Antifa out at a library. Took so that we
[02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:42.680]  quote couldn't cover it. And they assaulted. Oh, and Troyer on video and began humping him.
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:48.280]  I'll play that after Vox leaves us. But yes, just running up and sort of humping a reporter.
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:53.320]  It's all about dominating. It's all about control. It's all about evil.
[02:49:54.200 --> 02:49:58.360]  And it's who these people are so that he couldn't even get into the library or get near the
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:05.480]  godlike drag queen that they were bringing the little children to like offerings to Moloch.
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:09.400]  So let's play that clip for the man saying your children are mine. Here it is.
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:15.800]  Hi, my name is Ellen Pontiff. I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for drag queen
[02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:21.640]  story time. So apparently to a lot of people in this room, I'm the big bookie man. I am just as
[02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:27.000]  talented as a singer or a dancer or anyone that has a special talent. It just mine is dressing up
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:32.040]  as a woman entertaining a crowd. The eyes that people give you whenever they think that you
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:36.360]  are the one that's in support of this event is truly disgusting. But I'm here to let you know
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:40.040]  that this event is something that's going to be very beautiful. And for the children and the
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:43.960]  people that supported are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next
[02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:49.880]  generation. We are trying to groom the next generation to not see the way that they just did.
[02:50:49.880 --> 02:50:54.520]  And just because I said that you heard the little plurip people behind me. It's disgusting.
[02:50:54.520 --> 02:51:02.040]  It's disgusting that he says he's coming to groom your children, whether you like it or not. So in
[02:51:02.040 --> 02:51:06.280]  the past, these guys had to creep up to your backyard or try to get into the window at night
[02:51:06.280 --> 02:51:11.080]  or become a school counselor and kind of get the kid in the corner real fast. But not now,
[02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:15.720]  you're disgusting. And now let's play the convicted murderer with his buddy that has
[02:51:15.720 --> 02:51:20.920]  the show where Desmond comes on a little kids and the guys that invented the club kid movement
[02:51:20.920 --> 02:51:25.240]  talking about bring your children to the screen. The corruption is about to begin. Here it is.
[02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:29.880]  And now we've got something to show you and we have to warn you ladies and gentlemen,
[02:51:29.880 --> 02:51:34.920]  if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[02:51:37.240 --> 02:51:41.480]  What we're going to show you is going to leave an impression on them. And we hope the impression
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:46.440]  will be that they grow up if they're three or four or five years old to become seven or eight
[02:51:46.440 --> 02:51:52.600]  year old drag queen performers. I mean, both those guys could be in serial killer roles that
[02:51:52.600 --> 02:51:56.600]  like that didn't win Academy Awards. Oh, but one of them actually is a famous killer that
[02:51:56.600 --> 02:52:02.680]  chopped up a man, but it's okay. He got out of jail because he's liberal, liberal of Vox Day.
[02:52:03.640 --> 02:52:08.120]  What is the whole point of this coming out at our children, the LGBT movement?
[02:52:08.120 --> 02:52:19.960]  Oh, it's all satanic pedophiles. They're pure evil. And this strips away all of the
[02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:28.520]  veneer. It's not about Democrats versus Republicans. It's not about liberals versus
[02:52:28.520 --> 02:52:35.080]  conservatives. It's not even about nationalists versus globalists. It's ultimately about Christians
[02:52:35.080 --> 02:52:47.000]  versus Satanists. These are the children of the devil. And that's why they want to destroy
[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:53.160]  Western civilization. That's why they want to destroy Christian civilization. And they're just
[02:52:54.360 --> 02:53:05.000]  the avant-garde. They're just the vanguard. But the movement runs broad and deep. It goes
[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:13.320]  like Ben Shapiro trying to claim that Western civilization is Judeo-Christian and is based
[02:53:13.320 --> 02:53:20.680]  in Jerusalem and Athens. It's total nonsense. Totally false. He is an intellectual drag queen
[02:53:20.680 --> 02:53:26.440]  in the same way that these are child-sacrificing drag queens.
[02:53:26.440 --> 02:53:29.720]  Well, I don't like Ben Shapiro because he's a never-trumper in things, but I've read a lot of
[02:53:29.720 --> 02:53:35.960]  history. But quantify your statement that Western civilization has nothing to do with
[02:53:35.960 --> 02:53:42.440]  Jews or with the Greeks. No, it does have to do with the Greeks. There are three pillars of
[02:53:42.440 --> 02:53:50.040]  Western civilization. I thought you said Athens. You said not... No, he claims that Western civilization
[02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:57.720]  is Athens plus Jerusalem. And that's totally false because it leaves out both Christianity
[02:53:57.720 --> 02:54:00.360]  and it leaves out the European nations, which are actually...
[02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:03.160]  Wow, he leaves them completely out. Wow, that's amazing.
[02:54:04.040 --> 02:54:11.560]  Yes. And this is all intentional. It's all related. I mean, it goes back. What they're trying to do
[02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:17.640]  now with Western civilization is they're trying to do to Western civilization what was done to
[02:54:17.640 --> 02:54:25.240]  America 50, 60 years ago when they started defining America as a nation of immigrants
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:32.120]  and a melting pot and all this other nonsense that was totally false. Now they're attempting to do
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:38.920]  that to Western civilization. Shapiro is just trying to redefine Western civilization in the
[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:44.280]  same way that the United States of America was redefined after World War II. Well, there's no
[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:50.520]  doubt that Shapiro and Jordan Peterson have been force-fed from the top right in. And I am seeing
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:53.880]  even though they're force-fed by Google, their numbers are starting to decline.
[02:54:53.880 --> 02:54:58.040]  So I see them working a lot harder now in things. I'm not in competition with them. I wish they were
[02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:04.040]  on our team, but I do see them like Peterson has a lecture explaining, well, Christianity is good,
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:08.520]  but of course it's a fable, but it's got good lessons for us all. I mean,
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:13.800]  so the devil couldn't be doing a better job. It all comes down to the same thing. Like I said,
[02:55:14.520 --> 02:55:21.320]  ultimately, at the end of the day, you either serve God through Jesus Christ,
[02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:29.640]  or you serve the God of this world. And that's why I think it's always important to ask,
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:36.520]  who is your master? Who is your God? It's definitely a religious demarcation line,
[02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:41.320]  because I've noticed a cultist of any type. They always have their loving liberal white magic cover,
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:44.920]  but it's always evil. They always know if you're a Christian, even if you don't say it,
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:48.920]  and they always want to destroy you, and they're always in the process of being destroyed themselves.
[02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:54.200]  And the final thing is the corruption of children. That's where it always ends up.
[02:55:55.080 --> 02:56:01.960]  Where you see the clue, the reliable clue, the reliable tell, is in the inversion.
[02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:11.480]  In the Bible, it's written, woe to those who call evil good and good evil. And that's a specific
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:15.160]  example of inversion. When the Bible says woe, that means your ass is about to get struck by
[02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:20.440]  lightning. In fact, for TV viewers, you're seeing this nightmare, this drag, because the controllers
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:24.200]  of the kids always wearing clown makeup. That's the disguise. It's not a drag queen, it's a clown
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:29.560]  group. So a man in a clown outfit is sexually kind of humping towards him, and he tells him,
[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:33.800]  twerk now, do your trick, and the boy does it for him. And it's disgusting.
[02:56:35.800 --> 02:56:41.800]  Well, and it's supposed to be because they are always attempting to invert the good,
[02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:49.640]  the beautiful and the true. That's why that drag queen who was speaking publicly was talking about
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:56.040]  how they were disgusting, the way that they look at me is disgusting. No, it's not. He knows he's
[02:56:56.040 --> 02:57:01.240]  the disgusting one. He knows he's the evil one, but he's attempting to invert the truth. And that's
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:06.920]  why that's why you always see evil. That's why he said this little group behind me. No, they built
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:11.960]  America. They're good people. They're Christians. They love God. They're upset. They're hardworking,
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:17.240]  and you're going this little, it's like a demon. This little group has nothing. I'll spend time
[02:57:17.240 --> 02:57:24.440]  with your children, and it's going to be beautiful when I groom them. And he goes on, I'm a sex worker
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:30.840]  by night, and I know to keep my sex away when I'm with your children. Then you're just like, holy
[02:57:30.840 --> 02:57:38.280]  hell, box day, always great, haven't you? Is unauthorized.tv the best website? Well, I'm a
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:42.280]  little biased, but give us a shot. That woman, that's the best one. You got a bunch of websites.
[02:57:42.280 --> 02:57:50.600]  All right, and get us comic books and info wars. One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be

[03:00:08.600 --> 03:00:12.840]  listener or a TV viewer, go to infowars.com and newswars.com and get the nightmare article.
[03:00:13.560 --> 03:00:18.200]  I apologize if Watson didn't get it out to everybody. We'll do a larger article showing
[03:00:18.200 --> 03:00:22.360]  a bunch of the examples. This is a young boy, looks like he's about eight years old, maybe seven,
[03:00:23.800 --> 03:00:34.040]  being directed by a potbellied creature and a woman to twerk for everyone as a sexual object
[03:00:34.680 --> 03:00:40.760]  during their writhing so-called gay pride parade that resembles a barrel of snakes that have been
[03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:48.840]  snorting PCP. These are literal piranhas that have been turned loose on our children. And then I'm
[03:00:48.840 --> 03:00:53.000]  going to play a clip of drag queen story time outside Austin this weekend where the armed
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:57.000]  antifa came out and then some of them, Owen was just trying to get to the event. They wouldn't
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:03.160]  let him get in and they began humping him. So that's how the left operates. A lot of folks
[03:01:03.160 --> 03:01:08.120]  have been arrested for assaulting Owen, but that hasn't happened yet in this case. So
[03:01:08.120 --> 03:01:13.720]  video showing child twerking at gay pride parade causes outrage. There's no audio to this,
[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:19.480]  but it's got millions of views up on Twitter. It's on infowars.com. Now let's go to some of the
[03:01:19.480 --> 03:01:25.560]  audios, a long report. It's up on infowars.com. Owen's Troyer being attacked for going to the
[03:01:26.280 --> 03:01:31.160]  men dressed up as clowns whose children are brought to at public events and schools. That's
[03:01:31.160 --> 03:01:35.560]  what it is. It's not drag queen story time. It's a big nationwide international movement,
[03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:41.080]  massive funding in your schools. If I can send the news that now they're teaching kids during
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:45.960]  career day in the fifth grade to how to be a drag queen or how to be a sex worker.
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:51.720]  That's actually in the news today. I'm not joking that Vogue is teaching the girls how
[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:57.880]  great it is to be a sex worker. So there it is. It's pride. And what is it pride in? It's pride
[03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:05.640]  in the sexualization of children. And there it is in every state surging forth. And that's what's
[03:02:05.640 --> 03:02:11.720]  going on where you bring your men, you bring your children to sit on the knees of men. Wow. Couldn't
[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:17.160]  think of something more nightmarish. If a man in a clown outfit approached your child and talked
[03:02:17.160 --> 03:02:22.680]  about their booty at a park, they'd go to jail. But if you just bring your child to story time,
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:27.880]  most of the time not being told and waiting for them is a grotesque creature. In many cases,
[03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:35.800]  up to 400 pound goblin creatures are there and the children are brought up and they even talk to
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:40.600]  them about their sexual preferences. And some of them are convicted pedophiles. We learn why they
[03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:45.320]  use aliases. As Ellen pointed out yesterday when he hosts the show, they shouldn't be giving their
[03:02:45.320 --> 03:02:51.800]  drag queen name. These are adults to be with their children in the grooming phase. And we
[03:02:51.800 --> 03:02:58.440]  should know these men's names in their demonic clown mask. This is an eyes wide shut folks.
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:05.720]  This is America 2019. And this is evil coming out of the pit. Let's go ahead and roll that clip
[03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:22.120]  of Ellen being assaulted. Oh, my gosh. These people are literally all helping me right now.
[03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:31.480]  Owen Stroyer here for info wars.com. And I am at the Leander Public Library in Austin, Texas.
[03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:37.720]  And there is quite a storyline as to how we got here today with major,
[03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:44.040]  major, massive police presence even across the street. There's multiple police vehicles at a
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:49.880]  funeral home down the street. You had police lined up for a quarter mile away from the venue.
[03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:56.040]  But let me tell you how we got here as we walked down the police line and you can see the massive
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:04:02.200]  police presence that is out here. So about a month ago, the Leander Public Library announced
[03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:07.720]  that they were going to be having a drag queen story time. And so myself and a couple other
[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:12.520]  local activists here in Austin wondered, do we want to make a big scene of this? Do we want to
[03:04:12.520 --> 03:04:17.160]  keep this under wraps and then maybe infiltrate or go film? And then they started promoting it
[03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:21.960]  more and more. They released public flyers. And so that's when we decided, okay, I'm going to report
[03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:26.920]  on this, shed some light on it and see what happens. Let's see how this goes. Hello, sir.
[03:04:27.480 --> 03:04:33.160]  Are you, are you a gay frog? Yes, I sure am. Tell me, what's it like being a gay frog?
[03:04:33.800 --> 03:04:38.680]  You should go ask the gay mafia in Hollywood. You were hearing about that on your show just the
[03:04:38.680 --> 03:04:57.000]  other day. The full report is up on info wars.com and news wars. What you have witnessed is the
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:05.480]  biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history. This is a digital AI enforced
[03:05:05.480 --> 03:05:10.680]  gag order, not to say the name Alex Jones or info wars.com.
[03:05:15.960 --> 03:05:21.880]  This is Nazi Germany level. This is racketeering. This is cartels. Mr. President, we need your
[03:05:21.880 --> 03:05:29.240]  help. We need it now. You can take on big tech. They saw info wars as a dominant independent
[03:05:29.240 --> 03:05:36.280]  anti war pro human pro sovereign pro family populist organization. So they thought first they come
[03:05:36.280 --> 03:05:42.520]  for Alex Jones. Then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would
[03:05:42.520 --> 03:05:47.960]  fall. The way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a standard
[03:05:47.960 --> 03:05:52.680]  of freedom and free speech understand that they believe they can take us down. They'll take everybody
[03:05:52.680 --> 03:06:10.120]  else down. From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:11.720 --> 03:06:15.560]  That's right. And Gerald Salente is taking over here in about five minutes. There he is with
[03:06:15.560 --> 03:06:22.840]  TV viewers on screen in his awesome command base in Kingston, New York. So we're looking really
[03:06:22.840 --> 03:06:27.640]  forward to hearing what he has to say the next 55 minutes or so. We're about to go to him just
[03:06:27.640 --> 03:06:31.720]  briefly. Some of the news I didn't hit that I should have started the show off with. There's a
[03:06:31.720 --> 03:06:38.440]  lot of amazing video up on info wars.com and news wars.com. Trump supporters wait 40 hours in line
[03:06:38.440 --> 03:06:45.880]  before rally while relatively few show up for impeach 45 protests. And there's videos of
[03:06:46.680 --> 03:06:51.160]  Trump's tweeted amount, maybe 100 people, the biggest rally against him in DC. And then tens of
[03:06:51.160 --> 03:06:57.560]  thousands coming out for Trump rallies. That video and photos are up on news wars.com. Get that out.
[03:06:57.560 --> 03:07:04.520]  It is so important. Another video that's important viral CGI video shows robot rebelling
[03:07:04.520 --> 03:07:09.880]  violently attacking its creators. And again, folks, that's the problem with all these robots and
[03:07:09.880 --> 03:07:16.600]  automation is that it allows the globalist to cut human decision making out of the process and allows
[03:07:16.600 --> 03:07:24.200]  tyrants to do whatever they want. That's what's so incredibly dangerous about that. Also, China
[03:07:24.200 --> 03:07:30.200]  or organ harvesting dissidents says whistleblower held China advertisers that they sell organs.
[03:07:30.200 --> 03:07:37.400]  But it's a big breakdown. The latest of just how serious that demon that dehumanization is.
[03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:47.000]  Some of the other news showing how unpopular the left is Jim Acosta's book already discounted 40%
[03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:54.680]  in first week. It's force fed. In his book, he claims the president is a dictator. That's the
[03:07:54.680 --> 03:07:59.640]  new talking point. It's incredible. I can't wait to hear Joe Salento talk about the New York Times
[03:07:59.640 --> 03:08:05.640]  publishing a story Trump calls treasonous where they say that we've cyber attacked Russia because
[03:08:05.640 --> 03:08:10.120]  they stole the election and hacked the voting machines. That's a total lie. And Trump says it's
[03:08:10.120 --> 03:08:15.080]  a lie that we ever attacked Russia. That's an act of war. But Hillary has said she wants that.
[03:08:15.080 --> 03:08:21.320]  So the government to a great extent acts like Hillary is still the president. We will break it
[03:08:21.320 --> 03:08:25.320]  all down. Gerald Salente will take over in just a moment. But first, please remember,
[03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:31.080]  Gerald Salente at trendsresearch.com is one of the top trends researchers in the country. He's

[03:08:40.280 --> 03:08:44.520]  And people more and more don't even listen to online stuff. They listen to nice color magazines.
[03:08:44.520 --> 03:08:49.800]  What was old is now back in hip. We're finding DVDs are selling good again because people want
[03:08:49.800 --> 03:08:55.160]  to physically hold things in this age of censorship. So that's good instinct. So be sure and go there.
[03:08:55.160 --> 03:08:58.840]  Sign up for us free news alerts and more and support is great work. And finally,
[03:09:00.520 --> 03:09:05.080]  ladies and gentlemen, I had thought about when is the time to go on air and say,
[03:09:05.080 --> 03:09:09.000]  okay, without your support, we'll be in trouble. When is the time to say, listen,
[03:09:09.800 --> 03:09:14.360]  I know I'm always asking for support because we're running a real media operation with real
[03:09:14.360 --> 03:09:19.880]  bandwidth and real cost and millions of years of bandwidth. Got great crew. Got a lot of things
[03:09:19.880 --> 03:09:24.520]  we need to do. I share reporters kicking butt in the field, getting tens of millions of views
[03:09:24.520 --> 03:09:29.080]  a week, exposing the corruption of the globalist. We need to get more reporters, four or five more,
[03:09:29.080 --> 03:09:32.520]  four or five more camera people. Got a couple new live shows I want to watch.
[03:09:32.520 --> 03:09:37.080]  And then I think info wars will pretty much be where it needs to be. But without your support,
[03:09:37.080 --> 03:09:41.400]  we're going to start contracting, not growing. That's what I say. You're either growing,
[03:09:41.400 --> 03:09:45.480]  you're contracting. Well, we've not been growing. So the contractions been going on under these
[03:09:45.480 --> 03:09:51.320]  attacks the last couple of years. And folks, this is a real war. So just get your high quality

[03:10:55.240 --> 03:10:59.480]  to the great Gerald Salente. I don't know what you're going to cover first, but I'm always listening
[03:10:59.480 --> 03:11:03.480]  when I go eat my lunch, when I get off, whenever you host. So thanks for hosting the fourth hour,
[03:11:03.480 --> 03:11:10.120]  and then coming up in 50 minutes, Owen Schreuer is loaded for bear. He's ready to fight. He's on fire,
[03:11:10.120 --> 03:11:15.400]  the war room, 3 p.m. Central, Gerald Salente. Thanks for having me on, Alex, and thanks for all
[03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:21.080]  that you do to keep the people informed about what's going on as the prostitutes just put out
[03:11:21.080 --> 03:11:27.480]  more junk. All they are is corporate whores. They get paid by their corporate johns and their
[03:11:27.480 --> 03:11:33.080]  whormasters to do what they're told. So thank you for having me on, and everyone listening,
[03:11:33.080 --> 03:11:38.680]  please do what you can to support info wars, because the truth is hard to find anymore.
[03:11:38.680 --> 03:11:45.160]  You know, you mentioned about the Russians. This is a story out of financial times.
[03:11:46.600 --> 03:11:55.560]  EU poll hit by Russian disinformation. Russian sources mounted, quote, a continued and sustained
[03:11:56.680 --> 03:12:04.840]  disinformation effort to, quote, suppress voter turnout and influence voter preferences
[03:12:04.840 --> 03:12:12.600]  at last month's EU parliamentary elections. The document does not draw conclusions about who
[03:12:12.600 --> 03:12:20.360]  was behind the disinformation or how it was coordinated. But it says the polls faced wide
[03:12:20.360 --> 03:12:28.920]  ranging attempts to mislead voters. Again, not one shred of evidence. And here's the disgusting
[03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:35.640]  element about what the prostitutes get paid to put out by their whormasters. The fact of the
[03:12:35.640 --> 03:12:47.640]  matter is the turnout in the EU parliamentary elections was the highest in 25 years. So hit by
[03:12:48.200 --> 03:12:55.720]  Russian disinformation. Another fact, the green parties, the socialist parties,
[03:12:55.720 --> 03:13:03.080]  won many more votes than they had anticipated, not the so called, quote, populist party.
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:10.840]  So this is how they keep sell selling and making us hate Russia with no information behind it.
[03:13:11.480 --> 03:13:19.480]  Another anti Russian story, big story here in the financial times again today.
[03:13:19.480 --> 03:13:29.640]  A journalist release signifies fear of unrest. The evidence was blatantly fabricated when Russian
[03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:37.160]  investigative reporter was arraigned in a Moscow court last Saturday on charges of drug dealing.
[03:13:37.160 --> 03:13:43.400]  He expected the worst. Anyway, they freed him right away. Putin called in an investigation
[03:13:43.400 --> 03:13:50.600]  as to why this guy was arrested. Now let's make this really simple. Hey, anybody see Chelsea
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:59.080]  Manning lately? How about Julian Assange? You don't see the papers writing about that,
[03:13:59.080 --> 03:14:07.080]  do you? But a big story here when the Russians do it. Freedom of speech is gone in this country.
[03:14:07.080 --> 03:14:16.040]  It's one of our top trends for 2019 censorship 2019. So do what you can to support info wars.
[03:14:16.040 --> 03:14:21.400]  Of course, I love my super male vitality. Because, you know, you got a boogie before the lights go
[03:14:21.400 --> 03:14:27.480]  out. Because tomorrow is iffy. And this stuff keeps me moving and rocking in a roll with.
[03:14:27.480 --> 03:14:34.760]  So that's what we do with trend forecasting. We look at the facts behind the stories, rather
[03:14:34.760 --> 03:14:41.080]  than the propaganda they keep putting out. And just another example of how dumb down the media
[03:14:41.080 --> 03:14:47.560]  is. This is today's toilet paper of record the New York Times. This is the front of the business
[03:14:47.560 --> 03:14:54.120]  section. Look at all that black and that stupid little picture down here of Mario Draghi, the
[03:14:54.120 --> 03:14:59.480]  head of the European Central Bank, former henchman for the Goldman Sachs gang. He was head of the
[03:14:59.480 --> 03:15:04.840]  European division. They don't have anything to write about. This is the news, the business news
[03:15:04.840 --> 03:15:13.400]  section. And then when you go inside, it's just another full page of stupid photos. That's why
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:20.200]  you tune in to info wars. And of course, subscribe to the Trends Journal because you're not getting
[03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:28.600]  any news anymore. You're getting biased opinions without any facts. Oh, today I saw a Gloria
[03:15:28.600 --> 03:15:37.080]  Vanderbilt passed away. Yeah. Anderson Cooper's mommy, the guy born on third base and thought he
[03:15:37.080 --> 03:16:02.360]  hit a home run. He'd be nowhere if he wasn't a Vanderbilt. So stay tuned. We'll be right back.
[03:16:02.360 --> 03:16:10.760]  Thank you for joining me here.

[03:17:51.880 --> 03:17:59.240]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[03:17:59.240 --> 03:18:04.600]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[03:18:04.600 --> 03:18:10.600]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[03:18:11.240 --> 03:18:17.320]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[03:18:17.320 --> 03:18:23.320]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials
[03:18:23.320 --> 03:18:28.760]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet
[03:18:28.760 --> 03:18:34.440]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is
[03:18:34.440 --> 03:18:39.640]  not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[03:18:39.640 --> 03:18:44.840]  activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[03:18:44.840 --> 03:18:51.320]  in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack
[03:18:51.320 --> 03:18:56.680]  of our pollen block chewable tablets. It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like

[03:19:47.560 --> 03:20:03.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:17.880 --> 03:20:29.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones. And now your host,
[03:20:29.240 --> 03:20:38.360]  Gerald Salente. Hello, hello, hello. Great being here on the Alex Jones show, infowars. Remember,
[03:20:38.360 --> 03:20:45.720]  do what you can to support infowars. Buy the products, keep the truth alive. I was mentioning,
[03:20:45.720 --> 03:20:49.960]  as we were going out to break, you know, once upon a time there used to be reporters,
[03:20:49.960 --> 03:20:55.560]  but they've cut them back. One of our trends journal stories in the last edition is the
[03:20:55.560 --> 03:21:01.160]  fourth estate rest in peace. They called the fourth estate because you had the executive branch,
[03:21:01.160 --> 03:21:07.400]  the judicial branch and the congressional branch. And the fourth estate was the media to watch
[03:21:07.400 --> 03:21:13.880]  to see what the other three were doing and to inform the people about what they were doing
[03:21:13.880 --> 03:21:20.040]  to help us and to hurt us. He's going to have to take a sip of water here.
[03:21:25.320 --> 03:21:32.040]  So they don't have reporters anymore. They cut down the staffs to nothing. And again,
[03:21:32.040 --> 03:21:38.840]  I showed you this photo. This is the business section of today's toilet paper record, the New
[03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:49.720]  York Times. They call themselves the paper record, but there's nothing any more of record. It's just
[03:21:49.720 --> 03:21:58.200]  the propaganda piece of junk. And here's when you open up into the middle for the rest of the
[03:21:58.200 --> 03:22:06.040]  story. Look at these stupid photos. I need information to learn about what's going on,
[03:22:06.040 --> 03:22:13.720]  the current events forming future trend. They're not providing it. Mr. Whatever it takes
[03:22:16.680 --> 03:22:23.880]  in his eight years atop the ECB, Draghi charted new territory in monetary policy.
[03:22:25.560 --> 03:22:34.200]  Yes, new territory in monetary policy, negative interest rates. Excuse me.
[03:22:34.200 --> 03:22:37.320]  Negative interest rates.
[03:22:39.960 --> 03:22:49.240]  Quantitative easing. Nearly $3 trillion worth. And was it done? Nothing.
[03:22:57.080 --> 03:23:01.960]  Something stuck in my throat over here. I shouldn't have had a peppers and sausage sandwich before I
[03:23:01.960 --> 03:23:13.640]  came on. But I made those peppers and sausage myself. So anyway, $3 trillion worth of quantitative
[03:23:13.640 --> 03:23:21.080]  easing. And now you're looking at the German economy, the strongest one there. It's lucky to grow
[03:23:21.080 --> 03:23:36.040]  at about 0.6% this year. A major downgrade. A downgrade around the world. We are going into
[03:23:36.040 --> 03:23:51.800]  the greatest recession. Excuse me. And so what's going on in the emerging markets?
[03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:59.800]  They're selling out. They got real problems. Subdued volatility and worsening data, fuel
[03:23:59.800 --> 03:24:07.160]  on ease on Wall Street. U.S. rate cut prospects spurred demand for junk bonds.
[03:24:08.680 --> 03:24:09.000]  Thank you.
[03:24:14.440 --> 03:24:21.800]  Junk bonds, right? Because you're not getting any interest rates. So we're saying the Federal
[03:24:21.800 --> 03:24:27.480]  Reserve is meeting this week, tomorrow and Wednesday. We believe they're going to announce
[03:24:27.480 --> 03:24:34.040]  a rate cut very soon. They should have cut them before. There's a global slowdown going on.
[03:24:35.880 --> 03:24:37.880]  In one sector after another.
[03:24:41.560 --> 03:24:49.960]  The numbers are here. Millennials face greatest hardships from toxic economic conditions. This
[03:24:49.960 --> 03:24:55.960]  is from Stanford University, not the world's socialist organization. Millennials are in
[03:24:55.960 --> 03:25:02.120]  less money without college degrees than their predecessors and are more likely to die by
[03:25:02.120 --> 03:25:10.680]  suicide or drug overdose than any other generation. The average millennial has an average net worth
[03:25:10.680 --> 03:25:21.800]  of $8,000 far less than previous generations. It's one story after another. Suicide rate,
[03:25:21.800 --> 03:25:28.360]  you ready for this? The doctors and young physicians among the highest in the U.S.
[03:25:28.360 --> 03:25:35.800]  population, these are doctors. And the reason is, is that it's one big takeover.
[03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:41.320]  When I was a kid, we used to have the family doctor used to come to our house.
[03:25:42.520 --> 03:25:45.800]  And then you went to the doctor's office and it was in their house.
[03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:52.120]  It was a nicer house than everybody else had, but it was nothing great.
[03:25:54.280 --> 03:26:00.120]  I wrote about this in my book, Trends 2000 back in 1996 when they gave us the HMOs.
[03:26:02.680 --> 03:26:10.440]  And now it's no more drug stores. You got CVS. No more stationary stores.
[03:26:10.440 --> 03:26:20.840]  You got staples. No more hardware stores. You got Lowe's and Home Depot. It's a takeover.
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:31.880]  And it's in every country. And that's why you're seeing these protests going on.
[03:26:31.880 --> 03:26:40.120]  Look what's going on as we're speaking in Hong Kong. Two million people taking to the streets,
[03:26:41.080 --> 03:26:52.280]  not just once, but day after day. They got about one point, excuse me, about 7.5 million people
[03:26:52.280 --> 03:27:02.280]  there. And two million around the streets protesting. Where do you get in America? And we're going to
[03:27:02.280 --> 03:27:06.840]  go to the Washington Mall for a day. Get on the bus and then come home and forget about it.
[03:27:07.560 --> 03:27:13.960]  No protests. What do you think brought down the Berlin Wall? It's when the people went there
[03:27:13.960 --> 03:27:20.120]  and they wouldn't leave. And more people came and they wouldn't leave. And more people came and
[03:27:20.120 --> 03:27:30.520]  they wouldn't leave. But not in America. Nope. Everybody's just on their handheld.
[03:27:32.440 --> 03:27:41.880]  That's all it is. And the information is here to show you how bad it's getting. Americans now
[03:27:41.880 --> 03:27:52.360]  spend more at internet stores than restaurants. Courage is gone. And that's why you need to
[03:27:52.360 --> 03:27:58.840]  support InfoWord. And of course, the Trends Journal and other people that put the truth out.
[03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:05.720]  Because you can see where this is going. If we don't fight back, we're gone. Unless you like the
[03:28:05.720 --> 03:28:13.240]  Democrats and the repulsive kids. I don't like any of them. I don't believe in parties. I believe in
[03:28:13.240 --> 03:28:22.200]  people. So it's up to we the people to make the change. Hey, if they could do it in Hong Kong,
[03:28:23.080 --> 03:28:32.600]  could we do it in America? Could we break up these 1% that are robbing us and taking all the dough?
[03:28:32.600 --> 03:28:35.880]  We'll be back in a little bit.
[03:29:03.080 --> 03:29:09.000]  Without taking another pill. Because now Sunny Bay heating wraps and pillows are available at both
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:15.880]  Amazon and Walmart. Yes, see Sunny Bay's four and a half to five star customer reviews on Amazon.com

[03:35:28.280 --> 03:35:34.680]  going to lower interest rates back in march and our trend alerts the federal reserves meeting on
[03:35:34.680 --> 03:35:40.360]  tuesday and wednesday i believe they're going to not wait till july to lower rates they're
[03:35:40.360 --> 03:35:50.600]  going to do it now current events form future trends you're ready empire state manufacturing
[03:35:50.600 --> 03:36:01.080]  index posts largest ever drop into negative territory in june oh june hey we're in june
[03:36:03.960 --> 03:36:09.880]  hot off the press the new york fed's empire state business conditions index took a sharp
[03:36:09.880 --> 03:36:18.280]  turn for the worst in june falling into negative territory for the first time in more than two
[03:36:18.280 --> 03:36:30.040]  years the empire state manufacturing index plummeted 26.4 points to negative 8.6 in june
[03:36:30.840 --> 03:36:42.840]  the new york fed said today that's a record decline economists had expected a rendering of positive
[03:36:42.840 --> 03:36:54.600]  10 any reading below zero indicates a contraction in activity and there was broad base weakness
[03:36:54.600 --> 03:37:04.600]  in the report the key metric the new orders index sank 21.7 percent to minus 12 in june
[03:37:04.600 --> 03:37:15.240]  shipments fell 6.6 percent to 9.7 unfilled orders also fell sharply and inventory sank
[03:37:15.240 --> 03:37:28.120]  into negative territory the index of future activity fell 4.9 percent to 25.7 in june i'm
[03:37:28.120 --> 03:37:35.880]  going through this in detail to show you how serious this is and there's a global slowdown
[03:37:37.400 --> 03:37:43.480]  the chinese are dumping money in the yuan the yuan now is almost seven to a dollar
[03:37:46.200 --> 03:37:53.720]  and they're not doing it to devalue their currency they're doing it to pump up their economy
[03:37:53.720 --> 03:38:01.000]  they lower their reserve ratio requirement so banks can loan more money out not have a lot
[03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:11.720]  of money in the bank there's a global slowdown they should have lowered interest rates in this
[03:38:11.720 --> 03:38:24.760]  country months ago they should have stopped raising them last year am i in favor of low
[03:38:24.760 --> 03:38:31.800]  interest rates it's not a question of that it's a war against the savings because we got no way
[03:38:31.800 --> 03:38:40.760]  to put our own money other than any junk bonds or markets because if you put them in regular bonds
[03:38:40.760 --> 03:38:45.960]  you're not getting any money matter of fact when they're bragging about mario dragy
[03:38:49.480 --> 03:38:55.800]  european central bank president and i mentioned what's going on in germany guess what you know
[03:38:55.800 --> 03:39:02.360]  here are a lot of great folks out there in info wars i got a deal for you you buy the german bond
[03:39:02.360 --> 03:39:10.920]  the bond buy a 10-year bond and in 10 years we'll give you less than what you're boarded for i'm
[03:39:10.920 --> 03:39:21.000]  not making that up negative yield so that's where we're at what's going out on there in the middle
[03:39:21.000 --> 03:39:30.200]  east with iran the good news is oil prices haven't spiked and they're actually in bare territory
[03:39:30.200 --> 03:39:37.400]  that means they're down 20 percent what happened over there in the streets of or moves
[03:39:37.400 --> 03:39:44.360]  last week the day before that happened oil prices were down four percent when that happened oil
[03:39:44.360 --> 03:39:50.200]  prices spiked up four percent but then it went back down what's that telling you
[03:39:50.200 --> 03:39:58.840]  you it's telling you that the flare-ups not ready to flare up because if it was prices would go way up
[03:39:59.960 --> 03:40:05.720]  but the other part of the story it's telling you is that there's more supply than demand
[03:40:07.480 --> 03:40:14.520]  in oil and that's why prices aren't going up it's a global slowdown a report just came out
[03:40:14.520 --> 03:40:23.240]  from the former central bank head of india and he said they're cooking the books they're rigging
[03:40:23.240 --> 03:40:33.240]  the market growth isn't as strong as they're saying it is so oil prices should be spiking now
[03:40:33.800 --> 03:40:41.160]  but demand is down and is more supply than demand another key indicated a watch if you want to see
[03:40:41.160 --> 03:40:49.800]  the things are going to explode gold prices gold is reaching a critical level now on the way up
[03:40:50.920 --> 03:40:56.920]  we believe it as bottom they could go another fifty dollars down sixty dollars in the futures
[03:40:56.920 --> 03:41:05.240]  markets that's very small right as we're speaking now it's around the one thousand three hundred
[03:41:05.240 --> 03:41:12.920]  and forty range it needs to go up another fifty five bucks less action has to hit
[03:41:14.920 --> 03:41:21.720]  about three eighty five when it hits that mark the next jump is going to be fourteen fifty
[03:41:22.840 --> 03:41:28.200]  if it breaks fourteen fifty the spike is going to go my forecast is to two thousand
[03:41:28.200 --> 03:41:37.320]  but again watch the global events that's telling you where things are going if things are really
[03:41:37.320 --> 03:41:44.600]  heating up to an explosive level right now in the middle east both gold and oil prices
[03:41:44.600 --> 03:41:51.400]  would be flying higher and they're not so that's how you look at the current events
[03:41:51.400 --> 03:42:00.920]  forming future trend so who really did this to these tankers out there iranians hey how about
[03:42:00.920 --> 03:42:08.440]  the Saudis they need oil at a hundred dollars a barrel but their economy to float along that's
[03:42:08.440 --> 03:42:17.880]  right and what's oil now Brent crude around sixty they have done it to boost the prices up maybe
[03:42:17.880 --> 03:42:24.360]  the united arab emirates how about over there and Kuwait can't wait you know Kuwait the temperature
[03:42:24.360 --> 03:42:32.760]  hit a hundred and twenty four point five degrees yep so that's what we're looking at the current
[03:42:32.760 --> 03:42:42.280]  events forming future trend gold and oil they're going to tell the story watch them closely again
[03:42:42.280 --> 03:42:49.320]  they should be spiking before it was going to break out in the middle east we'll be back in a
[03:42:49.320 --> 03:42:56.200]  few seconds in a few minutes see you in a bit info wars and free speech and your right to

[03:46:33.440 --> 03:46:59.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:03.440 --> 03:47:22.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:22.840 --> 03:47:28.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[03:47:28.840 --> 03:47:33.440]  Hello, hello. Welcome back, welcome back.
[03:47:33.440 --> 03:47:36.640]  Thanks for tuning into Infowars. Great being here.
[03:47:36.640 --> 03:47:39.840]  I'm a supporter of Infowars and their products.
[03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:41.440]  Again, my favorite.
[03:47:41.440 --> 03:47:45.440]  Many are supermailed by Talatiy.
[03:47:45.440 --> 03:47:48.040]  Because when you get to be an older cat, especially, you know,
[03:47:48.040 --> 03:47:53.440]  you need that extra juice to keep boogieing, you know?
[03:47:53.440 --> 03:47:55.040]  I love to boogie.
[03:47:55.040 --> 03:47:56.640]  No boogie anymore.
[03:47:56.640 --> 03:48:01.640]  But anyway, I was talking about the markets before.
[03:48:01.640 --> 03:48:06.640]  Merging markets cut rates on expectation of Fed easing.
[03:48:06.640 --> 03:48:15.640]  The Russian central bank just lowered their interest rates by a quarter percent.
[03:48:15.640 --> 03:48:21.640]  Since April, India, Malaysia, and the Philippines, all have lowered rates.
[03:48:21.640 --> 03:48:25.640]  China's central bank has taken steps to encourage more bank lending.
[03:48:25.640 --> 03:48:31.640]  As I was saying before, that trend is likely to broaden over coming months.
[03:48:31.640 --> 03:48:33.640]  This is the Wall Street Journal.
[03:48:33.640 --> 03:48:40.640]  Particularly if the Fed cuts its key rate, as officials have signaled it may.
[03:48:40.640 --> 03:48:43.640]  I say not signaled it may.
[03:48:43.640 --> 03:48:54.640]  I am forecasting that they will cut interest rates between four to six times by Election Day 2020.
[03:48:54.640 --> 03:48:57.640]  The Presidential Reality Show.
[03:48:57.640 --> 03:49:03.640]  Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, South Korea also ready to cut rates.
[03:49:03.640 --> 03:49:12.640]  Central banks are responding to signs that the global economy is losing momentum.
[03:49:12.640 --> 03:49:18.640]  The World Bank expects the global economy to expand 2.6 percent this year.
[03:49:18.640 --> 03:49:20.640]  They're blaming it on the trade wars.
[03:49:20.640 --> 03:49:22.640]  There's nothing to do with trade wars.
[03:49:22.640 --> 03:49:24.640]  It is no trade war.
[03:49:24.640 --> 03:49:30.640]  These are minor tariffs compared to the deficits.
[03:49:30.640 --> 03:49:35.640]  Tiny tariffs, I should say, compared to the deficits.
[03:49:35.640 --> 03:49:40.640]  I'll show you how the toilet paper over here.
[03:49:40.640 --> 03:49:43.640]  New York Times.
[03:49:43.640 --> 03:49:45.640]  Another front page story.
[03:49:45.640 --> 03:49:50.640]  Tariff threat has retailers warning of disaster.
[03:49:50.640 --> 03:49:52.640]  Whoa!
[03:49:52.640 --> 03:49:54.640]  Watch out for that disaster.
[03:49:54.640 --> 03:49:56.640]  You know what the disaster is?
[03:49:56.640 --> 03:50:03.640]  Well, even healthy chains like Walmart and Costco.
[03:50:03.640 --> 03:50:10.640]  The new duties threaten the business formula that helps speed their rapid rise over the last two decades.
[03:50:10.640 --> 03:50:20.640]  Import cheap products from Asia and sell them at rock bottom prices.
[03:50:20.640 --> 03:50:21.640]  Isn't that great?
[03:50:21.640 --> 03:50:24.640]  And these slimmers brag about that.
[03:50:24.640 --> 03:50:27.640]  We used to have products made here.
[03:50:27.640 --> 03:50:31.640]  Oh, yeah, you paid more money for them.
[03:50:31.640 --> 03:50:42.640]  You know why? Because you used to have a wage that paid a living that gave you a middle class.
[03:50:42.640 --> 03:50:46.640]  And you weren't one of those.
[03:50:46.640 --> 03:50:53.640]  Millennials net worth collapses, study finds.
[03:50:53.640 --> 03:50:56.640]  This is disgusting.
[03:50:56.640 --> 03:51:03.640]  The National Retail Federation estimates that China supplies 42% of all apparel.
[03:51:03.640 --> 03:51:07.640]  73% of household appliances.
[03:51:07.640 --> 03:51:12.640]  And 88% of the toys sold in the United States.
[03:51:12.640 --> 03:51:16.640]  Isn't that great, huh?
[03:51:16.640 --> 03:51:20.640]  Yeah, get that slave labor out there.
[03:51:20.640 --> 03:51:22.640]  Get them to make your products.
[03:51:22.640 --> 03:51:24.640]  Bring them back.
[03:51:24.640 --> 03:51:26.640]  Be a Walmart.
[03:51:26.640 --> 03:51:29.640]  Be the multi zillionaires.
[03:51:29.640 --> 03:51:36.640]  While you're working these places and you can't even have a living wage.
[03:51:36.640 --> 03:51:38.640]  Isn't that great?
[03:51:38.640 --> 03:51:41.640]  And they brag about that.
[03:51:41.640 --> 03:51:50.640]  Actually, over 90% of our clothing, they just talk about China is imported.
[03:51:50.640 --> 03:51:53.640]  They used to have make shoes.
[03:51:53.640 --> 03:51:56.640]  Remember in the city over here in New York.
[03:51:56.640 --> 03:52:01.640]  Garment district, 70th Avenue, going up and down the streets.
[03:52:01.640 --> 03:52:07.640]  Big racks of garments on.
[03:52:07.640 --> 03:52:11.640]  All over the country used to make our own things.
[03:52:11.640 --> 03:52:18.640]  And now it's disgusting according to the New York slime.
[03:52:18.640 --> 03:52:21.640]  Who wrote this piece of crap?
[03:52:21.640 --> 03:52:27.640]  It was in Schwartz and Sapna.
[03:52:27.640 --> 03:52:32.640]  Mahashwi, wherever you pronounce it.
[03:52:32.640 --> 03:52:35.640]  What a bunch of propaganda.
[03:52:35.640 --> 03:52:43.640]  Can you imagine the nerve that we should have manufacturing jobs that pay living wages?
[03:52:43.640 --> 03:52:48.640]  No, we got to make the Costco's bigger.
[03:52:48.640 --> 03:52:55.640]  We got to make them Home Depot. We can't make our own washing machines or dryers or irons.
[03:52:55.640 --> 03:52:57.640]  We can't make anything.
[03:52:57.640 --> 03:53:04.640]  We have to import it.
[03:53:04.640 --> 03:53:05.640]  That's right.
[03:53:05.640 --> 03:53:13.640]  So you could keep your job at Walmart and Amazon and other slave landia companies.
[03:53:13.640 --> 03:53:15.640]  So keep your mouth shut.
[03:53:15.640 --> 03:53:17.640]  Don't complain.
[03:53:17.640 --> 03:53:23.640]  Work on the multinational plantation in slave landia and behave yourself.
[03:53:23.640 --> 03:53:33.640]  Again, a big story, front page next to this stupid photograph of Draghi's head down the bottom.
[03:53:33.640 --> 03:53:35.640]  Look at this crap.
[03:53:35.640 --> 03:53:37.640]  They don't have reporters.
[03:53:37.640 --> 03:53:43.640]  They have prostitutes, prostitutes.
[03:53:43.640 --> 03:53:49.640]  The major story.
[03:53:49.640 --> 03:53:55.640]  Anyway, going back to the economy.
[03:53:55.640 --> 03:54:00.640]  I mentioned about the emerging markets and what's going on.
[03:54:00.640 --> 03:54:02.640]  Then you look around the world.
[03:54:02.640 --> 03:54:05.640]  Great what's going down here in Argentina, huh?
[03:54:05.640 --> 03:54:06.640]  Yep.
[03:54:06.640 --> 03:54:08.640]  Wonderful in Brazil.
[03:54:08.640 --> 03:54:11.640]  Hey, how about Venezuela?
[03:54:11.640 --> 03:54:13.640]  Take a trip to South Africa.
[03:54:13.640 --> 03:54:18.640]  One economy after another slowing down.
[03:54:18.640 --> 03:54:22.640]  Columbia's president says Austin Maduro is his moral duty.
[03:54:22.640 --> 03:54:23.640]  Isn't that great?
[03:54:23.640 --> 03:54:25.640]  Why don't you mind your own business, huh?
[03:54:25.640 --> 03:54:28.640]  Moral duty.
[03:54:28.640 --> 03:54:30.640]  There's economic warfare against Venezuela.
[03:54:30.640 --> 03:54:33.640]  I'm totally opposed with what's going on there.
[03:54:33.640 --> 03:54:35.640]  United States should mind its own business.
[03:54:35.640 --> 03:54:36.640]  Power outage.
[03:54:36.640 --> 03:54:38.640]  It's Argentina and Uruguay.
[03:54:38.640 --> 03:54:39.640]  All right?
[03:54:39.640 --> 03:54:41.640]  Mind your own business.
[03:54:41.640 --> 03:54:45.640]  Fix your own problems.
[03:54:45.640 --> 03:54:48.640]  You know the inflation rate is in Argentina?
[03:54:48.640 --> 03:54:50.640]  Almost 60 percent.
[03:54:50.640 --> 03:54:54.640]  The peso, the currency is down over 50 percent.
[03:54:54.640 --> 03:55:00.640]  Unemployment skyrocketing.
[03:55:00.640 --> 03:55:03.640]  This guy, Columbia, you know what his poll rating is?
[03:55:03.640 --> 03:55:05.640]  Recently around 20 percent.
[03:55:05.640 --> 03:55:08.640]  With all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:55:08.640 --> 03:55:10.640]  Oh, and they have a problem too, because the people leading
[03:55:10.640 --> 03:55:13.640]  Venezuela are going into Columbia.
[03:55:13.640 --> 03:55:16.640]  And then I want to mention this.
[03:55:16.640 --> 03:55:19.640]  Story in today's Wall Street Journal.
[03:55:19.640 --> 03:55:24.640]  Backing for impeachment inquiry, it's 27 percent.
[03:55:24.640 --> 03:55:27.640]  That's not a lot.
[03:55:27.640 --> 03:55:29.640]  Not good at math, but that's like a quarter, right?
[03:55:29.640 --> 03:55:32.640]  A little bit more.
[03:55:32.640 --> 03:55:37.640]  Impeachment is a waste of energy, a waste of time.
[03:55:37.640 --> 03:55:39.640]  Figure it out.
[03:55:39.640 --> 03:55:43.640]  You don't have to be good at math at it.
[03:55:43.640 --> 03:55:44.640]  Okay.
[03:55:44.640 --> 03:55:48.640]  The House impeaches Trump, and it goes to the Senate.
[03:55:48.640 --> 03:55:52.640]  And they got to say, we're firing you.
[03:55:52.640 --> 03:55:57.640]  You're fired, they'll say to the apprentice chief.
[03:55:57.640 --> 03:56:01.640]  Reality show champion.
[03:56:01.640 --> 03:56:04.640]  They need two thirds of the Senate vote.
[03:56:04.640 --> 03:56:08.640]  And you got a Republican majority in there.
[03:56:08.640 --> 03:56:11.640]  It's a waste of time and energy.
[03:56:11.640 --> 03:56:14.640]  And that's what the news media has become.
[03:56:14.640 --> 03:56:18.640]  Every day a stupid piece of worthless news.
[03:56:18.640 --> 03:56:23.640]  Not helping you to prepare for the future.
[03:56:23.640 --> 03:56:25.640]  And that's what we do.
[03:56:25.640 --> 03:56:29.640]  The Trends Journal.
[03:56:29.640 --> 03:56:32.640]  The future's coming.
[03:56:32.640 --> 03:56:34.640]  But you're not.
[03:56:34.640 --> 03:56:38.640]  But all the media is yesterday's news tomorrow.
[03:56:38.640 --> 03:56:42.640]  And again, that's why you need to support infowars.
[03:56:42.640 --> 03:56:44.640]  Buy the product.
[03:56:44.640 --> 03:56:48.640]  Put your money where your heart and mind are.
[03:56:48.640 --> 03:56:52.640]  Because if you don't, you're going to go down with dumb news.
[03:56:52.640 --> 03:56:54.640]  You can see these stories I read.
[03:56:54.640 --> 03:56:56.640]  You had it blaming the Russians.
[03:56:56.640 --> 03:56:59.640]  More and more censorship everywhere.
[03:56:59.640 --> 03:57:03.640]  More censorship, 2019, a top trend.
[03:57:03.640 --> 03:57:06.640]  Buy your infowars products.
[03:57:06.640 --> 03:57:10.640]  Take advantage of the sale going on now.
[03:57:10.640 --> 03:57:13.640]  Get the products while they last.
[03:57:13.640 --> 03:57:18.640]  Because if you don't, support infowars.
[03:57:18.640 --> 03:57:23.640]  The truth is going to be harder and harder to find.
[03:57:23.640 --> 03:57:27.640]  So I want to thank everybody for tuning in.
[03:57:27.640 --> 03:57:30.640]  If you look at the markets, look at gold and oil.
[03:57:30.640 --> 03:57:32.640]  Watch those key indicators.
[03:57:32.640 --> 03:57:34.640]  And one other one, copper.
[03:57:34.640 --> 03:57:37.640]  As goes copper, goes the global economy.
[03:57:37.640 --> 03:57:40.640]  Copper goes up, economy goes up.
[03:57:40.640 --> 03:57:43.640]  Copper goes down.
[03:57:43.640 --> 03:57:45.640]  Infowars.
[03:57:45.640 --> 03:57:48.640]  The most banned network in the world.
[03:57:48.640 --> 03:57:51.640]  Tom and Texas police officer on the border.
[03:57:51.640 --> 03:57:53.640]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[03:57:53.640 --> 03:57:54.640]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[03:57:54.640 --> 03:57:56.640]  Yes, sir. Thank you for taking my call.

[03:58:05.640 --> 03:58:06.640]  God bless you, brother.
[03:58:06.640 --> 03:58:09.640]  And I have three or four infowars bumper stickers in my glove box.
[03:58:09.640 --> 03:58:12.640]  Right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody
[03:58:12.640 --> 03:58:13.640]  just to help spread that word.
[03:58:13.640 --> 03:58:15.640]  You're our only hope, brother.
[03:58:15.640 --> 03:58:17.640]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[03:58:17.640 --> 03:58:19.640]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know,
