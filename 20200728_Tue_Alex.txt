[00:30.000 --> 00:49.560]  it is Tuesday July 28th the year is 2020 I'm your host Alex Jones coming to you
[00:49.560 --> 00:54.560]  from deep in the heart of Texas broadcasting worldwide I woke up at
[00:54.560 --> 01:00.400]  5 a.m. this morning to a text message I've been sent by constitutional lawyer
[01:00.400 --> 01:11.760]  Robert Barnes to a BBC article and above that tweet was a statement by another
[01:11.760 --> 01:16.720]  Twitter user that this is the line in the sand for so many people it's the
[01:16.720 --> 01:26.600]  line in the sand for me and so I'm gonna do my best job here today to calmly
[01:26.600 --> 01:31.240]  and proficiently lay this out but I have to tell you it despite the fact that I
[01:31.240 --> 01:37.920]  have been up since 5 a.m. researching preparing for this I have butterflies
[01:37.920 --> 01:45.760]  and I'm having trouble even being on air right now because there's so much data
[01:45.760 --> 01:51.120]  so much proof it's all totally confirmed to myself to you to everybody else and
[01:51.120 --> 02:00.480]  it is completely and absolutely evil diabolical and in our face and you can
[02:00.480 --> 02:08.760]  see every facet of this takeover plan that leads towards a medical tyranny
[02:08.760 --> 02:22.840]  that kills us via DNA altering soft kill slow kill so-called vaccines and the
[02:22.840 --> 02:33.080]  level of lies is just getting over the top and so I really am going to do my
[02:33.080 --> 02:43.920]  best job going over all of this today now
[02:48.840 --> 03:02.600]  when we come back I am going to air Bill Gates on CNN with Anderson Cooper and
[03:02.600 --> 03:05.240]  it's about a three and a half minute video and I'm gonna try to not stop it
[03:05.240 --> 03:12.400]  start it too much but it is so deceptive and so evil and so out in the open
[03:12.400 --> 03:17.200]  about its deception it's evil it's simply mind-blowing and then there's the
[03:17.200 --> 03:21.720]  other Gates interview from CBS this weekend we played yesterday where they're
[03:21.720 --> 03:26.360]  saying hey a hundred percent of people in one of your vaccine trials got sick and
[03:26.360 --> 03:31.640]  the other vaccine trials 80% some of them paralyzed and Gates is like well
[03:31.640 --> 03:35.680]  it's no big deal you're gonna take the vaccines so they're even telling you
[03:35.680 --> 03:40.320]  what's gonna hurt you and it doesn't even protect you and he is so obviously
[03:40.320 --> 03:46.000]  psychotic and evil and he wants the global depopulation and he hangs around
[03:46.000 --> 03:56.840]  with Jeffrey Epstein and then he is going on Anderson Cooper of Vanderbilt
[03:56.840 --> 04:00.520]  the Vanderbilt air another globalist probably Richard and Gates their
[04:00.520 --> 04:06.240]  money's hidden and says it's crazy we're not connected as Jeffrey Epstein even
[04:06.240 --> 04:11.320]  though both of them are Bill Gates would live at his house in Paris and New
[04:11.320 --> 04:16.600]  York for sometimes weeks on end and he's all over the ledgers of the Lolita
[04:16.600 --> 04:19.960]  pedophile airplane Express
[04:21.600 --> 04:28.720]  meanwhile you've got the president being censored and Don Jr. is in Twitter
[04:28.720 --> 04:34.040]  jail his account locked up because they quote put out that hydroxychloroquine
[04:34.040 --> 04:39.160]  helps with COVID-19 infections there's hundreds of studies saying it because the
[04:39.160 --> 04:43.880]  UN says that's not true so the president our president's tweets deleted
[04:43.880 --> 04:51.280]  because the UN says that's not the case think about that we're under UN
[04:51.280 --> 04:56.320]  controlled and our president's battling just to get some some semblance of
[04:56.320 --> 05:01.760]  American control the bad news is Western governments have totally let
[05:01.760 --> 05:06.240]  multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net
[05:06.240 --> 05:11.560]  surveillance censorship with AI the good news is they had to do that to carry
[05:11.560 --> 05:17.120]  out this world government COVID takeover this planetary corporate reset the
[05:17.120 --> 05:21.840]  cover covers for because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will
[05:21.840 --> 05:27.520]  smash them and the good news is they're still sites like band video news wars
[05:27.520 --> 05:33.000]  dot com info wars dot com all watching sites summit dot news and a lot of other
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.200]  great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of
[05:37.200 --> 05:44.640]  mouth that is king that is queen that is the master of our own destinies ladies
[05:44.640 --> 05:48.960]  and gentlemen there is a war on reality a war on civilization a war on our health
[05:48.960 --> 05:53.880]  a war on our economy but being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking
[05:53.880 --> 06:21.140]  out against it will defeat it so take action or be slaves it is Tuesday
[06:21.140 --> 06:30.240]  July 28th the year is 2020 we are 97 days out from the election as the forces of
[06:30.240 --> 06:36.000]  globalism the communist Chinese the EU Hollywood the Fortune 100 openly battle
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.640]  to trigger race war and the collapse of the US dollar goals is exploded to a
[06:41.640 --> 06:49.840]  all-time high at $2,000 announced as every major financial publication calls
[06:49.840 --> 06:55.840]  for the end of the dollar and the end of American hegemonic power in the world
[06:55.840 --> 07:03.240]  to be replaced with the world champions of tyranny mass murder genetic
[07:03.240 --> 07:09.280]  engineering the communist Chinese super state the average American has been
[07:09.280 --> 07:15.840]  promised they will live austerely as slaves once we're collapsed that's what
[07:15.840 --> 07:20.640]  the globalists actually say they're going to do but the professors at the
[07:20.640 --> 07:24.520]  community colleges tell all the young commies you're going to rule as
[07:24.520 --> 07:31.760]  managers in the new utopia and the meth heads that's who they mainly aren't
[07:31.760 --> 07:37.840]  anti-fun black lives matter they're mainly white they then get completely
[07:37.840 --> 07:42.520]  excited about the whole thing and run around start shooting men women and
[07:42.520 --> 07:46.400]  children and shooting police in the head and they're called peaceful demonstrators
[07:46.400 --> 07:53.440]  as they burn down courthouses and try to burn down federal buildings and we're
[07:53.440 --> 08:04.280]  told that this is martial law by Trump in his feeble gilded lackluster soft soap
[08:04.280 --> 08:12.080]  response this is how republics die when the mouse of the new world order that
[08:12.080 --> 08:17.600]  roared intimidates the mighty lion this is like a chihuahua coming up and
[08:17.600 --> 08:21.920]  growling in a pit bull and the pit bull rolls over and urinates all over itself
[08:21.920 --> 08:27.040]  but many times that's actually what happens because we've been trained to
[08:27.040 --> 08:34.040]  appease the establishment when the communist Chinese the EU and Soros
[08:34.040 --> 08:41.200]  publicly fund violent radicals Google engineers professors assistant
[08:41.200 --> 08:47.560]  professors drug dealers bureaucrats they're all out in black uniforms hitting
[08:47.560 --> 08:52.000]  men women and children in the head with hammers and throwing mall off cocktails
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.640]  but that's okay it's kind of like you know Tim Cook runs death camps in China
[08:56.640 --> 09:01.040]  making components for his phones on record he's the worst offender but it's
[09:01.040 --> 09:06.400]  okay he wears little black t-shirts and crances around and goes I'm gay I'm gay
[09:06.400 --> 09:12.960]  this is all their smokescreen for their vicious evil we have a special guest in
[09:12.960 --> 09:20.240]  studio next segment that really symbolizes our entire future and where
[09:20.240 --> 09:28.360]  we are as a species and then I would suggest you call your neighbors your
[09:28.360 --> 09:33.040]  friends your family your co-workers your boss your employees your church friends

[09:45.880 --> 09:52.960]  what's coming next and if you want to understand the permanent scientific
[09:52.960 --> 09:58.680]  medical dictatorship we're going under that is designed to depopulate the
[09:58.680 --> 10:05.040]  planet then you need to tune in to info wars.com port slash show news wars.com

[10:21.080 --> 10:26.640]  Tuesday live Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announces planned to
[10:26.640 --> 10:33.720]  microchip everyone on earth BBC News and others are celebrating the brave new
[10:33.720 --> 10:41.640]  world of forced inoculations contact tracers and Mark of the Beast rebranded
[10:41.640 --> 10:47.520]  digital tattoos. Now I'm going to read to you from the BBC article and others
[10:47.520 --> 10:54.960]  but what's so amazing is there's been a rollout at MIT BBC USA Today a bunch of
[10:54.960 --> 11:00.880]  other tech publications and I went this morning and spent an hour and a half just
[11:00.880 --> 11:05.200]  checking the authors all of them have written for the UN MIT and Bill Gates
[11:05.200 --> 11:12.080]  and they all write exclusively on devices in your home that spy on you like
[11:12.080 --> 11:18.320]  smart toilets and street lights that watch and listen to you and now the
[11:18.320 --> 11:22.480]  digital tattoo that's sewn into your skin it's imprinted on your skin you
[11:22.480 --> 11:26.320]  stick a sticker on you that's got little micro pieces of glass that have
[11:26.320 --> 11:33.120]  miniaturized tech chips in them that work their way into your skin so you
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.080]  can't get them out and then this is the proof you'll need to fly on an airplane
[11:38.080 --> 11:43.320]  now remember six months ago we came on there and said that and it got huge
[11:43.320 --> 11:48.400]  traction and so you saw every major publication in the country Washington
[11:48.400 --> 11:54.600]  Post New York Times all of us say Alex Jones is evil Bill Gates does not want
[11:54.600 --> 11:59.000]  you to take a digital tattoo it doesn't exist that's because we were telling
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.320]  you before they launched it publicly they didn't want you to have a mental note
[12:03.320 --> 12:08.040]  that it was negative now in these articles they link to the MIT and Rice
[12:08.040 --> 12:15.280]  University and they link to Google's under the skin ship they link to all of
[12:15.280 --> 12:22.520]  it and they go isn't it wonderful they even mention Bill Gates cares about you
[12:22.520 --> 12:30.080]  so much he's got a global plan with the United Nations and you notice it's
[12:30.080 --> 12:38.960]  already the United Nations that tells us our policies on on COVID-19 everything
[12:38.960 --> 12:42.200]  else for that matter when President Trump tweets a bunch of doctors in front
[12:42.200 --> 12:45.960]  of the Capitol say they had great response to hydroxychloroquine Twitter
[12:45.960 --> 12:53.120]  bans the president's tweet puts his son in Twitter jail and says that was not
[12:53.120 --> 13:00.480]  authorized by the WHO that is not seen as medically approved information so now
[13:00.480 --> 13:05.480]  medical doctors with medical degrees go to Washington to lobby on their own
[13:05.480 --> 13:10.280]  money and say here are hundreds of studies about hydroxychloroquine and
[13:10.280 --> 13:15.560]  here's how it helps you and here's how we have 99% success rates not just with
[13:15.560 --> 13:20.200]  COVID-19 but other pneumonias and flus and the president tweets a 40 minute
[13:20.200 --> 13:30.000]  video of the press conference that the doctors have a diverse group and they
[13:30.000 --> 13:37.120]  say that is not approved treatment by the WHO Fox News reports it's CNN you
[13:37.120 --> 13:42.320]  just wake up one day and the U.N. censors the president of the United
[13:42.320 --> 13:47.400]  States and dozens of medical doctors at a press conference in front of the
[13:47.400 --> 13:51.760]  Capitol and why not in the last few months they've censored all these other
[13:51.760 --> 13:55.240]  clinic owners and medical doctors and epidemiologists and scientists in the
[13:55.240 --> 14:01.560]  heads of University epidemiology and virology departments at Rockefeller
[14:01.560 --> 14:07.400]  University and so many others and now they're going in and pulling out peer
[14:07.400 --> 14:12.520]  reviewed studies going back years ago about hydroxychloroquine and they are
[14:12.520 --> 14:18.120]  taking it down because they are so upset that this is challenging them because
[14:18.120 --> 14:21.080]  they want you to take a forced inoculation old people have to take
[14:21.080 --> 14:26.040]  five young people have to take two then you have medical testers that keep
[14:26.040 --> 14:29.440]  coming to your house testing you that are part of the U.N. operation under the
[14:29.440 --> 14:33.040]  Clinton Global Initiative under Bill and Melinda Gates this is your new
[14:33.040 --> 14:39.600]  controllers the enforcers they come to your house and then when you go to the
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.720]  airport you have to be you put a scanner in your mouth that actually put a cord
[14:44.720 --> 14:49.640]  in your mouth like idiocracy and you breathe into it and then it decides if
[14:49.640 --> 14:54.240]  you can fly or not even though most the time it's a false positive and then
[14:54.240 --> 15:01.600]  you're grabbed and put in quarantines so they don't know what to do ladies and
[15:01.600 --> 15:08.680]  gentlemen they are forcing all of this on you in a big big way and people been
[15:08.680 --> 15:12.200]  resisting and saying no and the UN's own scientists came out in December at the
[15:12.200 --> 15:15.480]  WHO and said that they had other vaccine program and said we don't test this
[15:15.480 --> 15:20.080]  Gates just tells us what to do our doctors say it's hurting people and
[15:20.080 --> 15:23.680]  killing them the front lines wobbly we don't know what to do well the answer is
[15:23.680 --> 15:26.320]  they're just doubling down and Gates comes out and says okay it'll kill a
[15:26.320 --> 15:28.840]  bunch of people it'll hurt a bunch of people you don't have a choice you're
[15:28.840 --> 15:32.160]  taking it and you're not gonna leave your house or have a job or go in a store
[15:32.160 --> 15:35.920]  or find an airplane till you have this app on your phone saying that you've
[15:35.920 --> 15:40.840]  checked out and you don't have COVID and everything they've said has been a
[15:40.840 --> 15:46.120]  fraud the lie and this is their big global move against everybody and we've
[15:46.120 --> 15:49.840]  got the proof we're gonna read over this shocking BBC report basically put out
[15:49.840 --> 15:53.600]  by Gates telling you how you're gonna take a digital microchip under your
[15:53.600 --> 15:56.760]  skin don't leave your house
[15:56.960 --> 16:02.400]  imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020 the
[16:02.400 --> 16:06.320]  Democrats as well as many Republican leaders will be calling for the United
[16:06.320 --> 16:13.320]  Nations WHO edict that all Americans wear masks be a quote federal order and
[16:13.320 --> 16:20.400]  mandate totally unconstitutional annihilating states rights think about
[16:20.400 --> 16:25.720]  that a woman can kill her baby you pay for illegal aliens health care but you've
[16:25.720 --> 16:30.840]  got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20 plus times less than what they
[16:30.840 --> 16:36.000]  said even if you believe the official story this is about the WHO the global
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.800]  is testing their power through the media over the federal government to set
[16:40.800 --> 16:45.880]  policy in the United States this is our punishment for not going with the carbon
[16:45.880 --> 16:49.960]  taxes and the Paris Accord and all of it and by the way they admit that they say
[16:49.960 --> 16:56.760]  now your carbons down one way or another you stupid Americans
[16:56.760 --> 17:03.480]  CNN USA Today and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out and said that
[17:03.480 --> 17:08.600]  a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings
[17:08.600 --> 17:14.320]  standing on top of an American flag is Nazi and they had the Soros funded
[17:14.320 --> 17:19.280]  snopes groups and others fact-checking to say yes now the American flag and yes
[17:19.280 --> 17:23.640]  the American eagle are not she's no George Soros that funds snopes and media
[17:23.640 --> 17:28.920]  matters the rest of them he's the real Nazi collaborator but this shirt I
[17:28.920 --> 17:32.000]  think is really the perfect campaign shirts we make one even better than
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.240]  what Trump's people came up with two different versions of it wins something
[17:35.240 --> 17:40.720]  even worse the Betsy Ross flag her first flag that they also say is racist even
[17:40.720 --> 17:45.120]  though she was a famous abolitionist so these shirts are an info wars dot com
[17:45.120 --> 17:49.480]  they're the American eagle that's the Ross flags two different designs guaranteed
[17:49.480 --> 17:53.120]  to spread the word and of course trigger lift hearts everywhere exercise your
[17:53.120 --> 17:57.680]  first amendment or lose it before store.com

[19:29.400 --> 19:33.040]  make of them what do you think wanting to forcibly inoculate this little guy
[19:33.040 --> 19:38.160]  before he can get on an airplane I don't agree that it makes me just want to keep
[19:38.160 --> 19:43.800]  them in a little bubble but at the same time you know they're just trying to
[19:43.800 --> 19:48.320]  create a world for him like kind of what we had before well that's it they're
[19:48.320 --> 19:50.920]  bringing in this dystopia people said well don't have kids no we're gonna have

[19:55.360 --> 20:00.200]  exactly because we believe in a pro-human future absolutely now we're gonna
[20:00.200 --> 20:06.800]  say your baby's name but he's not named Bill Gates Jr. no now I know it's close
[20:06.800 --> 20:12.960]  to his bedtime but he is a sweetheart he is he's such a good boy and no vaccines
[20:12.960 --> 20:18.920]  huh nope and completely healthy never been sick he's good to go I know you see
[20:18.920 --> 20:22.200]  these children without all the vaccines most of them can't talk they've got
[20:22.200 --> 20:25.680]  gut problems they got black circles around their eyes very sad it is you
[20:25.680 --> 20:29.080]  can really tell in their eyes you know when it is they just kind of look like
[20:29.080 --> 20:36.040]  something's missing but him nope they've had the Gates procedure done that's
[20:36.040 --> 20:39.440]  pretty cold-blooded to do that to folks isn't it secret medical experimentation
[20:39.440 --> 20:42.480]  you know now they're trying to get most little boys to say they're girls and
[20:42.480 --> 20:46.040]  sterilize them with chemicals that's more abuse from Bill Gates yeah I just
[20:46.040 --> 20:50.480]  know not happening over here because this is a little boy I know that's a
[20:50.480 --> 20:54.040]  thought crowd that's a boy right there you can tell people meet him and they're
[20:54.040 --> 20:57.800]  like I can tell he's a boy well you're committing the thought crime there young
[20:57.800 --> 21:02.000]  lady we're gonna have to hand him over to some social workers they'll teach you
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.600]  when he's a girl yeah I know why do you think you're targeting boys so much in
[21:05.600 --> 21:08.320]  this modern system
[21:09.760 --> 21:14.920]  well because they're they're the ones that you know help recreate little babies
[21:14.920 --> 21:19.720]  like this and they don't want children that's that they're targeting men and
[21:19.720 --> 21:23.600]  women they're targeting the whole species oh yeah well how would you define the
[21:23.600 --> 21:27.960]  globalist I mean they act like aliens to me they don't act like they're humans
[21:27.960 --> 21:33.400]  no aliens for sure so tellin tellin does a great job writing for us I don't
[21:33.400 --> 21:35.440]  usually have people from the same family working here but we have it with
[21:35.440 --> 21:38.880]  David Knight and his son Travis does a great job now his other sons come to
[21:38.880 --> 21:42.600]  work with us and then you've got you've got Darren McBrain so that's three
[21:42.600 --> 21:45.760]  generations you got Darren tellin announced little little sweets are here

[22:31.320 --> 22:35.240]  and the thing is is you know we surprised you asked you to come in here and
[22:35.240 --> 22:40.440]  bring EJ we don't even want to we live in a climate right now where we don't
[22:40.440 --> 22:44.840]  even want to say their names because you never know we talked about this
[22:44.840 --> 22:49.520]  earlier it could be a year from now and they find out that he was on the Alex
[22:49.520 --> 22:55.800]  Jones show we live in a culture now where child protective services might get
[22:55.800 --> 22:59.240]  involved hey what do you mean he hasn't been vaccinated you know flagged or
[22:59.240 --> 23:02.720]  something what happened tell us a little bit about how the nurses tried to get
[23:02.720 --> 23:08.840]  him the vaccines when he was first born just constantly coming in the room hey
[23:08.840 --> 23:13.120]  are you sure you didn't want this you know it does this and this and this and
[23:13.120 --> 23:18.320]  like no we actually did our research and we have a plan I just kind of instead
[23:18.320 --> 23:21.480]  of denying it I just said I'm gonna get it later yeah you know I kind of
[23:21.480 --> 23:25.760]  postponed it per se just so they would kind of get off our backs and what
[23:25.760 --> 23:28.440]  Kellan would do too is I remember that because they would have to take him
[23:28.440 --> 23:32.640]  behind the curtain and he he would say open the curtain I want to see everything
[23:32.640 --> 23:37.520]  you do I want to see everything you're doing all the little tests yeah they
[23:37.520 --> 23:41.120]  will they will see really and I was just let him out of our site just okay it's
[23:41.120 --> 23:45.920]  talking to David Knight just before it came on and they were he was talking
[23:45.920 --> 23:51.280]  about somebody that she had a C-section and they removed they removed the child
[23:51.280 --> 23:56.280]  and then they tested her and she tested positive for COVID-19 so then they took
[23:56.280 --> 24:00.720]  the child and she hadn't seen the child for a month oh my goodness so child
[24:00.720 --> 24:04.800]  protective services and this whole thing and hospitals and of course the
[24:04.800 --> 24:08.680]  Bill Gates thing where they're trying to push this vaccine on everyone it's very
[24:08.680 --> 24:12.840]  dangerous we live in dangerous times but this is our future right here that's my
[24:12.840 --> 24:18.280]  special boy and yeah we just got to fight this with everything we've got
[24:18.280 --> 24:22.240]  well I mean that's it they want the precedent that the government rules
[24:22.240 --> 24:25.840]  your children and that's why the UN has said we want to come in and take your
[24:25.840 --> 24:29.680]  children that's our main mission and now the Clintons with Bill Gates run the
[24:29.680 --> 24:33.400]  contact tracers that are coming to people's houses they're beta testing in
[24:33.400 --> 24:36.920]  blue cities the dystopia is here folks they have the enforcers everything
[24:36.920 --> 24:40.200]  they're coming I mean they now say officially Bill Gates came out and said
[24:40.200 --> 24:45.040]  to have a job to go in a store or to find an airplane you will have to have a
[24:45.040 --> 24:48.400]  digital ID and plant it in your skin I'm gonna cover it next segment it's here
[24:48.400 --> 24:53.760]  that's right contact tracing and and you know did you show because I saw in the
[24:53.760 --> 24:57.920]  show folder where the lady got kicked off the plane for not wearing a mask and
[24:57.920 --> 25:01.920]  everybody's clapping everybody's clapping so that's gonna be applauded and
[25:01.920 --> 25:05.240]  it's the same kind of and I don't have by the way I have no idea when we're
[25:05.240 --> 25:14.600]  going to commercial so but look another conversation I had with David Knight
[25:14.600 --> 25:20.560]  earlier I feel like right now and we're approaching August 2020 November is
[25:20.560 --> 25:28.400]  coming and I'm just I'm thinking we're not gonna recognize this country and in
[25:28.400 --> 25:33.760]  November I mean so I really feel like I'm I'm in the forest and I see the
[25:33.760 --> 25:40.000]  birds and the trees flying off afraid also deer are running past me all the
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.040]  animals are afraid something's coming something's coming it's gonna be huge so

[30:35.880 --> 30:42.280]  who they are we know their plan thanks to God these revelations we know how to
[30:42.280 --> 30:54.040]  stop them all right ladies and gentlemen let's get right into it there are so
[30:54.040 --> 30:58.080]  many facets to this but I'm gonna cut right to the chase and then go through
[30:58.080 --> 31:07.600]  the details Bill Gates and Microsoft and Google have been all over the news in
[31:07.600 --> 31:14.680]  the last decade trying to come out with injectable nano microchips that are
[31:14.680 --> 31:18.320]  actually in vaccines or that they give you after to show you've had a vaccine
[31:18.320 --> 31:24.600]  and notice that this week suddenly there's Reuters and Wired magazine Google
[31:24.600 --> 31:31.440]  comes out with digital tattoos and there's big articles on Microsoft.com
[31:31.440 --> 31:39.440]  about digital tattoos and how incredibly great they're going to be and how we
[31:39.440 --> 31:47.400]  all need to get them but remember five months ago six months ago we were
[31:47.400 --> 31:56.520]  showing you MIT and we were showing you all these different publications where
[31:56.520 --> 32:01.920]  they were saying Bill Gates funded us to create something that's a digital tattoo
[32:01.920 --> 32:06.520]  that you put a sticker on your arm a bandage and has little micro pieces of
[32:06.520 --> 32:13.240]  glass or metal that work into your body and that stay inside your body that we
[32:13.240 --> 32:16.560]  can then scan because they can put so much data now in just something that's
[32:16.560 --> 32:20.960]  smaller than a grain of sand that are inside each piece of glass well the
[32:20.960 --> 32:24.440]  public got upset about this we said hey they're gonna come out with contact
[32:24.440 --> 32:27.840]  tracers run by the UN the limo and the Gates Foundation I didn't know it was a
[32:27.840 --> 32:33.720]  Clinton Foundation involved too even worse but in partnership with them and
[32:33.720 --> 32:37.080]  they're going to make you take these digital tattoos these digital chips
[32:37.080 --> 32:44.880]  mark of the beast rebranded to prove you're a good little globalist and to be
[32:44.880 --> 32:52.440]  able to first get on airplanes then to have a job to go into a supermarket well
[32:52.440 --> 33:00.240]  ladies and gentlemen overnight the BBC and Microsoft and in Daria I see you the
[33:00.240 --> 33:04.680]  link I didn't see that in my stack but also texting a link to the pull that up
[33:04.680 --> 33:11.080]  to Microsoft comm and quote digital tattoos so you can have data in your
[33:11.080 --> 33:16.600]  skin access information proof you've had a vaccine medical record all that so my
[33:16.600 --> 33:20.800]  point is I'm gonna show you some of these articles right now but this is all
[33:20.800 --> 33:33.760]  being announced but remember just a few months ago there it is Microsoft comm
[33:33.760 --> 33:43.360]  smart tattoos so we come out and we expose what they're doing what they're
[33:43.360 --> 33:48.360]  up to in January February March and April lay out exactly what they were
[33:48.360 --> 33:51.880]  going to do because we had operation lockstep by the Rockefellers 10 years
[33:51.880 --> 33:57.320]  old exactly letting us out and we had event 201 from October November of last
[33:57.320 --> 34:03.960]  year laying out exactly what they've done through the United Nations in
[34:03.960 --> 34:07.400]  control of the United States and the rest of the world dictating our health
[34:07.400 --> 34:16.320]  policy and they had every publication for financial times to the LA Times to
[34:16.320 --> 34:22.240]  wired come out and say Bill Gates is under attack by liars there are no
[34:22.240 --> 34:26.240]  digital tattoos there is no plan to make you take take vaccines to travel
[34:26.240 --> 34:34.480]  none of this is true even though they were already proposing it and they
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.080]  didn't coordinate their propaganda first they come out in February March and
[34:38.080 --> 34:43.240]  say we're lying about it but then Fauci and the UN say oh we do want you to have
[34:43.240 --> 34:46.800]  a digital passport or a chip under your skin to prove you've done it and so
[34:46.800 --> 34:52.600]  people went whoa you just said you weren't doing that so now three or four
[34:52.600 --> 34:57.160]  months later they think you don't have a memory they have announced on the
[34:57.160 --> 35:01.200]  Microsoft website I just showed it to the viewers they have put out in the BBC
[35:01.200 --> 35:08.000]  a lady it turns out writes for Gates and the Foundation exactly how they're
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.480]  gonna run it and when you read this BBC article it will make your head spin we
[35:13.480 --> 35:16.560]  posted the full thing and in four words calm just try to change your take it
[35:16.560 --> 35:20.400]  down we have a link to the BBC article our headline is forced inoculation
[35:20.400 --> 35:28.480]  microchipping pushed by UK state-run media the actual headline at BBC by
[35:28.480 --> 35:35.280]  Lena Zeldovich who looks like the Wicked Witch of the West and works for these
[35:35.280 --> 35:39.400]  people physicists engineers biology citizen scientists are devising new
[35:39.400 --> 35:45.880]  technologies and tests a weakened globe trot again and she says by 2022 you will
[35:45.880 --> 35:49.960]  get off an airplane a robot will scan you he will then go to the counter and they
[35:49.960 --> 35:55.080]  will put a device pod in your mouth that scans you for COVID or other diseases
[35:55.080 --> 35:59.840]  you'll be taken away if you do have it quarantine but it's no big deal you
[35:59.840 --> 36:03.320]  understand for your safety and then she just goes through how to buy and sell and
[36:03.320 --> 36:07.200]  live your life you're gonna have this and Gates has all the patents now they're
[36:07.200 --> 36:11.000]  gonna use this ID for the global medical ID and they say they're gonna have all
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.480]  seven and a half billion people chipped but don't worry they'll give you money
[36:15.480 --> 36:19.640]  to get chipped and how don't worry it's just a patch you put on your arm you
[36:19.640 --> 36:25.920]  might have a rash but now you're gonna have nanotech in your body it is a long
[36:25.920 --> 36:33.360]  article I suggest you go read this for yourself oh and it's how easy it is you
[36:33.360 --> 36:41.560]  just blow in this little you just blow on this little thing and it's all medical
[36:41.560 --> 36:46.280]  tyranny right there at the airport and of course this doesn't stop diseases
[36:46.280 --> 36:49.280]  spreading are the ones letting people in from the third world untested or the
[36:49.280 --> 36:53.080]  ones that let all the TB and we have 1.4 million deaths a year by it
[36:53.080 --> 36:57.080]  the bubonic plague coming in on the black America no no no this is all about
[36:57.080 --> 37:02.200]  you complying you submitting because they say you have to have this you have
[37:02.200 --> 37:07.960]  to have a vaccine to travel and now Fauci and all of them admit wearing the
[37:07.960 --> 37:17.400]  mask is a symbol of your compliance wear the mask accept the contact traces in
[37:17.400 --> 37:20.560]  your house accept the apps on your phone that are already on your phone
[37:20.560 --> 37:24.800]  Apple and Google announced it six months ago that they'd merged an operating
[37:24.800 --> 37:32.600]  system on all phones that is a hidden app that cannot be deleted that tracks
[37:32.600 --> 37:38.360]  everywhere you go and everything you do but then when the FBI has a warrant to
[37:38.360 --> 37:42.120]  get to somebody's phone they won't give it to them because again they're bigger
[37:42.120 --> 37:44.720]  than the federal government they're bigger than the Justice Department they're
[37:44.720 --> 37:49.120]  the new government they're the global government and see Bill Clinton left
[37:49.120 --> 37:52.320]  office he'd always talked about me the new Secretary General the UN well now
[37:52.320 --> 37:56.320]  he's just the global initiative head it's like the Bill and the Gates Foundation
[37:56.320 --> 38:00.640]  it's above the UN so you have the Rockefeller Foundation the Bill and the
[38:00.640 --> 38:03.760]  Gates Foundation the Clinton global initiative and it's these three groups
[38:03.760 --> 38:12.240]  with John Hopkins and Fauci on record in the event 201 document that create
[38:12.240 --> 38:16.760]  global policy that's been given to the United Nations as the global corporate
[38:16.760 --> 38:24.720]  government that then gives us the orders and then we're coming to swing it back
[38:24.720 --> 38:30.960]  the president tweets a press conference of more than a dozen doctors medical
[38:30.960 --> 38:38.720]  doctors virologist epidemiologist it goes viral it gets millions of views in
[38:38.720 --> 38:43.160]  hours the president tweets it and just like all the other doctors and scientists
[38:43.160 --> 38:46.760]  that have come out and Cedar Sinai that's come out prestigious doctors
[38:46.760 --> 38:53.440]  virologist heads of universities it got deleted the video and the tweets blocked
[38:53.440 --> 38:57.400]  everywhere and they're in the news saying good they stood up to disinfo
[38:57.400 --> 39:02.120]  because the WHO the World Health Organization is the authority and they
[39:02.120 --> 39:06.360]  say hydroxychloroquine doesn't work because they have one study that was
[39:06.360 --> 39:10.320]  withdrawn that was funded by the Bill and the Gates Foundation I'm gonna show
[39:10.320 --> 39:15.600]  you when we come back even NBC News admitting that the study they use to
[39:15.600 --> 39:19.280]  say hydroxychloroquine has no effect when all the other studies say 99%
[39:19.280 --> 39:24.640]  miracle drug because it injects zinc through the cell membrane that then
[39:24.640 --> 39:31.240]  viruses can't replicate in the mitochondria and they don't want you to
[39:31.240 --> 39:34.920]  know that because they want you desperate and scared and locked down so you
[39:34.920 --> 39:38.960]  will accept the vaccine the digital world ID and boom you're inside the world
[39:38.960 --> 39:43.720]  government under medical tyranny directed by the UN itself directed by the
[39:43.720 --> 39:50.280]  shadow secretary general the UN Bill and Hillary Clinton Hillary didn't need to
[39:50.280 --> 39:54.560]  be president she's head of the UN stay with us
[39:54.560 --> 39:58.800]  another part of the Great Awakening was taking place is people that haven't
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.360]  even been religious or Christian now see how evil is out in the open how
[40:03.360 --> 40:08.680]  hundreds of churches have been burned in Europe and the US hundreds of Christian
[40:08.680 --> 40:12.960]  icons have been burned destroyed Jesus has had their heads cut off all over the
[40:12.960 --> 40:15.400]  country all over the Philippines all over Europe
[40:15.400 --> 40:19.240]  Virgin Mary's are getting torn down I mean crosses are being torn down it's
[40:19.240 --> 40:23.880]  absolutely out of control but people now understand that evil was always real
[40:23.880 --> 40:29.440]  it is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move building beneath the
[40:29.440 --> 40:33.000]  surface and now it's emerged that's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.040]  prayer I mean it I'm praying for America I'm praying for you and I know the power
[40:37.040 --> 40:41.160]  prayers real and God hears it we need to come together and pray for even greater
[40:41.160 --> 40:46.240]  awakening pray for Donald Trump to be protected pray for him to win a landslide

[47:26.840 --> 47:32.360]  toothpaste activated charcoal pure activated charcoal that is enamel safe
[47:32.360 --> 47:36.400]  it does not attack your enamel it does not erode your teeth like many other
[47:36.400 --> 47:39.600]  toothpaste that are full of fillers and many other charcoal toothpaste
[47:39.600 --> 47:42.560]  charcoal toothpaste are extremely popular this is not meant to replace our
[47:42.560 --> 47:47.440]  other two toothpaste that we hope to bring back soon but you've seen the left
[47:47.440 --> 47:50.720]  is trying to shut us down for those they have nano silver in them this has
[47:50.720 --> 47:54.280]  nothing to do with COVID-19 the others the other toothpaste don't either the
[47:54.280 --> 47:58.000]  left just tries to confuse everything and deceive people so this is not a
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.280]  replacement for that we've been developing this for over a year and it's
[48:02.280 --> 48:06.560]  very very popular we sold out of one-tenth of it yesterday won't be
[48:06.560 --> 48:09.960]  getting more till the end of August so this will sell out very very soon
[48:09.960 --> 48:12.200]  probably because people won't take advantage of the free shipping because
[48:12.200 --> 48:19.800]  with the free shipping Tim Perger pointed out to me yesterday said hey boss we
[48:19.800 --> 48:25.240]  sell the toothpaste for nine dollars and it cost us three dollars and shipping is
[48:25.240 --> 48:28.720]  basically five dollars we're making it like a dollar fifty we cannot operate on
[48:28.720 --> 48:32.320]  that yeah we sold a thousand tubes of toothpaste that's a thousand dollars
[48:32.320 --> 48:36.440]  that doesn't run anything with an operation that's big you've got to stop
[48:36.440 --> 48:40.600]  the free shipping and yeah I can't compete against Amazon and then the four
[48:40.600 --> 48:44.240]  and a half dollars they get for every order that they get from you know a
[48:44.240 --> 48:48.440]  taxpayer bailout in the 30 billion he got basis got a taxpayer money during all
[48:48.440 --> 48:51.600]  this I mean we don't get any of that and so we don't have all the taxpayers
[48:51.600 --> 48:54.280]  subsidies so when you think you're getting something for cheaper there
[48:54.280 --> 48:58.320]  you're not folks you're paying for it I'm ranting I'm gonna stop right there it's
[48:58.320 --> 49:00.960]  just a very frustrating so thank you all for your support I would take a van to
[49:00.960 --> 49:03.200]  the sale because there's not gonna be anything like it till Christmas just as
[49:03.200 --> 49:08.640]  we can't afford it so thank you for the support okay Rob dude didn't think he'd
[49:08.640 --> 49:12.360]  have this done but until the third hour and have a special guest role scouts and
[49:12.360 --> 49:17.760]  in studio for two hours but he does think you'll have it done by six after
[49:17.760 --> 49:23.240]  next hour so I was gonna play this clip raw of Bill Gates and Anderson Cooper
[49:23.240 --> 49:29.840]  with Sanjay Gupta this weekend but we were up here late last night getting
[49:29.840 --> 49:35.040]  clips and things adding into this and so we're gonna show you a clip of him with
[49:35.040 --> 49:40.440]  his own clips contradicting himself so Bill Gates contradicting himself and
[49:40.440 --> 49:45.200]  them saying it's ridiculous Bill Gates you know you and I have no connection to
[49:45.200 --> 49:51.520]  Jeffrey Epstein yeah you just lived at his house in Paris and New York and you
[49:51.520 --> 49:56.400]  flew on his airplane a whole bunch to the pervert island the pedophile island I
[49:56.400 --> 50:00.720]  mean they're just up there lying to everyone so I was gonna play the raw
[50:00.720 --> 50:07.400]  clip but why why do that when we have one that actually has clips of Gates
[50:07.400 --> 50:12.120]  contradicting himself if you're ready a listener we're putting this on screen
[50:12.120 --> 50:15.920]  right now for TV viewers the flight log of the lid express this is released by
[50:15.920 --> 50:26.120]  the FBI with him flying on the plane over and over and over and over and over
[50:26.120 --> 50:32.480]  again now Gates was interested in this because he was basically running Epstein
[50:32.480 --> 50:38.200]  and the word I get is Gates was not having sex with any of the children
[50:38.200 --> 50:47.520]  Gates had Epstein going out and compromising academics and head
[50:47.520 --> 50:52.480]  scientists to blackmail them into the cult because they were setting up a
[50:52.480 --> 50:58.280]  cloning cult which I told you that years ago now it's mainstream news now of
[50:58.280 --> 51:02.000]  course there's an engineer employed at Bill Gates's mansion created 6,000
[51:02.000 --> 51:07.080]  child porn images using Gmail accounts so you know but the word we have is this
[51:07.080 --> 51:12.760]  is all about blackmail for Gates so Gates goes on TV and says none of this is
[51:12.760 --> 51:16.600]  true just like he goes on TV and says I don't want anybody to have a micro chip
[51:16.600 --> 51:22.040]  or proof of a vaccine but then he goes on and says but to live normally and
[51:22.040 --> 51:25.640]  travel and have a job you're gonna have to have it things won't go back to any
[51:25.640 --> 51:31.800]  anywhere near normal until we make you take vaccine so oh no this isn't true
[51:31.800 --> 51:40.440]  but we're going to make you do it and what's even more frightening is when he
[51:40.440 --> 51:46.000]  goes on CNN or CBS now we play these clips yesterday he says no this is gonna
[51:46.000 --> 51:51.960]  hurt a lot of people and old people need five shots and the immunity goes away
[51:51.960 --> 51:56.160]  real quick it's totally made up they want the precedent to hurt you with
[51:56.160 --> 52:00.040]  vaccines and get you like ancients would volunteer to have their kids
[52:00.040 --> 52:05.840]  sacrificed to opt in to this lunacy and this madness through peer pressure and
[52:05.840 --> 52:10.920]  have the corporations and businesses and managers and owners of the businesses
[52:10.920 --> 52:16.720]  make their employees through peer pressure do this this is all about them
[52:16.720 --> 52:19.600]  lying about the numbers how many would die and putting numbers people that died
[52:19.600 --> 52:23.960]  of other things on the COVID column and putting out fake tests and fake pauses and
[52:23.960 --> 52:29.280]  we all know that but the controls get more draconian and I've got exclusive
[52:29.280 --> 52:35.520]  information for you I'd already read this in a Fauci statement to the NIH got
[52:35.520 --> 52:40.920]  no attention and then I was talking to a major medical manager in Austin who's
[52:40.920 --> 52:44.600]  involved with the health department and the governor is now getting
[52:44.600 --> 52:52.160]  advisements from the NIH still that means from the UN that they're now going to
[52:52.160 --> 52:58.240]  start the mask police by the fall where they're gonna check your mask and that
[52:58.240 --> 53:05.040]  certified an M95 so see it's always more more more and because first it's where
[53:05.040 --> 53:09.040]  the mask submit okay it's just cloth where your burka and they got to get
[53:09.040 --> 53:13.080]  you ready for vaccines they need to get you ready to check your phone and to
[53:13.080 --> 53:16.720]  check that it's got the right app and to check that you're being contact traced
[53:16.720 --> 53:20.120]  and that you've been approved or that you've been quarantined so that but first
[53:20.120 --> 53:26.040]  now they got to check your mask now they got to get up in your grill and get you
[53:26.040 --> 53:28.720]  used to being asked questions and showing them things and showing you a
[53:28.720 --> 53:34.320]  certification and showing you a number on the inside of the mask because next
[53:34.320 --> 53:37.240]  it's gonna be we got to check and make sure you've had your vaccine and that's
[53:37.240 --> 53:40.600]  what's in the BBC that's what's been announced but let me show you this real
[53:40.600 --> 53:45.200]  quick they're saying Trump's banned off Twitter he's been blocked on Twitter his
[53:45.200 --> 53:48.680]  son's been put in Twitter jail for tweeting medical doctors giving a press
[53:48.680 --> 53:51.400]  conference they're trying to cherry pick doctors and take a few that have
[53:51.400 --> 53:56.280]  interesting views you know Christian eskeological views and attack them for that
[53:56.280 --> 53:59.640]  and this one lady thinks it's off-world intelligence attacking his wife type
[53:59.640 --> 54:03.440]  obviously this is anti-human the Bible says it's a fallen creature doing it but
[54:03.440 --> 54:09.520]  look the Lancet retracts large study on hydroxychloroquine NBC news zoom in on
[54:09.520 --> 54:15.240]  that so this is back in June this is a Bill Gates funded deal this is what they
[54:15.240 --> 54:18.760]  use at the UN to say that no one's allowed to say hydroxychloroquine it was
[54:18.760 --> 54:23.840]  withdrawn coronavirus influential study on hydroxychloroquine withdrawn BBC
[54:23.840 --> 54:28.000]  researchers retract botched anti-hydroxychloroquine study which was
[54:28.000 --> 54:34.080]  used to attack Trump but they're still using it at the United Nations to shut
[54:34.080 --> 54:39.680]  down our president and they put out the number of 600,000 troops having it that
[54:39.680 --> 54:43.440]  was all fraudulent that just came out yesterday all fraud all lies from the
[54:43.440 --> 54:51.520]  father of lies Bill Gates Vicky Gibbs 57 year old lesbian preacher in Houston
[54:51.520 --> 54:58.640]  went in with a cough got intubated and then died and as soon as I saw her face
[54:58.640 --> 55:03.040]  as soon as I saw the report I said watch it'll be innovation we know what's
[55:03.040 --> 55:08.280]  gonna happen it's a blue city same story yet again and they say her heart gave
[55:08.280 --> 55:13.680]  out if you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as a death sentence it's
[55:13.680 --> 55:16.640]  on record when everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed
[55:16.640 --> 55:20.840]  why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities in blue states it's
[55:20.840 --> 55:25.320]  because they intubate them putting a tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is
[55:25.320 --> 55:29.840]  causing an autoimmune response and if you do that with oxygen the doctors are
[55:29.840 --> 55:34.840]  on records saying it will kill you but all these doctors in blue cities in blue
[55:34.840 --> 55:40.040]  states follow their orders and the minute I saw this report today I knew what
[55:40.040 --> 55:46.960]  I would be reading don't end up like Vicky Gibbs or everyone Americans have
[55:46.960 --> 55:52.480]  had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such docile
[55:52.480 --> 55:56.200]  times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for
[55:56.200 --> 56:01.080]  tyranny we don't appreciate the American way truth justice due process the
[56:01.080 --> 56:04.280]  right to self-defense private property because we've had it so long we just
[56:04.280 --> 56:08.240]  think that's how the rest of the world is ladies and gentlemen the Renaissance the
[56:08.240 --> 56:13.080]  social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to
[56:13.080 --> 56:17.240]  believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is
[56:17.240 --> 56:21.160]  something the West invented and that's what made our modern world that's now
[56:21.160 --> 56:25.480]  been hijacked by the technocrats by the globalist who say humans are ugly and
[56:25.480 --> 56:30.280]  bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups
[56:30.280 --> 56:34.680]  that the elites dominate manipulate and command you're even lucky enough to stay
[56:34.680 --> 56:40.520]  alive and that's what COVID-19 is a global UN revolution against free
[56:40.520 --> 56:44.120]  humanity against your family against prosperity and against your future if
[56:44.120 --> 56:47.600]  you don't stand up and fight you deserve what you get
[56:47.840 --> 56:53.280]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[56:53.280 --> 57:05.280]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show
[57:05.280 --> 57:11.840]  so we've got Congress still debating whether Big Tech is censoring people in
[57:11.840 --> 57:19.400]  election muddle up that's like debating in the year 2020 if Hitler was a Nazi it's
[57:19.400 --> 57:26.120]  just absolutely insane or debating whether Winston Churchill was British
[57:29.400 --> 57:37.040]  and meanwhile the UN is on documents it's on masks it's on drugs it's on the
[57:37.040 --> 57:43.440]  news that oh this is WHO approved sorry we only do what the WHO says and they
[57:43.440 --> 57:48.840]  say these three tests are the only test tests recovered and all three tests are
[57:48.840 --> 57:52.480]  designed to give off the chart false positives and they even admit it it's
[57:52.480 --> 58:00.280]  built-in definition fraud where if they say a baby is dead even though it's kept
[58:00.280 --> 58:05.400]  alive they're allowed to keep it alive and then later harvest its organs
[58:05.400 --> 58:13.000]  because they legally said they didn't resuscitate it and so look at these
[58:13.000 --> 58:17.400]  headlines I just showed you last segment NBC News BBC all of them lands that
[58:17.400 --> 58:22.760]  retracts large study on hydroxychloroquine researchers restrict
[58:22.760 --> 58:27.040]  and retract botched anti-hydroxychloroquine study which was used to
[58:27.040 --> 58:30.480]  attack Trump here's BBC coronavirus influential study of hydroxychloroquine
[58:30.480 --> 58:36.000]  was wrong gates funded hydroxychloroquine studies are designed to kill people
[58:36.000 --> 58:43.880]  researchers retract botched hydroxychloroquine zero hedge comes out they
[58:43.880 --> 58:48.200]  added 600,000 people to the list that had a COVID that didn't I mean it's just
[58:48.200 --> 58:52.440]  all lies meanwhile they don't tell you that in these articles Twitter sensors
[58:52.440 --> 58:56.800]  Trump by completely removing his tweet for first time implores it tells you
[58:56.800 --> 59:00.560]  what happened look at these headlines Newsweek
[59:00.560 --> 59:06.520]  Trump has video he shared of Dr. wrongly saying hydroxychloroquine when cure
[59:06.520 --> 59:10.680]  coronavirus removed the videos removed the treats removed and they're going to
[59:10.680 --> 59:15.200]  say the WHO says in a study it's no good even though all the other studies show
[59:15.200 --> 59:18.680]  it's amazing but doctors should be allowed to say what they want to press
[59:18.680 --> 59:22.520]  conference and it's put out and if something's wrong they can be sued for
[59:22.520 --> 59:28.600]  it but but it's not wrong so based on a fake study that the UN uses that the
[59:28.600 --> 59:33.040]  Trump can't tweet the president's being censored because the UN said so as the
[59:33.040 --> 59:36.880]  authority and the medical doctors video at their press conference we can roll
[59:36.880 --> 59:41.680]  some of that for you it's on info wars.com a mirror of it is taken down
[59:41.680 --> 59:49.120]  Trump shared video later taken down for providing false information about COVID-19
[59:49.120 --> 59:56.080]  Yahoo news says French news agency and then you read it and it's like yep the
[59:56.080 --> 1:00:02.000]  UN says it's not true okay since with the president UN said those doctors aren't
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:07.920]  you and approve well shut them down. Trump Jr. suspended by Twitter for posting
[1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:11.280]  misleading and potentially harmful information about coronavirus that his
[1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:16.160]  father retweeted London independent well you shut that man down then thank
[1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:22.280]  goodness we've got sensors in charge. Twitter partially suspends Donald Trump Jr.
[1:00:22.280 --> 1:00:28.120]  for sharing hydroxychloroquine video and then they attack one of the doctors I
[1:00:28.120 --> 1:00:31.960]  mean it just goes on and on folks you got to read this Newsweek article
[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:36.840]  all places has a professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public
[1:00:36.840 --> 1:00:41.440]  Health who lists hundreds of studies on hydroxychloroquine and how it's saving
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:49.800]  lives this just came out a few days ago Todd Henderson professor epidemiology
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:53.240]  Yale School of Public Health he's offered over 300 peer-reviewed publications
[1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:56.960]  and currently holds senior positions on the editorial boards of several leading
[1:00:56.960 --> 1:01:00.760]  journals he goes on to say there is no doubt that hydroxychloroquine saves
[1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:04.600]  almost everyone that uses it if taking the early stages he says patients are
[1:01:04.600 --> 1:01:08.960]  dying needlessly because they're being told don't use hydroxychloroquine the
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:14.600]  doctors are being told and he goes on from there what an important article for
[1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:18.800]  you to get the key to the feeding cup of 19 art exists we need to start using it
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:24.960]  oh but the United Nations says according to a withdrawn study that our
[1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:30.480]  president needs to shut his mouth and everything the UN's told us and Fauci's
[1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:36.480]  told us of where it came from how many would kill all of it has been a lie but
[1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:41.560]  they don't care they just keep doubling down doubling down doubling down but the
[1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:45.440]  answer is more doctors going public more nurses going public more everybody
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:49.680]  should go pick it out front at grocery stores and CVS is with these articles
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:55.040]  and this information get aggressive this is their takeover fight it ultra 12 is
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:02:00.360]  already our overall number one bestseller ultra 12 is twice as strong as
[1:02:00.360 --> 1:02:06.720]  secret 12 for uneven lower price because I signed a huge multi-year contract to

[1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:29.960]  helps make DNA help the body produce more energy help produce healthy blood
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:34.120]  cells essential for proper nervous system function and so much more you can
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:37.240]  take all the energy drinks and they won't do anything if you don't have the

[1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:55.520]  uber-absorbable and it's 50% off right now at m4slife.com
[1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:08.560]  Bill Gates two days ago went on Anderson Cooper another fellow blue blood and
[1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:12.320]  lied to the world saying they have no connection to Jeffrey Epstein even though
[1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:17.160]  he flew on the airplane with him and stayed at his home and lied about
[1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:21.400]  everything concerning hydroxychloroquine he owns part of all the big vaccine
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:25.400]  companies he has a revolving door he and Fauci own part of the patents and
[1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:29.040]  it's all coming out even in mainstream news and the rats are leaving the
[1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:33.200]  sinking ship here is Gates talking and then we cut to clips showing what's
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:40.160]  really going on here it is so there's a conspiracy theory that one of one of our
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:47.920]  viewers asked about I just want to play that that sound what would you say to
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:52.760]  the French portions of the public like conspiracy theorists that seem to think
[1:03:52.760 --> 1:03:58.000]  that you're somehow responsible for the outbreak you warned everybody about this
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:04.480]  in a TED talk in 2015 you predicted this would happen if anything kills over
[1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:10.160]  10 million people in the next few decades it's most likely to be a highly
[1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:15.080]  infectious virus rather than a war there's also a conspiracy theory that
[1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:17.760]  you're pushing vaccines because you're gonna inject people with a tracking
[1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:21.280]  device when they get the vaccine as we also have ambitious goals for getting
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:27.480]  vaccine coverage up so you can avoid lots of diseases if you've been properly
[1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:33.600]  vaccinated once you have a safe and effective vaccine and get that out to
[1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:38.720]  almost all of the people on the planet and build the preparatory systems for
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:44.880]  the next pandemic so you can nip it in the bud we will go back to normal and
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:48.800]  economies will recover of course along with this vaccine comes the new
[1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:53.400]  vaccine patch with its ink coating in there which you can be scannable and
[1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:57.040]  readable I mean if there's anything getting close to the mark of the beast you
[1:04:57.040 --> 1:05:00.920]  know this is it you can't be free you can't go back into business unless you
[1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:06.160]  have mark through this ink this is mark of the beast training wheels this is a
[1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:12.080]  day I've been looking forward to for a long time so as all part of a so-called
[1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:15.800]  globalist plot to control the world behind closed doors on this New York
[1:05:15.800 --> 1:05:20.320]  campus a secret gathering of some of the world's most powerful people Gates
[1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:24.800]  Buffett Bloomberg Winfrey together with others at the meeting including George
[1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:30.360]  Soros Ted Turner David Rockefeller that much money that much power around one
[1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:35.520]  table it begs the question what were they doing what were they scheming the
[1:05:35.520 --> 1:05:41.760]  problem is that the population is growing the fastest where people are less
[1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:47.200]  able to deal with it so it's in the very poorest places that you're going to
[1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:52.040]  have a tripling in population by 2050 probably one of these numbers is going
[1:05:52.040 --> 1:05:57.120]  to have to get pretty near to zero but let's let's take a look a Q and on folks
[1:05:57.120 --> 1:06:01.280]  or you know which actually group has been targeting me as well lately they're
[1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:04.080]  claiming falsely that I'm somehow connected with Jeffrey Epstein and
[1:06:04.080 --> 1:06:08.680]  global cabalists of sex traffickers it's insane what what do you say to people
[1:06:08.680 --> 1:06:12.760]  who believe this stuff because I mean I'm sure you are inundated by I am by
[1:06:12.760 --> 1:06:17.160]  people direct messaging me just insane stuff disturbing allegations about a
[1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:21.960]  cute sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and members of his social circle bombshell
[1:06:21.960 --> 1:06:26.400]  accusations point a finger at some rather notable names in court filings
[1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:30.760]  Gouffray says she became an underage teen sex slave for Epstein who was later
[1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:34.840]  directed by Maxwell and Epstein to have sex with many quote powerful men
[1:06:34.840 --> 1:06:39.480]  including numerous prominent American politicians powerful business executives
[1:06:39.480 --> 1:06:43.400]  foreign presidents and other world leaders among those Gouffray names in
[1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:48.280]  sworn depositions British royalty Prince Andrew former governor and UN
[1:06:48.280 --> 1:06:52.240]  ambassador Bill Richardson and the influential former senator from Maine
[1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:59.640]  George Mitchell yeah the combination of having social media spreading things
[1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:04.840]  that are very titillating to have this pandemic where people are uncertain and
[1:07:04.840 --> 1:07:10.200]  you know there's they'd prefer to have a simple explanation it's meant that these
[1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:17.520]  things are really you know millions of messages a day and people like myself and
[1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:22.480]  Dr. Fauci become the target you will always have conspiracy theories when
[1:07:22.480 --> 1:07:28.200]  you have very challenging public health crises they are nothing but
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:33.720]  distractions often the clever thing they do you know our foundation has given
[1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:39.360]  more money to buy vaccines to save lives it's all tax-free any group you get
[1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:43.880]  foundation you just turn that around you say okay we're making money and we're
[1:07:43.880 --> 1:07:48.320]  trying to kill people with vaccines are by inventing something the ultimate
[1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:53.120]  solution the only thing that really lets us go back completely to normal and
[1:07:53.120 --> 1:07:58.120]  feel good about sitting in a stadium with lots of other people is to create a
[1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:04.120]  vaccine and not just take care of our country but take that vaccine out to the
[1:08:04.120 --> 1:08:09.920]  global population we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age
[1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:16.280]  range because they're most at at risk of that and doing that so that you amp it up
[1:08:16.280 --> 1:08:21.160]  so it works in older people and yet you don't have side effects you know if we
[1:08:21.160 --> 1:08:27.920]  have you know one in ten thousand side effects that's you know way more seven
[1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:33.040]  hundred thousand you know people who will suffer from that but you don't have a
[1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:38.080]  choice people act like you have a choice people don't feel like going to the
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:44.200]  stadium when they might get infected and at least it's true we're associated
[1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:49.200]  with vaccines but you actually you know sort of flipped the connection that we
[1:08:49.200 --> 1:08:56.040]  have there you said use vaccines to this population vaccine hesitancy so in
[1:08:56.040 --> 1:09:02.960]  2011 the German company cure vac was it was given 33 million dollars for their
[1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:08.560]  research and development of RNA vaccines then in 2013 Moderna
[1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:13.560]  therapeutics was given 25 million for their research and development of RNA
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:19.560]  vaccines then in 2015 and no via was given 45 million for their DNA vaccines
[1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:25.320]  which they also mentioned admitting to using DNA nano technology nano
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:36.040]  technology is using microscopic very tiny little robotic organisms okay all of
[1:09:36.040 --> 1:09:41.360]  these companies are backed by the Gates Foundation or have been associated with
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:45.760]  the Gates Foundation in some way you know these are well-meaning people you
[1:09:45.760 --> 1:09:51.880]  know this is a time where people are doing great work and you know so I hope
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:58.520]  the conspiracy stuff dies down it's it's really the numbers kind of blow my
[1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:04.560]  mind and it's not just the fringe people that you would normally think of it's
[1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:08.040]  not at all I mean I can tell you I get stuff from people who seem you know
[1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:11.080]  they have lives they have families I don't know if they genuinely believe
[1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:15.920]  this and they've just been misled but you know and for me it's you know I they
[1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:19.080]  claim I'm I was on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane and going to his island with
[1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:24.680]  Tom Hanks or I mean just just insane crazy stuff um what do you I mean do
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:28.440]  you think right there goes I know internet companies are looking at this
[1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:33.400]  do you wish that they would play a role in taking stuff down which is this
[1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:36.960]  they're already censoring everywhere so we have tried to bring this to the
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:43.800]  public it's not it doesn't work you know the media is controlled so this is why
[1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:48.000]  you don't see health care professionals and other researchers speak up more you
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:54.440]  see some still but you don't see the group of us because we don't feel like
[1:10:54.440 --> 1:10:59.480]  we have freedom of speech because I mean it does have real-world possible you
[1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:06.280]  know it does have real-world impact on on vaccines or you know a nut showing up
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:10.920]  to a pizza parlor in Washington DC with a gun yeah in some cases they are
[1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:20.640]  taking things down you know it it's a bad combination a pandemic and social
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:24.640]  media and people are now taking the president down simple explanation who's
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:29.120]  the bad guy here I mean gates a lot of that's been connected used to stay with
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:32.080]  Epstein they're saying protect gates take Epstein's stuff down in other
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:38.840]  locations and you know of course vaccines weren't popular with everybody
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:45.200]  even before this all because of all the death of destruction so I know I'm a big
[1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:51.080]  believer in getting the truth out but it's it's kind of not as titillating to
[1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:58.960]  say you know Cooper is innocent when the guy that stays with Epstein's right
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:10.200]  there see how the switch works that took quite as many people as you do the the
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:16.920]  side effects concerning we looked after the second dose at least 80% of
[1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:22.800]  participants experienced a systemic side effect from severe chills to
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:34.560]  fevers so are these vaccines safe well the the FDA not being pressured will
[1:12:34.560 --> 1:12:40.840]  not being pressured run by him stop right there we'll post the full video
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:44.640]  there's about a minute left at bandod video a little bit later today I don't
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:47.200]  know what we're gonna call it but it's gonna be up there Bill Gates destroyed
[1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:50.720]  in his own words I mean this guy is a eugenicist that wants you and your
[1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:54.440]  family dead on record there are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic
[1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:59.080]  mask at it for store.com you can wear them out to political events you can
[1:12:59.080 --> 1:13:02.760]  trigger it live darts but one of the biggest reasons is it's a great
[1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:08.640]  conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween but on top of that
[1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:12.080]  they admit that wearing these masks there's absolutely nothing to protect
[1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:16.040]  you from COVID-19 or anything else it's total virtues signaling to show that
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:19.000]  you're prepared for the force inoculations and contact tracing of
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:23.400]  their openly announcing it's an act of submission it's an act of like putting a
[1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:27.640]  burqa on your head and bowing down but a big reason to wear these is then in
[1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:31.720]  the stores when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask say it's just as
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:37.440]  useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing and the M95 mask only
[1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:41.000]  control what's coming in not what's going out so they quote spread COVID-19
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:44.520]  they don't protect from it so again it's a great way to throw it back in these
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:49.040]  control free spaces you buy one for 9.95 you get four more free they're at cost

[1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:41.440]  ladies and gentlemen we are live we are broadcasting worldwide
[1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:47.960]  Joel Scousen greencore aviator patriot the veteran chief at world affairs brief
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:50.440]  one of the smartest people I know he's been interested with us for two and a
[1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:55.200]  half hours to talk geopolitics the first 30 minutes than two hours on the
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:59.240]  globalist mass exodus out of the cities and why they're doing it in fact as you
[1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:03.480]  print me some articles about elites moving out of cities to escape covid
[1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:06.880]  moving to private islands that's the last six months but print earlier
[1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:11.840]  articles of elites billionaires the rich moving to new zealand other areas to
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:17.280]  escape financial collapse in war they're using the covid crisis as the
[1:16:17.280 --> 1:16:21.560]  excuse to shut down the economy before it collapses on its own they're going to
[1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:25.160]  use that to consolidate power that's why gold is a two thousand dollars
[1:16:25.160 --> 1:16:29.320]  an ounce right now side issue people that's why don't you have a gold
[1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:33.360]  sponsor well we could have plenty of gold sponsors I believe in gold but so
[1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:37.320]  many of them are bait and switch so many of them overcharge people I don't
[1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:41.080]  believe in charging people more than 5% over on bullion if something has
[1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:45.120]  numismatic value maybe 10 15% you got to be able to pay keep the lights on and
[1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:49.120]  you have the gold and silver anybody that has it for at cost in a market like
[1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:52.560]  this is lying to you there's gonna take your money and make you wait but we
[1:16:52.560 --> 1:16:54.800]  don't have a gold sponsor because I don't trust any companies that are out
[1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:58.840]  there I am working with someone I worked with many years ago to try to get them
[1:16:58.840 --> 1:17:02.680]  back into the business but it was hard for them to even operate because they
[1:17:02.680 --> 1:17:06.760]  weren't making a big markup so we are looking by next week to have a gold
[1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:11.000]  sponsor for everybody's everybody's been beat my doors down before to get gold I
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.960]  went out and try with three other companies they would sign contracts they
[1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:18.040]  would lie to us and then when you would call to get you know the deal at 5%
[1:17:18.040 --> 1:17:22.160]  above spot or whatever they would try to charge you more and I just I will not be
[1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:26.440]  part of that I just will not be part of that if you want to buy a collector coin
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:29.440]  that's great if you want to you know I'm sure the company we're getting on pitch
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:34.200]  you stuff that's more expensive or whatever you want it's just that there's
[1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:37.880]  gonna be a menu of coins that I'm promoting that are great deals that I'm
[1:17:37.880 --> 1:17:42.560]  personally getting myself and that's just how I am and so that's why we've not
[1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:47.600]  been in the gold game you know came out where Glenn Beck was doing 100% markups
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:54.240]  on people for gold and silver 100% markups that's just outrageous a collector coin
[1:17:54.240 --> 1:17:58.120]  where you pay more because it's it has a value sure you might get your money back
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:01.640]  on that someday that's up to you if you want to do it but the point is buying
[1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:07.760]  stuff that is numismatic soon you know semi-numismatic stuff that's right at
[1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:11.480]  melt cost or whatever that is absolutely a smart move I mean gold should be at
[1:18:11.480 --> 1:18:15.600]  $70,000 an ounce sorry I'm I'm digressing I've been trying to have a
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:20.040]  gold sponsor for years and I just am neurotic about only getting the best
[1:18:20.040 --> 1:18:23.600]  deal and there just aren't many good deals out there though even if you bought
[1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:28.080]  it with a big markup a year ago at you know five hundred six hundred bucks an
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:31.520]  ounce for gold you're sitting pretty even with a markup at two thousand right now
[1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:35.120]  I get it I won't get into Bitcoin because I don't so many people have been
[1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:39.200]  scammed by it I'm not saying Bitcoin itself is bad it's just that I just I
[1:18:39.200 --> 1:18:42.800]  just can't do it I know people in this office that have been scammed by Bitcoin
[1:18:42.800 --> 1:18:47.960]  but speaking of scams that seems don't work the way they say they do they're an
[1:18:47.960 --> 1:18:51.880]  excuse to add things Trojan horse just like the cell phones are Trojan horse
[1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:57.040]  the water is Trojan horse with fluoride the GMO crops are Trojan horse all the
[1:18:57.040 --> 1:19:04.880]  reduced fertility and now Bill Gates comes out and Bill Gates wants you to
[1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:11.080]  take a forced inoculation be able to travel that is a coerced inoculation
[1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:14.800]  oh you didn't have to take the inoculation to have your digital ID or
[1:19:14.800 --> 1:19:17.880]  your digital tattoo you didn't have to take that chip if you don't want to get
[1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:21.680]  on a bus or a train or an airplane or have a job in a big company or travel
[1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:26.680]  across state lines or go to church because everyone's gonna toady around
[1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:34.120]  because lawyers run everything down go well 2.5 million didn't die 150,000 died
[1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:36.760]  in the US and most of those died of something else but we're not gonna
[1:19:36.760 --> 1:19:41.760]  admit it was a fraud we're gonna say if one life could be saved we'll never
[1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:45.400]  leave our houses again until we've had our shots that sure kill a bunch of
[1:19:45.400 --> 1:19:47.920]  people and have side effects it don't even protect you but it doesn't matter
[1:19:47.920 --> 1:19:52.840]  because we want a virtue signal well when you're in the Great Depression and
[1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:56.080]  when things are totally collapsing and crimes already up a hundred percent
[1:19:56.080 --> 1:19:59.880]  nationwide or more and when you realize the third world starving to death just
[1:19:59.880 --> 1:20:04.920]  remembered all those little goody tissues they walk up to you in the grocery
[1:20:04.920 --> 1:20:12.520]  store even in Texas and say where your mask and I look at them and I say you
[1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:16.640]  know masks don't protect you oh shut up well there were supposed to be 2.5
[1:20:16.640 --> 1:20:21.240]  million died ah you watch Fox News so now my come back is when they go over and
[1:20:21.240 --> 1:20:25.400]  yell at me I look at them this just came me the other day but now I'm
[1:20:25.400 --> 1:20:30.520]  successfully did it again yesterday I go out a lot I might let them stop me
[1:20:30.520 --> 1:20:35.760]  this individual comes up this time a man happened at the gas station a few days
[1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:40.960]  ago this was a man first I was a woman and they look at me and they said I
[1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:44.480]  think all you should do this they look they say where your mask and just look
[1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:49.880]  at them and let's say oh nothing to say huh or oh yeah you're bad and say no I
[1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:54.040]  don't want to be cruel to animals or I don't believe in quilting animals and
[1:20:54.040 --> 1:20:59.520]  they're gonna say oh what are you calling me an animal a dog a bitch you go no a
[1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:07.480]  sheep and they both times shut their mouths and just walked away because they
[1:21:07.480 --> 1:21:14.040]  know their sheep they know it's a fraud I try to talk to him nice a lot of folks
[1:21:14.040 --> 1:21:18.120]  I'll get on an elevator or something and they'll see I'm not wearing a mask and
[1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:24.480]  they'll say you care I'll take it off I'm like no I know it's a fraud oh thank
[1:21:24.480 --> 1:21:27.240]  you my husband's the same way he says a fraud but I just want to get in fights
[1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:30.600]  with people and you know I I read that they're counting for every person that
[1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:34.760]  has it 15 more that don't and I yeah that's true most people know what's
[1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:40.720]  going on but they're not speaking up and talking to others so we should never
[1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:45.600]  have complied with the TSA that was the beginning of the slave training the
[1:21:45.600 --> 1:21:48.680]  groping the kids go to the body scanners but the borders are wide open and
[1:21:48.680 --> 1:21:51.960]  they're bringing Muslims in unvetted and Trump's bad for blocking Muslims from
[1:21:51.960 --> 1:21:55.320]  seven countries where they don't even give them real passports but oh you've
[1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:59.160]  got to be checked cuz you're bad and oh a million plus people die TV every year
[1:21:59.160 --> 1:22:03.160]  1.4 million they just bring the kids in no testing put them in school to give
[1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:06.400]  your kids the TV don't even treat the poor kids coming in that have TV that's
[1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:10.080]  not a problem diseases don't exist they're on an issue flip a switch we
[1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:14.040]  can't leave our houses cuz 150,000 died in the last six months and the whole
[1:22:14.040 --> 1:22:16.480]  thing's fraud
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:23.520]  so I've got Joel Scowson in here and I really wanted to read this BBC news
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:27.160]  article on there but it's long where this woman that's written stuff for MIT
[1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:29.880]  and Bill Gates before that's what she does she promotes implantable microchips
[1:22:29.880 --> 1:22:33.920]  this is always weird witchy poo photos when you type her name in but
[1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:41.400]  everybody tore into her on her Twitter absolutely annihilated her on Twitter she
[1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:50.920]  wrote this big article for the BBC Lena Zeldovich pull her up Lena Zeldovich
[1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:56.080]  for for me guys and Lena Zeldovich just type her name in writes for all these
[1:22:56.080 --> 1:22:59.800]  publications pushing implantable microchips smart toilets that spy on your
[1:22:59.800 --> 1:23:03.760]  poop and your pee and just how good the toaster is spy on you and how good the
[1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:07.880]  AI is it's wrote this huge article about and linked to the MIT and Bill Gates and
[1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:10.720]  how great it is you're gonna have to have this to buy and sell and you're gonna
[1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:13.840]  have this to get on planes and robots are gonna control your life and it's gonna
[1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:19.760]  be so good it'll be here within 14-15 months and there she is and she's a
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:25.560]  creeper side that left the Soviet Union and brought it here got a sneak and
[1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:29.000]  suspicion her family and folks probably were right on the tyranny over there but
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:33.080]  I guess folks didn't put up with it anymore so she's here to run our lives
[1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:36.120]  again and she's attached herself to Bill Gates and all the articles are the
[1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:40.000]  same they're sickening they're evil and they sell you on the garbage so the
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:43.640]  article is linked up on info wars.com but they're openly saying you want to buy
[1:23:43.640 --> 1:23:47.440]  and sell you want to travel you will take hundreds of Bill Gates shots he
[1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:50.520]  says it'll be five every few months there's hundreds of new diseases you're
[1:23:50.520 --> 1:23:56.560]  gonna take it all states cracking down on social gatherings says CNN because

[1:25:02.640 --> 1:25:08.280]  standing on top of an American flag is Nazi and they had the Soros funded
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:13.240]  Snopes groups and others fact check it to say yes now the American flag and yes

[1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:29.360]  Trump's people came up with two different versions of it with something even
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:34.760]  worse the Betsy Ross flag or first flag that they also say is racist even though

[1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:24.240]  uniforms on where they cannot be identified when you send camouflage
[1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:31.280]  uniformed officers into a city without any clear identification to direct their

[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:04.440]  november election this president's going to try to steal this election this is a
[1:30:04.440 --> 1:30:10.480]  trial run of the president of the united states who may be organizing to not
[1:30:10.480 --> 1:30:16.120]  accept what happens when we have the election if he loses and I expect that
[1:30:16.120 --> 1:30:20.240]  he will then we have to be prepared for what he is going to do in the immediate
[1:30:20.240 --> 1:30:24.320]  aftermath of such a loss I promise you I'm absolutely convinced they will
[1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:28.120]  escort him from the White House and with great dispatch government's going to
[1:30:28.120 --> 1:30:34.080]  kill this guy if he's not elected is he going to pull out this military is he
[1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:41.440]  going to engage us he is already alluded to there may be a civil war he is
[1:30:41.440 --> 1:30:50.000]  clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:56.480]  these are not acts of peaceful protest these are acts of domestic terror
[1:30:56.480 --> 1:31:11.520]  seriously mr. president civil war isn't coming civil war is here with a 97 days
[1:31:11.520 --> 1:31:16.000]  out from the election the ambient background violence of the communist
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:20.720]  and globalist organizations are being activated so that the police can be
[1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:24.600]  demonized ahead of the overthrow of local governments the surrounding of the
[1:31:24.600 --> 1:31:27.760]  White House to attempt to drive the president from office I've been telling
[1:31:27.760 --> 1:31:31.200]  you that that Soros is playing for the last three years from documents we
[1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:34.280]  exclusively got from family members they got high-level anti-village
[1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:39.120]  documents of brigades of groups under the command of Alexander Soros Soros
[1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:43.160]  properly financed more than 50 lawsuits against us when we got these documents
[1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:48.440]  and published them but Soros is just one front guy of the larger system now
[1:31:48.440 --> 1:31:53.480]  every major leader of the Democratic Party Pelosi Eric Holder the former
[1:31:53.480 --> 1:31:58.760]  attorney general Maxine Waters former head of Homeland Security Governor
[1:31:58.760 --> 1:32:05.520]  Ridge a Republican now Nadler today confronted the Attorney General Bill
[1:32:05.520 --> 1:32:09.720]  Barr and said you're planning to use troops to stay in office they've said
[1:32:09.720 --> 1:32:13.880]  they're gonna contest the election the Democrats are then if Trump contested
[1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:18.040]  which we saw in 2000 Republicans co-contested they're saying we're gonna
[1:32:18.040 --> 1:32:22.080]  remove him in the Washington Post headline said anyone aiding him will be
[1:32:22.080 --> 1:32:27.000]  put in prison including members of his cabinet so it's clear that that's their
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:30.720]  next move COVID to lock things down race riots to be the cover for the
[1:32:30.720 --> 1:32:34.360]  overthrow of the elected government so we better not oppose the overthrow of
[1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:39.480]  the government you hate black people then it's 98% white communist activists so
[1:32:39.480 --> 1:32:44.560]  Joe Scalzo is gonna be here for the next two hours and 20 minutes roughly till
[1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:47.680]  the end of the broadcast he's flown here he's a pilot former Marine Corps
[1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:52.160]  aviator from Vietnam he's an author he's one of the top experts on secure
[1:32:52.160 --> 1:32:56.800]  homes and real survivalism he's traveled the entire world he's up there in the
[1:32:56.800 --> 1:33:00.640]  top two or three people and recognize maybe you know the top survivalist
[1:33:00.640 --> 1:33:04.920]  expert you're for serious survivalism not so much about the gear but where to
[1:33:04.920 --> 1:33:07.720]  live and how to be prepared in the lifestyle that allows you to do it I've
[1:33:07.720 --> 1:33:11.160]  noticed the right thing to do for a long time but I've been in pure offense mode
[1:33:11.160 --> 1:33:15.240]  trying to stop this I tell you now folks that I agree with his analysis that in
[1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:19.200]  the long term we're not gonna stop this we can just mitigate it for ourselves and
[1:33:19.200 --> 1:33:23.320]  you know try to make sure that this whole system we have to go through this
[1:33:23.320 --> 1:33:28.640]  beast system is is is not as painful as it would be and it's about winning
[1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:32.520]  people's hearts and minds spiritually ahead of what's gonna be coming down and
[1:33:32.520 --> 1:33:37.920]  so we'll discuss it all in the third and fourth hour today I'll be co-hosting
[1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:42.200]  with Joel Scalzo he has his maps he has his fourth edition a strategic
[1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:46.360]  relocation out we also co-made a film together they're both available at
[1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:51.040]  infowarstore.com and they are absolutely totally essential but we've got about
[1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:55.320]  three minutes to break we're gonna play some of the Attorney General's
[1:33:55.320 --> 1:33:59.320]  confrontation with Nadler I have two crew members watching the hearings they
[1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:03.480]  say now all the Democrats are saying Trump's a dictator he's illegitimate he's
[1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:07.680]  sending in troops I mean this is now their next big move in my view Joel
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:12.400]  Scalzo in the world affairs brief what is your view well they certainly don't
[1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:17.520]  intend to let Donald Trump get reelected that's why part of the reason for
[1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:23.040]  extending this COVID-19 phony pandemic extensively is to make sure there's no
[1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:27.600]  in-person voting or at least if it's very limited to have drive by voting have
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:32.920]  voting by mail all of which is easily corruptible with all of the thousands of
[1:34:32.920 --> 1:34:36.760]  new voters that they brought in and registered I think it's very very
[1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:39.840]  unlikely that Donald Trump's gonna get elected and I'll tell you if the
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:45.560]  Democrats swing the Senate and it looks like they may be able to Joni Ernest is
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:51.600]  in trouble McSally is in trouble in Arizona David Perdue is in trouble in
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:56.920]  in in Georgia if they take the presidency and the Senate and have the
[1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:00.680]  House there's gonna be hell to pay in the United States it's gonna be a man
[1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:04.840]  they'll stack the Supreme Court with more justices to overcome whatever
[1:35:04.840 --> 1:35:09.640]  minority they they have with John Roberts always switching sides for them
[1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:15.440]  we're gonna get Green New Deal we're gonna get all kinds of gun control urban
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:21.080]  federal zoning planning I mean this is gonna be a nightmare and I don't think
[1:35:21.080 --> 1:35:25.480]  we're ever gonna recover by the way I agree with you that Trump is losing
[1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:29.360]  right now because of fraud there's a mail-in ballot but also because he's not
[1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:32.960]  on the offense and because of Jared Kushner giving him bad advice I say
[1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:37.240]  that so he'll change course in the next 97 days and hopefully avert this I'm the
[1:35:37.240 --> 1:35:40.280]  guy that told you he was going to win when others weren't at the polls were
[1:35:40.280 --> 1:35:44.840]  fake I know internal polls show him narrowly ahead previous internal polls
[1:35:44.840 --> 1:35:50.320]  showed him 10 to 15 points ahead so this is a serious situation but I don't
[1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:54.280]  think he can get ahead unless he comes out and attacks this coronavirus as it
[1:35:54.280 --> 1:36:00.320]  is a false pandemic it's exaggerated the testing is the key it's not valid it's
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:04.120]  picking up all coronavirus I totally agree you're saying he's got a head-on a
[1:36:04.120 --> 1:36:08.080]  destroy gates destroy vouchers he's got to attack this because American people
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:11.560]  I've been in hotel today talking to people Austin people pulling down the
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:15.560]  mass and say this is ridiculous I can't live this way there's a some there's a
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:19.120]  underground current of resistance building they need a leader they need
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:23.520]  someone to have the courage to come out and say the emperor has no clothes this
[1:36:23.520 --> 1:36:28.160]  has got to stop okay you just said what everybody needs to hear and it's the
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:31.600]  truth and I meant to start the show with that today so I want you to come back and
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:34.600]  say that again I want to take a clip of what he just said live guys put on the
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:39.440]  front of the whole show we archive this today for everybody because Trump has
[1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:43.600]  really dropped the ball and I don't say that with pleasure he needs to not be on
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:47.920]  both sides of this he needs to destroy Fauci destroy gates extra destroy the
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:51.840]  United Nations fraud expose the whole thing a lot of you have been listening
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:56.400]  for more than 20 years and if you go back to those shows we laid out the AI
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:01.680]  takeover plan the tracking of cell phones how programmed master computers
[1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:06.840]  would manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just predict large
[1:37:06.840 --> 1:37:10.120]  groups of human movements and activities but even predict what
[1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:13.560]  individuals would do and then once you could predict what individuals were
[1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:18.280]  going to be doing you can add stimuli through the AI systems through the
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:22.440]  computers through digital billboards through face scanning through the social
[1:37:22.440 --> 1:37:26.880]  credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted to but when we
[1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:30.760]  cover that the media would attack us and say we were making it up it was a
[1:37:30.760 --> 1:37:35.160]  conspiracy theory even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint
[1:37:35.160 --> 1:37:38.920]  documents well the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that
[1:37:38.920 --> 1:37:43.560]  they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out
[1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:47.600]  and it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned so
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:52.600]  we might want to dismantle the system now it's Christmas in July we ran the sale
[1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:57.080]  last year it was very very popular and so I am now announcing we are running it
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:38:02.320]  again in the year 2020 a very important election year and we have some fabulous
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:07.440]  new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020 it's the American

[1:41:33.160 --> 1:41:36.440]  minutes in the next hour we're gonna spend an hour and 45 minutes on
[1:41:36.440 --> 1:41:40.880]  strategic relocation on the really safest places to live in the united
[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:44.560]  states and the different crises and things that are facing also other parts
[1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:48.800]  of the world and then hopefully he can take a rest today nothing ever needs
[1:41:48.800 --> 1:41:53.600]  much as a hard-working guy and maybe shoot an hour uninterrupted later in the
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:59.240]  studio before he leaves back to where he lives on the west coast out there and
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:04.360]  can you just have an hour uninterrupted here to also get into this issue in more
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:07.440]  depth but he's here with us now obviously a lot of stuff is breaking I
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:11.000]  already planned to play the attorney general's opening statement I've got a
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:14.440]  transcript of it it was extremely powerful saying this is all made up you
[1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:17.560]  guys are a witch hunt you're a coup against the president you're now attacking
[1:42:17.560 --> 1:42:20.560]  me because I won't go along with it well now Hank Johnson we're getting the clip
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:28.000]  right now that said that Guam floats that islands float on top of water like a
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:32.720]  raft he now says that the attorney general's opening statement sound like
[1:42:32.720 --> 1:42:37.600]  it was written by alex jones and roger stone so we'll have some of that opening
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:41.160]  statement and that exchange coming up I've got a little bit of an exchange
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:45.960]  right now between him and nadler on the big new talking point that trumps gonna
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:49.720]  lose the election but then if he challenges it he's a dictator must be
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:53.520]  removed because they're going to challenge it but but Joel start over
[1:42:53.520 --> 1:42:56.680]  with where you think Trump is look right into camera for and what does Trump
[1:42:56.680 --> 1:43:01.720]  need to do to not lose I agree with you right now he's gonna lose well I fear
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:06.040]  that if Trump doesn't begin to take a strong stand against this corona these
[1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:10.560]  is exaggerated pandemic he doesn't start to attack the fact that the the test is
[1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:15.160]  invalid the test is picking up all coronavirus is not just COVID-19 the
[1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:19.560]  death rate is being exaggerated by assigning death to people at motorcycle
[1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:23.000]  accidents who have Lou Gehrig's disease saying they died of COVID he's got to
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:26.600]  come on the offensive and attack because America there's a seething
[1:43:26.600 --> 1:43:30.320]  undercurrent in this country of resistance against this mask man of
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:34.800]  resistance against sending kids to school with masks and they were looking
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:38.640]  for a champion someone's got to have the courage to come out and say the emperor
[1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:43.520]  has no clothes how would the president do that I mean he's got all the numbers
[1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:48.160]  they said 2.2 2.5 million would die it's a hundred fifty thousand they use the
[1:43:48.160 --> 1:43:51.720]  numbers of people that have died of other things in the COVID column the
[1:43:51.720 --> 1:43:56.160]  Democrats sent people with pneumonia's to nursing homes knowing it would create a
[1:43:56.160 --> 1:44:00.240]  death number they've got blood on their hands they're easy to destroy and they're
[1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:04.120]  blaming him for the pandemic why the hell is he doing this well first of all
[1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:09.080]  there's a net of vetting around the president that refuses to let him see
[1:44:09.080 --> 1:44:12.640]  anything that he doesn't get on TV within his own personal quarters and he
[1:44:12.640 --> 1:44:16.480]  watches you know Fox News which won't touch touch this conspiracy other than
[1:44:16.480 --> 1:44:20.200]  Tucker Carlson at the Capitol Hill for example you had over a hundred doctors
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:24.440]  testifying about why this was a false and exaggerated pandemic and all the
[1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:27.920]  mistakes that have been made by the establishment and the media banned it
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:30.920]  they wouldn't cover it they wouldn't show it they now have banned the
[1:44:30.920 --> 1:44:36.040]  president's tweet putting out the 44 minute news conference yeah that's
[1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:40.120]  incredible information control that's like the Soviet Union but Donald Trump
[1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:44.440]  has got to get someone into the White House who can brief him on this he
[1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:49.600]  lives by briefings he doesn't do any original research and so if he doesn't
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:52.880]  get briefed on it it's not gonna enter his head except for what he sees on
[1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:56.680]  television and unfortunately he won't get the full story and that's why they've
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:44:59.480]  docked Carlson's house it's why they're around the clock trying to get him fired
[1:44:59.480 --> 1:45:05.520]  because he listens to Tucker Carlson yeah but Tucker Carlson even that will not
[1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:09.400]  go deeply into conspiracy he knows their limits to what he can get away with on
[1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:13.760]  Fox News you know which is a false conservative news source oh he absolutely
[1:45:13.760 --> 1:45:17.680]  does know I mean he has been if he didn't have such giant ratings he'd
[1:45:17.680 --> 1:45:22.600]  already be gone but he has a breath of fresh air he's interviewed people who
[1:45:22.600 --> 1:45:26.880]  have defied these orders he interviewed the gym owner in New Jersey who was
[1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:30.760]  arrested for keeping his gym open for taking the doors off his gym so that
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:34.800]  they couldn't close him down they finally arrested him after 144 days of
[1:45:34.800 --> 1:45:39.680]  threatening him and he's still defiant and that meanwhile Walmart and all the
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:42.840]  other big companies they're they're essential think about the psychology of
[1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:47.160]  that they're essential big companies are essential but little people little
[1:45:47.160 --> 1:45:50.200]  companies that are the most easy to go under I know all these small companies
[1:45:50.200 --> 1:45:53.680]  have tried to get online get the stimulus money they can't get it then
[1:45:53.680 --> 1:45:57.920]  they get online they they can't get it we looked at it it's a big scam and then
[1:45:57.920 --> 1:46:01.840]  Jeff Bezos gets $32 billion and there's a lot of innovation that's not
[1:46:01.840 --> 1:46:04.880]  happening right now because of the instabilities in the markets for example
[1:46:04.880 --> 1:46:08.480]  the construction crews are still busy and they're still working because all
[1:46:08.480 --> 1:46:13.040]  those contacts were signed and implemented before COVID but very little
[1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:17.080]  new stuff is being signed so we're linking in a second wave of a depression
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:21.280]  when this hits next year it's not going to be the same year exactly I have a lot
[1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:25.560]  of friends that are instruction and they said we're busy now and finishing
[1:46:25.560 --> 1:46:29.520]  stuff early because there's nothing new that's right now I'm here to tell you I
[1:46:29.520 --> 1:46:33.320]  think Alex I've got a gut feeling they never intend to let us free from these
[1:46:33.320 --> 1:46:40.200]  pandemics they never intend to let us free again the UN had said that and and
[1:46:40.200 --> 1:46:44.360]  Bill Gates laughed when he was talking in interview and talking about the next
[1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:47.840]  pandemic is really going to get their attention they planned this one in
[1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:52.280]  advance they knew years in advance even Fauci said this administration will find
[1:46:52.280 --> 1:46:56.600]  him face a major pandemic and now Gates is saying the next one will really get
[1:46:56.600 --> 1:47:00.760]  their attention he's planning they know that's right he said the next one this is
[1:47:00.760 --> 1:47:04.560]  just a drill he said this is really a test on Colbert he said the next one
[1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:07.840]  will be terrorist and it'll be much worse and they started grinning like a
[1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:13.160]  devil yes he did so what what's up with Bill he just why does he celebrate when
[1:47:13.160 --> 1:47:16.240]  we and like Fred Zechari goes we're never reopening against goes that's right
[1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:20.920]  that's he gets so happy what is that demonically when he looks so happy well
[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:24.480]  as you know and we've talked before in the show there is a satanic connection in
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:28.680]  the entire deep state and globalist conspiracy these things are done by
[1:47:28.680 --> 1:47:33.240]  revelation and guidance at the highest level not to the intermediate yes man
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:37.240]  the stupid idiots that letting used to call them but Gates is one of those
[1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:42.160]  useful idiots to the to this conspiracy so you think he's not even in the
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:46.120]  inner circle no I don't think so he's he's a lightweight when you look at it
[1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:51.240]  mentally you know this is not a heavier source is the inner circle Kissinger was
[1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:56.720]  the inner circle Brzezinski was the inner circle but but not not Gates I agree
[1:47:56.720 --> 1:47:59.640]  what about the Rothschild's there they're pretty high up yeah they're very
[1:47:59.640 --> 1:48:05.880]  very high up Rothschild and the you know a lot of people get concerned about who
[1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:09.000]  is at the extra it really doesn't matter who's at the because they're just ring
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:13.400]  rates of sight that's right we know that this has got satanic direction that's
[1:48:13.400 --> 1:48:17.200]  the only reason it could be going for centuries I mean starts care back in the
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:21.560]  former centuries and it keeps going no single evil person could set this in
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:25.920]  motion and keep it in motion doesn't the Bible call that the mystery of evil yes
[1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:31.480]  yes it's got to be revelatory and it isn't at a high level I mean at a low
[1:48:31.480 --> 1:48:35.960]  level or immediate level but they use mostly control aspects for people at
[1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:40.080]  the intermediate they promise them wine women and songs they you know power
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:44.000]  money immunity from prosecution and that's what we're seeing all across the
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.480]  board with the the way that Jeffrey Epstein was covered up for years and the
[1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:53.320]  way that Maxwell is being treated you know in the courts this is this is
[1:48:53.320 --> 1:48:58.760]  immunity and they're gonna do it we're not gonna get justice I don't think
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:02.400]  Bill Barr even though he's playing loyal to Trump is gonna let Durham or have
[1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:06.520]  Durham ever reveal that's gonna just continue to investigate until after the
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:12.560]  election then it'll die because Donald Trump I predict will not be reelected and
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:16.880]  did you predict he'd get elected I think you did no I didn't I didn't I really
[1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:20.520]  thought that they would through the manipulation of the election which they
[1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:24.120]  tried and they manipulate up to 10% of votes but it wasn't enough it was an
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:28.120]  overwhelming surprise that's right he had such a landslide that he they almost
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:31.680]  stole it he barely made it right he just barely made but now they're ready for
[1:49:31.680 --> 1:49:36.800]  that's right I mean they've we've already lost the states that he gained the by
[1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:40.960]  nip and tuck in the Electoral College even Florida maybe go blue in this next
[1:49:40.960 --> 1:49:47.040]  election I mean I think we saw in the inter midterm election how we got those
[1:49:47.040 --> 1:49:50.320]  additional votes for the Democrats I think it's gonna be an acceleration of
[1:49:50.320 --> 1:49:54.480]  that I mean there's just so much corruption in the election process and
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:58.800]  I'm not trying to give people bad news I'm not trying to be a big bummer here but
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:04.600]  clearly again they're going to contest if they don't win they're already engaged
[1:50:04.600 --> 1:50:08.280]  in fraud and then if Trump challenges it they're gonna say he's a dictator and
[1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:11.400]  burn everything down I mean they're now that's all they're saying like parents
[1:50:11.400 --> 1:50:16.880]  but you know Alex it's my opinion that these people like Nadler and others in
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:21.680]  there are so rabid and Pelosi so rapidly and they can't control themselves
[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:25.040]  that's why they're actually going over the top I don't think there's any
[1:50:25.040 --> 1:50:29.280]  intention to have to overthrow and they're putting out this dictatorial
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:33.160]  stuff about Trump I think it's because they're simply almost irrational now in
[1:50:33.160 --> 1:50:36.880]  their hatred of Donald Trump not because that's gonna be actually necessary I
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:41.560]  think the people who control things under the scene have got things they know
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:44.440]  they're gonna be able to defeat him they know they've got the votes they know
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:48.400]  they've got the corruption they know they're gonna use voting by mail and the
[1:50:48.400 --> 1:50:51.600]  way to corrupt that type of thing but these people out there in front of the
[1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:55.200]  cameras they're over the top and I just don't think they can control what
[1:50:55.200 --> 1:51:00.240]  they're saying it's embarrassing look at the Washington Post 12 signs Trump would
[1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:03.480]  try to run a fascist dictatorship in a second term there's another Washington
[1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:07.000]  Post headline where it says you'll have to be driven from office and he challenges
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:11.040]  the election that those that aid him will be arrested it's just fear mongering
[1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:15.680]  though they're just painting this picture of Trump as the monster and they're
[1:51:15.680 --> 1:51:19.840]  blaming him for COVID for not doing what but it's not too late I'm tempted to go
[1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:22.560]  every day bullhorn the White House I know he's heard it before he never is
[1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:27.080]  able to call me anymore I know Roger talks to him some and I'm just and we
[1:51:27.080 --> 1:51:31.200]  need Roger to just tell him to go after COVID expose the COVID that's that's what
[1:51:31.200 --> 1:51:34.360]  we need to get through and we need to get an advisor into the White House who
[1:51:34.360 --> 1:51:37.680]  can feed him the information that's the number one thing folks I totally agree
[1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:43.840]  with Joel Scowzi Americans have had freedom for so long and most Americans
[1:51:43.840 --> 1:51:48.840]  were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history that we
[1:51:48.840 --> 1:51:53.040]  really have a blind spot for tyranny we don't appreciate the American way truth
[1:51:53.040 --> 1:51:56.960]  justice to process the right to self-defense private property because
[1:51:56.960 --> 1:52:00.120]  we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the world is
[1:52:00.120 --> 1:52:05.200]  ladies and gentlemen the Renaissance the social contract that's 500 years old to
[1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:08.440]  try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to
[1:52:08.440 --> 1:52:13.080]  empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and
[1:52:13.080 --> 1:52:16.880]  that's what made our modern world that's now been hijacked by the technocrats by
[1:52:16.880 --> 1:52:20.680]  the globalist who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be
[1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:25.560]  cold and dumb down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate
[1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:29.720]  manipulate and command even lucky enough to stay alive and that's what
[1:52:29.720 --> 1:52:35.480]  COVID-19 is a global UN revolution against free humanity against your
[1:52:35.480 --> 1:52:38.600]  family against prosperity and against your future if you don't stand up and
[1:52:38.600 --> 1:52:43.120]  fight you deserve what you get another part of the great awakening was taking
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:48.360]  place is people that haven't even been religious or Christian now see how evil
[1:52:48.360 --> 1:52:52.280]  is out in the open how hundreds of churches have been burned in Europe and
[1:52:52.280 --> 1:52:57.840]  the US hundreds of Christian icons have been burned destroyed Jesus's have
[1:52:57.840 --> 1:53:00.960]  their heads cut off all over the country all over the Philippines all over
[1:53:00.960 --> 1:53:04.920]  Europe Virgin Mary's are getting torn down I mean crosses are being torn down
[1:53:04.920 --> 1:53:09.360]  it's absolutely out of control but people now understand that evil was
[1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:15.160]  always real it is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move building
[1:53:15.160 --> 1:53:18.560]  beneath the surface and now it's emerged that's why when I ask listeners and
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:22.040]  viewers for your prayer I mean it I'm praying for America I'm praying for you
[1:53:22.040 --> 1:53:26.280]  and I know the power prayers real and God hears it we need to come together and
[1:53:26.280 --> 1:53:31.200]  pray for even greater awakening pray for Donald Trump to be protected pray for
[1:53:31.200 --> 1:53:35.800]  him to win a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalist
[1:53:35.800 --> 1:53:39.240]  to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom God bless you all please pray
[1:53:39.240 --> 1:53:42.080]  for him for us as well
[1:53:42.080 --> 1:54:02.680]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:06.480]  all right Joe Scowles of the World Affairs Brief.com is here and he's best
[1:54:06.480 --> 1:54:10.320]  selling author on the secure home he's the most respected person out there when
[1:54:10.320 --> 1:54:14.280]  it comes to secure homes really secure homes and safe homes and hidden homes and
[1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:17.960]  you know I really want him here to consult with him he flew here he's a
[1:54:17.960 --> 1:54:24.520]  piece of pilot to talk about what I should do with my operations and things
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:28.520]  I care about the operation it's all invested here I couldn't move this
[1:54:28.520 --> 1:54:32.480]  have it somewhere else from the money but at the same time we're moving down
[1:54:32.480 --> 1:54:35.280]  the road where they could be shutting us down the next year or two with all the
[1:54:35.280 --> 1:54:38.280]  things they're doing to us I don't try to be dramatic about that we'll be able to
[1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:41.280]  do something somewhere else and we've got a lot of being my my speech will
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:44.800]  always be there they try to put me in prison so they're never gonna shut me up
[1:54:44.800 --> 1:54:48.440]  I mean they they think taking money away from me hurts me that they they've got
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:52.680]  the wrong animal I care about staying on air keep my crew employed but we're
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:56.040]  definitely in the end game on every front and America is very long in the
[1:54:56.040 --> 1:55:01.120]  tooth and America has been you know really in a coma but when we come back we
[1:55:01.120 --> 1:55:04.480]  do have three clubs we're gonna play and then we'll get to the breakdown of
[1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:08.360]  strategic relocation in the next hour and 45 minutes which holds cows and but
[1:55:08.360 --> 1:55:12.400]  just again in the few minutes we have during this segment before we play some
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:15.720]  of these bar highlights where they attacked myself and others just minutes
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:21.480]  ago in Congress with the Attorney General what is your message to Trump
[1:55:21.480 --> 1:55:25.800]  because some of what we say does get to him via the Secret Service and via the
[1:55:25.800 --> 1:55:30.440]  military and via a few other people inside the White House I won't mention
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:34.220]  and and I think they are telling the president this not just because we're
[1:55:34.220 --> 1:55:37.880]  saying it but because they know it they've been encouraging him to really go
[1:55:37.880 --> 1:55:42.160]  on the offense and destroy the entire COVID front well it's not really
[1:55:42.160 --> 1:55:46.040]  important that he get the right information about COVID and there's
[1:55:46.040 --> 1:55:48.680]  plenty of doctors that can advise him there's plenty of people he needs
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:52.240]  somebody in the White House who can be a point man who can direct him to the
[1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:58.000]  right information and who can counter the the disinformation that he's getting
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:01.280]  from his briefings he needs someone to sit right down beside him and has the
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:04.880]  answers to the false briefings that he's getting and one of the number one
[1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:08.840]  things he needs understand is the deep state runs terrorism in the world they
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:14.200]  run ISIS they run al-Qaeda and so he gets talked into bombing serious
[1:56:14.200 --> 1:56:18.760]  supposedly stop al-Qaeda you know he's only doing their bidding so there's a
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:23.200]  whole major you know shifts that he needs to understand in terms of his
[1:56:23.200 --> 1:56:26.480]  paradigm and that's going to be hard to get through to him because you got
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:29.600]  people who are looking over shoulder watching who comes into the white you
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:33.520]  can bet if you got a source into the White House to advise him they'd have a
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:37.000]  major investigation of who's the secret source sitting next to Trump they'd
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:40.600]  blow it up in the Washington Times in the New York oh they did that to us
[1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:44.000]  because we did have conversations and we did have law firms right up plans to
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:47.240]  stop and they went crazy and are trying to put me in prison with their covert
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:50.400]  action just because they do know I might talk to them they want to destroy
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:53.680]  Carlson because he talks to them they tried to put stone in prison because he
[1:56:53.680 --> 1:56:58.360]  talks to him yeah they're ruthless and that's why I say Trump is surrounded by
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:01.200]  these people and it's unfortunate you know Trump has good instincts he came
[1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:04.760]  into the White House really trying to make America great but he doesn't have
[1:57:04.760 --> 1:57:08.560]  any backup information he doesn't have any backup experience he doesn't know
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:13.040]  any conservatives when he had to fill he didn't even know he had to fill 40 4,000
[1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:16.320]  positions in the West Wing in the White House he didn't know anybody so he goes
[1:57:16.320 --> 1:57:19.440]  to the Washington Republican establishment to pick who he is they put
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:24.200]  his very sorrows enemies in that's right and so it's not just one leaker in the
[1:57:24.200 --> 1:57:27.960]  White House there are dozens and dozens of leakers in the White House they're
[1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:33.560]  all total sycophants so Donald Trump has got a problem he's got only a few months
[1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:38.280]  to be able to turn this around and if he doesn't start to fight if he doesn't
[1:57:38.280 --> 1:57:42.800]  start to attack this I mean the American people generally because they're
[1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:46.720]  following like sheep all of the mainstream media and they're just like
[1:57:46.720 --> 1:57:50.680]  they're parroting the same thing every single local news station every day is
[1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:53.960]  parroting the same thing stories about COVID how we're all in this together and
[1:57:53.960 --> 1:57:58.000]  how nice it is and how this but underneath people are seething with
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:00.880]  hatred for this thing and you said you're at your hotel and people were pissed
[1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:04.640]  everywhere I go they're mad I mean I get mobbed in public people mad he needs to
[1:58:04.640 --> 1:58:09.440]  tap into this he needs to be the champion of the resistance and I'll tell you
[1:58:09.440 --> 1:58:12.640]  they'd have a real problem defeating Donald Trump because the mainstream
[1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:16.560]  people are going along with us are only doing so because nobody comes out of
[1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:20.360]  has the courage to so when he came out and said wear your mask it's patriotic
[1:58:20.360 --> 1:58:24.760]  it went from half the folks I saw not wearing masks everybody wearing them
[1:58:24.760 --> 1:58:28.920]  basically and saying well Trump says but they're still mad at Trump for
[1:58:28.920 --> 1:58:32.080]  doing it all right Joel Scowze and stay right there worldoffirstbrief.com
[1:58:32.080 --> 1:58:36.320]  Alex Jones with infowars.com we're gonna come back and play these bill bar clips
[1:58:36.320 --> 1:58:40.120]  that are sensationally crazy that will get into strategic relocation really
[1:58:40.120 --> 1:58:43.120]  important information you won't get anywhere else please spread the word
[1:58:43.120 --> 1:58:48.280]  help us to tune in
[1:58:48.280 --> 1:58:53.600]  any reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown the number one
[1:58:53.600 --> 1:58:59.000]  reason is it serves every one of their purposes we've gone over those purposes
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:04.680]  many times here on air the casual society the surveillance system global
[1:59:04.680 --> 1:59:08.720]  government medical tyranny forced inoculation but the most important
[1:59:08.720 --> 1:59:14.360]  facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are non-essential as
[1:59:14.360 --> 1:59:21.000]  we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:26.920]  people once had by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just
[1:59:26.920 --> 1:59:32.120]  fell into it's been preplanned organized globally and it's extremely
[1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:36.920]  predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax programs and
[1:59:36.920 --> 1:59:41.640]  regulations the central banks that control it all are able to pick the
[1:59:41.640 --> 1:59:47.000]  winners and the losers and consolidate power this is the truest form of
[1:59:47.000 --> 1:59:50.280]  technocracy fascism
[1:59:50.280 --> 2:00:05.600]  you can run on for a long time
[2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:11.280]  run on for a long time run on for a long time
[2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:16.840]  sooner or later gotta cut you down sooner or later gotta cut you down
[2:00:16.840 --> 2:00:24.960]  I says Mr. Johnson from Georgia thank you general for your opening statement
[2:00:24.960 --> 2:00:31.120]  reads like it was written by Alex Jones or Roger Stone
[2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:39.280]  you stand by that statement yes now I'm sure that we can agree on some things
[2:00:39.280 --> 2:00:43.320]  we disagree on a whole lot but I'm sure we can agree on the fact that President
[2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:50.320]  Trump is just a prolific tweeter isn't that correct he seems to be and he
[2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:56.160]  tweeted many times about the Roger Stone sentencing didn't I don't know how
[2:00:56.160 --> 2:01:00.680]  many times he tweeted about many times you and you're aware of them because you
[2:01:00.680 --> 2:01:05.640]  said it would it's hurts you from doing your job and isn't it true that when
[2:01:05.640 --> 2:01:11.360]  prosecutors in the Roger Stone case filed a memo with the court recommending a
[2:01:11.360 --> 2:01:17.320]  sentence of seven to nine years in prison a few hours later President Trump
[2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:22.360]  tweeted that the sentence recommendation was quote a disgrace you're aware of
[2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:28.680]  that yes in general bar several hours after that you filed a pleading with the
[2:01:28.680 --> 2:01:32.840]  court stating that the sentence recommendation would be changed and
[2:01:32.840 --> 2:01:36.920]  that you would be asking for a lighter sentence for Roger Stone isn't that
[2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:42.840]  correct so there you go that's the man that says that islands float he's
[2:01:42.840 --> 2:01:48.880]  worried if too many people go to Guam it will tumble over and cap size but there
[2:01:48.880 --> 2:01:52.040]  they are we should hear some of that opening statement but Joel Scalzen
[2:01:52.040 --> 2:01:55.560]  editor-in-chief at worldoffirstbrief.com he's here what do you make of Hank
[2:01:55.560 --> 2:01:59.880]  Johnson obviously that's being written for him by the Democrats throwing that
[2:01:59.880 --> 2:02:05.680]  in there well I think it's embarrassing to his own people for him to state that
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:10.120]  I think bars handling him very very well he's being calm he's being collected
[2:02:10.120 --> 2:02:15.640]  and that tells a lot to the American people who aren't partisan on this but
[2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:19.640]  as I say Donald Trump or Bill Barr is playing the role of the loyalist to
[2:02:19.640 --> 2:02:22.640]  Trump but you've got to remember the Bill Barr is deep state he was the
[2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:27.160]  handler he was the Attorney General under a George H. W. Bush covered up for our
[2:02:27.160 --> 2:02:31.880]  Iran gate Iran contra all the drug he was high-level CIA before that high-level
[2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:36.920]  CIA and so you know he's playing a very very smart rule but ultimately it's
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:41.040]  going to betray Trump because he is not going to allow the investigation to come
[2:02:41.040 --> 2:02:45.400]  forward exposing Commie and Hillary Clinton and all of that that DOJ is
[2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:50.120]  going to continue to extend on into after the election so that it never has to
[2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:54.360]  come out and as you said you said this months ago they never want this lock
[2:02:54.360 --> 2:02:59.160]  down the end now that of the UN said Saturday he said it's going to go on
[2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:02.400]  forever and ever and it doesn't matter if you take vaccines this is just a new
[2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:05.560]  way of life of medical tyranny you've got to have a digital tattoo under your
[2:03:05.560 --> 2:03:10.800]  skin so you can't even remove a chip they just inject it into you and then
[2:03:10.800 --> 2:03:15.000]  now they control you and they use that as a digital currency to track and trace
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:19.200]  and control you and there's the world government run by the UN attached to
[2:03:19.200 --> 2:03:23.360]  your medical records and attached to a new digital currency boom and they've
[2:03:23.360 --> 2:03:27.200]  got the dollar ready to collapse they're bringing this whole thing in of
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:30.480]  course it won't all be knit together until after World War three and people
[2:03:30.480 --> 2:03:34.520]  must understand that even though we are losing and being prepped for martial
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:39.080]  law and to take orders from by dictate from I agree this is just prepping it
[2:03:39.080 --> 2:03:42.720]  won't be knitted together until we get into a World War three scenario where
[2:03:42.720 --> 2:03:46.720]  we absorb a nuclear first strike and where we our leaders talk us into then
[2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:50.280]  joining a militarized global government order to fight the war and that's when
[2:03:50.280 --> 2:03:54.600]  we get the new citizenship where the the passport is complete with all the
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:57.880]  aspects including the vaccine and that's where you can't buy or sell and you
[2:03:57.880 --> 2:04:02.520]  can't be a professional unless you take the new passport the new citizenship the
[2:04:02.520 --> 2:04:06.280]  global and now they'll weed out the conspiracy believers who know that this
[2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:12.600]  has been you know forced upon us and they'll and that's where I think the
[2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:15.560]  active persecution of those like you and me and others that have blown the
[2:04:15.560 --> 2:04:20.360]  whistle will start they'll say we have to lock up these people who are not
[2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:24.840]  supporting our war effort you know they'll patriotize the the new global war
[2:04:24.840 --> 2:04:29.000]  that that say that there's a conspiracy they'll actually get people in these
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:32.120]  yes men to attack people and I agree they're gonna make the revolution
[2:04:32.120 --> 2:04:35.920]  communist and left us for a while it gets annihilated then it flips into a
[2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:40.120]  fascist that's right the globalists are funding the black lives matter knowing
[2:04:40.120 --> 2:04:43.640]  that it's full of a lot of communists like the revolutionary communist party of
[2:04:43.640 --> 2:04:48.320]  Chicago which has a lot of branches run and on Tifa who's full of a lot of
[2:04:48.320 --> 2:04:53.240]  Marxist and Marxist followers these are violent criminals are well they're
[2:04:53.240 --> 2:04:56.720]  supporting it knowing that it breaks down the social order and then they come
[2:04:56.720 --> 2:05:01.280]  in with their solution their solution of course is a milder form of socialism but
[2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:05.400]  it always involves control and that's where we're headed and that's why these
[2:05:05.400 --> 2:05:10.400]  violence this violence is continuing it is literally shameful it's a one one
[2:05:10.400 --> 2:05:15.840]  sided civil war in other words it's only one side and the American people are
[2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:18.840]  too busy in the life trying to fight inflation and keep their jobs together
[2:05:18.840 --> 2:05:22.120]  despite what government is doing and the media tries to cover up the violence
[2:05:22.120 --> 2:05:26.080]  while they slowly gear it up I want to go to break here the next four and five
[2:05:26.080 --> 2:05:30.440]  minutes we have left with this powerful opening statement of the attorney general
[2:05:30.440 --> 2:05:34.240]  this morning then we'll come back and get into strategic relocation and the
[2:05:34.240 --> 2:05:37.480]  safest parts the United States the most dangerous parts the United States and so
[2:05:37.480 --> 2:05:40.720]  much more with Joel Scalzen please call your friends and family tell them to an
[2:05:40.720 --> 2:05:43.920]  end then today we'll archive this at band-aid video so you can see the whole
[2:05:43.920 --> 2:05:49.080]  thing commercial free but right now let's go to this controversial supposed
[2:05:49.080 --> 2:05:54.320]  statements of the attorney general this morning good morning chairman ranking
[2:05:54.320 --> 2:06:00.000]  member Jordan I'm pleased to be here this morning on behalf of the Department
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:04.480]  of Justice I want to pay my respects to your colleague Congressman John Lewis
[2:06:04.480 --> 2:06:10.080]  and indomitable champion of civil rights and the rule of law I think it is
[2:06:10.080 --> 2:06:14.880]  especially important to remember today that he pursued his cause passionately
[2:06:14.880 --> 2:06:22.160]  and successfully with unwavering commitment to non-violence as I said
[2:06:22.160 --> 2:06:26.680]  in my confirmation hearing the attorney general has a unique obligation he holds
[2:06:26.680 --> 2:06:30.880]  in trust the fair and impartial administration of justice he must
[2:06:30.880 --> 2:06:35.760]  ensure that there is one standard of justice that applies to everyone equally
[2:06:35.760 --> 2:06:40.840]  and the criminal cases are handled even handedly based on the law and the facts
[2:06:40.840 --> 2:06:47.240]  and with art work without regard to political or personal considerations and
[2:06:47.240 --> 2:06:51.040]  I can tell you that I've handled criminal matters that have come to me for
[2:06:51.040 --> 2:06:55.720]  decision in this way the president has not attempted to interfere in these
[2:06:55.720 --> 2:07:00.760]  decisions on the contrary he has told me from the start that he expects me to
[2:07:00.760 --> 2:07:05.640]  exercise my independent judgment to make whatever call I think is right and that
[2:07:05.640 --> 2:07:10.840]  is precisely what I've done indeed it's precisely because I feel complete
[2:07:10.840 --> 2:07:15.120]  freedom to do what I think is right that induced me to serve once again as
[2:07:15.120 --> 2:07:19.680]  attorney general as you just said mr. chairman I served as attorney general
[2:07:19.680 --> 2:07:24.160]  under president George HW Bush and after that I spent many years in the
[2:07:24.160 --> 2:07:29.240]  corporate world I'm almost 70 years old I was almost 70 years old and slipping
[2:07:29.240 --> 2:07:34.320]  happily into retirement I had nothing to prove and I had no desire to return to
[2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:41.440]  government I had no prior relationship with President Trump let me turn briefly
[2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:47.640]  to the several pressing issues of the day the horrible killing of George Floyd
[2:07:47.640 --> 2:07:53.520]  Minneapolis understandably jarred the whole country and forced us to reflect
[2:07:53.520 --> 2:07:57.780]  on long-standing issues in the nation those issues obviously it's not the
[2:07:57.780 --> 2:08:02.240]  Cruz fault I was reading a transcript when I went on air today of the meaty
[2:08:02.240 --> 2:08:05.880]  parts where he said this is a witch hunt you're trying to overturn an election
[2:08:05.880 --> 2:08:09.440]  rushing gates of fraud from day one you know I've seen what you've done it's
[2:08:09.440 --> 2:08:12.720]  terrible we'll actually this is an eight minute clip we'll actually find that
[2:08:12.720 --> 2:08:15.520]  part or I'll go review it during a break and then at the end of the show we'll
[2:08:15.520 --> 2:08:19.120]  play it but regardless you can read the transcript the clips are everywhere and
[2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:22.520]  I'm not gonna burn any time here with the with the pleasantries that began at
[2:08:22.520 --> 2:08:26.560]  the beginning Joel Scousen in the three minutes or two minutes we have left
[2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:30.200]  other political thoughts though about what Trump needs to do and how you would
[2:08:30.200 --> 2:08:34.280]  describe the climate of this country right now well the climate in this
[2:08:34.280 --> 2:08:39.600]  country is extremely divisive and in three parts and that is there's the
[2:08:39.600 --> 2:08:44.120]  extreme left in the hardcore left and I'm not talking about the people I'm
[2:08:44.120 --> 2:08:49.560]  talking about Democrats who induce this kind of hyperbole from the Democratic
[2:08:49.560 --> 2:08:53.520]  leaders in Congress and then there is the people the people who are really
[2:08:53.520 --> 2:08:59.120]  awake about conspiracy about this COVID-19 virus and there's a great big
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:02.480]  body in the middle that are going along with the COVID that are wearing masks
[2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:07.240]  that are denouncing everyone who doesn't wear a mask and these are the people
[2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:12.160]  that are up for grabs in life and this is the main body of people that Trump
[2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:19.240]  could turn if he were to take a strong documentable issue with the COVID-19 and
[2:09:19.240 --> 2:09:25.160]  that takes real expertise you know the the media will pull apart everything he
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:30.880]  says if he isn't doesn't document but I said he can walk in and go Bill Gates's
[2:09:30.880 --> 2:09:35.080]  study that said hydroxychloric acid is it good has been withdrawn here's all
[2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:38.440]  the studies saying it's really good how dare them censor me this is tyranny
[2:09:38.440 --> 2:09:41.640]  that's where he could start right there we're back with Joe Scousen we're gonna
[2:09:41.640 --> 2:09:47.600]  lay out the real state of this republic and more the strategic relocation I'm

[2:12:33.640 --> 2:12:39.240]  is here the UN collapsing the third world using it as a giant weaponized army to
[2:12:39.240 --> 2:12:42.760]  come in and break down society replacement migration those cows and was

[2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:17.080]  course to relocation the film but whatever you do please pay attention
[2:13:17.080 --> 2:13:20.720]  because this isn't just about for folks that have the money or whatever to move
[2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:23.920]  the countryside this is for everybody so Joel I'm gonna try to just sit back
[2:13:23.920 --> 2:13:27.240]  down for the next hour and 40 minutes and let you in the time we have go over
[2:13:27.240 --> 2:13:32.440]  this thanks Alex the most important thing I can tell people about strategic
[2:13:32.440 --> 2:13:38.160]  relocation is that we are losing the battle in terms of universal surveillance
[2:13:38.160 --> 2:13:42.480]  of our society you've got tracking instruments in our automobiles in your
[2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:47.960]  cell phone is the worst tracking instrument there is here and there's no
[2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:53.840]  way to avoid that ultimately accept to be where they cannot corral and enforce
[2:13:53.840 --> 2:13:58.280]  you and so I want to focus if you could focus the camera on this map of the
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:02.960]  eastern United States out of strategic relocation the areas in red are the
[2:14:02.960 --> 2:14:06.480]  numbers of people and so the more red that you see you see the higher
[2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:10.320]  population density look at this area from Boston all the way down towards
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:15.520]  Washington DC it's a massive red that area is a thousand people per square
[2:14:15.520 --> 2:14:21.080]  mile in this COVID false pandemic that's where they concentrate the area their
[2:14:21.080 --> 2:14:24.000]  efforts that's where you lose your freedom that's where the enforcement is
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:29.040]  that's where all of the the police are in terms of large numbers that's the fish
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:35.000]  in the barrel that's right and so as you see these areas in yellow in this is a
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:40.040]  regional map of the northeast region and I have one for the southeast and for the
[2:14:40.040 --> 2:14:45.200]  west and then in the southwest and in these areas marked in yellow that you
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:49.520]  see these are mountainous forested areas which make for the best retreats and you
[2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:53.480]  notice there's hardly any red in these areas at all there's hardly any people
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:58.200]  there's probably less than 35 people per square mile in these areas now the
[2:14:58.200 --> 2:15:02.360]  unfortunate thing if you're looking for retreat locations is that when these
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:07.560]  thousand people per square mile cities empty out and start to go westward
[2:15:07.560 --> 2:15:11.880]  because they can't go to the ocean they're eventually going to get through to
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:16.640]  these areas and that's why there's nothing in the northeast that is really
[2:15:16.640 --> 2:15:22.640]  safe in the long term eventually like army in Sir Locust the population will
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:25.760]  take everything over for thousands square miles around that's right
[2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:29.920]  eventually they get to it they pillage the suburbs first and then they go on
[2:15:29.920 --> 2:15:33.040]  into the farm and that's exactly what happened and after World War three when
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:37.600]  the Russians invaded Germany they headed for the cities the cities people got out
[2:15:37.600 --> 2:15:43.040]  on the roads and at last they got into the farms to do that but the safest
[2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:46.640]  area in the northeast section for example is the Cumberland Plateau it's the
[2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:52.760]  furthest away from this area and it is a thousand foot high plateau people who
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:56.560]  are pillaging and who after an EMP strike or the nuclear strike that comes
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:15:59.960]  during World War three will not be willing to climb a thousand foot plateau
[2:15:59.960 --> 2:16:04.880]  the stay in the valleys and pillage there and so that's an example if you
[2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:08.520]  look at the portion of the map on the southeast for example you see how bad
[2:16:08.520 --> 2:16:13.200]  Florida and why Florida is a zero rated state Florida has all of these red
[2:16:13.200 --> 2:16:18.240]  population areas but there's only two ways out of the state two highways out of
[2:16:18.240 --> 2:16:22.120]  the entire state and they're going to be clogged and then you have of course the
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:26.120]  big sore spot of the southeast which is Atlanta look at that it's almost a
[2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:32.520]  you know 50 or 60 square miles of a thousand square people per square mile
[2:16:32.520 --> 2:16:37.080]  and that's a time bomb yeah and unfortunately North Carolina has
[2:16:37.080 --> 2:16:40.440]  become a real high-tech center and a lot of people have been moving from the
[2:16:40.440 --> 2:16:43.760]  northeast down to North Carolina and that's a center and that's why this
[2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:48.600]  yellow retreat area in the Blue Ridge Mountains is not as safe as the Cumberland
[2:16:48.600 --> 2:16:54.240]  Plateau because that's going to absorb the primary fallout from these people
[2:16:54.240 --> 2:16:59.320]  moving west etc but even without a nuclear war as in a global depression
[2:16:59.320 --> 2:17:02.680]  they're all going to be going out anyways just in a slower pace well in a
[2:17:02.680 --> 2:17:06.200]  global depression people still tend to hunker down toward the cities because
[2:17:06.200 --> 2:17:10.360]  that's the only place their jobs but in EMP for example which will proceed a
[2:17:10.360 --> 2:17:13.680]  nuclear strike in World War three there's no electricity when there's no
[2:17:13.680 --> 2:17:18.240]  electricity within three days everybody is start starting to starve there's no
[2:17:18.240 --> 2:17:21.680]  sewer there's no water within the cities and notice now we're openly talking
[2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:25.000]  about nuclear war with China that's right in China is getting very very
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:29.840]  aggressive China is now threatening Taiwan directly and I'm my analysis
[2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:34.600]  lately is that China will try to take Taiwan even before World War three
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:38.960]  knowing that the US will not come in and risk World War three by stopping I
[2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:42.280]  agree that but they say there are soon you know they're doing overflights now
[2:17:42.280 --> 2:17:46.400]  reconnaissance flights the Chinese Air Force almost daily over Taiwan they're
[2:17:46.400 --> 2:17:49.560]  getting very very aggressive this is very important to understand about
[2:17:49.560 --> 2:17:53.520]  international in the book strategic relocation I do cover all of the rest of
[2:17:53.520 --> 2:17:57.000]  the world in terms of its relocation potential and the one thing I warned
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:18:02.200]  people about is don't get to anything near China especially Australia New
[2:18:02.200 --> 2:18:05.240]  Zealand no kidding that's gonna be Australia is gonna get overrun there's a
[2:18:05.240 --> 2:18:09.360]  lot of stupid globalists that have gone and built New Zealand in New Zealand and
[2:18:09.360 --> 2:18:13.640]  they don't understand and they don't and it shows that they don't all know the
[2:18:13.640 --> 2:18:16.680]  big picture they haven't been told even though they're part of the conspiracy
[2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:21.640]  they haven't been told what the big picture is because China when it
[2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:25.080]  unleashes itself against the world is going to take everything from Japan
[2:18:25.080 --> 2:18:29.240]  Philippines Borneo and they've now declared everything in the South China
[2:18:29.240 --> 2:18:32.760]  seeing beyond that's right they're gonna take Australia they have purchased all
[2:18:32.760 --> 2:18:35.960]  the mineral rights in Australia you don't think that they're not going to
[2:18:35.960 --> 2:18:39.320]  invade to protect those mineral rights during war that's right and they're not
[2:18:39.320 --> 2:18:44.280]  going to be allowed to be able to allow New Zealand to remain a free country that
[2:18:44.280 --> 2:18:48.960]  close to Australia so I'm predicting that China will occupy Japan all the way
[2:18:48.960 --> 2:18:54.040]  down through New Zealand so don't go there for relocation a lot of people
[2:18:54.040 --> 2:18:57.400]  also talk about South America and Central America I've lived in those
[2:18:57.400 --> 2:19:01.920]  countries a good portion of them I speak the language down there and I'll tell
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:06.280]  you you don't want to make relocation decisions based upon current expat
[2:19:06.280 --> 2:19:10.120]  experience down there you know you have all these expat
[2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:16.120]  websites on the on the net talking about the glories of living in Panama or
[2:19:16.120 --> 2:19:20.760]  Costa Rica or Chile or Argentina but I'll tell you you just don't want to make
[2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:25.520]  decisions based upon current conditions because even today under COVID these
[2:19:25.520 --> 2:19:30.400]  countries are going down fast they're all socialist countries they depend on
[2:19:30.400 --> 2:19:35.040]  American and European tourism to keep the country afloat and that tourism is
[2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:39.800]  down to zero now and they tend to want to then confiscate as Mexico has did
[2:19:39.800 --> 2:19:45.480]  has done American bank accounts and and replace them with Mexican bonds and
[2:19:45.480 --> 2:19:50.280]  other things which they've done a couple of times already so it's very important
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:54.720]  to understand as well that there is no population within these South American
[2:19:54.720 --> 2:19:58.320]  Central American countries that have any idea of constitutional liberty and
[2:19:58.320 --> 2:20:02.400]  government in other words the number of potential resistors to government
[2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:05.920]  tyranny in these countries is very very small in the United States bottom line
[2:20:05.920 --> 2:20:08.960]  you want to be around large concentrations of self-sufficient right-wing
[2:20:08.960 --> 2:20:13.240]  Christians that's right and you find the greatest concentration in the world in
[2:20:13.240 --> 2:20:16.880]  that in the United States and so even though we're going to be the target of
[2:20:16.880 --> 2:20:22.040]  a lot of this globalism because of our residual freedoms that we have here as
[2:20:22.040 --> 2:20:26.120]  I go to this map remember it's these areas with low population density there's
[2:20:26.120 --> 2:20:29.560]  always going to be where the conservatives the Christians are gonna and
[2:20:29.560 --> 2:20:33.960]  that's where they're going to migrate to let's lay it all out on the other side

[2:23:14.600 --> 2:23:18.000]  this six months ago Bill Gates was funding it and they had hundreds of news
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:22.720]  articles attacking us saying it wasn't true this is a tactic to use first they
[2:23:22.720 --> 2:23:26.520]  announced it we say it's a bad idea they said that's crazy we didn't do it they
[2:23:26.520 --> 2:23:29.840]  introduced the idea to you then they come back and announce it again thinking
[2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:35.680]  you have no memory this is a criminal takeover this is the line in the sand we
[2:23:35.680 --> 2:23:40.960]  must say no we must expose the fraud of COVID-19 this entire house of evil is
[2:23:40.960 --> 2:23:49.280]  built on I'm Alex Jones never surrendered a tyranny info wars.com you're
[2:23:49.280 --> 2:24:15.960]  listening to the Alex Jones show if you are receiving this transmission you are
[2:24:15.960 --> 2:24:25.200]  the resistance from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones the globalist
[2:24:25.200 --> 2:24:28.240]  have said they are carrying out the organized engineered collapse of
[2:24:28.240 --> 2:24:33.680]  civilization for the general public they will then have armored city states
[2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:37.360]  that are high-tech reservations that suck off everybody else and they will be
[2:24:37.360 --> 2:24:40.760]  above the law within those city states that's the model they say that they're
[2:24:40.760 --> 2:24:45.800]  gonna devolve torch but Joe Scouse is breaking down what will happen and he's
[2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:49.960]  talking about during a big war but I see this already happening in slow motion
[2:24:49.960 --> 2:24:55.040]  people empty out of the west coast and the east coast into the south and into
[2:24:55.040 --> 2:24:58.960]  Texas bringing all their politics and the rest of it and the crime and the
[2:24:58.960 --> 2:25:02.520]  homelessness and then the corruption and the danger where you have to flee
[2:25:02.520 --> 2:25:06.440]  regardless because of that please continue yeah you're absolutely right
[2:25:06.440 --> 2:25:11.440]  Alex California is now their prime destination has been for the past three
[2:25:11.440 --> 2:25:15.440]  decades Oregon and Washington and northern Idaho and that's why northern
[2:25:15.440 --> 2:25:20.360]  Idaho has become a liberal bastion of Democrats even though the state is still
[2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:25.160]  conservative now their number one destination is Texas and you're gonna
[2:25:25.160 --> 2:25:30.360]  get a lot of influx into Texas because of the California Joe Rogan Elon Musk
[2:25:30.360 --> 2:25:34.680]  everybody yeah lack of income tax that's one of the major draws here to Texas
[2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:39.240]  etc so they're heading for the major cities as you can see in the map here
[2:25:39.240 --> 2:25:44.280]  these are your major danger areas in in Texas because you have these high
[2:25:44.280 --> 2:25:48.960]  popular and you know it's becoming like Oregon Oregon is completely controlled
[2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:55.040]  by the or the Portland Eugene demographics they're all arts liberals
[2:25:55.040 --> 2:25:59.280]  leftists and and Democrats there and they control the rest of the state which
[2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:03.280]  is all conservative and that I predict is what's gonna happen when Texas turns
[2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:09.520]  blue these five major areas are gonna control the rest of the state and that's
[2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:12.680]  and by the way to give you an example that's just broken in four wars dot com
[2:26:12.680 --> 2:26:20.040]  adan Salazar this is directly from the proposed new city budget Austin City
[2:26:20.040 --> 2:26:24.280]  Council officially calls for blowing up police station a symbol of ending police
[2:26:24.280 --> 2:26:31.600]  hate they call it deconstruction and they've now hired a new city attorney
[2:26:31.600 --> 2:26:37.400]  prosecuting attorney who was financed by George Soros literally and he says
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:41.680]  abolish the police he means put their people in I mean when these blue cities
[2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:48.480]  fall they fall overnight and it's a hell of a situation yes well in this map here
[2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:53.280]  for example the Midwest north-central region you can see the major populations
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:59.080]  areas Chicago and Detroit and Cleveland dominate this area and those areas are
[2:26:59.080 --> 2:27:03.640]  gonna empty out mostly to the south into the Midwest into Ohio Indiana and
[2:27:03.640 --> 2:27:08.160]  Illinois and that's why these are not safe areas and so you have to get further
[2:27:08.160 --> 2:27:13.720]  west where you see hardly any population centers in order to find some safety
[2:27:13.720 --> 2:27:17.920]  going back to the Texas region for example if you're between Houston and
[2:27:17.920 --> 2:27:22.840]  Dallas in the highway for interstate 45 that area is going to be one major
[2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:26.800]  traffic of refugees someday and so anything on either side of those is
[2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:30.400]  gonna get pillaged and just to back you up we have a large family ranch we've
[2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:34.920]  had since before it was Texas halfway between there and in Dallas right where
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:40.520]  it says 45 on that map and just a little bit to the east there of that 45
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:46.840]  marker there on the map and when there's a hurricane now within a day of it the
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:51.200]  highway is jammed there's looting carjacking up to 20 miles on both sides
[2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:55.440]  and major crime and houses getting robbed and so now every time so you know
[2:27:55.440 --> 2:27:58.440]  we're not at our farmhouses when we're gone well they get robbed when there's a
[2:27:58.440 --> 2:28:02.800]  hurricane so that's in it that's just a microcosm of what would happen in a
[2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:06.880]  bigger attack that's right and so you see the safe areas are outside the cities
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:10.120]  of south Texas Hill country is a good area here although it's getting pretty
[2:28:10.120 --> 2:28:14.960]  expensive because a lot of the wealthy in Austin and moved out and bought land
[2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:20.040]  and things that a better area actually is the south Texas pine forest area here
[2:28:20.040 --> 2:28:25.200]  which has a lot of pine forestation a lot of good farmland etc and it's not
[2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:29.880]  as desirable apparently for the wealthy and so that's been a good area the more
[2:28:29.880 --> 2:28:34.800]  austere areas in northern Texas the Texas Panhandle and the Red Plains area
[2:28:34.800 --> 2:28:38.440]  are very good but they're very rural very little land a very little water
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:44.400]  available and so it can be a challenge to try to get residences there and let's
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:49.440]  turn to the west for example and show what a stark differences that it is now
[2:28:49.440 --> 2:28:54.280]  Washington and Oregon and California what we call the left coast is no longer
[2:28:54.280 --> 2:28:59.040]  viable even though eastern Washington and eastern Oregon are very very good in
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:03.680]  terms of retreat areas they still are subject to the fallout that's coming down
[2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:07.880]  from the Seattle especially area especially where you have multiple
[2:29:07.880 --> 2:29:12.200]  nuclear targets there's a lot of fallout that's going to come down here you
[2:29:12.200 --> 2:29:16.240]  also have the Yellowstone Caldera in this area which makes which compromises
[2:29:16.240 --> 2:29:21.760]  most of Wyoming Wyoming normally has some very good retreat areas big Horn
[2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:26.760]  Mountain Star Valley for example but this caldera when it blows can put fallout
[2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:30.440]  in ash depending on which way the wind blows all over the and they say it's
[2:29:30.440 --> 2:29:35.360]  set to blow it has certainly had a lot of rumblings etc so it is very
[2:29:35.360 --> 2:29:40.320]  definitely a real threat now it isn't a dangerous threat in terms of like fallout
[2:29:40.320 --> 2:29:47.280]  is but it can right wreak havoc in your car I was in this area where I was had
[2:29:47.280 --> 2:29:50.840]  my business and raised my family outside of Portland when Mount St. Helens blew
[2:29:50.840 --> 2:29:56.600]  its stack we got ash on when most of the ash went north over Washington and into
[2:29:56.600 --> 2:30:00.280]  Montana and clear off across the United States but we got one day of ash and I'll
[2:30:00.280 --> 2:30:03.880]  tell you it's the most gritty thing it gets into all the bearings of your car
[2:30:03.880 --> 2:30:09.960]  and clogs the filters on the cars it's very very difficult to even drive through
[2:30:09.960 --> 2:30:16.360]  the destination because of its ability to clog things but the important thing to
[2:30:16.360 --> 2:30:21.680]  realize here is that this is called the inner mountain area and on this side of
[2:30:21.680 --> 2:30:25.800]  the map you can see it more clearly here but the inner mountain area here is
[2:30:25.800 --> 2:30:29.440]  probably the safest area in the United States because of its distance from
[2:30:29.440 --> 2:30:34.960]  population centers it's 500 miles from Denver it's 700 miles from Los Angeles
[2:30:34.960 --> 2:30:39.600]  in that basin it's 800 miles from Sacramento 1100 miles from Portland in
[2:30:39.600 --> 2:30:45.440]  Seattle and there's virtually no way to get to these areas on foot because it's
[2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:50.640]  trackless deserts through either Nevada or the Arizona deserts or the Southern
[2:30:50.640 --> 2:30:54.920]  Idaho and Oregon deserts etc. That's what makes this the safest general area in
[2:30:54.920 --> 2:30:59.720]  the United States population density of 35 people per square mile but that does
[2:30:59.720 --> 2:31:04.600]  not include Salt Lake City. Salt Lake City like any major city has now had
[2:31:04.600 --> 2:31:09.720]  gangs the conservative Mormon population are no longer the majority in Salt Lake
[2:31:09.720 --> 2:31:17.040]  City though they are in the surrounding valleys etc. This also has a
[2:31:17.040 --> 2:31:21.040]  disadvantage of being a dry area of the country this is mostly desert but the
[2:31:21.040 --> 2:31:25.200]  mountains do collect a lot of snow in the winter time and they provide
[2:31:25.200 --> 2:31:29.160]  gravity-fed water to all of the communities and that's one of the
[2:31:29.160 --> 2:31:33.360]  advantage. How far south is it good? Is Northern Arizona good? Northern Arizona is
[2:31:33.360 --> 2:31:38.840]  not quite as good but that's about the lowest portion you can get to be safe
[2:31:38.840 --> 2:31:45.280]  before you get too close to Flagstaff etc. And so really down here in the Red
[2:31:45.280 --> 2:31:49.840]  Rock country of Utah from St. George's, Zions National Park and Dixie National
[2:31:49.840 --> 2:31:54.280]  Forest this is probably the closest safest area for the people in the South.
[2:31:54.280 --> 2:31:59.320]  There are some good areas here in Northern Arizona especially over here
[2:31:59.320 --> 2:32:06.120]  where Payson is and Sholo and other areas in Northern Arizona but water is
[2:32:06.120 --> 2:32:09.720]  very very hit and miss here either you get a lot of it in certain areas where
[2:32:09.720 --> 2:32:13.480]  there's aquifers or you get nothing yet. What about New Mexico? New Mexico is
[2:32:13.480 --> 2:32:17.640]  completely out now it's a democratic controlled state. In this new addition
[2:32:17.640 --> 2:32:22.720]  Colorado has been downgraded from four stars to two stars and New Mexico is
[2:32:22.720 --> 2:32:25.440]  being downgraded. There's just taking over I noticed big techs coming in
[2:32:25.440 --> 2:32:29.800]  everywhere and just buying off the governor's buying off the I mean even
[2:32:29.800 --> 2:32:34.440]  Abbott now is just being bought off by Google and Apple. Yes I predict that
[2:32:34.440 --> 2:32:38.480]  Arizona's could become a blue state New Mexico, Colorado. The only ones that
[2:32:38.480 --> 2:32:42.360]  won't become blue states are probably Idaho and Utah that will be left in that
[2:32:42.360 --> 2:32:47.280]  area. How is Idaho? Idaho has been pretty good up until the COVID problem when you
[2:32:47.280 --> 2:32:53.880]  had you know your mainstream governor bought into this entire thing and
[2:32:53.880 --> 2:32:58.140]  issued some draconian things not nearly as bad as Washington, Oregon and
[2:32:58.140 --> 2:33:01.880]  California. Where's the best place in Idaho? Well I think the best place in
[2:33:01.880 --> 2:33:06.680]  Idaho is the southern portion of Idaho. This has a lot of preppers up in
[2:33:06.680 --> 2:33:11.520]  northern Idaho especially in Sand Point and there's even a boundary county up
[2:33:11.520 --> 2:33:14.840]  in northern Idaho that doesn't even require building permits. One of the few
[2:33:14.840 --> 2:33:17.480]  places in the United States where you can build without a building permit
[2:33:17.480 --> 2:33:22.920]  there is a state electrical permit but the problem is the core lane area has
[2:33:22.920 --> 2:33:27.400]  moved in a lot of Californians and so this area tends to be to be liberal.
[2:33:27.400 --> 2:33:32.800]  Still a lot of good retreat areas in there but it's weather-wise not as
[2:33:32.800 --> 2:33:37.840]  comfortable I think as the high desert region. This gets nine months of cloudy
[2:33:37.840 --> 2:33:44.720]  rainy weather. Stay right there we'll come right back with Joe Scouse. One of the

[2:34:48.640 --> 2:34:56.040]  lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated, and then died.
[2:34:56.040 --> 2:35:00.880]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report I said watch it'll be
[2:35:00.880 --> 2:35:06.000]  innovation. We know what's gonna happen. It's a blue city, same story yet again,
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:11.160]  and they say her heart gave out. If you put somebody on a breathing tube and
[2:35:11.160 --> 2:35:15.120]  covered 19 as a death sentence, it's on record. Want everyone you know before they
[2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:18.800]  go to the hospital and get killed. Why are almost all the deaths happening in
[2:35:18.800 --> 2:35:22.760]  blue cities and blue states? It's because they intubate them, putting a
[2:35:22.760 --> 2:35:27.320]  tube in their lungs, and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response. And if
[2:35:27.320 --> 2:35:32.080]  you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it will kill you. But
[2:35:32.080 --> 2:35:36.800]  all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders. And the
[2:35:36.800 --> 2:35:41.240]  minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading. Don't end up
[2:35:41.240 --> 2:35:45.440]  like Vicky Gibbs or everyone.
[2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:52.920]  States cracking down on social gatherings says CNN because Fauci says if we
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:58.520]  don't, we'll see further surges in coronavirus positives because they're
[2:35:58.520 --> 2:36:03.000]  only ramping up the testing and because the tests have been designed at the
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:08.480]  Wuhan lab it turns out to be completely fraudulent. They cook the whole thing up
[2:36:08.480 --> 2:36:13.880]  offshore in a communist dictatorship with Fauci, Bill Gates, and the Chai
[2:36:13.880 --> 2:36:20.040]  comms to be directed by the UN as a giant planetary power grab. And now it's all
[2:36:20.040 --> 2:36:24.080]  over the news that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital tattoos under your
[2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:28.920]  skin and so has Google and they're deploying them at the airports next
[2:36:28.920 --> 2:36:33.000]  year where you'll have to have it to be able to travel, oh and then soon to leave
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:36.960]  your house or go in a grocery store, and the contact tracers work for Bill
[2:36:36.960 --> 2:36:40.040]  Gates and the Clintons and they're going to come to your house and make sure
[2:36:40.040 --> 2:36:44.440]  you're inoculated. Yes, we're now inside the mark of the beast, resist to be
[2:36:44.440 --> 2:36:45.240]  enslaved.

[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  times are ahead, whether Trump wins or loses. The globalists have already
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:20.080]  created a worldwide depression, lockdowns on a planetary scale, and it's only
[2:37:20.080 --> 2:37:24.200]  intensifying. This is one of the big boxes. You've got to get checked off as

[2:37:46.400 --> 2:38:16.280]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. We're going to go right through the next hour, laying out the safe areas of the U.S., the dangerous areas, what things will look like during a
[2:38:16.280 --> 2:38:19.400]  deepening depression, what things will look like during an actual disaster, a nuclear
[2:38:19.400 --> 2:38:24.200]  war. I think people now see with COVID and the lockdown and the fraud that we're
[2:38:24.200 --> 2:38:29.560]  not in Kansas anymore and that there is a move worldwide to destabilize things and
[2:38:29.560 --> 2:38:33.560]  bring things down. I want you to, Joe Scalzen, with your fourth edition of
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:38.040]  World Affairs, a brief website there and the strategic relocation fourth
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:43.400]  edition out and the film, spend a few minutes though, just speaking in general,
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:48.560]  for folks about the nature of good versus evil and really what this is all
[2:38:48.560 --> 2:38:54.360]  about. Well, there's a war on for our souls in this life from a religious point
[2:38:54.360 --> 2:38:58.360]  of view. You know, we all have a conscience and both God can speak to
[2:38:58.360 --> 2:39:01.520]  the conscience and Satan can speak to the conscience. It comes interpreted as your
[2:39:01.520 --> 2:39:05.800]  own grammar. It sounds like you talking to yourself, but if you start to
[2:39:05.800 --> 2:39:08.640]  listen carefully, you can tell when you're being prompted to do something you
[2:39:08.640 --> 2:39:12.360]  should do, that you know you should do, and you immediately get that voice of
[2:39:12.360 --> 2:39:18.280]  rationalization, you're too tired, you don't want to do that, etc. And so when
[2:39:18.280 --> 2:39:21.800]  you learn to listen, you realize there's a real agenda of good and evil and
[2:39:21.800 --> 2:39:26.440]  there are two sources of evil in the world. And I'll tell you, when you have
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:31.080]  people out there actually exhibiting hatred of that which is good, you know
[2:39:31.080 --> 2:39:35.320]  that they're being influenced by Satan in the mind. And it's not something that,
[2:39:35.320 --> 2:39:39.000]  you know, and when you get into public schools where they don't teach anything
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:42.200]  about morals, they don't reinforce conscience like they used to do in
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:45.640]  public schools. Alex, I mean, your teachers used to talk about conscience. You
[2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:48.480]  know what's right. Listen to your conscience, but you never hear that
[2:39:48.480 --> 2:39:53.600]  anymore. And so people are, I felt I'm free to do anything I want. You know, it's
[2:39:53.600 --> 2:39:58.440]  started in the 60s with the hippie rebellion and now you're free to do
[2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:01.040]  everything you want. It's really a violation of conscience. And now they
[2:40:01.040 --> 2:40:05.040]  say they're free to do to us what they want. Then the next freedom is they
[2:40:05.040 --> 2:40:08.200]  want to have sex with children. They want to do this. They want to do that. It's
[2:40:08.200 --> 2:40:12.440]  just outrageous. And worse now, they hate your free agency. They hate your
[2:40:12.440 --> 2:40:17.160]  freedom to judge. Everything about the claim that everything is racist is an
[2:40:17.160 --> 2:40:22.440]  attack on your right to judge. And they want you to not judge. Now they're
[2:40:22.440 --> 2:40:25.800]  saying you must have sex with a homosexual to prove you're not against
[2:40:25.800 --> 2:40:29.880]  them. Yeah. So it's it's it's just turned the world upside down. It's turned
[2:40:29.880 --> 2:40:33.320]  black to white, etc. And so I've also noticed illusion that the Bible talks
[2:40:33.320 --> 2:40:38.520]  about like I've had people I've known who just decide to believe a lie about
[2:40:38.520 --> 2:40:41.680]  us and then go tell the press it because they get patted on the head by
[2:40:41.680 --> 2:40:45.520]  the establishment and they they get off on it and they think it's funny to
[2:40:45.520 --> 2:40:50.920]  commit just giant fraudulent lies and they just sit there and do it because
[2:40:50.920 --> 2:40:56.040]  they feel like they're getting ahead. And so as long as they think they have at
[2:40:56.040 --> 2:40:59.440]  the end of the day, the moral authority in justifies the means so they'll lie
[2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:03.960]  about you. Well, you've been the subject of that a lot. And anyone who reads
[2:41:03.960 --> 2:41:08.600]  the Wikipedia article on yourself from my realizes there's a hit hit job.
[2:41:08.600 --> 2:41:11.440]  And listen, here's the thing. I don't feel sorry for myself like I'm a victim.
[2:41:11.440 --> 2:41:16.440]  I'm blown away by people I've known personally who know they're lying and
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:21.000]  they go do it for not even one piece of silver. They do it so their wife will
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:24.200]  pat them on the head or so they can feel like they're part of the
[2:41:24.200 --> 2:41:29.400]  establishment. They think the New York Times or frontline or CNN is good.
[2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:33.480]  Even though everything we warned about is now coming to fruition, we have all
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:36.720]  this credibility. They know absolutely well what they're saying about us is
[2:41:36.720 --> 2:41:41.320]  totally not true and they don't care. And they want to say we're illegitimate and
[2:41:41.320 --> 2:41:45.640]  we're liars and that we're frauds and they cherry pick things out of context
[2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:49.200]  to try to say that's true because they don't have a real identity and they
[2:41:49.200 --> 2:41:53.360]  don't like our ability to judge the fact that they are liars.
[2:41:53.360 --> 2:41:58.200]  Yeah, let's get back into this. Let's get back to a strategic relocation. The
[2:41:58.200 --> 2:42:01.960]  biggest question I get when people consult is, Joel, just tell me where the
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:05.600]  safest place to go. All right, I'll tell you. It's out here in the middle of
[2:42:05.600 --> 2:42:10.800]  Nevada or the middle of the Oregon desert or the middle of the eastern Washington
[2:42:10.800 --> 2:42:14.400]  desert where there's no people for a hundred miles. That's the safest place.
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:19.480]  The problem is you can't live there. If you have to drive two hours to Home Depot,
[2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:23.640]  you're not going to be able to get to build anything except we're wasting out
[2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:30.400]  your life in commuting. And so everything about strategic relocation is a
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:35.240]  really serious compromise. You have to take into your needs, your health needs,
[2:42:35.240 --> 2:42:39.360]  the climates you want to be in, your job needs, the family. You have a wife. She
[2:42:39.360 --> 2:42:43.920]  may not like to do something. And so what we do as strategic relocation, if I
[2:42:43.920 --> 2:42:47.640]  can go and point out something in the index, we cover all of the basic threats
[2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:53.240]  in detail. I mean, in general, for example, we talk about crime, pollution. We
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:57.520]  talk about medical help and regulations, schools, cost of living, nuclear war,
[2:42:57.520 --> 2:43:02.400]  chemical and biological warfare, property rights, firearm rights, states with red
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:08.840]  flag, low regulation states. But then we take something else to a different
[2:43:08.840 --> 2:43:15.320]  level and that is in this section of the book, we take every single state and we
[2:43:15.320 --> 2:43:19.920]  rate it and break down all of those different threats. So we talk about every
[2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:24.480]  state is rated in cordon population density, its cost of living index, the
[2:43:24.480 --> 2:43:28.080]  private land available, building permits, what it requires to get them, how
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:32.640]  onerous there are, land use planning, whether or not there's a statewide
[2:43:32.640 --> 2:43:36.720]  mandate, food production, how good, how easy can you grow, what the various
[2:43:36.720 --> 2:43:40.760]  growing seasons are, your health and environment, what the traffic is in the
[2:43:40.760 --> 2:43:46.080]  major cities, what the politics are of the state, what the tax rate are in the
[2:43:46.080 --> 2:43:49.520]  state. And in the general section on tax days, we break down every state with its
[2:43:49.520 --> 2:43:54.520]  tax rates, you can compare states, wear the overall tax rate. I mean you've
[2:43:54.520 --> 2:43:57.600]  done a lot of work and this isn't your first edition, this is invaluable
[2:43:57.600 --> 2:44:03.760]  information. Yeah and we've updated all this data now to 2019 to 2020. We've got
[2:44:03.760 --> 2:44:07.760]  all the gun laws of every single state, where they rate. Alternative medicine,
[2:44:07.760 --> 2:44:12.280]  this is very important, how free is the state to allow you to have access to
[2:44:12.280 --> 2:44:17.480]  alternative medicine, midwifes, naturopathy doctors, ODs and other you know
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:20.760]  alternative medicine. The statistics show midwives are safer than the hospital now.
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:25.400]  Absolutely safer than the hospital. Home schooling regulations, we cover that.
[2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:29.480]  And then in every state, for example, we take all of the major cities and we tell
[2:44:29.480 --> 2:44:33.520]  if you have to stay in the major cities of Michigan, for example, where can you
[2:44:33.520 --> 2:44:37.480]  find the safer areas around those. So there's a wealth of information about
[2:44:37.480 --> 2:44:42.400]  every single state in this. Here's Minnesota, we give the same breakdown. So
[2:44:42.400 --> 2:44:47.160]  you can go in any state based upon the general maps you pick. I want to try this
[2:44:47.160 --> 2:44:51.760]  state versus that. Then you go to the specific. We have a star rating on it. And
[2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:56.760]  then we talk about the specifics that you need to know about that. And then in
[2:44:56.760 --> 2:45:02.440]  the back, we have an actual map of colored map of every single state in the
[2:45:02.440 --> 2:45:07.360]  Union. And these are in the provinces of Canada. And these are very, very
[2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:13.120]  excellent states. For example, in this one in Montana, you have your green areas
[2:45:13.120 --> 2:45:17.000]  which are your national forest and state forest. You can see how much of the free
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:21.240]  area of Montana is covered up by state forest, which you can't build in. Then
[2:45:21.240 --> 2:45:24.440]  you have Indian reservation zones, which you shouldn't ever build in those. You
[2:45:24.440 --> 2:45:29.080]  have your nuclear targets. Look at these massive field of missiles there in the
[2:45:29.080 --> 2:45:33.400]  Great Falls, Montana area. And of course, all that fallout generally, according
[2:45:33.400 --> 2:45:37.360]  to windpads, is going this way. So this leaves out of Montana. This is the only
[2:45:37.360 --> 2:45:42.880]  safe area in Montana. And it's federal. And most of its federal or state land. Now
[2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:47.360]  that isn't to say that you can't find places. Some of the best areas in Montana,
[2:45:47.360 --> 2:45:52.520]  for example, the Kalispell Valley up here. And unfortunately, a lot of
[2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:55.920]  Californians have moved in there and started to turn it liberal. This is
[2:45:55.920 --> 2:45:59.440]  going to be a blue state. And once there's nuclear war, if it happens,
[2:45:59.440 --> 2:46:03.880]  those people will be cleaned out very quickly. There will be a lot of
[2:46:03.880 --> 2:46:08.760]  problems. And they are fair where the people, they don't believe in prepping.
[2:46:08.760 --> 2:46:12.040]  But you see, these maps are really invaluable to finding out where in the
[2:46:12.040 --> 2:46:17.960]  states that you can go and understand. And nearby, for example, this map shows all
[2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:22.160]  the, of Nevada, shows also the nuclear targets in California and the wind
[2:46:22.160 --> 2:46:25.800]  directions realizing you're probably going to get fallout. What about reactors
[2:46:25.800 --> 2:46:28.760]  melting down under nuclear attack? Isn't that even bigger than the bombs with the
[2:46:28.760 --> 2:46:34.720]  fallout? Well, it depends. It's a more complex analysis because there's no
[2:46:34.720 --> 2:46:38.080]  indication, for example, that Russia and China want to actually nuclear reactors
[2:46:38.080 --> 2:46:41.880]  or cities. They want to hit military targets in their first strike and then
[2:46:41.880 --> 2:46:47.600]  blackmail the West into submission. It's very clear from the speeches that were
[2:46:47.600 --> 2:46:53.720]  uncovered from Tiao Heng or the... The Communist Chinese leaders and their
[2:46:53.720 --> 2:46:57.240]  doctrines. Anyway, they're talking about we want to take it. That's why they want
[2:46:57.240 --> 2:47:00.880]  to use biological weapons. They want to cleanse the land. They want to have land
[2:47:00.880 --> 2:47:05.760]  to occupy for excess Chinese. Now, why do you think China suddenly, thousands of
[2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:09.280]  packages of weird invasive species are being randomly mailed? Have you heard
[2:47:09.280 --> 2:47:13.200]  about that? Well, yeah. They want to basically infect and kill off the United
[2:47:13.200 --> 2:47:16.680]  States people. The trouble is that biological weapons have a backlash back
[2:47:16.680 --> 2:47:22.800]  to them. That's what happened when it leaked out of Wuhan. But going back to
[2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:26.440]  nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plants are much more dangerous than nuclear
[2:47:26.440 --> 2:47:31.280]  weapons because it's dirty nuclear. It's got long-term isotopes that will last
[2:47:31.280 --> 2:47:36.040]  for years and years if it pollutes the land. Now, gamma rays from nuclear
[2:47:36.040 --> 2:47:40.840]  radiation from bombs only lasts about two weeks. And so it doesn't
[2:47:40.840 --> 2:47:44.200]  leave any residual effects. Because the left always goes, you idiot, right
[2:47:44.200 --> 2:47:47.360]  wingers. You've got an underground basement or a survival shelter. You're
[2:47:47.360 --> 2:47:50.680]  going to live in there for years. No, it's two weeks. That's right. Or a month
[2:47:50.680 --> 2:47:54.080]  depending on another wave of fallout coming from a more distant area. So you
[2:47:54.080 --> 2:47:56.960]  have to be prepared. You've got to have a fallout shelter meter. You've got to know
[2:47:56.960 --> 2:48:00.840]  when it's safe to come out. It's not enough to just get in there and be ignorant.
[2:48:00.840 --> 2:48:04.880]  So you've got to know that. But nuclear power plants are not going to be
[2:48:04.880 --> 2:48:09.760]  targets directly. In a meltdown situation, it could only happen really if they
[2:48:09.760 --> 2:48:13.080]  can't get a supply of diesel fuel to run the generators. And the federal
[2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:16.600]  government does have the abilities, and I think even during wartime, to keep those
[2:48:16.600 --> 2:48:20.760]  things going. So I don't think there's a high probability. Still, I don't recommend
[2:48:20.760 --> 2:48:24.880]  people occupy downwind. Yeah, you don't want to be downwind of a nuclear reactor.
[2:48:24.880 --> 2:48:27.800]  We'll be right back in two minutes with Joel Schaus and Alan Jones. Tell your
[2:48:27.800 --> 2:48:31.480]  friends and family and neighbors tune in. This is vital information. Stay with us.
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:40.280]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such
[2:48:40.280 --> 2:48:44.120]  docile times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind
[2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:48.720]  spot for tyranny. We don't appreciate the American way. Truth, justice, due
[2:48:48.720 --> 2:48:52.040]  process, the right to self defense, private property, because we've had it so
[2:48:52.040 --> 2:48:55.680]  long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is. Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:48:55.680 --> 2:49:00.560]  the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up
[2:49:00.560 --> 2:49:04.440]  humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well
[2:49:04.440 --> 2:49:08.480]  as the strong is something the West invented. And that's what made our modern
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:12.760]  world. That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalist who say
[2:49:12.760 --> 2:49:16.440]  humans are ugly and bad for the earth, and we need to be called and dumbed
[2:49:16.440 --> 2:49:21.040]  down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:25.640]  command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive. And that's what COVID-19 is, a
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:30.920]  global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against
[2:49:30.920 --> 2:49:33.720]  prosperity and against your future. If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve
[2:49:33.720 --> 2:49:34.240]  what you get.
[2:49:35.720 --> 2:49:40.360]  I'm really, really proud of the Dr. Jones Naturals activated charcoal, naturally
[2:49:40.360 --> 2:49:44.040]  fluoride free mouthwash and toothpaste. And if you don't know what activated
[2:49:44.040 --> 2:49:49.000]  charcoal does, ladies and gentlemen, it naturally in a clean way strips away the
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:53.640]  toxins, the impurities, the plaque, and it doesn't damage the enamel. That's
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:50:00.520]  really important. Support the InfoWare. Buy it now at InfoWareStore.com or go

[2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:23.560]  toothpaste, maybe even more. Over a year ago, I tried charcoal toothpaste for a
[2:50:23.560 --> 2:50:26.360]  major brand and thought it was amazing. And I went to my dad and people said,
[2:50:26.360 --> 2:50:28.400]  I would like to put out a charcoal toothpaste. It doesn't have all the
[2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:31.840]  silica and all these fillers and a very strong toothpaste. You've never used
[2:50:31.840 --> 2:50:34.480]  anything like it. Get yours at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[2:50:34.480 --> 2:50:44.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:05.480 --> 2:51:12.880]  Joe Scalzen is our guest worldoffirstbrief.com. He has the fourth edition
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:17.040]  strategic relocation available at InfoWareStore.com. And the film he made
[2:51:17.040 --> 2:51:20.880]  with us, I don't know, four or five years ago that's excellent as well on the
[2:51:20.880 --> 2:51:24.760]  subject at InfoWareStore.com. So this is a five-minute segment, longer
[2:51:24.760 --> 2:51:28.800]  segment coming up, but you were getting into not living downwind from a nuclear
[2:51:28.800 --> 2:51:33.240]  reactor. That's right. Yeah, because if they do melt down, of course, it's going
[2:51:33.240 --> 2:51:36.880]  to be a very damaging, you know, like Fukushima. Now, it's still not the end
[2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:40.240]  of the world. For example, Fukushima was claimed it was going to kill off all
[2:51:40.240 --> 2:51:46.040]  the fish in the Pacific. It didn't do that. You can't discount how thousands
[2:51:46.040 --> 2:51:54.560]  of miles of expansion of dilution of there will diffuse a lot of it and it
[2:51:54.560 --> 2:51:58.680]  does and it goes away. And so the effects of Fukushima almost gone right
[2:51:58.680 --> 2:52:03.720]  now. And same thing with Chernobyl. There was a higher incidence, for example,
[2:52:03.720 --> 2:52:08.720]  of cancer in a certain portion of the elderly population, unhealthy thyroids
[2:52:08.720 --> 2:52:12.160]  and other things that happened, but it only increased the death rate by about
[2:52:12.160 --> 2:52:16.560]  2% in that group of people. So it's not the end of the world, if you have,
[2:52:16.560 --> 2:52:20.880]  but you just don't want to be down, directly downwind within 50 miles of a
[2:52:20.880 --> 2:52:24.280]  nuclear power plant because if there is a meltdown, that fallout is going to be
[2:52:24.280 --> 2:52:29.240]  so concentrated, you'll need more than just a fallout shelter. You've got to
[2:52:29.240 --> 2:52:33.840]  leave the area. You've got to exit here. Absolutely. Please continue. Yeah. So let's
[2:52:33.840 --> 2:52:37.720]  talk about one of the safer states. Let's talk about Utah and Idaho. This is the
[2:52:37.720 --> 2:52:42.400]  state of Utah. And as I say, it shows where the Indian reservations are. These
[2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:46.640]  are in high desert countries, you know, in the tribal treaties. They always gave
[2:52:46.640 --> 2:52:53.480]  the Indians the worst land and which was unfortunate. The main population density
[2:52:53.480 --> 2:52:59.280]  is along the I-15 corridor in here. And this is the Salt Lake City area here. This
[2:52:59.280 --> 2:53:03.200]  is a not recommended area because of the high population density. But the nice
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:07.800]  thing about these mountains in Utah is just on the other side of the cities, on
[2:53:07.800 --> 2:53:12.080]  the other side of these mountains are high mountain valleys, which are very
[2:53:12.080 --> 2:53:16.640]  good areas and are shielded from any nuclear targets and still within an
[2:53:16.640 --> 2:53:20.240]  hour's drive to the city so people can live up in these higher mountain
[2:53:20.240 --> 2:53:24.800]  valleys and commute to the cities. And I bet up there it's beautiful. Yeah. And this
[2:53:24.800 --> 2:53:28.280]  southern portion of the state is the Red Rock country. This is where you find
[2:53:28.280 --> 2:53:33.040]  Bryce Canyon, the most popular national park for international tourists. Just
[2:53:33.040 --> 2:53:36.600]  gorgeous. You ought to Google that and if you haven't seen it or Zion's National
[2:53:36.600 --> 2:53:41.240]  Park, St. George is a dry area and the city itself is not recommended because
[2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:45.680]  of the fact that it's going to be an escape valve for the Las Vegas when it
[2:53:45.680 --> 2:53:49.280]  empties out is going to end up coming up towards St. George. But around the
[2:53:49.280 --> 2:53:52.160]  surrounding areas in the rural and mountainous areas, there are some good
[2:53:52.160 --> 2:53:58.240]  retreat areas, especially out of Cedar City into this mountainous area here. But
[2:53:58.240 --> 2:54:03.840]  Utah does have plentiful water supply for the cities and for irrigation
[2:54:03.840 --> 2:54:07.840]  crops because they store water in the mountains. And as I was saying, in normal
[2:54:07.840 --> 2:54:12.080]  plain state, you have to pump water up to these towers to have gravity feed as in
[2:54:12.080 --> 2:54:16.880]  Texas, etc. But not so in Utah. You have gravity feed. They'll have water from
[2:54:16.880 --> 2:54:20.240]  these mountain resources, even if there's no electricity, which is a great
[2:54:20.240 --> 2:54:26.880]  advantage. Let's take a look at Idaho.
[2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:31.480]  Have the Mormons know to pick that place to be if they've never been there before?
[2:54:31.480 --> 2:54:38.000]  Well, the Mormon history talks about Joseph Smith, the original prophecy and
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:41.920]  vision that they would be driven out of the East and he saw this valley. Didn't
[2:54:41.920 --> 2:54:46.040]  know where it was, but he saw this desert valley surrounded by mountains. He told
[2:54:46.040 --> 2:54:49.080]  Brigham Young about it and Brigham Young kept going and finally when he saw, he
[2:54:49.080 --> 2:54:54.920]  says, this is the place. Wow. So it was interesting when the Mormons went to
[2:54:54.920 --> 2:54:59.240]  Utah, it was they went there because nobody else wanted it.
[2:54:59.240 --> 2:55:04.280]  The Jim Bridger who owned the Big Fort said, I'll give you a
[2:55:04.280 --> 2:55:07.880]  thousand dollars for the first bushel of corn you can grow in the Utah Valley
[2:55:07.880 --> 2:55:11.720]  or in Salt Lake Valley. They collected on that debt.
[2:55:11.720 --> 2:55:15.480]  Wow. Some stations don't care that first five minutes. I want to recap
[2:55:15.480 --> 2:55:18.840]  on Utah when we come back and then get into Idaho. There's a lot of people who
[2:55:18.840 --> 2:55:21.160]  are wanting to know where they're going to go, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:55:21.160 --> 2:55:25.720]  not just because of the horrible situation of possible nuclear war,
[2:55:25.720 --> 2:55:29.240]  but because the collapse of civilization. I hope you can get into just
[2:55:29.240 --> 2:55:33.480]  moving not to avoid war, but the depression and left to cities.
[2:55:33.480 --> 2:55:36.840]  I mean, I think it's pretty much the same places though, right? Yes.
[2:55:36.840 --> 2:55:40.520]  But back in 60 seconds, stay with us.
[2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:48.120]  The bad news is western governments have totally let multinational big tech
[2:55:48.120 --> 2:55:53.720]  bring in communist, shiny style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[2:55:53.720 --> 2:55:57.960]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID
[2:55:57.960 --> 2:56:03.320]  takeover. This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for
[2:56:03.320 --> 2:56:07.480]  because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[2:56:07.480 --> 2:56:11.720]  And the good news is there are still sites like band.video,
[2:56:11.720 --> 2:56:18.040]  newswars.com, infowars.com, Paul Watson sites summit.news and a lot of other great
[2:56:18.040 --> 2:56:22.360]  sites that are getting massive traffic. Thanks to you and your word of mouth
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:28.040]  that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[2:56:28.040 --> 2:56:31.560]  destinies. Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality,
[2:56:31.560 --> 2:56:35.960]  a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy,
[2:56:35.960 --> 2:56:39.560]  but being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:44.360]  will defeat it. So take action or be slaves.
[2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:03.960]  The world is a very, very dangerous place and it's becoming more dangerous and
[2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:06.760]  more unstable and we're looking at the safest places to live in the United
[2:57:06.760 --> 2:57:10.600]  States for nuclear war. But Joe Scousen is one of the top
[2:57:10.600 --> 2:57:12.760]  experts on this. He's also saying that it's the same for
[2:57:12.760 --> 2:57:17.480]  societal collapse, depression. You name it. So let's look at Utah again
[2:57:17.480 --> 2:57:22.120]  and then get into Idaho and some of the other best places to live.
[2:57:22.120 --> 2:57:26.680]  Utah and Idaho are the two top-rated states in the United States for relocation.
[2:57:26.680 --> 2:57:30.600]  Not only because they are at the center of the Intermountain West, which is this
[2:57:30.600 --> 2:57:35.160]  high desert area that is separated from all the population centers, LA,
[2:57:35.160 --> 2:57:38.760]  San Francisco, Portland, Oregon, and Denver by
[2:57:38.760 --> 2:57:41.960]  five to seven, eight hundred miles of tractors desert.
[2:57:41.960 --> 2:57:46.360]  People just aren't going to walk that. But Utah also has some unique
[2:57:46.360 --> 2:57:51.240]  characteristics of being a Mormon-based population, for example, which are very
[2:57:51.240 --> 2:57:55.160]  conservative generally and believe in preparedness. So a good deal of your
[2:57:55.160 --> 2:57:59.080]  neighbors in Utah are based on preparedness. They are quite open to
[2:57:59.080 --> 2:58:03.240]  non-mormons being in the area. The only area of Utah I don't recommend to
[2:58:03.240 --> 2:58:06.600]  Salt Lake City, which has become a democratic stronghold. It has
[2:58:06.600 --> 2:58:10.440]  gang problems, but nothing of the sort anywhere else.
[2:58:10.440 --> 2:58:14.200]  You say some of the best areas are those high mountain valleys.
[2:58:14.200 --> 2:58:18.200]  That's right. The high mountain valleys, if you go and visit Utah, for example,
[2:58:18.200 --> 2:58:21.800]  you go to Salt Lake City and it's very unique because the very steep
[2:58:21.800 --> 2:58:25.240]  Rocky Mountains come right down to the edge of the city. I mean, there's no
[2:58:25.240 --> 2:58:28.520]  land between them out. It just comes right down to the city.
[2:58:28.520 --> 2:58:31.800]  And if you get behind those mountains, you can find high mountain valleys that
[2:58:31.800 --> 2:58:36.040]  are within an hour's drive of the city, actually mostly 45 minutes,
[2:58:36.040 --> 2:58:38.760]  within commuting range, and yet they're safe havens.
[2:58:38.760 --> 2:58:42.760]  I've been to gorgeous ski resorts between land, Salt Lake, and 45 minutes later at the ski resort.
[2:58:42.760 --> 2:58:46.520]  That's right. You're up to Deer Valley or Park City, etc.
[2:58:46.520 --> 2:58:49.480]  And the same thing all along the Lausette Front, you have these high mountain
[2:58:49.480 --> 2:58:53.960]  valleys behind the main front range of mountains that provide safety and
[2:58:53.960 --> 2:58:57.080]  security. And the mountains themselves are reservoirs of water.
[2:58:57.080 --> 2:59:01.240]  The snowpack mounts, they store the water, and then they gravity feed that
[2:59:01.240 --> 2:59:05.880]  so that even if there's no electricity, Utah cities will have water mostly
[2:59:05.880 --> 2:59:10.520]  because of gravity-fed water supplies. All right, now I'm looking at Idaho.
[2:59:10.520 --> 2:59:15.000]  Now, Idaho is the other, used to be five-star rated.
[2:59:15.000 --> 2:59:18.520]  Both Utah and Idaho have been downgraded to four and a half stars because their
[2:59:18.520 --> 2:59:22.440]  mainstream Republican governors went along with the COVID
[2:59:22.440 --> 2:59:27.640]  phony pandemic and a mandated, not legal mandates, but they
[2:59:27.640 --> 2:59:31.640]  have a pressure to do voluntary mandates, which amounted to the same thing.
[2:59:31.640 --> 2:59:36.200]  But there's two areas in Idaho that are different. Northern Idaho is different
[2:59:36.200 --> 2:59:39.080]  from southern Idaho, not only in politics because of
[2:59:39.080 --> 2:59:43.160]  Fort Lane, where a lot of Californians have moved in, have become a liberal bastion.
[2:59:43.160 --> 2:59:47.240]  But this is also a maritime Pacific Northwest climate.
[2:59:47.240 --> 2:59:51.000]  In other words, you get nine months of cloudy weather there and a lot of clouds
[2:59:51.000 --> 2:59:54.200]  even during the summer. Pretty nice summers actually,
[2:59:54.200 --> 2:59:57.320]  not as wet as Seattle or Portland by any means.
[2:59:57.320 --> 3:00:01.240]  And I was grown and raised in this region, so I know it.
[3:00:01.240 --> 3:00:05.080]  But you do get a lot of dreary weather during, and that's a
[3:00:05.080 --> 3:00:09.400]  downer for many people. Survival-wise, Boundary County and
[3:00:09.400 --> 3:00:13.240]  Sandpoint, Idaho, that area, they have a lot of preppers moving into that area.
[3:00:13.240 --> 3:00:16.360]  Boundary County doesn't have building permits other than a state electrical
[3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:18.840]  permit. And so you have a lot more freedom from
[3:00:18.840 --> 3:00:23.720]  government intrusion up there. This area used to be a very safe area,
[3:00:23.720 --> 3:00:27.320]  except it is dominated by a Nez Pierce Reservation.
[3:00:27.320 --> 3:00:32.040]  And it's pretty dry as well. But you do get some beautiful forestation
[3:00:32.040 --> 3:00:35.320]  in this region. It's a little too isolated for most people
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:42.040]  that they can't get to a major city in this lower portion of the northern Idaho.
[3:00:42.040 --> 3:00:46.840]  But the prime area of Idaho is in the southern Idaho area along the Snake
[3:00:46.840 --> 3:00:49.640]  River Valley. The Snake River provides ample
[3:00:49.640 --> 3:00:54.200]  irrigation water for this entire area. So there's a lot of beautiful crops that
[3:00:54.200 --> 3:00:58.600]  grow in the area. Good soil. Boise is the capital in this
[3:00:58.600 --> 3:01:01.160]  area. And even though that's not a recommended area,
[3:01:01.160 --> 3:01:05.960]  there's a ring of cities around on the north and the south of Interstate 84,
[3:01:05.960 --> 3:01:11.640]  like Starr in Middleton or Kuna, Idaho. And on the other side of the Snake
[3:01:11.640 --> 3:01:15.640]  River, Homedale and other things that have the Snake River as a barrier from
[3:01:15.640 --> 3:01:18.040]  any social unrest that may come from Boise.
[3:01:18.040 --> 3:01:21.160]  But these are good areas close to a metropolitan area
[3:01:21.160 --> 3:01:25.480]  that are within 20 to 30 minutes. That way you have the best of both worlds.
[3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:28.600]  Yeah, you get the best of both worlds. Because most everything's a compromise.
[3:01:28.600 --> 3:01:31.480]  People have children. They've got to go to school. They've got to do, they've got
[3:01:31.480 --> 3:01:34.920]  jobs. They want some socialization with some
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:37.960]  neighborhood. As I say, they don't want to live out in the middle of the desert.
[3:01:37.960 --> 3:01:41.720]  And you've got to be close enough to facilities so that you can build a
[3:01:41.720 --> 3:01:45.880]  retreat, such as access to products, etc. This area of
[3:01:45.880 --> 3:01:49.480]  northern Idaho or southern Idaho is the colder area.
[3:01:49.480 --> 3:01:52.760]  You get some of the cold continental Canadian air
[3:01:52.760 --> 3:01:56.920]  that spills down on the western side of the Rockies.
[3:01:56.920 --> 3:02:00.760]  It's always at least 15 degrees warmer in the winter time than it is
[3:02:00.760 --> 3:02:03.960]  on this area. So you get your subzero temperatures.
[3:02:03.960 --> 3:02:08.440]  It's nice during the summertime, dry, sunny weather, but in the winter time
[3:02:08.440 --> 3:02:12.280]  it's cold here. Big cold blast. Big cold blast.
[3:02:12.280 --> 3:02:16.680]  But still, as I say, there's a lot of different climatology and a lot of
[3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:20.360]  different areas to... And a lot of people that know what's
[3:02:20.360 --> 3:02:22.040]  going on. Yeah, and a lot of people, a lot of
[3:02:22.040 --> 3:02:26.120]  preppers in this area. In the area that I live, in rural Utah,
[3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:29.240]  it's the only town in the nation I think that 50 percent of the people are
[3:02:29.240 --> 3:02:32.520]  preppers. You can't top that anywhere else in the
[3:02:32.520 --> 3:02:35.560]  country. And so... We're going to talk about that
[3:02:35.560 --> 3:02:38.840]  some when we come back. As we print me the full Breitbart article, police
[3:02:38.840 --> 3:02:42.120]  just have the front page. Violent crime, explosion forces Minneapolis
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:45.720]  residents to form militias. And these aren't the type of militias that are
[3:02:45.720 --> 3:02:48.120]  forming for the U.N. invasion. Nothing against those guys.
[3:02:48.120 --> 3:02:51.000]  These are people seriously just doing neighborhood watches and having some of
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:54.680]  the men and women stay up at night and watch for criminals
[3:02:54.680 --> 3:02:58.600]  because the police won't show up now. This is a natural
[3:02:58.600 --> 3:03:01.960]  de-evolution of the power back to the people. Absolutely.
[3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:05.720]  Please continue.
[3:03:06.840 --> 3:03:11.160]  The situation in strategic relocation has changed. Unfortunately, I rewrote the
[3:03:11.160 --> 3:03:14.760]  fourth edition when this COVID thing started and enough to put
[3:03:14.760 --> 3:03:18.440]  that throughout the book about the dangers. In other words,
[3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:22.040]  the main point that I want to make is even though every Republican governor
[3:03:22.040 --> 3:03:25.080]  in the United States has gone along with the COVID
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:31.240]  false or exaggerated pandemic, still the amount of resistance in a Republican
[3:03:31.240 --> 3:03:34.520]  base is greater than it is in a Democratic base.
[3:03:34.520 --> 3:03:37.880]  Well, you see it. Republican congressmen don't wear the mask. The Democrats all
[3:03:37.880 --> 3:03:41.160]  wear it. Republicans are not compliant. They see
[3:03:41.160 --> 3:03:43.160]  through it on average. You want to be around those people.
[3:03:43.160 --> 3:03:45.880]  You don't want to be around a bunch of dangerous sheep that have accepted
[3:03:45.880 --> 3:03:49.480]  Marxist ideology and want to, quote, blow up the awesome police department
[3:03:49.480 --> 3:03:53.480]  in the new official budget. That's right. Although the problem that we face is that
[3:03:53.480 --> 3:03:56.680]  in every single conservative state, whether you're talking about
[3:03:56.680 --> 3:04:02.840]  Indiana or Oklahoma or Idaho or Utah, because of the
[3:04:02.840 --> 3:04:06.920]  effect of public education, propagandizing the youth and even
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:10.280]  conservatives end up sending the kids to the public school and you become
[3:04:10.280 --> 3:04:14.360]  semi-democratic, you get liberal, you get leftist
[3:04:14.360 --> 3:04:17.160]  in the public schools and public universities,
[3:04:17.160 --> 3:04:21.560]  everyone who runs for public office as a Republicans has to meet this
[3:04:21.560 --> 3:04:27.160]  mainstream. They're moving the Overton window. We're not. And folks, if I told
[3:04:27.160 --> 3:04:30.440]  you in Austin, that's why I've got its beautiful place families from here, I
[3:04:30.440 --> 3:04:34.120]  just have to evacuate, because the children of the Californians
[3:04:34.120 --> 3:04:38.600]  literally will tell your five-year-old daughter they need to be a boy or your
[3:04:38.600 --> 3:04:41.880]  son they need to be a girl and it's like you are in
[3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:46.600]  a LGBT brainwashing camp being around these children.
[3:04:46.600 --> 3:04:51.240]  I mean, it's gone. It's gone. I mean, I could harp all day about drag queen
[3:04:51.240 --> 3:04:54.200]  story time, pedophile story time. It's beyond that now.
[3:04:54.200 --> 3:04:58.120]  If you, for people that don't live in a leftist area, you have no idea how they've
[3:04:58.120 --> 3:05:01.080]  radicalized right down to the grassroots and they're there
[3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:06.120]  barking at everyone, not just, I mean, they are pushing it, it's their religion.
[3:05:06.120 --> 3:05:11.320]  The left are converted to Satanism. But in contrast, for example, in rural
[3:05:11.320 --> 3:05:14.680]  Utah and rural Idaho, you never hear public school teachers
[3:05:14.680 --> 3:05:18.840]  propagandize about transgender, about gays or other types of
[3:05:18.840 --> 3:05:21.720]  things. Well, where do they propagandize about America and freedom in the
[3:05:21.720 --> 3:05:24.440]  New World Order? Don't do that. Well, I wish they would.
[3:05:24.440 --> 3:05:28.200]  The point is they don't because of the standardized state curriculum.
[3:05:28.200 --> 3:05:31.320]  No, I agree, but we need to get on the other way. We need to counter it.
[3:05:31.320 --> 3:05:34.680]  No, I understand. But the only way really to counter that, you're never going to win
[3:05:34.680 --> 3:05:37.320]  the public school battle because they're run by government schools.
[3:05:37.320 --> 3:05:39.240]  Is that just to get your kids off? You've got to get your kids off.
[3:05:39.240 --> 3:05:41.240]  That's the one good side of COVID is people are...
[3:05:41.240 --> 3:05:44.200]  That's right. It's the one great positive. There's two great positives.
[3:05:44.200 --> 3:05:47.880]  Driving people out of the medical system, which they should get out of it, is
[3:05:47.880 --> 3:05:52.760]  driving people out of public schools. And those are the two biggest victories,
[3:05:52.760 --> 3:05:56.600]  which the globalists are resenting right now. And they're trying to stop people
[3:05:56.600 --> 3:05:59.480]  from leaving the public schools. They're telling them they can't leave
[3:05:59.480 --> 3:06:03.240]  because of COVID, but they can. The Home School Legal Defense Fund or
[3:06:03.240 --> 3:06:07.480]  Organization is the largest. And boy, they'll come to bat. They'll
[3:06:07.480 --> 3:06:11.480]  put a letter to that school board and inform that you've got to let those
[3:06:11.480 --> 3:06:14.760]  people out because that's the state law. And again, it's all intimidation. You
[3:06:14.760 --> 3:06:18.120]  got to take a vaccine. No, not the law. You got to stay in public school, not the
[3:06:18.120 --> 3:06:21.320]  law. But the people perish for lack of knowledge as well. We're laying out
[3:06:21.320 --> 3:06:25.640]  heavy knowledge here today with Joel Scalzen. He's got a lot more to cover.
[3:06:25.640 --> 3:06:28.920]  Also want to get into just for rioting and breaking down society. We're safe.
[3:06:28.920 --> 3:06:31.880]  What the most dangerous parts of the rest of the world are, some safer areas in the
[3:06:31.880 --> 3:06:37.640]  world. Yeah, with Joel Scalzen of World Affairs Brief.com. I'm with band.video.
[3:06:37.640 --> 3:06:41.320]  It's got all these doctors and press conferences getting banned. They're all
[3:06:41.320 --> 3:06:44.120]  there right now. There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones
[3:06:44.120 --> 3:06:49.080]  plastic mask at infowarstore.com. You can wear them out to political events. You
[3:06:49.080 --> 3:06:53.240]  can trigger it. Live darts. But one of the biggest reasons is it's a great
[3:06:53.240 --> 3:06:59.320]  conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween. But on top of that,
[3:06:59.320 --> 3:07:02.520]  they admit that wearing these masks is absolutely nothing to protect you from
[3:07:02.520 --> 3:07:06.280]  COVID-19 or anything else. It's total virtues signaling to show that you're
[3:07:06.280 --> 3:07:10.120]  prepared for the force inoculations and contact tracing of their openly
[3:07:10.120 --> 3:07:14.120]  announcing. It's an act of submission. It's an act of like putting a burqa on your
[3:07:14.120 --> 3:07:18.600]  head and bowing down. But a big reason to wear these is then in the stores,
[3:07:18.600 --> 3:07:22.600]  when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask, say it's just as useless
[3:07:22.600 --> 3:07:27.240]  as the stupid cloth masks that you're wearing. And the M95 mask,
[3:07:27.240 --> 3:07:31.480]  only control what's coming in, not what's going out. So they quote spread COVID-19.
[3:07:31.480 --> 3:07:34.600]  They don't protect from it. So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these
[3:07:34.600 --> 3:07:38.920]  control free spaces. You buy one for $9.95. You get four more free. They're at
[3:07:38.920 --> 3:07:43.080]  cost infowarstore.com.
[3:07:51.080 --> 3:07:54.280]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[3:07:54.280 --> 3:07:59.560]  Where did it come from? Where did it come from?

[3:11:18.280 --> 3:11:21.880]  Scowson of World Affairs Brief, one of the top
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:25.960]  secure home experts, strategic relocation experts in the country
[3:11:25.960 --> 3:11:28.520]  and survivalists in the country. Please continue.
[3:11:28.520 --> 3:11:31.400]  Well, we were talking about the fact that everything has changed a little bit in
[3:11:31.400 --> 3:11:35.080]  terms of my ratings in the book about safety because of the Republican
[3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:38.200]  governor's going along with this COVID-19 threat.
[3:11:38.200 --> 3:11:42.200]  And I put about a map, for example, in the latest issue of the World Affairs
[3:11:42.200 --> 3:11:45.800]  Brief, that has a link to all of the cities and
[3:11:45.800 --> 3:11:48.920]  counties that have mask mandates and those that don't.
[3:11:48.920 --> 3:11:54.280]  And there are only some 17 states that do not have an actual mask mandate in the
[3:11:54.280 --> 3:11:59.320]  United States. And of those, 14 of those
[3:11:59.320 --> 3:12:04.440]  states are Republican governors. But even in those states, Democrat-led
[3:12:04.440 --> 3:12:07.800]  governors in cities, for example, you can see the
[3:12:07.800 --> 3:12:12.520]  orange in this map in Idaho and Utah and other places, there are
[3:12:12.520 --> 3:12:15.240]  pockets where they have mask mandates because the
[3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:18.760]  state has allowed the Democratic managers to.
[3:12:18.760 --> 3:12:22.200]  And this is really a good bellwether or gauge of how
[3:12:22.200 --> 3:12:25.960]  submissive to the UN these areas are because this is all coming from the UN.
[3:12:25.960 --> 3:12:30.440]  That's right. And so it's important if, and by the way, if any of your listeners
[3:12:30.440 --> 3:12:33.960]  want to get a copy of that World Affairs Brief, and by the way, the whole
[3:12:33.960 --> 3:12:38.520]  issue is about the scientific evidence against the COVID claims by government.
[3:12:38.520 --> 3:12:43.000]  And so I spend the whole issue talking about how the masks do not
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:47.720]  protect, why the tests are invalid, and all the scientific evidence, why the
[3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:51.480]  deaths are overrated. It debunks every single claim the
[3:12:51.480 --> 3:12:54.600]  government makes. It's in this edition of the World Affairs Brief.
[3:12:54.600 --> 3:12:57.640]  So people need to get this, they can get a free copy of the email, and they need to
[3:12:57.640 --> 3:13:02.920]  share it. Yeah, you email me at editor at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[3:13:02.920 --> 3:13:07.480]  Editor at worldaffairsbrief.com for a free copy of this, and this is meant to
[3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:11.320]  share. Forget about the copyright, you can pass this along to anybody
[3:13:11.320 --> 3:13:14.520]  to let them know that this is the ammunition you need to counter.
[3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:18.280]  And it's good, it's good, I've read it. I saw you talking about it with David
[3:13:18.280 --> 3:13:21.880]  Knight this morning, you're going to be back on the war room today as well.
[3:13:21.880 --> 3:13:25.560]  So get that free copy and share that with us. Editor at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[3:13:25.560 --> 3:13:30.120]  Right, so let's talk about some more cities. A lot of people talk about,
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:34.360]  shall I go to Alaska? Well, Alaska has some tempting things because it's
[3:13:34.360 --> 3:13:38.040]  really remote, it's really away, and it's safe in some regards, except for the
[3:13:38.040 --> 3:13:40.520]  fact it's right across the Bering Strait from Russia.
[3:13:40.520 --> 3:13:44.200]  There will be an invasion in the war for Russia.
[3:13:44.200 --> 3:13:48.760]  But the more important thing, even in the good times, is that it's very difficult
[3:13:48.760 --> 3:13:53.000]  to be self-sufficient in Alaska. It's very difficult to grow anything
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:54.840]  almost impossible. It's almost like moving to the moon.
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:13:58.520]  Yeah, and things are very expensive because it's like being on an island.
[3:13:58.520 --> 3:14:02.040]  Everything has to be shipped in. Also, the weather is horrendous.
[3:14:02.040 --> 3:14:06.360]  For example, if you take a cruise ship to Alaska, you'll find they'll warn you
[3:14:06.360 --> 3:14:11.000]  there are only 12 sunny days in Alaska in the southern portion of
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:14.440]  Alaska, 12 out of the entire year. And if you're happy to get to one of those 12,
[3:14:14.440 --> 3:14:18.040]  you're going to see the sun in Alaska. Now, it's beautiful. There's a lot of
[3:14:18.040 --> 3:14:20.760]  trees, a lot of wildlife, et cetera. But remember,
[3:14:20.760 --> 3:14:24.920]  not a good location unless you're going to be a very experienced outdoorsman.
[3:14:24.920 --> 3:14:28.920]  If you had to be there, would you want to be down here in the peninsula?
[3:14:28.920 --> 3:14:33.720]  Yes, either in either west, east of Anchorage or down in the peninsula,
[3:14:33.720 --> 3:14:36.760]  where you've got the milder temperatures and weather.
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:39.800]  But remember, it's also in the Ring of Fire. There's a lot of earthquakes,
[3:14:39.800 --> 3:14:45.960]  especially along the Aleutian chain. So it's not safe from earthquake threats.
[3:14:45.960 --> 3:14:50.360]  Let's look at Arizona, for example. This is a popular destination for Californians.
[3:14:50.360 --> 3:14:55.880]  That's why the Phoenix area is growing. It's crime-ridden now. It used to be that Mesa and Chandler,
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:14:59.720]  which used to be Mormon colonies in this area, very conservative, now they have
[3:14:59.720 --> 3:15:04.920]  turned almost democratic because they're being invaded by the California.
[3:15:04.920 --> 3:15:10.360]  Scottsdale is the Ritzy area and a target of a lot of the Antifa protests.
[3:15:10.360 --> 3:15:14.840]  What the hell's wrong with Californians that they leave it and bring their brainwashing?
[3:15:14.840 --> 3:15:15.800]  I guess they're just zombies.
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:24.280]  But the safer areas of Arizona are this band from Flagstab down through Payson, Arizona,
[3:15:24.280 --> 3:15:31.480]  over to Sholo. This is all high desert, forested country, and they do get a little bit of snow
[3:15:31.480 --> 3:15:37.480]  in the wintertime. But it is far enough from the Phoenix area to at least provide some safety.
[3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:41.400]  I don't recommend the Navajo reservation area, of course, because it is on Navajo
[3:15:41.400 --> 3:15:46.520]  and Atlanta. Ever since the Supreme Court ruled that the treaties in Oklahoma are invalid and
[3:15:46.520 --> 3:15:50.040]  that Oklahoma doesn't, in fact, have jurisdiction over a third of Oklahoma.
[3:15:50.040 --> 3:15:55.880]  That makes me more towards anarchy. It's just open to Pandora's box in that regard.
[3:15:55.880 --> 3:16:05.000]  And so this is the gold zone of Arizona in terms of retreating area. It's a pretty good area if
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:09.480]  you're going to be in Arizona. Let's look a little bit of California because California,
[3:16:09.480 --> 3:16:14.280]  if it weren't for the democratic social state of California, would be a great state to live in in
[3:16:14.280 --> 3:16:20.360]  terms of demographics. You have this beautiful central valley growing. You have the massive Sierra
[3:16:20.360 --> 3:16:26.520]  of Madre mountain, which provide a great deal of retreats, beautiful pine, forested lakes. But
[3:16:26.520 --> 3:16:31.720]  it's overrun now and controlled by the California Environmental Commission, so that it's very
[3:16:31.720 --> 3:16:36.360]  difficult to build. There's extreme restrictions on everything that you build in California.
[3:16:36.920 --> 3:16:40.760]  And there's lots of nuclear targets. This is the main danger nuclear target.
[3:16:40.760 --> 3:16:45.560]  And there's the earthquakes. Yes. And I've got the earthquake map,
[3:16:45.560 --> 3:16:50.680]  since you mentioned that this is important to see. This is the earthquake map in here,
[3:16:50.680 --> 3:16:55.720]  and you can see that this ring of fire here in California is all in red. And it's a massive
[3:16:55.720 --> 3:16:59.240]  earthquake waiting to happen. The big one is going to destroy a lot of those communities.
[3:16:59.240 --> 3:17:04.920]  And they say it's overdue. And it's long overdue. There's also this large earthquake area around
[3:17:04.920 --> 3:17:11.720]  the Missouri area of eastern Tennessee, Mississippi, Mississippi, etc. But this is the
[3:17:11.720 --> 3:17:16.440]  new Madrid fault. And when that thing goes off, that shakes the entire countryside,
[3:17:16.440 --> 3:17:20.120]  clear over to Boston, top of chimneys. The last time it went off in Boston,
[3:17:20.120 --> 3:17:24.920]  because it's so bad, it's changed the direct. I mean, it's changed the way that Mississippi
[3:17:24.920 --> 3:17:32.200]  ran backwards during that. It's very, very serious. We'll be right back. We got two more segments.
[3:17:32.200 --> 3:17:36.280]  It's a crazy world we live in. We'll talk about where all the globalists are moving to on the
[3:17:36.280 --> 3:17:43.640]  other side. Stay with us. We close and lock our doors and windows at night. Not because we're
[3:17:43.640 --> 3:17:49.320]  doing anything wrong, but because it's about privacy and it's about security. And it's something
[3:17:49.320 --> 3:17:54.120]  that we do to protect ourselves going back thousands of years when we would post a dog
[3:17:54.120 --> 3:17:58.360]  or a sentry at the entrance of the village. So we would know if predators or criminals were coming.
[3:17:58.360 --> 3:18:03.080]  Well, big tech, along with the federal government and other globalist organizations,
[3:18:03.080 --> 3:18:07.960]  have been tracking everybody illegally for years with their cell phones. But now the public is
[3:18:07.960 --> 3:18:12.680]  finally waking up because the enemy has openly announced it's the fact. And the Clinton Foundation,
[3:18:12.680 --> 3:18:17.400]  Global Initiative with Chelsea, is running the private system to spy on you and your family.
[3:18:17.400 --> 3:18:21.640]  That's right. The Democrats, the globalists, the chai cops, they've all got our number. They're
[3:18:21.640 --> 3:18:26.680]  tracking us in lifetime. But with Privacy Pockets, the best system at infowarstore.com,
[3:18:26.680 --> 3:18:31.960]  you can protect yourself and your family by keeping your cell phone inside of the little pouch.
[3:18:31.960 --> 3:18:35.400]  We're selling more of these in a day than we used to sell in a month because American
[3:18:35.400 --> 3:18:39.960]  and the world is waking up. Get yours at infowarstore.com and go stealth.
[3:18:39.960 --> 3:18:44.200]  One of our best-selling products is living defense. And it's been sold out for over
[3:18:44.200 --> 3:18:48.120]  four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic. We've got a limited
[3:18:48.120 --> 3:18:51.960]  supply right now, but it's selling out fast. And I want those of you that haven't experienced
[3:18:51.960 --> 3:18:55.320]  living defense to get it for yourself. Here's just part of one testimonial.
[3:18:55.320 --> 3:19:00.520]  I looked. In January, 2016, I went in a hospital. I went to VA hospital out here in Boystein. I was
[3:19:00.520 --> 3:19:05.240]  in there until June. And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to
[3:19:05.240 --> 3:19:10.360]  info wars three hours a day. And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living
[3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:15.320]  defense. Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem and I stuck with it
[3:19:15.320 --> 3:19:20.040]  for about five or six years. And the doctors, they tried every time. Nobody could figure out what it
[3:19:20.040 --> 3:19:23.720]  is. And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[3:19:23.720 --> 3:19:27.000]  you know what? I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense. Now, I wasn't supposed
[3:19:27.000 --> 3:19:30.520]  to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff, but I ordered it, had it
[3:19:30.520 --> 3:19:35.800]  shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man. That stuff changed my
[3:19:35.800 --> 3:19:42.280]  life. It saved my life. Alex Jones and info wars saved my life. It's Christmas in July. We ran the
[3:19:42.280 --> 3:19:47.400]  sale last year. It was very, very popular. And so I am now announcing that we are running it again
[3:19:47.400 --> 3:19:54.120]  in the year 2020, a very important election year. And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think
[3:19:54.120 --> 3:19:59.320]  should be the campaign shirt of 2020. It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings,
[3:19:59.320 --> 3:20:05.240]  sitting at top of Betsy Ross flag. And the shirts are on sale right now in Fuller store.com.
[3:20:05.880 --> 3:20:11.160]  I got the idea for the Trump campaign, having a similar shirt media called Nazi, which of course,
[3:20:11.160 --> 3:20:14.760]  it isn't. And since it's so triggering to the leftist, the globalist, well, we're going to make
[3:20:14.760 --> 3:20:20.040]  sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and exercise our first amendment
[3:20:20.040 --> 3:20:25.240]  in the face of these times. We also have store live free shipping, double Patriot points. So
[3:20:25.240 --> 3:20:29.720]  whatever great item it is that you want, store live free shipping, double Patriot points on
[3:20:29.720 --> 3:20:34.840]  your next order and at least 50% off across the board. Now I'm going to have to get this sale
[3:20:34.840 --> 3:20:37.880]  very, very soon because all these products are about to sell out and stick advantage of it right
[3:20:37.880 --> 3:20:55.480]  now in Fuller store.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Live, raw and unfiltered
[3:20:55.480 --> 3:21:06.120]  by globalist propaganda. It's Alex Jones. I'm telling you, at my house, I've got the first
[3:21:06.120 --> 3:21:11.000]  edition, the second edition, the third edition, like I've got right here in my hand and I've read
[3:21:11.000 --> 3:21:15.960]  this three or four times and the amount of detail, just because I know Texas, I know a few other
[3:21:15.960 --> 3:21:20.840]  states very well. And I go down and look at it and it's just really good information. I don't
[3:21:20.840 --> 3:21:24.280]  think if there's any other book out there like this, strategic relocation or the American guide
[3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:29.480]  to safe places, this is edition three, we now have got edition four in at infowarstore.com.
[3:21:29.480 --> 3:21:34.040]  And you even got an updated edition five, you were telling me, but Amazon suddenly won't accept it.
[3:21:34.040 --> 3:21:38.600]  They took down the listing. I mean, and they're doing this now, I've heard it with a few titles,
[3:21:38.600 --> 3:21:44.120]  now it's thousands of titles, especially authoritative self-help. They don't want people
[3:21:44.120 --> 3:21:48.440]  to have knowledge. They want us, I mean, here's the thing, they want us domesticated in mega cities,
[3:21:48.440 --> 3:21:53.160]  locked down to control us. We've always known that, but now they really are traps. And sure,
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:59.080]  I live in the suburb, but that's not good enough, Joe. If I had to commute even 30, 40 minutes to
[3:21:59.080 --> 3:22:04.520]  work, 50 minutes, where would you live outside Austin? If from this point right here, let's say
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:10.680]  45 minutes, where would you go? Toward the Hill Country. Gotta get out West because the threats
[3:22:10.680 --> 3:22:16.760]  are all East. So gotta go West. And like you said, though, because of all the rich Californians,
[3:22:16.760 --> 3:22:22.440]  because they're inflated real estate, they all moved here. I cannot afford, you know, the kind
[3:22:22.440 --> 3:22:27.560]  of place 20, 30, 40 acres in a house. I mean, I lived out in the Hill Country and then the divorce
[3:22:27.560 --> 3:22:32.440]  of my ex-wife got that. It was just nine acres, but it was on Barton Creek and it had fruit trees
[3:22:32.440 --> 3:22:36.840]  and stuff, and we had a big garden. But I mean, that's scary if, you know, I'm not a rich guy,
[3:22:36.840 --> 3:22:40.760]  but Alex Jones can't get a piece of property away from this. Imagine the average family.
[3:22:40.760 --> 3:22:45.000]  What can they do? That's another question. Yeah, that's the big compromise that has to be,
[3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:48.840]  is if you can't move out far enough, that's where the cheaper land is. For example, there's a great
[3:22:48.840 --> 3:22:53.640]  deal of land north of the Hill Country that's actually very, very rural. It's not as hilly.
[3:22:53.640 --> 3:23:00.840]  It's not as hidden behind hills. Where is that? Let me get the protection. I don't want to interrupt
[3:23:00.840 --> 3:23:05.880]  you with all the stuff. But anyway, it's north of the Hill Country, and it's a very good farm in
[3:23:05.880 --> 3:23:11.960]  Ranchland, and it's a lot cheaper up there. So we'll talk about that afterwards. But let me
[3:23:11.960 --> 3:23:16.760]  take a break from talking about the state is to talk about how you plan and exit from the city.
[3:23:16.760 --> 3:23:20.360]  If you've got a retreat outside the city, you have to live within an area, and this is,
[3:23:20.360 --> 3:23:24.760]  I picked a very bad area, Newark, New Jersey. Explain that. You're like, you still have to
[3:23:24.760 --> 3:23:29.960]  work in a city, but build your emergency valve. So you've got a retreat that's outside into the
[3:23:29.960 --> 3:23:35.560]  country. How do you get out of the big city? This is not an easy proposition. If you can focus in
[3:23:35.560 --> 3:23:42.360]  on this map with the camera, I've got the Newark area here, and I've got a person who's lived in
[3:23:42.360 --> 3:23:48.040]  Livingston, New Jersey. So he's got to get out of this area to Newton, which is a very rural area
[3:23:48.040 --> 3:23:53.400]  and a good retreat area. He's got to get around the Picatinny Arsenal, which is a nuclear target.
[3:23:54.120 --> 3:24:00.120]  But the big problem is this beltway, 287, that goes around Newark. This is like a moat around
[3:24:00.120 --> 3:24:05.240]  the city, and you've got them in New York, you've got them in Atlanta, sometimes two beltways.
[3:24:05.240 --> 3:24:11.720]  And the problem with a beltway is that you can't get across the beltway in most cases without
[3:24:11.720 --> 3:24:17.400]  encountering an exit or an entrance to the freeway. Now, I can guarantee you that in any crisis,
[3:24:17.400 --> 3:24:21.800]  those exits and entrance to the freeways are going to be blocked with cars trying to get on
[3:24:21.800 --> 3:24:25.960]  or off the freeway, and you're not going to be able to get through the beltway on those areas.
[3:24:25.960 --> 3:24:29.560]  And so if you look at... And people are going to erect, there's going to be fights, it's going to get
[3:24:29.560 --> 3:24:34.200]  clogged. And so just like in Katrina, it just gets clogged, it's gridlocked, and you can't get on
[3:24:34.200 --> 3:24:39.160]  the freeway. So you've got to get past the beltway. How do you do it? Well, you get on Google Maps,
[3:24:39.160 --> 3:24:43.640]  and you get on the satellite view, and you zoom in on this, you start following it around until
[3:24:43.640 --> 3:24:49.880]  you find a spot like this where it crosses under the freeway, and there's no entrance onto the
[3:24:49.880 --> 3:24:55.640]  freeway or exit off. There are several of those in every beltway going around, an under overpass
[3:24:55.640 --> 3:25:00.360]  that goes past without an exit or an entrance. That's what you want to find. That's your escape
[3:25:00.360 --> 3:25:05.480]  route. That's how you get past the beltway. Now, you have other obstacles to find. You have streams
[3:25:05.480 --> 3:25:10.040]  to go across with had bridges. If there's a bridge that's blocked, or the road is blocked,
[3:25:10.040 --> 3:25:14.520]  you can't get off and get around. So you want to try to pick an exit route that avoids as many
[3:25:14.520 --> 3:25:21.240]  bridges as possible, and as well to go past this interstate 80, you got to get under the freeway
[3:25:21.240 --> 3:25:26.680]  in an area, and that's what I found there. So this is just an example of how you plan an exit route
[3:25:26.680 --> 3:25:31.320]  if you're in a major city, and you have to get out past these blocks. And people don't think
[3:25:31.320 --> 3:25:35.640]  like this. We just think it always goes on forever, but we see it breaking down. This is normal
[3:25:35.640 --> 3:25:40.200]  thoughts that people need to be engaged in. That's right. And you have to plan secondary routes. You
[3:25:40.200 --> 3:25:45.880]  don't want to get on these secondary red roads. You want on the residential or rural roads that
[3:25:45.880 --> 3:25:51.240]  people normally won't take in an exit scenario so that you can get on. It's a little bit slower,
[3:25:51.240 --> 3:25:56.120]  but it's a lot faster than the road blocks on the... Now, you haven't written the sexy book,
[3:25:56.120 --> 3:25:59.320]  or maybe I don't know about you did, but I mean, the truth is, after a breakdown of society,
[3:25:59.320 --> 3:26:04.120]  there's going to be a lot of vigilantism, a lot of roving gangs, a lot of criminals. The good news
[3:26:04.120 --> 3:26:08.520]  is his patriot militias are springing up even in Minnesota as there's no law and order. But
[3:26:08.520 --> 3:26:13.160]  wow, what will it look like after a collapse? Well, it is going to look like a Mad Max scenario
[3:26:13.160 --> 3:26:18.280]  within the major metro areas. I mean, you're talking about Rome. You look at what's happening
[3:26:18.280 --> 3:26:23.480]  in Antifa and the police standing down. This only encourages violent activity and criminal
[3:26:23.480 --> 3:26:27.320]  activity. And you're going to have people just literally breaking into every store stealing.
[3:26:27.320 --> 3:26:32.120]  And once it's stolen, they start moving out to the suburbs. And once they've pillaged the suburbs,
[3:26:32.120 --> 3:26:35.960]  they're starting moving out further. And they stay generally to the main paved roads, though.
[3:26:36.680 --> 3:26:41.480]  Very rarely. It's very interesting. There's a very herd mentality to mobocracy,
[3:26:41.480 --> 3:26:45.400]  which stays to the main paved... In fact, they'll even go between Houston and Dallas,
[3:26:45.400 --> 3:26:50.360]  not thinking the Dallas itself has to be melted down. But that's the way mobs think.
[3:26:50.360 --> 3:26:55.480]  They go between major cities. And only when they find or get there that it's completely pillaged,
[3:26:55.480 --> 3:26:59.560]  do they start going out on the suburbs. So suburbs are your friend if you're out in a rural area,
[3:26:59.560 --> 3:27:03.320]  because they will absorb... And a lot of people in the suburbs will go ahead. They're going to
[3:27:03.320 --> 3:27:08.120]  wipe out a lot of these people. Yeah. And, you know, if you think you're in a suburb and you have a...
[3:27:08.120 --> 3:27:10.680]  And I'm not looking forward to it. When I made the joke about I'll eat my neighbors,
[3:27:10.680 --> 3:27:13.400]  that was a joke. I said it was a joke to go to context. But I mean,
[3:27:14.120 --> 3:27:18.280]  they got pending on study. So then 15 days, the average person does become a cannibal or kill
[3:27:18.280 --> 3:27:22.200]  themselves with no food. And I mean, just imagine what this will be like. Well, you know, there
[3:27:22.200 --> 3:27:26.760]  are people with conscience that wouldn't become that even under dire circumstances. And that's
[3:27:26.760 --> 3:27:31.400]  what's going to be the dividing line between society. Who has got enough self-control to listen
[3:27:31.400 --> 3:27:35.960]  to conscience, not to panic, not to start to be a predator versus others. Well, I agree,
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:40.120]  but listen to conscience and be ready beforehand. That's right. My conscience has never been so
[3:27:40.120 --> 3:27:45.080]  intense as get out, get ready, get out, get ready. I mean, it's like a banging drum now.
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:51.480]  And one of the problems that we have demographic wise in the United States that our conservative
[3:27:51.480 --> 3:27:57.720]  base is all integrated within the major cities and overwhelmed by democratic majorities. One of
[3:27:57.720 --> 3:28:03.000]  the benefits of the crises that are coming in the future, I believe, Alex, is that the
[3:28:03.640 --> 3:28:08.040]  there'll no longer be a reason for good Christian conservatives to stay within the cities because
[3:28:08.040 --> 3:28:13.240]  the jobs are gone. It's it's pillaging. It's there's no reason to go. They're going to totally
[3:28:13.240 --> 3:28:18.920]  explode. So what happens is it drives the good people out of the cities. And it's my feeling
[3:28:18.920 --> 3:28:24.040]  hopefully that under the direction of the Lord, they'll be guided through inspiration to seek out
[3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:28.920]  and find places of refuge, conservative places where there will be new majority somebody. That's
[3:28:28.920 --> 3:28:33.240]  my hope for the future, even though I'm pessimistic about ever beating the deep state about ever
[3:28:33.240 --> 3:28:37.160]  returning America to the liberal. The answer is just being good ourselves, living on the land,
[3:28:37.160 --> 3:28:42.440]  having community and and and that is building the remnant. That's right. And building the remnant,
[3:28:42.440 --> 3:28:46.040]  you and I are trying to do that with these broadcasts, trying to reach people who sense
[3:28:46.040 --> 3:28:50.040]  that something's wrong. If we have to work too hard to convince you, if you don't sense that
[3:28:50.040 --> 3:28:54.280]  something's phony about this COVID thing, then I can't help you. But if you sense that something's
[3:28:54.280 --> 3:28:58.840]  wrong, I've got the information out. Alex has got the information help. But you have to prepare
[3:28:58.840 --> 3:29:04.280]  in advance. It's really a problem. If you are in those refugee flows, trying to get out of new
[3:29:04.280 --> 3:29:08.920]  work in New Jersey and start from scratch somewhere else, even though people will help you and take
[3:29:08.920 --> 3:29:13.720]  you in as only a limited amount of people could do in a rural area to absorb these masses. That's
[3:29:13.720 --> 3:29:20.120]  why I'm encouraging people to seek out retreat properties in advance, even if it's finding
[3:29:20.120 --> 3:29:25.640]  a relative that will take them in and helping stockpile supplies. If you're doing a long-term
[3:29:25.640 --> 3:29:30.440]  retreat. Exactly. A relative that has a barn, you say, I'll fix the barn, I'll put supplies in it,
[3:29:30.440 --> 3:29:34.680]  put a four-wheeler in it, and everything collapses. And families, they want you to come out there.
[3:29:34.680 --> 3:29:38.920]  That's right. You know, people need to stockpile even if you're going to go a long way. You need
[3:29:38.920 --> 3:29:43.880]  to stockpile fuel, for example, at a neighbor's or a friend's house or something on the way. If you're
[3:29:43.880 --> 3:29:48.200]  young enough, I encourage people to learn to get a pilot's license. I don't care if they shut down
[3:29:48.200 --> 3:29:54.600]  the air traffic system. I can jump in my airplane from a non-towered airport and fly low and, you
[3:29:54.600 --> 3:29:56.840]  know. Well, that's what I was talking about. Me and my dad were talking about that because he's been
[3:29:56.840 --> 3:30:01.320]  a pilot. It is how important it is to just have a way to get out because, I mean, private flight
[3:30:01.320 --> 3:30:06.760]  is the way to go. What do you think of helicopters? Well, helicopters don't have quite the range of
[3:30:06.760 --> 3:30:11.640]  fixed-wing aircraft. They're slower. Their maximum speed is about 150 miles an hour for a big,
[3:30:11.640 --> 3:30:19.400]  powerful helicopter. And at that limited weight, in the helicopters, you can afford a small two
[3:30:19.400 --> 3:30:23.800]  or four-place, you know, there's still, you know, several hundred thousand dollars. Yeah, the Ravens.
[3:30:23.800 --> 3:30:28.600]  The Ravens. That's right. But still, if you can afford it, that's a great way to get out and to
[3:30:28.600 --> 3:30:32.360]  land anywhere you want to. I was about to say, you can have that jump out to your retreat and always
[3:30:32.360 --> 3:30:37.400]  have get away. You can go 150, 200 miles, get to your retreat, have fuel and stuff there. Yes.
[3:30:37.400 --> 3:31:03.400]  That's what we're looking at. We'll be right back.
[3:31:08.360 --> 3:31:15.880]  a
[3:31:15.880 --> 3:31:22.520]  advancement that we just fell into. It's been preplanned, organized globally, and it's extremely
[3:31:22.520 --> 3:31:29.160]  predatory. And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks
[3:31:29.160 --> 3:31:35.960]  that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power. This is
[3:31:35.960 --> 3:31:39.400]  is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[3:31:39.400 --> 3:31:43.800]  We are selling more privacy pockets a day
[3:31:43.800 --> 3:31:46.560]  than we were previously selling in a month
[3:31:46.560 --> 3:31:49.000]  because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact
[3:31:49.000 --> 3:31:50.960]  tracing and admittedly with Google and Apple
[3:31:50.960 --> 3:31:52.840]  tracking all Americans on their phones,
[3:31:52.840 --> 3:31:55.240]  even if you opt out of it or get rid of the apps.
[3:31:55.240 --> 3:31:57.680]  People realize these criminal groups
[3:31:57.680 --> 3:32:00.000]  are surveilling you and selling your data
[3:32:00.000 --> 3:32:02.120]  and using it to control your life,
[3:32:02.120 --> 3:32:05.080]  sharing it with Antifa, sharing it with Black Lives Matter,
[3:32:05.080 --> 3:32:08.160]  sharing it with the deep state to oppress not just high-profile
[3:32:08.160 --> 3:32:09.920]  people, but the general public.
[3:32:09.920 --> 3:32:12.800]  That's why folks are taking back control of their lives
[3:32:12.800 --> 3:32:14.880]  with these little Faraday cages that you
[3:32:14.880 --> 3:32:17.360]  can put your cell phones in that knock out
[3:32:17.360 --> 3:32:20.400]  the ability of the cell towers to ping it every few seconds
[3:32:20.400 --> 3:32:21.880]  and track your location.
[3:32:21.880 --> 3:32:24.160]  This is the only way to have your privacy,
[3:32:24.160 --> 3:32:25.920]  and people are taking their privacy back.
[3:32:25.920 --> 3:32:27.400]  It's very, very exciting.

[3:33:39.720 --> 3:33:42.920]  The BBC is state-run media in the UK,
[3:33:42.920 --> 3:33:45.360]  and they've come out with a detailed article that's
[3:33:45.360 --> 3:33:49.000]  linked on InfoWars.com saying, you
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:52.000]  will have to have force inoculations multiple times
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:54.360]  a year to be able to travel.
[3:33:54.360 --> 3:33:56.720]  Robots will scan you when you land.
[3:33:56.720 --> 3:33:59.680]  You will have a digital tattoo under your skin
[3:33:59.680 --> 3:34:01.160]  to be able to enter the country.
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:04.080]  But it's going to be so easy and so cool and so fun.
[3:34:04.080 --> 3:34:06.040]  The Microsoft website now officially
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:08.160]  has announced the digital tattoo.
[3:34:08.160 --> 3:34:09.920]  We exposed this six months ago.
[3:34:09.920 --> 3:34:11.120]  Now Bill Gates was funding it.
[3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:12.960]  And they had hundreds of news articles attacking
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:14.760]  and saying it wasn't true.
[3:34:14.760 --> 3:34:16.360]  This is a tactic they use.
[3:34:16.360 --> 3:34:17.320]  First they announce it.
[3:34:17.320 --> 3:34:18.400]  We say it's a bad idea.
[3:34:18.400 --> 3:34:19.320]  They say, that's crazy.
[3:34:19.320 --> 3:34:20.480]  We didn't do it.
[3:34:20.480 --> 3:34:21.680]  They introduce the idea to you.
[3:34:21.680 --> 3:34:23.560]  Then they come back and announce it again,
[3:34:23.560 --> 3:34:25.200]  thinking you have no memory.
[3:34:25.200 --> 3:34:27.480]  This is a criminal takeover.
[3:34:27.480 --> 3:34:29.560]  This is the line in the sand.
[3:34:29.560 --> 3:34:30.800]  We must say no.
[3:34:30.800 --> 3:34:33.200]  We must expose the fraud of COVID-19.
[3:34:33.200 --> 3:34:35.680]  This entire house of evil is built on.
[3:34:35.680 --> 3:34:36.600]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:34:36.600 --> 3:34:37.760]  Never surrender to tyranny.
[3:34:37.760 --> 3:34:38.600]  InfoWars.com.
[3:34:38.600 --> 3:34:51.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:34:51.600 --> 3:34:56.600]  Welcome back.
[3:34:56.600 --> 3:35:00.600]  Final segment of the powerful four-hour transmission.
[3:35:00.600 --> 3:35:02.600]  The War Room of the Destroyer, loaded for bear,
[3:35:02.600 --> 3:35:06.600]  is coming up in T minus, 13 minutes.
[3:35:06.600 --> 3:35:10.000]  And boy, I tell you, Bill Gates coming out and admitting,
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:11.440]  OK, we've got digital tattoos.
[3:35:11.440 --> 3:35:13.200]  You're going to need this to be able to travel on airplanes
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:14.000]  or have a job.
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:16.920]  That all came out yesterday.
[3:35:16.920 --> 3:35:18.240]  First they announced it.
[3:35:18.240 --> 3:35:19.120]  Then we criticize it.
[3:35:19.120 --> 3:35:20.120]  They say it doesn't exist.
[3:35:20.120 --> 3:35:21.600]  Then they come out and announce it again.
[3:35:21.600 --> 3:35:23.400]  That's the tactic they're engaged in.
[3:35:23.400 --> 3:35:25.800]  Phil Scousen, worldaffairsbrief.com.
[3:35:25.800 --> 3:35:28.760]  People can send an email to editor at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[3:35:28.760 --> 3:35:30.960]  We'll send them a special edition free of the newsletter,
[3:35:30.960 --> 3:35:33.200]  breaking down the COVID hoax that you hope people will
[3:35:33.200 --> 3:35:33.960]  share with others.
[3:35:33.960 --> 3:35:35.880]  It's one mind at a time, folks.
[3:35:35.880 --> 3:35:37.560]  This is beyond critical.
[3:35:37.560 --> 3:35:42.120]  That's why they had 15 or plus medical doctors at Capitol Hill.
[3:35:42.120 --> 3:35:42.960]  They did a press conference.
[3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:43.960]  They got millions of views.
[3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:46.880]  And Twitter took it down and blocked the president's tweet
[3:35:46.880 --> 3:35:50.840]  and put the president's son in Twitter lockup.
[3:35:50.840 --> 3:35:53.920]  I mean, this is unbelievable in America
[3:35:53.920 --> 3:35:56.320]  that medical doctors can't have a press conference
[3:35:56.320 --> 3:35:58.560]  and expose what's really going on with COVID-19,
[3:35:58.560 --> 3:36:00.320]  because they said the UN is the only authority.
[3:36:00.320 --> 3:36:02.240]  Phil Scousen, you're talking about Colorado.
[3:36:02.240 --> 3:36:04.000]  Is Colorado a good place?
[3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:06.160]  A lot of elites are living there. Why?
[3:36:06.160 --> 3:36:08.240]  Well, the problem is a lot of the elites know.
[3:36:08.240 --> 3:36:11.120]  I mean, retired FBI, CIA, NSA, they're
[3:36:11.120 --> 3:36:13.280]  building retreats and the ski resorts and things like that.
[3:36:13.280 --> 3:36:14.720]  You know, because you build them.
[3:36:14.720 --> 3:36:16.400]  Well, no, I don't build them.
[3:36:16.400 --> 3:36:17.240]  But you know about it.
[3:36:17.240 --> 3:36:20.320]  I know the contractors, because I deal in that.
[3:36:20.320 --> 3:36:22.800]  We design security residents and retreats.
[3:36:22.800 --> 3:36:24.040]  And they build them, yeah.
[3:36:24.040 --> 3:36:27.280]  But we won't work for the globalists.
[3:36:27.280 --> 3:36:30.040]  But the problem is that Denver, Colorado,
[3:36:30.040 --> 3:36:32.560]  under the Denver Airport, that airport that went over
[3:36:32.560 --> 3:36:34.640]  some billion dollars extra in cost
[3:36:34.640 --> 3:36:38.080]  is because there's a whole underground, subterranean,
[3:36:38.080 --> 3:36:42.680]  safe area under the Denver Airport for the elite.
[3:36:42.680 --> 3:36:44.560]  This is going to be the second continuity
[3:36:44.560 --> 3:36:47.400]  of government location after Washington, D.C. is.
[3:36:47.400 --> 3:36:48.640]  That's the alternate government.
[3:36:48.640 --> 3:36:51.040]  That's the alternate government location.
[3:36:51.040 --> 3:36:53.400]  And so you have secret facilities there.
[3:36:53.400 --> 3:36:56.440]  I hear shots of what they have, all this weird Anubis
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:36:58.400]  and all this Egyptian.
[3:36:58.400 --> 3:36:59.680]  People don't realize how big that is.
[3:36:59.680 --> 3:37:02.400]  We're talking 100 foot, 200 foot statues.
[3:37:02.400 --> 3:37:05.040]  Yeah, and there's artwork in the, there's very weird.
[3:37:05.040 --> 3:37:07.040]  Mass murder and gargoyles.
[3:37:07.040 --> 3:37:10.120]  Yeah, there's Masonic symbols in the Denver Airport.
[3:37:10.120 --> 3:37:12.760]  It's very, very clear that this is a new age,
[3:37:12.760 --> 3:37:15.600]  new world order type facility.
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:20.240]  But because it is the second alternative head of government
[3:37:20.240 --> 3:37:23.080]  for the new world order, for the deep state, the globalists,
[3:37:23.080 --> 3:37:26.200]  a lot of the people in the know have developed retreats
[3:37:26.200 --> 3:37:27.360]  because they know the war is coming.
[3:37:27.360 --> 3:37:28.800]  They're not warning the American people.
[3:37:28.800 --> 3:37:30.200]  They know it's coming.
[3:37:30.200 --> 3:37:31.200]  The U.S. is building a lot of.
[3:37:31.200 --> 3:37:33.080]  Anywhere near Colorado Springs, that's a major target.
[3:37:33.080 --> 3:37:34.480]  They're up in the mountains to the west.
[3:37:34.480 --> 3:37:39.040]  Colorado Springs, of course, is where your NATO command,
[3:37:39.040 --> 3:37:43.240]  not NATO, but the NORAD and SAC command headquarters
[3:37:43.240 --> 3:37:44.640]  are in the bunker system in Cheyenne.
[3:37:44.640 --> 3:37:47.320]  They basically emptied out Cheyenne Mountain
[3:37:47.320 --> 3:37:50.640]  for a couple of years until they completely redid it
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:51.960]  with EMP protection.
[3:37:51.960 --> 3:37:53.360]  That was what they were doing in Cheyenne.
[3:37:53.360 --> 3:37:55.920]  And they put NORAD out there in Colorado,
[3:37:55.920 --> 3:37:58.000]  in Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs,
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:01.080]  making the city itself a primary target during that period.
[3:38:01.080 --> 3:38:01.920]  That's crazy.
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:04.040]  And now they've moved back into Cheyenne Mountain.
[3:38:04.040 --> 3:38:07.200]  It's still operational.
[3:38:07.200 --> 3:38:10.160]  So Colorado used to be a four-star rated state
[3:38:10.160 --> 3:38:13.000]  because of its immense, you know, it was Republican controlled
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:14.760]  and had a lot of beautiful retreat areas.
[3:38:14.760 --> 3:38:18.200]  My favorite place in Colorado is the Montrose area
[3:38:18.200 --> 3:38:19.760]  in western Colorado.
[3:38:19.760 --> 3:38:22.480]  But now that Colorado's been downgraded to a two-star state
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:23.920]  because it's under democratic control,
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:25.840]  you're losing all your freedoms in Colorado.
[3:38:25.840 --> 3:38:29.320]  It's only a matter of time before it becomes like California,
[3:38:29.320 --> 3:38:31.360]  Oregon, and Washington.
[3:38:31.360 --> 3:38:33.160]  I'm no longer recommending that.
[3:38:33.160 --> 3:38:34.960]  But still, for people in Colorado,
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:37.880]  the Montrose area is a beautiful, farming valley,
[3:38:37.880 --> 3:38:39.800]  lots of irrigation water, and surrounded
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:43.680]  by gorgeous mountains here to the south.
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:45.360]  It's a big old slice of heaven.
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:46.880]  Yeah.
[3:38:46.880 --> 3:38:51.320]  But it's a very interesting...
[3:38:51.320 --> 3:38:52.960]  So the smart globalist are moving there
[3:38:52.960 --> 3:38:54.080]  because you talked to the contractors.
[3:38:54.080 --> 3:38:55.280]  They know you've talked about that for a long time.
[3:38:55.280 --> 3:38:56.280]  And the ones that aren't in the know
[3:38:56.280 --> 3:38:58.160]  are going to Australia and New Zealand.
[3:38:58.160 --> 3:39:00.080]  And that's not a good move because those places
[3:39:00.080 --> 3:39:00.720]  are going to be occupied.
[3:39:00.720 --> 3:39:01.680]  What about Kauai?
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:03.280]  I mean, obviously, it's an island.
[3:39:03.280 --> 3:39:05.360]  And that's where Zuckerberg and Olympus have gone.
[3:39:05.360 --> 3:39:08.960]  Well, let's look at Hawaii because I've lived in Hawaii.
[3:39:08.960 --> 3:39:11.200]  When I was in the military, I lived there for three years.
[3:39:11.200 --> 3:39:13.440]  I have a lot of experience in Hawaii.
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:16.400]  Look at the number of nuclear targets in Oahu,
[3:39:16.400 --> 3:39:18.160]  just full of nuclear targets.
[3:39:18.160 --> 3:39:21.280]  The problem, even in good times with Oahu,
[3:39:21.280 --> 3:39:22.760]  is though that everything is shipped
[3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:25.320]  and including diesel fuel to run all the generators
[3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:26.720]  for electricity.
[3:39:26.720 --> 3:39:29.720]  That's going to run out, of course, during a war time.
[3:39:29.720 --> 3:39:33.160]  And there's military bases out here.
[3:39:33.160 --> 3:39:36.560]  There's military bases around the state.
[3:39:36.560 --> 3:39:39.080]  If anything, the only thing that has any potential
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:40.880]  all of retreating really is the big island,
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:43.120]  which is big enough that you can get lost out there
[3:39:43.120 --> 3:39:44.080]  and people can't find it.
[3:39:44.080 --> 3:39:46.000]  It's a lot of farmland, a lot of beef for this.
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:46.320]  Right.
[3:39:46.320 --> 3:39:49.240]  But there's two active volcanoes there.
[3:39:49.240 --> 3:39:50.200]  I've been there.
[3:39:50.200 --> 3:39:52.520]  The helicopter pilot went in it because he was illustrating.
[3:39:52.520 --> 3:39:53.320]  So we're not supposed to do that.
[3:39:53.320 --> 3:39:54.000]  He went in it.
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:56.640]  There was lava like 100 feet below at a movie.
[3:39:56.640 --> 3:39:59.680]  He took me in there because he goes, usually the vent's
[3:39:59.680 --> 3:40:01.280]  coming out, so you can't get in it.
[3:40:01.280 --> 3:40:03.560]  But that day, it was venting, but out the side.
[3:40:03.560 --> 3:40:05.280]  And so we were able to go into it.
[3:40:05.280 --> 3:40:06.400]  Pretty amazing.
[3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:09.120]  Well, the important thing to remember about Honolulu,
[3:40:09.120 --> 3:40:10.840]  if there's any place in the United States
[3:40:10.840 --> 3:40:13.560]  that's going to get occupied or taken over by the Chinese
[3:40:13.560 --> 3:40:14.960]  during the war, it's Hawaii.
[3:40:14.960 --> 3:40:16.800]  It's sticking out there, Guam, et cetera.
[3:40:16.800 --> 3:40:19.680]  So Hawaii is definitely a zero-rated star,
[3:40:19.680 --> 3:40:21.400]  not only because it's democratic-controlled,
[3:40:21.400 --> 3:40:23.040]  but because it is not self-sustaining.
[3:40:23.040 --> 3:40:25.840]  So why do you think so many globalists are moving to Kauai?
[3:40:25.840 --> 3:40:27.280]  Well, as I say, they don't know.
[3:40:27.280 --> 3:40:28.640]  They're not in the know.
[3:40:28.640 --> 3:40:30.320]  I think Zuckerberg is in the know.
[3:40:30.320 --> 3:40:32.760]  He's got a private jumbo jet sitting here.
[3:40:32.760 --> 3:40:34.400]  Yeah, I don't think Zuckerberg.
[3:40:34.400 --> 3:40:35.760]  He's a lightweight.
[3:40:35.760 --> 3:40:37.000]  He's a frontman like Gage.
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  These are lightweights.
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:40.880]  These are people that are useful idiots,
[3:40:40.880 --> 3:40:42.040]  but they are not in the know.
[3:40:42.040 --> 3:40:43.280]  You can tell a dark side.
[3:40:43.280 --> 3:40:44.520]  Like Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[3:40:44.520 --> 3:40:46.520]  Now, there's a dark side operator that
[3:40:46.520 --> 3:40:48.120]  had a dark countenance.
[3:40:48.120 --> 3:40:50.680]  You could tell it when you speak to him.
[3:40:50.680 --> 3:40:53.640]  His daughter, of course, is, you know, on national media,
[3:40:53.640 --> 3:40:54.080]  Mika.
[3:40:54.080 --> 3:40:55.960]  Harry, do another murderer.
[3:40:55.960 --> 3:40:58.920]  But George Soros is very, very high up.
[3:40:58.920 --> 3:41:00.880]  Henry Kissinger is extremely high up.
[3:41:00.880 --> 3:41:02.440]  The Rothschilds are very high up.
[3:41:02.440 --> 3:41:05.560]  But there's a lot of useful idiots at the lower level,
[3:41:05.560 --> 3:41:08.400]  like Bill Gates, who are yes men to the establishment,
[3:41:08.400 --> 3:41:12.120]  do what they're told, but are too naive to know
[3:41:12.120 --> 3:41:13.320]  what the ultimate agenda.
[3:41:13.320 --> 3:41:15.600]  They don't know about the war that they're
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:16.960]  planning on bringing on people.
[3:41:16.960 --> 3:41:19.160]  But we're decompartmentalizing them.
[3:41:19.160 --> 3:41:21.240]  What is the effect of this show, your work,
[3:41:21.240 --> 3:41:23.440]  and all the people that do get it?
[3:41:23.440 --> 3:41:25.760]  I mean, I think that's why they said in Congress today
[3:41:25.760 --> 3:41:28.120]  with Bill Barr, you get the stuff from Alex Jones.
[3:41:28.120 --> 3:41:30.080]  You know, you're crazy.
[3:41:30.080 --> 3:41:34.560]  This challenges them because we're decompartmentalizing.
[3:41:34.560 --> 3:41:36.480]  Well, it does, but they're extremely arrogant.
[3:41:36.480 --> 3:41:38.640]  They know that they've got more power
[3:41:38.640 --> 3:41:41.080]  than anyone ever imagines the deep state.
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:43.760]  I mean, that's what makes the queue a non-phenomenal
[3:41:43.760 --> 3:41:45.760]  so much of a joke, you know, to claim
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:49.880]  that Donald Trump is going to meet with Robert Mueller
[3:41:49.880 --> 3:41:52.400]  and take down the deep state when Robert Mueller is deep state.
[3:41:52.400 --> 3:41:53.960]  I mean, you know they're playing with us.
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:41:57.680]  They know they are just fooling the Trump supporters
[3:41:57.680 --> 3:41:59.960]  into believing he's going to round everybody up and stuff.
[3:41:59.960 --> 3:42:00.640]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:42:00.640 --> 3:42:02.600]  But then so many well-mitting people get into it,
[3:42:02.600 --> 3:42:04.360]  and then they start spreading the word about other things.
[3:42:04.360 --> 3:42:06.800]  I hate to be mean to them because it hurts their feelings.
[3:42:06.800 --> 3:42:09.520]  Like, they'll tell me, queue expose the pedophiles you never
[3:42:09.520 --> 3:42:11.560]  did, or queue expose the Federal Reserve.
[3:42:11.560 --> 3:42:14.560]  And I'm just like, yeah, I've been doing it for 26 years.
[3:42:14.560 --> 3:42:16.560]  Your uncle was the first guy to expose it.
[3:42:16.560 --> 3:42:19.360]  60, 70 years ago, you've been fighting it for 40 years.
[3:42:19.360 --> 3:42:21.440]  And they just treat us like we're, I'm not trying to brag.
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:22.760]  I'm up here as smart or something.
[3:42:22.760 --> 3:42:26.400]  But I mean, literally, our names are Alex Jones and Joe Scousen.
[3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:28.240]  Ron Paul's name is Ron Paul.
[3:42:28.240 --> 3:42:30.960]  You know, Cleon Scousen, Cleon Scousen.
[3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:32.160]  Barry Goldwater is Barry Goldwater.
[3:42:32.160 --> 3:42:33.400]  I mean, we're real people.
[3:42:33.400 --> 3:42:35.520]  I mean, we've got a track writer.
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:36.520]  We know what we're talking about.
[3:42:36.520 --> 3:42:38.560]  And we talk straight, Alex.
[3:42:38.560 --> 3:42:40.720]  Q talks in riddles.
[3:42:40.720 --> 3:42:43.040]  He talks in riddles.
[3:42:43.040 --> 3:42:44.600]  He never says anything straight.
[3:42:44.600 --> 3:42:45.680]  He's always hidden.
[3:42:45.680 --> 3:42:47.720]  No conservative, no true conservative
[3:42:47.720 --> 3:42:49.040]  can stand to talk like that.
[3:42:49.040 --> 3:42:50.440]  You have to tell the truth.
[3:42:50.440 --> 3:42:51.440]  And that's one of the...
[3:42:51.440 --> 3:42:53.440]  All we try to do is to be as straightforward as possible.
[3:42:53.440 --> 3:42:54.440]  That's right.
[3:42:54.440 --> 3:42:56.160]  And, you know, you can be careful.
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:42:57.160]  You can be on it.
[3:42:57.160 --> 3:42:58.160]  But this is not being careful.
[3:42:58.160 --> 3:43:01.480]  Anybody who claims to be an insider is not.
[3:43:01.480 --> 3:43:04.360]  Because the NSA has the capability to ferret out anyone.
[3:43:04.360 --> 3:43:07.120]  Anyone who emails me and says, I'm an insider in the NSA
[3:43:07.120 --> 3:43:10.120]  and I want to pass you some information, I don't respond.
[3:43:10.120 --> 3:43:11.120]  Because there's no way...
[3:43:11.120 --> 3:43:12.120]  It's obviously not true.
[3:43:12.120 --> 3:43:13.560]  You could no way you could be...
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:17.040]  Well, at the level of this, there's not even code words or groups.
[3:43:17.040 --> 3:43:18.400]  It's a society.
[3:43:18.400 --> 3:43:20.120]  It's spiritual.
[3:43:20.120 --> 3:43:24.640]  It's all electromagnetic, you know, the top 10 families or so.
[3:43:24.640 --> 3:43:27.920]  It's all running off the satanic impulse.
[3:43:27.920 --> 3:43:29.360]  It's a spirit running it.
[3:43:29.360 --> 3:43:30.360]  It's...
[3:43:30.360 --> 3:43:33.120]  And just like those opposing it, there's a spirit running us.
[3:43:33.120 --> 3:43:34.120]  I mean, that's what it is.
[3:43:34.120 --> 3:43:35.120]  That's right.
[3:43:35.120 --> 3:43:38.520]  And they're listening to a spirit which hooks them in by the promise of immunity.
[3:43:38.520 --> 3:43:39.520]  That's very important.
[3:43:39.520 --> 3:43:41.400]  That's the Faustian pack.
[3:43:41.400 --> 3:43:43.360]  Not only will it make you famous.
[3:43:43.360 --> 3:43:47.240]  In fact, there's a very interesting video I talked about in the World Affairs Brief.
[3:43:47.240 --> 3:43:52.800]  One in Hollywood, a stuntman who came out and talked about the satanic cults going on
[3:43:52.800 --> 3:43:53.800]  in whole Hollywood.
[3:43:53.800 --> 3:43:59.080]  And they're not allowed to actually get to a certain level of fame until...
[3:43:59.080 --> 3:44:03.680]  And they just stop them until they join this cult, which involves pedophilia.
[3:44:03.680 --> 3:44:07.360]  And that's because they want you to do something bad to cut God off from you, so you're totally
[3:44:07.360 --> 3:44:08.360]  turned over in a slave.
[3:44:08.360 --> 3:44:09.360]  Yeah.
[3:44:09.360 --> 3:44:13.000]  I mean, Mark Dice, he was going to get a national show with a big guy and they called him in
[3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:15.160]  and said, we want you to go ahead and budge yourself and say...
[3:44:15.160 --> 3:44:17.520]  And I had told him about that and he thought I was crazy until it happened to him.
[3:44:17.520 --> 3:44:18.520]  They did that to me.
[3:44:18.520 --> 3:44:22.600]  I mean, it really comes down to, hey, we want you to do something and, hey, you think you
[3:44:22.600 --> 3:44:25.640]  should be at this party because there might be some 15-year-old girls over here later.
[3:44:25.640 --> 3:44:26.640]  You end up...
[3:44:26.640 --> 3:44:27.640]  And it's like, yeah, I'm leaving.
[3:44:27.640 --> 3:44:28.640]  Yeah, we didn't think you were in the club.
[3:44:28.640 --> 3:44:33.360]  I mean, I've actually been there, had that happened, and this is real, folks.
[3:44:33.360 --> 3:44:34.360]  Same thing in the CIA.
[3:44:34.360 --> 3:44:39.040]  When they take the CIA young agents and they want to grill, who's going to be going into
[3:44:39.040 --> 3:44:40.040]  the dark side?
[3:44:40.040 --> 3:44:41.120]  They take them over to Europe on a trip.
[3:44:41.120 --> 3:44:43.840]  They have prostitutes come to the door at night, offer their services.
[3:44:43.840 --> 3:44:47.800]  The ones that accept get advanced and the ones that don't accept don't.
[3:44:47.800 --> 3:44:50.000]  And, okay, it's a 20-year-old hooker one night.
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:53.120]  Next, it's, oh, that girl, you had sex with her, she's 14.
[3:44:53.120 --> 3:44:55.120]  And now they got you.
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:44:56.120]  And next they go, you know what?
[3:44:56.120 --> 3:44:57.120]  We want you to have sex with an eight-year-old.
[3:44:57.120 --> 3:44:58.120]  Hey, you know what?
[3:44:58.120 --> 3:44:59.120]  We got a 12-year-old causing a problem.
[3:44:59.120 --> 3:45:01.280]  I want you to go slit her throat.
[3:45:01.280 --> 3:45:02.280]  Now you're killing a kid.
[3:45:02.280 --> 3:45:03.800]  You want to be part of that, folks?
[3:45:03.800 --> 3:45:04.800]  I don't think you do.
[3:45:04.800 --> 3:45:05.800]  And believe me, it's real.
[3:45:05.800 --> 3:45:06.800]  It's real.
[3:45:06.800 --> 3:45:08.520]  Those cows are powerful, my friend.
[3:45:08.520 --> 3:45:09.520]  Thank you.
[3:45:09.520 --> 3:45:10.520]  Good to have you here.
[3:45:10.520 --> 3:45:11.520]  This is the real world.
[3:45:11.520 --> 3:45:12.520]  What are you going to be talking about in the war room?
[3:45:12.520 --> 3:45:16.360]  Well, we're going to talk about the COVID in detail and the scientific evidence that
[3:45:16.360 --> 3:45:21.680]  it's false, as well as the election coming up and what Joe Biden is going to do.
[3:45:21.680 --> 3:45:23.160]  All right, it starts now.
[3:45:23.160 --> 3:45:44.680]  We're going to talk about the COVID in detail and the scientific evidence that it's false.
