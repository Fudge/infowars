[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:36.160]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well the doctor-in-chief
[00:36.160 --> 00:43.280]  Barack Obama our gracious leader from which all good things flow says he's still not going to
[00:43.280 --> 00:51.680]  compromise on anything like taxes on heart devices or taxes on the payroll of people
[00:52.240 --> 00:58.080]  making less than thirty thousand dollars a year he's not going to compromise on anything with
[00:58.080 --> 01:04.880]  House Republicans and the media the kleptocrat media the establishment media plays along with it
[01:04.880 --> 01:09.520]  saying that it is the Republicans that have shut down the government even though they've given what
[01:09.520 --> 01:16.720]  four different versions since last week to the Senate that they have voted down promptly so
[01:17.520 --> 01:24.400]  they are here trying to teach you that you need them as we speak by the way we're going to be
[01:24.400 --> 01:30.240]  covering the latest on the shutdown and more the memorial shutdown even in France they've shut down
[01:30.240 --> 01:36.720]  just open air cemeteries on the coastline from the Normandy d-day invasion but they have plenty
[01:36.720 --> 01:42.240]  of guards there to make sure that none of the veterans that had traveled there or others could
[01:42.240 --> 01:49.600]  get in but don't worry all the elite officer golf courses they're all staying open and all the red
[01:49.600 --> 01:56.640]  carpets and all the caviar in fact now they've gone to mount Vernon and a bunch of other places
[01:56.640 --> 02:02.080]  that are not even federal parks and had the park service block them and announced because it's
[02:02.080 --> 02:06.800]  federal property private parks run by private groups privately funded just like the world war
[02:06.800 --> 02:13.520]  two memorial no one is allowed in and they have police federal police there so there's a lot of
[02:13.520 --> 02:18.800]  overtime going on in places that don't even normally have feds visiting them to make sure
[02:18.800 --> 02:24.880]  you the slaves understand that they're going to control you with that just like they want to
[02:24.880 --> 02:28.640]  control you with health care just like they want to control you with government run education
[02:28.640 --> 02:37.040]  education dependency slavery modern slavery may your change set lightly upon you as Patrick Henry
[02:37.040 --> 02:46.400]  said uh is the name of the game now that whole backdrops going on while our crew Anthony Gucci
[02:46.400 --> 02:51.200]  already uh working with from story leak dot com with info wars dot com Weldon henson from info
[02:51.200 --> 02:58.800]  wars uh and of course some of the camera guys josh and others are are upset to arrive at the nsa
[03:00.000 --> 03:08.160]  in utah outside salt lake city as we speak in fact we have a live stream and alex shone's live on
[03:08.160 --> 03:13.840]  you stream up we have some backup streams and we saw an error on the channel earlier but it's
[03:13.840 --> 03:20.560]  back up now never seen that before a 404 error but they are now uh there with Weldon henson driving
[03:22.960 --> 03:27.200]  so there they are if you're watching us on tv you can see Weldon tell the difference between the
[03:27.200 --> 03:34.080]  two I mean it's like it's one big military base balance man josh who works on film and editing
[03:34.080 --> 03:38.640]  and a production mastermind do you think they're going to try and take that camera equipment that
[03:38.640 --> 03:43.360]  we have over there and confiscate it from you because you're using a first amendment uh we'll
[03:43.360 --> 03:49.360]  see but uh there's a there's a good possibility that they're uh going to be pretty upset that we the
[03:49.360 --> 03:55.840]  slaves come and ask them questions because they can spy on our phones they can you know look at
[03:55.840 --> 04:01.440]  our emails look at you know everything that we do I mean the the facility was surrounded by cameras
[04:01.440 --> 04:07.840]  but if we come up there with two cameras live streaming one camera they're going to be angry
[04:07.840 --> 04:10.720]  yeah we're going to tell them that we're live streaming as well so if they do anything they'll
[04:10.720 --> 04:14.720]  be held accountable for it I mean as soon as we went up there yesterday I mean we had what
[04:14.720 --> 04:18.400]  you hadn't even gotten done yet and there was a you know some common intelligence officer driving
[04:18.400 --> 04:22.800]  by staring at us like we were terrorists so that was interesting by the way let's take that down

[08:48.640 --> 08:54.880]  federally controlled it's privately managed and funded they are putting fences up sending out
[08:54.880 --> 09:03.040]  overtime bureaucrats and and and armed police of the park service and others to try to frustrate
[09:03.040 --> 09:08.560]  and block the american people and of course it came out yesterday that's on direct orders of the
[09:08.560 --> 09:17.360]  anti american anti gun anti family occupier of the web of the white house there is no doubt that the
[09:17.360 --> 09:24.640]  power structure is trying with everything they can to break this country and that we have a power
[09:24.640 --> 09:32.160]  structure at war with the nation with our industry with our power plants with our people with our
[09:32.160 --> 09:38.400]  families we are under sustained military attack our own military itself has been captured by
[09:38.400 --> 09:43.760]  the globalist and is waking up to this fact the nsa center is run by the foreign offshore banks on
[09:43.760 --> 09:49.520]  record they use it to control the markets to rig the markets to shut down their competition uh the
[09:49.520 --> 09:56.880]  nsa base in utah that just opened up it's not been shut down during all of this uh there are articles
[09:56.880 --> 10:04.000]  out at info wars dot com today we're in congress the chief of the dhs uh openly came out and said
[10:04.000 --> 10:12.640]  it is terrorism or terrorist to want privacy so wanting freedom is terrorism supporting freedom
[10:12.640 --> 10:19.040]  is evil because these people have occupied the nation they are moving against us and it's only
[10:19.040 --> 10:24.560]  realizing the total magnitude of this group who believes this country belongs to them
[10:25.280 --> 10:28.880]  and who have seized control of the federal government that we have any chance of ever
[10:28.880 --> 10:35.520]  getting out of this now i sent the crew to utah to the nsa center and they went and drove around
[10:35.520 --> 10:42.320]  it yesterday and shot some high def video for the upcoming film obama deception too they want
[10:42.320 --> 10:49.840]  they're going back today and are there right now and there is no live feed uh taking place uh right
[10:49.840 --> 11:01.840]  now okay so uh we just talked to them over the phone and they're expecting to do a live feed
[11:01.840 --> 11:08.640]  again in five minutes and they are at the nsa center right now okay well i want to get them on
[11:08.640 --> 11:13.680]  the phone right now call them on the studio line put welded on the phone right now that that's how
[11:13.680 --> 11:19.520]  we're going to do this right now uh here on air because i wanted them to continue to do live feeds
[11:19.520 --> 11:27.040]  as they drove towards the nsa center so they are about to arrive there in the next five to ten
[11:27.040 --> 11:34.080]  minutes and then we'll have live feeds here on air of the paramilitary police and the army base
[11:34.080 --> 11:39.520]  that's attached to it and welden was actually in the air force years ago they're in salt lake so he
[11:39.520 --> 11:46.800]  knows the area well welden henson who went with them from the infall wars operation and uh when
[11:46.800 --> 11:52.640]  we've gone to the nsa center in san antonio when we've gone to nsa centers in dc they come out and
[11:52.640 --> 11:57.280]  act like you're bad videotaping them these are people that track everything you do illegally on
[11:57.280 --> 12:03.440]  record these are people that run al qaeda publicly these are people that ship the narcotics in publicly
[12:03.440 --> 12:07.600]  run by foreign banks that launder hundreds of billions a year publicly that's in bloomberg
[12:07.600 --> 12:12.960]  ap writers and they sit there and act like you're evil and you're bad and you've done something
[12:12.960 --> 12:17.440]  wrong it's like when cops come up and say why are you videotaping me i'm going to arrest you
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.200]  when there's no law saying you can't videotape them it is just a government completely rogue
[12:23.200 --> 12:32.560]  completely out of control and so we're going to see what happens once they get there with the live
[12:32.560 --> 12:40.720]  feed uh coming up so we're going to be breaking all of that down today and in nsa news let me
[12:40.720 --> 12:45.760]  direct tv viewers and radio listeners to info wars.com but tv viewers can see this article
[12:45.760 --> 12:50.960]  from washington's blog that links directly through to the congressional public statements
[12:51.520 --> 12:58.800]  chief of dhs privacy officer government called privacy office terrorist that's the chief of
[12:58.800 --> 13:02.960]  the privacy office complaining that happened then they've got quotes from hayden who headed up the
[13:02.960 --> 13:10.800]  nsa saying anyone that wants privacy is a terrorist boom okay this is on record you're a terrorist
[13:11.760 --> 13:17.920]  if you want any privacy but the government the rogue government it wants total privacy
[13:17.920 --> 13:23.600]  and acts like the first amendment is the ultimate sin and the equivalent of child sacrifice here's
[13:23.600 --> 13:31.120]  another one phoenix mayor defense police filming asu tailgaters surveilling them with the anti-terror
[13:31.120 --> 13:36.960]  teams and and we've got mainstream reports where they now call the public insurgents and we're all
[13:36.960 --> 13:43.280]  treated as an enemy and the government is an occupying force because it is a globalist occupied
[13:43.280 --> 13:49.760]  army doesn't matter if you're a patriot and a cop or in the military the people running you the people
[13:49.760 --> 13:55.280]  in control of it are a seized government it'd be like if aliens landed and threatened to vaporize
[13:55.280 --> 13:59.520]  the earth of the military didn't go under their command and the military went under their command
[13:59.520 --> 14:04.960]  it'd be the exact same thing but these are our fellow humans these are globalists that have
[14:04.960 --> 14:10.880]  done this and everyone is bowing down to them let's continue california condemns indefinite
[14:10.880 --> 14:16.560]  detention passes a law saying they will not secretly arrest and disappear citizens so
[14:17.840 --> 14:23.760]  due to pressure california has done the right thing and i thought nullification doesn't count
[14:23.760 --> 14:31.680]  when the states stand up for the bill of rights nullification does nullification does continuing
[14:33.200 --> 14:40.000]  with the nsa news chairman of the senate judiciary committee says we've got more info on nsa spying
[14:40.000 --> 14:50.240]  in the newspapers than from classified briefings and he said that to what the associated press
[14:50.240 --> 14:56.240]  and it's gotten almost no attention that the nsa will not tell congress what's going on
[14:56.240 --> 15:01.840]  see that's a rogue government a rogue bureaucracy obama says he doesn't have to go to congress
[15:03.600 --> 15:11.120]  for any approval for military strikes so that is just some of the news on that front we're
[15:11.120 --> 15:17.040]  going to get updates from the nsa report live here in just a moment via phone as they prepare
[15:17.040 --> 15:22.560]  to arrive and they start up the live feed which by the way no goose yard he's on hold he can
[15:22.560 --> 15:27.440]  think sort of the live feed anytime they want uh continuing though after we get into the nsa
[15:28.880 --> 15:35.040]  monuments and memorials remained open during previous shutdowns reports the daily caller
[15:35.040 --> 15:40.880]  and links to the associated press from 1996 during the last government shutdown none of
[15:40.880 --> 15:46.640]  them were shut down because they're open parks more government expenditures are being spent
[15:46.640 --> 15:52.160]  to block the slaves from access because the truth is almost the entire filthy evil government
[15:52.160 --> 15:56.560]  is still operating like a woodchipper destroying our freedom they just want to give us the idea
[15:56.560 --> 16:04.560]  that it's all shut down nbc reports founding fathers tavern closed by government shutdown
[16:05.520 --> 16:11.520]  troops forage for food while golfers play in the shutdown they're keeping the government golf courses
[16:11.520 --> 16:18.160]  open but shutting down the areas where the army can eat to pull a stunt oh who needs the average
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.440]  enlisted to be able to eat as long as the officers can play golf and visit their uh their mistresses
[16:23.440 --> 16:28.160]  okay we've got anthony gucciardi with us on the phone and we'll run the live feed
[16:28.960 --> 16:34.000]  video only in the background while that happens uh anthony uh i guess it's a little bit further
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.240]  out to the nsa base than you guys had remembered being there yesterday you're going to go to the
[16:38.240 --> 16:44.000]  front gate and talk to them how far away are you anthony gucciardi exactly we're about five minutes
[16:44.000 --> 16:49.760]  away we're on live stream right now at the moment as well and yes we went yesterday there is a
[16:49.760 --> 16:55.360]  military compound camp williams but it's hooked up to the nsa data center the eye of sauron of the
[16:55.360 --> 17:00.720]  united states in new world order and there is a military outpost in the front and there's a gate
[17:00.720 --> 17:05.360]  and it looks like there's armed guards and everything like that and we also notice indications
[17:05.360 --> 17:10.640]  of underground bunkers and a number of crazy things and we went up we didn't even go try to go in
[17:10.640 --> 17:13.920]  we were just scoping it out yesterday to see how far it would get now it's snowing so it's
[17:13.920 --> 17:20.080]  taking all longer and uh sweat up now but so we went around and we were met with unmarked
[17:20.080 --> 17:25.440]  federal slash police cars circling us we got it on camera and in an attempt to threaten us and
[17:25.440 --> 17:32.800]  intimidate us to not even dare to stop the vehicle within 100 yards of the nsa spy center
[17:32.800 --> 17:39.600]  well they'll also have signs saying photography prohibited you're not on the base there is no
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.640]  law you can look at it with google maps they're all spying on us illegally telling us our first
[17:44.640 --> 17:49.200]  amendment is illegal so when they say don't you see the signs say don't you see the first amendment
[17:49.200 --> 17:54.640]  when they ask you for your id you demand theirs first we've done this before and you can also
[17:54.640 --> 17:59.600]  tell them you know federal courts have ruled we can stand outside and videotape this they used
[17:59.600 --> 18:04.320]  to arrest people until a couple years ago when they lost in federal court and uh you guys are
[18:04.320 --> 18:09.600]  doing a great job to defend our first amendment what they're doing is illegal it's not to protect
[18:09.600 --> 18:16.000]  america it is a foreign command base to spy on america that's why it's hooked on to an army base
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.280]  this is a command base to run the technocracy during the shutdown of america it might as well
[18:21.280 --> 18:30.240]  be an alien mothership landed in utah to run operations against us no exactly and furthermore
[18:30.240 --> 18:34.640]  they even have a back entrance and when we went around there with same thing these unmarked cars
[18:34.640 --> 18:39.440]  would come around it's instantaneous i mean this is you know heavily armed facility i think i've
[18:39.440 --> 18:45.520]  ever seen with in terms of they are calling in real time the military police or whatever they are
[18:45.520 --> 18:49.760]  the federal government i have no idea and even when we're not even stopping and doing anything
[18:49.760 --> 18:53.120]  i mean we're literally stopping the car just looking at it they're like better send someone out
[18:53.120 --> 18:57.600]  there right now we have to understand you are designated this is kind of out in congress
[18:57.600 --> 19:02.000]  as a terrorist all americans are terrorists because this is the foreign army of the new
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.880]  world order this is the red coats this is the captured federal government spending hundreds
[19:06.880 --> 19:11.440]  of billions of dollars with giant nsa command centers already built all over the country
[19:11.440 --> 19:17.200]  building huge ones in san Antonio dallas there's one by my house in my neighborhood a substation

[25:14.080 --> 25:18.720]  live feed you can see the military outpost the tower the data center itself which is massive
[25:18.720 --> 25:23.760]  and this entire time the last three four minutes we've been talking we've been driving along the
[25:23.760 --> 25:28.800]  outskirts of this massive eye of star on this is a danger thing right now if you're watching
[25:28.800 --> 25:34.080]  the live at info wars dot com this live stream we're going to approach the nsa and talk about the
[25:34.080 --> 25:37.680]  fact that they are completely spying on us but we can't actually document them through the first
[25:37.680 --> 25:41.600]  amendment we're pulling in right now to the back entrance we're going to swoop around and go into
[25:41.600 --> 25:46.560]  the military side of it but this entire compound because right now employees and authorized visitors
[25:46.560 --> 25:52.080]  deliveries only we're going to get unmarked police cars federal agents coming very very soon
[25:52.080 --> 25:56.800]  absolutely and they're putting signs up even outside the base under color of law fraud to
[25:56.800 --> 26:02.320]  act like you're bad if you even approach uh your your taxpayer paid for grid i'm going to get off

[26:17.120 --> 26:21.440]  let's know thanks right thank you everybody's praying for you this is such a free country
[26:21.440 --> 26:27.600]  now we need more people remember 15 years ago they said this didn't even exist the nsa echelon
[26:27.600 --> 26:32.240]  the media would actually say it didn't exist the controlled media now they're forced to admit
[26:32.240 --> 26:36.640]  they're doing it and now we're having an open debate so let's go to the live feed it'll be
[26:36.640 --> 26:41.760]  about 30 seconds delayed let's go to that right now all right here we go this is the official live
[26:41.760 --> 26:46.160]  feed we are now entering nsa back we're going to go into the military establishment but we couldn't
[26:46.160 --> 26:53.520]  resist there's so many signs here saying do not go in here essentially you'll be arrested no filming
[26:53.520 --> 27:00.080]  whatsoever this is complete surveillance state on us all these cameras yet we're not allowed to
[27:00.080 --> 27:04.000]  even film with an ifa which is what we're using right that's because they're committing crime
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.680]  so here's inside they said we couldn't get in the parking lot everyone told me
[27:07.680 --> 27:12.480]  there's no way you're gonna get in the parking lot you will be arrested before you even set foot
[27:12.480 --> 27:18.000]  in the parking lot here we are the nsa data center parking lot we're all these loving government
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  officials are these guys are as bad as the world war two that's what you said you're going into
[27:22.000 --> 27:28.160]  memorial and you can even look up there were nsa agents agents very official agents recently
[27:28.160 --> 27:32.080]  that were fired because they were stooping on their girlfriends and listening to their phone
[27:32.080 --> 27:39.760]  section but here we are see a good spot right up there we'll go grab it all right well i wonder
[27:39.760 --> 27:45.520]  what that building is over there and well did you get another camera film too see a spot over there
[27:47.680 --> 27:55.920]  yeah so here we are we're trying to figure out what what's even going on their directive is to go
[27:55.920 --> 28:01.360]  find the pao's entering the key of the pio public information officer so i guess we're just gonna
[28:01.360 --> 28:05.520]  go ahead and park our public affairs and get out look at this view at both names look at this the
[28:05.520 --> 28:13.360]  beauty of this area and the nsa is just destroying and corrupting it as a cancerous tumor on the
[28:14.720 --> 28:19.600]  beauty that is utah and the united states and again this isn't even supposed to exist so many good
[28:19.600 --> 28:25.920]  people here that don't understand what's going on i mean there's people that are actually somewhat
[28:25.920 --> 28:30.240]  patriotic in many ways but they think that the government's buying is a good thing they just
[28:30.240 --> 28:34.400]  don't understand at all so that's when i when i told people that we're going here they they
[28:34.400 --> 28:39.120]  their brain almost blew up like you're going to the nsa here you'll get arrested for just looking
[28:39.120 --> 28:43.920]  at it they couldn't even understand that's right that's how intimidated america's gotten start filming
[28:43.920 --> 28:51.840]  with the full setup and most likely call some problems here the spots are reserved for low
[28:51.840 --> 28:59.840]  emission vehicles only how the mission is spying on the american people illegally how dare journalists
[28:59.840 --> 29:10.480]  go to the nsa nobody's supposed to do this they're god they're above the law this is a hard break
[29:10.480 --> 29:14.880]  we got to go to break on radio but the live feed just went up on info wars dot com and prison

[38:06.640 --> 38:12.400]  and by the way the paperwork when we went to cover pitchburg we had it all in video politely
[38:12.400 --> 38:17.360]  at the army base at the national guard center where they had regular army they lied and said we
[38:17.360 --> 38:22.640]  threatened to kill them and had the police threatened to arrest my guys and go to their hotel
[38:22.640 --> 38:27.520]  they just finally cut the feed was that it they finally cut the feed and and we had total footage
[38:27.520 --> 38:32.160]  when they pulled up the military base said we called earlier we like to talk to your pio or pao
[38:32.720 --> 38:38.080]  and they come over they say who are you we're info wars they see the camera we leave the police come
[38:38.080 --> 38:41.920]  and then the police call me and say we're going to arrest your reporters in fact i called the cops
[38:41.920 --> 38:46.240]  back and famously aired that live on the radio people remember and i said we have it all on
[38:46.240 --> 38:51.360]  footage cops we didn't threaten to blow up the base it was blow up the base and the cop went oh
[38:51.360 --> 38:57.600]  you've got it all taped and i said yeah before you frame us for trying to bomb the national guard
[38:57.600 --> 39:04.240]  armory and and and see to them in the case of pitchburg framing americans was no big deal
[39:05.120 --> 39:10.640]  just like when i covered in brooksville florida with mike hanson an urban warfare drill we have
[39:10.640 --> 39:15.600]  footage of locals saying we've been told don't talk to alex jones you're crazy and then they had a
[39:15.600 --> 39:20.720]  special forces guy starts jump out of the woods when i was trying to film the maneuvers and start
[39:20.720 --> 39:27.440]  setting fires going shouldn't have set fires alex and i had to put the fire out and basically tackle
[39:27.440 --> 39:32.800]  the guy to stop him from setting fires and blaming it on us and i told the guys before they went
[39:32.800 --> 39:39.680]  this is no joke this is no game you are lower than an iraqi to them okay you are lower than a than
[39:39.680 --> 39:44.880]  a serve to them you are the ultimate enemy you're a red-blooded american that doesn't want to be a
[39:44.880 --> 39:50.400]  slave and i want to be clear these average cops out there just totally do right and and and and
[39:50.400 --> 39:55.120]  think they have the moral authority and they're probably not bad people but that's what we thought
[39:55.120 --> 40:01.360]  at the military base in pitchburg then they arrested rob do took them to a torture center
[40:01.360 --> 40:05.280]  where they set everybody out in the rain all night and i'm not going to get into everything else they
[40:05.280 --> 40:10.720]  did to other people because it's pretty humiliating but it's it's bad they had the us army with a
[40:10.720 --> 40:18.480]  national guard and the police and we sued them and we won so you're all on notice and i know the nsa
[40:18.480 --> 40:23.680]  can plant stuff on my computer i know you guys can come kill me go ahead i don't want to die but i'm
[40:23.680 --> 40:29.200]  not scared i'm committed i know i'm right i'm committed like john paul jones when they said
[40:29.200 --> 40:32.960]  are you ready to surrender when the ship was sinking and he said i've only begun to fight
[40:32.960 --> 40:38.560]  and ended up taking them down we have only begun to fight we're never giving up we're never backing
[40:38.560 --> 40:43.840]  down we're never stopping we know what's going on we understand the globalist occupation we're
[40:43.840 --> 40:48.160]  aware of what's happening and i've been wound up today folks it's because
[40:50.240 --> 40:55.040]  good she already had the idea i am absolutely stuck here i've been to the nsa before in dc
[40:55.040 --> 41:00.960]  and jacari and others went down earlier this year to san antonio uh and the same thing basically
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.320]  happened that just happened now and good shard has said we ought to go to we ought to go to uh the
[41:06.320 --> 41:10.080]  nsa center and and point out that they're not being shut down during government shutdown
[41:11.280 --> 41:14.800]  and i said okay i go you want to go to san antonio he goes no let's go to the really big one in
[41:14.800 --> 41:21.520]  utah so i said who wants to go around the office and uh welden henson who's air force veteran
[41:21.520 --> 41:26.320]  in loves utah was stationed up there for many years he said i want to go the head of my shipping
[41:26.320 --> 41:31.200]  department and product procurement department with temper jay uh this does a great job great
[41:31.200 --> 41:36.000]  patriot with a friend of mine he wanted to go and he's never been reporting for us he wanted to go
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.560]  do it because i guess it was what you'd see is a dangerous mission for freedom see there's a spirit
[41:40.560 --> 41:44.480]  of of of defeating the tyranny that everybody wants to be involved in it and that's the spirit
[41:44.480 --> 41:49.440]  that's going to defeat the tyranny folks and then josh wanted to go so they're there and i told him i
[41:49.440 --> 41:53.360]  said listen they're going to take your cameras and then they're going to try to intimidate you and
[41:53.360 --> 41:59.680]  threaten you once they're turned off you've got to say good set me up lie be evil you are going to
[41:59.680 --> 42:03.440]  end up going to jail when we take this country back and then they'll release you because i've been to
[42:03.440 --> 42:08.720]  this before it's like a spirit if they think you're scared and they think that that you're groveling
[42:08.720 --> 42:13.680]  if you just go fine set me up do whatever you're going to do it's on you god's gonna god's going
[42:13.680 --> 42:19.360]  to deal with you they literally in every case start shaking because you're not afraid i had this
[42:19.360 --> 42:24.080]  happen with delta force down in san Antonio they did take our footage in that case and mike hanson
[42:24.080 --> 42:28.400]  would not give him the camera this is right outside the military base fort sam houston
[42:28.400 --> 42:32.800]  his delta force ordered him over there as we were covering the drill and pulled out his barretta
[42:32.800 --> 42:36.480]  and stuck it right to my hands and chest and said i'm going to tell you one more time to give me
[42:36.480 --> 42:41.280]  that camera and mike by the way didn't give it to him and then he said holstered the gun and grabbed
[42:41.280 --> 42:45.920]  it away from me i got to be honest with you i was ready to give him the camera before he pulled the
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.800]  gun out because you know we're going to win this thing that's the thing about mike i never told
[42:50.800 --> 42:54.800]  the story he didn't want it told we were another case where people pulled guns on us and mike
[42:54.800 --> 42:59.840]  literally blew up and told him to go ahead and shooting oh yeah that was that was quite a case
[42:59.840 --> 43:04.400]  one other time with some hillbilly folks who were trying to help out and then the feds went and told
[43:04.400 --> 43:07.840]  them we were feds the next time we showed up and they were telling us we were feds and mike blew
[43:07.840 --> 43:12.160]  up at them and they had guns they started pointing them and mike's like go ahead i'm not afraid of
[43:12.160 --> 43:19.280]  you you scum you white trash that's the thing about my cancer and anyways i'm like i'm gonna
[43:19.280 --> 43:24.720]  shut up i'm not gonna tell you more of the story i just started having flashbacks to all these events
[43:24.720 --> 43:29.200]  listen we're not the poor russian people that were always serfs never had freedom and who were
[43:29.200 --> 43:33.600]  enslaved we're not the germans that were strong smart people but had always been serfs and followed
[43:33.600 --> 43:38.880]  orders we're not all these other people america is the rag tag folks from all over the world
[43:38.880 --> 43:44.240]  that came here through adversity and who dot and and who do not want to be slaves and your new world
[43:44.240 --> 43:48.880]  order is not gonna work i don't care how much fluoride you put in the water i don't care how
[43:48.880 --> 43:56.800]  much gmo how much nfl how much britney spears how much lady gaga i don't care how much of it you push
[43:56.800 --> 44:04.080]  and you shove the spirit of 1776 is rising again they won't let us have industry they won't let us
[44:04.080 --> 44:09.520]  have jobs we're shutting down our power plants but they built a giant power plant just for
[44:09.520 --> 44:13.760]  that nsa center the first thing they built five years ago when they broke ground on that
[44:13.760 --> 44:20.560]  abomination so you see they get power they get money they get energy you get cut off
[44:20.560 --> 44:27.040]  it's military it's called siege and obviously those security guys don't know that obviously
[44:27.040 --> 44:32.080]  they're not bad people on average but they've been taught we're the enemy so everything's fair game
[44:32.080 --> 44:38.400]  with us everything is not fair game we're not here to be raped we're not here to be pushed around
[44:38.400 --> 44:45.200]  we're not here to be abused we're done we're not taking it anymore oh man is there any live
[44:45.200 --> 44:51.280]  feed or is that it is it all gone has the live feed archived yet so we can go back and show
[44:51.280 --> 44:55.920]  them the police and what happened when they grabbed the camera again folks i've checked the law i've
[44:55.920 --> 45:02.160]  checked the federal court rulings and they all know this too that they went up to the parking lot area
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.480]  it's they could call it espionage if you went over that fence but all of its public
[45:08.480 --> 45:12.480]  we're not doing it from an espionage perspective for some foreign power we're doing it for the
[45:12.480 --> 45:16.640]  american people under the first amendment the truth is the nsa is run by the foreign banking
[45:16.640 --> 45:21.600]  cartel on record they are the foreign power that took our money and built this cancerous
[45:21.600 --> 45:28.080]  criminal institution that is expanding and metastasizing right now that's what happened
[45:28.080 --> 45:32.480]  i'm putting all these people on notice and so they always try to intimidate and and arrested
[45:32.480 --> 45:38.880]  reporters mainstream reporters you name it the last five years lawsuits were filed the nsa lost
[45:39.600 --> 45:45.760]  because you can go up to a military base as a reporter and say i want to talk to your public
[45:45.760 --> 45:51.920]  information officer or your public affairs officer but they try to act like that is some
[45:51.920 --> 45:58.480]  freaky horrible thing to do something like that photography is not a crime they tried
[45:58.480 --> 46:02.960]  and charged him but then they got thrown out of court a resident of illinois we had on last year
[46:02.960 --> 46:08.320]  was life in prison for videotaping police and you can see the nsa center back there about 400
[46:08.320 --> 46:14.560]  yards away just the edge of it over that hill and you know here are the guys getting out of their
[46:14.560 --> 46:19.920]  vehicle all on a power trip because they work for the nsa it's shameful that you work for the
[46:19.920 --> 46:28.000]  foreign occupational bank system it's shameful it's shameful it's shameful that you're part of the
[46:28.000 --> 46:34.320]  fake illegal shadow government it's absolutely shameful and the sleeping giant that is america
[46:34.320 --> 46:41.040]  is awakening and more and more we the people other reporters other newspaper reporters just
[46:41.040 --> 46:45.520]  four or five years ago they had san antonio express news and other san antonio papers i
[46:45.520 --> 46:49.920]  forget the name of their weekly go out to the nsa center they were building right by a walmart
[46:49.920 --> 46:53.760]  it's about a third the size of this one it's the size of five or six big football fields just the
[46:53.760 --> 47:01.360]  buildings and they came and arrested the reporter and took his film footage and then later dropped
[47:01.360 --> 47:07.840]  their fake charges because it's all fake it's outrageous folks it came out now that people
[47:07.840 --> 47:13.040]  at prayer breakfasts with obama that mildly criticized abortion were then audited and
[47:13.040 --> 47:18.960]  harassed under obama's orders the emperor you go to a prayer breakfast here it is irs audited

[47:40.480 --> 47:45.200]  total color law that's fraudulent and they know it they're saying we cannot leave unless we delete

[47:50.640 --> 47:54.240]  to state the authority under law please state the law which says we need to do that

[48:02.720 --> 48:08.160]  leave but you're in the parking area yeah we're in the parking area that I say

[49:42.640 --> 49:48.560]  it appears to be a parking lot but all right Alex now anthony you make the decision on what you
[49:48.560 --> 49:53.440]  feel is best as long as they delete the stuff back before it's obviously a violation of the first
[49:53.440 --> 49:57.520]  amendment and we'll have a court case i don't wish to sue him but it is important for the first
[49:57.520 --> 50:03.280]  amendment will probably be forced to uh so so i would tell you that even though these are probably
[50:03.280 --> 50:11.360]  in my opinion uh illegal orders you are in a dangerous situation oh yeah oh yeah um well
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.560]  yes well let's talk let's talk about that specifically uh at a later time give me give
[50:16.560 --> 50:21.520]  me the u.s. code that he's giving you one more time please please provide the code one more time
[50:21.520 --> 50:25.520]  for why you need to come skate all of our equipment and delete it or arrest us can you try the code
[50:25.520 --> 50:30.640]  one more time excuse me sir can you give me that code one more time they're not letting us to walk
[50:30.640 --> 50:38.720]  away can you can you give us that code you see a far 228. what zero three see a far 228.03 he says
[50:38.720 --> 50:42.240]  under that code we have to provide every single thing that we took here and delete it
[50:42.240 --> 50:48.480]  say that again that's that's that's what law it says we're trespassing on see a far 22 what
[50:49.200 --> 50:54.880]  228.0 oh no no that's trespassing he has to tell you to go so he's no no no tell him you
[50:54.880 --> 50:59.840]  are going since he told you we're leaving why what does that have to do with uh taking all the
[50:59.840 --> 51:05.920]  cameras and stuff why do it what is that okay tell him i comply with elite with your trust
[51:06.720 --> 51:11.280]  tell tell him i comply with you with your trespassing order we comply with your trespassing

[51:15.520 --> 51:24.000]  we comply immediately with the trespassing order we will leave okay yes yes so you heard him you need
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.320]  to leave but you can't leave so he's going to get a serious civil rights lawsuit with that type of
[51:28.320 --> 51:34.960]  talk listen listen listen we don't have a problem with that we're wondering why under that law why
[51:34.960 --> 51:42.640]  do we have to delete everything we took where is it say that in the law okay everything from here why
[51:44.640 --> 51:49.840]  he says the sign says we can't do it so we have to do it well that's sign uh i mean they put those
[51:49.840 --> 51:54.800]  we're not allowed to film or anything they put that that's that's now the constitution that sign is
[51:54.800 --> 52:03.120]  now the constitution but he's let let me talk to him is actually just talk here just talk to
[52:03.120 --> 52:08.240]  him to go either they're all refusing to talk to you they know they know who we are is it public
[52:08.240 --> 52:17.360]  law or do you say cfr cfr cfr yeah correct code of federal regulation yeah since we're trespassing
[52:17.360 --> 52:21.040]  here i'll do it he won't say that actually he says we delete it he's just saying you're trespassing
[52:21.040 --> 52:26.320]  how he's to collect everything delete everything yeah no no he's telling you to leave telling you
[52:26.320 --> 52:32.400]  to leave it's not a vibe it's not a power to erase your property yeah what what gives you the power
[52:32.400 --> 52:38.400]  to erase the property under the law well just because one restricts property why does it mean
[52:38.400 --> 52:42.800]  we have to delete everything on our cameras or cops get it doesn't make sense
[52:47.360 --> 52:53.920]  listen you guys put in the wrong code that's not it it's it's it's cfr 22803
[52:55.520 --> 52:59.840]  i don't even see that there and plus i've studied this law before you're in a public
[52:59.840 --> 53:05.120]  commons area i told you leaving it stuff right now they got the cameras they're deleting it
[53:06.160 --> 53:12.320]  they're just deleting it right now i mean short of me literally taking it yeah so they overpowered

[53:39.280 --> 53:48.080]  know that anyways well i think we need legal i think we need legal counsel on this issue i mean
[53:48.080 --> 53:54.800]  it's well listen listen they've already in a piratical way seized your equipment outside of law
[53:54.800 --> 54:00.640]  from the research i've done uh and uh you need to you you need to leave and say we're trying to

[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:50.080]  wars dot com what happened behind the scenes so we get to the nsa center we were going to go to
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.440]  the military portion of it where they have this massive tower and everything like that but we
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:59.200]  went into the back road and it was a bunch of signs no footage no filming and everything and we
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.120]  said well you know we'll we just want to go and and go in and do what's going on so we went to
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.920]  the parking lot we didn't even get like it was essentially behind enemy lines but we didn't even
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:12.720]  go any better crazy we're in the parking lot and we were going up to this office this first
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.560]  unmarked office and we had the cameras going with the livestream that you can see that's up on
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:23.120]  info wars dot com and uh the guy comes out and says turn those cameras off right now and he gets
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:27.600]  into his car and literally peels out like he just puts his pedal to the metal and just skids over
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:33.440]  there just blazing fast over he jumps out of the car it's unmarked unmarked board with uh no
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.920]  indication it's gonna say at all remember these are the people that spy on everything we do and
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.280]  then and then and then you go to the gate that's what that is there's a parking lot that is a gate
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.880]  over there it's a gate and they act like it's the end of the world what a bunch of drama queens
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:54.080]  let's be clear there was no gate it was just a road no i know i'm saying i'm saying you went to the
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:00.400]  parking area outside the base that that building you wanted to go to is the gate exactly exactly
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:04.640]  we didn't even go down the gate right we didn't trust but we just went to the parking lot and
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:08.160]  you know they spy on us all day so we figured hey let's just do a live stream and we'll ask them
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.000]  we'll be friendly with them we were not we were actually pretty nice we walked up to their office
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.560]  and he turned those cameras off more now and then he and he just goes around he calls back up he says
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:22.960]  i need help on his on his little radio and then a ton of our smart cars he physically took josh's
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.120]  camera and turned it off took the phone turned it off he just confiscated all of them i started
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.640]  turning them all off and then i was talking to you on the phone he said give me that phone now
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.920]  he just took it out and just turned it off and uh then he gets all his buddies there and he was like
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:41.040]  oh i'm the lieutenant nsa officer and they are like give us your ideas right now and i said are you
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.600]  going to arrest me he's like maybe and i said well we were just going to the office over there he said
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.920]  if you would have gone into that office my dog would have got you and i said well what do you
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:54.320]  what do you what what are you talking about he's like i got a canine in there and i'm like oh so
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.960]  your dog would literally attack me if i went to the dog he's like i'm not staying there and they

[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.920]  the national guard base we called ahead they said just come to the gate uh we had footage of it my
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:18.720]  film police stayed for the rise of fema rob do and jason bermas and others pull up they're very
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.000]  polite like to talk to a public information officer here's his name we're supposed to be here
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.680]  they act all freaked out because we're terrorist i mean there's never any real terrorist government
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.960]  runs al qaeda government runs the drugs everything else so finally someone's come enemy americans
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:37.680]  as homeland security is in the news today here's the headline dhf's uh chief
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:45.120]  government calls privacy groups terrorists that's a quote that's in congress so so any
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:51.680]  freedom is terrorism folks and all of a sudden the police come to their hotel i'm up here at night
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:57.920]  working the cops call my cell phone and go your guys threatened to blow up the base
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:04.320]  and i went no they didn't uh i told him to go talk to the public information officer we've been
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.160]  calling them days before he goes well with it and i go you know we have footage of all that
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:13.280]  he goes oh you do uh and i better talk to the military he calls me back to minister he goes
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:18.960]  nothing to worry about alex we know you are everything's fine the cop called me to sit like
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:24.640]  i was going to go oh yes i'm a terrorist these people are out of their gourds folks
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:31.760]  looks they it's like play acting oh look it's the press their terrorists get them they want to
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:37.840]  blow us up so i want to warn my reporters i don't know that if they'll act like this in utah
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:43.680]  but in the case of pittsburgh and then they still arrest the dude days later like that's the one
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.600]  right there he's like filming with all the press they come and they pick him out so they lost the
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:51.840]  lawsuit and take him to a center where they chained everyone down in the rain all night
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:57.040]  and they did a bunch of other stuff to him that i've been asked not to mention not to do but to
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:03.280]  other people i told part of once somebody got irritated i mean that's what they do i know
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:07.440]  it's humiliating i've been in juvenile before and you know had one of the jail guards try to
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.080]  have sex with me i mean this is what this is why they get these jobs i mean it's what goes on
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:18.080]  but uh one thing about this abuse is we have to say what they did it's like if a woman gets raped
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:24.400]  uh you've got to come out about it and it's the same deal we have to admit the government's
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:28.880]  abusing us that's why they act like it's a end of the world if you come and try to film their
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:33.280]  big illegal sinner because remember up until the mid 90s i would get criticized people would say
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:39.920]  there is no nsa there is no echelon when james bamford and others had gone public and wane madson
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:47.360]  and others and they just flip out like it's the end of the world there's the footage folks they
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.440]  actually got the high def footage if you're watching us at info wars dot com forward slash show
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:57.280]  info wars dot com forward slash show uh you can see the master feed of the radio show and their
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:02.160]  live feeds sync together or you can just go to info wars dot com on the main page and we have info
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:08.080]  wars reporters at the nsa center acting like we're a national security threat for being on the parking
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:13.120]  lot where the buses and stuff come in it's a giant facility it'll bigger than mall of america on record
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:19.040]  with them reading your emails watching your webcam harassing their girlfriends and wives
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.680]  mainly spying on economic data to give it to select globalist corporations
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:27.920]  i mean they're just in there committing millions of crimes a day in fact it's billions because
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.160]  every time they do without a warrant it's a crime and and now they've had senator
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:39.920]  diane feinstein come out two days ago and admit in a hearing they always screw up and say classified
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.240]  stuff in public that's what dr bowman always talked about the stuff he could admit about
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:49.680]  star wars and black mana and things were because the other people had blurted stuff out you know
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:53.520]  in congressional hearings she goes of course the whole backbone's tapped of course we're listening
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:58.720]  that's on record they're like oh man that's classified they're listening to everything
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:04.640]  criminally and they're building giant mother ships to spy on us to dial into their imperial
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:10.400]  probe droid smart meters and iPhones and droids and computers and washers and dryers everything
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:16.720]  with microphones and cameras watching and listening to you on record and then you can go on google
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:22.000]  maps you could sit outside the entrance there and videotape that parking lot and then the guard shack
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.480]  and the and the real entrance all day long but they have to puff up and show up and act like
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:32.080]  oh my gosh national security american citizens have shown up no no it's dangerous to new world
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:38.560]  order security that we're there shining light on you and then the mystique is gone everybody's not

[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:05.840]  about no fear all day it's a bunch of talk it's not manly to go to a football game and get drunk
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:11.440]  and act powerful and bug your eyes out at people it's manly to go expose the people raping our
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:17.840]  birthright of privacy and liberty and using the data against this on record to corner the economy
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:23.920]  and give it to offshore corporations america is captured and the sooner all these nsa people man

[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:38.000]  and saying we can do whatever we want good shard he hadn't got to that on air yet I wanted to tell
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.520]  everything that happened and it just really freaks me out because I nicely just said to these cops
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:47.600]  and their wives that were also in law enforcement who were bragging about going to work for the
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:54.080]  NSA in san Antonio I just said oh the NSA and they're like who are you scum and I just that's
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.440]  why I don't like country clubs and people think they're better than me just because they're part
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:02.240]  of some clique and they're paid for by my money and I saw some cop trying to run people off the
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:07.360]  road for fun yesterday drive it into work just running up behind people for fun when you could
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:11.600]  get past them and then just doing it messing with people I mean this is the essence of like living
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:17.840]  in North Korea or the worst areas of Mexico and it gets to me and I don't know maybe people don't
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:23.200]  have the spirit of liberty but my family both sides on the Mayflower both sides that's very rare
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:29.520]  my family all over the Texas Revolutionary War my family in the original Revolutionary War
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:33.520]  all across the board folks and I don't even get into it I mean everybody's got a little bit of
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:39.760]  history in their background the point is I literally literally boil with anger when I think about this
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:45.680]  but where is the instinct to not want to be trampled on I mean I guess we are a nation of slaves
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:50.320]  what we put up with where they put in the newspaper they're watching kids at home over their laptops
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:56.960]  illegally and it comes out it's happening from Missouri to California to Pennsylvania and nobody
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:01.600]  gets in trouble I mean when we first were talking about that a decade ago people didn't believe us
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.960]  now it's just all over the news yeah we watch kids at home big deal yeah google's listening to you
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.560]  with the microphones big deal and then you go and say hey we want to talk to your public information
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:19.200]  officer hey we got dogs you shouldn't be giving that camera I mean it's like it's out of control
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:23.680]  and they're there to intimidate us let's go back to Anthony Gutiarty with Weldon Henson and others
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:29.280]  Anthony tell folks in a nutshell how they were threatening you yeah so the guy turns dreaming
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:33.520]  enough to turn our cameras off because we have to go on to the NSA parking lot which by the way
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:38.640]  is funded with taxpayer dollars is actually our property but anyway so he comes out he just squeals
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:44.000]  his tires comes off speeds over here he just demands to hand over the cameras as if we're
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.440]  just slaves they're gonna bow to him and just like give him all of our properties but give me
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:51.680]  those cameras they're gonna turn those off we're gonna delete all that footage and we just said no
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.840]  I'm not gonna do that you know tell us why and I actually said I wasn't even confrontational at
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:59.440]  first I just said hey you know we're just we want to talk to your public affairs officer
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.880]  contact your commanding officer we just want to go ahead see what's going on here
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.360]  we have a few questions and he was like no I'm not saying nothing till you give me those cameras
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.680]  till you turn the cameras off and everything like that and we had to on live streaming you can watch
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.960]  it until he turned off the live stream and turned off the cameras and what happened was then I said
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:21.920]  well we want to know why there's underground bunkers in your NSA area why are there underground
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:25.920]  bunkers that obviously have ventilation shafts that are there and Weldon Henson who's former
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:30.000]  military could say that he actually worked you know on some similar stuff and he can tell them
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.440]  and then we said why is there a military outpost right there that actually connects with the NSA
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:37.600]  hey and later by the way when I was on camera he was like oh no that has nothing to do with the
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:43.520]  NSA there's a literal road from the military base oh no no no listen all they're gonna do
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:50.080]  is lie to you because you're the enemy yeah yeah so then base does is he just goes over and takes
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:55.120]  Josh's uh takes the iPhone which we were streaming with and just turns it off and he's like give me
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:59.440]  that he just takes it and we're like well what are you doing what are the laws for this and before
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:05.280]  that he got on his little radio said I need help and like a bunch of unmarked cars came over
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:10.400]  surveilling us from everywhere and a bunch of dudes came out they were NSA officers lieutenant
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.760]  like they use military ranks now because they think they're cool and they think they're the NSA
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:17.920]  and they're the ones spying on people and they're they're nothing and they come out and they say
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:24.000]  give me those cameras now and they took they took the cameras of course they just grabbed it out of
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.800]  Josh's hands turned off the live stream turned off the cameras we said hey we want to talk to
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:33.280]  your publicist there that I don't care give me those cameras I'm not saying oh you do say my check
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:38.800]  boy yep we gotta pay him so they took cameras turned off all the stuff and then we're standing there
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.640]  I'm saying you're not deleted content I'm not allowing you to leave the content we will leave
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:48.800]  we will leave and he's like no it's illegal under CFR whatever and we called you live on air and you
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:52.160]  looked it up it's not even what it says at all they have no idea it's not even the right one you
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.840]  referenced and he has no idea but we just kept saying that's not even true you're lying to us
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:00.240]  you're not telling us the truth it's completely fake and he was like no it's not I know the law
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:06.080]  I'm a lieutenant of the NSA I'll read your wife's email if I won't oh yeah and then they got my
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:10.720]  information too like give me your idea so are you going to arrest me if I don't give your ideas like
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:19.600]  maybe and then he's like I got a dog and I'm like it's really almost funny how pathetic it was
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:24.080]  and I was like what do you mean you have a dog I got canine he was going eat you up if you went
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:33.040]  over there and he's like give me all your ideas so I said listen I'll give you my idea if you just
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:38.400]  tell me you know why I hate it I mean they just kept threatening us like it's in a weird way where
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.840]  he doesn't actually say it that he was gonna arrest us and feed us and I was actually thinking they
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:46.640]  would probably do it so I gave them my business card and they're like oh anything can be already
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:54.240]  stay there stay there stay there we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex

[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:07.520]  have the real rowdy piper who by the way is a listener saying that on air here and i'm not bragging
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:12.400]  i'm gonna go back to gucciardi in a minute talking to pacenic on and off air it turns out we have
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:17.920]  an article out on info wars dot com today about it that tom clancy watched my films and listened
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:26.720]  to the show and that for 12 years since i first knew pacenic since 2002 that even before i knew
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.280]  pacenic because pacenic reached out to us if i remember correctly he and tom clancy would sit
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:36.800]  around talking about stuff that was on the show and then i think about how i got contacted by
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:43.680]  the assistant of kurt vonnegut and then sure enough he sent me some art correspondent with him
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:47.680]  got to talk to him on the phone a couple times there's all these other famous people i've never
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.240]  got to tell you about well even more famous than kurt vonnegut who don't want their names on air
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.560]  but i'm not bragging i'm just telling you i haven't realized how big this broadcast is
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:06.400]  and how long it's been big and how fast it's exponentially growing and it's not because
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:11.520]  i'm even that good it's that i'm willing to say what other people won't say i'm willing to talk
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:15.600]  about what other people won't talk about i'm able to build what other people won't build
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:20.320]  because i have just fundamentally been so upset about the globalist collectivization
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:28.320]  for 20 years 20 years ago i i woke up when i was about 19 years old i'm 39 about to be 40
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:34.240]  and i found that they were taking farmers property for no reason and giving it to rich banks to build
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.400]  on saying it was for environmental reasons i learned about them taking people's guns i learned
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:44.160]  about un brainwashing in the schools because my cousin was part of it i learned about and i knew
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:50.880]  it was authoritarianism i studied history so that i got to fight this and in 18 years being on air
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:55.920]  we've been able to do this and we're just now getting into our stride we're just now entering
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:03.120]  our prime and i do overheat like a race car engine and go up to 20 000 rpms and blow my engine
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:09.360]  sometimes on air and it's not an act folks people know that who know me i'm a very calm nice person
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:14.880]  except when i focus on this stuff and i do start flipping out because man it's so real the stuff
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:21.040]  i've seen the things we've covered and and and just it's so frustrating but then to also know that
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:28.240]  to know that we're routinely breaking huge news here on the air the drudge report drudge report
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:33.520]  dot com is carrying one of our stories today i get to you know interface with the biggest website
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:39.280]  in the world biggest news site in the world uh i get to know ron paul i get to know all of you
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:44.640]  out there we get to know all these great activists like anthony gucciardi and so many others that are
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:50.560]  out there and i get to learn about the power of free humanity and how effective we can be together
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:58.240]  yeah gucciardi is showing us the ticket that he was given by them about why they erased his
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:02.240]  material and they also gave him some other info uh we're going to show that in a minute by the way
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:07.360]  we were on the nsa site earlier it said if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear can we
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:12.400]  show that again i mean that is such a joke well what do they have to hide if they have nothing
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:16.880]  to hide they have nothing to fear that's the domestic surveillance directorate defending
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:23.920]  our nation securing our citizens yes securing us in prisons promoting transparency your data
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:29.040]  if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear connecting the dots we know we've connected
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:33.200]  the dots that you're run by foreign banks and that you're waging economic warfare on us and
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:36.320]  we've connected the dots even if you don't know how to delete footage on a camera and
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:40.400]  you know your average security personnel like the average american i bet those guys weren't dumb
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.360]  they just knew all the football and baseball scores and they know you know the measurements
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.840]  on their favorite model and they know they're the boss and the people bow to us and that's what
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:56.400]  freedom is let's go back to anthony gucciardi but my whole point is america and the world is waking
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:05.760]  up right now i am so honored to to be on air with you and i know i don't do the best job sometimes
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:11.360]  but we're real we love freedom and we're fearless because we we understand the stakes are too high
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:15.920]  we don't fight this in fact it's not true i'm not fearless i feel fearless but then i realized why
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.880]  i have a fearless feeling it's like if you're cornered and the person isn't going to let up
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:26.560]  and as you or them it's not fearless you just know what you got to do i guess i'm desperate
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.880]  who was the samurai i have trouble pronouncing his name who said the way of the samurai is desperate
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:43.840]  no that's that's the chinese sun sue is the chinese war expert the art of war but that's close
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:49.920]  no it's it's the way of the samurai is desperate such a man cannot be killed by 10 men or more is
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:56.000]  the quote you can pull it was like a famous i think shogun that said that and more and more
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.800]  in life i realized that it's desperateness it's in desperateness that we get out of the trance
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:05.840]  that we get motivated that we take action it's in desperateness that we have our real power
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:12.400]  desperately fighting for liberty throwing all of it on god and saying i'm taking the step god protect
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:17.920]  me god guide me that's where it's all at because i realized if their system comes in if their system
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:23.920]  fully goes into place it's already hellish it is it is curtains for all of us and all those
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:29.840]  billions of innocent children that are alive now and coming and we cannot turn the world over to
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:35.600]  the worst people and it's such a good feeling it's such a commitment to do the right thing and then
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:41.760]  to learn that we are influencing the japanese government since i mentioned that the syrian
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:47.680]  government the russian government the u.s government the big banks to learn that in the councils of
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:52.960]  government they're looking at what i say and when i do because they're so afraid themselves and so in
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:40:01.520]  the system and so specialized and so compartmentalized the world more and more comes here that's what
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:07.920]  msnbc calls me is this dangerous prophet and it's just bizarre to see the enemy sees me as that
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:13.520]  because they understand there's no real leadership against them and it's really bizarre to know that
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:18.880]  of the whole pantheon of resistance all the great people out there that i'm one of the main figures
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:26.160]  of resistance and that doesn't put me on a power trip it's the opposite it's the realization of the
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:32.000]  responsibility people say well then be more serious be more focused you know what god will
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:37.920]  leave god and direct me i'm just a man my best works are dirty rags i'm doing the best i can
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:43.840]  i'm pushing myself every night till 10 11 12 working hard getting up at 5 30 in the morning i'm
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:47.920]  doing the best i can but i just wanted to report to you the enemy's never going to tell you how
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.840]  much power you've got they're never going to tell us how effective we are but they know
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:59.840]  we have a chance humanity's waking up if some ragtag guy from texas on his own with the help of
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:06.240]  listeners could could really give the enemy a run for their money think what you can do
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:11.680]  as a computer software engineer or as a scientist or as a police officer or in the military or a
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:17.200]  teacher or a lawyer or a stay at home mom or an old man or an old woman all of you doing
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:23.600]  little things together lead to massive things if we just begin to move with just a tiny bit of
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.000]  energy we will defeat the globalists that's why they're racing to put their total control grids
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.920]  in place and then you got five minutes on the floor you're doing live feed at info wars dot
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:36.320]  com you've been talking in the background there tell us to finish up what they did to you what
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:41.040]  happened and by the grace of god they're fumbling bumbling doesn't even matter we already have
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:46.640]  the live stream footage anyways they couldn't even erase the footage off the cameras they could not
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:52.000]  and then we showed them that their law was a lie that they were legally able to delete everything
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.800]  and not only delete they were talking about literally taking the cameras themselves and
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:04.720]  taking them back with them and just keeping them to save the footage you know to make sure we
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:08.480]  delete the footage and we just kept saying you don't have the authority to do that you know you
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:13.280]  don't have the authority for that show us the law show us everything and they could not they
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:18.000]  kept saying so you have our whatever and that's just about trespassing what is his what is this
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.400]  ticket they gave you yeah so that's why i wanted to talk about a key point that i forgot to mention
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.560]  because there's so much saying tyranny going on with this whole thing they gave us they wrote
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:32.560]  up a police report on this and actually the nsa police report at the top you can see your it's
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:37.200]  a personal stop report nsa police they have all this stuff they have all our identification
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:43.600]  and everything in it and uh the badge number and the guy's name is here as well but the reason they
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:48.000]  wrote us up and this goes into the database by the way they told me i said i said what are you
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.120]  guys doing they said you know this your ideas your might arrest you know they didn't think we might
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:56.000]  arrest you but they said are you going to arrest us maybe i got dogs and they kept threatening us
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.080]  and then basically i gave them my business card first i said here you go take this they wrote
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:06.800]  down my name and everything and they put the reason as photography reason for stop and you
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:13.440]  know detainment photography that is literally what they did and then this is why king kong giving a
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:18.960]  tiny rhesus monkey a ticket for being in the uh in the ape family or the monkey family i mean
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:23.920]  these are the ultimate spies and you just go to their their their main gate wanting to talk to a
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:28.800]  public information person and they flip out well get this i said well hey we just want to talk to
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:33.760]  the public information office and they said oh here you go and he pulled it out of his get it
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:40.640]  and it's like jacket or maybe it's car pulled out this ridiculous like north korea guide i'm
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:48.160]  showing it right now sign for words the feed nsa national security agency saving lives saving lives
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:53.840]  they have a disk national security agency b-roll and it says why natural security agency is so
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:58.480]  important and they said here you go and they started laughing at me this is what we're going to give
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:04.640]  them look at the little fingerprint scanner on there building upon our rich heritage of spying
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.440]  because they have spying but our rich heritage so it talks about how they're saving lives and
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.240]  this is my personal favorite there is a literal fingerprint scanner it doesn't actually scan
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:19.520]  fingerprints but it's a mimic of a fingerprint scanner on this guide this insane guide i'm gonna
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:23.520]  keep it you can have it we'll bring it back to the studio national security agency that's
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:31.200]  celebrating 60 years wow 60 years giving select and tell the mega corporations to shut down the
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:37.440]  economy 60 years controlling narcotics trade 60 years destroying the family and making sure local
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:43.360]  police don't find out when we're flying little kids out to Saudi Arabia on c-130s 60 years of snuff
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:51.120]  films 60 years of pulling people's teeth out with pliers 60 years of running al-qaeda succeeding in
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:55.520]  today's operations at the top they're succeeding in all that and they said over and over again this
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:58.880]  has never happened before they could not believe that we're challenging them they guess what we
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.360]  want we got the footage we're bulletproof legally we have defeated them and they're just
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:08.880]  bunch of minions but overall they did identify with the NSA like here's our packet we're succeeding
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:13.200]  and saving lives they were just laughing at me they know what they're doing they they literally
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:17.680]  thought it was a huge joke that they were giving me this packet like haha yeah go ahead try and get
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.520]  in contact with the public affairs office probably shut down because the government shut down i said
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:28.320]  well the NSA is still going and they said yeah we are oh yeah we are we're still going they just
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:35.440]  love it well the issue is it shows what a pathetic country we've become that that it's an active
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:42.400]  supreme defiance and and heroism to go to the front gave the NSA and asked to speak to the
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:52.000]  public information officer and have them flip out and we did find uh at gio gpo.gov 228.13
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.880]  disturbances on protected property and this is what's been defeated in federal court before
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:01.200]  they're saying taking photos was a disturbance but in federal court that's been thrown out but
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:06.560]  this is what they were talking about let me read it on air any conduct which impedes you just pulled
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:10.960]  up politely and asked to talk to their public information person at their front gate or threatens
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:16.160]  the security well they're threatening the security of our first amendment security listen let me go
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:21.600]  further parking lot let me go further here any con well any slave near the illegal spice center
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:25.680]  again folks they're hiding in the dark let me just read this to you any conduct which impedes or
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:32.160]  threatens the security of the protected property or any buildings or persons thereon of which disrupts
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:39.680]  the performance of official duties by agency employees or which interferes with egress or egress
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:43.680]  of protected property that's what they use on the anti-abortion people on the sidewalk
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:48.400]  is prohibited also prohibited as any and this is just their synopsis to the law the law doesn't
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:55.360]  actually say this any prohibition is any disorderly conduct you weren't being disorderly
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:00.320]  any see that's how they try to use the clause any failure to obey an order to depart the premises
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:06.400]  so he this is really as i could tell he was trying to confuse you telling you to go but not letting
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:12.000]  you go wanting to then charge you with trespassing but we said the key words we agree to go we're
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:18.480]  following that order that's when they had to let you go any unwarranted loitering any behavior which
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:25.440]  creates louder unusual noises or nuisances or any conduct which obstructs the usual use of entrances
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:30.880]  four years lobbies corridors offices elevators stairways or parking lots yeah this is written
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:37.280]  for pro-life groups back in the 80s and you didn't do any of that you pulled up to the parking lot
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:42.080]  to go to the main gate to ask to talk to the press people and they flipped out like north
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:48.320]  koreans would because what they're doing on record is illegal inside anthony uchiati exactly we
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:52.560]  literally now it's illegal to be in a parking lot i mean it's not even that we went past the gate
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:55.920]  we were going to the office to ask for a public affairs officer which is what i actually had
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:00.560]  planned to do and ask them some questions and they were threatening us with arrest threatening us
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:05.600]  with the dogs attacking us and eating us and just being in a parking lot and they don't even know the
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:10.480]  law and he kept saying oh yeah under that law you have to give up all of your cameras not just here
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:15.040]  give them to me for a minute even it's not even that anymore see when when they succeed they
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:18.800]  pushed the ante they've been able to confiscate cameras before so now it's we're not just going
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:22.160]  to complicate them we're going to take them back to the station and then they're going to look at
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:26.160]  all the stuff he got and delete everything or who knows edit it film it make you look like you
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:29.520]  do something and we said hey we're just shooting a bunch of b-roll too i mean you can't delete all
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:36.160]  our stuff he said anything taken within this premises is illegal but it's not at all it's
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:40.960]  just a complete lie and they kept making up and they said yeah just leave i said well okay we'll
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:45.680]  leave we'll go no give us the cameras and i said well okay well we're gonna leave though we don't
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:50.000]  want to do that and then at the end finally once we were on the phone with you live or
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.440]  everything and they realized we kept saying it's online stream 11 million people saw it's online
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:59.840]  stream it's online stream over and over again then he was like he was just like so bad just
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:07.280]  he was literally caressing his gun at welden was he was he not absolutely absolutely here here
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:12.320]  here let's hear that from welden ensign threaten that a dog would eat you caressing the gun let's
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:18.880]  oh yeah dog is gonna get us and then yeah he would uh yeah but yeah but hand the hand the phone to
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.840]  welden i want to hear it directly from olden henson yeah yeah alex yeah tell us what happened buddy
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:28.320]  oh well literally you know they came out there they didn't like us filming so um
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:33.680]  they confronted us like anthony told you earlier i mean i already had the stream out the streaming
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:39.600]  camera out and man this guy came out real quick and was just started yelling hey you know uh put
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:43.600]  that camera away and we were like hey we're just trying to talk to somebody and we didn't even get
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:47.280]  it we were going to walk up to their building you know and and try to get an interview and
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:52.080]  and talk to him he didn't give us a chance i mean he jumped in his unmarked vehicle and just
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:56.480]  and filled the tires out and got over as quick as he could and turned the cameras off we said no
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:05.200]  and uh then he had a radio and get uh some more uh guys out there yeah he said i need help and um
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:11.840]  what was the part caressing the gun well obviously he was uncomfortable i mean this
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:18.880]  this first guy that showed up was definitely your typical you know roided out guy i mean he was yelling
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:24.800]  very angry i mean the other guys were were a little nicer but you could tell he was just uh
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:28.960]  man if he could if we could have done one wrong move i god i bet he'd have been real happy

[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:40.640]  then it won't matter they try to grab you at the airport but they're not going to do anything to you
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:45.200]  because they don't want to bring any attention on this they do not want people knowing that
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:50.720]  there's still americans left that would dare go to the steps of mordor and knock on the iron gate

[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:07.520]  an increase in circulating white blood cells this happens because nature designed us to eat food
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:12.480]  that is undamaged at the molecular level when we heat food to normal cooking temperatures
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:17.600]  we change the shape of the molecules into shapes the body cannot use the body now looks at them
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:22.960]  as toxins and allergens in an effort to protect itself from this irritant the body intelligently
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:27.840]  increases the amount of circulating white blood cells to act as garbage collectors white blood
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:32.240]  cells gobble up all the unusable damaged food particles to neutralize their cell damaging
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:36.640]  properties this puts stress on your organs of elimination and your body is subject to cell

[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:24.000]  restricted this leaked a few years ago photographing the exterior of federal facilities and it goes
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.960]  through that as long as someone hasn't passed through a prohibited controlled gate and they
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:34.160]  have had the law listed that they cannot take anybody's cameras or footage and it's the same
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:38.720]  thing and it even tells them in the u.s department of homeland security federal protective services
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:43.600]  and this came out and started losing in federal court in 2010 you can see the date on that where
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:49.360]  they lost all these court cases like one of them was like a million bucks but uh look here where
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:54.160]  it tells them how to handle it it says because the initial interview was voluntary pso should not
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:59.600]  seize the camera or its contents and must be cautious not to give such orders to a photographer
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:06.080]  to erase the contents of the camera as these constitutes a seizure or detention yeah false
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:11.680]  imprisonment felony all contents are all contact with the public including photographers must be
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:16.480]  conducted in a professional and polite manner pso personnel should not be distracted from their

[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:35.760]  all right folks i kind of went off the deep end today with this breaking news i knew the
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:40.000]  guys were going to the nsa i thought they would just say here's the pio and we're not going to
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.760]  talk to you instead they flipped out because i guess that data center hadn't been visited a lot
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:50.000]  like fort mead or san antonio they haven't been taught about the first amendment again and this
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:55.600]  is still america at least in some areas but if you just joined us quite a circus with the nsa
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:01:01.760]  illegally spying on everyone and i personally am sick of it i want to get your take as callers on
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:06.400]  the audio and the video if you're watching us on tv that you just saw and also on the government
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:13.600]  shutdown and uh barricades the new name for barricades feds try to shut down privately owned
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:21.520]  mount vernon it's privately owned administered by a private group but the fed shut it and they also
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:27.280]  did that uh at the world war two memorial as has now been confirmed by the daily caller yesterday
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:32.320]  it too is not administered by the feds but it's federal property they are blockading federal
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:37.920]  property that uh there's no effect spending extra money to do it and the government has shut down
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:42.880]  it's spread to beaches of normandy even though technically they don't own it they administer
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:48.400]  it so they shut that you can't go including groups of veterans that traveled over there uh to the
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:54.400]  memorial you're not allowed in and so they're posting guards to keep you and costing extra money
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:59.600]  all part of just just just total contempt the globalist hate the american people and they've
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:04.160]  trained all these police and military to think love of america is dominating the american people
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:10.640]  and securing us by getting rid of our freedoms no no we'll secure our liberties okay thank you
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:16.080]  so again obama deliberately blocked access to veterans memorials to make shutdown appear worse
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:21.520]  uh and i'm going to go over government shutdown 36 facts that prove that almost everything is
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:28.000]  still running unfortunately and also uh we've got to continue to shut down paralyzed politicians
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.080]  will just tell close the u.s. government is to collapse it's a mike adams natural news dot com
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:37.520]  article that really breaks it down that's up on info wars dot com morgan stanley says the government
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:43.920]  of the united states is not going to default yeah no kidding it's all still this is all just staged
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:48.320]  folks kind of like for three months they said that the u.s. debt had not gone up any they just
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:56.160]  froze the level to get around the law folks the globalists have hundreds of trillions of dollars
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:03:01.680]  and slush funds of drug money child kidnapping money all the things they run i mean this is a
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:07.840]  total criminal force and and and you've got some people trying to block the the absolute gutting
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:12.400]  of the country and so they're just doing this fake shutdown the welfare checks are going out
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:17.840]  they're all going out it's all happening uh and they're trying to maneuver the country towards
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:23.280]  final collapse and consolidation to the technocracy but they won't do that till they've got everybody
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:28.320]  dumbed down the family's broken down and at least half the people with cancer and they're trying to
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:32.160]  hurry that up with the vaccines and things they don't want to kill us too quick or we might notice
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:37.040]  you see so they need all those nsa cops to take give the give their kids shots and watch them have
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:42.800]  convulsions and wonder why and bite their tongues off and everything and you know the cop goes home
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:46.400]  you know changes his son's diapers when he's 10 years old but then goes out and gets to harass
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:50.960]  citizens when the globalist on record put stuff in the vaccine to brain damage his son he doesn't care
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:57.920]  there's cops losing right now who the government's killed their children kids have died i mean
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:04.800]  pediatric cancer is up 10 000 folks and i'm upset about it i noticed that the raw story and right
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:09.840]  wing watch or whatever it is made fun of me saying that the government got caught giving
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:13.920]  people syphilis they think that's real funny see because they can laugh at them they all know it's
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:20.800]  true but see they just laugh at it so it makes it okay so i i say go take your shot so none of
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:26.240]  the liberals take the shots you know the liberals that are actually authoritarians and manipulate
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:30.640]  well-meaning liberals they don't drink fluoride they don't take shots they don't eat gmo just like
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:35.040]  the communist party in china doesn't just like the ruling elite of europe don't on record they
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:40.400]  obsess over protecting themselves while they poison us it's all a big sick joke so those cops
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:45.040]  are on the same side as we are even if they don't join us they're still in the crosshairs being
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:50.960]  killed by the globalist but it's just like an oblivion when uh the rebel characters sends

[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:27.200]  shut down uh lodge with 12 rooms closes on cape cod monuments memorials stayed open i just mentioned
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:33.840]  that grocery stores and army bases closed already mentioned a lot of that uh but um student ordered

[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:49.520]  that's just some of the news on that front and they have armed guards now uh at the memorials
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:55.600]  threatening to arrest veterans and and i i keep seeing the images of the cops stopping veterans
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:12:00.800]  i guess the veterans are following the orders uh and and turning away or there would have been
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:06.720]  arrest but but thank goodness that you know that the nsa is there to spy on the veterans and not
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:13.360]  on the criminals uh at the white house here's some of the stuff that is still operating this is a
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:18.400]  michael schneider article from economic collapse blog upon info wars dot com government shutdown
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:24.800]  this is good to send out to friends and family uh 35 or 36 facts which prove that almost everything
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:30.480]  is still running and unfortunately according to the u.s senator ran poll 85 percent of all government
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:35.440]  activities are actually being funded during this government shutdown but they claim it 71 percent
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:40.080]  the truth is they're just actually beefing up many of their forces to deny access to people that
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:44.240]  had vacations and things planned just wait till they run all our health care and everything else
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:48.160]  and have a casual system in place i'm sure they won't abuse that or anything it just came out that
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:53.040]  they indeed are persecuting the main preacher from the prayer breakfast that dared to criticize
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:13:03.040]  obama that got him an audit admittedly i mean the emperor taught him that's not tyranny irs audited
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:10.880]  karson after prayer breakfast speech for his speech to now come out they said get him get him
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:14.960]  teach him about his free speech oh these aren't authoritarians everything's fine
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:21.280]  approximately one million three hundred fifty thousand essential federal employees will continue
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:27.680]  to work during this government shutdown overall 63 percent of federal workforce will continue to work
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:31.920]  during this government shutdown the u.s postal service will continue to deliver our mail
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:36.560]  during this shutdown u.s military personnel will remain on duty and will continue to get paid during
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:40.800]  with shutdown social security recipients will continue to get their benefits during the shutdown
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:44.640]  medicare recipients will continue to get their benefits during the shutdown medicare recipients
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:47.520]  will continue to get their benefits during the shutdown food stamp receptioners will continue
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:50.800]  to get their benefits during the shutdown. Those on employment will continue to get their
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:55.320]  benefits during the shutdown. Everyone with the World War II vets won't be getting their
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:59.680]  pensions though. Just globalists love you so much. Federal retirees will continue to
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:03.960]  get their pensions unless you're a military because you're the enemy. You're no longer
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:09.600]  of use to the new world order. Number 12, the federal school lunch program will continue.
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:15.560]  Public schools all over the country will continue sucking off everybody's property tax. 14,
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:19.680]  most all federal law enforcement officials will continue working. The Federal Reserve
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:23.280]  will remain completely functional because it's not federal, it's foreign and private.
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:27.000]  The Supreme Court will continue to operate normally and federal courts have enough money
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.880]  sucked out of the public to keep operating. The TSA employees will continue to molest
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:35.440]  your family. Air traffic controllers will continue monitoring traffic at airports.
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:39.000]  Hopelessly, outman board patrol agents will continue to try to stem the tide of illegal
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:44.160]  immigration. Visas and passports will continue to be issued by the State Department. Veterans
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:48.920]  administration will continue to offer substantial medical services and it will be able to continue
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:53.280]  processing benefit payments for at least for now for those that are disabled. The Obama
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:58.600]  administration apparently has plenty of money to have on closing open air memorials that
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:02.240]  are usually open to the public 24 hours a day. They have extra money to do that and
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:07.280]  guard them 24 hours a day to keep the slaves out. 23, the Department of Defense announcement
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:15.360]  that the awarding of 94 new contracts worth of combined totals of more than $5 billion
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:19.960]  for the government shutdown. The NSA continued to get its funding. 24, the government shutdown
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:26.080]  has not prevented the new $2 billion NSA spy center opening up that we just visited today.
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:31.640]  How dare us. 25, federal prisons will continue to operate normally with all their people
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:36.040]  that didn't pay money to the government for dealing drugs. If you paid the money, you'd
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:42.160]  be a CIA commander. 26, Amtrak trains will continue to run. 27, the Patent and Trademark
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:46.080]  Office will continue to be open. 28, the Consumer Product Safety Commission will continue to
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:51.920]  issue product recalls in the products create an immediate threat to safety of human life
[02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:56.800]  like the GMOs and the Aspartame. Oh, I'm sorry, that'll all stay in. 29, the National Weather
[02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:00.880]  Service and Hurricane Center will continue to track weather patterns. Yeah, the satellites
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:04.800]  are still up there. 30, if the federal government needs to respond to a natural disaster, the
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:08.920]  shutdown will not affect that. Yeah, that's come out now with a new hurricane. NASA will
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:12.780]  continue to support the Mars Rover and two American astronauts up on the International
[02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:18.360]  Space Station. 32, all city employees of DC government have been deemed essential and
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:23.640]  will continue to suck off the public. 33, even though the Obamacare exchanges are not
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:28.280]  working properly, people will still be able to access them and be threatened with prison
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:32.640]  time if they don't pay $5,000. The IRS will continue to collect taxes and pay it to the
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:37.280]  private federal reserve. Barack Obama 35 will continue to get paid the full duration of
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:43.640]  the shutdown and have red carpets and chefs everywhere and ospreys flying as dog and everything
[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:48.240]  else. The U.S. Al-Qaeda will still get hundreds of millions of months to attack Syria and
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:52.680]  blow up all the churches. 36 and chop the priest heads off and rape the nuns and chop
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:57.680]  children up and scream, we love you, bin Laden. Oh, so great. The U.S. Congress will continue
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:01.080]  to get paid for the duration of the shutdown. You want to just keep going? Actually, there's
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:06.320]  too many of these. I better stop. I'm going to stop right there, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:12.040]  and go to your phone calls. Go to your phone calls. Oh, I'm sorry. Obama sounds alarm about
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:15.680]  social security checks. Even though you're actually going to be getting him, he's trying
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:20.400]  to fear monger now that you won't get your checks. Business Insiders reporting right
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:25.560]  now. That's the top link up on drudgereport.com. We're going to get it posted up on infowars.com
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:32.800]  as well and prismplanet.com. Obama just played his big trump card on the debt ceiling. Reason,
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:36.320]  they want you domesticated. They've been getting your money. That matter that you only get
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:40.320]  about half what you would have got with a guaranteed 3% investment. They've got your
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:43.600]  money. Of course, they already stole it all. They're just giving you fiat currency. It
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:49.040]  doesn't matter. Early today, the Potomac Research Group analyst, Greg Valery predicted
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:53.000]  that if the debt ceiling deadline grew closer, President Barack Obama would play his trump
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.760]  card in the debate. He would remind seniors that if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling,
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:02.440]  seniors wouldn't get their social security checks. GOP strategist Carl Rove surely knows
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:07.480]  that it's just a matter of time before President Obama throws a game changer, warning seniors
[02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:12.400]  that their social security checks won't be mailed because of John Boner. Valery wrote
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:17.800]  a few hours later, Obama did just that during a speech at M. Lewis Construction Company.
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:22.400]  He said if a government shutdown, social security checks will still go out on time. An economic
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:27.800]  shutdown, if we don't raise the debt ceiling, they won't go out on time. Obama said, in
[02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:32.680]  a government shutdown, disability benefits still arrive on time. In an economic shutdown,
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:38.120]  they won't. He went on to basically say, we have to fund our obligations or it'll collapse,
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:45.880]  holding us hostage, ladies and gentlemen, to the new world order. That's what it's
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:53.480]  all about. Knick-knack-patty-whack, give the dog a bone. The new world order has turned
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:58.040]  us all into domesticated slaves, so take your vaccines and remember they love you.
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:00.520]  Frank in Michigan, you're on the air. Go ahead, extremist.
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:06.720]  Hello, Alex. Hey, buddy. Hey, how you doing? I hope you're having a good day today. I kind
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:12.240]  of blew up earlier and shot my voice out, but I'm all right. Yeah, I saw that. Hey,
[02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:19.600]  I just want to say something about this whole World War II vet thing. I'm so angered about
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:24.920]  it, I can barely see straight. Take some pills. The government loves you.
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:32.240]  Yeah, they love that. I just have a couple of comments about it. I'd like to see what
[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:40.280]  you think about it. There's been a lot of coverage on these vets coming, making their
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:48.120]  pilgrimage. Some of them, it's the only time they can make it to see it. And, you know,
[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:55.920]  it breaks my heart to see these men that watched their buddies die in combat. And now they've
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:20:01.600]  got extra-duty police and overtime to not let them go in the memorial.
[02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:06.640]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy, so you may know a few things

[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:17.200]  Back in 1992, I used to watch Alexander Hague's business news hour almost every day when I
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:23.880]  had a chance on cable. He explained how the NSA was going to watch everybody. Everything
[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:29.040]  would go through these data clouds. How there'd be blimps and drones that were solar powered
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:35.840]  that were ultralight, launch that would watch everything we did and track everybody. And
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:41.960]  he had a company that actually sold the plans for it to DARPA. Here it is on info wars.com
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:47.960]  to meet the drone that can fly for years. And it's an ultralight aircraft with solar
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:54.560]  wings and tail with loving surveillance pod, of course, that can fly for years watching
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:25:00.440]  you the slaves. And it's so lightweight when it crashes it won't even hurt anybody unless
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:04.280]  it was to actually crash into a person. If it crashed into your house it would just crumple
[02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:10.080]  up. And they've got your money unlimited and contracts they give themselves so they're
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:14.240]  just going to launch tens of thousands of these. But don't try to videotape that or
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:19.120]  you're a terrorist. And don't point out they run Al Qaeda publicly or you're a terrorist.
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:23.520]  And don't point out that they're New World Order or you're a terrorist. Frank and Michigan,
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:26.480]  I'm going to go to Alan and others. What was your point, sir?
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:33.920]  Well, my thought is this. We're our senators and our congressmen. They're all watching
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:41.160]  us too. Why can't they come down there to that memorial and take a stand and say, you
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:49.640]  know, this is ridiculous what these men come through. Let's see what the Obama police do
[02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:55.480]  to them. I mean, you know, they're for us. They're for the American people. Prove it.
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:26:01.080]  Show me what you got. Show me how, you know, how you're going to represent me by defending
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:09.600]  these Americans that fought for our country and, you know, have come all this way to look
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:10.600]  at this memorial.
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:15.680]  Well, I'll be honest with you. I think George Washington was the greatest generation. And
[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:19.360]  then of course both my grandfathers were in World War II and were great guys and compared
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:24.960]  to us, they were a great generation, a greatest generation. But I think part of this greatest
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:28.520]  generation thing is what made everybody think, well, the government can do no wrong. Let's
[02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:33.440]  all go to sleep. We're the good guys. And so evil totally took over. But the archetypal
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:37.520]  image of the vets being turned away from memorials, the feds don't even run. Then they're out
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:43.560]  there grandstanding shows what tyrants that the system is. And they didn't even see this
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:52.480]  as a PR disaster. That's how hamfisted the the authoritarians are. But yes, I get very
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:57.080]  upset when I see founding fathers like George Washington demonized by the Department of
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:02.000]  Defense in official manuals. So of course they don't like the World War II veterans.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:07.440]  And of course it's only World War II veterans that'll push past cops. I mean, they had a
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:14.520]  lot of cases one in Tennessee, but some other famous cases when vets came back during the
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:18.200]  end of World War II and they'd come back and boss hogs had taken over their towns. Well,
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:21.160]  there's the battle of Athens, Tennessee. You can pull that up. They made a movie out of
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:25.200]  it. It's true story where the boss hogs wouldn't want to have the election or enslaving everybody
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:30.480]  with taxes. So they just went and had a gun battle with them and ran them out. And this
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:35.280]  in the county tried to call the police on them and tried to call the feds on them and
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:39.000]  tried to call the governor on them and nobody stood with them because everybody knew it
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:45.520]  was a corrupt town. Well, I mean, so I mean, you got to say I know my grandfather on my
[02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:49.720]  dad's side helped push a bunch of boss hog types out the Rover tax and people when he
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:54.360]  came back from World War II and he got elected county tax assessor and stuff and cut the
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:58.840]  taxes way down. And I still run into people out in that county in East Texas who come
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:05.000]  up and thank me for my family cutting property taxes down to nothing. That was the view of
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:08.680]  you're a poor person. You know what? We're just not, there's no property taxes. How's
[02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:16.600]  that sound? I mean, and that's what the property taxes are unconstitutional folks. Only people
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:22.000]  that got taxed when my grandfather got elected a county tax assessor and died county tax
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:30.600]  assessor in Friestone County. When he died county tax assessor, people came from all
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:37.560]  over the place. Shots fired US Capitol. They're pulling a big distraction on us. We're going
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:40.960]  to go to break. I just canceled our guests. It's coming up so I can get everybody's calls.
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:43.880]  Frank, I appreciate you. We're going to get everybody else and cover these shots when
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:49.360]  we come back. But look for them to stage a bunch of stuff. But Chenek, who's really got
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:54.200]  his ear to the ground, he says the Navy Yard was a staged event and he has sources. So
[02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:59.040]  look for more of that to happen very, very soon to change the subject because everything
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:06.600]  the globalists do is falling apart right now. But I was getting into county tax assessing.
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:10.200]  His view was you tax the big corporations that come into town because they're getting
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:17.080]  the infrastructure anyways and they want to help the community and then you don't tax
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:25.480]  poor people. You don't predatorily use property taxes to take poor people's land. And of course,
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:30.760]  that's the old fashioned model. He was elected on a whole wave of Eisenhower Republicans
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:37.080]  who were mainly World War II vets. But we need the same type of revolution in this country
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:43.520]  now where people just start not doing what the globalists want. That's what we need.
[02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:46.360]  Every generation has to deal with this type of stuff. We're going to come back and take
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:55.080]  more phone calls. Stay with us. We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones

[02:32:01.400 --> 02:32:06.960]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:12.040]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged. You can even make your own colloidal
[02:32:12.040 --> 02:32:16.480]  silver at home in your garage. How do you know which solution is the safest and most
[02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:22.680]  effective? Supernatural silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts
[02:32:22.680 --> 02:32:28.640]  of AC current. This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory. Colloidal
[02:32:28.640 --> 02:32:34.720]  and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver
[02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:40.680]  hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus. Supernatural silver
[02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:45.880]  liquid can be used internally. And our silver gel can be used topically. To find out more

[02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:45.200]  My friends, shots fired near the capitol. The capitol's on lockdown. They're supposedly
[02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:52.720]  chasing some suspect. This is the second highest crime rate in the country, as DC, with the
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:59.040]  total gun ban for slaves. And so just more grandstanding by the permanent state. Again,
[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:02.720]  I've been to third world countries that are nothing like DC. You were treated like absolute
[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:08.800]  trash. So were families with children by the goons. And I shouldn't say goons, the capitol
[02:34:08.800 --> 02:34:12.080]  SWAT team are listeners, but they actually respond to stuff. I'm talking about the general
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:15.680]  security guards and police. But there they are running around with their guns right there,
[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:20.760]  the guys that were told to stand down a few weeks ago at the Navy Yard event. Let's go
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:22.960]  to some of that audio.
[02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:27.520]  Members coming down the steps after a boat didn't have anything on them, but they really,
[02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:30.960]  you know, took that very seriously. They tackled him toward the top from the steps. They were
[02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:36.640]  very concerned about that. And in July of 1998, there was a shooting here where they
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:43.520]  killed two Capitol police officers. Jacob Chesnut was one of them and an officer who
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:48.720]  was on Tom DeLay's detail at the time. He came in through a door and shot people immediately.
[02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:53.040]  And to that point, those were the only two people ever killed defending the U.S. Capitol
[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:54.680]  that was in July of 1998.
[02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:59.160]  All right. Chad Pergram giving us the latest details there. Now it's just breaking news
[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:04.680]  coming into Fox that there may have in fact been those shots fired inside the Capitol
[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:08.680]  building as was originally reported, then quickly changed to outside. Let's get right
[02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:12.160]  to our Catherine Harridge, who may have the very latest on that. Catherine, what can you
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:13.160]  tell us?
[02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:16.960]  Yeah. Thank you very much, Gretchen. A short time ago, I was not able to get through immediately
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:21.720]  to someone at Homeland Security because of the government shutdown. About one in ten
[02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:26.000]  of the employees over at Homeland Security are out this week. By the way, that's pure
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:27.000]  bold.
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:31.240]  They didn't reach the operations. They never answered the phone. Were they monitoring incoming
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:32.240]  threats?
[02:35:32.240 --> 02:35:36.000]  How many times have we tried to call that number on air? Probably 20. And what they
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:41.480]  did, they never answered. Or once they did, and it was like rerouted to 911. Outside the
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:46.480]  Capitol building and they were getting calls in and they were investigating what typically
[02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:47.480]  happens in this situation.
[02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:51.840]  That's enough. You know, the last four or five times this happened, it was backfires
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:58.000]  in the parking garage. Guy's search, Capitol evacuated for backfires. In the parking garage
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:02.120]  of it, there was a backfire in front. Landed the free home of the brave. Everyone falls
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:03.120]  in.
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:06.120]  In land of the free home of the brave, you fall in your back like a turtle or a beetle
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:12.440]  and you go, uh, uh, and then that's supposedly is what a person does. Just everyone grovels
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:16.680]  and says, black scheme that saved me. If there's any type of problem, but when there's a real
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:22.160]  shooting, then the SWAT team's order to stand down. And the word is from Pacheting. He's
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:28.160]  coming on tomorrow is that he actually has the sources that that was a staged event.
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:31.120]  So we're going to be breaking that down. And the ATF says they're not allowed to go in
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:32.120]  there.
[02:36:32.120 --> 02:36:37.680]  But of course, this is just a government that's been caught hundreds of times engaged in thousands
[02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:43.480]  of different operations that have killed us troops, foster kids, poor people in the Appalachians,
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:47.840]  poor blacks in Alabama to ski the experiment. Everybody knows about that. So I mentioned
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:53.600]  that one. There are thousands of those ongoing where they just kill people. It's like, Oh,
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:56.920]  the government's secretly kills people and gets caught and then get in trouble, but everything's
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:01.280]  fine. Take these shots. They really want you to take them. I mean, that's not even two
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:07.960]  plus two equals four. Of course, a common core listener would actually say to me, well, it
[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:12.920]  actually equals five. By the way, I have a crew member who has family that lives in New
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:21.880]  York who are big Obama supporters, big liberals. They're finally awake because my crew members,
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:28.640]  niece going to public school is being taught two plus two equals five is being told to
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:33.920]  do math questions. There are multiple choice that answer questions about the family where
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:40.280]  he write like essays, where they have properly asked questions where if you don't do your
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:47.560]  homework or if you don't do the dishes, does your mom yell at you, spank you, hurts you.
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:52.680]  And of course, even the Obama supporters understand this is ways with their name on it to get intel
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:38:00.040]  on the family with third graders. Of course, on record, they're doing it. But imagine even
[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:05.920]  the Obama supporters love their kids enough that when the third grader, I guess that's
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:12.800]  seven, eight years old comes home and is taught two plus two equals five or whatever. It's
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:18.400]  stuff like that. That it is flipping them out because not only is it two plus two equals
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:24.280]  five, that's first grade stuff or kindergarten stuff. They're now retrograding back to kindergarten
[02:38:24.280 --> 02:38:31.680]  work for a students. It's meant to wreck everything. Intelligence is the enemy of this military
[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:37.080]  takeover. But it works against them. It's like they had like nine different NSA cops
[02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:40.640]  out there with the cameras for 20 minutes because she already said, and they couldn't
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:48.280]  figure out how to erase it. They were unable to put it in and flip through the camera and
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:54.240]  hit erase, erase, erase. Of course, they don't even know we can extract it off there anyways.
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:38:59.720]  I mean, I thought cops knew stuff like this. So it's just, it's not like it's something
[02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:05.080]  secret anyways. It's a parking lot outside the gate entrance. Just, I mean, we don't
[02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:08.600]  even want the stupid footage. That's why I was telling Gucci already, well, let them
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:11.560]  erase it if they're going to take it away, but it didn't matter. They just did it anyways.
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:15.880]  And of course, we had a live feed. They didn't seem to understand that because he's on the
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:22.200]  tape going live feed. And then I goes, huh, what's that? I'm sorry. I'm not trying to
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:30.000]  be mean here. It's just ridiculous. And why are these cops who normally aren't at Mount
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:35.640]  Verdon or aren't at the World War II Memorial, they're ordered in overtime federal police
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:43.520]  to go guard it and not let people into it as a stunt. That's now come out as a stunt.
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:50.240]  Why are the cops not getting with their union and refusing to do this? We want you to go
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:56.440]  out to Mount Vernon and not let people in. And the cops are like, okay, instead of, well,
[02:39:56.440 --> 02:40:00.760]  that's a private group run by a private company that's a profit maker. And they have tourists
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:05.600]  coming in there by the thousands. We don't, that's not even federal, federally controlled
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:12.240]  now. They just go, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let me do that. Let me do that. Let
[02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:16.360]  me do that. Let me do that. Just a nation of, I'll do that. I'll do that. I'll do what
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:21.600]  I'm told. I'll do it. It's like Austin cops. Almost every Austin cop I run into is actually
[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:26.640]  pretty nice. A listener. I mean, they're not perfect, but compared to a lot of cities,
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:30.800]  I got to admit, we have pretty good cops in Austin on average. As the city gets bigger,
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:33.920]  there's more problems. They're going to be statistically more, more bad things that happen.
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:39.080]  And they just fired a cop that for no reason shot at some guy at a traffic stop. So I mean,
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:42.840]  they're doing the right thing on a lot of levels, but still my people are out there.
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:49.680]  Then I'm going to your calls five months ago, handing out free, free and fall wars magazines.
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:55.920]  They're handing them out and the cops come over and say, you're not allowed to hand those
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:00.600]  out in Austin. We said, first amendment, there's no law. And they said, we're just been told
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:07.040]  we're sorry. And then I get the cops on the phone via cell phone with my street team and
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:11.200]  I say, listen, I'm going to sue you. If you keep this up, you know, there's no law. He
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:14.000]  goes, man, I've just been told to do this. And I said, you better get your superior.
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:18.440]  Cause I said, I don't want to sue you, but let me tell you, I got 10,000 magazines and
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:22.440]  a group paid to hand these out and I'm going to make a big deal of this. I'm coming back
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:26.360]  from the Texas coast right now. I'm getting in my car. I'm not supposed to come back till
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:31.040]  tomorrow. I'm coming down there right now. And I said, I'm not threatening you. I'm
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:36.720]  going to sue you. Don't violate my first amendment. He goes, Oh, I know Alex. I know. Then they
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:41.080]  go and then they send the code enforcers. I get them on the phone as I'm driving back
[02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:44.720]  and I go, I'm going to sue you. And the guy's like, listen, I'm a listener. I don't like
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:49.080]  this and I've been told by the city to do it. I said, you better tell them, no, I'm
[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:56.080]  going to sue you. And then by the time I got there, they backed off. But I mean, why do
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:01.840]  you follow illegal orders? Do you think I wanted to come home a day early and pull my
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:07.320]  kids out of the hotel swimming pool and get in my car and point it up here on a little
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:10.760]  two day vacation I had? You think I wanted that to go down there and bullhorned South
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:16.600]  by Southwest that it turned out a bunch of out of control local mafia had had ordered
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:21.000]  us shut down and no free speech in Austin literally claiming they own the whole city.
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:25.240]  They even try to send police. We learned to private bars that have their own live music
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:31.280]  saying no live music's allowed unless they run it literally, literally boss hog behavior.
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:37.640]  Why were you following the orders of those dirtbags? A bunch of beatnik mafia who make
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:41.040]  you know, $20 million a year off the thing with a bunch of yuppies thinking they're going
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:48.200]  to be famous giant scam. I mean, what is wrong with you? All right, I'm ranting and I apologize.
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:54.560]  I just go over the map, don't I? I'm supposed to do final voiceovers for Obama deception
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:59.840]  to today. My voice is blown from screaming earlier. I just cannot do it anymore. People
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:04.640]  say why don't I have a deep voice? It's not a deep voice. It's a fried voice is what
[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:10.320]  it is. Autobots transform and roll out. Let's go ahead and talk to Alan and Delaware. Thanks
[02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:15.760]  for holding her on the air, Alan. Hey, Alex, man, so good to talk to you again. You know,
[02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:19.760]  something we've got to change the way we talk in this country. The problem that we have
[02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:24.360]  right now is people are calling them Republicans and Democrats and politicians. They're plot
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:31.400]  and plotting, plotting, plotting, plotting. They're Nazis, Alex. They are parasite scum
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:39.000]  run by foreign banks given orders to totally shut everything down. We are in the most diabolical
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:44.880]  bugs bunny cartoon and Elmer Fudd is running around with guns trying to set up these false
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:49.800]  flags. And let me tell you something, people. I'm not doing the every man show on blog talk
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:54.640]  radio because I'm a moron. I'm doing it because I've got to put out the word. Alex, you've
[02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:59.520]  inspired me in ways I can't tell you. Do you know I quit eating aspartame just six weeks
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:08.320]  ago? I've lost 27 pounds at 56 years old. I'm jumping through hoops and over the moon
[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:13.160]  off the cornfruit toast. I'm eating vitamins. I'm trying to get the best I can. I'm out
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:20.320]  of money. Terrorism, terrorism, terrorism, take, it's racist. Take fluoride, drink fluoride,
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:24.640]  eat GMO, go to McDonald's or you're racist. All right, here I am out here in the middle
[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:29.000]  of my field here in Delaware. Racist. I got my house from the bank. Look at it. Listen.
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:33.840]  No, no, Michael Moore said being white living in the countryside is racist. Racist, racist,
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:39.720]  racist. I'm standing, listen, I got this corn in my hand. It's on the stalk. That's racist.
[02:44:39.720 --> 02:44:45.880]  And I'm looking at the corn. There's no bugs on the corn. There's no bugs flying around
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:53.160]  the corn. I've got three bugs, Alex. One of them is a black bee with a horse fly body.
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:58.920]  That's an Alcataw. It's got the gold, you know, the gold like, what do you call it?
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:04.520]  The thing around his neck, the nape, and he's got two big eyes and horse fly. I had another
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:10.360]  one with spiders with eyes on his antennas, calling up my house. Now I'm telling you people
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:15.120]  that Delaware, whether you believe it or not, this is Biden territory. Okay, both Biden.
[02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:18.560]  Oh, I know, I know they're doing all sorts of mutations of everything right now. No,
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:21.960]  that's, you're right. A lot of the birds and stuff are dying. Most of the bees are dying.
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:27.000]  It's okay though. It's okay. Just eat the GMO brother drink. The glyphosate will help
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:34.400]  you. Do you believe both Biden was sick a month ago? I believe both Biden loves us. I believe
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:39.360]  that both Biden went down to Texas to say goodbye to George Bush senior. I believe they
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:45.240]  moved the paraglade on 100,000 acres on the biggest aquafire on. I agree, but it's for
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:46.240]  the children.
[02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:47.240]  Into the southern hemisphere.
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:48.240]  The racist.
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:51.520]  I got five bottles. Listen, I got five bottles of your nascent comment. I'm waiting on it
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:55.880]  right now. It should have been delivered here by now. And when I heard Dick Cheney 10 years
[02:45:55.880 --> 02:45:59.680]  ago, or even just how long was it? I think it was back in eight.
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:04.120]  Hey, what do you mean should have been delivered? We've only been selling it since last Thursday.
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:09.160]  Well, I got what I could. I got a yard sale going. I'm getting I'm fine as much as I
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:12.880]  can with all the money that I have right now.
[02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:16.440]  Well, listen, brother, you sound fired up. I'm going to jump to other folks, but God
[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:20.360]  bless you. Yeah, no, there are all sorts of mutations in plants and animals happening.
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:26.720]  You've got all this GMO crops that have animal genes, insect genes in them. It's all sorts
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:30.640]  of weird mutations are happening. The government did it to help you though. They did it because
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:35.620]  they love you and Al Gore cares about you. Speaking of nascent iodine, we sold out of
[02:46:35.620 --> 02:46:39.760]  it, but they hadn't delivered it all to us. So I'd forgotten when I said we were sold
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:45.040]  out that 2,300 bottles or something showed up yesterday. So we actually have some more
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:48.560]  now we've shipped out almost all the orders that came in. And then we're going to have
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:52.640]  more coming in next week, but I have a small shipping crew. So we're trying to get it all
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:57.880]  out to you. It is the amazing atomic nascent iodine with all the Fukushima news. Like they
[02:46:57.880 --> 02:47:04.120]  had more AP Reuters news about leaking reactors today. This is what I did for my family to
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:08.640]  protect my thyroid, because all the scientists and medical doctors, people I talked to said
[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:13.600]  what blows away all the other iodine is the nascent is the atomic iodine info wars, life
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:17.720]  dot com. We've got it. I'm glad you brought that up. You can see a video up there in force
[02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:22.440]  life.com that links to the sub page of info or store.com where we cover it all our folks
[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:29.720]  can call toll 3888-253-3139 or and your purchase supports the broadcast. So thank you caller.
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:37.200]  Now in California, you're on the air. Go ahead now in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:46.800]  I love you, Alex. Let me turn off my computer so you can hear me. I'm a subscriber. I have
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:53.400]  fallen in love with info wars and GCN prison planet. I can't get enough of it. I just watched
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:48:00.840]  the broadcast that you did with Anthony Gucci already live at the NSA Utah parking lot confrontation.
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:06.440]  Yes, ma'am. I gotta tell you, he gave me an adrenaline rush. It got me so hyped up and
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:15.000]  so mad. I feel like opening up a can of what that sounds extremist. It probably is. So
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:18.680]  you like George Washington. You like freedom. You like private property. You don't like
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:26.200]  the NSA spying on you illegally. That's extreme. I know it is and I'm proud of it. Listen,
[02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:31.720]  I have been paying federal taxes since I was 14 years old in Texas. You could work when
[02:48:31.720 --> 02:48:38.560]  you were 14 47 and a half years. I've been paying and because I was so ignorant, I didn't
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:45.400]  know that I was helping develop a corrupt government. I learned now. Well, we've certainly
[02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:52.800]  grown the biggest, most demonic, sickening creature ever seen. I didn't know that my
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:57.320]  my rights were being violated and stepped on. I gotta tell you, I handed to my brother
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:02.080]  who lives in Texas for a year over a year. He handed me. You gotta listen. You gotta
[02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:06.240]  listen. You gotta listen coast to coast. Go to coast to coast. That's where I heard you,
[02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:11.600]  Alex, the first time I heard you on coast to coast. I thought, who in the world is this
[02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:17.480]  guy? So I started checking you out and there were some rams I listened to. I thought he
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:22.960]  needs to be on medication. But the more I listened to you, you became like family to
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:28.360]  me and you tolerate a lot to get the message. Well, you tolerate a lot of me, ma'am. I am
[02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:33.640]  crazed and I get very upset about this stuff. So I do that like a fool sometimes. It doesn't
[02:49:33.640 --> 02:49:38.800]  matter. I'm not the one secretly spy on everybody or putting cancer viruses in the vaccines
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:45.720]  and we should get crazy angry over what they're doing to us. I have paid my dues. I have passed
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:53.400]  the point of menopause now. I am standing up now. I am ready to get loud, get mad instead
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:50:00.160]  of hiding behind my computer, trying to be invisible to the NSA and everybody else. I've
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:05.720]  decided to get radical. I opened a Twitter account. I opened a Facebook account. It
[02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:12.440]  says, we love Alex. That's who I am on Facebook. I am going to post and I am going to tweet
[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:18.400]  and tell my fingertips are raw. That's exciting. Absolutely. The war is on the web and then
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:21.640]  it manifests physically. God bless you, ma'am. Good to hear from you. I'm going to try to
[02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:29.040]  jam in Joshua, Jeff, Kat, Corey, and others. Actually, Corey is after Joshua. Then we'll
[02:50:29.040 --> 02:50:34.600]  go to Kat and then Jeff on the other side of this quick break. But I'm usually pretty
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:38.240]  crazy and exhausted about a third hour. But then I hit my second win later within full
[02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:42.800]  wars nightly news, seven o'clock central. But let me tell you, we are certainly making
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:47.960]  history together by boldly standing in the face of the tyrants and telling them that
[02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:52.960]  we see them and we've come here to do two things, chew gum and kick new world order
[02:50:52.960 --> 02:51:05.960]  boot day and we're all out of bubble gum. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[02:51:05.960 --> 02:51:10.800]  Curious about what comes next next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you
[02:51:10.800 --> 02:51:15.920]  arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars. Fool the bad guys with
[02:51:15.920 --> 02:51:22.480]  a new improved fake TV. You asked for it. We listened and we made our new fake TV three
[02:51:22.480 --> 02:51:27.000]  times brighter than our previous model. The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:33.200]  to a 40 inch TV. It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from
[02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:37.960]  home. And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass
[02:51:37.960 --> 02:51:43.800]  your house and move on to an easier target. The new brighter fake TV is only $39.95 and
[02:51:43.800 --> 02:51:55.040]  includes free shipping. Go to fakeTV.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV. That's 877-532-5388
[02:51:55.040 --> 02:52:00.960]  or go to fakeTV.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:52:00.960 --> 02:52:05.440]  My name's Bruno. I'm 52 years old. I've tried different protein powders over the years and
[02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:09.200]  they've all tasted pretty bad. I tried one world way and found it to be delicious. After
[02:52:09.200 --> 02:52:13.520]  10 weeks on one world way, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than
[02:52:13.520 --> 02:52:18.440]  when you were 20 years old. My body has changed dramatically. I'm a cyclist. Normally I'll
[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:23.680]  ride two days on and take two days off. After being on one world way, I rode 10 days in
[02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:28.560]  a row in over 100 degree heat and then I take another two servings of one world way and
[02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:32.320]  then work out at the gym for another hour and a half. I just couldn't believe these
[02:52:32.320 --> 02:52:37.720]  results. My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone. Don't
[02:52:37.720 --> 02:52:42.720]  take my word for it. One world way comes in single servings, just give it a try.
[02:52:42.720 --> 02:52:51.440]  For a health and taste sensation you'll love, call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325. That's

[02:53:02.120 --> 02:53:07.560]  That's the sound of a 44 Magnum and TraumaMax, a high-tech hybrid Kevlar bulletproof vest
[02:53:07.560 --> 02:53:13.800]  from infidelbodyarmor.com. We'll stop it and most pistol rounds. TraumaMax is a major breakthrough
[02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:20.040]  in pistol-rated body armor and prices started just $170 per insert. More protection, more
[02:53:20.040 --> 02:53:27.000]  stopping power, more mobility and it weighs less than five pounds. Get details at infidelbodyarmor.com.

[02:54:22.640 --> 02:54:27.520]  You can go to drugsreport.com. You can see the photo of the SWAT team cop with the M16
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:38.520]  or M4 laying prone guarding the, guarding the Capitol. And it says report officer down
[02:54:38.520 --> 02:54:46.920]  and continuing orders. Stay away from windows, lockdown, police shooter in custody, developing.
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:53.040]  So that's the news and the info that we've got right there. We'll also get that up on
[02:54:53.040 --> 02:55:00.360]  infowars.com and prisonplotter.com. But that is the latest, latest on that. They make a
[02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:03.680]  huge deal out of any type of shooting. I hope it doesn't turn out to be something big, but
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:08.720]  I'll tell you, this is the season for a distraction to change the subject away from Obama because
[02:55:08.720 --> 02:55:13.400]  everything he's doing is imploding right now. Very, very suspicious. And we know they've
[02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:18.800]  staged other things in the past. They can be staging anything. Okay, let's go back
[02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:20.640]  to the calls. Joshua in California.
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:28.320]  Alex, I'm so freaked out right now. You were talking about the new moving. I've known for
[02:55:28.320 --> 02:55:33.840]  a couple years now that the target was San Francisco and I didn't know exactly what the
[02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:37.320]  details were, but I knew that there was something connected to the movie Star Trek. Remember
[02:55:37.320 --> 02:55:42.280]  how this kind of goes back to like the shooting with the Sandy Hook thing being in the Batman?
[02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:48.560]  The same thing going on right here. And it's the newer one. Notice how the bombing is this.
[02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:52.560]  It's an archive. Supposedly in London, right? But it's not really London. It's actually
[02:55:52.560 --> 02:55:55.840]  San Francisco. And like if you watch the trailer, you can kind of see the little hints that
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:55:59.640]  they're giving here. And if you remember, the archive wasn't really archived. It was
[02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:05.520]  secretly a government, sort of like a database. And the big deal about that being the Bay
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:09.240]  Area is that's more like all the YouTube and the Facebook stuff like that is, which you
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:14.400]  even talk about how that's the archives. I did think it looked like they were preparing
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:20.520]  people for a terror attack on San Francisco in the new Star Trek movie. But Batman specifically,
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:25.000]  because in the original 60s or 70s Batman, we played the clip, they talk about skull
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:30.080]  and bones, the Illuminati, and that's really where Batman comes from. That's actually in
[02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:36.280]  the old original TV show Batman that was so corny. And then I noticed in the other ones,
[02:56:36.280 --> 02:56:40.640]  they were clearly putting programming. And they clearly said Sandy Hook, this is where
[02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:44.840]  the Joker's supposed to attack. And then the new one, they put stuff like that. And it's
[02:56:44.840 --> 02:56:50.280]  about the Illuminati staging events to cause a revolution. So I know for a fact they're
[02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:56.240]  putting programming in for their own people. And almost like psychopaths always leave cards
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:57:02.160]  or mail letters to the police taunting them. That particular franchise does that. I don't
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:06.320]  know if all the franchises are doing it. I know there's predictive programming in the
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:12.920]  original Star Trek with the whole UN world government, the UN symbol of the federation,
[02:57:12.920 --> 02:57:20.400]  that whole idea. And of course, the original author was a Bradbury of Star Trek, Roddenberry
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:26.640]  admitted all of that. So that's not debatable. I appreciate your call. Let's go to Corey
[02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:33.160]  in North Dakota. Corey, you're on the air. Yes, sir. You got me? Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[02:57:33.160 --> 02:57:36.400]  I just want to say thank you to you and your fieldmen for getting out there and putting
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:40.400]  the big targets on your back. Just like a lot of us veterans have after coming home
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:46.160]  and listening to the NSA and what our government has to say about us. And also, with the information
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:51.920]  that you guys are going out and gathering, it's we're senior leadership in the guard.
[02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:56.760]  I'm talking officers, senior NCOs. We are talking to our younger troops. We're getting
[02:57:56.760 --> 02:58:00.520]  them off the video games as much as we can. Those guys are going out. They're coming
[02:58:00.520 --> 02:58:04.840]  back to the next drill. They're giving us information and feedback with what we've
[02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:09.480]  told them to look up and research. Your movies look up the stuff for themselves about how
[02:58:09.480 --> 02:58:13.440]  the globalists are working, the trilateral groups, everything you talk about. I just
[02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:17.640]  want to say thanks again. And another thing that the military is waking up. I'm on the
[02:58:17.640 --> 02:58:21.200]  shooting team here in our state and I was made it to the regional shoot and I was talking
[02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:24.560]  to some guys. I mentioned your names down and we're down in the pit, shooting, pulling,
[02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:28.760]  dropping targets and all the heads turned and everybody was nodding up and down. And
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:32.680]  then I made it onto the national shoot at the Winston P. Wilkins and we were talking.
[02:58:32.680 --> 02:58:33.760]  At Princeton, everybody was...
[02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:37.280]  Tell you what, I want to hear this. We're going into overdrive. Don't hang up, Corey.
[02:58:37.280 --> 02:58:39.280]  This is exciting. The military is waking up.

[03:00:44.720 --> 03:00:50.000]  Corey calling in and the news he's giving us about a lot of people in the National Guard,
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:55.840]  regular, big army, all of it being awake is very good. And you know I fall off the handle
[03:00:55.840 --> 03:01:01.920]  of the security personnel at the NSA but only because they're there full well knowing that
[03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:06.640]  they're trying to act like citizen reporters are evil when we all know who really runs
[03:01:06.640 --> 03:01:10.840]  Al Qaeda. And we all really know the globalists are trying to shut this country down right
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:18.000]  now and we have a real chance at turning things around today. We have a real chance
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:24.160]  if we awaken the mass of society to what's happening and to what's going on. But we have
[03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:29.120]  to admit that our government's been captured and that they're planning to stage large events
[03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:35.160]  but that was very exciting. Finishing up there Corey in North Dakota you said you were down
[03:01:35.160 --> 03:01:41.280]  the shooting pit and mentioned my name and the heads all turned. Please continue. Yes
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:47.480]  sir. You're pretty well known within the military. A lot of guys are first time listeners
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:51.040]  and they're saying well he sounds like he's a little bit off the wall and I said you get
[03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:54.520]  the guy fired up. It's no different when you get fired up over something that you don't
[03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:58.640]  like or something that you believe and somebody else is saying something against for what
[03:01:58.640 --> 03:02:03.360]  you feel. You're going to get fired up. You need to listen to the content when this man
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:08.680]  speaks with passion because it is real. This is not an act. I've been listening to him
[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:15.200]  for a few years and it is awakened me. I'm doing my own research to the point where we
[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:19.520]  take some of my buddies from the unit will come out and play risk with my son. But we
[03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:23.080]  don't play risk normally. We'll play risk and I'll play the new world order. And my
[03:02:23.080 --> 03:02:26.360]  sons are informing themselves to the point where they'll call out what we're doing because
[03:02:26.360 --> 03:02:31.320]  they've seen it on TV or seen it on the news. It's pretty sad when the globalists can't
[03:02:31.320 --> 03:02:34.800]  even fool a couple of 14 year old clean voice.
[03:02:34.800 --> 03:02:39.200]  Well the truth is we're just rediscovering what it is to be free. If you're not be wearing
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:43.400]  out of control government or an infiltrated government, if you're not be wearing someone
[03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:47.600]  taking your liberties, you will be enslaved. I mean Thomas Jefferson said even if you try
[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:51.000]  to protect it, you're probably not going to keep it. I mean that's the thing. You either
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:55.480]  aggressively defend your freedom and your individual liberty or it will be taken. And
[03:02:55.480 --> 03:03:00.160]  special interests, I get chills when I talk about this, have come in and taken over and
[03:03:00.160 --> 03:03:05.880]  everybody just wants to go along to get along and it's only going to get worse until we
[03:03:05.880 --> 03:03:11.800]  wake people up. But our birthright as a free society is to understand that when anybody
[03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:17.600]  says give up your liberty for security, they're a tyrant. And God bless you. And again folks,
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:22.520]  statistically the globalist know the military is the biggest threat. That's why they demonize
[03:03:22.520 --> 03:03:25.920]  the military. You're like, but they're going to use the military. It's like Stuart Rhodes
[03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:29.760]  came on from Oathkeepers and said we need to get the military, especially retired veterans
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:34.640]  to help lead communities to get prepared for an economic collapse. The Swiss are preparing
[03:03:34.640 --> 03:03:38.440]  for economic collapse outside of Switzerland. They believe it's going to happen. That was
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:43.080]  in the news yesterday and Stuart Rhodes is flying into town next week to talk about this
[03:03:43.080 --> 03:03:47.600]  on air with us. He's absolutely right. It really hit me when he was saying that the
[03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:52.800]  other day how important this is that that's their checkmate unless we get ready for it.
[03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:56.160]  But some people were commenting going why is the military going to be the answer if the
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:04:00.160]  military runs for the new world order. They don't work for the new world order. They're
[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:06.040]  fraudulently under new order control. But imagine if we wake them up, it's over before
[03:04:06.040 --> 03:04:12.880]  they get their robots and drones and centralized systems in place. I apologize to Kat and Jeff
[03:04:12.880 --> 03:04:17.080]  and Mike and Chase. We're out of time. I can't keep doing overdrive. I'm exhausted. I've
[03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:22.000]  got to go take a break for about 30 minutes. I'll work on Obama deception too and a bunch
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:26.480]  of other stuff that's going on. We're about to upload high death footage in the next hour
[03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:33.760]  to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com of my team there in Utah. We salute them and pray
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:39.520]  for them going up and covering the NSA, the high death footage of the military taking
[03:04:39.520 --> 03:04:44.560]  our cameras or the NSA private security, I should say, that has military rank, taking
[03:04:44.560 --> 03:04:48.920]  the cameras and then thinking they erased the footage. That's all being uploaded right
[03:04:48.920 --> 03:04:55.040]  now and we'll have that linked up on infowars.com in the near future and the next hour or so
[03:04:55.040 --> 03:05:21.800]  and more on the nightly news tonight, seven o'clock central. God bless you all.
